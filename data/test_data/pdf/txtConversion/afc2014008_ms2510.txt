By Michael Churchill
 
"We are not t
rying t
he c
redibili-
t
y o
f t
he r
eports (
of t
he HUAC).
 
We have one man on t
rial, t
hat's
 
a
ll." —Judge Thomas F
. Murphy.
 
"Some o
f my ancestors were r
e-
l
igious d
issenters  who  came  t
o
 
America over 3
00 years ago. Oth-
e
rs more r
ecently were abolition-
i
sts i
n New England i
n t
he 1
840s
 
and '
50s, and  I believe  t
hat  i
n
 
choosing my p
resent course I do
 
no d
ishonor t
o e
ither t
hem o
r t
o
 
t
he people who may f
ollow me." —
 
Peter Seeger.
 
Peter Seeger i
s probably Ameri-
ca's most popular f
olksinger —cer-
t
ainly he i
s i
ts most recorded one.
 
He i
s a
lso a
 man convicted o
f c
rimi-
nal  contempt  o
f  Congress,  and
 
s
entenced t
o a year i
n j
ail.
 
The r
oad t
o such a paradoxical
 
position began f
or the l
anky c
lass-
mate o
f Jack Kennedy 2
2 years
 
ago when he began t
ouring t
he
 
country, s
inging f
or whoever would
 
l
isten.  In  the  process  he  grew
 
wealthy enough t
o af
ford t
o build
 
— with h
is own hands —a l
og cabin
 
pearched h
igh on a b
ill  I
n New
 
York's Dutchess county. He a
lso
 
became f
amous enough t
o be call-
ed before the House Un-American
 
Activities Committee's hearings i
n
 
New York I
n 1
955.  Despite h
is
 
t
remendous  c
ritical  and  popular
 
acclaim, he r
etains a modesty and
 
d
isarming f
rankness —as when, a
f-
t
er r
eading a g
lowing t
ribute f
rom
 
Carl Sandburg, he bashfully smil-
ed and said he would keqp a copy
 
o
f I
t i
n h
is wallet because "
it's
 
s
ort o
f n
ice."
 
Seeger,  however,  has  consist-
ently a
rgued t
hat h
is own person-
a
lity i
s not a
t i
ssue i
n h
is conflict
 
with t
he HUAC, but t
hat t
he ques-
t
ion I
s one o
f principle i
nvolving
 
f
undamental  American  l
iberties.
 
"No American should have t
o an-
swer t
hose questions. I
 t
hink t
hey
 
a
re  improper  questions  f
or  an

or a r
ally beside t
he United Nations
 
building i
n New York, Easter Weekend, '
61.
 
American t
o be a
sked," he main-
t
ains.
 
This moral note was s
truck I
n
 
t
he very beginning when Seeger
 
based h
is r
efusal t
o answer o
f t
he
 
HTJAC'S not on the f
amiliar F
ifth
 
Amendment
 grounds
 protecting
 
h
im f
rom  s
elf-Incrimination,  but
 
on t
he First Amendment r
ights of
 
f
reedom o
f speech and privacy o
f
 
belief.
 
A MODERN TRAGIC HERO
 
Moral points, however, a
re no-
t
oriously d

n

t was this necersity o

so t
ar as t
o c
laim that Seeger's
 
r
efusal t
o answer was i
n i
tself an
 
answer.
 The  s
ignificant  r
esult,
 
however, was that while no such
 
checks h
inder the HUAC, Ross's
 
tactics were  unsuccessful  i
n  a
 
court o
f l
aw; t
he j
udge never l
et
 
h
im i
ndulge i
n them, s
ternly not-
i
ng that i
t was Seeger —not  the
 
HUAC —which was on t
rial.
 
Indeed, Judge Murphy t
ook such
 
a narrow v
iew o
f what was r
ele-
vant that i
t s
everly hamstrung the
 
defense.  (One  o
f  t
he  c
ruelest
 
i
ronies o
f t
he t
rial, therefore, was
 
that i
t was Judge Murphy h
imself
 
who asked t
he  most  i
rrelevant
 
question during the f
our days. Im-
mediately  before  he  s
entenced
 
Seeger,  he asked the f
olksinger
 
whether, i
ndeed, he was a mem-
ber o
f t
he Communist Party.) Al-
t
hough t
he HUAC counsel was a
l-
l
owed t
o t
estify t
hat the commit-
t
ee had "never" engaged i
n ex-
posure f
or  exposure  sake  or i

rom t

o destroy  the  wit-
nesses' credibility by c
iting Com-
mittee activities i
n o
ther i
nvestiga-
t
ions.  Restricted to dealing with
 
the New York City hearings, Ross
 
wanted t
o show that the i
nvestiga-
t
ion was not motivated by concern
 
with communist activity, but had
 
been i
nstigated by  a prominent
 
b
lacklisting organization I
n t
he i
n-
dustry, A WARE, Inc., and that Its
 
purpose was t
o i
nfluence the Ameri-
can Federation o
f Television and
 
Radio Artists (AFTRA) debate on
 
b
lacklising. Judge Murphy d
id a

l
ow

everal

 about
 
A WARE, but t
hey  l
ed  nowhere.
 
Congressmen Walter f
latly denied
 
any i
ntention o
f b

t
estified that he couldn't r
emember
 
meeting the d
irector o
f A WARE.
 
Vincent Hartnett, a
lthugh Hartnett
 
t
estified the next day that he met
 
Walter,  urged  t
he  i
nvestigation,
 
and  d
iscussed  the  s
ituation  i
n
 
AFTRA with the Congressman.
 
Murphy a

t
ions he r
efused t
o answer were
 
merely o
f f
act and p
lace.
 
Here again t
he nature o
f t
he l
aw
 
constrained the defense.  I
n chal-
l
enging t
he validity o
f the Com-
mittee's specific questions, i
t was
 
not a
llowed t
o examine whether the
 
Committee had i
nformation making
 
i
ts questions pertinent, or whether
 
t
hey were part o
f a
 g
eneral dragnet.
 
The net l
egal r
esult was thus
 
complete f
ailure f
or Seeger. There
 
i
s a wide d
if
ference between ques-
t
ions which should be asked and
 
t
hose which can be asked,  and
 
Judge Murphy ruled that the f
olk-
s
inger had not been asked anything
 
i
l
legally. And then t
he prosecuter
 
r
idiculed Seeger's contention t
hat
 
h
is political r
ights or philosophic
 
beliefs were i
nfringed by asking
 
h
im whether he appeared  i
n  a
 
p
icture o
f a parade!
 
One r
ecourse r
emained f
or t
he
 
defense, and that was t
o maintain
 
t
hat Seeger had not been c
learly i
n-
f
ormed as t
o the pertinency o
f t
he
 
HUAC i
nquiry and o
f i
ts questions.
 
Although Seeger was absent f
rom
 
t
he Committee session where t
he
 
i
nquiry's purpose was of
ficially an-
nounced, t
he j
ury concluded t
hat
 
t
he hearings he heard before he
 
t
estified and the general nature o
f
 
t
he-questions asked made h
im suf-
f
iciently aware o
f the i
nquiry's pur-
pose. I
t i
s another i
rony o
f t
he case
 
t
hat this t
echnical point i
s prob-
ably one o
f Seeger's best grounds
 
f
or appeal, because the Supreme
 
Court has consistently  protected
 
such f
ormal procedural r
ights. But
 
while v
ictory on t
hat basis would
 
keep Seeger out o
f j
ail, i
t would
 
s
carcely provide t
he moral v
ictory
 
over t
he committee which he i
n-
t
ended by h
is defiance.
 
One conclusion f
rom t
he  case
 
could be t
o confirm the observation
 
o
f Professor Mark de Wolfe Howe
 
t
hat "The court has  ruled  that
 
Congress has the power t
o make a
 
f
ool o
f i
tself." But t
he danger I
s
 
t
hat s
ome, l
ike Judge Murphy who
 
s
entenced the s
inger t
o j
ail f
or a
 
year and r
efused h
im the customary
 
bail  while  appealing,  will  not
 
r
ecognize t
he very l
imitations o
f t
he
 
court-room process. We have a
 l
ong
 
t
radition t
hat the political world i
n-
volves moral as well as l
egal i
ssues.
 
I
t would be unfortunate i
f debate
 
over the l
egal propriety o
f HUAC
 
i
nvestigations and Seeger's actions
 
made us f
orget t
o ask whether they
 
were morally and politically r
ight.

I think perhaps the beat thing is for people to actually
 
read the hearings of 1955 and l
et then male up their own minds about it,
 
without me trying to no into elaborate explanations of why I answered
 
some questions -
 such as my na m
e and address -
-
 but refused to answer
 
other questions such as who did I know, and where and when did I ever
 
sing.  In these hearings I stated that I didn't want to east any asper.
 
siena en neople who had used the Fifth Amendment; I simply did not
 
feel that I wanted t
o use it myself.  As my lawyer has explained it to
 
me, using the Fifth Amendment is in affect saying "you have no right to
 
ask me this question", but using the First means in effect "you have
 
no rlAht to ask a
Am
ioan such questions.  Since I felt I was in a
 
strong enough position to make a broader attack upon the corn'iittee, I
 
obese, in ef
fect, the second oe w
'ee........
 
In an interview a couple of weeks are with a professor
 
from Southern California who is making a detailed study of my case and
 
others like it, I was asked "do you think that Congress does net have
 
any right to have investigating committees of any sort?".  Naturally,
 
I had to agree that Congress does have a right to investigate things,
 
and s&, of its investigations have been extremely important and have
 
brought out things which the normal investigative bodies do not bring
 
out, such as the Teapot Dome scandal and the La Follette f
indings on
 
the labor spy racket.  However, when Congress Investigates something,
 
It is quite a different thi n
g from having a perennial junket to expose
 
ertactly la&
.il activities.
 upeaing there were a few Congresp
n
 
who thought that 211,  oil companies were run by a bunch of crooks,
 
and they kaplup every single year since Teapot Dome a running investi-
gation where they could call the executives of any oil company on the
 
stand and, by asking then pet
, ed questions with no chance for rebuttal, 
make it
 pear that they were engaged in shady business practices.
 
Supposing even that following the La Follette investigation, there was
 
a perennjel investigation into the use of  n
x detective agency. Now, it
 
is perfectly legal to run detective agencies, but a perennial committee
 
could make it leek as though any detective agency was literally a labor
 
spy racket.
 
In effeot, this is what the un-American activities con.
 
mittes has been doing for twenty-five years nowe  Under the pretense o
f
 
investigating conspiracy, they have aotttally been in the perennial busi-
ness of exposing heresy -
-
 that is, exposing to the public v
iew o all the
 
na m
es they can possibly get of anyone who over had anything to di with
 
any es-oc Ued radical organi zation, however legal this organization
 
might have been.  This, to my mind. Is a complete distortion of the car-
root p
raoti cea and the legal practices of Congress.  And my beet defense,
 
frankly, is a hard-hitting offense to try and put this committee out of
 
business. Tt's hurttng all of us -
-
 it's hurting AmerloeA and the world.
 
In other words, it'a net enough to simply try and claim "Pete is innocent
 
I'm no more innocent than any ether normal sinful human being.  T
owever,
 
this committee is h
arming A
merica, and t
he sooner we  ge t rid W it, the
 
better.
 
To understand why it is harming  n
ierioa is difficult and
 
oen'e be done In two or three words.  The newspaper headlines of 1it.ral1
 
-
.2 -
decades have to be rebutted.  Perhaps the best way they can be rebutted
 
is to tell a detailed a
r
-0
, specific story about one person.  If this one
 
person has to be me, why then I guess I am perfectly willing to have
 
it told.  This is why I usually preface any statement about this trial
 
with quoting what I told the oeir
4xnittee and what I told the judge
 
namely, "I have never done anything conspiratorial in my life nor sung
 
anything nor supported anything e.nspiratoria]. In any way."  This I
 s a
 
very bread statement to make.  The committee olaims to be intestigating
 
conspiracy.  They had witnesses who claimed that I was a member of or-
ganizations and had supported organizations which they claimed to be
 
conspiratorial.  1Ither the committee should indict these witnesses
 
for perjury or should indict no for perjury, or else the committee it-
self is lying, and the question is not one of conspiracy but heresy.
 
The fact that neither Congressman Welter or Judge Murphy
 
questioned this statement (
'quoted in the above paragraph -
- B.H.)
 
to me exposes the fact that they know they are not really investiga-
ting conspiracy.  They have got to be put on the spot and forced t
o
 
admit this basic fraud.  In Am
erica one does not have the right to
 
conspire to overthrow the government by force a
 vl.lenoe without
 
getting thrown in jail for it.  But  meriea has been proud that you
 
have a perfect legal right to believe in heresy of whatever form y
.
 
want as long as this does not include any overt not which m uld be il-
l
egal*  These guys have simply got to be pinned down and made to prove
 
what overt acts that are illegal have been c
ommitted.  Congressman
 
Walter has a perfectly good right to proclaim his belief that certain
 
ideas are harmful to America, but he has absolutely no r
ight to go un-
challenged with his claim that these beliefs are illegal and c

and sometimes downright malicious, set forth here is the
 
story of my hassle with the government, which has now led
 
to my being indicted for contempt of Congress.
 
P
. Seeger,
 
Beacon, N
.Y.
 
March 30, 1957
 
1) In August, 1955,
 Reprcscatatives Walter (
ii. Pa.) Scherer (R. Ohio) and
 
Wi
llis (D. La.) -
 the "House Committee On Un-American Activities" questioned
 
me for over an hour in New York, trying to establish a connection with the
 
left-wing movement in the Caited
. Ssate3.
 
y reply, if I can rer
'eiiber my  exact words, was: "I ha
 
ne
 ver done anything,
 
supported any cause, nor sung any song either conspiratorial or conducive to
 
conspiracy, and
. I resent the implication, in being called befor  this committee,
 
that because some of my opinions may be different than yours, that I am any less
 
of an American.  You have a right to your opinions, and I have a right to mine."
 
Rereading the statement, it sounds awfully self-righteous, but I
'll stick by
 
it.  Some will say it was foolishly pigheaded, but I said that they were asking
 
the kind of questions that no American should be asked.
 
2) So at the tail end of that session of Congiess, in the summer of '6, I was
 
formally cited by the House, for contempt of Congress, along with Arthur Ni
ller,
 
the pla rri ht, Dr. Otto Nathan, (Einstein's friend) and the executor of his
 
w
ill) and half a dozen others, a
LL], of whom had quoted the First Amendment as
 
the basis for their refusal to answer similar questions. (
Ps. -
 my wife felt
 
quite complimented, in a way -
 to be in the same class with Marilyn Monroe).
 
The difference between quoting the 5th Amendment or the First is roughly
 
this:  The fifth means "you have no right to ask me this question" -
 and the
 
Supreme Court has supported this position.  The 1st means "you have no right
 
to  ask anyone this question".  So far the Supreme Court has avoided making a
 
direct i
-ulQuj on the 1st.  Some witnesses have thereby served from three
 
months to a year in jail.  Some have had their cases dismissed by lower courts.
 
Though  I quoted no i
r e
J,  the Firit
 1
ir
o
 '
sc.cm uf  :
euC}1,  press,
 
assembly,") covers me.
 
3) This Friday, March 29, I was arraigned at Foley Square courthouse in New York,
 
by the Federal Department of Justice, and charged with contempt of Congress.
 I
 
pleaded not guilty.
 (
I have very honestly the highest regard for Congress - 
it is the legislative arm of our democracy, and the instrument through which
 
to channel our hopes for the future)
 
Fortunately I was able to raise bail of $1000 and am fre
�
f
o
 e moment to
 
continue to travel and sing.  There will be a hearing
 
 a trial
 
probably within the next three to eight months, and possibly (
some think probably)
 
appeals which can last a couple years or more.  This is what really costs dough.
 
I
've discovered that the average workingman is really at a disadvantage here.
 
Before we are through, Toshi and I will have to raise between three and ten
 
thousand dollars, whether I stay out of jail or not.
 
We have a really wonderful lawyer -
 Paul Ross -
 he used to be i
v
layor
 
LaGuardia's right hand man, a mature, sensible, and humane man.  He's promised
 
to stick by us even though there is no chance of us being able to pay him a
 
normal fee.
 
 
I

4) Well, that's how the situation stands.
 I still feel that I committed no
 
wrong, and that my children will not feel ashamed of me in future years.
 
think that it is significant that the committee did not even question my
 
statement (
see second paragraph, above).  If they felt I really had been a
 
part of some conspiracy, they should have cited me for perjury, not
 
contempt.
 
If only we could transport ourselves, in the mind's eye, to look down
 
like the Gods upon the scene, it might even appear funny, if it were not
 
also tragic that in our country with so many fine traditions of freedom,
 
it is still pos sible to be peri
l
ize1 for opinions.

Moe and his lawyers, and Al Brackrnan representing Alan, their lawyer ,
 
and they divided Leadbelly work up into segments such as pre-Lomax
 
and post-Lomax and so on, and put each song in the proper catagory.
 
As a result of this summit conference, it looks like the Leadbeli L 
situation may eventually be cleared up.  I
'm working on a 12-str n.
 
Guitar Instructor finally, and Martha has given it her blessing w
it , 
the understanding that Al 1rackman will arrange for payments of
 
2
 
royalties on it.
 
Incidentally, Martha is thinking of giving Huddle's guitar
 
to the Brooklyn Museum, and I have additionally suggested that a
t
 
the same time his guitar is given a complete set of his records,
 
pictures of him, and perhaps writings and any other written material
 
could also be given so there would be a fairly complete s
et of data
 
there for future generations is they want t
o study him.
 
The Woody Guthrie situation is much less ironed out.  This i
s
 
also more or less of a three-way argument between Moe Asch and
 
Harold Leventhal, principally, and also Howie Richn4n(and Al Brackman.
 
Moe is furious at other people stepping in and claiming royalties
 
for songs which he first published, and as a matter of fact, often
 
they are transcribed from his records by someone, and then he i
s
 
asked to pay royalties to someone who transcribes it.  The situation
 
I hope will be ironed out in a couple of years but I doubt if it
 
will be done in less than this time.  Frankly, it had better b
e
 
settled soon or else there'll be even more complications when some
 
of the various relatives start suing.  Because one of these days
 
one of these songs is going to make money, not just in hundreds
 
or even thousands of dollars, but in tens of thousands of dollars.
 
And the moment there i
s that amount of money around why suits develop.
 
)
 
At the moment Moe Asch is planning to issue a Woody Guthrie
 
songbook on his own, Howie Rich
" is planning a Woody Guthrie
 
songbook and pay royalties to the Guthrie Trust Fund, and the
 
Guthrie Trust Fund is kind of in the middle of it all.  Harold
 
Leventhal, though, is doing as good a job as any one could with the
 
exception that he is in an ambiguous position as a publisher of
 
some of the Woody Guthrie material.  It would be better if he had
 
no financial interest whatsoever in the material, and then what he
 
says as chairman of the Trust Fund would be free of any taint.
 
I find Howie Richn nJ and Al Brackman very easy to get along
 
with as long I
'm sure I know what ground I
'm standing on.  It's
 
taken me a few years to find out this ground, but now that I do
 
I don't mind working with them at all.  They are perfectly honest
 
people according to their lights -
-  however, their lights are
 
occasionally a different color from ours.
 
All in all, I do believe it might lead to misunderstandings
 
if you tried to embark on these projects without at least one
 
trip to New York City during which time you could have confer-
ences with not only Al Brackman, Harold Leventhal, Moe Asch,
 
and Alan, but could feel out the general temper of New York
 
City as it exists these days.  Why don't you take them up on
 
one of these offers -
-
 at least long enough to get a free ride to
 
New York City and back?  It is probably too late to work on the
 
specific project they asked you about last March, but there will be
 
other projects coming up. Your own taste and good sense in these
 
matters would be invaluable, and I frankly am selfishly hoping
 
that you will be able to work on some of them.
 
Love to all the family,

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS REVERSES SENTENCE AND DI3 I3SE  INDICTMENT
 
AGAINST PETE SEEGER
 
On May 18th,  1962 the United States Court of Appeals,  in a unanimous
 
decision dismissed the indictment and one year sentence against Pete
 
Seeger.
 The hearing before the U.S. Court of Appeals took place on
 
April 9th,  1962 before Justices Swan, Moore and Kaufman.
 Attorney Paul
 
L. Ross argued the appeal for Pete Seeger.
 
The U.S. Court of Appeals found that the indictment i
ssued against Pete
 
Seeger .
..'contained a wholly misleading and incorrect statement of the
 
basis of that authority.
 This not only runs afoul of accepted notions
 
of fair notice, but goes to the very substance of whether or not any
 
crime has been shown.'
 "The Court further rules that the U.S. Govern-
ment indictment was improper"..."an assertion that a prosecution must
 
begin with a fair and accurate accusation involves more than mere tech-
nicality or form.
 It goes to substance.  We are not inclined to dis-
miss lightly claims of constitutional stature.. .
once we embark upon
 
shortcuts by creating a category of the  obviously guilty" whose rights
 
are denied, we run the risk that the circle of the unprotected will
 
grow".
 In a separate opinion Judge Moore wrote '
>1 gain the impression
 
that Seeger felt that he had a particular kind of right of privacy, as-
serted by some in complete disregard of serious Congressional investi-
gations conducted for the welfare of the nation, but that his refusal
 
lacked the elements of criminality.  He did not rely on the Fifth , Amend-
ment but couched his refusals in terms of  improper
? and 'immoral'...
 
However, these answers probably come forth from a (
in my opinion only
 
misguided) personal conception of private rights rather than from a
 
desire to be contemptuous of his country or the sub-committee...
 
For the reasons stated, I do not believe that the Government has sat-
isfied the requirements necessary to sustain the conviction and, hence,
 
I would reverse and dismiss the indictment for insufficiency of proof.

message from Pete:
 
"If it hadn't been for all of you we never could
 
have seen this thru so well.
 So, hurray for us
 
and old Tom Jefferson too "
 
FETE SEEGER
 
May I express my many thanks to all of you who received this Bulletin
 
for the wonderful support you have shown in behalf of Pete over these
 
many years.  The victory for Pete is not only a victory for him but for
 
all of us who are interested in and concerned with Democracy.
 The
 
monies you have sent will take care of the legal expenses involved in
 
fighting this case which dates back to August of 1955 -
 almost seven
 
years.
 The fact that so many people all over America and in other lands
 
pitched in to help Pete win this case, is indeed a testament not only
 
to Pete, but to our love and concern for freedom.
 Thanks to all of you.

been spending the winter with loshi's brother and Iawiiy in San
 
Francisco. He read my short anecdote from the driver of our car
 
in Czechoslovakia, and somehow got the idea that this adventure
 
happened to me, not the driver of the car. It was the story about
 
the
 j mi sleeping on the floor of the farmhouse on the Hungarian
 
frontier, inste d of "t he  3 farmer's daughters.
 
"f
lX X....It is a folk 7r0ce55 of culture integration, it is just
 
like our folk song. It is a little rough
 I think Peter's behavior
 
of sleeping on the floor rolled on a single blanket whiie three
 
tetcherz of human relatiQnshipl waiting to exchan6e the rh'thm of
 
folk music with an instrument wnich well-known all over the world.
 
Why is Peter so fussy about instrument? IXXXX 1
 
"I think peter is victim of this modern civilzation which require
 
such perfection as need whole orchestra to tell feeling and stories
 
of one soul and body. This is Hung rian'e wa  of keep a stranger's
 
body and soul warm and intact with a single instrument which no
 
human can make better.
 
"Of course, it's motives must be for peace. Mr. K's strong speech
 
of co-existence and the peace among mankind could not pro uce better
 
notion than these three girls have tried.
 
"As you know so well that people of the world tr ing to unaerstand
 
true image of Uncle Sam. People in that farmhouse did not speak
 
to Peter next morning when he came down to have such comlrion diet as
 
a mug of milk after refusing three peace loving internationalist's
 
offering.
 
"It is real shame. if I was 30 years younger I would jump up and
 
volunteer mS service for the shake of international peace.
 
"I am giad that Harold is with Peter now. He can guide Peter with
 
Nat
ie and Toshi's advice. I suppose this folk process for the
 
peace is not so simple as one seem to think.
 
"The different background,  th(
-
, existence of claesfeeiings within
 
even socialized nations, and different approach to the world peace.
 
Wel ,  1
. think that the best approach for international peace is the
 
method that Hungaiian farmer tried but failed. Yes,  these Yankees

Warsaw, Poland
 
April 3
, 1964
 
Dear
 
On the wall of a reconstructed church here saw se ething  symbolic of this
 
whole country: the i
.ower half of the traditioual crucified figure was a
 
fragment rescued f
iom the rubble. The upper half was pieced out by a modern
 
sculptor using welded rods.
 
We were taken on a tour of the city yesterday, and couldn't fail to be
 
moved by the devotion it took to rebuild this city. In 1939 it housed
 
1
,300,000. Bombed in the first Nazi inv.sion,  it also saw the Ghetto up-
rising of'43, and uprising of '
45, and when the nazi's retreated they
 
went from house to house setting it on fire. When the liberating Polish
 
and Russian armies entered, only 15% of the buildings were usable, all
 
utilities were destroyed, and the historic old city center was a complete
 
heap of rubble.  Many sug ested that a new capitol of Poland would have to
 
be built elsewnere.
 
But not only did they decide to rebuild it here, but they decided to
 
rebuild the old part, more than a square mile, exactly as it was. Pain-
stakingly studyingXj old photogra hs and etchings, drawing on memories of
 
survivors, every facade and chimney kas put together. Plaques have been
 
put on wails,  reminding of this or tnat fsnous person who lived there
 
in centuries past. In one market square, our guide mentions proudly,  the
 
opera singer Jan Kiepura used to co- ,e and entertain his friends. A famous
 
wine house has slaborete gilt Uecorations all about the windows a
ria doorway
 
Our guide, a little man about my age wno had been with the liberating
 
armies, crossed himself before taking us in a church:  "Every Sunday this
 
is more crowdeu here than a churcf
l in Spain. People came in here to take
 
refuge here during the war. There were a thousand peo :le in here w
ilen the
 
Germans bombea it and set fire to it, killing everyone inside. There were
 
3
5 sisters (nuns) also here, and the Germans said they couid leave, but
 
they said they would say with the people."  Mika and I looked at the
 
soarii g gothic eolumns, and decided it was the most beautiful churches
 
we hr
-
;d seen in all Europe: not so ornate. ihe few pieces of
' sculpture
 
im
 
nd decor
 were saced out, not squeezed togetherin garish profusion as
 
in some churches.
 
After 19  e
-
'r8 there is still a fever of construction going on...ro s
 
and rows of apartment houses in t
he suburbs, and one whole center section
 
is supposed to go up next year. i
tie city is finally back to its prewar
 
population. The tres, nightclubs, cabarets, and all sophisticated city
 
life bustlin6 away.
 
The radio in our taxicab was carryix g some excellent a1XXX Mozart, and I
 
realized 1 had written about the musical life of Europe as though sym-
phonies didn't exist: my own myopia. hut the lobby walls of the concert I
 
hall where I pe form are covered with international posters of the famed
 
Warsaw Philharmonic, and  :
icturea, plaques, and scul:ture elsewhere remind me
 
me that Chopin is  robably the nation's all-time favorite Eon.
 
Howev'r, my conceits have been well-received. ihis time, for an experi-
ment, I am not even trying to use any interpreter. the dean of a local
 
drama sch o1 introduces me, and mentions briefly some of the songs I
 
will sing, and then I
'm on my own. I step out and speak in the language
 
of my listeners the same phrase I have used in every non-English speaking
 
country:  "Good evening friends"(cheers..but I raise a warning finger and
 
speak haltingly)"But..I..am..afraid..I am unable
—to speak in Polish"
 
(
laughter) Then in English:  "I hope the banjo will need no translation."
 
And old 5-
-stringer gallops off.

 April 3
 
I
'm told that from 1% to 40% of my listeners understand some English, and
 
evidently they help translate a bit for their neighbors.  Somehow even songs
 
that have an awful lot of words seem to go over:  woody's Talking Columbia,
 
and Bob Dylan's Hard Rain. And they sing well on Oleanna and Michael Row The
 
Boat. And best of all on Bayeza,  the African song!
 
Afterwards among my dressing room visitors were a couple young men who had
 
attended a summer camp in NY State I once went to, Camp Rising Sun, which
 
every year takes a dozen or more foreign campers. Full of questions, and en-
thusiasm. Ask where we have travelled.  "But how can you know any one country
 
well when you visit it so briefly?"
 
I acknowledge that of course we can't know it well. In a few days, we only
 
get a few first impressions of a few of its many sidCs. "But we do see the
 
contrasts between different countries better than most peo le, I believe. If
 
you are in a room with a yellowish light bulb , your  eyes  don't think of the
 
light as being yellowish. They adjust to it, and it is simply  '
light', not
 
'
yellowish light'. Similarly if you are in a room with a bluish li ht bulb, c
 
a -
inkish light bulb. But if you walk down the hail and peek your head into
 
one room after another, you'll notice L
iiniediately that one room has a yellowi
 
light, another a bluish light, another a pinkish light.
 
"We can also see similarities. In Europe you are conscious of the great
 
differences between different European countries,  but after travelling througi.
 
Asia and Africa we can see the similarities as more important. In both
 
Amsterdam and reconstructed Warsaw 1 have seen houses of 13th Century
 
merchants, with a facade adorned by a sculptured head of a Negro,  indicating
 
that the owners were in the slave trade."
 
Mika and Toshi come back from shopping in a big new supermarket called
 
"Super Sam" .
... with some excellent canned fruit from Albania, and canned
 
oronge juice from China. I warn them that if they gain weight from this
 
food, they'll have to shed the pounds before entering USA again, because
 
they know it is illegal to bring into United States anything made in those
 
countries.
 
To walk down one of the big boulevards here, filled with shops of a dozen
 
foreign countries, makes Warsaw seem in someways more cosmopolitan than
 
New York. Shortages are not obvious, but they do exist. For example, you
 
can tell from my writing paper than I
'm having a hard time locating some
 
onion skin paper which can take five carbons.
 
The streets have many cars in them, of Polish, Russian, and Czech make -
 but
 
in general the streets are not half so crowded of course as US cities. People
 
walk for short distances, and take buses or streetcars for lon er distances.
 
There are increasing numbers of Volkswagons and other foreigh cars, often
 
driven by tourists, of which they expect more this year than ever before.
 
As a matter of fact, my guess is than anything written about tis part of
 
the world would have to be revised within a year's time.

My throat is gradually,  slowly, getting better, and last night's
 
program went OK -
 that is,  they seemed to like it. But from my point
 
of view it was another failure: I failed ut terly, coipletely,  to per-
suade my audience of a few hundred shy slays to oien their mouths wi e
 
enjoy singing with me. Sing, I mean. -Not whisper. I nave not plumbed
 
t

loyallyi( with me, XAX as I try out different kinds of songs. Again,
 
blues and good rocking songs (including Bayeza,  the African song,)

by far the best hands. But they also appreciate Cumberland i

Dear 
z 
;
-
Yesterday we visited Rosaeeya Collective Farm itself,  the place where
 
the song "DzhankoyeM was written. By coinc
.ide ce it had  ire:d. been  :rsn e
 
for us.  1
e drove
 An over the gentl
 rollir
,6 Crimean clam s, down our
 
sLr ieht avenue lined with f1owerin  ch r rj, ap!:le a
i
..d piu
.m trees,  till
. U 
we came to a jII
?OCCI4 ' 
(accent on the second e
.ylla Ue)  id : ar it
 
a cist cement statue of a girl a hlete with a volleyball (such stat.Les
 
are not at al
l unco
on, near &.te8 and entrances).
 
We drove down a smooth dirt road for about five-til es (Rose eya is not
 
along t
he hitf
iva  as I
'd been told) and then turned in at e
. neat village.
 
There wcre
 tr.i ht t
uij ved streets, wit
h  cunc trees  ir.tcU along
 
them
, and l
ittle white or buff houses, with t
ile roofs, or rod s of
 
corx'ug.tea Co  oiti xi. Then ie turn a corner and find )ursel -V
cFS on a
 
bro d  vezie with a .
r nd fc zit in, and at the end of it a neo-Crcek
 
builctng being pt &
ip! We :x1ied ip in front. of an office, and the manager
 
of
' the f.ri came out to greet us: a tall muscul r i
ian in nia 1i tie , who
 
looked exactly iile a sicce eful &iowest'rn farmer. iven in a t
u
.ziness
 
t
nait,  shirt and t
ie, his tanned face and cre aed neck, nna paicr forehead
 
told me his  roiession. A fir  jaw and a shrewd cje. Al;o other, one could
 
see, a  raeticed a
ci inotrator, an ex;-eriericed jzd , of people, cows, 6.-apes,
 
financial affairs and a th,u and otn r details.
 
We sat down
 ith hi' in his ojilce, an  wi t
hin a hJf noir, learn the
 
main outlines. The farm is about half Jewish,  the rest
 ssiane a

expensive, over a dollar each). We eat them in a field beside a little

American resort,  there are no garish advertisements. A few posters for
 
aovies, concerts, or plays. Kiosks sell everything from clothing to bouks
 
and hard and soft drinks, and food, inluding some sausages almost exactly
 
like hot dogs. I hear a faint loudspeaker with some Russian folk song
 
sung by two girls -
 accompanied by a large orchestra -
 and trace the sound
 
to a email record store. The wall racks carry records in four categories:
 
Opera, operetta, symphony, and folk music. Not knowing Russian I am help-
less to explore further, and am once again determined that if I am able to
 
visit this country again, I will know how to speak and reak someminimum

urinking at the next table cheerfully start to get acquainted.  "You.-.A

 Nixon, good! John Foster Dulles, good!...."  Toshi, with the
 
blp of the woman in charge of the counter, who speaks some English, asks,

the sloping paveient near the }rsalin wallS is apace for about 30,00c
 
people to stand. Already the square is filled with ten thousand tro :

on and on they come, all 2 aet the toab of  6nin, the wavia  ai,Liitaries
 
standing on top of it, past the kremlin with its conglomeration of
 
i
cient buildings and towers, past 400 year old
. St. Basil's church,
 
with its onion domes as gaudy as Disneyland, 1
EX flamboyant as the fins
 
on a Chrysler car, past the ancient statues, past the peeling paint on
 
the Victorian GUM department store which runs the whole length of the
 
square, past all the banners and slogans which drape every single
 
building with the exception of gaudy St. Basils and the austere and
 
modest red granite rectangles of Lenin's tomb, past the huge portraits
 
of Marx, Engéls, and Lenin.
 
i
Py eye roves over the slogans.  I
've been  ririg to leara the Orii1ic
 
alphabet and can now deci:her many words. The many slogans: PEACE,tt'
-fm S
 
,  FREEDOM, LABOR, BROTHERHOOD. Glory to the Communist Party. A
 
icture of a man and woman and child,  the man in overalls, all lookin
 
to a glorious industrial prosperity. Another picture of a farm couple,
 
with s
ile ve  o
f wheEt:  "
We will build Comuunisin".
 
Suddenly a voice near me:  "Hey Pete!" and it is a friend I hadn't see n
 
for years. He used to be a communist, but as I had heard, had dropped
 
away gradually from the party,  following the revelations about Stalin's
 
crimes. We used to live n
r e
r
•ch othcr in  ew york.  "How dio  ,
ou
 
et here?" I ask.
 
"Oh, I
'm te chiiig here fur a
 as  pr rt  of a scientilic exchaine
 
rogram." (He is a biologist, &s-
.4--
-r).  "
I heard you were coriing,
 
but couldn't get tickets to your concerts. All sold out. But I saw
 
A
1O8t of your program on TV. Glad you got them singing."
 
It seems his wife and two small children are here with him, and we
 
catch up on family history. Then I pause, and ask something I have
 
never asked of any person:  "Are you still a communist?" He starts, anu
 
looks at me.  "Who are you, the FBI?" Then he grins, and says,  "No
 or
 
rather .
... Yes. I guess I consider myself as much a communist in a way
 
as I ever was. I still think Marx's analysis of history is basically
 
correct. But I guess there are a good many people who call themselves
 
communists whom I would disagree with. But once I was like a soldier
 
in the lines. Everiy,thing was quite simple. The enemy was right in
 
front of you, and were either brave and attacked, or were a coward
 
and ran. Now I
'm more like a guerilla in the hills, doing a lot of
 
dodging, but getting in my licks when I can. Sometimes I wonder how
 
much I
'm accomplishing, but rejoining the army might be difficult,
 
especially when they * XX seem to be split wi ue  in two nOW.
 
"How do you like the country here?"
 
"Oh, we've been tated fine. And the peo ie are just wonueriul.  Very
 
warm, very emotional. And they love children. I never knew any peo le
 
in the world who love children so much. That's why I was so glad you
 
got them singing with you.  They like to sing.  Jut at  big ga hering
 
people are supposed to keep still and listen.
 
"Yes, it was slow going. But eventually they dia
 well. The singln
 
was especially good in the Ukraine."
 
"I haven't been down there. But where I am I know how shy they are.
 
And a funny thing. W
e have been here 1X (X '
nine months, and h
rve never
 
once been invited to someone's house for d
'innEr."

oe folk music on its honie territory failed, however. We did contact bone
 
fine fo1klori t8 at the music coiservator , who said they would try to

they were now living in P
ioacow. Again, we had to v

holidays were over (everyone was very solicitous of their religious feelin ji)
 
ney were ch r ing. Seven stout old people with crinkling merry eyes, and

costumes: the full sleeves, and the rich embroidery. We filmed them in front

It was the real thing. One voice st:rted off, ot: i

sat around in the fields while their parents were working. Then when they
 
ot old enough to work, they did so, End on the way ho. e they joined in

t
he  fc iteeture does not look so drab. I realize also that I have nev r

lived here 1 would be a mexnberof the Clean Air League, putting p
