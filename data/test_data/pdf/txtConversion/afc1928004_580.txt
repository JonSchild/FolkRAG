OLD POMPEY'S GETTING BAREFOOTa 
ON THE TOP OF HIS READ

The wool was growing longer and Pompey 
getting stronger, 
Before that morn of sunshine when massa set him free; 
He used to sing with pleasure, and play the 
songs we'd treasure, 
When we were all so happy before the jubilee. 
At breakdown and at party, old Pomp was 
hale and hearty. 
And none could dance so nicely, the colored 
maidens said; 
But time has brought him sadness, and gone 
is all his gladness. 
Old Pompey's gettin' barefoot on the top of his head! 
Cm:rims. 
The wool no more is growing. and Pompey's 
heart is knowing, 
Those joys he fondly cherished in bygone days have fled; 
The past he will remember, tho' bleak is chill December. 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
All day he worked for massa, and at night would 
court some lassie. 
Beneath magnolia blossoms that gleamed so fair 
and white. 
Or play the banjo sweetly, while darkies danc'd 
so fleetly. 
Wheit fell the southern moonbeans in floods 
of mellow light; 
But those fond ties are broken, and gone each 
tender token, 
That made his heart so happy, ere bliss of life had fled, 
Now days of joy are over, for maiden and for lover, 
. 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
The cabin too, is lonely, for cats and owls live only 
'Where Pompey once was happy before they set him free; 
The honey-suckle clambers above his silent chambers, 
But no kind hand has trained them since 
dawned the jubilee. 
'Neath southern suns the brightest, old 
Ponipey's heart beat lightest, 
And sweeter was the fragrance these blooming roses shed 
But now he wanders lonely with dreams to 
cheer him only. 
Old Pompey's gettin' barefoot on the top of his head. 
THE WOOD VENDER, 
AN OLD MAN BONG. 
IS SUNG BY FRANK WIC 
I have just come out to see you, and tell you who I 
am; 
I 
am growing old and feeble, you can see; 
My name is Reuben Johnson, I 
came from old Caroline, 
Where the sugar cane is sweet as sweet can be, 
Since the war things they have changed—that 
you know as well as me, 
But I 
thought I'd let you know it in my song— 
And my good old wife and I 
am located in this town; 
I'm selling kindling-wood to get along. 
CHORUS. 
If you want to help the old man, just buy a 
load of wood— 
I'll try my best to please you in my song; 
Just buy a 
load and try, you will find it am dry— 
I'm selling kindling wood to get along. 
They passed the civil rights bill to try and heal 
the wounds 
That caused this poor old man's hair to turn gray, 
When they took him from his home, where 
he used to love to roam, 
With old massa, in the cotton fields to stray. 
Yes, I'd rather love to be down in the good old south, 
Where all the darkies do belong. 
For I 
was better off by far, down there before the war, 
Than selling kindling wood to get along. 
Chorus. 
The time it soon will come when you no longer hear, 
The voice of poor old Reuben Johnson cry: 
Though I 
may pass away, you will think of me 
some day-
- Then I'll be a 
colored angel in the sky. 
I 
know the blessed Lord won't no objections make, 
To a 
black man as long as he does right; 
For when I 
goes into dat land, and joins His holy band, 
I 
know right well He's gwine to turn me white. 
Chorus.

8. Pauline Lieder. 
I'se climbin' up de golden step, 
With Flossie by my side; 
And when the wagon comes alon' 
We're gwine to take a 
ride. 
We shook de dust from off our feet, 
Our robes am neat and clean, 
And in de good old chariot 
In lub we will be seen. 
Chords--Drive up dem hosses to our door, 
And take us out to ride; 
I'se gwine to be so happy, Clem! 
With Flossie by my side. 
We'll take a 
bite ob corn-cake, Floss, 
And lib, you sing a 
song, 
While waiting for that lazy_ Clem, 
To bring dem bosses 'long, 
Then we will drive our fiery steeds, 
Far o'er the beaten track! 
And if de steps of gold am down, 
We nebber will come back! 
Dar's Pompey, wid the bare-foot head, 
Thinks he will win the race, 
But I 
can see a 
look ob fear, 
Upon that Darkie's face! 
He better not begin a 
row, 
For Snow- ball is no lamb, 
But with his true lub by his side, 
He's meek as any clam! 
Whip up dem hosses faster, Clem ! 
Say, nigger do you hear ? 
I'se gwine to reach de journey's end, 
For Pouapey's team draws near. 
Jes' stir dem up a 
little more, 
And do not treble slow,— 
I'll give three cents to win this race,— 
Oh! let dem hosses go! 
'Pears thar is stree'fing in the way, 
The track am narrow grown 
And night is dark as Egypt, too! 
Stop, Clem ! I'se all alone. 
Turn back de good old chariot, 
And let dem bosses 
wuff three cents to get home safe! 
Old Pomp may win and die!

Chorus, 
I 
used to run on de ribber, 
In de year of seventy-three, 
And sawed wood for de kitchen 
Of de steamer Robert Lee. 
Some nigs war tapping whiskey 
On de quiet whar I 
stood, 
And when I 
told, de cook remarked; 
"Jest you keep a-sawing wood." 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
ba'r it in mind, 
It's a 
motto you'll find, 
'Twill serve you a 
deal of good; 
For when you see a 
man 
Spill anoder man's can, 
"Jest you keep a-sawing wood." 
Well, gemmen, dat's de wisest t'ing 
Pat ebber wag said to me, 
For I 
was soon promoted by 
De'cap'n of de Robert Lee. 
De roustabouts got to like me, 
And helped me when dey could; 
For, no matter what dem niggers did„ 
" 
I 
jest kept a-sawing wood." 
Oh I 
tattling is an awful thing, 
And scandal's a 
heap sight worse; 
Jest see how folks get all broke up 
By its biting venomous curse. 
When I 
hear de sarpint coming round, 
To scandal and intrude, 
I 
jest clap both hands to my ears, 
And go on a-sawing wood.

BY 3. D. NEPPARD.

Fae been trabblin' night an' day to dat land so far away. 
liVhar de yaller corn and sugar cane do grow; 
Oh! how happy I 
would be if de ole home I 
could see, 
And listen to de music of de ole banjo. 
'Twas dar dat I 
was born, an' did work from early morn 
Till de stars began to gadder in de sky; 
Oh what consolation for to reach de ole plantation, 
An' see de old home once afore I 
die. 
CHORUS. 
I'll keep trablin' on, (sym)—yes, keep trablin on, (sym) 
An' hopes for to git dar by and bye; 
Oh! what great consolation to reach de ole plantation. 
An' see de ole home once afore I 
die. 
Dem was happy days for me, afore dey set me free, 
An' I 
left my home and friends far behind; 
bar was good old Amity Chico, an' de missus 
and Mama Joe, 
Who to dis ole darkey were foreber kind. 
Dar was all de gals and boys full ob fun an' noise, 
bat used to gadder round de ole man's door; 
Dey'd play de ole banjo, an shake de heel and toe, 
But I 
spec's day's all gwine to dat happy shore. 
Chorus. 
Still I'll totter right along, dough my limbs ain't 
very strong 
An' my hair am turning white like de snow; 
For I 
want once more to see my home in Tennessee, 
Dat spot I 
left so many years ago. 
Oft in my dreams I 
bear de voices of those so dear, 
An' dey tell me dat de happy day am nigh; 
Den I 
journey on de road, nebber weary wid my load. 
For I 
want to see de ole home 'fore I

One Misses McGovern kept whiskey to sell, 
Wich came from a 
sthill she secreted quite well; 
The Gaugers went round but they could find no clew 
To barrel or shtill where such whiskey she drew. 
One day a 
new Gauger was put on that beat, 
Who came to the widdy with smiles kind and sweet; 
For love of us all, Mrs. McGovern, plaze fill 
This bottle wid whiskey right fresh from the satin I

cow, and a 
pig, and no sthill! 
Plaze Misses McGovern don't sind me away, 
My child is just kilt with the fayver to-day; 
The docther says there is no virtue in pills, 
But whiskey is foine for the like of such ills, 
You know just a 
drap of the craythure is good 
To break up the fayver that burns in the blood. 
Thin Misses McGovern, make haste, now, I 
say, 
And Len me a 
Sup of good whiskey to-day,

WRITTEN AND SUNG BY PRANK WM. 
We all have our shares of ups and downs 
In every rank and station; 
We are sure to get more kicks and frowns, 
If we depend on kind relations. 
It's all very well once or twice to drop in, 
And ask for a 
lit.le in favor, 
But if by chance you go a 
third time, 
They'll construe it to your bad behavior 
CHORUS. 
SO 
my advice take one and all, 
In every rank and station, 
And if you want a 
favor done, 
Don't go to your relations. - 
I 
speak from experience, and some you'll find 
How often they'll invite you, 
But when poverty comes close behind, 
They will soon begin to slight you. 
It's clear away, there's a 
knock at the door, 
Don't open the door too wide John, 
I'm afraid it's that hungry brother of mine, 
Say I'm gone out for a 
ride, John. 
Chorus. 
I 
thought my sister would prove a 
friend, 
But soon she did deceive me, 
She said these times were not times to lend, 
She would if she could relieve me, 
A 
trifle sister, would keep me afloat. 
I 
shall sink if you don't arrange it. 
She said she'd no less than a 
five dollar note, 
And she hadn't time to change it. Chorus. 
I 
lost my goods but found that day, 
Though against me they had sinned all; 
Death called a 
rich old friend of mine, 
Who left me a 
handsome wind-fall. 
But how they altered what they said, 
Their ways were so provoking, 
To hear them say as they hung their heads, 
Why Frank we were only joking. Chorus. 
There is none in this world so blessed as I, 
With so many kind relations, 
I 
am invited to breakfast, dinner, and tea, 
I've a 
hundred invitations. 
I 
refuse them all though my heart it burns, 
Their friendship I 
don't heed it, 
.For I 
hate the cold heart that in poverty spurns, 
And only gives to those that don't need it.

Och! lads, when poor Andy was dying, 
The hand ov us all he would take, 
And said, will you whist wid your crying, 
'Till called down to Gerity's wake! 
Me NViddy will furnish the whiskey, 
And superintind the nate job; 
Her sister will get gay and frisky, 
And drink to me health wid a 
sob. 
CHORUS. 
So there may be whiskey in plenty; 
Much trouble me widdy will take, 
When I'm wid the dozen or twinty 
Made happy at Gerity's wake. 
I 
never could rade in the papers, 
But spell like a 
pig on the wing; 
And divil a 
one in his capers, 
Can bate Andy whin he would sing. 
And now I 
must sleep wid the many 
Who turn up their toes, and can't shake, 
And when I 
am dry, can't drink any 
Good whiskey at Gerity's wake. 
Chorus. 
Alta 
Old Finnegin's wake was so jolly, 
A-barring the ructions that night, 
But some of the byes thought it folly, 
To go home widout a 
frae fight. 
And so they wint in for the whiskey, 
To plaza the poor widdy so lone, 
And divil a 
wan but was frisky, 
A-waking the corpse cold as stone! 
That night whin his soul had departed, 
And Keeners were howling so wild, 
The widdy, so lone, broken-hearted, 
Was drinking their health like a 
child. 
The corpse was rolled up like a 
mummy, 
And divil a 
word could it spake! 
Och ! sure it alone was the dummy, 
That night, at poor Gerity's wake! 
Chorus. 
Ov course there was plenty of whiskey, 
And divil a 
farthing to pay; 
The dear mon we tried to make frisky, 
But never a 
word would he say! 
And faith! may I 
niver be shriven, 
If I 
in the morning could shak 
The hand of that lone widdy given 
To those down at Gerity's wake!

Last. winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reilv did you say, 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it. for ha man 'a the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only 11a911 sat behind the will, 
here's Inv old man MeGniness didn t 
get no job at all. 
The politiciatisn pronsi,ed him won klon the I;oulevard,

pick and shovel and throw dirt nit die cart. 
4It! six months ago they promised hint work he'd rhorey get 
Lut believe me, my good woman, they are promising him yet. 
CHORUS 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Ray aid d. Wt./ice way to the blues, 
You and I

As for me I'm done crying, no more will I 
sieli or sob, 
I'll wait till Unica get better, when McGuinness gets a 
jab. 
The Italians, divil take them, why didn't they stay at home, 
Shure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in summer time and sworn tor to stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty 0, His a day, 
They work upon the railroad they shovel snow and Jihad', 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they 
never do get lush, 
No, they always bring th. ir money home, taste no gin or wine, 
And that one thing 1.'d like to say of your old man and mine. 
Chorus. 
Alt ! the spring time now is corning will all have plenty work, 
McGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
handsome clerk. 
You would see him clinibthe ladder as nimble as a 
fox. 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three cornered box. 
The boss is elways bawling. Iii! there. don I. you stop. 
Keep your eyee.kurned upward, don't let no mortar drop, 
A.h ! the old man lie is alwa%a careful, nothing he lets fall, 
The divil a

One day in the street, I 
just happened to meet, 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old .man was sad tho' to meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke filled with tears. 
I 
said, John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief? 
To me your misfortunes unfold; 
Said he, in poor me, you a 
sample may see, 
Of how a 
man gets served when he's old. 
CHOBIIS. 
Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say, that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
When young I 
was praised, and my wages was raised, 
No labor then I 
ever did shirk; 
And my master would then point me out to the men, 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak, 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make fun of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you'ae old. 
Chorus. 
My wife poor soul she is nearly seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know; 
If I 
beg, I 
intrude, and by police are pursued, 
And if to the Commissioners of Charities we go, 
To seek for relief they but add to our grief, 
You must go to the Island we are told, 
Part husband from wife, to be paupers for life, 
That s 
how you get served when you're old.

I 
once did know a 
farmer, 
And he was a 
faithful soul, 
lie used to work upon his farm 
Around his country home. 
He had an only daughter, 
And to win her I 
did try, 
And when I 
asked her to be mine, 
The old man did reply. 
CHORUS. 
Treat my daughter kindly, 
And say you'll do no harm, 
And when I 
die 
I'll leave you both, 
My little stock and farm; 
My horse, ray cow, my sheep, my plow, 
My home, my pump, my barn, 
And all the little chickens in the garden. 
I 
loved this young dearly, 
And I 
thought that she loved me. 
And every evening I 
would go, 
Her lovely face to see. 
And watch her milk her father's cow, 
In it I 
saw no harm, 
And lots of fun I'd always have, 
Before I'd left the barn. 
Her father has consented, 
And we two will married be; 
We'll own our little country home, 
And live in harmony. 
No sorrow seems to hover o'er 
Our little cottage home, 
For all is blithe and happiness, 
Although we live alone.

As we walk thro' the streets how oki:en we meet, 
Some poor old man who's life is naught but woe; 
With age his form is bent, in his pockets not a 
cent, 
And for shelter he knows not where to go. 
With relations by the score who drive him from the door, 
And meet him on the street they pass him by, 
If you ask him why it's done, he will answer 
you and say, 
I 
am poor and old and only in the way. 
CHORUS. 
So let us cheer them on, they won't be with us long, 
Don't let us sneer because they're old and gray; 
And remember while we are young the days to 
us may come, 
When we'll be old and only in the way. 
There was a 
time I 
hear when the young were 
not so queer, 
But since that time there's came an awful change, 
Young men in health and might, their old 
parents they will strike, 
It happens every day, it's nothing strange. 
When he his bread can't earn, his children do 
him spurn, 
For death I 
am sure he oftentimes does pray, 
Himself and faithful wife after toiling all their life, 
When old they find they're only in the way. 
Cho. 
My little song I'm sure is for rich as well as poor, 
For take a 
rich man when he's growing old, 
His friends will shake his hand, his relations 
round him stand, 
Awaiting for him to die they want his gold. 
Then let us from this hour, do all that's in our power, 
To make the road for the old folks light and gay, 
And if they trouble on us cast, why let us be the last, 
To say when old that they are only in the way.

Bright and early each morn to his work he does go, 
Toils with a

Stout-hearted he trudges along thro' the rain and snow, 
For he knows what it is to be penniless and pour. 
Chorus. 
And there's n 
poor widow who lives in a 
garret, 
Who goes out poor thing to wash and scrub all the week, 
With her email basket she visits the market. - 
To buy food cheap for the little ones she lov*s. 
She toils early and late to make up the month's rent, 
So the landlord will not turn her out of the door. 
For that is what he'd do if she owed him one Cent.

THE TRAMP. 
BECTTED BY FRAliK 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe, 
Don't you commence your cusin,' I 
ain't done 
nothin' to you; 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we 
ain't no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, tht'ngh 
folks don't think that we should.. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty 
of cash and clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled, and gin got into my nose, 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'n—and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from 
near and far, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'ern suited her, 
There was a 
city stranger, young handsome, and tall, 
Dam him —I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall, 
He was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know 
a 
young gal's will, 
Well it's the same old story—common enough you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away, 
More than a 
month or after, we heard from the 
poor young thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring, 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her 
mothers side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever, she fell at my 
feet and died, 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother 
began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when 
I 
took to drink, 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes 
till Judgement Day, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRANK LIIM. 
Old scenes take me back to the old pine wooded track, 
And I 
see old massa's face once more; 
And my dear old wife Once the mainstay of my life, 
Waiting for me at the old log cabin door. 
Yes, memries of the past, old friends you've 
woke at last, 
I 
am broken down and cannot long remain, 
So cheer me if you can, till I 
reach that better land, 
And this old man will never more complain. 
CHORUS. 
Then comfort I 
will take, my heart it cannot break, 
My voice with yours old comrades I 
will blend. 
My sorrows are most o'er they are knocking at the door, 
And this banjo now is my only friend. 
Oh! what is that I 
hear, 'tis the angels drawing near, 
They are singing at the old cabin door, • 
Old massa, too, is there, and my missus kind and fair, 
And the little ones that are dead and gone before. 
I 
cannot see to read, I 
am helpless uow indeed, 
My troubles they will surely soon be o'er, 
Although I'm broken down they have made for me 
a 
crown, 
And they're waiting for me on the far off distant shore. 
Chorus. 
SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GUS WILLIAMS. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughttr and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray,' 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery street. 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
" 
I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother—you understand! 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she said, 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak. 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " Somebody's mother's" prayer was heard.

Now since I 
appear here before you once more, 
I'll endeavor to gain your fair smile, . 
Tho' years now have Passed since I 
left the old shore, 
I 
still cling to the dear native isle. 
And I'll sing of Did Ireland, the land of my birth, 
I 
will sing of the great men that's been, 
Whose deeds of renown shall shine round each heart 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
CHORUS. 
Then here's to the sons of old Et 
Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green, 
On sea, or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To the great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell you know, as all history does show, 
Was a 
statesman; whose equal was few, 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet the martyr, he fought for our cause, 
Like a 
laurel his name it keeps green, 
He died for his country and Liberty's laws, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
And then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield, 
The foeman would quake, aye, and tremble and shake, 
When his war horse would enter the field; 
And then as for poets there is no land I'm sure, 
Where such brilliant genius has been, 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Tom Moore, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
But though those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone, 
We have men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a 
parliament wish of their own; 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May tkey harbor no rancor or spleen, 
But when honor demands them they valiantly fight. 
Like the great men that Ireland has seen.

Oh! love it is such a 
very funny thing, 
It catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
For many's the man's been sold. 
It will make you feel like a 
fresh-water eel, 
It will cause your heart for to swell, 
You may love your wife as you do your life, 
lint 'twill empty your pocket-book as well. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You will find when you're wed, they'll bang 
you till you're dead, 
With the bawld-headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man's in love with a 
pretty little girl, 
He talks as gentle as a 
dove, 
lie calls her his honey, and he spends lots of money, 
For to show her he's solid in love. 
When his money's all gone, and his clothes up 
the spout, 
He will find the old saying true, 
That a 
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, 
What the deuce is a 
fellow going to do. 
With a 
wife and fourteen half-starved kids, 
And tell you it ain't no fun, 
When the butcher comes around to collect his bills, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrelled gun. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You'll think you are in clover, till the honey-
moon is over, 
And then you will wish you were dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
With a 
wife with a 
wart on her nose, 
You will find that love don't run so smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-band clothes, 
When the rents are high the kids will cry, 
Kase they ain't got nothing for to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son to load up the gun, 
For to vaccinate your mother-in-law.

And the boys are getting sober, 
And now rin going to dignify my station, 
When I 
was nominated, faith all the gang I

I 
believe I 
paid for nearly all creation ; 
I 
made 'em all feel flaky, wid illigent mild whiekey, 
The result of course, was just as I

The boys took my advice. 
And they mostly voted twice, 
And that a

They s- d 
I'd be defeated, 
But my plans were 
compleated, 
So I 
ordered wine for the ass ,, ciation, 
They said it was the plan to run tire for Alderman, 
Because of my superior education, 
I 
commenced my demonstrations, 
By daling out pantions, 
And soon all toy arrangements were effected, 
For as cunning as a 
fox, we stuffed the ballot box, 
And that's the reason why I 
was elected.

CHICAGO IN SLICES. 
SUNG BY FRANZ LII/if. 
I 
have been to the north and been to the south, 
In traveling a 
man may a-far go, 
To the jumping off place before you will find 
A 
city to compare with Chicago. 
If you never have altered your name in your life, 
Or never did up to a 
bar go, 
Or never run away with another man's wife, 
They won't let you live in Chicago. 
Some folks send by Adams express, 
And others put faith in old Fargo; 
But if you wan't to go to the devil direct, 
Just enter yourself for Chicago. 
The city with fast gals and gay gamboliers, 
Is as full as a 
ship with a 
Cargo, 
And it's truthfully said that the very best men. 
Fight chickens and dogs in Chicago. 
The infants they feed on whiskey direct, 
And for liquor they to their ma's go; 
And the muly cows give, as some might expect, 
Whiskey punch in the town of Chicago, 
They won't let the ministers live in the town, 
For on him they will put an embargo, 
Unless he drinks wine with all his young friends,. 
And then he may stay in Chicago. 
The men they play at faro and poker, 
And the most of them to tho war did go; 
And they sang that good song of the bonnie blue flag. 
All night in the streets of Chicago. 
Some might say their morals are bad, 
Or that they too far below par do go, 
But the devil a 
moral the folks ever had, 
Who live in the town of Chicago.

LAKE SHORE ON SUNDAY NIGHT, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRANS RUM. 
I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
Go yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh! don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chorus. 
11 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and mac, 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chorus. 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love song. 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night. 
Chorus.

Good evening, kind friends, I'll sing yeti a ditty,' 
- It's of dear old Ireland the sweet land of song, 
I 
will sing you of heroes, of men iron- hearted, 
Of brave ones, and of true ones, to Ireland belong, 
For the day we are longing when we'll see Erin free, 
And all sore of Ireland strike for liberty, 
For starved and oppressed. they're stricken with awe, 
They're driven from Ireland, and Erin g) Bragh. 
CHORUS. 
Then farewell to Ireland, the place I 
was born in, 
Farewell to Erin, the fairest of earth, 
Farewell till liberty on us is dawning, 
Farewell to Ireland the land of icy birth. 
The sweet girls of Erin are hopeful yet weeping, 
They're singing for freedom which to them belong. 
And the heroes of Ireland whose name I 
will mention, 
Whose fame in Irish hisery is insrked very strong. 
There was Daniel O'Connell a 
well known hero bold, 
And brave Robert Emmett, we're always been told, 
They fought for old Ireland were true to the core. 
They , oved that dear shamrock and Erin go Bragh.

THE DYING MINSTREL, 
COMPOSED AND REe 
MACK, 
Copyright 1831 by Mrs. Pala:AR:um. 
The curtain is up on the last act brother, 
I'm dying, I 
feel it here; 
We've had many a 
jaunt together, dear boy, 
But my next jaunt will be on a 
bier. 
Do you remember the night we opened in York, 
'Tis twelve years now or more; 
It was then I 
first saw her angel face, 
Since then my poor heart has grown sore. 
The overture passed off nightly, 
And our jokes were spicy and new, 
But I 
stuck that night in my end song, 
For her eyes seemed to pierce me through; 
I 
was not in the after piece, so when I'd finished 
I 
washed up and went out in front, 
(my dances 
To see if I 
could again catch that glance, 
Well it was the same old story; 
You've been there I 
know it, dear boy, 
But you were accepted and happy, 
While I 
was forbidden that joy. 
A father, in the case " I 
should say so," 
He called me a 
worthless adventurer, 
Said his daughter was high in the world, 
I 
only a 
poor nigger singer with unknown connectional 
Well, perhaps he was right, brother, 
But God will not make that distinctiou, 
I 
might have played the roll of Othello, 
Extolled my virtues and with eloquence won, 
But I 
did not tell that I 
once belonged to the ton. 
Raise the pillow a 
little higher, brother, 
That's better. I 
breath with more ease, 
I'm almost glad death is so near, 
I 
almost welcome disease; 
Shakespeare says the whole world's a 
stage, 
I 
hope I've played my part well. 
The exit is near, the curtain is falling, 
I 
hear the prompters last bell, 
Only a 
nigger minstrel, 
Oh! how the words grate on my ear; 
Will the angels say them, too, and— 
For my sins not drop one tear; 
No, I'm sure they will not, 
I 
feel it here in•my heart; 
I 
shall there meet my old friends, 
The minstrel boys ne'er again will part.

THE MAN THAT LIVES OVER kw 
11CA LI 
BY WM. HARDMAN. 
Copyright 1881 by Mrs. Pauline Lleder. 
I'm not much at singin' or makin' a 
speech, 
But seeing your faces so gay; 
And being requested I'll do what I 
can 
Before I 
have gone on me way. 
Of where I 
am livin' I'm goin' to speak, 
Or rather a 
neighbor instid; 
Who has the whole house in a 
terrible state, 
The man that lives over me head. 
I'm told that he sings for a 
livin' at night, 
In a 
big free and easy up town, 
To see him come home. I've watched many times, 
But always give up wid a 
frown, 
At three in the morning surrounded by friends, 
As weary I 
roll in me bed, 
He'll stand near the windee and bawl like a 
cow, 
The man that lives over me head. 
Last night the whole house it was filled full 
of smoke, 
'jumped from my bed like a 
deer; 
And found that the tenents were =min' about, 
And raisin' the divil wid fear. 
I 
took matters easy and searched for the fire. 
Along wid a 
friend they call Red, 
And what do you think sure he upset the stove, 
The man that lives over me head. 
he'll take off his boots and he'll give them a 
toss, 
That makes me jump out of me chair; 
He grunts and he snores like a 
pig in his sleep, 
And sober he's never I 
swear. 
Be goes up the stairs like a 
horse wid a 
eart, 
On pisin he ought to be fed; 
Be dances and pounds wid his fist on the floor, 
The man that lives over me head. 
At times in the middle of night he will blow, 
Upon a 
cornet that he plays; 
Till the neighbors awakened will hang 
round the doo4- 
And swear in a 
great many ways. 
The house it well knows when he's home so it does, 
Some day he'll be found lyin' dead, 
There's twenty-five families that owe him a 
grudge, 
The man that lives over me head. 
The neighbors and I 
to the landlord have been, 
He don't seem to mind us at all; 
He says we're excited wid nothin' to fear, 
And takes the whole thing very small, 
If he don't drive that divil from out of the house, 
To give us some comfort instid, 
Some night in his shirt-tail we'll run him a 
block,'

It was just behind the woodshed, 
One glorious summer day; 
Far o'er the hills the sinking sun, 
Pursued its western way. 
And in my lone seclusion, 
Safely removed afar 
From all earth's confusion, 
I 
smoked my first cigar. 
! 
bright the boyish fancies, 
Wrapped in the wreaths of blue, 
My eyes grew dim my head was light, 
The woodshed round me flew, 
Dark night closed in around me, 
Rayless without a 
star, 
Grim death I 
thought I 
had found, 
When I 
smoked my first cigar. 
I 
heard my fathers smothered laugh, 
It seemed so strange and far; 
I 
knew he knew, I 
knew he knew, 
I'd smoked my first cigar.

Oh! shust look at me now,

And de ladies mid de shentlemen, 
In me dey do confide, dey do con/ide. 
Und ven de strangers come to town,

Upon de road dey shtop, 
Und de ladies got so fraid, 
Dat de shentlemen's leave em behind, behind, 
De shentlemen's leave em behind  
CHORUS.

Und ven ye reach de mountain top,

Und yen de travelers most tired out,

I 
heard of a 
preacher who once made a 
remark, 
Saying actors never could, 
Get in at the gate of heaven, 
Or do anything that was good. 
Now I 
think he was wrong in saying these words, 
For I 
know two or three of the boys, 
Who done good things in their life-time, 
And never made any noise. 
Now there was a 
man called Big Billy Devere, 
H3 sat up day and night, 
To nurse poor Stevy Rogers when sick, 
While others turned tail in affright. 
And Whittaker, lately hurt in New York, 
Had many to come to his aid; 
And a 
number of others, I 
could name if I 
choose, 
Who are now in the church-yard laid. 
One day lately, I 
went across town, 
To an actor that I 
know; 
He lived in a 
tenement house up town, 
A 
place called Poverty Row. 
Times had been hard with him lately, 
Harder than ever before; 
So I 
thought I 
would go and give him a 
lift 
From my own rather humble store. 
I 
knocked at his door, no answer came. 
I 
listened all was still; 
And over my whole being 
There crept a 
death-like chill; 
I 
called for help, the neighbors came, 
We busted in the door. 
And found the object of our search 
Lying dead upon the floor. 
He had died of a 
broken weary heart, 
0! God, can such things really be, 
In this great heaving, throbbing world, 
And no one near to see. 
Yes, there is One, my friends, 
Who notes the sparrows fall, 
Whose loving eyes are ever on 
The Sinner, Saint, and all. 
A 
postal card beside him lay, 
I 
stooped and picked it up; 
It told the sad, sad story, 
How grief had over-run his cup, 
Por on one side I 
plainly read 
The actors home and name, 
While on the other, were the words, 
No Opening, write again. 
Be had went away and left us, 
Gone to a 
happier home; 
Gone to Him who bade us all, 
Suffer little ones to come, 
Gone to that bright and happy land, 
Where there's no sorrow care or pain; 
To a 
manager who never said, 
No Opening, write again.

We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving. 
Has gone in the pathwhy to harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
CHORUS. 
It's sad to be aced and feeble, 
And know that this life has no charms, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
flow painful to mortgage the farm. 
We thought John would be our proteetioo, 
For he was so kind when a 
boy; 
And liettley an gentle aed loving, 
Would call him a mother's fond joy. 
But he was led off by companions. 
In ways that bring evil and harm ; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's hard to he h,veless and childlems, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair has grown aged and whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
tt it It none to protect tis from harm; 
We only can suffer in P 
Pence, 
Or tearfully mortgage the farm

There's a 
happy little cot down in southern Tennessee, 
Where the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and green in my memory it will be, 
Enough I 
know I'll never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget the old home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung, 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
CHORUS. 
Now the tambo and the bones, am forever laid away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung; 
But I 
often heave a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days had come, I 
would 
husk the yellow corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
&nd before they made me free I 
had never cause 
to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay; 
And many and many a 
time when the work of 
day was over, 
With my melody the old plantation rung, 
And my heart does often long for the happy 
days of yore, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
Now the tambo, tke.

There's a 
man lives in the alley with me, 
He's an Irishman from France; 
He's got a 
dizzy daughter yes, 
That takes in every dance. 
She bleaches her hair just once a 
year, 
She is the reigning belle; 
She ain't to blame, this giddy dame, 
For she's Mulligan's daughter Nell. 
CHORUS. 
She bangs her hair, and her mother besides—. 
A 
blow from her fist would tell; 
At night she will roar and rap at the door, 
Mr. Mulligan's daughter Nell. 
She's mashing a 
feller named Tommy Flynn, 
He's one of the gang, you bet; 
He's in our alley most every night, 
A- whistling for his pet. 
Re whistles Baby Mine and Nancy Lee, 
His name he couldn't spell; 
While puffing his cheroot, this gay galoot, 
Is waiting for Mulligan's Nell. 
chorus. 
I 
wish she'd marry this feller named Flynn, 
The alley would be ours once more; 
We'd not hear him serenading then, 
Nor rapping at the tenement door, 
The landlord says, and the tenants also, 
They n'er saw a 
girl like Nell; 
She'd spoil every place where she'd put her face— 
She was aOrays raising—Cain. 
Chorus. 
By Fred J. 2tfackley. 
Sung by Henry Graham. 
If you will listen to me some Pieta I 
will mention, 
Cot:cernitog the past and the present strange age, 
And in them. my friends, to von 
relate 
Some thing I saw one night and played on the stags. 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
atr.11. they seem, I 
quite amazed, 
Winn we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was pla)ed on the stage. 
The first scene I 
paw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging. she quiet old in age, 
Those sad means , lie tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's hook a 
page ; 
But a 
policeman passed h., hii face seemed in smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But Una only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
He'd murdered a 
man by the people respected. 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad, 
To see that. wan punished for the crime he committed, 
The jury look, d 
stern, and the judge i a 
rage, 
And they hung that rich man f 
r 
the murder of risk, 
But. it waa only the way it waJ played on the stage. 
Its the next. scene I 
saw a 
e'ergyman from Brooklyn. 
Who was dancing- a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rap, 
Another one f 
um Jersey wit-i playing the vio 
The audience in front with wonderment gnzed. 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine aermon on the morals of the age, 
and I 
thought, that that they practiced each 
sermon they preaehed. 
But it was only the wey it wee played dit the stage.

I 
like honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear; 
Yet, 'tis better to know you're prepared for the worst, 
Than tremble like children with fear. 
CHoRTJS„ 
I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels, 
I 
can fight with the lion that roars in ray face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none; 
Hard words may be.used, but I 
like him the most, 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong I 
can cure the foul slander ot once, 
And destroy every venomous part; 
Yet I 
reel, when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
Chorus. 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can't do him no good, do him no harm; 
if you don't like backbiting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A 
good open field for the race, 
And if you have cause of complaint 'gainst a 
man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face. -

Oh! why was I 
so soon forgotten, 
When to me such fond vows were made, 
Like the rays of sunlight she did promise 
On me to cast love's only shade; 
But, alas! my sorrowed heart is weeping. 
In this dreary world I'm left alone, 
She who promised that she'd ne'er forget me, 
Now claims another as her own. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! why was I 
so soon forgotten, 
In anguish my poor heart aches with pain, 
Tho' she's gone from me, and now's another's, 
Still in heaven, mine, she'll be again. 
Since childhood it has been my fortune, 
To always find my fondest hopes decay, 
I 
ne'er met with any hope or treasure, 
But it would fade and pass away. 
Tho' twas hard to hear that she had wronged ms, 
Still my lot in lift I 
firmly knew, 
When '
twas told me I 
had been forgotten, 
I 
cried, she too, has been untrue.

Little empty cradle, treasured now with Cars, 
Though thy precious burden now has fled; 
How we miss the locks of curly golden hair, 
Peeping from the tiny snow-white bed. 
When the dimpled cheeks and little laughing ere, 
From the rumpled pillow shone, 
Then I 
gazed with gladness, now I 
look and sigif 
Empty is the cradle, baby's gone.

Baby left her cradle for the golden shore, 
O'er the silvery water she has flown, 
Gone to join the angels, peaceful evermore; 
Empty is the cradle, baby's gone. 
Near a 
shady valley stands a 
grassy mound, 
Underneath my little darling sleeps; 
Blossoms sweet, and roses cluster all around, 
Overhead the willow silent weeps. 
There I 
laid my loved one in the long ago, 
And ray heart does sadly moan, 
Though she's with the angels, still I 
fain would weep, 
Empty is the cradle, baby's gone.
