get insane, can't tell Mary from Jane, you dress up quite 
spruce, go the whole hog, little boys flog, and then into

DEAD BEAT. 
AS 
sung by the FISEEMAN SISTERS. 
BANJO DUET. 
NOW 
kind friends, we'll sing of the chaps 
That you all know, that is perhaps; 
You somethnes meet them on the streets, 
I 
mean the fellows you call dead beats. 
CHORUS. 
For talk is cheap and money buys land, 
Now watch the pauper's eye. 
They dress so neat and look so fine, 
They are always around about lunch time; 
They always drink but never treat, 
I 
mean those fellows they call dead beats. 
For talk, &c. 
Their collars are turned when out they walk. 
Their stockings are whitened with chalk; 
They cheat the bootblacks on the street, 
And as I 
pass they holler dead beat. 
For talk, &c. 
Now when we go to take a 
drink, 
They are always first to take the, wink, 
Its sometimes whiskey, and sometimes Mc., 
And they've always got a 
lunch routo for sale. 
For talk, 10. 
Not kind. friends, I've bid you adieu, 
Another night I'll sing to you; 
But if you meet us on the street, 
Don't say the Freemans are Dead Beat& 
For talk, &c.

FREEMAN SISTERS MEDLEY. 
As sung by the FitchNierr SISTERS with great success. 
BEAUTIFUL girl of Kildare, 
Pm dreaming sweet one of thee, 
Far o'er the sea we must part, 
It makes me sad, oh it breaks my heart, 
But be of good cheer and I'll see thee again 
Where naught will disturb our hearts, cause us pain; 
Then we'll be happy and free-from all care, 
My beauty, my beautiful girl of Kildare, 
My beauty, my beautiful girl of Kildare. 
My gal, my gal, I've:come for to see, 
For I've nothing better for to do, 
I've come to see my Chloe dear, 
For to drive away the blues; 
My Chloe dear is a 
mighty fine gal, 
And I'm gwine for to marry her right soon; 
And we'll all be merry and have a 
fine dance, 
By the light of the silvery moon, 
We'll dance, we'll sing and we'll shout till the 
Breaking of the morn; 
We'll all go to work in the cotton field, 
Till the sound of the dinner horn, 
Once he was as gay as a 
jolly young cocksparrow 
That perched upon an apple tree or down among the corn, 
But now clean through his heart; 
You can drive a 
large wheelbarrow, 
His love has left a 
hole in it, 
Where has Rosana gone? 
Oh, he'll never kiss his love again behind the kitchen door, 
He'll never squeeze nis darling's little finger any more, 
He'll never pinch her arm and cheek until it is quite sore, 
Oh, where nas Rosana gone? 
Adam and Eve went up a 
tree, 
We are all surrounded, 
Their lamb and master for to see, 
We are all surrounded. 
Eve stole an apple off that tree, 
We 
are all surrounded. 
Adam was stung by a 
bumble bee 
We are all surrounded. 
Carry the news, carry the news to Mary. 
Carry the news, we're all surrounded, 
Carry the news, carry the news to Mary, 
Carry the news, were all surrounded.

THE ANIMALS' FAIR. 
The rammer( Stsrzus' version, as sung by them with great success 
throughout the Country, 
BANJO DUET. 
I 
SUPPOSE you've all had dreams, 
Scme strange and very curious, 
At least we've been there ourselves, 
The last it was most furious; 
We dreamed we were two eagles bold, 
Called the king birds of the air, 
Together with all the birds and beasts 
Assembled at a 
Fair. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas at the animals' fair 
All birds and beasts were there; 
The big baboon, by the light of the moon, 
Was combing his auburn hair; 
The monkey he got drunk, 
Stepped on the elephant's trunk, 
The elephant sneezed and fell on his knees, 
Oh! how was that for the monk, monk, monk! 
The donkey and the cow, 
And a 
great big dog called Gypsy, 
Got drinking soap-sud smash, 
And soon became quite tipsy; 
The ring-tailed ape and crocodile, 
Two such jolly fellows, 
The black snake kissed the turtle dove, 
Which made the pigeon jealous. 
• 
A 
fight then soon began 
'Twixt the cat and the black and tan, 
The cat got bit and fell in a 
fit, 
And died like a 
bold Soldier man; 
The monkey then came up, 
And challenged that ere pup, 
But the pup couldn't see 
Where the fun could be, 
So he quickly threw up the sponge, sponge, sponge. 
After everything was quiet 
The tables th2n were spread, 
They'd butternuts and corn, 
And grated Indian bread. 
They'd cod fish balls made out of mud, 
And brick-dust succotash, 
They had mince:pies made out of flies, 
Red herring, toast and hash. 
CHORUS. 
It soon began to rain, 
The mule went home with the crane, 
The wolf and bear then chased the hare, 
Which caused the bed bug pain; 
The jackal he did cry, 
The spider eloped with the fly; 
The lion and bee they went to sea, 
How is this for high, high, high.

GOING TO THE RACES. -
Character Song with Imitations. Written for and Hung with great 
success by the FREEMAN SISTERS. 
Published by Bulmer 
Weber, St. Louis. 
DASHING up and down the street, 
It's four-in-hand we go; 
Lots of pretty girls we meet, 
They charm a 
fellow so. 
Winking, smiling, full of fun, 
We crack the whip in style— 
If we've lost or if we've won. 
We're happy all the while. 
CHORUS. 
Hi, hi, hi, ge-lang, ge-lang, 
ill, hi, hi, ge-lang, ge-lang, 
Come, pass us, if you dare; 
Going to the races, Oh, 
You'll always find us there. 
Laughing, winking at the men, 
It's full of fun are we, 
Dashing like the wind, and then 
What lots of style vu, see; 
How we charm the nobby swells 
By tossing curls in air 
12 
Jolly happy little belles. 
Oh, don't the people stare. 
Hi, hi, hi, &c. 
Running through the merry crowd, 
When some to pass us try. 
Nags are mighty gay and proud, 
And then so proud am I. 
'Neck and neck' we go along, 
Till soon we whiz ahead, 
Up the hill we go it strong, 
Till " by a 
mile" we " lead." 
Hi hi, hi, Ike, 
Homeward then we take our way, 
Our cheeks are like the rose, 
Merrily we've passed the day, 
As you mar all suppose. 
Nothing half so gay and sweet 
As riding out in style— 
Lots of nobby boys we meet, 
So jolly all the while. 
Hi, hi, hi, b..e.

Alit :— White Cockade. 
SHE— 0, Johnny, what kept you so long ? 
He— Oh, list, I'll tell you in a 
song— 
I'm going to be a 
warrior bold, 
To fight for glory and for gold.

CHORUS. 
SISTERS, by Mr.

'Tis there we gave the foe fair play; 
Come along you butchers out of Spain, 
We've whipped you once and we'll do so again. 
She—Now mind, Johnny, and make the enemy run. 
You look so nice when you shoulder your gun, 
He—If I 
only get behind their backs, 
You bet I'll see them make tracks. 
She—But you must fight them face to face, 
If they fight me they'll have to race, 
For he who tights and runs away 
Will live to fight another day. 
To Bunker's, &c,

simple Irish lad, Oh! 
Here's Paddy, Zee.

PLEASE LET MY BROTHER GO, 
As sung by the Fitzamsx StsTEns with immense t•uccess. 
Words by DEXTER SMITH. 
MY Brother did not mean to steal. 
His conscience told him ' twas not right, 
But we ire very hungry, sir, 
This cold and piercing winter's night, 
No one will give him work to do— 
ne begged all day for bread in vain, 
We nearly starved for food to eat, 
Please let my brother go. 
Let my brother go with me, 
Please let my brother go, 
For he's all I 
have in this world— 
Please let my brother go. 
'Tis many years since father died, 
Our gentle mother we ne'er knew, 
Our uncle turned us from his door, 
Pray what could we children do ? 
We try so hard to live, kind sir, 
Our life is little else save woe, 
16 
We will do right indeed, we will 
Please let my brother go. 
Let my brother, ctc. 
By day we walk the crowded streets, 
Begging so hard for work and bread, 
And when night comes we lay us down, 
With naught but the blue sky o'er head; 
And then I 
ask our father kind, 
To help the orphans here below. 
Oh, he will bless you, gentle sir, 
If you will let my brother go. 
Let my brother. &a.

THE FUNNY PAIR. 
BANJO DUET. 
As snug by the FREEMAN SISTERS with great success. 
OH, here we are a 
very funny pair, 
And of us you had better all beware, 
We can play the banjo and dance and shout, 
And you can bet your bottom dollar, 
That our mothers know we're out, 
What a 
very funny pair are we. 
Oh! what a 
funny little chap is he, 
lie is too smart for me, 
lie went into a 
blacksmith shop 
To get out of the rain, 
He picked up a 
red-hot horse shoe, 
And he laid it down again, 
What a 
smart young chap was he. 
Oh! YOU need not laugh quite so loud, 
Of your smartness you need not be so proud, 
She bought a 
lot of liens, 
And in hot water put their legs, 
To see if she wouldn't make them 
Lay boiled eggs—what a 
smart little girl was she. 
Now you've got yourself into a 
stew, 
I'll tell all the people about you; 
She got married the other day, 
And her husband got tight, 
And he sat up courting her all night, 
What a 
funny old man was he.

YOU'LL MISS ME WHEN I'M GONE. 
Written and composed by Wm. II. DELEHANTY, 
PM growing old and feeble, 
My hair is turning gray, 
My limbs that once were nimble, 
Are stiff and wont obey; 
My voice has lost its sweetness, 
My last sand has most run, 
" 
For goodness,"—not greatness" 
You'llimiss me when I'm gone. 
CHORUS. 
When I'm gone. when I'm gone, 
There's one kind heart will miss me. 
When I'm gone. 
What w1I you do without me, 
When winter time comes on, 
Who'll fold their arms about thee, 
As I 
have often done ; 1 
Our children now are married, 
And we are left alone, 
But when I'm dead and buried, 
You'll miss me when I'm gone. 
CHORUS. 
When I'm gone, when I'm gone. 
My dear old wife, you'll miss me, 
When I'm gone.

THE RIDDLE SONG. 
Words and Music by GEO. W ARE. 
I 
SING to you a 
riddle song, although there's little doubt. 
Before I 
get half through it, you'll be sure to find it out; 
But then there is no harm in that, so to pass the time away 
I 
will commence my song at once, so listen to my lay. 
You will find it in the meadow, but never in the grass, 
You'll find it in the woman, bat never in the lass. 
You'll always find it in malt but never in the beer, 
It comes twice in every moment, but not once in a 
year. 
So listen to my riddle song, & c. 
'Tis found in every workman, but never in his work. 
You'll always find it in the ham, though it's never found in 
pork; 
You'll always find it in the ram, though never in the sheep, 
Though it's always found in mutton, it's never found in beef. 
So listen, &c, 
You'll find it in the mastiff, though it's never in a 
dog, 
You'll always find it in a 
mist, but never in a 
fog; 
'Tis found in every female, but never in a 
girl, 
'Tis found in every nobleman, but never in an earl. 
So listen, &c. 
You'll find it in the mother, though its never in the wife. 
You'll find it in the moving, though it's never found in life; 
You'll always find it in your mouth, but never in your taste, 
'Tis the centre of a 
woman, though never near lier waist. 
So listen, & c. 
It's never in husband, or in the wife, but yet, 
twice in. every married man, of that I'll make a 
bet-
21 
It's never found in water, but found in every stream, 
You'll never find it out in sleep, but always in a 
dream. 
So listen, &c. 
'Tis the first thing seen in Mosn ,perhaps this is something 
new, 
'Tis the last thing seen in Abraham, though it's never in a 
Jew. 
Nor is it hi the Gentile, the Christian or pagan, 
It's twice found in Mahomedans, and once in every man. 
So listen, &c. 
You can't find it in the silver—you can't find it in the gold. 
You can find it with your Bank notes, these facts I 
now unfold; 
You'll never find it in the Bank, although it may seem funny, 
You'll always find it in the mint, and find it out in money, 
So listen, &c. 
'Tis twice found in the human man. am) now to make you 
stare, 
I 
really can't be human, for you'll find it's not in Ware; 
And yet you see the thing in me, though I 
never can in you, 
Yet in all mankind you find it, ' tis singular but true. 
So listen, &c. 
'k 
And now I'll finish up my song, for what I've sung about, 
It was the simple letter " M," if you've not found it out. 
And if I 
have amused you with my little stratagem. 
Some other night ' twill me delight, to sing of letter M. 
So now you heard my Riddle Song, I've not the slightest doubt 
Before I'd sang a 
dozen lines you all had found it out. 
So listen, & c, 
THE moon is out to night, love, 
The sky is bright and clear. 
My heart beats with delight, love, 
In hopes to meet you here; 
For we shall then meander, 
Happy through the grove, 
And while the moonbeams linger, 
We'll softly whisper love; 
There, my little sweetheart, 
I 
will something say, 
That will prove I 
love you 
More and more each day; 
Then, I 
know you'll kiss me, 
Pretty Ida Vane, 
Just one little kiss, love, 
Until we meet again. 
CHORUS. 
The moon is out to-night, love, 
And all the land is bright, 
Oh! come and take a 
ramble 
In its silver light; 
Give me one sweet kiss, love, 
Just one kiss to keep, 
Then I 
will dream you came, love, 
And kissed me in my sleep. 
Oh come, my little clew drop, 
My pretty primrose fair, 
23 
My little bunch of roses, 
My gem or jewel rare; 
There's nothing I 
could name, love, 
That's half so fair as thee, 
And there is naught in life, love. 
That's half so dear to me; 
So do not keep me waiting— 
Hoping all in vain, 
Oh! come and smile upon me, 
My pretty Ida Vane; 
Oh! grant this one request love, 
'Twill give my heart delight, 
And you need only stay, love, 
To kiss and bid good-night. 
The moon, ctc.

MY LOVE IS LIKE A 
BIRD, 
MY love is like a7bird, 
With plunrage bright and fair, 
Her voice is like a 
chord 
Of music in the air; 
She's here:and then she's there, 
She comes but will not stay, 
And when I 
think she's near, 
I 
find she's far away. 
C 
IIORCS. 
First she'll please me, 
Then she'll tease me, 
Then she'll say some loving word, 
Singing, smiling—winning, wiling, 
Flitting here and there— 
My love is like a 
bird. 
All in the summer time 
When flowers are blooming gay, 
And merry birds do chime 
Their sweet notes all the day; 
We wander through the dell, 
Or in the shady grove, 
And when my love I 
tell— 
She only laughs at love. 
First she'll, &c. 
My love is like a 
bird. 
For in the winter' time 
Her voice is never heard 
About this chilly clime; 
But to a 
dearer spot 
She flies away to rest, 
Her home is in my heart, 
That's where she built her nest. 
First she'll, &c.

And up and down the whole creation,

Still longing for de old plantation, 
And for de old folks at home.

Oh ! darkeys, how my heart grows weary, 
Far from de old folks at home.

Many de songs I

Oh! take me to my kind old madder, 
Dere let me live and die. 
All de world am sad and dreary, &c. 
One little hut among de bushes, 
One dat I

Still sadly to my memory rushes, 
No matter where I

THE SWEETEST OF THEM ALL. 
Words and Music by Wm. H. DELKHANTY. 
OH! I 
knew a 
little maiden, 
By the name of Bessie Doon, 
And by invitation now I'm going to call, 
For My heart with love is laden, 
Since we met this afternoon, 
When she blushing said—she loved me best of all; 
And she looked just as charming 
As the flowers in May, 
Or a 
peach ripe ready for to fall, 
Then I 
couldn't see the harm in 
Giving her my heart to- day, 
For I 
really think she's sweetest of them all. 
Then I 
couldn't, &c. 
Oh! I 
was one of them who thought 
That love was all a 
myth, 
So I 
never gave it any heed at all, 
But Cupid's quiver struck my heart, 
And left me standing with 
The knowledge that in love I 
then did fall; 
And I 
felt just as happy 
As a 
big sunflower, 
Nodding in the breezes high and tall, 
Then I 
saw entrancing beauty, 
27 
And I 
felt its tender power, 
For I 
love Miss Bessy Doon best of all. 
Then I 
saw, &c., 
Now I 
can no longer linger, 
For my time is growing short, 
But I 
hoPe to see you all some day again; 
And if Bessy is a 
singer, 
Just to have a 
little sport, 
Why I'll bring her here to sing a 
sad 'refrain; 
'Twill be a 
farewell, 
To the nobby little chaps 
That dance in attendance to her call, 
So good-bye to every belle, 
For I'll marry soon perhaps, 
Miss Bessy Doon the sweetest of them all. 
So gOord-be,

JERSEY SAM. 
OH! I 
was born in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans; 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
ittt I'm Jersey Sam, the Farmer's Man, 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah I 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago, 
For I 
am one, ae. 
When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
But now, when they are twelve years old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call for rum and beer, 
And smoke cigars heigh-ho! 
What would our parents have thought of that 
Some Fifty Years ago ? 
For I 
am one, Xe. 
At midnight, too, one hears young men, 
With husky voices sing, 
That" Champagne Charlie" is their name, 
And they know it's no such thing; 
They go to bed with a 
head-ache, 
At least they tell us so, 
I 
never heard of such a 
thing, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, (Fie. 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw a 
line, 
But wear our hats and jackets, 
And appear 4uite masculine; 
They wear false hair, for it's the style, 
And call it their own; you know— 
But our girls would scorn to wear a 
wig, 
gome Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one,

When I 
was only ten years old, I've beard my Mother 
say, 
When I 
was quite a 
baby I'd such a 
taking way; 
When I 
was only twelve years old, a 
queer complaint 
I 
had, 
They called it kleptomania, and I 
had it very bad. 
The old folks tried their best this ere complaint to cure, 
But no, 'twas all in vain, break out ' twas certain sure, 
But picking oakum cured me: lor' I 
did'nt feel the same, 
So I 
turned my pretty talents to a 
different sort of 
game. 
Chorus.—I 
can do a 
little shuffle, &c. 
I 
can't stand those guns what does the prigging line, 
A 
man wat isn't honest, he's not a 
pal o' mine, 
For I 
once went on a 
visit to that crib at Holloway, 
I 
didn't like the treatment, so found it did'nt pay; 
So now I 
goes to races, I'm known at all the fairs; 
I 
does the country yokels, before they is a,wares, 
The fakement with the three cards brings the mopesses 
about, 
My coveys I 
find honesty the best of games what's out.

OH! NIOODEMUS. 
My 
lover he's going to sea, Oh! Nicodemtts, 
He's ping away and leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes, swimming in the sea ; 
Bat he'll soon wish for home, and to be back with me, 
The ship will heave to, Nicodemus! 
And so wretched you will be, so wretched you will be. 
Clloars. 
(Spoken.) So she said— 
Oh. Nicodemus ! Nicodemus! don't you go away? 
I've loved you Nicodemus and I've loved you many a 
day, 
I've loved you in your plain attire, your lovely fustian c04. 
Don, t 
leave me Nicodemus, for that boiler-bursting boat. 
(SPozus.) And again she began te sing— 
Salt water, you know, is very wet, Oh, Nicodemus I 
You know you arc my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret; 
They will feed yon on salt junk and nasty soft boiled peas, 
Think of this well: Nicodenaus! 
Ere yoa cross those watery seas, those windy watery seas; 
*So she said, Ica. 
And she also said— 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, Oh, Nicodemus I 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't nut away there's no back door 
fit 
31 
Reef the anchor, Nicodemus, the Captain he will say, 
You'll have to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany Bay ; 
So she said, fr..e. 
This is what he said— 
It's no use you talking tome; said Nicodemus ? 
For I 
intend agoing out to sea, 
Out to China for Souchong and Lingo Tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo. in fkiet you can't get a 
better, 
Direct from Hong Kong, Australia, 
When you send to me a 
letter, you send to me a 
letter. 
And she began again yelping, 
Oh, Niooderous, &e.

Out in this cold world, out in the street, 
Asking a 
penny of each one I 
meet, 
Shoeless I 
wander about thro' the day, 
Wearing my young life in sorrow away4 
No onr! to help me, no one to love, 
No one to laity me, none to caress, 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam, 
A 
child of misfortune, I'm driven from home. 
Chorus: No one to help me, no one to bless, 
No one to pity me, none to caress. 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam, 
Nursed by my poverty, driven from horn. 
The flowers that bloomed that I 
loved to see, 
Seem bowing their heads as if pitying rne, 
The music that mingles with voices of mirth, 
From the windows of pleasure and plenty on earths 
Makes me think what it is to be friendless and noorf 
An 1 
I 
feel I 
shall faint when I 
knock at the door, 
Turn a 
deaf car, there's no one will come, 
To help a 
poor wanderer driven from home. 
Oh, where shall I 
go or what can I 
do, 
I've no one to tell me what course to pursue, 
I'm weary and footsore, I'm hungry and weak, 
I 
know net what shelter to-night I 
may seek, 
The fciena of all friends, who rules earth and sea, 
Will look with a 
pitying eye upon me, 
I'll wande: about 'till his messenger comes, 
To lead me to my father and mother at home.

THE HURDY GURDY LAD. 
I 
DON'T feel very happy, nor I 
don't feel very sad, 
So put me down as middling, although it is too bad; 
For any girl to serve a 
chap, as lately I've been served, 
But no girl shall take me in again, I'll never take their word, 
A 
girl I 
courted for six months, her Christian name was 
Fanny, 
I 
asked her if she'd have me, and she said she would be 
glad; 
But at present her intention was to stay home with her 
mammy, 
And she could't think of parting with her dear old darling 
dad. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, she said 'twould break her heart 
To go and leave her mammy, 
She said twould break her heart, 
To go and leave her dad ; 
But she's run away from both, 
My false, deceitful Fanny, 
And travels about the country, 
With a 
Hurdy Gurdy Lad. 
Now Fanny wasn't handsome, but I 
thought she was sin. 
cere, 
And then she had such winning ways, that made me her 
revere, • 
But a 
hurdy-gurdy grinder, he used to come our way, 
And for Fanny's recreation, for hours he used to play; 
He'd play awhile, then dance a 
bit, gud then he'd sing a 
ditty, 
A 
37 
And I 
often gave a 
penny to: the dirty half-grown man, 
He said he was an orphan, that caus'd me him to pity, „. 2 
But I 
never thought he'd cheek enough to run away with 
Fan. 
And as for her, she said, &c. 
Her father and mother were very fond of me, 
And often did invite me my Fanny for to see, 
I 
found her father ' bacca, and I 
found her mother rum, 
And on Fanny I 
invested a 
very tidy sum, 
For Fanny was a 
girl I 
always thought so well of; 
When I 
think how she served me, it my piece of mind de-
stroys, 
Now of Old Mother Cummings I'd often heard tell of, 
But I 
never thought she'd run off with the biggest of her 
boys. 
For she said, &c. 
Now when her father told me that Fan had cut her stic k 
I 
felt as if I 
had received a 
blow with half a 
brick, 
For I 
always thought that Fanny, a 
little more pride had, 
Than to travel about the country with a 
hurdy-gurdy lad. 
I 
hear she's got a 
tambourine, and a 
voice that's loud and 
ringing. 
And often in m_ wanderings, I 
fancy I 
shalfmeet, 
This hurdy-gurdy grinder, and Fanny doing the singing, 
Giving a 
morning concert to some childrenin- the street. 
For she said, &c.

THAT'S THE WAY THE STORY GOES. 
Sang by JEN-ism Exam.. 
THERE was a 
Young Woman her name was Fan, that's the 
way the story goes, 
She fell in love with a 
man named Dan, that's the ‘vay th

Now Dan loved Fan and Fan loved Dan, as true as a woma> 
loves a 
man, 
And Dan he owned a

"I'd like to get married," says Dan to Fan. that's the way

Say's Fan, " I 
quite approve of the plan, "— that's the way 
the story goes, 
Th.n raid, " go get your parents' consent," Fan said " she 
would," and away she went 
Looking so fair and innocent, — that's the way the story goes. 
As Fan was going down Nassau Street, that's the way the 
story goes ; 
Another Young Man she chanced to meet, that's the way the 
story goes: 
He looked so shy and winked his eye, to escape his glances 
Fan did try,

The Pie it gained the heart of Fan, that's the way the story

The Rival of Dan was a 
Penny Pieman, that's the way the 
story goes, 
Fan gained her Father's and Mother's consent to get married 
and off with the Rieman went, 
But since that day she's had cause to repent,—that's the way 
the story goes. 
For coming away from Church that day, that's the way the 
story goes, 
A 
German Baud began to play, that's the way the story goes, 
And frightened a 
horse in front of a 
car, knocked down and 
killed the Poor Pieman. 
And made a 
widow of faithless Fan.—that's the way the story 
goes, 
Now broken-hearted about the streets, that's the way the' 
story goes, • 
Faithless Fan her Dan oft meets, that's the way the story 
goes; 
'le heeds her not but passes her by, "all hot Two a

she hears him cry,

Did You Ever See an Oyster Walk Dpstairs. 
Written by F. GILBER1 
I 
LOVE a 
very handsome girl with gleaming golden hair, 
My charmer will not marry me, she daily does declare: 
Upon my knees she asks me to, but in a 
knowing way,— 
She lyly shakes her saucy head, and then to me does say 
4 
CHORUS. 
Did you ever Bee an oyster walk up stairs ? 
Walk up stairs ? walk up stairs? 
Well, when you do, I'll marry you and share your cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
I've got a 
nicely furnished house, a 
few pounds in the bank, 
My friends assure me that I 
am good tempered, gay and frank; 
All this I 
tell my darling, but her love I 
cannot gain, 
She shuts her eyes and then replies in this annoying strain— 
Did you ever, &c. 
Fine satins, silks and laces rich, I 
say that she shall wear. 
If willing but to marry me, to buy them all I 
swear; 
To operas and theatres I 
promise she shall go, 
But still she asks the question, and so slyly wants to know— 
If I 
ever saw, ezo. 
To all the oyster shops in town, I 
sadly wend my way, 
To Billingsgate I 
often go, as well as to Herne Bay; 
In hope to find an oyster that will undertake the task, 
But everybody laughs at me when dolefully I

41 
CHORUS. 
Have you got a 
leetle native that can walk up stairs? 
Walk up-stairs ? 
walk up-stairs ? 
For if you have, she'll marry me and share my cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
This question I 
will make in 
own, and use it when I 
can, 
No matter what the query is, I'll answer every. man; 
For instance, if my landlord calls, demanding ,
six month's rent 
say, "Old boy, you'll get it, if you witness the event.''— 
CHORUS. 
The day an artful oyster walks up stairs ? 
Walks up stairs ? 
walks up stairs ? 
For when you do, 1'11 pay it you, and ease your cares, 
let not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
FAR back in my musings my thoughts have been cast, 
To the cot where the hours of my childhood were passed; 
I 
loved all its rooms, the pantry and hall, 
But that blest old kitchen was dearer than all. 
Its chairs and its table, none brighter could he, 
For nil its surroundings were sacred to me; 
To the nail in the ceiling, the latch on the door, 
And I 
loved every crack in that old kitchen floor. 
:eh sYr 
Oh, the old kitchen floor, the old kitchen floor, 
flow dear to my heart is the old kitChen floor. 
Ir 101i
r 
11-,U 
/ 
remember the fire-place, with mouth high and wide, 
The old-fashioned oven that stoOd by its side, 
Out of which, each Thanksg,iving, came puddings and pies, 
That fairly bewildered and dazzled my eyes; 
And then, too, St. Nicholas slyly and still 
Came down every Christmas our stockings to fill; 
But the clearest memories I've laid up,in store, 
Is the mother that trod on that old kitehen floor 
.0h, the old, dm 
Day in and day out, and from morning till night, 
lier foot-steps were busy, her heart always light, 
43 
For it Named to me then that she knew not a 
care, 
The smile was so gentle her face used to wear; 
I 
remember with pleasure what joy filled our eyes, 
When she told us the stories that children so prize; 
They were new every night though we heard them before 
From her lips at the wheel on the old kitchen floor. 
Oh, the old, Scc, 
To night these old visions come back at their will 
But thewheel and its music forever are still; 
The band is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away, 
And the fingers that turned it lie moldering to clays 
The hearth-stone, so sacred, is just as ' twas then, 
And the voices of children ring out there again; 
The sun through the window looks in as of yore, 
But it sees stranger feet on the old kitchen floor. 
I 
ask not for honor, but this I 
would crave, 
That when the lips speaking are closed in the grave, 
Oh, the old, &i. 
My children will gather their own at their side, 
And tell of their mother who long ago died; 
'Twould be more enduring, far dearer to me, 
Than inscription on marble or granite could be, 
To have them tell often as I 
did of yore, 
Of the mother who trod on the old kitchen floor, , 
Oh, the oldok.

It's Funny when-you Feel that Way. 
The original Copy of this song was given to Johnny Roach by 
George Harris, the great English Comique. 
I 
sha'n't forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself In paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way„ 
A 
Cuorms. 
I 
felt as tho' rd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, its funny when yon feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the nices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as though &c. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own; 
She blushed and said go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you fee) 
that way. 
I 
felt as though 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it,s funny when you f

Now white folks all take our advice, 
And remember what we say,

So we'll tap the banjo and sing de chorus, 
And bitryou all adieu.

AWFULLY CLEVER. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes, 
I've a 
fellah who does'nt like bothah, 
All trouble to him is a 
bore, 
He's an income left him by his mothaw, 
What on earth could a 
fellah want more; 
His favorite sport's killing time, 
His aim's to do nothing at all, 
While some in this world run and climb, 
He takes the trip easy and crawls. 
CHORUS. 
For they tell him he's awfully clevak; 
Oh, so clevah, deuced clevah, 
They say that they nevah, no neTah, 
Met a 
fellah, so clevah before. 
Some fellahs go in for the Army? 
And some fellahs go in for trade, 
But he hasn't such bores to alarm him, 
His fortune was already made. 
And some fellahs go in for brain, 
And scribble to earn an honest penny, 
Those fellahs deserve all their gains, 
As for brains he could do without any. 
In the park he is often seen driving, 
lie thinks he's Alexis, the duke, 
Whenever he goes in for billiards, 
Ile thinks he's a 
hard one to fluke. 
Some times at an evening party, 
To keep us alive in he'll peep, 
Whenever we ask him to sing, 
We are certain to fall fast asleep,

Drunkard's Lone Grttild. 
OUT in this gloomy night sadly I 
roam, 
I've no mother now, no friends, no home, 
Nobody cares for me, no one would cry, 
Even if poor little Bessie should die. 
Barefoot and tired I've wandered all day, 
Asking for work, but I'm too small, they say. 
On the damp ground I 
must now lay ray head, 
sitnel'„ a 
L.
..sr 
und mother is dead. 
CHORUS. 
Mother, why did you leave me alone, 
With no one to love me, no friends and no home. 
Dark is the night, the storm rages wild, 
God pity Bessie, the Drunkard's Lone Child. 
We were so happy till father drank rum, 
Then all our trouble and sorrow begun. 
Mother grew paler and wept every day, 
Baby and I 
were too hungry to play. 
Slowly they faded, and one summer night 
Found their sweet faces all silent and white. 
And with big tears slowly dropping I 
said, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
Oh! if some temp'rance man only could find 
Poor, wretched father and speak very kind, 
If they could stop him from drinking, why then 
I 
should feel very happy again. 
Is it too late ? 
Men of temp'rance, please try, 
CHO.— 
For little Bessie will soon starve and die. 
All the day long I've been begging for bread— 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
48 
Good-Bye, Charlie. 
OH, how I 
envy girls who have 
Their lovers close at home, 
While distance keeps me far from mine, 
Who o'er the seas muct roam; 
Should I 
but see him twice a 
year, 
Contented. I 
must be, 
And hope he'll ne'er forget my words 
When last he went to sea. 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, Charlie, when you are away, 
Write me a 
letter, love; send me a 
letter, 
love, 
Good-bye, Charlie, when you are away 
Do not forget your Nellie, darling ? 
How nice the drive, the game at chess, 
Or moonlight walk must be! 
How nice to have one's love " drop in" 
To take a 
cup of tea! 
How nice to have sweet billet-doux 
Arrive by ev'ry post! 
The whilst poor me can but expect 
Just two a 
year at most. 
Good -bye, Charlie, &a. 
It's hard to see such swarms of swells, 
Who stay at home at ease, 
The while my darling has to sail 
The wide and stormy seas. 
But I 
suppose it would not do 
For all to stay at home, 
And so I 
can but hope my love 
Ero long will cease to roam. 
Good-bye, Olathe, ase.

NOBODY'S 
TREASURE. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
THE snow has been falling and lies white in the street, 
And thro' it are wandering those little bare feet, 
With an old torn dress that tries to enfold 
Her shivering form from the merciless cold, 
She holds out her hand new chill"d with the blast, 
Hoping to find a 
kind word at last; 
But all pass her by, for they all have a 
home, 
Leaving nobody's treasure to wander alone. 
CHORUS. 
Nobody's treasure, nobody's treasure, 
No one will miss her, or speak words of love. 
Nobody's treasure, no one will miss her, or speak words of love. 
Nobody's treasure, Angels bear nobody's treasure above, 
Angels bear nobody's treasure above. 
The storm has been fierce and deserted the street, 
• 
The snow-flakes still fall and are mingled with sleet, 
She sits on a 
doorstep and bitterly cries, 
But warmth is within and no one replies, 
She whispers a 
pray'r she learned on the knee 
Of one who's dead and from sorrow free; 
She's no one to miss her, and no words of love, 
So the angels bear nobody's treasure above. 
Nobody's treasure, Ls. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
MOTHER, Home and Heaven! 
How dear those words to me ! 
The first, she held me to her breast, 
And danced me on her knee ; 
I 
was to her a 
priceless gem, 
: ;_tr 
it-r!rcr p-i(1 fair ; 
And now i 
never can iorget, 
A 
faithful mother's care. 
CHORUS 
Mother, Home and Heaven i 
How dear to think of all ! 
Before the trumpeter descends 
To bid us mind his call, 
Mother, Home and Heaven! 
How sweet to me is home ! 
For there we meet with those we love. 
And do not care to roam; 
We 
have a 
pretty sister's voice, 
To cheer us day by day; 
We 
have a 
little baby bright, 
To watch while he's at play. 
Mother, home, 8sc, 
Mother, Home and Heaven! 
The last we hope to see ! 
Where angels gather ' round the throne, 
And sing a 
joyous glee; 
Oh may we all assemble there, 
And east our sins aside : 
For with the true and righteous ones, 
Our aim is to abide. 
Mother, home, &c,

LITTLE foot-step3, soft and gentle, 
Gliding by our cottage door, 
How I 
love to hear their trample, 
As I 
heard in days of yore I 
Tiny feet that traveled lightly 
Iii this weary world of woe— 
Now silent lie in yonder church-yard, 
'Neath the dismal grave below— 
Little foot-steps soft and gentle, 
Gliding by our cottage door: 
How, I 
love to bear their trample, 
As I 
heard in days of yore! 
Little foot-steps, soft and gentle, - 
Gliding by our cottage door: 
Bow I 
lose to hear their trample, 
As I 
heard in days of yore! 
She sleeps the sleep that knows no waking, 
By the golden river's shore: 
And my heart it yearns with sadness, 
When I 
pass that cottaie door— 
Sweetly now the angels carol 
Tidings from our loved one far, 
That she, 
still does hover o'er us, 
And will be our :pitting star,

Little foot-steps, &c. 
Little foot-steps now will journey 
In the world of sin no more, 
Ne'er they'll press the sand-banks lightly 
By the golden river's shore— 
Mother, weep not: father grieve not: 
Try to smooth your troubles o'er— 
For I'll think of her as sleeping, 
Not as dead, but gone before.

In the world of sin no more, 
Ne'er they'll press the sand-banks lightly

I'VE been waiting for more than an hour, bye, 
Yes, waiting and watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, 
And keep true your promise to me; 
For, you told me you'd meet me this evening, 
And listen to what I've to say— 
For, to speak the plain truth, I 
am certain 
I 
can't tell you all in a 
day.

By the lilies that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lea, 
By the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting, my darling for thee, 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee; 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
rm waiting, my darling, for thee. 
For more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive; 
So surely you'll not break your word, love, 
And leave me your absence to grieve. 
So I'll watch and 
11 wait here still-longer, 
In hope of your coming this way, 
When the dim, misty vail of the twilight 
Has shut out the brightness of day. 
By the Lilies, be.

I'V E 
been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely &fine, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam it's a " poser," 
There's asornething I 
can't understand, 
1 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
Fm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day; 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
'Your gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
1 
am sure you will own Uncle Sam, sir, 
Temptation is hard to resist,,-
Just look at bui poor working girl, sir, 
Striving her best to exist,: 
65 
• 
Can you wonder at weak Constitutions, 
When blood-sucking firms, barely give, 
Enough to keep off destitution, 
A 
girl, though she's poor, she must live. 
There's our poor needle girl, God defend her, 
With feelings as proud and as tender, 
As your proud city lady, remember, 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinning 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch hirn!they say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
Just think while your drinking your wine, sly 
How the poor of our land Croy are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god-send for them to get bread; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer is under. 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And yoU'll.never more wonder at erinv

I 
ONCE had a 
sweethea:1, tho' her name was Brown, 
She was most decidedly green; 
But when you have seen her you'll say she's as nice 
A 
young lady as ever was seen. 
And then she's so funny, she's just like a 
child, 
She loved me, but much better far 
She loved her dear parents, for always she said: 
" 
I 
want to go home to Mamma." 
CHORUS. 
I want to go home to Mamma, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
It's naughty, I 
say, to keep me away, 
When I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
When first I 
beheld her, I 
thought what a 
dear I 
With joy, oh! I 
nearly went wild, 
But when I 
began to boo and to coo, 
Why she sniveled out like a 
child. 
[ 
thought she was ill, I 
couldn't make her out, 
When she jumped up and said, "oh, ta-ta I" 
I 
said, " Pray don't you go," when she simpered out, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
I 
want to go home, ic. 
I 
contrived to persuade hcfr L 
loved her so much, 
That she said she would be my wife. 
We drove to the church, when oh 
what a 
scene. 
She would have the door left ajar; 
When the clergyman said, " Will you wed?" she shrieked out; 
"No ' 
I want to go home to Mamma. 
I 
want to go home, &c. 
At last we were married; oh, my, what ajob I 
To the continent then off we went, 
And I 
am happy to say she her nervousness lost 
When the honeymoon cosy we'd spent. 
And now she's so different to what she once was, 
We're happy by night and by day; 
Her marriage she says she will never regret, 
And no more do I 
hear her say: 
I 
want to home, Scc:

Air--" The Ve1eran. 
'Twas in a 
christian land, 
A 
veteran aclor 
Whose sands of life had near run out 
And soon must pass away: 
I 
fear not death," quoth he, 
"My life has been upright ;" 
A heavenly smile passed o'er his face, 
A 
soul had taken flight, . 
But, alas! he was an actor. 
His friends had gathered 'round, 
Their last respects to pay, 
And one who knew his ehristian heart, 
Now sadly wound his way 
To a 
minister, and begged, 
That he'd read a 
funeral prayer. 
" 
We never pray for Actors, no, 
But, I'll tell you where, 
I • 
c. 
There's a 
little church around the corner.w 
In vain the friends did plead, 
But Sabine would not budge, 
Instead of trying to redeem, 
He fain would be the judge. 
The felon in his cell, 
Or murderer doomed to die, 
Can have a 
sermon read for them 
But not our friend, and why? 
Alas! he was an actor. 
With pity and disgust, _ 
The friends now turn toward 
A shepherd, who protects his flock. 
And lives to serve the Lord. 
The service he performed, 
And prayed for that poor soul, 
The fiends discovered they had found

THAT'S THE CHEESE. 
By B. *D. 
GOODING. 
GOOD-EVENING white folks all, how d'ye do, 
I've concluded to make you a 
call, with de banjo, 
If I 
succeed in pleasing you, 
And I 
my best will try, 
I 
hope you'll say when I 
am through, 
That's the cheese. 
In the war between Prussia and France—ober der, 
Ring William made Louis Nap. dance—also swear, 
They didn't fight about Sweitzer cheese, 
Nor yet was it lager hoer, 
But they quarrelled about the Rhine, 
Not the cheese. 
Now a 
liberty I 
will take, if you please. 
With the people way out at Salt Lake, they're de cheese, 
Brig took a 
new wife and dat caused a 
fuss, 
And Brig then tried to stop it, 
But they all pitched in and walloped poor Brig. 
Bully for them. 
Another verse, then I 
will quit--for to-night, 
And the colored folks next I 
will hit, aint I 
right? 
Some wan't a 
nig for President, 
And Fred Douglass is the man, 
But that is not the sent-i-ment, 
Not wrueh, Mary Ann.

A

tely appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassa street, called "The Little Flirt." We cannot 
sea that we recommend it to our young 
lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad habit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any Zurther neces-
sity of explaining 'how, when and 'where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise and init late the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: . 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher tir 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers.
