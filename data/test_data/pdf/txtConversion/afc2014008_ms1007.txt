 Response to Questions on FY 89 Budge
 
Senator McClure's staff misread some of the
 
awards.
 In case you want to straighten them out, here is the real intormation.
 
In FY 87 and 88 nominations for National Heritage Fellowships totalled 118 and
 
155 respectively.  The increase, we believe, was due in part to a letter we
 
sent to folk arts coordinators across the country expressing our concern
 
about the dearth of nominations from several culturally rich states, partic-
ularly those in the west.
 
The reference to the number of awards for FY 87 and 88 represents an error
 
in reading the charts.  Thirteen National Heritage Fellowships were awarded
 
in 1987; twelve will be awarded in 1988 (
1988 awards will be announced in
 
June).  The 65 and 75 figures actually represent dollars spent, not number
 
of awards, the 65 meaning $65,000 dollars for 13 awards at $5,000 each for
 
FY 1987.  The panel determined when the program was started years ago that
 
they wanted to award approximately 15 fellowships per year, so each year
 
we set aside $75,000 for the purpose in our overall budget.  This is where
 
the 75 figure came from; translated it means $75,000 for 15 awards at
 
$5,000 each.  (At the time the charts were drawn up, we had not yet selected
 
the awardees for FY 88; the panel ha
e
'lected 12 awardees to be honored
 
this year for a total of $60,000.)
 '
t
 
Now, getting down to the question they did ask
 We are already seeing
 
results of our ongoing efforts to expand the program to larger audiences.
 
The Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico has announced
 
that they intend to acquire by purchase one example of each of the National
 
Heritage crafts workers for a planned exhibit next year which will later
 
be taken on a nationwide tour.  The National Geographic is considering a
 
proposal to cover the Fellowships both by an article in their magazine
 
and by a film which would go into their current PBS series.  The award
 
ceremony is already broadcast live and later on Thanksgiving Day by
 
National Public Radio; we hope improved television coverage will occur
 
in the future.

On behalf of the National Endowment for the Arts, which I am
 
priviledged to chair, I should like first of all to thank the distinguished
 
Honorary Committee of Senators and Congressmen who are sponsoring this
 
ceremony and this reception.
 We are grateful for your hospitality and
 
appreciative of your attention and the honor you thereby pay the work we do.
 
We next want to thank the Joseph Martinson Memorial Fund for helping make this
 
reception possible.
 
traditional artists you see before you for their long-standing services to
 
the arts and the nation.  Each one meets the criteria established by the
 
National Heritage Fellowship program.  Each is an authentic practitioner of
 
a traditional art form. Each has created an ongoing record of serious
 
artistic accomplishment that is worthy of national recognition.  Each
 
demonstrates the skillfulness, the economy of line and movement and phrase,
 
the purposeful ease that marks the true master of an art.
 
But each one of these artists stands for more than simply his or
 
her individual accomplishments, notable though they may be.
 Each one
 
represents a group of human beings who through time have poured their
 
creative energies into the invention and development of a particular
 
artistic form -- a unique style of dancing, a special way of singing,
 
a characteristic pattern of visual elements.
 These various artistic
 
languages -- if I may so characterize them -- contend peaceably together
 
- 
-2 -
in our remarkable nation, vying primarily just for our attention,
 
and creating a colorful, continually changing, mosaic across the land
 
that reflects the actual state of our Union.
 
It seems especially appropriate and fitting therefore that
 
these awards be presented in the presence of representatives of the
 
United States Congress and in one of their own meeting rooms, for
 
the Congress too brings together into one body representatives of
 
the many.  Let me introduce you to the artistic representatives of
 
the people of the United States themselves, nominated by their fellow
 
citizens and selected by still other fellow citizens.
 It is with
 
great pride that I present National Heritage Fellowship certificates
 
to the following traditional folk artists:
 
-
-
 from Donna, Texas, a musical composer of sensibility and
 
grace, an important innovator in his tradition, known throughout the
 
southwest as the "Monarch of the Accordion."  For his ongoing contribution
 
to artistic excellence in the art of Mexican-American conjunto music,
 
the National Endowment for the Arts honors -
-
 DON PEDRO AYALA.
 
-
-
 from Palos Park, Illinois, a young man of multiple talents,
 
a flutist as well as a championship dancer who has taken the difficult
 
Irish dance styles to new heights.  For his ongoing contribution to
 
artistic excellence in the art of Irish step-dancing, the National
 
Endowment for the Arts honors -

contributions to artistic excellence in the art of the blues, the
 
National Endowment for the Arts honors -
-
 MR. ALBERT LUANDREW,
 
often known as SUNNYLAND SLIM.
 
-
-
 from Newark, Ohio, a championship contest fiddler whose
 
broad repertory, brilliant technique, and long experience have made him
 
a key figure in the flourishing midwestern fiddle tradition -- For
 
his ongoing contributions to artistic excellence in the American fiddle
 
music traditions,  the National Endowment for the Arts honors -
-
MR. KENNY SIDLE.

-
 MR. CLYDE "KINDY" SPROAT.

In conclusion, we regret to announce that the delicate health of
 
our twelfth honoree, Mrs. Amber Densmore, does not allow her to be
 
with us.  Accepting the certificate on her behalf is Jane Beck,
 
Director of the Vermont Folklife Center.  We hope that Mrs. Beck
 
will take not only the certificate, but the Endowment's best wishes
 
back to Mrs. Densmore.

skills encompass crochet and embroidery as well as the brilliant

Dear Celeste,

A Federal agency advised by t
he
 
National Council on t
he Arts
 
Herewith the infamous document, along with a list of the awardees arranged
 
in the tentative order we plan to have them come on.  There will be a brief
 
intermission after Michael Flatley which you can announce ad lib.
 There
 
are six artists in the first half and six in the second.
 
Several other things you should know.  Frank has not seen the script; he
 
is off in Massachusetts at the moment carrying with him his own part for
 
his own editing.
 I don't know whether he will want to introduce you as
 
I
've written it or not; I simply took what I said there from the standard
 
Endowment biography.
 Please feel free to add or subtract.
 
Another small point:
 last year the script was so abbreviated that the stage
 
hands didn't have time to set up for the next artist and Ruby Dee had to
 
improvise.
 I wrote this script,  therefore,  in a much more wordy fashion.
 
My notion is to mark out potential cuts where you can just skip a sentence
 
or two if you sense matters are dragging.
 (I probably won't get that all
 
done before you see it, though.)
 I have also added a couple of filler
 
paragraphs that can be used if the piano falls into the orchestra pit or
 
some other such dire occurrence.
 
Again, we are so tickled you are coming.
 I think you will have a good
 
time, and I know we will.
 
Yours ever,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

HODSOLL
 Good evening.  My name is Frank Hodsoll.
 I am the Chairman
 
of the National Endowment for the Arts, and I bid you
 
welcome to this, our seventh presentation of the National
 
Heritage Fellowships.
 This is a program of
 
which we are very proud, and as we invite you to settle
 
back to what is always an adventurous as well as an enjoyable
 
evening, we also urge you to reflect a moment upon the
 
remarkable achievements of the traditional folk artists and
 
artisans of the United States.  Each year, working from
 
hundreds of nominations that reach us from every part of the
 
country we can select and present to the American people only
 
a sampling of the folk arts and the folk artists that work and
 
thrive within our amazingly diverse nation.  At the Endowment,
 
we are each year refreshed and invigorated by this reminder
 
of the unstoppable determination of groups of neighbors across
 
our land to identify and celebrate themselves and their own
 
particular history through acts of beauty, humor, and grace.
 
The artists that you see before you work within time-honored
 
aesthetic traditions, but each has brought to the particular
 
art form a special distinction, a particular flair for melody,
 
line or form, a manifest authority over technical difficulty.
 
They have made a personal imprint upon the development of
 
their art.
 It is now my honor and privilege to introduce
 
the twelve artists who have received  National Heritage
 
Fellowships for the year of 1988.
 Each honoree will stand
 
as I read his or her name, and I will ask you now to hold your
 
applause until all have acknowledged their nomination.  The
 
honorees will then leave the stage to go to their seats in the
 
auditorium so that they may enjoy each other's performances,
 
but you will see each one of them again during the course of
 
our concert.
 
DRAFT 9/23/88

The National Endowment for the Arts now presents the National
 
Heritage Fellows for 1988:
 
+  Don Pedro Ayala from the town of Donna, Texas.  Don
 
Pedro is a major composer in the Mexican-American conjunto
  
musical tradition and Monarch of the Accordion.
 
+  Mrs. Kepka Belton from Ellsworth, Kansas, an artist of
 
Czechoslovakian descent who is known throughout the midwest
 
as the "egg lady" for the exceptional beauty of her egg
 
dying and painting techniques.
 
+  Mr. Michael Flatley of  Palos Park, a suburb of Chicago,
 
Illinois.  Mr. Flatley is an accomplished performer on the
 
Irish flute as well as the acknowledged American-born master
 
of the complex  Irish step dance.
 
+
 Sister Rosalia Haberl, a member of the Franciscan Order
 
for over seventy years, now resident of the St. Francis
 
Chapter House in Hankison, North Dakota where she continues
 
to demonstrate her unique mastery of bobbin lace making.
 
+
 John Dee Holeman of Durham, North Carolina where he
 
grew up in the Piedmont tradition of guitar playing, blues
 
singing and, especially, Black step dancing, all of which he
 
will share with us this evening.
 
+  Albert Luandrew, more widely known by his professional
 
nickname of "Sunnyland Slim," a blues man from Chicago whose
 
piano helped set the style of the contemporary urban blues
 
movement.

+  Kenny Sidle, a master fiddler from Newark, Ohio where he
 
has built a legendary reputation as a contest fiddler but
 
who is sought out, as well, by square dance callers from
 
all over the midwest.
 
+  Willie Mae Ford Smith, the legendary teacher and preceptor
 
of modern gospel singing whose voice and musicianship has
 
thrilled listeners from her home town, St. Louis, Missouri,
 
right round the world.
 
+  Clyde Sproat of the small town of Kapaau on the big island
 
of Hawaii, a superb singer who is admired not only for his
 
beautiful voice, but because he is a "keeper" of the
 
extensive traditional repertoire of songs in the Hawaiian
 
language.
 
+  The legendary Doc Watson of Deep Gap, North Carolina whose
 
brilliant guitar work, eloquent voice and consummate musician-
ship have endeared him to international as well as national
 
audiences.
 
+  Madame Yang Fang Nbu, nominated by her former neighbors
 
in Rhode Island,  for her exceptional contribution as a weaver
 
in the Laotian style.  Madame Yang now lives in Michigan
 
where she continues her needlework including embroidery as
 
well as batiking, dying, and weaving on the traditional Lao
 
loom.

 Finally, Mrs. Amber Densmore of Chelsea, Vermont.
 
Mrs. Densmore's frail health has not permitted her to
 
venture to Washington to accept her award.  We will, however,
 
be demonstrating on the screen the elegance and authority
 
of her contributions to traditional needlework, especially
 
quilting.  Her old friend, Jane Beck, director of the Vermont
 
Folklife Center will speak for Mrs. Densmore at that time.
 
We know that everyone here joins with the staff of the
 
National Endowment for the Arts, to wish Mrs. Densmore
 
improved health and vitality and we congratulate her on her
 
achievement.  Ladies and gentlemen -
-
 the National Heritage
 
Fellows for 1988!
 
AWARDEES FILE OFF STAGE
 
Now, my official duties are just about over, and I will soon
 
be able to follow the Heritage awardees back into the
 
audience and settle down to enjoy the evening myself.  But
 
I have one more happy responsibility: the introduction of
 
our mistress of ceremonies for this evening.  At the beginning
 
of my remarks, I told you this was our seventh Heritage concert,
 
and my folkloristic friends tell me that all round the world
 
seven is considered an especially fortunate number.
 Certainly
 
I feel the Endowment is especially fortunate tonight, for
 
joining us to conduct us through the evening is an old friend,
 
not only of the folk arts but of the arts in general.  The
 
distinguished actress, Celeste Holm, has just completed a term
 
of six years service on the National Council for the Arts
 
where she annually reviewed not only all the grants made by
 
our agency but the nominations for the National Heritage
 
HOD SOLL
 
Fellowships as well.
 She knew who the 1988 fellows would be
 
long before they  were announced to the press and the people!
 
Her professional accomplishments as an actress are almost
 
too widely known to need repeating, but let me just refresh
 
your memory.
 She first appeared in William Saroyan's The Time
  
of Your Life. 
She was the original Ado Annie in the legendary
 
musical Oklahoma. 
She received an academy award for her
 
performance in the film, Gentleman's Agreement, and Oscar
 
nominations for her roles in Come to the Stable and All about
  
Eve.
 She has taken an active part in the support of arts
 
organizations, being president of the Creative Arts Rehabilitation
 
Center and vice president of the Arts and Business Council.
 
She has lent her talent, enthusiasm and pocketbook to a variety
 
of ethnic arts institutions especially those reflecting her
 
own Scandinavian background.
 In recognition of her overall
 
services to art and humanity, she was knighted in 1979 by
 
the King of Norway.  We are delighted that she has consented
 
to be with us this evening -
-
 to take us behind the scenes,
 
in a way, to visit with the remarkable artists you have just
 
met, and to help us understand and appreciate their work on
 
a deeper level.  May I now present the eminent actress,
 
Celeste Holm.

Before any time  can pass,  I wanted  to say again how great I
 
think the Heritage Awards program was.  It had excellent direction,
 
a great script,  Kuralt's fine reading and time-tested interview
 
abilities,  intriguing staging,  and,  of  course,  that deep cast of
 
awardees.  It really went to another'level with its dignity,
 
humor,  emotion and performance.  It could clearly run with success
 
on Broadway,  abroad and  .
..  in Peoria.
 
Thanks for your efforts,  they clear ground for the folks  and
 
the folklorists to step into new places in new ways.  I found th��
 
program a perfect example for people at Carnegie Hall and the
 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting who attended.
 
Today is my last official day here at Smithsonian.  Let's get
 
together again soon for lunch and notes.

I have always enjoyed being a folklorist, and I have always enjoyed the company
 
of other folklorists. I
've always felt that folklore was one of the few professions
 
that might actually have a subst
ia1 effect on bridging some of the chasms which
 
have been formed between different ethnic groups in our country. Never were my
 
hopes more rewarded, never have I felt more proud to be a folklorist, than when
 
I attended the recent Heritage Awards concert. You and your people did a
 
tremendous job in every respect; and the recipients were just the sort of
 
people one would hope for as proponents of vernacular culture in our country.
 
It's the closest I
've ever felt to being patriotic.
 
You have brought this program up from some vague ideas a lot of us talked about
 
in past years, and you have made it a reality to be genuinely proud of. I simply
 
want to thank you for all you've done for all of us.
 
Cordially,

Dear Bess:
 
I just wanted to add my voice to what must be a chorus of
 
congratulations on the Heritage Awards.  Great!  Charles Kurault
 
was great,  a perfect choice,  and an ideal format;  I loved the
 
minimalist set,  too,  which seemed to look back to the thirties in
 
one way and in another towards the next century.  All of it--the
 
interviews,  the physical arrangement,  the sequence of events--for
 
me decisively accompl ished the task of presenting the Fellows,
 
their work,  and of doing honor to them.  Lydia and I left in a
 
very elevated state of mind!
 
Thanks again,  too,  for the interview.  Your thoughts have a
 
wonderfully clarifying influence on me,  which will I hope be
 
reflected in the essay I'm about to finish--it will be the
 
introduction to my book on the' FAF.  In all honesty,  Bess,  I don't
 
think anyone has contributed more.
 
Looking forward to seeing you again.
 
Fondly,

Dear Bess:
 
Before  any time  can pass,  I wanted  to  say  again how great  I
 
think the Heritage Awards program was.  It had excellent direction,
 
a great script,  Kuralt's fine reading and time-tested interview
 
abilities,  intriguing staging,  and,  of  course,  that deep cast of
 
awardees.  It really went to another-level with its dignity,
 
humor,  emotion and performance.  It could clearly run with success
 
on Broadway,  abroad and  .
.
.
 in Peoria.
 
Thanks for your efforts,  they clear ground for the folks and
 
the folklorists to step into new places  in new ways.  I found thE
 
program a perfect example for people  at Carnegie Hail and the
 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting who attended.
 
So bravo!
 
Today is my last official day here at Smithsonian.  Let's get
 
together again soon for lunch and notes.
 
Sincerely,
 
Nicholas R.  Spitzer

Thank you.
 We're going to  let these wonder-
ful people go take a little rest now,  but
 
I promise we will get a longer visit with
 
each one of them during the evening.
 
APPLAUSE.
 ARTISTS LEAVE STAGE.
 
I've really been looking forward to this eve-
f
ling.
 My friend,  Roger Welsch from Danne-
borg,  Nebraska has been telling me about the
 
National Heritage Fellowships for several
 
years.
 I've been able to meet a few of the
 
past honorees during some of my trips around
 
the country,  but this  is the first time I've
 
been at the ceremonies themselves.
 It's been
 
interesting to find out how this unique event
 
came about.
 To tell you a little bit about
 
it,  here is the Director of the Folk Arts
 
Program at the National Endowment for the
 
Arts,  Bess Lomax Hawes.
 
-3--
BESS HAWES
 Thank you, Mr.  Kuralt.
 We're awfully glad you
 
could come.
 The National Heritage Fellowships
 
began eight years ago.
 The idea behind them
 
was and is to bring to the American people a
 
yearly sampling of the cultural and artistic
 
richness amongst which they live -
-
 to show
 
them their own neighbors in new and
 
different roles -
-
 not just as the old
 
gentleman that whittles or the lady who
 
sews,  or the people who make the funny
 
music -
-
 and not just as Down-Easterners
 
or Cherokees or loggers either -
-
 but as
 
distinguished artists,  masters of their
 
crafts,  honored by their government,
 
applauded by their country.
 
We learned the basic concept from the
 
Japanese.
 They call their honored
 
traditional artists National Cultural
 
Treasures.
 We call ours National
 
-4-
BH
 Heritage Fellows -
-
 a little bit different,
 
but it's another strong term too.
 Each one
 
of the people Mr. Kuralt introduced was
 
nominated by one or more fellow citizens
 
because of the exquisite quality of the
 
work and because of the significance of the
 
person's particular contribution to the
 
art form.
 Each one learned his art the old-
fashioned way,  growing up in the tradition
 
and absorbing its aesthetic principles by
 
watching,  listening,  sort of breathing it
 
in,  and then practicing it for a lifetime.
 
Each one can properly be described as a
 
master.
 
I have to say,  I think this is wonderful.
 
It delights me every year.
 I am proud to
 
live in a country that officially recognizes
 
these artists,  and I am also proud to work
 
for an agency that practices the broad demo-
-5—
 
BH
 cratic reach that encompasses all the art
 
forms and all the kinds of artists -
-
 and
 
many more -
-
 that you will hear and see
 
tonight.

CHAIR
 Thank you.
 I
'd like to enlarge on a point
 
Bess Hawes just touched upon:  that the
 
Heritage Fellowships are designed to bring
 
to public attention not only these extra-
ordinary artists but the particular art forms
 
they practice.
 Some of these arts rival in
 
longevity the Old World arts of Greece and
 
Rome;  some are bold new inventions born out of
 
the creative clash of peoples newly living
 
side by side in the new world.
 Some of them
 
are known to only a few;  others are common
 
acts practiced by many people;  these become
 
distinctive when particular groups begin to
 
invent and imprint a special identifying style
 
upon the work.
 It then becomes their way,
 
their particular contribution.
 (I._
L
L
 
.  -
 That is
 
why these art forms are of such enormous
 
importance to the group from which they come
 
and to the larger nation as well.
 They
 
-7-
CHAIR
 
remind us all of the many ways there are of
 
being human and of the many ways there are of
 
creating beauty.
 It is thus entirely proper
 
-
-
 indeed essential
 for a  national agency
 
devoted to the arts to recognize and support
 
all the art forms practiced by our many
 
peoples.
 That is why the Endowment supports
 
the work of  its Folk Arts Program and of the
 
National Heritage Fellowships.
 And we not
 
only support it, we rejoice in it,  and each
 
year welcome the citizens of Washington to
 
rejoice in it with us.

Thank you.
 We're going to open our evening
 
with a brilliant and explosive kind of music
 
that came into the United States  relatively
 
recently from Mexico.
 It grew during their
 
own colonial period when Mexicans were busy
 
announcing their independence from the old
 
world just as we had done a bit earlier in
 
the United States.
 Region by region they
 
invented an amazing series of distinctive
 
musical styles such as the mariachi orchestra
 
and the accordion-based conjunto tradition
 
heard today throughout Texas and across the
 
Rio Grande.
 And over on the eastern Mexican
 
seaboard, African and Caribbean musical
 
energies and rhythmic ideas combined with the
 
local Spanish and English musics,  and Jarocho
  
was born.
 
The story of larocho is very like the story
 
-9-
of American blue-grass and other regional
 
traditions we will be hearing this evening.
 
It grew to brilliance in its own area and
 
developed its own homegrown virtuoso musicians
 
some of whom then struck out for the big
 
cities and the big amusement centers to make
 
a name for themselves and their tradition.
 
Jose Gutierrez was one of the enterprising
 
young artists who took jarocho to Mexico City
 
during the 1950's and 60's where its stunning
 
syncopations and limitless energy made it a
 
great hit.
 Later he helped bring it to
 
California,  specifically to Los Angeles where
 
he makes the instruments in his own workshop,
 
organizes the orchestras,  arranges the music,
 
trains the younger musicians,  plays,  sings,
 
and helps accommodate new musicians arriving
 
from Vera Cruz.
 When you hear his music,  you
 
will join me in thanking him for his
 
tremendous gift to his new country.
 Please
 
welcome -

 SENOR JOSE GUITERREZ and his
 
orchestra.

Now we're going to take a quiet bit of time
 
to look at an art that has probably,  in one
 
way or another,  brightened the lives of
 
everyone in this audience.
 Like fiddling,
 
quilting is one of the great commonplaces
 
of American life.
 American Indian ladies
 
quilt,  as do Hawiians and African-Americans
 
and Anglo-Americans.
 Quite a few men quilt
 
too.
 After all,  everybody needs something
 
warm to sleep under,  and you might as well

furniture in most houses,  so what goes on it
 
-
-
 its covering -
-
 takes up a lot of visual
 
room.
 
Hundreds of art books have displayed the
 
hundreds of ways American women have chosen
 
to solve this aesthetic problem,  but our next
 
honoree, Mrs. Mable Murphy of Fulton,  Missouri
 
-11-
has spent her  life at it.
 She herself has
 
made more than 100 completed quilts,  each to
 
a different pattern from a different palette
 
of colors.
 And for as  long as anyone in
 
Fulton can remember,  she has twice a week
 
opened her home to groups of neighbor women
 
who come to piece,  to quilt around a frame,
 
to get advice on artistic and practical
 
problems,  to learn from her gentle inspira-
tion.
 Folk Arts files,  they tell me,  contain
 
more than thirty letters from these women,
 
praising her generosity,  her wisdom and her
 
patience.
 Mrs. Murphy has never sold a quilt.
 
she gives them away to her children and grand-
children and to local charitable institutions
 
to be raffled off as fund-raisers.
 Please
 
welcome -

 MRS. MABEL MURPHY.

 (Some possible questions or comments...)
 
+ Mrs. Murphy, won't you come sit down
 
over here for a little chat?
 
+  Could you tell me a little bit about this
 
quilt,
 or that one?
 
+ You know,  in all the lovely quilts you've
 
made,  are there particular patterns you
 
enjoyed working on the most?
 Maybe ones
 
that were especially tricky?
 Or just came
 
out especially  nice?
 
+  Maybe you have a secret favorite?
 
+  I understand that you yourself created
 
a rainbow quilt pattern?
 Do you like it
 
best maybe or one of the best?
 Did it turn
 
out the way you dreamed it would?
 
+  In the old days I
' m told people used to use
 
-13-
materials  left over from other
 
sewing projects or they would cut up
 
worn-out clothing for pieces.
 But nowadays
 
they can go to the store and just buy what
 
they want.
 Do you like one way better than
 
the other?
 
+  Do you think the art of quilting is going
 
to survive in the future?
 What can we do to
 
help it?
 
Thank you, Mrs. Murphy.

When people immigrant to the United States,
 
they often seem to try to settle back down
 
into a climate and surround that reminds
 
them of the way it was back home.
 The
 
fertile central California valley,  for
 
instance,  has seemed pleasantly hospitable
 
to many peoples from food-growing parts of the
 
old world.
 The dairymen from the Portuguese
 
Canary Islands have settled there along with
 
the small farmers of the Italian Mediterranean
 
and above all the fruit growers of the fertile
 
crescent and the near east.
 
Our next honoree grew up among the farms and
 
vineyards of central California.
 He was a
 
part of the extensive Armenian-American cor
n-
described so joyfully by one of their own
 
great writers, William Saroyan.
 As a child,
 
Richard Hagopian moved in a community where
 
Armenian music and dance were not special
 
-15-
events gotten up for outside display,  but
 
everyday sociable activities that might
 
start up in the kitchen after supper or
 
out doors in the evening cool.
 It was soon
 
noticed by his elders that his artistic
 
interests and capacities were far out of the
 
ordinary.
 By the age of nine,  he was intro-
duced to the rigorous training required of a
 
serious Armenian musician,  learning the rudi-
ments of many instruments before settling to a
 
concentration on the oud, the queen of near-
eastern instruments.
 By the age of 32 he was
 
awarded the supremely honorific title of
 
"Oudi,"  an honor one cannot simply claim for
 
oneself,  but which must be announced by yet
 
another master.
 
I now present,  Oudi RICHARD HAGOPIAN of

 I don't have any idea why,  but it does seem
 
as though almost everybody likes duck decoys.
 
There's something nice and solid and comfort-
able about the way they look and the way they
 
feel when you hold one in your hand.
 And then
 
they're useful besides,  which will satisfy
 
those of you who think art has to be more than
 
just pretty or engaging.
 And finally,
 
although decoys were found in King
 
Tutankhamen's tomb,  decoy carving has
 
actually flourished primarily in the United
 
States.
 Some even call it an indigenous
 
American art,  for the present day tradition
 
so familiar to most of us developed first
 
in the United States and spread back to
 
Europe in later years.
 
Harry V.  Shourds is a third generation duck
 
decoy carver.
 His grandfather was also named
 
Harry V.  Shourds,  and he was possibly the
 
finest decoy carver around Tuckerton,
 
New Jersey during the early 1900's when
 
-17-
New Jersey coastal duck carving was the finest
 
in the world.
 During that time,  famous people
 
including some presidents -
-
 came to New
 
Jersey to hunt,  because the major east coast
 
migrating bird flyway follows the Jersey
 
marshlands,  north and south.
 
Harry Shourds isn't sure how many ducks he has
 
carved during his  lifetime.
 He still carves
 
every day in his studio "The Duck's Nest"  an
 
old barn,  off Route 9.
 His friends -
-
 mostly
 
fishermen and hunters -
-
 often gather there to
 
tell tales and gossip while he carves.
 He
 
himself hunts with his golden retriever every
 
now and then but he says that these days he is
 
becoming more conservation-minded and he hopes
 
the area may someday become a National Wild-
life Refuge.
 And now here is Mr.  HARRY V.
 
SHOURDS,  the duck decoy man of Barnegat Bay...
 
-18-
(Some possible questions or comments...)
 
OK
 +  When I look at one of your decoys,  it
 
certainly looks  like a duck,  but not exactly,
 
if you follow me.
 Have you ever tried to copy
 
a live duck exactly?
 Why not?
 
+  As I understand it,  some decoys are made for
 
display and others for working use.
 What are
 
the differences?
 Would you rather make one
 
kind than the other?
 
+  Can you tell the difference between your
 
ducks and your father's and your grand-
father's?
 Is it sort of a feeling,  or are
 
the details different or maybe the kinds of
 
ducks they made?
 
+  Have you been asked to help any youngsters
 
to learn decoy carving?
 What do you think
 
might help keep this art form alive in your
 
region where at one time it was so important?
 
Thank you Mr.  Shourds.

 During the past day as I have met these
 
remarkable people -
 the 1989 Fellows,  I've
 
been struck with how many of them know and
 
practice more than one art.
 They make and
  
play instruments;  they carve and paint;  they
 
tell tales and sing songs.
 The idea of the
 
Renaissance man -
-
 and woman,  for that matter
 
-
-
 seems alive and active in the folk communi-
ties of our country.
 Perhaps it is out of
 
necessity -
-
 more likely,  I think,  because of
 
of a fuller,  less pinched view of what it
 
means to be an artist.
 
Our next awardee is a Western Apache from the
 
White Mountain area and a member of the Eagle
 
Clan.
 He descends from Amos Gustina,  an
 
important musician of the Apache people whose
 
one and two string fiddles can be found in
 
many museums.
 The Apache fiddle,  as far as
 
current research can tell us,  is very likely
 
the only stringed instrument played by
 
American Indians before European contact.
 
-20-
Chesley Goseyun Wilson,  Mr.  Gustina's grand-
son,  makes and plays the now rare Apache
 
fiddle.
 He is also recognized by tribal
 
members as an authority on the Gaan or
 
Mountain Spirit dance and ceremony of the
 
Apache.
 His concern for the instruction of
 
younger Apaches in the discipline of these
 
art forms is notable.
 Although a successful
 
artist in the larger marketplace  (he is also
 
a working silversmith),  he has  remembered the
 
necessity of reaching in as well as reaching
 
out.
 
Mr. Wilson may share several elements of the
 
noble arts of the Apache with us this evening,
 
including demonstrating and playing the
 
storied Apache fiddle.
 This delicate instru-
ment was meant for the player's own enjoyment
 
-
-
 if we listen very very carefully,  we may
 
share in that enjoyment too.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, MR.  CHESLEY GOSEYUN
 
WILSON.
 
-21-
(An interview may possibly be useful here)...
 
CK
 +  I understand your fiddles are made out of
 
the agave plant?
 What is that?
 What does it
 
look like?
 How do you make them?
 What are
 
the strings made of?
 
+  Are many of your people re-learning the
 
older arts?
 Why do you suppose that is?
 
+  What do you think needs to happen to keep
 
Apache arts alive and blooming?
 
Thank you Mr. Wilson.
 
-22-
OK (enters holding
 
concertina)
 Musical instruments  reflect special times and
 
special places.
 As we've seen,  Apache fiddles
 
sort of grew out of the habitat where Apaches
 
live.
 This instrument in my hand,  though,
 
couldn't have even been thought of before the
 
machine age,  and it was thought of first in
 
Europe, where the industrial revolution began.
 
The German-style concertina  (like this one)
 
came to the United States along with early
 
German immigrants to settle happily into the
 
so-called "polka belt"  around the Great Lakes
 
It is roughly square in shape,  has only
 
buttons  (no keys)  and produces 104 notes -
-
52 when you pull and the other 52 when you
 
push.
 It is made out of metal and plastic
 
and other materials and has an enormous number
 
of separate parts including four hand-filed
 
reeds for each note -
-
 a construction that
 
calls for a particularly patient and con-
scientious kind of craftsmanship.
 
-23-
CK
 
Christy Hengel,  our next honoree,  grew up on
 
a Minnesota farm where he distinguished him-
self as a handy sort of a fellow.
 He was a
 
tinkerer and built his own motorcycle from
 
scratch,  and he lived in an area where the
 
German-based concertina provided the everyday
 
music for dancing and the background for
 
courting the ladies.
 He kept on enjoying both
 
tinkering and music,  and in time produced the
 
world-renowned "Hengel concertina,"  an
 
instrument that has set a standard around the
 
world for the refinement of  its craftsmanship
 
and the accuracy and brilliance of  its tone.
 
I
'm going to ask Mr.  Hengel to come and chat
 
with us for a few minutes and maybe he'll give
 
us a little sample of what a Hengel concertina
 
sounds  like.
 Ladies and gentlemen -
-
 MR.
 
CHRISTY HENGEL
 
-24-
(Some suggestions for questions to Mr.  Hengel)
 
CK
 
+  Can you explain to us more about what is
 
special about a Hengel concertina,  how it
 
differs from other kinds?
 
+  How many parts does it have?
 Do you make
 
them all yourself or do you job any of them
 
out?
 
+  How many orders do you have now for con-
certinas -
-
 enough to keep busy or do you
 
want more?
 
+  I understand you added one reed to the usual
 
three for each note.
 Could you let us hear
 
how a note sounds -
-
 maybe a low one and a
 
high one?
 
-25-
+  Something I always wondered about a concer-
tina
 when you push in and get a note,  what
 
note sounds when you pull out?
 Is  it the next
 
note in the scale or maybe an octave?
 Or
 
what?
 
+ And now how about a tune.. .You used to play
 
with some of the early polka bands.
 Do you
 
happen to remember the first tune you ever
 
learned to play?
 
Thank you, Mr.  Hengel

I think I
' m just going to have to flat come
 
out and say that some of the most glorious
 
sounds ever made on this continent -
-
 or on
 
the entire planet as far as that goes -
-
have been made by singers in the unaccompanied
 
Black vocal quartet tradition.
 And to think
 
that until just a few years ago the whole
 
style seemed to have gone out of fashion in
 
that crazy way that American fads come and go
 
-
-
 here today and absolutely unheard tomorrow.
 
Not,  however,  our next honorees -
-
 the fabled
 
Fairfield Four.
 This remarkable traditional
 
ensemble has been in existence since the early
 
nineteen twenties, which makes it nearly
 
seventy years old.
 It's important to realize
 
that it is the ensembie that has endured,  that
 
is the Fairfield Four as an institution. 
Individual singers have come and gone,  but the
 
song repertoire,  the style and dash of the
 
arrangements and the power of the singing,
 
remain the same.
 They had a reputation to
 
maintain and they have maintained it.
 
-27-
CK
 
CK
 
Today the Fairfield Four  are still based in
 
Nashville,  Tennessee and still singing  in the
 
majestic old way.
 Actually,  they are no
 
longer four but six,  since some of the older
 
singers enjoy the relaxation of being able to
 
turn over a strenuous  lead or vocal effect to
 
a fresh younger voice.
 Ladies  and gentlemen,
 
may I present Reverend Sam McCrary,  lead,
 
W
.
  
Isaac Freeman,  bass, 
A
 4,L.  Richardson,  lead,
 
James Hill,  baritone,  Wilson Waters
  tenor,
 
and multi-part singer,  Robert Hamlett.
 The
 
historic FAIRFIELD FOUR!
 
And now,  ladies and gentlemen,  we will take
 
a brief  intermission.
 We have many more
 
artists to bring to you this evening,  and we
 
know this is  a work night and you can't stay
 
out too  late.
 So please come back to your
 
seats in fifteen minutes.
 Thank you.

The old-fashioned string band once reigned
 
supreme in American country dance halls.
 
I
've danced many a mile myself to the
 
standard group -- fiddle, banjo and guitar,
 
with such occasional exotic additions as
 
drums, double bass or even piano.
 And to day
 
in spite of all the electronic effects they
 
can drag in, country music from Nashville
 
still reminds us of the old-timey string
 
band -- and it better keep on that way or it
 
will lose its national audience, won't it?
 
With so many fine musicians working so
 
steadily in the string band tradition,
 
virtuosity has almost become the rule, but
 
genuine musical inventiveness is still the
 
exception.
 Our next National Heritage
 
Fellow 
-
 
is
-
 
CK
 
-29-
of the most widely imitated musicians  in the
 
world;  his creation -
-
 the syncopated three
 
fingered banjo lick (or Scruggs style)  -
-
set a particular stamp on bluegrass that makes
 
it identifiable anywhere in the world it is
 
played.
 Joe Wilson tells me that Mr.  Scruggs
 
drew upon older Piedmont banjo styles in this
 
creation and always has carefully credited
 
those sources.
 His sound is critical to
 
bluegrass music; more than any other artist,
 
he defined the sound.
 
About a year ago,  Earl Scruggs underwent an
 
operation that has left his hand in poor
 
condition.
 He feels unwilling to perform
 
when he can't give his best,  so the Folk
 
Arts Program has asked his neighbor,
 
student,  protegee and long-time friend,
 
Mr.  John Hartford to play a few special tunes
 
in Earl Scruggs'  honor.

 Rosemaling -
-
 rose painting -
-
 is a tradi-
tional Norwegian decorative folk art.
 It is
 
also an important,  colorful and fascinating
 
traditional art of the upper midwest,
 
especially Wisconsin, Minnesota,  and Iowa.
 
Early immigrant Norwegian families brought
 
great numbers of rosemaled wooden objects
 
from Norway as heirlooms and keepsakes,  but
 
it seems to have all stopped short right
 
there.
 There is no evidence that the art
 
of rosemaling was practiced at all in the
 
United States before its revival in the
 
1930s.
 It's really rather sad.
 Like other
 
immigrants before them,  Norwegian-Americans
 
seemed to have thought that their old world
 
ornamental tradition was just not right for
 
their new lives and new loyalties.
 
But American History,  though short,  moves
 
quickly.
 Although we aren't sure of all
 
the factors  involved,  we can put a name to
 
-31-
the exceptional Norwegian-American crafts-
man who,  during the Great Depression,  almost
 
single-handedly revived the old craft.
 He
 
was Per Lysne,  and he lived in Stoughton,
 
Wisconsin where our next honoree,  Ethel
 
Kvalheim,  grew up and where she lives to
 
this day.
 She actually knew Mr.  Lysne and
 
watched him work in his one man garage-
turned-studio.
 
Since those days -
-
 partly as a result of
 
the elegance and purity of the work of Per
 
Lysne's followers,  most especially Ethel
 
Kvalheim,  rosemaling has attracted wide
 
interest.
 Classes in rosemaling are now
 
frequent,  instruction books abound and a
 
national exhibition is held annually in
 
Decorah,  Iowa where each year a Gold Medal
 
for excellence in rosemaling is awarded.
 
Ethel Kvalheim won her Gold Medal many
 
years ago;  today, wherever,  the craft is
 
-32-
CK
 
known,  her name comes up.
 She is a fine
 
artist and a traditional  leader in the
 
rosemaling revival.
 Please welcome her.
 
(Some possible topics or questions for
 
Mrs.  Kvalheim)
 
+  Mrs.  Kvalheim,  did you teach yourself
 
rosemaling?
 Did you never go to art
 
school or get any special training?
 
+  I understand you were commissioned to do
 
all the interior decorating of the Stoughton
 
Home Savings and Loan.
 Was that an enjoyable
 
job?
 How much did you actually rosemal there?
 
Would you do it again?
 How do the people in
 
Stoughton like it?
 
+  I am told that you rarely accept commissions
 
these days.
 Why is that?
 What keeps rose-
maling enjoyable to you after all these years?
 
Thank you Mrs.  Kvalheim.
 
-33-
CK
 
+  Could you show us or describe for us
 
the difference between rosemaling nowdays
 
in the United States and rosemaling in
 
Norway,  in the Old World?

 Now,  as we've seen many times already this
 
evening,  folk arts grow up amongst particular
 
people in particular places.
 Most of the
 
time,  they don't spread around easily or
 
quickly;  the only way they actually trans-
plant is when people move and carry them
 
along.
 A sadly typical twentieth century
 
story shows how this works:
 
For many hundreds of years,  the Pontos region
 
of Turkey was home to a large Greek popula-
tion.
 In 1922 these people were forcibly
 
resettled in Greece and a small area of the
 
Caucasus in a massive exchange of populations
 
(an action disturbingly familiar to followers
 
of today's news).
 The Pontic Greeks had
 
already developed an especially dramatic and
 
exciting regional style of music and dance.
 
After their forced removal from Turkey,  they
 
clung even more fiercely to their art forms,
 
relying on them to preserve morale and hope.
 
IR M
 
So wherever the Pontic Greeks have traveled,
 
both in Greece and in a late migration to the
 
United States,  their musicians still play the
 
traditional Pontic instruments,  the people
 
still dance the old Pontic dances.
 
Mr.  Ilias Kementzides lived through the events
 
I just outlined.
 He was born in the Caucasus,
 
moved later to Greece and later still to the
 
United States.
 He grew up in a family of
 
Pontic musicians and studied the lvra from
 
boyhoo d. Today,  a recognized master, he
 
continues to play the fiery and compelling
 
music that accompanies Pontic dance,  and
 
the ancient sagas of forgotten battles and

Up till now we've met a number of artists who
 
practiced several art forms.
 Now we come to
 
an art form that itself  is multi-parted --
a way of dancing that provides  its own
 
musical accompaniment.
 Or you could put it
 
the other way around and say it  is a way of
 
making music by dancing.
 
It's easy to admire the rhythmic precision of
 
of master tap dancers such as LaVaughn

a range of tonal effects as well --

that of a master drummer -- and a drummer in

It's nice,  I think,  how the National Heritage
 
awards kind of jerk a person's attention
 
around from music to dance,  from east to west,
 
from big city to small town,  from ear to eye.
 
As we get towards the end of the evening, we
 
are going to return to the center of the
 
country,  to the green rolling hills of south-
central Oklahoma, where the remarkable Kiowa
 
people live.
 
Vanessa Paukeigope Morgan is a Kiowa woman who
 
has been commended by the elders of her tribe
 
for her dedication to her people's traditions.
 
She learned the basics of  leatherwork and
 
beadwork from her Kiowa grandmother,  Jean
 
Mo
 
ope.
 She continued learning from other
 
tribal elders,  she journeyed to museums and
 
private collections to study historical
 
objects,  she examined archival materials and
 
old photographs.
 Because of her intense
 
dedication to the arts of her people,  she is
 
-39--
CK
 
now competent to make bowcase and quiver sets,
 
shirts,  leggings,  saddles,  shields,  lances,
 
buckskin and cloth dresses,  and cradleboards.
 
More importantly,  she does this work for her
 
own people.
 There are many private collectors
 
who would gladly pay top prices for her work
 
but she continues her membership in the 0-Ho--
Mah tribal society for which she helps make
 
the necessary regalia.
 And she was recently
 
invited by the Black Legs Society to make
 
a complete set of horse trappings for a
 
special commemoration of Kiowa men and women
 
who had died defending their people.

CK
 +  Mrs. Morgan,  please come over and sit
 
down with me for a few minutes.
 I
'd like
 
to quote from something you wrote a few
 
years ago.
 "I grew up dancing and taking
 
part in the Kiowa Black Legs Society,  the
 
O-Ho-Mah Lodge and other ceremonials.
 
Those years,  as a young girl,  seemed like
 
they would go on forever.
 I never thought
 
that my grandparents would die nor did I
 
think of that special time ending.

Do you suppose perhaps your grandparents
 
felt the same way?
 Will your children feel
 
the same way?

would help you in your work?

people and their culture?

We're going to bring it all back home to you
 
now;  home to Virginia,  home to a way of making
 
music that is an American invention and that
 
all Americans recognize,  home to a man who
 
was born and brought up right here in these
 
parts and whose strong voice and eloquent
 
guitar have graced hundreds of concerts and
 
festivals in the greater Washington area for
 
more years than I guess he'd want to count.
 
John Cephas is a Piedmont blues man and a
 
spokesman for that tradition.
 A local blues
 
authority comments that his  "positive
 
attractive presentation of this  important
 
local style has served to reintroduce the
 
the local Black audience to their own valuable
 
musical roots."
 John Cephas was born right
 
here in the old Foggy Bottom neighborhood of
 
Washington,  but he has traveled the globe -

Europe,  South and Central America -
-
 most
 
recently presenting his music and his
 
-43-
CK
 
scholarly and balanced views of African-
American musical traditions to eager
 
audiences in the Soviet Union.
 
John Cephas is also a teacher,  a mentor,  and
 
a leader in the blues community.
 Together
 
with a group of  long-time friends he recently
 
founded the D.C.  Blues Society and became its
 
first president;  this is the first such
 
organization formed by and for bluesmen in the
 
nation and Mr.  Cephas hopes that many of you
 
in the audience will join in supporting their
 
concerts,  their festivals and their bi-monthly

DRAFT 9/15/89
 
PRESENTATION OF  1989  NATIONAL HERITAGE FELLOWS
 
CONGRESSIONAL RECEPTION
 
SEPTEMBER 27,  1989
 
CHAIRMAN
 
Good morning.
 On behalf of the National Endowment
 
for the Arts which I am priviliged to chair,  I
 
should like to thank the distinguished Honorary
 
Committee of Senators and Congressmen who are
 
sponsoring this ceremony and this  reception.
 We
 
are grateful to have been invited to your house and
 
appreciative of the honor and attention you are
 
hereby showing for the work that we do.
 We also
 
wish to thank the Joseph Martinson Memorial Fund
 
and the Philip F.  Schoch Bequest for making this
 
reception possible.
 
This is the eighth year that National Heritage
 
Fellowships have been presented,  and the ceremonies
 
themselves have begun to take on some of the
 
qualities of a tradition.
 They are multi-parted:
 
a reception and award ceremony especially designed
 
for Congressional and media information;  a private
 
banquet for the relaxed enjoyment of the awardees
 
and their families;  and a final free concert for
 
the general public,  recorded for  later broadcast
 
over National Public Radio,  traditionally on
 
-2-
Thanksgiving Day!
 We are almost  in danger of
 
becoming an institution.
 
But not quite.
 Every year we are re-invigorated
 
and re-inspired by the amazing array of traditional
 
folk art forms and traditional folk artists that
 
emerge out of the American landscape -
-
 each
 
representing a particular group that has chosen to
 
express their particular view of beauty in a
 
particular way.
 We try over and over again to
 
express the brilliance of the American artistic
 
range; we work on metaphors like mosaics
 
and patchwork quilts and jewel boxes.
 Maybe we
 
should simply say -
-
 look at the National Heritage
 
Fellows -
-
 look at them each and every year.
 Here
 
is the example;  here is the proof of the bedrock
 
nature of American diversity within unity.
 
We thank each of the artists you see before you for
 
their long-standing services to the arts  and to the
 
nation.
 Each one has been nominated by their
 
-3-
fellow citizens and selected by still others.
 As
 
such they stand as  artistic representatives not
 
only of their own communities but of the nation
 
itself.
 It is therefore with great pride that I
 
present National Heritage Fellowship certificates
 
to the following folk artists:
 
+  from Woodford,  Virginia.
 A guitarist,  singer,
 
teacher,  organizer and distinguished spokesperson
 
for his tradition.
 For his ongoing contribution
 
to artistic excellence in the art of the Piedmont
 
blues,  the National Endowment for the Arts honors
 
-
-
 MR.  JOHN CEPHAS.
 
+  from Norwalk,  California.
 An exceptional
 
instrumentalist,  singer,  arranger,  and craftsman
 
from the Vera Cruz tradition.
