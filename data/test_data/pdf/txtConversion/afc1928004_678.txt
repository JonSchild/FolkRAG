WRITTEN BY JAS. SHEERAN. 
DONE WITH GREAT SUCCESS 
IN THEIR CHARACTER SKETCH, AMERICA, IRELAND AND 
GERMANY. 
BY JAMES AND LYDIA SHEERAN, 
To England's sons old England, 
Always will be dear; 
The land of peace and plenty, 
T11; land of beef and beer. 
All true born sons of England, 
Must feel pooud delight 
When the royal jack of Great Brittain. 
Waves proudly on their right. 
Frenchmen the wide world over, 
For their country must yearn; 
To the land of the great Napoleon, 
With longing gaze they turn. 
Their country is great and noble, 
And how their heart beats as they glance, 
As they see the glorious tri-color 
Of the great republic France. 
There is still another nation, 
Whose glories we'll relate; 
The fair haired sons of`Germany, 
Know their native laud is great. 
The fatherland they love so dearly. 
And they are always proud to see 
The great and noble ensign 
Of united Germanie. 
To all Irishmen the green isle, 
That they call their native land; 
Though poor and held in bondage, 
They will always say it's grand 
And wherever they are cast by fortune. 
Irishmen will proudly smile, 
On the glorious harp and shamrock, 
Of the green flag of their native land.

America, Ireland, and Germany. 
CONTINUED: 
Yet among all the world's great nations, 
One other I 
will name, 
Our country free and united, 
O'er the wide world has gained fame. 
The poor of other nations 
Sail across the sea, 
To seek a 
home and fortune, 
.rn this dear land of thc free. 
Her men are all one and equal, 
All have an equal show; 
No royal king or tyrant 
In our land do we know. 
Its stars are undimmed in lustre, 
And you can search the wide world through, 
And not rind a 
more glorious banner, 
Than our own red white and blue.

When a 
young man is leading, 
His wife to the " Halter." 
He little thinks how " Saddle " 
Will be his " Bride) " tour. 
Or what feeling may " Sturrup," 
On the " Spur " of the moment, 
For instance. his wife may be a 
little " Sulky," 
She may have a " Wagon tongue," 
And want to assume " Reins " of government, 
And once she gets the " Whip" in hand, 
She may " drive " him to destruction; 
And then his " Spoke ", will be all gone. 
Other fellows will be loafing around, 
And he will soon get " Tired," 
Well now I 
have*got -up to the " Hub," 
And I 
think it's better to switch off.

I 
feel so overpowered with joy, 
I 
sutrce know what to do; 
And the cause of my rejoicing, 
I 
will quickly tell to you. 
The other day while in the park 
Conversing there with Fred, 
And speaking in a 
gentle tone, 
These words to him I 
said. 
Crmnus. 
Oh! Freddy don't you really love 
Your little Dolly dear; 
Just place your arms around my waist, 
I 
feel so awful queer. 
My love for you is exceedingly true, 
To deny it I 
don't know how, 
Now don't be so provoking, 
But just kiss your Dolly now. 
We sat down on a 
rustic seat,' 
A 
few words just to say; 
He told his funny tales of love, 
To pass the time away. 
I 
felt myself in ecstacy, 
He said just name the day; 
But shy to comply, and not deny, 
These words to him did say.

MY BLACK AND TAN DAUGHTER, 
BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
SUNG wrrn GREAT SUCCESS BY 
JAS. SHEERAN AT THE PEOPLE'S THEATRE, 
ST. LOUIS, MO. 
I 
have a 
black and tan daughter, 
Who went to act out on the stage; 
In Uncle Tom's Cabin she sang Swanee river. 
When Thomas and eve was all the rage. 
One night she tried to play Topsy, 
The gang from the gallery throwed beans, 
The audience thought a 
gas tank had busted, 
When my daughter jumped through the scenes. 
CHORUS. 
Waltzing around in a 
big coffee sack, 
With her hair done up in sardines, 
All of the orchestra crawled under the stage, 
When me daughter jumped out through the scenes. 
She turned a 
flip flap like a 
big keg of beer, ( Break.) 
Came through the basso drum, and tore off her ear; 
(Break.) 
In the plantation scene she got crankey, 
McChisker hit her with a 
whip; 
She pulled out a 
razor with a 
big yellow handle, 
And give all the niggers the Pittsburg grip. 
Marks the lawyer went down through a 
trap, 
And busted his new suit of blue jeans; 
All the people crawled under their seats, 
When me daughter jumped oat through the scenes. 
CHORUS. 
She's got a 
mouth like a 
big cucumber, . ( Break) 
And her heels stick out like a 
freight car bumper, 
(Break.) 
Waltzing around in her overshoes, 
She only wears seventeens 
All the supers got out in the alley, 
When my daughter jumped out through the scenes.

You've heard of many regiments that are our 
nations pride, 
Of gay arid gallant cavaliers on noble steeds bestride, 
But a 
regiment is forming, that is always met 
with cheers, 
Our boys gave us a 
title of the Lady Grenadiers, 
With uniform the neatest, accoutruements so bright, 
Our sfyle so captivating, our step so neat and light, 
You may talk about your Ebony Guards, 
Bennett's Fusileers, 
The troupe that always takes the sway, is the 
Lady Fusileers, 
CHORUS. 
Yes, left, right, forward march, you hear our 
captain say, 
When we attack with Cupid's dart, we're sure 
to win the day, 
Our boys they shout hurrah, here comes the Musketeers 
They wave their hats and handkerchiefs to the 
Lady Grenadiers. 
We have our gallant colonel who has such stylish ways, 
He says our regiment can beat the gallant little grays, 
And when we're out a 
marching the air resounds 
with cheers, 
The folks turn out to welcome the Lady Grenadiers. 
And when parade is over each one of us dismiss, 
To join our handsome lovers who greets us with a 
kiss, 
We're going to have a 
masquerade, the 
Hoolahan Musketeers, 
Are going to give bright colors to the Lady Grenadiers.

THE TWO LOVERS.

JANE. 
WRITTEN BY BEN COLLINS FOR THE SHEERANS. 
I 
know a 
certain party 
By the name of Mike McCarthy, 
Whose father says be is a 
millionaire; 
Me he wants to marry, 
But my steady fellow Harry, 
Like an Indian, says, he'll scalp off all his hair. 
When I 
see them both together, 
I 
can't determine whether 
It's Harry or McCarthy that I 
want; 
For the Englishman's so pretty, 
And the Irishman's so witty, 
That the both of them my memory will haunt. 
Cuouns. 
They are just too sweet to live, 
All the world I 
wouldn't give, 
One has got the money, 
And the other has the style, 
Both to me are very dear, 
But I'll wait another year; 
Before I 
give my consent, 
They may wait a 
little while. 
If I 
should chance to marry, 
My little English Harry, 
In a 
cottage we will have to live on love; 
And as I 
don't in any manner, 
Resemble Dr. Tanner, 
Why that's plain upon the shelf I'll have to show. 
When if I 
take McCarthy, 
So jolly and so hearty, 
Bundles of money I'll have at my command, 
Yes, Michael, I 
will take you, 
And I 
never will forsake you, 
For above all, you're a 
true born Irishman. 
CHORUS. 
And if fortune it should turn, 
And our bread we'd have to earn, 
Why you could be a 
book keeper, 
And I 
could be a 
clerk. 
wnrim; In BEN COLLINS FOR Tin SHEERINS. 
Not many miles from here, 
Where they sell Milwaukee beer, 
Lives a 
maiden who has got me on a 
string, 
She's the worst you ever saw, 
She has nearly broke my 
jaw, 
And fluids me wear my left duke in a 
sling. 
She's a 
female pugilist, 
llowly suffering what a 
fist, 
It will send you where you won't come back again; 
Her nose looks like a 
cork, 
And she's the terror of New York, 
She's ay freckled, fat consumptive Sarah Jane. 
CHoitus, 
Jane, Jane, my Kentucky Jane— pants, 
busted Friday evening at the dance; 
Oh! they say you have no sense, 
But I 
still think you insane, 
You're my freckled, fat, cunsumptive Sarah Jane. 
She promised she would meet me, 
When the clock struck seventeen, 
At the stock yards a 
mile outside of town; 
Where the pigs feet and pigs ears, 
And the tough old Texas steers, 
Were sold for sirlion steaks ten cents a 
pound. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She is cross-eyed, she is crazy, 
She's hump-backed, she's bow-legged, and she's lame; 
She's always full of blarney, 
And 
struck on Dennis Carney, 
She's my freckled, fat, consumptive Sarah Jane. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Jane, my poor foolish Jane, 
Slug her with your suspenders once again, 
They say your teeth are false, 
From eating Rochelle salts, 
She's my skinny, lanky, Sarah Jane, 
MARY ANN O'GRADY. 
WRITTEN AND BUNG BY BAKER & LEE. 
In a 
snug little cabin where the moss grows so green, 
My pretty little Mary she does dwell; 
And the birds sing sweetly above hex head, 
As she trips along so softly through the dell. 
Her pretty little feet and shapely little head, 
has won my heart and set me crazy, 
And I 
hope some day to call this darling mine, 
My pretty little Mary Ann O'Grady. 
CHORUS. 
This little Irish female I 
dearly love, 
And we talk of happy days to come and go, 
I 
never can forget her lovely eyes so blue, 
She's graceful and she's neat from head to toe, 
I 
will always love this pretty lady, 
If she proves true I'll ever be so too, 
My pretty little Mary Ann O'Grady.

WEIT'TEN DT BEN COLLINS FOE THE SHEEHAN& 
We once did know a 
very bad kid, 
With no hat on his head; 
He slugged four Micks, when he was six, 
And he never went to bed. 
He wore his pants for an ulster, 
And broke a 
tom cat's neck with his shoes; 
When an organ played his pennies he gave, 
rls.) buy the monkey buns. 
CHORUS. 
He loved sponge cake, he loved fried cake, 
He loved yeast cake, he loved west cake; 
He loved short cake, he loved long cake, 
And he took the cake, crackers and all. 
He had no teeth when he was born, 
But he chewed his sisters ear; 
When his father got poor, he fell in a 
sewer, 
And then got loaded on beer. 
He stole a 
stone that weighed five ton, 
His fingers they dicl burn,, 
They tried to drown him twice, 
But de was waiting for a 
third term.

AND DONE BY THEM WITS 
FOREPAUGH'S CIRCUS. 
Of all the Irish pairs from Ireland, 
That to this country came; 
There's none can dance alongside of US, 
Or equal us in fame. 
We learned to dance in Ireland, 
And that's the reason why, 
They take back seats when we commence, 
For they know it's no use to try. 
For we're Pat and Judy Donavan from Ireland, 
In a 
big ship we came over; 
And we'll bless the happy day, when we 
crossed the ragin sea, 
To be landed on America's free shore. 
We could sing and dance for you the whole 
night long, 
And of course we never tire; 
The way we move it goes to prove, 
That we are hung on wire. 
If you're inclined to doubt us, 
Strict attention pay, 
We're the happiest pair you will declare, 
Before we do go away.

AIM; 
ONLY A VIOLET. 
Grandma had a 
torn cat, 
He could do such tricks; 
But all the neighbors children 
Used to shower him with bricks. 
His teeth were like needles, 
He served four years in jail, 
Then O'Reilly's great big poodle dog. 
Chewed off poor Tommy's tail. 
AIR; 
HANG UP YOUR HAT. 
Hang up your pants upon the floor, 
Then sit down on the wall, 
Who ever seen an old maid 
That could do a 
funny fall. 
Nobody tears up greenbacks, 
Or walks when they ride-
Is there any one here who will call us their dear, 
And ask us to be their bride.

Cause he was not true to me; 
He said I

And he was just twenty-three; 
He was a 
lillie, he was a

He was never known to work; 
And they called him Neck-Tie Charlie, 
Cause he was a

I 
am thinking of the day when but a little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, add forever 
growing wild. 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay. 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And. we played 'neat Ii the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those hapl ,y, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were tilled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll COMO 
again no mon. 
When we played on the turnpike gate.

Of a

And such rosy cheeks, I

Her eyes they are so bright, they shine like stars

With her little water pail upon her arm, 
With her lovely flowing hair, arrah, with her 
none can compare. 
And all the Irish hearts she does charm. 
Next Sunday night at eight, down by the garden gate, 
rn present her with a 
wedding ring; 
And happy'll be the day, when to the church 
we will away, 
And I'll marry my pretty Irish Queen. 
Chorus. 
MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
EVERY DAY, 
I've a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och ! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
Ana as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CHORUS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you dcn't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'llonough, blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och ! murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare. 
And then they did all run away; 
Says 1, •‘ my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because l'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to he married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say - 
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day.

In eighteen hundred and sixty one, 
The war it first broke out; 
The poor unfortunate Irishmen 
Were scattered all about. 
The rich man would not go and fight. 
But for the poor ones they did hunt; 
Then hand in hand to Dixie's land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
CHORUS. 
Then give a 
cheer for we Yankee boys, 
For the enemy we must hunt, 
So hand in hand to Dixie's Land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
When we got on board the train, 
We had not been long gone; 
Until we found our enemy; 
Were about ten thousand strong. 
We sent back telegraph despatches, 
And such time was never made, 
When Gen McClellan our little Mac, 
Led on the Irish Brigade. 
So now me Yankee comrades, 
Don't harm an Irishman, 
For,Paddies door is open for you. 
With a 
warm and welcome hand.. 
I 
hope the day is not very far off, 
When old Ireland shall have her rights, 
And that little green banner float in victory, 
Along with the Stars and Stripes.

Behold the Killarney Musketeers a

With bayonets brightly glistening, and the band

They're the finest soldiers in the land, and of

And they show the people how they shine,

I'm a 
true-hearted boy from the green shores of Erin, 
That" Emerald" set in the sea, 
Where bounteous nature her best cloth appear in; 
And choicest of gifts scatters free. 
Our mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Our rivers and lakes filled with life galore, 
Loveliest scenes on all sides there surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar, 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland astLore. 
Dear Grannuail thy daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn, 
Ever in battle thy sons they are fearless,' 
Death do they hold but in scoau. 
Our hearts ever open to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turned from the door, 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland asthore. 
Chorus. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud boys to wear 
To it I'll ever be true, 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply indeed as I 
do. 
Distance or climate that bond cannot sevea, 
Firm in our hearts all the wide world 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it no never; 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore.

SHE'S GONE TO BE AN ANGEL. 
SUNG BY J. C. MURPHY. 
I'll sing you a 
little song, 
And tell you a 
story that's strange; 
About a 
wicked young gall, 
Her front name was Sal. 
She drove me mad, crazy, deranged, 
We first met on the street, 
She fell all over my feet, , 
She poligized gently. 
Saying—Excuse my awkward feet. 
C ORUS. 
She's gone .to be an angel, 
Pushing clouds up in the skies, 
If ever she reaches that holy land, 
I 
never want to die. 
If ever she joins the angel band, 
There'll be a 
cromotion sure, 
They'll raise a 
base ball sturbance, 
On Hallalula shore. 
She sang a 
little sang, 
As she put her nrm in mine, 
'Twas Silver threads amongst the gold, 
And I 
thought it awful fine. 
But I've changed my mind since then, 
I 
think it bass and corse, 
Like the captain of a 
canal scow, 
Twits rusty, rough and hoarse 
Chorus, 
She took me to her home, 
Her mother fired me out, 
With clubs they pummelled about my head, 
And for help I 
loud did shout. 
They busted my new suspenders, 
Six fat policemen came, 
And I 
three months served in the work hong*, 
Because I 
could find no bail.

PARODY ON EMPTY CRAW. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
Once I 
owned a 
yellow dog his name was 
Towser Jenkins, 
A butcher cut his tail off with a 
cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mark on all the cats in town, 
And when he spotted one he'd never leave her, 
He wore his legs off stumpey, 
Chaseing milk carts round the country, 
But the little house is empty where we ties him, 
A 
policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic 
in his grub, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's Fizened. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to look for rats in the happy hunting grounds 
He died this morning while the sun was rising; 
The flees have all turned out to hunt up a 
new 
lunch route, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
Oh! how that dog would grin, when a 
tramp 
would look at him, 
lie used to put bay-windows in their breeches; 
Wore the hair all off his ribs, 
Chaseing cats around corn cribs, 
Had bunions on his knees from jumping ditches, 
On his nose he had two blisters, 
Where the rats chewed off his whiskers, 
When he was asleep they'd paralyze him. 
But now he's gone and dusted, 
And his chest prstector's busted, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CHORUS. 
He has gone to hunt for liver, 
Way acrossed the Swanee river, 
No more in the sewer we'll baptise him, 
No more he'll homeward sail, 
With tin can's upon his tail, 
Empty is the dog-house-Towser's pizened.

SOMEBODY1S 
MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GUS WIT.T.TAMS. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long. 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
'Unheeding the glance of her anxious eys. 
Down the street with laughter lind shout. 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery stank 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
"I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
"She's somebody's mother, boys, you know. 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a hand 
To help my mother—you understand! 
If ever she's poor and old and gray. 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
"Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she mid/ 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak;

And " Somebody's mother e" prayer was hem&

If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm.

And tell you all about the widow's party, 
'Twas at Paythogoras Hall. 
We gave a

And invited all the young Nits gay and hearty, 
There was handsome Paddy Grace, 
Sure he's now on the police,

He came from County Cork, 
To the City,of New York, 
He joked and sang and made us all feel hearty.

She was a

And a

McGinn sang Pin-a-
fore, 
Till his throat was very sore, 
And " Little Dudeen," sang by Smith so sweetly, 
Crosby sang a

And MoGuffin done an Irish jig so neatly. 
Flynn sang, " Dancing on the green," 
Also " She's a 
fairy queen." 
Flood sang " Hold the fort for we're the 
strongest party," 
And Murphy and lirn Lang, 
Done the Lack-a-wan-na Gang, 
Down at the charming Widow Clancy's party. Cho. 
As it was growing late, 
Sure we tho't was time to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the supper, 
We were hardly seated right,

A man well known to fame, 
I'm a 
shining light- at all the elubs, 
I'm a 
man of pluck and game. 
I'm the beet known man on Broadway, 
On account of my form and face. 
And the stylish way I 
carry myself, 
With a 
walk of air and grace, 
I'm the one you can't help notice, 
I'm a 
man of splendid parts, 
Pre a 
high- horn education. 
I'm decomplished in all arts, 
/*an swim like Captain Boynton, 
I 
can walk a

can pull a 
boat with Hanlon, 
I'm a 
crack shot on the wing.

When the dashing girls me lear. 
For my graceful glide in the ballroom, 
I'm called 11 ‘.. gay cavalier.

Laughing and talking with maidens gay,

If the stars could speak tell tales they might,

It was over at old Regan's house, we had a 
jolly time, 
There was lots of dancing, I 
tell you it was fine, 
Oh! the boys and girls enjoyed themselves, for 
they came far and near, 
And all the lads assembled there, to try old 
Regan's beer. 
Old Regan he felt lively for a 
time, 
And a 
happier man I 
don't think could be found, 
He told us that the house was ours, to do just as 
we liked, 
So then we had a 
drink of bear all round, 
CHORUS. 
Oh! such singing, and such dancing pon my 
word 'twas really grand, 
And the music sounded just as well as if it was a 
band. 
While Murphy played the fiddle, they danced 
up and down the middle, 
And we never left old Began till the morn. 
There was Mary Jones and Jerry Flynn got up 
to dance a 
jig, 
Along with Michael Cronin's wife, who looked 
like Murphy's pig, 
The floor they welted beautiful, and went round 
hand in hand, 
But Cronin's wife she danced so much that she 
could hardly stand, 
Then James O'Brien he got up to sing a 
song, 
But they did not seem to relish it one bit, 
They yanked him out so gently that he thought 
his time had come, 
And the poor old fellow fell into a 
fit. 
Chorus. 
They danced away till broad daylight, the sun 
broke in the sky, 
But McCarthy's wife was so fatigued, she thought 
she'd really 
M'Guinness got overpowered on wine and lager beer, 
He felt so good he tried to do a 
pirouette on his ear, 
And poor old Jerry Dolan was found sleeping 
With a 
vice like grip upon a

And when they danced the last quadrille the 
tiddler fell asleep, 
And that's what wound old Regan's party up.

To our neat little cabin far down in the glen, 
The home of my boyhood's bright years; 
Fond memory wanders, and sore once again, 
I 
return to beloved ones so dear. 
My father and mother so cheerful and gay, 
As happy as any young pair, 
Would join in the pleasure's and laugh at the fun, 
As they at in the old family chair.

Good-natured, contented they sit the long day, 
The blessings of old age to share; 
No thoughts of sorrow comes over them now, 
As they sit in the old family chair. 
With a

I 
wander again thro' the fields; 
With a

To my loving embraces she yields. 
The linnets clear notes from the trees overhead, 
And the echoing peasantry sing;

For all is blithe and happiness,

Sure I 
thought I'd make a 
call, 
So I 
am here to greet you all, 
And to thank ye for yere welcome to a 
Stranger; 
I 
got a 
job of work, 
Since I 
landed in New York, 
But my work is attended with great danger, 
For a 
mason's clerk am I, 
One whose always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is my occupation; 
But br politics I'm bound, 
And I'm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation. 
Circuits. 
Paddy Duffy is my name, 
I 
will always be the same, 
Whether rich or poor, of high or low degree; 
Like Muldoon the solid guy, 
A 
bold specimen am I, 
Of a 
self-made, high-toned gentleman, you see ! 
(Dance.) 
One day while on the ladder, 
Oh ! I 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persilasion; 
Sheeney called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I 
had to tell, 
Oh ! sez I, you dirty Jew, 
But for your ancestors, lik e 
yon, 
The Lord would be ali vP 
to- day, and doing well

By my brogue you can tell I'm a

By my dress you can see I'm a

Tho' for fighting and blood-shed I'm not much careing. 
I'll show no white feather if sent to the wars.

To the bugle's shrill notes I've obeyed like a 
soldier, 
When hungers sharp thorns in my bosom were deep; 
When darkness our forms has shielded from danger, 
The roar of the cannon has lulled me to sleep. 
At the close of the fight with the moon as our guardian, 
When peace was proclaimed 'neath the bright 
shining stars; 
Our commanders stern voices were heard loudly calling 
God bless you, my bold gallant Irish Huzza,rs.

By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
Ingel bright her happy .smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning. 
A-de, A-de, A:de, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watal and wait alway! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed. 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the bin,, 
mountains 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
A-de, A-de, A-do. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and 
it alway. 
By the blue AlsatisT0 mountains, 
Came a 
strawy,— = 
the spring, 
And he lingerea oy the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A-de, A- de, 
Such dreams must pass away. 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
seem to watch and wait alway.

I 
have a 
daughter of great renown, 
In the ballet she dances in a 
theatre up town; 
She's a 
darling to me, and so pretty you see, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She wears tarletaaa skirts all covered with tin, 
She's as an angel a 
soul without sin; 
She's a 
dancer, you see, in the tra-la-la-lee, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
CHORUS. 
She waltzes and pivots so neat on her toes, ( sym.) 
As 'round and ' round and ' round she goes; ( sym.) 
Now there's one thing sure I 
can't understand, 
Why her name on the bills should read 
Madam Du Rand, 
She high-tened wants to be, but she's Irish you see, 
And her right name is Biddy McGee. 
I 
taught her the skip, the hop, and the dip, 
To the tune of a 
fiddle around she would trip, 
She's of high degree, and takes after me, 
Doe's this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, though I.never could tell, 
Where she got it, or how, 'tis a 
mystery as well; 
For she's so full of glee, when dancing you see, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee, 
Chorus. 
SUNG BY NILES dr EVANS. 
AIR: BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTALNS. 
In a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and fair, 
Maiden with a 
yeller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cownes, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
! 
be spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yeller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouse., 
For the dog to chew that day.

There's no place on earth that so well suits

It's the Emerald isle where the shamrock is graft

And driven our daughters and sons to exile, 
For no one could stand their tyranic aggression.
