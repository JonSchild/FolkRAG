TAPE BEGINS WITH INTERVIEWER IN MID-SENTENCE:
D:  Saturday, February 13th.  And Doug DeNatale and Tom Rankin are in Haverhill, 
Massachusetts and we're talking with Mr. James (J:  C. Mavrick) C. Mavrick.  Mr. Mavrick can 
you spell your last name for us?
J:  Yeah.  M a v (D:  yes) r i c k.  
D:  Okay.  And with Mrs. Mavrick.  Mrs. Mavrick what is your first name?
E:  Eugenia.  (D:  Eugenia)  E u g e n i a.  (D:  Okay)
J:  J. Mavrick.  
D:  Let me start Mr. Mavrick just by asking you a little bit about your own family.  Where was 
your family originally from?  
J:  Oh yeah.  My family originally was from Sparta, Greece.  
E:  [Says words in Greece], because of religion. 
J:  And I have a copy with when I ran for office.  Says all about my father, you know what I 
mean.  I'll give it to you to see, you know what I mean?  [Greek words]  And he came from 
Greece, and he was working at the mills there, but the boss and everybody else, he always had 
some kind of like bazooki playing, you know what I mean?  And from that he turned to the 
violin.  And although my father, Constandinos Mavros is dead now about forty-eight years, I 
emphasize this, it's the truth.  We don't say, he's still the best violinist of all the Greeks in the 
United States, although he's dead forty-eight years.  In other words, when my father picked up 
the violin, if you had here a ring ten thousand dollars, you'd throw it in there and say, here, give 
me some money and I'll give you back to you.  Hold on to my ring.  He take it.  And what would 
my father do?  Right away if he thought that you were too dizzy, you had to much to drink, he'd 
find out where you live, or what [unclear] come the next day, go to get in the register, ring it and 
put the extra money.  And that's why he was always, everybody all over, you understand?  Get 
the idea? 
D:  I'm not quite sure.  
J:  In other words, he got the people so enthused, you know what I mean, and if you had a ring, 
then thousand dollars, you have the money.  (E:  For the dance)  He said, here, take this ring and 
give me $50.00 or $100.00 dollars I want to throw to Mr. Mavros.  When my father saw that 
somebody had probably drank too much and didn't know he was throwing money, he would go 
in the next day in your place, and put the extra money right into your register.  That's the kind of 
character.  And every time, the more he was doing it, the more that he was getting.  They loved 
him, do you understand?  (D:  Yes)  He wasn't a man to try to jip you.  You gave because you 
wanted to give. 
D:  And was it your father that came from Greece?
J:  Yes, my father came from Greece, and he became an American citizen and so on, like my wife
and my mother.  And he was very successful. 
E:  Excusa.  My mother-in-law is come for in my village too.
J:  Yes, the same place.  The mother-in-law.  (D:  Uh huh)  Yeah.
D:  And about what year was it that you father came over?
J:  [Asks question to Eugenia in Greek?]
E:  Maybe four?  Maybe my father in 1900?
D:  Right around the turn of the century.  
J:  Yes.  Yeah.  Right around the turn of the century, yes.  
D:  And what part of the country did he settle in when he came to the United States?
J:  He settled, I'm glad you asked that.  He settled in Lowell.  And that's where all the thousands 
of Greeks that came from Greece settled in Lowell.  That, that has the reputation, everybody 
came from Greece went to Lowell.  And from Lowell after they expanded, they went into the 
other cities.  But for Lowell was the first.  
D:  Why Lowell?
J:  Well they, something about it.  They felt you know, that all the Greeks were there.  You know 
what I mean?  You felt like a family affair.  You got the idea?
E:  There be somebody before [rest of comment unclear].
J:  Yes, and they brought everybody up here.  
E:  [Unclear] for the others too.
J:  Okay [unclear].  And then, then those days people loved one another.  They respected one 
another.  They cared for one another.  People would gather, fifty, one hundred women in a house.
My wife remembers, in a house, and they talk and they fix coffee, see.  Now nobody cares for 
anybody.  They've lost that, do you understand?  It's the truth.  It's the truth.  The moment, the 
moment today somebody gets a job and he makes money, puts on a new suit, I'm somebody.  Of 
course you're somebody.  But don't think that you don't need anybody.  They forget, that's what 
I'm trying to say.  See.  
D:  Well what, were you born in Lowell?
J:  I was born in Lowell, Mass. October 22, 1909.  
D:  1909.  
J:  You want to put on that light too, if you want to?
D:  I think this is fine.
T:  No, this is okay.
J:  Yeah, October 22, 1909.  
D:  Uh huh.  And what part of Lowell was your family from?
J:  I was born in 458 Adams Street.  That's called the Acre.  The Acre.  That's where all the 
Greeks were.  Now they spread a ways, see.
E:  But they're all from the park.
J:  Yeah.  Near the common.  
D:  Near the common.  Could you describe what the Acre was like back then when you were a 
child?
J:  Well the Acre, what I can visualize now, was one happy family.  The kids were [robust?] you 
know what I mean?  But they weren't, they weren't vandalistic like they are.  I'm talking about 
the bad ones, like today.  They, one particular person was jumping from one roof right across the 
other!  Things like that!  Unbelievable!  You'd bet your breath out!  But they wouldn't do nothing 
to break your windows, or break your car.  What they're doing today is terrible.  
D:  They would jump from one roof to another?  
J:  I saw them, yes!  
E:  I had my sisters that does it.  
J:  Jumping from one roof to the other.
E:  Jump day by day, my sister.
J:  So just one slip like that, it would have killed them.  But they had the nerve and they new how
to jump.  
D:  So they would, would they dare each other to do that, or?
J:  No, just one or two was doing that.  
D:  Just to show off?
J:  Yeah, but everybody couldn't do that.  Not the way he was jumping.  My God, I couldn't get 
my breath to even do that.
D:  Do you remember who that was who did that?
J:  No, I don't remember.  No.  No, if I did I forget.  
D:  What kind of things would you do as a child to amuse yourselves as you were growing up?
J:  Well first, first we're going to Greek School.  Greek School, Greek parochial school.  And 
there's where we learned the Greek language.  And at that time the teachers, even in American 
schools, were strict with kids.  You know what I mean?  And but today, today the kids, you can 
pick up a newspaper here.  They're high school kids smash the teachers teach and all.  Oh my 
God it's terrible!
You know?  You understand?  (D:  Uh huh)  It's that way.  They didn't have not respect, you 
know?  
D:  Yeah.  Mr. Mavrick I'm going to stop this tape recorder for just a minute, and check to make 
sure the recording is right, and I want to change the microphones a little bit.  
J:  All right.
D:  Uh, so we, we were talking about, I was asking you what kinds of things, what kinds of other
things did children do while you were young growing up in the Acre to entertain themselves?
J:  Well they'd go out in the common and play, you know what I mean?  Play baseball, or 
football, things like that.  But mostly they like to play "Releavo".  Releavo means they'd hide, 
you know what I mean?  They'd hide behind, and all of a sudden they're up here to chase them, 
see.  [Unclear], but they weren't.  They weren't vandalizing.  They weren't doing things like 
they're doing today.  
D:  That was called releavo?
J:  Yeah, something like that.  Playing "Hide and Seek", that's the better words.  (D:  Uh huh)  
"Hide and Seek", [unclear].
D:  Now when you were a child, how, how did you parents bring you up?  What kind of (--)
J:  Oh, my parents were very very strict.  My father was coming home just once a year, you 
know, because he was playing the violin all over the United States.  Then he come home in the 
summertime to relax and pick up just his fingers, exercising, you know what I mean?  Get the 
idea?  And but my wife, my mother was very very strict.  And every time you know, I said, 
what's the matter with my mother?  If a neighbor said, well your boy did that!  I'd get a slap in 
the face.  And I said, what do you mean?  Why do you believe everybody?  Am I always wrong? 
You get the idea?  (D: Right)  But still I don't despise my mother.  She made me into a strong 
character.  Get the idea?  She didn't make me to a baby, you know, fear.  Fear.
E:  Except, every parents come from the Europe here, special for America's good [help?].  Greek,
everybody.  Is there Greek people, Italia people, the others too.  [Comment unclear]
J:  All the nationalities, they were strict.  
E:  Today, the parents say, don't touch their kids.  [Comment unclear].
J:  Yeah, they say, they say child abuse.  But you don't hear anybody say about the abuse that the 
elders are getting?  You know it, you read it.  They knock them down.  They smash their teeth.  
Grab the pocketbook with two or three dollars, you know what I mean?  
D:  Did you have chores when you were a child?
J:  Oh yes.  I had to, I had, it was learned to wash the dishes, you know what I mean, wipe them, 
get the idea, and sweep around.  Do my part.  Yes.  
D:  What kind of a living arrangement did you have?  Was it a house, an apartment, or?
J:  No it was, it was a, it was an apartment.  It was just you rented a house, you know what I 
mean.  See, you rented a house.  
D:  Was it one family in a house, or [unclear]?
J:  Let's see, 158, 158, I think, I think there was two.  Two.  Yeah, we weren't just all alone, no.  
Two, two families.  
D:  Uh huh.  Well now your father, so he made his living pretty much as a professional musician?
J:  Oh, he made a living period, as a professional.  He made thousands, about thousand dollars.  
Easy come, easy go.  You know what I mean?  Get the idea?  If you see somebody when he come
home once a year, he'd be out on the park, he'd see somebody shabby.  He didn't know it.  He 
didn't know whether he was Greek, or Irish, or French.  He'd go right up there, hello.  And stuff 
his pockets with dollar bills.  Very generous my father.  
D:  What was your father's name?
J:  Constantine.  C o n s, C o n s, C o n s t i n o s, Constinos.  Constinos.  They used to call him 
Mavros.  Mavros.  M a v r o s.  
D:  M a v r o s.  
J:  Yeah.  Constos Mavros.  Mavros.  (D:  I see)  Because our right name was very hard to 
pronounce.  G e  o  r g a c o p o u l o s.  Fourteen letters, Georgacopoulos.  And my, nobody 
could say.  Instead of saying Georgacopoulos, hello Poulos.  Poulos.  So he changed his to 
Mavros.  Yeah.
T:  He changed his name to Mavros?
J:  Yeah.  See, he came home.
E:  You know why?  It's just for my father-in-law, for the mother, [few words unclear].  
[Comment unclear].
J:  He came home one time kind of tired and he said, where's the Mavros?  Where was Mavros?  
And that name stuck to him.  
D:  Huh.  So that happened when he came to the United States?
J:  Yes.  Right.  Right.
D:  Where did he learn to play the violin?
J:  He learned to play the violin himself.  After he took lessons.  He learned to play the violin.  
While he was working at the mill he used to have kind of a broom.
E:  For the broom, plays the violin.  [speaks with a very pronounced Greek accent]
J:  Pretend he, not the violin Eugenia, please, not the violin, bazooki, you know, he thought.  But 
then he played a little bit bazooki, he left that and he picked up the violin.  He was, he excelled in
violin.  Others, you know what I mean, some violinists, good violinists, small mind.  They were 
jealous.  But my father said, why they want to be jealous?  They don't practice, you know what I 
mean?  My father was practicing.  He'd go up in a little room and excuse me, in a toilet closed.  
So he didn't want anybody, he wouldn't open the door.  That's why he learned the violin.
E:  Excuse me.  This is the piano belonged to my father-in-law. 
J:  Oh yes.  That's a piano from Chicago.  They gave, gave that all the way from Chicago, they 
gave a present to my father.
D:  My goodness. 
E:  And then my father-in-law closed the lights, (J:  goes to what?) for the lights.  (J:  What 
lights?)  He's at home.  Closed for the lights, (J:  oh he closed the lights.  That's it.  Go ahead!)  
play, play the piano.
D:  He could play the piano with his eyes closed.  
J:  Yes.  Oh jeese.
E:  [Unclear]
D:  Uh huh.
J:  He could shake that piano into cords and everything.  
D:  Well now when was it that he worked in the mill?
J:  Well he worked in the mill when he first came from Greece, but he didn't stay long because he
started on the violin.  And he was playing the coffee houses, and he was playing at dances and so
on.  Then he left.  He traveled all over the United States.  
D:  Was he working in the mill when you were born?  
J:  Yeah, when I was born he was working, but he didn't stay long.  As soon as he learned the 
violin he left the mill, because (--)  
T:  Did you say he played the violin while he was at the mill?  I mean in the mill?
J:  No, not in the mill.  (T:  Not in the mill)  No, no, no.  
D:  But you said he practically, he was, what, was he a sweeper?
J:  No, he was on the line, you know what I mean?  Where things come and you (--)
T:  Yeah.
D:  Do you remember which mill it was?
J:  Let me see.  I don't recall it now.  Boott Mill. 
D:  You said he would practice (--)
J:  Boott Mills was there.  Yeah, maybe he was in the Boott Mills.  
D:  Maybe, yeah.
J:  Yeah, the Boott Mills, it was big rooms there.
D:  But you said that he practice the fingering for the bazooki while he was sweeping?  
J:  Yeah, yeah.  The boss said, what the heck is he doing.  Are you going to work, or are you 
going to play?  You got the idea?  And then he, as soon as he started the violin he left.  He never 
went back.  He didn't have to go back.  
D:  Did he play by himself, or did he play with other musicians?  
J:  No, he played, when he started playing he'd get others, you know what I mean?  Get the idea? 
And oh, incidentally, in Texas, I forget what part of Texas, a church was built.  And he played.  A 
lot of people went there, and he gave, donated his services, and he enthused so many people.  
And they threw so much money in the ground and the church was built by my father.  He used to 
be a very generous person.  
D:  So he started by playing in the coffee houses?  
J:  Coffee houses.  But after he expanded, and he toured American.  You know what I mean?  He 
played in coffee houses, weddings, dances, you know what I mean?  See? 
D:  Now I've heard about the coffee houses, but I really don't know very much about it. 
J:  Well the coffee houses was an outlet.  I'm glad you brought that up.  Was an outlet for the 
Greeks.  Where could they go?  You know what I mean?  They, they weren't speaking fluently, 
you know what I mean?  And they felt, you know, felt kind of reserved, ashamed of broken 
English.  So they'd go to the Coffee Houses.  And the Coffee House was always filled up.  And 
you go in and say, hello, how's the wife, you know?  How's the family?  And that was a place to 
meet, you know what I mean?
D:  Where were the Coffee Houses in Lowell?
J:  There were Coffee Houses where, mostly Market Street.  Market Street.  Well known.  Market
Street.  Coffee Houses, there were a lot of them.  
D:  Can you name any of the (--)  Did they have individual menus?  
J:  I can't remember now.  You know what I mean?  They had, I can't remember, you know.  
Different names of Coffee Houses, you know, [unclear], Greek Coffee Houses.  But they, 
hundreds would gather there.  When you wanted to find somebody, go to the coffee house?  Just 
like if you wanted to go to the basketball game, where is he.  He's gone to see the Celtics.  (D:  
Umhm)  Incidentally, did you see the Celtics game last night?
T:  I did.
J:  Oh my God what a (--)  He is the best player in the world!
T:  Yeah!  It was incredible, wasn't it?
J:  Incredible!  Even he got so excited.  
T:  I know, he was [unclear].
J:  He does it, see.  
T:  He doesn't always do that.
J:  Huh?
T:  He doesn't often [unclear].
J:  No, he doesn't often, because you know what I mean?  The man's, he is the greatest basketball
player, because his mind, you know what I mean?  He works, he so alert that fellow.  And he's a 
team man, see.  His team mates went crazy!  Went crazy!  
T:  Yeah, they did.
E:  Is that my father-in-law.
J:  Yeah, that's, yeah, I'm glad she brought it.
T:  Oh wow!  
J:  You'll see his picture here, see?  
T:  Good gosh!  Where is that taken?  
J:  [Asks question in Greek to wife]
E:  Somewhere for the North Carolina, somewhere.  [Unclear]
J:  Let me see it Eugenia.  [Unclear]
E:  Somebody pay that, for my pay me for the pictures too.
D:  Oh my God.
E:  Yup
D:  Oh you can see he's an artist.  You can see he's very temperamental.  
E:  [Comment unclear]
J:  Temperamental.  Sometimes you know, he was playing in a place, and while he was playing, 
everybody listening.  Somebody was talking out loud, he said, listen, get out!  Oh yeah!  Yeah.  
Where is he.
D:  It's a wonderful photograph.  He looks a lot like you.  
E:  My father-in-law.  
J:  Yes.  Yes.  Right.  (T:  That's your mother-in-law?)  See, this is in the Santouri.  
E:  [Comment unclear-all speaking at once]
D:  I was going to ask about that?  
J:  That's called a Santouri.  S a n t o u r i.  Santouri.
D:  Okay.  Well that's an instrument I know as the hammer dulcimer.  
J:  Yes, that's what it is.  And then this other one here is Laouto.  L a, la,  L a o u, laou, t o Laouto,
Laouto.  
E:  [Few words unclear] for the guitar.
J:  Yeah.  Something like a guitar.  You can just play cords, you can play melody.  And that, that's
a very good strong base accordion, you know what I mean?  Get the idea?  That Laouto, very 
good.  And you can see, first of all it's a happy wedding, but you can see, they know, you know 
what I mean, that they're in for a good time.  
D:  Yeah, that's a wonderful photograph.  Of course I'd like to make a copy of that.  
J:  Yes.  You can huh?
D:  Yeah, he can just take a photograph.
J:  Oh, is that so?  Yes.?
T:  Yeah.  
D:  Now did your father usually travel around with those other musicians?
J:  Well if they didn't want to come, he'd pick up others, because he was the leader.  So if the 
others couldn't play, you know what I mean, he's say, all right.  You're not so for experience.  All 
I want you to play is dan, dada dum bum, bumba bumba, bum, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
yeah.  My father played.  All he wanted the base.  Dumdi dadum dum, baba, baba, bum.  Dedia, 
dedia, dedidi.  Yeah.  See the one, yeah!  See, he'd play like that.  He'd take your heart right out.  
You'd throw everything to him.  That's what I'm trying to say.  
E:  Is the Greek music, he had the classical besides.  [Unclear comments]
D:  Was it a particular style of music that your father played?
J:  Oh yeah.  Inevitable.  Nobody could play like my father.  Inevitable.
D:  But what kind of music did he play?
J:  Well he played [word unclear=sings in Greek].  Ralph, where are you darling?  [Sings in 
Greek]  Where were you?  See?  [E:  speaks at same time, comment unclear]  But the expression!
Get the idea? The way I sing.  That's why I want (--)
E:  [Few words unclear] for the dance.  [Comment unclear]  I make it myself.
J:  My wife made that herself by hand.  
E:  Needlepoint.
J:  Okay Eugenia, let me tell the story.
D:  Did he, did he sing?  (J:  huh?)  Did he sing.  
J:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well he wasn't.  He could sing, but he wasn't, he didn't excel in singing like I do.
He didn't have too.  You know, he didn't even have to.  
D:  Well where did he learn his tunes then? 
J:  He learned, he learned them himself, you know what I mean?
D:  I mean did he make them up, or did he learn them from other people?
J:  No, he remembers from Greece they used to play and he made them up.  Get the idea?  And of
course he probably composed songs [unclear].
D:  Did his songs have names?
E:  Yes.  
J:  Huh?  What names.  [Speaks in Greek]
E:  [Speaks in Greek, gives names]
J:  Yes.  There's different types of dance.  [Unclear] is one.
E:  Different dance for the other.  
J:  Different steps, you know? 
E:  [Speaks in Greek]
J:  He'd play and Irish, my father would play an Irish Jig, you never thought he was Greek.  He 
knew.  Get the idea?  
D:  Could you describe the different kinds of dances there were?
J:  Yes.  All right.  That time it go [sings in Greek], where were you, I've been looking all over 
for you?  That's one dance.  It goes like that.  Then the other one, [sings in Greek].  Different 
step, get the idea?  Different.  [Continues to sing in Greek]  Different, see?  
D:  What was that kind of (--)
J:  [Says in Greek]  Then the other one is [Greek].  [James and Eugenia are conversing in Greek 
in background]  All right.  This is [says name in Greek and begins to sing].  Before I got married 
I didn't have any white hair, see.  Get the idea?  And that's the [unclear].  See?  And now the 
other one.  [Sings in Greek]  I'm going to get somebody new, somebody young, you see?  And 
that's just (--)  And then everybody dances that.  [Claps and sings in Greek], will [unclear] to me,
but my old man will be out working.
E:  [Speaking in Greek]
J:  That is called a [Greek word].  [Greek word], yeah.
[E & J: converse in Greek]
D:  Now are those, those are dances that were brought over from Greece?  
J:  Oh yes.  Yes.  Sure.  
D:  Did they come from particular regions of Greece?
J:  Oh they came, they came from [Greek name], they came from Sparta, they came from Athens.
(E:  Peloponesis)  Peloponesis.  (E:  Mecedonia)  Mecedonia and Peloponesis is the Islands, you 
know?  Get the idea?  Yes.  The Greeks are very music oriented.  
D:  The Greeks in Lowell, were they from any particular kind of, type of(--)  I'm sorry, were they
from any particular region of Greece?  Or were they from all over Greece?  
J:  [Asks the question to Eugenia in Greek]
E:  [Speaks in Greek]
J:  Most of them came from Sparta.  Yeah, Sparta.  [Greek word]
E:  Is that my village.
J:  Yeah, her village.  [Village name], Sparta, Greece.  They came from there.  And that's why I 
want to re-emphasize what my wife said.  In that [Greek town], small little town, poor, the best 
doctors came there.  Engineers.  From a small town with no money at all.  
E:  And the lawyers.
J:  But they studied.  They had brains.  (E:  Teachers)  Yeah.  Yeah.  Teachers.  Yeah, teachers.
E:  And they continue too.  
J:  And they continue.  It's remarkable.
E:  Is the my family, I [unclear] two brothers, and two sisters.  She have eleven kids.  Except 
two, everybody others educated.  
J:  Oh some of the Greeks, some of the Greeks know seven, eight languages.  
E:  I get my cousin, he speak twelve language.
J:  Eighty-one, twelve languages.  Twelve languages.  
D:  The men that your father would travel on, the other musicians, do you remember the names 
of any of those people?
J:  No, they're probably all dead now, and I don't remember the name.  Wait a minute.  
[E&J:  both speak in Greek]
J:  Well there was one other violin player, he traveled with my father.  [Name in Greek]  Very 
good, very good.  (E:  Salem, Massachusetts)  Salem, Massachusetts.  Very good violin player.  
But he was saying there's nobody like(--)  (E:  And John Caravoras)  John?  (E:  Caravoras)  
What is John Caravoras?  (E:  unclear)  What did he do here?  (E:  To play violin)  Oh yeah, John
Caravoras.  (E:  he had one, one violin for you father)  Oh yeah. Oh yes.  There was one man, 
he's dead now, we were living in Haverhill.  He used to play violin.  And he bought the violin 
from my father.  And this Mr. Janas, excellent violin player.  (E:  says something in Greek)  Wait 
a minute.  We had an excellent violin player, but he was telling everybody he is the king.  Very 
good violin player, this Janas, but not like my father.  Because my father had very, made great 
progress, you know what I mean.  He was starting to figure he knew the cord.  He knew (--)  So 
when you know the cords, you got the idea?  Like now, for two months I'm studying the 
accordion, and I'm doing very very good at my age.  Now when I, with patients, I'm going to 
give myself one year.  And just as soon as you learn where the bases are, di dada dum bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum.  When I learn these bases, you know what I mean?
E:  Years ago they have for the Santouri, now they starting for the dance.  Santouri [unclear].
J:  I told them about the Santouri.  Okay.  Now the accordion.  With patients now, now I'm going 
to learn the accordion, because I had too many things.  I was distracted, you know what I mean?  
Hey, Mr. Mavrick, come over here.  I'd get involved.  I was always a concerned, sincere 
concerned citizen.  Always fighting for the underdog.  I've helped people.  Always fight for them.
And I was neglected myself.  Now when I have the patients, and I'm going to have the patients, 
just one year of this accordion, I'll be able, and I want to you emphasize, I'll be able to pick this 
accordion.  And when I can, I copy myself on the cords, go any part of the world, sit down and 
sing, I'm going to make myself a dollar.  Just like, just like, I'm going to be just like the famous 
street singer in New York, remember?  Street singer, he became famous.  He was playing the 
accordion on the streets.  Yes.  Because I have, I have the person, I have the personality, see.  
And not only, now there's other people, there's people very good looking for the movies, but they
haven't got, you know what I mean?  But they're good looking, but they haven't got the 
personality to sell the thing.  Now with the accordion, de di didi didi bum.  [Chants in Greek].  
When I can learn that accordion, when it will learn, I can go any part of the world, sit down and 
make myself a lot of money.  But it isn't the money.  It makes me happy to make others happy.  
That's what I want to point out.  
E:  [Comment unclear]
J:  They didn't have accordion then, no.  
E:  [Speaks Greek]
J:  Oh yes, well they didn't have any instruments certain times my wife said, they'd go into a 
picnic, a good time, or a wedding, and they'd be singing, how many hours without stopping?  
E:  For they start for night for the morning.
J:  They'd start at night, in the morning they'd break up.  Just imagine to stay together without 
any music, and all would be singing and dancing.  Now that's, that is no easy task you know.  
D:  Would they be singing dance tunes?  
J:  Yes, yes!  (D:  How would they do that?  Do they have words?)  They'd all be singing 
together, see?  
D:  Were there words to them, or? 
J:  Oh yes!, of course words.  [Speaks to his wife in Greek] 
D:  Can you remember any of those?
J:  Oh yes, sure.  [Speaks to wife in Greek].
E:  [Sings a song in Greece, James sings along with her]
J:  Oh yeah, they're very enticing, those songs.  [Eugenia still sings]  Another song now.  That's 
enough!  Now listen to me, that's why I get mad, see!  [Says something in Greek]  Another song. 
Okay.
E:  [Eugenia sings in Greek]  
J:  That's different, see?  [Both sing together]  Now another song, another song!  Go ahead.  
[Eugenia sings another song-James sings along]  [Tape fades out] 
R052
Tape begins with sound of Eugenia singing Greek music, sounds more like a chant.
J:  Okay.  It was saying [D:  Wow, that's beautiful!], the song was saying to the Turks, hold back 
the horses, you know what I mean?  Our young people are going to fight you.  We want liberty, 
see.
D:  Is that a long song?
E:  Yeah.
J:  Yeah, it's a long song. 
D:  It would be nice to record though.  We have some time left.  For our first box, is it around?  
J:  I hope we're not boring you?
T:  No.  (D:  Not at all)  In fact it's wonderful.  
D:  We'd like to go as long as you will.  Um, let's see.  Were there some songs that were men 
songs, and some songs that were women songs?  
J:  [Speaks to wife in Greek]
E:  [Answers in Greek]
J:  They're all combined together.  [Says something in Greek]  They're all combined together.  In 
other words, with the love and the heartbreak (E:  says something in Greek) all together.  
E:  Yeah.  [Unclear] beautiful women, the women.  The beautiful men [unclear], yeah.  
D:  I meant to get the spelling on a couple of things.  (J:  Yes)  What is the spelling of your home 
town?  
J:  Vamvakou, V A M  (E:  Repeats, Vamvakou)  All right, spell it.  (E:  [unclear], one minute)  V 
(E:  wait a minute)  Go ahead, (speaks in Greek).  
D:  And what's, how do you spell the instrument the hammerdulcimer?
J:  Santouri, S a n t o u r i, Santouri.  
D:  Okay, and the other instrument, the string instrument?
J:  The other instrument that I said, they use it more than a guitar, Laouto, L a o u t o, Laouto.  
That's very good base, do you know what I mean?  While the others are playing melody, the base
holds out.  
E:  Is my village, capital V a  m v a k o u, Vanmvakou.  
J:  Say it again, say it again.  V a?
E:  V a m v a k o u.
J:  Oh, V a m , Vamvakou.  (D:  Vamvakou)
E:  I went to night school three years here.  
J:  Yeah, and some people come from Greece, and they don't go to night school, they don't want 
to learn the language, see.  
D:  Well Mr Mavrick, let me go back to asking you a little bit about your family.  Did you have 
any brothers or sisters?  
J:  Oh yes, oh yes.  I'm glad you did.  I have living, there's nobody dead, so thank God.  I have 
one brother, Phil Georges.  (E:  Spiros)  Phil, all right Spiros, okay.  [Unclear] Eugenia, don't 
make stories [unclear].   (E:  Says something in Greek)  Phil, Phil was Spiros Georges.  He went 
to the service in Italy, and if he wasn't wounded, he would have been picked to go to the best 
college.  He could through a forward pass from here to Boston.  A tremendous football player.  
But then he got injured, you know what I mean?  But he took it in stride.  Now we have another 
brother, Leonard Georges.  He has played with Marlow Brando, he played a lot of character 
parts, you know what I mean?  Very good.  Marlow Brando.  He played in gang busters, this 
Leonard Georges.  Am I going to fast?  (D:  No)  Now we have a sister, Helen Georges, Helen 
Georges.  She has played, and continues to play about forty-five, forty seven years she plays the 
organ at the Transfiguration Church in Lowell.  She is the best.  Yes.  But then of course I've 
done, I've given two concerts in Lowell, and the second concert was 1946, over 700 people and a
$1.20 a ticket.  And I, and I got, I rented the biggest place, the Lowell Memorial Auditorium.  It 
was very very successful.  A lot of Americans came then, and I was, made a big hit.
D:  How many brothers and sisters in all were in were in the family?
J:  Two brothers and myself is three, and my sister is four.  Three brothers and one sister, and my 
late mother.  (D:  I see, uh huh)  And my father. 
D:  And your father was able to support the family of these?
J:  Oh, he was, he was able to support the family just on his violin.  Oh yes!
D:  Uh huh.  How about your mother?  What did she do?
J:  My mother was mostly at home, you know what I mean?  When my, when my father died, 
she, then she went to work in the shoe shop a little bit.  But she, before she didn't have to.  
D:  When we it that your father died?
J:  About forty-eight, about forty-eight years.  
E:  1929.  
J:  That's right.  1929.  Thank you, he died.
E:  He was 45 years old.
J:  45?  (E:  Yeah) 
D:  How did, when he traveled, how did he, did he just go to another community and get a 
singing job there, or did he have his jobs ahead of time?  
J:  Once he went there, he went to the coffee house, they heard a marvelous, great violin player is
going to be here tomorrow night.  They packed the place, you know what I mean, see?  And they 
won't let him go.  He'd probably stay there even a month, weddings, things like that.  He was a 
big man, big man.  
D:  Was it just the Greek communities that he would go to?
J:  Yeah, yeah.
E:  Is there my father-in-law teach [few word unclear].  He have a lot of books.  
J:  Yeah, I told them, I told them that.  
E:  For the Office of the United States, for the History, anything, I have the books.  
J:  Then after he studied [unclear].
D:  He died at a pretty young age it sounds to me.
J:  Yeah, he died. 
E:  45 years old.
J:  45 years of age.  
D:  And that was right at the beginning of the depression too.
J:  Exactly, exactly. 
D:  It must have been hard on your family?
J:  Yes, exactly.  And that's why I didn't make the progress I should have made, you know what I 
mean?  Because I thought too much, you know what I mean?  If I was greedy and said, what the 
heck, well I'm going to look after myself, I couldn't do that.  I'm artistically inclined, I can't do a 
thing like that, see?  
D:  So you were about twenty-years old at that point, is that right?
J:  [Speaks to Eugenia in Greek]  Yes, you're right.  
D:  Were you working by that time?
J:  Oh yeah, I had to.  Working!  I was working in the shoe shop and then I was working in a 
shoe shop all week.  And then when I got through from work, I'd get on my bicycle and I'd 
deliver telegrams for two days.  Telegrams, get an answer, come back, make some extra money.  
Yes.  I worked hard.  
E:  Shine shoes too.
J:  And I would shine shoes too.  I worked, I worked.  (E:  he worked)  Yup.  Yup.  
D:  Was the family still in Lowell at this time?  
J:  Oh yes, yes.  Sure.  
D:  What uh, what were some of the other neighborhoods in Lowell?
J:  Cross Street.  Cross Street.  The Greeks were there, Cross Street.  Market Street of course, that
was the, (--)  Dummer Street, Dummer Street.  That's where they have today the Democratic 
Club, Dummer Street.  I'm glad you asked me.  
E:  Willie Street.  (J:  huh?)  Willie Street over there.  (J:  Where?)  Willie Street.  (J:  Willie 
Street)  Willie Street, yeah.
J:  Yeah, okay.  Willie Street.  That's all of (--)
E:  [Comment unclear]
D:  Where did some of the other ethnic live?  Where did the French and the Irish live?
J:  The French [rest of comment in Greek].
E:  I don't know.
J:  Well I'll tell you, the French too, because they intermingled with the Greeks, you know?  They
were all around there.
E:  Some other times you have for your neighbor for the Greeks one time, you have the French, 
you have the somebody else, you know?  
J:  Then after you mean when they got on their feet they settled, and bought homes in (--)
E:  My sister-in-law go three years for the, six years for the French language.  And my 
brother-in-law.
J:  Oh yes, my sister, my sister that plays the organ, she, my father sent my brother and my sister,
and she graduate from French School, so she know English, Greek and French.
E:  Both together for the French School.  Greek, the Greeks and French too.  
J:  So she went to the French school?
D:  So she went to the French school?
J:  Yeah, she graduated from French.
D:  Which school was that?
E:  I don't know.
J:  Saint Joseph's, Saint Joseph's French School in Lowell.  Yeah.
D:  Oh.  How did she happen, how can they go there?
J:  Well my father insisted.  My father wanted to(--)
E:  Take another language for the kids to use it for educate.  
J:  To take another language, to become more educated.  And my brother, Leonard Georges, he 
graduated from the French School.  Excellent speaking!  Oh my God!  
E:  Is there my daughter speak one language [unclear].
J:  We have twin girls.
E:  My first daughter speaks Greek, English, Russian and French. The other (J:  and my, my 
daughter), excuse me for the second speak for the Greek, English, Italian and Latin too.  (J:  And 
Russian)  Maria.  (J:  Oh Maria)  Georgia take it for the Latin.  
J:  And Maria, Maria (E:  A Professor for UMass Amherst) she is the Professor from last year, 
teaches French and Russian, but she excels in Russian.  
E:  [Comment unclear].
J:  Athenia Greeks, but she has been teaching now a year in Amherst, Russian and French.  (D:  
That's wonderful)  And my other daughter Georgia Mavrick, she graduated, she's a physical 
therapist?  (E:  no)  What does she do?  (E:  Therapist)  Therapist.  All right, physical therapist.  
(E:  No, it's different)  It's different?  (E:  Yeah)  Okay, a therapist.
E:  Starting for the doctor, [unclear].  You get therapist, this year '87, last May, they give her the 
Head Nurse Diploma.  
J:  She got a diploma.  She's a head nurse.  We helped her all we could.  But we didn't get help 
through depression that we gave them.  See.
E:  Well how did the, how did the different ethnic groups get along back then?
J:  Well I'll tell you, I'm glad you mentioned that.  The ethnic groups, they had a big fight.  Oh 
my God, what a fight!  You know, some people with a bad mouth, "God damn Greek", "God 
damn Irish", "God damn French", all those filthy words, you know.  And finally the Greeks had 
those push carts you know, push carts trying to make a living.  Hey, other nationalities passed by,
Irish especially would knock you down.  And so finally they got fed-up and they gathered, I 
remember I was young, my God Almighty!  I'll never forget that.  They gathered the North 
Common with clubs, iron, guns, what a fight!  And after that they became friends.  I see.  Get the
idea.  Why do you want to say, "God damn Irish?"  It's no good.  Why do you want to say "God 
damn Greek?"  
E:  Because nobody teach for the self.  Because for the America, nobody's really America, except
for the Indians.  But they get people.  Nobody knows [unclear].  Nobody know for the language. 
Why?  [J & E:  speak to each other in Greek]  (J:  Okay)  Because they really, (J:  You explain 
this really good) I don't care how many generations are born here.  I'm really Greek.  Is the my 
kids, it's the second generations are born here.  But they says you dirty Irish, you dirty Greek.  I 
don't know why you don't teach for the self.  (J:  Okay, you made your point Eugenia)  Is the 
point, because you have to fight.
J:  Okay.  You said it!  That's why I say, okay.
D:  Do you remember getting into any fights when you were a kid?
J:  Yes, small, small fights, yeah, but the big fight was at the North Common.  My God 
Almighty!  That, I want to get it out of my mind.  It was just horrible.
D:  Did you see it?
J:  Oh yes!  I saw it.  Oh my God!  I did see it.  I did see it.
E:  You have to group together, you know?  
J:  Hitting, big groups, Greeks and Irish, with clubs and oh my God!
T:  Where were you when you watched it?
J:  In the common!  Because I heard, "big big fight.  Big fight!"  A big crowd.  Terrible!  Terrible!
T:  But you stayed on the outside of it?
J:  Well Jesus, I got scared.
T:  [Laughs]
J:  Sure, of course!  Of course!  [All laughs]
E:  [Makes comment in Greek]
J:  We see it now, and we haven't learned a lesson, all of us.  You've heard what's happened in 
Amherst?  Now the Black people taking over Amherst, because a Black man, and I saw him on 
TV, very very intelligent, walking a White girl.  So what?  What are you going to(--)  [Unclear]  
He can walk with a White girl.  What is this?  He didn't force the girl.  Get the idea?  [Unclear]  I 
don't know what we're coming to.  
D:  Were there, what did people say about the other groups?  Were there jokes about them, or 
anything like that?
J:  Oh yeah, they were saying the dirty God damn Greeks.  You know what I mean.  See.  Yeah.  
Yeah.
E:  You be back in your country.
J:  Go back to your country.  That's what my wife (E:  Yeah, because you have the country there),
that's what my wife wants to explain, see?  Only the Indians can really say they're Americans.  
Not all of us.  Get the idea.
E:  I come here, I go to night school [rest of comment unclear].  That year I had my daughters, 
three months old, I kept my husband, I kept the music store.  [Comment unclear] 
J:  Oh yeah, we had a music store.  Mavrick's Music Store for thirteen years.
E:  Just the same I'd go to night school after to get my (--) And my kids, I teach them myself.
J:  Oriental Music Store [unclear].
E:  You know, it was so much hard, you know.  I says, says everybody for the America people, I 
say, why?  I'm Greek, Israeli Greek.  I says, why you says for the American?  Israeli is the 
[unclear], nobody else.
J:  Well we said that Eugenia.  That's why I get mad, see.  We've said that.  Yeah.
E:  But I look for the history, for the India, for the America too,  (J:  Okay) here.  I like to teach 
to myself [unclear].  He's come for the Pilgrims here, my teacher teach me from the high school, 
from my village.  [Comment unclear]  For the history, for the Europe, for the Asian, (J:  That's 
enough Eugenia) for the big history.
J:  And my wife, at the [unclear] when they have meetings, you know, she has made a name for 
herself.  And they [unclear].  And she has brought out points that the manufacturer at the meeting
said, "I'm proud of you.  A Greek decendent, you get up and give us those answers."  Because 
she brought up a point.  Why is it when I, when my wife and others, were doing good work never
said nothing.  All of a sudden, all of a sudden the work became bad, you noticed that.  Why did it
get bad?  I complained to the office and to the overseer so many times that there was a dumb bell
there, a dumb bell playing the radio so loud she couldn't even hear what she was doing at the 
factory.  He said, "I'm proud of you."  Yes.  I give her credit.  
E:  [Cannot transcribe her comment]
J:  She told him.  Then he grabbed [unclear].  I said, put it on the radio and just have it on one ear
so you can hear.  He didn't listen so they took the radio away from him.  See.
D:  Actually,  that's what I wanted to ask you back when you first started working.  What was it 
like in the shoe factories?  
J:  Oh, in the shoe factories, yes, I'm glad you asked that.  In the shoe factory, they were taking 
advantage of the worker, because certain manufacturers, now we have a lot of manufacturers, 
they're good people today in America, they were very very greedy.  Very very greedy.  And I'll 
tell you how greedy they were.  They underpaid the workers, and they wanted so much from 
them, and not only that, they were making enough money still, the quality of the shoe they went 
out of business, and they said on account of the worker's strike.  No, it wasn't the workers.  They,
the good shoe that they were selling, they started making cheap, putting cheap material, then they
want our business.  But they always blame the workers.  See.
E:  Yeah.  Today especially for the shoes for the Americas no good, because you don't have the 
leather.  Mix them.  Everybody today have the trouble for fit, because they're shoes no good.  
Years ago I remember at one of my house, my father because it was a nice day, they have the 
shoes for the America.  You think [rest of comment unclear].  Too soft.  Today it's just too rough. 
Special they're using now for the rubber every, every shoes.  They're shoes are no good for the 
foot too.  [Unclear]
D:  Was there mostly Greek working in the shoe factories in Lowell?
J:  Yes, Greeks.  Mostly Greeks, and Frenchmen, you know.  All these nationalities.  They had to 
go to work.  You got to go to work somewhere.  
D:  What was the shoe factory you worked in?
J:  Well there was a shoe factory was Model Shoe.  Oh, what a shoe shop!  Model Shoe.  Model 
Shoe was an excellent Shoe Shop.  They were making good shoes, you know what I mean, 
expensive.  Get the idea?  They went out of business, because they, again, you know the 
greediness, they start cutting down the quality and charge the same price.  They went out of 
business. 
D:  Did you, Mrs. Mavrick did you work in (E:  Shoe shop?  No).  Where did you work?  
E:  I worked for my music store here.  
J:  We had a music store, oriental music store, thirteen years.
E:  [Few words unclear] before I marry.  I worked for the Star Market, Newton, Massachusetts.  
T:  You did?  You worked in Newton.
J:  Well let me tell you.  One second.  (E:  worked for the shelf, for the shelf) I don't want to 
forget it.  Not only that.  But my wife working here first in Western Electric, then AT&T, she's 
been laid off twice.  Now this is the last time, she just started working two weeks ago.  Two three
weeks ago.  And at the age of seventy my friend, they call her back.  They don't call you back 
even if you're fifty.  Why?  Because she gives you a dollar for your work.  You know what I 
mean?  The others, the others, if I was a boss I'd throw them right through that window.  Every 
ten minutes they'd go to the bathroom.  
E:  Except for the special job.  [Unclear] trim for the quality, use them for the telephone, for the 
small, for little pieces, you know.  I make it myself.  [Unclear] I go for the computers.  First test, 
[unclear] test, final test.  [Unclear]
J:  [Unclear] all that, you don't have to say that.  It's the fact remains that you're a good worker, 
see, and that's why they called you back at the age of seventy, seven.  
T:  You work in Quality Control?
E:  Yes.  I work three years for the Dunkin Donuts.  (T:  Uh huh)  I don't know how many months
ago.  Every day, yeah.  I be a very good waitress.  
J:  Even there, even there people say, wait a minute, where is she?  Well she's not here, no.  I'll 
wait.  [Comment unclear], they said, this is for you, the tip.  Because she really takes care of 
them.  (E:  Nobody take the tip.  I take it myself [unclear].  She does the job good.  I give her 
credit.  The only thing I tell her, don't keep repeating, you know what I mean?  
E:  I remember every customer with the ticket.  (J:  Yeah, she remembers)  Before I take the 
ticket I [unclear].  Now, [unclear] my job, I have the color woman that comes from the 
Dominican Republic.  (T:  Uh huh)  I saw before [unclear], but I says, what your names?  Say, 
Anna.  He's come from the South America?  Say yes.  Why you know me?  We got together for 
the English here for the library seventeen years before.  I remember who it is.  
T:  Is that right?
J:  And they all know her [unclear] of working, Mama, Mama.  They love her.  Because I'll tell 
you why.  Please Eugenia, I'll tell you why they love her.  My wife can say a little joke that you 
think [unclear].  She can say a joke, but the way she says it, you know, what I mean?  Get the 
idea.
E:  And I forget.  I work for twelve years Cross Guard here.  I take for the test of Lowell, 1970, 
myself, yeah.
J:  She was a crossing guard, and there was a State Trooper rushing right down.  (E:  I whistle, he
said, excuse me)  Let me tell the story.  (E:  Say pull it aside) Okay.  All right.
E:  Say, you tell me?  I say yes.  You broke the violation.  He says, I go to my work.  You put 
your lights, your siren [unclear].  But I says you come the next time I arrest you.  Is the my job 
here.
J:  My wife said, I'm in a hurry, State Trooper.  I don't care what you are, you give me the signals 
you're in a hurry, and I'll open up the, but you're not going to go right through and kill the kids.  
T:  Yeah.
E:  Is here.  I had to fight for the position too.  
J:  Okay, that's enough.  [Unclear]
E:  Because I like to help every pedestrian.  (T:  yeah)  Every people, except for the kids, for the 
others too.  For the Cross Guard, [unclear] their uniform.  Don't take somebody else for the 
uniform to work my job.
J:  Eugenia, you explained.  All your stories, you explain Eugenia, please.  
E:  [Speaks Greek]
J:  In other words she's a very concerned citizen.  She doesn't just sleep on a job.  A lot of them 
you see Crossing Guards, have you seen them?  No.  They don't care whether kids pass.  They 
only wait Friday to get the check.  But my wife is not like that.  See, I give her credit.  
E:  Except for every job, there's something different.  Special for the [unclear] for the people.  I 
remember the many times for the people [rest of comment unclear].  [Comment unclear]
D:  Well how about, so music just runs in the family?
J:  It certainly does.  
E:  It's in my family too.
J:  Yeah go ahead.  I'm going to get [unclear].
D:  Tell me about, tell me about your family Mrs. Mavrick.  
E:  My family, we have another two brothers and two sisters.  I'm in the middle between for the 
sisters.  Is the my work together for my village for the farms, but for the school, go for the

here and there.]  But you have so much, I go for the six grade.  [Comment unclear]  Today, for 
the six grade, I cover for the high school myself.  [Unclear] 1932.
D:  How old were you when you came to the United States?

E:  I came here in 1956, April 12.  I come out, I come from the [unclear] sister together.  I come 
together with my brothers  family.  Now they live in Florida.  
D:  So your sister and your brother, were they here [unclear]?
E:  My sister come here five years before, for myself.  
F:  Before you did.
E:  Yeah.  (F:  Okay)  She come to my Aunt here, to my mother's sister, live for East Boston.  
They helped my sisters come here.  My sisters come for the America, [unclear] for the family 
together here.  We have another two sisters come here, my brothers, 1977, my first sister, my 
middle brother, [unclear].  My other brother he go for Florida, St. Petersburg.  My nephew is the 
Technician.  He carries five language.  The others, Professor.  My young sister have one girl, 
come for the star, have their education in Washington, D.C.  My first sister has a son, the 
Professor too.  He at Boston University.  Except for the two kids they [unclear], the others 
[unclear] educate.  
J:  Right.
D:  And so there's music in your family as well.  
E:  Everybody.  Everybody.  I have my cousins here [unclear], get together for the group.  My 
aunt have seven children, two girls, five boys.  [Unclear] brother-in-law, have their three kids, 
one sister, two brothers.  The others [unclear] belong to the family, 35.  Everybody teach to go to 
the choir, but song for the Greek too, for the America.  Yeah, belonged to my family, everybody.
D:  Do any people in your family, do they play the instrument?  Any musical instruments? 
J:  [Asked Eugenia the same question in Greek].
E:  [Unclear], my first cousin here, he have the twin brothers to play for the piano.  [Unclear].  
The others, the song, everybody, belong the song, everybody.
D:  So it's mostly the songs?
E:  Yeah.
D:  Mr. Mavrick, how did you learn how to play music?  Did you learn from your father?
J:  Well that's a good question.  When my father was coming home once a year, he'd close 
himself upstairs.  After so many hours you open the door, [unclear].  He's says, you were here all 
the time?  Yeah.  He was impressed.  Instead of I being out to play football, I was listening to the,
to the music.  And that's why I got it you see.  
D:  Did your father teach you how to play any instruments?  
J:  No, no, no.  The singing, I picked it up myself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
D:  Where did you learn to play the guitar?  
J:  The guitar?  I went to, I got a few lessons.  You know what I mean?  See?  Got the idea?  But 
again I say, others can play the guitar so fluently, but they haven't got the personality to sell 
themselves.  I can just hold the guitar and just play one cord, but it's something that, you get the 
idea?  Now here, I'll give you this.  Over here I played in Ruby.  You keep that.  I played first, 
July 13, 1970.  James Mavrick will appear in the film "Ruby", in the near future.  Mavrick will 
also have a part, have a small part of the "Oddessey of Gloria."  And when they saw that I was so
magnetic, and they gave me a part in "Ruby".  And I want to tell you the truth.  This is the truth, 
because you can check on these people that made it.  When, the first showing was in Greece.  It 
was in the theater in Boston.  (E:  Cambridge)  Cambridge.  Three bus loads came down to see 
the film.  And when the picture was over, the lights went on, they all stood up and applauded.  I 
said, what are they, wise guys?  I thought they were keeping their word.  I was the star of the 
show.  So in other words, one of the parts, this Ruby, she, she was married to a, to a cripple, and 
he was very very mean to her.  Finally one day she gets disgusted and she went to a cabaret.  
Went to this cabaret and there was a very good singer.  Now I don't, praise, if you're worthy I'll 
praise.  Very good singer, excellent singer, singing, you know what I mean, in that cabaret.  And 
she fell in love.  And of course she went back again.  When she went back again, he wasn't there,
you know what I mean?  And my part was to find Ruby.  And this is the part I played [unclear] 
Ruby.  And I was suppose to say, that's why when they stood up and applauded me, "Ruby, 
where is Ruby.  Oh my God, Ruby!"  See the expression, see the thing?  And I was the star of the
show!  Ruby.  That's why I wrote to [names a person].  She gives me that chance.  All I need is 
just a couple of parts.  And I can make it.  I'm not going to be a lover.  Character parts, you know
what I mean?  I can act.  
LFP-DD-R053
D:  She won a prize?  (E:  Umhm)  For the Science Fair?  (E:  Yeah) Uh huh.  
E:  Is here, for the Greek School, the graduation.  
D:  So you just got, you have all sorts of prizes?  
E:  Is there my daughter take the prize for the Russia for the high school.  Is there my daughter 
[rest of comment unclear].  This is my, is the graduate for the Bradford College.  These are my 
children here.  Is there my daughters take the prize for the Greek School for, take the prize for 
the [rest of comment unclear] here, for the Greek language.  Here I have [unclear] my daughters 
here have the big play.
D:  Was that here in Haverhill?
E:  Yeah.  Haverhill.  I teach for the play too, myself.  See the play?
D:  You must be very proud of your children?
E:  Yeah, sure.  Of course I'm very proud.  I have so much.  I remember now, you know?  
D:  Yes.  Well that's wonderful.  
E:  [Comment unclear]
D:  Mrs. Mavrick, what?  The song that you were singing before, (E:  yeah) what kind of a song 
was that?
E:  Is there people give the war for the Turks.  
D:  It was a song that came from the war with the Turks?
E:  We have the fight for a hundred years (D:  yes) is left for the Turks.  We try long long time for
to take the freedom.  After the war for the Turks, [unclear].  But I have this song I say to myself 
together.  Because nobody knows [unclear].  I have myself.  It comes from the German people in 
1941 in my country.  They go for the Albania.  Everybody go for the war, my brothers, my 
family, my cousins.  We stay for the my village, except for the young kids, the old people, 
nobody go for the war.  [Unclear] we have the fight with the Italian people and for the war, 1940,
28th October.  The Italia [few words unclear].  We have nine million dollars, and nine million 
people for my country.  The Italia had 45 million.  [A few comments unclear].  You don't know 
how much we worked together for the war.  [Unclear] the Palestinian have the war for the others 
[unclear].  I said to my husband, you make the rocks for the German people, watch out for the 
heads.  But we have the fight, sabotage.  [Unclear]  Nobody knows, you here tomorrow, or you're
boarding.  Nobody knows you have heads, (J:  unclear) just a minute [says a few words in 
Greek]. (J:  go ahead, go ahead)  You fight for the freedom.  I worked for the hospital, helped for 
the (J:  in Greece) [unclear].  
J:  Okay.  The wounded, helped the wounded.
E:  But I come here.  I'm an American citizen twenty-seven years.  [Few words unclear].
F:  Okay.  All right.  Okay, all right.  This, I was looking for this here.  James Mavrick, born in 
Lowell to Greek Immigrant parents.  His father was a violinist, and he grew up in entertainment. 
Well we had the violin that in those days was dominated by [unclear].  In fact Mavrick's brother, 
he was named Leonard Georges went out to Hollywood, where according to Mavrick he worked 
for many years as a movie actor, once landing a role in a film starring Martin Wilder.  Mavrick 
[rest of comment unclear].  [Comment unclear] and bought, not only bought, I made, the former 
Mavrick Music Center on [unclear] Street, which he operated for fifteen years.  If nothing else, 
Mavrick [few words unclear].  [Few words unclear] the City Commerce of Chambers, the 
[unclear].  And when he feels things are getting out of hand, the sergeant [unclear].  Mavrick is a 
speech maker, a letter writer, finger pointer, and an all around [unclear].  That's what he claims, 
but I wasn't.  He sometimes gets a bit out of hand, but you can always count on him to speak his 
mind when something is bothering him.  [Comment unclear] has listened to enough of Mavrick's 
speech.  He offered these [unclear].  Jimmy Mavrick is a very sincere individual and certainly 
well intended.  I support anyone who feels (--)   You can have that if you want.
D:  That's great.  Thank you.  Well Mr. Mavrick, I noticed that in one of the clippings there it 
says that you were the union representative for the shoe?  (J:  Oh yes, yes!)  I wish you could tell 
us a little bit about that.
J:  Yes.  Sit down Eugenia please.  [She speaks in Greek]  You want to show that?  Do you want 
to show that?  (E:  I try)  Well go ahead.  All right.  Sit down please.  All right.  Yes, I was a 
union representative for the shoe workers at a time when there wasn't any money.  The others 
that were serving, they were getting paid.  When the money was depleted, they deserted, these 
phony union organizers.  Nobody cared to pick up, and I picked up the slack and I served, you 
know what I mean, for nothing, for the workers cause.  In other words I've been a sucker all of 
these years.
D:  There was a big strike in the shoe industry in Lowell.
J:  Oh yes, yes!
D:  That was in '30, is it '34 or '36?
J:  I think so.  A big strike, oh yes!
D:  Were you involved in that though?  
J:  Oh yes, I was involved.  Sure.  
D:  Could you tell us about that?
J:  Well there was a big strike because they used every tactic to you know, to get after the 
workers, the troublemakers, which they're not.  They're the ones that forced, like I told you 
before, the workers to go on strike.  No worker in his right mind wants to go on strike, you know 
what I mean?  But it gets so out of hand, and you see that you're being kicked around.  Well they 
say, we've had enough.  And they wanted us, you know what I mean?   Get the idea?  
D:  Do you remember how that strike started?
J:  It started because on account of the grievances, and they were very mean to the, you know 
what I mean, to the (--)  (E:  unclear)  To the workers, you know what I mean?  And when you, 
when you insult the workers, when you give the best, just like now, Eugenia, just like now, you 
come here and you give all of your time here.  And then if you notice that, Jesus Christ I wish 
they'd get the heck out of here.  You know what I mean?  You know, this is going to make me 
feel badly.  [Unclear]   Look it, we're going out of our way, and he's unappreciative.  That's just 
what happened.  That's just what happened?  
D:  So what was some of the ways they were treating the workers bad?
J:  First of all they, they weren't treated as human beings.  They considered them as nothing, you 
understand?  And all the time they needed them, because they cannot make shoes without, 
without the workers, you know what I mean?  They can't work.  (E:  She's talking in background 
at the same time as James and I cannot transcribe her comment.)  
D:  Well do they make them work too long hours, or (--)
J:  Yeah, we were working long hours and we weren't making any money!  And they're always 
after us, you know what I mean, to keep us on a [unclear] of fear.  Get the idea?  So finally it 
exploded, and the strike came.  They brought the strike on themselves, not the workers.  
D:  How did the strike begin?
J:  Well it began!  It began eventually, you know what I mean?  They voted, you know what I 
mean?  We've had enough.  We got to go out on strike.  But they never thought, but they did go 
out of strike.  
D:  So the union voted to go out on strike?
J:  Yes.  The union voted to go on strike.  
D:  Were you active in the union at that time?
J:  Oh yes, I've always, I tend to be a very active person, yeah.  Yup.  And then, then when there 
was no money to pay the officers of the union, they left, they didn't want to serve.   But I went 
and served.  
D:  How many years did you serve in that [unclear]?
J:  I think it was a couple of years I guess.  Two or three years. 
D:  About what time was that when you were (--)
J:  [Ask the same question to his wife in Greek]
E:  I don't know.  Because I come late.
D:  Was it before that strike, or was it after the strike?
J:  After the strike.  After the strike.
D:  How long have you worked in the shoe industry?
J:  Well I worked in the shoe industry I think about forty years Eugenia?  (E:  over)  Over forty 
years.  
E:  He was working here too.  
J:  Yeah, I worked here too.
D:  So you worked in Lowell and then you  [rest of comment unclear].
J:  Yeah, yeah, right.  Yes.
E:  For the last shoe shop he worked for the Ames Shoe Company.
J:  Ames Shoe Company.
E:  [Unclear] Boston.
D:  How was it you came here to Haverhill.  
J:  Well I'll tell you, I came here you know what I mean, I wanted to make a change.  You know, 
get the idea?
E:  [Comment unclear]
J:  I wanted to make a change, you know what I mean?  I thought I'd start a new life here, but I 
think I made a mistake.  I would have been better off in Lowell.  I would have been better off.
E:  Why so?  
J:  Well because in Lowell, when you go to the Coffee House, everybody would talk, express 
their views.  And when you listen, you know what I mean, we give you a chance to speak.  Over 
here I found out their not interested.  They don't care.  Do you understand?  They don't care to, to
talk.  Oh, incidentally, the first time in my life I went to, I went to visit Greece in 1984.  And I 
was there.  My wife sent me, go there and recuperate, because I had been sick, and uh, to stay a 
year.  And I have all of my stuff there.  Instead of staying a year, I come back in 38 days.  I went 
to a good doctor there in Sparta, because if I ever win a lottery ticket, I'm going to give the 
money to buy machinery.  Because they are good doctors there, but they haven't got no 
machinery, no money.  And so I went to the Greek doctor.  I said, Doctor, I want you to examine 
this, this arm.  I said, I have a hard time.  He said, forget about that.  He said, don't worry, you've 
got arthritis/bursitis.  But it's what I see I don't like.  I said, what do you see?  He said, I see that, 
he found out that I had a heart attack here, here in America and I didn't know about running 
around, because I'm very active.  I said, when I heard that I didn't want to, I was afraid I'd 
probably collapse [unclear] to come back.  And I went to Mass General Hospital.  And I said, I'm
a very active person.  I have two daughters, one who lives here, one who lives Detroit, so on, and
so on.  But sometimes I get a little pain here.  Let me tell you what they found.  They examined, 
they spot the same thing, [unclear] since then, 1984.  You know what I mean?  And then I went to
the doctor last week, I had to rush.  They found out that my heart is slow now.  You got to be 
careful not to get excited, and so on.  
D:  Well was there much, is there much of a Greek community here in Haverhill? 
J:  Here?  Yeah, there is, but not like Lowell.
D:  So that, that was the main difference between the, were there coffee houses here in 
Haverhill?  
J:  Yeah, there's one or two here, now there's one, yeah.  Yes. 
D:  Was the atmosphere in the coffee houses in Haverhill different from the way it was in here?
J:  Oh yeah, very different.  I liked it better in Lowell.  Here, they don't care to get involved, you 
know what I mean?  They don't give a damn whether, whether you speak (--)   In other words, 
they don't want to talk about subjects of the world, you know what I mean?  They want to talk 
about just what they want, period.  But in Lowell you sit down, you know what I mean, they talk 
about different things.  And then coming back, what I was impressed in Greece, first of all if you 
ever get a chance to go to Greece, you're going to be a better man, both of you.  You're going to 
see that people are very hospitable.  They maybe poor, but they're going to try to make you feel 
at home, bring you in the house, have a roast lamb dinner, or have coffee, or something like that. 
But they do it with the heart.  And what I liked about that, I was listening outside of the coffee 
house, they have verandas [unclear].  And I listened.  Now can I say something?  He said, yes.  
So, so when I spoke they got impressed.  They said, when did you leave Greece?  I never left 
Greece.  I was born, this is the first time I come to Greece.  They were impressed!  And what I 
liked about them, they talked about politics, you know what I mean?  See?  And they, that's, 
that's good.  That's good.  Talk about politics.  Listen to your opinion.  Don't get made.  But over 
here, I've been to these meetings.  I don't go there no more.  I stopped.  I get up, when you go to 
the meeting, when you have a meeting at the church, you go there to exchange ideas.  You know 
what I mean?  So I get up, he says, yeah Mr. Mavrick.  Well I think, in my opinion it should be 
done this way.  Now the person that I've written in the newspaper praised you, now you've 
become an enemy, because you didn't agree with what I said there, when we left the meeting, you
won't speak to me no more.  So I said, the hell with it.  I don't go there no more.  You 
understand?  Get the idea?  The people are stupid!  I don't know what's the matter with them.  
They're sick!  I can get up, let's settle this.  I'm sorry Mr. Rankin, but you, you can see, look at 
that [unclear].  He praised me.  Now you say, he's not against you.  Stop and read.  Why did I say
Mr. Rankin's bad.  It's a mistake.  Try to correct a mistake.  But don't become an enemy because I
said my opinion.  That's why I don't go there.  I don't want to bother anymore.  I just go to 
church, that's all.  
E:  How about I have some different idea than my husband.  My husband was born in Lowell.  
You born in Lowell too?  (D:  No)  [Unclear] your village, you feel different for the other, 
because I have the thirty years over here.  I love my village too, [unclear] except my husband, he 
like Lowell for the Haverhill.  
J:  No, I don't like, the reason I said, I don't care for these people.  I don't want (--)
E:  Every people have the good, the wrong.  
J:  I understand Eugenia.  I understand.  
E:  Every people, every village (--)
J:  These are stupid people, they're not bad.  There's a difference, bad and stupid.  
E:  Because I work here, I come here for the immigrant people I know either too.  You go there 
somewhere, you start a new life.  Some other time for your village maybe you don't see too many
wrongs, because our village.  Same for your family.  You marry somebody else.  You have 
something different for your mother, for the mother-in-law.  Is true?  Same for every village.
J:  Eugenia.  Now, I'll give you an idea why I don't go no more to the coffee houses.  I don't go, 
it's over a year and a half.  I don't go to coffee houses.  I don't go to meetings.  No more.  I 
stopped the meetings and everything.  I just go to church.  I'd be in a coffee house and one Greek
said, Mr. Mavrick, I want to ask you about, what is your idea about that?  About something.  So I
started to speak.  When I started to speak, right away he talks to the guy next to me, interrupts 
me.  I said, "get the hell out of here you bastard, I said, get out of here."  You understand?  
They're ignorant.  They're stupid, see?  So I don't want to bother with those people over there.
D:  Let me go back and ask you about your musical career.  Um, when did you first start playing 
professionally?  
J:  Professionally?  I think, I think 1946.  Oh yes, I forget.  I also sang over the radio, over the 
radio in Massachusetts for quite a few months.  Then I, then I gave the two concerts because 
people knew, you see, two concerts, paid admission.  And I promoted myself, I advertised.  You 
pick up, you say, "come and see a new star is born."  Who the hecks this guy here?  Oh, [unclear]
say, Jimmy, nobody will come to the concert.  I don't care if nobody goes.  I'm going to sing, the 
reporter come there and say, we went there, the hall was empty, but he sang over uh, how many 
people did I say?  How many people did I say.  (D:  I think, you say 700?)  Yes, over seven 
hundred people, paid admission, $1.20, plus ads that I got, I got in the program.  See?  So you 
can imagine if I had somebody to really push me a little bit.  
T:  Where was that concert?  
J:  In Lowell Memorial Auditorium.  Yeah, over seven hundred people.  Yes.  
D:  Did uh, when did you start going around to the coffee houses?
J:  Oh the coffee house, every year.  Every year with my guitar I go around and I sing that Greek 
New Year song.  
T:  Did you do that this year?  
J:  Oh yes, I certainly did.  I wasn't feeling up to it, you know what I mean?  I certainly did, 
because, because I'll tell you why I did.  I made sure I did, because I said, you people, some of 
you are going to come here, interview me.  So I didn't want to tell you that I didn't go this year, I 
had a cold.  Oh no, cold, or no cold, I went.  
D:  We were real sorry we missed that.  We've heard about that from Bill Giavas that you did 
that.  
J:  Okay.  For over 52 years we've done that. 
D:  We would have loved to have gone around with you and recorded you while you did that.  
J:  That's right.  Well if you, if you happen to be here next year, I'll be there. 
D:  Yeah, unfortunately we won't be.  Do you only do that at New Years?  
J:  For that particular show, yeah, for that place.  But the singing in the picnics, in the dances, in 
the weddings, that I've done for so many years.  That's why they do, that's why I do the crowd of 
700 people.
D:  Do you ever, do you ever go around to the coffee houses at any other time of the year?  
J:  Oh yes, oh yes!
D:  Is it possible we could go around with you sometime while you, when you did that?
J:  Yes.
D:  We're only going to be here until the end of May.  
J:  Oh, till the end of May?  
D:  Yeah, now is (--)
J:  All right, all right.  What would you want, what would you like?  
D:  Well is that something that you would normally do?  I mean would you, do you only go 
around at New Years?  
J:  For that particular show, yes.  
D:  But do you, do you sometimes (--)
T:  Do you ever sing in the coffee houses any other time of year?
J:  I used to.  You get the idea?  Yeah, I used to.  Around May you said?  All right.  Let me know 
and I'll try to make it my point to come down.  We'll go a few coffee houses, you know what I 
mean (D:  okay) and sing while you record it.  I'll do that.
D:  Okay, well that would be good.  
J:  I'll do that, I'll do that.
D:  That would be good.  You know, if that's something that you would normally do.  
J:  Right, yes.  
D:  Um, so when you, how did that get started, going around and singing that New Year song?  
J:  [Asks same question to Eugenia in Greek]?
E:  [Responds in Greek]
[Both continue to correspond in Greek]
J:  It's because I felt you know what I mean, I knew, there used to be an old person, you know 
what I mean, did it once, but that's all he did it, see?  Get the idea?  He never did it anymore.  
And he, he was very appreciate seeing me go down there.  So, so I started to go down.  And for 
over fifty-two years, like Sampas Scoopies, I haven't got the, he wrote it in the Lowell Sun.  You 
can look it up.  He said, one thing about Jimmy Mavrick, I'm proud to say that over fifty-two 
years he has come down every year and has brought happiness to the emigrants that came from 
Greece, and reminds them how they go around that day.  [Sings a tune]  New song, you know 
what I mean, for the New Year, get the idea?  That's enlightening. It gives some knew courage to 
go out and work, you understand? 
D:  Is that something that they would do back in Greece?   
J:  Oh yes!  Oh yes!  Of course.  That's why they were so.  They were, that's why they were so 
enthused.  There were many times, they give me, they give me ten dollar bills, five dollar bills, 
you know what I mean?  Once I went as far, oh yes, write that down.  Once I went as far, my 
wife was waiting for me, as far with my car.  And one particular place it was ice, and the car 
turned around.  I made almost a thousand dollars my friend.  One man alone singing that son.  
D:  What's the name of the song?  
J:  [Says name in Greek]  Let me write that down please.
D:  Please.
E:  [Cannot transcribe]
J:  Yes Eugenia.  And that's why I said, those people come here, I wasn't feeling too good, you 
know, cold.  I said, I got to go out.  Because I would have been ashamed if they said, well how 
come you didn't go this year?  See?  [Says word in Greek-must be writing it down]  Oh yes!  And
American people in barrrooms.  Come over here son, I like you.  (T:  Uh huh)  Here's a dollar.  
Here's another dollar.  America people.  They like the man who come in and sing [sings in 
Greek].  Maybe I wasn't feeling good, but I didn't show it.  Get the idea?  (T:  Right)  
D:  What are the coffee houses in Lowell that are still left?
J:  Well they are in Lowell now, let's see.  There's a Democratic Club, you know what I mean?  
Democratic Club, I think they're on Dutton Street, somewhere around there.  [Says something in 
Greek-still writing out name of songs]  Greek New Year song.  Over 52 years. 
T:  Now what cities, what town would you go to? 
J:  Well I'll tell you the towns I went to when I made almost a thousand dollars.  I went to 
Worcester.  I went to Manchester, I went to Nashua.  Oh yes!  Manchester.  I went to Arlington, 
Watertown, you know what I mean?  Boston, Boston, the Coffee Houses.  Jeese!  (E:  Lynn)  
Huh?  (E:  Lynn)  In Lynn, Mass, oh yes!
T:  And you went to, you know where all the coffee houses are?
J:  In other words they were very thrilled.  
D:  How did you know where all the coffee houses were in those towns?
J:  Well I just make one, the first time, where they are.  They told me and I jumped.  I had to 
move fast.  You can't just go, take your time and go in.  It'll take you three years.   I just jump it,  
[Sings] oop, jump in, jump in the car again.  In fact once, twice I burned two motors, starting, 
stopping.  There's nobody a bigger fan than I am my friend.  The trouble with the people today, 
they haven't got no, no will power.  No, they're timid.  Well I don't know, [mumbles a few words]
get the idea?  That's why, that's why people know who I am.  Don't forget, we'll be waiting for 
you next year?  You gave us new inspiration!  That's what I tell them. 
D:  You know what we'd like to do now.  If we can get you to play some songs for us.  (T:  Sing 
that song?)  (J:  yes, okay)  And we'd like to record you singing some songs, and then Mrs. 
Mavrick, if you'd be willing to sing a little.  If you'd like to sing, if you would sing that song that 
you sang before a little bit more alert.

D:  Why don't we do this.  Why don't we, why don't we record each of you singing first, and then
if you're going to use your guitar, we'll have to change the set-up with the microphones. 
J:  Okay.  Yes, okay.
D:  Okay, so why don't we record each of you singing first.

J:  This goes on to say that these Greek women didn't want to be slaves, you know what I mean? 
See?  And they chose to sacrifice their kids and throw them and kill themselves, and not be near 
the Turks to manipulate them.  That's the whole thing.
