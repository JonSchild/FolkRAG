GINA & ALEX PASCHALL, Triangle Tires 
Katy Clune  00:00 
I'll press record and go ahead and start by introducing the tape. It's April 12 2021, Katy Clune here with 
Julia Gartrell, outside of Triangle Tires. And if you could both introduce yourself for the tape with your 
full name and your connection to the business. 
 
Gina Paschall  00:22 
Okay. I'm Gina Paschall. I'm the owner. This is my 28th year in this business. 
 
Alex Pashchall  00:29 
I'm Alex Paschall. I'm her son. It is my zeroeth year in this business because I mostly live here too. But I 
have a completely unrelated job as well. 
 
GP  00:41 
On the property 
 
AP  00:41 
On the property.  
 
[0:43 to 3:28, talk of why Alex came back to live with Gina as a result of the COVID-19 
pandemic.]  
 
Julia Gartrell  03:28 
Could you describe the compound that we're on right now? [laughter] 
 
GP  03:32 
[Crosstalk, laughter over calling the land a compound vs. a property.] Everybody says that!. So I have 
several tiny houses and trailers and we even have a yurt that Alex and Kate built just recently—just in 
the past month—and then I have an old barn that has an upgraded stall for my horse. My horse is out 
here. And my horse is is literally in the middle of the seven acres. So it's seven acres all the way around 
her on and on one corner, it's a triangle. [crosstalk] This property is a perfect triangle. My shop, my 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
2 
automotive shop, is at the peak of the triangle, at the point of the triangle. And then we just kind of live 
out from that, but we've got, we have pretty much everything that we need right here. We—I hardly 
leave the triangle. I hardly ever do! [crosstalk, discussion of growing vegetables, three wells on the 
property.] 
 
JG  04:53 
Sounds great. So did you build the building that the automotive shop is in, or did you--? 
 
GP  05:01 
No, I bought. So I started out with a Triangle Tire hauling business. So I hauled 1000s and 1000s of tires 
every day, five or six days a week. And this was started in [19]94. And so Alex was five. When I first 
started hauling. Originally, I was supposed to be a child psychologist. And that's what I went to 
university for. And it, just a series of events in my life. And I always loved automotive shots. When I 
was little, I used to help my dad always fix cars.  
 
GP  05:40 
And he was always tinkering on something. And I was always out there helping him. And I remember 
my dad saying, "You know, when you grow up, we're going to have our own automotive shop. Right? 
And"—because my maiden name was Brady—"We're going to call it Brady and Brady." And it was just 
always my thing. It drove my mother crazy.  
 
GP  05:59 
I'd come in the house, and I'm just covered in grease, you know, and she's like, "Oh, my God, don't 
touch anything. Don't touch anything. Just go get in the tub. Just get in the tub." And she looked at my 
dad go: "Why?" And he's like, "She loves it. I don't know." But and when he [her son Alex] was a 
toddler, I couldn't hardly pry a screwdriver out of his hand. He would scream bloody murder. And I'd be 
like, "How did you even find a screwdriver? Where did you find this?" I would just be peeling his 
fingers off of it while he's screaming. He loves screwdrivers, which he grew up to do something 
different. But— 
 
AP  06:33 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
3 
Yeah, I didn't do much with my hands. 
 
GP  06:35 
There's something in the blood. 
 
AP  06:37 
But we love to take things apart. I think that's it. Yeah. 'Cause that screwdriver wasn't for making things, 
I like to take things apart. 
 
GP  06:43 
And my dad's mother's family. They were Native Americans, and their last name was Wheeler. They 
made the wagon wheels. So I really think it is in the blood. I really do. There's something to that. I'm not 
sure exactly what but I think there's something to that. 
 
KC  07:03 
Where did you grow up? 
 
GP  07:04 
In Georgia, down in  
 
KC  07:07 
Did you have siblings? 
 
GP  07:09 
No. [crosstalk] I mean, well, later, when I was a teenager, my mom remarried and had two daughters. 
[7:18 - 7:36: Gina and Alex discuss step siblings.] 
 
KC  07:37 
And you said your dad had a shop? 
 
GP  07:40 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
4 
No. He used to joke about when you when I grew up.  
 
KC  07:44 
So what was his day job? 
 
GP  07:48 
Real Estate. He owned a lot of real estate. And so he was always fixing things and building things. And 
because of that. So anyway, so I had the tire hauling business. And then I opened my first shop starting 
in '94.  
 
GP  08:06 
I opened my first shop in Durham in 2006. And because I was hauling the tires, and what I realized was 
I'm just picking up at a lot of, like, dealerships, and the tires were really really good tires, sometimes 
new tires, and they were just going into a shredder. Like they were going to the landfill, going into a 
trailer, going to the shredder. And there was a big problem with like—there were too many tires and not 
enough things to do with them. And so EPA was going crazy back then. People would dump tires and 
woods and it was awful. Yeah. And so we just decided, you know, why don't we just resell them? And 
back then there weren't used tire stores.  
 
JG  08:57 
Really?  
 
GP  08:58 
No. There were not.  
 
KC  08:59 
In the early 2000s? 
 
GP  09:01 
That was  in '94. Yeah. And so well, in 94. I started selling them wholesale. And I was selling so there 
were like two or three used tire stores back then. Like it wasn't a thing. So there was like Jay T's you 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
5 
know, John Turner over on Geer Street [in Durham], and there was just a couple of little places that you 
wouldn't really probably want to go to maybe you know, and most people most of women especially 
maybe not. Now it's very common. But back then it wasn't. 
 
AP  09:35 
You were a trendsetter.  
 
GP  09:37 
Well, I made it look easy. I really did. 
 
AP  09:40 
Well, once people figured out the pipeline of the money then it just really changed the game because it 
was like when people realize they're paying you to pick up the tires and take them away. So you get paid 
to take the tires. Then you look at them and go, "This one's actually still good. I'll sell that one for $30." 
So I got paid twice.  
 
GP  09:54 
Well, no, we never got $30. 
 
AP  09:56 
I'm sorry, that was an exaggeration. That's like, that's like $15-$20. 
 
GP  09:59 
I sold hundreds of tires a week. But—I forgot where my thought process was going—how it organically 
evolved into then I decided to open my own used tire store. Because I had so many good use tires and I 
was so still selling wholesale. I opened my own store, the store did great. Then we opened another store 
on Hillsborough Road.  
 
KC  10:24 
Where was the first one? 
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
6 
GP  10:25 
Chapel Hill Street in Durham. And then the next one was on Hillsborough Road. Then we opened one 
on 86 in Hillsborough. We had one on Miami Blvd.  
 
AP  10:35 
Where that Kangaroo [gas station] is now. That's actually where her shop was, it was that rundown 
thing— 
 
AP  10:41 
It was that big brick building that used to be a truckstop. 
 
AP  10:44 
Yeah, it was a diner when I was a kid and then it burnt down. And then we actually worked out of the 
burnt down building.  
 
GP  10:49 
It wasn't burnt completely down. One half, one side of it caught on fire. And so we took the side of it 
that wasn't on fire. 
 
AP  10:58 
I love how you always contextualize the thing that's falling apart like "Well, we use the part that wasn't 
destroyed." [laughs] I always gave her crap because it's it's like the dining room is on fire blackened and 
all that. 
 
GP  11:09 
We never went on that side. It was walled off.  
 
AP  11:11 
The customers didn't go over there, they didn't know— 
 
GP  11:13 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
7 
It was, we didn't go over there! It was walled off. 
 
KC  11:16 
What were the shops called? Because 
 
GP  11:19 
Triangle Tire. Always. 
 
KC  11:20 
Always Triangle, even though you weren't on a triangle? 
 
AP  11:24 
Because when we saw the triangle. That's it was the other way around. 
 
GP  11:31 
Kinda. How long do you want this interview to be? 
 
KC  11:36 
An hour? Tell us the good stuff! [laughs] 
 
GP  11:41 
Okay, so how how this happened was. . . So my best friend's dad originally had started the hauling 
business. And I had just moved back here because we were in Florida for like six years. Moved back up 
here and had not established myself in North Carolina in any way yet. I was just pretty much hit my on 
my feet with my two year old.  
 
GP  12:17 
And he [Alex] had really serious, bad allergies. Like, couldn't go to someone else's house, like his 
immune system was just 
 
AP  12:28 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
8 
 Totally shot.  
 
GP  12:30 
He was like the boy in the bubble kind of thing with his immune system. He couldn't go anywhere, do 
anything. His environment had to be extremely controlled. And I had to learn a lot real quick. And one 
of the things that I learned down in Florida was that the humidity so high down there all year round, 
nothing does off, mold doesn't die. And he's really, really allergic to mold.  
 
GP  12:50 
So after going through with different pediatricians and allergists, I finally realized I have to change his 
environment. So we came up here to visit my ex-husband, which would be his dad's, family. And he 
seemed like he would always seem like he was a little better even though you know, there's pollen 
outside and all that.  
 
AP  13:16 
Considering how much yellow season we have here, really it was the mold. The yellow is like, I sneeze, 
no big deal. 
 
AP  13:22 
No big deal. 
 
AP  13:23 
Yeah, it's like I can't breathe was the issue. 
 
GP  13:25 
Yeah. And so, I just I decided, you know, Florida is definitely not it. Not for him. Because they were 
wanting to do surgery on his ears. Like he just wasn't, he wasn't okay. And so I said, you know, I'm 
going to North Carolina, and I'm going to see—say again? 
 
GP  13:44 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
9 
I'm getting to that point. So I got to North Carolina—because of him—and started selling Shaklee. I 
completely changed, like his diet, building his immune system and stuff. And that's Shaklee is like, I 
don't sell it now, but I love Shaklee products, but it's all organic. And it's, you know— 
 
AP  13:44 
How did you meet Clayton, though? 
 
KC  13:46 
Is it like toiletries? 
 
GP  13:52 
No, it's like herbal supplements.  
 
[14:14-14:44 discussion of Shaklee products.] 
  
GP  14:45 
So I was trying to build his immune system up when I took him to the pediatrician to get his 
vaccinations to go to kindergarten. The pediatrician, I said "I want to get vaccinations so he can go to 
kindergarten." And the pediatrician said, he laughed and said, "Gina, this child will never go to school." 
And I said, "Give him the shot. He'll go to school. Give him the shot." 
 
GP  15:19 
So they did. And I went to the teachers, and I said, he has to have an air machine. And they're cleaning 
products that are all natural, I'll be glad to clean the classroom. If you'll allow this, you'll be healthier, 
the other kids will be healthier. And he may not be able to come every day, but you know, as much as he 
can. And they were all so supportive, like all of his teachers were like, "Yeah! A clean air machine that 
costs, you know, a lot of money that most of the classrooms don't have." The kids actually were all 
healthier and didn't catch as many things, you know, during the school year. And, and I just kept 
building his immune system. Well in the meantime, his dad, his dad had moved up just a few months 
after I moved up here because he said, "Oh, well, I guess she's going to North Carolina. I'm going to 
North Carolina." 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
10 
 
GP  16:12 
So he was up here. And he left one day, and I was sitting there going, "Okay, what am I gonna do now?" 
And my best friend called me and she said, "Don't worry about it. You know, you can help my dad part 
time. You can help my dad part-time. My sister can help with Alex. Because Alex couldn't go to daycare 
or anything like that. And her dad—Clayton Brewer [spelling?]—was like, the most amazing person like 
I just had this instant connection with him. [crosstalk]  
 
GP  16:58 
And the first time I ever did tires, they had this big huge 26 foot truck and, and we had gone to the 
landfill so that the four of them could unload the truck. And I said, "I want to unload the truck." And 
they looked at me and they laughed. And they're like, "Okay, sure." Like she must be crazy. But I got in 
the back of the truck. It had been raining, all the tires were orange. I got back there, I unloaded the 
whole entire truck. I came out orange from head to toe. They're laughing. They're just dying laughing, 
because I'm just one little orange person going, "I love it!!" And they're like, "She's crazy!" 
 
JG  17:39 
Why were the tires orange? 
 
GP  17:42 
From the orange clay. It had rained, and all of the tires pretty much came out of the orange clay.  
 
KC  17:50 
How old were you at that point, Gina?  
 
GP  17:52 
I was thirty..... three? No. 31.  
 
AP  18:01 
Yeah. You were definitely very early 30s. If you were even in your 30s, 
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
11 
GP  18:07 
I want to say it was 30 or 31. I'd have to go back and count that. But I think— 
 
JG  18:12 
What was it about it that you loved in this unloading process? 
 
GP  18:17 
I just love the tires. It's hard to explain it. But—and nobody else really gets it. But they get it when they 
see me do the tires. They're like, "Wow." There's a flow, there's a rhythm, and just handling the tires. 
Like—[pause] 
 
GP  18:42 
There's a rhythm to it. And being able to do something with my hands, you know, and and, I don't know, 
it's just my thing. My mom asked the same question many, many, many times over the years. She's like, 
"I don't—Gina, I really don't get it. But I'm glad you love it. But I really don't get it." And I'm like, 
"That's okay, you don't have to." 
 
AP  19:03 
 Here mom is a southern belle, I think we should clarify. 
 
GP  19:05 
She had never pumped gas in her life. 
 
AP  19:08 
People pump gas for you. You don't mow your lawn on Sundays, that's the Lord's day.  
 
GP  19:13 
She never pumped gas in her life.  
 
KC  19:15 
That's very illustrative of the contrast between the two of you. 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
12 
 
GP  19:19 
Oh my goodness. Yeah. Yeah, it was weird. We're polar opposites. 
 
KC  19:26 
What did your dad have to say? 
 
GP  19:29 
My dad? Well, my dad was long gone. So— my mom and dad divorced when I was five. And my dad 
went one way, my mom went another way. I ended up in a lot of foster homes and then with relatives, 
and back in foster homes and that, so I kind of raised me pretty much. 
 
GP  19:48 
But I mean, I still adored my dad, even though he wasn't there anymore. You know, and I had those 
memories. But then, when my best friend's dad, when I first met him, he just automatically was my hero. 
I just thought he was the greatest thing. And, and when I first started doing tires, I loved it so much 
that— 
 
GP  20:18 
But he would stop in the middle like, you have to imagine we're digging tires out of a room, or a fenced 
off area, and the truck can't get all the way back there, you know. So we're having to do a chain of 
rolling in the tires, sort of three or four people, and we'd be rolling the tires and someone is over there 
throwing them up in the truck, someone's getting them from here, someone's rolling to the next person, 
you know, and he would stop and he goes, "Stop, stop, stop!" 
 
GP  20:43 
And tires are still rolling, and people are trying to stop their tire, you know, and he's running out, and 
he's got a mechanic's rag out of his back pocket and he's like, "You have something on your leg. You got 
tire dirt." And he's wiping off my leg and, and his kids would help us and they're like, "Oh my God. Oh 
my God."  
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
13 
AP  21:01 
He was so protective of her.  
 
JG  21:02 
Yeah, I can't imagine he was helping out the guy— 
 
GP  21:05 
He wasn't! He wasn't! It was so funny. But I mean, we were just instantly family. Like we just were. 
Like he called—Alex called him grandpa. 
 
AP  21:16 
Yeah, that's what I was about to say, its Grandpa. It's so funny to me to hear you say my friend's dad, as 
opposed to just hearing Grandpa.  
 
GP  21:24 
Yeah. 
 
AP  21:25 
it's um, I don't know if you walked into the the front of the shop, but there's a there's a American flag 
that's like in a frame and all that. That was his. He was in World War II? 
 
GP  21:33 
He was in Vietnam,  
 
AP  21:34 
Vietnam. Oh, wow, I thought—? 
 
GP  21:36 
That was from his casket when he died.  
 
AP  21:38 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
14 
Oh, my gosh.  
 
GP  21:38 
And he's buried right down the road.  
 
AP  21:40 
Yeah.  
 
GP  21:41 
So I got to get to this part of the story. [crosstalk] So, it wasn't long after I started doing tires, that dad 
had a stroke. And I went into see him that morning in the hospital. And he was trying to talk to me, and 
he was partially paralyzed. And he said, "Gina, I want you to have the tire hauling company." And I 
said, "Dad, we're not going to talk about that right now. Right now, we're just going to focus on getting 
you better."  
 
GP  22:07 
And he goes, "Mmm, mmm. I'll never be back in that truck. I want you to have it." And he had five kids 
[crosstalk], and I'm like, "We'll talk about it later." And I'm like, "You know, you have five kids, we'll—
everybody we'll talk about. And he's like, "No, they don't love it. You love it. I want you to it." 
 
GP  22:26 
And he was stubborn. And I'm like, "Yeah, we'll talk about this later." So that night, I went home, I sat 
down on the edge of my bed. And I was thinking, I didn't say a word to anybody. Because I thought, you 
know, he's just had a stroke. And he doesn't mean what, he doesn't even know what he's saying. I sat 
down on the side of my bed that night, though. And I thought, well, if I ever did that, I would change the 
name. This name just came in my head: Triangle Tire Hauling.  
 
GP  22:54 
And I went, "No, no, no, no, no, he's gonna be fine. He's gonna be back in the truck in a few weeks. So 
we're, we're gonna get through this." And because at that time, it was called, like, his last name was 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
15 
Brewer. And it was Brewer's Scrap Tire Hauling & Disposal Company. It was like this really, really, 
really long name.  
 
GP  23:10 
The next morning, I walked in his hospital room. I said, "Good morning, Dad! How are you this 
morning? "He said, "I was thinking about this last night." Now, I hadn't said a word to anybody. That 
just came in my head. And the next morning, he said, "You should change the name, I was thinking 
Triangle Tire Hauling." [pause] 
 
JG  23:27 
What? 
 
GP  23:29 
I almost hit the floor. [pause] I said "We'll talk about it later." So I went and talked to his kids and 
they're like, "We don't want to have anything to do with that. No, we don't want to have anything to do 
with the responsibility. We don't want the bills, we don't want—no, you. Take it. Do it.  
 
AP  23:49 
You would have thought that between the five of them one of them would have been good enough to do 
it or wanted to do it. But really the truth was that it was, you were the best, and like there were. . . Yeah, 
I mean, Trish could have picked it up she'd be the only other one who could have done it.  
 
GP  24:04 
Yeah, Trish was his oldest daughter, and she was my best friend, and she helped with the tires, but—I 
talked, I talked to her really strong about like going partners with me and she said, "I don't want to have 
anything to do with the responsibility. But I do want to raise?" And I'm like, "You got it." And so, she 
got her raise and she got like the hours she wanted and all that because she drives one of the trucks and I 
had several trucks running and I had about 60 different—60 stores—that I hauled and— 
 
KC  24:42 
So you took over in 1994? 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
16 
 
GP  24:44 
It was '95, was when—after he had a stroke. So then, I there—and he was right. And so we took care of 
them and between Trish, and his—well, his all of his children, well between the three dauthers and me—
then we always took care of him as long as he was still here. And then he passed away a couple years 
later, but—which was awful, horrible. But during that short period of time, he was the closest thing to a 
dad I'd ever had. And he really was. No, he was.  
 
AP  25:30 
He was my grandpa for sure.  
 
GP  25:31 
He was. He was. He was an amazing person. And I just lived to make him smile. I just wanted to make 
him smile. I'd come in his hospital room, and you know, and he  developed dimentia and stuff. And so 
he'd say, "Did you pick up Merchants today?" And I'm like, "Yes, dad. I got Merchants." He's like, 
"Okay, the one on Pettigrew Street." "Yes, dad. I got them." "Okay. Okay, good. All right. You got you 
know, you got to keep them picked up, because like, they don't have much room to store to—" And I'm 
like, "Yeah, I know."  
 
GP  26:00 
And then he'd say, "Did you? Did you know, my car was left at Northgate Mall? Can you go get my 
car?" And I'm like, "On it, I'm on it. And I'd start to walk out the door and go. "Where are you going?" 
"I'm going, I'm going to get your car at Northgate Mall." He's like, "Oh, okay. Yeah, you better go get it 
before somebody messes with it." And he'd be talking about some car that he had from when he was 
young, you know. 
 
GP  26:24 
But after a few—it didn't take Trish long (his daughter) before she decided she didn't want to do the tires 
at all. It was just too hard for her. Because of her memories with him. And so she said, "I'm sorry, I'm 
gonna drive a truck for another company. I cannot do the tires. It's just too hard." And she did. She

started driving a truck for another company. And that's what she wanted to do. And I totally got that. 
And we're still really good friends. But— 
 
KC  26:56 
Did he get to see you running things? 
 
GP  26:59 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 
AP  27:02 
He made sure she knew how to get things done before all that, too. So you already kind of knew what 
you're doing. 
 
GP  27:08 
I did, because I loved it. I did. I watched everything he did. I mean, I took mental notes. Constantly. 
Everything he did, everything he didn't do. How he did it, how he didn't do it. And, but, my bond with 
him, had so much to do with it, you know. And after he was gone, I'd be driving the truck and I'd go to 
haul the tires, and sometimes somebody didn't show up. And so I'm going to do it by myself. And I get 
this 26 foot box truck and I'm picking up you know, 800 tires, 1000 tires, 1200 tires that day.  
 
AP  27:40 
And they're wet.  
 
GP  27:41 
And it's a big, huge truck, and I'm driving down the interstate, you know, this big—and I'm just this little 
bitty person. And I've been missing him so much, but I could hear him in my head saying, "You got this. 
You got this. You got this." And I knew that he was—he knew I had it. He knew I had it. 
 
JG  28:03 
How do clients respond when this little bitty lady in a huge truck pulled up to—? 
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
18 
GP  28:07 
Oh, well. [crosstalk] In the beginning, in the beginning—it was funny because, you know, I'd pull up, 
and there would be all these mechanics come out of the bays, and they're like, and they like looking for 
the guy. "Where are the guys?" And I'm like, "No guys." 
 
AP  28:28 
Yeah, they thought you were just a driver or something.  
 
GP  28:28 
And they're like, "Well, who's gonna pick up the tires?" "Well, I am." "By yourself?" And I'm like, 
"Yeah." And they're like, "Oh, we got to watch this." And so they leaned up beside the building, I'd look 
and there's all these mechanics leaned up like this laughing. 
 
GP  28:48 
And I'd pick up, you know, three or 400 tires, whatever they had at that shop at that time, and load up 
the truck, get up there, lace them, lock the door, take my paper, go turn my paper in. And they're like—
you know, there's just standing there with their mouth hanging open and their jaw on the floor. And that 
was in the very beginning.  
 
GP  29:08 
But it didn't take long before I had a reputation. They're like,  "There comes the tire lady!" You know, 
"Better move your car out of the way, because she's gonna need to be able to get back there." And so it 
was, and then they would tell the other guys that came along that were new, like, "That's the tire lady. 
Don't mess with her. 'Cause she ain't messing with you, just like, let her do her thing." 
 
AP  29:26 
I really liked how their attitudes changed in a positive way. The wives? Not so much. The guys 
eventually would chill out. But occasionally a wife would show up like, [imitating voice] "Who is this?" 
 
GP  29:35 
I don't remember that. 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
19 
 
AP  29:37 
Oh, I remember that. 
 
GP  29:38 
I don't remember that. I was just doing my job. I wasn't worried about that.  
 
AP  29:41 
I remember, a couple of times, we were at one of the shops. And one of the guys, his wife, also worked 
at the counter, I'm trying to remember where it was at in Durham, and I just remember her being like, 
"Oh, the tire woman and her kid are here, mm hmm.: And he's like, "Hey, Gina!" She was always side 
eyeing you, and I remember that, just being like, "Really lady?And she would always ask you like, 
"Why aren't you? Where's your husband?" and stuff like that. And like, "Why aren't you doing—" 
 
GP  30:07 
I do remember, I remember one customer, one time, that his wife was there. And, I was, I was walking 
past her, and she was like, coming toward me, and as she was walking past me, she said, :You really, 
you shouldn't be doing a man's job." And I said, "If I had a man to do it, I wouldn't." And I, but I didn't 
ever let comments like that—you know, because they were few and far between.  
 
GP  30:39 
I think most people respected me, because it was clear that I was working my butt off to provide for my 
kid. And me. And, and, and I worked circles around them. I mean, I hired men and women. And I have 
to say, the women usually tried harder, and they lasted longer, because [crosstalk] they knew they had to 
work harder. And I would tell them, you know, but I mean, I gave equal opportunity to everybody.  
 
GP  31:13 
But guys, a lot of the time, wouldn't you know, they'd be construction guys, or they laid tile, or they're 
like, "Oh, yeah, you know, I do big, heavy stuff. And so it's no problem." Then I'm like, "Well, you're 
hired," you know, "See you tomorrow morning, eight o'clock." And some of them didn't make it through 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
20 
the first day. They're like, "I don't know how you do this. But this is like too hard. This is hard work. 
This too hard on the body." 
 
GP  31:36 
This one guy, the very first day, it wasn't even lunchtime yet, and I thought he was gonna have a heart 
attack. I'm like, "You just need to go home. You just go home." 
 
JG  31:45 
How much does the average tire weigh? 
 
GP  31:47 
Usually about 25 pounds. If it's dry. If it's wet, you know, it's got water in it, it weighs more. If its got 
ice, half moons in it, then it weighs a lot more. 
 
JG  31:58 
So you're just lifting weights all day, basically.  
 
AP  32:01 
You do in a very smart way. And I think that the number one thing you see, especially as a guy coming 
into this, and someone who is not physical, I come into this thing, and I look at what they do. And I see 
how women behave versus men. And it's, there's a, and I do this because I'm a guy too, and I'm large. 
Physically large. So I just go, "Oh, yeah, whatever, I'm gonna [makes sound like he is lifting something 
heavy]  do this thing for a second." And so they do that 300 times. And you know, you can do that once. 
And maybe you don't throw your back out. But you watch him do that, like, "Yeah, I'll just twist my 
whole back and fling this thing as hard as I can and impress everyone 300 times." And rip your back 
apart. They don't make it. They don't make it long at all. Every woman you've ever hired knows you get 
low, you use your legs, and you lift this whole thing, you just use your knee to move the whole thing. 
 
GP  32:01 
Yeah. 
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
21 
GP  32:49 
You don't really have to use your knee, as long as you use your thighs. 
 
AP  32:53 
Yeah, you're really using what's right here [motions to upper leg]. 
 
KC  32:55 
Do you give your new hires a lesson when they start on how to do it? Summarize it for us. [crosstalk] 
 
GP  33:05 
Well, I mean, never use your back. Always use your thighs. And when you pick the tire up, don't hold it 
way away from your body. You know, you want to hold it up close because you don't—and you want to 
keep your back straight. So you get down, you pick your tire up using your legs, and then, but your tire 
has momentum. If you do it the same way, every time when you pull something up and keep an 
continuous movement, it has momentum. So it's pretty much going to go wherever you've aimed it to. 
Just use that momentum. Don't use your body. Use the momentum. 
 
AP  33:49 
I think what you said about keeping it close is probably the thing I see them fail to do the most because 
they want to make a—they try to do stuff that's so physical and so they don't—yeah, like you said, 
you're like basically hugging the tire and then lifting yourself up and then using your leg to kind of just 
shove it off— 
 
GP  34:03 
Well, no, I don't ever get dirty when I do tires. They don't ever touch my clothes. 
 
AP  34:07 
Oh, okay. Uh huh. You've never come home and been like— 
 
GP  34:10 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
22 
Not after—I mean in the very beginning. But you know once I had it down to a—which is one thing that 
the guys would always go, "How?" at the end of the day "Why are you not dirty? And we're filthy?" 
Because I don't wear it on my clothes. 
 
AP  34:25 
Well, your legs would, because you have to always have it like on there [motions], and your nose would 
always be so—you would always be complaining that you always had, like, tire dirt in your nose. I 
remember that— 
 
GP  34:34 
No. It was on my nose. Because all day long, I'm doing this number [wipes nose] with my glove. 
[crosstalk] I'm wiping my nose. Like if, especially in the spring and in the fall. But anyway— 
 
KC  34:45 
I kind of hear what you're saying about the rhythm to it though. Like you're very in touch, it's almost like 
dancing— 
 
GP  34:52 
It is! 
 
KC  34:53 
 You're in touch with it and you like feel the flow.  
 
GP  34:56 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
AP  34:57 
Especially on a team. Because you have like the person who's getting and throwing and then you have 
the person who might pick it up and guide or pick it up and— 
 
GP  35:03 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
23 
It depends on who you're working with. [crosstalk] If people have good rhythm, you know, some people 
you can work really well with, and some people who don't have rhythm, they will actually mess you up. 
There's some people I just I can't work with, but, and the girls.  
 
GP  35:21 
Every girl that I've hired, I've said to them: "So, there are a couple things you don't do in this industry. 
One, you don't ever cry. If you've got to cry, you go to the bathroom, you go somewhere else. You do 
not cry in front of them. Ever. You don't get hurt. If you do, you don't yell, 'Ouch, ow, ooo, ooh.' Don't 
do it. Because they're looking for that. They're looking for you to not be able to do the thing." You may 
later go, "Oh, my God, that hurt so bad." Try not to do it in front of the customers, you know?  
 
GP  35:57 
And, and so the girls understood. I mean, they've already understood. They've always gotten that, that 
you're in a male dominated industry. They're looking for you to fail. Don't give it to them. And so the 
girls are, it's like, I think they try harder. And they they suck it up more because they're like, "Yeah, I 
can't cry. I can't go, 'Oh, today I'm so tired, oh my back. You can't do that." So you don't let them see 
your, that, you can't! 
 
JG  36:35 
Do those same rules apply to the mechanic shop? 
 
GP  36:38 
Yeah. Yeah. My mechanic, my female mechanic works circles around the guys in the shop. And it's not 
that everybody doesn't have the same opportunity. But she knows she has to be excellent at what she 
does. And she is. 
 
KC  36:59 
Did you have to, do you have to figure out a way to put up with, or navigate, or get a thick skin, about 
"boys being boys"? "Locker talk?" 
 
GP  37:09 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
24 
Zero tolerance. Zero tolerance. I have zero tolerance. That's how I got around that is that I never allowed 
it at all. And if you really want to stop something like that, when the boy is in front of his friends? 
Embarrass him. 
 
KC  37:27 
Any easy tricks? [laughs] 
 
GP  37:29 
Yeah! 
 
JG  37:30 
This sounds great.  
 
AP  37:31 
Mom knows. What you do is you bring up something— 
 
KC  37:34 
Gina's Rules of Life.   
 
GP  37:35 
So once we were out and we were picking up tires behind Ingold Tire in Durham. And it was pouring, it 
had been pouring down rain, it was still trying to rain, but we're trying to get these tires up in the truck. 
And it was another, it was a girl that—I can't even remember who it was—that I had working for me. 
But we were back there. And we're in this alleyway in the back and then mechanics all come back there, 
"Oh  the girls are back there." And one of them made a comment about wet t shirts. And I don't 
remember what I said now it just flew out of my mouth. But it was something like, "I guess that's all you 
have to do? Since you don't have anything to backup you what you've got—or your equipment?" Or 
something like, it was very smooth. I don't know how. It just flew out of my mouth. And all the guys 
busted out laughing and he put his little tail between his legs went back in the shop. And that was an 
example for the rest of them. And so they would tell new guys when they came out. I actually heard 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
25 
them telling the new guy: "Don't mess with her. Because she will like eat you for breakfast." This is I 
just I had zero tolerance for it. 
 
AP  37:56 
This is a good thing though, in so many ways, because the reputation didn't just stop at a tire store. 
Because you can go into Chapel Hill, go right down here you make a left at the light, or you go down to 
downtown Carrboro-Chapel Hill, area kind of thing. And in that area if you just like, "You know the tire 
lady?" They'll know who you're talking about. It's her. "The tire lady, off 54?" "Oh, yeah, yeah, that lady 
you don't mess with." I go into Sid's shop, Sid knows who she is. You know, you go into any like a local 
somebody kind of places. People know.  
 
GP  39:00 
And that's another one of my rules too ,with the girls, was: Never, ever—if you're interested in a guy—
not on my time, not on my truck. Not with my shirt on your back. Mmm mmh. No. No flirty. No get 
your phone number later. None of that. I won't have it. Whatever you do on your time after work? That's 
your business. 
 
KC  39:41 
Do you think you learn those kind of tough skill sets from the way you grew up? Or from Dad, 
(Grandpa)? 
 
GP  39:55 
No, I think it was—I'm a pretty no nonsense kind of person when it comes to some things. I have really 
high standards. I always have had. But I think possibly that was because I was in foster homes and stuff, 
and I couldn't mess up. Ever. You mess up, you have nowhere to live. You don't know where you're 
going to eat. Or if you're going to eat that day, that night. You may not have a place to sleep that night. 
So I really had to govern myself. [pause] 
 
GP  40:43 
Because I wasn't—just there wasn't room for error. So I think that's, that's it, I couldn't, I couldn't mess 
up. It was a, that was a life or death kind of thing. So yeah. And then I had a child that I was raising by 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
26 
myself, I couldn't mess up. He depended on me. And, and there wasn't, it wasn't like he had other places 
that he could go, you know, there weren't grandparents and there weren't aunts and uncles, and cousins 
and all that, that there. It was just me and him.  
 
AP  41:22 
It's always been a small family. It's always just been the two of us until, until I found Kate. And she and 
I we've got really like into each other together. We've been married. It was just the two of us really? In a 
lot of ways, 
 
GP  41:34 
Kate was a little bit of a girly girl when she first came along. I toughened her up a little bit.  
 
GP  41:40 
She's definitely had, you know, she was coming from being a librarian. So kind of a big difference. 
 
KC  41:48 
And this is because you hired her to work in the shop for a while, right? 
 
GP  41:51 
Yeah. But in in life, too. I mean, sometimes she would come to me with things that she was struggling 
with in her life. And she still does. And, and I just, I'm very logical. And I'm very, and I have really—I 
think I have probably the highest integrity. And that's not bragging. I'm just like, I don't know, anybody 
who has more integrity than than me. But that's carried me through my life. I've always known that if 
I'm honest, and I'm, and I'm straightforward, and I'm good to people, and I'm generous, and I'm kind, 
then everything—I don't have anything to cover. There's nothing to cover up. There's nothing to worry 
about. There's nothing to stress over. And I think good character takes you a long way. I do.  
 
AP  42:52 
You're a hard worker and you're consistent. Like, I mean, in this industry, just being both of those things 
gets you so dang far. And then on top of that, you're smart as a whip. So yeah. But I think from my 
perspective, it's definitely been the persistence. You're more persistent than anybody else. 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
27 
 
GP  43:10 
I am. 
 
AP  43:10 
Because you get those guys in here that are 22. They're ripped. "I'm a football something, something." I 
remember those guys. They're dead in a week or two. 
 
GP  43:19 
They don't make it a week [laughs]. 
 
AP  43:20 
No, no, they're used to doing drills on Fridays, they get a whole week of doing nothing. And then and 
then a thing here and a thing there. And they work out when they feel like it. And so the second that you 
demand of them something that they didn't know. And they don't do it right at all or something? Or they 
have too much machismo for it. So that's why I can't do it. I don't think this because I get in there. Like, 
"Oh, my mom's been doing this for 100 years. I know how to do this." And I end up hurting myself. 
 
GP  43:42 
Now you did help at the store on 86 in Hillsborough, some. You did help. [crosstalk] Oh, I remember 
taking Alex one time, he always wanted to ride in the big truck. And I continued to improve his immune 
system as he got older. And so now he can just go anywhere and do anything. And he did go to school, 
and he just continued to get stronger and stronger and healthier and healthier. So but I remember there 
was one point he goes, "I want to ride in the big truck, I want ot ride in the big truck." And so I'm like, 
"Well, Alex, you know, it's dirty. And there's—" And finally, one day he convinced me he wanted to go. 
So it was like a Saturday and I was gonna go out for half a day. And how old were you like eight? 
 
AP  44:24 
I was seven or eight when you actually took me on the truck, I thought it  was the coolest thing— 
 
GP  44:27 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
28 
Yeah. So he was so excited. We get in the truck and you know, and it's a diesel truck. So is [imitates 
truck engine] wol-wol-wol-wol and its huge. And he's sitting up in the seat. He's all excited. And so I'm 
driving, we're going down the road and he goes, "Where are we going first?" Then I'm like, "We're 
gonna go pick up that dealership over there. We're gonna get their tires first and load them up in the 
truck." 
 
GP  44:45 
So he got out of the truck. Got part of the tires loaded in the truck. And he's like—Roll me, all you got to 
do is roll it to me, right just roll me a tire. So he's rolling the tires. [crosstalk, Alex, "they weigh as much 
as I do"] And he's like, "What time is lunch?" I said, "Well, it's not for a few hours." And he goes, "Oh." 
And I knew what was happening! I knew what was coming. So we get back in the truck. And I'm like, 
"Was that fun?" He's like, he's taking his little gloves off, "Yeah, I guess so." And he's like, "So what do 
we do next?" I said, "We go to the next store and pick up the next store." And he goes, "Mom, I don't 
want to hurt your feelings or anything, but this really isn't my thing." And I said, "Well, that's okay 
honey, tt doesn't have to be everybody's thing." And he goes, "To be honest with you, it's like a bad fair 
ride that you can't get off." [laughs] 
 
AP  45:47 
She'll never let me never forget that. 
 
GP  45:51 
I was already on the way to the house. I knew he had to go home. It was not happening. 
 
AP  45:54 
I was like, "I have made a grievous error. I like large machines. I want to ride in the large machine. Oh, 
no, this work is very gross and physical. This is not my lifestyle. No can do." 
 
GP  46:04 
Oh, it was so funny. 
 
AP  46:06 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
29 
Yeah. It's funny that we ended up in such a different way where I am. I love mechanical things in the 
physicality of all this. Yeah. But my goodness. I just, I don't like getting dirty and gross and sweaty and 
gross and nasty. Like, yeah, so I ended up picking up, instead of doing this, I do electronics, and I do 
like software and all that. But yeah, I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened that we 
got to be so different in that regard. But it was somewhere on that day. I remember that very distinctly, 
as you say, like taking off the gloves— 
 
KC  46:41 
You don't harbor any illusions that he's gonna pick this up?  
 
GP  46:44 
Oh, no, no, no, no. 
 
AP  46:46 
We've had a couple very small conversations here and there. But I've never— 
 
GP  46:50 
About the real estate part. But not about the automotive shop, or the hauling company, or anything like 
that. 
 
AP  46:56 
Just because, me also, like I don't want to, she's got homes out of here where people are like renting out 
of them. I am not the kind of person who wants to have to deal with them either.  
 
GP  47:06 
Real estate is not your thing. Alex teaches all over the world. I think he's— 
 
AP  47:10 
I'm a traveler. I like to be a hermit or a traveler. That's all I can do. So I don't know what's gonna go with 
this. But I'm, I don't know yet. But I definitely don't want to see that it just ceases or like, that becomes 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
30 
an abandoned building or something. So it's been something I've mulled over, but it's like, I've got a long 
time before she's gonna want to retire at this point. 
 
GP  47:33 
Oh, I'm never gonna retire. Oh, no. That would be no fun at all. Why would I do? No, no, no, no. 
 
GP  47:45 
Tell us about—So from the tire business, how did you turn into a brick and mortar auto repair shop? 
 
GP  47:53 
Thank you for redirecting us back to the path!  
 
JG  47:55 
No, this is fantastic. 
 
GP  47:57 
So, um, in 2006, I decided to open my my first used tire shop. And so I opened that one that was really 
good. Then I thought well, you know, I could do another one. So I opened another one. And, it was just, 
it's so fulfilling to know that you're taking—for me—that I'm taking something that is something they 
were gonna throw away. And, and they're, they're just rubber balloons, tires are rubber balloons, that's 
all they are. It's not rocket science. There's nothing tricky about it. They really are just all rubber 
balloons.  
 
GP  48:43 
So if a screwdriver, flies up on the interstate and hits the side of your tire, I don't care what name is on 
the side of it, you're gonna need another tire, another rubber balloon. So it was real clear to me that, you 
know, people could reuse, could use these tires. And so for example, like some of the dealerships, their 
specs are like when cars come in, people trade their cars in, and and they get new tires before they trade 
the car in because they think they get more money for doing that. But what actually happens is they have 
certain specifications, they have to go by in those dealerships. So if you got a size that is different than 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
31 
what came stock on the car, it's a different brand, its a different speed rating. They have to take them off 
and throw them away.  
 
GP  49:30 
Because once that tire is used, I don't care, if it goes on a rim, even if you didn't drive on it, it's 
considered a used tire. They throw them away because they have to put the right tires on the car before 
they can sell it. So guess who gets all of those tires that they throw away? Me. So I get sets of brand 
new, I'm talking hundreds, 1000s, of tires. That there's nothing wrong with them. And to see someone 
come in knowing that they got their social security check, and they weren't going to be able to afford 
tires if they bought groceries, they had to choose between? And I put a brand new set of tires on their car 
for a fraction of what they would pay for new tires?  
 
AP  50:14 
Oh, yeah.  
 
GP  50:14 
Oh, it's so rewarding to help the people in the community like that. And I got a reputation. So 
everybody's like, "Go see the tire lady. She's got the best tires. Go see the tire lady. She's got your tires." 
And so then then I decided when we open the one in Hillsborough, we started doing new tires, too. But 
we started doing like really, really reasonably priced new tires. Like, not name brand, just because I 
would sometimes see people that I thought, "I wish they could have new tires." Like a grandma, that, 
you know, she, you know, she's going that she only goes to the grocery store or whatever. And I 
would—because one thing about us tires is you can't guarantee where they've been, or how many miles 
they went, or if they have a plug in them or not that you didn't see, you know?  
 
GP  51:10 
And so I'd see these like, little old grandma people coming in and getting tires, and I go, "I really would 
like to give her a brand new set of tires." And so I talked to some of the vendors and said, "How can you 
get me like get me in bulk, so that I can pay a lot less so that she can have new tires?" And I found a 
vendor that was willing to work with me and let me get a whole lot the way that they would get a whole 
lot like the ones who were selling them, like wholesale. And so I started doing that. Well I was addicted 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
32 
to that. I was hooked on that right away cuz I was watching these people that never—and they would say 
to me, "Wow! I've never had new tires before." 
 
GP  51:58 
And then I was hooked. I was hooked. I was like, Oh, now I had a new vision. Like I have to get these 
people in new tires that they can afford. And so that became my challenge. And then we started, people 
would say, "Do you know anybody who does breaks? Do you know anybody who does alignments? Do 
you know anybody—?" And so the next thing I knew—Well, I was in the shop in Hillsborough and one 
of my customers came in and he said, "Are you going to buy that shop on 54?" And I said, "What shop?" 
And he said, "Mark Pons."  
 
GP  52:34 
He owns all the Chapel Hill Tires. I've known him for at least 30 years. He said, "Mark Pons has a shop 
for sale." I said, "I don't know, I hadn't heard anything about it". And then I had another customer come 
in. "I heard you were going to buy that shop on 54 from Mark Pons." And I'm like, "I just heard about it. 
I don't know anything about it." I don't even really know that area much other than I knew that dad was 
buried over here at Bethel Hickory Grove Church, at the Bethel Baptist Church, because that's where we 
buried him.  
 
GP  53:04 
But we came in from the other direction. I didn't realize how close it was to where the shop is. It's a 
quarter of a mile. Okay, so this gets really weird. But so, then I had a vendor come in and he said, "Are 
you gonna buy—?" I said, "I'm gonna call Mark Pons is what I'm gonna do." I called Mark. I said, 
"Mark, I hear you have a shop for sale over on 54." He said, "I was waiting on you to call me." I said, 
"Well how does everybody know this but me?" I'm like, "Okay, so I guess I should go look at it." And 
he said, "See you tomorrow morning." 
 
GP  53:40 
So he had someone else give him an offer on it. And he was waiting on me. [crosstalk] So weird. So 
wierd. So I pulled up, looked at the shop, I already knew I was gonna buy it. It was just like, one of 
those things that you know, "This is happening." So I pulled up, Mark pulls up, I look at it, I go, "Okay." 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
33 
He sold it to me for way less than what he had it for sale for that other people had already given him 
offers for. And I'm like, "Okay, this was meant to be. I don't know why. So, I leased the building. All 
this property was owned by Thomas Gates. He owned all this property. And I leased the building from 
him. And everybody said, "Oh, he'll never sell that. That's, you know, their old home place. That's where 
like their house was they grew up in and all that it's been in the family forever." [crosstalk, Alex and 
Gina]  
 
GP  54:46 
So one day my landlord comes into the shop after we moved over here—Thomas Gates—and I said, and 
I started thinking about it. Once I figured out that dad's buried right there. I called Trish. I said, "Trish. I 
got the shop on 54." She said, "I gotta come and see." She comes over. She goes, "You know, dad's 
buried right there." And we didn't come in from that way we came in from the other way. So I said, 
"What?"  
 
GP  55:17 
So we went over there, we went to his grave, and I'm like, "How weird." She goes, "I don't know how 
you landed here, but this is so weird." But I know dad's here. Like I can just feel it, right? And I'm like, 
"okay." So I went—like we picked up six different counties with the tire hauling company. We were not 
in this area at all. He was born and raised in this area, the old home place is right over off of Old 
Greensboro Highway. But he had left and was I mean, they all lived over near Hillsborough, and my 
house is over near Hillsborough. We picked up Sturdivant's. That was the first store I ever picked up, 
was Sturdivant's Tire on 54. That's the one that turned me orange. [laughter] 
 
GP  56:04 
So I end up with a shop right down the road from Sturdivant's Tire. It was all just really weird. So Mr. 
Gates comes in, Thomas Gates, he owns all this. He comes in one day. He's my landlord. I said "Mr. 
Gates, I was thinking about it." I said, "Did you ever know Rossi Brewer [spelling?]? 'Cause dad's dad 
was Rossi Brewer. Dad was Clayton Brewer." And he stops and he goes, "He was my best friend in the 
whole world." And he gets tears. Like he tears up immediately. And I went, "You're kidding." He goes, 
"He died right where you're standing." 
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
34 
JG  56:37 
What? 
 
GP  56:38 
 Where my office is. In my shop. I said, "Wait, what?" He said, "He was killed right there where you're 
standing." Right behind my counter. He was robbed. In 1960, before I was ever born. Right? There, right 
behind my counter, where my counter is now. And I was like I said, he said, "You know, he worked all 
of this land right here." He said out here on the other side of the barn he grew Orange County's biggest 
tomato. There was a picture of it at the library for years. It was in the newspaper. And you know, out 
here is where they had like, they had the moonshine still here in my barn. [crosstalk]  
 
GP  57:25 
In Carrboro there is a little bitty road called Brewer Lane. And it's right there, where I think it's NAPA 
right there, a there part store. Brewer Lane is right off of Main Street. I mean, it's right there. It was 
named after Rossi Brewer, who was dad's dad, because he ran the shine. He ran the moonshine to there 
from the moonshine still that was here at the back of my barn. And they named that road after him 
because of that.  
 
AP  58:00 
That's why you got the old cars out here that you can see are rusting in the woods. Yeah, they're like 
super old rusting cars, I'm sure that those were for running. 
 
GP  58:07 
But it's, it's just the weirdest things. And so one day, one night, I was walking through the shop, I was 
getting ready to close. I mean, it was just so many stories like this, I could go on forever. I mean, people 
would come in the neighborhood, like neighbors and say, "You know, somebody blows that horn at 
night, that truck out there." And I'm like, "What?" And they were telling the mechanics, you know, like 
somebody has been blowing that horn. It wakes us up at three o'clock in the morning. It's a truck with no 
battery in it. Like no. Things fly off the shelves in there in the shop. Like you know, lots of people have 
come in and said, "I used to work in the shop, you know, it's haunted."  
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
35 
GP  58:43 
And like, and I'm like, "No, I don't know about that." So one night I was closing up, I was in bay 3, 
which is the last bay, and I was walking to go turn off the light switch to go to the front. And I looked up 
and there's dad. I'm not kidding you. I've never seen anything like that before in my life. Grinning from 
ear to ear. Nodding his head like, "Good job, girl. Good job." There he was. Right there in my shop. 
 
AP  59:17 
That place is haunted as hell.  
 
GP  59:20 
So I know he brought me here. And then Mr. Gates called me on January 1, 2016, because I bought it in 
2014. He called me January the first 2016 and he said, "You want to buy the whole thing?" He said, 
"Somebody is trying to buy it out from under you. And I'm not gonna let that happen. You want to buy 
the whole thing?" I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "I'll get my lawyer to draw it up." 
 
AP  59:50 
And you ended up with all of this and then that was shaped like a triangle which is just more on top of 
everything. It's like you mean the property shape like a perfect triangle too? And the tip of its the 
Triangle—? 
 
GP  1:00:00 
Well, in the beginning, I mean, you know, the Triangle started from the very beginning. And people 
would ask me when I'd open a new shop, like, "Are you gonna name it something else?" And I'm like, 
"No, I'm not. That's the name I was given. That's the name. It's gonna be. Unless I get a different name, 
that's the one." 
 
JG  1:00:27 
How did you learn the mechanic skills? 
 
GP  1:00:35 
By osmosis? [crosstalk]  I mean, I've taken some classes, after the fact. But— 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
36 
 
AP  1:00:44 
But those were only one-off classes, it's not like where you sat down and went to a college. You know, a 
class here or a class there— 
 
GP  1:00:49 
Yeah, I pretty much, whatever I saw the guys doing, then I just did it. And, you know, of course, I'd go, 
"Is that right? Is that the way that goes?" But I mean, it really is nuts and bolts. It really is. And as far as 
diagnostics, for some reason, I'm really, really, really good at diagnostics. Most people are not. And I 
don't know why. I just have really good intuition.  
 
GP  1:01:20 
And so you know, you kind of, when you when you get a car in, I mean, we have super duper 
equipment. So our scanners like, are the best. All scanners are not created equal, by the way. So if you 
go to a parts store, and you get something scanned, it's, we don't even really call that a scanner.  
 
KC  1:01:40 
Like, Advanced [Auto Parts]? 
 
GP  1:01:42 
I wasn't gonna name any names. But if you go to a part store and you get something scan, it's not the 
same as going to a real shop that has a legit scanner that can tell you what—like, yeah, these are, like our 
scanners a $10,000 scanner. 
 
AP  1:01:56 
I think instinctively people go to a chain, because they say chain, it must be good, but you have to think 
it's chain. It's like McDonald's. 
 
GP  1:02:02 
And see in this industry, it's way different. It's almost the opposite. It's almost the opposite. 
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
37 
AP  1:02:07 
That's what I'm saying. Here, think its a chain, think McDonald's, don't think chain means good. 
 
GP  1:02:10 
And one of the things that I saw going in and out of these shops all these years, was I saw the back end 
of how the business is pretty shady. 
 
JG  1:02:24 
Hmm, from the tires? 
 
GP  1:02:25 
From me going in, like getting the tires, I'll be walking through the shops, you know, with all the 
mechanics and stuff. And like, I knew everybody there. So I knew the manager, the assistant manacer, 
the service rider, the head mechanic, the master mechanics, the tire lube tech, so I knew them all. And I 
heard all the conversations, and I heard you know, they're laughing at some lady who just walked out the 
door and go, "Ha, yeah, she's gonna get four new tires." 
 
GP  1:02:29 
Or, you know, "Yeah, lady you need an alternator and a battery," you know. And I look at him and, and 
I'd go, "Nuh uh, that's not even cool." So, as things grew organically, I jumped out the opportunity to be 
able to at least have one shop that I know is honest, and fair, and straightforward. And my hope is that if 
enough people in the world do that, then a lot of communities, then everybody else has to do it. They 
have to. We will force them to have to get a higher standard as far as being honest. Because, you know, I 
educate my customers too. So they come in and they go, "This guy told me at the shop down there, and 
he said this," and "I'll say come in here, walk under this car with me and let me show you." 
 
AP  1:03:54 
I've had game developers coming out here they got ripped off too,  yeah, my friends and stuff, yhey 
don't know anything from anything because we're not in this world and all that. So one of them— 
 
GP  1:04:02 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
38 
God, poor kid. 
 
AP  1:04:04 
They got an air filter for 100 bucks or something. That's a $15 part. 
 
KC  1:04:07 
Oh yeah, thats—but people really don't know, though. You don't know you can just buy your own air 
filter and knock it out.  
 
GP  1:04:16 
But the filter is a $15 filter. 
 
AP  1:04:19 
Even if you paid someone to do this— 
 
GP  1:04:21 
Yeah, if you paid me to do that filter, I might charge you 20 bucks total. They charged him 100 and 
something dollars for an air filter. 
 
KC  1:04:31 
So did you start kind of small with the services you provided in the shop? 
 
GP  1:04:37 
Well not in this one. The one on the 86 is really, we started doing breaks and oil changes and stuff like 
that over there. But we really didn't have the facilities to do stuff. We couldn't drive the cars, everything 
was outside. We did everything outside. And so when we got this building, then we just, I automatically 
hired the best mechanics because I know everybody in the industry, so it was really easy. I knew who 
was who. And so I hired the best ones who were willing to not throw parts at cars, but actually do what 
they're supposed to do. And— 
 
AP  1:05:21 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
39 
It's not always easy. 
 
KC  1:05:22 
What's the community like in your shop? 
 
GP  1:05:26 
We are the community center. We are the hub of the community. We love our community. We love the 
people here. They're amazing. And this community, I think, has evolved over the years too. So one of 
the stories that I heard, I had, I've had customers come in—Like Alex and Kate, my son and my 
daughter-in-law, got married in 2016. So we had big tents out in the field over there and we did a big 
huge, there were like 100 and something people, and had it all decorated and had a big barbecue thing, 
and so food and banquet tables, [crosstalk] Yeah, it was a whole weekend event.  
 
[1:06:12-1:07:17, talk of Alex's wedding and guests]  
 
GP  1:07:17 
I had customers coming in that Monday, after that was over, and they were saying, "What was that that 
you guys were doing this past weekend?" I said "Oh, my son got married and you guys shoul of stopped 
buy had some barbecue and stuff." And they're like, "Oh, well we didn't know because they used to hold 
the KKK stuff here." 
 
AP  1:07:39 
Little black lady comes in the shop and goes, "That used to be where the clan burned crosses." "My 
yard!?" "Yes sir." 
 
GP  1:07:47 
And so, and I've had so many customers say that we've changed this triangle so much. Because there 
used to be I mean, drug dealers. We got the drug dealers out that were renting the properties, like a lot of 
the neighbors have commented,  
 
AP  1:08:05 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
40 
That used to basically be a secret bar. That was like someone's running a bar out of this little house over 
here that was on the property too. 
 
GP  1:08:12 
Yeah, so it was some bad stuff that was going on [crosstalk]. But now they all know, like everybody in 
the community knows, like, everybody is welcome here. And as long as I'm alive, that's the way it will 
be. And we have a sign in the front window that says: Everybody is welcome here. That means 
everybody, and but just watching, you know, like Miss Ruby. Oh, it makes me tear up every time I think 
about it, but she's like 90-something years old, and she was telling me about how she and her kids like 
used to couldn't walk past this corner. Because the guys would be—whoever it was that had the 
meetings—they would be yelling at them and throwing stuff at them and you know, calling them names 
and like, "You can't come by here." And they were terrified. I mean, she was scared, she was scared. She 
was scared for kids. But she was crying one day and I and I hugged her—this is before COVID—and I 
said, "Miss Ruby, as long as I'm alive, you will always be safe here. I promise you anybody ever bothers 
you, you come get me. And they won't bother you again. It will be one time, but not here. Not on this 
property." 
 
GP  1:09:29 
But just to see their expressions, too see people's expressions about how safe and how welcome they feel 
and how good they feel coming here. They drop their cars off at all, any time of the day or night, and put 
the key in the slot. You know, and the next morning I come in, I don't know whose cars are out there. 
But I mean, they just they know that they can, and I love that. I love that. And then we see neighbors 
like meeting each other and talking and like getting to know one another and going, "You live just over 
there? I was wondering who lived in that house. Oh, I'm so and so," And they have kids and they that are 
the same ages and they go, "Oh, we should do a play date." You know, stuff like that. I just love it. I 
love it. 
 
AP  1:10:17 
Out here there's not—there's not a lot that brings people together. So you know, we've got like, yeah, 
The Plaza down there. [referring to strip mall in Carrboro] But that just feels artificial. You know, that is 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
41 
just something you run in and get your stuff and get out. Maybe you go down to downtown Carrboro. 
That's different than being out here. When you're out here— 
 
GP  1:10:30 
That's right. 
 
AP  1:10:31 
—and something happens. You only have your neighbors and other people really to rely on, so when 
things kind of get weird, you know, you got each other. And I love, and I love, when you said that, I 
almost forgot. My favorite, favorite thing about this shop is how much—the Klan thing is like the most 
blatant, obviously huge difference. Like someone coming in the shop being like, "The Klan doesn't 
come by here anymore." Made my day. That made me feel so good about how we changed it. 
 
KC  1:10:56 
Its so tangible. Like this land, not that long ago, and I have changed it. 
 
AP  1:11:04 
Yeah, you've really made a difference. And it's it becomes like that. That was like the thing that, I think, 
was like the linchpin for me. But I remember the other thing was that they were coming in here, and 
there were people, "I don't have money for tires. But I got a chicken. And I can bring you a couple dozen 
eggs." And so I remember, you come up, I remember—[laughing, Gina, "I have all these eggs!"] A 
hunter came in and he needed to buy tires. "I don't eat deer meat. Here's two packs of frozen venison. I 
have like three pounds of frozen venison." That was great. I remember that one.  
 
JG  1:11:35 
That's fantastic. [Julia explains has to leave interview early.]  
 
JG  1:11:59 
I guess I'm interested in, in how you see—like do people come in and say, see a lady mechanic, like, 
have there been people are like, "Oh, I've never seen that. And I think I might want to try that." Or like, 
you know, a kid who's like, because, you know, I have nieces, who, like, they try stuff out on adults. 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
42 
And they're like, "Well, I don't really get like, why you're, why you have a girlfriend and not a 
boyfriend?" Or you know, like that. And like they'll be really upfront. Like, probably they're not seeing a 
lot of female mechanics. So like, have there been any specific stories that come out of that? 
 
GP  1:12:41 
Yeah. There's one little girl that she's, she thinks that I'm like better than Madonna. She, she and her dad 
live on Neville Road. And I think she's here, do you remember, how old is she? Like 15, 16— 
 
AP  1:12:57 
She's gotta be getting near to college now, because that was a few years ago. There was a couple of 
years ago when we last— 
 
GP  1:13:01 
Yeah, no, but her dad came in, she was so shy. And she was standing behind her dad and he goes, 
"Could you just talk to my daughter? Because she just thinks like, you're the best thing since any 
celebrity that ever lived on the planet." And so, and I just thought that was so sweet. But a lot of a lot 
of—especially dads—bringing their daughters in. They do. They'll say you know, "So what got you into 
this?" And then they'll say, "See Honey? You can do anything that you want to do." And so that does 
happen a good bit. But she was just, that was the best one, because she was so shy and so nervous. You 
would have thought I was like a celebrity, you know, on like primetime TV or something. And I had to 
take her dad home one time when he brought his car in to get something done. And he dropped it off, 
and I had to take him, and she's in the window like [imitaties girl waving and similing] she's like 
[waving and smiling]. She's in my tribe.  
[1:14:03-1:16:41, Julia exits interview, talk of being in touch to schedule return visit to take 
photos]  
 
KC  1:16:41 
That's one of my questions. Tell me about the sign. [referring to cut-out wood, painted sign on front of 
Triangle Tires with portrait of Gina] 
 
GP  1:16:45 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
43 
Oh, so one of my customers is Michael Brown, who's a local artist.  
 
KC  1:16:51 
He's kind of familiar to me.  
 
GP  1:16:52 
He did the sea turtles downtown. Yeah. And he did the bees at the fire department. And so he does a lot 
of murals around town. He's been here forever.  
 
KC  1:17:02 
Yeah, I think he's done some in Durham, too.  
 
GP  1:17:04 
Yeah, he has everywhere, like, pretty much everywhere. But yeah. Bbut he's one of my customers. And 
he came in one day, and I hadn't been open very long. And I had this sign up there that I just painted 
white because I didn't know what I was gonna do with it. It was kind of a weird shape. And, and he 
looks at it and he goes, "So you mind if I. . I have an idea about that sign. Do you mind if I just paint 
something?" And I'm like, "Go for it, Michael. I mean, all that's on there is white paint. And that's what 
he painted.  
 
KC  1:17:36 
Did he take it down? Or?  
 
GP  1:17:37 
No, he got up there with the ladder. And he is the most gifted, talented man. He is the best artist. Like he 
just got up there and free handed every bit of that.  
 
AP  1:17:48 
He is a muralist.  
 
GP  1:17:50 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
44 
He is. He is he's amazing.  
 
KC  1:17:52 
What did that sign do for the shop? Having a big old smiling woman? 
 
GP  1:17:58 
Well, I mean, some people I think, you know, I've had a lot of questions like, "What gave you the idea 
about the sign? Who did your sign?" So I've had a lot of questions about it. But um, I think more than 
the sign people really notice the newspaper article on the wall that the News & Observer did. They'll be 
standing at the counter, and they look over and they go, "That's you, that's you!" And I'm like, "Yeah, 
they did a thing on us when we first opened." And then they'll read it, and they'll go, "Wow."  
 
GP  1:18:34 
And it kind of tells the story, pretty much, most of what I think what we've said today, most of that's in 
there. People like knowing, you know, like on my business card, that second number on my card is my 
cell phone number. They like knowing who it is that they're doing business with. It feels good to know 
that there is an accountable person. It's not just some company and you're gonna call and get some 
corporate something and get put on hold and changed to many departments, you know. I just I think that 
gives people peace of mind. And it feels good. 
 
AP  1:19:15 
What you're describing makes sense because out here, it's like you need that feeling of community 
because everything feels like—especially when you're living in the woods. And I think after 2007 when 
cell phones became like thing—you had to have an iPhone after that point, you know—it's like, after 
that it became a lot more disconnected. So out here, whenever you have a chance, you seem to really 
reach out and grab a person and introduce them to a neighbor, which I like a lot. 
 
GP  1:19:38 
Yeah, I love that. Sometimes we'll put a fruit bowl out you know, I'll just go buy a bunch of fruit. And 
it's like everybody, free fruit. And they love that! Just an orange. Like, "Somebody gave me a free 
orange today." And it brightens their day, it makes—it's an orange.

AP  1:19:56 
COVID hit and then you started putting food, food out— 
 
GP  1:19:58 
I started like doing a huge, yeah. And the church down there, theone that dad's buried that came and they 
would bring us boxes of fresh vegetables like every Thursday. And we were just putting them in the 
waiting room, like, "Take what you want." And it was every kind of vegetable and then meats. We got 
meats and then people started like donating different things to give to the community for people who 
lost their job. They couldn't go to work. A lot of the time we had too much food. [crosstalk] I'd be 
calling Alex going, "Alex, like hydrate [crosstalk]. Like, this stuff's gonna go bad."And it's the weekend. 
You know, it's Friday night, and we're closed on Saturday and Sunday. Its not going to be any good 
Monday. So can you do something with it, you know, dehydrate it, put it in the freezer, whatever." 
 
GP  1:20:02 
You were calling up people. 
 
GP  1:20:13 
Yeah, I was calling people like, "Do you know anybody who needs food?" 
 
AP  1:20:40 
Because we were good. But yeah, when COVID started happening, there was a need. And I think there 
was a big feeling of like, almost like a panic, to getting, to helping everyone.  
 
GP  1:21:02 
Yeah. 
 
AP  1:21:03 
You know, it only got worse after March and in June. It got worse and worse. And then I think there was 
just a point where like, we were, I mean, just recently, we were looking at how to buy food carts and like 
food trucks so she can give away hot dogs out here or something. [laughter] 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
46 
 
GP  1:21:19 
Which I've done hot dogs before. 
 
AP  1:21:20 
Yeah we did hot dog.  
 
GP  1:21:21 
Yeah. We've done a few community days and brought the grill and brought out the slow cookers. And 
just like yeah, I think it's important. 
 
KC  1:21:31 
How awesome. How do people find out you're having a community day? 
 
GP  1:21:34 
We do flyers, and we put them everywhere. And then and usually we tell peopl. Like we'll have flyers, 
I'll have a time, and I make sure that I take some to all the neighbors even. So we do it way ahead of 
time, so everybody knows. 
 
KC  1:21:49 
What changes in the industry have you seen since the mid 90s? 
 
GP  1:21:59 
What's so funny is that— 
 
GP  1:22:09 
Well— 
 
AP  1:22:09 
There are all those electric cars, but they work the same? Like most of that's all the same? 
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
47 
GP  1:22:14 
I can answer that question. Unfortunately, it's not, it's not a good change. Because I think the more 
things that you have that can go wrong, the more things go wrong. And so in the automotive industry—
especially in the, well automotive and tires—constantly new different models, new different kinds of 
cars, new different tires, new different, I mean, it's just constant.  
 
GP  1:22:54 
Like it used to be that, you know, it's pretty much nuts and bolts on the car, and you take a part out and 
you put a part in, it's pretty easy, you test the part with a tester doesn't have any juice, it's no good, put a 
new one in. But now it's gotten, as far as cars go, there's so many. There's so many. There's no where 
that you can go, and they, the mechanics there know how to work on every single car that could possibly 
come in. So you really have to learn as you go. Learn. Take classes and study and read and go online, 
you know, pull up videos.  
 
GP  1:23:43 
The mechanics have to stay sharp, because there's so many new cars coming out all the time. And the 
computer systems are more and more and more complex. [crosstalk, Alex, "That's actually what I do.] 
And so there are more things that can go wrong. So it's harder for the mechanics.  
 
GP  1:24:00 
There's also, I hate to say it, but as these generations of kids are coming up, they they're not so interested 
in working with their hands. And so we are kind of dinosaurs, us, people who do want to work with their 
hands, you know, and so, finding—I think in the future, it's going to be harder and harder and harder to 
find people who want to work on your car.  
 
KC  1:24:25 
I mean part of the reason we're doing this project is because we recognize that the skills you have, and 
that your hands hold, are valuable. And also that when—I think I'm a little older than you, 33 [Alex says 
"31"], so yeah, about the same—but like when I was growing up, you know, my dad worked for 
[crosstalk] the State Department. So office job, you know. And no one ever told me, you know, you 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
48 
could make a living with your hands. And now I'm getting close to my mid 30s and I just am so over the 
computer.  
 
GP  1:25:14 
Yeah, Yeah.  
 
KC  1:25:17 
 Part of this project is to show people that you know learning a specialty skill, you have independence, 
you can have a company, and it is incredibly satisfying. 
 
GP  1:25:30 
It is. It is. It's true. When people bring their, when people bring their cars in, I guess, you know, for me, 
because, because that car is all that you have, between you and that highway. And those other moving 
vehicles. So whoever works on it needs to be extremely good at what they do. Very conscientious. I 
mean, it it is, you have to have a very high level of excellence to be able to do anything on a car. 
Anything at all. It's dangerous if you can't do an oil change right. It literally is dangerous if you can't, if 
someone can't do an oil change right. They can strip out the oil plug, you're going down the highway, 
don't know that your oil is pouring out, the next thing you know, your car stops, everybody's going 80 
miles an hour. 
 
AP  1:26:32 
Oh, and if someone doesn't tighten the lug nut on right, the wheel goes "whoop!" 
 
GP  1:26:36 
So yeah. 
 
KC  1:26:40 
Have you ever thought about having classes? 
 
GP  1:26:43 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
49 
I've thought about it before and I've had people ask me if I wanted to do classes, but—and I even had a 
Girl Scout leader asked me if I would teach her girl scouts, if she brought her little troop up, would I 
teach them, and I said, "Yeah, of course I would." And and I've done that informally— 
 
AP  1:27:00 
You did that? I didn't know you did that, that's awesome.  
 
GP  1:27:03 
Yeah. Just to teach them like basic little things. You know how to check their fluids, how to check their 
tire pressure, how to check the size of their tire, you know, like your tire usually starts with the letter P 
that means passenger. If it starts with LT that means truck that's a heavier flat tire, which means the 
sidewall has more layers on it. So it's thicker, and that's usually for like a pickup truck thats heavier.  
 
GP  1:27:28 
And then the R before the last number? So it's got, like, three sets of numbers. And then there's an R 
before the last number. The last number is your rim size. So you only have one rim size, you can change 
all the other numbers but you can't change the rim size without getting a different rim that's a different 
size. But the R means radial. So when you're ordering tires from somebody, don't say the R. They'll 
know that you're don't know anything about tires. If you say the R. [laughter] 
 
AP  1:28:00 
If you're reading off your number and you say, yeah, 
 
GP  1:28:03 
"It's a 235 75 R 15." 
 
KC  1:28:06 
They already know its an R by the make and the mod—? 
 
GP  1:28:10 
Nobody in the industry ever says R. No. 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
50 
 
GP  1:28:13 
The R is implied, it's like saying Paris, France. 
 
GP  1:28:15 
Let me answer it. [laughs] No. All tires are radial tires now. [crosstalk.] All tires are, so they all have the 
R.  
 
KC  1:28:25 
Well that's a good tip. 
 
GP  1:28:27 
So yeah, just things like that. So I have one lady that worked for me for years. And she got she bought a 
new car and part of the new car, what came with it was that was she got like so many free oil changes.  
 
GP  1:28:43 
So she took it down to the dealership where she bought the car to get the free oil change. And she's 
sitting in the waiting room. She just looks like a little lady sitting in the waiting room. No one would 
know that she did tires or automobiles, you know. So she's sitting there reading her magazine, the guy, 
the little tech comes in there and he's got her tire. And he's got tired chalk marked with a big circle on 
the sidewall of the tire. And he goes, "Mam, you're gonna have to get a new tire because, see right there? 
You've got a hole in your tire, in your sidewall.  
 
GP  1:29:14 
And she looks at the tire. Because this is one of the things in the industry. If I mark it, you'll believe it. 
You don't see anything. I've seen it done—so many—it just drives me insane. Because I'm like, just 
because you see a piece of chalk on a tire doesn't mean there's something wrong with the tire. So she 
said show me where the hole is. He's like "See, I marked it? Right there's the chalk." She's like, "I see 
the chalk, but I don't see a hole." And he's like, "Well, it's in there." She said, "I do not have a hole in the 
sidewall of my tire and you're going to put my tire back on my car, right?" And he said, "Yes, ma'am." 
And he put her tire back on her car and it was fine.  
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
51 
 
GP  1:29:59 
So ot's just little things. [crosstalk, Yeah, a lot.] It's little things like that, though, that, you know that 
when females come in and they go, "Hey, you know, I want to learn something about my car." "Come in 
here and let's go over some stuff and at least—" 
 
KC  1:30:18 
I know where I'm going to bring my car now! [laughs]  
 
GP  1:30:22 
Well, even if they like live in another state or they move somewhere else, at least they can speak well 
enough to not, maybe possibly not, get taken advantage of. And what I tell them is, if you ever have a 
question, I don't care where you are, call me. Just call me and ask me, I'll be happy to tell you, I'll be 
happy to talk to the person at the shop where you are. 
 
AP  1:30:41 
You were ready to go to California and beat up that dude who gave my friend the $100 filter. You're just 
like, 
 
GP  1:30:46 
I was like, "What shop was that? That charged you? Because I'm gonna call him right now. And I'm 
gonna make him refund your money because that is ridiculous. You cannot do that." 
 
AP  1:30:56 
But that is an issue of mistrust that gets then perpetuated onto you. Yeah, customers, they'll come in and 
they'll be like, "$40 for that?" And I'm looking at and like, and you know what, the thing is cost 
normally $60 or $70? 
 
GP  1:31:10 
Well, that doesn't happen often because we have a reputation because everybody knows us in the 
community. But it happens every now and then. Somebody will find us on Google, and then they'll 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
52 
come in and they'll go, "Oh, wait a minute, how much is that?" And they'll be looking up on their phone. 
And I'll say, "Let me give you the model number so that you can look it up so you can see how much it 
is." And then they're like, "Oh, oh, okay." 
 
AP  1:31:33 
Same thing with the U-Hauls. People are coming here with the U-Hauls [referring to the fact that the 
shop also rents U-Hauls.] And they're like, "You're trying to rip me off a U-Haul." And it's like, "We, it's 
actually not us, we have to use their system kind of thing, right?" 
 
GP  1:31:41 
They do the billing. U-haul does all the billing. 
 
AP  1:31:43 
So what happens is customers would come in and be like, "You're trying to rip us off at this price." She's 
like, "Well, here's Enterprise's prices and the other prices. And you can look at you look at—shop 
around. Shop around." 
 
KC  1:31:54 
I have to ask about two things you talked about earlier, but I'm not sure we got them on tape. And then 
I'll—well I'll ask a silly question first, which is, I heard you use the word 'lace' for the tires. And then I 
think that's like, up, when your face your shop on the left, it looks like, is that the term where you kind 
of weave them? 
 
GP  1:32:14 
Those are laced. Yes.  
 
KC  1:32:16 
Tell me a little bit about that, or describe it? 
 
GP  1:32:22 
There is an art to lacing tires.  
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
53 
 
KC  1:32:26 
Julia, who is a sculptor, we walked up and she was like, "Whoa, those are so cool. She saw it right 
away." 
 
GP  1:32:33 
I've had people that I tried to teach them how to lace tires for years, and they never did get it. If you 
have, you have to have a spatial perception and you have to understand angles. But it saves a lot of 
space, it makes the tires snug, so that they don't fall over, you can put more tires in a space. So all the 
tires, when they go in trucks, they're laced in the trucks and I can show you how to do it better than I can 
tell you but, I mean the the point is you want to keep about the same angle. So your first tire goes flat, 
and then your next tire is going to overlap it about 1/3 of that tire and it's going to have about you know 
that much angle depending on the size. So if there are large tires on the bottom, it's gonna have a 
different angle than smaller tires. So you would do it differently. It really is kind of an art. So then the 
third and the fourth and the fifth, and then the very last tire is going to touch the wall. So, no it's going to 
still be at that angle. The next one is going to stand straight up against the wall. So you're not wasting 
any space. Then the next one is gonna angle back in the opposite direction all the way back across. And 
then you just keep doing that— 
 
KC  1:33:50 
Always with the one on the next level, or just for the first row? 
 
GP  1:33:56 
The only one that is flat is that first one. After that it's all about angles. 
 
AP  1:34:01 
And then they go up into the end and then you plunk one down and then you use that to like go across 
[crosstalk]. But if you, but people cannot figure that out to save their lives. Like as we're describing, I'm 
like yeah, I know what you're talking about. This is easy at least. A human being picking these things 
up, it's just— 
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
54 
KC  1:34:17 
Right. I like the term 'lace,' too. Its so description 
 
GP  1:34:21 
Its kind of like shoe laces. 
 
AP  1:34:24 
I got annoyed at something, because it was like years ago, I went on to Twitter or something, and they 
had like a bajillion retweets and bajillion likes, and someone just took a picture of tires in the back of a 
truck. And I'm like, "What is it? What is it? What is everyone like about this?" Like, "It's gorgeous!" 
"Like, what are you talking about?" Like, "It's cool, the way that they stack tires." Like, "It's normal." 
 
GP  1:34:42 
[laughs] That's how you grew up. Those tires raised you! 
 
AP  1:34:48 
People tell me it's a thing, they're like, "Oh, yeah, it's because, the tires if you just stack them straight up, 
they'll fall over and kill somebody. You gotta—" You know, unless you're, you're getting easy retrieval.  
 
KC  1:34:57 
Right. Structural integrity. And the other question was just could you, this is obvious, but could you 
speak to how unusual it is in this area and even, you know, the state, or the country to have a woman-
owned tire and auto shop?  
 
GP  1:35:15 
It's so rare. It's so rare. [laughing] Its— 
 
KC  1:35:23 
Like, do y'all have an association where you stick together?  
 
GP  1:35:26 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
55 
Oh, no. No. No, and I don't think there are enough women in the industry to even do that. I know one 
woman in New Jersey. I know one in California. There's one I think there's one in Charlotte. I mean, it's 
just rare.  
 
KC  1:35:42 
Crazy.  
 
GP  1:35:43 
Yeah. 
 
KC  1:35:44 
And the other thing was just to get you to talk a little bit more, I think you said, at the beginning, kind of 
quickly, that your dad's grandma was American Indian? 
 
GP  1:35:55 
Yeah. Wheeler was their last name, which they, their names always are according to what they do. And 
so they made wagon wheels. That's what his family did way back when. So it's just kind of odd. It's I 
don't know what the connection is. But it's odd. 
 
KC  1:36:19 
It adds another layer of, it was meant to be, kind of— 
 
GP  1:36:23 
Yeah. Yeah. 
 
KC  1:36:25 
Do you know what tribe they were? 
 
GP  1:36:27 
My dad's mother was Apache. And my dad's dad was Cherokee. And then there was something else 
mixed in there. But I remember my grandmother, especially—my dad's mother—was very much 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
56 
Apache. [laughs] She was one of those, she was a no nonsense person. And, and, you know, people used 
to tell me that I, I looked a lot like her. When my hair was darker. It used to be a lot darker. But it used 
to be like the color is— 
 
KC  1:37:02 
I want to see a picture of you when you were young, hauling around tires. 
 
GP  1:37:08 
Oh, there are some on Facebook.  
 
AP  1:37:10 
This isn't even. I have closer to my dad's hair. Her hair is black.  
 
GP  1:37:14 
Yeah, it's dark. It's darker than my eyebrows.  
 
KC  1:37:16 
I can see it in your face a little bit.  
 
AP  1:37:18 
We can go get some childhood pictures of me and her, she looked, yeah, she's got some really dark, dark 
hair back then. And then at some point, you're like, I want to be blonde. 
 
GP  1:37:36 
No, what happens is, when you get so much white in your hair, then you just decide instead of like 
trying to keep up with dark roots, you just make it have 'golden hues.' 
 
KC  1:37:51 
My mom did the same thing. And like after being a proud brunette her whole life, like and kind of 
rolling her eyes at blondes. She's like now I'm a blonde!? 
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
57 
AP  1:38:00 
Guess who used to tell me dumb blonde jokes? This one, this one over here! 
 
KC  1:38:06 
Yeah. Okay. And then another question we like to ask everybody which is, you know, take it as you 
will, but what, what is your favorite tool when you're working in the shop? 
 
GP  1:38:27 
My favorite tool. . . it would have to be my air gun. 
 
AP  1:38:34 
Yeah, I was trying to think of how— 
 
GP  1:38:36 
I have my own personal air gun that no one else can use. And that's the gun that you put a socket on, and 
you put on the lug nuts to take the lug nuts off the tires, and put the lug nuts on the tires, and it hooks 
into an air hose. And so you know, it makes big noises and it does incredible things. It is really really 
powerful. It would be my air gun and it's my personal one. I don't let anybody else use mine.  
 
GP  1:39:05 
Like I own all the air guns in the shop. But my personal—and I have a little petite one—it fits my hand! 
It's almost like people who have a preference for their golf club I guess or their you know, it fits my 
hands. Some of the guns, the air guns, are so heavy and so big. And you have to hold it with two hands 
and you're like shhhh shhhhhhh [imitaties using it] and by the end of the day your arm is shaking you 
know? After doing that all day? But my little one it goes zzzz zzzz.  
 
KC  1:39:37 
And how much are you in the shop working or you know, do you still do hauling? What does a work 
day look like for you now. 
 
GP  1:39:46 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
58 
I scaled way down on the hauling. So I'm still hauling some, but not much, and usually about maybe a 
half a day a week. And in the shop, I'm in and out of the shop some, it depends on the season, because it 
is seasonal. Like in the spring—spring, summer, fall—we're usually crazy busy. And I'm usually in the 
shop six days a week. But then in the winter time, it slows down like after Thanksgiving. And then the 
whole month of December and January, usually it's steady but then I usually find other things that I can 
do during that time.  
 
GP  1:40:30 
But this past year with COVID, ee didn't we didn't close. Not one day, not one day. But we have like an 
EMS workers and firefighters and doctors, nurses, people who work at the grocery store. And, and so I 
mean, their cars had to go. They couldn't stay at home. So they needed their cars done, you know, so we 
couldn't stop. We just worked right through it. We had face shields, we had gloves, we had masks, we 
had Plexiglas in the—and we'd have people waiting their cars, when this was really, really bad. We tell 
them like, "Stay in your car. And when I'm ready for your car, just leave the key in it." And they never 
had to come close to us. We didn't have to come close to them. 
 
KC  1:41:16 
Everyone was safe in the shop? 
 
GP  1:41:18 
Yeah. 
 
AP  1:41:19 
There was actually kind of a funny thing that—she put the plexiglass up and I remember you coming 
over to my place. "They keep trying to walk around it!"  
 
GP  1:41:25 
Oh my gosh. 
 
AP  1:41:26 
She put up the plexglass and they'd start leaning over, like, "Hey..."  
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
59 
 
GP  1:41:28 
No, they would walk up to the plexiglass, especially the U-Haul customers. They're coming to get a U-
Haul truck. And they're just, their minds going 100 miles an hour, because they got—they're moving! 
They're stressed. They're thinking about everything they have to do. They're just not thinking. And so 
they walk up to the plexiglass and they'd be behind it. Then I'd say I need your driver's license plates. 
They hand me their driver's license through the little hole, you know? And then I'd say, okay, and I'd be 
typing in their stuff. And I'd say and, "I need an additional contact person." They would lean around the 
Plexiglas to say, "Oh, that would be my wife. And her name is—" And I'm like, "Please stay behind the 
Plexiglass. I can hear you just fine, please." But they would forget, like they weren't used to speaking 
behind a shield. And it was hard for and they're like, "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah." So I had to finally put a sign 
up there that said, "Please stay behind the plexiglass." 
 
AP  1:42:21 
And you put a stack of tires on the left side— 
 
GP  1:42:23 
I did. I put a fountain on one side and a stack of tires on the other side to try to keep them in the middle 
behind the plexiglass. They would lean over the stack of tires or the fountain in order to like speak to me 
around the Plexiglas. It was a mental thing.  
 
AP  1:42:38 
When COVID first hit, and UNC [Chapel Hill] shut down, and they're like "You all have to go home." 
So all the U-Hauls in the area got slammed. 
 
GP  1:42:45 
Oh, we were so busy.  
 
AP  1:42:47 
And we're the only one yeah, right here.  
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell

GP  1:42:50 
And we didn't know, nobody at that point knew, what, who, what, when, where, how or why. I mean, we 
didn't know, is it airborne? Is it aerosol? Is it like..? Nobody knew a thing. And that was scary. That was 
scary. But I mean, we, we did everything that we were supposed to do and more. And kept everybody as 
safe as we possibly could, which was usually meant that they didn't come in contact with us. And we 
didn't come in contact with them. 
 
AP  1:43:21 
It was a frustrating thing I remember for you, because you would come over to talk to me, you know, 
she just walked out of there, walk over, talk to me at the end of the day, and I remember you talking to 
me, like I'm doing so much. And the customers will walk in, and they will just ignore the things, or they 
just don't care, or they do, and then they're terrified. And yeah, over that period of time, it got really bad 
for you, where you used to be able to easily reach out to your customer and say, "It's gonna be okay." 
 
GP  1:43:46 
Oh, you couldn't hug them. You couldn't do anything to comfort them. That was so hard. To see the fear 
in their eyes. That was hard. 
 
AP  1:43:56 
And a lot of people who come into the shop don't speak enough English, to really understand— 
 
GP  1:43:59 
We have, we have so many people. We have a whole Tibetan village that's right down 54. 
 
KC  1:44:07 
That's my next interview project. 
 
GP  1:44:10 
And all those guys come down here and none of them speak English. They have one person out of the 
whole entire place that speaks. 
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
61 
KC  1:44:18 
There's a temple there? 
 
GP  1:44:19 
Yeah. So there are about 200 and something of them that are there. [Referring to Dha Mii Karr Yarr Ma 
Kyoung Dhammikarama Temple, 2214 N Carolina Hwy 54 W, Chapel Hill, NC]. And they all come 
here to bring their cars because I've learned how to understand what they're saying. So they come in and 
they go, they have their key and they go, [imitating] "Oil change?" That's oil change. Or they come in 
with the registration in their hand and I go, "State inspection." And I take it and I say thank you. They go 
said they don't have to, they know they don't have to do anything, that I'm going to, or they'll start saying 
something. They speak Karen. And no one speaks Karen. I tried to find a translator. I coudn't. 
 
AP  1:45:01 
We actually tried to help them— 
 
GP  1:45:02 
Because they were wanting to get automobile insurance. And so the one, the one leader, the one guy 
who translates out of the whole place, and he's always busy, can't always, you know, he doesn't come 
with them. But if it's something really important, like they need, like, major thing done to their car, I 
write it down, they take it back to him. And then he might come with them, you know, the next time and 
talk about it.  
 
GP  1:45:27 
But he came in one day, and he said, "Do you sell automobile insurance?" And I said, "No, we don't, 
but—" And he said, "Well, we have a problem, because no one knows how to speak to anyone about 
automobile insurance." And I said, "Okay, hold on, we'll find somebody. So I called all the major 
insurance companies, and I called their, like corporate numbers, trying to find someone with a translator 
who spoke Karen. No, not one of them does. And finally, the lady down here at Carrboro Plaza, I talked 
to her and she said, "If you will send them to me, I'll make sure that they get what they need, and not 
more than what they need, and that they won't get taken advantage of" Because they are the sweetest 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
62 
people. And so I said, "Thank you so much." Because I was so stressed about how am I going to find 
someone who's going to care about these people, and not harm them. You know. 
 
AP  1:46:29 
Its so easier take advantage of people who don't speak the language. I travel a lot too, when I'm in Spain, 
people try to take advantage, when I was in India, people trying to rip me off constantly, wherever I go, 
you know, it's the same thing for them. They're in another place. They're out of their element. And it's 
bad enough— 
 
GP  1:46:43 
And they're refugees. I mean, where they came from, like, they came from Burma.  
 
[1:46:52-1:48:02, Katy tells them about Transplanting Traditions Community Farm nearby and 
offers to help connect Gina to a Karen translator if needed in the future.] 
 
GP  1:48:02 
Okay, I got to tell you a funny story. So this is awful, but it's funny. Okay. 
 
AP  1:48:08 
Oh, I know what story this is. 
 
GP  1:48:10 
Oh my god, I felt so awful. Oh my god. All right. So I also I love all animals, you know, and I've got 
like four dogs and a bunch of kitties, farm kitties, and feral kitties and Alex ended up with some of my 
motor kitties that were in my truck motor that, that he adopted three of those. So but and everybody 
around knows that we love animals. And I think that's why we just keep getting, they mysteriously 
appear.  
 
AP  1:48:41 
If people lose a cat or something they come over here and ask us.  
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
63 
GP  1:48:45 
Yeah, we're the hub. They put up fliers over here and stuff. But anyway, so I put—because people bring 
their dogs in—and sometimes you know, they bring their dogs in and I have this container with dog 
treats. Dog biscuits. And, and so they're just the Milkbone dog biscuits on the counter. And they're in 
like a Tupperware container.  
 
AP  1:49:07 
This story happend pre-COVID,  I should also— 
 
GP  1:49:10 
Yeah, this is way before COVID. So I had a couple of my little Tibetan monks come in and they had on 
you know, the little thing they were It looks like a sheet like a What's it called? It's called a no, but it 
looks it looks like a small sheet that goes over one shoulder. It looks kind of like a toga. Yeah. But that's 
what the word I was trying to think of it looks kind of like a toga.  
 
GP  1:49:37 
So they come in, and this one little guy, and you know, the translator was there and there was like three 
of them. And two of them were really, really elderly. And they just grin from ear to ear. They don't 
understand a word you're saying. You know, they're not saying a word. They're just standing. No, they're 
just waiting. Because Translator is the one you know, he's got a car, and he needs this and that and that.  
 
GP  1:50:01 
And so I'm speaking to the translator, I'm not really, and I see the cute little old guy you know who's 
probably 80-something, 90-years old, standing there, in this little toga. And I'm talking to the translator 
and all of a sudden I hear, crunch crunch crunch crunch. And I look, and he's grinning from ear to ear, 
and he's noddibg his head like, "These are really good cookies!" That's the look on his face. 
 
AP  1:50:26 
Its not going to hurt him, there's no way you can do something quick enough to get him to stop— 
 
GP  1:50:30 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
64 
I'm like, "No, No!" And he's like, and he's still nodding his head smiling, as he's crunching the cookie. 
And I'm like, "I'm gonna go to hell!" Oh my god, I'm gonna be standing in front at Judgment Day, and 
they're gonna go, "Did you let the little—?" "No, I did not let him eat the cookie!"  
 
GP  1:50:52 
So then I'm like, how can I? Okay, there's nothing I can do about that one. He already ate the Milkbone. 
He really liked it. So how can I stop this from happening? And again, I know, I'll go in the magazine, 
and I'll cut out a picture of a dog, and I'll put a picture of a dog on the front of the container. So that's 
what I did. I cut out a picture of the dog, and I put the dog, taped it on the front of that Tupperware 
container and I left it on the counter. 
 
KC  1:51:20 
This is while they're still there? 
 
GP  1:51:22 
No! This was later, it was too late about that I, that container disappeared quickly, like as soon as I could 
get it off the counter. But then I had to figure out what am I going to do. So I put a picture of a dog on 
the front of that for you know, like the next day or whenever.  
 
GP  1:51:40 
So then it was a different day. And I'm standing at the counter and it was almost exactly the same 
situation. And I had a picture of a dog on the front of the Tupperware container. And those are really 
apparently good cookies. 
 
AP  1:51:56 
He went for it again! 
 
GP  1:51:58 
He opened the container took the cookie out. It was like slow motion. I was like, "Noooooo!" And it was 
too late. Crunch, crunch. And he's just graded from ear to ear, like, "Thank you for the cookie!" So we 
don't have the container on the counter because I did not know how to make that right.  
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
65 
 
AP  1:52:16 
We gotta put some cookies out there.  
 
KC  1:52:17 
Your hospitality is good. 
 
GP  1:52:19 
[laughs] I did not know how to make that right. He's probably disappointed. "Like, oh, man, she's used 
to have really good cookies on the counter."  
[1:52:28-1:53:55 Alex shares a story of eating fish in Finland, Katy begins to close interview.]  
 
KC  1:53:56 
But just kind of open ended, is there anything else you feel like it's important for people to understand 
about this business or your story? A moment of reflection. Or your hope for its future? 
 
GP  1:54:20 
Well, I think it's really important, that when you find somebody that you trust, stick to the person that 
you trust in, because— 
 
GP  1:54:43 
We can go to chains to buy things, and to get services, but they don't care about us. You know? It's small 
businesses. They care about the people in the community. And I hope that that's the wave of the future.  
 
GP  1:55:02 
I hope that we all can be diligent enough, care enough, be patient enough, and maybe even spend an 
extra 50 cents, to go buy the dress from the local shop, you know, the lady that that has the local shop on 
the corner. I think communities are important. And I, I hope that we, we learned a lot in the last year and 
a half, especially during COVID, about who we support matters, it really does matter. And if we support 
our communities, then we have good communities, if we don't support our communities, then we don't 
have possibly have good communities. You know?  
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
66 
 
GP  1:55:43 
So I'm hoping that people will—because it's a little harder, to go to three or four different shops to get 
things, you know, rather than go the one big superstore to get everything. But if that's all you have in 
your community, then you're not. . . ? I don't know, I think, I mean the people that own the little shops 
are the ones who live in your community. That is your community. Those are your neighbors. You 
know?  
 
GP  1:56:13 
So I'm hoping that that's gonna be—that's the wave of the future. And I know, I mean, I'm just as guilty 
as anybody else who run into the big superstore, because I need several things, and they have every 
department you know. They have, they have an automotive department, they have a home goods 
department, they have a grocery store in the middle of the store, they even have a place where you 
know, you can, like they have pretty much anything that you want to buy, and you might even get it a 
little cheaper there. 
 
GP  1:56:48 
But, in the grand scheme of things, what are we building?  
 
KC  1:56:56 
What do you lose by saving 50 cents?  
 
GP  1:56:57 
Right? Or having the patience to go, "Yeah, I'm going to go to three shops instead of one big 
superstore." 
 
AP  1:57:06 
I think I think saying that it's cheaper is actually like, even wrong, because just thinking about how 
you've changed things here, like you can. Where you were, where there's now a Kangaroo, right? Think 
about that. People could go to that shop, when it was your shop, and say, "I'm starving", and all these 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
67 
other things, and I have problems in life, and you would hear them out. And then you could help them. If 
you go to that kangaroo and you're like, "I need a tire and my life is in shambles." They don't care. 
 
GP  1:57:33 
Yeah, they don't care. 
 
AP  1:57:34 
They have to go, it has to go to someone higher up and higher up, and then they're never gonna be able 
to really help you as a person. So just thinking about that specific example of where you were those 
people losing out. Maybe— 
 
GP  1:57:45 
Yeah, that community for sure. 
 
GP  1:57:48 
We used to go feed the homeless people. Like I would cook, and we'd go feed him on the back of my 
Volvo, when Alex was little. Because there are a lot of people that live in the woods over there near the 
tire store, and you just kind of get to know these things, you know.  
 
GP  1:58:03 
So I would cook a whole big huge meal. And we'd go over there and they'd come out of the woods. And 
we would have all the foods set up like a buffet at the back of the Volvo. It was totally unofficial, but I 
just knew that people were hungry, and they don't get a hot meal. And they don't want to go down to 
someplace where you know, [crosstalk, Alex, "they're going to get judged"]  
 
GP  1:58:27 
Yeah, or, or maybe it's too far away, they don't have cars. Or maybe it's—there's a string attached to it, 
there's something that they don't want to have to, they don't want to have to stay there or they don't want 
to, or maybe other people are not so nice to them there. I mean, I had, I also used to do, I've done a lot of 
different things.  
 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
68 
GP  1:58:47 
But one of the things I used to do was a program in Durham for at-risk youth in Durham, to help get 
them out of gangs. And I had kids that would come in. And so I worked with social services, and we 
would do things like, get them the right clothing and teach them how to fill out an application, teach 
them how to do an interview, take them to the job interview coach them through it, talk to potential 
employers, like you know, and trying to get them off the street. Trying.  
 
GP  1:59:19 
I mean, I had kids that had never filled out an application didn't know how. They didn't know how to 
look you in the eye and shake your hand and say "Hi, I'm so and so," you know, when they meet 
somebody. They didn't know to do stuff, who's gonna teach them that? And so, but I remember, I had 
this one meeting that I was going to teach all the kids like about the same thing. And so I invited a whole 
group of them to come on that following Thursday or whatever it was. And a lot of the kids came for 
thay—it was like some orientation for something—but a couple of them didn't come.  
 
GP  1:59:57 
And I was surprised because I'm like, "Where are they?" And so they came in a couple days later, the 
ones that didn't come to the meeting. And I said,  "I was surprised that you weren't here for the meeting. 
Remember, we talked about the meeting and I wanted to, like, show you something."  
 
GP  2:00:11 
And they're like, "Well, we couldn't come because the other gang was here. We can't be in the same 
place with them because somebody will get hurt." Like one gang can't be in the same place that another 
gang—gang members. They are kids. But they couldn't be in the same building because that wouldn't be 
a challenge to the other game. 
 
AP  2:00:35 
There was a day you came home, you said something to me along the lines of, it really hits you. One of 
the kids was literally like, "You are going to be okay or not okay and it's based off of one factor and 
that's whether or not you can have a pair of shoes." And I remember you saying like, "The difference 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
69 
between a good person and a criminal is just whether or not they have shoes, or like whether or not they 
have the thing—" 
 
GP  2:00:56 
For some of these kids, yeah.  
 
AP  2:00:58 
But I just remember being like the difference between a good kid and a criminal kid was just shoes. 
 
GP  2:01:02 
To be able to have, to get a pair of shoes that they could wear to a job interview. 
 
AP  2:01:09 
So that's what a lot of it comes down to out here. If people struggle, its poor in places, and it's all that, if 
she can do something to give them an easier deal or something. It's great. 
 
KC  2:01:19 
Is that the most rewarding part of this work, the way— 
 
GP  2:01:24 
Oh, yeah. 
 
KC  2:01:24 
—you can kind of wrap your arm around so much more than their tires? 
 
GP  2:01:28 
Oh, it's my ministery. It's my ministry. Yeah. It's never been about the business part as much as it's about 
the people. Its my ministry. 
 
AP  2:01:40 
You wouldn't be happy if you weren't fixing— 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
70 
 
GP  2:01:41 
That's why I'm like I'm never gonna retire. Are you kidding me? Because they're always going to be 
people that need stuff. 
 
AP  2:01:51 
Another nice development is, like the Food Not Bombs guys.  
 
GP  2:01:54 
Oh, yeah.  
 
AP  2:01:55 
They actually started opening up things down the road here, where it used to just be us giving out food 
here. But then I saw on Twitter, someone's like, "Oh, they opened up a couple of things out here where 
you can go." 
 
GP  2:02:03 
Yeah. 
 
AP  2:02:05 
It's a completely different area. If you came here 60 years ago, right, you would not want to be here for 
five minutes. 
 
KC  2:02:09 
Well, I hope we get more of those kinds of signs. As opposed to Amazon tires. 
 
GP  2:02:16 
Yes. Or Amazon, whatever. Yeah, I agree. 
 
KC  2:02:21 
Well, thank you both, I'm going to close with— 
afc2020009_015—Gina and Alex Paschall interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
71 
GP  2:02:24 
Okay.
Later on that evening, after reflecting on the interview, GP texted JG: "After the fact, I realize the most 
important part of the story wasn't recorded. What I referred to as 'intuition' is my profound faith in and 
guidance from our Creator. That is the true wind beneath my wings."
