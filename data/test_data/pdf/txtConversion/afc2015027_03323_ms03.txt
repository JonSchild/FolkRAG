Christine Lewis interviews Lorna Robley 
Section 1 of 15 [00:00:00 - 00:10:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
00:00:00  Christine Lewis introduces herself and the interview project.  Lorna provides her name, 
occupation (“babysitter”). 
00:00:30  Lorna lives in Brooklyn, originally from Trinidad.  Came to U.S. not for work but because her 
son wanted to pursue his education. 
00:01:00  How she decided to come and join her son.  Son came at age 17, now an attorney. 
00:01:30  How she was a seamstress in Trinidad. Came to do her sister’s wedding:  because I used to sew 
at home in Trinidad. I was a seamstress. When my sister decided that she wanted to get married I came 
to do her wedding, and her son’s also, then decided to stay when someone offered her a babysitting job. 
00:02:00]  Working in America as babysitter for about twenty years. How Caribbean people dislike the 
term “domestic worker” (Christine and Lorna discuss this). 
00:02:30]  How domestic work is good work and it is a choice. Babysitters care for the most important 
thing in their employers’ lives, but are still not respected.  Why this is the case historically. Domestic 
work being excluded from labor laws. 
00:03:30  Inferiority of the job linked to slavery, leading to disrespect. 
00:04:00  They agree the work is good work. 
00:04:06  Inaudible section.  How many positions Lorna has had babysitting (avoids “domesticated 
work” in favor of nanny work).  Avoids washing but doesn’t mind cooking.  
00:04:30  Lorna doesn’t mind cooking.  Discussion of Lorna’s great zucchini bread. 
00:05:30  Lorna’s choice to cook because she loves cooking but setting other limits around her job 
description, despite risk of being fired. 
00:06:05.  Typical day on Lorna’s job.  She used to do live-in work.  Live-in work never has an “ending” 
time, difficult. May start 6:30 AM.  
00:06:30 Children go to school at 7:30AM. Get them up, get breakfast, drive them to school. 
00:07:00  Known abilities like driving can become part of your job. If bus has problems you drive, come 
back, then employers ask for “a favor,” washing. Christine adds other examples.  Lorna provides other 
example of favors and errands if children are not in house.  How favors snowball but there is no extra 
pay.  
00:09:00   Job hours can also change when children go to school.  Living in is not necessary if child goes

to school full time. 
00:10:00   Christine agrees. 
End of section 1 of 15 [00:00:00 - 00:10:04] 
Section 2 of 15 [00:10:00 - 00:20:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
00:10:00  When employers insist she come to clean, rather than babysit she said no and explained she 
would be leaving.  Current job has lasted 11 years. 
00:10:30  Current job involves an autistic boy at present. [interview interrupted by a phone call] On first 
meeting Lorna notices boy keeps walking and walking. The meeting is brief and Lorna wonders what is 
going on.  Woman father dies so she asks Lorna to start the next Monday.  Burial is immediate as family 
is Jewish. 
00:12:30  Child was six when she started. Mother never told her child was autistic—she could have 
researched it or asked questions if she had. 
00:13:00 Eventually a fellow Caribbean babysitter told her the child was autistic based on which school 
he was going to. Referred her to the movie about autism, Rain Man. So she watched the movie to 
understand. 
00:13:30  Mother is a corporate lawyer.  She agreed in this case to live in. It has been challenging. 
00:14:00 The brother is OK but babysitting the autistic brother is an experience. 
00:14:30  Description of the autistic child’s abilities/behaviors.  He is verbal but does head banging. 
00:15:00  Noises have a bad effect on him. Dangers of walking out in public, in traffic, lack of a sense of 
direction or ability to stop walking. 
00:16:00  Child’s habit of bumping into people.  It seems like an attack and can provoke people.  Child 
bumped into a man who dropped his phone. Man almost punched him.  She has to explain to people 
and apologize to them. Puberty has created additional problems, child exposing himself in public, in her 
company. How this is a special needs child. 
00:18:00  More about the daily care routine.  Wakes up at 6AM.  She mostly lives out but sometimes she 
lives in to do this work, when mother is travelling.  She prepares him for school, makes his breakfast. 
00:18:30  Then she makes lunch.  Brother leaves for school at eight. Lorna drinks coffee then goes back 
to prep for autistic child. If bus runs late, child gets agitated.  She tries to explain this to him. 
00:19:30  Reasons the bus may be late.  Despite explanations, child paces and talks about bus.

Section 3 of 15 [00:20:00 - 00:30:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
00:20:00   Continues story of daily routine—difficulties of going out in public when he doesn’t 
understand about not talking about or touching penis.  How he is “a man” but is also exploring like a 
baby and doesn’t understand. Ages of both brothers, autistic boy 17 now, the other 10 going on 11. How 
Lorna makes an announcement on the train to alert people to what is going on.  He is tall now. 
00:21:30  It is not obvious anything is wrong since he looks like a handsome young man.  She has to 
travel with both boys. Younger brother carries a book everywhere, to block it out.  People move out of 
their way. 
00:22:00  How brother tunes out what is going on. 
00:22:21  How Lorna is not sure whether older boy knows he is not supposed to do this, whether he is 
doing this deliberately or not.  
00:22:30  Discussion of how a five year old by comparison can be said to be understanding they are 
doing something deliberately that they are told not to. 
00:23:00  How older boy continues this behavior.  Attention-getting is part of it so she tries turning her 
back to the behavior. Christine points out Lorna must be watching this boy 24/7 because of the risks of 
his behaviors, dangers to him physically of pacing indoors. How sometimes he does extreme jumping 
behaviors with his parents that he does not do with her.  
00:24:30  How employers may blame Lorna for these behaviors, and how dangerous it is to be jumping 
around windows in a high-rise. 00:25:00  How window jumping behavior started around age 8. 
00:25:30  How responsibility for these behaviors should be shared, if parents see it. Dangers of older 
brother taking hold of his brother’s stroller. 
00:27:00  How Lorna’s job is two jobs in one.  Special needs teacher without any training, while also 
cooking for/attending to the other child. 
00:27:41 How she was hospitalized with a panic attack the first year she worked with this family, 
thinking it was a heart attack. 
00:28:00  Details about this panic episode. Taken by ambulance to hospital, ran tests, concluded it was 
anxiety brought on by job stress.  
00:28:30  Christine agrees, repeating sources of stress of Lorna having to watch boy constantly.  It has 
been 11 years.  Christine expresses curiosity about what employers must be thinking. 
00:29:30 Christine asks why employers would hire Lorna to go on the train at all.  Why should she have 
to make these public announcements.  It’s not fair to Lorna or the passengers who don’t understand. 
00:29:48  Reflections on what the correct words are to describe his condition, how illness does not have 
a “look.”

00:30:00  Christine says it is unfair to the caregiver. 
End of Section 3 of 15 [00:20:00 - 00:30:04] 
Section 4 of 15 [00:30:00 - 00:40:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
00:40:04  Lorna agrees situation is unfair to her. Christine asks why employers didn’t pay for a taxi or cab 
service for them. Lorna told them about it but notes that it doesn’t happen to the mother, because they 
themselves take a taxi. 
00:30:30  Now that parents are separated she travels with the brothers on rush hour trains on Friday 
evenings to meet their father.  On Wall Street.  The employers have money. 
00:31:00  Discussion of employers’ wealth.  How her telling them results in blank looks.  They blame her 
rather than understanding the embarrassment.  It happened to father in Florida on beach and he 
blamed Lorna, calling to ask her why this was happening.  Christine empathizes, offering a related 
experience. Lorna becomes emotional. 
00:33:00  Christine affirms this is why Lorna is telling her story, the indignity and unfairness.  How other 
caregivers have had experiences with ACS. 
00:33:30  Lorna shares how she has had ACS problems, boy once said that she hit him, related to the 
window jumping behaviors and again, more recently. He told someone at his new school that she hit 
him with a spoon so she was investigated.  
00:34:06  Christine asks why Lorna stays.  Lorna replies she is connected to this boy. Christine affirms 
this as bonding, love. 
00:34:45  Lorna believes this is because of her difficulty leaving her own son.  How Lorna’s son asked her 
not to leave one time. 
00:35:30  How Lorna’s granddaughter tried to play with the autistic boy and the boy ran away.  Father 
(her employer) was upset, so Lorna’s son urged her not to leave the job. 
00:37:00  C and L discuss leaving children to take care of other children and difficulty of advancing.  
Lorna could have been certified to care for special needs children but her employer made sure she had 
something else for her to do at that time. 
00:38:30  C describes walking off some jobs due to stress and difficulty of pacifying babies, much less 
autistic children. 
 00:39:30  Lorna describes getting up at night, difficulty of sleeping when child gets up in middle of the 
night.  Boy puts all the lights on.  She went for a massage to release her tension.

Section 5 of 15 [00:40:00 - 00:50:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
 
00:50:04  Continued discussion of sleep deprivation and insomnia. Low salary in comparison to other 
jobs.  What it is like when ACS, Child Protective Services come.  Lorna describes an investigation that 
lasted six months, with three visits, finding nothing. 
 
00:46:00  How Lorna limits her contact with autistic boy now.  Christine describes her relationship with 
boy she nannied as a child.  Phone conversations with their charges.  
 
00:48:12  Lornia tells about most recent break from the family, when she calls daughter to get her on a 
flight to Trinidad.  Difficulty of leaving autistic boy behind.  
 
00:49:00  Christine asks Lorna what foods she cooked.  Introduced him to Caribbean curry and rice, 
which he likes.  When she leaves she has to cook enough of this to feed him while she’s gone.  He will 
eat it every day of the week. 
 
00:50:00 C:  That’s the Caribbean boy in him. L agrees.

Section 6 of 15 [00:50:00 - 01:00:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
 
00:50:00  Christine summarizes, boy gains from her care, even though he tells bad stories about her, 
they are still connected, no matter what.  Lorna is emotional.  It’s a mother’s love in a splintered family.  
They discuss how this family is fractured by divorce, and as a nanny Lorna is in the midst of that. 
 
00:51:01  Christine shares similar issues in working with a family that went through a divorce.  Hearing 
the news the parents were divorcing.  How families don’t bother to give nannies any notice that they are 
going on trips, various examples of this by C and L. How one parent will tell you what they other’s doing, 
where they are going. 
 
 00:53:00  Lorna describes finding out her employers were going to Italy, one day before she already 
needed to fly somewhere herself.  That she needed to stay to deal with a furniture delivery, while they 
all went on vacation. 
 
00:54:30  A doctor is concerned.  Seeing the changes in the boy she cares for is challenging. He goes to 
summer school.  She has meet with the boy’s psychologist.  They discussed the penis problems over the 
last two years.  She is seeing him regressing verbally in some ways.  Lorna’s family is becoming fearful 
for her getting attacked as he gets older, especially when she is living in, or asleep. 
 
00:57:54  Lorna explains that she doesn’t sleep. 
 
00:58:00  Christine points out this could be creating her nervousness that her doctor is concerned with.  
This is a high tension job. Lorna agrees.  They discuss why she stays when she could do other things, 
such as baking, cooking, sewing.  Lorna has interviewed elsewhere, but worries about who will take care 
of this boy.  Christine repeats that the wages are too low. 
 
00:59:30  Lorna says she stays for spiritual connection, because she has already told the mother that the

wages are too low, and has asked for a raise. Employer says when she gets a raise she will give Lorna 
one.

Section 7 of 15 [01:00:00 - 01:10:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
 
01:00:00   Lorna speaks to employer’s rabbi to try to track when she gets a promotion.  The rabbi has 
informed her that she has just gotten one.  She may talk to her employer soon.  Employer does not 
know she knows. 
 
01:01:00  Christine asks how Lorna is doing spiritually.  Christine describes the Christianity of women of 
color in the South.  Little has changed since slavery.  Black women nursing white babies.  Christianity can 
hold black women back. Lorna is not getting paid well.  Special needs teachers, driving, should get paid 
much more per hour.  A teacher who came in got paid much more. 
 
01:02:30  This woman did rehab at the park with this boy and got paid $45 per hour.  When employer 
forgot to leave a check for her, Lorna had to pull her money out of the bank to pay her.  She was repaid 
when woman returned but, without the ATM fees. 
 
01:04:00  Christine talks about the women gathering in church basements to talk about their work, in 
the book The Help.  Loving the children but being underpaid.  Discussion of keeping up boundaries and 
how this is harder with a disabled child.  How Lorna is the closest person to this child. 
 
01:05:08  How mother asks Lorna about boy’s behaviors, about his day.  Lorna has a spiritual 
connection.  It is hard to understand why she does not leave but this is why.  And this is a black women’s 
experience.  Even her son encouraged her to stay. 
 
01:06:30  How Lorna sees how the boy is different with his mother than he is with her there.  How he 
won’t go to sleep if Lorna is still there.  The job creates stability.  Her son understands she has a 
maternal bond with this boy. 
 
01:07:30  How this boy’s mother is always on the move and how he regresses without Lorna around.  He 
doesn’t take his eyes off Lorna when she is there.  Her son’s opinion of their bond and why the boy 
keeps his eyes on her.  It is a complex relationship. 
 
01:09:00  Lorna says the bond is deep and religion won’t let her leave but it is not even religion.  It’s 
more like a mother bond. Protective.  The last child may kill her though.  
 
01:10:00  Christine understands.

Section 8 of 15 [01:10:00 - 01:20:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
 
01:10:00  Lorna says the younger brother will be the last.  Tells story about going to doctor and doctor 
hearing her employer calling her asking where she was, presenting a problem of her own.  Doctor 
observes this dynamic is her problem.

01:11:30   They discuss how the child is not her problem as much as the mother’s not being present for 
the child, leaving Lorna to do it all.  How mother doesn’t have to work because father does but Lorna 
does everything, including taking children to the doctor.  She then takes herself to the doctor for ear 
problems and again he tells her, her problem is the way the mother is treating her, calling her about a 
personal problem while she’s at the doctor. 
 
01:14:00  Christine mentions “Trini lingo” that says it’s the young one that's killing mother.  It’s the 
autistic boy that’s the youngest one because he’s like a baby.  C and L and Chris (on camera) discuss 
what her son thinks about this.  L calls her son in the middle of the night.  He suggests she take a 
Benadryl. Lorna says it is more than insomnia and she doesn’t take Benadryl to make her sleep.  She 
would not want to get hooked.  Discussion of where to go next with interview questions.  L discusses 
boy’s medication.  He needs both medication and company otherwise he will not go to sleep. 
 
01:16:30  Christine asks about skills needed to be a domestic worker.  L says you have to be a mother, 
“with a natural skin.”  No book knowledge.  She writes “mother” as her job description, even on her 
passport.   
 
01:18:00 Christine asks what “training” is necessary.  L says you have to love, have patience, 
understanding, no training can teach this. You either have this or you don’t.  
 
01:19:30  Lorna says training could be learning to make a bed.  When children show their love for you as 
a nanny, some parents don’t like it. 
 
End of Section 8 of 15 [01:10:00 - 01:20:04] 
 
Section 9 of 15 [01:20:00 - 01:30:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
 
01:20:00  Lorna tells how she stayed home sick on a job and child told her she loved her upon her 
return, in front of her mother.  Child later told her her mother told her not to say “I love you” to Lorna.  
Little girl was five.  How children repeat. 
 
01:21:00  L says she did some housekeeping in the past.  You can be taught to do that.  She was taught 
to make a bed.  You could learn how to sew, how to cook, as a profession.  But no-one can teach you 
how to be a mother with love. C: not Dr. Spock, not in books, though they have been given books by 
parents, which predict what children will do at different stages. 
 
01:23:00  L says people ask her how she will speak to the children but an autistic boy needs her to shout 
at him so he stays out of danger.  He needs direction.  C asks if L still holds his hand. She asks him to walk 
either next to her or in back of her.  He understands, she thinks, but doesn’t follow orders. So she has to 
shout, “Stop!” 
 
 [01:24:30]  This is stressful.  L agrees, having to shout bothers her own ears. C asks about L’s specialties. 
L describes herself as kindhearted.  Generous, good cook, crafty. Stylish dresser.  Mother introduces her 
in front of others as a dressmaker and a stylist. Invites people to get Lorna to shop for them.  She 
dresses the mother when she goes out, helps her choose her clothing. C observes L dresses well.  L says 
she’s the best babysitter on the block.  Mother says people says she’s the best dressed babysitter.

01:27:32.  L says thank you. C points out she is not paid for this, or for cooking.  L cooks on their 
vacations to Hamptons house, cooks for barbecues.  
 
01:28:00  Discussion of how L gets children to eat, their eating habits. How shouting helps control fussy 
behavior, followed by apologies (to and from younger brother). With autistic boy she has to go to him 
and be forceful, not hurtful. 
 
01:30:00  Sometimes L has to hold him to control behavior.

Section 10 of 15     [01:30:00 - 01:40:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
 
01:30:00  Continued discussion of how to control autistic boy’s behavior.  Hold him, tell him to stop, tell 
him to watch me. Story about Lorna running late to pick boy up from school bus; he gets agitated 
because he can’t understand. Bus driver tells her he is agitated. Paces, shakes, bangs his head, continues 
agitated upon return home, passing doorman, getting into elevator, he’s angry. 
 
01:32:00  Lorna has to tell boy to stop it.  C points out that L could be doing other work. L comments 
that she did not have to do this kind of discipline with her own son at this age but has to do it for 
somebody else. 
 
01:32:30  How L enrolled her son at school and went back to Trinidad, simply warning him to behave, or 
else.  Gives the boy she cares for choices as well—do this or face this consequence.  Her son became a 
lawyer. 
 
1:34:30   C reflects that L has educated her son but still has to keep another house in order when she 
could otherwise have retired back to Trinidad.  They discuss L’s income. L gets no vacation or sick pay. 
Tells employer she has a bank account in Trinidad; doesn’t want people thinking she grew up in poverty.  
Did not come to the U.S. poor, came for other reasons. 
 
01:36:00  C likens L’s story to Camilla, Caribbean writer. C also had reasons to come to the U.S., to get 
involved in the arts. 
 
01:36:22  Children already coming to the U.S. since they were children, while some people never leave 
Brooklyn.  How documentation status is none of their business, not an excuse for bad treatment. C 
mentions plantation work and asks L again why does she not leave. 
 
01:37:30  L mentions she had an opportunity to become a paralegal or AMT (?) but employer found a 
way to create a conflict so she could not take the evening class. Prejudice around black people getting 
education. Lack of respect for her time. L reflects she should have left then. C asks what happens after L 
puts older boy on the bus.  She then walks younger boy to school, also picks him up in evening.  Very 
little break time for L. Option of locking older boy in the apartment to keep him from escaping.  She 
keeps the doorman informed when she has to pick up the younger boy.

01:40:00  L informs doorman about short errands she has to run. Younger boy gets out of school at 2:30.  
Too hard to bring older boy with her because of his behaviors.  Easier to leave him at home sometimes.  
She also needs 10 minute breaks. Sometimes older boy will remain on computer, other times he and his 
Mom sit on sofa while she preps dinner. Watches lesbian jokes on Youtube, his latest thing. C and L 
laugh. L finds this baffling but it does amuse people when he mentions this. C mentions her aunt with 
Alzheimer’s singing an entire hymn. 
 
01:44:00  L repeats how this behavior makes boy’s mother smile. 
 
01:44:14 C asks L about ever using home remedies. L uses Vicks, that is all. 
 
01:45:00  L gives mother Cera and salts for constipation. C has used some remedies that parents don’t 
like. She uses alcohol instead of cough drops for a sore throat (on herself).  Also brought store-bought 
alcohol cold remedies for the children to gargle, with salt added. Americans don’t like anything with a 
bitter taste. More discussion of constipation remedies. When remedy worked for the mother she was 
glad she was on a conference call and not in office.  
 
01:48:00 Remedy for eczema in children. Good foods for babies, Sago porridge and sweet yam.  No 
pacifiers.

Section 12 of 15 [01:50:00 - 02:00:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
 
01:50:00  More about Caribbeans not using pacifiers. Just let them get over it. Chris adds his son doesn’t 
like pacifiers at night either. L tells story about working for a very rich family, with a boy who would not 
sleep when they were on island vacations.  She made him sleep. She picked him up and took him to the 
beach. (?) Afterward he would sleep. 
 
01:52:20  Other skills L has taught her employer:  cooking and seasoning. Sharing marinades, bbq sauce, 
hot sauce. Employers tell her she “spoils” them.  She is tidy.  Best part of her job is working with the two 
boys.  L feels for the mother because she will have a baby for life, with no marriage or grandchildren 
from this boy, whereas Lorna can look forward to that. Best part of job is when mother is not present.  
 
01:56:00  Worst part of L’s job is not understanding autism and having to deal with it, no access to an 
expert to talk to. The mother is in some denial about it. Mother will not always communicate to L what’s 
going on with him. L tells emotional story about school inquiring about what behaviors they had noticed 
at home  She went to the boy’s school one time and talked to one of his teachers around the time of the 
ACS investigation. Very long arduous journey to get him to this school and to pick him up, while caring 
for a second child. Boy gets agitated.

02:00:00  Long journey to school story, continued. Stress of walking and taking trains between the boys’ 
two schools, one in Queens, the other in Manhattan, taking older boy with her especially with subway

train delays.  This went on for about four months before a bus started to come to pick the older boy up. 
02:01:00  C inquires what the school thought about her bringing the boy to school this way, instead of 
his mother doing it. The boy didn’t know the difference between L and his mother.  L had a special pass, 
if anything happened, so she could pick the boy up at the UN school. Boy did not fuss with this 
transition.  
 
02:02:30  L says she now has a good working relationship with her employer.  Talk about what to include 
or not include in covering this topic. C observes that finances cause stress with relationships with 
employers.  C provides her own example. Employers gave her a lot of freedom. What she got paid was 
low but employer gave bonuses.  Good relationship is in spite of low pay. Freedom to bring people over, 
she could cook for people, this made it good. Other jobs are not as friendly. Babysitters do the cooking. L 
thinks back on another job that was the best. Paid, plus travelling allowance, use of store credit for food, 
freedom to use it. 
 
02:07:00  L left that job because she didn’t want to live in.  Couple were heading toward divorce.  Then 
she found this job with autistic boy.  Discussion of strain related to finance conversations at present job.  
Only one $50 raise, nothing ever since. Arguments about weekend pay rates.  Misunderstandings about 
L’s documentation status. However, mother is not always there so that is good. 
 
02:09:30 C agrees that having employer working from home can be annoying. L point out her employer 
constantly texts her, even on day off.  More about financial stress.

02:10:00  Job stress sources, continued. As autistic boy gets older pay should increase otherwise L 
should leave. The sexuality issue is stressful. L worries someone may think badly of her related to his 
sexual behaviors, perhaps that babysitter molests him.  Humiliation of making public announcements. C 
asks if she has relationships with any previous children in her care—no.  Tried to visit, they had moved. 
Called to ask after them and father asked, what did she want? C still has a social relationship with her 
former employers.  How first child she worked with in this country at age 5 took her to dinner at age 23 
to tell her he was gay. 
 
02:12:47 Chris interrupts as battery is running low on video camera. C agrees to wind up the interview 
soon. They check the time. Debate about which questions have been covered already and which remain. 
Agreement to shorten the conversation.  
 
02:14:30  C reminds that L had to inform her employer that she was legal. Amount of hours and holiday 
schedule—were they respected?  L says no, explains. Lack of work/life balance. 
 
02:17:00  L admits she has no romantic life, no-one to go home to.  Perhaps this is why she stays. How 
she became part of Domestic Workers United—Joyce in park gave her literature.  She put it in stroller.  
Other babysitter (L was one of two at that time) gave it to her boss.  Boss asked her about it. She 
explained it was given to her in the park.  C reference house vs. field Negroes in slavery. L says she has 
informed her employer she comes from educated people.   
 
02:19:30 L’s brother who died was a teacher, a principal. Her son is an attorney. So she would ask in

confrontations if she needed an attorney. More conversation about how employer asked L what this 
flyer was about DWU.

Section 15 of 15 
[02:20:00 - 02:31:55] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
 
02:20:00  Continued discussion about how employer discovered DWU flyer. L decided to come to 
meetings.  What the DW Bill of Rights means to L.  Someone is now representing “us.”  Like a union, a 
“little weapon” that we could tell employers about. No more leave without pay, no more vacation 
without pay, reasonable working hours, overtime is needed.  How C asked for overtime and got it. Need 
for minimum wage to increase, for pay to vary because there are different types of domestic industry 
jobs. L refuses to clean now, or change bedsheets, without extra pay. Why DWU is important—DWU 
means people you can go to to let off anxiety, relieves isolation even if it’s once a month. Same body of 
people. People who live alone have nobody to talk to about their work.  Story sharing takes time. 
 
02:25:00  What should legislators know?  L says there are lots of people women of color and Latinos to 
work in their home and they're not treating them properly. Need to get workers out of the shadows, to 
treat them better, give them a fair wage. Skills L might wish to learn:  learn a new language for travel.  
Become an EMT (hasn’t given up this dream). Come in and you're hearing some of these women 
[02:27:00] saying the things they are going through in their jobs. You know that they have to take it 
because a lot of them have their children back home. Some of them don't even have their children here 
and had to leave their children. My one was all grown, but still, it doesn't matter how grown they still 
need in crisis their Mother in their life. 
 
02:27:30 DWU meetings as empowering.  You can feel less likely to be cheated.   
 
02:28:00] Last comments from L, what comments would she like to share with any listeners to this at 
the Library of Congress. 
 
02:28:30   L mentions “upliftment” that helped her realize that “you allow people to do you” but not out 
of lack of education or stupidity, out of love. Kindness mistaken for stupidity.  Love you got from your 
grandmother, many of us leave our countries with skills, some are nurses, some are firemen who take 
other work. Assumptions about people from other countries. We can teach people how to run their 
homes, how to live, how to raise their children.  Lack of respect—respect is what’s needed. Caribbeans 
must also teach their children in this country to show respect. 
 
02:30:30  [02:31:30] C thanks L for the interview.
