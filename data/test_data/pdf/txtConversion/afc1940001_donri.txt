Page 1. DON RILEY.And Riley was a friend of mine, a regular true blue.He lived in ? down near
fifth Avenue.Now he'd been single all his days and tired of bachelor's lifeSo he said to his brother
McBannon ?, ? take to myself a wife.So in the papers advertised for one that has the cashAnd there's
lots of old maids aroun' the blockAnd there's one that's worth the Mike ? So O'Riley went to bed that
night, he slept so very soundTo wake in the morn to find a dame that weighed 300 pounds.Now
what do ya want? said Riley, Riley was half asleep.She was winkin' and blinkin' at Riley, she wanted to
tickle his feet.Git out of my room, said Riley, or be ? to have your life.He'd forgot the day before he'd
advertised to get a wife.Now O'Riley set up straight in bed, was paralyzed with fearSaid , you have an
awful gall for you to come in here,But she being German, didn't understand a word he said,And she ?
her big 300 pounds right down on Riley's head.Stand out in the hallway 'til I put on me pants.The
big fat German answered, nein, and around him she did danceWell, it's nein be damn ?, said Riley,
all the pants he had was them.He tried to get his trousers on, she yanked 'em off again.Now what
do ya want? said Riley, Riley was half asleepShe was winkin' and blinkin' at Riley, she wanted to
tickle his feet.Get out of my room, said Riley, or be ? to have your life.He'd forgot the day before he'd
advertised to get a wife.That's all.[Sam Blackburn [md] Concord.?]
