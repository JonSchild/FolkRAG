THE moon shone brightly from above,

My only darling beau.

She's the joy of my life, 
And soon she'll be my wife, 
Then so happy both we will be. 
She's my own angel dove, 
My sweet treasure trove,

(Dance.) 
So wedded now we soon will be, 
Then, oh ! what joy serene, 
My darling having promised me, 
Life's burden to share between. 
The happy day will soon be nigh, 
The happiest of my life ; 
When first I 
call my darling one, 
My own sweet angel wife. 
She's the joy of my life, etc.

IN 
de evening by de moonlight, 
When dis darkey's work was over, 
We would gather round de fire 
Till de hoecake it was done ; 
Den we all would eat our suppers, 
After dat we'd clear de kitchen, 
Dat's de only time we had to spare 
To have a 
little fun. 
-Uncle Gabe would take de fiddle down 
Dat hung upon de wall, 
While de silver moon was shining clear and bright; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, 
Dey would sit all night and listen 
As we sang in de evening by de moonlight. 
CHORUS. 
In de evening by de moonlight, 
You could hear us darkeys singing, 
In de evening by de moonlight 
You could hear de banjo ringing; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, 
Dey would sit all night and listen 
As we sang in de evening by de moonlight. 
In de evening by de moonlight, 
When de watchdog would be sleeping 
In de corner by de fireplace, 
Beside de old armchair 
Where Aunt Chloe used to sit 
And tell de picaninnies stories, 
And de cabin would be filled 
With merry coons from far and near ; 
All dem happy times we used to have 
Will ne'er return again, 
Everyting was den so merry, gay and bright, 
And I 
never will forget it 
Just as long as I 
remember, 
How we sang in de evening by de moonlight. 
In de evening, etc.

On, my love stood under the walnut tree, 
Over the garden wall. 
She whispered and said she'd be true to me, 
Over the garden wall. 
She'd beautiful eyes and beautiful hair, 
She was not very tall, so she stood on a 
chaii 
And many a 
time I 
have kissed her there, 
Over the garden wall. 
CHORUS. 
Over the garden wall, 
The sweetest girl of all, 
There never was yet such eyes of jet, 
And you may bet I'll never forget 
The night our lips in kisses met, 
Over the garden wall. 
But her father stamp'd, and her father raved, 
Over the garden wall, 
And like an old madman he behaved, 
Over the garden wall. 
She made me a 
bouquet of roses red, 
But immediately I 
popped up my head, 
He gave me a 
bucket of water instead, 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc 
One day I 
jumped down oh the other side, 
Over the garden wall, 
And she bravely promised to be my bride, 
Over the garden wall. 
But she screamed in fright, " Here's father, quick! 
I 
have an impression he's bringing a 
stick ;" 
But I 
brought the impression of half a 
brick 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc. 
But where there's a 
will there's always a 
way, 
Over the garden wall. 
There's always a 
night as well as a 
day, 
Over the garden wall. 
We hadn't much money, but weddings are cheap, 
So while the old fellow was snoring asleep, 
With a 
lad and a 
ladder she managed to creep 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc.

BEAUTIFUL JESSIE, THE LASSIE I LOVE. 
Sung by T. B. Dixoic, San Francisco Minstrels. 
For sale at all the music stores. 
BEAUTIFUL Jessie, the lassie I 
love, 
She dwells in a 
cot on the banks of the Clyde, 
Her eyes are as bright as the stars far above, 
They beam into mine as I 
sit by her side; 
She smiles as I 
tell her I 
love her so true, 
As if unbelieving what already she knew. 
Go where I 
will her smile will impart 
A 
gladness, although she has stolen my heart. 
CHORIT8. 
Beautiful Jessie—beautiful Jessie— 
Her smile will a 
gladness ever impart. 
Beautiful Jessie, the lassie I 
love, 
I 
love her although she has stolen my heart. 
Beautiful Jessie, the lassie I 
love, 
I 
ne'er shall forget her wherever I 
go, 
We stray thro' the valleys, the meadows and dells, 
And tell o'er again the love tales that we know; 
Yet she tells me to wait, there is plenty of time, 
When I 
ask her to name the day when she'll be mine. 
The lassie I 
love I 
know loves me too. 
To beautiful Jessie I'll ever be true. 
Beautiful Jessie, etc.

HOP ALONG, PETER. 
Comic Song by FRANK DITAIONT. Sung by -WM. COUBTRIGET. 
OLD Uncle Peter got full last night, 
Looking out the window, saw a 
sight; 
This is the story he told me 
All about the animals he did see; 
Skunk on de wall, blowin' his nose, 
Toads in de grass, wore soldier's new clothes ; 
Ducks and gander, and de ole gray nag, 
Playing on de pianer, " Rally roun' de Flag." 
CHORUS. 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop alone, 
Hop along, Peter, whar you gwine, 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
Owl in de tree, winking and blinking, 
Cats in de pantry, catching mice ; 
Bugs in de attic, playing poker, 
Spider on a 
cobweb, throwin' dice ; 
Pigs rehearsing in de swill- tub, 
Ducks in de river, tellin' lies ; 
Bull-frog on de stump, grabbing ' skeeters, 
Bald-headed June bug coaxing flies. 
Hop along, Peter, eta. 
Grasshopper in de barn, singing soprano, 
Big bull- frog singing bass; 
Elephant on de wall, out serenadin', 
Little brown weasel wid a 
wart on his face; 
Coon up a 
tree, sayin' his prayers, 
Nigger eating railroad iron, up-stairs; 
Bally in de garden, lifting peas, 
Como and kiss me, if you please. 
Hop along, Pet.er, etc 
MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME, GoocLnight 
[Copyright, 1876, by ROBERT M. 
DEW ITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene. a 
wood. 
Enter PETE, an old darkey, with a 
stick and 
bundle over his shoulder. 
The music plays the first strains 
of "Old Kentucky Home.] 
PETE. 
IL long, long road I've trabbled; and I 
don't 
seem to get any nearer to my journey's end. 
I've been north, 
and east, and west; but I 
nebber could content myself. 
Dar's 
no place like de old plantation. 
How many happy days I've 
spent dar! Dar's where my old woman libed long years ago. 
Dar's where my children used to play 'round me, and where 
Massa and Misses used to be. 
Oh, de dear old home ! I 
wonder if dar's anyone livin' dar yet. 
No better home on de 
face of de earth. 
I've been gone many a 
year, but I've found 
no home. 
I'm trabbling on to rest dese old bones, under de 
shade of de trees, where I 
used to play when I 
was a 
boy. 
[Going.] 
[Enter M ASSA CHARLES.] 
CHARLES. — Well, as I 
live, if that isn't old Uncle Pete! He 
won't know me, of course. 
PETE. — I 
heard a 
voice somewhere, sure. 
CHARLES. — Don't you know me, Uncle Pete ? 
PETE. —No! No! I 
doesn't remember any body in these 
parts. 
I've been gone so long. 
CHARLES. — Why don't you know young Massa Charles, 
that you used to dance on your knee. 
PETE. — You Massa Charles? Well! well! Why I 
shouldn't 
have known you if I 
hadn't seen you! 
CHARLES. —[ Adieu.1 I 
wee the old man is a 
little confused 
in the upper story. 
—Well! well! Don't know your face; but I 
suppose 
you's Massa Charles. 
How's de old folks ? 
CHARLES. — All well, and flourishing; but the old home is 
ours no more. 
Do you remember the old home, Uncle Pete ? 
PETE.— Do 
I 
remember it? Ah, yes! 
CHARLES. — Do you remember that old song you used to sing 
about it? 
PETE. -- DO I remember it? Oh, how many a time I've 
sung it, as I've jigged along on de road, just to keep up dis 
old heart! 
CHARLES. — Sing it now, Uncle Pete, and it will gladden 
my heart to hear it. 
PL-
r.— Let me see, how was de tune.

On the meadow, the hill, and the shore, 
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon,

RUN FOR THE DOCTOR. 
Written and Composed by G. W. HUNT. 
Arranged by W. Six. 
The music of this Song is published by E. 
H. 
HARDING, 220 Bowery, 
New York. Price 10 cents. 
WrriEN I 
got married the wife she said, 
" 
Mamma will live with us." 
I 
felt a 
strong objection, 
But I 
feared to make a 
fuss ; 
And so " the old 'un" came—alas! 
I 
fear she'll never go, 
And the worst, oh! dear, she's always queer, 
For every day or so— 
CHORUS. 
It's run for the doctor, Charlie dear, 
Mother's taken awfully queer; 
Run for your life for Doctor Crup, 
If you fall down don't stop to get up 
Tell him she's got the old attack, 
Rheumatics up and down the back. 
Make haste, dear, or else I 
fear 
She'll never live till morning. 
My married life's a 
swindle, 
And my house a 
doctor's shop; 
There's nothing but bottles and nasty smells 
At my house from bottom to top. 
She's twenty bottles of tonic a 
week, 
She's always taking pills; 
The Doctor pays her visits, 
And I 
pay the Doctor's bills. 
Srou.E.N.—Nice, ain't it ? 
The old bore complains that 
her indigestion is bad; her poor dear mother died from 
compulsion, poor soul, and plumbago runs in the family, 
and every time an attack comes on my wife rings all the 
bells and shrieks through the house— 
It's run for the Doctor, etc. 
(1) 
rtUN FOR THE DOCTOR.—Concluded. 
She's always on the moan, and groans 
About the pain she feels; 
Complains of loss of appetite 
Directly after meals. 
She does her port, her drops of " short," 
Her chicken or lamb and peas, 
Whilst I'm reduced to mutton cold, 
And sometimes bread and cheese. 
21 
SPOKEN.—Nice, ain't it ? 
A stale crust and cheese in 
the kitchen; but just as I 
am getting interested in my 
sumptuous fare, my wife shrieks over the bannisters— 
It's run for the Doctor, etc. 
Since she's been in the house I've been 
A 
wretched bachelor quite; 
I 
only see my wife of a 
day, 
For she's with her ma all night. 
Sometimes I 
get asleep and dream 
I'm settled in Paradise, 
But the wife comes and turns me out, 
And the weather as cold as ice. 
SPORT:N.—Nice, ain't it ? 
Ten degreee below freezing, 
and I 
can't find my pantaloons. `• Never mind them," says 
my wife, " go as you are." " Go as I 
are, Maria I I 
dare 
not." 
At last I 
get to the Doctor's. 
He says, " Put her 
head in hot water, and apply a 
hot brick." I 
rush home 
and tell my wife. 
She screams; I 
bury my head under the 
bed-clothes, until once again I 
am turned out with— 
It's run for the Doctor, etc.

One brudder said de Lord delivered Daniel, 
One sister in de corner said yes he did, 
Anoder brudder said whar was Immanuel, 
Dat he wasn't- delivered up too. 
He was down by de water wicl brudder Moses 
Huntin' de chillen's ole closes, 
An' dis am de song he did sing.

An' I'll never turn back no mo', 
I'm a 
ridin' up in de chariot, 
It's so early in de morning, 
And I'll never turn back no me'.

THE GOSPEL RAFT. 
Written by FRANK DIJXONT. 
Dedicated to Mn. ARCHIE WEITs. 
PsE gwine to cross the river on de gospel raft, 
Like Noah in de good ole ark; 
Keep your candles all a-burning; keep dem burning all 
de time, 
Or you'll lose yourself and tumble in de dark. 
Get your baggage on de craft, don't forget to get your 
check ; 
You've got to pay your passage right to- day ; 
Be sure de money's good, for de captain's eye is sharp, 
You can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
C11011US. 
Hide away, hide away ; dar's no use trying to hide 
away; 
Get your baggage on de craft, 
Don't forget to have it checked, 
For you can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
Let me tell you about de army Mr. Pharaoh did command 
Vhen he followed ole Moses long ago ; 
They was drowned in de water wid their life preservers on, 
And de fishes had a 
jubilee below. 
Dar was Jonah was a 
fool and as stubborn as a 
mule; 
But de whale he made him quickly disappear ; 
Jonah den pulled out a 
razor and he cut de whale in half, 
And he floated to de shore upon his ear. 
Hide away, etc. 
Now, take warning, little children, don't you fool about 
de raft, 
For de opposition boat is running too; 
But she's liable to burst her boiler any time at all, 
And you niggers will be cooked into a 
stew. 
I'se got a 
private box and an opera glass to see 
You sinners trying to buzz in at de door ; 
But dey'll kick you down de stairs if you hasn't got de 
grace. 
If you come back dey'll slap you in de jaw. 
wide away, etc.

OPHELIA MURPHY'S BIRTHMARK. 
By M. S. BLACKLOCK. - 
The music of this Song is published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, 
New York. Price 10 cents. 
Mr friends, I 
have nearly gone crazy, 
I'm flatter tliati Brannigan's beer, 
All through a 
deceitful young daisy 
That lately walked off " on her ear." 
I'm shovelling smoke at the gas house, 
And board up in Avenue A, 
And there met Ophelia Murphy, 
A 
girl that lived over the way. 
CHORUS. 
She's the one only daughter of Paddy Murphee, 
Who was born in the town of Killbeg; 
She has curls red as carrots, a 
beak like a 
parrot's, 
And a 
strawberry mark on her leg. 
We went to each place of divarsion, 
To pic-nics, to weddings and wakes, 
And every night in the summer 
I'd treat her to ice-cream and cakes ; 
And when we'd return from our rambles, 
And find the old fogies in bed, 
We'd sit on the stoop there a- singing, 
"Swim out, for you're over your head." 
She's the only daughter, etc. 
At last came a 
cruel disaster, 
We went off one night very gay, 
To see the great Tony Booth Pastor 
As Bunthorne in Soolivan's play. 
Ophelia's eyes, how they sparkled, 
You'd think she was • crank'd " I'll engage, 
When an actor with hair like a 
woman's 
Came swaggering out on the stage. 
She's the one only daughter, etc. 
From that, sure, she raved of theatres, 
I 
think I 
got what I 
desarved, 
Each dollar I 
had in the bank, boys, 
Was spent on the seats called resarved 
In telling the rest of my story 
I 
feel like the softest of loons; 
Last week she ran off with 
A " supe" in the Patience Dragoons. 
CHORUS. 
When she went she left word that she'd joined the " Bake," 
But I 
fear she's turned out a 
bad egg. 
If it's crazy I'm going, my trouble's all owing 
To that strawberry mark on the leg.

New York. Price 10 cents. 
YOU'LL see a 
crowd of howling swells, wherever you do 
go, 
But let me warn you not to trust too much in outside show; 
For many a 
gent whose weekly pay to keep him scarce af-
fords, 
Would lia ,Te the girls believe that at Delmonico's he boards. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky, 
his conduct's very often sharp and tricky, 
He never lets you catch him, for he's always " fly ;" 
Ohl he's tricky, tricky, tricky. 
You'd think Fitzjames Adolphus Brown a 
howling swell 
enough, 
For up at Saratoga he shows no end of cuff, 
But if you saw his washing bill 'twould give your nerves 
a 
shock, 
For a 
pair of cuffs and " dickey " you'd find were all his 
stock, 
CHORUS. 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky, 
his linen is comprised of cuff and " dickey ;" 
lie never lets you catch him, for he's always " fly ;" 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky. 
He wears a 
lovely golden chain, which seems of value rare, 
Which, when he strolls about Broadway, he never fails to 
wear; 
But when he goes to Long Branch that chain is never seen, 
For the sea air turns its color to a 
very bilious green. 
SPOREN.—It looks an eighteen-carater----
But it's, etc. 
A 
little eyeglass in his eye he vainly tries to stick, 
And has to screw his features up before he does the trick; 
But if he falls against a 
stone a 
change comes o'er his phiz, 
For he has to take his eyeglass out to find out what it is. 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky, etc. 
He comes out strongly in the spring in fifteen-dollar suits, 
He wears a 
pair of gaiters, just to cover up his boots; 
The gaiters seem to serve a 
useful purpose, on the whole, 
For his boots consist of uppers, with a 
very little sole. 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky, etc.

W E'RE not surprised to see you stare, 
Upon our neat array 
Of dandy colored gentlemen 
Employed upon Broadway. 
We never lose our dignity, 
Though jingling plates of bash, 
We never co ld associate 
With common colored trash. 
CHORUS. 
We hear de gong a 
sounding, 
We hear the steward call ; 
Now all the figs are ready for a 
slide into the hall ! 
Oh ! flourish all de napkins 
Be sure to take your place, 
And skip around de tables wid aristocratic grace. 
Take this gemman's order, 
Bring a 
glass of water, 
Soup and fish on separate dish, 
The steward's in a 
flutter. 
Ali, here comes a 
stranger, a 
hay- seed and a 
granger, 
Slightly stoop, and spill the soup, 
And grease him wid de butter. 
(
Repeat.) 
Polite attention to the mall, 
That puts beneath his plate 
A 
dollar bill to make us prompt, 
Snch folks will never wait. 
We'll smother him in luxuries, 
And eagerly prepare 
To order ev'ry dainty dish 
Dat's on de bill of fare. 
We hear de gong, etc. 
In summer time we wend our way, 
To Saratoga Springs, 
And answer ev'ry bell and call, 
For money that it brings. 
Bat white folks have to wait on us 
In winter when we're grand, 
And travel like aristocrats, 
With a 
colored minstrel band. 
We hear de gong, ek.

Oa ! why was I 
so soon forgotten, 
When to me such fond vows were made, 
Like the rays of sunlight she did promise 
On me to cast love's only shade ; 
But, alas ! my sorrowed heart is weeping, 
In this dreary world I'm left alone, 
She who promised that she'd ne'er forget me, 
Now claims another as her own. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! why was I 
so soon forgotten, 
In anguish my poor heart aches with pain. 
Tho' she's gone from me, and now's another's, 
Still in heaven, mine she'll be again. 
Since childhood it has been my fortune, 
To always find my fondest hopes decay ; 
I 
ne'er met with any hope or treasure, 
But it would fade and pass away. 
Tho' twas hard to hear that she had wronged me, 
Still my lot in life I 
firmly knew, 
When ' twits told me I 
had been forgotten, 
I 
cried, she too, has been untrue. 
Oh ! why was I 
so soon forgotten, etc. 
THE LITTLE FLOWER YOU GAVE ME. 
Words and music by MAcr. 
Sung with great success by HAnny W . 
ROE, with the San FrancLsco 
Minstrels. 
I'VE been thinking, darling, thinking, of the days now 
past and gone, 
When I 
met you down beside the dear old mill, 
How you told me that you lov'd me and your heart was 
all my own. 
I'm thinking, darling, dreaming now of you, 
And in the shades of evening tears will fill mine eyes; 
I'm lonely, lov'd one, all my journey through, 
For the little flower you gave me it is all I've left to 
prize, 
I'm thinking, darling, dreaming now of you. 
CHORUS. 
I've been thinking, darling, thinking, 
I've been thinking of thee fond and true; 
And the little flower you gave me it is all I've left to 
prize, 
I'm thinking, darling, thinking, 
I 
am dreaming now of you. 
I've been thinking, darling, thinking, of our childhood's 
happy home, 
1\711,re the weeping willows hiss'd the running stream, 
And the memories of the old home ever linger with me 
now,— 
I'm thinking, darling, thinking now of you. 
Sweet angels guard my lov'd one I 
guard her evermore : 
We'll meet again beyond the jasper sea, 
For the memory of the past will come again a 
happy 
dream ; 
I 
think of you wherever I 
may go. 
I've been thinking, etc.

BURNS, 43 Fulton street, Pittsburgh, Pa. 
All Rights Reserved. 
DEAREST mother, I 
am dying, 
I 
am lying, 
With the pretty snowflakes flying 
Overhead. 
Now the full round moon is beaming, 
With light streaming, 
Poor wand'ring senses dreaming, 
Heart like lead. 
Yes, I 
love thee, dearest mother, 
But no other, 
'Cept my father, thee and brother, 
Ohl for life. 
Had I 
not braved the tempter's snaring 
With bold daring, 
Would I 
now be here despairing, 
Or his wife? 
Would thy poor sad heart be pleading, 
Or lie bleeding, 
At the outcast life Pin leading, 
Mother dear? 
Would my heart be sorrow-laden 
Roses fadin', 
I 
a 
poor deserted maiden, 
Lying here? 
God forgive me, dearest mother, 
Father, brother, 
There was once I 
loved another, 
But ' tis past. 
With my spirit bowed and kneeling, 
Crushed and reeling, 
Every fault of life revealing 
Poor outcast.

With your head on mamma's breast ;

Are sounds we dearly prize, 
With love we kiss the dimpled cheek 
Of Little Angel Eyes.

THE daisy soldier boys, the Hickory Rangers file away, 
A rare battalion of renown, who'd fight as tho' twere 
play ; 
Oh ! it's strained with admiration is the glance of ev'ry 
lass, 
When tramping by with 
elegant step, the Hickory 
Rangers pass. 
Boldly they tramp away without a 
fear, 
Scowling as though they wished a 
foe were near, 
On to the field they'd march away so wild, 
It's cannons they would love to bear, instead of the 
muskets mild. 
CHORUS. 
The daisy soldier boys, the Hickory Rangers file away, 
A 
rare battalion of renown who'd fight as tho' 'twere play ; 
Oh I 
it's strained with admiration, is the glance of ev'ry 
lass, 
When tramping by with 
elegant step, the 
Hickory 
Rangers pass. 
No lowly privates fill their ranks, they're Colonels Wry 
one, 
And never from a 
weaker foe would these grim Rangers 
run, 
Their feet of wondrous strength, and their great heads 
up-held so high, 
Awake a 
wild, encouraging shout, when the Hickory 
boys go by. 
Down from their picnic, thro' the streets at night, 
Pass all the warriors, bathed in calcium light, 
Bent low with prizes, grabb'd, and clutch'd, and won. 
Alive with home-made glory, solid Hickories ev'ry one. 
The daisy soldier boys, etc.

With its fragrance rare and sweet.

Its color so bright, ' tis wavy and light, 
Always bowing meekly to the ground;

And daylight claims its sway ;

Its jewels does display.

LONDON BRIDGE. 
Sung by the San Francisco Minstrels at their Opera House, Broadway 
and Twenty-ninth Street. 
PROUD and lowly, beggar and lord, 
Over the bridge they go; 
Rags and velvet, fetter and sword, 
Poverty, pomp and woe. 
Laughing, weeping, hurrying ever, 
Hour by hour they crowd along, 
While, below, the mighty river 
Sings them all a 
mocking song. 
CHORUS. 
Hurry along, sorrow and song, 
All is vanity 'neath the sun ; 
Velvet and rags, so the world wags, 
Until the river no more shall run. 
Dainty, painted, powdered and gay, 
Rolleth my lady by ; 
Rags-and- tatters, over the way, 
Carries a 
heart as high. 
Plow'rs and dreams from country meadows 
Dust and din through city skies, 
Old men creeping with their shadows, 
Children with their sunny eyes— 
Hurry along, sorrow and song, etc. 
Storm and sunshine, peace and strife, 
Over the bridge they go ; 
Floating on in the tide of life, 
Whither no man shall know. 
Who will miss them there to- morrow, 
Waifs that drift to the shade of sun ? 
Gone away with their songs and sorrow ; 
Only the river still flows on. 
Hurry along, sorrow and song, ete.

IN 
childhood's happy hours, many a 
happy day I 
spent, 
Down by the old mill stream ; 
When we used to go together I 
never shall forget, 
We would laugh and chat and dance upon the green. 
But them days have passed away, and my hair is turning 
gray, 
And it fills this darkey's heart so full of pain, 
When I 
think of my younger days, when I 
would stroll 
away, 
For to swing upon the old gate near the lane. 
CHORUS. 
But them days have passed and gone, and our hearts it 
is forlorn, 
For the good old (lays will never come again ; 
When we used to go together, and pass down by the 
lawn, 
For to swing upon the old gate near the lane. 
Well do we remember, when our daily work was done 
The songs old massa he would like, 
And he would play us lots of music, and we have such 
fun, 
For to see them all a- walking for that cake, 
But the cruel war broke out way down in the sunny 
South, 
And we had to leave the cotton fields and roam ; 
And then we bid good-bye, with tears in our eyes, 
To the old wooden gate that's near the lane. 
Bat them days, ete.

I 
REMEMBER one eve when you sat by my side, 
Your face then was handsome and fair; 
I 
asked you then, darling, if you'd be my bride, 
While I 
toyed with your bonnie brown hair; 
I 
saw the sweet answering look that you gave, 
With true love expressed in your eye; 
Your answer was low like the wind's gentle wave, 
But my heart scarcely needed reply. 
CHORUS. 
Your answer then, darling, was music to me, 
It came so enchanting and low; 
Your sweet whispered yes to my heart still replies, 
As it did on that eve long ago. 
Your sweet whispered yes to my heart still replies, 
As it did on that eve long ago. 
Our hearts are the same, tho' the years have gone by 
Great trials we both have passed through; 
Together we'll cling, and together we'll die, 
With our love never fading and true. 
We've lived thro' our pleasures, we've lived thro' our 
pain, 
For life has its ebb and its flow; 
We seem to be living those days o'er again, 
When we loved in the sweet long ago. 
Your answer then, darling, etc.

Can be sung to the Air, " My Dream of Life is o'er." 
How those moments gave me pleasure when you promised 
to be true, 
But time has flown, your love has turned astray; 
Still my heart is burning with the sweetest love for you, 
Tho' the roses of our life have passed away; 
But no more we'll fondly meet as we used to long ago, 
For you at last have turned away from me. 
Now those blinding tears flow down as they come welling 
forth with love, 
For that darling one I 
never more shall see. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love thy memory still, 
It is with pain I 
often think of thee, 
Still the music of thy voice seems to thrill me o'er with 
love, 
For that darling one I 
never more shall see. 
Tho' we've parted here forever, and it fills me o'er with 
pain, 
It often gives me joy when I 
conceal 
Those sweet mem'ries in my bosom where they have sweetly 
lain 
Ever since the time I 
thought them all so real, 
But I 
cannot trust thee now although I 
love thee still; 
Nor can I 
leave the lovely vision here, 
For within my aching breast you will find there sweetly 
lying, 
One poor heart that loves thee truly and sincere. 
I 
love thy memory still, etc.

MY BABY. 
As sang by CRARLEY BACKUS at the San Francisco Minstrels' Opera 
House. 
I'M the father of an infant 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
He won't let me rest an instant, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
He won't do a 
thing he's bid, 
How I 
wish that I 
was rid 
Of that awful sassy kid, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Of that awful sassy kid, 
Baby mine. 
At my meals I 
have to hold him, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
How I 
never dare to scold him, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
My face he'll surely scratch, 
And the table-cloth he'll snatch, 
All my crockery goes to smash, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
All my crockery goes to smash, 
Baby mine. 
He's a 
pimple on his nose, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
And we wash him with a 
hose, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
You'd ought to hear him roar, 
And I 
have to walk the floor, 
And I'd like to break his jaw, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Yes, I'd like to break his jaw, 
Baby mine. 
In my hair he often lingers, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
With molasses on his fingers, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
To hear him cry it is a 
sin, 
To quiet him we'll begin, 
Till at last we find a 
pin 
Sticking in baby mine, 
Till at last we find a 
pin, 
Baby mine.

BILLY'S MOTHER-IN-LAW. 
Written by PRANK DUMONT and sung by BILLY Bruen at the San Fran-
cisco Minstrels' Opera house. 
W ILL some one invent or tell of a 
plan 
To get rid of my mother-in-law— 
Some stuff that will kill her as dead as a 
nail— 
I 
won't stand her abuse any more. 
I'm covered with scars and with liniment too, 
And court-plaster's all over my jaw ; 
She'll douse me in a 
tub if I 
dare to resist, 
And she takes me to scrub up the floor. 
ClIORUS. 
She's a 
hunkey old mother- in-law— 
She's a " daisy " old mother-in-law ; 
She's the crankiest old " crow " that ever you saw, 
Is the buzzard that Billy calls mother-in-law. 
If home I 
return and the hour is late 
-Not a 
word of excuse she will hear, 
But gives me a 
sockdolager right in the eye, 
And bites off a 
chunk of my ear. 
I 
can't give her taffy, no matter how sweet ; 
Her hand's like the fighter, Jem Mace ; 
Whenever she hits me on top of my nose 
She spreads it all over my face. 
She's a 
hunkey old mother-in-law, etc. 
The house is as hot and as warm as a 
stove 
Whenever she's " bossing " around ; 
She gives me a 
wink, and I 
shut up at once, 
For I 
dare not to utter a 
sound. 
Bullets won't pierce this old crocodile's skin ; 
I'd rather be living in jail; 
I 
go around town like a 
big yellow dog 
With a 
tin kettle tied to his tail. 
She's a 
huukey old mother-in-law, etc.

You will miss me, darling Chloe, when I 
sleep beneath th€ 
sod, 
Where the summer winds are murm'ring o'er the lea ; 
You will think of me in kindness, as life's weary road you 
plod, 
When my spirit rests from pain and sorrow free; 
The sands of life are slowly ebbing, darling, with the tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle with the clay ; 
In the winter of your sorrow you will think of how I 
died, 
And you'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm laid away. 
CHORUS. 
For old uncle Tom is feeble, 
And his head is bending low ; 
Master calls, he can no longer stay— 
For his limbs are getting weary 
And his eyes are growing dim, 
• 
But you'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm Lid away I 
You will tell our little children that their father dwells 
above; 
How the angels led him up the golden stair, 
You will tell them how I 
lov'd them, with a 
fond and 
sacred love ; 
They must try to meet their poor old father there. 
And when the Judge his trumpet sounds from realms of 
bliss on high, 
And the morning of the great day comes at last, 
I 
will meet you, darling, Chloe, and together you --ad I, 
Will no longer dread December's wintry blast.

WHERE THE IVY GROWS SO GREEN. 
Written by WILLIAM C. 
DONAHUE, and sung by the DASHINGTGN 
BROTHERS. 
DOWN by a 
cool and shady streamlet, 
Where the water lilies grow so green, 
There dwells a 
lovely maiden 
In an ivy cot unseen; 
She was gathering the flowers in the wildwood, 
Down by a 
little .golden stream, 
Where both our hearts beat just as one, 
Where the ivy grows so green. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! darling Sue, this aching heart, (
Symph.) 
One more kiss before we part. 
(
S:qmph.) 
She was gathering the flowers in the wildwood: 
Down by a 
little golden stream, 
Where both our hearts spoke just as one, 
Where the ivy grows so green. 
(
Dance.) 
And at night when the little stars were sleeping, 
And the leaves were falling off the trees, 
We sat beside the brooklet, 
In the cool and shady breeze ; 
And when I 
asked her to be mine, 
Her pretty little eyes she tried to screen ; 
'Twas then I 
knew my fate was sealed, 
Where the ivy grows so green.

I

For he's travelling with a 
circus, an actor man to be. 
CHORUS. 
Our Patrick is an actor, he wears the finest clothes, 
The ladies all admire him, no matter where he goes ; 
With diamonds on his shirt- front, a 
lump the size of that, 
It's folly to deny it, a 
dandy is our Pat. 
'When he's home upon a 
visit, the neighbors far and near, 
Extend an invitation to have cigars and beer ; 
I'll cook corned beef and cabbage to have a 
lovely meal, 
But Patsy dosen't touch it, so dainty does he feel ; 
But he'll eat ice cream and peaches, blanc mange and 
custard pie, 
It's the style he learnt from actors, they're always living 
high ; 
But in spite of all his manners, a 
word for him we'll 
speak, 
He ne'er forgets his parents with money every week. 
Our Patrick is an actor, etc.

OLD TIMES ROCKS. 
Ant.—" Old Black Joe." 
OR, how I 
long for the comrades that are flown; 
Friends that I 
loved, and the dear ones all my own; 
Bent is dis form and all snow-white am dese locks, 
And still my heart is dreaming of dem old times rocks 
cuORUS. 
FIT1 sighing, yes, sighing, 
As de past around me flocks; 
My heart's forever thinking of dem old times rocks I 
Gone is my home ' way down in Tennessee ; 
There I 
was gay and happy as could be. 
Grief comes along and at my door it knocks, 
I 
never more shall see again dem old times rocks. 
I'm sighing, etc. 
Where is de stream by my little cabin door ? 
Where are de birds that I 
never hear no more ? 
New times hab come, but my grief dey only mocks, 
I'm weeping for do happy scenes of old times rocks. 
Ira sighing, etc. 
Once I 
was young, wid de banjo by my- side ; 
Now, I've no friend in dis weary world so wide; 
Tears sadly fall as sweet metdry's gate unlocks, 
It makes me young again to sing of old times rocks. ' 
I'm sighing, etc. 
Sweet were the days when we darkeys used to sing, 
Pen light and gay how we made the banjo ring ! 
Children dey danced as cunning as de fox, 
Ali, dem was just de good old times, dem old times rocks. 
I'm sighing, etc. 
Old friends are gone dat used to crreet me here, 
Old faces past that once to me were dear; 
Death's at de door, and berry soon he knocks; 
So, darkeys, let's hab de dance of old times rocks! 
I'm sighing, etc.
