GLASS PUT IN (To the tune of Days of Forty-Nine)Oh my [song?] is of a nice young man,Whose name
was Johnny Glass,He was a glazier by trade, and the stamps he madeAs through the back streets
he'd pass.He started in life with putty and knife,And a big pane of glass to begin,He was fat as a hub
and fond of his grub,And he hallooed out (hollered out, probably) "Glass put in!"He'd rise with the
arlk, and from daylight till darkHe'd trudge through wind and rain;By the light of the lamps, he'd
count his stamps,Next morning he'd be off again.'Twas joy to his soul, when he spied a holeOr a
window patched with tin,With his eyes rolled up he' [yelp?] like a pup:"Do you want any glass put
in?"At length he feel deep in love,But the fault was not all his own,He got shot through the heart with
Cupid's dartBy a little Dutch girl, half grown.With a huge large paw she broke his jaw,When his keg ins
half full of gin.As he rolled in the dirt, she cries: "Where's your hurt?"And his answer was "Glass put
in!"O he made her his Faru, but I can't tell you howThey passed the honeymoon.The prok was all hot
boiling in the pot,As he toddled home that noon.Years rolled by, three children did cry [md] Two boys
and a girl, what a sin.Oh they [crhistened?] the lass Miss Put In Glas,And the boys they called Glass
Put in.
What does it mean, [The'd?] count his stamps??" Money, obviously, but wwhy "stamps"??
