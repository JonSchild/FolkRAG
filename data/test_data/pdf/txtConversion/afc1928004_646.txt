7ritten, composed and sung by FRANK DEPRO. 
AIR :—".21T
rs. Brady's Daughter." 
MY 
name is Too— to, I'll sing to you, 
And try to amuse you for a 
while, 
The ladies know me, they adore me, 
Simply kase my name is Too—too Wilde. 
Now my brother, I 
have no other, 
He dresses up in the esthetic style, 
It's known here, and everywhere, 
• I'm a 
brother to the esthetic Oscar Wilde. 
Chorus. 
Pm a 
dandy, I'm a 
fairy, 
I'm a 
sunflower, I 
should smile, 
I'm a 
lily; I'm silly, 
I'm a 
brother to the esthetic Oscar Wilde, 
You'd think it very tough, if you got the bluff, 
Like my poor little brother Oscar Wilde, 
But he's got the gall, and can face you all, 
And that's what sets the Americans wild. 
He's making the lucre for little Oscar, 
These words he says with a 
smile: 
What a 
big snap I 
had in America, 
But I'm a 
brother to esthetic Oscar Wilde." 
I'm a 
dandy, etc.

STOP THE CAR GENTLY, 
THERE'S 
CORNS 
ON MY FEET. 
AN INSANE BALLA.D. 
-Written and sung by PRANK DEPRO, with Buckley 
and Morris' Minstrels. 
I'm crazy, I'm cranky, I'm insane, I'm wild, 
/ The cause of my troubles I'll relate, 
I'm crippled with corns and bunions, I 
am, 
Oh, sad, oh, sad is my fate. 
I've bunions that are married and settled
...4u — 
life, 
I've corns that grow an inch every day; 
When I 
get in a 
car, I 
receive such a 
jar, 
And to the conductor these words I 
say: 
Ch or us. 
Stop the car gently, there's corns on my feet, 
Conductor, this warning don't let me repeat. 
I 
gave you a 
nickle, now give ine a 
seat, 
Stop the car gently, there's corns on my 
feet. 
Can any one tell me what I 
must do 
To ease my feet from pain? - 
I've cut my corns off, and busted my bunions, 
But still they will grow there the same. 
When the weather is cloudy, I'm a 
Georgetown 
wretch; 
For my corns do a 
neat song and dance; 
When I'm out for a 
walk the boys loudly cry: 
He has corns from wearing tight pants. 
Stop the car, etc.

I'M JUST GOING DOWN TO THE SHOP, DEAR POP. -
A Parody on " I'm Going Down to the Gate." 
Written and Sung by FRANK DEPRO, with Great Success. 
My name is Sib Johnson Dewcarey, 
Pm a 
lady's-man just from Kelow, 
The neighbors say I'm a 
bit airy, 
Bnt how little, how little do they know. 
Last summer I 
shoved up my ulster, 
Unknown to my old " pop." 
So last night I 
did try to sneak out on the sly, 
And chase myself down to the hock. 
SPON:—Yes! 
But as I 
was coming down de steps, I 
ran 
flash, bang, into the de old man. Well, I 
never was so scared 
in all de days of my life. 
No, deed, I 
wasn't. 
Well, de old 
man yelled out: " You Sib, where are you going? " Well, 
you see I 
couldn't tell de old gemman a 
lie, so I 
answered him 
by saying— 
Choi-vs. 
I'm just going down to the shop, dear pop, 
Down where my coat is in hock, 
The weather's growing cold, it is on-my- sole, 
So I'll just sneak right down to the hock. 
I 
don't think you will, says my pop, 
And quickly took bolt of my ear, 
I 
yelled, I 
cried for him to stop, 
But he lively waltzed me up the stair. 
Your coat, young man, has vanished, 
And the ticket's tore up in the slop, 
My coat was new, but it cured me, ' tis true, 
And I 
never more went to the hock. 
Chorus. 
No I 
never more went to the shop, dear pop, 
That racket of mine you did stop, 
I've felt the cold blast as through the streets I've 
passed, 
But I 
never more shoved things in hock. 
HOTEL DE PARALYZE. 
BY FRANK DEPRO. 
Am:— Original. 
I'LL sing you a 
song, and 
try for to please you, 
So gather together, ye ignorant and wise, 
And before I'm through, no doubt you will laugh, 
At the sights I 
saw at the Hotel de Paralyze. 
I 
stopped there a 
week, and a 
long week it was, too, 
You could lay on your bed, read the stars in the skie=, 
Shure I 
blessed the night that I 
took flight, 
And skipped from that crib, the Hotel de Paralyze. 
There's a 
bald-headed idiot, by the name of Gus Gold-
beck, 
A gay lady's man, and a 
pet of them all, 
He writes such fine poetry, 'twould paralyze an ash- box, 
The boarders they call him the man with a 
gall; 
When he sit 
at the table, the gang they all guy him, 
Take it out on a 
shovel, be Heavens he draws flies, 
Then they all pour out slang only used by the gang 
Of bummers that board at the Hotel de Paralyze. 
The bed bugs they have there are old time dwellers, 
'Pon my soul they're the biggest that ever I 
saw, 
After working all day and retiring to rest, boys, 
They'd grab you and throw you about on the floor; 
There's the Washington gray- backs, be Heavens they're 
numerous, 
it a 
stranger once saw them ' twould open his eyes, 
When they take a 
bite they hang on all night, 
God help the poor guests at the Hotel de Paralyze. 
THE MERCHANT THAT PEDDLES TRIPE. 
Banjo Solo. 
By FRANK DEPRO. 
KIND friends, I'm here before you 
A sad tale to relate, 
About a 
girl that I 
once loved, 
But now she's give me the shake, 
Torun away with a 
merchant, 
In the market he peddles tripe, 
If ever I 
lay my hands on him 
I'll knock him as high as a 
kite! 
Chorus. 
Yes, I'll knock him as high as a 
kite, 
This rooster that looks like a 
snipe, 
My girl he took and me she shook, 
For this merchant that peddles tripe. 
[Repeat. 
Now don't you think it was tough, 
The way she treated me? 
To run away with this sardine, 
And to live in poverty. 
He is known as a 
drunkard, 
From morn till night he's tight, 
I'm hunting for this animal of hers, 
This merchant that peddles tripe. 
Chorus. 
Wouldn't I 
like to see him, 
Morning, eve or night? 
Revenge is sweet whene'er I 
meet 
This merchant that peddles tripe. 
JIMMY BRACETHEBAR. 
AN INSANE BALLAD. 
Written and sung by FRANK DEPRO. 
I'LL sing of a 
lad who wears a 
liver- pad, 
He's handsome as the bird we call the cow, 
He dresses like a 
gawk, picks his teeth with a 
fork, 
In a 
field all day he chases a 
plow. 
His mother has one lung, takes in washing by the ton, 
His brother's a 
regular la-de- dab, 
They say his breath is strong, on his nose he carries a 
corn. 
This esthetic monk, Jimmy Bracethebar. 
Chorus. 
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy Bracethebar, 
A masher—a 
masher, yes, you are, 
You have a 
strong breath, and can defend yourself, 
You esthetic bum, Jimmy Bracethebar. 
Last Sunday he went out, the boys began to shout, 
Catch on to the great country jay, 
He was dressed out of sight, poor Jimmy took the 
fright, 
And down the street he ran away. 
They called to him to stop, and loudly bellowed cop, 
But Jimmy bid them all tar- tar, 
He ran into a 
train, and never was seen again,' 
That settled poor Jimmy Bracethebar. 
Jimmy, Jimmy, et".

SUCH A HEAVY EATER IS MY MARY ANN. 
Written and sung by FRANK PEPRO. 
M Y 
Mary Ann's an eater, 
There's nothing on earth to beat her, 
She can paralyze a 
dish of beans and pork, 
When she sits down at the table, 
She crams in all she's able, 
And lively 'round the room the waiters walk. 
She's very fond of liver, 
Be heavens, ' twould make you shiver 
To see the way she slaughters eggs and ham, 
She can wrestle with a 
fish, 
It is her favorite dish, 
Such a 
heavy eater is my Mary Ann. 
Chorus. 
She's never full, she's always dull, 
She's clumsy and bungle as a 
ram; 
She makes a 
dash to grab the hash, 
Such a 
heavy eater is my Mary Ann. 
She's ugly, tall and lanky, 
The people say she's cranky, 
Her hair it is a 
beautiful carrot- red. 
The boys call her a 
buffer, 
A 
regular old " she- duffer," 
As 'round the street this animal of mine does tread. 
The color of her eyes is green, 
She's the worst you ever seen, 
Her feet spread open like a 
fan. 
Before retiring at night 
She must have her plate of tripe, 
Such a 
heavy eater is nay Mary Ann. 
She's never, etc.

SUFIRE SAL." 
(Banjo Solo.) 
Written by FRANK DEPRO. 
I ONCE 10V0d it 2
-al, 
Her name was Sutire Sal; 
Oh, I 
tell you she was a " charmer," 
But she gave me the " shake," 
For a 
man with a " stake," 
That called himself a 
farmer. 
He said he was rich, 
• And then did fetch 
A 
box of gold he told her; 
But when he was asleep, 
In the box she did peep, 
And found out he had sold her. 
She went to the room 
Of the newly- made groom, 
And pulled out a 
big razor; 
She jumped on the bed, 
And cut off his head, 
And ran away with an Italian glazier. 
But he was a 
sharp mouse, 
For he took her to his house, 
And of her he soon did tire; 
So he struck her on the head, 
And laid her out dead, 
That settled poor Sufire.

And hair upon her nose, 
Her form is like a

Dressed up in loose- fit clothes. 
Chorus. 
Shure, I'm not lying, 
Don't think I'm " guying," 
Paralyzing, demoralizing, 
Ugly Milly Brown. 
Feet like to rolls of butter 
Mashed on the ground; 
Voice like a 
steamboat whistle, 
Ears like a 
hound, 
Kill me or I'll laugh, " you bet," 
At ugly Millie Brown. 
Her hair is red as vermillion, 
Under her nose is a 
terrible " gash," 
She dresses up in style, " you bet," 
And she's always on the " mash." 
How hard she tries to catch a 
beau, 
But one can never be found; 
I'm afraid she'll die an " old maid,"

While sitting in church last Sunday eve,

With paint enough upon her face 
To ornament a

She's serving a

Ben Butler is my grandfather's uncle, 
Together they came over with Noah.

My grandfather fought in the last rebellion, 
He was hung, shot and put in jail for life; 
My wife's brother for six 
months ran the

He then took to his heart a

My sister married and settled down in business 
My wife then gave me the " dirty shake," 
So I

And here I 
am a 
living for to make.

See, they terrier is loose, get the net." 
Chorus. 
These " siders" of mine they call " &always," 
My plug- hat they say should be shot; 
Slug him one right under ther ear— 
Johnnie, see if the " conundrum " can trot. 
At last I 
arrived at Pat Grady's house, 
Arid, he Heavens, the rang were there; 
At me they did cry: " Pull down that vest! 
Wid a 
lyrick let's- part his hair." 
I 
looked at them in amazement, 
And for the front door I 
did skip; 
When I 
tripped on a 
mat, had luck, I 
went flat, 
And mashed me nose into me lip. 
Chorus. 
I 
tried to plow up the floor wid me nose, 
And how the blaggards did laugh; 
One says to the other: " Is the thing ' often out? 
Say the word, and Nvell gag the old calf." 
Pat Grady's party was a 
failure, 
Ther blaggnards wouldn't let- us have peace; 
W ii ther fighting and crying murder, 
They brought down on us the police. 
We were all locked up in the station, 
Not a 
single man did escape; 
But Grady got bail that kept us from jail, 
Or on the Island would've been our fate. 
Chorus. 
Pat Grady gives parties three times a 
year, 
Begob, ' tis an elegant sight; 
And the only fault I 
can find %yid it is, 
It's sure to wind up with a 
fight. 
THE FAR-FAMED GAS-HOUSE " MOSS." 
Ant:—" When the Marriage Bells are Ringing." 
Written by FRANK DEPRO. 
W HEN the gas house bells are ringing, 
It's then we start for the works; 
With our shabby genteel style, me boys, 
We look like ash-cart clerks; 
We're known by all, both short and tall, 
No matter where we go; 
When on the street, our friends we meet, 
Says how are yez, Depro—Depro—Depro? oh! 
When the gas-house bells stop ringing, 
It's then we strike hard licks, 
'Twould shake your soul to see us wrestle coal, 
The far-famed Gas-house Micks. 
Chorus. 
Oh, you suckers, don't you laugh at me, 
Come, my baby, skip the ' tra-la-le;" 
Oh, when the gas-house,hells are ringing, 
Our lunches we quickly fix, 
And away we go, in rain or snow, 
The far-famed Gas-house Micks.

When the gas-house bells are ringing, 
We're always on the spot; 
We kiss our family all 'round, 
And to our labor ' trot:" 
We're full of fun, disliked by none, 
No matter where we go; 
When on the street, our friends we meet, 
Says how are yez, Depro—Depro—Depro? oh! 
When the gas-house bells are ringing, 
They commence every morn at six; 
With a 
light heart, to work we start, 
The far-famed Gas-house Micks.

HAVE YOU ANY GLASS TO PUT IN ? 
Written by FRANK DEPRO. 
-
WALKING the streets all day long, 
With my glass box on my back, 
Looking for broken window panes, 
Or larger ones that are cracked, 
Windows pasted with paper I 
see, 
Some with rags and tin; 
You'll hear me cry as I 
pass by: 
"Have you any glass to put in?" 
The boys on the corner they guy me 
Every time I 
go past, 
They want to know if that thing's alive, 
Or how long will it last. 
The leader of this murderous gang, 
His name is Terence McFlynn; 
-A brick they will shy, when they hear me cry, 
"Have you any glass to put in?" 
I 
have a 
boy about twelve years old, 
If I 
thought he went with that mob, 
I'd break every bone in his body; 
Their parents no doubt they rob. 
My Johnny, I 
know, is a 
good boy, 
He never drinks beer or gin, 
When he hears my yell, my voice he knows 
well: 
"Have you any glass to put in?"

YOUNG SAM SLUSH. 
BANJO SOLO. 
By FRANK DEPRO. 
Y OUNG Sam Slush is a 
first-class sport, 
And I 
want you all to know 
He's mashed on a 
gal named cross-eyed Sal, 
Who lives in Poverty Row. 
Now cross-eyed Sal is a 
mighty fine dame, 
And her size is six foot two, 
She's dead in love with young Sam Slush, 
And she sticks to him like glue. 
He calls to see her every Sunday night, 
At the mansion in Poverty Row; 
She dresses in style with a 
heavy pull-back, 
Looped up at the side with a 
bow; 
Her complexion is the color of liver, 
And her feet cover up ground, 
Her father is book-keeper for an ash-cart, 
And her equal cannot be found. 
He took her one night to the opera house, 
Just for a 
little treat, 
N'Ghen a 
man in front got up to go out, 
And he stepped on her big feet; 
She struck bim right under the ear, 
And laid him out for dead, 
Turninc, around she grabbed Slush by the arm, 
And lively for the door did tread. 
Young Sam Slush thought it was time for biz, 
And he asked her to be his wife, . 
She smiled and nmrmured like a 
hig kangaroo, 
Saying: " Cnlly, I'm yours for life." 
They soon were married and settled down, 
And what I've told you is so, 
They peddle clams in the market-house, 
And reside at Poverty Row. 
APPETITE PETE. 
Original banjo Solo, by FRANK DEMO. 
I'LL sing, to you of a 
hungry man, 
He's known as Appetite Pete; 
He's always looking down—hearted; 
'Kase he c•an't get enough to eat. 
He hangs around the market-house, 
And boards at " bummer's retreat," 
He was never known to have his " fill," 
This man called Appetite Pete. 
Last week he went in a 
dining saloon, 
And called for an oyster fry; 
He ate about twelve dozen 
Before you could blink your eye. 
He then bawled out for " eight dozen more," 
The proprietor thought he was a " beat," 
And grabbed him—fired him through the door, 
This man called Appetite Pete. 
One day he strolled in the market—house, 
Ten watermelons he did eat, 
And yelled out at the top of his voice: 
"Just charge it to Appetite Pete." 
But the huckster wasn't that kind of a 
man, 
And annihilated him complete; 
He was carried home in sections, 
That wound up Appetite Pete. 
PAUL 'KEEN.

Sung by JoHNNY-

I'LL sing of a 
ham, who indeed is a 
ham, 
For he calls himself an actor; 
lie's a 
regular old bum, he ought to be hung, 
In a 
play he can't take a 
character. 
He's giddy and shy, with an ash -
box eye, 
And tries to play the part of a 
fiend; 
But now I 
confess, he has whiskers on his breat.E,7'

This would-be actor, Paul Keen. 
Chorus. 
His name is Paul Keen, 
The worst ever seen, 
lie's mashed on a 
queen 
By the name of Pauline; 
But Pauline says he's mean 
And cranky and lean, 
A :.) lood-cu id linp- 
fiend, 
This actor Paul Keen. 
He once took a 
part, it nearly broke my heart, 
In " Wild Mike," the Hebrew Robber, 
He had moss on his nose, patches on his clothes, 
Made up for the part of a 
lover. 
He rushed on the stage in a 
terrible rage, 
" 
Safe—safe, my queen!" 
He was hit with a 
brick, six weeks he was sick, 
This would-be actor, Paul Keen.

MY

Only to hear her laugh, 
Only to hear her ; igh, 
Only to hear her titter 
Whenever I

Only to see her again, 
Only to see her cat, 
Only to see her dance, 
With her tiny little feet. 
With the Capitol Star Combination, 
This girl away did run,

Led my darling off for fun;

And nearly turned her brain,

Wid a

Her form would knock you cold,

My girl is known everywhere, 
She has! she has red hair. 
Last Sunday I 
called on my Mary, 
All dressed up to mash, 
Her father bid me enter, 
And fired me through the sash. 
As I 
landed on the pavement, 
My Mary stood there so ,true, 
Says she: " Frank, I'll be home Monday," 
My reply was: " I 
will, too." Oh! 
She has! she has, etc.

Just for a

To make cakes on de table fade; 
Jim bit him a 
whack, chased him home in a 
hack 
From de Blackberries' Masquerade. 
Big, fat Lize was much disguised; 
For she had washed her face. 
A

Left us all in de shade; 
For he fell ker-flop in a

A BROKEN DOWN SWELL. 
By FRANK DEPRO. 
AIR:—" Isle de Blackwell." 
COME gather, ye outcasts, 
And rounders as well, 
And list to the words 
Of a 
broken-down swell, 
Who once had money 
And friends by the score, 
But now they have shook me, 
I'm wretched and poor. 
Chorus. 
No money, no friends, 
The old saying is true, 
With plenty of money 
How they'll stick by you; 
But let cash be all gone, 
And in want you have fell, 
You're booked as a " beat " 
And a 
broken—down swell. 
My garments were imported, 
My dress it was gay, 
I 
associated with nothing 
But the elite of the day, 
In a 
brown—stone front, 
Like a 
prince I 
did dwell, 
Never once giving a 
thought 
To a 
broken—down swell. 
No money, etc. 
A BROKEN DOWN SWELL. 
(Continued.) 
You may talk about horses, 
But I 
had the " boss " pair, 
While out at the races, 
How the bon- tons would stare, 
To see me dricin g— 
The team known so well, 
Ani handled with grace 
By this broken-down swell. 
No money, etc. 
While frollicking and " spreeing," 
I 
didn't mind the cost, 
My father's large fortune 
I 
squandered and lost. 
The sheriff took possession, 
Everything he did sell, 
And kicked me in the street 
As a 
broken down swell. 
No money, etc. 
To look for my friends, 
I 
tried hard to do, 
But when asking a 
favor, 
Your friends they are few, 
They passed and repassed me, 
Sorry am I 
to tell, 
None seemed to recognize 
The broken-down swell. 
No money; etc. 
MADIGAN'S BRIGADE. 
Words by FRANK DE RR°. Music by M. SCHIATZE. 
I'LL never forget the day, you bet, 
Us Madigan boys turned out, 
I 
tell you we looked fine, all in a 
line, 
How the people did holler and shout, 
To see our brigade, out on a 
parade, 
With a 
full brass band at our head, 
On horses wete police, to keep the peace 
As down the street we tread. 
Chorus. 
Tom Madigan has command, 
On his horse he looks grand, 
For style we leave all others in the shade, 
We know the use of a 
gun, 
In a 
fight we never run, 
We're the boys of the Madigan Btigade. 
fr he band did play, as we march away, 
With our muskets polished bright, 
Us Irishmen true, for the .red, white and blue, 
Any minute in the day would fight; 
Our green flag on high, floating through the 
sky, 
The color that will never fade— 
Hurrah—hurrah! greets us on the way, 
While marching in Madigan's Brigade. 
Tom Madigan, etc.

BIG BLACK ESTELLA IN OUR CELLAR. 
END SONG. 
AIR:—" Sandy-haired Mary in, Our Area." 
Writter and Sung by FRANK DEPRO. 
I'm mashed on a 
lump of fatness, 
Her name is Estella Fresh, 
She weighs about four hundred pounds, 
Ohl heavens, what a 
chunk Of flesh. 
She says she loves me dearly; 
But I 
believe she's giving me gum, 
She sings like a 
bird we call the cow, 
In the opera of One Lung. 
Chorus. 
She's a 
burn, she's a 
vag, 
She's running. without a 
tag. 
She's a 
crusher, she can paralyze a 
fellow, 
She's a !-ruy, she's so fly, 
She can slan;yhter custard pie, 
Big Black Estella in our cellar. 
I 
proposed to Black Estella, 
And asked her to be mine, 
Says she, Lufonzo, I'm too young, 
So please to bear in in 
She told me she was sixteen, 
Her b'.rthday comes in May, 
But I'll take my oath she's forty, 
And old enough to chew hay. 
I 
Look Estella last evening, 
Down the river on a 
pleasant trip, 
Take her di! take her off! the captain roared, 
Or you'll surely sink the ship. 
Estella got a 
pitching and rearing, 
Like a 
warrior brave and bohli, 
But the last I 
saw Estella, 
They were chasing her in a 
coal-hole. 
WHEN I 
GIVE UP THE STAGE. 
Written by FRANK DEPRO. 
Sung by BILLY 
W ELLS. - 
W HILE walking out last Sunday night, 
I 
got mixed with the gang, 
We strolled up to Godfrey's 
And four hours there did hang; 
Indeed we had a 
jolly time 
Each other trying to guy, 
When I 
was asked a 
question 
And this was my reply: 
SPOKEN.—Yes, the question was, when would I 
give up the stager 
Says I, gentlemen, when I 
give up the stage it will be— 
When Ed Harrigan ' tends table in a 
dining-f 
oom, 
When Tony Hart to buy bread pawns his coat, 
When Gus Williams takes a 
trip to the moon, 
When George Knight never gives a 
good joke, 
When Bill Eckstein doubles up with Sam Devere, 
When Tony Pastor dances the Highland fling, 
When Jake Budd sits in the presidential chair, 
When Jake O'Neal ceases to sing, 
When Sam Cooper for a 
living peddles tripe, 
When E. Maas drives an ash-cart, 
When Billy Kirkwood carries the banner all night, 
When love strikes John Robinson's heart, 
When the Capital Theater, at Washington, 
Edwin Booth will engage, 
When this occurs, and not till then ; 
Will I 
give up the stage. •

THE FAMILY NEXT DOOR TO ME. 
AN INSANE BALLAD. 
A Parody on " Over the Garden Wall." 
Written and sung by FRANK DEPRO. 
I'VE a 
subject now I'll sing to you, 
Of a 
family next door to me, 
When I 
look out the window on me they throw 
glue, 
This family next door to me. 
They bang on the wall, ' till I 
think it will fall, 
All hours in the night for police they do bawl, 
A 
murdering gang with a 
terrible gall, 
The Family Next Door to Me. 
Chorus. 
The family next door to me, • 
I 
wish they were out at sea, 
They sing Starry Banner, and plank the pianner, 
With -voices soprano, in a 
horrible manner, 
They can down Dr. Tanner; they feed on guano, 
The family next door to me. 
They give a 
dance every night, 
The family next door to me, 
Their dances wind up with a 
fight, 
This family next door to me. 
They stand by the door, and sing " Pinafore," 
If you open your month they'll mash your jaw, 
It's the hardest crowd that ever I 
saw, 
This family next door to me. 
The family next door, etc.

And a 
pet with all the girls where'er I

They laugh and wink their eye, when'er I

And say, now isn't he fly? 
There was once a

piece entitled: " Tit for Tat." 
You see before ye Nat Hogan, 
Ye can tell me by me face, 
For three years I've served faithful 
As a " cop" on the Metropolitan Polace. 
I'm known by almost every one, 
.As on my beat I 
pace, 
And always treated wid respect, 
Nat Hogan, the Gentleman Polace. 
Chorus. 
I'm on the right side of the captain, 
And that alone shows his good taste. 
For the force would go to wreck without 
Nat Hogan, the Gentleman Polace. 
The other evening while out on my beat, 
Fire! Fire! I 
heard some one cry, 
Nat Hogan was off like a 
flash, 
Over the pavements be heavens I 
did fly. 
Save my child, a 
poor mother was crying, 
With a 
dash I 
ran up the stair-case, 
And soon returned wid the infant, 
Nat Hogan, the Gentleman, Polace. 
I'm on the right side, etc.

I 
WILL sing of a 
gal, Cranky Annie is her name, 
She's pigeon-toed, cross-eyed and she's fat, 
On her nose there's a

Wid a 
foot like a 
worn—out door- mat. 
Chorus. 
She's the ugliest in all creation, 
Cranky Annie, paralyzed one, 
Cranky Annie, ugly creature, 
Oh! she's gentle as an untamed elephant. 
When you're in her company for a 
little while, 
She'd politely ask the loan of a 
dollar William, 
Then she'll bid you good—day, and lightly trip 
away, 
To a 
hash- house there to eat her 611. 
Chorus. 
She's the ugliest in all creation,

MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. 
Written by FRANK DEPRO. 
I've a 
mother-in-law 
With a 
terrible jaw, 
I 
wish—I 
wish she was dead; 
She says I 
need chin 
To keep in trim, 
And a 
crack now and then on the head. 
She has her own way, 
She don't mind what I 
say, 
She roams 'round the house like a 
cat, 
She has, a 
fine face, 
On a 
hog ' twould disgrace, 
Like an elephant she's ugly and fat. 
She's as tough as a 
mule, 
In her hands I'm a 
tool, 
She makes me do work 'round the house. 
If I 
happen to complain, 
She walks on my brain, 
She don't allow me to open my mouth. 
When I 
get my week's pay, 
Fork it over, she does say, 
And I 
bet you she gets it all, too. 
But when I 
iefuse 
How roughly I'm used, 
When she leaves me I'm all black and blue. 
'Twas last Saturday night 
That I 
came home tight, 
A map on my face she did claw. 
She used me for a 
broom 
And swept up the room, 
This " monster," my mother-in-law. 
Now there's my own wife, 
She's afraid of her life, 
To interfere in my behalf she'd not dare. 
l'm in a 
sad state, 
Oh, pity my fate, 
Left in a 
mother-in-law's care.

MY BROTHER'S WIFE. 
AIR :—.111cSwegan from Mayo. 
Written by FRANK DEPRO. 
SHURE! '
tis nothing but bother, 
For married is me brother, 
To the girl of his choice, 
In her left ear she's lame. 
Her feet cover land, 
Spread out like a 
fan, 
She's from " County Clare," 
And McElf is her name. 
Chorus. 
She has a 
nose like a 
Turk, 
She'd rather die than work, 
She sits in the parlor 
Singing tral-lal-le-lo. 
If I 
had my way, 
I'd send her astray, 
For me brother is wild, 
And knows not what to do. 
While she plays the pianer, 
She has a 
nigger to fan her, 
And flirts wid duffers 
That happen to pass by. 
She says she is pretty, 
And also witty, 
But the sight of her mug 
Would make a 
slop-bucket cry. 
When she opens her mouth, 
Shure! I 
lave the house, 
For I 
tell ye her breath 
Would fay you out flat. 
She has an arm made of tin, 
Begad she can chin, 
'Twas a 
bad day for me brother, 
When he married the wild- cat.
