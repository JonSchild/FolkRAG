Dearest Lomax—Exes,  l
i
awse., ).nse1li, and Gordonsi
 
Greetings all, and this omnibus report of the festivities at We11
,tlset
 
which we all wished for you all. Alan and Toni , in time, can g
ive you a
. report from their
 
p
oint of '
view, but this i
s how it all began for us.
 
From
 s
hington, we made several attempts to reach Alon g with no
 
answer to the telephone • S
o, on S
aturday, August  19, after an intensive three d
ays of
 
sight-seeing and touristing to a
ll the familiar spots, we ran to catch a train from
 
e
t to Phiadelphia for anouther round there, with dinner at Bookbinder'$(yeerued for
 
Susan at that l
ovely p
lace where l
obsters swimming in melted butter were abounding). S
oe
 
again, we tried to reach Alan by phone...no snawer,so on we went to New York, deciding
 
that it was j
ust our unhappy luck to arrive there after he had decamped for the summer*
 
S
ince you are all familiar with the Lomax no tipping policy, you will know that we were
 
al ways heavily laden with luggage on this j
ourney, the only omission from this trip was
 
the Australian c
amouflage bag which customarily accompanies us on vacation trips • (
iili
 
the family rallied around a pile of luggage, I ran to wake one last call to Alan before
 
we loaded into a taxi and beaded for the Taft hotel where we had reservations • Anne anewer d,
 
and imediately urged us to come on to the apartment on West third, saying she bad gotten
 
ready for us, hoped we were doming, and almost given up hope • Alan b
ad called from s
ome
 
place upstate that be would be in later that evening, and both of them were expecting the
 
entire family to s
tay with the*. So, in we piled to the first upcoming taxi , who turned
 
into 6th avenue and circled the Waverly Theater so many times Johnny claimed they changed
 
the bill while we were looking for Alan's address. Finally, tile driver gave up, admitted
 
that be had just driven in with a fare from Long Island, didu t know the Village,
 
and suggested that we get out and walk. •
 .
ve accepted the challenge, and s
taggered halt
 
a block up t
he street , then up the stairs to Alan s apartment were w
e were j
oyously met
 
by Anne and her harlequin poodle, Blueberry •
 
After the cultural t
our of e
ducational buidif
lgs and national
 
shrines we had mapped out for Washington and Philadelphia, the boys wero ready for a
 
change of p.o. • Anne had thoughtfully provided toot for all, and after a few minor skir-
m
ished over w
ho would and who wouldr* 4t take a bath, we set out for Ti me  qu
sr* '
rim
 
subway on Saturday night • W
€ walked up and down, ga *iug with the rest of the crowd at
 
all the lights, *ni w
ated signs, and I bad a gay time re-living my years in New York, co
 
p
aring now and then(sinco
 1940 when I l
ived there, and our l
ot visit, when Bess and Butch
 
were warrtid). We also qencelled our reservation at the . f
t where I bad a hil a
rious ex-
parienee with a would-be 1et h
Arto who thought I was lonely in the big city
, because I
 was
 
s
eated on a couch waiting for various members of th. party to re-sceemble and who faded
 
away in a hurry when Jo h
o, Johnny, Joey and Anne  o t
h.d ma • kek to the partment by mid
 
night, we found only Blueberry waiting to greet us, so the wale members of the party
 
decamped into the first of A
lan's two big rooms, l
eaving the second room for Anne , Blue
 
and we to share the bed • T
he apar nent is located over a restaurant which features folk
 
s
ingers and modern j
azz on Saturday and Sunday nights • I
 have no idea who they were, but
 
c
an testify they attacked their entertainment assignments with vigor. Anne and I talked and
 
g
i :led like boarding school freshnent until about Z AX when there was a temporar
'' lull.
 
The e
cho of steps on
 r
ot floor hes*ld o
t 4Jsn1s return to the fold, woke Blt
.  who
 
began to bark, and in he came, announcing a
l m
ost simultaneously tba
.tb. Be had rented a
 
four-bedroom house in Welltl et over the phone, (2. He had proposed to Toni *rcha M
 
who had accepted him( . He was leaving t a next d
ay for Wel i
fleet and 4
 • We must come to
 
d
ellfleet to the wedding which was scheduled for 8aturds,y
, Augut 26.
 
Next day, we spent helping Anne and Alma pack up ard d,prt for
 
l
Ifleet ,  finally g
ot them loaded about 5
: 0, then began a b
rier s
ight-s
eeing trip t
o
 
the Museum of Modern A
rt, the Gug enheim, and then to celebrate John's birthday with
 
dinner at a posh restaurant. The boys were not admitted witout coats, but the nexøgement
 
2.
 
t
ores.einc the hicks-from-the sticks season was at 1
un
'iA had l
aid in a supply of j
ackets
 
for just such emergencies • They were of grey c
otton, similar to those worn by barbers,
 
and a funnier lc
oktr,
,g trio you'll never se
e. Joey a was much too larg, Johnny 5 wes too
 
short in the the arms, and John's didn't fit him ar
aywber.* When t
hey tiled out of the cloak
 
room to rejoin as in the dining room, I laughed s
o hard that even imperturbably Vapty was
 
a little embsraesed, particularly sine. I had urged all of them to t
ake jackets before we
 
l
oft the house, reminding them that jeans and rolled s
leeves were not coi n
s i
i taut on
 
upper Park and Lexington. 4
,** *
With oonnivanoe to the bead waiter who seemed to enjoy the
 
contretemps as much as the other guests, Johnny was surprised with a birthday c
andle serv e
d
 
in a
. large s
lice of o
aks '
placed before him with a waiter who served it w
ith flourishes
 
usually reserved for crepes sujst t
e. Then, on to Ce
ntral P.rk for a walk to the Hayd e
n
 
P
lanetarium and a thrilling lecture-demonstration on '
) n in Space'.
 
On W
ednesday, we rented a red Nash Bamble* and set out for W
elifleet, equipped with
 
a sack 1ncb wads, up from all the perishable items left in Alan's refrigerator. Forta t.ly,
 
however, we were forced t
o wake one stop in 0omieaticut, so we supplemented our rations for
 
the r
oad as soon as Big Jo)m disappeared into the genteln
en s room.
 
F
ound the beach cottage where A
lan, Anne, B
lueberry and Victor Orauer, Alan's
 
muaicolo r assistant were ensoonsoed, working on Alan's project with grant from Rockefeller.
 
)I must digress here to m
ay that A
lan has devised a code and 57 checkpoints for waking a
 
profile of crossoulture patterns , ancient and modern which he believes will open up an
 
entire
 1pow field in antbropology
 perhaps also have a bearing on waking *
voice prints of
 
individ u
s

ossibilities in many
 
field, of s
ociology and cultural research. )
 
On Thursday morning, we began the preparations for the wedding b
y consulting in
 
r
e
 Wood, zefreehemente, rings, decorations, tableware, silver, etc • when we learned th
at
 
neither A
lan, n
or Toni, wanted to be married in the registry. Then, was some uneerteAnty
 
as to it
ho would c
ome tith Toni from Bu f
falo0 who would be invited from A
lan's friend
 
and I c
onfess, at that p
oint, how we could me w
ag* the wedding feast of turkey, baa, sweet
 
potatoes, salad, wedding cake, punch, ch
ampagne, salad , etco in a beach cottage, about
 
16 miles from a town of any s
ize  no telephone and a very Odd tlèor pl a
n • This four bedroom
 
house had tour tiny bedro o
mo upsta i
rs, all opening onto a minute hail into which the stair.
 
opened • The walls were far from soundproof, so th
at every trip t
o the bathroom downstairs
 
and across the end of the l
iving r
oom was a sound-track production audible to all. The b athrooa
 
do e
r had a double lock, very peculiar, installed backwards to that each time it was pllisd,
 
the visitor inside the roowy bath bad a feeling it light be his last sight of siviltztti

Alan and Anne were anxious that the wadding be prp and Alan was especially i

ottage, unless all the prepent inmates would be willing to l

w

o, off Anne and I went to grocery shop, making arrangements too,
 
for a wedding c
ake to be picked up on S
aturday at noon, and while we were at it
, we got
 
a turkey roasted, rented punch b
owl, cups, silver coffee urn, cups # sa u
cers, and began
 
p
lanning. Anne was absolutely e
cstatic over the preparations, proved t
o be a good sh
opper,
 
and an excellent p

Alan rushing us back to the cottage  with the announcement that we must all have on shoes,
 
all have on shirts, all have our hair combed and gneraul
 be on our best behavior • W
ith
 
that, h. w
.nd John got in the oar and disappeared for a quick swim. I was hurrying supper
 
so that we could all fulfill the requirements and present a charming picture of genteel ,
 
rayteened family in waiting to welcome the bride, when suddenly ,I noticed that the supper
 
waam't cooking at the rate it had previously...,a quick cheek revealed .
..no gas at the
 
burner tip. So, out I dashed to the shed where cylinders were stored, tried to guess which
 
was full and which empty, and had just begun to read instructi ons
, when a piercing shriek
 
from Anne announced 'Here they comet Here's Tonii'. Sure, enough there was 
-a
. large station
 
wagon loaded to the hilt turning into our drive. Away we went to greet her, a
. cavalcade
 
from the rear joizjg those who had responded to the airm from the frovtk Emily Post doesn't
 
seem to cover such social emergencies as this, so we all
, just gr
abbed Toni and hugged her,
 
.
,
introduoing ourselves as we went s Her mother, father, and 13-year
 old brother had accompanied
 
er in their family station wagon, laden with food, flowers, cic*hes, luggage, and after
 
'
.the friet greetings were over, I hustled Mr. )rohand out the baók door to help change over
 
the gas cylinder, got Joey and Paul, Jr. acquainted; Johnny with his delightful savoir faire
 
took over Mrs • Ibrohand to chat, Toni and Anne discussed plans for the next day, Victor
 
wandered in and out looking hungry and helpful. We passed the firát hurdle with hilarity
 
when Mrs • )ö
.rchand said, 'Why are you 80 dressed up? '. They had arrived in shorts and
 
sneakers, and with I'm sure many misgivings about Toni '
s marriage to Alan • The ice was
 
not only broken, it was comepletely melted and we were all getting along swimmingly. They
 
had brought beautiful white gladiolas and pale pink ones, two big buckets full, and we bgan
 
to plan again about the wedding. Although we offered them food and drink as instructed by
 
Alan, they had eaten along the highway, but j
oined  us in a cup of coffee. After about an
 
hour and a half Alan and John came back, theyn the joyous re-unions and the introductions
 
began again.
 
I took to Toni immediately because she is warm and loving, appreciative, gay, smart,
 
energetic, and perceptive, In coloring, she reminds me of Pat, b
lack hair, pulled back
 
and caught at the nape of her neck like Pat wears her, lovely e
y4s, freckles, about my
 
height, maybe not quite so tall, a luscious figure, laughing o7sE, a lovely voice and
 
just the right note with every member of the ploygot crew ass nblèd • Alan beamed on
 
her, and immediately took her off ,  leaving us to get acquainted with her family. They
 
really are quite a smart bunch of cookies. Mr • ).rshand is French ,  descended from a
 
Paris family which for several generations has specialtaid in the exacting technique of
 
building displays for natural history and science museums. He b*s be n on staff of Buffalo
 
Museum, but is now free-lancing and has been called on to do displays for museums in Denver,
 
Cincinnati, Port Worth....11 over the coun.ry. He is a 1ev., easy going and fun • Mrs* Wrehand
 
is a beautiful woman with brown eyes, nice figur e,  gorgeous white hair, and an ardent Girl
 
Scout leader ,  just returned from a week's tour with a troop which stayed one week on a
 
boat at Mystic, Oonna for sea-training with her girl.. She was a ltttie reserved it f
irst,
 
but by the time we had gone through a few hours together, we were '
qocing in a team like
 
old b
1ing buddies • Paul, Jr • is a self reliant, smart, quiet tail boy and he and Joe y
 
hit if oft beautifully. He and Joey and Ann had & hilarious
 
e
. g, 
of hiding ransom
 
notes behind the garage • W
ell, to telesoope the next few hour.,' we al) bad such a good time
 
together, nobody wanted to leave to spend the night elsewhere, so l
ell eleven is us got bedded
 
down by midnight. Mr • Jkrohand in the station wagon, Paul, Jr • on an air mattress ,  Mrs.
 
Marchand on a folding oat. That sm
art gal had even brought sheets and 4tdding1
 
Saturday ,  after all eleven had been fed, Mrs )rc b
and and 1 decided on a c
oursc
 
of action. We cleared out all
, the furniture in the living room, coyered a heater with a
 
white pla tic tablecloth for an altar, covered the tire place with pine boughs, and the
 
younger set went to work hanging white we
dding bells, streamers, etc. Then, e" and her

beach to renew acquaintance with a pretty girl from Whit. Plains vaaatiordng there, and I
 
lit in to cook bar
n, peel sweet potatoes, etc • For reasons unbeknownst to me, Alan insisted
 
on having sweet potatoes as the accompaniment to turkey and baa, but I drew the line at
 
baked sweet potatoes for 21  W e two big casseroles with pineapple and lots of seasonings.
 
Mrs • Ibrahand ,  meanwhile, had most of the crew informed that no lunch would be served,
 
and she and Ane did te last minute shopping chores.
 
W

ottage • Anne,  (
re • *rchand and I with the aid of the men and boys c
leared
 
up the place and finally tell into bed. It was a bowling success from every point of view,
 
but mainly because every person present before during and after the c
eremony was so
 
adaptable, so helpful and so full of good will toward all assembled that it was one of those
 
miraculous occasions where strangers '
meet under strained circumstances and each rises to
 
meet the demands '
of a

 It was an intangible thing, not related th the refreshments which
 
really served -

a gracious gesture of hospitality a
 a

marred by only one thing l
acking*
 tMe presence of all of you. How m y times did I long
 
for all of you, knowing that each of you would have enjoyed it we much as we did, and
 
wishing we could share this happy time together as we have always shared the times of
 
'
trouble and sorrow.
 
Long though this letter is, I have mrerely scratched the surface, hampered
 
somewhat in the writing by the constant bulletins on Hurricane Carla which have been
 
coming in by T7 and radio since Saturday
 we now have no electricity, but except for
 
a yard full of l
imbs, we have had no' da
ge. W
e had candles handy, cooked everything in
 
the refrigerator, and have been in a state of watching and waiting for two days.
 
Deanie ,  about the same, except that she is gradual y losing '
w
eight. I got
 
through to be  about Alan's wedding in a
. lucid moment, and was gratified to bear her
 
say 'That's wonderful news. I wish I could have been there!' This is the most she has
 
said in a
. long time. Usually just responds to questions. S
ome days are  bad,
 some worse,
 
but we are fortunate in the wonderful colored girls we have been able to keep; so ms
.ny
 
families in a similar situation have a constant turn-over of girls who s
imply c
annot
 
s
tand the nerve s
train of oaring for a patient of this type. W
e are blessed, too, in
 
that although Dearite often screams, she is not aware she is screaming, ad although
 
she is i
u o
ortable, I do not believe she i
s m any pain.
 
P
lease let us bear from all of you. W
e had a wonderful note from Hod with a
 
copy of a ungeatne telling us more about Houston s highways than I knew, letters

Dearest Alan, Bess, and Shirley(please note diplomatic alphabetical order)
 
Word from Alan and Bess almost simultaneously announcing a move into larger quar-
ters for both families  brings up the question of the Lomax furniture now inresidence
 
at the Houston branch. You will remember I wrote to all at the time the Ausust re-union
 
was being planned explaining that I did not expect to get Ofirst  pickings'as John had
 
so elegantly expressed it and that we would keep the furniture here until such time as
 
it was needed by whatever family member s
o announced •  The time is now.
 
During the mad Dallas days, Alan J. took one double bed, two s
ingle beds, one dressing
 
table, one chest of drawers, Deanie's desk, both living room chairs and both rugs. We
 
have the dinding table, buffet and six chairs which belonged to your mother, one bird&&eye
 
maple dresser, one old oak dresser with mirror, and a bedroom suite which Deanie bought
 
.
..two s
ingle beds, a dressing table ,  a chest of drawers,a night stand, and a small
 
table with folding leaves. Also ,  three heavy oak chairs and one oak rocker from your
 
father's offlce(I think), p
lum miscellaneous dishes and cooking utensile....pictw'es
 
three small lamps, and of course,the s
ilver given to Deanie foe wedding presents. I
 
do not have just handy the list of objects willed, but I think I remember a specific
 
bequest of the s
ilver and the samovar to me....otherwiae I do not recall that I would
 
be entitled to
 
3
 
any of these other things if it came to a hair splitting decision.
 
Y
ou know the house and you '
,Mow us and the way we live, s
o I think you'll all agr
 ,
 
that whether the furniture comes or goes is not going to throw anybody into a decline. Ilk
 
.
.... 
and to put it very bluntly, I love you deeply, each an
very one, and I value your
 
loving concern for me which began before I married John and -
-been seasoned and strengthened
 
through the years we've shared sorrows, sickness, and set-backs, as well as mutual ad-
miration, professional advancement, and personal triumph.  I do not want to endanger
 
this feeling with any kind of shadow(auch as the one which has hung over Uncle Richard '
a
 
and Aunt }%ttie's heads and extended to their children). So, what I propose is this.
 
If each of you will write what you need and what you would like to have and when you
 
would l
ike to have it, I will undertake to find out by what method it can be shipped
 
safely and as inexpensively as possible. My preliminary investigations seem to indicate
 
that moving vans cost less than crating and freighting, which also entails pick a$1
 
moving at the destination, but there may be some factors I've overlooked. In caIó all
 
three want the same things, what then? Draw for it, I say. .
..or does somebodrbave a
 
better method? In the past two years we've moved everything in the house at least once,
 
to say nothing of dismantling the Dallas house and the Clarksville house, so the idea of
 
shifting furniture around doesn't bother we in the least. (It does bothe
Lbnpty, who can
 
never understand the strange logic of moving furniture when the i
dea occu e. at midnight,
 
s
a
y
,
)
-
All this sounds very formal,  I know, but I
'm determined to get this on paper
 
before we all get engulfed in the Christmas confusion. Since I began the letter I've
 
had two interruptions( just two that counted) one, to attend the funeral of a friend,
 
aged 24 who died of a cerebral hemorrhage just three months after her wedding and the
 
second an attempt to help Lightnin' Hopkins find out about getting back his bond money

So, Alan and Anne, how about the Christmas visit to Houston'
? Bess and Butch, what
 
i
s the latest report on life and times in a motel while entertaining a Thrnkksgiving
 
v
isitor? Uhat is the moving-in date...still Dec. 15! David is a young man who would like
 
to be engaged to Susan, but I do not believe she is ready to be engaged just yet. Shirley,
 
what one hundred c
rises have befallen you at Horn Hall in te past 24 hours? Haven't seen
 
Susan s
ince she got back to Houston from Lubbock holidays,  but I hear tell there's a
 
'
eoprise
 that might ferment unless handled carefully.
 
P
lease, somebody say something soon.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
 
Enclosed are eight copies of a standard gift conveyance instru-
ment that you and your family may use in transferring the additions
 
to the John A. Lomax, Sr., Papers to the University.
 If each member
 
of the family would execute the instrument in duplicate and return
 
the copies to me, the University Librarian will finalize the execution
 
on behalf of the Board of Regents here in Austin at once.  Thereafter
 
your personal copy will be returned to you, Mr. Alan Lomax will re-
ceive his in New York, and so on.
 
Arrangements have been made for the additional materials to
 
be appraised next week.
 In view of the labor Day holiday, it is
 
possible that the appraiser may be delayed into the following week.
 
In any event, however, formal appraisal reports should be sent to
 
each member of the family by the appraiser by mid-September.
 
In this connection, Mr. Lomax, at your convenience, would you
 
send me the current addresses that should be used by the appraiser?
 
We discussed the subject during your last visit here in the Archives
 
but decided to postpone the matter after I had listed the first name.
 
Your copies of the conveyance instrument and the appraiser's
 
report, plus copies of a family partition agreement (in which, of
 
course, the University would not be involved), should be all you
 
need for income tax deduction purposes.
 
With regard to the John A. Lomax Room in the new building, I have
 
had no further reports from Mr. Folmer concerning the progress of con-
struction.
 I suspect that the rains have had a temporary effect, but
 
this should be only temporary in nature.
 
Again, Mr. Lomax, please accept my best wishes and expressions
 
of appreciation.
 
Sincerely,
 
Chester V. Kiel
 
University Archivist

Dear D
1
iirley, Bess and Alan:
 
(
I)  This letter covers the donation of a box of Lomax zi
iscellaneous
 
i
i
ape s to the Univeristy of Texas Archives.
 These are principally letters
 
between JAL and RTL and have sat in our attic since 1962, running the risk
 
of destruction byx±ixJr fire or storm.
 Alan has never argeed to the desirabi l
ity
 
of placement of these papers with the remainder of them in the Archives, feeling
 
that one of us might possibly want first call on them for use in a biography,
 
e
tc., of J A L
, but that eventua l
ity now seems unlikely to me.
 I sent the
 
box of papers to the Archives on the written understanding that no one save
 
one of we 4
, or designees, could have access to these newly deposited papers
 
for 5
 more years, to 1974.
 
From my 1
5 hours spent this March riffling
 
through the voluminous Lomax papers placed in the Archives in l94 ,
 and
 
catalogued, it made me realize that any worthy and definitive biography would
 
require a long s
tudy of a
ll the Lomax papers (
not just those I had).
 The
 
box I had and sent to Austin constitute no isolated subject but are a necessary
 
element e
ssential to be dove-tailed into the rest of the papers in the Archives
 
to complete th er scope.
 
You will note from the enclosures the 2 forms you should sign and return
 
promptly to me in order to finalize this act of donation.
 In Dr. Kielman's
 
l
etter you'll note the impend i
ng  .
ppraisal of these papers , b
%f
ever is the value
 
put on them, each of us can use p4th thereof as a Charitable Deduction on his
 
1
969 Income T
ax Return (
which should be welcome to all).
 
(
II)  During his Xmas visit Alan made the *
iice suggestion that I should c
arry
 
the ball in the establishment of a John A
. Lomax Room at U
. of T
.
 I broached
 
this ideas to Dr. Kieln
ian in March, which he readily endorsed and recommended
 
to Dr. Fred Foi
r, Head Librarian.
 Rapidly, space was a
llocated in the new
 
History complex under construction east of the Stadium.
 I
'm told the Lomax Aoow
 
i
s to be well located on the first floor, next to the Oral History Room.
 I
t i
s
 
agreed that the Lomax Room would be handsomely appointed as to furniture p
ind
 
have available modern equipment for records' and/or tapes' replay by pans of
 
e
ar-phones, e
tc.
 On hand would be all the Library of Congress records and
 
tapes from Lomax collection efforts, plus a
ll other records, tapes and books
 
any of us have produced.
 Doubtless, we will be asked to provide the source
 
(
or donate )
 such material for acquisition by UT.
 
No doubt the JAL Portrait would be moved into this room from its spue
 
what s
eclud e
d ha l
l-way location
Building.
 Probably, each of us
 
would furnish an git  X l0
 �
&�ip  
,
TFather's.
 I envision  such a Room
 
would be an interesting and wa r
n show-piece at U T and also one that would
-be
 
u
sed and enjoyed by many a student.
 Also, it burns be that Dobie, Webb and
 
Bedichek are now commonly agreed to be the triumverate of great UT writers and
 
father little recognized as such, even tho he was their equal and trail-blazer;
 
the Room would conterbalanc-
6 this incorrect situation and would focus on his
 
accomplishment as a writer and collector.
 
I decided I wished to consummate the establishment of such a Room by
 
doanation of a s
um of money this year.
 I told Dr. Kielman I felt sure each of
 
you would with to be a full participant in this project by a donation.
 I
 
suggest $100.00 each, or more, if you're inclined (
for mine is greater).
 Such
 
donation would be tax deductible.
 Issue checks to U
. T
. and send to me soon
 
so I c
an wrap up the matter and submit the checks together.
 
The Building is s
cheduled for mid-1970 completion.
 
I
'd l
ike your reactions to these 2 situation3 and criticisns.
 
I
 uch love to my ,
'ine fami  ly,

 have examined t

collection o

etters and r

The collection consists o
f approximately 1

910-1948, on personal matters and
 
on t

The collection has, i

etail value o

I

That I

of Texas, being of sound mind and disposing memory, do hereby make,
 
declare and publish this as my Last Uill and Testament, hereby re-
yoking any and all other `
;
Tills heretofore by me made.
 
I.
 
I direct that all my just debts be paid as s
oon as
 
practical after my death.
 
I give, devise, and bequeath to my four children, Shirley,
 
John Jr., Alan and Bess Brown, all of my estate both real, personal
 
and mixed of which I may die possessed, with the following provisos
 
and exceptions to wit:
 
1
.
 As soon as reasonably possible after my death fifty
 
per cent (
5 0%) of my estate remaining after paying my just debts
 
shall be divided equally among my aforementioned children, Shirley,
 
John, Alan and Bess Brown, or their heirs or assigns.
 (This fifty
 
per cent, as I understand the law, in reality is the estate of their
 
deceased mother, Bess Baumann Brown Lomax, with whom I had an under-
standing that in the case of the death of either the estate should
 
remain intact until the death of the survivor.)
 
2
.  In  making this division of the property my present wife,
 
Mrs. Ruby Terrill Lomax, is to remain the beneficiary of a full fifty
 
per cent (
5O )
 of the estate, including at her option the home at 7
4 6
 
can Benito '
,,
l
ay, Dallas, Texas, until her death, and to her is to be
 
paid by the Republic National Bank of Dallas, Texas, all the income of
 
the property allotted to her in the division of my estate.
 
3
.  To my wife, Mrs. Ruby Terrill Lomax, I give and bequeath
 
my full interest in the book, Our Singing Country published by the
 
i
iacl
'4i11an Company, New York;
 and to her I also give and bequeath all
 
the royalties of any subsequent books I may write.
 
4
 Upon the death of my wife, Mrs. Ruby Terrill Lomax, the
 
fifty per cent of my estate held in trust for her benefit as to income,
 
as provided in paragraph 2 of Section II herein, shall be divided
 
equally among my four children, Shirley, John ilan and Bess Prawn, or
 
their heirs or assi gns0
 
I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint the Rep0513
-c  h
ttioas
 
Bank of Dallas, Texas as Independent Executor of this my Last  ll1 and
 
Testament and direct that no bond be required of the Republic National
 
Bank of Dallas, T e x a s ,
 
as such Executor and that no other action be had
 
in the Court having jurisdiction over my estate other than the probatia
 
of this my Last U l
li and Testament, and the filing of an In'a atosy

To the Republic Bank:
 
During my service as secretary of the ex-students Association
 
of the University of Texas, I was the principal agent, together with
 
Dr. H. Y. Benedict, in investing these funds:
 
QS,000.00
 Pete Edmond Scholarship
 
ç5,OOO.00
 Bothwell Kane Scholarship
 
These investments suffered during the depression, to what
 
extent I am not informed.
 I hereby direct and instruct the Republic
 
Bank of Dallas, Texas to take from my estate, at the earliest moment
 
possible, consistent with providing adequate support to my wife,
 
Mrs. Ruby Terrill Lomax, and to pay in to the ex-students association
 
sufficient funds from my estate to restore the principal sums of the
 
two scholarships referred to above to the amount of  5
,OOO OO each.

Dear hr0 hacBean:
 
In case of my death at any time I want my wife, 1
'rs0 huby
 
Terrill Lomax, to receive, direct, without any accounting, all the
 
income from my book royalties and sales of book rights, during her
 
lifetime with no rights to transfer them.
 This would be in addi-
tion to the income from my property during her lifetime.
 After her
 
death the book royalties, etc., will be turned over to my four
 
children.

 July 6
,  1971
 
This serves to catch up w mewhat on family affairs.
 In our
 
separ.te busy lives I fear we're drifting apart, and it behooves us
 
to give the  time and effort for more letters and get-togethers so
 
needed to maintain our affection and interest in each other.
 
I enclose the good story in the I
4er1dian Times on the June 13th
 
Dedication al at the site of th  Historical Marker for father's boyhood
 
home in Bosque County.
 Also enclosed is the copy on the marker.
 The
 
occasion came off nicely though my remarks and songs during my speech
 
were often drowned by the traffic noise from the hiway immediately
 
adjacent to the Site.
 Our good cousin, J. T. Lona x drove us on 2 xx
 
long sightseeing trips around the beautiful County spiced with good
 
talk of family history and anec dotes.
 His father Addie is now 94
 
and Mother, minnie 92, both kicking and have been married 66 years 1
 
En route to Meridian Iimi and I spent a busy l  hours with Drs.
 
Chester Kielman, Archivist and Fred Folmar, Librarian of the U. of Texms
 
in the brand new Library-History complex.
 We deferred a visit to the
 
gaudy LBJ Building adjacent to the Bid Richardson Bldg.  (
on the hill
 
east of the old campus) which houses the John A. Lomax Study, whose
 
west picture window views both the East Mall and the principal edifices
 
of the sprawling, huge university.
 The Study is beginning to develop
 
into a warm and useful memorial.
 Father's Portrait hangs of
i the end
 
wall of the normal sized room above an appropriate antique-type roll-
type des 4ised many years by Librarian Winkler but actually similar to
 
one used by father for man
 
ea
n te old Main Building.
 The next
 
side wall is taken up by
 41,' 5pen book shelves.
 
Present planning is for the Study to be completed into a colorful,
 
living Memorial by such more or less permanent displays:
 
1)
 A plaque next to the Portrait listing father's achievements
 
and activities as a University administrator  and a summary of his
 
folk song accomplishments.
 
2)
 Displays in the book-shelves of colorful record jackets of
 
some of our commercial folk song issues.
 
3
)  Displays in the book-shelves of all of the Lomax books and
 
other publications (likely under glass to present pilferage).
 
) Card Catalogs cross-indexed listing
 
a)  All Lomax collected fDlk songs or other material avail-
able to be listened to on tapes filed in the nearby
 
Oral History RO ni facilities 
) xsax by scholars or just
 
interested parties.
 
b)  A summary t
hf the voluminous JAL and family manuscripts,
 
letters and other papers now housed nearby and avail-
able for research.
 
5
)  Comfortable desk space for students or visiting scholars
 
to use •
 o
u
s
 .
 
6)
 Color 8" X 10' phot p vwith name plates, to hang be'ow the
 
Portrait.
 For conformity I s
est a he d and shcu lders
 
I enclose recent correspondence with Dr. Kielman with his pertinent
 
run-down of the essential material and work needed for proper consumma-
tion of the project since each of you will be asked to cooperate for
 
i
-x
is part.
 I anticipate such requests will come to you directly from
 
Dr. Kielman;
 I continue to be busy in my business affairs, am not at
 
the scene, and he can best coordinate the Roo
 completion,
 you'll
 
note from the correspondence that l
ie's stated that you can be paid for
 
you submitted records, books,  etc. from funds already available, oI
,4iif,
 
you decide to donate such material)
 a*A it would be appraided to' '
yo
 
income Tax return.
 The only item not reimbursable to you, per my A
 
JAL page 2  7-6-71
 
understanding with Dr. Kielman, is the cost of your photo;
 this should
 
not be much since you could merely enlarge the negative of a good snap.
 
I
've put in a lot of time and thought on this matter, as you know,
 
but to put it over the top from here on in, your ideas and help are
 
necessary.
 Wh
. n asked by Dr. Kielman, I
'm counting on each of you
 
to do your part in a reasonable time.
 
As to the personal life of my tribe
 Both boys here now.
 
Joe just arrived with honors Diploma.
 He's been accepted by Interna-
tional Volunteer Students for 2 years of teaching of English in Algeria
 
in a secondary school--a formidable and challenging job.
 He goes to
 
Washington soon for indoctrination and has much to do before September
 
departure lining up just what materials for teaching aids to these Arabs.
 
John has found himself, occupied ple asantly in his chosen job in the
 
iesearch Dept. of the main City Library.
 He and Bidy are enjoying
 
much the small home recently bought about 1  miles from us.
 John
 
Nova is a ch arming ball of fire and a real winner.
 Mimi is just 10
 
days out of an 8 day diagnostic-treatment stay in the hospital.
 She
 
is much better and has sloughed her horrible cough.
 The diagnosis
 
thankfully eliminated any need for lung surgery (
previously thought
 
indicated) but detailed x-rays show a persistent infection from an ob-
scure-type virus.
 She is on a different anti-biotic medication, plus
 
voluminous daily liquid intake for an indefinite period.
 Shir1ey
 
tioLb m again living with Susan and Krishna in Galveston1 visited by
 
Lisa.
 Shirley has rented a house in central Colorado for about 18
 
days beginning the 10th to coincide with Susan's vacation;
 any or all
 
of us are invited to take our chances there.
 As for me, life is full
 
and coming up aces.
 Have just completed the annual check-up of my
 
neck area, all negative,  I
'm turned loose for 2 years, so it appears
 
l
ive licked the big C U
 I have a handball trophy for 1st place
 
in a 1971 tourney and was elected by the players the the Texas Handball
 
Hall of Fame.
 I
iimi and I have a gaudy vacation definitely planned in
 
September to Hawaii, coniderably paid for by building credits by Holston
 
Natural Gas and plan on a 2/3 day stop-over in Santa Monica  with Bess
 
if she'll take in the wayfarers.
 
Much love to you and famil

Dear John:
 
e also thorou hly enjoyed our June po•
.cro; in the Barker
 
History Center.
 .,here tne tine has sned t
o since, though, is
 
something else again.  Hopefully, there is sonething in the old
 
folksaying that the ran d pass ge of t
ine is a sign of good
 
mental health.  In any event, it was a joy to see you all again
 
and a delight t
o hear that the Bosoue dedication was a success.
 
ith particular reference to the Lomax Study, I will take
 
everal queries in order:
 
In.  Are out-of-pocket expenses of family members fundable?
 
Actually, since we have attempted to concentrate all new
 
purcha es in Section B of my Juiie memo to Kr. Folmer, there
 
really should be no expenses other than those that the
 
University will cover in routine fashion from the Lomax
 
Fund.  This does not, of course, extend t
o the family
 
photographs for the wall opposite the JAL portrait.  This
 
is a subject that we began to discuss after our initial
 
conversation and I have never known exactly how to handle
 
the matter.
 
lb.  Eligibility for income tax deductions for gifts of records,
 
books, tapes, and so on?  Unless the IRS people go even
 
crazier in future than they have been in the past, there is
 
no reason why we cannot continue to treat gifts in kind as
 
we have in the past.  We can make arrangements for appraisals,
 
reports can be made to you by the appraiser, and you can
 
handle your tax business as you have been doing.
 
2
.  Overlap in  os. 3 and 4 in Section C of my June memo?  The
 
overlap is more apparent than real.  In No. 3 I am referring
 
t
o any pertinent documentation that you, Alan, and your
 
sisters may still own individually and wish to add to the
 
family collection individually.  In No. 4 I am referring to
 
our hopes eventually to secure records from persons outside
 
your immediate family.  Cousins, friends, and associates
 
quite often come up with copies of letters and other records
 
for which tnere are no carbons in a collection creator's
 
files.  We firmly intend eventually to try to tap these sources
 
for to Lomax Coijuction, and this is u
riat jo. 4 refers to.
 
T
iiis sort of activity toes on forever and ever in arc ivsl
 
Pro:;rams.  isistanco here from you, Alan, sn1 your sisters
 
will initially be in the form of Su'
e5tjOf
l .
 
3
 "Ba l lad
hunter" series?  You did give 2 discs of this series
 
in 1969.  The rest that you still have  wou
ld be most ap rosri—
 
ate additions to the collection at some t
ime in future.
 
I hope that the above helps a bit, John, in your approach to
 
the rest of the fmily.  If I am still being somewhat vague or
 
ambiguous, sound off snd get me back on the ball.
 
Again, it was l
ovely t
o be able to visit sith you and i
irs L.
 
earlier this month.

That I
, John
 Lornax, of the County of Dallas and State
 
of Texas, being of sound mind and disposing memory, do hereby make,
 
declare and publish this as my Last Will and Testament, hereby re-
yoking any and all other I
Tills heretofore by me made.
 
I.
 
I direct that all my just debts be paid as s
oon as
 
practical after my death.
 
II.
 
I give, devise, and bequeath to my four children, Shirley,
 
John Jr., Alan and Bess Brown, all of my estate both real, personal
 
and mixed of which I may die possessed, with the following provisos
 
and exceptions to wit:
 
1.
 As soon as reasonably possible after my death fifty
 
per cent (o%) of my estate remaining after paying my just debts
 
shall be divided equally among my aforementioned children, Shirley,
 
John, Alan and Bess Drown, or their heirs or assigns.
 (This fifty
 
per cent, as I understand the law, in reality is the estate of their
 
deceased mother, Bess Baumann Brown Lomax, with whom I had an under-
standing that in the case of the death of either the estate should
 
remain intact until the death of the survivor.)
 
2.  In  making this division of the prOpErty my present wif
l ,
 
Era. Ruby Terrill Lomax, is to remain the beneficiary of a full fifty
 
per cent (
5O ) of the estate, including at her option the home at 74 6
 
San Benito Way, Dallas, Texas, until her death, and to her is to be
 
paid by the Republic National Bank of Dallas, Texas, all the income of
 
the property allotted to her in the division of my estate.
 
3
.  To my wife, Mrs. Ruby Terrill Lomax, I give and bequeath
 
my full interest in the book, Our Singing Country published by the
 
MacMillan Company, New York;
 and to her I also give and bequeath all
 
the royalties of any subsequent books I may -arite.
 
4
 Upon the death of my wife, Mrs. Ruby Terrill Lomax, the
 
fifty per cent of my estate held in trust for her benefit as to income,
 
as provided in paragraph 2 of Section II herein, shall be divided
 
equally among my four children, Shirley, John  lan and Bess Lro n, or
 
heir heirs or assigns0
 
III.
 
I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint the Republic National
 
Bank of i
iallas, Texas as Indepcndent Executor of this my Last Will and
 
Testament and direct that no bond be required of the Repu..lic National
 
Bank of Dallas, Texas, as such Executor and that no other action be had

JOHN A. LOMAX JR. MEMORIAL SERVICE
 15 December 1974
 
AUTREY HOUSE, HOUSTON
 
Dear Friends;  We have gathered today to put our memories in
 
order and to take joy from the fact that John Lomax Jr., lived;
 
to celebrate the ways in which his life was a part of the root
 
and branch of our own.
 His family has chosen that the windows
 
here should be open to the traffic of a busy Houston street
 
and to rows of majestic live oaks, because John was so much
 
a part of all that was good and humane in the growth of the
 
city of Houston, and because he was wide-rooted, many-branched,
 
and evergreen as the oak; and we shall not, any of us, soon
 
forget the cool, broad shelter he made for us in life, and his
 
vigorous view of Texas origins.
 
John was not an antiquarian with a professional reverence for
 
the past; instead he had a wry appreciation of the way that
 
history makes itself felt in us; and he was a participant in
 
the history of our times who went after his part in it like
 
a man killing snakes.  John was a little long in the tooth for
 
active service in World War Two; but nothing could have kept
 
him out of uniform in what he felt was a war for human decency.
 
He rose,  in what was called the Muscle Buster program, to be
 
a Lieutenant in the Navy.
 He said once that his family had
 
strong genes, talking of his grandfather, James Avery Lomax,
 
who got sixteen children of two wives over a thirty-eight year
 
span, and of his grandmother, Susan Cooper Lomax, who bore
 
eleven children and raised ten more from various sources.
 
Paying tribute to the scholarly achievements of his father and
 
his brother Alan, Johb said of himself:
 "My bit is mainly to
 
sing our folk songs .
 .
 .
 my style is to sing them like they
 
were originally sung or collected .
 .
 .
 I alter all song
 
versions .
 .
 .
 to suit my style."
 
Born in Austin, June l
L, 1907.  As John might have said, if
 
he could have been patient for five more days, he would have
 
made it in for a holiday.  Raised in Austin for ten years and
 
taught by his mother, Bess Lomax, another remarkable woman,
 
who gave her children Latin to learn their ABC's by, John's
 
first experience of public school was to be admitted to the
 
seventh grade in Highland Park, Illinois, when the family
 
moved to Chicago.
 They came back to Austin and John went on
 
through the University of Texas and to the Harvard Business
 
School.
 He joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in
 
1932, and then moved on to a bank in Corpus Christi, and the
 
bank folded up around his ears.
 He's told me many times of
 
that last day when the doors were locked, and the depositors
 
were beating at the windows like bees drawn back to a ruined
 
hive.
 I think it gave him a permanent, physical sense of the
 
many ways that man's best efforts can be brought to nothing.
 
His own business career, after experience in numerous enter-
prises -
-
 he once managed a bowling palace -
-
 was a success.
 
Many of us knew him as a sportsman and exemplar of the
 
healthy body with the sound mind.
 
John Lomax was quietly determined, and we all know the force
 
of his quiet determination, that folksongs and the often
 
nameless, mostly exploited, always enduring human beings who
 
made them, should have justice in the tally of folklore, if
 
nowhere else.  He was the most influential figure in the
 
founding of the Houston Folklore Society.
 In it, he was
 
Father and elder brother to us all.
 I want to read a couple
 
of things he wrote, to remind us all how he could look back
 
to misery and forward to hope.
 
At the dedication of the State Historical Marker at the
 
grave of Blind Lemon Jefferson -
-
 a marker that John had
 
labored long and hard to see built -
-
 he said:
 
4
 
Lemon Jefferson imagined, and perhaps secretly hoped
 
for, a magnificent funeral.
 In view of this man's humble
 
funeral and of his grave before us, unattended, unkept and
 
unmarked these 38 years past, his wish has been ironic.
 It
 
is fitting that this strong desire of Blind Lemon Jefferson,
 
the front-runner of all our great blues singers, be at last
 
fulfilled.  .
 .
 This monument and marker locate the place he
 
returned, but his greatest memorial lives on forever in the
 
melodies he made."  And he sang Blind Lemon's song with the
 
verse: 
"
Well, there's one kind favor I'll ask of you
 
Please see that my grave is kept clean .
 
John's involvement, his love affair, with the Blues was life-
long,  just as was his entanglement with the songs of the cattle
 
trail and the prison camp.
 He was a major element in two movies
 
about celebrated blues singers of Texas -
-
 a major element up to
 
and including the financing; and I don't doubt that Les Blank,
 
with whom he worked on those two films,  could tell us how crucial
 
that element is.
 
Here's what he wrote about a prison song he made us all to know:
 
" .
 .
 .
 Sixty years ago the Brazos bottom land around Sugarland
 
was a waving cane brake of hellish heat worked by convict labor,
 
hired privately at 500  per day, per head.
 The cruelty of this
 
inhuman system became apparent, was eliminated by law -
-
 the
 
cane fields are no more.
 But the taste of the sweat and blood,
 
the lash of the whip, and the overtones of savage emotion, still
 
linger in the slow sweep of the cane knives in "Ain't No More
 
Cane on This Brazos".
 
John would have liked, and the family want, those of you who
 
want to remember in company for a little longer, to come by
 
the home place at 6
'28 Vanderbilt; and we remind you lovingly
 
that there is the
 
John A. Lomax Jr. Memorial Fund
 
to carry on some of John's activities, to which contributions
 
may be sent c/o Camilla Hom e,  8lL

BEN RAMEY
 
The Texas Folklore Society deeply regrets and mourns the passing
 
of John Lomax, Jr.
 He was a strong and vital man who contributed
 
much in song and spirit to the Society's meetings.
 He will be
 
long remembered by Society members for the pleasure he has given.
 
The Lomax family has been associated with the Texas Folklore
 
Society since John Lomax, Sr., co-founded it in 1909.
 
The end
 
of a second ggneration of participation has come with the loss of
 
John and Mimi Lomax.
 The Society is saddened and will miss them
 
both very much.

John and I traveled many roads together and sang many songs
 
together.
 I remember one specific trip, when we were traveling
 
to Corpus Christi to do a program at Del Mar College.
 Dassia,
 
my wife, and Mimi Lomax were in the car with us.
 
From the moment we left Houston, and for the length of the
 
entire trip, John would have a story about every town we passed.
 
He knew about the people who settled there, where they came from,
 
what they did, and how they contributed to the folklore of the
 
area.
 
This went on for the full four hours of the trip; it was a
 
detailed history of this area of Texas.
 He told stories and

antedates that I am sure appear in no history books.

John got these stories from the people he befriended.
 He loved
 
this state and its people, and those who knew him loved him in
 
return
 
And then there were my adventures with "No Key" (as I used to
 
call him) Lomax.
 It would go something like this
 
During rehearsals we would try to play our instruments in
 
accompaniment to John's singing.  This proved to be a rigorous
 
exercise in musical chairs, with John up and us down, or visa
 
versa.  To make it short, we very seldom, if ever, found each
 
other
 And if we did, John would (
just to keep us honest)
 
change key in mid-song.
 
So it ended, as it almost always did, with John going it alone.
 
As I think about it now, it was the best way for John and the
 
rest of us .
.
.
.
 Just listen to his tapes and records, and you
 
will know what I mean.
 
HOWIE PORPER
 
1962 was a year of mixed blessing.
 I had come to Texas as a
 
bright young copywriter with the world as her oyster, but
 
when the oyster turned out less than good, I left San Antonio
 
and came to Houston with two little boys  and the phone number
 
of John Lomax.
 
I had never even soken to John or Mimi before and only had
 
their number because Pete Seeger said I should look them up
 
if I ever got to Houston, but they greeted me like long lost
 
kin, took me to Folklore Society meetings in the park and in
 
general made life in this city tolerable.
 
John treated me as a real person.
 He'd ask me to sing when
 
my shyness prevented me from asking for myself.  He and Mimi
 
nursed me through more punctured romances than Tillie ever
 
dreamed possible.
 He took my sons hiking, and Mimi stuffed
 
them with goodies, accepting the roles of surrogate grand-
parents, giving love all the time.
 John was even responsible
 
for my meeting the man I eventually married -
 he had come to
 
the Folklore Society to meet John, not me.
 
I'll always be glad that I knew John and Mimi, and I know
 
that th re can never be anyone to fill the gap they left in
 
my life.
 But the songs help -
 a little.

There is no good way that I know of to capture John Lomax on
 
paper.
 My words are weak and paint pictures in shades of black
 
and gray.
 Perhaps if alot of his friends write their memories,
 
something of substance will emerge.
 I would like to write down
 
my own memories for Joey and for Johnny III and also for myself
 
in appreciation of John and Margaret and all they both meant
 
for me over these years.
 
After they made Johnny L
.  they broke the mold, I keep hearing
 
myself saying and meaning it.
 Here in the mid-seventies we are
 
in an identity flux.
 Both sexes dress alike, faded jeans, long
 
hair, men's shirts.  And thanks to Freud we are all conscious of
 
both our maleness and femaleness (or vice versa).
 But John was
 
one of that vanishing breed, the All Man.
 You can still find
 
other ALL Man types out in the boondocks (particularly southern
 
and Texas boondocks.)  They work as county sheriffs, cops,
 
prison guards, as professional athletes, etc.
 But John was
 
atypical even of that breed.
 For he was All Man with passions.
 
At least two of them.  John's passions were for handball and
 
for folksongs (and I've always felt, but have no proof, that
 
they should be listed in that order.)
 
John's passions were fused.
 He fondled a handball with the
 
same tenderness he sang a cowboy lullaby; he sand a worksong
 
with the strength he exhibited on the court.
 Back in the early
 
fifties I was scrambling around Houston hunting for audiences
 
to regale with folksongs.  Whenever I found one I would hesita-
tingly call up John to see if he would sing with me, always
 
sure that by then he would have tired of the game and turn me
 
down.
 But he never did.
 In fact, he started in scrambling a
 
little himself and calling on me to help him out.  And we
 
enlisted a whole string of others over the years:
 Howie Porper,
 
Grace Cresswell, Jim and Kyla Bynum, Jimmie Lee Grubbs, Lightnin'
 
Hopkins, Mance Lipscomb, Pete Rose, Jim McConnell, Frank Davis,
 
and on and on.
 
The Houston Folklore Group was our main outlet (
it is now
 
"
Society", but we were far too politically progressive back
 
8
 
then to have any truck with something called a "society"), and
 
it remained John's primary outlet as long as he lived.
 It kept
 
us honest and active, and I hope it is still serving a new gen-
eration of singers and pickers as well as it served us.
 
But I was trying to make some kind of a living back then.
 So
 
for me our Alley Hootenanny in 1960 and the subsequent two
 
Hootenannies that played Cullen Auditorium (and previewed in
 
Corpus and Austin) and the folksong series at the Jewish Com-
munity Center were my primary interests.  Especially the second
 
Cullen Hoot, for by 1963 we were riding the crest of the national
 
folksong craze, and the audience poured in, filling the auditor-
ium, and we had a couple of thousand people hanging onto our
 
every note.
 I must admit that I was impressed by both the size
 
of the crowd and the fact that we were in the vanguard of what
 
was "happening".
 But John didn't look on that program as any-
thing special.
 As a matter of fact, I have always suspected
 
that if John ever had a high point through those years, it was
 
reached during the fifties, the year that the national handball
 
tournament was held in Houston, and John promoted several of us
 
to sing for their closing night banquet.
 That was the only time
 
I ever saw John's two passions truly joined.
 I believe (but
 
would not swear) that the banquet was held at Ye Olde College
 
Inn.
 I do remember being scared
, as hell at offering our rather
 
esoteric entertainment to that audience.
 But I also remember
 
John bouncing around the place happy as a kid in a toy factory,
 
or as a CIA agent who has just broken the Russian code.
 
For me John always personified folksinging as art and recreation.
 
His father had completely torpedoed the traditional boundaries
 
of the folklore of his day.
 (
John, Sr. had not given one damn
 
about version one over versions two, three, and four, but thought
 
that the songs were beautiful and meaningful and should be sung
 
and heard--so he and Alan would combine versions to produce the
 
most complete, singable one.  And so John, Jr.  cared not a rap
 
for academic recognition or monetary status.
 It was immaterial
 
to him whether or not an audience had paid to hear him sing.
 
And he cared not for their expertise.  John's loyalties were only
 
to the songs, and he was true to them always.  And he breathed
 
life into them everytime he opened his mouth to sing.  John's
 
coarse, leathery voice and the strength of his personality fit
 
some of the songs as I have never heard anyone else fit them.
 
"The Gray Goose", "Take a Whiff on Me",  "Do Lord Remember Me",
 
"All the Baby Chickens", and "Ain't No More Cane on the Brazos"--
these were peculiarly and particularly John's turf.  And once
 
you heard his version,any subsequent performance--even by an
 
Ives or a Seeger--seemed superfluous.
 And especially this was
 
true of "John Henry".
 
I heard John sing "
John Henry" innumerable times over the years.
 
Yet I never heard him do it exactly the same way twice, nor did
 
it ever have the same emotional impact, although it was always
 
moving, always an experience to hear him sing it.
 But the most
 
memorable performance I remember was on a program at the Jewish
 
Community Center in the mid-fifties.
 Ben Ramey was on hand as
 
a fund raiser (we wanted to buy a Folklore Group tape recorder),
 
and we combined a live concert (
John, Howie, and myself) with
 
films of Josh White, Burl Ives, and Pete Seeger.
 At the height
 
of the live part of the program '
the houselights went down to
 
John's "John Henry."  Howie was accompanying John on guitar, and
 
I on banjo.
 In the semi-darkness the little boy "no bigger than
 
the palm of your hand" suddenly began breathing, and before our
 
ears he grew to manhood and put his life and virility on the line
 
pitted against the white man's technology.
 I got so into the
 
thing that I had to think about tapping my foot.  When it ended
 
and the lights came up, there was no applause.
 I blinked the
 
tears from my eyes to see why.  Women were bawling openly,
 
men (who must, of course, project toughness a t all times) were
 
sitting with averted eyes and were busy clearing several pounds
 
of phlegm from their bronchial passages.
 I have attended and
 
participated in a fair amount of performances before and since.

But personally I cannot remember another moment which approached
 
that one in emotional power.  John's version of "
John Henry"
 
contained the word "nigger" in many places.
 Usually Ezra
 
Schacht and others would lecture John about using the word on
 
a public performance.
 But that night not a soul mentioned it.
 
John used to get alot of static about his use of the word
 
"nigger."  Well meaning static, true.
 But I never heard John
 
use the word in an insulting or belittling way.
 He used it
 
sociologically as Mark Twain had used it in Huckleberry Finn.
 
Blacks, especially country blacks, used to call each other
 
"nigger" all the time, in the same way whites call each other
 
motherfucker or sonuvabitch.
 I could never comfortably use
 
the word myself, although even then I felt that nigger was
 
kinder than the then socially acceptable equivalent,  "nig-ra."
 
(
That word sounded obscene everytime I ever heard it used,
 
even when Lyndon Johnson used it in presenting the case for
 
civil rights legislation.)  But I never minded John's use of
 
"nigger'  never knew it to offend a black (though it offended
 
many a white liberal), and never joined in the pressure on John
 
to quit using it.
 John did gradually ease up on using the word,
 
I have heard.
 
Politically John was pretty conservative, I suspect, though
 
how conservative I am not exactly sure, for I was far too
 
fond of John to ever get him into a serious political discus-
sion.
 I respected John's opinions though, and I think he re-
spected mine.
 He used to delight in singing anti-Roosevelt
 
parodies, and it always amused me that these musical slanders
 
came not from rightwingers of the 1930's,
 but from the dedicated
 
left.
 Specifically from the Almanac Singers: Pete, Bess, Woody,
 
Lee, and others.
 The songs were written during that brief period
 
before Hitler broke his nonaggression pact with Stalin, when the
 
left was poignantly anti-war and needled Roosevelt for helping
 
Britain.  John seemed to be sincerely devoted to the idea of
 
peace though, no matter what his politics were.
 He took to
 
Ed McCurdy's "Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream" like the
 
proverbial duck to water.  And during Korea and during Vietnam,
 
and during the years between, John would have us end program af-
ter program with it.  And John would sing the lead with the full
 
force of his virile, WASP power, conducting the audience with
 
his waving arms, and the song in John's hands was indeed a mov-
ing end to an evening.
 
John's voice was a rather unique instrument, as coarse and
 
pock-marked and as strong and masculine as himself.
 I figured
 
that such a blunt, unaffected instrument just had to be a shock
 
to your average middleclass Houstonian of the fifties and sixties,
 
weaned as they all were on bel canto. And so, to help John
 
bridge this gap I always had him accompanied on the programs I
 
produced, even though I personally preferred to hear him a capel-
10, and know he preferred to sing that way.
 I honestly believe
 
that it did help make our audiences accept John.
 Most of the
 
time he agreed graciously to our accompaniment, though once in a
 
while he would insist on singing alone.
 Needless to say, when
 
he insisted, he won.
 Over many years of accompanying John
 
I learned to appreciate his really unique musical sense.  John
 
seemed to many to be constantly shifting keys in mid-performance.
 
But he only did this when he was nervous, or when one of us
 
tried to put him in a key that was comfortable for us rather than
 
right for him.
 Then John would very likely transpose midway
 
-t
hrough, sliding into a more comfortable key.  When he was in his
 
usual form, and if you let him pick his own key, he would stay
 
in that key not only during that performance, but would choose
 
the same key months, even years later.
 John sang "Do Lord Remem-
ber Me" in the key of G on the first occasion I met him, a party
 
Harold Belikoff gave for the Weavers on a Sunday in March, 1950.
 
And John was still singing the song in the key of G in 1964, on
 
his solo concert on our J.C.C. folksong series.
 
I don't want to go very far into John's family life, because
 
11
 
that was his and Margaret's private domain.
 But I do think it
 
is appropriate to say a few words about Margaret here.
 John
 
Seeger, Pete's older brother, once told me that Pete would not
 
have been what he was without Toshi, and knowing Toshi I believe
 
him.  And I believe that John would not have been possible with-
out Margaret.
 They were a real couple, such as you don't often
 
see these days.
 Margaret was indefatigable and created the home
 
and family environment which enabled John to go out and play his
 
handball and sing his folksongs.  And Margaret went to her fair
 
share of Folklore Group meetings and concerts, usually bringing
 
her knitting with her so as to fully utilize her time.
 Margaret
 
was the type that worked day and night, for John, for her kids,
 
for the rest of the family, for her alma mater, for her church,
 
and for numerous other causes she took to her breast.
 I was
 
stunned to hear of her death in June of 1973,
 and it is a testa-
ment to Joey and to the family and friends that John was able
 
to survive Margaret by a year and a half.
 
I missed the memorial service for John by one week.
 But I got
 
a vivid description of the proceedings from those who were there.
 
Marice spoke, Lightniri' sang, and so did Alan and Bess and Hally
 
Wood.  And they played a tape of John singing, and everyone
 
there sang along.
 Those of us who were fortunate enough to have
 
heard John over the years will have our own favorite memories of
 
him.
 Some who never heard him will perhaps discover his Folkways
 
album, which, like these words, only shows John in shades of
 
black and gray, but that is far better than not knowing him at
 
all.  The vacuum at his death is still not fully apparent to me,
 
for in my view John was the folk equivalent of a national asset,
 
and his death is comparable to the sudden disappearance of the
 
Grand Canyon.
 In fact, I think I prefer not to admit our loss
 
at all, but to just go on pretending that John is still over
 
there in West University Place, waiting, should I ever want to
 
come back to Houston to start promoting folksong concerts again.
 
I think that is all I can accept at this particular moment of
 
my life.
 
ED BADEAUX
 
John was an unselfish pleasure-giver with his songs and an
 
inspiration to us all.
 And many an aspiring folksinger felt
 
that a word of praise from him was as encouraging as applause
 
from an auditorium.
 
After his heart attack, John complained that he couldn't remem-
ber his songs, and it was painful to see him resort to singing
 
from a book.  But I believe he had that licked.
 One night
 
last year he was at my house with Pete Wheeler.  As they were
 
leaving, some mention was made of the classic oration supposedly
 
delivered in the Arkansas Legislature on changing the name of
 
Arkansas.
 There on our driveway, in good voice, with expression
 
and gestures, he declaimed the whole, long speech.
 If any
 
neighbors were listening, I hope they enjoyed it as much as I
 
did.
 
LANE GOLDSMITH
 
To this day, there have been two high points in my life.
 One was
 
the nearly three years I spent in Nashville, learning about myself,
 
and the other, the one year I spent serving the Lomax family,
 
helping John on the road to recovery.
 There will be many stories
 
in this tribute to John, about his kindness to people, his love
 
for Mimi, and other aspects, that make up John A. Lomax, Jr., so
 
I am going to talk about things that John liked.  What John liked
 
can be wrapped up in one word, and that is competition. John
 
thrived on competition--in his business and especially in his
 
sports.
 I never saw John play handball, but I have been told he
 
was murder on the court.  But I can speak firsthand about John's
 
love for the game "Pounce," a card game sometimes called double
 
solitaire.
 "Pounce" is a card game that the Lomaxes played when
 
they were all young, and Shirley Lomax Mansell told me that
 
12
 
watching John A. Lomax and his four kids: Shirley, John, Alan,
 
and Bess.  playing this game was a sight to behold.
 Laughing,
 
shouting, arguing, and it was all because each had the desire
 
to win, but to win and have fun doing it.
 My John used to
 
murder me at this game, and he was very nice about me losing.
 
But when I beat him, he became a friendly tiger, and he wanted
 
a chance to get it back.  John taught me inner strength, and I
 
will be forever grateful that God gave me that year with John
 
A. Lomax, Jr.

THE CASE OF THE UNACCOMPANIED FOLK SINGER
 
By John A. Lomax
 
This article is in no way an apology for nor in defense of
 
unaccompanied singing, which is my style, but is more of an
 
explanation of it.
 
I estimate some 9
5% of real folksongs were made up as unaccom-
panied songs and a large proportion were later collected as such.
 
Certainly this is true of the work song category; the working
 
cowboy's hands were fully occupied as he guarded the herds,
 
likewise the sailor had no place for accompaniment during his
 
inc heaving; the penitentiary work gangs, with or without a
 
ong leader, improvised songs only with oral rhythm.
 For my
 
art I feel that these are among the best folksongs, the meat
 
end potatoes so to speak, and they can be resung truer and
 
better if done unaccompanied.
 
bccepting the premise that the song came first, is it not
 
important that it be kept foremost?  To me every word of a song
 
is essential to assure the full impact on the audience.
 The
 
emotional theme of a mood song or the powerful narrative of a
 
ballad are sufficient for my taste, and I wish them fully to
 
each my listeners.
 Most of the great folksingers as Leadbelly,
 
lurl, Mance, Lightnin', Pete, and many others use accompaniment,
 
but artfully and usually subdued.
 On the other hand, I heartily
 
agree with the thought I recently heard on the radio:  "
If the
 
words of a song are not understandable, the singer would have
 
been better to have stayed in bed."  In retrospect, I recall
 
countless times, it seems, when I have unsuccessfully strained
 
to catch the words of a good song but due to the volume of the
 
accompaniment, could not.  And, Lord.
!  That interminable tuning.
!
 
It tests the patience of even the best audience;
 an unaccom-
panied singer would be going way down the road during the "tuning
 
gap."
 
A final point concerns numerous songs with unique melodies which
 
defy accompaniment.
 Often the singer will distort the melody,
 
to the song's detriment, in order to present the song.
 As an
 
example, accompaniment to a field holler is a burden, and I wish
 
to be untrammeled when I sing one.
 My sister, a trained musician,
 
learned,as I did,  "All the Chickens in the Garden" from the
 
oral rendition of our father; however, when she attempted to
 
capture the melody in written notes for use in her guitar classes,
 
he found that she was unable to do so.
 
John Lomax was a strong, honest man.
 None of us who knew him
 
will forget him.
 
PETE SEEGER
 
I really didn't know John Lomax, Jr. very well.
 Oh, I would see
 
him several times a year at the society meetings and maybe one
 
or two other times perhaps at a concert or at the store.  The
 
types of music we were interested in were not really alike.
 His
 
was mostly the southern work song,  cowboy ballad,  or blues type
 
13
 
song.
 Mine was the southern mountain song or tear-jerker of
 
the 1890's.
 John expressed himself through the words of the
 
song;  I preferred to do it through the instruments used to
 
play the melody.  I believe John couldn't have cared less about
 
musical instruments, whereas that is my first love.
 So why
 
did I admire and respect the man so much?
 
Sincerity and integrity.
 I believe those two virtures were the
 
things that I admired in John.
 When he sang a song, somehow
 
one felt that that was the way the song should be done.
 He
 
didn't change the beat or accent certain phrases to simply
 
please the crowd or because that's the way it was done on a
 
bestselling record.
 Indeed,  I didn't care for many of his songs
 
at all, but I never doubted the honesty with which they were
 
done.
 His songs were done with a love for the songs and not to
 
try to sell a million records.
 It i
s something that I think
 
we would all do well to remember.

Even in the mid-1920's, one hesitated to speak of a teenaged
 
boy as a fine person, but John Lomax was the exception.
 In Austin
 
High School, Austin, Texas, John was known not only as a top
 
scholar, but as a young man of integrity and fine character.
 He
 
was admired by the student body and the faculty members alike
 
and was the outstanding favorite during h
i
 four year high school
 
career.

any lost a friend when John Lomax died.
 I
iany felt his going
 
as deeply as a family loss, so great was his capacity for
 
friendship.
 He had so many virtues that it might have been
 
embarrassing to know him but for the comfortable ease with which
 
he carried them all,  so unself-consciously that they had the feel
 
of childlike innocence.
 Virtue in him was not merely dependable,
 
it was inevitable.
 We k
night have taken it for granted except
 
that we were reminded just as inevitably that he was unique:
 
where else find good critical sense with tolerance, strength
 
with tenderness, generosity with acumen, cheerfully salty humor
 
with richly moral values.
 This is more than most of us will
 
leave in our friends' hearts, but John had still another gift.
 
He sang.
 He sang our own songs for us, recreating the accuracy
 
of pitch, the apparent simplicity, the self-effacing absence
 
of histrionics learned first in his family and then from many
 
other singers.
 Man and singer he was the real thing -
-
 a living
 
definition of American folksong.
 
HALLY WOOD
 
I remember John Lomax best in a series of flashbacks, each one a
 
story in itself:
 
Meeting John for the first time, around 1951,
 at our house
 
when the Weavers came to visit.
 
When John sang our two older kids would burst with fun-
laughing, loving the singing but struck with the strange
 
voice and the fun gestures.
 
We pegged John for an arch conservative when he poked fun,
 
with zest, at FDR in song...
 
Until he, with more zest, sang:  "Last Night I Had the
 
Strangest Dream."
 
Though Margaret said we were putting the cart before the
 
horse, John, Ed Badeaux, Chester Bower, and I started the
 
Houston Folklore Society around 1951-2
 or so, because we
 
wanted to catch and hold onto all the folk things around
 
US.
 
Which led John to say to me:  "You ought to get back into
 
the Folklore Group, you were one of the ORIGINALS".
 
John, a macho on the handball court, urged me to give it
 
a try even after a 20-year layoff.
 
From performances at the Jewish Community Center:
 
John hammering away at a log with an ax to set the mood
 
for a worksong he was belting out.
 
Holdirvr out his hand to show how John Henry's dad held
 
dim in the palm of his hand.
 
And up came the gun that laid low the Gray Goose--Bim Bar
n.
 
Ezra Schact trying to persuade John not to use "nigger"
 
even if that was the way it was sung in the original.
 
And a booming:
 "
I went down Ellum and turned up Main
 
Looking for the man who sells cocaine"
 
John wearing his sandals, a symbol of his unpretentious
 
individualism.
 
A courageous John saying that he had a rough time with
 
the cancer that hit him but that he would lick it, and
 
he did.
 
Two weeks before he died, John sitting under and talking
 
about a painting of a younger,  strapping,  swimming John.
 
15
 
Wearing his farmer's straw hat and flannel shirt and
 
sporting a cane to help him walk after he was hit by
 
a car, John looked the picture of health.
 
At his funeral, all of us singing:
 "When my blood
 
runs chilly and cold" brought tears to all of our
 
eyes, including our older daughter who remembered
 
with nostalgia laughing so hard when John sang.
 
John and his songs stay with me strong and deep like the man
 
he was.
 
So long, John, it's been good to know you.

I welcome the privilege to express my feelings of admiration
 
and profound respect for my departed friend and associate, John
 
Lomax.
 
It takes more than a short acquaintance to discover and fully
 
evaluate the finer points of a person's character, and over the
 
years that I knew him, John Lomax never deviated from his prin-
ciples of fairness and sincerity in all things, a determination
 
to accomplish, and a deep concern for the welfare of others.
 
He was a gentle man but forceful, devoted to his family and
 
considerate of all others.
 
MAX L
. ANTHONY
 
My earliest memories of John Lomax, Jr. date back to about
 
1912.  John then was five years old, his sister Shirley seven,
 
and I was nine.
 My grandmother Brown's home was in Austin,
 
and nearby lived her daughter, Bess Brown Lomax (Mrs. John
 
Lomax, Sr.).  During my frequent grandparent visits, as much
 
of my time as possible was spent with my cousins Shirley and
 
John.
 Hence, I cherish memories which span a large part of
 
his lifetime.
 Since I had no brother or sister, Shirley and
 
John provided the next best substitute.
 
Compared with today, children's past-time activities were
 
simple.
 Trees were very important.  We climbed them prodigiously,
 
and even fell out of them, sometimes breaking bones.
 I have a
 
vivid memory of John being such a victim, and Shirley and I being
 
held accountable therefor.
 
Children's toys and possessions were sparse but adequate.
 A bi-
cycle was about the ultimate.
 Next came a baseball and bat, and
 
maybe a glove.
 I don't recall our being interested in tracking
 
down Indians, but an air rifle was treasured for bird hunting.
 
A homemade sling shot was a must.
 
We children played games alot; marbles, tops, hop-scotch, base-
ball (
strictly no adults involved).  We collected coupons and
 
baseball hero pictures which came in cigaret packages (
Camel,
 
Chesterfield, and 3 or L others completed the field).
 Since
 
"allowances" for children had not then been invented, money was
 
rarely one of our possessions.
 However, every boy always car-
ried in his pockets at least a few marbles and usually one or
 
more tops.
 Such items served as a medium of exchange among
 
the neighborhood children and effectively constituted our
 
wealth.
 Incidentally, such money was sound and not plagued by
 
inflation.
 
John's parents were remarkable, outstanding, and truly unique;
 
virtues which escaped me until some twenty years later.
 His
 
father was professor of English at the University of Texas,
 
and his mother was an equally ardent scholar.
 Her cultural
 
interests guided the activities within the Lomax home--it is
 
no wonder that I was so attracted to such an atmosphere.
 Books
 
 
4
 
16
 
filled the Lomax home, and the children thus became avid
 
readers.
 
Reading was not confined to classics.  A highlight each week
 
came when, on Sunday morning,  "Uncle John" to me and "Father"
 
to Shirley and John, would take us to the University where he
 
had access to assorted newspapers.  We children gleaned the
 
"funnies" from his papers, spread ourselves on the f
loor to
 
pursue our studies at university level.
 The "Katzenjammer
 
Kids" were the most sought "comics" those days; Mutt and Jeff
 
were close contenders.
 Thus began John's literary career.
 
In the Lomax home an upright piano was a prominent tool.
 
Aunt Bess used it effectively.
 I thought she was wonderful;
 
but I doubt now that she took prizes as a classical musician.
 
I was very impressed by another item about the size of an
 
oversize shoe box.
 It was an early portable Edison phonograph
 
which recorded on a wax cylinder and could play back at very
 
low level.
 I recall that Uncle John had used it to "collect"
 
cowboy songs.
 Thus John had the advantage of homegrown music
 
around him ever since he first learned to fall out of trees.
 
Fortunately for me, my contacts with John have been quite
 
frequent through all of his lifetime.
 He was very fond of
 
my father, his "Uncle Allie".
 That mutual fondship likely
 
partially influenced John to settle in Houston when he re-
turned from World War II.  When my dad retired from railroad-
ing at age 70, he and John embarked in the real estate devel-
oping business in Houston.
 I participated with t
}
m to a
 
small degree.
 This wonderful relationship between John and
 
my father spanned twenty years.
 Certainly it extended my
 
father's life and contributed to his reaching age 91 and
 
enjoying every year of it.
 I am truly grateful to John.

Jan. 20, 1975
 
John A. Lomax gave us all the idea that folksingers and folk-
singing were not really all that queer and then gave us a place
 
to ply our avocation among friends.
 For that alone there ought
 
to be a reward in the hereafter.
 
PETE WHEELER
 
"Ain't no more cane on de Brazos
 
It's all been ground into molasses"
 
Big John is gone, but his strong voice lingers in my mind as if
 
it were only yesterday that we walked through Memorial Park
 
along John's "ghost" trail talking about Leadbelly, John's
 
father, Woody Guthrie, and a host of other lively topics.  John
 
had a kind of wisdom and wit that made his stories come alive
 
with the warmth of an early summer morning breeze and the zest
 
of a glass of Shiner Beer.  We all will miss John Lomax, miss
 
him when we feel the need of a strong song sung from a deep
 
understanding and lo-e.
 
John and I rode the same trail for about five years.
 It was a
 
good trail, well marked, brushed out and free of troublesome
 
entanglements.  We collected Folkmusic and Lore together among
 
the Black people of Texas.  John had a great love for the Black
 
man, he saw him through eyes that were wide open; honest eyes.
 
I remember once when a film crew was in Houston and wanted to
 
talk to John and myself.  Actually they wanted to talk to John,
 
and John included
, me in the deal out of generosity and companion-
ship.  We met with the earnest  young cinematographers, dispelling
 
their fears and giving solid counsel for the project they had in
 
mind.
 John then suggested that we repair to the old second ward
 
area where we could take in a show at Irene's Place that might
 
interest all of us.
 
I noticed a twinkle in John's eye and began to guess what he had
 
in mind.  We traveled through the bug humming night to the second
 
ward, which at that time was badly in need of road repair and
 
arhsse p
ickur.

Hopkins was playing.
 The soft and soulful raging of Lightnin's
 
guitar transported the entire scene back to the early thirties;
 
it was the Blues.
 
We entered Irene's Place and saw i
rn" diately that we were the
 
only white people in the establishment.  John smiled that great
 
grin of his toward the little raised bandstand and hollered,
 
"Mr. Sam "Lightnin " Hopkins, I brought some friends to hear
 
the world's greatest Blues Man."  Lightnin' was quick to respond,
 
"Mr. John, folks, this is my main man, Mr. John Lomax, and any
 
friend of his is a friend of mine."  The joint returned to a pleas-.
 
ant hilarity, and we sat down at a table with several Black people
 
and proceeded to enjoy the very substantial talents of Sam Hopkins.
 
The evening wound down pleasantly until closing time; as the bar
 
began to empty, we hung o
n.  John had begun an animated conversa-
tion with one of the patrons on some obscure and totally irrevelent
 
subject.  As soon as this broke off, John and Lightnin' took it up;
 
their conversation was in the light banter of old friends, there
 
was no black and white, no rich and poor, no barriers of any kind.
 
John asked politely after Lightnin's woman, and Lightnin' asked
 
about Margaret.
 Clearly they were pleased to be in each other's
 
company.
 
After listening for a moment, I noted a subtle change in Sam's
 
demeanor.
 "You think you're a good enough hand at pool to take
 
on a poor nigger?" Sam asked, playing to John with the broadest
 
of pathic comedy.  John didn't blink an eye.
 "Lightnin', that
 
day has come when this old boy is going to clean your clock "
 
And then began the greatest game of pool it has ever been my
 
fortune to observe.
 John would attempt and make shots that
 
would have driven masters of the game to tears, only to be
 
topped by Sam Hopkins in a kind of immitation drunken grace
 
and stumbling charm that was completely disarming.  All the while
 
the two men played the "Dozens" on each other with a mock ferocity
 
that terrified the handful of movie men watching the game.  As
 
the match neared its completion the two men began to chuckle and
 
snort a little.  When Lightnin' made a final shot that brought
 
the game to an end, John roared with laughter.
 "Old Lightnin'
 
and me shore had you guessing that times" was John's closing
 
remark made through the gales of happy sounds that were eminating
 
from our film crew members.  John Lomax had effectively demon-
strated his own humanity and the humanity of people of every
 
color, in a short fun-filled pool game in a dive in Houston's
 
second ward.
 
I remember another walk on John's "Ghost Trail", in fact, it was
 
our first jaunt over this rough bit of real estate in Houston's
 
Memorial Park.  With us were my wife, our children, and Mike
 
Ledbetter, editor of the English publication "Blues Unlimited",
 
who was in the States researching the lives and work of Blues artists.
 
The day was a h
ct one, one of those South Texas summer scorchers
 
when the heat and the humidity were rivaling each other for the
 
unpleasant honor of being the highest.  This did not bother John
 
who loped through the brush and brambles like a billy goat.
 
Mike was doing his best to keep up, and I was huffing and puffing,
 
being about fifty pounds heavier than at present.  John was com-
menting on the unusually large number of "mully-huggers" that were
 
said to inhabit the woods.
 My children immediately corrupted this
 
into "mother huggers" and were just a bit fearful why any beast
 
of the forest would want to hug their mother,who was the self-
proclaimed champion of all animals.
 Still John stalked on, talk-
ing of the days when Johnny and Joe were in Scouting, and he was
 
a Scout leader.
 
Suddenly an armadillo burst from its place of hiding and made a
 
breakaway from the strung-out group.  This was just the excitement
 
John was waiting for.
 He leaped in hot pursuit, "A Mully-hugger!"
 
he proclaimed in his easy drawl and crashed through the under-
growth.
 "A Mother-hugger!" cried my kids and charged after John
 
with the exurberance of 6 and 7 year olds, followed by their
 
18
 
then chubby father yelling,  "It's an armadillo, careful, they
 
can scratch like hell "  And finally by Mike Ledbetter wondering
 
outloud,  "What the bloody hell has gotten into you yanks?"  We
 
all ran the poor "Hoover Hog" around bushes and trees, up mud banks
 
and down creek draws, always with John's 60-year-old body in firm
 
and graceful lead.
 We ended our chase along the banks of the
 
Bayou.
 Talking of animals and incidents out of the past, a warm
 
feeling of closeness and pleasant exhaustion permeated us all.
 
I also remember the evening that John came to our house with a
 
large sack in his arms.
 He had bicycled over from his house.
 
After the briefest of conversation, John announced that he had
 
come to visit our children, not us, so thank you, man, where
 
were they?
 
The four Skoog children had gone to bed already, but a visit
 
from John Lomax was an important event, and we, or rather John,
 
roused them out of their beds and trooped them upstairs to our
 
attic room, leaving the sack with us.
 John's instructions were
 
simple,  "Put this in the refrigerator and bring it when I say."
 
Joan and I quickly did his bidding.
 
The sounds that proceeded to come from the upstairs kept us
 
chuckling and singing along .
for about an hour.
 Then a deep
 
voice sent out a cry from upstairs,  "Okay, we're ready for
 
our ice cream, and be quick about it!"  We quickly complied
 
filling bowls with rich, smooth ice cream and joining the
 
play-party upstairs.
 
The evening ended with smiles all around and a kind of happy
 
grace that lasted far, far longer than the evening.
 John
 
Lomax had performed in front of the audience he loved best.

There exists in the garden behind the Lomax family home on

cision-cut natural Texas stone, a fine relic of the stone
 
business John Lomax started when he and Mimi first moved
 
to Houston in the L
i0's.
 I have discovered that most every-
thing John Avery Lomax, Jr.  did was as solid and as endurable
 
as that natural Texas stone. .  . including the indelible impres-
sion he left on me.
 
I met John in September, 1973, having become friends with his
 
son Joe, and soon learned that he had had a stroke which af-
fected mostly his ability to remember from day to day even the
 
simplest of events.
 That John was even alive was testimony to
 
his rock-like strength, for he had died no less than eight
 
times when the stroke occurred.
 In the beginning I questioned
 
John on how he felt and when he replied that he was awfully
 
miserable because he couldn't remember things too well, I
 
decided Joe and I would take John with us on our many outings
 
and perhaps through sheer enjoyment of the activities, make
 
him forget his forgetfulness.
 
Our first trip was one of many Sunday crabbing expeditions.
 
There were Joe and John and I, Lynda Herrera, Frank Davis,
 
Danny Schact, and Bob Novotny, all piled into Bob's pickup
 
truck with crab nets, bait, potato salad, sandwiches, and
 
beer.
 Although the weather was inclement and we caught no
 
crabs, John Lomax saved the day with his storytelling and
 
singing.
 We returned that evening tired and hoarse from
 
singing all the way back to Houston, but we were very happy.
 
The most notable of our excursions was a trip to the Big Bend
 
of Texas in late February of  '
714,
 where we fashioned a raft out
 
of truck innertubes, wooden poles, and lashing and entering the
 
Rio Grande River, the international boundary between Texas
 
Mexico, from the camp sight of Talley, rafted into Mari c
 
Canyon where we
 topred and camped for several days.
 e
 
19
 
placed John high and dry in the middle of the raft atop the
 
ice chest, and in return for his not getting so much as his
 
feet wet, he showered us with (among other things) recitals
 
of Hell in Texas, the story of how this part of Texas, the
 
Big Bend, was so rough and bad that God let the Devil have
 
it as his own.  Joe would prompt John into remembering by
 
saying,  "Daddy, sing this song for us-like Tee Roo'
,
' or
 
"Daddy, sing us the Texian B
o
y s "
. 
And he would forget his
 
forgetfulness and remember for us.  While camped inside the
 
canyon, I heard John do a water yell that because of its
 
nature required an echo.
 Taught to him by his father, John
 
Avery Lomax, it went:
 
Oh say
  
ling on the lake
  
It wasn 't until we discussed it that Joe or I got the j
ist
 
of the j
ingle.  Again, on this trip John displayed his remark-
able stamina,for the Big Bend wilds are not soft camping
 
grounds, and John fared as well as any of the rest of us who
 
are under 30 years of age.
 
One of the greatest times I remember was when Hally Wood came
 
through Houston on her way to Denver.
 She has been a friend
 
of the Lomax family and musically associated with them for
 
years.  Joe planned a file gumbo party and sing-in for the
 
benefit of John,and many people from the folklore society
 
came to the Lomax home for a day of singing and gaiety, the
 
likes of which I've never seen.
 It so happened that Sonny
 
Terry and Brownie McGee were in town that weekend, and it
 
proved to be a memorable meeting of old and respected friends
 
for John.
 
In July of 1974  Joe and John took off for the summer.  John
 
went to Easthampton, New York, where he summered with his
 
sisters Bess and Shirley and his brother Alan.  My friends
 
and I missed John, for he had come to be a friend much in
 
demand, because he exhibited unique qualities and had built
 
quite a reputation among us as a true adventurer and incom-
parable storyteller and folksinger.  But it was prophetic
 
that he spent his last summer with his family who also loved
 
him very much and fussed over him in a way we could not.
 
John Lomax was a tower of strength to the end, and it was the
 
result of an accident that brought him back to Houston to re-
cuperate.  While in the state of Maine in late October, 1974,
 
John was hit by a truck while standing on a street corner.
 
He was thrown L
iO feet and sustained only minor injuries, and
 
not a
. scratch could be found on him.
 He returned to Houston
 
in November and in the ensuing month before his death he was
 
able to visit with almost all of his friends including Mance
 
Lipscomb and many members of the Houston Folklore Society.
 
He was in his home on Vanderbilt when he died a very quick
 
and private death.
 I shall miss him.

The following was originally written as an article for the
 
Houston Folklore Society publication in May, 1967.
 We are
 
reprinting it here for the "behind-the-scenes" picture of
 
the birth of the first album in which John A. Lomax, Jr.
 
appeared.  John subsequently participated in "Unexpurgated
 
Songs for Men" collected by Mack McCormick and also made a
 
solo album "John A. Lomax, Jr. Sings" for Folkways.
 
I REIV MBER THE TEX-I-AN BOYS
 
By Ed Badeaux
 
Reading Tom Stern's very friendly review of our Tex-I-An Boys
 
album on Folkways in a recent issue of the Bulletin brought
 
back a flood of fond memories.
 The album itself, the arrange-
20
 
ments,  polishing and rehearsing, and actual recording covered a
 
period of about five months.
 After it was completed, we went
 
on for a couple of years singing the material on television
 
(
Channel ii) and at hootenannies.
 Of the record itself, I h a ve
 
mixed feelings.
 It was a challenge and fun to make, but any
 
recording is but a shadow of what went into it.
 More important
 
to me were our other efforts, beginning with the founding of
 
the Houston Folklore Group in 1952,
 and running through the
 
course of the fifties and sixties with countless hootenannies,
 
parties, radio programs, and other lively attempts to enlighten
 
the happy, sleeping angel that is Houston as to the things that
 
are really worthwhile and important in this life of ours.
 These
 
attempts, I must admit, in spite of our near Herculean efforts,
 
aroused only the most gentle of breezes, barely tickling the
 
fine down which grows on the sleeping angel's shoulderblades.
 
But to get back to the album,  it, and for that matter the
 
hootenannies, were neither art nor scholarship.  We loved,
 
and still love, the songs and were interested in keeping
 
their spirit alive and growing.
 We began the project for
 
Audio/Fidelity records.
 They wanted an album of Te as songs
 
to sell the many expatriate and would-be Texans who abound in
 
the nation as a whole.
 Of course, they had in mind songs like
 
"Deep in the Heart of Texas" and "When It's Roundup Time in
 
Texas" and "The Bloom is on the Sage."  They knew nothing, and
 
cared less, for the many wonderful folksongs Texas has spawned.
 
They had originally gotten in touch with Alan Lomax through
 
Oscar Brand, who had sung many of his cleaned-up dirty songs
 
for A/F.
 Alan wasn't interested and sent them to brother John.
 
John had me visit them and work out the details as I passed
 
through New York, returning from camp in Vermont.
 I got an
 
advance of two-hundred from A/F to get things rolling, and I
 
got together the cream of the folk musicians around Houston
 
at that  t
ime: John, Howie Porper, Pete Rose, Jim McConnell,
 
and Ed Pyett.
 We decided to make the album half folk and half
 
popular, selected our songs, and began working out arrange-
ments.
 We began in September, and A/F was planning to come
 
down to Houston the first week in November to record.
 As per
 
their request I sent them up a tape of our progress in the
 
middle of October to let them see how they were coming.
 '
Twas
 
rather bad, I'm afraid.
 Not being working professionals, we
 
weren't really that polished after five weeks of rehearsals,
 
two a week.
 Also our hearts were in only half the material,
 
and A/F was really only interested in the other half.
 A
 
hasty phone call from New York followed by seconds the arrival
 
of the tape there, and the project was cancelled.
 
The Tex-I-An Boys held a strategy meeting and decided to hell
 
with commercial recording com panies; we would throw out most of
 
the commercial songs and replace them with real Texas folksongs
 
and try to get the album issued by Folkways.
 We cut down our
 
practice sessions to one per week, arranged to have the material
 
taped at the U of H FM station, and got down to work.  We kept
 
sereral of the popular songs ("San Antonio Rose",  "T for Texas",
 
"Remember the Alamo") because we felt that they reflected an
 
authentic feeling of a side of Texas life.
 But to "The Chisholri
 
Trail",  "The Boll Weevil Song", and "Streets of Laredo" we added
 
other lesser known Texas songs like "Cowboy's Dream",  "The
 
Galveston Flood", and "Long Summer Day".
 The songs themselves
 
were recorded on three successive Saturday mornings in late
 
December and January in 1961-62.
 Ed Pyett had begun to lose
 
interest during December and had dropped out before the record-
ing began, and so our number had decreased to five.
 Pete Rose
 
played mostly mandolin, though he accompanied John Lomax on
 
"tin't No More Cane on the Brazos" on guitar.
 Jim McConnell
 
ayed guitar on virtually all the group numbers, and I played
 
-
string banjo or autoharp on group numbers.
 On "T for Texas"
 
had three guitars going; Pete playing a good, steady rhythm,
 
Jim improvising in the lower part of the keyboard, and I
 
improvising at the top of the neck.
 
I edited the album during the spring of  '62 and got Mack
 
21
 
McCormick to write the notes.
 The record was issued the next
 
year, and though it was never a bestseller by any stretch of
 
the imagination, it did sell above the average Folkways album
 
e used the album as the basis of the first Hootenanny we did
 
t Cullen Auditorium in the spring of 1963, and our group was
 
o perform together from then on.
 
r
iree of the Tex-I--An Boys, Pete, Jim, and I
, did a second
 
'
ibum, mostly bluegrass, for Folkways, but unfortunately
 
dis album was never released.  This was unfortunate because
 
many ways this album was better than the other one.
 For
 
-i
e thing, we were much more experienced in playing together
 
i
en we recorded it in the late spring of 1964.
 And also
 
the equipment used to record it was better, Ampex tape
 
recorders and a Telefunken microphone.
 Perhaps this will
 
someday be issued, but since bluegrass is now very pro-
fessionalized, this seems unlikely.
 
Perhaps the most significant thing about both the albums and
 
the many programs which we have given around Houston is this
 
attitude of ours about professionalism.  We naturally began
 
to acquire a certain amount of professional gloss after our
 
years of performing together.
 But we not only didn't try to
 
develop this, we consciously fought against it.
 For basic
 
in our philosophy is the feeling that folkmusic is an amateur
 
music, a music for recreation and a music to stir and touch
 
basic emotions.
 For this reason we fought against becomins
 
glib and slick.  Ed Pyett had musically juiced up quite a few
 
of our arrangements in early Tex-I-An Boy days, but when he
 
dr pped out, we returned to more basic chords for accompani-
ment.
 For the record we knew more chords than we played,
 
but though we would play a fancy chord when it seemed to be
 
called for, we tried to be very conscious of the fact that
 
the accompaniment should supplement, not supplant, the song.
 
But perhaps the most unique thing about the album, and all of
 
our activities at that time, was that five individualists such
 
as we are, could ever have gotten together and blended our
 
mutual efforts in the first place.
 Politically we were divided,
 
and many a rehearsal was ended in rousing argument.  These
 
arguments were mild, though, in the days of the album, but
 
were to bloom to epic proportions during the two Cullen Hoot-
enannies which were to follow.  Yet, through it all, I belie:e
 
that we had a genuine feeling and respect for one another in
 
regards to individual abilities, and this was the key to
 
whatever success our endeavors enjoyed.
 This feeling is still
 
present today, at least on my part, and I suspect with the
 
others, and were the occasion to arise, I for one would welcome
 
nothing more than to be able to resume the activities of the
 
Tex-I-An Boys.
 I miss the arguments, the crisises, the stormy
 
rehearsals, the excitement of working out arrangements and
 
putting together the programs, and most of all I miss the music.
 
It is not often in this world that you are able to really put a
 
great deal of yourself into an activity you love; and though
 
the material rewards from our efforts were always slight, the
 
spiritual rewards were very, very rich.
 It was a warm, fine
 
experience.  The Tex-I-An Boys' album, the only tangible result
 
of our efforts, is a very pale record of it, at best.
 
We have heard about John Lomax's death.
 It is sad to see the
 
passing of an era.

Probably more boys have been connected with sales of the Saturday
 
Evening Post than any other publication.
 The advertisement above
 
speaks of one boy's enterprise as an inducement to others to join
 
their sales force, and is not concerned with the particular boy
 
except that he made a far better example for their purposes than
 
the average.
 
Taking the money to the bank to open his account posed a minor
 
logistics problem as this large sum was entirely in silver dollars.
 
Walking was considered, but why walk when you can ride, and John
 
owned a horse -
-
 well, half a horse.
 It was a real horse too and
 
and not a mule.
 Sister Shirley owned the other half.
 
They set out with Shirley "at the controls", John sitting behind
 
her, his shirt bloused out with the silver.
 This was the appro-
priate order too,  for ownership was not just a matter of holding
 
an equal number of shares of stock or some other abstract, but
 
sensibly physical.
 Shirley, due to seniority, got the front
 
half.
 Each owner was fully responsible for his or her part of
 
the property and, on this day, there was no problem in getting
 
the horse polished up as befitted the occasion.
 
This whole affair was viewed with some apprehension by the family.
 
Suppose the horse were to rear or bolt?  Suppose a seam should
 
split on John's shirt or someone rob them?  All went well though
 
and the money was safely banked.

John was on his way home by train and his coach was all but empty.
 
There was one pretty girl looking out of the window and, as there
 
was a choice of seats, he chose one near her.
 They got to talking
 
and it turned out that she too was from Texas although now living
 
in New York where she worked for the Servel Company.
 At that time,
 
the Servel Company was a French firm which manufactured gas appli-
ances of excellent quality.
 Although it was not her title, she
 
was pretty much in charge of their advertising.
 Very creative,
 
she wrote copy for their ads and had a hand in selecting where
 
they would appear and, of course, followed up the never-ending
 
loose ends involved in production of an ad.
 All of the company
 
executives were French and even she had a rather French-sounding
 
name.
 
John told her he was a Bank Examiner, which didn't make much of an
 
impression and remarked that he was on his way home to Austin.
 Her
 
response was that her only positive view of that place was that her
 
father always said that there was only one man at the University of
 
Texas worth his salt, John Avery Lomax.
 Her attitude suggested that
 
this young man had probably never even heard of such a person.
 
John drew himself up proudly and said, "My name is John Avery
 
Lomax, Jr.".
 
The young lady's name was Margaret Marable, called Mimi by her
 
family and friends.
 She eventually became Mrs. John Avery Lomax,
 
Jr.

On a long summer evening in 1962 I found a warm, new friend, John
 
A.  Lomax, Jr.
 I was, at the time, a young folk enthusiast, and I
 
had experienced little of the real depth of folksongs and folk-
lore.
 John quickly, by example, became my teacher,  for he was
 
truly a living portrait of American folk life.
 
As a boy, John's travels with his father taught him much about
 
life and about people.
 He was a compassionate man, filled with
 
love, understanding, and empathy for others.
 When he sang or
 
spoke, his words seemed to come to life.
 He knew hard work and
 
hard times personally.
 He also knew the joys and excitment of
 
life.
 With his words and songs, he could immediately bring each
 
of these emotions vividly to life.
 He was a master painter.
 
I am fortunate to have shared a brief walk through life with John
 
A.  Lomax, Jr.
 It is not often that we have such marvelous oppor-
tunities.
 I am thankful that John has been my true friend and
 
teacher,  and I shall miss him greatly.

ro m boyhood, f
irst-hand, the cowboy
 
songs and ballads of Texas and the Southwest.
 
Throughout h

he devoted the greater part of his unbelievable energies and t
