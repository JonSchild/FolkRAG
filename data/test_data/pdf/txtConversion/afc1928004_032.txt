I'm opposed to de bank, an do'nt like Biddle 
De wenches in de city dey all run arter me, 
Cause I 
lite on dere factions like a 
possom on a

But dey can't suck in die child, I 
do'nt know how

For nothing less than white gals eber cum to tea. 
I

souni, 
And I'm de high musician dey call Jim Brown 
De way I 
cum to play de fife and carry . 6

sword, 
I 
practised on de banjo sugar in de gourd, 
Da niggas dey all dance when I 
begin to play, 
Dey dance front de mornin to the close ob de day. 
I 
play upon de banjo in de country. 
I'm a 
clear grit nigga, from the elbow to de knee 
was born on Long Island, close to Oyster Bay. 
I 
work upon do farm for two shillings a 
day. 
But de genius oh die nigga was sure to be diskiver, 
'I jump aboard de sloop and cum down de ribber. 
I 
land at Fultla Market wid my music: in rny 
hand, 
Den .quick dey make die nigga de leader ob àe
