"Dear Mr. President", Austin, Texas, January or February 1942
AFS 6404B
Henry A. Dunn: This is Henry A. Dunn, superintendent of the main building on the campus at the
University of Texas. Dear Mr. President, when in Texas won't you please come see the University of
Austin? A beautiful campus of two hundred acres with forty-nine buildings, the greatest library in the
South, more rare books than any other state university in the nation. Students from every state in
the union, from practically all of the Latin American countries will smile and joke with you.
Our husky young men are going in great numbers to join the military forces. Our sons still have
the courage and spirit of the forces of the Texas revolution. To our age-old slogan “Remember the
Alamo,” we have now added the cry “Remember Pearl Harbor.” We are with you, one and all, until
the end for victory, then permanent peace.
