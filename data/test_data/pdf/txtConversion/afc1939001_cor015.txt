[Letter from Harold Spivacke to John A. Lomax; Port
Aransas, TX]
March 6, 1939
Mr. John A. Lomax Port Aransas, Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax:
The machine is not the only thing delaying your trip. I received the verbal approval of the
Librarian for your trip but he asked me to work out a detailed recommendation which will
take me several days. I sincerely hope though that we shall be able to get you started
toward the end of this month.
In addition to my usual rush at this time of the year, my wife's illness has also served to
slow me up. It won't be long now.
With kindest regards,
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
P.S. I received your previous letters with many enclosures but have not had time to read
them all as yet.
