PREFACE. 
IN 
defiance of the general custom of prefacing a 'song book 
with an autobiography ; I 
will simply say that I 
was born in the 
United States of America; and consider myself exceedingly for-
tunate to have been born at all, as people who are deprived al: 
that interesting event seldom make an impression in this world. 
In regard to my age, height, and general personal appearance, 
I 
am firmly convinced that it matters very little to the public 
what I 
resemble, if I 
am successful in my efforts to entertain 
them; and with many thanks for their kind appreciation of my 
talents, I 
remain the Public's humble and obedient servant, 
'TARRY I3ENNETT. 
•) 
I ASK consideration, friends, 
And I 
will let you know 
Why I'm saluted by the boys, 
Wherever I 
may go. 
I 
live in eighteen carat style, 
I 
drive a 
trotting mare, 
Smoke nor-de- Grasshopper cigars, 
And scent my curly hair. 
SPOKEN.—And wherever I 
go, Broadway or any other place, 
you'll hear everybody say there goes: 
Cnonus. 
Charley Flynn I 
Charley Flynn! 
Wears the latest style of collars; , 
Charley Flynn! Charley Flynn! 
I 
am worth ten thousand dollars. 
And when I'm out to walk, 
My shirt's as white as chalk; 
The gang say, " Clear the way I 
For there comes Charley Flynn!" ' 
I'm known in all the social clubs, 
I 
live on Zephyr stew, 
pivot on a 
three- cent piece, 
And lance the dancers, too, 
And oftentimes I 
make a 
speech— 
Of course on polities • 
And sometimes, when I 
say too much, 
I 
get a 
shower of bricks. 
SPOKEN.—I 
will never make another speech as long as I 
live. 
I 
made a 
few remarks, at I 
lard12,- Able Hall, the other night, 
and didn't have two words out of my mouth before some one 
yelled out, " Cut his legs off ! " 
The meeting broke up in a 
fight, 
and as I 
leaped through the door. they all cried: 
Charley Flynn I 
etc. 
_ 
LIVritten by T—T AUX BENNETT, and delivered with great succest 
at Yolks Theatre, Brooklyn. -
A YOUNG man to this city came, 
In walking he was slightly game, 
Patricius was his maiden name— 
McGinniss: 
The boys thy used to call him gimps, 
As on the street he'd slowly limp, 
They sold him Croton bugs for shrimp—k 
McGinnis& 
Taking a 
kind friend's gooa advice, 
He went and g*t a 
job so nice, 
In the undertaker's, cracking ice— 
At first the times were rather rough, 
But now he's doing well enough, 
For he can stand them—he is tough— 
McGinniss. 
Long live that good young man, say 
And when time comes for him to die, 
Free lunches one and all will cry— 
McGinnis. 
GEORGE MAGEE. 
I 
AM a 
man of distinction and learning, ye see, 
I 
am a 
thorough sport every time; 
I 
am the flower of fashion wherever I 
be; 
With the boys I've spent many a 
dime; 
I 
can play casino, I 
can live fast or slow, 
Whichever may suit me the best, 
And w 
henever I 
stop at a 
ball or a 
hop 
I 
have a 
gold watch in my vest, oh yes. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am George Magee, 
Tra in la lee; 
Just look at me, 
And you will see 
An Irishmag 
Of high degree; 
The ladies' pet, 
I'm George Magee. 
have a 
wink in my eye that does capture the girls, 
And my smiles they can never resist; 
My black Carolinas the barber he curls, 
And I 
have a 
gold ring on my fist, 
And everyone knows as they look at my clothes 
They're made of good stuff, firm and strong; 
As I 
walk on the street every damsel I 
meet 
Pipes my figure as I 
move along. 
I 
am George Magee)

CHESTERFIELD MoFLYNN. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT. 
ALTHOUGH I 
have no money, 
I'm just as sweet as honey; 
travel on my shape, because 
I'm neither stout nor thin; 
.The girls all say I'm pretty, 
And also wise and witty; 
There's not a 
masher in this town 
Like Chesterfield McFlynn. 
C
HORUS. 
By-bye, Charlie, you're a 
pot of mine; 
I'll meet you in the clock, 
When the lane strikes nine; 
I'll strike you with a 
gum drop, 
You giddy little lass; 
I'll sick you with my spitz dog, 
And I'll stab you with blue glass. 
At every evening party 
You'll find me there so hearty, 
I 
never step upon the floor 
Till dancing does begin; 
I 
dance in latest fashion, 
My appearance it is dashing; 
ghey can't resist the figure of 
Charles Chesterfield McFlynn. 
By-bye, Charlie, etc. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT. 
As sung by W ILLIAM PETER 
HOLY, " De Man Wid de Bassoon." 
I 
ONCE had a 
brother, the son of his mother, 
But somehow or other, ye see, 
Though he was a 
darling he always was snarling, 
With me could never agree; 
He'd hardly say twenty words in a 
day, 
If he thought he was going to be kilt, 
But his mouth he'd pucker like some big sucker, 
And this is the tune he would lilt, 
(Whistle with piccolo accompaniment.) 
My sweet brother, Teddy, he over was ready 
To whistle a 
tune at your call; 
Ho always was merry, his mouth like a 
cherry 
Played sweeter than pipes at a 
ball; 
Ho whistled his landlady out of her rent, 
He whistled his mother-in-law sick, 
Till some big Italian, the dirty rapscallion, 
Knocked out Teddy's teeth with a 
brick. 
HAPPY LITTLE CHILDREN FROM THE 
SOUTH. 
CHORUS. 
Words by HARRY 13ENNETT. 
Music by BILLY CARTER. 
Sung by FOLEY & SIIEFFER. 
KEEP your eyes on us Children from de South, we're 
Merry as de little birds a- singing in de tree; 
liar so tight da.t we nebber shut our mouf, and 
Always just as happy as can be, 
D'incing, laughing, jumping all do day, 
Music makes us foolish as a 
chicken in de hay, 
Singing, shouting to pass de time away, we're 
Happy little children from de South. 
Dancing, singing, shouting all de time, 
Niggers, just as crazy as a 
kitten in do lime ; 
When we dance why nebber lose de time, we're 
Happy little children from de South. 
Ann Eliza and Thomas is our names, we 
Learned to dance and sing when we were little picanins, 
We take de cake when we git upon do floor, we're 
Cousins to de Orange Blossom Twins. 
When de coons dey give a 
fancy ball, 
Dey watch us darkeys as we walk around de hall; 
Dancing, singing we can beat dem all, us 
Happy little children from de South. 
Dancing, singing, shouting, etc. 
I'm going to sing of pretty little girl, I 
Met while out a 
walking in the park one afternoon. 
She wore an alapaca paper muslin bombazine, she 
Was light and airy as a 
big baloon. 
I 
tipped her the wink, and we soon began to chin, 
I 
said I 
was a 
Frenchman, and she said it was too thin; 
She'd a 
fine big nose painted red by Holland gin, 
This little girl I 
met one afternoon. 
CHORUS.

Frenchman, and she said it was too thin; 
She'd a 
fine big nose painted red by Holland gin, 
This little girl I 
met one afternoon. 
We walked and talked in a 
quiet sort of way; I 
Said, " We'll find a 
beer saloon and have a 
little ball ; " 
She said, " All right," and we went into the place, but 
I 
wished I 
hadn't gone in there at all, 
For a 
big six-foot man came leaping in the door— 
He hit me such a 
welt that I 
went sprawling on the floor; 
He said, " She's my wife, and you knew it well before! " 
The little girl I 
met one afternoon. 
I 
tipped her the wink, etc.

OF all the groat inventions known, 
The greatest of the age, 
Is the new invention, the Telephone, 
It's going to be the rage. 
You can sing, and talk, and whisper too, 
Or even music play, 
And hear it through the Telephone, 
For miles and miles away. 
Ciroitus. 
It's a 
big invention since your born, 
The greatest ever known. 
You can sing, and talk for miles and. miles,. 
Through the wonderful Telephone. 
Friends who now are far apart, 
Can hold an interview. 
Tony Pastor can sing in New York, 
And be heard in Kalamazoo. 
You can't swap kisses with your gal, 
Though it's wonderful what it does, 
Now lovers through the Telephone, 
Can have a 
private buzz. 
It's a

You can ask a 
friend that's tar away, 
With a 
nerve for a 
hundred or so, 
And have the pleasure of hearing him 
Through the Telephone, no sir; no. 
And through this new invention sure, 
Your going to see the day, 
You can give your mother-in-law a 
fight, 
Ton thousand miles away,

THE flags are flying gayly, 
The marshal's in command, 
The streets with people now are lined, 
The turn-out will be grand; 
From the windows high they're shouting, 
"

To see the MacMahon Grenadiers 
March out in fine array.

For the MacMahon Grenadiers. 
Our colonel's name's MacMahon, 
Our captain is O'Hale, 
If they should call on us to fight, 
You bot we nc'er will fail; 
We are not one of the home guards 
Who never fight but run, 
But solid soldiers to the front 
You'll find the MacMahons. 
Yes, a

We are the ladies' favorites 
When we go on parade, 
With stars and stripes and green flag flying, 
Oh may their colors never fade

To fight for our homes so dear; 
We'll be the first men on the field— 
The Mae -

As through the streets we march,

And the love for Ireland 
Will never more be tarnished 
By tho MacMahon Grenadiers.

Two Irish Aldermen are we, 
Our education it is fine;

As orators we both do shine; 
Solid democrats are we, 
Working for the people's cause, 
Selected for our elegance 
To regulate the city laws.

Through the city and State;

To keep the flies out of the gate; 
Our wardrobe is fastidious, 
Cut out in the latest style, 
We captivate the ladies, and they always 
Greet us with a

Words and Music by Bossy NEWCOMB.

No. 50 West 4th Street, Cincinnati, Ohio, can be 
obtained at any Music Store. 
Price, 40 cents. 
On ! fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there cOmbined, 
And brightest hues so fair— 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot: 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
Oh! you'll forget me not! " 
CHORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly—for, of her I 
am so fond— 
Dasies and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You'll forget me not! " 
We met—I 
really don't know where— 
But still ' tis all the same— 
For love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A 
sweet forget-me-
not 1 
(Dance.) 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur " yes I" 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A 
sweet forget-me-not I

Be Herrings 
If I

The workingmen's rights I'll protect!

An Address to an Old Wooden Pipe. 
Sung by M ILES M ORRIS. 
SO, they say you'r a 
villain old friend, 
That you rob me of sleep and of sense, 
To ruin my strength that you tend, 
And walk off with my hardly earn'd pence. 
That you lead to late hours and had ways, 
And encourage a 
taste for strong drink, 
One friend in particular says, 
Without hesitation you stink! 
That you are not a 
beauty I 
fear, 
An old blackened tube at the best ; 
Your odor—decidedly queer, 
And you'r seldom if ever at rest. 
I 
do take a 
glass when I 
smoke, 
Especially after I've dined; 
And my friends are most welcome to croak 
if it any-way eases their mind. 
I 
think I 
with safety may state 
That you have cost me fourpence a 
day; 
That I 
sometimes have sat up too late 
And smoked you whilst losing at play, 
Still those fourpenee I 
well can afford, 
They make no great hole in my purse; 
And I 
really don't think, on my word, 
That the smoke made play any wore,. 
Of one thing I'm perfectly sure, 
If my temper should follow my pelf, 
My friends from bad words are secure 
For I 
take it all out on yourself. 
I 
gnaw at your dirty old stem, 
And I 
shut myself in with a 
cloud, 
And until I've recovered my phlegm 
I 
do not ° merge from my shroud. 
You help me bear sorrow and pain, 
You smooth the rough journey of life 
You stand by me in sunshine and rain 
And you keep me from anger and strife 
The longest song must have an end, 
Mine has with this simple recipe; 
If you want to keep terms with a 
friend 
Don't endeavor to put out his pipe. 
APPLES AND PEANUTS. 
Written expressly for THE M URRAN'S, En. and ALMS. 
Pray listen awhile to my song— 
I 
promise to not keep you long; 
I'm from Erin, you all plainly see, 
Just come to this land of the free. 
When I 
think of the friends that I 
left in old Ireland, 
They'll have brighter days soon, so they tell— 
But, dear friends, while I 
wait, just please understand 
That I've apples and peanuts to sell. 
CIIORUS. 
Oh, apples here, apples here ! is my cry, 
Nice sweet apples here, now some one buy; 
You hear me all day long, night time as well, 
For I've apples and peanuts to sell. 
There's many things here I 
don't like— 
They'll hang a 
man now just for spite ; 
All the women are wanting to vote, 
And for offices hundreds have wrote. 
I 
think they'll succeed when Grant stops a- smoking, 
Or when Tweed from rascality's fell. 
I 
think the whole gang deserve a 
good choking, 
But I've apples and peanuts to sell. 
Oh, apples here, &e. 
But, dear friends, I 
must bid you good-by, 
I've a 
hundred, and gold is up high. 
It's married I 
soon nope to be 
To a 
lad that's now crossing the sea. 
Oh, how happy I'll be along with my Barney, 
In our little cot down in the dell— 
I'll bother my dear friends no more with my blarney 
Of apples and peanuts to sell. 
Oh, apples here, &c.

Written and sung by II Auftv BENNETT, 
After eating pigs- feet late at night. 
THE other night, while feeling bright. 
I 
though I'd have a 
racket ; 
The thought itseli was -, 00d enough, 
But I'd no stamps to back it. 
I 
went to take a 
two-cent sail, 
To keep my spirits merry, 
But now I 
wish that I 
had died 
Before I 
crossed the ferry. 
CHORUS. 
With lively boys and witching girls, 
I 
tell you it was merry ; 
I 
never shall forget that night 
A-crossing on the ferry. 
I 
paid my fare and jumped aboard_ 
The weather it was breez -
 ; 
I 
didn't care for wind or rain, 
For I 
am free and easy; 
And I 
began to think and think 
About Beecher and Frank Moulton, 
Whom all at one(' I 
Ht a 
Lank, 
And then a 
fearful Jul 1
,1Lf. 
With lively boys, 41-
,c. 
I 
felt a 
crash, and up I 
Jumped, 
There was a 
fearful clatter; 
I 
looked about, and then went out 
To see what was the matter. 
A 
gal was yelling murder, and 
She was a 
fearful screecher— 
I 
saw a 
man fall overboard, 
She said that it was Beecher: 
Chorus.— With lively boys, 44. 
Then overboard I 
quickly jumped, 
To try and save the preacher, 
Because I 
though it would be great 
To rescue Henry Beecher; 
But when I 
struck the water, oh! 
You et it set me screaming; 
I 
found that I 
had been asleep, 
And jumped overboard while dreaming. 
Chorus.— With lively boys, Art, 
THE FLANNEL-MOUTH MICK, 
Written by W ILLIAM W ELCH. 
As sung by JOHNNY KENNELL. 
I KNOW you'll have pity 
When you hear what I 
say— 
The way I 
have been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand on the corners, 
As I 
pass them by, 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Armh, " stag the old guy." 
Cnourrs. 
Oh, they yell out, " You terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick l" 
They call me a 
chow and 
A 
flannel-mouth mick. 
The other day while a-walking 
1 
went down the street, 
A 
charming young damsel 
By chance I 
did meet. 
Says 1, " You look charming, 
Ah, cushla, ma vick;" 
Says she, " Drop on yourself, 
You flannel-mouth mick." 
Oh, they yell out, etc, 
When OW;C..-..- s.tr.4 CODICQ,

" 
How are you. Mr. McGuinness,

MY 1Lanc, 
is John McSorley, in this city I 
resido, 
reftred 
son to manhood, and he was my joy and pride; 
But now play- actors and such tr:-vdi do all his time engage. 
He's off his nut entirely since he whit upon the stage. 
CHORUS. 
Ho. 
wears long shoes and stroked socks, 
And he says they're all the rage; 
My carpet's tore, and my house is in a 
roar, 
Since James wint on the stage. 
He throws his feet up high, because he thinks it is the style, 
He broke my chandelier last night, and filled my clothes with 
oil, 
He says he'll make a 
terrible hit, and tells me he's immense, 
And he took the ould woman's petticoat to play the nagur-
winch, 
Ho wears long shoes and stroked socks, &c. 
He has my hat and coat all spoiled, and everything is broke, 
his foot whit throtizh the floor whin trying to dance the lively 
moke, 
He sings " Tn,, ta," and ‘• Tra-la-la-le," just like a 
bird in a 
cage, 
And has me nearly crazy since he wint upon the stage. 
He wears long shoes and stroked .socks, &c. 
AS I 
sat in my easy chair last night, 
Watching the tire's flickering light, 
I 
thought, in a 
sort of half dreamy way, 
Of things that are happening every day. 
And soon , fell into a 
quiet doze, 
When before my e3 es a 
strange vision arose— 
I 
thought that the great Centennial was here, 
And the people I 
saw were very queer; 
First Moody and Sankey appeared on the scene, 
With clogs on their feet, and suits of bright green; 
They danced a 
hornpipe, and tumbled about, 
'Till Moody gave up with a 
twinge of the gout, 
..,
;ext, Ward Beecher in my dream took a 
part, 
And turned six somersaults over John Hart; 
Then President Grant went on the trapeze, 
Turned eighteen flip-flaps, and fell on his knees; 
Billy Courtwright rode on a 
half-starved nag, 
Giving .mt tracks from his old ‘• Flewy" bag. 
Brother >human stood, with a 
tearful eye. 
Imploring Moulton to treat to old rye. 
Bill Allen 
is old " rag baby" did bring, 
And with Vicky Woodhull he danced a 
fling; 
Oft 
one side was Butler the " spooney," 
Dancing 1, reel with little Pat Rooney. 
Kernell came In on a 
terrible spree, 
And told John liart " not to give it a 
wee." 
Then Big Six came in— the once famous " Boss"— 
And sang a 
duet with young Charley Ross. 
Sweet Susan Anthony stood on the floor, 
And wit; her jokes kept the house hi a 
roar. 
Tony Pas or sang " Ta, ta Baby Deal," 
And Tennie C. Chan walked in on her ear. 
The ghost of Tom Collins appeared in white, 
And went ' round the room looking for tight. 
John Raymond raw turnips gave to the hand, 
While Scanlon and Cronin stood " Hand in Ham! 
Sam Rickey was there, with " John Wild's Old Man;" 
Barry kept time with his " Alabazan." 
Allen was " Schneider" than ever before, 
And John Thompson was " On Hand" at the door. 
Harrigan and hart dressed in " Blue and Gray," 
And evidently both had been " Led Astray." 
Sam Sanford was seated on a 
high throne, 
And played " Little Sw etheart" on the jawbone. 
Dick Carroll danced till he quite lost his mind, 
And dared Gus Williams to " Pull Down the Blind," 
George Knight made love to Hongler's " Sweet Aleen," 
And Ad. Hyman tried to eat a 
whole scene. 
They kept up their frolic an hour or more, 
Whon, to my surprise, I 
hearth a 
great roar. 
The floor gave way, and they all tumbled in, 
Filling the air with a 
terrible din. 
I 
jumped irom my chair with a 
fearful scream, 
And found I'd had a 
Centennial Dream.

SITTING IN THE TWILIGHT.,. 
Words and Music by IIA auy BENNETT. 
AS 
sung by BILLY 
WILSoti. 
THE brightness of the day had scarcely vanished, 
The sun was slowly sinking from my view, 
When strolling in the stillness of the twilight, 
'Twas just by chance I 
saw my darling Lou, 
She sat upon the moss beside a 
brooklet, 
Her pretty dimpled cheeks were all aglow, 
When I 
broke the spell by whispering to her softly, 
Your thoughts, my darling I 
should like to know, 
CHORUS. 
In the twilight she was sitting—[ Break.) 
Through the trees the birds were flitting—[ Break.] 
Affection from her pretty eyes was beaming, 
Those charming orbs of heaven's deepest blue; 
And while my heart with happiness was teaming, 
I 
vowed I'd e'er be loving, kind and true. 
My heart was filled with joy when I 
espied her, 
For it was my intention to propose; 
I 
sat upon the mossy bank beside her, 
And in her hair I 
placed a 
blushing rose, 
She thanked me with a 
voice so low and mellow, 
My soul was thrilled with rapture by its tone; 
I 
thought myself a 
very lucky fellow, 
When she told me her heart was all my own. 
Chorus.—In the twilight, (to 
OLD RECOLLECTIONS. 
FAR back in the sweet past my mem'ry's oft wandered, 
To the spot that I 
loved neath the oil shady trees; 
Where oft with my books o'er quaint stories I've pondered, 
Or to dream-land was wafted by mid-summer's breeze. 
I 
recall with a 
sigh the bright days of my childhood, 
When ' neath the old trees with my comrades I 
strayed, 
And heard the birds singing sweet songs in the wild-wood, 
Or watched the bright brook as it flowed throug;1 the glade 
But, all! the bright days of my boyhood are fleeting, 
The faces of (tear ones are passing away; 
It makes my heart sad when I 
think of our meeting 
'Neath the old shady trees, every bright summer day. 
Long years have gone by, and my comrades have left me, 
Their voices no longer are heard in the glade; 
But I 
see the old trees that I 
loved in my childhood, 
With their wide-spreading branc.hes, and welcoming shade, 
As I 
pause by the brooklet, old menfry's steal o'er me, 
My heart it grows sad—the hot tears will not stay; 
For the many dear friends that I . oved in my boy-hood. 
Are gone from my sight, and are passing away. 
Chorus.—But _ oh!,

As Bung by HARRY KERNELL. 
(AIR— Old Song.) 
I'VE a 
daughter who's surely gone crazy, 
It is a 
hard thing, I 
declare; 
She's now a 
theatrical lady, 
And wears a 
wig over her hair. 
She says " Wilt thou meet me by moonlight? 
My heart's blood I 
would lose for thee !" 
She strikes attitudes in the kitchen, 
And kisses her fingers at me, 
CHORUS. 
In the day time she's Mary McGinness, 
And employs all her time washing clothes, 
But at night on the stage she's a 
countess, 
And they call her the " Lady Montrose," 
Shure, the wash- tub she calls it a 
castle, 
The soap is a 
dagger so keen, 
'lie coal-box she calls it a 
grotto 
Such goings on I've Diver seen, 
37 
She stabs herself with a 
potato, 
And says "' Tis for thee, love, I 
die I" 
On the ceiling she has a 
tomato, 
And calls it the moon in the sky. 
In the day time she's Mary McGinniss, ttc. 
She tolls me she'll be a 
great actress, 
Admirers she'll have by the score, 
She'll be courted by dukes, kings and princes, 
And the divel knows how many more. 
She uses my hat for a 
casket, 
For jewels she fills it with coal ; 
For a 
carriage she has the clothes-basket, 
And the clothes-pins are silver and gold. 
In the day-time she's Mary MeGinniss, Le.

NO doubt you've seen the ballet girls, 
Who dress so trim and neat, 
With pretty satin slippers on 
Their tiny, little feet ; 
They float around like fairies in 
The light and airy dance; 
But we can please you better if 
You'll just give us a 
chance. 
CHORUS. 
We are cAnets fro:n the West—[ Break.] 
And our dancing is the best—[Breaki 
We are very fond of music, and 
We love to sing and dance; 
In fact, we'll quite surprise you if 
You'll just give us a 
chance. 
Our daddy used to teach us how 
To shuffle with our feet; 
And when he played the banjo, why, 
The music was so sweet 
That we could not keep quiet. and 
That's how we learned to dance ; 
And now we'll try to please you if 
You'll just give us a 
chance.

That Girl in the Skipping Rope Dance. 
Respectfully dedicated to John Pendy, by HARRY BENNETT. 
FOR pleasure one evening I 
started, 
Just after my day's work was done; 
For sometimes I 
feel quite down hearted, 
And longed for a 
night of good fun. 
I 
visited several places, 
I 
saw the great cancan from France, 
But my heart was charmed with the graces 
Of a 
girl in a 
skipping rope dance. 
CHORUS. 
For bewitchingly charming and fair was she 
As round the sta2:e she'd gayly prance; 
Oh ! she was the darling that pulverized mr 
With her beautiful skipping-rope dance. 
I 
quickly obtained an acquaintance— 
Of course, took her out for a 
ride; 
I 
tilled her with champagne an 
oysters, 
And asked her if she'd be my bride. 
Alas that my hopes should be shattered ! 
It pierced my poor lietrt ii e 
a 
lance— 
She was married, and had se; en children, 
Tnat girl in the skippin:r-rope dance! 
Chorus.—Fur bewitchingly, ,te„, 
BARNEY THE BOLD. 
Written for BARNEY W ILLIAMS, BY Mn. GUEST. 
Should the mind be over- burdened with sorrows or care, 
Should Fortune betray us, or Friendship turn cold, 
What can turn into laughter the groans of despair, 
Like the wit and and the jestures of Barney the bold; 
With his toe and his heel, and a 
twirl of his stick, 
He'll bate the blue devils at once to ould nick! 
Oh Comedy laughs in each glance of his eye, 
And his brogue it is sweeter than mountains poteen I 
To match him for humor, in vain ye may try, 
Whilst night follows morning, and noon conies between P 
And " Barney, bold Barney," cry thousands with joy, 
" 
Is the raal spalpane, is our own Irish boy! " 
Come watch him, ye actors, come one and come all! 
How dull is your IA lt, and heavy your heels, 
Your efforts are great, but your acting is small, 
And Barney's the boy, all your humbug reveals! 
In the wide world he has not equal in that, 
For Paddy is Barney, and Barney is Pat!

Barney, the Tight Lad of Derry. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
OH! Barney, sweet Barney, was blithesome and merry; 
We met, where the wild thistle grew: 
His cheek and his lips were as red, as a 
cherry, 
his eye, like his jacket, was blue: 
And he yowl!, that I 
look'd like an angel above, 
And his tongue coax'd so swately, I 
tumbled in love, 
Wid Barney, the tight lad of Derry, 
Oh! Barney, the tight lad of Derry! 
But 0! the desaver, he set my heart bating, 
Then whisper'd, " Dear Bridget, good bye! 
'Deed ! the times are so bad, that abroad I'm retreating, 
My fortune, far off, for to try:" 
And he kiss'd me, and told me to banish my fears, 
I 
spoke not, but moisten'd the cheek, wid my tears, 
Of Barney, the tight lad of Derry. 
Ohl Barney, the tight lad of Derry I 
Long years have pass'd by, since I 
parted with Barney, 
And sadly I 
watch ev'ry day; 
And lovers, come coorting, so brimful of blarney, 
But my love is wid him, far away: 
And should he come back with his heart left behind, 
lie shan't see me weep, for I 
still will be kind, 
To Barney, the tight lad of' Derry. 
Oh i 
Barn', the tight lad of Derry!

My name is not Smith, nor Brown, nor Jones,

And as for my address—p'raps some 
Would much like that to find; 
Some dads leave houses to their sons, 
Mine ne'er left me a

And so, just like my watch, by Jove, 
I 
always go on " tick."

Who's got more cash than brain, 
And while he's got a 
Fiver left, 
With him will I 
remain. 
SroKEN,--I'll never desert a 
friend— while he's a 
Fiver left, 
Eat his dinners for him, ride his horse for him, go for a

Strucx up " Rigs o' Barley." 
Donald was a

But music was not in him : 
Bagpipes always drove Lila mad ; 
The piper could not win him. 
But alack ! one summer day 
He cross'd Loch Leven's water ; 
And he met upon his way, 
The piper and his daughter. 
Donald look'd, and Donald saw

The old man play'd, yet Donald stay'd, 
Each moment seeming shorter ; 
The piper's drone had ehang'd its tone 
Beside the piper's daughter. 
Alack! alas ! it came to pass 
That Donald cross'd Loch Leven 
As often, and as willingly, 
As though it lead to Heaven 
A 
wondrous change came o'er his mind, 
Ho thought the bagpipes pleasant; 
But then the piper he was blind, 
And those gray eyes were present. 
Donald loved the old man's child, 
With golden ling he sought her. 
And took the pipes and piper home, 
As well as piper's daughter,

THE FREE-LUNCH BRIGADE, 
Vritten by BEN DODGE. 
Sung by JAS. D. 
ROOME. 
Some fellows think it s 
fun to go 
Out " bumming " every night, 
With a 
gang of thoroughbreds 
Who are certain to get tight; 
While others take their " tods " at home, 
To " bum" 'round they're afraid, 
But you'll not find that kind of men 
In our Free-Lunch Brigade. 
Cuouus. 
As we go out on a 
raid, 
The groat Free-Lunch Brigade, 
Where is the bar, we'd like to know, 
At which the lunch is laid. 
We'll tackle it with joy, 
And give a 
loud hurrah, 
For the man with nerve to set it up 
For the great Free-Lunch Brigade. 
We're always ready for the lunch, 
No matter where we find it, 
And if it proves a 
trifle " queer," 
Of course we never mind it. 
Clam chowder we will never slight, 
We care not how it 's 
made; 
Bean soup and slaw are " great graft" to 
Our noble Lunch Brigade. 
As we go out, & c. 
Raw onions and smoked herrings are 
To us a 
pleasant treat; 
Bologno sausage, or crackers and cheese, 
We're not too proud to eat. 
There's " Appetite Bill" and " -Hungry Jake," 
Biggest eaters ever made, 
Are always in the front ranks of 
The great Free-Lunch Brigade.

THE IRISH POLICEMAN. 
WHEN first I 
came to Dublin, a 
policeman's place I 
took, 
A 
silver watch I 
soon possessed, and the right side of the cook, 
I 
looked so well in uniform, that girls both tall and fair, 
No matter whether right or wrong on me their eyes would 
glare. 
Now I 
was never cross, my boys, when asked to have a 
drink, 
By swells who made a 
little noise, if the silver I 
heard chink, 
And if they wouldn't stand a 
joke, I'd stand none of their 
cheek, 
pa let them know I've been in town, much longer than a 
week, 
One night while eating chicken pie, at my Susie's on the square, 
A 
triple knock came at the door, which knocked me off the 
chair, 
'Twas her misses, I 
heard her say, what thief have you below, 
Susie explained in a 
pitiful tone, it's only my cousin Joe. 
JOLLY IRISHMEN) 
COME all you roving Irish boys, 
Sure we have just landed, 
We 
just came from Ireland, 
Where the boys are all undaunted 
We all can dance and all can sing, 
And drink our whiskey gaily, 
And wear our little shamrock green 
With a 
splinter of shillelahs. 
Them jolly Irishmen, 
Them jolly Irishmen; 
No king or queen had ought to rule, 
Them jolly IriAmeil„ 
Them jolly Irishmen, 
Them jolly Irishmen, 
For the stars and stripes they all will fight, 
Them jolly Irishmen. 
fiwas in the town of Ireland, 
Where praties grow so thick, 
Sure I 
never saw an Irish boy, 
But what could twirl a 
st ick. 
So God be with ould Ireland, 
Where Irishmen were born, 
Oh many a 
day I 
spilt that way, 
With my sweet Colleen Bawn.

THE KILKENNY BOY. 
I 
WENT to school to Darby Took, who'd been a 
soldier I've 
been told. 
His talk of wars and drums and scars came over me when 
nine years old; 
Then I 
took to drums instead of sums, shillelah being my 
writing pen, 
My only books being outside crooks, my only joy being 
fighting men. 
Disdaining brogues, I 
crossed the bogs, with heart as light 
as any boy, 
The girls would cry when me they'd spy, " Sure there's Larry 
Moore the Irish Boy!" 
CHORUS, 
Oh ! the nice, the:neat, t),e 
tall, complete, 
The handsome, fine Kilkenny boy. 
When older grown, the girls—och hone !— about their hearts 
they twisted me, 
Till Sergeant Shay, he came one.day, and with a 
shilling he 
listed me ; 
Then Kitty Burn she left her churn, saying, "Och 
youvo 
been deceiving me." 
And Kate O'Neil—faith I'll go bail—will break her heart for 
leaving me. 
So, in this plight, a 
soldier tight, I 
marched as fine as any boy 
The fair to melt, the to pelt, none equalled the Kilkenny boy. 
Oh ! the nice, the neat, & c. 
But Sergeant Shay he died one day, a 
bullet laid him on the 
floor, 
That same polthlgue that stopped his brogue a 
sergeant made 
of Larry Moore ; 
And when the peace bid fighting cease, of girls—och hone— 
I 
had a 
few 
Who tried to tease, but none could please like the charming 
widow Donoghue. 
It is herself that has the pelf, it is myself can spend it with 
Joy, 
She cried "Och hone! you're all my own, my darling, fig 
Kilkenny boy." 
Oh 1 
the nice, the neat, /cc. 
OH, Limerick is beautiful, as everybody knows, 
The river Shannon, full of fish, beside that city flows, 
'Tis not the river, nor the fish, that weighs upon my maw., 
Or with the town of Limerick have I 
any fault to find. 
Oh, the girl I 
love is beautiful, as fair-eyed as the fawn; 
She lives in Garryowen, and is called the Colleen Bawr_. 
And proudly as that river flows beside that blesseo city ; 
More prouder still, without a 
doubt, the Colleen goes by me. 
C HORUS.

Oh, It I 
was the Emperor of Russia to command, 
Or Julius Ceasar, or the Lord Lieutenant of the land, 
I'd give my gold, my silver plate, likewise my army, 
The Horse-guards, the Rifles and the Royal Artillery; 
I'd give the crown from off my bead, my people on their knoft 
I'd give my fleet of sailing ships upon the briny seas, 
A 
beggar I 
would go to bed, to rise at early dawn, 
If by my side just as a 
bride, I'd find my Colleen Ilawn.

Maccabes's Excursion Train. 
OR, THE TRIALS OF A 
RAILWAY PORTER, 
—" King of the Canibal Islands.' 
Ever since the world began, 
There never was, nor ever can 
Be found such a 
very useful man 
As a 
railway porter. 
He carries your luggage civilly, 
And never expects to get a 
fee. 
Though his hand will close quite readily 
If you slip in a 
small gratuity. 
When friends are on the platform parting, 
He rings the bell when it's time for starting, 
And the last man you see, as away you're darting, 
Is the railway porter. 
VENTRILOQUIAL CONVERSATION WITH THE PASSENGERS • 
Starting the Train—Right! —Train off—Incidents of Ra*,. 
way Travel —Pleasant and Unpleasant Fellow-passengen — 
Arrival at Station—Pull Up. 
And when the train is pulling up, 
At a 
station on the line to stop, 
And the passengers want to know how far 
They've come, and wonder where they are ; 
The porter shouts the name of the station, 
But you only hear the termination, 
So on that point you never get information 
From the railway porter

OWEN REILLY. 
Sung by JOHN SHEEHAN. 
Oh, my name is Owen Reilly, 
I've got a 
son that's got me crazy, 
lie comes home every night wid his blackguard songs, 
le said he learned them up at some free and aisy: 
lie wanted his mother for to put on the boxing gloves wid him 
He broke his little brother's leg wid a 
poker, 
lie have an old deck of cards, and he wants me to play 
Pedro, Sancho, Seven-up and the Joker. 
lie says he's taking sparring lessons from Professor John 
Donovan, 
He bate the oldest boy of cross-eyed McGarrity, 
Ile goes prancing around all the dances of the city, 
And he have a 
girl who do be dancing at the vulgarities. 
Oh, he pawned me Sunday pants last week, 
To go and lay a 
wager, 
And he brought me down the street that night, 
For to light a 
big black nagur ; 
There's his cousin Mike, a 
nice young man, 
Wid the fittest kind of manners, 
Night after night they roamed about, 
And they called it carrying the banners. 
But the two of them got in a 
scrape, 
They stole a 
Dutchman's pony, 
Poor Mike is in the workhouse now, 
And Bernard's in Aronagonia. 
Oh, he tied a 
can to our dog's tail, 
When we'd gone to church last Sunday, 
lie got stiff staving tight, and stayed out that night, 
And he was up before the judge in the morning; 
lie have the house turned inside out, 
lie's gone to the bad intirely, 
Be heavens I 
fear that he'll be hung, 
God help you, Bernard Reilly. 
lie kicked his sister, Honorah in the forehead last week, 
lie wanted custard pie for his slipper; 
And he came home wid himself stuffed wid boiled oyster stews.. 
And threw the corn beef and cabbage in the gutter.

Where ivy-crowned ruin and battle-torn town.

She wanders, her cares on the needy conferring ; 
Their blessings attend her night, morning and noon. 
An angel of mercy is Rosa Muldoon!

George Barnwell!, THE MERCHANT'S CIER31.—This is an 
extremely sensational sketch, but shows Truth stranger than Fiction. 
This deluded victim went from crime to crime with a 
fearful rapidity, 
urged by the baneful influences of women lost to honor. He realized 
every moment the evils of his course, but, like a 
bird fluttering over the 
basilisk eye of the serpent, he went down, down, into the vortex of ruin 
and despair. 
This book teaches, in the strongest way, the moral lesson 
of resisting that temptation, which comes arrayed like an " angel of 
light"—beautiful to the eye, and blasting to the soul.. • • Price 25 Cents.
