Meeting at "the Lodge" with John Sinton, Barry Brady, Rita 
Moonsammy, and Mary-Ann Thompson, plus the "core" members of the 
field team, 16 September. (Logged 17 September.) 
Notes consist of general 
impressions of possibly important 
stuff jotted down during meeting. 
(My area, 
i.e., area 4, consists of separate north and south 
sections. 
These I'll designate, 
if necessary, as N4 and S4.) 
NE section of N4 has cedar-cutting inland used for pilings and 
docks on the bay. 
City of Cape May (outside of my area, south of S4) 
is the area's 
major deep water fishing port. 
The major center of commercial clamming is Barnegat Bay, but 
there is at least some small-scale clamming all 
along the 
Atlantic Coast of NJ. 
Oystering centers are around Great Bay 
area and Delaware Bay. 
Small-scale crabbing occurs all 
along the 
coast. 
All turtling is concerned with snappers (Chelydra 
serpentina.) 
Turtling is spread out all over the area, but 
especially near the interface with salt water. 
Bob Suralik 
[pron., sir-aw'lik] 
in Tuckerton has a small museum of maritime 
stuff. 
He's a schoolteacher, but he mussels and crabs. 
He's a 
contact-person for an old-timer clammer named Jeff Allen. 
Also check the Noyes Museum Cpron., noise] on Rte. 9, near 
Brigantine Wildlife Museum. 
Old, but still profitable farms are 
adjacent to the W. 
coast of Cape May. 
The Coxes and the 
Campbells along Delaware Bay are harvesters of salt-hay. 
(This 
is not actually planted, but it 
is "farmed" by controlling 
its 
growth and that of competing vegetation.) 
There is a salt-hay-
ropemaker nearby on Delaware Bay. 
Albert Reeves is a "pusher" that is, a guide for railbird-
hunters, so-called because "pushing" is the method of propelling 
boat by means of a pole. 
There is also at least one person in 
area who makes the poles used for this purpose. 
"Rail-running," 
i.e., rail-hunting is pursued on the Manumuskin, which is Reeves' 
area of operation. 
There are two species of rail, one that 
prefers fresh water and one that prefers brackish water. 
There is still shipbuilding on the Maurice R. and tributaries. 
Look for people who can make garveys (throughout area) and 
sneakboxes (in Barnegat Bay area).

At about 4:30 pm, I drove down Rte. 72 to Tuckerton and 
Tuckerton Harbor. 
While there, I found considerable evidence of 
clamming G-Tuckerton; 44GT throughout the area. 
There were many 
stands offering clams for sale. 
One marina had a huge sign 
offering commercial clam-rakes G-Tuckerton; 44GT for sale. 
Area 
marinas had many wooden garveys,G-Tuckerton; 44GT usually about 18 
or 20 feet long. 
Surprisingly enough, the majority of the 
garveys seemed to be made of planking, rather than plywood (as 
was the case on Staten Island 
in Lower New York Bay). 
Many of 
them had small pilot houses G-Tuckerton; 44GT aft. 
Most of the 
garveys were outboard-mounted, but surprisingly many had large 
enclosed inboards. G-Tuckerton; 44GT 
One marina had a considerable 
number of pilot-house-mounted garveys for rent, so I can assume 
that clamming 
G-Tuckerton; 44GT is also a tourist activity. 
I 
photographed one elaborate, seemingly well-made one that was on 
shore . 
I also photographed some general harbor scenes, and a set of 
elaborate birdhouses 
G-Tuckerton; 44GT (presumably martin-houses 
G-Tuckerton; 44GT ), 
one of which was a copy of Barnegat Light, and 
the others were more or less models of the birdhouse owner's 
house and several neighboring houses. 
I also photographed a boarded-up building, right on the beach 
which displayed a large white cross, and was presumably once a 
church G-Tuckerton; 44GT 
or camp-meeting 
G-Tuckerton; 44GT place. 
Architecture in the area seems typically resort/box-like, and set 
close together on narrow development streets. 
I also 
photographed Hayes' Marina, on Rte. 539. 
It 
is owned by Pistol & 
Judy Goheen, 
and sells, according to the sign, 
live minnows, 
large Jersey squid, 
live bait & tackle, and commercial clam-rakes 
G-Tuckerton; 
44GT in addition to providing boat-slips, forklift 
services, and boat-hauling. After sunset (about 7:30), I drove 
home through two terrible rainstorms.

This afternoon I drove down Rte. 72, and turned off to 
Chatsworth, but headed on out to the shore. 
Went through Mana 
hawkin, Beach Haven West, 
a bridge and causeway over the 
Manahawkin Bay, Ship Bottom, Frazier Park, and Harvey Cedars, 
G—Stafford; 53GT; G—Long Beach; 50GT; and G—Union; 56GT which con— 
tinue 
on through several other communities all 
the way to Barnegat 
Light State Park as one continuous strip. 
It 
is a heavily, I'd 
say, extremely 
thickly developed area full of condos perched 
precariously on an unstable landscape. 
Retirees and young "up 
wardly mobiles" seem to predominate. 
Concepts of 
insider vs. 
outsider may be 
irrelevant if everyone is from somewhere else. 
Spoke to several surf—fisherman and photographed them. 
One 
was from New York and the other was a retired military man who 
had lived lots of places. 
Is this the "placeless landscape," 
like 
in Relph? 
Folklife, understood as expressive culture, 
is 
recreational 
and heavily dependent upon commercial products, all 
the way from bait bought in a bait shop to expensive fiberglass 
boats, and everything in between. 
This is, 
of course, an 
initial 
impression based on little more than a windshield survey, and a 
walk along the beach in Harvey Cedars. 
Surf City's water—tower 
reminded me of the one 
in Metropolis, Illinois, but it should 
have had a mural of Jan and Dean on 
it as the one 
in Metropolis 
has Superman. 
Drove back to "the Lodge" about 7:30 pm.

Drove down to the southern portion of section 4 today. 
While driving down Rte. 671 between Buena and Cumberland, I 
stopped to photograph two men who were cutting firewood 
G—Vineland; 
39GT with a bow chain saw. 
This is easier to handle 
in 
light brush. 
As they were Wharton State Forest rangers who 
were moonlighting, they did not wish to disclose their 
identities. 
They had an old Ford stakebed truck which they were using to haul 
the logs out of the wood. 
Photographed a woods road, basically 
just two ruts 
in the forest. 
They were clearing culled trees for 
the property—owner and expected to sell the firewood in Vineland. 
TX02: From there I drove through Cumberland, photographed a yard 
decoration G—Cumberland; 
38GT, where I photographed an unused 
flea—market set—up, and piles of cordwood. 
Just outside Bricks 
boro, I photographed an abandoned seafood plant, which had seve 
ral 
old oyster—dredges, of the chain—type G—Bricksboro; 
38GT, and 
a 24—foot wooden boat, G—Bricksboro; 
38GT, presumably once used 
for oystering. 
TX03: 
From there I headed down to Dorchester, where I conducted 
an 
interview at the Whitehead Bros. sand—mine G—Dorchester; 
38GT, 
with Carl Beagle (the superintendent), and equipment operators 
Chester Rilman and Ed Brown. 
The sand—mining information G—Dor 
chester; 38GT is 
logged in detail on RLOG JL001, which see. 
Mr. 
Beagle suggested that I visit Whitehead Bros.' other sand—mining 
operation, a sand—dredge, at Port Elizabeth G—Port Elizabeth; 
38GT. 
He suggested that I contact the company's engineer, David 
Hergert, 785-2090, and ask him to give me a tour of the Port 
Elizabeth sand—dredging operation. 
TX04: From there I drove down through Leesburg, Maurice River, 
and Heislerville, stopping along the way to photograph iron tire 
yard ornaments G—Leesburg; 
38GT, consisting of two sets of three 
half iron tires painted white, flanking the end of a driveway. 
Just outside Heislerville, I photographed an elaborate 
grotto shrine/yard ornament G—Heislerville; 
38GT, which belonged 
to a Hispanic G—Heislerville; 
38GT family. 
The area around Heislerville has small fields of corn

Heading down to North Dennis, I passed by a large turf farm, 
G—North Dennis; 
38GT, seemingly fallen upon recent hard times, 
probably due to the drought of summer 1983. 
From there, I drove home through Woodbine, Tuckahoe, May's

Drove down to the southern tip of the north part of 
section 4, that is, Atlantic County, near the shore. 
While 
driving down Rte. 9 near Port Republic, I noticed a large 
"Decoys" G—Port Republic; 
13GT sign on the road next to Nacote 
Creek. 
I went down the road about a block, and there was the 
home of Ted and Jane VonBosse, the yard of which was filled with 
bird feeders, G—Port Republic; 
13GT whirligigs, and roughed—out 
decoys. 
Across the street was a little harbor, full 
of boats, 
many of them wooden, including several garveys, a very finely 
made skiff, probably used for hunting, because it had a built in 
shell box. 
It also had scalloped decorations under the thwarts. 
Up on 
land, 
in the boatyard, were several sneakboxes G—Port 
Republic; 
13GT, and a square, box—like, sneakbox—like craft, 
which I later found out was called a "pond box."G—Port Republic; 
13GT and 
is also used for sneaking up on waterfowl while hunting 
G—Port Republic; 
13GT. 
I photographed all 
of these, as well. 
In 
the boatyard were several shop—buildings, one of which was used 
by Mr. Von Bosse as his decoy carving G—Port Republic; 
13GT and 
boat repairing G—Port Republic; 
13GT shop. 
There were also 
several 
live boxes G—Port Republic; 
13GT for crabs which I found 
out belonged to Mr. V., who crabbed commercially G—Port Republic; 
13GT during the season, and retailed them from there. 
I picked up one of his rather artistic business cards, which 
listed the following services: 
"Decoy & Folkcarving Workshop; 
Gunning Decoys, duck—goose—snipe G—Port Republic; 
13GT; Various 
other handcrafts; Lively crabs 
in season; Whittled characters, 
Animals—odd birds; Boat Slips," and gave the location as "East of 
Route 9 by historic Nacote Creek." 
Mr. VonB. eventually showed 
up and I ended up interviewing him for an hour on the Nagra. 
He was originally from Philadelphia, but he grew up 
in 
Seaside Heights, where he began hunting and decoy carving under 
the tutelage of two local 
"old timers." 
Now he teaches 
accounting and finance at Stockton State College, and spends most 
of the rest of his time carving or repairing boats. 
His wife Jane 
is also an accomplished woodcarver. 
(See RLOG RJL002 for details 
of 
interview.) 
Aside from the information in the taped 
interview, he gave me a considerable network of other possible 
informants, which I shall attempt to summarize here: 
There's a 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes

business card for John A. Cavileer (609-652-7302) and Robert 
Wilson (609-652-7978) who provide guided

13GT trips. 
There's another business card for

(609) 398-5182, who's a decoy carver G—Seaville;

Mr. VonB. also lent me two old newspaper articles of

Charles V. Mathis, "A Salt Haying We Will Go...; "(I 
couldn't figure out what local newspaper this was from) and Paul 
Merkoski, "Salem Co. Muskrat Sales:

...of muskrats," 
Atlantic City, N.J. Sunday Press, 17 March 
1979, pp. 
1—B, 
12—B. 
The salt hay article is very informative 
(see ephemera file). The muskrat article concerns what purports 
to be the "greatest muskrat fur auction in the world," Lower 
Alloway Creek municipality, Salem County, which is held every 
February (also see ephemera file). 
Mr. VonB. 
mentioned a number 
of other important other area contacts during the interview. (For 
access to these, see RLOG RJL002 & RJL003.) 
TX02: After the interview, I drove down to Oyster Creek, and had 
an oyster platter at the Oyster Creek Inn. 
Next door, sure 
enough, was Maxwell's Oyster House G—Oyster Creek; 09GT, and on the 
creek itself were several oystering boats G—Oyster Creek; 
09GT, 
including a few garveys G—Oyster Creek;

I photographed as much as I 
could 
in the rainy dusk, and a truck driver for an oyster dealer

Drove down to Atlantic Co. Park, Estellville to talk to 
Dick Regensburg, director of the Nature Center at 
Atlantic 
County Park, with whom I had talked at last night's National Park 
Service "Pinelands Interpretation Committee" meeting. 
He's an 
archaeologist and a friend of Mary Hufford, who's done a number 
of ethnic & historical surveys in south Jersey. 
(Atlantic Co. 
Park phone: 609 625-7000 ext. 5374; home phone G—Port RepublicGT; 
652-6863) 
Among the things he told me was that he had done an ethnic 
group Topo—Quad location series with a "P" for Polish, "J" for 
Jewish, asnd so on, at the individual family residence level. 
He 
says that John Sinton has those maps and that anybody is free to 
consult them or copy them. 
While talking about the area, he 
decided to call upon his park ranger, James "Jim" Owens, who's 
also a deputy conservation officer. 
He assured me that Jim was 
very knowledgeable about the south portion of my area. 
It turned out that Jim was indeed a gold mine of the kind of 
preliminary information which I am seeking. 
He immediately 
suggested that conservation officers & some police were an 
obvious route to take. 
Dick R. 
interjected that in studying 
folklife, illegal activities should also be a consideration, 
especially outdoor stuff such as poaching. 
Owens looked at my 
yellow—outlined N.J. Dept. of Transportation highway map, and 
proceeded to 
list the important contacts in the area. 
His list 
is a melange of 
local politicians, 
law enforcement types, 
farmer/old timers, & others. 
After Owens repeated the list, 
Regensburg allowed how there was enough material for several 
doctoral dissertations on 
local folkways on 
it. 
I've decided, 
for better or worse , to 
let 
it be my guide for this part of the 
project, at least for the South Portion of Section 4. 
I showed him my suggested list of police dept. contacts. 
He 
first of all dismissed the idea of using State Police as con 
tacts, as they are rotated every few years, and don't stay long 
enough to really "know" an area. 
He then added his list of suggested contacts, which goes 
something like this (I didn't tape): 
*Herschel Beebe seems to be the most important of these. 
He's a deputy conservation officer for the Div. of Fish & Game. 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes

He 
lives on Pickle Factory Rd., near Eldora & near Belleplain, 
in

about an old family of area pig—farmers.) (Beebe's office is on 
Piney Hollow Rd., Williamstown:

Home phone: 785-1349. 
Talking to Beebe on the phone, 9/28, he told me of Champion's

After amassing a list of contacts with the help of Dick 
Regensburg & Jim Owens (FJL0927), I phoned all those on 
it who 
were in some kind of wide—ranging capacity, and set up 
appointments for interviews. 
The first two of these occurred 
today. 
10 am, I met with Fred & Mary Mitchell of Estell Manor. P.O. 
Box 84, Estell Manor, NJ. 08319. (Both of them are longtime 
residents. G—Estell Manor City; 07GT. 
He was born there 80 yrs. 
ago, she moved there 
in 1930s, after their marriage -- she's 78. 
She was on Estell Manor City Board of Education from '39 'til 
recently. 
Has been at every Estell Manor City city council 
meeting & was notary since '45. 
She has 12 books of notes from 
council meetings since '45. They both attend all 
area government 
and political meetings, and take copious notes. They also keep 
in 
touch with area happenings by keeping a police band scanner 
turned on. 
She was Secretary of Board of Ed. 1939 to 1951, was 
also President of Board of Ed. She was first president of the 
local P.T.A. 
in 1937. Mary was also postmistress 
from '56 to 
'72. She had been clerk for some time. Then one day in 
'45, she 
was manning the office during lunch hour, and the old 
postmistress went home for lunch, where she promptly died of a 
heart attack, or something. 
Mary still got the afternoon mail 
out on time. 
She immediately took over as acting postmistress, 
and was appointed to the post in 
'46. 
Mary is still on the 
E.M.C. Planning Board. 
Mr. Mitchell was first a telegrapher for the Reading R.R.; 
then he was a carpenter; and finally he was, for years since 
1952, the tax—collector for Estell Manor City. 
Estell Manor City is a political unit, made up of the 
communities of Estell Manor (formerly Risley--where they live--at 
jct. of Cumberland Ave. & Rte. 557 on the Conrail [formerly the 
Reading R.R. Seashore Line]), Estellville, Hawkinsville (formerly 
Oakville--"That's where in 1913 they built a schoolhouse for just 
2 people"), and Head—of—the—River. Estell Manor City shares a 
joint municipal court with Corbin City and Weymouth, which is 
held 
in E.M.C. 
Last year they had a big poaching case concerning 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 15 
a poaching ring from Philadelphia. 
Mostly they just do traffic 
violations. 
Last year they had 1.100 cases, as opposed to an 
average of 400 cases a year in previous recent years. 
This 
caused a meeting in which the court clerk demanded that somehow 
or other the caseload be decreased from now on. 
Wood poaching is 
a big problem in the area, but few are ever caught or brought to 
tri al . 
Estell Manor City certified their approval of the Pinelands 
Nat'l Reserve in August '83, thus giving local Planning G—Estell 
Manor City; 07GT Board input into application of Pinelands poli 
cies locally, and giving them paid—for services of professional 
planners. 
Weymouth Township did not vote approval of the Pine 
lands planning G—Weymouth: 14GT program, so they have no input into 
policy. 
They have to go along with whatever the Pinelands Com 
mission decides, and they have to pay for their own planner. 
Estell Manor City, on the other hand, has been able to force 
compromises in planning G—Estell Manor City; 07GT 
from the Pine 
lands Commission 
The Mitchells basically approve of the Pinelands planning 
G—Estell Manor City; 07GT policies in the long run ("I can see 
where it'll help the area") but they have been hurt 
personally, 
as well 
as many of their neighbors, the reasons being mostly 
because of 
limitations in building on acreage. A lot of people, 
including the Mitchells, own building lots 
in the area. Now their 
less—than-5—acre plots are unsaleable, because they're in an area 
where you can't build on 
less than 5 acres. 
This is at a time 
when there 
is considerable demand for home sites in the area, due 
to the proximity of Atlantic City and its growing economy. 
The 
Mitchells have actually forfeited some of their property for back 
taxes. ("Why pay taxes on 
it 
if you can't use 
it or sell 
it?"). 
They also own some less—than—one—acre lots 
in a special South 
Mays Landing tract where you can build on one—acre lots. 
In the 
meantime, there 
is much buying & selling in area due to Atlantic 
City's proximity. 
A lot of the land in the area that isn't being 
built on 
is reverting to woods, which puts the entire area under 
threat in case of forest fire G—Estell Manor City: 07GT. ("One 
forest fire G—Estell Manor City; 07GT 
can ruin the whole area 
completely, 
if 
it's all woods. "). 
Estell Manor was originally Risley, because the land was 
bought in 1895 by Daniel L. Risley, who hired a surveyor named 
Ralph Gulf to survey the area and subdivide it. 
Gulf was from 
the area and took the job at age 26, because he had been told 
that he had only one year to 
live, and he wanted to live it back 
home 
in South Jersey. 
He 
laid out 5—acre tracts with monuments 
G—Estell Manor City: 07GT at every corner. 
These monuments G—Estell 
Manor City; 07GT have now mostly been bulldozed out of existence. 
Occasionally someone digs one of them up. 
The Mitchells recently 
visited Mr. Gulf in Florida (he's now in his 90s--so much for 
"only one year to 
live"), and he helped them to 
locate the monu 
ments for some of their lots. Near the Reading R.R. Station in 
Risley, the tracts were laid out as one—acre lots. 
One major event in the city's history was the great forest 
fire G—Estell Manor City; 07GT of 1925, which burned down many town 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 16 
buildings, 
including the Catholic church G—Estell Manor City; 07GT. 
Risley had bought the land in the area from Anne Estell 
Burgess, buying, 
in the process, her $32,000 mortgage. 
As he 
sold the lots, he at first got releases of mortgage, but after a 
while, didn't bother anymore. 
Later Ms. Burgess foreclosed some 
of the people who had bought land from Risley, and some of them 
had to leave, and others had to buy 
it all 
over again. 
Consequently much of the land 
in the area, 
including some that 
has valuable improvements on 
it, does not have clear title. 
Local abstracters don't alwaysm search very deep, so such land 
is 
often 
is often sold as 
if 
it had clear title, which can, of 
course cause serious problems for the owners in the future. 
The 
Mitchells have had 
to go to court to clear the title on some of 
their property. 
The Mitchells lent me two newspaper articles concerning the 
history of Risley/Estell Manor, which are now in the ephemera 
file: Henry Charlton Beck, "Jerseyana: 
Risley 'wiped off' map--a 
victim of conformity," Newark Sunday Star—Ledger, 31 July 1960, 
p. C4 (This article deals with both past and present of area. 
It 
includes interview with and photo of Mary Mitchell, and 
it was 
inspired by the fact that Rand—McNally had finally, that year 
gotten around to changing the map—name "Risley" to "Estell Ma 
nor." It contained one major error--Estell Manor seceded from 
Weymouth in 1925, not in 1895, as the article said.) The other 
article is Lucia Calascibetta, "South Jersey Sidewalks: Risley A 
Town 'Absorbed' By Circumstances," Atlantic City Press, 20 May 
1980, Venture section, p. V1—V2. (This story is a general histo 
rical overview of Risley/Estell Manor, with interview of Fred 
Mitchell as the "oldest resident." 
Many years ago, the principal 
industry in the area was 
raising poultry G—Estell Manor City; 07GT for eggs G—Estell Manor 
City; 07GT. 
This continued at an even pace until after World War 
II, when considerable numbers of Jewish G—Estell Manor City; 07GT 
refugees from Europe came into the area. 
According to some kind 
of deal 
involving the Immigration Service and Jewish philanthro 
pic agencies, they had to stay & farm for 5 years, after which 
they could, of course, become U.S. citizens and then do whatever 
they wanted. 
Most of these folks were doctors, lawyers, and 
other urban professionals, totally unsuited for farming. 
They 
did however expand the size of the poultry farms G—Estell Manor 
City; 07GT from an average of 2,500-3,000 layers, to a new average 
of 20-30,000! 
This kind of competition put the locals 
in the 
industry right out of business. 
Most of these new egg farmers 
G—Estell Manor City; 07GT did not actually do the work themselves, 
but hired farmhands to do 
it for them. 
Five years later, most of 
them left the area, and within a few years after that, all were 
gone--and so was poultry farming G—Estell Manor City; 07GT in sou 
thern Atlantic County! 
Fred Mitchell remembers (from his service 
as tax collector) one of the new people coming in and saying, "I 
can't make any money without 20,000 chickens."G—Estell Manor City; 
07GT 
Some of the Jewish G—Estell Manor City; 07GT refugees stayed 
in the area. 
The Gurnitzes (sp.?) were, for a long time, the 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 17 
area's leading building contractors. Chicken—farming G—Estell 
Manor City; 07GT also died out due to the necessity for automa 
tion; and because of poultry diseases G—Estell Manor City; 07GT. 
Fred remembers driving a load of chickens to north Jersey to 
market them, but they caught colds on the way and were wheezing. 
He got only $50 for $3,500 worth of chickens. 
Nowadays raising 
any chickens in the area at all 
is unprofitable, due to feed— 
prices. (Fred: "You can't even find a roadside stand that has any 
eggs.") 
Many of the eggs G—Estell Manor City; 07GT retailed in the 
area come from the Amish country of Pennsylvania (via market in 
Philadelphia), and these eggs G—Estell Manor City; 07GT are cheaper 
than they would cost you to raise them yourself, what with the 
high feed—prices. 
Chicken farming G—Estell Manor City; 07GT was 
essentially dead by the end of the 1950s. 
Back at the turn of the century, woodcutting G—Estell Manor 
City; 07GT was the area's leading industry. 
Much of 
it was sold 
as cordwood G—Estell Manor City; 07GT. 
Much of 
it was also used 
for making charcoal G—Estell Manor City; 07GT. 
Cranberry farming 
G—Head—of—theRiver: 
07GT in the area started then at Durrell's 
cranberry bogs G—Head—of—the—River; 07GT, near Head—of—the—River. 
There was also Shueler's (spelling?) cranberry bog G—Estell Manor 
City; 07GT, just west of Estell Manor. 
Cranberries G—Estell Manor; 
07; Head—of—the—River :07GT were, 
in those days, shipped out by 
rail. 
Shueler's cranberry bog G—Estell Manor City; 07GT is still 
in business. 
Many area cranberry farmers G—Estell Manor City; 07GT 
quit after the pesticide—scare in the early 1960s. 
There have been two large munitions plants in area: 
Bethlehem Steel had a munitions plant where Atlantic County Park 
is now located, during World War I. 
DuPont had one west of 
Estell Manor 
in Maurice River Twp., during World War II. 
The 
DuPont plant had a very active proving ground which made lots of 
noise. 
The Mitchell  remember driving along near there and 
hearing a tremendous explosion, which caused them to turn around 
and head for home. 
One old lady living out 
in the country com 
plained that they "blew in my side," but she didn't explain 
whether it was the side of her house or the side of her body! 
Area industries are now rather diverse. 
Mays Landing and 
Millville have large glass factories G—Mays Landing; 10GT, to which 
many area residents commute to work. Quill Corp. operates a 
gravel pit G—Estell Manor City; 07GT on Maple Ave. Some area resi 
dents commute to work at Leesburg State Prison. 
Just outside 
Estell Manor City is Jersey Mold & Tool, recently started by a 
German immigrant. 
Most of his employees are also recent German 
immigrants who learned tool—and—die—making over there. (Fred: "We 
don't train 'em over here the way they do. ") 
Other plants to 
which people commute G—Estell Manor City; 07GT include Foster— 
Forbes Glass (formerly Kerr Glass) 
in Millville; Kimball Glass 
(owned by Owens—Illinois) in Vineland; Wheaton Glass in Mill 
Ville; 
Wheaton Glass' plastic bottles plant in Mays Landing; and 
Gem Refrigerators in Estellville. 
Due to the local economic boom 
fostered by Atlantic City's casinos, there has been considerable 
construction work--home building--in the area. 
Five houses are 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 18 
being built in Estell Manor right now. Many area residents also 
commute to work 
in the Atlantic City casinos, although many of 
the area residents who are casino workers are newcomers. Area 
residents who are casino workers hold such jobs as security 
oficers, electricians, housekeepers, electronics technicians. 
Everyone is convinced that the opening of casinos in Atlantic 
City has benefitted Estell Manor City's economy immensely. 
Woodcutting G—Estell Manor City; 07GT on 
land 
in the area is 
generally inhibited by Pinelands regulations that prohibit cut 
ting other than dead trees. 
On the other hand, 
in order for 
one's land to be taxed at the lower farm rates (under $100/acre) 
each acre (up to 100 acres) must produce at least $500 worth of 
income. 
In the area, that can mean only one thing, woodcutting. 
In the last 3 to 4 years, that problem has been ameliorated 
somewhat by a plague of gypsy moths, which have killed millions 
of area trees. (Mary: 
"If they strip the leaves from your tree 
for 3 years in a row, that kills it. ") 
Woods along Cumberland 
Rd., between Atlantic Co. Park and Estell Manor have been deva 
stated by the gypsy moths. (A fact to which I will personally 
attest.) 
Other area agriculture G—Estell Manor City; 07GT is sparse. 
There is the Betts family's Tuckahoe Turf Farm G—Buck Hill; 07GT, 
which raises turf for lawns. 
Clemson's farm on 9th Ave. & Tucka 
hoe Rd. G—Marshallville; 07GT raises some corn G—Marshallville; 07GT 
and, occasionally, sorghum G—Marshallville; 07GT. 
There is a large 
horse farm 
G—Maurice River; 
38GT that raises racehorses and used 
to raise racing dogs, 
in northern Maurice River Twp. 
It is 
called Briardale Farm, and is owned by the Imbesi family, of 
Italian G—Maurice River; 38GT ancestry. 
They had several states' 
7—Up distributorships, including New Jersey and Delaware. 
Estell 
Manor City has four commercial campgrounds. 
According to Fred Mitchell, very little trapping occurs in 
the limits of Estell Manor City. 
The area around Estell Manor City has a mixture of nationa 
lities, 
including people of German G—Estell Manor City; 07GT, 
Swedish G—Estell Manor City; 07GT, English and Italian ancestry 
There was an 
influx of Jews after World War 
II, but most of them left long ago. There are also a few Russians 
G—Estell Manor City; 07GT, who came over after the Revolution. 
Mrs. Mitchell remembers one old woman, the widow of one of the 
Tsar's generals, who liked to give everybody orders. 
Once she 
came into the post office and demanded that she be allowed to pay 
her property taxes immediately (this was when Fred was tax col 
lector and Mary was postmistress). 
Another time, she ordered a 
load of bacon through the grocery (which Mary also operated, 
in 
conjunction with the post office), but it was too fat, and Mary 
didn't even dare show it to her; she just sent it back. 
(The 
latter incident is alluded to 
in the Star—Ledger article.) 
Social activities in the area have taken a considerable 
beating in recent years, because so many people are on "shift 
work" 
in 
local factories and 
in the Atlantic City casinos.

The Mitchells do not consdier their area to be part of the 
Pine Barrens: 
"That's the area up north where they have two—foot 
—high trees. 
It has pristine water, but it's barren. 
Our area 
isn't barren." 
They do, however, consider it to be part of the 
PineI and s. 
The Mitchells also recommended that we read the planning 
report for their area:

2 pm: 
Met Ron Dietrich (chief) and Carl Owen, at the N.J. 
Dept. of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service G—Mays 
Landing; IOGT Area C headquarters in Mays Landing, to get their 
perspective of the area. 
I tried, as much as possible, to steer 
the conversation to the area in southern section 4. 
Dietrich is 
not native, but comes from north Jersey. 
He was area forester 
for years, before becoming forest fire chief. 
Owens is, however, 
a native of the Mays Landing area. 
First of all, they recommended that I talk to Art Whitney of 
Estell Manor, an area old timer. 
They also recommended David

Vegetable farming in the area died out about 15-20 years 
ago, after migrant labor laws began to be enforced. 
Larry Bohm, 
of North Dennis, 
was a vegetable farmer G—North Dennis; 34GT, then 
started raising soybeans G—North Dennis; 34GT, and has now gone 
over entierly to turf farming G—North Dennis; 34GT. 
Seabrook Frozen Foods of Bridgeton was once one of the 
country's largest frozen food packers, and bought vegetables from

of Vineland. Kenny Camp still raises a lot of tomatoes G—Port 
Elizabeth; 
38GT at his farm near Port Elizabeth. 
This is also a 
general produce farm G—Port Elizabeth; 38GT, but all

Hammonton also has a large brewery G—Hammonton; IIGT, which makes 
Old Milwaukee, Canadian Ace, Black Label, and several supermarket 
off—brands & generics. 
Cumberland County has some families of Japanese descent, who 
came here as part of the World War II 
internment policies, and 
who lived 
in a prison camp that was operated by Seabrook Frozen 
Foods, for whom they worked as field labor. 
There is considerable trapping G—Maurice River Twp.GT G—Port

1 October 1983: 
Today I drove down to Cumberland in 
Maurice River Twp., Cumberland Co., to interview Frank Warfle, a 
deputy conservation officer, forest fire warden, and volunteer 
fireman G—Cumberland; 38GT for the Cumberland Fire Co. 
At first, 
he was convinced that I was a Federal 
investigator investigating 
"deer jackin'" (poaching), and there has evidently been some 
criticism of how conservation laws are enforced locally, so they 
thought that I was down there to 
look 
into that. 
I didn't bring 
in a recorder, because I wanted to size up the situation first. 
Because of their nervousness regarding the "deer jackin "' 
question, I didn't bring it 
in 
later either. 
When, after about a 
half hour, things really loosened up, I felt that the rapport 
would have been ruined, so I ended up making it a notebook 
interview, which I shall try to recapture here. 
Walter Hawn ended up being a great raconteur, and I really 
wish that I had some of his stuff on tape, but given the sensi 
tive nature of some of 
it, 
it's doubtful whether or not it would 
have flowed so freely in front of a mike. 
One of the first things that happened was that Warfle's 
teenaged son came 
in & launched into a tirade against the 
woodcutting that's gone on in the area recently and how bad 
it 
was. 
Before he could get much said, though, Mrs. Warfle came in 
and cut him off, much to my disappointment. 
Because of the rambling nature of this session, I have 
attempted to reorganize it thematically. 
Most of the information 
comes from Walt Hawn, with occasional comments by 
Fred Warfle. 
Fire companies and fire fighting. Cumberland Fire Co. used 
to have barbecues 
to raise money, but no longer, as 
it wasn't 
worth the trouble for the amounts raised. 
Maurice River Twp. has five volunteer fire companies 
G—Cumberland; 38GT G—Leesburg; 38GT G—Heislerville; 38GT 
G—Delmont; 38GT G—Port Elizabeth; 38GT. 
They are Cumberland, Delmont, 
Heislerville, Leesburg, and Port Elizabeth. Leesburg Fire Co. has 
oyster & ham dinners G—Leesburg; 38GT to raise money. 
They also 
have a local fire tax. 
Port Elizabeth Fire Co., G—Port Elizabeth 
38GT has chicken pot pie 
dinners, with the best chicken pot pie 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 24 
in the area. 
Tickets are always sold out way 
in advance, as 
it's 
"all 
you can eat for $5." 
Heislerville Fire Co. has weekly bingo, from which it 
derives significant income. Both Leesburg Fire Co. & Heislerville 
Fire Co. 
are affluent enough to sponsor social activities for 
their members. 
Annual dinners 
G—Leesburg; 38GT G—Heislerville; 38GT 
and "ladies' nights" are among the events that they sponsor for 
their own membership. 
This is something that the other fire 
co.'s 
in the township cannot afford. 
Some fire companies in the 
area actually raise enough money that they can buy members' dress 
uniforms for parades, and other more or less personal 
items. 
None of the fire companies in Maurice River Twp. can afford such 
luxuries. 
The volunteer fire companies within Vineland (there are 
four, plus a professional company in the center of the city) are 
known for such affluence. Volunteer fire departments are known 
locally as "fire halls." Each volunteer fire 
company in Maurice 
River Township receives $4,000 annually from the township. Port 
Elizabeth and Delmont Fire Co.'s were built with Federal funds. 
As can be expected, most of the information on "fire halls" 
or volunteer fire companies 
which Walt Hawn gave me concerned 
the one 
in Cumberland, of which he 
is chief. 
One way that 
Cumberland Fire Co. raises funds 
is by selling chances on a 50/50 
lottery, by going house to house. Cumberland Fire Co. was started 
25 years ago. 
At that time, there was no fire protection in the 
area at all. There are no hydrants in the area. 
All water must 
be pumped from ponds and hauled by tankers, of which they have 
two, each of 1.250 gallon capacity. "We've never had a rich man 
belong to the 'fire hall' G—Cumberland; 38GT, just workin' people, 
like Fred and me." The fire company was started with a $200 1929 
Sanford, a 1947 Dodge oil truck converted for water carrying, and 
a $1,500 loan. 
Then they bought a 1941 Diamond—T pumper for 
grass fires. 
They then kept building up, buying newer and newer 
equipment, until 1969, when they designed a truck of their own, 
which they ordered from New Jersey Fire Equipment Co. They wanted 
a very large water capacity, but only a small pump, so that it 
didn't empty too quickly. 
The one they ordered had no chrome on 
it and was so "stripped—down" that N.J.F.E.C. refused to put 
their name on 
it, 
and delivered it at night! 
They still have 
that truck which, Walt says, 
is probably one of the best fire 
trucks around. 
Because of appreciation in value of old fire 
equipment, they have always realized a profit when selling old 
equipment, some of which has been sold to antique—vehicle 
collectors. "Some of the guys 
in the 'hall' can pinch a nickel 
'til 
it shits," acording to Hawn. 
Cumberland Fire Co. has five women members. "Three of 
'em 
can do anything a man can do." 
Two of them can't drive the 
trucks, because they have standard shifts. 
Usually, during a 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 25 
small daytime fire G—Cumberland; 38GT, one man and one woman go. 
The woman drives the truck and operates the pump, while the man 
handles the hose and nozzle. Fire protection has improved 
immensely in the township, but it still 
is not sufficient to 
affect fire insurance rates. 
"Our biggest concern goin' to a 
fire 
used to be knockin' over the chimney." All 
labor at the 
"fire hall" 
is donated, so work parties end up being a major 
area social event. 
Aside from that, there are very few social 
activities in and around Cumberland. 
Walt Hawn wants to write a 
book about how to start a firehouse 
from scratch. 
TX02: Churches. G—Maurice River Twp.GT 
There are very few churches 
in Maurice River Township. 
Most (or, possibly, all) are 
Methodist. Cumberland has a Methodist church 
G—Cumberland; 38GT 
which is part—time pastored by a pastor from Vineland. 
The most 
active church in the area is the Methodist church G—Port 
Elizabeth; 38GT in Port Elizabeth. It holds numerous social events 
such as suppers, etc. The pastor is Paul Pedrick--Walt Hawn's 
brother—in—law. 
He 
is also chaplain at he state prisons. 
G—Leesburg; 38GT Walt is of the opinion that most 
of the local 
people are not churchgoers, but they "believe in God, because the 
sun comes up 
in the morning and goes down at night." 
TX02: 
Industry G—Maurice River Twp.GT There are few plants in 
Maurice River Township. 
The biggest employers G—Leesburg; 38GT 
within the township limits are the Leesburg State Prison and the 
Southern State Corrections Facility, both located in Leesburg. 
Most locals commute to nearby cities to work. 
Frank Warfle is a 
mechanic for Commercial Fuel 
in Millville, and also has a 
wrecking service in Cumberland, and a small junkyard. 
Walt Hawn 
works as a plant—maintenance foreman for Airwork Corp., an 
aircraft engine overhauling company 
in Millville. 
There are a number of nearby sand mines. 
The biggest of 
these was once located 
in what is now the Holly Farm in Millville 
(which is not 
in Maurice R. Twp, of the Pinelands Reserve.) It 
was reputedly the largest sand mine in the world. 
Among the 
present—day sand mines G—Dorchester; 38GT [Dividing Creek; 
38] 
in 
the area are, Whitehead Bros. 
in Dorchester and Port Elizabeth; 
George F. Petinos' 
in Port Elizabeth; Owens—Illinois in Port 
Elizabeth; Jesse Mori's in Mauricetown; Penn Glass in Dividing 
Creek; and Uniman's in Dividing Creek. 
Jack Feltes of Port 
Elizabeth, a Maurice River Township committeeman, was a sand 
miner 
for years, and 
is very knowlegeable about the subject. 
One big plant in the township is Dorchester Shipyards 
G—Dorchester; 38GT in Dorchester, which is one of the many South 
Jersey industries owned by Wheaton Industries (a glass company, 
whose main plant is 
in Millville). 
They build 
oysterboats, 
most of them in the 25—foot class, but right now (10/1/83) they 
are building a 75—footer, the first big steel oysterboat built in 
New Jersey in 50 years. 
Frank Warfle gave me a copy of the 10/1 
Millville Daily with a front—page photo captioned "Fleet 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 26 
Addition." 
The boat is named the "Robert C. Morgan," and 
is 
named after a local man. (See Jens Lund's Ephemera File.) They 
recently also built a large yacht for Frank Wheaton, the 
company's president. (Wheaton is a local 
"big man." When driving 
a fancy pickup truck, Walt says he "feels like Frank Wheaton 
driving to work." At the time of this interview, the Wheaton 
Corp. was experiencing a major strike, which had been in effect 
for months, throwing the local economy out of kilter.) There is 
also a shipyard near Leesburg G- Leesburg; 38GT, which belongs to 
Whitehead Bros.

There is, unfortunately, no

oyster houses and docking places for o

TX03: 
Agriculture. 
Maurice River 
Twp. have very little agriculture 
produce-farming was practiced 
oystering operated from

All 
of the 
yster boats are on the

ontrolled by Wheaton 
heaton keeps it as a 
Twp, and the adjoining Dennis 
today. 
At one time, vegetable 
in the area, but that's practically 
all 
gone. 
As soon as you cross the township line into Commercial 
Twp., and as you head into Millville and the outskirts of 
Vineland, there are still numerous produce farms. 
The Pinelands 
Reserve boundary must have been drawn to exclude them. 
Today 
there are a few turf farms G- Dennisville; 34GT G- Head-of-the-River; 
07GT in the area: Bohm's, near Dennisville; and Betts', near Head-

G- Bricksboro; 38GT G- Cumberland; 38GT G- Leesburg; 38GT G- Maurice 
River; 38GT G- Heislerville; 38GT 
There is considerable trapping along both 
sides of the Maurice River. The area's leading trapper 
is Tom C. 
Brown, on the Cumberland Rd., just west of Cumberland (825-4736). 
He has trapped all 
of his life. 
He teaches trapping and wildlife 
conservation for 4-H. He also has a house full of antiques and 
Lund-- 83 Fieldnotes 
page 27 
other artifacts, and can talk about them for hours. 
He is 
reportedly also the area's leading raconteur, and I was warned to 
expect to spend about eight hours there if I intended to 
interview him. 
Walt Hawn phoned him to let him know that I was 
intending to contact him. The phone conversation was humorous, 
and 
in reply to "How're you doing?," or something like that, Walt 
answered, variously, "O.K. We get three good meals a day and a 
lot o' 
lovin'," and, "Kiss your angel good morning and hope she's 
got your breakfast ready." 
TX06: 
Hunting and Poaching 
Although legal deer hunting is 
practiced in the area, there is far more "deer jackin"' G—Maurice 
River Twp.GT than legal hunting. 
Warfle is a part—time deputy 
conservation officer, and has to enforce hunting 
G—Cumberland; 
38GT laws locally. 
Small—time poaching 
is practiced by some 
locals, some of whom do 
it "only to put meat on the table." 
Such 
cases are often ignored or treated leniently. 
On the other hand, 
there are big poaching rings, often made up of people from the 
big city, who take large numbers of 
illegal deer. 
A ring of 
"deer jackers" from Philadelphia was busted last year. 
The usual 
way to catch them is for undercover agents to gather intelligence 
in 
local bars. 
Supposedly, serious poachers are inveterate 
braggarts, and they often make their selling contacts in bars. 
Then the local conservation officers and deputies tail them and 
try to catch them in the act, as that is the only reliable way to 
make a conviction. 
The "little guy" is hard to catch because he 
will get out and walk. The "big guy" tries to do 
it all from his 
pickup truck at night with a spotlight. 
Many "seller" poachers 
will just sell 
the valuable hindquarters and waste the rest of 
the deer 
. Some people practice poaching 
for the "sport" of 
it, 
others mainly for the money. 
The usual punishment locally 
is 
a $4-500 fine. 
TX07: 
Ethnicity: 
Maurice River Township does not have the 
mosaic of ethnic groups 
found elsewhere in the area. 
There are 
some Italians, and a few Puerto Ricans. 
Many area old timers 
"carry Indian 
blood," according to Hawn. 
The prevalent ethnic 
G—Cumberland: 38GT group in the area, according to Hawn, consists 
of "Pineys." (See below.) 
TX08: 
The Pinelands Reserve. 
G—Cumberland; 38GT Walt Hawn is 
very much in favor of the Reserve "for myself, but not for my 
kids." 
He 
is eager to see the area preserved from builders and 
developers, and the water kept pure, but he 
is afraid that his 
children will have to move out of the area in order to make a 
living, or at least, commute to work in Atlantic City or 
Vineland, and then they won't be able to build in Maurice River 
Twp., because of building restrictions. 
Basically, he 
is of two 
minds about it, because of his strong conservation ethic, but he 
also wants his children to be able to settle there. 
TX09: 
"Pineys." 
G—Cumberland; 38GT "We're 'Pineys!,"" was an 
emphatically volunteered statement by Walt Hawn. 
He compared the 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 28 
local 
lifestyle to that of the better—known "Pineys" near 
Chatsworth. 
He then proceeded to characterize the attributes of 
a "piney," as understood by him. 
One important "Piney" 
trait 
is frugality. He knows how to get the full value of a nickel. 
A 
"Piney" G—Maurice River Twp.GT 
might go and gamble in Atlantic 
City, and he'd take whatever he generally might spend on a night 
out, and gamble that--say $20 or so. 
Then if he wins $100, he 
won't reinvest it, 
he'll just bring it home. 
In no way, would he 
ever blow a week's paycheck there. 
Their social 
life 
is home— 
centered, and they don't regularly hang out in bars. Also 
important to "Pineys" is knowing your neighbors. A good "Piney" 
knows most of the people 
in the area by name. 
He mentioned a 
prominent undertaker who lives near Leesburg. 
He met the man 
once at a funeral, and ever since then the man has known Walt by 
name, a fact which impresses Walt greatly. 
He contrasted this to 
life 
in Philadelphia, where people have no idea who their 
neighbors are. 
He notices the way Pennsylvania (presumably 
Philadephia) drivers drive through the area in such a hurry, and 
believes that to be part of the lifestyle fostered by the 
anonymity of the big city. 
"Pineys" 
are inherently intelligent, even though they may 
be uneducated, and you can't put one over on them. "They have the 
'education' God gave them, 
in other words common sense." One old 
"Piney, who was a local 
hero but who passed away about 2 years 
ago, Mac Hyson, an old Cumberland woodhopper, who "lived like the 
Beverly Hillbillies" (according to Hawn). He was a great 
raconteur and storyteller, and although his stories 
sounded 
"tall," sooner or later someone would confirm that they were 
indeed true. 
He was also famous for his coffee, which "stained 
you going all 
the way down." 
To 
illustrate "Piney G—Cumberland; 38GT sense," he told a 
story about an encounter with a local auto salesman. 
He went 
into Woodbine to buy a pickup truck. 
While walking around the 
lot he looked at a Ford truck, which seemed to be an F100. 
His 
friend with him told him, no, 
it was an F150. 
It turned out that 
the manufacturer had accidentally painted "F100" on one side and 
"F150" on the other. 
He preferred the 100, because it was a more 
"stripped—down" version, and so he thought he'd go 
in and talk to 
the salesman. 
The man was Italian G—Woodbine; 37GT and very high— 
pressure. 
Walt asked to buy the F100, and the man looked through 
his records, and insisted that he had no such vehicle on the lot. 
"What if I take you out and show you that F100, will you then 
sell 
it to me?" "Sure," the man said. They went out and looked, 
and he showed the salesman the side with "F100" painted on 
it. 
The guy then got "hot under the collar," and looked around, 
finally seeing the "F150" painted on the other side. 
Walt then 
pointed out several other flaws, and the fact that the truck had 
no spare tire. "Oh, you're one o' 
them 'Pineys!' You 'Pineys' are 
all alike," said the salesman, hoping he could shame Walt so he 
would cease dickering with him. "You're always trying to get 
something for nothing." 
They then went in to talk about price. 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 29 
Walt insisted that he'd better get a good deal, since the thing 
had so many flaws. 
When the Italian fellow finally came up with 
a price, Walt absolutely rejected it, 
saying that for $500 less 
than that price he could "go down to that little Dago at the GM 
dealer and get one with fancy chrome, fancy hubcaps, AM-FM radio, 
etc., but that he didn't want all 
those extras, just a basic 
pickup truck." 
The salesman rejected Walt's offer, and Walt 
said, "I've got five steps 'til I'm out of your door. 
In that 
time, you'd better give me a better offer, 
'cause once I'm out 
the door, I'm headng down to that little Dago at the GM dealer." 
"You 'Pineys' are all alike!," he continued. "You'll never get a 
better deal from him." Out the door Walt went and headed down to 
the other dealer. 
The "little Dago" was a young fellow, 
in his 
early twenties, but very knowledgeable--his father had started 
the business--and also honest and forthright. 
"You know you look 
for a guy who's got a few gray hairs for experience, but a young 
guy who grew up with the business, 
like he did, was just as good. 
So Walt bought the fancy truck for $800 less, and "felt like 
Frank Wheaton drivin' to work" 
in 
it. The next day the man from 
the Ford dealer phoned him to ask him if he had changed his mind. 
"No," he said, "I got the pickup with the fancy hubcaps and the 
AM-FM radio for $800 less." 
The salesman refused to believe him, 
saying that it was impossible. 
Walt then said, "I'll come down, 
bring the truck and the bill of sale, and if I ain't tellin' the 
truth, I'll buy you a big dinner in any restaurant you want, and 
I am tellin' the truth you have to buy me a dinner in any 
restaurant I want!" "You 'Pineys' are all alike," he repeated, 
and declined the offer. 
After this story, we got into a discussion on various 
topics, including sterotyping of "locals" in different places. 
Mrs, Warfle is from West Virginia, and Frank talked about 
visiting her relatives in the hills of West Virginia, where 
people are supposed to be "dumb hillbillies," and how they 
weren't any dumber than "Pineys," but that people up here thought 
they were, and that people up here thought they all went barefoot 
down there. 
Walt, who had also been down there, said that in 
some matters, such as taxation, the "hillbillies' seemed to be 
smarter. 
We also discussed regional accents, and how people in 
New York City think "Pineys" sound like they come from "down 
South," somewhere. 
Walt then told a story about a drive to 
Maryland to pick up his wife, who had been 
in Florida visiting 
relatives, and had caught a ride to Maryland, where she was 
supposed to meet him at a Howard Johnson's motel. He had just 
bought the truck discussed above, so he was ready to take his 
first big trip 
in 
it. 
He borrowed Mrs. Warfle's Thermos, tanked 
up and set out. He "felt like Frank Wheaton drivin' to work." 
On 
the way down, he tried to avoid U.S. Rte. 301 as much as 
possible, because of fear of traffic jams, even though that was 
where the HoJo's was located. 
Instead he ran into numerous 
delays caused by trains, a fire, an overturned truck, etc., and 
he broke the Thermos by 
letting 
it fall down while going around 
a corner, and just had the most miserable trip. Then he ended up 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 30 
getting a speeding ticket from a colored trooper, right while he 
was 
in a line of cars and trucks all going the same speed. 
When 
the trooper read him the 
law and informed him of the violation, 
he spoke perfect English, "like Lincoln deliverin' the Gettysburg 
Address. 
If gou'd'a had your eyes closed, you'd'a thought he was 
white. 
After accepting the ticket (for $40), he asked the 
trooper for some directions. Immediately he 
lapsed into a heavy 
"colored dialect," "Well, man, ya goes this way...," and so on. 
That showed Walt how people could have different accents for 
different occasions. 
After the interview, I drove to Millville to look for a 
Toyota wiper blade, which I couldn't find, so I went on 
into 
Vineland and got one there. On that trip, I noticed the amazing 
contrast in the landscape outside the Reserve boundary. 
In 
Millville and Vineland, most of the undeveloped land 
is 
intensively cultivated with produce.

Drove to Pickle Factory Lake near Eldora to 
interview 
Herschel Beebe, N.J. State conservation officer for the southern 
counties. 
I taped the interview and it can be found on RLOG004-
5. After the interview, I decided to drive along Rte. 47, down to 
the southern extremity of our area, which is bordered on the 
south by Bidwell Creek. 
Along the way, I stopped and 
photographed Bohm's Sod Farm 
G—North Dennis; 34GT ("Instant 
Lawns") between Eldora and North Dennis. 
I also passed by a 
sign, just east of Dennisville, advertising live crabs, 
G—Dennisville; 34GT 20 for $1. 
The landscape along that area is 
heavily dominated, to the right (south) of highway 47, by huge 
marshes that extend all 
the way to the shore. 
As one proceeds further into lower Dennis and upper Middle 
Townships, there start being an increasing number of produce 
farms G—Dennisville; 34GT G—South Dennis; 34GT G—Goshen; 35GT. 
They 
seem to be relatively small and they all have elaborate roadside 
stands along a road heavily traveled by Cape May—bound tourists, 
so 
it can be assumed that they are growing produce to sell at 
their stands. 
Some of the marshes in 
lower Dennis Twp. seem to 
have a different variety of vegetation that may reflect burning 
to control vegetation that competes with salt hay. 
According to Beebe, the main landing place for commercial 
crabbers G—Reeds Beach; 35GT is Reeds Beach, which is just a few 
miles south of the CAFRA boundary. The southern boundary is 
Bidwell Creek. 
Right where State Hwy. 47 crosses Bidwell Creek, 
there 
is a small harbor, which the map calls Nancy's Harbor, and 
which is 
identified by a rusty old road sign as Bidwell Ditch. 
Here there are tied up, 
on both sides (north and south, CAFRA and 
non—CAFRA), a number of commercial fishing vessels. G—Bidwell 
Ditch/ Nancy's Harbor; 35GT I talked to a few recreational boaters 
there, and they called it Bidwell Ditch. 
One of them does some 
personal—use crabbing, but there were no commercial fishermen 
present. 
I went around on the dock photographing garveys and other 
commercial fishing boats. 
G—Bidwell Ditch/ Nancy's Harbor; 35GT 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 32 
On the docks were a number of commercial—sized crab pots, and 
several wound—up gill nets. Similar fishing gear was strewn about 
in some of the boats. 
In back of the harbor, on the creek 
itself, was a large, ca. 35—foot fishing boat rigged with a 
hydraulically powered reel, which, according to the guys on the 
dock, was used for hauling in gill nets I also photographed it. 
On the highway, right by the bridge, was a little supply shop, 
selling bait, tackle, etc., and having signs advertising "squid," 
and one advertising "fishing stories." 
The proprietor was 
allegedly at home, and allegedly taking his afternoon nap. 
I 
knocked a few times, and then decided not to press my 
luck. 
Down St. Hwy. 47 about 1/2 mile, just by the road leading 
off to Reeds Beach, was a commercial crabber's G—Reeds Beach; 35GT 
house, shop, shed, tanks etc. 
It also had signs on the lawn 
advertising "crabs" and "live crabs." 
Because I was pressed for 
time, and because he was outside of the CAFRA area, I didn't stop 
to talk to him. Back at the dock, I found out that he tied up at 
Bidwell Ditch/ Nancy's Harbor, so I'll probably go back & try to 
get an interview. 
I then drove back via the Garden State Parkway, 
in order to 
save time, because I wanted to get back here to talk to Mary 
Hufford, who's back at hq. today.

At 6 a.m., Joe Czarnecki and I drove down to Middletown, 
on State Hwy. 50, Upper Twp. (just south of Corbin City) to 
photograph and record yam harvesting G—Middletown; 36GT at the farm 
of Leonard Migliaccio, Sr. (Mr. Migliaccio is also the mayor of 
Corbin City.) 
We arrived about 7:15, after stopping to photo— 
graph a pond at sunrise between Green Bank and Weekstown. 
As we arrived, we were told, by a neighbor, that Mr. M. 
and 
some temporary farm laborers 
were already at work. 
As we got 
out in the field, we saw a tractor pulling a harvesting machine, 
rows of vegetable crates spread over the field, and three 
Hispanic farm laborers--two of them following the tractor— 
harvester and picking up the yams--and one of them riding on the 
harvester freeing up the vines as they tangled up 
in the machine. 
Joe went around photographing while I set up the Nagra and 
got some sounds of the harvest G—Middletown; 36GT, plus a bit of 
information from Mr. M. 
and his hired people. 
(His hired people 
did not want to reveal their names.) Check RLOG—RJL006 for a log 
of the tape. As I was about to put the Nagra away, and as I 
waited for Joe to finish the photographing, Homer Ellison, a 
neighbor of the Migliaccios, came up and started talking about a 
number of subjects. 
This also appears on RJL006. 
Unfortunately, 
the fidelity of this "interview" 
is probably not up to snuff, as 
I wasn't prepared to 
interview and the mikes were just lying on 
the hood of the car. 
TX02: We left at about 10 a.m., and drove to Woodbine, where I 
contacted Msgr. Roberth Ervin (the "h" belongs in his first name, 
but is not pronounced), pastor of St. Casimir's R.C. Church 
G—Woodbine; 37GT, to 
learn about ethnicity 
in the Woodbine area. 
Here 
is 
a summary of the notes that I took: 
Woodbine was once the most industrialized community in the 
area, but it 
lost most of 
its 
industry to the Sunbelt during the 
1970s. 
This happened right after a number of plants had been 
opened. 
The opening of these plants resulted in an influx of 
black 
and Hispanic 
outsiders, who came into the area in the 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 34 
late 1960s to work, but who only got about two or three years 
steady employment in Woodbine. 
Many of these folks have left, 
and many of them now swell the local welfare rolls, especially 
since the state has located a large low—income housing project in 
Woodbine. 
Today, the Woodbine Development Center, a residential 
institution for the mentally retarded, 
is Woodbine's principal 
employer. 
Other employers hanging on are a shirt factory between 
Woodbine and Estell Manor, a cloth—cutting shop, and a warehouse 
and shipping depot for Wheaton Industries' candlemaking 
operations. There is a big printing plant just outside of 
Woodbine, but they just went bankrupt and have started laying off 
their employees. Woodbine used to have several large working 
farms. 
There are now only two working farms there, both "you— 
pick" strawberry farms G—Woodbine; 37GT. 
Woodbine is now the most 
economically depressed 
community in South Jersey, according to 
Msgr. Ervin. 
St. Casimir's was founded by Poles G—Woodbine; 37GT, and was, 
for years, a predominantly Polish 
parish. The parish encloses a 
wide rural area surrounding Woodbine, not just Woodbine itself. 
Woodbine was, of course, founded as a more or less utopian 
agricultural community by Jewish 
refugees from Tsarist Russia. 
They were followed by Poles G—Woodbine; 37GT, who settled the the 
western outskirts of town. 
The community also received an 
influx 
of Italians , but gradually, as most of the initial Italian 
settlement G—Belleplain; 34GT in the area was 
in Belleplain. There 
was also a gradual 
influx of blacks , mostly working class, 
upwardly mobile, so that by the 1960s, Woodbine had a small 
solidly middle class black 
community. 
After the influx of 
outsiders in response to the late—'60s industrializing and the 
building of low—income housing, the black 
community, 
unfortunately, came to be stigmatized with many of the socio— 
economic pathologies typical of chronically unemployed big—city 
ghetto—dwellers. Woodbine had, from the 1960s through about 1980-
81, a substantial Hispanic 
population, almost entirely Puerto 
Rican . Many of these have now left, either to go to the big city 
once more or, 
in many cases, back to Puerto Rico. Most of the 
early Puerto Rican arrivals came as migrant farm laborers, who 
eventually stayed. 
There are now, according to the Woodbine Board of Education, 
only about 40 Hispanic 
families in the Woodbine school district, 
where there were once several hundred. There was, for a time, a 
Spanish—speaking 
assistant pastor at St. Casimir's, but now they 
have a priest come in from Camden once a week to say a Spanish 
G—Woodbine; 37GT mass. 
According to Msgr. Ervin, the more or less permanently 
settled Puerto Ricans 
in Woodbine seem to "be fighting a 
cultural 
identity problem," with the more ambitious and upwardly 
mobile members trying to shed their identity, or simultaneously 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 35 
trying to shed and preserve it, whereas the identity remains 
strongest among the more transient or marginal community members. 
One of the chief problems among the Puerto Ricans G—Woodbine; 
37GT is a unanimous dropout rate among boys in high school. 
Not a 
one ever graduates, although some eventually get high school 
equivalency diplomas. 
The girls stay 
in school 
longer, and often 
graduate. 
In one case, an extremely gifted young woman was 
offered some valuable scholarships to continue on to college, and 
it took a great deal 
of effort on Msgr. Ervin's part to convince 
her father to allow her to attend college. The most knowledgeable 
clergyman in the area regarding Hispanic culture is, according to 
Msgr. Ervin, Msgr. William Reynolds, pastor of St. Raymond's R.C. 
Church in The Villas (Cape May Co.) 
This is because he was, for 
years, 
in charge of the Spanish Apostolate in the Camden Diocese. 
Another person who has made it her business to become 
knowledgeable in Hispanic G—Woodbine; 37GT affairs in the area is 
(Ms.) Marion Olson of the Cape May County Agricultural Extension 
Service. 
The individual exercising the most leadership 
in the 
Hispanic 
community is Ricardo "Ricky" Rodriguez (861-2222), 
chief of the Woodbine Ambulance Corps. 
His sister, who moved 
back to Puerto Rico during the latest recession, had an even more 
visible leadership role, and she was known, at least to non— 
Hispanics, as the "queen of the Puerto Ricans 
in Woodbine." Both 
Mr. Rodriguez and his sister were, for a time, very active in a 
local chapter of 
las Cursillistas, a Hispanic 
Catholic 
"Christian renewal" group. 
This group is not now as active as 
it 
was when she was in town, but it evidently still exists. 
Woodbine is, according to Msgr. Ervin, a community in which 
the white population is rapidly declining, and in which, 
proportionately, the black 
population is 
increasing. 
Practicallly all of the whites in Woodbine today are senior 
citizens on Social Security or other pensions. 
The Woodbine 
Elementary School had only two or three white kids 
in their last 
spring's "graduating" class. 
St. Casimir's used to have a very active social program for 
its parishioners. 
This started to decline as the church ended up 
being made up of old whites and young non—whites. 
The last time 
they tried to have a barbecue G—Woodbine; 37GT (a few years ago) 
only six or seven people showed up. 
Socializing among the old Polish 
community now occurs only 
at an occasional wedding (usually young people who moved away and 
then came back just to get married in the old parish church) or a 
not—so—occasional funeral. For information on the Polish 
community, Msgr. Ervin suggested we contact the following 
individuals: Frank Yarrish, on Cedar Ave., a Polish immigrant 
retiree; Mr. Cheeseman, president of the Woodbine Board of 
Education, whose mother, still alive, was one of the original 
Woodbine Polish immigrants G—Woodbine; 37GT; 
Teresa Flaczek 
(spelling?), secretary of the Board of Education, whose mother 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 36 
(still 
living) was also one of the old immigrants ; and Annie 
Kubrak, on Cedar Ave., former housekeeper for the parish--also an 
old Polish immigrant G—Woodbine; 37GT. 
Msgr. Ervin says that the lack of socializing started as 
far back as the 1950s when television became ubiquitous. 
One of 
the best things that ever happened was the hurricane of 1962, 
when salt spray shorted out everybody's tv antennas. 
At that 
time people actually walked around town to find other people to 
talk to! 
(Woodbine, being the highest ground in the area, was 
then used as the evacuation point for storm refugees from the 
coast.) 
One of the most active socializing organizations in the 
area is the Tri—County "WoWs" (Widows—or—Widowers). 
Woodbine has a relatively high crime rate for a small 
community, and there have been six or seven very serious violent 
crimes in town in the last few years. 
This reputation keeps 
outsiders from doing their shopping there, which has caused many 
retail businesses to fail. 
Around the mid-1970s, Woodbine also 
experienced a race riot. G—Woodbine; 37GT There was evidently a 
tire—slashing incident, which resulted in a fight between a black 
and a Puerto Rican. 
After the Puerto Rican was injured, and the 
black arrested, an angry crowd of Puerto Ricans tried to storm 
the Borough Hall to take the prisoner away from the then—police 
chief, a man known for his impetuousness and poor judgement. 
Rather than transfer the prisoner to the County Jail, he insisted 
that "I'll defend my prisoner to the end!," and the State Police 
"S.W.A.T. team" had to come 
in and break up the situation. 
Soon 
after this incident, the Woodbine Borough Police Department was 
abolished, and the area now receives police protection from the 
N.J. State Police at their Cape May Court House station. 
Woodbine also has an unfortunate reputation for political 
strife. 
The Democrats and Republicans (practically all 
older 
whites, 
in both cases) do not cooperate, and hardly even speak to 
each other. 
Most Borough Council meetings end up 
in unproductive 
arguments. 
The Ambulance Corps G—Woodbine; 37GT split up 
into two 
rival units, with one of them going under soon after. 
Even the 
Volunteer Fire Co. 
has often been so strife—ridden that it was 
unable to function. 
It has, however, recently been reorganized, 
and 
is reportedly recovering its abilities to perform its duties. 
Woodbine supposedly has a severe drug—abuse problem, 
especially in the schools, and the Ambulance Corps 
has at times 
been quite busy dealing with its consequences. 
The Italian 
G—Belleplain; 34GT G—Repiciville; 34GT, 36GT 
community is mostly located outside of Woodbine. 
For 
information, we should contact Lester, John, & Bernio Germanio in 
Belleplain; and the members of the Repici family, who live near 
the Belleplain Fire Tower on Belleplain Road, between Belleplain 
and Cape May Co. Rte. 548. 
This little community, which 
straddles the Dennis—Upper Township line, 
is 
locally called 
Repiciville. 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 37 
For additional 
information on Woodbine, Msgr. Ervin 
suggested that we contact Ed Meerwald, the Dennis Twp. Clerk, who 
is a Woodbine resident.

Drove to Mauricetown, Port Norris, and Bivalve. I drove down 
through Medford, Hammonton, Vineland, and Millville. 
Driving 
through Medford and Medford Lakes, I was appalled at the cuteness 
and manufactured quaintness of those areas. 
'huff said! 
Turning at the bridge to Mauricetown, the landscape 
immediately becomes maritime and there's acres and acres of 
marshland. 
Along the Maurice River Twp. shore there is a wharf 
with three large wooden oysterboats, probably over 50 feet long. 
They were the type with the built—in conveyor that transports the 
oysters from the dredge to the culling drum. 
So far, those three boats are the only real big oyster boats 
that I've seen on the Maurice River Twp. side of the Maurice 
River, excepting those in drydock at the Dorchester Shipyard 
G—Dorchester; 38GT. 
TX02: From here, I drove over the bridge, through G—Mauricetown; 
Commercial Twp.GT, upon whose dock you can get a good view of 
those oyster boats on the other side. 
From there, I headed on 
down through G—Port Norris; Commercial Twp.GT. 
This community 
seems to be predominantly black, especially the northern suburbs. 
There's a large yellow—sandstone black church north of town, 
Faith Tabernacle Church. 
Both Port Norris and Mauricetown have 
lots of 
large Victorian—eclectic houses. There are also a number 
of the two—story, one—room—deep South Jersey folk houses (lower 
case "i—houses?"), especially in the black suburbs. Port Norris 
has one large oyster packing plant, on the shore of the Maurice 
River. 
There are 
three roads that connect Port Norris with the 
oyster docks at G—Shell Pile and Bivalve; Commercial Twp.GT. 
There, there are a number of 
large oyster packing plants, some 
active and some abandoned. 
Shell Pile has only one active plant, 
and a number of abandoned ones, whereas Bivalve seems to have the 
most activity. 
At Bivalve, there are also the N.J. State Police, 
Marine Police; the Rutgers University Shellfish Research Station; 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 39 
and the N.J. Dept. of Environmental Protection, Shell Fisheries 
Div. office. 
There is a long, rather picturesque, wooden— 
clapboarded building right on the wharf that serves as a packing 
house for several oyster packing companies, and also as the hq. 
for the Marine Police. 
Rutgers and the Shell Fisheries Div. are 
set up in a hypermodern building next door. 
At the end of the 
road, there is the Bivalve Marina, and a tavern, the Marina Bar, 
which is black owned and operated, and has mostly black 
customers, but a few whites as well. 
In Bivalve itself 
is a small, rather broken—down—looking 
black church called "The Supreme Council of the House of Jacob of 
the U.S.A., Inc." 
It listed as its pastor 
Pres. Elder A. Chin 
(Andrew Chin, according to the phone book) 785-0448 (a Port 
Norris phone no.) 
I'll contact him for permission to record. It 
has services Tues. & Fri. night, 8 p.m. and Sun., 
11 a.m. and 8 
p.m. 
TX03: At this point, 
it was quite late 
in the evening (I had 
gotten a late start), so I headed back to Lebanon State Forest. 
I drove back part of the way from Port Elizabeth 
to Corbin City 
on Co. Hwy. 548. 
I was impressed by the wildness of this stretch 
of road. 
There are miles and miles of woods and abandoned 
cranberry bogs G—Maurice River Twp.GT G—Upper Twp.GT, and a huge 
abandoned cranberry—packing plant, Eatmore Cranberry Co., which 
is probably the one that went out of business after the 1960s 
pesticide scare. 
It looked like 
it had stood empty that long. 
There is, believe it or not, not a single house for a distance of 
between 9 and 10 miles! 
At the time I was driving it, a fog was 
rolling in from the west, and the place looked spooky as hell. 
There was also no other traffic going 
in either direction, until 
I got on to State Hwy. 49 just before Corbin City.

Once again, I drove to the the Maurice River area. This 
time, I headed straight for the Rutgers Shell Fisheries Research 
Station office. G—Bivalve; Commercial Twp.GT 
There I looked up Dan 
O'Connor (Rutgers Shellfish Research Lab, Bivalve, P.O. Box 587, 
Port Norris, NJ. 08349 609 785-0074), one of their biologists, 
per the advice given to me a few days ago by Mr. VanNest, the 
Whitesbog conservationist—guy. 
O'Connor was extremely helpful, 
and we ended up 
in an informal meeting with O'Connor, two other 
employees, D.E. Kunkle , C.A. Phillips, and Joe DoBarro, office 
supervisor for the licensing services of the N.J. E.P.D.'s Shell 
Fisheries Div. 
Kunkle seemed to be the most established guy 
in 
the area (I think he's from there, or, at least he has lived 
there for a long time) but all 
of them gave me advice and leads. 
They also got me in contact by phone with Stu Tweed, Marine 
Extension Advisory Agent, N.J. Marine Advisory Service, Cape May 
Co. Extension Office, Dennisville Rd., Cape May C.H., NJ. 08210, 
(609) 465-5115, whom I'll pay a vist to on 
Monday the 17th. 
He's supposed to be even more knowledgeable than they are about 
baymen and their activities. 
First of all, they informed me that there is an 
anthropologist, Larry Taylor, Dept. of Anthropology, Lafayette 
College, Easton, PA. 
18042, who has, over the past 2 years, done 
an extensive amount of interviewing of baymen, for a book on the 
anthropology of Jersey fishing communities. 
Taylor is reputed to 
have 
in his possession interviews with practically every bayman 
around Delaware Bay. 
He has also done the same along Long Island 
Sound, and U. 
of Penn. Press is reportedly publishing his Long 
Island Sound study in book form soon. 
Here are the contacts that they recommended as probably 
being the most productive: 
Oyster—shuckers Joe Gibb and friends (They have of course already 
been dealt with at length by Rita Moonsammy and Mary Huford). 
Bayman Fenton Anderson of Port Norris. 
Bob Morgan (actually Robert C, Morgan, Jr.,) supervisor of 
Wheaton Industries' Dorchester Shipyard G—Dorchester; 38GT. 
He's 
described as more of a businessman than a bayman, but a good lead 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 41 
into the oysterers and boatbuiders community. 
He's also with the 
Port Norris Oyster Co. (another Wheaton venture). 785-1242. 
They 
suggested that I have Morgan get me 
in touch with one of his 
oysterboat captains, Capt. Jimmy Gale, who works out of 
Dorchester. 
Oyster marketer G—Heislerville; 38GT Aaron "Ron" Peterson, 
Heislerville. 
Oysterboat captain G—Heislerville; 38GT, farmer, and boatbuilder 
G—Heislerville; 38GT Capt. Lou Peterson, on School House Lane, 
Heislerville. 
Bob Bailey, lives on corner of State Hwy. 47 and the road to 
Mauricetown (I guess that would actually be 
in Bricksboro) and 
has that Bailey's Seafood G—Bricksboro; 38GT, gas station, and flea 
market there, which he's trying to unload. 
He and his brother, 
John Bailey (who lives near the Port Elizabeth post office) are 
oystermen G—Bricksboro; 38GT G—Port Elizabeth; 38GT and seafood— 
marketers, and still very much in business, 
in spite of the 
appearance of the place in Bricksboro. 
The Dorchester Shipyard G—Dorchester; 38GT in Dorchesrter is 
reputedly full of boatbuilders. 
Clarence "floppy" Hoffman of Leesburg, boatbuilder G—Leesburg; 
38GT built a 40—foot oyster boat right on the dock at Bivalve. 
He 
now works for Bivalve Packing Co. 
Joe Buzby, of Cold Springs, 
is a bayman G—Leeds Point; 09GT, 
and he works as a boat captain for the N.J. E.P.D. Div. of Water 
Resources in Leeds Point. 
John Hays, who now lives 
in Millville, was for years a 
bayman G—Delmont; 38GT and net—fisherman working out of Delmont. 
Leroy "Webby" Webb, who now lives 
in Mauricetown, by the 
fire co., on 2d & Noble Sts., 
is an old Heislerville bayman 
G—Heislerville; 38GT and a "good talker." 
George Campbell of Eldora is a crabber G—Eldora; 34GT and 
general bayman. 
Fred Layton, from near Eldora is 
an active net—fisherman 
[Eldora; 34GT. 
David Lee of Heislerville, ran Sam Peterson's shucking house 
G—Heislerville; 38GT for years. 
Burdell Schubert of The Villas, on Cape May, 
is an old 
waterman, and would be a good life—history source. 
Lawrence Bohm, owner of Bohm's Sod Farm G—Eldora; 34GT, which 
his son operates, 
is a retired waterman. 
That completes the 
list I got from O'Connor, Kunkle, Phillips, 
and DoBarro. 
O'Connor also offered me sleeping space in the 
lab's dormitory, pending approval by the lab director, who 
returns from Sweden on Friday the 14th. 
TX02: After this meeting, I decided to explore the Marina Bar in 
Bivalve, a predominantly black establishment. 
While I was 
in 
there, the barmaid was ejecting a local young man who had been 
banned from setting foot on the property for his violent 
tendencies, and this was causing quite a scene. 
The other 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 42 
customers commented on how he receives "a check every month for 
being crazy." 
He threatened to come back and murder everybody 
there, employees, patrons, etc., and his protests were full 
of 
picturesque obscenities of the "mo'fo'k" type. 
Luckily the soda— 
truck driver offered him a lift back up to Port Norris, so he was 
gone before the barmaid had to call 
"the Man." The bar has no 
oysters or other shellfish on the menu--fried fish and shrimp are 
the only seafood offered. 
Dan O'Connor had said that it was 
almost impossible to find a place that served shellfish in the 
Maurice River area, because pople didn't usually eat it, they 
just worked it. 
He told me that I could buy shucked oysters by 
the pint at the oyster—house next to the lab, so I went in and 
bought two pints at $3.50 a pint. 
TX03: From there, I drove over to Dorchester to have a look at 
the Dorchester Shipyard [Dorchester; 38GT. 
In their drydock were 
two large oysterboats, the new "Robert C. Morgan," a 75—foot 
steel craft, and a large wooden oysterboat at least as long, that 
was up for repairs. 
The place had just closed for the day, so I 
didn't get a chance to talk to anybody. 
TX04: From here I drove back, again via Co. Hwy. 548 from Port 
Elizabeth to Corbin City. While in the middle of the uninhabited 
stretch, I noticed 
a large graffito G—Maurice River Twp.GT painted 
in the middle of the highway, "B.B. YOU BETTER RETIRE.' This was 
obviously one of the graffiti to which conservation officer 
Herschel Beebe had referred in my 3 Oct. 
interview (see RLOG 
RJL004). 
I got out and photographed it from the roof of my car.

Shingles or boards 
cut from a mined log could last 80 
to 100 years of use, whereas regular cedar was only good for 30 
or 40 years. 
Cedar log mining was practiced primarily by farmers 
during the winter season. 
Much of the lumber used 
in 
Independence Hall, Philadelphia, was mined cedar from South 
Jersey. No one purposely mines cedar logs today, but sand mining 
companies occasionally turn up a few. 
George knows a man who 
recently built a set of kitchen cupboards from buried cedar logs 
G—Port Elizabeth; 38GT found at a sand mine near Port Elizabeth. 
What has always fascinated Mr. Brewer was thinking about how 
those logs got down there in the first place. 
He believes that 
they must all 
have fallen at once and then been covered over 
immediately. 
He dismisses the possibility of a hurricane, as it 
wouldn't be strong enough. 
A tornado might be strong enough, but 
it wouldn't cover a wide enough area. 
He believes that it had to 
have been either a tidal wave or a meteorite landing. 
Most of the information 
that I received from George Brewer 
can be seen on RLOGs RJL007, 008, 009, and 010. The last of these 
(RJL010) 
is a walking tour of the sawmill area G—Dennisville; 34GT 
On Tuesday, 18 October, we are scheduled, weather permitting, to 
go with George and his partner deep into one of the most 
inaccessible parts of the Great Cedar Swamp to cut cedar, which 
we will then haul back to the mill 
in Dennisville and saw 
into 
lumber . 
TX02: Later in the day, I drove to Heislerville to meet Capt. Lou 
Peterson, an old—time bayman G—Heislerville; 38GT. 
Because my 
session with George Brewer had lasted a lot longer than I had 
expected, I was much later than I had planned to be (about 4:30 
p.m. 
instead of 2 p.m.), and I was almost out of tape, having 
only one 1/2—hour reel 
left. 
Meeting Mr. Peterson, I knew right 
away that he was a good interview prospect, so we made an 
appointment to meet again on Wednesday, 19 October, provided that 
he 
isn't called out to skipper on that day. 
Driving into Lou Peterson's yard, I was immediately struck 
by the sight of a large, completely open garvey 
perched on a 
boat trailer. 
I didn't get a chance to measure it, but it must 
have been at least 35 feet long, had a diesel engine enclosed by 
a box. 
It was not decked over, nor did 
it have a pilot house, 
but because of 
its size, 
it was pretty obvious that it was a 
serious working boat that probably went out pretty deep into the 
bay. 
Mr. Peterson presented himself as being "between jobs" and 
preoccupied with doing some restoration on his house. 
He 
described himself as "one of those people who are too lazy to 
have a regular job," so 
instead he does a little of this and a 
little of that--oystering, clamming, net fishing, farming, 
boatbuilding, boat repairing, and ships carpentry, etc. 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 45 
He indicated that he had been skipper 
of his own oyster 
boat 
until about 3 years ago, when a couple of bad seasons 
forced him so far into debt that he had to sell his boat . Later 
on he told me that he believed it was because a "green" captain 
hired by one of the packing houses had dredged his newly—planted

Evidently the guy 
is retired, but he's sent 
the boat he used for so many years, and can 
unload it even though he doesn't use it any 
obstacle is the fact that Lou no 
longer has 
license, which goes with the boat, and which he thus lost when he 
lost the boat 
In order to get his license he has to have a 
boat, and be a "historical participant" 
in the oyster industry, 
and not have been out of oystering for 3 years or more. 
This 
rule may prove a dificulty, but he thinks that he can surmount it 
because of his relationship with the packing company. 
Lou Peterson is very bitter about what he feels are the 
policies of the big oystering companies that are forcing "the 
little guys" out of business. 
He feels that most of the 
restrictive laws and regulations that have been passed in 
recent 
years have been passed by the Legislature because of pressure and 
outright bribes on the part of the big oystering companies, whom 
he considers guilty of base greed, and unwilling to tolerate any 
operations that they cannot control. 
He considers them totally 
corrupt, selfish, and cynical, and says that 4 out of the 7 seats 
on the Shell Fish Commission are representatives of the big 
companies. 
Wheaton Industries is the leading of these. 
They own 
and operate the Dorchester Shipyard G—Dorchester; 38GT, and several 
large packing plants, plus a number of 
large oyster boats. 
Robert C. Morgan, who manages the shipbuilding 
and oystering 
operations of the Wheaton company, he considers the epitome of 
the oyster big—businessman. 
He does, however, recommend that I 
talk to Morgan and get him to 
let me go out on one of the 
company's oyster boats, so that I can hear and see what 
modern 
oystering 
is 
all 
about. He said that Morgan is more than likely 
to 
let me go out on one of his boats, as he's very industry— 
image—conscious, and last week he had the governor of New Jersey 
out on one of his boats. 
He showed me a list of all 
the 
oystermen in the area who had lost their licenses under the 3— 
year—rule in 
recent years, and attributed it to the fact that 
they couldn't stay in business under the new rules that favored 
the few big operators. 
When I told him about the Pinelands Project, he went into 
his own personal gripe about the Pinelands Commission. 
The land 
on which he lives was his father's before him, and his father had 
farmed G—Heislerville; 38GT it. 
It 
is his intention to do some 
fruit and berry farming and he was told that because it 
is 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 46 
Pinelands Nat'l Reserve territory, he needed all 
kinds of permits 
to clear the land of brush, put in new bushes and fruit trees, 
etc. 
Of course the Pinelands Commission denied every request 
much to his chagrin, and passed on his requests to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Administration, who were even more 
restrictive. 
It was not until about a year later, that while 
looking at a new map of the area, he realized that the Pinelands 
boundary came right to his property line, but obviously excluded 
his 
land. 
He contacted an attorney who told him to go ahead and 
do anything as 
long as 
it wasn't against any township ordinance. 
So now he has cleared the land and 
is planning to put in his 
plantings. 
Lou Peterson is an old bayman G—Heislerville; 38GT as were his 
father and grandfather before him. 
He has done all 
of the usual 
bayman 
things, 
including the various fishing, shellfishing, 
boatbuilding, and small—time farming . He took me out in his 
workshop where he had just finished fabricating a net reel 
which 
he was going to mount on his garvey 
to haul 
in gill 
nets. We 
talked a bit about gill netting, and he told me that he had a 
number of them hung to float 4, 6, 
8, 
and 12 feet in the water, 
depending upon water conditions and species sought. 
Much of his 
gill—netting 
is done for weakfish, spots, and once a season, for 
large shad 
as they come up the Maurice River estuary. 
His tool shed 
was quite interesting inside (it was 
basically just a prefab garage). 
He had a number of 
large power 
tools for woodworking , table saws, a radial saw, etc. 
He also 
had a large old machinist's lathe, which he used for fabricating 
metal parts for engines, propeller shafts, etc. 
He had a 
shipwright's tool chest 
used to sit on while caulking 
("corking," he pronounced it), 
It was the type that has canvas 
seat, and rockers underneath so that one can sit facing up, while 
caulking 
the planking, and facing down while caulking 
the deck. 
In 
it were wads of oakum, caulking hammers, and caulking chisels 
(their names are probably different and I'll correct them later.) 
After we toured the workshop, we went into the house, where 
he continued his complaints against the oystering policies, and 
explained how he had more or less been driven out of the 
business. 
The contents of all 
of these discussions are 
summarized above. I made a tentative appointment to come back and 
interview him on Wednesday 19 October, provided that he's not 
called out to skipper, which he does on a substitute basis. 
TX03: I then drove back, taking the road through Belleplain. 
I 
passed through the area that Msgr. Roberth Ervin (pastor of St. 
Casimir's R.C. Church, Woodbine) called "Repiciville." 
It 
consists of a group of houses surrounding the Belleplain State 
Forest fire lookout tower. 
Several of them have large truck 
gardens G—Repiciville; 34GT, 36GT, which seemed to have been touched 
by frost, and which are pretty well used up for the season. 
Because it was very late 
in the day, the shadows were falling in 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 47 
such a way as to provide a pleasing set of shadows and contrast, 
so I climbed the fire tower and photographed their layout. 
There 
was a stiff breeze up 
in the 150—foot tower and I was scared out 
of my wits, especially since there was no fencing or hardware— 
cloth, just open space and a thin railing. 
TX04: On the way home I saw and photographed a huge billboard 
advertising the Smithsonian's 1983 Festival of American Folklife 
and 
its N.J. component, just outside of Corbin City. 
Around 
Estellville, I picked up a hitchhiker who was going to 
Philadelphia. 
I drove him all 
the way to the St. Hwy. 70 & 72 
traffic—circle. 
He had worked all 
summer in Wildwood unloading 
commercial fishing boats G—Wildwood; 35GT, mostly of weakfish, 
which he called "weakies," and bluefish. 
He enjoyed being in 
Wildwood, but said that the cost of rent was so high that it took 
practically all 
of the money he earned. 
He was probably about 
20, 
lived 
in Philadelphia, and some of his relatives had summer 
places on Cape May.

I drove down to Cape May Court House to talk to Stew 
Tweed, Marine Extenson Agent of the Sea Grant Extension Service 
of Cape May County. 
When I phoned him upon arrival 
in Cape May 
Court House, he first suggested that I go over to the Cape May 
County Public Library and see Tom Leonard, the library direcor or 
Barbara Crossan, his secretary, about a series of oral histories 
of baymen that the library had gotten a grant from the N.J. State 
Historical Commission to do. The interviews themselves were 
conducted by Stew Tweed and several others. 
Mr. Leonard showed 
them to me, and I sat down and gave them a cursory examination. 
There are 16 of them, totalling 350 pages of transcriptions. 
All 
but 2 are with retired "old timers," in other words, only three 
of them are still active baymen. 
7 of them are Swedes, and one 
of them is 
an Italian. 
The Swedes represent two Swedish

The Cape May County Library will copy these 
transcripts on 
request at cost. 
However Mary Hufford has worked out a deal 
whereby David Stanley Cohen will have the New Jersey State 
Historical Commission request copies of them, since they made the 
grant in the first place. 
Also in the possession of the library 
is a bound, mimeographed manuscript, with the following title 
page information: 
R. Craig Koedel. History Professor, Atlantic 
Community College, Following the Water: Commercial Shellfishing 
in South Jersey, With a Word on Old—time Whaling, prepared for A 
Historical/Cultural Presentation on Commercial Fishing/Scalloping 
in Southern N.J., Cape May County Library, Cape May Court House, 
N.J. [no date]. 
Mary suggested that we have them make a copy of 
this document for us. 
After my visit to the library, I went over to Stew Tweed's 
office at the County extension Services Building, and we talked 
about the project. 
He had made up a list of contacts whom he 
considered promising. 
Unfortunately, most of them were too far 
down 
in Cape May to be even near the Pinelands Nat'l Reserve 
jurisdiction, so he shortened the 
list considerably to consist of 
the following: 
Capt. Joe Busby, 3013 Shore Rd., Ocean View, NJ. 08230, a 
bagman G—Ocean View; 34GT G—Leeds Point; 09GT, who skippers for the 
N.J. Dept. of Environmental Protection's station at Leed's Point.

Stew Tweed also told me about 
several other individuals that 
I ought to know about: 
Bonnie McKay, an anthropologist in the Human Ecology Dept. 
at Cook College, Rutgers University, has done extensive work, 
including publication, on baymen G—Barnegat Bay; 42GT, 52GT, 54GT, 
56GT around Point Pleasant and Barnegat Bay, and has evidently 
published about same. 
One of her students is or was doing a 
thesis or dissertation on high—tech gear (such as LORANs) effect 
on the fisheries, and did some work 
in Delaware Bay, as well. 
There is an Ocean County Baymen's Association 
and the 
baymen in the Atlantic Coast bays are organized tightly by 
county, keeping people from outside of their county out. 
There 
is an office of the Shell Fisheries Division of N.J. 
E.P.D. at Nacote Creek 
in Port Republic, complete with license— 
branch that can supply names of Atlantic Coast baymen. 
Gef (Pronounced,"Jeff") Flimlin is Marine Extension Agent of 
the Sea Grant Extension Service office in Toms River. He works 
with Ocean Co. baymen G—Ocean Co.; 42GT, 43GT, 44GT, 45GT, 46GT,

TX04: From there I went back to the Rutgers Shell Fisheries Lab

They hadn't yet asked permission from the director, 
and were awaiting the right moment when he seemed to be 
in a good 
mood. 
He suggested that I call back on Wednesday. 
I told him 
that Joseph Czarnecki and I might want to stay there a night 
soon: the night before we go out on the oysterboat "Contender," 
so as to save two hours of sleep. 
I also asked for a map of the 
oyster grounds G—Maurice River Cove; 38GT like the one I saw on the 
wall 
in Bob Morgan's office. 
Dan said that they didn't yet have 
any updated ones, but he gave me 1981 one.

TXO1: Joseph Czarnecki and I arose at 6 a.m. and drove down to 
Dennisville to go cedar logging with George Brewer, Jr. and Leroy 
Creamer in the nearby Great Cedar Swamp. 
We arrived at Brewer's 
house at 8, just as he and Leroy were ready to leave for the 
swamp. 
George said that it was a a shame that I hadn't called 
him the night before to remind him, or he would have tried to 
talk Charlie Pomlear of Belleplain, a former employee of his, 
into going along. 
He described Pomlear as "a real Piney," 
clever, but uneducated, also "a real character," a storyteller 
and homespun philosopher. 
Pomlear now scavenges scrap metal at 
nearby dumps, and can often be found at the Dennis Twp. 
landfill 
in South Dennis. 
We piled into 2 trucks--Joseph and Leroy 
in a flatbed, and 
George & I in a dumptruck--loaded with broken concrete left over 
from some alterations made at Brewer's campground at Cedar Lake. 
We drove for several miles up to a northern portion of the swamp, 
which is across the township line 
in Upper Twp., then down a long 
fire road through the woods, to a place called Peach Orchard Road 
(hardly a road, at all). 
There we came to a clearing, where were 
parked two small bulldozers, two logging sleds, and a tree with a 
block and cable mounted on a limb. 
Nearby was a high—tension 
line course, which ran right through the swamp. 
Along the 
"road," the ground had just been getting wetter and wetter, but 
the clearing was relatively dry high ground. (All the while, I 
had the Nagra turned on, 
so George's and my conversation in the 
truck 
is 
recorded. 
See RLOG RJL011.) George placed a couple of 
pallets on one of the sleds for Joseph & I to stand on. 
They 
then hooked up the sleds to cables attached to the bulldozers 
(they always called the 'dozers "tractors"), started up the 
engines and we set off through the woods. 
At first, the ride was 
relatively civilized, through high ground surrounded by 
impenetrable laurel thickets, an area which "the Pineys" 
(according to George's son, Robert) call 
"Laurel City." 
George 
explained that this was due to the lack of any forest fires 
in 
the 
last few hundred years. 
Laurel and other brush is killed off 
by fire, whereas cedar quickly reseeds and gets a head start. 
After a while the road got extremely rough and the sled lurched 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 53 
along, bouncing from piles of cedar debris left there by George 
and Leroy to shore up the road, 
into 3 or 4 foot deep pools of 
liquid mud. 
Many times we were almost bucked off the sled, and 
several times the mud came up over the sled on to us, or splashed 
right in our faces and camera lenses. 
At one point, George 
stopped and told us, 
"From here on the road gets kind o' 
rough," 
which elicited ironic laughter from us, as we were already shaken 
to our bones and besplattered with stinky swamp mud. 
(Some of 
the sounds of this ride also appear on RJLO11.) 
After about 45 min., we arrived at a clearing, where a 
considerable quantity of cedar had already been out. The area was 
thickly strewn with cedar boughs, so we could walk around, 
although with some difficulty. 
Parked there was yet another 
small "tractor" (bulldozer), mounted with a Farmi brand (made in 
Finland) knuckle boom, for lifting logs on to the sled. 
George 
and Leroy started up chain saws and proceeded to fell about 20 or 
30 large cedars, making two cuts from opposite sides, so as to 
produce a "hinge" that prevented splitting and gave them some 
control over where the tree would fall. (Much of this noise 
appears on RJL011 and 012.) 
While wandering around, I managed to 
slip through the cedar—bough ground—cover twice and go 
into the 
mud about halfway up my shin. 
The next step was for George and Leroy to use their 
chainsaws to 
lop off the boughs. (This appears on RJL012.) 
After 
that we broke for lunch. 
Then George picked up a 12—foot pole 
(Not Joseph. He's only about 5'6".), which he calls a "pogie— 
pole," which he used to measure off 12—foot logs as they out them 
with the chain saw. 
George mentioned that such a pole 
is also 
called a "guess 'em stick." (This also appears on RJL012.) 
After that, they used the knuckle boom to load the 12—foot 
logs on to the sleds (RJL013), and we set off through the swamp, 
back to the clearing where the trucks were parked. Listening to 
the tapes later on, I became aware that the sound quality and 
presence suddenly declined drastically, and I figured out that it 
was due to a loss of power on the part of the battery in the SENN 
803, which I then replaced, although it was, of course, too late. 
The ride back was much smoother, due to the weight of the logs, 
and much drier, due to fact that we were now perched on a pile of 
logs about 8 feet off the ground. (This 
is also on RJL013, 
running into 014.) 
George explained how the power co. recently 
lost a large bulldozer in the swamp at the high—tension—line 
clearing, because it was just so heavy and the ground so soft. 
They were never able to retrieve it, and it's still down in the 
mud somewhere. 
Upon returning to the clearing, they used the block and 
cable and one of the small 
'dozers to load the logs on to the 
flatbed truck. (This part is on RJL014.) George dumped the broken 
concrete along the wet part of the road to help shore it up and 
we drove off. We got back to Brewer's sawmill 
in Dennisville at 
about 2:30 p.m.

TX01: I drove down to George Brewer, Jr.'s sawmill 
in 
G—Dennisville; 34GT to record sounds of the mill 
in operation (See 
RLOG—RJL1015). 
When I first arrived, Mr. Brewer was taking his lunch hour. 
After eating, we sat down and looked over the USGS "Topo—Quads" 
for the Great Cedar Swamp and surrounding area 
("Heislerville,""Sea Isle City," and "Woodbine"). George pointed 
out a number of the places he had earlier described. They are, as 
follows: 
"Heislerville" map: West Creek, a former community on Cape 
Road, northwest of Hands Millpond, just south of the creek of the 
same name (391434NO74542OW); Cedar Lake, new name for Hands 
Millpond (391434NO745407W). 
"Sea Isle City" map: Laurel City, a 
section of the Great Cedar Swamp (39122ON0744402W); Carcass 
Branch, a small creek or branch in the Great Cedar Swamp 
(391342NO744233W); Cattail Branch, 
ibid. (391342NO74424OW); 
Sackville, 
local alternate name for Greenfield (391342NO744222W). 
"Woodbine" map: 
Squeedunk, local alternate name for Cedar 
Grove (390945NO744601W); Double Pound Swamp, 
local alternate name 
for Timber and Beaver Swamp (390925NO744743W); Big Hickory, 
section of Great Cedar Swamp east of Delsea Dr., northeast of 
South Dennis, and between the gravel pit and Dennis Cr. 
(391044NO744854W); Burnt Causeway, a section of Great Cedar Swamp 
along Dennisville Rd, southeast of the sharp—angled turn of 
Dennisville Rd., and southeast of Woodbine Municipal Airport 
(391204NO74465OW); A Horse Hung Himself, a section of Great Cedar 
Swamp, south of Dennisville Rd. and Burnt Causeway, and east of 
Dennisville (39114ON0744675W); and Buzzard's Clump, a section of 
Great Cedar Swamp, just west & a little south of A Horse Hung 
Himself, and east of Dennisville (391135NO744744W). 
When we had 
finished with the maps, we went out to the mill. 
After we got over to the mill, a fellow was loading a load 
of cedar boards into the back of his station wagon. 
He was, of 
course, curious about the equipment, and I explained the project 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 56 
to him. 
He made some kind of a comment (I don't remember exact 
ly) about how there seems to be an inexhaustible supply of cedar, 
and that they can just keep cutting it and cutting it. 
The sawmill 
is set up with the shed containing the saw and 
its stationary diesel engine in the center; to the east is a pile 
of 
logs brought over by a forklift from the flatbed truck which 
has brought them back from the swamp. Also to the east is the 
carriage which carries the logs into the saw. 
Leroy rolls each 
log from the pile on to the carriage, and secures it with the 
help of several 
levers that control teeth that hold it 
in place. 
To the west of the saw is a conveyor which carries off the cut 
boards, planks, and slabs as they come out of the saw, and 
numerous piles of freshly—cut lumber of different dimensions. To 
the south is a pile of sawdust and a chain—operated conveyor 
which carries it out from the saw. 
Outside of the shed, to the 
northwest is a molder—matcher, which they use as a four—sided 
planer. 
In back of 
it, 
across the driveway, 
is a smaller planer, 
which they use for planing small 
lumber, one side at a time. On 
the extreme west of the lot 
is a broken—down shed containing the 
feather—edge mill, which they haven't used for years. That shed 
is used as a catch—all storage shed, and they are planning on 
dismantling it soon. 
The process goes like this: 
Leroy rolls a log on to the 
carriage and secures it. 
He then pulls a lever which adjusts the 
position of the log 
in relation to the saw, at first just enough 
to take off a slab and produce one flat side. 
He then pulls a 
lever which slides the log through the saw, and back to 
its 
original position. 
George shoves the slab down the conveyor, and 
then picks it up and tosses it 
into a slab—pile. 
Leroy, 
meanwhile, releases the 
log, turns it over, resecures it, 
and 
repositions it, sending it through the saw to produce a second 
slab and a second flat side. 
This 
is repeated twice to produce a 
squared—off timber. 
The squared—off timber is then repositioned 
several times (depending upon its thickness), each time going 
through the saw to produce a rough plank, each one of which 
George removes and stacks in the appropriate pile. 
Those planks 
closest to the corners of the squared—off timber are, 
if 
necessary, 
laid down horizontally on the carriage, and run through 
to take off strips of bark that may have been left on during the 
squaring—off process. 
Technology, wood. 
This process 
is repeated over and over again until a 
substantial pile of rough—cut lumber results. 
They are then 
carried, with the forklift, over to the molder—matcher to be 
planed, the molder—matcher having been set up to operate as a 
four—sided planer. 
Its stationary engine is turned on and Leroy 
feeds the planks, by hand, one by one, 
into the molder—matcher, 
which carries them through and drops them out on the other side, 
as smooth—planed boards. When a pile has accumulated, George 
picks it up with his forklift, carries it back to the main shed, 
and stacks the finished boards 
in the appropriate pile, unless it

TX01: Drove to G—Heislerville; 38GT to 
interview Louis Peterson. 
Mr. Peterson is a very loquacious individual and gave me three 
hours worth of taped interview (see RLOGs RJL016-22). The 
interview took place 
in his workshop, an aluminum prefab building 
strewn with tools (hand & power), engine parts, fishing gear, 
etc. 
He had just finished making a large net reel, 5 feet in 
diameter, mounted with an electric motor, for another bayman's 
garvey. 
He had several 
large power tools, 
including a radial 
saw, a machinist's lathe, and a table saw. 
He showed me several 
types of gill netting that are used for commercial fishing. 
All 
of them are made of nylon monofilament lease (webbing), which the 
fisherman purchases ready made. 
They are then hung on cork lines 
and lead lines, so that they will float vertically in the water. 
Like elsewhere, they are hung with a certain amount of slack 
(1/2, 1/3, 2/3, or 3/4) to facilitate entanglement of fish that 
come 
in contact. Since the baymen have gone over to using elec 
tric or hydraulic reels for hauling 
in the nets, the floats and 
leads have had their shape altered. 
Smaller, denser floats are 
used. 
Leads are long (3-4") and bullet—shaped, and can be inner 
ted into a braided line, rather than having to be fastened around 
the outside. 
Most of the worthwhile information from this 
interview is on RLOGs RJL016-22, qq.v. 
After the interview, Mr. Peterson brought down 3 pairs of 
oyster tongs from the rafters of the shop and took them outside 
where I could photograph them. 
They have three characteristic 
types of heads--wooden, barrel, and keyport, which can be seen 
in 
the photos (BLDG BJL216898-9: 21A-34A and CLOG CJL028: 14-20). 
Another interesting set of artifacts was Louis' caulking 
(locally pronounced "corking") tools. A small tool chest, about 
12x18" 
is mounted with rockers on the bottom and apiece of canvas 
on the top. 
The canvas constitutes the seat upon which the 
caulker sits reasonably comfortably & the rockers make 
it 
possibly for him to adjust the angle at which he 
is seated, 
according to whether he 
is caulking a hull, from inside or out; 
or a deck, from topside or below, merely by 
leaning at the 
appropriate angle. 
In the chest are stored the tools--36 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 59 
caulking irons of various shapes & sizes, and 2 steel mallets, 
used to pound the irons, 
in order to force the tow into the 
cracks & spaces between the boards and planks. 
After the taping & photographing sessions, I was invited to 
join the Petersons for supper. Supper consisted of a beef, carrot 
& onion stew, and at the table were Mr. & Mrs. Peterson, their 
daughter (quite pregnant) and their son—in—law. While we were 
eating, Louis told me about the historic nature of the oyster 
fleet, and how many of the vessels go back to the 19th century, 
when they were, of course, under sail. He has a book about the 
history of the Delaware Bay oyster fleet, but he has lent it to 
his daughter, who lives elsewhere, so I wasn't able to see 
it. 
(foodways). 
Oldest of the oyster schooners is reportedly the "Cashier," 
which is owned by McConnell's Oyster Co., and docks across the 
river at Shell Pile, just upriver from Bivalve. 
Mr. Peterson 
believes it to have been built as far back as the 1840s, a date 
which I am inclined to doubt, although I suppose anything is 
possible. 
Louis describes the "Cashier" as the oldest 
continuously operating work boat in the United States, a fact 
which he has derived from the book mentioned above. 
Louis also informed me of the origins of the name of the 
Maurice River. 
Supposedly some time during Colonial times, a 
Dutch East Indiaman, the "Prince Maurice," wrecked on a sandbar 
at the mouth of the river, thereby giving it 
its name. Parts of 
its wreck were 
supposedly still a navigation hazard well 
into 
the 
late 19th century. 
According to Peterson, 
large timbers of 
the type that would have been on such a vessel are periodically 
dredged from the ship channel 
in that vicinity.

TXO1: Today Elaine Thatcher & I drove to G—Dorchester; 38GT to 
document the launching of the new oyster dredge—boat, "Robert C. 
Morgan," at Wheaton Industries' 
Dorchester Shipyard. This 75— 
foot craft is 
reportedly the first new oyster boat to be launched 
in South Jersy in over 50 years. The launching was scheduled for 
10 a.m. and Elaine & I arrived at about 8:45. 
First we walked 
around Dorchester and took some photos of the street with the 
shipyard buildings on it, 
the Dorchester United Methodist Church, 
some of the local houses & yardscapes, and a number of stone 
walls that seemed to be characteristic of the area. 
Over at the shipyard, the "Robert C. Morgan" was mounted on 
its 
launching platform, which was set up with a speaker stand, 
and a bottle of champagne, wrapped in chicken wire, attached to a 
red, white, & blue ribbon for the christening. Around 9:30, a 
recording of martial music was fed into the p.a. system, and the 
crowd was fed a steady & repetitive supply of the strains of 
"Marine Hymn," "Off We Go, Into the Wild, Blue Yonder," 
"The 
Caisson Song," "Dixie," "Anchors Aweigh," and the like. A crowd 
was slowly forming and a barbecue—pit was set up and fired. 
Eventually, the people at the food area started serving hot dogs, 
hot chocolate (very welcome, as it was barely above freezing), 
cold beer (for which there was scarcely any demand) and apple 
pie. Bob Morgan (actually Robert C. Morgan, Jr.), who 
is the 
manager of Wheaton Industries' shipbuilding, marine hardware, and 
oystering operations on the Maurice River, dashed about making 
last—minute preparations. Present were a number of 
local 
politicians and other dignitaries. 
(foodways), (celebration). 
The "Robert C. Morgan" had a wooden staircase mounted 
starboard amidships, so that the public could climb aboard, which 
many of them did. 
It was possible to walk all over the fore and 
aft decks, the galley, the bridge, and the engine room. 
The 
foredeck was quite open, as 
it had not yet been mounted with 
dredging and sorting equipment and men, women & children seemed 
to be enjoying themselves immensely exploring the craft. 
The actual 
launching ceremony had to wait a bit longer than 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 61 
planned because the tide was still coming in after 10 a.m. The 
best time to 
launch 
is evidently at slack high tide. 
I set up 
the Nagra with the tip—to—tip mikes, and I started recording 
after I overheard Bob Morgan tell Frank Wheaton, "We're ready." 
The actual ceremony was relatively brief, beginning with an 
invocation by Rev. Benjamin Sooy of the Dorchester United 
Methodist Church, through the singing of the "Star Spangled 
Banner" by Betty Smith, and short speeches by Ed Salmon 
(President of Cumberland Co. Board of Freeholders), Charles 
"Chuck" Fisher (Director, Cumberland Co. Board of Freeholders), 
State Sen. James Hurley, and Frank H. Wheaton, Jr. (see RLOG— 
RJL022). After the speeches were over, Mrs. Robert C. Morgan, 
Sr., widow of the boat's namesake, and mother of Bob Morgan, 
broke the bottle of champagne over the bow. The people from 
Dorchester Shipyard (who had set up the p.a. system) and I 
quickly dashed up to remove the mike and cords from the launching 
platform, all 
of which slides down the ways into the river. 
I 
had just removed the mike stand to dry land and was tugging at 
the cables to get them back to terra firma, when I realized that 
none other than local millionaire Frank Wheaton had stepped in a 
loop and was about to either trip and fall or be dragged into the 
Maurice River. 
Quick response on my part saved the day and I got 
it unwound from the tycoon's ankle, thereby making it unnecesary 
for me to move to the Himalayas. 
At that point, a crane came over and removed the staircase 
from the "Robert C. Morgan," and the platform started sliding 
astern down the ways into the Maurice River. The loudspeaker of 
the "Robert C. Morgan" then announced that boat rides were 
available to groups of 25 to 30 passengers. 
As the boat got into 
water that was deep enough, 
it started engines and proceeded 
astern into the channel under its own power to the acompaniment 
of boatwhistles, sirens, and applause from shore. 
It then made a 
circle in the river and headed to the wharf to discharge its 
passengers and pick up a new group. 
People stood around talking, 
drinking hot cocoa (very little beer was consumed on account of 
the cold), and munching on hot dogs and pie. 
We didn't stay 
around as 
long as we probably should have because Sue S. and I 
had to go to Philly to the A.S.A. meeting that afternoon. 
TX02: On the way home, we drove part of the way via Cumberland & 
Cape May Co. Hwy. 548. 
This 
is the long deserted road that 
connects G—Port Elizabeth; 38GT to State Hwy. 49 west of Tuckahoe 
and which runs through miles of pine—oak forest and abandoned 
cranberry bogs. 
It 
is 
so covered with rubber from "dragging" and 
"peeling out," that it resembles an airport runway. 
No doubt it 
is 
its desertedness that inspires its use for such purposes. It 
is probably also its desertedness that inspires its use as a 
billboard for graffiti by poachers. 
Having a passenger in 
the 
car made it possible for us to spot some examples that I hadn't 
seen by myself before, and Elaine duly photographed "DEER DRIVE 
SEPT. 1," "DEER BAIT FOR SALE 
CALL HERSHELL," and "B.B. SUCKS

This, of course, represents the harassment of 
N.J.

in nearby 
Eldora. That entire area of northwest Cape May Co., southeast 
Cumberland Co., and southwest Atlantic Co. 
is prime poaching

Drove down to northern Cape May Co. On the way down, I 
stopped at R. Woodburn's Sea Food 
in Somers Point and bought some 
oysters and clams. 
From there, I headed over to the Dennis Twp. 
Landfill

who scavenges metal there. 
He used to be a logger and sawyer for 
George Brewer, Jr., and George recommended him as an

From there, I headed over to the home of George Campbell,

the east bank of West Creek. 
George Campbell 
is the leading salt 
hay farmer in Cape May County. Mr. Campbell 
is a very tall man, 
probably about 6'4", very intelligent, observant and articulate. 
Aside from his salt hay business, he also operates the only 
crabbing pay pond 
in the area, which he believes may be the only 
one anywhere. He raises ordinary hay ("fresh hay," he calls it) 
and operates a private gunning preserve, which he stocks with 
pheasant and chukar (a Western species of partridge). 
Well— 
heeled hunters pay big money for the chance to hunt alone for a 
day 
in a substantial section of the preserve, hunting birds which 
they have paid for and which George has released the night 
before. George also has been a builder (locally) and an oil 
driller, near Owensboro, Kentucky. From the size and furnishings 
of his house, 
it is evident that Mr. Campbell 
is quite well off. 
The interview lasted 1 1/2 hours and is detailed. See RLOG 
PFP83—RJL023

After the interview, I drove back toward New Lisbon.

[The rest of these notes were written some time after the 
actual events described. 
It was immediately after my return to 
New Lisbon that night that our tragedy occurred, so I didn't have 
time to think about the evening's events for several days. 
The 
illegality of the activities described, the candidness of my 
anonymous informants, and my presence in a situation where 
several 
laws were being violated, mandate a very circumspect 
account, which is by no means complete, but attempts to give a 
general account of the goings—on.] 
As I was driving up Cape May Co. Hwy. 557, I passed by a 
group of youths who were flashing a spotlight into the woods. I 
stopped to talk to them, noticing that there was a gun case 
in 
the back seat of one of the cars that was there. 
I struck up a 
conversation about "deer—jackin'" (poaching), and after a bit of 
explaining, four of them agreed to take me with them as they rode 
around "spotting," i.e., shining their spotlight into the woods 
to 
look for deer. 
G—Dennis Twp.GT G—Maurice River Twp.GT G—Upper 
Twp.GT G—Woodbine; 37GT The other two (of the six) stayed behind 
with the other two cars, so we did not have a gun with us and 
were technically not poaching, although the fellows assured me 
that "spotting" was also illegal. 
As we rode around, they passed 
around 
six—packs of beer and were furiously puffing hand—rolled 
cigarettes. 
We 
looked for clearings near houses. 
Deer often approach 
yards looking for gardens to forage in. 
All 
of them were more or 
less simultaneously bragging about the deer that they had 
poached, and I am inclined to believe that 
much of this was 
exaggeration. 
I mentioned Herschel Beebe, and the driver of the 
car, the only one whose first name I came to know, started 
laughing nervously. 
One of the others (much to the driver's 
discomfort) then revealed that the driver was a rather close 
relative of the legendary officer. The conversation then 
descended into a set of allegations about various area law 
enforcement personnel that are best left unrepeated. 
A 
discussion then ensued about the relative merits of buckshot, 
deer slugs, and rifles in poaching. All agreed that a good 30.06 
deer rifle was best, but because of 
its illegality, a poacher 
caught with one (even if he wasn't "caught in the act") would 
have to pay additional fines, as well as forfeiting the weapon. 
I asked them if they would have to forfeit an otherwise legal 
shotgun, and they said that after the fine was paid, the court 
had to return the gun to 
its owner. Buckshot is also illegal, and 
those who use 
it carry a few shells on their person, as well as 
the one 
in the barrel, and then make sure they have plenty of 
deer slugs 
in the gun case, so that the presence of buckshot 
would be overlooked by the arresting officer. They seemed to 
believe that "professional" poachers were more likely to use a 
rifle or buckshot, as they could afford to have their stuff 
confiscated, but that "jackers" (presumably, casual poachers), 
such as themselves, usually just used a 12—gauge shotgun with 
Lund--$3 Fieldnotes 
page 65 
deer slugs. 
That way there was only one fine to pay, and they 
would eventually get their guns back. The driver and two of the 
passengers had already been caught and paid fines several times. 
Much of the conversation between the fellows concerned not 
"deer—jackin'," but their alleged sexual prowess, and allusions 
to other illegal things that the boys did. 
I tried to steer the 
conversation back to "jackin "' 
several times, to the apparent 
discomfort of, especially, one of the back seat passengers (I was 
riding "shotgun"), who seemed to get more and more nervous every 
time I asked a question pertaining to poaching. Paradoxically, 
however, as long as I didn't ask direct questions, three of the 
four seemed to be vying for some kind of record as champion "deer 
jacker," as they repeatedly bragged about the number and size of 
the deer that they had poached in among bragging about sexual 
experiences, and various unmentionable illegal activities in 
which they claim to engage. 
The scene was obviously a bragging 
session, to the utmost, and 
it would have been great to have it 
all 
on tape in order to subject it to folkloristic analysis. 
So I decided to just sit and enjoy the ride 
or unfortunately, as the case may be, we ne 
deer. 
I did manage to get them to talk abo 
deer carcasses. 
The usual procedure is to 
the back of a van or pickup (covered with d 
and haul 
it into a garage 
or shed with a h 
mounted with hooks or a block and tackle, a 
dressing and butchering it, 
the meat gettin 
choicest parts going to the one who did the 
(They usually poach in groups of three or f 
"professionals," who go alone.) After drain 
meat is put in the family deep freeze, exce 
families who object. 
In that case, one guy 
in another guy's freezer. 
I asked about the practice of only 
bringing home the hindquarters, and leaving the rest of the 
carcass to waste. Again, that was a practice that they ascribed 
to the "professionals," but they allowed 
as to how a person who 
didn't have a suitable site for dressing the carcass might do 
that, too. The driver had evidently done that a few times after 
the last time he was caught and fined, because his family had 
tried to forbid him from doing any more poaching. 
He then just 
took the hindquarters off into the woods near his house, dressed 
and butchered them, and more or less "sneaked" the cuts into the 
deep freeze. 
1 asked about the practice of running deer with dogs. 
One 
of the boys said that his older brother has six "deer dogs," all

our, unlike the

mongrel hounds, and that he often accompanied his brother 
dogs. The description seemed similar to fox hunting -- as 
matter of fact, that is what you claim to be doing if you 
caught, even though there are hardly any foxes in the area. The 
dogs are turned loose in an area of woods whre deer have been 
seen. They do some barking, but preferably not as much as fox or 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 66 
'coon hounds. 
Although they can often get quite noisy, they 
should ideally just let out little "yips," just enough noise for 
the poacher to keep track of them and to know when they are on a 
scent. 
Deer have a way of tracking around and around, so 
it's 
easy for the dogs to get confused, and go off 
in different 
directions, so the poacher or poachers have to be able to keep 
rounding them up and keeping them together on whatever seems to 
be the most promising trail. 
The dogs are generally allowed to 
begin to attack the deer once he 
is 
located, as this encourages 
their aggressiveness, and the first shot has to be placed very 
carefully, 
in order to avoid hitting a dog, and also to bring 
down the deer, as the dogs usually scatter, and 
if the deer isn't 
seriously wounded right away, he'll bound off, often out of reach 
of the dogs as they resume their attack. 
Once the deer is down, 
the dogs are called off, so as not to damage too much of the 
carcass. 
Some field dressing is usually done right away, and the 
viscera are fed to the dogs on the spot, again in order to 
encourage their aggressiveness. 
We rode around for approximately 45 minutes, shining the 
portable spotlight at clearings, sweeping it around a few times, 
then driving on. Looking at the map afterwards, I would say that 
we covered the area north of Belleplain where Dennis, Maurice 
River, and Upper Townships, and Woodbine Borough intersect. They 
mentioned that if they think they see a deer low in the grass, 
they will sometimes fire off one barrel to startle him into 
getting up and running, and let go with the other barrel as he 
leaps up. 
After we got back to where we had started from, we 
shook hands and parted. 
I don't know if they resumed their 
activities or not, but since they piled into the other van (the 
one that had had the gun 
in 
it) as I was leaving, I suspect that 
they did.

The last few days had been taken up with the matters pertaining 
to Christine's death, so my planned last week and a half of 
fieldwork was considerably postponed, both 
in time and 
in spirit. 
Once again I went looking for Charlie Pomlear at the South Dennis 
landfill and once agin, he wasn't there. 
I finally managed to 
reach him on the phone and he 
invited me to come over to his 
house around 6 p.m. While waiting for time to pass, I drove down 
to Reeds Beach to check it out. 
There were several commercial 
docks with garveys, etc., and gill nets hanging around, but as 
Joseph had already photographed the place, I didn't bother.

I also drove down to Thompsons Beach, south of Delmont. It 
seemed to be strictly a recreational community. 
Having heard so 
much from George Campbell & Louis Peterson about erosion on the 
Delaware Bay shore, I could see its effect on the houses and 
beaches of Thompsons Beach. The beach area between the houses and 
the ocean was extremely narrow. A number of houses and trailers 
were obviously abandoned, and some of them were badly damaged, 
presumably by storms. The road to Thompsons Beach starts out 
perpendicularly from State Hwy. 47, runs several miles to the 
coast itself and then makes a right—angle turn left to run along 
the shore for about a mile. The shore portion is badly sanded 
over, and 
it seems that in several areas, the tide has come 
in 
over the road, despite the fact that there are houses and 
properties between the road and the bay. Along the road I could 
see cut—over salt hay meadows, probably cut by either George 
Campbell or Ezra Cox. In one of them were the remains of a cedar 
pole structure which, I believe, may have been a drying rack for 
fishnets in pre—nylon days. 
(I 
am not sure of this, but based on 
the description of such structures given me by Louis Peterson, 
I'd say it's a strong possibility.) I photographed them.

got up. They were, 
it turned out catching "minnows" (probably 
killifish) 
in a jar from a little ditch right beside the road. 
They hadn't caught any yet, but were still trying. 
By now, 
it 
was too dark to take pictures outrdoors without extra effort, and 
I went to a little diner in Delmont to have supper. 
By the time 
that was over, 
it was time to go and interview Charlie Pomlear in

Under the same roof, there 
seemed to be three generations, including lots of grandchildren, 
who were running about in various stages of undress. 
The yard 
was full 
of junked metal 
in sorted piles, and had a green flatbed 
truck with "M. Pomlear" painted on 
it. 
I later found out that 
that stood for Myrtle Pomlear, Charlie's wife, as Charlie did not 
drive, but had her take him to the landfill every day, and drive 
the metal back to the house to be sorted. 
Charlie was very open. 
He seemed in many ways to be a stereotypical "Piney," as 
described by McPhee and others. 
His family was originally from 
Chatsworth, so the stereotype fit, at least to some extent, and 
it was George Brewer, Jr. who had originally characterized Mr. 
Pomlear as the most "Piney" person he knew. The house was 
extremely hot, thanks to a woodstove that had just been stoked. 
As I removed some of my outergarments, Mr. Pomlear commented, 
"You think it's pretty hot in here?" 
"Yes," I had to admit. 
"Then wait'll that old devil gets hold of you, then it'll be a 
lot hotter'n this!," he said, and cackled with laughter. 
I asked 
him 
if he was referring to the Jersey Devil, and he said, "No, I 
mean the real devil. The one down there!" He then used the word 
"devil" as a verb, meaning to tease or harass. He talked about 
how much he liked to "devil" George (Brewer), and how he thought 
he'd like to "devil" me a bit, too. 
After a while everybody 
cleared out except Mr. Pomlear, and I got a 1 1I2—hour interview 
out of him (See RLOG PFP83—RJL026 to 028). 
After the interview, I drove out to Port Norris to stay at 
Dan O'Connor & Susan Grant's house.

TX01: I spent the night in Port Norris at the home of Dan 
O'Connor and Susan Grant. After breakfast, I drove down to the 
Rutgers Shellfish Lab in G—Bivalve; Commercial Twp.GT with Dan, and 
he showed me the major cause of the oyster industry's decline. 
Under the microscope we observed a section of oyster flesh at 
1000X. Among the cells of oyster tissue were a number of large, 
dark elliptical bodies, each one full of several smaller nuclei. 
These were the protozoan organisms commonly called MSX (for 
"multinucleated sphere, unknown"), and known scientifically as 
Haplosporidium nelsoni. According to Dan, the life cycle of MSX 
is a mystery to malacologists. 
It has more or less been proved 
that MSX—infected oysters do not infect other oysters, so the 
disease cannot be considered contagious in the classical sense. 
It 
is believed that the organism probably goes through a cycle of 
successive hosts, but their nature 
is unknown. 
The disease first 
became a problem during the late 1950s. 
At that time, seed 
oysters were being brought in from Virginia, so many people felt 
that the Virginia seed stock was infecting Delaware Bay. 
Biologists generally discount this theory for a number of 
reasons, chiefly that there 
is 
no evidence that the Virginia seed 
stock was MSX—infected. 
The influence of MSX on the local economy has been 
disastrous, to say the least. Quaker activist types like Dan 
O'Connor have correlated the increase of MSX with decreases in 
local birthweights and increases 
in alcoholism, wife abuse, and 
other social maladies. 
All 
of 
it, 
of course, hinges on the 
sudden increase in the local unemployment rate which, for 
Commercial Twp., 
is reputedly the highest in New Jersey. Bivalve 
supposedly once had 6-7000 inhabitants, and businesses like 
shopping centers and car dealers. 
Now, of course, there is 
nothing. 
According to O'Connor, one of the chief problems is 
substandard housing, which causes several deaths by fire every 
year. The local poor are blacks who were brought in from Maryland 
and Virginia during the 1920s and 1940s, to work as shuckers and 
as crewmen on the oysterboats, back when everything was manual. 
When the economy collapsed, most of them were thrown out of work. 
The majority eventually left, and many of those remaining are now

on public assistance. Were it possible to "solve the MSX 
problem," the Maurice River Valley could again become a 
prosperous place, but Dan 
is pessimistic about the possibility of 
this, because not enough resources are being allocated to this 
end. The problem with malacological or any other scientific 
research is that it 
is grant and paper presentation oriented 
rather than goal oriented, so although the raison d'etre for the 
Rutgers Shellfish Research Lab may be to try to solve the oyster 
industry's problems, but in actual fact, the goals end up being 
to present papers and to get more grants.

After my visit to the

photographed the "Cashier." I also photographed some crab pots 
and a few other boats and the Supreme Council of the House of 
Jacob of the U.S.A., Inc.'s church. (They turned down our request 
to document their service.) From there I headed over to the 
Pinelands National Reserve side of the Maurice River (Maurice 
River Township), stopping on the Mauricetown bridge to shoot the 
oysterboats tied up on the Maurice River Twp. side.

From there, I headed to the Robinson Boat Yard at G-Penny 
Hill; 38GT (between Bricksboro and Dorchester), where Louis 
Peterson was working on his newly purchased oyster boat. 
The 
boatyard was quite spectacular, as 
in 
it were about a half dozen 
large oyster boats, probably between 50 and 100 feet long, all 
up 
on blocks. Louis's boat, the "Mary Coleman," an 80 -foot schooner, 
was on a drydock right next to the shore. Louis was down in the 
hold, working on the boat. 
He complained that the "Coleman" was 
in much worse shape than he had expected and that he expected to 
have to put at least $30,000 into her to make her seaworthy. He 
felt fortunate to have the backing of the Bivalve Packing Co. to 
cover the cost of repairs. He showed me some "repairs" that had 
been made on her at a local boatyard, and how the nails and 
clinchings had been driven in without any thought of whether or 
not they fastened the planking to the ribs. 
He also told me that 
some "repairs" had consisted of merely nailing sheet metal over 
bad planks, thereby causing them and neighboring timbers to rot 
at an even faster rate. He was presently about to high-pressure 
the inside of the hull, and he had rented a high pressure cleaner 
to do the job. 
After photographing the interior of the hull, and 
Louis in there with his high pressure cleaner, I went out and 
photographed around the boatyard.

I had planned to go to the home of Linwood R. Veach at 3 
p.m. to begin an interview with him about his eeling activities, 
but I ended up on the phone with George Campbell, who was about 
to 
load up a load of salt hay for a customer, and he 
invited me 
to come over and photograph it. On the way over there, I passed 
by a very picturesque little garage between Delmont and G—Eldora; 
34GT, Kelly's Garage, owned by Les Kelly, 
in which a group of men 
were sitting around passing the time. 
Had I not already 
committed myself to going to Campbell's, I would have tried to 
talk them into letting me tape their conversations. 
I did, 
however, photograph them. 
After I arrived at George Campbell's, I went around & 
photographed his crabbing pay pond, his holding pen for 
pheasants, and some of his equipment. 
Unfortunately, his 
customer never showed up, but George took me out in the meadows 
and showed me some of the places he had made bank improvements, 
some of the marshes he had just cut, piles of salt hay, etc. 
He 
also showed me the difference between the species of Spartina, 
and I photographed examples of each. 
He showed me a place where 
the tide had broken through the banks, probably due to muskrat 
activity. 
It was almost a solid mass of 
little "minnows" 
(probably killifish).

After this I went to the home of Linwood R. and Janet 
Veach in Delmont. Linwood is about 30 years old. 
He 
is a full 
time eeler and fur trapper (depending on the season) and a 
volunteer deputy conservation officer. One of the first things he 
showed me upon arrival was a set of pictures of fish kills at the 
mouth of West Creek, which he had photographed. 
He attributed 
the kills to spraying by the Mosquito Commission. 
The interview 
went very well, and he eventually persuaded his father, Linwood 
E. Veach, a full time conservation officer to come over and join 
in. 
We ended up with 2 1/2 hours of interview (see RLOG PFP83— 
RJL029 to 033). As the interview drew to a close, the Veaches 
informed me that the next morning was the opening of the small 
game season, and that they would be patrolling the Heislerville 
State Hunting Preserve in the morning, and would be opening the 
season. 
To this they invited me along. 
Linwood R. also told me 
that after I had ridden around with them in the hunting preserve 
for a while, that he would take me out and show me his eel 
pots. 
When I told them I was staying 
in Port Norris, they looked very 
worried and expressed concern for my safety. 
From there, I drove back to Port Norris to spend the night. 
At this point, I would like to repeat a horrifying story 
that I heard. One person to whom I had talked had served on the 
Twp. Volunteer Fire Dept. A house in the area had burned 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 72 
down, and he had the unenviable responsibility of carrying out 
the remains of two young children who had been killed. 
He was, 
as one might expect, very upset. 
The other firemen chided him 
for his display of emotion and wondered why he took it so hard. 
"After all, they're only niggers," was their comment. The next 
day he resigned from the company. 
Any comment on my part would 
be superfluous.

TXO1: 
Today, November 12, was the first day of the small game 
hunting season, which began at exactly 8:00 a.m. 
I met Linwood 
E. 
and Linwood R. Veach at Linwood R.'s home 
in G—Delmont; 38GT at 
7:40. Linwood E. 
is a full time N.J. D.E.P. conservation officer, 
and his son, Linwood R. 
is a volunteer deputy conservation 
officer. We piled into Linwood E.'s white unmarked cruiser and 
set out for the Heislerville Wildlife Management Area in 
southwest Maurice River Twp. near East Point at the mouth of the 
Maurice River. As we drove down the road, we saw dozens of 
hunters in "hunter's orange" gear carrying shotguns, releasing 
dogs, and unloading vehicles. 
We arrived on the preserve at 
about 7:55, and immediately heard several shots going off. 
Linwood E. tried to locate their origin by asking some of the 
hunters, but to no avail. 
It 
is supposedly very annoying to 
law 
observing hunters to have others begin shooting before the 
official moment, because it gives the violators an unfair 
advantage. 
The state had released about 400 pheasant in the 
preserve the day before. I was carrying my camera and "shooting" 
at the hunters, prompting one of them to say, "Hey! You're not 
supposed to be shootin' before 8 o'clock!" 
There must have been several hundred hunters in the preserve 
by 8:00 sharp, at which time Linwood E. blew a police whistle, 
and the hunters started off into the meadows. Periodically, 
Linwood E. would stop and check a hunter to see 
if he had a valid 
license and a pheasant stamp (mounted in a transparent holder 
pinned to the back of the jacket). Most of the hunters were adult 
men, but there were at least three women out there and a number 
of children. We cruised all 
over the mud roads of the meadows. 
The primary responsibility of the Veaches at that time seemed to 
be to maintain a visible presence. 
One of the violations that 
they are most concerned with enforcing is "discharging a firearm 
upon or across a state, county, or municipal highway or road." It 
is quite easy for an excited hunter to thoughtlessly shoot in the 
direction of a flushed bird, without considering if he 
is 
shooting directly at a public road, and because of the obvious 
dangers involved, 
it 
is 
imperative that such carelessness be 
discouraged. 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 74 
A "first morning" of the hunting season always brings out 
hundreds of hunters, many of whom get discouraged 
after an hour 
or so of flushing out other hunters instead of birds. By 8:30, we 
already saw some hunters loading their firearms into their 
vehicles. Linwood E. 
stopped to ask them why they were quitting 
so early. In all cases they complained of there being too many 
other hunters. Linwood E. explained how in some places, where 
there 
is a meadow between two roads, there 
is a real danger to 
hunters, because groups will set out from opposite directions, 
and head towards each other. 
Then 
if a bird is flushed, hunters 
are inadvertently shooting at each other from opposite sides of 
the bird. 
More than one fistfight has occurred because several 
hunters shot or shot at the same bird, and then all 
ran up to 
claim it. 
Despite the crowded conditions, both Veaches were of 
the opinion that there were fewer than there had been on opening 
day for some years. Linwood E. Veach radioed in that the 
"pressure was only moderate." 
Many serious hunters wait until 
the second week to begin hunting, because of high "pressure" the 
first week. 
One of the more amusing (or pathetic) aspects of the 
presence of so many hunters in the same place was that their dogs 
(mostly pointers and retrievers) seemed totally out of control. 
Several times we observed exasperated hunters whistling and 
shouting at a dog who had decided to go 
in a totally different 
direction from the one the hunter desired, often because another 
dog was over there. The dogs seemed totally oblivious to the 
commands of their masters. 
I asked the Veaches whether this 
meant that the dogs were poorly trained. Although they allowed 
that such could be the case, they said that even a well—trained, 
obedient dog was not likely to perform well under such 
circumstances. 
After a while, Linwood E. suggested that we 
look for a 
hunter who had a bird, so that I could get a picture of 
it. 
We 
rode around for a good 45 minutes, shouting, "Got any 
pheasant?!," at hunters. 
We finally located one, who agreed to 
let me photograph him. Linwood E. 
said that there were probably 
others, as well, but that they may have been suspicious of us 
riding around in a conservation officer's car. 
Some of them 
might not have a pheasant stamp, either. 
He said that many 
people try to evade the $15 charge. He cannot "tag," i.e., ticket 
them, unless they are in possession of a pheasant, because they 
can merely say that they are rabbit or squirrel hunting. 
Linwood 
E. 
said that that did not fool him, because rabbit hunting was 
very poor in the Heislerville area. 
We did, however, come across 
one hunter who had actually just shot a rabbit. 
As we drove along the road, the Veaches pointed out to me 
banks and ditches that the State had built in order to maintain 
the proper elevation and drainage of the meadow, so as to produce 
a desirable habitat. 
It was similar to the work that George 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 75 
Campbell had done on his meadows, and the Heislerville preserve 
is one of the areas on which he leases cutting rights. 
From riding around chatting with hunters, the Veaches 
decided that today was not a particularly good hunting day. 
Far 
fewer shots were heard than would be expected, an indication that 
fewer birds were being flushed. They were of the opinion that 
perhaps the biologists releasing the pheasant had not done so 
carefully enough. 
One hunter reported having seen someone 
releasing a flock of pheasant from the Maurice River bridge at 
Mauricetown--an easy way to get a lot of them to fly off, but not 
a very good way to get them to disperse through the meadows. It 
was also cold (in the upper 30s F.) and very windy. Pheasant are 
reportedly harder to flush when it 
is very windy, because they 
retreat into deeper thickets and clumps where it 
is harder for a 
dog to flush them. 
Around 9:30, we headed back to Linwood R.'s 
house. Linwood E. then went back to work, and Linwood R. 
accompanied me into Millville, so that I could purchase some Tri—

After that, we drove down to the dock on West Creek at 
George Campbell's property. 
This was where Linwood R. 
and his 
brother landed their eels during eeling season (which ended the 
last week of October). The boats were gone, but there were still 
several 
liveboxes full 
of eels, which were unfortunately not 
accessible, because the tide was very low and the banks very 
steep. We got some pictures and then drove on. 
From there we drove to Linwood E.'s property, just northeast 
of G—Delmont; 38GT. 
There Linwood R. and his brother have their 
eeling shop. 
It consists of a work shed, 
in which they fabricate 
eel 
pots from hardware cloth, a set of 
large walk—in 
refrigerators, and stacks and stacks of different types of eel 
pots. They make five different types of eel 
pots, all 
out of 
hardware cloth, and all 
based on the same principle as a crab pot 
or other fish trap, namely two chambers & two funnel shaped 
throats. The outside throat leads into an antechamber or 
"hallway", and the second into the inner chamber or "parlor." 
A 
cylinder of mesh extends into the parlor, and it 
is there that 
the bait (usually mutilated horseshoe crab) 
is suspended to 
attract the eels. 
The five different sizes constitute rectangular 
and cylindrical traps of different mesh sizes. When fishing for 
"salt eels," 
i.e., those intended to be salted down and sold as 
bait for Chesapeake Bay crabbers, the smaller mesh pots are used, 
because the smaller eels are most desirable. 
This 
is 
likely to 
be the main crop harvested during warm weather, because then eels 
cannot be kept alive 
in 
liveboxes. 
As the weather cools, the 
live market opens up and larger mesh pots are used. 
The live 
eels are kept alive in 
liveboxes, and picked up weekly by a live 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 76 
truck from Philadelphia. Most are eventually air—freighted to 
Europe, where they are esteemed a delicacy in many countries, 
including Scandinavia, Germany, the Low Countries, and Italy. 
Some are also consumed in Philadelphia, especially by Italians. 
The pots are, as noted above, rectangular or cylindrical. 
The rectangular ones have a greater capacity, but they cannot be 
used on sandbars or in strong tides, because if they tip over, 
they may close off access to the throat. 
The cylindrical pots, 
though smaller, will just roll over, and the throat, which is on 
the end, will remain open and accessible to eels. One cylindrical 
pot was very small, only about 2 feet by 8 inches, and 
it was 
used to catch very small eels, which are occasionally in demand. 
He also had some special sorting baskets made of heavy mesh 
hardware cloth, each one about the size of a bushel basket. The 
spaces in the mesh are about 1 1/2 inches, and when live eels are 
put in such a basket, the smaller ones work their way out, while 
the larger ones stay in. 
The baskets, and most of the pots were 
tarred to prevent rusting. 
Some of the traps were made of a new 
bright blue plastic coated mesh, which was supposed to be quite 
rustproof and not as visible underwater. 
Inside one of the walk—in freezers, Linwood still had 
several barrels of salt eel waiting to be sold as crab bait, 
which I also photographed. 
Later that day, I drove back to New Lisbon.

[Information for logging photos: Capt. Glendon Berry of 
Port Norris; 
deckhands, Louis McCoy (older, red cap, darker 
yellow foul weathers) of Cedarville, Cicero Page (younger, gray 
cap, 
lighter yellow foul weathers) of Cedarville.? 
Joseph Czarnecki and I drove down to G—Shell Pile; Commercial 
Twp.GT at about 3 a.m., and arrived at the Port Norris Oyster Co. 
dock, to which the "Alert" was tied up, at about 4:30 a.m. The 
"Alert" 
is 
an 80—foot wooden schooner, built in 1932, and made 
over into a diesel—powered "dredge boat" (pronounced "drudge 
boat") during the late 1940s. Immediately after our arrival, a 
station wagon appeared, driven by a black woman, and discharged 
two black men. They were Louis McCoy and Cicero Page of 
Cedarville -- the crew of the "Alert." A few minutes later, Capt. 
Glendon Berry, a white man from Port Norris, arrived. The captain 
boarded the "Alert" and started up the diesel engine. Joseph and 
I boarded the "Alert" and went into the wheel house. After I got 
in there, I started to set up the Nagra. 
I discovered, to my 
horror, that the main switch had somehow gotten pushed up to 
"Record -- No Limiter," and there was practically no juice in the 
system. So much for recording an oystering trip. At about 4:45, 
we started out of the harbor. Joseph did some flash photography in 
the wheel house, which prompted several concerned messages over 
the marine band radio from other captains who thought that the 
"Alert" was on fire. 
The trip from Shell Pile to the oyster grounds lasts about 
1-1/2 hours. The wheel house was quite warm, heated by a propane 
stove. Messrs. McCoy and Pace stayed below in the galley, which 
is also the engine compartment. Capt. Berry explained that years 
ago, they used to cook 3 meals per trip on the oyster boats, and 
that elaborate meals, such as steak, were regular fare. As we 
were moving along there was a tremendous amount of chatter on the 
radio, kidding about the Cowboys vs. the Eagles, mildly 
suggestive comments, etc. Capt. Berry explained that the 
automated sorting gear was introduced about 15 years ago, and 
that before its introduction the average dredging boat had a crew 
of from 12 to 15 hands, who knelt on the foredeck, sorting out 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 78 
the culls, the empty shells, and the other stuff that came up on 
the dredge. Now boats usually have two to four hands aboard. 
Some of the less automated ones need to have the dredges dumped 
by hand on to the conveyor belt of the sorter. 
These are the 
ones that still need a crew of four. 
After a while the radio started blasting loud rock music, 
and Glendon switched channels, complaining about some of the 
"kids" who are now skippering boats and how they tie up the 
channels with their horseplay. 
We arrived at the oyster grounds at about 6:15, just as the 
dawn was breaking. The "Alert" was one of the first vessels to 
arrive, but others soon followed, and soon there were about six 
or eight dredge boats getting into position. 
The oyster grounds 
are marked by cedar stakes in their corners and, 
in some cases by 
floating buoys. Capt. Berry discussed the buoys over the radio 
remarking how surprised he was to see them still 
in place after 
last week's windy weather. McCoy and Page came out of the galley, 
went up to the foredeck and proceeded to unfasten the dredges 
(pronounced "drudges"). There are two, one port and the other 
starboard. They are operated hydraulically and empty into two 
chutes, which then tip the oysters on to two narrow belt—operated 
conveyors which in turn carry them astern. 
There they go 
into 
two cylindrical cages, which are rotating. 
The spaces between 
the 
bars of the cages determine that the undersize oysters fall 
out. As these "culls" fall out, they land in two short, broad 
chutes which lead them overboard. The larger oysters, which work 
their way down through the cylinders, eventually fall out on a 
large, wide conveyor, which carries them aft to a position 
amidships. There they fall 
into yet another chute, the lower end 
of which can be moved about so that it discharges them into one 
of 24 large rectangular cages, each of which holds about 85 
bushels of oysters. Periodically one of the deckhands climbs up 
on the cages and moves the lower end of the chute to another 
cage, when the previous cage 
is full. 
The dredges are lowered into the bay and the boat begins 
moving in a tight circle 
in the relatively small area that 
constitutes one oyster ground. The captain can feel resistance on 
one side or another as a dredge gets filled up, and he then pulls 
a lever of the hydraulic system to raise the dredge. As the 
system operates, the deckhands stand in the bow 
pulling out 
shells, sponges, horseshoe crabs, etc., from the main conveyor 
and tossing them overboard, saving an occasional blue crab or 
flounder that may appear, and tossing such into a basket on deck. 
These operations are normally repeated hour after hour until 
about 1 p.m., at which time they weigh dredges and head ashore. 
Of course, 
if 
all 
24 baskets are filled before that time, they 
get to head ashore earlier. 
While we were out there, we often came close to other oyster 
boats, whose white hulls practically glowed in the sun. 
They 
Lund--83 Fieldnotes 
page 79 
were a spectacular sight. For some reason, the "Alert" was the 
only boat in the fleet to have a black hull. 
Watching the oysters go up the conveyors was interesting. 
The shells, when freshly dredged, are multicolored, due to 
various microorganisms and minute organisms 
attached to them. 
There are also numerous pipe—shaped sponges that come up with the 
oysters. 
They are bright orange when freshly caught, but soon 
fade to a dull brown. Another common organism on the dredge 
is 
the common horseshoe or king crab. One of them came up quite 
mangled, with a piece of 
its flesh extruding. Remembering George 
Campbell's comments about their edibility, and thinking of sushi, 
I decided to try a bite, much to the distress of my taste buds, 
and I must have spit that chunk all 
the way to Delaware. 
There 
was no shucking knife aboard, but Capt. Berry lent me a 
pocketknife and I proceeded to open and eat probably close to 
three dozen raw oysters, which helped me overcome the horrible 
taste that horseshoe crab left in my mouth. 
Using the 
pocketknife for shucking was not easy, and by the end of the 
trip, I had cut my fingers a number of times. Glendon teased me 
about "eating up all 
the day's profits" and commented that, as I 
ate my way through the piles of oysters, the boat was getting 
lighter and riding higher. Capt. Berry told about how in the days 
of 
larger crews they often had serious drunks aboard, and they 
occasionally fell or jumped overboard, often drowning before they 
could be rescued. One who jumped overboard was a wine addict who 
suddenly came down with delirium tremens. After rescuing him, 
they took him ashore and got him into an ambulance and he 
later 
jumped out of the ambulance as 
it was speeding down the highway 
to the hospital. 
Both Louis McCoy and Cicero Page live 
in Cedarville, and 
they have been crewing on oysterboats for about 15 years. 
Around 11 
a.m., there was a sudden spray 
in the bow of the 
boat as one of the main hydraulic lines ruptured. Hydraulic oil 
squirted all over the bow, rendering it so slippery that the 
deckhands started sliding about. 
That abruptly ended our 
oystering trip, and we headed ashore with only 15 baskets of 
oysters and 9 empty baskets. 
As we were heading ashore, more loud rock music kept blaring 
in 
on several channels of the radio. Interspersed with it were 
screamed obscenities and mock chicken noises. Glendon complained 
that one of the packing houses was using 17 and 18 year—old 
captains, and that they were smoking marijuana while oystering. 
He predicted that the Coast Guard or the Marine Police would 
eventually crack down on them, especially since they were tying 
up radio channels that could be needed for emergencies. 
We arrived dockside at Shell Pile at about 12:30 p.m.

I had decided to go out the following day and record the 
oystering, but a storm came 
in 
in the evening, so they canceled 
the trip. 
Meanwhile, Joseph and I decided to go out into the Egg 
Island meadows west of G—Port Norris; Commercial Twp.GT and try to 
find George Campbell, 
in case he was mowing salt hay there. On 
the way out there, we stopped at the West Side Luncheonette in 
Port Norris. That is where George always stops for breakfast and 
lunch when he 
is mowing near Port Norris. 
They hadn't seen him 
at all that day and doubted that he was 
in the area. We drove 
around and around in the meadows and actually found an old junky 
car of George's, but no sign of him. 
We did, however, find the 
salt haying operations of Austin Berry, who 
is the leading salt 
hay farmer on the west bank of the Maurice River. 
Around the 
meadows were scattered various pieces of equipment, including 
mowers, balers, four wheel drive tractors, and the clamshell— 
jawed cranes that are used to shore up the banks. We also found 
an old dump rake, of the type that would have been horse drawn. 
We explored the meadows looking at phragmites and various 
Spartina 
(salt hay) varieties, while Joseph photographed it all 
to 
lengthening rays of the sun. We walked out on one Spartina 
meadow, which was spectacular, due to the fact that it had 
obviously not been cut in a long time. This was probably due to 
the fact that it was full of soggy low places that probably could 
not support heavy equipment. We noticed how soft the high ground 
areas were and Joseph tried lying down. I also tried it and was 
surprised at how comfortable the human hair—like salt hay was, 
and how its waterproof and insulating properties made it a quite 
warm bed. Before we knew it, we had both dozed off for about 1/2 
hour, probably due to lack of sleep the night before. After 
awakening we searched onward for signs of George Campbell, whom 
we never found, and headed back to Dan O'Connor & Susan Grant's 
at sunset. We both ended up going to sleep by 8 p.m. that night.
