I: 
 Get this going, get the other one going. 
I2: 
Okay. Gotta make sure this one is off. 
I: 
I think mine is. 
I2: 
Okay. 
I: 
We did an interview yesterday, and I have to check the take, but it was what side? Heavy wind, 
helicopters going across, and then half way through some guy started up his lawn mower. 
P: 
Yeah. I’ve done sound for documentary, and they did one—I did the mixing. The sounds guys—it was a 
documentary about beer, so they were drunk when they were doin’ it. And it’s like they’re driving down—not 
the drive of the who was being interviewed—they’re driving down the road with the windows open trying to 
record the audio. 
I: 
Oh, boy. Didn’t catch much probably. 
P: 
Well, yeah. 
I: 
Thankfully, K, has really high-powered audio equipment, so if mine doesn’t come through his usually 
does. Okay. Here we are. We’re on tape now with K. Ki? Is that how it’s pronounced? 
P: 
Correct. K. Ki. 
I: 
K. Ki, and the first thing I want to do is say thank you, again, for agreeing to this interview, but also for 
the work that you do, cause as a PCA and an RN you do super important work. And we want to bring attention 
to it and have people notice the work that you do and the value of it. We are studying older adults, and as you 
know there’s a huge shortage of people who can care for older adults right now, and it’s going to get worse. 
So, we’re interested in the stories. And I want to start right in with your story. So, I’m gonna ask how you—I 
mean going back to your PCA days, how long did you do that? When did you get into it? How did you get into it 
and why? 
P: 
Well, if I go back to the beginning before that, I had gone to school for music recording [54.46], and that 
was not a very financially viable career. So, all growing up I had fixed computers, and so instead of doing 
music recording in Lansing, Michigan, I fell into doing computer work and eventually became a Linex Systems 
Administrator. And I didn’t have any training for the work, I was self-taught, and I ended up working for state 
government for the Michigan Senate as a non-partisan employee. And I really disliked the work environment, 
and I wasn’t ever passionate about the work. So, my girlfriend who is a nurse inspired me to go back to school. 
I had thought about going to school for medicine. My grandmother was an anesthesiologist, and she had told 
all of her children and her grandchildren, if you want to help people, [laughing] don’t be a doctor, be a nurse or 
something along those lines. Don’t go to school for medicine, so 20 years later, I decided to take that advice, 
and so that began my journey towards going to nursing school. My grades from when I went to school for 
music recording were abysmal, so it was difficult for me to get into a nursing program. So, there was a work 
requirement for some of the community colleges, and I started working. My neighbor, who is a nurse, had 
referred me to a client that he knew, and that’s how I got my start working as a PCA. It was to meet some work 
requirements for—some hour work requirements for—as a prerequisite for nursing school. And so, I thought 
this a good idea for me to at least try to get some experience in patient care because I hadn’t any, and I didn’t 
know if I would be afraid of poop, or if I wouldn’t like the work. And I really took to it right away. Just even in the 
first day I thought this is so much more rewarding than the work I had been doing in IT. I do like solving 
problems but taking care of people just feels good for me. And so, then I also had a very, very—my first client 
was very, very interesting, and so right away I didn’t—the relationship changed from me just being a guy who 
show up to cook food, to being a friend and a part of his life [51.53], very quickly just because I found the work 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kevin Kitchel. 6.12.18

rewarding and he was such an open and interesting person as well. And so, I was a PCA for him for a little less 
than a year. And then he ended up—his condition declined where he needed more care and ended up moving 
to a different town. And right around that time I was accepted into nursing school, so I didn’t have the time to 
work with him any longer. 
I: 
Okay. So, you had the one client. 
P: 
Yeah. I had the one client, but I’d also had experiences taking care of family members. My day, 
[laughing], my dad and I are both pretty clumsy, and about once every 2 years he has an accident that ends 
him up in a subacute rehab. And he’s overdue for one right now, and so I have a lot of experience taking care 
of my own father. The last injury, he broke both of his wrists at the same time. He was here on campus at a 
party [50.41]. 
I: 
Wow. I’m trying to figure out how you do that? 
P: 
Yeah. He stepped off a front porch and missed a step. We blame it on his Crocs, but [laughing] anyway 
he was actually at a student-sport function here hangin’ out with student athletes and fell and broke both of his 
[laughing] wrists. 
I: 
Rather hard to manage life without both hands. 
P: 
Yeah. So, he had no hands, so I had to take care of all of his eating, his bathroom functions, helping my 
own father with that, and that was actually after I had done the PCA work. But he’s broken his hip before, and 
I’ve had to take care of him after getting out of the hospital and out of the subacute rehab. So, I did have—
outside of my time where my job title was PCA, I also have experience taking care of family members. 
I: 
Sure. So, as a PCA, was that through an agency or? 
P: 
Yeah. So, the Tri-County Office on Aging did the vetting and the payment, so he had applied through—
so, my client had applied through them for help, and so I think it was 8 hours a day. They okayed 8 hours a day 
and the payment of $10 an hour for a PCA, so you would apply through them, and they did a background 
check. And so, he would sign your timesheets, send them to them, and then they would pay you. 
I: 
Okay. So, what year was that? 
P: 
2013. 
I: 
So, in 2013. 
P: 
2013 into 2014, yeah. 
I: 
It was $10 an hour? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And it must have been through the Medicaid Waiver Program? 
P: 
That’s not clear to me. I’m sorry. I do not remember [48.49] exactly, but that does sound accurate. 
I: 
Okay. And did you receive any training at all? 
P: 
No. No. I received no training. I was very surprised at how easy it was for someone—I mean I have—
after the criminal background check, I was—just showed up and was told what to do. And this man was a 
quadriplegic, so he needed a lot more care than maybe an elderly person with dementia. It was in some ways, 
total care with no training whatsoever outside of my desire to go to nursing school.

I: 
What do you think about that? What are your thoughts on that? 
P: 
Well, not only—I was just shocked at how—I was shocked that—let me just think about this accurately. 
Yeah. I was shocked at how low the bar was set for employment, and how there’s such a—like a high degree 
of responsibility or potential responsibility caring for somebody with no vetting process and very little financial 
reward. This guy had some medical issues something called autonomic dysreflexia, where if his bladder would 
fill up he—his blood pressure goes very high. It ends up being potentially an emergent situation if he’s not 
toileted frequently enough. And I wouldn’t expect anybody off the street to know about this condition [46.55], 
and so this guy has some things that are day-to-day emergencies, and so I’m thrown into this situation with no 
training whatsoever. He’s able to tell me a little bit about this, but it’s just shocking how—it’s shocking to me 
how little training there is for potentially life-threatening situations. And no requirement for BLS or CPR for this 
patient, and also meeting some of the other PCAs who worked also as private-pay clients in his same 
apartment complex, I would not—they were nice people, but I wouldn’t necessarily trust them in an emergency 
situation. Now, I understand that as a nurse, now, my focus is kind of on those medical emergencies, not so 
much on like the emotional connections and the, like, day-to-day understanding of someone’s likes and dislikes 
and routines, which is a huge part of my interpretation of PCA work. But the fact that there are no standards—
no—not just standards, but guidelines or recommendations that I’m aware of that legally set in stone. I’m just at 
the wild-west like conditions that I’ve seen in dealing with—in meeting other PCAs who worked in the same 
apartment complex that I did. 
I: 
So, were you aware of his condition at all before you walked in the door? 
P: 
Yeah. I was—I did know that he was quadriplegic, so I mean ‘cause I was referred by a friend who was 
a nurse, who was trying to help me find some interesting work, and he thought, “Well, this guy’s got a lot goin’ 
on.” He probably—my neighbor who was a 20-year nurse, he probably underestimated the amount of care 
‘cause it would be easy for him. He was a neuro-trauma nurse, so seeing somebody who’s paralyzed, oh, he 
knows what to do, and probably underestimates what it would take for somebody off the street to take care of a 
guy like that [44.31]. 
I: 
So, explain to me what you did need to do for your client. What kind of care did you provide? 
P: 
Well, he couldn’t cook, and he was a foodie, so it was a lot of prepare—a lot of learning. I, myself, am a 
strict vegetarian, and he’s not. So, I had to really reach out in ways—or I had to learn about how to cook meat 
and eggs [laughs], and things like that. And not just boil meat, like to actually cook it well for him. In a way I 
didn’t wanna—I wanted to do a good job and cook food that he enjoyed ‘cause I also enjoy food even though it 
happens to be a different definition of food. So, that was one of the things that was a big challenge for me at 
first, even just emotionally getting into the point of cooking food like that. But the other patient care things are, 
you know, he was a high-functioning quadriplegic. So, he was able to walk with a lot of assistance—with a 
walker and stuff. So, I would shower him, you know, he would sit in the shower chair and stand with a lot of 
assistance. So, I would shower him. I would change is ostomy, clean is ostomy appliance. He had some 
healing-pressure ulcers that I would clean, and do some minor wound care, which is totally out of the scope of 
practice for—in my opinion for someone who’s not licensed. There’s also—he had a lot of issues with fungus, 
so he had some fungal infections on his skin that we were taking care of, and I was not his only patient-care—I 
was not his only PCA. I’m sorry if I wasn’t clear about that before. So, everything from feeding, toileting, all the 
way to just all the social aspects—driving to restaurants and social things. 
I: 
It sounds like he had other PCAs, but also, you must have been working with wound care and 
everything—you must have been working with a nurse [42.11]? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
No? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kevin Kitchel. 6.12.18 
 
3
P: 
He would go to specialists, but he had no visiting wound-care nurses—no visiting care. 
I: 
So, you didn’t report to any medical personnel? 
P: 
No. Nope. No. I was under no medical supervision. He was—the client was my boss. 
I: 
And how did you learn how to do all of that stuff? Did you know—ostomy care, for example? 
P: 
I self-taught. 
I: 
Did he explain it to you? Help you? 
P: 
He had his own ideas about how it should be done, and now that I’m a nurse, I understand that some of 
those things are maybe not the best options, especially for someone who’s trying to use [41.33]—to get the 
most life out of their ostomy appliances as possible [laughs] ‘cause he has to pay for ‘em—he has to pay for 
them himself. Even though he gets a discounted price, so he wants to use them as long as possible, and so 
that ends up causing some skin breakdown around the ostomy when you don’t change—you can get skin 
breakdown if you change ‘em too often, also, not often enough. 
I: 
So, did he give you any training himself? Did he say, “You know, these are the things that I need, and 
this is how I like it done?” 
P: 
Yes. Yeah. So, he gave me some training—“I like it like this. Some people do it like this, and I like that 
better. Like how I like you to clean the end of the ostomy when—after emptying it and closing it back up, but 
not—nothing about, this is medical best practice to do this or this is keeping me safe and infection free in my 
wounds. Nothing like that, no. 
I: 
How did you learn how to do wound care? 
P: 
I had to reach out to other resources. My girlfriend was a nurse. I think I mentioned—she was very 
interested in wound care, so I could ask her questions. But I mean what if I didn’t have her to do that. I also, 
you know, would find that some of the PCAs would just put a band-aide on, you know, a pressure ulcer on a 
heel, and that’s not appropriate. You know, you need some padding. In this case it needed padding and 
support. And so, some of the PCA treatment was the reason that he had pressure ulcers [39.50] ‘cause they 
would leave him in his wheelchair too long. And the client understood that, but also had so many PCAs come 
through that they were hard to find, so even if they did a bad job he wasn’t willing to fire them. 
I: 
So, he had 24-hour care? 
P: 
No. He had 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, and he broke that up into two 4-hour chunks. So, I would go 
to work at 7 in the morning and then I would work for 4 hours, have a 2 or 3-hour break in the middle of the 
day, then come back for another 4 hours. That would be dinner and going to bed. 
I: 
Did you ever worry about liability? 
P: 
Not at the time. I didn’t—in retrospect, very much so, but no, I didn’t feel like I would be solely liable for 
lack of care. And then, now, looking back, there’s a lot of—I wasn’t a licensed medical practitioner, so I don’t 
think that the—I didn’t have a license on the line for my practice, but emotionally I definitely would be liable for 
like if I caused him injury, for sure, but I didn’t feel like I was legally—like I would legally be responsible for that 
outside of like abuse, which I wasn’t gonna abuse the guy or neglect or anything like that. 
I: 
So, you mentioned a couple minutes ago that he—there were always like emergent situations 
happening— 
P: 
The potential for an emergent situation. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kevin Kitchel. 6.12.18 
 
4
I: 
The potential—did it ever happen? 
P: 
Yeah. So, if he’s not toileted frequently enough, your bladder fills up, and are you familiar with 
autonomic dysreflexia?  
I: 
No. 
P: 
So, for people who have a spinal cord—a higher spinal cord injury, if your bladder fills up it stimulates 
your vagal nerve and you have a response [37.48] where your blood pressure goes really high. You get a 
headache, and so there’s risk for aneurysm rupture or stroke or just the general damage that extremely high 
blood pressure will cause, and then he was also possible for syncope or fainting or other things like that. And 
so, you have to either—his urinary bladder filling up, so you have to toilet him very quickly or use a catheter to 
empty his bladder. If you can’t—if he’s not—at this point if the autonomic dysreflexia goes too far, he’d be too 
weak to get out of a wheelchair. So, you’d have to catheterize him or call 911. 
I: 
So— 
P: 
And no training whatsoever in catheterization. So, you just stick it in there and get the urine out. No 
training in a septic technique at that point, and there was one time where I was called in the middle of the night 
to come catheterize him. 
I: 
He called you? 
P: 
Yeah. Said, “I don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna call 911 again.” So, I lived very close by. Rode my 
bicycle over, straight cath’d him in bed, made sure he was okay, took his blood pressure again, and then came 
back the next day. 
I: 
So, when you got there originally, he explained he had this—you knew he had this diagnosis, and he 
explained to you what it meant and what to look for? 
P: 
So, in the case of this particular client, he sort of built up to some of the more drastic things. Like I 
would get pieces of the story as to how he came to be this way, which I’m not gonna go into, but also, he didn’t 
come right out of the gate with—“If my face ever gets flush you need to stick a tube in my penis or I’ll die.” So, 
it built up to that. 
I: 
So, you had to learn that. 
P: 
Yeah. I had to learn that, and I mean he knows that, but I think he was afraid of scaring good 
employees off, so he would ease into those things too [35.25]. 
I: 
But eventually, over time, you learned how to recognize the signs that this was happening. 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah. And he wouldn’t always recognize it himself. Yeah. But most of the time I’d say he would. 
I: 
And then the response would be to take him to the bathroom. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah, and usually—and more often than not, 70% of the time, just stand him up, toilet him, 
you know. If he’s in the wheelchair, it’s get the wheelchair into the bathroom, get the electronic wheelchair into 
the bathroom, and get him out of that, and it’s hard to get—in a small one-bedroom very tiny apartment—it did 
have a walk-in shower, but not a lotta room for maneuvering two people and an electronic wheelchair and a 
quadriplegic to stand at the toilet or to even stand, pivot, sit on the toilet. So, those things—everything takes—
everything takes at least 20 minutes, and so that’s why these things would develop into an emergency 
because you can’t always get him to the toilet. 
I: 
You can’t move that fast. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kevin Kitchel. 6.12.18 
 
5
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And I’m wondering, I’m sitting here wondering—you said 8 hours a day, 7 days a week— 
P: 
His care was. I did not work 7 days a week. 
I: 
Right, right, but I’m wondering about, you know, the other 14 or the nights—the other hours in the day 
when he has to go to the bathroom and nobody’s there? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. There was a—we had a bowel regimen—or we made sure we emptied his ostomy, and 
burp it before bed, and then also toileting right before bed, and he would get dehydrated because he would be 
afraid to drink water [33.36]. 
I: 
Remind me what happened to him? 
P: 
His condition declined. He had cardiac fitness decline and ended up having to go to like a nursing 
home, and it was out of the area. 
I: 
So, this is interesting to me partly because he required so much, and you were physically able to do 
that. 
P: 
Absolutely, yeah. I was physically able to do it as a young man, but I don’t think that—it was definitely a 
lotta lifting. You know, lifting 200 pounds at a time, and that’s not safe to do alone, and definitely not a lot of 
people are willing to or capable of doing that. 
I: 
I’m just thinking you’re a guy, and you’re tall and everything, and I’m thinking of some of the PCAs I’ve 
been interviewing that are women, smaller, trying to do that without assistance. 
P: 
Yeah. Without mechanical assistance it’d be dangerous and impossible. 
I: 
So, I’m curious because at the beginning you said that you immediately took to this kind of work. That 
you loved it, and part of it was because you found him so— 
P: 
Oh, yeah. So, I’m not really talking about that, but he’s a very interesting man with a very interesting 
career. Through his work he had known celebrities, and had amazing stories, and had a very diverse set of 
interests that intersected with mine also. So, sharing stories with him he was very interested in counter-culture 
stuff that I was interested in too, and I mean we even—a friend of mine opened a farm-to-table restaurant in 
Grand Rapids, and I took him there. I took my client there, and he just loved it. That was one of the best days 
together [31.36]. I was going to this sort of underground speakeasy style pizza restaurant [laughing]. 
I: 
That’s a great story. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Do you have other stories with him? Like really cool experiences that will stay with you? Memories? 
P: 
Well, his stories about—he owned a business in the south that was—I don’t know how much I can say 
about him without— 
I: 
Yeah. Be careful with— 
P: 
But there was—he was involved with filming of some movies next to his business, and his stories about 
meeting celebrities and who he liked and who he didn’t like, and who was nice, and who was not or really cool. 
Some celebrities who were controversial in the news who he had met through his businesses. Somebody had 
said some offensive things—rumored to say some offensive things, and I go, oh, I can hear her saying that. 
So, just some of his stories, and he was a great story teller, were really interesting. He really liked to travel, and 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kevin Kitchel. 6.12.18 
 
6
so all of the things he really liked to do he was very limited from doing that based on his condition. So, I toured 
with bands, and he would love to hear about those stories. And not every 60-year-old man wants to hear—oh, I 
shouldn’t have said that, but not everyone of that age wants to hear stories about a teenage-punk band 
touring, but he was very interested and enthusiastic about art, and so that’s how we connected. 
I: 
So, I’m guessing—I know the answer to this, but tell me what’s the most rewarding thing about being a 
PCA? 
P: 
Certainly not the—the most rewarding this was not the financial reward ‘cause the pay was pretty poor, 
and the work at times was dangerous, but I had a very wonderful relationship—not just based on like our 
common interests but based on the trust that we had. He trusted me to take care of him, and that trust just 
feels good [29.26]. 
I: 
What’s the most challenging thing about being a PCA? 
P: 
The dangerous work. The potentially dangerous nature of the work where I’m alone, untrained with 
someone if there’s an emergency. I realize this client was maybe on the sicker end of the spectrum, and 
probably should have been in the care of licensed people, like a nurse, all the time, but he didn’t wanna do that 
for his freedom. So, I guess that aspect of the—that aspect of the— 
I: 
And talk just for a minute, and then we’ll move on from here, but about you provided a lot of really 
serious physical high-level care for this guy. But it also sounds like you felt you were providing other things as 
well. I mean you did mention the cooking, the cleaning, things like that — 
P: 
Well, food was very important to this client. When other people would just make oatmeal and syrup. 
There you go. And so, I would try to do things differently for him because he was so used to going to 
restaurants or so used to cuisine, and so bonding over things like, oh, okay. We’ve both got—he’s telling—he 
can’t cook, but he’s trying to work through me, and I’m trying to be his vessel in the kitchen or in other things 
trying to find art or movies that he enjoys, and so that was one of the great things that I really liked to do. And it 
was—I’m a vegetarian because I ethically don’t want to eat animals, so it was big barrier for me to breakdown 
and cook things like that for him and handle meat ‘cause it’s something that I don’t want to do. And so, bonding 
over things—I know  meal preparation doesn’t sound like a lot, but food is very important to people. Food and 
culture can be a very important, so that was a way for him to sort of experience the world or get away through 
him telling me how to cook, and us trying to do things together. He had some dietary limitations due to his 
ostomy, so he couldn’t eat a lot of fiber, and that’s all I’m used to eating [laughs]. 
I: 
So, food is important culturally, and socially, and all of those things you’ve mentioned, but it’s also 
necessary to stay alive. 
P: 
Yeah. So, also cooking things for him that are not just a cheese burger, so finding—I refuse to cook him 
unhealthy food, so blatantly unhealthy food like fried food, so yeah, it was not that—cooking healthy isn’t 
necessarily a challenge from my perspective, but that was another part of like, oh, hey, buddy. We can try—
let’s try this without the—let’s try a non-fried version of this, or we’ll try, like, oh, you like this food. Here’s the 
South American equivalent that’s more of a peasant food that’s not so rich, and you know, not the French 
version with all cream and eggs. 
I: 
Now, what were you trying to achieve by doing it that way instead of giving him oatmeal and syrup? 
P: 
Oh, just to increase his level of satisfaction with life in general ‘cause boring food sucks! And he’s 
trapped in an apartment, and so it’s kind of a way for him to escape and travel [25.44]. 
I: 
So, quality of life? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kevin Kitchel. 6.12.18 
 
7
P: 
Quality of like, exactly. 
I: 
Great. And you also talked about just bringing things like companionship. 
P: 
Yeah. And so, I know that he has—as a nurse I tend to focus on the medical aspects of it, but he was a 
wonderful man, very good friend, and was used to being very socially engaged, and was extremely isolated 
because of that. And so, he was, you know, hungry for friendship, and we found it, so. 
I: 
So, if you were going to describe to somebody what a PCA does, they have no clue what a PCA does, 
and they say, “Yeah. I’m a caregiver. I take care of this guy,” and that doesn’t tell you anything. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
How would you describe it? 
P: 
I would describe that work like being a new family member to somebody because you—not everybody 
takes the same level of—I guess I would describe that it is just like being a new family member. Everybody has 
a different approach to care and what it means, and every client has different needs, but you can’t just—you 
don’t just go clean somebody’s house and leave. You end up being emotionally invested in the work too, and I 
think that’s one of the reasons why that sort of emotional investment can be taken advantage of to pay people 
very little. But if I had to describe PCA work to somebody else, oh, jeez. That’s really hard to do because it 
encompasses such a broad aspect of it’s not just cleaning and toileting somebody. It’s all aspects of their care, 
understanding their wants and needs, and their likes and dislikes, and they may not be, especially someone 
who can’t communicate so well, that may not be immediately obvious. So, it can be like detective work trying to 
figure out somebody and what they say they want versus what’s best for them. Also, it can be just being a 
friend to [23.21] somebody ‘cause some clients can be very lonely. But it also can be very hard work, like lifting 
and you know, lifting somebody or somebody who’s had a fall that can be potentially dangerous situations for 
you where your risk is like a back injury. Otherwise it could be just taking your friend shopping or going out to 
eat with a friend that happens to be your client. So, I don’t have a single definition. I’m sorry. 
I: 
Well, you started off this conversation by saying you really loved problem solving. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And it seems like that’s an integral part of this job. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. That’s a very good point. Yeah. Problem-solving is a huge part of PCA work. I didn’t have to 
be involved in my client’s like legal affairs and get his disability stuff—that was all taken care of and had long 
been established, but for someone who has changes in condition or changes in insurance, I think it’s very 
appropriate for a PCA to be able to step in and have to solve a problem of, well, we’ve got—how are we gonna 
get you the care you need or how are we gonna make—how are we gonna feed you on a $100 this week? 
How are we gonna get you good nutrition with a limited amount of money. 
I: 
I’m thinkin’ how are we gonna get this catheter in or— 
P: 
How are we gonna get the—yeah. 
I: 
--wheelchair in the bathroom? How are we gonna [laughs]— 
P: 
Yeah. Also, those issues too. Yeah. How do I catheterize a guy when I have no idea what it is? It’s just 
a wobbly plastic tube that I’m supposed to put into where?  
I: 
And no family, the guy? 
P: 
My client did not have any family members locally.

I: 
And if he didn’t have PCAs? 
P: 
He would be dead [21.30]. 
I: 
He would be dead. 
P: 
Because he was too proud or too resistant and valued his freedom too much to go into assisted living, 
so he would have—he would not have been able to survive based on his pride and his independence without 
that. I mean he probably would not have let himself wither away and die, but he would not be alive without 
PCAs. So, literally, life-saving care. 
I: 
So, one of the reasons I was interested in talking with you, Ke, is because you went into this knowing 
you were going to become a nurse. This was a pathway to it, and I just want to follow that journey just for a 
minute. If you could talk about that journey to being a nurse, and what happened after PCA? And how did 
being a PCA—how has that affected who you are as a nurse? 
P: 
Oh, wow. That’s an excellent question. Being a PCA and having that experience before going into 
nursing definitely showed me about relating to people as a patient and understanding their needs right from the 
get-go. I think that’s a lesson that some new nurses it takes a while to learn to really be empathetic and think of 
how am I coming off as a caregiver from the client’s perspective? What do they want versus what do they 
need? And without that experience as a PCA it probably would have—I’m sure I would have eventually learned 
those lessons, but it took me a lot less time to be an empathetic nurse right from the get-go based on those. 
So, it’s a path that I really recommend for a lot of nurses rather than just go to school and be a nurse, is to do 
that type a care. And I’m not alone in that. A lot of nurses I work with they worked in nursing homes or they 
worked in private care, and they could not financially sustain that work. Maybe that wasn’t their ultimate goal. 
They also decided to be a nurse because—they wanted to be a nurse, and they also viewed that as a path 
forward—they viewed PCA work as a path forward into nursing, but definitely it prepared me to understand that 
there are—to be empathetic. It prepared me better with that aspect of it, and to understand that when I’m 
discharging a patient I have to understand what they’re  home life is gonna be like. Do they have a PCA? I 
have to assess the level of—I have to assess the PCA’s level of ability and knowledge, and to see if—does this 
person—is it safe for this person to go home [18.31]? Can I recommend that they do get someone like a PCA? 
Can I link them up with one of the agencies that can help pay for that if they can’t afford it themselves? But it’s 
definitely—being a PCA accelerated my knowledge of nursing process years, just in the months that I did it 
because I got—not only did I get to see my client and his issues and take him to medical appointments and 
things like that, and deal with other medical professionals and see interdisciplinary care, it also let me see—
‘cause he lived in a large apartment complex with people who also had PCAs, to see some of the quality of 
PCAs. Where there’s a very broad range of people who do high-quality work to people who are just there for a 
paycheck. 
I: 
So, if we wanted a high-quality PCA workforce, what would the requirements be? What would the 
qualifications be? 
P: 
Wow. That’s a good question. I don’t think that I have a good answer. I think that there are people out 
there doing research about that that do understand those things better than me because not everybody needs 
to have—not every client needs to be catheterized in the middle of the night. Some people do just need a 
trustworthy person to help them shower in the morning, and get through their day, and remember to do things if 
they have memory issues. So, because of the wide needs of patients, I don’t really have a good definition. 
Other than, you know, a criminal background check is necessary, in my opinion, and— 
I: 
I guess what I’m asking is you said you were able to distinguish, you know, the high quality PCAs from 
those that are just trying to get a paycheck?

P: 
Yeah. Unfortunately, you have to observe them in the field, so maybe some observation of them in the 
field would be an option, but I don’t know that would be— 
I: 
But  how did you distinguish between them? How could you tell the difference? 
P: 
Oh, that’s a tough question. How did I distinguish, my intuition? You know, can you see is the client 
flourishing or not, and then do I see the person—if I see the client, you know, are they struggling to eat in the 
dining room while the PCA is playing on their phone versus is the PCA engaged in conversation and in their 
life, and does the client seem to want them to even be there rather than just I need you for when I go to the 
bathroom? 
I: 
So, they need—should have a background check. What about training? 
P: 
Yeah. Definitely training in body mechanics and moving people, and what to do in case of emergencies. 
I don’t know if everybody needs to have BLS training, but definitely some things that will protect you. Also, 
some understanding about what’s legal for you to do and not to do, and what’s outside of your scope of 
practice, and what’s illegal? Am I [laughs], am I embezzling from my patient and not realizing it? I don’t—it’s 
things like that [14.59]. 
I: 
The boundaries. 
P: 
Yeah. Boundaries—legal and moral boundaries. Although, again, those are probably different for each 
patient—some of the moral boundaries. Based on if the patient has family members that are involved in care. 
Sorry, I don’t have a very definitive definition of what— 
I: 
It’s okay. You’re doing great. Would training have helped you? 
P: 
Yes. Absolutely. I definitely was in some unsafe lifting situations where not just training but a few tools 
to help me pick up and move a client—belts and things like that that we didn’t have. Yeah. It was—I’m 
surprised and glad I didn’t get hurt. 
I: 
Did you learn about belts like gait belts after? 
P: 
Yes. Gait belts came later. 
I: 
So, you got into nursing school, and you learned about gait belts and you go, whoa. That woulda been 
helpful. 
P: 
Could a used this, yeah. So, I actually ended up [laughing] giving him a gait belt, you know, buying a 
gait belt for him like later on. 
I: 
And then you used it with him or— 
P: 
No. After I— 
I: 
After you had gone on? 
P: 
Yeah. After I had gone on I ended up visiting, you know, ‘cause I would visit him [13.43], and so we still 
keep up, and I gave him a gait belt,  yeah. 
I: 
So, you keep in touch with him? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Good for you. So, we have this critical shortage. It’s pretty dramatic. It’s estimated that in Michigan 
alone we’re gonna need 32,000 more PCAs by 2020.

P: 
That’s shocking! That’s a shocking—that’s shocking, and I—wow. 
I: 
Where are we gonna get them? 
P: 
Well, the PCAs that I know are retirees who are, you know, they’re not working, and I know a lady who 
is—she’s in her 80s and she’s taking care of a person—demented lady who’s younger than herself [12.55]. 
And that’s one source of PCAs—is to find people who are, you know, who have already had a career, and 
maybe even have taken care of children and understand what’s involved in caring for another person. And they 
can make extra money there, but the work can also be way to physically demanding for a retiree. It’s 
different—I did not meet any young people who were PCAs. I didn’t know anyone under 25 who was doing that 
work, so that seems like a group of people who could do the work, but I don’t know. Maybe also—since the 
work is—it’s not inherently dangerous, but potentially dangerous, and it pays so little, there are very few people 
who are gonna wanna do that—wanna step into a job like that. So, if we had better funding and some—I don’t 
know if oversight is necessary, but training to understand like, hey, this is a dangerous situation to put yourself 
in. Then maybe then we could find more people to do the work. 
I: 
So, pretend for a moment you’re a recruiter. You’re maybe goin’ to the high school and you’re setting 
up a recruiting table, or the college or the senior center, what would you tell them to try to convince them that 
this was a good field to go into? 
P: 
Well, I think that if you’re gonna—it would be a good way to suggest it as a path forward to nursing. A 
lotta nurses I know don’t try that first or I worked in nursing school, there were people who felt that they—once 
they got into school they had very good grades but no experience with patients. They found themselves hating 
the work. Well, a really easy way to find out with low-barrier to entry, that if you like patient care work or 
working with other people, is to be a PCA. So, maybe selling that aspect of it would be a good idea especially 
to recruit younger people. 
I: 
You’d have to say, okay, it doesn’t pay very much. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
But— 
P: 
It’s extremely valuable experience in my opinion especially for someone who’s going to be a nurse. 
You’ll find out right away if you don’t like poop or if you don’t like helping—the care of other people—and if you 
have the patience required to deal with someone who operates at a pace that’s not your own. 
I: 
So, it requires patience? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. A lot of patience. 
I: 
And problem-solving skills and some patience? 
P: 
I’d say patience over problem-solving skills. A lot more patience [9.52]. 
I: 
You also mentioned empathy. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah. If you don’t have empathy, it can help you build it too. But it definitely requires 
empathy. I would say that it’s—throughout my whole process of going from being an IT worker to being in 
healthcare changed me a whole lot. 
I: 
In what way? 
P: 
A lot more empathetic, and I was working for the government, my views had made me very cynical—or 
my experience had made my views very cynical about not just the political process but how the world worked. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kevin Kitchel. 6.12.18

And so, working in patient care has sort of brought me back from being so cynical, and pessimistic about 
people in general. 
I: 
So, I’ve worked in a medical school for the last 22 years, and we talk a lot about how do we teach 
future physicians about empathy, about being empathetic? 
P: 
Oh, well, make them go be a PCA for a few days a week. Have them do a clinical where they are 
seeing real people’s day-to-day routines and struggles, and it can force that. I know medical students are—the 
pathophysiology is their main focus, and that’s all they wanna know about because they’ve got a test to do. But 
if they’re forced to do some experience and reflect on that, nursing school they’re forced to do that ‘cause 
empathy is a huge part of nursing. I don’t know if doctors do spend time in the community as PCAs? Do they 
here at the [8.07]— 
I: 
No. 
P: 
I think that maybe a trial of that sort of a requirement but structured in a way that its dense ‘cause I 
know medical students’ time is precious—could help them understand the same things that I understand about 
you’re gonna get good care in the hospital, but once you go outside, like it’s kind of a wild west situation. And I 
think it maybe takes a while for—I don’t think medical students understand that until they’ve been practicing for 
a while. 
I: 
So, just a couple more questions. Do you have words for the policymakers? If we are really going to get 
32,000 more PCAs, we need to do something about the labor conditions. We need to place more value on 
older adults and the people who take care of them. So, what advice would you have for the policymakers? Let 
me back up for just a minute. You clearly believe that PCAs have value—the work that they do is valuable. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
How would you convince somebody else, like a policymaker, that the work is valuable? 
P: 
My client specifically, you know, PCA’s a life and death matter for him because he would refuse more 
acute care. But for somebody who’s not so—who doesn’t have such a high acuity, this is a quality of life issue 
that’s pretty easily resolved. I mean the PCA work, you know, they may not be paid a living wage yet, but if a 
PCAs paid a living wage, the return on investment and quality of life is—I can’t think of another field where that 
level of investment would yield such an improvement in quality of life. So, there may not be a huge financial 
return on investment for investing more into that field, there potentially would be in decreased hospitalizations 
and readmissions and, you know, 30-day readmissions where now the hospital and therefore the hospital has 
to pay for it. So, that would be less of a drag on the economy as a whole, but the quality of life is so improved 
by quality PCAs over the absence of one or a disengaged PCA that—I can’t see another field where—or 
another industry or another field of work where a little bit of money goes so far [4.57] in quality of life. 
I: 
Okay. Let’s say you convinced me. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
What do you want me to do about it? 
P: 
Trial grant funding to—for increased funding for PCAs and to be studied, and if that’s proven to be—if 
those studies prove that improved quality of life, decreased hospital readmissions, and chronic conditions, I 
can’t see why—if there was evidence to suggest that, then you’d have to act. 
I: 
So, let’s say there is evidence, ‘cause there is now evidence about well-trained PCAs making a 
difference in terms of ER visits and falls and nursing home placements. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

P: 
Well, look at the pie of healthcare spending versus the rest of the economy in America and understand 
that the investment in PCAs can shrink that pie, shrink that piece of the pie. If you wanna look at it from a 
numbers only basis, but votes on quality of life issues also, and so I know the elderly vote [laughs]. 
I: 
That’s a good point. 
P: 
The elderly do vote, so anything that you can do to help out the elderly is generally a vote getter. 
I: 
Okay. So, if we were gonna improve the lives of PCAs and make it a more viable career/field to be in, 
you know, professionalize it, can you think of policy changes or regulatory changes— 
P: 
Some protections. I don’t—a lot of the PCAs that I know were on Medicaid, and you know, what sort 
of—they’re not paid at a rate where they can afford private insurance, so they are also a fringe person—
someone on the fringe of the economy related to their own—not only just their income, but their own like safety 
net. Like they don’t have—they have worse health coverage than the person that they’re taking care of, and so 
in some ways they’re also an at-risk-person, so if you can decrease their risk with insurance, with expanded 
Medicare or Medicaid or some sort of insurance pool. I don’t know. Decreasing their amount of risk and 
allowing somebody who maybe wants to do that work, but one of the barriers to entry would be the fact that 
they can’t—that they can’t make that leap because they can’t afford the work, or they can’t—the health 
insurance is not there for them, that may prevent them from doing that work. If you can get that barrier out of 
the way, maybe you’ll also see some more people in. 
I: 
Okay. I don’t have any other questions except do you have any final words? Anything you want to tell 
the world about PCAs and PCA work? 
P: 
Well, it’s been a really rewarding and lifechanging journey for me that was all started by being a PCA, 
and now as a nurse, when I take care of patients who do have a PCA, and that PCA is involved in their care in 
the hospital, it just makes things so much easier. I can educate the PCA on things [1.17], and they can tell me 
so much about the client—their wants, their needs. I can say, hey, we cannot eat bacon everyday for 
breakfast, and maybe keep this person with CHF out of the hospital. So, we can directly educate the PCAs and 
I always find that—whenever I have them in the hospital, I’m glad to have them around because they’re always 
such a great help. And I do feel if they improve their quality of life for the patient while they’re in the hospital, 
they’re doin’ the same thing in the field. 
I: 
Those are good words to end on. So, I want to thank you again for this interview. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
This was great. And for the work that you do. 
P: 
Thank you. 
I: 
You did a great job. Thank you. I’m gonna turn these off, and just let you know that you’ve got me 
thinking. I was having a lot of ideas just based on some of the comments you made about things we can do. In 
fact, I’m hoping to eventually do some work with the nursing school, and maybe some joint training, and I just a 
planning grant [end part 1]. 
P: 
Okay, I just didn’t know if those would be appropriate. 
I: 
We’re doing part 2 here with Ke, who’s going to share a couple more stories. All right, so Ke I can set 
this up. As I just said a lot of the people we’re interviewing really want the world to know that PCA work is 
valuable, that it’s rewarding, that they almost feel a calling, but there are other PCAs out there that are just 
doing it for a paycheck. There’s a wide range of PCAs. You know, we need 32,000 more workers, but we don’t 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kevin Kitchel. 6.12.18

want just warm bodies. We want people who know what they’re doing, who are kind. You’ve had some 
experiences with PCAs who maybe don’t fit that description. 
P: 
So, I’ve had some darker experiences with PCAs. My very first day [5.59] of work, I show up early in the 
morning, and I ride my bicycle up to the apartment complex, and I hear a growl [makes a growling sounds] 
coming form the bushes, and as I’m locking my bike up it’s still going on. I [laughing] don’t know what I’m 
gettin’ into. I figure this is someone who lives there, who’s maybe mentally ill ‘cause there are a lot of disabled 
people in this apartment complex where I’m going to. And a woman emerges in a loose knit sweater with very 
short cut-off jeans, and nothing underneath the sweater. So, she’s nude with large sagging, pendulous breasts, 
and she says to me, “I’m sayin’ my prayers to God.” And I thought, oh great, this is one of the residents that I 
have to deal with. This is—she’s just a—I don’t think I’m doing her visual appearance justice, but it was—it just 
looked crazy, and so turns out she is also one of the PCAs who works at the apartment complex. Not a 
resident, and so that’s just one of the examples of some of the people that I worked with who I thought I can’t 
believe that this person takes care of somebody instead of having someone take care of them because she 
was mentally ill or had the appearance of someone who was mentally ill. And [laughing] just seemed like she 
was not fit to take care of herself let alone somebody else, and some of the other darker stories I have—the 
darkest story I have is that—so taking care of my client and getting him healthy, good food that was a way for 
him to experience the world and for him to eat healthy, but also having like each meal be like a little travel log 
[laughing], so like with a theme. Like this is a South American meal or this is, you know, we’re eating Polish 
peasant food today. Some of the other PCAs would just drive him to Arby’s, get something from the drive-
through, then they go park the car, leave him in it, and score drugs somewhere—I don’t think that I would know 
that they come back to work high, but definitely for later use. Also, I’ve heard about PCAs being drunk on the 
job, so drunk they could barely stand, and these clients, these patients are too—it’s hard for them to find PCAs, 
so they can’t fire these people because then they’ll have no one to take care of them. 
I: 
And they can’t find PCAs, so they’re not going through an agency. 
P: 
Unfortunately, some of the people I’m describing were vetted through an agency. 
I: 
Really? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Hmm. Those are dark stories, and I appreciate you sharing them with us because I know there is a 
wide range, and I said earlier we, you know, we’re trying to professionalize this field, and have professional 
standards and keep people safe with good quality of life. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And that requires some sort of structure or regulatory standards. Would you agree? 
P: 
I agree. To be fair to the lady who I described as mentally ill, her caregiver loved her, and they did have 
a close bond even if I don’t think she did the best job of necessarily taking the client—taking care of the client 
she was—I have to add that they did have a very close bond. 
I: 
Well, good for you for adding that. This is important, and I’m glad you mentioned it, but I’m thinking one 
of the differences between home care and nursing home care or assisted living is that it’s all done within the 
privacy of someone’s house. 
P: 
So, there’s no oversight, potentially very dangerous situations, especially as I described with leaving a 
patient in the car—leaving a quadriplegic in a car while you’re going into a house to score drugs [1.13], totally 
unattended in who knows what neighborhood, that’s a—

Kevin Kitchel. 6.12.18

I: 
So, a recipe for all kinds of horrible things to happen including abuse. 
P: 
Yeah. Mmm hmm. Abuse, neglect. 
I: 
Financial abuse, physical abuse, all kinds of things, and no oversight. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And the client doesn’t have much recourse. 
P: 
No recourse because if—this particular client he can’t find people to take care of him. If he fires 
somebody it takes so long for him to find somebody else that—even one that he doesn’t trust. Just anybody, 
like you said, a warm body. It takes even time to find a warm body, which is just not an option for him. So, you 
know, there’s a one-in, one-out sort of situation with him, so if he wants to get rid of somebody he almost has 
to have somebody lined up to take their place. 
I: 
So, those are great examples of why we need some sort of structure and support around this 
workforce, and I appreciate you sharing them with us. 
P: 
Yup. 
I: 
We will now conclude this interview. 
P: 
Okay.
