Cold winter passed away, 
And the summer time has come; 
The snoozer and the bummer, 
They most all take a 
rest. 
Young men will go out, 
And they'll sport themselves about 1 
While I 
have to seek my living, 
In the mighty far off West. 
There's old Buffalo, 
The mate town of Chicago, 
On the Er-i-e canal; 
Shure I'll have to go to say.

Oh to break stones in a

Who no one would take by the hand,

By the sweat of my brow to get bread, 
Now I'm tould by the young generation, 
To swim out, I'm over my head.

Take a

Part your hair in the middle, McNally, 
Swim out for you're over your head.

Whin you drink 'till ould death makes you

But since I

Now I'm tould by the grand committee, 
To swim out, I'm over my head. 
They say shoot, &c.

I'm acquainted wid all of the bould undet-

You've heard of the Mulligan Guards, 
And Captain Jinks so gay, 
But we're the Fogaity Musketeers, 
We're very proud to say. 
We charged each man five dollars a 
head, 
And how do you like our style? 
Our company is rather small— 
We fall in single file.

We've been turning out for years, 
Give us three hearty welcome cheers; 
Stop the car, shout Hurrah, 
For the Fogarty Musketeers.

We had the Curbstone band, 
He played March on the Rhein, 
And the deadheads on the sidewalk 
Did pivot to the time. 
We went up Worth street, and down Broadway, 
And then through Manhattan Alley, 
Of course we stopped in Mulberry street 
To get a 
wreath off Mrsiallie. 
Cuo:—We've been turning out for years, &c.

When we arrived at East New York 
The band did play away, 
The nigger he commenced to kick 
And squealed out for his pay. 
Of course that bursted the company up, 
And filled my eyes with tears, 
And I 
knew I'd never turn cut again 
With no Fogarty Musketeers.

We crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards, 
From the seventh ward below: 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
A 
Tipperary man— 
He carried his sword like the Russian Duke; 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORUS. 
We shouldered guns 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Md. 
Egan Guards. 
2. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the 
Connemarro pet, 
With the Rub, dub, dub, we march in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red boys, 
To show where we came from; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
we marched to the beat of the drum. 
CI10:—We shouldered guns, /cc. 
When we'd get home at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sleep; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of Whisky, strong and neat. • 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
Lull march in the Mulligan Guard.

In the Year of ninety-eight; 
'Twas never called in and ye can't begin

From Ireland to Bombay, 
And the only time it can be seen 
Is on St. Patrick's day.

That warbles in the air; 
As they hop about from limb to limb, 
For the troubles of this world they

The reason I 
will tell: 
I'm in love, as you can plainly see, 
With a 
fascinating roguish little belle.

And as pretty as the red rose, 
Is the roguish little beauty, Emaline I

received a 
billet-doux this morning 
From one in love, I 
ween, 
Which has made me happy all day long, 
'Twas from the little beauty, Emaline; 
And she sweetly said, she wished to see 
me, 
She named the place and time; 
EA, of course, you know, I 
will be there, 
- As I 
know I'm going to make this beauty 
mine.

My Little Bunch of Roses 
Words and Music by Win. H. Delehanty. 
AM waiting here to meet my darl-
ing., 
And my heart is in a 
flutter of delight, 
For we kissed last night when we were 
parting, 
And this is where she bid me come 
to-night. 
When away from her I 
am so lonely, 
I 
know not what to do, 
But her bright, sweet smile can evet 
cheer me, 
Her heart is warm and true. 
Oh I 
When we kissed then I 
saw her pretty 
blushes, 
She turned her face away the blush 
to hide, 
'
20 
31 
I 
was happy with my bunch of roses, 
My little bunch of roses by my side. 
There is something that I 
must not tell, 
And that is where this maid does dwell; 
In her hair she wears a 
white camelia, 
And a 
dark blue is the color of her eyes, 
And I 
call her my little bunch of roses, 
My darling, charming, captivating prize. 
It was in those happy days of childhood, 
When first I 
met this roguish little' 
belle, 
By a streamlet running through the 
wild wood, 
Though but a 
boy, in love with her I 
fell. 
She is now the pride of all the city, 
Of Summers, sweet sixteen, 
And is called by all a 
perfect beauty, 
A 
fawn-like, fairy queen. 
Oh I 
Now I 
meet her-almo—st everfeve_nin_g), 
And I 
think it is the—sweetest thing 
in life, 
For to walk with the flower of my affeo-
-`, 
tion, 
Especially when she's soon to be my 
wife. 
There is something, etc. 
Twee an evening when the moon was 
shining, 
The little stars were twinkling far 
above, 
Arm-in-arm we were walking in the 
garden, 
'Twas there and then we both revealed 
our love. 
So I 
asked ,her then if she would. take 
me, 
For better or for worse, 
4 
When she smiled on me so very sweetly. 
And answered, " Yes, of course." Oh t 
confess that I 
never was so happy, 
Nor do I 
think that ever I 
could be, 
Vil I've married my little bunch of 
roses, 
There is something that I 
must not tell, 
And that is where this maid dees dwell: 
In her hair she wears a 
white ca.melia, 
And a 
dark blue is the color of her eyes, 
And I 
call her my little bunch of roses, 
itly darling, charming, captivating prize.

Love Among The Roses. 
Written by W. H. Delehanty, and sung 
by the Wonderful Delehanty ..t 
Hengler. 
T 
was on one summer evening 
In the merry month of June. 
I 
beheld a 
damsel sitting, 
'3Iid flowers' sweet perfume. 
She had a 
novel reading, 
Just as I 
was passing by, 
And as she turned another page, 
I 
saw the brightest eye. 
A 
bewitching smile was on her face, 
As charming as the posies, 
I 
felt the smart of Cupid's dart, 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now I 
hate.to tell but then I 
must 
Within her heart I 
place my trust,

34 
She was sitting in the garden 
Where the little butterfly reposes, 
And how we met I'll ne'er forget—... 
'Twas Love among the Roses. 
Now I 
passed her house next evening, 
The clock had just struck eight, 
And I 
saw my future happiness, 
She was standing by the garden gate. 
She smiled as I 
approached her 
And I 
begged her to excuse, 
May I 
view those pretty flowers, 
She murmured if you choose. 
I 
spoke about the violets, 
Then finally made pro-poses, 
rhro' the garden we walked, of happiness 
talked 
'Twas love among tile roses. 
Now I 
hate to tell, etc.

Matilda, that's her name 
And there is a

Which I

She dresses up to fashion, 
To her style there is no end, 
And of course must look dashing 
For she wears a 
Grecian Bend, 
But she's left her home and where she's 
gone, 
Most every one supposes, 
For as dear as life is my little wife 
'Twas love among the roses.

A. Starry Night for a 
Ramble, 
As sung by Gus Williams. 
-I 
LIKE a 
game at Croquet 
Or bowling on the green 
I 
like a 
little boating 
To pull against the stream 
But of all the games that I 
love best 
To fill me with delight, 
I 
like to take a ramble 
Upon a 
starry night 
CHORUS 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, 
In a 
flow'ry dell, 
Through the bush and bramble 
Kiss and never tell. 
Talk about your bathing 
Or strolling on the sands, 
Or some unseen verandah 
Where gentle zephyr fans, 
Or rolling home in the morning boys 
And very nearly tight. 
Could never beat a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
49 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, etc. 
tlike to take my sweetheart 
" 
Of course you wnald." said he 
Lnd softly whisper in her ear 
" 
How dearly Dove you," 
And when you picture to yourselves 
The scenes of such delight, 
You'll want to take a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, et*. 
Some will choose a 
velocipede 
And others take a 
drive, 
And some will sit and mope at home 
Half dead and half alive. 
And some will choose a 
steamboat, 
And others even fight, 
but I'll enjoy my ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, sto.

IN THE BOWERY. 
Tow 
nr PASTOR'S Great Sensational Bong. 
AIR.—" Picadi2ly." 
[This song has been callea for nightly for months 
in succession, having been sung by Mr, PASTOR Innis 
own inimitable style, and been received with thun-
ders of applause. 
OME say that Central Park's the place, 
For fun of every kind; 
Dn Broadway and Fifth Avenue 
Much pleasure others find. 
But I'm a 
different sort of a 
chap 
No fun in that I 
see, 
For when I 
want enjoyment 
The Bowery for me. 
Spoken. — Yes, you may talk about your 
Broadway belles, your Fifth Avenue swells, 
your exquisitely-dressed creatures, with their 
41: 
lavender kids, and their la-de-da's, now, what 
do they know about enjoyment? They are 
afraid to go in for a 
little fun for fear of disar-
ranging their toilets: and then what would Mrs. 
Grundy say? " Charles Frederick Augustus is 
getting decidedly vulgar; Seraphina Emelia is 
positively shocking!" But here in the Bowery 
people enjoy themselves just when they feel like 
it. 
They don't care a 
curse what others may 
say, for that's the custom. 
CHORUS. 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
For beautiful gir:s with bright eyes and dark 
curls, 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
That's where - reside when I'm home. 
No butterflies of fashion there, 
Or idlers may be found. 
But men with open hearts and hands. 
With honest labor browned; 
• 
45 
Yen who to help a 
friend in need, 
Would theilast dollar lend, 
Who never live on other folks, 
But earn the cash they spend. 
S,poken. — Yes, there is no place in toe Bow-
ery tor those well-dressed corner statues to try 
to look like 
millionaire's sons, while their 
mothers are out scrubbing for a 
dollar a 
day to 
support them in idleness. 
A fellow nas no 
business on the east side of town unless he 
wants to work and earn his own living. 
What 
fortune is there more honorable tnan that of a 
working min. 
There was Washington, he was 
a 
farmer, and Franklin a 
printer. Warren a 
doc-
tor. 
Andy Johnson a 
tailor. 
Abe Lincoln 
a 
rail-splitter, and Grant a 
tanner. 
If you 
want to see men who make our country great, 
who add to her wealth, develop her resources, 
maintain her strength and prosperity, you will 
always and them— 
In the Bowery, &C. 
The other day a 
well-dressed fop, 
While walking throu+gh the street, 
Insulted a 
poor working girl 
With whom he chanced to meet 
A 
young mechanic came along, 
And heard the words he said, 
He soon pitched in to the fop 
And on bin put a 
head. 
Spoken.—Y 
es, hb laid the coward/3, rascal 
out. " Now," he says, "git up and git, and 
if ever I 
catch you insulting a 
female again Ill 
add a 
French roof to that head I've put on you. 
The dandy quietly sneaked away: the young 
lady turned to her preserver, with tears in her 
eyes, and said; " My dear sir, how can I 
ever 
thank you for the kindness which you have 
shown me in protecting me from the insults of 
43i 
that ruffian and I 
hope sir, we shall meet again. 
Do you live near here ? Certainly, young lady, 
Pm always found— 
When dark rebellion raised its bead, 
And war o'er spread the land, 
When rushed unto Columbia's aid 
Each gallant hero band, 
Among the foremost on the field, 
Amid the battle's noise, 
Upholding still our starry flag; 
Was found the Bowery boys 
Spoken. — When the call came for soldiers in 
the hour of danger, the Bowery was the first to 
send its voluntoers, and nobly did they do their 
duty. 
Who does not remember that incident 
at the battle of Antietam, when the enemy 
charged in full force, one brave regiment brave-
ly stood its ground, under a 
terrific fire and 
changed the tide of seeming defeat to one of 
glorious victory. 
This was noticed by Genera! 
McClellan, who exclaimed; " What regim.i.t. 
is this? " " New York Volunteers," was ',he

CRIME. 
• 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
'vE been thinking of late, I've been think 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder. 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
()ries Old Uncle Sam, it's a "poser," 
There's something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir. 
Why crime should increase in our land, 
im sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Omr banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
.true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
ifluldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
• 
Guarded by night and by day; 
Vile you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would 'make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care s 
groat, sir. 
Politicians', you feed a 
whole lot, sir. 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
Can you .‘
ruider at crime, can you wonder, 
When you see the, police,on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinning, 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd,pick.for a 
shilling, 
And the la 
cannottouch him they say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision,

So beautiful and airy, 
Is my darling roguish Cora 
With hair of golden hue; 
Of my love I'm ever thinking, 
Yet it is beyond the speaking, 
Though I

But of her I

She's as plump as can be, 
Blue eyes with which she se,s.ns me, 
Has my darling roguish Cora, 
With hair of golden hue: 
She confessed that she did love me, 
And then said that she would wed me, 
When I 
told her I 
adored her, 
I 
was happy I 
tell you. 
Clionns.—My roguish Cora, ke. 
So a 
wedding there'll be, 
And we'll have guests o'er plenty, 
The bride roguish Cora,

Do not wait then for another, 
For I

I 
helped her to the nices, and filled her glass with 
pride,

We met again one afternoon, and as we were 
alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd 
be my own ; 
She blushed and said go see papa and ask him if 
I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny 
when you feel that way. 
I 
felt as though, &c. 
The old man said we might wed

And I 
shall be a

You'll have to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany

So she said, &c. 
This is what he said — 
its no use you talking to me; said Nicodemus! 
For I 
intend a 
going out to sea, 
Out to China for zi;oucliong and Lingo Tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo, in fact you can't get

Direct from Hong Kong, Australia. 
When you send to me a

THE FACTORY GIRL OF MANCHESTER, 
As sung by JENNIR ENGLE. 
II WAS down in Lancashire in the wintry 
month cf. March 
To commence my unhappy little story: 
I 
met a 
little lass, whom none could surpas.cs 
But she's left me alone in my glory. 
She wore a 
blue print gown, and a 
shawl on her 
arm, 
And a 
handkerchief, the color I've forgotten; 
She'd a 
charming little head, the hair of which 
was red, 
And smothered all over with cotton. 
CHORUS. 
I 
brought her up to town into Westminster, 
She was highly delighted with the dancing; 
And her pretty little clogs went tap, tap, tap, 
And I 
couldn't keep her still for her prancing. 
She said she was single, and would like to wed, 
To some one who was a 
famous Comic Singer, 
Then she said to me I'd like to marry thee, 
If thou'll place the little ring upon my finger, 
to 
f
ran
f' 
as quick as thought, and the little gem I 
bought, 
And gave it her forever, as I 
told her; 
But the naughty little Miss, a 
few weeks after 
this, 
Was married to a 
six foot soldier. 
I 
brought her, &c. 
What these pretty girls will do to lovers kind 
and true, 
how they fool them, tea.-
-_;e 
them, and despis( 
them: 
Until it is too late and they have joined. their fat 
By wedding thOse who know not how to pri7A 
them. 
So you see I've lost the girl, who I 
thought I 
priceless pearl, 
It serves me right for being such a 
spooney, 
So young lads beware, of this factory girl taki 
care, 
Or like me you'll become a 
perfect looney. 
I 
brought her, &c.

Dancing in the Moonlight. 
[Written and composed by W ILLIAx DiumuANTY4 
\NE pleasant summer evening 
Some lady friends of mine, 
Did give a 
moonlight pie-nie 
And I 
was asked to join; 
The time and place was stated 
And finally we met, 
flow anxiously I 
waited, 
I 
never shall forget. 
The time came round and there was 
found, 
All as bright as sunlight— 
the ladies fair, with flowing hair, 
Were dancing in the moonlight. 
CHORUS.

Balz.nce to your partners! 
All prom-
enade ! 
A 
sweet one then came to me, 
With smile as bright as sunlight, 
And soon we both were happy, 
While dancing in the moonlight., 
But soon we left the dancers 
And sought a 
shady nook, 
And while they danced the Lancers, 
A 
private chat we took. 
The music from.a distance 
Oame wafted on the breeze, 
'Twas food for our love's cadence, 
And set our hearts at ease. 
We spoke of love, the stars above, 
That shower'd on us their bright HON 
In dusk and dew I 
bent me low 
And kissed her in the moonlight.

Alamande, corners, er.4. 
The dancing now was over 
And here and there were found, 
The gentle love and lover 
Conversing on the ground; 
But where was me and mine-own ? 
Unnoticed by the rest— 
In bliss until then unknown, 
Lill's head lay on my breast; 
'Twas then she sweetly answered "Yes," 
Which almost killed me outright— 
The memory bright of that sweet night, 
Comes dancing in the moonlight.
