The snow was a 
falling, 
One cold Winter morning; 
A 
man stood a 
begging 
On a 
corner, alone. 
Policemen patrolling, 
Look'd at him scorning— 
They turned a 
deaf ear 
To his piteous moan. 
In his tatter'd old rags 
Ile stood, wan and trembling; 
A 
poor human creature, 
With death in his eyes. 
Please give me charity— 
I'm not dissembling ? 
He's only a 
vagrant, 
Oh ! let him alone. 
Alone and forsaken! 
Never complaining,

statue 
Of hard marble stone. 
The w14,1:314- illy moaning,

if t'were condoning 
The poor sadden'd outcast 
From society thrown. 
In the wOrld, he sighed, 
I'm a 
wreck of humanity; 
They deny me, existence; 
I 
ask myself why ? 
Have I 
fallen so low, 
That e'en christianity 
Calls me a 
vagrant, 
And says—let him die 
'Unconsciously strolling, 
Toward the dark river, 
Where he watch'd the mad river 
Flowing swift on; 
Ile murmued, I'd better 
Go back to my Giver, 
Pleading for mercy— 
I'd no right to be born. 
Since the daps of my childhood, 
I've fought destitution, 
Suffered starvation, 
No sunshine e'er nigh. 
A 
whisper came to him, 
from the dark rolling water s 
You're only a 
vagrant, 
Come here and die 1

011! I'm an Irish laborer, 
Hardy, stout and strong; 
Idleness I

I've still the strength and will to toil 
For the wants of life are dear, 
But tould, whene'er I

No Irish wanted here!

Laughs aloud till the tears down his cheeks run clear.; 
And the lads in the village they know right well, 
What a

I 
sighed, " Pretty Polly, what a

And she said, get along, or I'll tell Grandpa."

There's Castle Garden, down below,

Ev'ry clay a

Dumps a 
load of Dutch. 
BisTaark rules in Germany, 
The home of lager bier— 
Walk Avenue A, you'll surely say, 
That Germany's over here. 
There's Italian's down in Crosby street, 
Some fat, and others bony;

Don't you think he'd a 
terrible gaul ? 
In mountain streams you will catch trout. 
Buy your bait at Tuckers. 
Boston for beans, New York for sardines, 
And in bar-rooms you find the sucker. 
Whenever you strike a 
boarding-house 
Where the hash is heavy as lead, 
Tread water quick, make a 
stiff kick, 
Swim out! You're over your head I 
In a 
grocery store, of a 
summer's day, 
A 
snoozer was spending his time: 
He choked with a 
moon, 
Swept himself up with a 
broom— 
And still you wonder at crime.

Of misery, in the tombs. 
When you. go see your girl 
On Wednesday night, 
And her father thinks you're a 
gal, 
have your pantaloons stout, 
Or you'll get fired out 
On the end of her father's old boot 
Mary had a 
littlo kitten 
She christen'd it P-a- t, 
But when it grew up, 
She found out her mistake, 
It wasn't that kind of a 
cat. 
I 
got drunk the other night, 
And put a 
head on a 
policer, 
I'm sorry to hear the death of greenbacks, 
For you'll get cockeyed carrying specie. 
If your wife at„homo has too much tongue, 
And atinoys you with her jaw, 
Swap her off for a 
poodle dog, 
And throw in your mother-in-law. 
If I 
sing any more, you'll show me a 
cork, 
'Twill take away my breath; 
I'd rather eat a 
snake,' or set up at a 
wake,' 
Than talk you folks to death.

HARRIGAN'S DREAM, 
Dedicated to Messrs. HARRIGAN & Marx, 
Er ROM= MCKAY. 
The " Mulligan Guard" turned out in force 
In the " Patrick's- thy Parade ;" 
The " Skidmorcs," too, were also there— 
A 
fine display they made. 
It was remarked by every one, 
As they " Down Broadway" did go. 
There were no finer men in all 
The " Regular Army, Oh." 
Ciaonus. 
With banners flying, music playing 
Opera aIrs from ATOTtle A; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glancing, 
So they marched away. 
" 
The Ould Hat," blocked for fifty cents, 
Again gleamed 'mid the throng, 
And 
McNamara " proud's a 
lord, 
Beneath it marched along; 
Ile heeded not the n 
nighty boys; 
But from a 
well-filled can, 
Drank frequent healths to Ireland, with 
" 
Muldoon, the Solid Man." 
C1101075. 
With banners flying music playing 
Opera airs from Avenue A; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glancing, 
So they marched away. 
Next came " The Gallant Sixty-Ninth"-
Sweet Kitty O'Neil, of course, 
Was there, and looked perfection, on 
A 
cream-complexioned horse; 
And oh, what shouts and joyful cries 
Were heard along the street. 
When, recognized by every one, 
Passed by " Old Uncle Pete." 
CHORUS. 
With banners flying, music playing 
Opera airs from Avenue A; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glancing, 
So they marched away. 
And then the seedy " Scandal Club," 
The gawks, devoid of guile; 
Passed by then the " N..E. F. C." 
In " r-,,ale McMullin Style. 
And so they went; but then, of course, 
I 
don't intend to name 
The half of them, for I 
awoke 
And found—'twas all a 
dream!

ONLY BE KIND. 
AS 
sung by FRANK COBURN. 
Why turn away when I 
draw near ? 
Why cold to-day ? once I 
was dear; 
Then thy heart stirred, and flushed thy brow; 
Never a 
word comes to me now— 
Now thy hand lies listless in mine; 
Once its replies spake love divine; 
Cold as if we never had met; 
Can it then be hearts can forget ? 
Cirouus. 
Speak to me, speak— 
Be my heart heaid, or it will break 
For one kind word; 
No vows to bind, no pledge I 
seek, 
Only be kind—speak to me, speak. 
One idle day thou did'st deplore 
some castaway on desert shore; 
'Twas but a 
tale by poet feigned,. 
"Yet thou did'st pals, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan, sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone by the bleak sea 
My 
life is drear, I, east away_; 
Give me the tear thou shed'st that day. 
Speak to me, &13..

DAN, by JOHN F. 
SIF-'RIDIN. 
My kindest good evening to all, 
" 
A 
stranger," no doubt you will say; 
In th-
at assertion your right, 
I've been here just one week to-day; 
I 
came here from Paris direct, 
I'm known in that great City well; 
Among the _
Elle and Bon-7on, • 
I'm known as the Elegant Swell ! 
CHORUS. 
Elegant! Elegant! 
That's what they say of me, 
As I 
parade down the gay thoroughfare ; 
Elegant! Elegant! everywhere greets my 
ear. 
In style, grace and excellence, " 
None can compare. 
After my toilet, this morn, 
A 
stroll I 
took through Central Parlr; 
In picturesque beauty, unique, 
I 
think 'tis a 
shade o'er the mark; 
Your ladies, in beauty and style, , 
In some respects Paris exeel; 
And I 
flatter myself 
judge-:-± 
Who'd dispute the Elegant Swelly

GOOSE AND INGUNS. 
As sung by SOL SMITH Russets,. 
Oh, dear! I'm nearly starving, 
I 
want something nice to eat, 
I 
fancy myself carving; 
Big pies and joints of meat. 
Roast pork or leg of mutton, 
To me would be of use; 
And though I'm not a 
glutton, 
Still, I'd polish off a 
goose! 
CHORUS. 
For it is my opinion, 
That stuffed with sage and ingrin, 
No bird that flies is half so nice, 
As a 
goose, with sage and ingtui 
I'm very fond of Turkey, 
Spring Chicken is good to take; 
Of Partridge or of Pheasant, 
A 
dinnPr I 
could make. 
I 
like corned beef and mustard, 
Or sirloin steak with juice, 
Or Prairie hen or Bustard fat, 
But most I 
love a 
Goose! 
For it is my opinion, &O. 
I've liver tried, and bacon, 
And tripe both boiled and fried; 
A 
sheep's-head I 
have taken, 
And put myself outside. 
Though turtle soup is filling,

WAIT TILL THE MOONLIGHT FALLS. 
CEASE your repining, bright eyes are shining, 
Fonc 7
_1:-.rts are melting with fervent love; 
Red cheeks, are paling, sweethearts bewailing, 
Tarry not one moment from the girl you love. 
She's sure to cheer you when she comes near you, 
She's ever waiting for the fond sweet kiss; 
If you're inclined for a 
midnight ramble, 
Tell me what you think of a 
scene like this. 
Wait till the moonlight falls on the water, 
Then take your sweetheart out for a 
walk, 
Mind what you say, boys, that's how to court her, 
Tell her that you'll wed when the days grow short 
See when the moonlight falls on the streamlet, 
Silvering each ripple with'its brilliant rays; 
Out in the midnight, making the heart bright, 
Waking up the little birds before the break of day. 
Tickling and teazing, kissing and squeezing, 
Telling lots of little fibs, and swearing they are true, 
Some say it's naughty, others very pleasing, 
Just wait one moment and I'll tell you what to do. 
Wait till the moonlight, &c, 
A 
PADDY'S DREAM, 
As sung with great success by GARNELLA. BROTHERS. 
JOHN BULL he was an Englishman, 
Who went on tramp one day, 
With threepence in his pocket 
For to carry him a 
long.way ; 
He traveled along for many a 
mile, 
Yet no one did he see, 
Until he met an Irishman 
By the name of Pat Magee. 
Good morning, Pat, says Johnny Bull, 
Where are you going to? 
Oh, faith, I 
do not know, says Pat, 
Pm looking for a 
job to do. 
Can you lend me a 
shilling, Paddy? 
Says Johniv Bull to Pat. 
Sure it's the only thing I'm wanting, 
For I 
havn't got nary a 
rap. 
They had not travelled very far, 
When a 
Scotchman, like them, out of work, 
And by his look and appearance, 
As hunr.,-
,ry as a 
Turk. 
Can 3 
ou lend me a 
shilling, Scotty? 
Says bold Paddy Magee. 
I 
cluma do that., says the Scotchman, 
For I 
han'na got nary a 
bubee. 
Ch, I 
have got a 
three-pence, 
What shall we do with that? 
Buy three-pence worth of whiskey, 
'Twill cheer us up, says Pat, 
Oh (Mina do that, says Scotty, 
I'll tell you what we'll do, 
Buy three- pence worth of oat meal. 
make some nice bergue, 
Oh no, well buy a 
loaf of bread, 
The Englishman did say, 
And in yonder hay-stack 
Well sleep our hunger away. 
We 11 get a 
drink of water 
From yonder purling. stream, 
And the loaf shall be his in the ,morning, 
Who dreams the greatest diem. 
Now, the Englishman, by the morning, 
Ten million men had Leen 
For years a 
digging a 
turnip, out, 
The largest ever seen. 
At last they got the turnip out, 
By working night and day, 
It took four million horses 
This turnip to 'an! away. 
Now the Scotchman, by the morning 
Forty million men had been 
For years a 
making a 
boLer, 
The laq,Yest ever seen. 
What was it for? says J4J1in Bull, 
Was it make of copper or tin ? 
'Twas made of copper, says Scotty, 
To boil your turnip in. 
SPOEEN.—Now comes Pat's dream. 
Oh, sure, I've been dreaming, 
And drained a 
pleasant dream. 
I 
dramed I 
was in a 
hay-stack, 
All by a 
purling stream. 
And you and Scotty were there too, 
You were, upon my oath, 
By the powers, I 
dreamed I 
was hungry, 
So I 
got up and ate the loaf. 
SUNG BY JOHN FIELDING. 
I'm not satisfied at all 
With what I 
am, but could 
I 
only be what I 
am not, 
Depend on it I 
would; 
For madly I'm in love, 
As deep as deep can be; 
But sure enough I 
find to my cost, 
The girl don't care for me. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
bee, 
From her lips to gather honey, 
Or like the great Baron Rothschild, 
With hetps of ready money. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
train, 
Or her Bath chair I 
would be, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
Hansome cab, 
That she could ride in me. 
I 
wish she was the Octopus, 
And she might go to bathe, 
If she should drown I'd stick to her. 
My loved one's life to save. 
By her hair, or the soles of her fee, 
I'd,drag my prize in shore; 
I'd live, and love, and die in peace, 
And never go to sea any more. 
I 
wish that she was Tichborne, 
And I 
was the rightful heir, 
I 
wouldn't go to law to know who's who, 
My money she should share; 
I'd wed her with three weading rings, • 
To make her safe and sure; 
And dress her in the finest things. 
That a 
fellow could procure. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
little belt, 
That clasps her tiny waist, 
Or else the jewel in her hair— 
Which, by-the-by, is paste. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
little puppy dog, 
Put in a 
show for sale, 
And if she woLld only purchase me, 
Forever I'd wag my tail. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
tom cat, 
And she was a 
tiny mouse, 
And we should be the occupants, 
Of a 
four-roomed empty house; 
If she should run from her bole, 
And try to escape from me, 
If she'd refuse to be my wife. 
Then gobbled up she'd be. 
I 
wish I 
was the Shah. 
With his twenty thousand wives, 
Oh wouldn't I 
then go Hamm searum. 
And frighten them out of their lives 
Or I 
wish I 
was England's Prince, 
To marry the Russian Maria, 
I'd sail about the sea in ships, 
And set the Thames on fire.

In a

,If I

I 
asked her if she -would be mine, as we stood by the door, 
She said she had no objections,rbut her parents they were poor.

The buffalo he made a

And swallow'd the alligator.

As we go thro' the whirl of life, 
However much we grumble, 
We must be always on the move, 
And often in a 
certain groove 
Of low estate—but small or great— 
We often get a 
tumble. 
And many things we have to do 
Which go against the grain. 
Crtontrs. 
We take the cap and wear it, 
And thou:4i very slow to declare it, 
We have to " grin and bear it," 
But it goes against the grain. 
A 
young man courts a 
pretty girl, 
And fancies she adores him; 
rut when he thinks the game is won, 
With some one else away she'll run; 
Of course, he'll swear he doesn't care, 
Although it nearly floors him, 
And all the while he seems to smile— 
It goes.,against the grain. 
He'll fit the cap, &c. 
Old maids, who don't deny their age, 
Is something over thirty, 
May say they hate the sight of men, 
But still we find them now and then, 
At half a 
chance, return a 
glance, 
And some get gay and flirty; 
Which shows if they still single stay, 
It goes against the grain. 
They fit the cap, &c. 
The vile garroters, when they're caught, 
And that is none too often,' 
Are now rewarded with the cat; 
They very much object to that, 
And if some say it's not the way, 
Their brutal hearts to soften, 
It makes them yell, so we can tell, 
It goes against the grain. 
Put they fit the cap, &c. 
Since r:elson's day upon the sea, 
We've changed our style of fightinz.; 
Still the brave Lino j:.cket Lids, 
CooT)ed inicie the iron clads, 
Are just as game and true of aim, 
When 7rongs require a

As every foe must know, although

SUNG BY Joax FTPLDING. 
Let every one cherish the land of their birth, 
No matter what creed on face of the earth. 
With conviviality, friendship and mirth, 
And charms their own little sire land. 
For it's all Botheration to spake of a

Or run down its station from bottom to top; . 
The same sky is over its wheat and its clover, 
The time it moves o'er its strength to each crop.

Hurrah for the hills and murmuring rills 
Where the shamrock illumines the mire land, 
Hurrah for a

Near the grassy- clad hills of ould Ireland. 
In praise I 
will sing of that swate little place, 
Its name from ray bosom will ne'er be erased, 
Until the cold turf o'er my body is placed, 
'Neath the soil of my dear native Ireland. 
Where there's rale hospitality, friends in reality, 
An abundance of charity always in store, 
Plenty to trate yez with, milk and potatoes, 
And plenty to greet yez with, whiskey galore. 
Hurrah for the hills, tx. 
Those fond recollections of Erin asthore, 
Will ne'er be effaced from 14y mind I 
am sure, 
For my heart dwells in transport on that little shore, 
Near the gr4ssy-clad hills of ould Ireland ; 
For near those hills a 
place is where a 
sv-ate little face is, 
Whose presence it graces a 
cane little cot, 
A 
sweet little crature an angel of nature, 
Her features if once seen would ne'er be forgot, 
Hurrah for the hills, &c. 
MY LOVE SHE IS A 
FAIRY QUEEN4lf 
Sung by Miss ALIC-
Li Jour.DAN. 
My love she is a 
fairy queen— 
About her face no paint is seen; 
Her pretty foot is very small, 
But very large is her waterfall ; 
Her ankle, too, so plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pit-a-pat; 
Were,' a 
bee upon her lip, 
I'd stay all day and sip, and sip. 
Cnorcs. 
Oh, she never flirts—she's no coquette ; 
She never scolds, nor does she fret ; 
She's some on style, and full of fun ; 
You bet your life," she's number one. 
I 
took her to a 
show one night, 
I 
almost knew 'twould please her quite 
And as we sat in the parquette, 
How nice I 
felt I 
scarce can say; 
The bell it rang, the curtain rose ; 
A 
man came out in spangled clothes, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
While to my love he gave a 
smile. 
Oh, she never flirts, etc. 
To see my love, next day I 
went— 
To pop the question was my intent; 
Alas ! poor me, I 
felt quite sore 
To hear she'd gone in a 
coach and four ; 
Her mother squealed and I 
did squall; 
She'd took her trunk and waterfall; 
I 
seized my hat—to the show I 
ran, 
But she'd eloped with a 
circus man. 
Oh, she never flirts, &c.

For my object is for to sing and to please you. 
It's a

So with no more preface, 
I

For, I

A 
pretty girl does meet. • 
And introduces himself by sweet taning ;

For he talks as smooth x.s ice 
To her, as alon; the street they're walking; 
And not, long atter that. 
She's got on a,no,,

And way up-town we find that he has met her; 
And when it does get dark.

I

As you are all aware, 
I 
love to dress and cut a 
swell, 
With me none can compare; 
I'm always cheerful, light and gay, 
My heart is never sad, 
I 
strive to cast dull care airy, 
To keep my spirits glad.

Oh! yes, I 
am a 
gay -young belle, 
And well I 
love to cut a 
swell, 
Among the boys and girls as well, 
I 
in call'd a 
female swell. 
As I 
walk down the crowded street, 
I 
toss my flowing curls, 
And smile on ev'ry gent I 
meet, 
I'm envied by the girls; 
The little dears, they are so shy, 
Their thot's they dare not tell, 
They are afraid to wink so sly, 
Like me, the female swell. 
Oh! yes, I 
am, Om 
The other day I 
caught a 
bean, 
He offer'd me his arm, 
He talk'd so sweet we walk'd so slow, 
He worship'd ev'ry charm; 
He spoke his heartfelt love to me, 
In words I 
cannot tell. 
"Pray stop," said I. " for don't you 
That I'm a 
female swell."

L. iltsi-En, the greatest Clown of the Northwest. 
The Hero of my humble song 
Was once it mighty man. 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan : 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
CHORL-5.. 
He was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrcit's ; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too ! 
Sure many a 
time tor nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue ; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And nor he's gone away ! 
He was great, 4 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be MaSror';-
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
But ere he came to rule the' town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, &t
, 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair ; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say ; 
0, it .grieves us just to thinl: ot. 
Mulcahy's gone away ! 
Ha '. as great, cta.. 
He treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet ; 
The sight of him would do yo,,

collar stiff and hiQn, 
Which made a 
r.7rear. displ.ty 
He was a 
most cLstinguished mai— 
But now he's gone away : 
He was great, 4:c. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man;

They weep and wail, and say-

Once again before you go. 
Iiam coming, for to-morrow, 
You'll be wandering afar, 
And the thought brings pain and sorrow, 
Since I've learned how dear you are ; 
Smiles of thine no more may cheer me, 
But in mem'ry sweet and low, 
Tho'ts of thee will linger near me, 
As you wander to and fro.

All the days shall smile with gladniss, 
When our hearts united be.

What? no ! it cannot be that they've driven 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may their crime be forgiven,) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh Heavens, he is sadden'd and weary,

Oh, this world it is lonely and dreary, 
And his heart for relief vainly seeks.

When he borrows your coat you're the loser,

He's got one eye in his head like a 
mackerel, 
His neck is as long as a 
crane; 
He drinks gruel that's made out of sawdust, 
Mixed up with a 
seven day's rain, 
His clothes wouldn't cover a

Shoot him with a

You can bet that he never would tumble,

In such a

The flowers were bright, but oh, his eyes 
They shone like stars of night! 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight.

My heart with rapture beat; 
And while his eyes did on me beam,

How quick the time had sped ! 
But when our lips met at the gate.

No one who has read the touching account ot the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest, which is inseparable from Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Temple. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it etemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the Wm 
of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and ruin resulting from once yieal-
ing to the seductive innuence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in ra-
pi attention to the end.

THE APPRENTICE,

OR 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to thin excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : The editor cf this journal, 
while teaching natural philogophy and chemistfy in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
tho units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, ete.—Itanufac!ttrer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
)'he author of this work is well known as an extensive 
w7.iter who has raade some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated ariova in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a 
mantle 
which is not available to young men commencingas appren 
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair linev.va..g,e of 
arithmetic may, however, use this walk to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a 
weik 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
readily to any portion of the boek, 
lhe author has adopted 
a 
new notation to di ,Linguish traits oi work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be athantageousJy 
introduced intr r,nre amhitians works. 
The book is well 
printed on good -v
.-Alit(
