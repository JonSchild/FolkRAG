Natalie Diaz:  I’m Natalie Diaz and I’m reading “Postcolonial Love Poem.” 
 
[Natalie Diaz reads “Postcolonial Love Poem”] 
 
ND:  “Postcolonial Love Poem” is a poem that I imagine taking place in my desert—where I was 
raised, where I learned to speak and to imagine.  
 
A question that I am asking a lot lately, including in this poem, is what does it mean to have 
been born and raised and lived on a reservation, knowing what reservations were intended to 
do? The conditions they were meant to create and eventually terminate? Yes, I know what my 
country has done to me and my people. I know what it continues to do.  
 
And there is also a way that I am determined to continue to exist as my creator imagined me to 
be when they made me. I am allowing the desert to become a place of desire because I know 
the ways that we think about the desert, and I know the ways that my country has thought 
about indigenous peoples.  
 
I very intentionally paired the desert with the idea of desire. People think of the desert as being 
a place void of life or a very stark place—a very violent place. And it can be those things. The 
desert is also a place of abundance. It’s also a place that is very intentional with its energy and 
its life. The animals here know how to conserve energy; they know how to rest. The trees know 
how to store water; they know when to fruit.  
 
There are a lot of origins or openings or first moments—beginnings—in the poem, which feel 
very important, very cyclical: to be able to rest or to break and yet to still “green.” To still 
bloom. To still return to life. To always have that possibility waiting.
