TXO1: Joe Czarnecki and I drove to G—Waretown; 53GT to talk with 
Joe Reid, a longtime garvey 
builder. 
We arrived at about 3:oo 
p.m. 
Joe was 
in his workshop, a structure made of Jersey cedar 
which he built himself after World War II. 
This workshop has the 
characteristic silver gray color of weathered cedar. 
Outside, 
there was a pile of cedar planks which had been placed there to 
"season", or get the green out. 
Actually, the word "piled" 
is 
particularly inappropriate. 
Cedar is aged by placing it in such 
a manner as to permit the free passage of air around each board. 
This generally takes, I've been told, about 6 months for every 6" 
of thickness. 
After introductions, I asked Joe Reid about the thickness of 
the cedar he uses in the garvey, which, he replied, 
is one inch. 
It takes, therefore, about a year for the wood to "season out" 
properly. 
I asked Joe 
if 
all 
the wood in the boat is cedar, and 
he said that it was, except for the "stringers" (these are, I 
believe, supports along the side of the hull), which are usually 
fir. 
Joe said that the garvey 
is usually used for clamming on the 
bay. 
He said that he himself had been a clammer since 1936 or 
1937, but had retired from that business seven or eight years ago 
and had devoted himself full—time to garvey building since then. 
Joe said that he builds the garvey "by eye", that is, 
he doesn't 
work from a specific or standardized pattern or model. 
Each 
boat, therefore, 
is different to some degree from every other 
boat. 
In building, Joe works from a center line, actually a 4" X 
4", which is half buried in the sandy floor of the workshop. 
He 
squares the bow and the stern off of this center board, then 
builds according to the customer's wishes. 
These customer 
"inputs" usually take the form of specifications as to the length 
of the boat, which can vary from about twelve to about thirty 
feet, although most of the boats that Joe is asked to build are 
between fifteen and twenty five feet in 
length. 
I did not question Joe about the details of the process of 
boat building. 
This line of questioning may be the subject of 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 1 
some sort of follow—up fieldwork at a later date. 
However, Joe 
did indicate that the garvey has not changed much structurally 
over the years, but that there have been "radical changes" 
in the 
design features of the boat. 
In general terms, these changes are 
as follows: 
1) The garvey is wider than it once was. 
Joe says 
that the rule of thumb in building is that the width 
is one third 
the length. 
The boat currently under construction is about 
twenty five feet long and just under nine feet in width. 
Joe 
pointed out that this ratio is not in strict conformance with the 
rule, but that customer influence can account for deviations from 
that rule. 
In this case, the customer wanted a slightly wider 
boat. 
The garvey used to be narrower, according to Joe. 
It was 
widened in order to increase its 
load capacity. 
2) 
The garvey 
is now flared (from bottom to top). 
Joe described this as an 
aesthetic change. 
Actually, this may be correct. 
In order to 
clam using the tongs, which have long handles, the clammer must 
lean over the side of the boat in order to scoop up the clams. 
The flare, which Joe, at least, now builds into all of his 
garveys, increases the distance that the clammer has to 
lean 
in 
order to work, and this places a strain on his back. 
This raises 
many issues which cannot be gone into here but which can be 
mentioned. 
First, Joe says that he makes about two—thirds of his 
boats for people who will use them as pleasure craft. 
The 
relationship between Joe's conception of use and his conception 
of form may be interesting to explore. 
Second, and this issue 
is, I think, related to the first, this work/pleasure 
relationship raises economic issues which could be 
looked into. 
And third, the role of the individual craftsman and the 
development of his "vision" may be a factor here. 
Is Joe's 
aesthetic sense gradually intruding into his workshop? 
I would 
not advance this idea at all 
had not Joe continually mentioned it 
himself, 
in terms of making the garvey look "prettier", etc. 
I 
might add here that Joe has begun to build models of his garveys, 
models which are in every way replicas of the original, except, 
of course, that they are a fraction of the original size. 
These 
and other issues that surround the problem of design change may 
be an interesting topic of further study. 
2) 
The garvey, as 
built by Joe Reid, 
is now tapered toward the bow. 
It should be 
noted that the bow is still squared, but that the ratio of bow 
width to stern width has decreased in recent years. 
3) 
The bow 
has been raised, so that it rides high, or rather higher, 
in the 
water than it once did. 
I have no further information on this 
change. 
It 
is 
interesting to reflect on the nature of these changes. 
When I arrived, Joe described the garvey as a big box, a floating 
platform off of which various bay related work activities can be 
performed. 
With these changes, however, the garvey is singularly 
lacking 
in right angles, 
is more streamlined, perhaps more 
"aesthetic" in design, and yet is still 
largely utilitarian. 
Even those customers who purchase a garvey for pleasure purposes 
do so because the garvey is a flat—bottomed boat, and can 
therefore get into places 
in the bay that are very shallow, as 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 2 
shallow as one foot, and still not run aground. 
The garvey, 
then, whether used for pleasure or profit, 
is particularly suited 
to the requirements of Barnegat Bay, which is dotted with areas 
of very shallow water. 
In fact, the major distinction which Joe 
and others I spoke with make between the garvey and "other" boats 
is 
in this flat bottom. 
Other boats are characterized, and 
classified, as "V—bottomed". 
Joe says that the garvey will usually last for about twenty 
years. 
He paints the bottom of the boat with a copper paint, "to 
keep the barnacles off", then paints a water line (this 
is 
exceptionally low on the garvey) and the sides with a high gloss 
paint. 
Joe says that he prefers a semi—gloss, but that it 
is not 
available any more. 
The high gloss, he says, "thicks off", that 
is, 
chips, when it 
is hit. 
In order to get around this problem, 
Joe thins the high gloss with turpentine, and paints several thin 
coats on 
instead of one thick one. 
This reduces the potential 
for the paint to chip. 
Joe uses galvanized nails, which, he 
says, cost about seventy cents per pound. 
I asked him if he ever 
used copper nails, and he replied that he can use bronze nails, 
but they are too expensive (they cost about six dollars per 
pound) and would add about four hundred dollars to the cost of 
the boat. 
Although I didn't ask what his preference was, he 
seemed to feel that the galvanized nails did the job quite well. 
It 
is, however, those fittings which are held together by nails 
that loosen with use and time, that determine the working life of 
the boat. 
Joe gets his lumber from Steve Frazee of Forked River. 
He 
buys the cedar in bulk and planes it himself. 
He also buys it 
with the bark on, which he strips off immediately. 
Joe says that 
the cedar bug gets in under the bark and eats from the sapwood 
(the outer wood) to the heartwood (the inner wood). 
Peeling off 
the bark seems to destroy the eggs. 
"They don't like air," 
Joe 
says. 
I asked if Joe uses only the butt wood,, that is, the wood 
on the trunk that rises to the first branches only. 
The wood 
becomes knotted at the branch level. 
Joe said that he needs the 
long wood, that is, almost the entire length of the trunk. 
For 
his purposes, the knots don't matter (for the decoy carver, they 
make quite a difference). 
If Joe were to use shorter pieces, the 
boat would be structurally weaker. 
So then, a twenty five foot 
boat would need a twenty five foot length of wood. 
This poses 
something of a problem, because the cedar farmer can make more 
money by cutting a tree up for butt wood. 
Moreover, 
in order to 
attain the length needed to use in boatbuilding (garvey building, 
that is) the cedar tree must remain on the farm, or rather in the 
swamp, uncut, for longer periods of time. 
The tree farmer must, 
in turn, then, make a commitment to this use, and delay the 
gratification of profit from this particular class of tree. 
Joe 
Reid claims that cedar for boats is harder and harder to acquire. 
This is 
an 
issue which should be explored with the tree farmer, 
that is, there may be a case study here by means of which these 
interrelationships can be adequately explored. 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 3 
A word here about the deck of the garvey, through which we 
can enter the world of clamming. 
This deck runs along the length 
of the garvey. 
It 
is laminated, that is, 
it consists of about 
eight one inch boards which are fastened together (in what 
manner, I don't know) to form the flat deck on either side of the 
boat. 
By deck, 
I, 
or rather Joe, means the flattened areas that 
top the sides of the boat. 
This is not the deck that is walked 
on. 
In the garvey, the occupants walk or stand on the floor. 
This deck 
is bordered by a toe rail on the outside, and a rub 
rail 
on the inside. 
These rails are about an 
inch or two high, 
and they help form an area along the length of the deck which is 
enclosed. 
This is the area where the clammer would lay the clams 
that he brings up from the bay. 
It 
is 
interesting to note here 
that the "toe rail"--Joe Reid's word) suggests a utilitarian 
function. 
This 
is the outermost rail 
of the deck, the rail that 
would, hypothetically, guide the toe of the boatman away from the 
outer edge of the deck. 
In the Barnegat Bay area, this deck 
is 
not used for walking, but the descriptive name is retained, or 
perhaps, was adopted. 
A small point, but perhaps worth 
mentioning. 
It 
is 
interesting to note that the term "clamming" 
is almost 
never used, at least in my experience, 
in casual conversation. 
Rather, specific designations are used, depending on the method 
of clamming that is employed. 
So, then, one 
is either "tongin" 
(clamming with long handled devices that have two rakelike 
objects, one on each tong, which are operated like scissors to 
gather the clams); "rakin" (scooping up clams with a single,, 
rakelike device similar to a tong), or "dredgin", that is, 
drifting in a boat and gathering clams by a method on which I 
have no information. 
(N.B. 
The term rub rail as used above is 
incorrect; the correct term is "coaming") 
Joe Reid clammed for about forty years, that is, from 1936 
to 1976. 
We talked about this as we drove from his workshop, 
which 
is on the same property as his house, to a marina where 
some of his garveys were docked. 
I asked him about how the clams 
were, that is, how plentiful they were, when he started. 
I asked 
him this because he had mentioned that the clamming wasn't too 
good these days--a good clammer is 
lucky 
if 
he can pull a 
thousand clams in per day. 
Joe said that when he started, the clamming wasn't very 
good. 
In the thirties„ he sometimes only took four or five 
hundred clams per day. 
Then, 
in the forties, fifties, and 
sixties, the situation improved, and the daily take increased 
considerably. 
In the seventies, however, the situation declined 
again. 
Today, Joe estimates, there are probably less than a 
dozen clammers (full time clammers, that is) on the bay. 
In the 
forties through sixties, Joe estimates that there were more than 
fifty. 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 4 
Most garvies have a small, squarish cabin. 
Joe says that 
this 
is there for the comfort of the clammer. 
Generally, a 
clammer will clam from about April to about the first of 
December. 
As the season lengthens, the days become shorter and 
colder. 
The cabins, then, are a refuge for a cold, tired, and 
sometimes wet clammer during the ride home after a long day on 
the bay. 
I noted that these cabins were small and couldn't 
accommodate more than one person, and Joe replied that most boats 
have only one clammer, sometimes two. 
The size of the cabin, 
then, may have been suited to the nature of the activity, that 
is, a one—man operation. 
When using the 'tongin" method of clamming, the boat lies at 
anchor and the clammer clams both sides of the boat, then 
releases the anchor and allows the boat to drop back a little, 
where the process is repeated. 
Joe provided this information 
after I had asked about an anchor that I saw on one of the 
garvies that he had built and which was docked at the marina. 
This 
in turn prompted the discussion about the poverty of clams 
these days. 
For, 
in talking about the anchor, Joe described the 
clamming process in which the anchor played a part. 
He then said 
that he used to get "seventy five to a hundred [clams] a grab 
then"; now clammers only get twenty five to thirty. 
Joe says that he builds about three to four boats a year 
now, and "always has orders ahead", so there is no danger of 
running out of work. 
He thinks that he has built about a hundred 
in his lifetime, of which he can remember the customer name and 
the length of about eighty five of those. 
Joe also makes the 
tongs for clamming, which are made of mahogany and vary from 
about eight to about eighteen feet in 
length. 
Joe used to use a 
planer to shape these tongs, but has angina now, so that the hand 
work 
is difficult. 
He uses a router for this work now. 
I might 
add here that Joe uses various power tools in his shop, 
including 
a band saw, table saw, planer, and other smaller power tools. 
He 
claims that these power tools have greatly reduced the amount of 
time that he must spend on each boat. 
Our conversation continually turned to wood, specifically 
cedar, about which Joe knows a great deal. 
As with other 
artificers in the area who work with cedar, Joe thinks that 
Jersey cedar is the best wood for his purposes. 
I asked about 
Maryland cedar and Canadian cedar, and Joe had a ready answer. 
Maryland cedar, he said, 
is a short—grained wood, so 
it cannot be 
bent or twisted lest it break. 
Maryland cedar "is a juniper, 
actually", Joe says. 
Canadian cedar is "soft and takes water" 
and therefore gets too heavy when involved in maritime uses. 
Joe 
did like the swamp white oak that used to grow in the area, but 
he says that this 
is no 
longer available, due to burning, I 
think. 
Joe says that he used to use white oak for sprung or 
steamed timbers in his boats (or rather, that such wood could be 
used--I'm not sure, on reflection, that he said he actually used 
it. 
Rather, he 
indicated that it 
is useful 
in round—bottom 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 5 
boats. 
The garvey is flat bottomed.) 
However, Joe does like oak 
for "timbers or keels", but oak "rots quicker. 
If 
its 
confined,, 
it'll rot, you know." 
Joe has lived 
in the Waretown area all 
of his life. 
He will 
be seventy four years old on November 10th of this year. 
He no 
longer has his own boat; 
illness and age have forced him from the 
water. 
As we were driving along the bay, he said, "When I come 
here and think 
I don't have my own boat anymore..."." and his 
face looked pained and sad. 
He couldn't finish the sentence. 
Joe still 
loves the bay very much. 
He said that he could have 
made more money doing something other than clamming, "but I love 
the water. 
When I got married I told my wife, 'I'm just a 
shiftless bayman...If I don't come home, don't ever send anybody 
out to look for me. 
If I'm alive, I know exactly what I'm doin. 
If I'm dead, another day won't matter.'" 
Joe also said "That used to be the life of the town, the 
bay, you know." 
He said that many of the residents now just 
don't care about the bay, they're outsiders who come from the 
city and live 
in the bay area, but earn their livings elsewhere 
Either that, or they're summer people. 
I asked him what the 
difference was between these new people and the long time 
residents. 
After all, I suggested, the new residents could have 
chosen another place to 
live or vacation, and that they probably 
came here because they, too, 
in their way, 
loved the water. 
Joe 
responded without hesitation: 
"People now, they like 
it [i.e. 
the bay] but their spoilin it. 
To us, 
it's like your garden. 
If 
you make your livin off 
it, 
you take care of it." 
So, then, the 
new people are strangers in two ways--they are strangers to the 
place, and they are strangers to the values and lifeways of that 
place. 
Joe remarked that there is a lot of theft on the bay now, 
mostly perpetrated by newcomers or "strangers." 
Joe Reid again: 
"Got so many strangers comin now. 
In the old days, every town 
had a thief or two, but you knew who they were! 
You had somethin 
missing, you knew where to find it."

TXO1: On 10/08, morning of, I went to G—Manahawkin; 56GT to see 
Hurley Conklin, a decoy carver from the Barnegat Bay area. 
Hurley has been described by Ray Birdwhistell 
(I do not have this 
information directly from Birdwhistell, but from a secondary 
source, as 
it were) as the best of the carvers of the old school. 
By "old school", I mean that group of carvers who carved gunning 
decoys from about 1880 to the period when factory made decoys 
made of materials other than wood came into more general use. 
It 
is difficult to distinguish this phenomenon from the rise of the 
decoy to a position of prominence among collectors of objects 
d'art, and from the related phenomenon of collectors who 
specialize in decoys to the exclusion of other objects. 
These 
latter are often former, 
if not current or continuing, duck 
hunters. 
The decline of the carved wooden decoy as a gunning 
stool, then, 
is not a story, then, of encroaching obsolescence, 
but rather one of a transition to new status and ramification 
into new communities. 
As far as I know, and my 
information here 
is scanty, and therefore my guess must be taken as 
largely 
conjectural, this transition became institutionalized at about 
the time of the second world war. 
I am aided 
in this attempt to 
establish a time frame by the appearance in the 1950s of Bill 
Mackey's book on the gunning decoy, by which time the trend 
toward collection had been highly articulated, by which I mean 
that a true community of collectors could be identified. Hurley 
Conklin was born in Cedar Run, New Jersey in 1913 (This 
information was given me by Hurley himself). 
Cedar Run 
is 
located on Route 9 just a mile or two south of Manahawkin, where 
Hurley lives now. 
Hurley served in the armed forces 
during 
World War II, was discharged in 1944, and returned immediately to 
the area where he had been born, but settled this time 
in 
Manahawkin, just north of his birthplace, because, as he says, 
it 
was "quieter" there, 
less densely populated than Cedar Run, 
less 
"developed." 
Hurley says that he carved his first decoy in 1928, when he 
was fifteen years old. 
I asked him why he carved it, 
and who he 
carved it for, and he answered that he carved it for himself, to 
use on a gunning rig while duck hunting. 
I then asked him who he 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 7 
modeled his decoys after, and he answered that he knows what a 
duck looks like and doesn't have to model, or copy, after anyone 
or anything. 
Hurley estimates that since that time, that is, the 
time he carved his first gunning stool, he's carved about 20,000 
decoys. 
I want to question him further about this figure, 
because although it doesn't seem impossible, 
it 
is high. 
Most 
carvers that I have spoken with, especially those of the old 
school, had to work for a living at other occupations; that is, 
there were no full time carvers in the earlier period of carving. 
The full time carver is a recent phenomenon, and has arisen 
in 
conjunction with the vogue for carved maritime artifacts. 
We talked in porch,enclosed with screens on two sides, that 
is attached to Hurley's house. 
Hurley had some tools hanging in 
one corner, one of which he described as an old "spoke shave" 
which he used to shape the wood in the earlier phases of decoy 
carving. 
I asked him what kind of wood he used, and he 
responded, "Jersey Cedar", and to another query, he specified 
that it 
is of the "white" variety. 
Hurley also showed me a 
knife that he had made and that had once been used to carve 
mainly the heads of the gunning stools; this was a small knife, 
its blade was about one and one half inches long and perhaps one 
half of an 
inch wide at the base, tapering to a point that was 
perhaps one quarter or one third of an 
inch wide. 
He indicated 
that he no 
longer uses this knife because it had dulled and 
wasn't worth sharpening. 
I asked him where he got the knife, and 
he said that he had made it himself. 
The handle, by the way, was 
of wood, although I did not ask of what type. 
We were talking at 
the time about carving decoys, and 
it was in that context that he 
said that the knife was no longer useful. 
Later however, while 
showing me how he carves the eye grooves on the head of the stool 
("stool" by the way seems to be the "emic" name for decoy) he got 
some grime on the knife (this was a new knife, one 
in current 
use, I believe, but of the same type and description as that 
noted above) and he picked up the old, "defunct" knife and 
cleaned the blade of the new one with it. 
He then made a comment 
to the effect that this is what the old knife is still good for. 
It 
is 
interesting in this context to note that he still had the 
old knife, and that it was not on "display"; 
that is, 
it was in 
a small round bucket—like container on the 
table around which we 
were sitting. 
So then, 
it might be inferred that the old knife 
was "still around", still "handy", and that it served a purpose. 
Furthermore, his utilization of the old knife 
in that manner and 
with that explanation may provide a clue to the manner in which 
he organizes or structures his work around his tools. 
All 
of the 
above comments about the knife are preliminary 
and demand 
further investigation, and so I will 
leave this subject at this 
point, while stressing the fact that this is a line of inquiry 
that will be followed up at a later date. 
I bring up the problem of "display" because Hurley does seem 
to be conscious of the "culture" of the Barnegat area and of his 
place in 
it. 
I noticed what I thought was a display case 
in the 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 8 
room that we talked in, 
but I did not get a chance to have a 
closer look. 
When I arrived with my request for an interview, 
Hurley was reluctant, said that he had no time, but finally said 
that I could have "five minutes." 
I put this 
in quotation marks 
because that five minutes turned into an hour and a half. 
So, 
then, I dared not stray from the subject of decoys, which was my 
stated purpose in seeing him. 
However, I will get back to the 
question of display and attitudes of Hurley toward his place at a 
later date. 
Also on the table where we spoke were two "decoys", a red— 
breasted merganser and a curlew, a yellow curlew, I believe, 
which is a shore bird common in the Barnegat area. 
He had just 
carved the merganser, on order, for a state trooper from the area 
who likes decoys and who had asked Hurley to carve him one. 
I 
asked if I could pick it up and he said o.k. 
I remarked that it 
seemed heavy, which I later realized was a faux pas, because 
Hurley took it from me and said, "No, feel how light that is." 
Barnegat Bay decoys are hollow bodied decoys that are carved as a 
rule from white swamp cedar, which when seasoned, or permitted to 
dry out over time, 
is very light, although the degree of 
lightness varies from cut to cut of wood. 
Most carvers whom I 
have spoken with seem to pride themselves on the lightness of 
their decoys, but this 
is also related to their pride in and 
commitment to the particular wood that they use, that is, white 
cedar. 
My comment forced Hurley to defend his decoy, and for 
this I was almost immediately sorry. 
I got the decoy back and began to examine it. 
I hefted it 
to try the weight and get a sense of the stool's balance, then 
took a front view and a rear view in order to get a sense of the 
detail 
in a more general morphological sense. 
That is, I wanted 
to see if there was any fullness in the cheeks, determine the 
general contours of the breast and tail, and the overall width of 
the body. 
While looking at the rear view, I noticed that the 
stool was lopsided, with the right side rising higher than the 
left. 
I chalked this up to Hurley's age and to what I assumed 
was his failing eye, but I'm not so sure that this judgment is 
the correct one. 
At the time, I put this to myself in the form 
of a question, and a question it remains. 
I would like to 
examine more recent decoys of Hurley's before I advance any 
further hypotheses on that subject. 
In general, I thought that the decoy was nice, but not 
exceptional. 
The curlew, by the way, was quite beautiful, and I 
think that Hurley said that that decoy had also been carved 
recently. 
However, with bird 
in hand, 
it came naturally to me to 
ask 
if his work, or carving style, was influenced by the work of 
any other carver. 
This is a question in which I am particularly 
interested, for two reasons. 
First, because everyone with whom 
I've spoken about the subject says that these carvers 
"influenced" each other and I want to explore these relations of 
influence; and second, and perhaps more importantly, I want to 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 9 
determine, 
insofar as I am able, to what degree this perception 
and popular belief concerning influence is accurate and/or to 
what degree it represents an 
indulgence in a commonly accepted 
stereotype. 
Hurley indicated that he wasn't influenced by anyone; and 
in 
fact, I can conceive of a setting in which Hurley Conklin, having 
grown up 
in an area where ducks and shore birds abounded, had 
developed a strong mental 
image of what a duck actually looked 
like and that, when he decided to carve, actually drew upon this 
image 
in order to shape his first decoy. 
It seems to be the 
case, however, that decoys carved in the Barnegat Bay area fall 
into three or four morphological categories, and that Hurley's 
decoys seem to be related to the more southerly carving areas of 
the bay. 
In any case, I realized that I wouldn't get anywhere 
with this line of questioning, so I changed gears a bit and asked 
him what other carvers he admired, or rather, whose work he 
liked. 
He said that he didn't like any of the carvers who were 
carving now, that they weren't carving decoys. 
He was laconic on 
this subject in particular, and spoke 
in tautological terms; that 
is, 
he said such things as "A decoy is a decoy", or, 
"A decoy 
that isn't a decoy isn't a decoy." 
This problem isn't as difficult as 
it seems, however, 
if 
it 
is contextualized properly. 
A "decoy" 
is a gunning stool, used 
to 
lure ducks or other species of bird into the gunner's range— 
gunning range, that is—but Hurley's remark has particular 
significance, because there wouldn't be any distinction at all 
between a "decoy and a decoy" had not the collecting and 
decorative carving phenomena established a foothold in decoydom. 
I questioned Hurley on this, and my assumptions, as noted here, 
were confirmed. 
So then, according to Hurley, no one who 
is 
carving today is carving decoys; rather, they are carving 
decorative art for mantels. 
I wonder if he would include himself 
in this category, of decorative carvers, that is. 
My guess is 
that he would not, but he 
is a realist, and he wants to carve, 
and he wants to sell his work. 
One might ask next if meaning and 
behavior can be separated in this context. 
This can only be 
answered, or attempt to be answered, after much further work. 
Hurley said, however, that he had liked the work of certain 
carvers, and he named two, both of them active in the 19th 
century: 
Harry V. Shourdes (1861-1920) and Lloyd Parker (I do 
not have dates available for Parker). 
Shourdes hailed from 
Tuckerton and Parker from Parkertown; 
it 
is 
interesting to note 
here that these two towns are within a few miles from each other, 
and both are within seven or eight miles of Cedar Run and 
Manahawkin, where Hurley Conklin 
has lived all 
his life. 
I will 
not draw any conclusions about this here. 
Shourdes is widely 
cited by collectors as perhaps the greatest carver to have worked 
in the Barnegat Bay area; 
By the way, all 
the collectors with 
whom I have spoken think that the Barnegat Bay decoys are the 
best in the country, so 
it may be inferred that Shourdes' stature 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 10 
is truly great. 
However, Hurley is not a collector, he 
is a 
carver, a true insider in the culture. 
His statement about his 
liking for the work of Shourdes and Parker (Parker's work is also 
widely admired--both men are considered "masters") may be 
significant in a specific way, that is, 
it may, perhaps, be 
approached with the problem of 
influence in mind. 
While we were there (I was accompanied on this interview by 
Bonnie Blair, a Pinelands Folklife Project Associate), Hurley 
showed us a photograph album that a friend had compiled for him. 
It consisted of a number of photographs of decoys carved by 
Hurley over the years. 
As I viewed these photographs, I realized 
that Hurley is truly a great carver. 
Some of his decoys are 
among the most beautiful and distinctive that I've seen. 
One of 
the most breathtaking was a coot decoy. 
The coot is not a bird 
that frequents the Barnegat Bay area. 
In fact, I would guess 
that it's never been seen there. 
What is the significance of 
this decoy in Hurley's repertoire? 
All 
of the Barnegat Bay 
decoys that I've seen represent birds that actually visit the 
area. 
This is significant when viewed in terms of their function 
as working, or gunning, decoys. 
Why did Hurley carve this stool 
and what does it mean? 
Does it represent an artistic impulse? 
Is 
it an early or a late production in terms of his career? 
Was 
it carved for use 
in a rig or for decorative purposes? 
Would 
Hurley consider it a decoy? 
None of these questions can be 
answered or even discussed further at this point. 
It might be said that the photograph album indicates that 
Hurley is no 
longer unselfconscious about what he does. 
I think 
that it would be interesting to look into the significance of 
this album, but I would state at the outset that the dichotomy 
between conscious and unconscious, self—conscious and 
unselfconscious is simplistic and untenable, and will not serve 
well as a working hypothesis. 
For one thing, 
it denies Hurley 
status as a deeply motivated cultural actor, placing such depth 
in the realm of the "etic." 
This analysis itself may be overly 
simplistic, but the significance of the album must be approached 
from another angle, one which has not yet been determined. 
As we talked, Hurley pointed to another decoy, one of his 
that he was in the process of repairing, which lay on a table in 
a far corner of the room. 
I walked over to 
it and picked it up 
(once again, after first asking his permission). 
The head been 
damaged, probably from use on a rig. 
It was a canvasback decoy, 
the distinguishing feature of which was a longish tail. I pointed 
this out to him, and he did not argue with this as a 
characterization of his work, at least in terms of that species 
and at that stage of his career. 
I admired the decoy, 
specifically its strong but graceful 
lines. 
I returned to my 
chair and asked to see more of his decoys. He said no, rather 
flatly, and added, after a further question from me, that no one 
had a right to see them, and that he would deny permission to 
view them on this ground. 
I didn't press him on this issue, 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 11 
thinking that I would return as soon as possible and perhaps 
gradually, at least, see some of his work. 
I asked, by way of changing the subject, whether he liked 
the work of the Delaware River school of carvers. 
The work of 
these men 
is characterized by deeply carved tail feathers. 
In 
the Barnegat Bay area, the feathers are painted on, 
if they are 
represented at all. 
Hurley said that he didn't like that work. 
I asked why, and he said "Where did you ever see a duck with tail 
feathers in the middle of 
its back?" 
This is as concise a 
criticism as I can imagine. 
In fact, 
in my experience, these 
decoys are carved in this manner, while the ducks themselves 
cannot boast such an anatomy. 
I then asked if he thought that 
the Barnegat Bay decoys were the best (I asked this after Hurley 
said that he had orders for his decoys from all 
over the country 
and I wanted to know why he thought that was), and he said that 
he thought they were the best. 
Again, this exchange must be 
unpacked, for its significance is great. 
For example, no 
Barnegat Bay carver that I know ever carves directly from nature, 
but rather they carve from their own mental 
image of nature. 
Their images, then, are interactive in nature. 
More on this 
subject after more research. 
After a while of more talk, Hurley's state trooper showed up 
to pick up the merganser. 
Just before that, Hurley had said, 
"O.K., time's up." We were putting the finishing touches on our 
conversation, and I asked 
if I could come back. 
He said that 
he'd be at the Tuckerton Decoy Show on the following day and that 
I could see him there. 
I promised to do that, and after greeting 
Hurley's customer, we took our leave.

TX01: On Sunday, October 9, 
1983, I left headquarters in New 
Lisbon and drove south to G—Tuckerton; 47GT to attend a festival 
centered around the duck decoy. 
I arrived late--about 2:30 pm, 
and so missed some of the special events of the day, specifically 
a retrieving contest and a carving competition devoted solely to 
working decoys. 
The festival was held at Tip Seaman Park 
in 
Tuckerton, on Route 9. 
There was a variety of display tables set 
up, a brief description of which will form the essence of this 
report. 
First, there were several tables of an official or quasi— 
official nature. 
For example, the New Jersey Division of Fish, 
Game, and Wildlife 
had a display table there, with photographs 
and literature describing its activities. The Pinelands Cultural 
Society was also represented. 
The Society's table offered Piney 
Power buttons and bumper stickers, copies of Chicken Foot Soup, a 
Pinelands cookbook compiled by Arlene Ridgeway, and other items. 
Most, 
in fact the great majority of the tables were devoted 
to displays which fell 
into two major categories: 
The first 
might be described as contemporary, more popular items, all 
of 
which were for sale. 
These included carvings of wildfowl, mainly 
decorative carvings intended for display; painted or decorated 
items such as sand dollars; and an assortment of knick—knacks, 
trinkets, etc. 
The second category consisted of more 
traditional, working duck and shorebird decoys, dating back to 
the 19th century, and extending up to about 1945. 
Many of these 
items were for sale, but the people doing the selling were among 
the staunchest decoy collectors I know of, and so had with them 
items of decoydom intended solely for display and conversation 
purposes. 
Although these men were certainly interested in 
selling to the public, they spent a great deal of time away from 
their own tables and at those of other collectors, and also did 
some trading among themselves. 
I might add a third category to 
these two: 
there were items which, though obviously for sale, 
functioned at the festival mainly as display items. These were 
the larger, more expensive items, a category that consisted 
primarily of boats (read: sneakboxes). 
As I noted, these were 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 13 
for sale, but were expensive and so attracted mainly crowds of 
interested onlookers. 
I might also add here that there were personages of more 
than usual 
interest at the festival, and these people generated 
their own categories. 
Such a personage is Sam Hunt of Waretown, 
sneakbox builder, chairmaker, dancer, raconteur, etc. 
Sam was 
there, displaying boats, chairs, homemade instruments, and 
considerable humor and wit. 
Sam's chairs and banjos comprised a 
separate category at the festival--the category that breaks 
categories. In Sam's area, display was a factor in performance, 
not the central activity. 
The festival was well attended; at no time did I see a table 
without a group of interested onlookers gathered around it. 
I 
should note, however, that the decoy collectors often left their 
own tables to visit those of others, and 
these abandoned tables 
were often without browsers. 
I was not able to draw any 
conclusions, or even tentative hypotheses, regarding the kinds of 
things that actually sold at the festival. 
In this sense, an 
evaluation of the event is problematic. 
As far as I was able to 
determine, the festival was built around the decoy, both the 
decorative and the working kind, and offered a variety of related 
items. 
For example, Bob Rutter of West Creek is a builder of 
sneakbox models, complete with miniature decoys in the gunning 
racks. 
So then, one might conjecture that the festival was 
intended to display various artifacts associated with 
wildfowling. 
However, there were display tables set up that were 
strictly commercial; others were informative (e.g. the NJ 
Division of Fish, Game, and Wildlife noted above); still others 
bore a more broadly "cultural" message (e.g. the Pinelands 
Cultural Society). 
The point which I am trying, rather ineptly, I admit, to 
make, 
is that the festival had an 
internal organization which may 
be described as 
intent, but which ramified into a diversity of 
activities which may be described, for now, as subtexts (i.e. 
commerce, display, performance, culture, social activity, barter, 
etc.) 
Intention, that is, the organizational principle on which 
the festival organizers acted, may at first seem easy to 
identify, but this intent seems easily subverted by the activity 
at the festival. 
These are notes, perhaps, toward a method for 
observing future festivals, not a description of the festival 
under discussion. 
Here 
is another try at making sense of this festival. 
First 
of all, I must say that the above notes are indeed, 
in their way, 
a description of the festival. 
And, 
in checking my notes again 
and my memory, I would say that there 
is 
little to add. 
The 
festival consisted of a series of tables set out out of doors at 
Tip Seaman Park in Tuckerton. 
There were tables devoted to the 
dissemination of information, such as that set up by the NJ 
Division of Fish, Game, and Wildlife. 
There were tables that had 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 14 
a mission, an agenda, as did that sponsored by the NJ Pinelands 
Cultural Association. 
There were purveyors of the artifacts of 
tourism that we associate with the Jersey shore--painted sand 
dollars, popular art devoted to maritime subjects, T—shirts, etc. 
There were tables devoted to decorative decoys, and to artifacts, 
such as model sneakboxes, that have become associated with decoy 
culture. 
There were full size sneakboxes for sale, and, of 
course, there were old—time genuine gunning stools on display and 
for sale. 
There were two trucks, operated by the same company, selling 
hot dogs and soft drinks, and there was one truck which sold 
roast beef sandwiches and soft drinks. 
Across the street, at the 
Community Center, there were lectures, films and videos being 
shown from 11:00 a.m. till 4:00 p.m. 
There was also a retriever 
contest at 10:30 a.m., a working decoy contest from 1-3:00 p.m., 
and a "Waterfowl I.D. Contest" 
from 3:15-4:00 p.m. 
Unfortunately, I arrived at the festival after 2:00 in the 
afternoon, and didn't even see a schedule until after 3:00, so I 
missed all 
of these events. 
I have forgotten to add that there 
were also a "Best Display Contest" and a Model Sneakbox Contest 
held at the lake in the park itself, as were the retriever 
contest and the working decoy contest. 
Apparently all 
of the 
events held at the lake involved the water. 
For example, I am 
told that the model sneakboxes were judged in part on their 
performance in the water; and that the working decoys were judged 
on that basis as well. 
By the way, the title of this "festival" was "Old Time 
Barnegat Bay Decoy and Gunning Show." 
This title gestures toward 
the more traditional aspects of decoys and hunting through the 
adjectives Old Time. 
And there were old time decoys and 
traditional gunning boats represented there. 
However, these 
objects also attract others to themselves, such as the decorative 
decoys and the model sneakboxes. 
And even the working decoys, 
those decoys that were carved by men who lived decades ago and 
shot over in the marshes and lakes of the Barnegat Bay region, 
were "on display." 
It 
is almost inconceivable that they would 
ever be returned to the water. 
Nevertheless, the decoy contest was a "working decoy" 
contest; that is, 
the decoys in the competition were judged 
according to how well they fulfilled the requirements of the 
gunning situation. 
And they were judged in the only environment 
where that could be determined--the water. 
Later, I spoke with 
someone who had been involved 
in the contest, and she told me 
that actually, some concessions were made, 
in judging the winner, 
to more decorative modes of carving; that the winner was not of 
the same ilk as the so—called "old time Barnegat Bay gunning 
stools", but was, rather, fancier, suited more to the fancy of 
the human than the avian eye, to the collector rather than the 
hunter. 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 15 
More interesting, perhaps, 
is the model sneakbox 
competition, also judged in the water of the lake. 
All 
of the 
models that I saw at the festival were exact replicas, often 
built to scale, of their larger counterparts. 
Many also had 
miniature decoys in the gunning racks. 
They are made of white 
cedar, sometimes with planking, as 
in the full—size boats. 
And 
they float. 
Moreover, they must perform in the water, they must 
"work", and it 
is 
in fact their ability to, or rather their 
suggestion of, "work", or of a working boat, that is the essence 
of their nature as 
items of "display." 
Just as with decoys that 
are carved today and talked about as "working" decoys, though 
they are never intended even for the water, 
let alone the hunt, 
these boat models' dependence upon the concept "working" makes 
them worth looking at, contemplating, owning, displaying. 
What we talk about when we talk about old time Barnegat Bay 
decoys and gunning boat models is "work", and 
it begins to seem 
as though the concept "working" has become a central text of 
decoydom here in Barnegat. 
And it seems that this relationship, 
this subversion of the relationship between work and display as 
centered in the decoy, 
is a central problem for the investigator 
to resolve.

TX01: Today was a difficult day in some ways. 
That i 
difficulty in making contact with people. 
I started 
southerly direction from headquarters, hoping to see 
whom Jens had made contact with on September 21st. 
These people 
are Ted and Jane VonBosse of G—Port Republic; 13GT. 
Both people 
are carvers of wood and run a small shop out of their home. 
I 
went to see them in order to follow up on some leads that were 
given to Jens, but for which insufficient information was 
provided. 
Specifically, I was interested in seeing a man, one 
Jimmy Dickinson, who 
is supposed to have a gunning rig (decoys) 
the components of which were carved by Harry V. Shourds, an old— 
time decoy carver who lived 
in the Tuckerton area and 
is widely 
considered to be the finest carver in the Barnegat Bay tradition. 
A complete Shourds rig would be a find indeed! 
s, I had

When I arrived, however, I questioned Mrs. VonBosse about 
this rig, and she knew nothing about it. 
Furthermore, Mr. 
Dickinson, who, 
it turns out, 
lives right across the street, 
rectly with him.

In any case, I had a conversation with 
work, and about decoys and sneakboxes 
generally.

page 17 
there 
is also a sneakbox model on the shelf, and various knick— 
knack type objects; 
likewise, the living room of the VonBosse 
home, which is visible from the vantage point of the shop, 
is 
also full of such objects and carvings; there are tools lying 
about, carvings in progress, and finished carvings and other 
objects, including a sneakbox model, on display. 
In other words, 
much of what is for sale 
in the shop, or rather the type of 
object for sale 
in the shop, also forms the decorative basis of 
the VonBosse living room. 
The two areas are integrated 
thematically, suggesting, perhaps, a connection between the 
VonBosse's work and their lives. 
It should be noted here that, 
in a sense, the VonBosse's are 
"outsiders" in the area. 
Although they have lived 
in the area 
for a number of years, Ted VonBosse was born outside of the bay 
area, and teaches in the Economics Department at Stockton State 
College. 
Ted became interested in carving and duck hunting at an 
early age, but he has always maintained connections to the 
outside world. 
I believe that Jane 
is also from outside at least 
the immediate area. 
So then, their business raises interesting 
questions, because they are at once rooted, through subject 
matter of the objects they carve, 
in the area, but their work did 
not arise naturally out of their lives here, out of their 
participation in the round of daily living on the bay, but is 
rather more self—conscious, more calculated (I must emphatically 
stress here that I do not mean this perjoratively!). 
According 
to Jane, they live their lives as they do because they love the 
area and the artifacts with which they deal, but their situation 
is perhaps different from that of, say, Hurley Conklin of 
Manahawkin, who grew up on the bay and carved working decoys all 
his life, but who now has begun to carve working—type decorative 
decoys. 
It seems that the VonBosse's may have begun at the point 
where Hurley has ended up. 
I realize that my thoughts on the 
subject are perhaps rather muddled at this point, but this 
relationship, this hypothetical relationship concerning the 
relative positions of a Hurley Conklin and the VonBosse's should 
be followed up. 
I might add, or reiterate here, that I set out on this day 
of fieldwork in order to explore ideas of "display" as they are 
manifested locally, and this relationship, as I've described it 
between Hurley and the VonBosse's, may be useful 
in understanding 
this problem. 
After a while, our conversation turned mainly to 
decoys. 
I asked if Ted had any wooden decoys that he himself had 
carved to shoot over in duck hunting, and if he still used that 
type of decoy. 
Mrs. VonBosse said that he didn't, then thought 
for a moment and went into the house to 
look around. 
She 
returned several minutes later with an old wooden decoy that had 
simply been roughed out to the shape of a duck and given a simple 
coat of paint. 
The species was hard to identify, but I think it 
was a ruddy duck. 
According to Jane, this is the last of that type of decoy 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 18 
owned by her husband. 
Today, he uses cork decoys, some of which 
type, I might add, were on sale in the shop. 
I examined the wood 
decoy, and after a while asked if 
it was for sale. 
She 
immediately and decisively answered that it was not, and added 
that they wanted to save that one, 
it being the last of 
its kind. 
It seems that this type of decoy, or actual wooden gunning stool, 
is very rare today. 
Many duck hunters who are carvers carve only 
for decorative purposes. 
I have met only one (I'm sure there are 
others) who carve out rough wooden decoys for hunting. 
He 
is a 
young man, 
in his twenties, from the Point Pleasant area. 
Most 
of the people, carvers and collectors, with whom I've been 
dealing, are men of middle age or older. 
It may be that younger 
hunters still carve their own decoys, but I have no information 
on that yet. 
After a few minutes, Mrs. VonBosse invited me 
into the 
living area of the home itself, and suggested that I could look 
around. 
There were decoys on shelves and on the table. 
There 
was also a model sneakbox, which Mrs. VonBosse took off of the 
shelf it was on and allowed me to examine. 
I asked her about the 
models, and she indicated that they have been made for a long 
time, many years. 
I also asked if they could possibly be used as 
models in boatbuilding, and she said that she didn't know, but 
that she thought that such models as were used in building were 
half—hulls, which permitted the builder access to the inner 
dimensions of the boat as well as the outer. 
Mrs. VonBosse also brought out a decoy that she had 
purchased at the Tuckerton show earlier in the month. 
It was an 
old Canada Goose with the original paint still mainly intact, but 
faded badly. 
It was a good old decoy, hollow bodied and made of 
cedar, and 
it 
looked as though it had been used a great deal--it 
had an old, genuine, battered look. 
Truly a serviceable decoy. 
I asked why she bought it, and she indicated that it was because 
she liked it, 
it was a "basic" decoy, whose carver was not known; 
it was old, and had been used many times, from the looks of 
it, 
on the bay for duck hunting. 
I think that her interest in this 
old goose decoy is similar to my interest in the average gunning 
stool as described above. 
All 
of the old decoys that are found 
in collections today are of this type, but they have been 
transformed by the collectors' conception of the carver's skill 
and reputation, and by the marketplace. 
We no longer look upon 
them as their original makers would have. 
They have been 
relegated to the domain of collectible "art." 
They have become 
"untouchable" (by this I do not mean "unhandleable"), and are 
therefore in some manner removed from our experience, or at least 
one aspect of 
it. 
It is 
in this sense that the goose decoy 
before us was a "real" decoy, one that we could touch and 
contemplate using. 
However, even in this case, actual use as a 
decoy would stop at contemplation. 
It 
is just that this rougher, 
anonymous example of what has become an art form is somehow, 
it 
seems, for Mrs. VonBosse, more "accessible." 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 19 
I asked Jane VonBosse what she would do with this decoy, and 
she replied that she would display it, 
so that she and her 
husband and friends could enjoy it. 
But she also said that it 
would become the object perhaps of a painting, or a print, or 
perhaps a miniature carving that she herself would do. 
So then, 
it seems that this decoy will be "recycled" by Mrs. VonBosse; the 
decoy will form the subject of a new object. 
In my view, these 
are subjects which could, and perhaps should, be explored in 
greater depth, but my visit with Mrs. VonBosse was brief, and 
after a while she indicated that she had other things to do, but 
asked me to return and speak further with her as well as meet and 
talk with her husband. 
I left and headed south, toward the Noyes 
Museum in Port Republic, where I hoped to speak with Gary 
Giberson, curator of the decoy exhibit at the museum. 
I drove south on Route 9 for several miles, and turned left 
onto the road for the museum, which is marked with a large sign. 
When I arrived, I asked for Gary, but he wasn't in at the time, 
so I asked 
if I could speak with Fred Noyes. 
I am interested in 
speaking with Noyes because he 
is the person who came up with the 
idea, I believe, to start a museum. 
Noyes wasn't in, but the 
person at the desk suggested that I leave my card with a note, 
and that Mr. Noyes would call. 
However, I have tried to reach 
Noyes at home many times, and have left messages with various 
people indicating that I wanted to speak with him, but have been 
told that he 
is somewhat reclusive, and very busy, so my efforts 
have not been successful. 
So far, Noyes hasn't responded to my 
note. 
I had one more stop on my 
list for that day, and since 
Giberson wasn't available, decided to continue on my way to the 
Atlantic County historical Society. 
Mrs. VonBosse had said that 
there was a collection of 
local boat models there, and I wanted 
to see them, and perhaps speak with the curator about them. 
I decided to drive down Route 9, which was a mistake because 
there was a great deal 
of traffic, and several tie—ups due to 
construction activity on the road itself. 
When I arrived, the 
museum was closed, although a telephone recording had indicated 
that there were afternoon hours on that day. 
I left slightly 
discouraged, but hopeful that my contact with Jane VonBosse would 
prove to be fruitful.

TXO1:This morning I drove down to G—Waretown; 53GT to see Joe Reid 
and to check progress on the garvey he 
is building for Kenny 
Oliver. 
I arrived about 10:30 in the morning and noticed 
immediately that the place was quieter than usual. 
I walked over 
to Joe's workshop and looked inside to find that Joe wasn't there 
and neither was Kenny's garvey. 
There was an almost eerie 
stillness about the place, a sensation that I'm reasonably 
certain was enhanced by the "emptiness" caused by the absence of 
the boat, which had, on my last visit, 
literally almost filled 
the small shop. 
I was about to knock on the door and ask Joe's 
wife where I could find her husband, when I heard a car in the 
driveway, and Joe appeared behind the wheel of his station wagon. 
After greetings, Joe said that he had been down at the marina 
where he and Kenny had just put the boat in the water, and he had 
come back to pick up some sealer for the wood. 
He asked if I 
wanted to go back with him to see the boat, and I readily agreed. 
We drove over to the dock and Kenny was there in the boat, 
working on the cabin, putting in the plexiglass windows on the 
sides. 
I asked him how he felt about having the boat so soon (he 
and Joe had agreed on November 1st as the deadline), and he 
expressed his muted pleasure at this. 
Kenny is not 
demonstrative, but he could not completely hide his pleasure at 
having the boat. 
I looked it over and began taking some 
pictures. 
I asked what he would name her, and he responded, the 
"Mud Duck." 
I asked how he thought of that name, and he said 
that a guy he knew had that as a handle on the CB radio, and he 
liked the name and thought that it would be a good name for a 
boat. 
The Mud Duck was docked next to another garvey, also built 
by Joe Reid, called "Ciao!" 
Joe said that he had some work to do 
on this one next, some minor repairs, I believe. 
The Ciao! was 
built as a pleasure boat. 
It had a large cabin, some deck 
chairs, and hydraulic steering. 
It also lacked the toe rail 
on 
the deck, which is a feature of all working garveys, because it 
is onto this narrow deck that the catch is 
laid while clamming. 
The toe rail prevents them from sliding overboard. 
Kenny had 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 21 
already put some clamming baskets and a clamming rake 
in his new 
boat, and these seemed conspicuously absent from the Ciao! 
The new boat also rode much higher in the water than the 
older one. 
I asked Joe about this, and he said that it 
is 
because garveys ride high 
in the water to begin with, and because 
the new cedar hadn't taken any water yet, and until 
it did so, 
it 
would ride high and scud a bit in a strong wind. 
It was cold 
that day, and dark, and there was a strong wind off the bay from 
the northeast. 
As I stood there looking at the two garveys, both 
built by the same man but for different customers and radically 
different purposes, I thought about the pleasure garvey that 
would soon be taken out of the water, and the new work garvey 
that had just been put in. 
Nearby, a small yacht was being drawn 
out of the water and pulled onto a boat trailer that was attached 
to a car. 
The difference was striking. 
The pleasure boats were 
retreating from the advent of winter, while the work boats 
maintained their bearing into the cold. 
This is not a value 
judgment, just an observation. 
I asked Kenny if he could 
still take me out with him clamming. 
He said yes, that he would 
be going out on the 1st, which is opening day of the new clamming 
season (I think that "season" 
is correct, since clamming activity 
is 
regulated by the State, although it could be the opening of 
some clam beds that had previously been closed, an activity which 
the State also regulates). 
I asked what time he went out in the 
morning, and he said that since he clams by the raking method, he 
has to wait for the wind, which picks up later in the morning, 
after 7:00. 
Tongers go out earlier, at about 6:00. 
He gave me 
his work and home phone numbers, and I said that I would call 
soon. As we stood there, a man wandered over and approached Joe. 
He was sniffing the air, and making a show of 
it. 
He said, 
referring to the Mud Duck, "Smells new." 
Joe said that it was, 
and I asked him if he could tell because of the smell of the new 
paint. 
He said no, that he could smell the fresh cedar. 
He 
added, "Joe makes them [i.e. the garveys] to last a hundred 
years. 
And that's no exaggeration." 
And he took his leave and 
wandered off. 
It was time for Joe and me to go. 
I wished Kenny luck with 
the new boat, said I'd call, and we climbed into Joe's car. As we 
pulled out, the pleasure boat on the car trailer caught Joe's 
eye. 
He said, referring to the bay, "That's a bitter place 
in 
winter. 
In winter, we'd be out there scallopin. 
Any kind of day 
out [i.e. 
in any kind of weather] we worked. 
The water'd be 
freezin on us, but we worked." 
He added that "The tide's way 
full today", and explained that a northeast wind always brings 
the tide up, especially on the full moon. 
I asked Joe what he'd be doing now that the Mud Duck was out 
of the shop, and he said that he would catch up on some orders 
for tong 
handles, do some small boat repairs, and bring the 
Ciao! 
in for an overhaul. 
He added that he couldn't take the 
time to rest, there was too much work to do, but he said this 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 22 
matter—of—factly, without complaint. 
We arrived back at the 
house, and I took my 
leave, telling Joe that I would stop back 
soon.

TX01: I visited Joe Reid to tape an 
interview with him in his 
shop. 
When I arrived he was working on some tong handles. 
He 
said that he always has orders ahead for these clamming handles, 
and works at them steadily when he has the time, which is usually 
between boatbuilding activities. 
Joe stops working on the 
handles and begins to clean his workshop. 
He manages to generate 
a great deal 
of "waste" during boatbuilding, namely wood 
shavings, wood chips, scraps of wood, and a variety of bent nails 
and broken fastenings, all of which find their way to the 
workshop floor. 
It 
is cold, and Joe has closed the workshop in for the 
winter. 
He does this by fixing a large sheet of plastic film on 
the southern face of the shop. 
This is at an angle to the 
building, sloping down from the roof outward toward the ground. 
On one side of this plastic, Joe has a built—in door which 
provides access to and from the shop. 
I ask Joe about this 
canopy of plastic, and he says that it's there to provide warmth 
in winter. 
When the sun 
is shining, 
it produces a greenhouse 
effect near the shop front, and Joe can go there to warm himself, 
or work in that general area for a while. 
But there is 
no sun 
today, and 
it 
is cold inside. 
The shop seems empty without the garvey that Joe has been 
working on. 
He says that he'll be pulling one in soon for an 
overhaul. 
In the meantime he'll work on tong handles and do some 
minor repairs on two small garveys that are already in the yard. 
As we talk, I begin to set up the Nagra and the microphone, and 
we soon sit down to talk and record our conversation. 
After 
about twenty minutes, a customer comes into the shop to pick up a 
pair of tong handles, and I shut off the recorder. 
The customer 
stays for a while, then leaves just as Joe's son James arrives. 
James and I begin to talk about things in general, while Joe goes 
into the house to 
look for a needle used to make fikes. 
My 
conversation with James turns to smuggling activities on the bay, 
and to other illegal activities, although the conversation is for 
the most part non—directed and general 
in nature. 
Joe returns, 
unsuccessful 
in his search for the needle, and I begin to pack up 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 24 
the equipment. 
After several more minutes of conversation, I 
take my 
leave and drive north to headquarters. 
TX02: After taking leave of Joe Reid, I drove back up to 
headquarters to meet Mal O'Connor. 
We had plans to drive down to 
the G—Tuckerton; 47GT area to see some people with whom he had made 
contact the week before. 
They were Armand Carney and his wife, 
whose name escapes me now. 
Armand has lived 
in the area all 
of 
his 
life, but wants to 
leave now that the Pinelands Commission is 
administering in the region. 
He feels that the quality of 
life 
is deteriorating, that there are too many outsiders around, and 
that taxes are very high now, and are going toward services which 
have little to do with his life style. 
He 
is also a decoy carver 
and collector, and knew many oldtime carvers and collectors, 
including Bill Mackey, perhaps the man who started the collecting 
craze after the second world war. 
Mal 
and I arrived at about 2:30 in the afternoon. 
The 
Carneys have a shop, where they sell decoys and other carvings, 
as well as other items from area culture, but I didn't go 
into 
the shop nor did I question them about it during this visit. 
However, 
it seems that the shop makes an 
important connection for 
the Carneys, because they sell primarily, I believe, working— 
style decoys which Armand carves. 
During our conversation, the 
Carneys mentioned that they are leaving because they believe that 
the "rural" nature of the Tuckerton area has been undermined by 
development, by outsiders, and by an external administrative 
bureaucracy, namely the Pinelands Commission. 
They plan to find 
another area, probably in Virginia, where they can settle and 
resume the way of 
life to which they are accustomed. 
While 
there, they plan to 
live on 
income generated from the sale of 
decoys carved by Armand. 
The shop, the, 
is the connection between the old life and 
the new, just as decorative decoys made in the "working" style 
are a connection between the old and the new lifestyles in 
Barnegat Bay. 
The Carneys' 
living room, where we sat during the 
interview, features many examples of decoys carved by Armand, and 
by his wife's father, who was a Parker. 
The Carneys explained 
that there are two branches of the Parker family, and that they 
don't, 
in a general way "speak to each other." 
One family has 
settled in Tuckerton and its immediate environs; the other is 
from Parkertown. 
One of the members of this Parkertown branch 
is a well—known carver with a solid reputation--Lloyd Parker--
whose decoys are highly valued and command high prices. 
The 
Tuckerton branch looks down, according to the Carneys, on the 
Parkertown branch of the family. 
Armand took one decoy that had been made by his wife's 
father down from a shelf and showed it to me. 
It was very rough, 
unpainted, but never, I believe, shot over, although of a type 
that was probably used to very great extent in hunting. 
It 
is 
the last one that the man made, however, and 
is therefore highly 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 25 
prized. 
The image of the collectible decoy is one, I thing, 
which has been promulgated by collectors. 
That is, there have 
been tastemakers in decoy collecting, and this activity may have 
contributed to what has been preserved. 
This rough type of 
decoy, the kind that is carved out quickly for immediate use, 
is 
a rare find. 
The Carneys have preserved this one because it 
is 
sort of a family heirloom, one which they cherish for personal 
reasons as well as cultural ones. 
Mal 
and I weren't there to talk about decoys, but he had 
introduced me as a student of them, and this interested them 
greatly. 
Armand's wife asked me 
if I had ever hunted, and I said 
no, somewhat sheepishly, because I knew what was coming. 
She 
exclaimed over this confession, calling out to Armand good 
naturedly, and saying something like "How can you know something 
about decoys 
if you don't hunt?" 
I can't argue with her 
criticism, because decoys have always been implicated in hunting. 
However, decoys also exist outside the hunting situation. 
As we 
sat down with coffee, I asked Armand about his decoys. 
There 
were strings of them hanging from the mantlepiece, and others on 
the mantlepiece itself. 
Still others were on end tables and 
coffee tables around the room. 
I asked if he used them for 
hunting. 
He unhesitatingly answered "No." 
Like many other carvers with whom I have spoken, Armand is a 
hunter who has used wooden decoys in hunting, but no 
longer does. 
He carves decoys which could be used in hunting, decoys which he 
characterizes as "working decoys", but which are definitely not 
used in hunting. 
Rather, they are used as decoration, as 
display, and as sources of income. 
As I write this, the thought 
occurs to me that decoys have always been powerful money makers. 
In the old days, when market gunning was practiced, those gunners 
made a great deal 
of money daily. 
Somers Headley has said that, 
as a high school age boy, he made a hundred dollars a day, and 
this, I believe, 
in the nineteen twenties. 
Today, however, 
it 
is 
the decoys themselves that bring 
in the money, whereas before 
they were intermediaries in that process. 
Today, decoys are the 
"real thing." 
We talked about decoys for a while, and Armand's wife asked 
me who I've been talking to about decoys. 
I mentioned Harry 
Shourds, John Hillman, Mort Hansen, Somers Headley, Hurley 
Conklin, and others, and they are approving of those choices. 
They say that I'm on the right track, and we begin to talk about 
collecting. 
Armand tells some stories about how he acquired some 
of his decoys, two of which involve the late, great collector 
Bill Mackey. 
These stories are on tape, so I won't repeat them 
here, but Armand speaks affectionately of his adventures as a 
collector, and of some of the great finds that he has made. 
However, the purpose of our visit is to speak about the 
reasons why the Carneys have decided to leave the area. 
All 
of 
this 
is on tape, and I have already alluded in the most general 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 26 
way to these reasons earlier in this report, so I won't go into 
them here. 
However, much of our time there was spent in 
discussion of the changes that have taken place in the area. 
During the interview, I tried to draw Armand out on the subject 
of the difference between the old days and the current ones, with 
some success. 
And it seems that in some of that conversation, 
the differences begin to seem less different, and the new days 
part of a transformation in which the Carneys themselves have 
participated. 
I have not yet heard these tapes--they are Mal's, 
and he has done the logging--but it may be that decorative decoys 
that are made and discussed as working decoys may be a small part 
of that larger transformation. 
This comes close to sounding 
like I am taking a position on all 
of this, and I want to stress 
that I am not doing so. 
However, this, too, 
if seen as a problem 
of investigation instead of a position, calls out for further 
research. 
TX03: We spent several hours with the Carneys, and left early in 
the evening, just after six o'clock, to head back toward 
headquarters. 
We stopped on the way at the firehouse in G—Warren 
Grove; 56GT where a firehouse supper was being held. 
Our purpose 
in stopping was to drop a camera pack off to Nora, who was 
covering the event for the project, but we wound up buying dinner 
tickets and staying. 
We met several new people there, 
including 
Jack Cervetto and Mary—Ann Thompson, this latter a lawyer 
involved in the preservation movement in the area. 
We stayed for 
dinner, talked for a while (actually, the event ended after 
everyone had eaten), and left. 
Mal won one of the door prizes, 
and I took some photographs which are probably logged onto one of 
Nora's disks, since she was the principle recordist that evening. 
This event was interesting, since it didn't seem to have a 
real center. 
It was built around a meal, and the announcement of 
the door prize winners caused a bit of a stir, but by and large 
it was unfocused. 
An interesting problem, perhaps, for the 
ethnographer, because there was much "Brownian motion" 
in the 
room that evening at the individual tables, all 
of which was 
organized into a very loose structure, the meal, which, however 
loose, held the event together and provided a defining frame. 
We 
left about 8:30 and headed back to headquarters.

TX01: Before I started out today, I had determined that I would 
concentrate on one aspect of the work that I have been doing, an 
aspect which may be described as "display", by which I mean those 
activities by means of which local residents present their 
culture, or aspects of 
it, to others, either outsiders or 
insiders. 
This element of display takes several forms. 
First, 
there 
is the more formalized display of the Noyes Museum in G—Port 
Republic; 13GT. 
This museum was founded by Fred Noyes, a local 
businessman who was able to generate enough discretionary income 
to buy literally thousands of them. 
These are now either on 
display at the museum, or 
in a vault at the same location, 
waiting to be offered to the visitor. 
Also in this category, although there are important 
differences, 
is the 
local 
or county historical society. 
The two 
activities are the same in the sense that they are more 
formalized, and may be characterized by the great degree of 
access to them given the public. 
They are different in the sense 
that the historical society is more formally structured, more 
"public" by its very nature, 
in that the concerns which motivate 
it may be ascribed to the public domain, and may be characterized 
as of more general public concern. 
The Noyes Museum, on the 
other hand, represents private interests, the passion and dream 
of a single individual. 
Naturally, these distinctions gather 
exceptions to them, and are only made here for purposes of 
discussion. 
TX02: 
Before I move on to another, more prominent category of 
cultural display, I would like to discuss the one that motivated 
my interest. 
When talking with Joe Reid in G—Waretown; 56GT 
several weeks ago, he showed me some models of garveys that he 
had designed and built. 
Since that time, I've noticed that 
people are producing, and have produced, models of sneakboxes, 
Sea Bright skiffs, decoys, as well as other artifacts. 
I should 
note here that by model I mean "miniaturization", that is, small 
scale versions of the actual artifact. 
In shipbuilding, or 
boatbuilding, some craftsmen have used models as templates in 
order to produce boats. 
These models were, however, "half— 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 28 
hulls", that is, one half of a boat, cut from bow to stern down 
the center line, from which the builder took his measurements, or 
determined relationships. 
The models that I am referring to are complete, they are not 
half—hull type models, and therefore do not, or cannot, nor were 
they intended to, function in boatbuilding. Rather, these models 
are representations of their larger counterparts. 
The sneakbox 
models, for example, usually appear complete with gunning racks, 
oars, canvas spray breaker, and miniature decoys. 
Not only, 
then, do they restore the missing hull, but they take care to 
accurately represent, 
in detail, the full scale artifacts. 
TX03: 
Most of the models that I've seen recently have been 
offered up for sale by their makers. 
Bob Rudder of West Creek, 
for example, builds sneakbox models, and he was 
in G—Tuckerton; 
47GT recently for the annual decoy show with some of his 
miniatures. 
Although the market aspect of these models is 
important, my 
interest in them initially was due to a suspicion 
that these models were a means to present the local culture to 
others; they captured an aspect of that culture in a form that 
was more readily available for presentation. 
I must add here 
that full—size sneakboxes were on view and for sale at the 
Tuckerton show very close to the table where Bob Rudder worked, 
and both may be described, at least in this setting, both 
in 
terms of the market and 
in terms of display. 
But these models 
function at a different level of, or are a different 
manifestation of, display. 
I am on difficult ground here 
because I am attempting to conceptualize the essence of display 
of culture by focusing on the model, while at the same time am 
attempting to portray the model as a category of display. 
For 
the time being, I will 
let this obvious confusion continue, and 
try to get back to 
it at a later date. 
Moreover, I have little 
direct evidence that the model functions in this way at all. 
Rather, the model as display is my working hypothesis, 
in defense 
of which I have gathered little evidence to date. 
TX04: 
There is another category of display which I offer 
tentatively at this point. 
I can best describe it by referring 
to an actual 
instance of 
it. 
Recently, I visited the VonBosse's 
of G—Port Republic; 13GT. 
He 
is a carver, hunter, and professor at 
Stockton State College. 
She 
is a carver, specializing in "folk" 
art, 
if I must categorize it. 
They have a shop 
in their home 
which is entered from a porch. As the visitor enters, he is 
confronted with a display of decoys carved by Ted VonBosse and a 
display of figures and other carvings produced by his wife (her 
name escapes me at this point). 
These objects, all of which are 
for sale, are arranged on shelves which are ahead and to the 
right of the viewer as he enters through the door. 
Straight 
ahead, there 
is a counter, behind which. is a work area used by 
Mrs. VonBosse; 
it 
is the area where she does her carving. 
To 
the 
left of this area (it would be ahead and to the left as the 
visitor enters) there is an opening through which one can pass 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes

from the public area of the shop to the private area of the home. 
The problem is that there 
is 
little to distinguish, at first, 
casual glance, this shop area from the home area. 
Mrs. VonBosse 
indicated that many people have entered the private area in the 
past, an activity which has forced her to put a chain across this 
opening, adorned with a sign forbidding entry without express 
invitation. 
My problem here 
is that the home, shop, and work areas are 
so obviously linked with one another, at least visually, and 
perhaps causally. 
My point, however, 
is that it 
is difficult for 
the casual observer to distinguish one area from the other unless 
he decides to 
look more closely and to consciously formulate 
distinctions. 
This similarity in the three areas may not hold up 
when scrutinized more closely, but I am interested in doing just 
that. 
In this case, the home "displays" the work, and the work 
"displays" the home. 
Where are the boundaries? 
Where do work, 
home, and business intersect? diverge? 
If distinctions or 
similarities are to be posited, which are the appropriate ones? 
And where and how does "display" enter? 
More later. 
TX05: 
As noted earlier, I started out today with the 
intention to explore some of the issues of display as 
it relates 
to Barnegat Bay culture. 
I visited two places looking for 
clues--the G—Noyes Museum; 13GT, where I talked with Gary Giberson, 
the curator of the decoy exhibit area; and the Atlantic County 
Historical Society, where I looked at some models of 
local ships. 
My visit with Giberson did not yield the kind of result I had 
hoped for, 
largely because it was difficult to establish an 
initial rapport with him. 
Gary is a member of an old family in 
the Port Republic area. 
He explains that his family came over 
here from England, where they were woodworkers and boatbuilders, 
in 
1680, and so have historically deep as well as close ties to 
the 
land here. 
His family currently operates a saw mill, where 
they mill mainly Jersey white cedar taken from swamps which they 
own. 
So, then, Gary himself has a connection to wood, 
specifically to cedar, a connection which, 
in recent years, he 
has articulated through the duck decoy. 
As I said, 
it was difficult to establish rapport with Gary. 
At times during our conversation he was, at best, reticent to 
discuss things with me. 
He seems to have a basic dislike of or 
distrust of academics, and draws a clear distinction between 
those who live the life worth studying, and those who do the 
studying. 
His sympathies lie with the former. 
After a while, 
however, Gary warmed up to me, and our conversation proceeded 
rather smoothly, but in directions that he chose--I had to forego 
my agenda on this visit. 
However, he has agreed to meet with me 
and discuss the display of decoys, and other subjects, no doubt, 
at a later date. 
The Noyes Museum is divided into two main sections, the 
first of which features modern art and sculpture. 
I gather that 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 30 
this section was not in the original plan, but that it was forced 
on Noyes and Giberson in the following manner. 
Noyes had wanted 
to devote an entire museum to decoys, with Giberson as curator. 
However, Noyes found it necessary, for the economic survival of 
the museum, to secure tax exempt status. 
This appeal to the 
authorities forced Noyes to acquiesce in other areas, however; 
that is, 
tax exempt status thrust a more formalized, more public 
responsibility on Noyes, and his museum had to conform to 
standards that were established for such institutions in the 
public domain. 
For one thing, he had to hire a curator who had 
been trained and awarded a degree by an accredited educational 
institution. 
This left Giberson out in the cold (part of the 
reason, perhaps, for his dislike of academics?) and it forced 
Noyes to expand the concept and format of the museum to include 
the section devoted to modern art. 
Noyes built a beautiful building to house his collection of 
decoys and display the modern art. 
The visitor enters and 
is at 
once confronted with the stark, angular world of the modernist 
vision, but if he persists and finds his way to the back of the 
building, he can enter the world of traditional Barnegat Bay 
culture via the duck decoy. 
According to my information, 
obtained from Giberson and others, this section has been 
conceived, planned, and executed by Gary Giberson. 
He has become 
a sort of advisor to Noyes, making decisions about display, and 
suggesting which decoys should be purchased. 
The museum, and 
Gary's official status there (though unofficial 
in the eyes of 
the State) provides a structure through which Giberson can 
express his personal vision of decoys and, by extension, local 
culture, for which, I believe, Giberson believes himself to be a 
spokesman. 
The section of the museum devoted to decoys consists of a 
single large room, roughly rectangular in shape. 
As the visitor 
enters, he finds himself in a sort of anteroom. 
There are 
shelves here with decoys lined up on them, perhaps numbering 
several hundred in all. 
Several feet above eye level, on top of 
the shelves, there is a space where the decoys are not arranged 
carefully on shelves, but rather are piled on top of each other; 
that is, 
they are arranged across the top of the shelving and 
then are stacked, one row of birds upon another, 
in a very dense 
formation. 
As the visitor moves to the right and forward, he 
enters the display area proper, which consists of a series of 
glass cases, or plexiglass cases, 
in which the decoys are 
arranged into significant groupings. 
For example, one case 
contains five or six brant decoys, all 
of which were carved by 
carvers from the Barnegat Bay area, and which juxtaposition 
demonstrates the stylistic differences among the carvers. 
I 
didn't measure these cases, but most of them are small and 
squarish, perhaps measuring three by three feet. 
In the center 
of the room is a much larger rectangular case, containing many (I 
would guess about twenty or thirty) decoys. 
I do not know the 
organizational principle according to which they were selected 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 31 
for and arranged in this case. 
I might add here that not all 
of 
the decoys are 
in these cases. 
Some are on stands along the 
pathways in the room. 
I might also add that not all 
of the 
decoys are from the Barnegat Bay area, although I believe that a 
large concentration of them are. 
I also believe, according to 
the information I have, that the Barnegat Bay decoys form the 
focus or the core of the collection. 
However, this is only 
conjecture at this point. 
A case in point on the subject of 
diversity. however: 
As the visitor enters, a prominent pair of 
decoys are a pintail drake and hen carved by Lem Ward, a noted 
Maryland carver. 
In the rear of the room, there is a work area and office, 
where Giberson spends a great deal 
of time. 
The work area is 
Giberson's. 
It 
is here that he carves his own decoys. 
However, 
the element of display is a strong factor here in the workshop as 
well. 
For example, all 
of the tools that Giberson uses are made 
available or accessible to the gaze of the visitor. 
But there 
are also a group of tools, which may be characterized as old, 
probably belonging to the late nineteenth century, which serve no 
purpose except as 
items of display (and as conversation pieces). 
Moreover, the work area is "open" to the public, 
in the sense 
that the visitor may approach it and have complete visual access 
to 
it. 
It 
is separated from the decoy display area by a low 
fence. 
To my knowledge, visitors may not actually enter this 
area. 
But they can approach it, watch Gary work, ask him 
questions about work in progress, about technique, about tools, 
etc. and Gary answers in the form of extended monologues which 
sometimes shape themselves into narratives, for Giberson is also 
(and I do not use the term perjoratively here) a performer. 
I should correct my statement given above about the old 
tools serving no purpose except that of display. 
In fact, they 
also impart a sense of time depth, of history, of tradition, to 
the experience of the workshop. 
And this is 
in keeping with 
Gary's role as performer, for Giberson seems to be (more work is 
in order here) a performer/presenter/enactor of his culture in 
the limited context of the section of the museum over which he 
has control. 
And an important part of this performance, of 
Gary's very presence there, 
is that it conveys a sense of the 
decoy as part of a larger historical tradition. 
Gary seems to be 
not simply an interpreter of this tradition, but a 
personification of 
it in this particular setting, a 
personification which is a self—conscious enactment on Gary's 
part. 
Again, more work is 
in order here, but this self— 
consciousness seems to be the important factor here. 
It is the 
impulse which prompts the displays of culture that I have 
encountered, and seems to be rather fully developed in Gary. 
However, I would stress the fact that this is only a preliminary, 
highly tentative working hypothesis; 
it 
is not a conclusion! 
It may very well be that Gary is "performing" for much of 
the time he 
is at work 
in the museum. 
However, there 
is a time 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 32 
set aside, at 2:00 p.m. every afternoon that the museum is open, 
when Gary engages in a more structured performance. 
It 
is at 
this time that he lectures on the decoy and 
its place in Barnegat 
Bay culture; tells personal experience narratives and family 
stories; and demonstrates how to carve a decoy. 
He draws what 
seem like large crowds for these display events, and he rises to 
the occasion with a highly polished though spontaneous, and often 
quite affecting performance. 
I have seen this myself and have 
heard a number of accounts of 
it from others who live 
in the area 
or who know Gary personally. 
Everyone agrees that Gary 
is quite 
"good" at what he does, that he is an honest and earnest purveyor 
of a part of his cultural tradition, and that what he's doing is 
at least interesting, 
if not important. 
However, I am unprepared 
at the present time to give a fuller account of this, and I am 
unable, therefore, to provide a fuller analysis. 
My comments 
here are intended to be suggestive, and to indicate that perhaps 
further work is 
in order here. 
But I must return now to my 
original purpose in this field report, which is to point to some 
interesting instances of what I believe are examples of cultural 
"display" and to suggest that it may be fruitful to study these 
further, at more leisure and 
in greater depth. 
I have even less to say about my second visit this day--to 
the Atlantic County Historical Society. 
The Society is 
located 
in the town of Somers Point, not far from the Cape May County 
border. 
I went there because, 
in the course of my inquiries 
about boat models, I was told that there is a collection of such 
models on display there. When I arrived, I found that the curator 
was not in, but a museum volunteer offered to show me the room 
where the boat models were. 
There, I saw mainly models of 
whaling ships and schooners, but there were one or two examples 
of oyster boats, sneakboxes, and, I think, a Sea Bright skiff. 
I 
don't recall seeing any garveys, but I didn't have much time to 
look around. 
I think that two things must be done here. 
First, 
some sort of 
inventory must be taken of the types of boat 
represented there. 
This may give a sense of the orientation, in 
curatorial terms, of the collection. 
Second, 
it must be 
determined who made the models and for what purpose, and how and 
why the museum acquired them. 
Third, the curatorial philosophy 
behind the display must be ascertained, 
in order to get a sense 
of how the display is meant or intended to function. 
Finally, 
it 
must be determined how and to what purpose this particular 
exhibit is contextualized within the overall display orientation 
of the museum of the historical society itself. 
That is, where 
does the museum stand in relation to maritime culture? 
How is 
this culture a part of the museum? 
The answers to these 
questions may permit the formulation of more significant, 
appropriate, or relevant questions. 
This subject of display may be an important aspect of the 
culture of the Barnegat Bay area. 
Why 
it 
is so remains a 
question. 
It may be the result of the acquisition by the people 
of a certain self—consciousness concerning their culture, but 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 33 
this speculation can only lead to further conjecture. 
Tourism 
may be a factor here, as may economics. 
So may the revival of 
interest in "folk art". 
In any case, display seems to be a part 
of culture here, and 
it remains to be explored and explicated. 
Further reports on this will follow further work.

TX01: Today I went with Nora Rubinstein to visit Ed Hazelton of 
G—Manahawkin; 56GT. 
Yesterday, 3 November, Nora had suggested that 
I might want to interview Ed, because he carves decoys and 
is 
involved 
in duck hunting and with local culture generally. 
I 
said that I was interested, but we didn't make any definite 
plans. 
However, while visiting with Gary Giberson at the Noyes 
Museum yesterday, a couple, a man and a woman, came in and struck 
up a conversation with Gary. 
The talk turned to decoys and 
sneakboxes, and Gary pointed to a model sneakbox and asked the 
man, to whom I had not been introduced, 
if he could identify it. 
Much to Gary's surprise, he identified it without hesitation as 
having been made by Hurley Conklin, a local carver. 
He said he 
knew that because Hurley had made one for his son and that it was 
distinctive, 
in part because it had some decoys on the back, and 
they had the distinctive, rather elongated tail that is one of 
the identifiable features of Hurley's gunning stools. 
Then this 
stranger alluded to his own model sneakboxes, and my interest was 
fully aroused, 
in part because I was investigating the question 
of display, and model sneakboxes were part of that investigation. 
Later, when Gary had gone into the office, I introduced 
myself to the man, who said he knew my name, and introduced 
himself as Ed Hazelton! 
We made plans to get together in the 
morning at his house. 
My plan was to interview him about models, 
display, etc. 
However, Nora had told him that I was interested 
in decoys, an 
interest that Ed and I share, to be sure, and so 
our conversation turned to decoys, went more deeply into the 
subject, and never even broached the subject of display. 
The 
substance of our discussion can be found by consulting the RLOGS 
cited above. 
However, perhaps a few explanatory comments are in 
order here. 
Ed Hazelton has lived in Manahawkin all 
his life. 
As a 
youth, he hunted ducks in the nearby marshes and ponds, both from 
sneakboxes and from sink boxes. 
He knows the area well, but in 
addition to that, he 
is an old time duck hunter, and hunted at a 
time when there were four full time, professional decoy carvers 
in town, who served the needs of both the local hunters and the 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 35 
sport hunters who came in from the outside. 
He 
is full 
of 
memories about this period in his life. 
Today, he still hunts, 
but uses L.L. Bean cork decoys. 
Since his retirement, he has 
been carving his own decoys, almost exclusively for display 
purposes. 
He keeps many of these decoys, and gives others away 
to family members and friends. 
Ed says he carves strictly for enjoyment and for therapeutic 
purposes--carving keeps him busy, occupied, and therefore feeling 
happy and productive. 
However, he doesn't carve working decoys, 
although he says that they can be used. 
His carvings are like 
working decoys, but they are intended for decorative purposes 
only. 
I am curious why this attitude seems to be so predominant 
that it 
is almost formulaic--decoys or wildfowl carvings are 
today carved as 
if they will be used, they can be used 
if 
necessary or desirable, but they seem never to actually BE used. 
I encounter this attitude, which often takes the form of an 
explanation of the decoys, again and again. 
Is 
it because of a 
sort of self—consciousness of the decoy as a "folk art" form that 
impels people to make statements like this? 
Is 
it an aspect of 
the element of "display" which I think I've detected here? 
Decoys made today 
in the Barnegat Bay area are made for showing, 
but what they "show" 
is how decoys must look and BE in order to 
"wo rk . 
" 
Ed's work as a decoy carver is also interesting because 
there are clear influences at work in 
it. 
That is, Ed showed me 
a brant that he had carved, and the influence of Hurley Conklin 
was dramatically evident. 
I asked him about this, and he said 
something like "Yeah, Hurley gave me a little help with that 
one." 
Ed has also been influenced by a local carver named Bill 
Crammer, and by Lem Ward. 
Ed 
is a great admirer of the work of 
Lem Ward, as 
is Mr. Crammer, according to Ed. 
Crammer is someone 
1 must get over to see, perhaps with Ed along to 
introduce me. 
Ed's living room, where we sat and talked, 
is full of decoys 
that he has carved. 
There are also books on sports, duck 
hunting, birds and bird watching, history, and guns. 
Ed also has 
two old shotguns on display, one on the bannister of the stairway 
which leads to the second floor of the house, and one hanging 
from the mantlepiece in the living room itself. 
This latter gun 
belonged to Ed's father, the former to Ed himself. 
Both guns are 
more than fifty  years o 
I 
d. 
Ed also has on display several models of 
local boats, 
including two sneakboxes, a single—masted schooner, and a sort of 
skiff which Ed says was the kind used to ferry visiting sportsmen 
across the bay to their respective gun clubs or hotels. 
Although, as stated above, my intention was to speak with Ed 
about these models and their significance, I wasn't able to turn 
the conversation to this subject. 
However, the very subject of 
decoys raises the question of display, 
it now seems, but our talk 
on this day focused principally on old time gunning and Ed's 
Carroll--83 Fieldnotes 
page 36 
earlier experiences on the bay as a hunter and sometime guide, 
although this latter activity was one that he engaged in only 
rarely. 
While there, I also shot one roll of film (see PFP83— 
CTC002), but many of these photographs did not turn out well. 
There are, however, some pictures of Ed, the decoys, the book 
shelves, Ed's "glass" collection, consisting primarily, I think, 
of old Mason jars, the guns mentioned above, and some of the boat 
models. 
I talked with Ed for about an hour and a half, at which 
point I had to 
leave, and Nora began putting her questions to 
him.

TXO1: I have come today to interview Joe Reid, the garvey 
builder, at his workshop in G—Waretown; 53GT. 
When I arrive, he 
is 
working on tong handles, and there is a boat in the shop, the 
Ciao!, which he says he will overhaul and do general repairs on 
over the next few weeks. 
It 
is much warmer today than the last 
time I was here, and the sun 
is shining. 
We talk about the 
weather for a few minutes, and I ask Joe 
if I can take some 
pictures. 
He agrees, and I begin to photograph him at work on 
the handles, and to photograph some of the completed handles 
which are standing in the front of the shop, near the plastic 
canopy. 
As we talk, Joe's wife comes out with some family letters 
and old newspaper articles. 
Joe's wife is 
an Applegate; her 
grandfather invented the Applegate scoop that was used to harvest 
berries in the region, and she has one of the scoops that he 
made. 
She 
is very much interested in her family's history, and 
she shows me the letters and articles, which deal with her 
ancestors' activities in the area in the mid—eighteenth century. 
Unfortunately, I can't spend too much time talking to her, 
because I must speak with Joe today, but I intend to get back 
there and interview her on tape some time soon. 
However, her 
presence permits Joe to get back to work, which he had stopped 
doing to talk to me, and as she and I talk and watch Joe, I also 
have the opportunity to take some photographs of the process of 
producing clamming tongs. 
The tong handles are made of mahogany, and are long and 
thin--these are about eighteen feet long, but the hand►es can 
vary, Joe tells me, from twelve to about twenty feet in 
length. 
These have already been shaped and planed, and it remains for Joe 
to fit the heads onto the wooden handles. 
In order to do this, 
he has to finish shaping the ends of the handles to conform with 
the supports on the heads. 
He does this with a table saw and 
then a small plane. 
When the end 
is shaped, Joe fits it onto the 
head, which is made of stainless steel and looks like a rake with 
teeth on the end. 
He takes the head off and shaves a little more 
wood from the handle, then hammers the head back on and bolts it 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 38 
into place. 
When each head has been fitted in this manner, he 
drives a copper pin through a hole 
in each of the two handles in 
the set, and fits them together like scissors. 
Next, he nails a 
small brass plate onto one of the handles, which has the year and 
the number of the handles made 
in that year, for identification 
purposes. 
Joe says that he does this with every pair, and 
if 
someone returns with a pair of broken handles, he checks the 
date, and 
if 
it 
is very recent, say only several months, since he 
made them, he'll replace or repair them for free. 
It also 
provides identification for the clammer's purposes. 
After a while, Joe went into the house and returned with 
some materials about Barnegat Bay, 
including Bob Jahn's book 
about Barnegat Bay. 
There were also several newspaper articles 
that were written about Joe and published in 
local papers. 
One 
of them characterized Joe and his work as parts of a dying 
tradition. 
I didn't ask Joe how he felt about that 
characterization, but I will make it a point to ask at a later 
date. 
However, the important point here 
is that Joe pointed to 
Jahn's book, which is mainly taken up, 
as far as I know, with 
tales and legends from the area, and anecdotal information, and 
said that is was o.k., and that it obviously took a lot of work 
to research and produce it, but it was inadequate because it 
didn't deal with the facts. 
Joe 
is 
interested in having people 
know how life was lived on the bay, what it was and is 
like to be 
a bagman, and 
it seems that Jahn's book 
is more like whimsical, 
old fashioned folklore, and this 
is not what Joe 
is primarily 
interested in. 
At this point I recalled what Joe had said during our last 
interview (see PFP83—RTC003) about a ghost story I told him that 
I had read 
in an old issue of the Proceedings of the New Jersey 
Historical Society. 
When I told the story, Joe's response was 
that he didn't give that kind of story much credit, and said that 
that kind of belief was only held by some of the older people, by 
which I think he meant earlier generation of people. 
This 
emphasis on facts is, I think, 
important, and 
is perhaps related 
to Joe's wife's interest in family and local history. 
But more 
than that, perhaps, 
it 
is revealing of another aspect of the 
self—consciousness, or perhaps more appropriately here, cultural 
self—awareness of the people who live on the bay, especially 
among the older generation of residents who are observing a great 
change in the area with the introduction or large numbers of what 
they would consider outsiders. 
I shot a number of pictures of the shop and the tools, and 
some of Joe at work, and after his wife went back to the house, I 
set the tape recorder up and we talked for about an hour and a 
half, until we were interrupted by a customer looking for 
clamming tongs. 
(See PFP83—ATC001 and 002 for a log of this 
interview.)

TX01: Today was not a typical field day, because I was working 
with a reporter and a photographer from the New York Times, 
named, respectively, Bob Hanley and Marilyn Yi. 
Hanley had 
apparently called Mary Hufford to ask 
if he could accompany a 
field worker on his daily rounds. 
She asked me 
if I would mind, 
and I said that I wouldn't, so, along he came. 
Actually, I was 
not very optimistic about dealing with the press, because it 
is 
difficult at best to convey the nature and spirit of ethnographic 
work as 
it 
is now practiced to even a sensitive person from 
another profession. 
The press, especially in the feature 
department, tries to entertain as well as edify, and 
in so doing, 
often, I think, reaches for the handy stereotype, the apparent 
novelty, the interesting conundrum. 
This latter, especially, can 
be volatile if handled improperly; 
it can make you wince! 
I 
haven't yet seen Hanley's article or Yi's photographs, so I'll 
reserve judgment for now. 
Anyway, the day went quite well, as far as 
it goes. 
Both 
Hanley and Yi 
were very nice, very sensitive people, with 
exceptions which I will discuss later. 
Mary had apparently told 
Hanley that I was "following wood around" the Pine Barrens and 
the bay, and he was intrigued by this idea. 
When he called me to 
arrange the interview earlier in the week, he asked me about it, 
and we talked about wood for a while. 
However, I'm not sure that 
he's clear on the fact that my pursuit of wood is an 
investigative strategy, adopted primarily because of the survey 
nature of the project. 
The important thing, of course, 
is that 
wood leads to people. 
As I have said, we talked on the phone, and over the next 
several days made solid plans to meet in New Jersey on the 
morning of the 17th. 
We were to meet at the marina where Kenny 
Oliver. a part time clammer, docks his garvey, which was built by 
Joe Reid. 
Kenny was the choice of clammer partly because of his 
connection with Joe, which is 
in keeping with the idea of 
following the wood (by wood I mean white cedar) around. 
We 
agreed to meet at 9:30 in the morning at the marina, which is 
near G—Forked River; 49GT, 
in Lacey Township just about a mile off 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 40 
of Route 3, on Lacey Road. 
It was windy, but not too cold, even 
on the bay. 
Our purpose in going out was to see a clammer at 
work on a traditional Barnegat Bay clamming boat. 
We set out on 
the boat, the "Mud Duck", at about 10:00 a.m. 
We approached the 
bay via the Forked River, on which the marina is 
located. 
We 
traveled for about a mile, greeting several clammers along the 
way. 
Marilyn was busy snapping pictures with a telephoto lens, 
and Bob and I were in the bow of the boat, talking. 
As we went 
out, I asked Kenny several questions about navigation in the bay 
the names of 
islands we were passing, the depth of the water and 
nature of the bay floor at that point, etc. 
Bob and I talked 
about the weather, then about wood and about the clamming 
utensils that were lying 
in the bottom of the garvey. 
It took 
about fifteen or twenty minutes to get to a spot that Kenny 
thought was good for clamming. 
0 
At that point, Kenny threw out a "drag anchor", which was 
actually a small grappling hook that is used to drag the bottom 
and slow the motion of the boat due to the action of wind and 
tide. 
There are several methods of clamming, two of which we 
tried that day, and one of which 
is Kenny's principle method, 
that is, what is known as "rakin." 
The clammer who works in this 
method does so 
in the following manner; He stands in the stern 
of the boat, on one side of the boat's motor. 
He takes a 
clamming rake, which is a stainless steel bar about twenty feet 
long. 
A basket—like rake, also made of stainless steel, 
is 
attached to the end. 
This rake has steel teeth on the end, which 
are used to dig into the bottom in order to reach the clams. 
This rake 
is 
lowered into the water, which was at a depth of 
about four feet where we were clamming. 
The clammer then holds 
onto the handle of this rake, which is perpendicular to the 
shaft, or bar, and pushes the rake into the sand at the bottom of 
the bay. 
He does this 
in a rotating motion, that is, 
he moves 
his hands, one of which is placed on either side of the handle, 
in a rotating motion up and away from his body and down and 
toward his body, 
in small rapid circles. 
As he does this, the 
boat is drifting, which in effect pushes the rake along the 
bottom and scoops the clams up. 
Kenny says that, by using the 
raking method, the boat actually does the work. 
As Kenny worked, both Bob Hanley and I asked him a series of 
questions. 
I was interested in the process itself, and the 
equipment used. 
I also wanted to know how the clammer knew when 
he had clams in his rake. 
Kenny said that he could both feel 
them as they knocked against the stainless steel 
rake, and hear 
them, a noise which was transmitted up along the bar or shaft of 
the rake, 
it seems, but which was audible to everyone standing in 
the boat. 
I was particularly interested in this issue, because I 
had heard, from Joe Reid, that clammers depended upon vibrations 
in the rake or tong (another method of clamming) handles in order 
to know if they were indeed taking any clams. 
Kenny said that he 
listens and feels for clams, and can usually count them as they 
go 
into the rake. 
This is a kind of skill that i would like to 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 41 
explore at some future date. 
Every few minutes, Kenny would lift the rake out of the 
water to empty it of 
its catch. 
He placed the clams on the deck 
of the garvey, which is narrow, only about a foot wide, and 
is 
guarded by a toe rail. 
He sorted the clams by size and threw 
back any debris or weeds that had come in with the clams, then 
threw the rake back and began the process all over again. 
Kenny 
explained that there were three types of clam, differentiated 
from each other by size only--the littleneck, the cherrystone, 
and the chowder clam, 
in order of 
increasing size. 
After he had 
captured a quantity of these clams, and they were sorted, he 
bagged them (200 per bag) and stowed them on the boat's floor. 
I 
should mention an intermediate step. 
As the deck filled up with 
clams, Kenny cleaned them of debris and threw them into a wire 
basket, where they awaited bagging. 
I neglected to ask the name 
of this basket, but these are the intermediate storage areas for 
the clams while clamming. 
Bagging is only done periodically, 
while the clams are consigned to the baskets on a regular basis 
as the deck fills up. 
As Kenny clammed, or raked, to use the more precise term, I 
asked him about the clam beds, that is, their shape and nature. 
Kenny answered that it seemed that at that point they ran 
in wide 
swaths from west to east. 
Kenny made some comments that 
indicated to me that he had somehow divined that knowledge from 
his experience on that part of the bay, noting where the clams 
seemed plentiful and where they were sparse, and "mapping" the 
location of the beds. 
As I looked out over the water, with 
Barnegat Light, on the southern tip of Long Beach Island far to 
the southeast, Oyster Creek to the west, and the Forked River to 
the northeast (these directions are approximate and would need to 
be checked) 
I was filled with admiration at this knowledge of 
the clam beds' 
location. 
There seemed to be so much space and so 
little differentiating detail on the bay, and Kenny seemed so 
sure, so genuinely sure of his surmises, that I was deeply 
impressed. 
I think that the questions of navigation and this 
type of mapping on the bay should be explored in much more 
detail. 
Kenny clammed on this spot for about an hour, then asked if 
we would like to see how tonging is done. 
He had brought along a 
pair of tongs, also made by Joe Reid, 
in order to demonstrate. 
We all agreed to do that, and Kenny drew in the anchor and set 
out for a good tonging location. 
As he did that, Kenny explained 
that the beds on which raking was done were different from those 
on which tonging was done. 
The former required looser, muddier 
beds. 
Clamming done by the raking method also does more damage 
to the bottom, tearing it up a bit more than the tongers do. 
Tonging, on the other hand, 
is done in sandier, harder areas, and 
the tong's teeth are not thrust as deeply into the bottom of the 
bay. 
Someone, either Bob or Marilyn, asked at this point about 
the difference in the taste of clams, and Kenny replied that 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 42 
clams are what they eat. 
Clams on sandy bottoms ingest sand, and 
that affects their taste; the same is true of clams in beds on 
muddy bottoms. 
This is how Ken Oliver explains taste differences 
in clams. 
We headed toward the Oyster Creek. 
We could see the nuclear 
generating station in the distance. 
At the point where the creek 
flowed into the bay, we anchored. 
This time, however, we really 
did anchor the boat, although it continued to move slightly. 
I 
asked Kenny how anchoring the garvey was different in tonging and 
raking, since he used the same grappling hook as an anchor. 
Kenny responded that the difference lay 
in the length of rope 
used or let out with the anchor. 
I believe that for tonging, 
during which the boat is more stationary, a much shorter length 
of rope 
is used. 
Kenny explained that he wasn't anchoring the 
boat in the strict sense of the word, but rather slowing it down 
considerably more than he would do 
if he were raking. 
In tonging, a rake 
is also used to gather up the clams (I 
took some photographs of each implement, but the camera wasn't 
working properly and I'm not sure they'll be o.k., but I'll edit 
their numbers into this report if they are) but it 
is of a 
different type than that used for raking. 
Both are made of 
stainless steel, but the tines are shaped differently, those on 
the raking rake being more bowed and thicker in diameter. 
Moreover, the teeth of the raking rake are longer and thicker to 
facilitate digging. 
The tonging rake 
is attached to two tongs, 
or long handles, made of wood, usually mahogany. 
The tongs can 
vary from about twelve to about twenty feet in 
length. 
Kenny's 
were on the long side. 
The tonger stands on the side of the 
boat, as Kenny demonstrated, and lowers the tongs with rake into 
the water. 
He keeps the tongs at right angles to the bay bottom, 
and as the rake rests on the bottom, opens 
it by spreading the 
handles as one would to gather air into a billows, and then 
closing them on the clams. 
In tonging, the bay bottom is 
less 
radically disturbed than 
in raking, 
in part because the clams lie 
nearer the surface of the bay bottom and can be reached without 
digging. 
When the tonger closes on a clam, he can feel the 
vibrations in the handle. 
After a while, the tongs are lifted 
out of the water, and the same process goes on as 
in raking, of 
sorting, etc. 
Then the process is repeated. 
All 
of us tried our 
respective hand at tonging, with varying degrees of success. I 
did bring up a few clams, however, but it took me a while to get 
the hang of it. 
Marilyn brought a starfish up from the bottom 
and Kenny explained that the starfish feed on clams, and eat more 
of them than people do. 
He didn't throw the starfish back, and 
comments were made about not giving the competition a break. 
While we were tonging, I think, I asked about the other 
method of clamming, known as tredding. 
Kenny laughed and grunted 
a bit, then explained that "those guys are crazy", adding that 
treading was done by wading out into the water, 
into the surf, 
and feeling the clams with your feet, then "dipping", or going 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 43 
under water for them. 
According to Kenny, treaders are "crazy" 
because they do that in 
all weather, right through the winter, 
and the best treading occurs in water that is up to the chin of a 
six foot tall clammer. 
Kenny added that some treaders use what 
he called "scratchin rakes" to scratch for clams and to bring 
them up without having to dip for them, but many do not, 
it being 
faster and more efficient, and therefore more productive, to 
tread without the rakes. 
Kenny said that he has tried that, but 
in summer, and that he didn't do too well, nor enjoy the 
experience too much. 
He prefers raking to all other methods of 
clamming. 
We tonged for about forty—five minutes, and then decided to 
go 
in, 
it being after noon and our having other appointments to 
keep. 
Throughout, I tried to put questions to Kenny, but the 
newspaper people had their own questions to ask, and I felt that 
they should have free access to Kenny, since the story would 
focus on the "informants" and not the field worker. 
However, I 
had planned this day as a fieldwork day, and I was unable to 
accomplish much, at least not much in the area of 
interview or 
follow—up questions, so I'll 
have to make a trip to see Kenny at 
some later date 
in order to obtain more information. 
As noted 
above, I am especially interested in navigating and mapping 
activities on the bay, and will perhaps pursue these later. 
After we got back to the dock, Kenny gave us a bag with 
about four dozen clams 
in 
it and told us to divide them up 
between us. 
I might also add that Kenny is generous with his 
time as well--he took a day off from his regular job 
in order to 
take us out on the bay. 
Thank you, Kenny! 
TX02: The reporter, photographer and I decided to have lunch 
before going down to Manahawkin to see Ed Hazelton. 
We did so, 
and talked a bit about the project and our recent mutual 
experience on the bay. 
And it 
is here that I must register my 
reservations, for both Marilyn and Bob pressed me about "Pineys", 
reclusive, backward, woodsy types whom they imagined, according 
to the unfortunate stereotype, comprised a large part of the 
population of the Pine Barrens. 
I tried to disabuse them of this 
notion. 
I suggested that, at least for the purposes of 
investigation, 
it was counter—productive to operate from such a 
premise, and that in fact no amount of 
investigation, however 
prodigious or persistent, would confirm that stereotype. 
The so— 
called "pineys", I suggested, didn't really exist as a group. 
However, despite my efforts, they persisted in this line of 
questioning, and I got the idea that the stereotype would remain, 
and would perhaps find its way into the article. 
This remains to 
be seen, but I must quickly add here that these people were 
neither malicious nor especially thick—headed. 
They had simply 
gotten hold of an 
idea that was hard to shake. 
TX03: After lunch, we drove in separate cars south on Route 3 
into G—Manahawkin; 56GT. 
Ed Hazelton was waiting for us when we 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 44 
arrived. 
He was sitting in a sort of sitting room off the house 
proper. 
At the end furthest from the door through which we 
entered, there was a small table, on which a group of about 
twenty decoys were distributed. 
There were several sitting 
chairs nearby, one of which was occupied by Ed, current issue of 
Field and Stream in hand. 
Above the table, on a shelf against 
the wall, were more decoys. 
In a corner, there was another 
shelf, or shelves, on which were arranges, 
in neat rows, several 
dozen nineteenth century carpenter's planes. 
Ed later explained 
that old planes were a special 
interest of his, perhaps arising 
out of his profession, that of carpenter, from which he has been 
retired for the past seven years or so. 
My attention was immediately focuses on a canvas decoy, 
which Ed explained was from Long Island. 
It was a Canada Goose, 
larger than most wooden goose decoys, and made of a wooden frame 
over which canvas had been stretched and later painted to conform 
with a goose's coloration. 
Marilyn took several pictures of this 
decoy, as well as of other decoys on the table near us. 
We 
talked in general terms about this decoy, specifically its 
construction and provenience, and about another decoy from New 
York State. 
This was a solid body decoy, species black duck, 
that was really very nice aesthetically. 
Ed guessed that it was 
carved about 1300, and as I admired it, said that he had been 
offered four hundred dollars for it. 
That was an 
interesting 
comment, because it seems that the subject of money, or monetary 
value, crops up a lot in talk about decoys today, and that the 
subject of value forecloses 
on conversation about the birds 
themselves. 
Monetary value provides a kind of shorthand in 
conversations about decoys, even among people who are not 
collectors, who may, or may not, be 
in 
it for the money, which is 
sometimes considerable. 
Ed's tone was bemused as he raised the 
issue of value, as 
if to say that these birds were bought and 
sold for a fraction of four hundred dollars when he was young and 
decoys were used for hunting only, but he raised the issue 
nevertheless. 
This problem of the subject of monetary value as 
foreclosure is an 
interesting one, one which I will pursue 
further at a later date. 
We continued to talk about decoys for a while. 
Ed told the 
story of how he got started carving, because he has been carving 
since his retirement from the building trades five or six years 
ago. 
(For a version of this story, see PFP83—RTC004.) 
At this 
point, the reporter and photographer were putting most of the 
questions to Ed. 
They asked about sneakboxes, what they were and 
how they were used, and Ed described the boat and its use 
in 
hunting. 
In brief, Ed's description went something like this: 
The hunter loads his sneakbox with ammunition and decoys, which 
are placed on racks 
in the rear of the boat. 
He then proceeds 
out to the meadows, to the spot where he plans to hunt that day. 
He chooses a good location, and cuts a v—shaped notch into the 
bank of an 
island and pulls the boat up 
into 
it. 
He then covers 
the boat with reeds and other local vegetation, and "snuggles 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes 
page 45 
down" inside the boat and awaits the arrival of ducks. 
As the 
ducks pass overhead, or fly nearby to check out the decoys, the 
hunter sits up 
in the boat and shoots. 
He retrieves the ducks he 
has hit, and the process begins over again. 
The reporter was also interested 
in the boat models that Ed 
makes, and the subject of sneakboxes was a natural 
lead—in to 
this topic. 
Ed went into his living room and returned with a 
boat model, and pointed out the essential features of the 
sneakbox with reference to the model. 
He described the two basic 
styles of sneakbox, one with rounded bow, and the other with flat 
bow. 
I believe that this difference is a regional one, and that 
in Manahawkin and environs, the hunters prefer the rounded, or 
curved bow. 
By rounded or curved, I mean that the bow section 
is 
slightly humped. 
I took this opportunity to ask Ed what wood was used 
in the 
construction of model sneakboxes. 
Ed said that it was Jersey 
white cedar, so I asked him 
why cedar? 
Since it was a model not 
intended for use, wouldn't another wood do as well? 
Ed scoffed 
mildly and good naturedly at this suggestion, and said that a 
wood other than cedar was unthinkable. He said that white cedar 
was "our wood" around here, and something to the effect that "We 
live and breathe cedar around here." 
He added that I might as 
well 
ask why he takes a drink of water, or why he wears shoes 
when he goes outside as ask why he uses cedar in his boat models. 
I asked Ed 
if he would describe the special qualities of cedar, 
white cedar, for the reporters, and he did so, touching upon its 
lightness, 
its adaptability to carving, 
its durability, 
especially in water, etc. 
At this point, the subject turned once again to decoys, and 
specifically to Ed's own carving, and he 
invited us inside to 
look at some more of his work. 
We did so, and spent about 
fifteen minutes in his living room looking at decoys and at other 
boat models. 
The reporter then suggested that we go out and look 
at his workshop, and Ed readily agreed. 
Before I go 
into that, 
however, I would mention that a line of questioning that the 
reporter, and to some extent the photographer, persisted with had 
to do with what Ed did for a living. 
They kept asking if he was 
a carver, a hunting guide, etc., that is, they were interested to 
know if 
he was a "traditional" character, or at least employed in 
a traditional activity or set of activities that conform to a 
stereotype. 
I sensed, and I could certainly be wrong here, that 
they were disappointed when Ed made it clear that he had been a 
builder up until the time that he retired, and that he had hunted 
and fooled around with sneakboxes only on the side, as a 
recreational activity. 
I do not mean to suggest here that his 
participation in these activities was somehow flippant, or 
uninvolved, but rather that Ed does not conform to that kind of 
stereotype. 
On the other hand, this activity, this involvement 
with decoys and hunting and sneakboxes is, I think, a 
manifestation of a very deep involvement in a life style that is 
Carroll-83 Fieldnotes

specific to the bay area. 
thing that the reporters 
of . 
I must add one more thing 
At a certain point in the 
actually several small 
di 
named Rube Corliss had said to him that carving is easy, that 
every piece of wood has something in 
it, 
and the carver's job is 
simply to get it out. 
He said that this carver would put his 
hand on a piece of wood and say what kind of bird could be out 
from it. 
I mean to pursu

I have heard this 
it 
is a standard means of 
the carver, but I have ne

And si

Actually,

before we go out to the workshop.

idea before,

in this 
forming part of a narrative about a 
such a statement, but nothing definite 
As we walked out to the shed we talked a bit about the 
property on which Ed's house stood. 
Ed pointed to the area where 
his kennels are, the area where he keeps both his own dogs and 
the dogs he 
is raising and training as hunting dogs. 
We arrived 
at the workshop, which was attached to the garage, and stepped 
inside. 
It was rectangular, and we entered through one of the 
narrow sides and looked down the length of the shop. 
The room 
measured about eight feet by twenty feet. 
The actual work area 
was along the wall on the right. 
Ed pointed out a spokeshave, 
which he had mentioned while we were in the house, and some other 
tools used 
in carving. 
There was a band saw nearby, and Ed 
explained that he cuts the pattern out on this piece of 
equipment. 
The pattern provides the rough shape of the duck's 
body. 
I ask Ed what patterns he uses, and he pointed to some 
that were hanging on the walls. 
Most of them had been taken from 
other, more well—known carvers, such as Rube Corliss and Hurley 
Conklin. 
Ed also had some patterns that he had gotten from the 
pattern book put out by Harry V. Shourds of Seaville, NJ and 
Anthony Hillman. 
There were some decoys in various stages of completion, as 
well 
as a model sneakbox that Ed had just begun working on. 
Ed 
said that this model was intended for his granddaughter. 
I have 
talked to several people now who say that they have made models 
for either their grandchildren, their sons or daughters, etc. 
The important point seems to be that these are made by members of 
an older generation for members of a younger one. 
Hurley 
Conklin, for example, made model sneakboxes for his daughters, as 
Carroll—$3 Fieldnotes 
page 47 
well 
as one for Ed Hazelton's son. 
Ed has made decoys and now a 
sneakbox for his son's children. 
This may also be something that 
would merit further investigation, but more work is needed before 
it can be singled out for deeper study. 
The reporters seemed restless at this point, and seemed to 
want to end the interview. 
We had only been in the workshop for 
a few minutes, but I believe that they wanted to get up to the 
project headquarters and talk to the fieldworkers there to get a 
more general sense of what has been learned about the area. 
Ed 
kept pointing out things in the shop, however, such as an old 
wooden vise that was attached to the side of his worktable. 
As 
he pointed this out, the photographer noticed a decoy that was 
near completion, and asked if she could take some pictures of Ed 
working on 
it. 
He agreed, and set it up 
in the vise, took a 
rasp, and began to file lightly. 
She snapped a series of 
pictures as he worked, and when she finished, 
it was apparent 
that it was time to go. 
In terms of fieldwork as 
it 
is usually 
conducted, this was a very light day for me, much of 
it given 
over to the reporters' agenda. 
Our visit with Ed seemed 
especially scant, but I was able to formulate several questions 
for later interviews.
