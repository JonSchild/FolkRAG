DELEHANTY & HENGLER. 
It is not surprising that Messrs. Delehanty & Hengler are se 
well appreciated and received by the public when you take into 
consideration that they have made their line of entertainments 
a 
profound study when they were only 10 and 12 years old; 
and while they were being educated by their parents for a 
higher sphere in life, at the Bobolink high school in Albany, 
N. Y., and serving upon the altar of the Catholic Cathedral in 
that city, they are undoubtedly the originators of all the songs, 
both music and words, sketches, characterizations, etc., of 
which they Impersonate. 
Both of these young gentlemen are 
built solid, wiry, and as elastic as a 
rubber ball; their personal 
appearance would be marked in any crowd. 
As men possessed 
of culture and refinement in private life, they are noted for 
their sociability, and of possessing a 
liberal degree of conver-
sational power, humor, story-telling, etc. 
Their latest novelty 
is entitled LAUGH AND BE .MERRY, presenting several new 
characters. 
A criticism of which, as taken from the Boston 
Herald: 
" 
Messrs. Delehanty & Hengler appeared last evening at the 
Howard Atheneum ill LAUGH AND BE MERRY, which was en-
tirely new throughout. 
T. M. Hengler was very entertaining 
as the " Lady Killer" in a 
drawing-room, representing one of 
those vain, conceited sweet fellows, which are so often seen 
among the higher circles, private parties, etc. 
His silly and 
nonsensical conversation to an imaginary lady, is truly an artis-
tic and natural creation, being as he did not over- draw nor rid-
icule any of the peculiarities of those charming swells. 
This - 
was followed by W. H. Delehanty as Terry O'Brien, which was 
well impersonated. His stories were new and humorously ren-
dered, keeping the audience in continuous laughter. 
Mr. Hen-
gler again appeared as " A Fine Looking Solid Old Farmer," 
with a 
moralizing song— To Bless the Old Alan's Heart—which 
was both instructive and pleasing. 
Then Mr. Delehanty ap-
peared in the character of " A 
Dizzy Serio-Comic Lady Vocal-
ist," with an appropriate song. " Oh Give me Back the One I 
Love, and Take Away the One I 
Hate," which was, by-the-by, 
a 
good take-off on some of our lady serio-comic singers we so 
often hear. 
Then came their ever- welcome rival dandy darkey 
songs, dances, etc., which are too well known as an artistic per-
formance to need any comment. 
This performance from be-
ginning to end is the most varied, contrasting and meritori-
ous sketch performance ever witnessed in this city." 
Words and Music composed by T. M. 
HENGLER. 
When a 
boy at school, I 
improved each hour, 
And wrought and strove from morn till night, 
So little by little increased my store, 
And found my prospects getting quite bright. 
(Sym) 
At last I 
bought a 
stock and farm, 
Successful was, got a 
wife and home, 
Then I 
began to feel home's charm, 
And vowed no more again I'd roam. 
(Sym) 
CHORUS. 
My wants are small, my farm is large, 
I 
bid my cares depart. 
I've a 
happy wife and children three, 
To bless the old man's heart. 
[Repeat chorus.] 
Youth, they say, will have it's fling, 
And social joys we love to share; 
But let prudence always be the thing 
To keep the morrow free from care, 
And to be healthy, wealthy and wise, 
Remember, if translated right, 
Is early to bed and early to rise, 
And don't stay out too late at night. 
(Sym) 
My wants are small, etc. 
Of trouble each man gets his share, 
And to avoid it we should try— • 
Endeavor to make the least of care, 
And lose no time in such employ, 
Now you young folks keep this in mind, 
Aim for success and noble ends, 
And when you're old, then both combined 
Will bring you bliss and faithful friends. 
(Sym) 
(Sym) 
My wants are small, etc: 
Words and music by the same author—W. H. DELEHANTY. 
You will please to give me your attention, 
For just a 
little while ; 
Until I 
with pleasure mention her, 
" 
The Belle of Amberisle." 
She's the neatest and the sweetest maiden 
My heart could ever choose, 
And if I 
now sing and dance with joy 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, when I 
hear the music play 
I 
feel so happy I 
could throw mycelf away; 
Yes, I 
feel so good I 
can't keep from singing, 
My joy it is profuse, 
And the heeltaps will keep ringing, but, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
I 
shall ne'er forget the moonlight picnic 
They gave at " Amberisle;" 
How the pleasures were ecstatic for 
The best of " bon ton" style. 
It was there I 
met my heart's best treasure, 
" 
Sweet idol of my muse," 
And when I 
asked to 'see her home 
She said " I 
can't refuse." 
Just the other day I 
popped the question, 
She said " I 
can't decline," 
So a 
cottage on the Hudson banks 
Will be her home and mine. 
We invite you all to call and see us, 
And hope you won't refuse; 
And if kindness fails to greet you there, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
Oh, when I 
hear, etc. 
Words and music by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
W HEN I 
landed in New York, 
All the way from Cushaloch, 
Where the black birds sung their notes of lamentation 
in every little lay, 
Sure I 
thought I 
heard them say 
May good luck attend you. Pat, in every station. 
When I 
landed in New York 
Sure I 
thought that I'd get work, 
But I 
found that was a 
matter rather hard, so 
I 
must emigrate out west; 
There I 
think I'll do the best 
When I 
meet my sister Katie in Chicago. 
CHORUS• 
In Chicago, in the State of Illinois; 
But before I 
say adieu 
I 
will take a 
step or two 
Just as graceful as a 
little lustiardo. 
So blaze away and tear, 
Now the divil a 
hair I 
care, 
For I'm going to meet my sister in Chicago. 
Down at Castle Garden gate, 
Sure it's there I 
had to wait, 
Now I 
know ye's all will say it was a 
pity; 
The divil a 
one I 
found 
Who would show a 
Paddy round, 
So you see I'm led astray now in your city. 
And no matter where I 
be, 
All the boys make game of me, • 
And they holler pipe the tarrier Bernardo; 
With their cry, ' What d'ye saoy I" 
Faith me heart knows little joy, 
Till I 
meet my sister Katie in Chicago. 
In Chicago, etc. 
Soldiers gallant and gay, 
Gallant and gay, gallant and gay

At our elegant style 
Elegant style and way. 
When we are out on the march,

Out on the march, yes, out on the march, 
Officers stiffened as starch, 
In the elegant Ebony Guards. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, we look grand, 
As we march along the street, 
The ladies smile, 
And wave their handkerchiefs. 
The men admire, 
And say we look so neat, 
Colonel and major, 
Of the elegant Ebony Guards.

Hannah! Hannah! Won't You Be My Bride? 
Written and composed by W. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
BOY.—Don't you see my little love, 
Isn't she a 
turtledove? 
Smiling, beguiling, happy all the day; 
You can see the sunny South 
In her great big codfish mouth; 
Hannah, Hannah, don't you run away. 
Gum.—No, indeed, goody John, 
I 
will stick when all are gone; 
You can bet your life upon 
livery word I 
say. 
Boy.—Hannah makes me feel so queer, 
I 
could dance upon my ear, 
When I 
know she's standing by by side; 
Come and kiss me ere I 
die, 
Hit me with a 
custard pie, 
Hannah, Hannah, won't you be my bride? 
CHORL'S.—Duet 
Take me where the sunbeams linger, 
Near the Mississippi tide; 
Place the ring upon my finger, 
Hannah, Hannah, then will be your bride. 
BOY.—Oh, give me wings and let me fly, 
Let me go up in the sky. 
Hannah, oh, Hannah, you stole my heart away; 
Oh, come and take me out of pain. 
Give me back my heart again, 
Hannah, oh, Hannah, hear me what I 
say. 
GIRL—I 
would, dear John, that's if I 
could, 
Because I 
know I 
really should; 
A. man with a 
heart's no good, 
Now this is understood. 
Bo.—Oh, keep it, Hannah, all your life, 
Say you'll be my darling wife, 
Then I'll be happy as the world is wide 
When I 
know I've got your heart, 
We shall never, never part; 
Hannah. Hannah, won't you be my bride ? 
ERIN'S EMBLEMS. 
Written and Composed by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
I 
wear two lovely emblems, 
United on my breast, 
The honored " Harp ef Erin," 
That land I 
love the best. 
A 
darling treasured " Shamrock," 
So modest to be seen. 
That Harp that shines with glory, 
The Shamrock so fair and green. 
Cuoitus. 
My blessings on those emblems 
Of Erin across the sea. 
May they adorn the banners 
Proclaiming Ireland free. 
The reason why I 
wear them, 
So closely to my heart, 
Those gems of priceless treasure, 
United never to part, 
Because that little Shamrock, 
Was fair and pure to see, 
The Harp was like the utterings, 
Of mother love to 
My blessing on those, etc. 
My mother wrought that gold harp, 
With tresses of her hair; 
Green threads of father's jacket. 
Did make a 
Shamrock fair. 
My father kissed and blessed me 
Before I 
crossed the sea, 
And bade me wear those emblems, 
" 
For mother dear and me." 
Sung with DELEHANTY & HENGLER'S COMPANY. 
Oh my Jamie, Oh my Jamie, 
Bide the time a 
wee; 
Surely lanes must have their turning, 
Ere the travelers dee. 
Bide the time wi patience, Janne, 
Looking to the sky, 
Waiting like my love waits, Jamie, 
Till the clouds go by. 
Waiting like my love waits, Jamie, 
Till the clouds go by. 
CHORUS. 
Night always precedes morning, 
Hope springs from a 
sigh; 
Wait my darling, wait, my Jamie 
Till the clouds go by. 
Wait my darling, wait, my Jamie 
Till the clouds go by. 
Oh my Jamie, Oh my Jamie, 
Time goes quickly by; 
Grief must have its end, my Jamie, 
Sure as moments fly. 
In thy arms thous't held me, Jamie, 
Oft when dread was nigh, 
Lean thou on my love now, Jamie, 
Till the clouds go by. 
Lean thou on my love now, Jamie, 
Till the clouds go by. 
Night always precedes morning, etc.

BEAUTIFUL PINK AND WHITE' ROSES, 
Words and music written by W . 
II. 
DELEHANTY. 
As the merry birds that warble in the trees, 
Or the wild flowers that scent the summer breeze, 
As I 
wander here and there, without a 
thought of care, 
My happiness does every hour increase. 
How sweet Cc love and be loved in return, 
When modest maiden cheeks begin to burn, 
And eyes of diamond light outshine the glare at night 
To wake from blissful dreams at early dawn. 
Oh dear! the tender passion love, 
How beautiful bewildering you seem I 
Like a 
boon descending from above, 
Elisium the rapture of a 
dream. 
Ohl brizlit and merry pass the hours away, 
And ti m 
c 
but makes the moments glad and gay, 
As I 
wander through the grove to sing of her I 
lore, 
And like the birds I 
carrol forth my lay. 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful pink and white roses, 
Culled from a 
garden of posies. 
Lovely verdant gem so rich and rare, 
How sweetly you deck my darling's hair; 
You linger in my mind as something good and kind, 
Because you make my darling twice as fair. 
There's an ivy-covered cottage in the lane 
With its rustic little portico so plain ; 
A charming little spot, a 
lovely garden plot 
Where every kind of flowers bloom amain; 
But the pride of all the garden is the rose 
Which here and there in great profusion grows, 
The lovely violet and fragrant mignonett', 
There is none of them such beauty can disclose; 
But fairer far is Flora's face to,see, 
It pierced me into my very soul 
The day she pulled those pretty flowers for me 
And pinned them in my button-hole. 
Oh! since that time I 
placed them in my 
book, 
Where now and then my eyes with rapture look; 
They make my heart rejoice to know they were her choice, 
The roses pink and white from her I 
took. 
Beautiful pink and white roses, etc.

STRAWBERRIES AND CREAK 
A 
LAWRY DAWDY FELLOW, 
Composed and written by W. H. DELEHANTT. 
Milk and honey, Oh! its funny— 
I 
cannot keep from dancing; 
For I 
love a 
girl—she's a 
pretty pearl— 
A 
lovely belle supreme— 
She's a 
lolly-pop—sweet forget-me-not— 
And her voice is so entrancing, 
She's my honeycomb, she's my sugar-plum, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Yes, she's a 
basket full of fruit, 
She's my pretty love, she's my turtle dove. 
Her voice is like the music of a 
flute, 
And she's just sweet sixteen. 
CHORUS. 
Milk, honey, strawberries and cream (
sum.), 
Like the music of a 
happy dream (sym.). 
She's a 
darling 1 
she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
lovely plate of peaches, 
She's a 
dandy—'lasses candy— 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Repeat Chorus. 
I'm enraptured, I 
am captured, 
By a 
lovely lump of sweetness. 
She's an oyster pie, she's a 
chicken pie, 
And she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's a 
lemonade, 
And the pink of perfect neatness. 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grapes, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Oh! yes, she's far too sweet to live, 
Is this lolly pop, is this candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I 
would grieve— 
sweet vision of ray dream.

Characteristic of a 
Lady Killer. 
Words and Music by T. M. HENGLER. 
Copyright, 1877, A. J. FisHER., 98 Nassau Street. 
I'm a 
charming, captivating, fascinating fellow. 
Where ere I

Oh, isn't he a 
swell, 0'. 
They pet, and treat me tenderly, 
And call me lady killer,

In the mazy waltz, the polka too, 
Titey sigh to be my partner. 
I'm the ladies, et4 
By HARRY BENNETT. 
I AM fond of courting, also of sporting, 
I 
often go courting the girl I 
adore; 
Her hair she does crimple, her cheek has a 
dimple, 
Her nose has a 
pimple five days out of four; 
Her first name is Mary, her last name is Cary ; 
She never gets airy, the dear little sprite; 
She's pretty, she's witty, the belle of the city, 
And walks like a 
kitty, with step prim and light. 
CHORUS. 
Have you seen Mary, light as a 
fairy? 
Never contrary, sings like .a 
canary 
From old Tipperary; she works in a 
dry, 
And never gets weary, my sweet Mary Ann. 
Her voice is soprano, she plays the piano, 
The " Star-Spangled l3anner" is the song she sings 
Her style would amaze ye and set ye all crazy, 
With the songs of this daisy the neighborhood rings ; 
Her appearance is dashing, she dresses in fashion, 
She's the darling for mashing the boys ey'rywhere. 
We're soon to be married, too long we have tarried; 
Four years she has carried a 
lock of my hair. 
Have you seen Mary ? etc. 
TOSS THE TURK. 
Words written, and Music Adapted by Tom CANNolz.

Prince St., N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
Oh 1 
one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug-hat and all; 
And I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernia Hall. 
Going round a 
corner, a 
gang of rowdies: 
Oh! I 
know they're rowdies for they never work, 
Says, let give this ould Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
pic-nic, boys, and toss the Turk. 
CliORUS. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter. 
But when duty calls me I 
never shirk; 
So I'll tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no pie-nie when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh the big ring-leader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien you had better paint the ' tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it!" 
And he thought 'twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk: 
-So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no pie-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Now I'm not, etc. 
Oh! they gatherld round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall; 
You can't go behind me, says I, now mind me, 
If you stand forenint me I 
can bate ye all. 
Ther-the gang did face me and thought to lace me, 
But I 
showed them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mercy they lrgan to bawl. 
Spoken after 3d verse.--' Well, they looked surprised, and 
'Red Handed Mike' says, Who are you?' 
Well, says I, my 
name is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, and, 
moreover," 
I'm not, em

THE WATERIIIILL. 
As recited by Gus W ILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And ..,he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to- morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Ohl the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Ohl the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh I 
love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The miff win never grind with the water that is past.

MCSWEGAN.—Well, I 
have just come into town to meet an 
old friend of mine from the same place in Ireland as myself: 
but he has risen in the world and keeps a 
lager beer brewery 
in Keokuk, Iowa. 
I 
don't see him, so I 
will step down to McNal-
ly's saloon. 
Probably he will come along while I 
am gone. 
Enter CROSSIN. 
CROSSIN.—I wonder where McSwegan is. 
He promised to 
meet me here. 
As I 
was coining around the corner a 
little girl 
looked at me in the face and says, " There's General Grant." 
I 
looked around and says, " You lie, sis," but I 
don't think she 
seen the point.

DORKINS THE ACTOR. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sung with great slums by 
W ILL. H. 
MORTON, With HARRIGAN & HART'S Combicintiorl, 
(Hew version) 
The theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to play, 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began, each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful Hi, Hi! 
He soon appeared amidst loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see: 
Why Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night, 
The people said sitting around me. 
A 
hiss? yes, it was I 
saw Dorkins start, 
As though stung by a 
serpent's fang, 
Then he cast a 
beseeching look all around, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
Some said he was drank, and I 
thought so myself, 
For to me it was awful at times. 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
At last he the footlights then slowly approached, 
And ladies and gentlemen said, 
Believe me, if I 
cannot please you to- night, , 
The faults not the heart but the head; 
Many a 
time I 
made you all laugh, 
When I 
was scarce able to stand, 
And every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk; 
From his breast came a 
sob and a 
moan, 
When I 
tell you the reason, I 
know you won't laugh, 
I've a 
little one dying at home. 
Sung with great success by the Duncan Sisters, CARRIE AND 
SOPHIE.

Jun' for a 
change I 
thought I'd go 
To the seaside out of town, 
To battle each morning in the surf 
Then wander up and down. 
While strolling there on one fine day 
I 
met a 
charming beau; 
He asked me if I'd walk with him? 
Of course I'd not say no—for 
CHORUS. 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now don't you think it is so? 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now that's what they exclaim. 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now don't you think so" 
Everybody says so, 
And of course we say the same. 
Then arm in arm along the beach 
For hours we did roam. 
He whispered tales of love 
As we returned towards home. 
He begged to see me to my door. 
I 
answered " No, my dear, 
But to- night at seven, if you'll wait, 
I'll meet you on the pier." 
It's nice, etc. 
We met that night and then I 
found 
How dearly lie loved me; 
And now I'm soon to be his wife, 
how happy I 
will be. 
He whispered tales of love, and said 
" 
Don't be so timid, Miss, 
And now my little darling please 
Give me one little kiss." 
SroirEN.—Of course, as we were engaged to be married, 
coulthet refuse a 
kiss; and besides— 
We nice, etc.

! 
Kittie, you're so lovely 
To night, I 
came to see 
Your face, divinely pretty, 
A 
smiling down on me; 
In visions, dear, you cheer me, 
Where'er I 
chance to stray ; 
If sleeping, dream of me, love, 
Before I 
go away. 
CHORUS. 
Good Night! Good Night! 
Sweet dreams, my love! 
Good Night! 
Good Night! Good Night! 
Sweet dreams, my love! 
Good Night! 
My pretty little Kittle, the dearest one to me, 
The fairest and the only one I 
love ; 
Every Eve we sit together, 
'Neath the Sycamore tree, 
'Neath the nest of a 
pretty little dove, 
She sings to me so sweetly. 
The songs I 
love to hear, 
The music and the words. I 
know them well 
She charms me so completely, 
When she finishes each verse 
I 
kiss her, and tell her not to tell. 
Good Night! Ate. 
She's my pretty little Kittie. 
And my little flower of joy. 
I'm as joyful as the birds 
That warble in the trees ; 
My bliss, like theirs, without alloy; 
When our wedding-day is over, 
I'll live among the clover, 
With this pretty little flower of joy. 
Away with all your Belles, 
None with mine can compare; 
My Kittie—my love—my life— 
The Queen of all the fair! 
Away with all your Belles, 
None with mine can compare ; 
My Kittie—my love—my life— 
The Queen of all the fair! 
[SPIV) 
[Sympl 
It fills me with delight, on a 
full moon starry night 
To walk with my pretty Kittie dear ; 
And vow to her such love as only lover's might, 
To the one whom they dearly revere. 
Last evening we were walking 
Where the moon did brightly shine. 
I 
asked her, there, to be my own dear wife; 
She answered, yes, so sweetly, 
'Nea,th blushes fair and rosy— 
Our happiness shall ever be most rife,

He gave me a 
pretty red rose, 
While rambling to-night o'er the lea, 
And said as he kissed me good-bye, 
Wear this in your breast love for me. 
'Tis fading and falling apart, 
But close to my heart it will cling, 
While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye, 
Of my pretty red rose I 
will sing. 
CHORUS. 
My pretty red rose, my pretty red rose, 
'Tis a 
sweet little token, my pretty red rose, 
While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye, 
I'll sing of my pretty red rose. 
'Tis a 
dear little mem'ry of love, 
How sad that it soon must decay, 
But fondly I'll treasure its leaves, 
Though their beauty may vanish awa. 
Sweet moments of joy it recalls, 
And lulls every sigh to repose ; 
Tho' now we're apart still my true lover's heart 
Seems to dwell in my pretty red rose.

Through the mazy dance; 
Half exposing, and half hiding, 
Charms that all entrance.

Merry, laughing Cherry Norine, 
Sweetest darling Cherry Norine; 
Blue eyed beauty, sweetly dreaming, 
Golden hair so softly streaming, 
My heart's enchained with love. 
Form of fairy, winsome, airy, 
Movements of a 
sprite; 
Brighter gem than decks the starry 
Diadem of night; 
Rose tints wreathing, perfume breathing, 
Cheeks and ruby lips; 
Chains of love unconscious weaving, 
Where'er her footstep trips. 
Merry, laughing, &c. 
What the measure ? Gods would treasure 
Such transcendent bliss; 
Oh the deep, enchanting pleasure— 
One ecstatic kiss! 
Still to love her, still to hover 
Near her, and to gaze 
Into orbs whose liquid lustre 
Brightens all one's days.

TEMPERANCE SPEECH, 
A BURLESQUE ON JOHN B. GOUGH'S SPEECH. 
Delivered by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
viii now make a few remarks on demperance. I 
am no 
drinking man, never having drank a 
drop of liquor in my life— 
dot I 
paid for. 
I 
am no orator, but shall try to represend dot 
gread demperance orator, John B. Gough, a 
man whorr I've ol-
den been daken for. 
Should I 
possess the eloquenc, of Gen-
eral Grant, I 
could give more scope to de subject I 
am now 
aboild to wrestle mit. 
Demperanee is an old und veil vorn sub,leet, but like a 
Keno 
box ve can shake it ub, und get anoder number. 
It's very hard to approach a 
man vat ain't a- drinking; you're 
apt tD be met with—" Who tole you I 
vasn't drinking ?"— 
" 
You mind your business, nnd I'll mind yours."—" Come und 
take a 
ball," und oder veil-known expressions used by politi-
cians. 
I 
vas called upon yonce to see vone of de hardest cases of 
demperance it has ever been my good fortune to vitness. 
A 
man, who yen drunk vos de kindest of husbands; but ven sober 
he vos a 
perfect devil. 
I 
vent to de house, a 
beautiful brown 
curb- stone front, knocked de door down, und vent in. 
De man 
vos dere. 
I 
said to him—" Vill you please give me a 
drink of 
vater ?"—(de firsd dime lever dook vater in my life.) 
He said, 
" 
Yes, sir; have a 
seat," pointing to a 
red-hot sdove. I 
de-
clined to sit, for various reasons. 
I 
spoke to him aboud Tnfla-
dion, Seven Oud, but I 
avoidell de subject of demperance. 
At 
last I 
said, " You have a 
vife, I 
believe ?" 
He replied, " Yes, 
sir; de fifth one; red-headed." 
I 
said, " You love your vile, 
don't you?" He said, " Vell, id's unnatural for a man to love 
his vife now-a-days." I 
said, " Don'd you dink of you vould 
sign dis paper, und go und get full vid me to-night, you could 
come home, get a 
club, und have a 
good deal of fun around de 
house?" 
He said, " Yes, I 
suppose so." 
I 
said, " You'll do 
id?" 
He said, " 1 
vill." 
I 
pulled oud a 
coby of " Good-Look-
ing Snow," I 
laid id on de dable; he placed his nose in the ink. 
bottle, und wrote his name. 
Just den a 
voice came from anoder room—(full of emodion 
und beer)—" Luke Gerloot!" 
De man said, " Come in mit me, 
Mr. Whooping-cough." I 
vent in dere, und his vife VOS laying 
on a 
bed, she vos dead—drunk. 
He knelt down und printed a 
kiss on her forehead in large types. 
She took his foot in her 
hand, looked up, und said, " Oh! Luke is such a 
good husband 
yen he's drunk, but yen sober, he's N. G!" (de first time I 
ever 
knew she spoke Latin.) 
Be man said, " She says I 
am good!" 
at de same time pulling down de neck of his shirt, he showed 
me a 
second-hand scar. 
I 
said, " Vero you vaccinated dere ?" 
His vife said, " I 
cannot tell a 
lie, I 
done it mit a 
little hatchet." 
Of my lips had been dry yen I 
came in dere, I 
assure you dey 
vere vet den, for I 
alvays carry de stuff mit me. 
But dis is 
only vone case oud of dwo hundred und fordy-dree und a 
half,

have carried my good vork; I 
intend to carry id all over 
de cidy, so dot Yen I 
returnI shall see a 
monumend erected to 
me, made oud of dot kind of marble dot looks like castile-soap. 
Of dere is any bresent to-night dot vould like to help rue in my

VIOLETS DIPPED IN DEW 
Words and Music by W. H. Ihr.rmusirri 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The Sun had just gone dowx, 
While leisurely meandering 
A 
little way from town; 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue, 
Beneath her dark eye-lashes, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
Cnonus. 
A 
smile was all she gave me . (Symph.) 
But how it did enslave me, 
'Twas love, the first I 
knew; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing 
Within her eyes so blue, 
dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
.1 wil,Aved on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handktrchief it fell; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one co,w_r there I 
found,. 
I 
saw the crowd was gathering 'round 
A 
something prostrate on the ground, 
And thought, what can it be? 
While moving nearer to the spot, 
Like others, anxious to know what 
Was there so great to see. 
When lo a 
maiden, young and fair, 
With violet eyes and golden hair, 
A 
face serene and sweet, 
Unsheltered from the Summer's sun, 
Lay prostrate there upon the stone, 
In garment plain but neat. 
Ah! pitty awed, I 
viewed her there 
Coldly sweet and deadly fair— 
Somebody's darling daughter. 
And musing—was it fit or faint? 
Dead was she to all complaint. 
They bathed her head with water, 
Ai last, and now the Doctor came. 
One look he gave and muttered shame. 
My heart with pity sauk— 
And wistfully he turned Away. 
I 
guessed it all—he need not say, 
She's dead !— said he—dead drunk

HOPE I 
DON'T INTRUDE, 
Written by W, H. DELEHANTY. 
Performed by DELEHANTY & FiEN61.1g1. 
I'm as happy as the day is long, 
My mind is never easy, 
No matter wLether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude. 
For love it is the burden of my song, 
With joy I'm almost crazy; 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude, 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude.

Oh, dear, don't you wish that you was me, 
I 
feel just as happy as a

I 
was walking by her door, 
When I 
heard the music sweet, 
And my heart with joy tilled over, 
I 
couldn't keep my- 
feet. 
So keep the music ringing, 
For it makes me feel so good; 
And if, perghance, I 
sing or dance, 
You inusl not think me rude. 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I

At a

Myself and little Daisy, 
We kept it up till broad daylight, 
We felt so awful good. 
Oh, Daisy looked so fair and bright, 
She set the men all crazy; 
And if they asked her tor to dance, 
She'd ask me 1: she could, 
And then I'd say in E careloqs way— 
hope I 
intrude. 
Oh, dear, etc. 
As sung by T. M. TifztoLrat. 
In the pleasant Summer evening, 
I 
lie beneath the shade, 
Watching the shadows 
That dance on the meadows, 
When the day begins to fade; 
When a 
sweet remembrance com 
to me 
Like a 
long forgotten strain 
Of music, awaking 
And freshly breaking 
Over my heart again. 
In visions of the past, 
I 
see my love arise, 
And in my dreaming 
I 
feel the beaming 
Of her soft, compassionate eyes , 
Ah! Thus may saddened hearts maw 
Their life's pure morning beams ' 
On the past to ponder, 
A_nd softly wander, 
Into—The Land of Dreams,

BEAUTIFUL BLUE BELLS. 
Words and Music by W. H. DRLEHANTY. 
Beautiful blue bells, wet with morning dew, 
Emblems of you, dear, fair and pure, and true— 
Proofs of affection which I 
feel for you— 
Beautiful blue bells, wet with morning dew. 
That's the sweet epistle which I 
sent to-day 
To my little Sweetheart, Annie, o'er the way. 
Then there came an answer, loving, kind and true— 
Thanks for those sweet posies, blue bells wet with dew 
CHonus. 
That's the way I 
won her. 
It is, upon my honor. 
My life is blissful since I 
sent, to- thy, 
Those pretty flowers to Annie, o'er the way. 
But she is sweeter, fairer, far than you, 
Beautiful blue bells, wet with morning dew. 
[Symph] 
[Symph7 
Now, every evening you can find me there, 
In that little cottage with my love so fair, 
Wooing and cooing like two little doves— 
Pleasure pursuing, while exchanging loves. 
Then if you had seen her sitting by my side, 
When I 
asked the question, " Will you be my bride ?'' 
How she blushed and trembled, and her eyes so blue, 
Looked just like those flowers, blue bells wet with dew,

CHARMING 
LITTLE KITTY. 
Words and Music by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
There's a 
maiden in this City 
Twice as fair and twice as pretty 
As the early, smiling, dew-besprinkled rose, 
Or the lily, or the mignonettes, 
The holiotropo or violets ! 
There's none of them such beauty can disclose. 
Her eyes are blue and bright, 
Her teeth are pearly white ; 
And nature painted roses in her cheeks. 
She is roguish, and she's witty— 
Is my pretty little Kitty ! 
And you hear a 
choir of Angels when she speaks. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes! I 
love my Kitty so. [Symph] 
And she loves me, yes, that I 
know, [ Symphl 
Oh ! you ought to hear me talking, 
When I'm out with Kitty walking, 
And she leans so gracefully upon my arm. 
Then to see me throw the style on, 
With my gallus little tile on, 
And you bet a 
pile on, like a 
charm. 
Underneath the sweet magnolia— 
Now, remember what I 
told yer— 
That's the place I 
met Miss Kitty Allilee. 
Where the sweet magnolia blossom, 
,-thed its petals on her bosom ; 
And I 
had to brush them off so lovingly; 
But she seemed to half decline. 
When I 
said, 
Will you be mine?" 
And I 
pressed her closer to my loving breast, 
Then she said, 
You may repent it— 
Hasty wedings are relented !" 
That was all she said, but you can guess the rest.

MAUD DE MOORE, 
Written by Wm. II. DELEHANTY. 
MY 
heart is light by day or night, 
With hope and love and joy in store, 
Since I 
have seen the lovely queen— 
The modest maiden -Maud De Moore. 
And when you see her you'll agree— 
She has no peer the wide world o'er, 
her sweetest smilc knows nought of guile, 
"A flower of love" is Maud De Moore. 
CHORUS. 
Thou hast my heart where'er thou art 
Sweet Maud I 
cannot offer more, 
'Tis full of love pure from above, 
Deal kindly with t 
Maud De Moore. 
The joys of spring the birds that sing, 
The ivy twining round thy door, 
The sweet perfume of flow'rs in bloom, 
Are loves of thee which I 
adore; 
When last we met can I 
forget, 
The kindly tear your eye fill'd o'er, 
And I 
was blind with feelings kind— 
But sad to part with Maud De Moore. 
Thou hast my heart, &c. 
I 
hope and pray, that come it may, 
The end of sorrow's weary chain, 
When I 
once more my native shore, 
May tread its dear paths o'er again, 
And may it come across the foam, 
The joy that reaches my heart's core, 
know you'll meet me at the gate, 
4B loving as in days of yore. 
Thou bast my heart, etc

CHARLEY. 
There's a 
lovel4 little maiden, 
Living down in yonder lane, 
Who has promised that she'd see me here to-night; 
And my heat with love is laden. 
Oh ! the sweet, delicious pain, 
That enraptured hearts experionce with delight! 
And oh ! she is charming 
As the flowers in May; 
Or as lovely as a 
peach in the fall! 
And I 
could'ut see the harm in 
Giving her my love to-day. 
For I 
really think she's sweetest of them all s 
CHORUS. 
She's my own—my heart's desire— 
Is my dark- eyed sweet Maria ! 
Oh! tell me why you wink your eye, 
Ion roguish little butterfly ! 
As if you knew the reason I 
am here. 
And merrily from every tree, 
The pretty warblers sing to me ! 
Because they know Maria loves me, dear! 
MARIA. 
Now I 
wonder, where's Charley? 
Surely, this is where he said 
That he'd meet me when the evening's shadows felL 
May be I 
have come to early ; 
Or, perhaps he has delayed, 
-
Culling posies for me in the ilowing 
deiL 
But I 
feel just as happy 
As a 
sweet Magnolia Rower ! 
Or flip Honeysuckle, hanging to the wall! 
When .I 
saw his manly beauty, 
I 
was victim of its power; 
SO I 
cannot help but love him best of all! 
CHORUS. 
He's my own—my heart's desire— 
And he calls me his dear Maria ! 
Szc., 
CHARLEY. 
Why, my pretty little primrose, 
I 
have heard your pretty song. 
Low and sweet as zephyrs passing thro' the trees 
Then a 
feeling in my heart arose 
That I 
had kept you long. 
And now, I 
hope that you'll forgive me, won't you, 
[ 
please? 
MARIA. 
Never ask me, Charley, darling! 
Long as you may ever live; 
And of your importunities I 
pray be done. 
CHARLEY. 
Yes! and now desist our quarrelling, 
Loving hearts must soon forgive; 
And when our minds the same, two hearts must boa 
as one.

Ah! muffle the harp—touch not a 
chord, 
Lest thou disturb her slumber sound— 
Who qeep the everlasting sleep; one word 
Would mar the holiness, profound! 
Poor Anestacia lies silently there, 
Beneath that little new made mound. 
Not her— but all that's left of her ; 
Her soul, sweet Heaven has now enthron'd. 
" 
Dear mourners”—pray list to the story, 
Of an earthly Angelic flight. 
Who vanished away in the glory 
Of Heaven's most radiant light! 
How, for years she had dwelt among us; 
And we learned to love her so. 
But she left her soul's cold raiment 
To be buried beneath the snow. 
Anestacia We knew her an Orphan, 
So fair, so pure and so mild; 
And the cares of nineteen summers, 
Still left her but a 
child. 
Ethereal— sweet--Angeli c ! 
So tender, benign and good; 
With something divine about her, 
Which none of us understood. 
When I 
saw the sad expression 
Her black eyes used to wear, 
It made me think of Heaven, 
And sometimes say a 
prayer; 
She seemed not ill, nor healthy— 
Not joyous, and yet content; 
Like a 
fair but drooping lily, 
When its bloom is nearly spent. 
We loved her in our houcehold, 
And hoped she'd always stay. 
But one bright summer morning, 
It seemed she flew away. 
Then we heard of how an Angel 
Took flight to God above. 
How she passed in perfect glory, 
To realms of bliss and love. 
She looked so fair in the coffin, 
With a 
smile so sweet and bland; 
Her beauty far outrivaled 
The lilies in her hand. 
Her dear friends gathered round her, 
And tears of sorrow fell ; 
And prayers were sent to Heaven, 
Where she with God doth dwell

And when Massa Hembold tame, 
He paid us for the same.

This is what we used to do, 
Picking up the Buchu;

Saves many from cold.

Oh, let me speak, departing soul, 
E'er gone to ne'er return ; 
That I 
may tell my wicked life 
To whom it may concern. 
It may, per chance, do some one good, 
And no one any harm; 
But block the road that leads to ruin, 
Wrought by fair woman's charm. 
The maiden, pure in innocence, 
Unknown to care and strife, 
May learn what comes of ignorance, 
To blast an holy life. 
And find a 
moral in this tale; 
For I 
was once as pure 
As snow, that scarce of Heaven fell 
But I 
am pure no more. 
I 
never knew a 
mother's love, 
Nor felt her tender care ; 
For she did give her life for me--
Ne'er blest me with a 
prayer. 
Though I 
was reared religiously, 
Was educated well, 
And moved in high society, 
Of which I 
blush to tell.

In ignorance I

And so, alas, I 
fell. 
My father turned me from his dOor, 
And cruel words he said; 
My sisters dared not speak to me,_ . 
So from the right - I

That sweetened me- astray.

Through the Woods we Wandered. 
Written and composed by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Little Maud and I; 
Leisurely meandered, 
Giving sigh for sigh. 
Blithe and merry-hearted, 
Arm-in-arm we went; 
All our loves imparted, 
Blest with sweet content. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Lovely Maud and me; 
But awhile we pondered, 
Near a 
shady tree. 
There she turned and faced me, 
Something sweet to say; 
Trustingly embraced me, 
In her tender way. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Maud and I 
alone; 
Where a 
brook ran onward, 
Making gentle moan. 
We had pulled two posies, 
Bound them side by side; 
When we made proposes, 
Threw them in the tide. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
While the little stream; 
Bore these pledges onward, 
Bonds of our love dream. 
Secret vows we plighted, 
Sacred love and faith; 
Like those flowers united, 
Ever until death.

HaAl'st thou but heard her talking, 
Thine all attention given, 
Or by her side been walking 
That lovely summer even', 
While zephyrs flower breath laden— 
Made earth seem part of heaven. 
But dread the bitter ending, 
if when by her deserted, 
Bereft her sweet befriending, 
'Twere better death had started— 
His round nor leave thee parted, 
Forever broken hearted. 
Sweet Emma's, ate. 
PRETTY IDA VANE. 
Words and Music by W. Lt. Drimmurrr. 
Oh! how I 
love a 
pretty little girl 
Who lives in yonder lane, 
As sweet as sugar cane, 
Who's name is Ida Vane. 
Oh! how she set my brain to whirl 
When she said—' call again"— 
Down in yonder lane—to-night— 
My pretty Ida Vane. 
Caoans. 
Oh! charming little precious dear, (symph.) 
Bow I 
wish that she was here, ( " ) 
Oh! then we'd take a 
quiet little walk 
Adown the woodland grove, 
So leisurely we'll rove, 
And softly whisper love. 
Birds will listen for to hear us talk, 
And when they sing again, 
Their song shall be a 
song of love 
And pretty Ida Vane. 
Oh! if you could only see her eyes, 
hey shine like stars at night, 
So beautiful and bright. 
With a 
dazzlit g 
diamond light. 
Whoever gets her gets a 
prize; 
He shall not woo in vain 
For She's a " Flower of Paradise,"' 
My pretty Ida Vane. 
Oh I 
see, the Moon is shining clear, 
The Stars are out at play— 
And sweetly did she say, 
" 
We'll meet at close of day !" 
Oh I 
come and tt ll me i 
retty little dear, 
And ease my hart of pain, 
Why keep me longer waiting here, 
My pretty Ida Vane.

FANCY LITTLE STEP! 
As sung by the RICHMOND SISTERS. 
Oh I 
I've come here to tell about 
A 
little lover fair, 
That occurred to me as I 
walked out 
To take the evening air; 
And on a 
girl I 
chanced to throw 
Such a 
charm, I 
can't forget.. 
My admiration was bestowed 
On her fancy little step. 
CHORDS. 
For so easy and so gaily she did glide, 
[ 
I 
4eak. 
For that little fairy I 
would have died, 
[Break. 
For her head was bending low, 
As she gracefully on did go, 
With a 
silver pair of tassells 
On her high-heeled boots, 
And her fancy little step. 
But she has gone, and now I 
grieve, 
I 
really think its mean; 
And after this I 
will believe 
That love is but a 
dream; 
And when many years have gone, 
I 
never shall forget 
The girl that had the pleasant smile, 
Miet 
the faucy little step!

These Cards are arr nged and printed in series-Hi arts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades-and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
Sour rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an. 
sewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but ti e 
directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters ia relation to them from all parts of the U.S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
tc, meet a 
want frequently felt by young people-a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committaL 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dila. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. AS 
a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will oover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
' the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
neoessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
