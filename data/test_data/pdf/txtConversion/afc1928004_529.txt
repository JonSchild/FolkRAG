DANCING IN `
DTP. 
SUNLIGHT. 
Written and composed by JAMES MAAS for the GIRARD BROTHERS, limed 
sung by them with immense success, at the Howard Atheneettvi, 
Boston. 
-WHAT a 
pleasure there is in dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
With ringing notes from pearly throats, 
We while the hours away ; 
With beaming smile our time beguile, 
We are always blithe and gay. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile ; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
, 
CHORUS. 
Hark, hark ! hear the music ring, (sym.) 
Shout, shout! raise your voice and sing. (syrn.) 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile ; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
For it will make you glad; 
In the golden rays its shadow it will mock you, 
And whirl and dance like mad. 
When sunset's come, and day is done, 
And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the blest, 
The rays of morning light. 
Oh ! What a 
pleasure there is dancing in tho sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile ; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
Hark, hark; -"to. 
LOVELY VIOLET. 
Double song and dance. Written by ‘.TERRY COHAN for 110GAZI and 
Oh where can she have gone, she said she'd meet me here, 
At half past one, the time has flown and yet she don't appear. 
I'll surely be distracted if she don't come—ah well, 
I'll think myself rejected for some other colored swell. 
CHORUS 
Why do I 
love her so, (dance) 
I'm sure I 
do not know, 
Perhaps because she's beautiful—her face I'll ne'er forget, 
That winning smile and dashing style of lovely Violet. 
Enter Second Swell. 
I 
wonder why it is my love she does not come, 
She said she'd meet me on this street about the hour of one, 
And now it is long after and she has not come yet, 
So up the street 1'11 stroll and meet my lovely Violet. 
Enter First Swell. 
I 
wonder who's that fellow 
That looks so much like me, 
erhaps he loves my Violet—if so that shall not be. 
Second Swell. 
That chap my style has copied,-
My girl he's trying to get. 
Both Swells 
Why are you here to meet my dear, my lovely Violet. 
Last Chorus 
1st Swell) She's faithful to me I 
know, (dance) 
2nd do) I'm her accepted beau,(dance) 
Both) She promised that she'd meet me, 
I'm sure she will come yet, 
Lnd then you see she's all to me my lovely Violet.

THERE was a 
bold young Brigadier, 
Magatin was his name ; 
Among all social characters, 
He won desarvin' fame; 
But now the scenes he made so gay, 
Have lost their life and joy ; 
He's gone away and left us. 
011 ! he was a 
dacent boy. 
CHORES. 
He's gone far away, 
But where I 
could not say ; 
He left the politicians all in sorrow and dismay ; 
There's not such a 
man from here to Dublin bay ; 
Maguffin ! Oh, Magullin 
Why did you go away ? 
He wore a 
stand-up collar, 
And a 
necktie made of blue; 
Likewise a 
handsome black mustache 
-With a 
little curlicue ; 
He had an ivory handle 
On his dandy walkin' cane ; 
And a " dicer," smooth and shiny, 
Kept the weather from his brain. 
He's gone far away, etc. 
*" Mag,uffm" was an intimate friend of " Mulcahy." 
( 
1 ) 
MAGIIFFIN.—Concluded. 
For jokin' or for fightin', 
Sure he never could be bate ; 
To see him ate roast turkey, 
'Twas a 
pleasure and a 
thrate. 
I 
hear them say he fell in love 
Wid a 
lady named McCann, 
And I 
suppose it's thrue enough. 
For he was a 
ladies' man. 
He's gone far away, etc. 
He was a 
great philosopher, 
Like the Emperor of Brazil ; 
And he never was a 
partner 
In a 
crooked whiskey still; 
He thravelled on his dignity, 
Wherever he might go ; 
And in a 
rough and tumble, 
You can bet he was not slow. 
Ho's gone far away, etc. 
Perhaps he went to Harlem 
To recruit his failing health, 
Or took a 
trip to Washington, 
Where people soon get wealth ; 
Perhaps he went to rusticate 
On some secluded shore ; 
But what's the use o'talkin', 
Sure Maguflln's here no more. 
He's gone far away, etc.

THE OLD MAN AM DEAD AND GONE, 
Performed with great success all over the country by BARLOW, 
W ILSON, PRIMROSE & W EST'S Minstrels. 
I 
LIVED ill 01(1 Virginny for many, many years, 
And worked among the cotton and corn ; 
Old massa he was good and kind, it filled my eyes with 
tears, 
I 
nebber see his good old face any more. 
The rumiticum cotehed me, my limbs are getting weak, 
It bent me over like the yaller corn. 
I 
wonder if thar's any one will shed a 
silent tear 
When this poor old man am dead and gone. 
CHORUS. 
De rumiticum cotched me, my limbs are getting weak, 
It bent me over like the yaller corn. 
I 
wonder if thar's any one will shed a 
silent tear 
When this poor old man am dead and gone. 
Now dar's de good ole missie, she was either kind to me ; 
To please her was my very heart's delight ; 
But death did know no tokens, it took her off one day, 
And now she living with the angels bright. 
The old plantation's changed about, the boy am gone 
away, 
No more shall hoe de green and yaller corn ; 
And I 
wonder if thar's any one will shed a 
silent tear 
When this poor old man am dead and gone. 
De rumiticum cotched me, etc. 
Now it's bard to be contented when eberything is changed; 
Old mossa and missie gone from me. 
But de good book says be patient, and try and bar 
your pains, 
And soon from toil and sorrow I'll be free ; 
But here I 
is a-weeping in sorrow all alone, 
With no one left to cheer me while I 
stay ; 
And I 
wonder if thar's any one will shed a 
silent tear 
When this poor old man am passed away. 
Be rumiticum cotched me, etc.

SCANLON. 
Is summer time when all is fine. 
And the trees and grass are green ; 
When the boys are drinking lager beer, 
And everything's serene, 
On Tom McDonnell's old tin roof, 
The boys do dance at night, 
With Kitty Malone and Mary Shea, 
Who sing with all their might. 
They have a 
big accordeon, 
The music it is grand. 
You'll hear them shout for miles away ; 
Faith, they never will go home, 
While they can have a 
tune 
And " Tracy" on his instruments will 
CHORUS. 
It's polkas, waltzes, quadrilles all the night, 
'Tis finer than the Op'ra Bouffe ; 
If you don't believe- I'm right, call around there any 
night, 
And you'll find us on McDonnell's old tin roof. 
They call themselves the midnight owls. 
They dance by light of moon, 
To start for home at two o'clock, 
They say it is too soon. 
(

They keep the folks awake all night, 
They never have their rest, 
To sing their songs and play their tunes, 
They do their level best. 
The music it is charming, 
It really is divine, 
'Tis finer than the OVra Boll& ; 
When they do the Boston dip, 
Faith, the house rocks like a 
ship, 
Oh, there's no place like McDonnell's old tin 
roof. 
It's polkas, waltzes, etc. 
Across the street from where I 
live, 
A 
German keeps a 
store, 
He is a 
baker man by trade, 
He's worth a 
thousand or more. 
He keeps about five men at work, 
Of course they're up all night, 
But when they hear the music play, 
They shout with great delight. 
About the time the bread is bak'd. 
The boys and girls descend, 
They don't stop till they've reached the door; 
And they'll skip across the street, 
And the bread they'll nip so neat, 
Oh, you ought to hear the bakers how they 
roar, 
It's polkas, waltzes, etc.

HOTEL DE VARSELY: 
By ED. HARRIGAN. 
I'M living at a 
boarding-house 
Up in Houston street, 
Where actors and musicians 
Eat their meals and sleep. 
There the hungry ballet tramp 
That come from Marcela, 
Dancing Danish polkas 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
CHORUS. 
All night I 
am uneasy, 
No sleep at all I 
get, 
Wid bones and clappers rattling 
And a 
Prussian clarionet, 
They never talk in English, 
But parley volts Francay. 
I'll lose my life, upon my soul, 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
When we sat down to breakfast, 
It's Cully, pass me that, 
Or Nixy Weedy, Nibzy, 
Stag the tad wid the dizzy hat. 
They have a 
soup called bullion, 
The butter runs away, 
The boarders holler out for dates 
In the Hotel -Varselay. 
All night I 
am, etc. 
The other night I 
tried to sleep, 
When a 
man from Calumet 
Came down through the ceiling ? 
Turning a 
summerset. 
I 
grabbed him by his necktie, 
He " Hay Rube ! hay Rube !" did say. 
I 
was kicked by a 
circus company 
From the Hotel Varselay. 
All night I 
am, etc. 
I 
went up stairs to get my trunks, 
And have revenge or die, 
When a 
man they called a 
tumbler 
Said, " Shoot him—kill the guy." 
I 
drew a 
knife and grabbed my trunk, 
The French said " Allecushay." 
My trunk was nailed unto the floor 
In the Frotel‘Varselay. 
All night I 
am. etc.

Dedicated to Mr. 
EDWARD H ARRIGAN, of the Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
LORD, I

To follow my loved ones in the sky ;

And when the sun is setting way far beyond the mill, 
I'll sing the old, old story, and " Climbing up Zion's 
Hill." 
Den come this way, children, 
I 
am on my journey home ; 
Good-bye, old Snow Drop Nancy, 
Farewell old Aunty Chloe, 
Jest haml the instrument down to me, 
I

And I 
will play my last farewell, 
Then angels carry me home. 
Oh Lord let me be happy, let me -walk the Golden Street, 
Where everything is lovely and the angels look so sweet. 
I 
want to be up higher, my massa he's gone there, 
And though I'm old and feeble, I'll sing and dance 
when there. 
send down blessed tidings when troubles you offend, 
At sunrise every morning I'll bread from heaven send. 
Then good-bye, now I'm happy; good-bye, fare you well, 
I'm climbing up the ladder, and ringing Heaven's bell. 
Den come this way, etc.

PARODY ON BABIES ON OUR BLOCK. 
Written and sung by BILLY CARTER with great success. 
You can talk of ugly babies, 
On our block it is a 
sight 
To see a 
thousand babies chaw 
And claw with all their might. 
There are pug-nosed babies, goggle-eyed kids, 
And some of the good old stock. 
It's a 
regular menagerie, 
The babies on the block. 
Mrs. Grady's got a 
baby 
That talked before 'twas born, 
Another by the name of Simpson, 
With a 
nose like a 
Wm. goat's horn; 
They'll get squalling and bawling, 
And they'd gather in a 
flock. 
Barnum () tight to make a 
call 
On the babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Johnny Toothpick 
And Susan Turpentine, 
A-crying and a-fighting, 
And a-singing Baby Mine ; 
They'd take the chromo, cake and all, 
For smashing Grandpa's clock, 
They'd win the prize for swallowing flies, 
These babies on our block.

PARODY ON BABIES ON OUR BLOCK.— 
Concluded. 
There's an Italian kid just two years old, 
With eyes in the back of his head, 
You can guess how the daddy feels 
When the young one's hair is red 
Some have got no eyes, and some have got 
no nose, 
And a 
black and tan kid 
With an elephant hoof 
And forty-'leven toes ; 
Some's dramatic, some's lunatic, 
One kid has a 
wooden ear, 
Another one, they call Napoleon, 
Drinks his barrel of lager beer. 
They'll rear and tare, 
And pull their hair, 
Until your nerves they shock, 
They'll scream and yell, 
And raise old fun, 
The babies on our block. 
Little Sally Falseteeth, 
Sitting in a 
custard pie. 
A-crying 'cause her little brother 
Slugged her in the eye. 
Rise, Sally, rise, knock his eye out with a 
rock, 
For there's a 
hundred times more babies 
Than there's daddies on our block.

I LOVE A LITTLE DAMSEL. 
Words and Music by BOBBY NEWCOMB. 
Music published by 0. Drrsox & Co., Boston. Mlas. 
I 
love a 
little damsel with a 
pretty little face, 
And she's junp'd in my affections, in my heart she stole a 
place, 
She dresses neat and stylish, the men they sigh and stare; 
She knows they're dead in love with her and yet she does not 
care, 
For I'm the one she fancies tho' you may not think it true, 
But if you knew our meeting place, you'd often see us two, 
I'm sure we love each other, and I'm her only beau. 
We've got a 
little trysting place, 
And wouldlt you like toknow ? 
CHORUS. 
For the girls they are so very fascinating, 
Our affections they are always captivating, 
With their flirting and their pouting they deceive you, 
But really this is not the case with me. 
Her father he's an artist, her mother takes in clothes, 
While my handsome little charmer, to help along, she sews. 
I 
go down to her mansion, I 
sit and hold the thread, 
And over that there's many a 
kiss and loving word been 
We talk like most of lovers and coo like turtle-doves, 
I've spent my weekly income in perfume, and fans and gloves. 
Last night I 
popped the question and on one knee did go, 
Her answer was—I 
dare not tell— 
But wouldn't you like to know ? 
For the girls, &c. 
My heart is like a 
feather, I 
scarce know what to do, 
My sweetheart, like her lover, says she feels contented too. 
But perhaps you'll slightly wonder what makes our spirits high 
It is because we are engaged to be married by and by. 
Perhaps you'd like to see us when to the church we walk-, 
For among the upper circles the match is all the talk. 
I 
love to think my sweetness will then no longer sew, 
Her name I 
must not tell you--
But wouldn't yen like to know ? 
For the girls, cIoas 
WHICH ROAD YOU GWINE TO TAKE ? 
As 
sung by BILLY LACLEDE. 
W HAT kind of garment does de wise man wear, 
To join de pilgrim band ? 
What kind of hair oil to grease your hair, 
And join de pilgrim band ? 
You must wear a 
long white ulster, 
Floating on de morning breeze, 
And shake de gospel powder 
To make old Satan sneeze. 
Dar's one road leads to de promised land, 
And de oder to de brimstone lake ; 
Don't stall.' all day a-makin' up your mind ; 
Which road is you gwine to take ? 
CHORUS. 
Walk on, don't wait for stragglers on de way, 
For I'm going through on de telegraph note, 
To get ready for de Judgment Day. 
When Satan goes round for to collect de fares, 
I'll join de pilgrim band; 
He'll kick you down from de slippery stairs, 
I'll join de pilgrim band. 
If your password ain't de right one, 
And your name ain't on de book, 
It will be too late to buzz him, 
You'll find dat you are shook. 
Dar's one road leads to de promised land, 
And de oder to de brimstone lake; 
Don't stan' all day a-makin' up your mind; 
Which road is you gwiue to take ? 
Walk on, ate.

AS SWEET AS A ROSE IS SHE, 
Written by BOBBY N EWC03113. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
So charming in form and in pace ; 
Her eyes they have pierced my heart through, 
And I 
constantly dream of her face. 
Her voice is as clear as the lark 
That sings with the rising of the day, 
Her breath is as fragrant and sweet 
As the white blossomed flowers of May. 
CHORUS. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
Her eyes they sparkle bright 
Fairer than all to me, 
I 
think of her day and night, 
There's none in this world so wide 
Could be the same to me, 
As the girl I'd call my bride, 
As sweet as a 
rose is she. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl who has won all my love ; 
I'd willingly sacrifice life, 
call her my own turtle dove. 
But she laughs in my face when I 
speak, 
And when I 
make love says, " I 
shan't," 
Then tells me I 
must her forget ; 
And I 
would, but then really I 
can't. 
As sweet as a 
rose, etc. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl for whose hand I 
have sblied ; 
The wealth of the world I 
would give, 
If only to call her my bride. 
I 
hope I 
may yet win her hand, 
That would make me so happy for life, 
If I 
do, when I 
meet you again, 
Then perhaps I 
will show you my wife. 
As sweet as a 
rose, etc.

THE NIGHT THAT WE WENT BOBBING 
AFTER EELS. 
RECITATION. 
Written and recited by Joux F. W HITNEY, of the " Novelty Four," 
in their original burletta, " Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
I 
DON'T exactly recollect, but 'twas at the full of the moon, 
About three years ago in the middle of next June, 
That a 
gang of us assembled for to start a 
fishing club, 
And we elected all the officers midst a 
terrible hubbub, 
And McGowan was elected Treasurer pro tem. 
We came to the conclusion we'd go bobbing after eels, 
And for fear we'd get the cramps we took along a 
keg of 
We started very early so as we'd not start late, 
And we had a 
gallon demijohn marked B-A-T-E, 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
When we got near the place where we were going to bob, 
We pushed the boat about a 
mile up to our necks in mud. 
Devlin got excited and McCue was going to shoot, 
Because he had the gall to make an eel-trap of his boot, 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
McSourly, the comic singer, he wanted to vocalize, 
But we beseeched him to desist, for us he'd paralyze ; 
But when he got about half full he started Pinafore, 
And they threw him over the side of the boat and I 
never 
see him more, 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
When we got tired of bobbing it was near the break of 
day; 
Muldoon cried out breakers ahead and swore we were out 
at sea. 
I 
never got over it for a 
month, for the cook made a 
great 
mistake, 
He gave me an eel for breakfast, and by heavens it was a 
snake.

YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOMETHING 
NAUGHTY. 
On, when I 
was a 
little boy I 
was on mischief bent, 
And up to every sort of fun, or any devilmet; 
And when that I 
had older grown, I'd visit the green 
park, 
And have a 
roll down the green slopes, and play till it 
was dark. 
SPOKEN.—I do like a 
roll down the slopes in the park. 
One day I 
met the Simpkinses there, and we had a 
race 
just to see who could roll the fastest, and it was so nice. 
When I 
got home mother said, " What the dickens have 
you been up to, why your elbows are all green ?" 
Then 
between a 
blink and a 
squint she said— 
CHOWCS. 
You've been doing something naughty, I 
can tell it by 
your eye ; 
You've been doing something naughty, for you look so 
very sly ; 
You've been doing something naughty, since you pull a 
face so long ; 
You've been doing something naughty, you've been doing 
something wrong. 
To Rosherville I 
took Miss Brown, to spend a 
happy day, 
And there we had some jolly fun, which made us feel 
quite gay ; 
We danced upon the platform and listened to the band, 
Then strolled around the garden together hand in hand.

YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOMETHING 
NAUGHTY.—Concluded. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, I 
did enjoy it so much. We walked 
about for some time, and then sat down under some trees 
in a 
retired spot ; then we whispered loving words, and 
it was so nice. 
And just as I 
was about to imprint a 
kiss 
upon her fair cheek, I 
beheld a 
face peeping from behind 
a 
tree. 
It was her father, and this is what he said to 
me— 
You've been doing something naughty, etc. 
At length we left the Gardens and journeyed home by 
train, 
I 
pressed her darling little hand and whispered low her 
name, 
When some one in our carriage, perhaps thinking it no 
harm, 
While in the tunnel pulled the rope, which caused a 
great 
alarm. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was just in the act of pressing her 
hand, and it was so nice, when some stupid individual 
pulled the alarm bell, and the train was stopped, and the 
guard came to our carriage window and inquired what 
was the matter ; but the moment he saw me he said, I 
see it all, it's you, sir 
You've been doing something naughty, etc.

I've sat before the fire dese long winter nights

I'd see her good old black face looking out at me, seem-

You have 
spoken so kind to me. 
Reub. Kind words are something I 
ain't used to. 
Kind 
words are balm to the soul ; they oil the machinery of 
life and keep it in smooth running order. 
You better let 
up on that bread, and save some for a

Chloe. It's a 
long story, old man, and some night, as 
we sit before the fire, I'll tell it to you. 
I 
have tramped 
all over the country searching for you, 
Reub. Yes, and I've been all over looking for you, and 
didn't find you, either. 
I 
was going to Indiany to buy a 
divorce soon. 
Ha! ha! 
Chloe. I 
lost sight of you, old man, after one of the 
battles near the old plantation. 
I 
looked all over the 
fields and couldn't even find your dead body. 
Reub. Dat's a 
fact ; you couldn't find my dead body, 
'cos I 
had it 'long wid me, ha ! ha ! 
Chloe, I 
tell you I 
have searched for you year after year. 
Everybody told 
me you was dead, but still I 
hoped on, thinking we would 
meet some day on dis earth or have a 
jubilee up thar, 
where travelers meet to part no more; where dar's 110 
need of chopping wood for a 
living, or be your own 
housekeeper ; but where little angels bring you Christmas 
cake and honey for lunch every minute of the day. 
Chloe. Old man, when we parted—when we got mixed 
up during that battle—our hair wasn't gray, was it ? 
Rub. No ; but gray hair is bound to come if you live 
long enough! I 
guess we got a 
few gray hairs, ain't we ? 
Chloe. Reuben, where are the two children—our two 
little rosebuds—little 'Liza Jane and little Peety ? 
Reub. Gone ! gone ! whar I 
hope they never will want 
for anything. 
Dey died more of starvation clan anything 
else. 
I 
tell you, Chloe, after the war food was pretty 
skeerce. 
I 
used to live on only one bean a 
day, and I 
came pretty near bean dead on dat luxury. 
Chloe. But whar are the two children ?

paradise and wearing out their little angel pautaloonses, 
and no spanking—nobody to sew or half-sole them

They're happy; I 
know it. 
You and I 
will

nice pair of bald-headed angels, won't we ? 
Chloe. Hush up, dar; how you ' spect to be holy and , 
have Zion around you if you go on (Tat way ? Look up 
dar ; don't you see something flying in the clouds ? 
Reub. Yes, dem's big black mosquitoes, ain't they ? 
Chloe. No ; dose surely must be our little Cupids, re-

separation we are united

The jubilee has come at last, for Chloe's back again.

Old age has found us both, we're feeble on the feet,

But the jubilee is here at last, for Chloe's back again. 
Oh, listen, etc. 
REUBEN and CHLOE dance a

REUBEN, then CHLOE. 
Old man getting weaker at every

Old CHLOE bends over him,

Chloe. Come, old man, stand on your feet. 
Reub. I'm gone! 
Tell de folks I

Green fire. 
Music.

Discover two little 
black Cupids among set clouds, beckoning to CHLOE and

Sung by M ANCHESTER and JENNINGS. 
No longer talk about your men 
Of funny song and dance; - 
For we can lay way over them all, 
If you'll give us a

There's dancing in our heels and toes 
And music in our chins. 
You can bet we are thoroughbreds, 
Although we're thick and thin.

My name is Singing Gus, (Syn.) 
While mine is Dancing Jim,

'Would like a

And some say we are twins; 
You bet we are two thoroughbreds,

LITTLE MOUNTAIN DAISY.

MUSiC by FRED THTHITE. 
IN 
yonder little moss-grown cottage, 
Where beauteous daisies grow, 
A 
little blue-eyed darling's waiting 
With cheeks that are aglow; 
Like the blossom of the roses, 
Like Aurora's brightest beam, 
Her image haunts me night and day, 
- 
In one long pleasant dream. 
CHOPXS. 
My love for her I 
must confess, (
break.) 
And ask the folks our love to bless; (
break.) 
The wedding bells will sweetly chime, 
As hand in hand we stray, 
My mountain daisy will be mine 
Upon that happy day. 
We often talk about the future, 
Build castles in the air ; 
I 
fancy that I 
rule a 
kingdom, 
And my little queen is there. 
But I'll ask for nothing more 
Than my darling's love so pure, 
It will outlast all earthly wealth, 
And thro' this life endure. 
My love for her, etc. 
I 
MUST GO.

PARODY ON WIDOW DUNN. 
— Sung by BILLY CARTER. 
Dedicated to HARRINTON and HART. 
I KNOW a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a 
livery stable, 
A-making beds for horses that are sick. 
She's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer ; 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's from the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum, 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow Dunn. 
CIIORUS. 
She is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey ; 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary. 
She's a 
lamb, I 
mean a 
ham, 
She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector uf the 1,Vi,10‘,v 
Dunn. 
She steals the morning papers 
Away from every door, 
She's an acrobatic, break-neck son of a 
gun, 
And at every wake or funeral, 
She goes to sing and dance, 
Such a 
tender creature is the widow Dunn. 
She's freckled, but she's pretty, 
And has well-developed feet, 
She has one back tooth that weighs a 
half a 
ton, 
And at every passing stranger 
She fires an ancient egg, 
So familiar is the Widow Dunn, 
CHORUS. 
She is moody, she is sankey, 
She's consumptive, she is crankey, 
She's rheumatic, she's lunatic, 
She's a 
bum, she weighs a 
ton, 
She is crazy, she is careless, 
She is toothless, she is hairless, 
Such a 
chromo is the big fat Widow Dunn. 
SALLY, BLESS MY SOUL! 
Made popular by our Song and Dance Artists, Messrs. W AYNE and 
LOVELY. 
I 
SHOULD like to know the reason why 
As I 
go down the street, 
There is a 
twinkle in the eye 
Of every girl I 
meet. 
I 
ask'd my cousin Sally once, 
Why it was she smiled so sweet 
She says I 
am a 
perfect dunce— 
They're laughing at your feet ! 
CHOLUS. 
I 
blushed and bowed my head with grief, 
My anguish to control ; 
And said, when I 
could catch my breath, 
Oh, Sally, bless my soul ! 
Of all the talent I 
possess, 
Those feet they are my pride ; 
They are good size, and cost me 3ess 
To walk with than to ride ; 
They always take me out of town 
As fast as I 
can go ! 
And Sally fills me with alarm, 
By talking to me so. 
Now I've resolved to search this town, 
Some smaller shoes to try ; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer-by. 
I'll get a 
smaller pair, I 
VOW, 
And dress up in the style ; 
-'And when I 
meet my love, I'll bow 
And raise my Harvard tile! 
She blushed, etc. 
UNCLE RUFF. 
As sung with immense success by HARRY BLOODOOOD. 
On! when I 
was a 
little piccaninny, 
I 
used to love old Massa and Missus too; 
They brought me all the way from old Virginny 
And not much work they ever made me do; 
But now I'm growing old, yes, and feeble, 
And my hair is all a-turning into gray, 
And when the leaf is brown upon the tree, 
'Tis then old Uncle Ruff will pass away. 
CHORUS. 
Muffle up the banjo, put away the bones, 
The jawbone and the fiddle hold aloft, good lamb, 
Place my old white hat on the peg behind the door, 
And say good-bye to poor Uncle Ruff. 
The Lord. has given me orders to be ready, 
And I'll be on hand when Gabriel blows his horn. 
I 
thank the Lord for keeping me so steady, 
To meet Him up on high when I 
am gone. 
They say that heaven is a 
mighty kingdom, 
With corn and cotton fields so bright and gay, 
'Where there is no oberseer and but one master, 
And from where de darkeys neber runs away. 
CHOROKEE CHUCK,

Eating sweet molass', 
Cutting up veal cutlets 
With a

Sliding down a

Shaving with a

Swimming across the ocean 
On a 
busted cork. 
CHORUS. 
Whittling on an iceberg 
With a 
broken spoon, 
Photographic taken 
Of the moon. 
Raising peas and pickles, 
Planting rubber mats, 
Skinning caneleopards 
For to make felt hats. 
Planting boos and cooking stoves 
In the Jersey sands ; 
Out of monkeys' whiskers 
Manufacturing fans.

LITTLE empty cradle, treasured now with care, 
Though thy precious burden it has fled. 
How we miss the locks of curly golden hair. 
Peeping from thy tiny snow-white bed, 
When the dimpled cheeks and little laughing eyes 
From the rumpled pillow shone, 
Then I 
gazed with gladness, now I 
look and sigh; 
Empty is the cradle, Baby's gone. 
CHORUS. 
Baby left her cradle for the golden shore, 
O'er the sil'vry waters she has flown, 
Gone to join the angels, peaceful ever more; 
Empty is the cradle, Baby's gone. 
Near a 
shady valley stands a 
grassy mound, 
Underneath my little darling sleeps. 
Blossoms sweet, and roses cluster all around; 
Over head the willow silent weeps. 
There I 
laid my loved one in the long ago, 
And my heart cloth sadly moan, 
Though she's with the angels, still I 
fain would weep; 
Empty is the cradle, baby's gone, 
Baby left her cradle, etc.

BEAUTIFUL PINK AND WHITE ROSES.

DELEHASTY. 
As the merry birds that warble in the trees, 
Or the wild flowers that scent the summer breeze, 
As I 
wander here and there, without a- 
thought of care, 
My happiness does every hour increase. 
How sweet to love and be loved in return. 
'When modest maiden cheeks begin to burn, 
And eyes of diamond light outshine the glare at night, 
To wake from blissful dreams at early dawn. 
Oh dear! the tender passion love, 
How beautiful bewildering you seem! 
Like a 
boon descending from above, 
Elysium the rapture of a 
dream. 
Oh ! bright and merry pass the hours away, 
And time but makes the moments glad and gay, 
As I 
wander through the grove to sing of her I 
love, 
And like the birds I 
carol forth my lay. 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful pink and white roses, (Symph.) 
Culled from a 
garden of posies. 
Lovely verdant gem so rich and rare, 
How sweetly you deck my darling's hair ; 
You linger in my mind as something good and kind, 
Because you make my darling twice as fair. 
There's an ivy-covered cottage in the lane 
With its rustic little portico so plain ; 
A 
charming little spot, a 
lovely garden plot 
Where every kind of flower blooms amain; 
But the pride of all the garden is the rose 
Which here and there in great profusion grows ; 
The lovely violet and fragrant mignonette, 
There is none of them such beauty can disclose ; 
But fairer far is Flora's face to see, 
It pierced me into my very soul 
The day she pulled those pretty flowers for me 
And pinned them in my button-hole. 
Oh ! 
since that time Iplaced them in my book, 
Where now and then my eyes with rapture look ; 
They make my heart rejoice to know they were her choice, 
The roses pink and white from her I 
took. 
Beautiful pink and white roses, etc.

Tula moon is out to- night, love, floating through the sky, 
The little stars are laughing as she passes by, 
All the little songsters sing their pretty tune, 
Happy as they can be singing to the moon. 
Clouds of silver lining waiting in the sky, 
For the moon to pass them ; Jessie, so am I.

To tell you how I

The moon is out to-night, love, all the roses blush, 
When the gentle night winds tell the birds to hush, 
For I 
want to listen for a 
merry voice, 
Whose every note is music, and makes my heart rejoice; 
Jessie, I 
am watching to see if I 
can see 
Some one like a

Ah! the little angel coining once again,

I'M GETTING A BIG BOY NOW. 
W ritten by HARR/. 
Niel:toms. 
Composed by AMERB STRIPI.Rqa. 
Sung with immense success by HERBERT CAMPBELL, and also, by 
Mn. HARRY MONICHOUSE. 
I'VE had all the ills that belong to our youth, 
The whooping cough, measles and cold, 
I've cut all my teeth, and don't eat with a 
spoon, 
So now I 
begin to feel old. 
My ma gazes fondly upon her dear boy, 
With traces of care on her brow, 
And the tears fill her eyes, while fondly she sighs, 
" 
He's getting a 
big boy now." 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
And I 
fancy it's time I 
knew how 
To brush my own clothes, and to wipe my own 
nose, 
For I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
I 
smoke my papa's best cigars every day, 
And once a 
week I 
get drunk. 
I 
wink at my nurse when she puts me to bed, 
And rocks me to sleep in my bunk ; 
I 
once tried to kiss her, she sternly refused, 
And said " That I 
cannot allow, 
And in future, you elf, go to sleep by yourself, 
For you're getting a 
big boy now." 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
I'm getting a 
big boy now;

Sometimes I 
get tight, and stay out all night, 
For Frr- --tting a 
big boy now.

I'M GETTING A BIG BOY NOW.—Concluded. 
This Christmas I 
went to my first pantomime— 
I'd never been taken before; 
And now that I've been, and the fairies I've seen, 
I 
want to see several more. 
When I 
saw the fairies trip on to the stage, 
I 
felt I 
can scarce explain how, 
But I 
know that I 
thought their skirts rather short, 
And I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
And that's the best part, you'll allow, 
Where they dance in a 
row and stand on one toe, 
Oh, I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
Sometimes I 
go out for a 
spree with my pal, 
And we jump on poor cripples and babies, 
Old women and such, but men we darcn't touch, 
For we're only a 
parcel of gabies. 
And when we can muster a 
hundred or more, 
We're ready to pick up a 
row. 
I'm a 
coward, I 
own, for I'm no good alone, 
And I'm only a 
big boy now. 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
I 
can fight, kick and bully, I 
vow; 
And of course I 
don't mind, for I 
only get fined, 
Because I'm a 
big boy now.

DIABOLICAL STORY. 
Originally ming by BILLY CAirrica. 
Ir you'll listen with your ears, 
For a 
couple of million years, 
A 
diabolical story I 
will tell; 
It's about a 
female girl 
With red teeth and curly hair, 
And I 
loved her till my head began to swell. 
Her name was Susan Glue, 
And the grub she used to chew, 
She was a 
night clerk in a 
foundry over town ; 
She'd an alabaster claw, 
And a 
double breasted jaw, 
And every bunion on her feet weighed a 
pound. 
One day she gave me the shake, 
And I 
thought my heart would break, 
When I 
heard she was playing Hamlet on the stage ; 
She stole eleven or twenty dollars, 
And a 
lot of paper collars, 
And eloped with a 
bummer twice her age 
As a 
singer she is vile, 
And she hasn't got no style, 
And they'll kill her if she ever tries to dance. 
Oh, she stole my summer clothes, 
And I 
was nearly froze, 
And her bummer wears my bran new Sunday pants. 
If I 
ever meet her feller, 
I 
will bust him in the smeller, 
I 
am certain he will find an early grave ; 
I 
will split his ugly tongue, 
And I'll kick him in the lung, 
With an Indian club his whiskers I 
will shave. 
I 
will sling a 
bottle of ink, 
And. destroy Miss Susan Glue, 
And gently drop her in the nearest sewer. 
I 
will drink a 
kidney stew, 
And I'll skip to Kalamazoo, 
For Jimmy Fresh he never went back on the poor.

He otrered me his arm, 
He talked so sweet, we walked so slow, 
He worshipped every charm;

In words I

"Pray stop," said I, " for don't you see 
That I'm the Female Swell." 
Oh, yes, I

And smile on every gent I

Their thoughts they dare not tell, 
They are afraid to wink so sly, 
Like me, the Female Swell.

THE TWO COLORED WAITERS. 
Ociproposed. by HARRY W OODSON. 
Sung by the Guntszi BROTHER.. 
OUR names are Jim and Jack Bangun 
You'll find us always full of fun. - 
We're waiters in a 
restaurant, 
And dishes we do sling all day ; 
And at night, when work is over, 
We are gay as bees in clover; 
For two dandy coons like us 
You'll never find so gay. 
If you want a 
good square meal, 
See us turn upon our heel, 
For we do it up in style, 
Singing, dancing all the while. 
CHORUS. 
Oh 1 
here we are, the happy waiters! 
See us sling corned beef and taters. 
When we wait upon the table 
People say we are immense, 
For our style it is so different 
From the others in the restaurant. 
You can get a 
good square meal 
For the sum of fifty cents. 
We have roast beef ; we have corned beef; 
We have pickled eels, and pigs' feet, 
Quail on toast, and chicken stew, 
Or turkey stuffed with good, clean hash ; 
Good mutton chops, with veal cutlets, 
Ham and eggs, with some jiblets, 
Buckwheat cakes, and oyster fry, 
With good potato mash. 
Oh! here we are, ete.

WALKING IN THE LANE. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by W. EL BROCEWAY. 
The Music of this song is published by W HITE & GOULLAIID, 86 Tremont 
St., Boston, Mass. 
Price 33 cents. 
IT'S nice to take a 
pleasant stroll 
Upon the crowded street ; 
It's nice to slyly glance at all 
The faces one may meet ; 
But ev'ry joy we had in life 
Comes back to us again. 
Alien underneath the happy stars 
We're walking in the lane. 
CHORUS. 
While walking in the lane, 
While walking in the lane, 
0, sometimes, all by chance you know, 
Dear lov'd ones meet again ; 
0, how the moments fly, 
Why, that we can't explain ! 
But life is rosy sweet to us 
While walking in the lane! 
It's gay to roam hi merry spring 
Where pretty flow'rets grow ; 
But 0, a 
sweeter joy to us 
Dear gentle hearts, I 
know ! 
or every joy we had in life 
Comes back to us again, 
When we and some one that we like 
Are walking in the lane ! 
While walking, etc. 
Bright day, you know, may do for some 
When birds are singing sweet. 
But after dark beneath the leaves 
Is just the time to meet, 
Then ev'ry joy we had in life 
Comes back to us again, 
And rosy lips can meet so sly, 
While walking in the lane. 
While walking, etc. 
The roses they are fast asleep, 
They can't hear what we say ; 
But night's the very time to speak 
What can't be told by day ! 
Then hands are very softly squeezed, 
And eyes look love again ! 
0, earth seems very near to heaven 
While walking in the lane !

THE TWO SARAHS. 
Sung by LESTER and Anr.xx. 
On, I 
really think I 
shall go mad; 
I 
don't know what to do; 
I'm in love with a 
charming girl ; 
We're to be wed in a 
week or two; 
She is the darling of my heart; 
With her I'm dead in love; 
She's the sweetest girl for miles around, 
And I 
call her my turtle-dove.

Oh, my, you should see my Sarah— 
Eyes so bright and teeth so white, 
The fairest in the land; 
Oh, no, none could be so fair; 
Oh, banty toes and turn-up nose— 
My little Sarah Ann. 
Oh, we've known each other ever so long, 
And the first time that we met, 
I 
helped to push the barrel along, 
And the rain came down quite wet ; 
I 
helped to push the barrel along, 
Until we got to the door; 
She gave me a 
penny to treat myself, 
Because she couldn't afford any more. 
Oh, my, etc. 
OFF FOR NEW 
ORLEANS. 
Sung by LESTER and Ann. 
On, white folks, now we'll say good-bye, we can no longer stay; 
You hear the whistle blowing, and the steamboats on the way ; 
We're off for New Orleans, the cotton bales so brave, 
And when the boat am going our bandana we will wave. 
CHORUS. 
Far you well, white folks, we can no longer stay ; 
You bear the whistle blowing, and the steamboats on-the way, 
Far you well, white folks, we can no longer stay ; 
We're off for New Orleans before the break of day. 
We got a 
bully boat and we got a 
bully crew; 
We got a 
bully captain and a 
hunky ingin too, 
And when she starts to go ahead, and when we start to back ' er 
For it's chew, chew, to go ahead, and chew, chew, tobacker.

MINNIE MOOR. 
SONG AND CHORUS. 
Written by Pim, II . 
M OVVREY. 
On the distant prairie stood a 
lovely cot. 
Close beside a 
bright awl sparkling stream, 
W ith its vine-clad arbor where the little dew drops 
Sparkled in the sunlight's golden gleam. 
There once bloomed a 
flower to the world unknown, 
Save the few who passed the cottage door ; 
Happy as the songsters in the wild wood shade, 
Was the flower of the prairie, Minnie Moor. 
CHORUS . 
But they've laid her down to rest in a 
grassy mound 
'Neatim the branches of time oak by time door ; 
And we miss the winning smile and joyous rippling laugh 
Of the flower of the prairie, Minnie Moor. 
Oft on the banks of this sparkling little stream, 
We have wandered in moon-light's golden rays ; 
And spoke ot days to come how happy we would be 
In a 
cottage where the gentle zephyrs plays. 
But on one autumn eve, as the sun set in the West, 
Death threw his shadows round our cottage door ; 
,r7 And from this world ot care, it took my joy and pride, 
The flOwer ot the prairie. Minnie Moor. 
But they've laid her down to rest in a 
grassy mound, 
'.1;m-eath the branches of the oak by the door ; 
And we miss the winning smile and joyous rippling laugh 
Of time flower of the prairie, Minnie Moor.

BEHOLD before you here to-night two double-breasted

When we worked upon the levee, way down at New

We used to juggle cotton bales, upon the steamer's decks,

OH, FRED, TELL THEM TO 'STOP I 
Sung by SOL SMITH RUSSELL. 
No doubt you have heard of the great Fancy Fair 
That used to take place ev'ry day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away. 
We went in, you must know, and saw Richardson's show, 
And Wombwell's Menagerie as well; 
There were roundabouts, swings, and all kinds of things, 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, when we got into the Fair my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride on one of the roundabouts. I 
said, 
"All right, my darling," and we had a 
swing ; but di-
rectly the swing went to and fro she lustily called out— 
CHORUS. 
" 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop !" 
that was the cry of 
Maria; 
But the more she said " Wo," they said " Let it go," 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood 'round, of course they all laugh'd, 
But I 
only said, " Stop the swing." 
There were four or five others in the boats besides us, 
Saying, " Master, don't do such a 
thing," 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, " The young man's turning red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree." 
" 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop," etc. 
They soon stopped the swing, and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor ; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought her 
to— 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there, to the great Fancy Fair, 
Friends, take advice whilst I 
sing 
Of the great roundabout, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
SPOKEN.—Mark, now, before you go into the swing 
boat make a 
bargain with your young lady not to call 
out— 
" 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop," etc. 
MOLLIE MeGORMLY. 
hat Irish Song and Dance by Joss Tuoursox. 
I 
WAS born long ago in the sweet county Monaghan, 
In the middle of a 
bog, I 
never will get on again; 
The Shamrock, the ship that I 
over here came sailing in, 
With those big blackguards of sailors all a 
pumpin' and a 
bailin' in; 
Across the seas for ninety days, 
With yellow meal and butter milk, 
Musha bathershin-na-bocklish 
sportin' Mollie, 0 ! (Dance.) 
It's when I 
left old Ireland my patience it was taxin' 0! 
A 
nate lock of my bright red hair sure every one was axin' ! 
They all set up a 
hullabaloo, the gossoons and the colleen 
bawns, 
To leave the pigs and praties with the fairies and the leper-
acauns; 
To cross the seas for ninety days, 
With yellow meal and buttermilk, 
Musha bather-shin-na-bocklish, 
I'm sportin' Mollie, 0 ! (Dance.) 
I'm goin' to settle down when I 
get a 
bit of property, 
As large as any bog in shweet Shlather-Mac-O'Dougherty, 
I'll go in for women's rights when here I 
am a 
resident, 
ni be an alderwonmn then or else a 
faymale president.
