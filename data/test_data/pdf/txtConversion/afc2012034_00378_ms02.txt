Jake Delhomme interview, 2012-10-24 : interview conducted by Ellen E. 
McHale 
 
INTERVIEW LOG 
 
 
00:30 Jake owns horses and has 8 in training right now. He grew up in 
Breaux Bridge. His grandfather and dad were involved with quarter 
horses. They switched in 1993 and never looked back. His dad and 
brother trained and he's the owner. He's here every day. When they run a 
horse, the whole family is involved. He's not in a suit up at the 
clubhouse. He races in Louisiana. Everything is a Louisiana bred. He is 
on the board of the Louisiana Horse Breeders Association. He dabbles in 
"pin hooking." (Buying and selling horses?) He runs at Evangeline 
Downs and at Delta and the Fairgrounds.  
 
2:59 You can make a living with the purses. There are three races every 
card for Louisiana Bred. There are supplements for Louisiana bred 
racehorses.  
 
3:45 He was born and raised in the horse industry. His father worked for 
the Louisiana Agricultural Council, but always had race horses.  
 
4:35 Jake played [football] for the Saints, the Louisiana Panthers, for 
Cleveland, and the Houston Texans. He rode when he was younger, but 
he was always a little too big to ride as a jockey. He wanted to be a 
1 
 
jockey when he was a kid, but he wasn't near enough to the weight. He 
played football instead.  
 
5:43 The biggest thing that bothers him is that people complain about 
the horse industry and that the horses are mistreated. It's an everyday job 
and we, the horse industry, take good care of the horses.  
 
7:11 The track opens at 5:30 a.m. in the summer.  
 
7:30 He's Louisiana through and through.  
 
7:50 The pedigree in Kentucky and New York are better. There are 
better sire lines and better dams. The bluegrass and limestone make a 
better type of horse. The quality of Louisiana breeds has improved in the 
past few years. He believes that they'll be some Louisiana Breeds on the 
National scene soon.  
 
9:33 He is out at the track early and it keeps his heart pumping.  
 
9:56 End of interview.
