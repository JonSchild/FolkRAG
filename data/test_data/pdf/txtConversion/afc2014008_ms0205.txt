 Dear Ralph:
 
I had wanted to talk to you about this when we met in Washington, but there was
 
no time.  Actually, I
tshould perhaps be addressing myself to Bob Byington; please
 
pass i
t a
long, or swap i
t, or make i
t into a "Dear B
ob" or whatever would be most
 
appropriate.  I just wanted to pass a
long an i
dea about the Centennial.
 
i
I
t seems to me that part of the Centennial planning -
- s
ince i
t seems inevitable
 
that most of the action, folklorically speaking, will take place i
n Washington -
-
should be concerned with providing take-home materiels that can themselves dis-
seminate t
o remoter areas some of the educational processes that we all hope will
 
occur at the 1
976 bash.  I am thinking in terms of publications that will i
nclude
 
a
) sources to which community people can write for further information
 
—,\ on specific topics covered within the festival
 
b
) bibliographical reference l
ists on particular festival features
 
c
) l
ists of regional reference s
ources -
- important museums, l
ocal
 
f
olklore and historical societies, s
tate university programs and the l
ike.
 
I
n addition, I
'd l
ike to suggest a special publication series to consist of a
 
number of pamphlets each addressed to a separate e
thnic sub-group in the United
 
States.  Each would contain a special informational d
irectory to include the
 
kinds of s
ource information l
isted aboverp but most importantly i
t should contain
 
a discussion of the special contributions and special character of the group
 
addressed.  The data for the latter section should be gathered from two sources:
 
a historian/folklorist, and the wealth of i
nformation pulled together i
n the
 
cantometrics-choreometrics data bank.
 
I have had s
everal occasions to watch the process of working with the cantometrics-
choreometrics•data in terms of specific cultural problems, and the results have
 
been impressive indeed.  I once pointed out to Alan that I had found that the
 
Chicano s
tudents with whom I work in California had a view of their own musical
 
heritage which I regarded as both spiritually depressing and factually untrue.
 
Specifically, they felt that Mexican music was s
imply the result of European
 
(
hispanic) oppression upon native I
ndian populations and, a
s a result, what Mexican
 
music amounted to was s
imply pathetic and untutored attempts to i
mitate Spanish
 
music, carried out by "
ignorant" Indians.  Thus these young people were in the
 
painful position of feeling they should down-grade the music they really l
oved
 
(
mariachis, rancheras and the l
ike) in order to support what they considered to
 
be "real" Mexican music (
Huichol, Yaqui, etc.) which didn't actually speak to them.
 
When I mentioned this to Alan as a genuine cultural dilemma, he went to his computer
 
f
iles and pulled out a
ll the profiles of Spanish and Spanish-influenced South
 
American musics plus all the profiles of middle-American Indian music, plus a
ll the
 
profiles of contemporary Mexican regional s
tyles and -
- by comparison -
- came up
 
1
 
BLit -
2
 
specific statements of those a
spects of Mexican music which etbarly demonstrate
 
the creative contributions, the special brand-newness of that national musical
 
system.  On the basis of this, i
t was possible to s
tate in a completely definably
 
way that Mexican music represents a s
tyle totally distinctive to that land, a new
 
cultural contribution, a s
tyle which exists in no other place in the world.
 
I think that this kind of i
nformation -
- and there's barrels more of it if you
 
include the dance factors plus all the others Alan's been working with -
- should
 
be more widely disseminated than Alan has been able to do through academic publi-
cation.  The really beautiful thing about his system, you see, i
s that every
 
feature of i
t i
s positive -
- e
very profile represents a unique structure of the
 
human potential, each one specially suited to the needs of the people i
t serves.
 
I think that Alan would jump at a chance to make his f
indings available to the
 
people whose cultural property they represent, and I think that his f
indings
 
!
would make every ethnic population in the United States feel that they are truly
 
special and truly beautiful, each in their own way.  This seems to me what the
 
Centennial celebration should be about.  Why not talk to him about i
t?
 
All the best.  I
t was nice to see you at the NEA session, even for s
o short a time.
 
I
 
As ever,

SUGGESTED RESTATEMENT OF OLD WAYS IN THE NEW WORLD RATIONALE
 
The United States of America is preparing to celebrate its 200th birthday.
 
This celebration will take many forms,  for we are a diverse people.  Many
 
groups, both public and private, will  select differing aspects of our
 
culture, our history, our peculiar and special national experience, as
 
themes for their activities,  focussing variously upon our industrial
 
productivity, the words of our national heroes, our schools of painting
 
and other cultivated arts,  the features of our landscape.
 
The Festival of American Folk Life,  to be presented by the Smithsonian
 
Institution during the summer of 1976,  is only one of the many celebratory
 
activities planned across the breadth of the nation.
 Because the Smithsonian
 
is the national museum and thus a scientific institution, the Festival
 
will concentrate upon the process of self-examination that inevitably
 
accompanies any anniversary.
 Its focus will be limited and specific;
 
it will examine the traditional arts -- the songs, dances,  stories,  foodways,
 
crafts -- all the hand and heart skills which are the anonymous possessions
 
of the anonymous citizens of this nation.
 These are the springs from which
 
our popular and cultivated arts flow; they convey the central
 
of our democracy.
 
The United States is particularly rich in such trad  '
ional home-crafted
 
arts because,  since the people now called America
 ndians crossed the
 
Bering Straits into an empty continent thousands .f years ago, we have
 
always been a country of immigrants and,  thus, , e proud inheritors of
 
the artistic styles of many different peoples.
 One of the sections of
 
the Festival of American Folk Life deals with this particular feature
 
of United States culture;  it is called,  "Old Ways in the New World"
 
the sons and daughters of
 
In th
 =_______ (
only^* part of the entire Festival), we bring together/
 
xiiigiRms who i m
migrated to the United States from various parts of the
 
world  and their cultural cousins who stayed at home.  These two groups
 
join together in the practice of their axtiskixzaadzxzxakaxa traditional
 
artistic and creative behavior;  thus they can
 celebrate
 
a kind of family reunion while they examine together the changes that
 
their different experiences have brought about.

our underlying research along the general line of cognates,

we attempt to find and bring together people from the same
 
the same village -

�oth those who emigrated and those who
 
Where the tragedies ol Vil
sitory make the exact identification
 
of two such groups impossible or simply impractical, we turn our attention
 
to the examination of cognate behavior, and paint on a larger canvas.
 For
 
example,  though it is impossible to trace back the ancestry of most Afro-
Americans to their original tribes, we can still
. observe the transference
 
of African polyrhythm to the new world by presenting a hand-clapping Georgia
 
black congregation alongside of a Yoruba drum choir.
 The same parallels
 
can be found in all aspects of traditional behavior,  from cooking to dance.
 
We think this is a healthy kind of self-examination for our domestic peoples,
 
who draw strength from discovering their relationship with older cultures,
 
and for our foreign guests, who can return to their homeland proud of the
 
virility of their own art forms which remain clearly identifiable though
 
removed by oceans of time and space.
 
This kind of healthful comparison can, of course, be made on almost any
 
level of behavior.  We find the parallels stand out most clearly, however,
 
when we are able to present our most genuinely traditional performers,
 
those whose music or dance or handicraft springs directly from a particular
 
community, unaffected by complexities of other than face-to-face communication.
 
Such traditional artists are found mostly among working people -- farmers,
 
miners, housewives, people who work with their hands.  We are not interested
 
in the interpreters of traditional art; their many contributions can be
 
seen in our picture galleries and heard in our concert halls.
 In our
 
outdoor festival among the trees near the Lincoln Memorial, we bring
 
together the ordinary, though at the same time very special, citizens of
 
the world to join together in a people-to-people celebration.
 
We also feel this is a very appropriate commemoration of the birthday of
 
our nation, originally peopled not by the educated or the aristocracy,
 
but by ordinary men and women from many parts of the world, wise in the
 
ways of their forebears.  This accumulated wisdom mxdf
fxxMaxtxY*za8dzthis
 
Enstixaix has helped shape our destiny; and the Festival of American
 
Folk Life is in part a way of acknowledging our debt to the many peoples
 
of the world who came together to build this new nation.
 
Underneath the rhetoric, this statement contains the following points
 
which might be stressed in various ways.
 
1.
 There are many things which can be celebrated; FAF is only doing one
 
of them (
you might get in on one of the others).
 
2.  The entire focus of FAF is on traditional expression.
 
3.
 Traditional expression is scientifically a useful point of departure
 
because each folksong, dance, etc. is a compact package expressing the
 
basic ideas of a people, their particular way of doing or being.
 
4.
 Cultivated or "high" art derives from folk or traditional art.
 
5.  Folk arts are most clearly expressed by traditional artists, rather
 
than by revival or interpretive artists.
 
6.
 Traditional artists are almost invariably people who spend most of their
 
time doing something else, and thus are largely from the working class.
 
7.
 In OWNW we examine cognate people and/or cognate behavior (
including
 
the physical results of that behavior,  such as arti
 ts, musical instruments
 
and the like).
 
8.
 The Festival is people, rather than thing, centered.

Dear Ralph, Rayna, Mac et al,
 
There was something in the back of my head during our recent phone conversation
 
that was bothering me, but I couldn't l
ocate it until I woke up this morning.
 
I
t centered around our discussion of the California urban l
ife style, but that
 
wasn't really it.
 
I
t all coalesced for me when I was visualizing the Berkeley mud flat sculptures
 
and how such artifacts might be presented on the mall; and it kept seeming to me
 
that in the mall setting, they would look exactly l
ike what they are -
- junk.
 
The reason they.are so moving when you see them as you drive along that dreary
 
mud flat i
s that they, demonstrate man's e
ternal determination to transcend
 
disorder and decay,  But junk sculpture, to make a significant emotional statement,
 
has to stay where junk i
s, where it comes from, where junk is born, where it's
 
what you have on hand to work with.  Otherwise, it's just another exploitative
 
attempt at self-titti
:lation.  I never understood why totem poles were considered
 
beautiful -
- they had always seemed to me garish and freaky -
- until I saw one
 
in a deep forest, where it belongs to be.  Though I had never confessed, even
 
to myself, the fact that I didn't l
ike totem poles, when I saw one in its natural
 
place I realized that my reaction hadn't been anti-Indian or anything, but on a
 
much deeper aesthetic level.
 
The Watts towers are another case in point; they are beautiful because they are
 
in Watts, in that desolate, featureless, trash-littered urban sprawl.  They were
 
forced out of the earth, it always seems to me , by the creative human fires that
 
burn forever underneath that particular spot on the earth's surface.  But if the
 
Towers had been put up.anywhere e
lse , say in Santa Monica in my rather undistin-
guished surburban neighborhood or over by UCLA, they would l
ook l
ike the junk of
 
which they are constructed, and I would probably have signed the neighborhood
 
protest petition.
 
The reason I am belaboring this i
s because for me it's a crucial point.  I am
 
not suggesting that "those people" have their art and it's all very nice for them,
 
u
bt not for me, and so I want it l
eft in "their" neighborhood.  I am suggesting
 
that we must be very careful and quite clear in our conception of what we really
 
want to say about art and life, which i
s, I believe, that they are organically
 
connected.  And thus we have to be extraordinarily cautious when we take art
 
out of its context -
- and this applies, of course, to music and dance as well.
 
There's something intrinsically insulting to me about seeing junk art in, say,
 
a museum context.  I guess it comes from an episode in my old days as an Almanac
 
when some ordinary union folks in Detroit came to us and said they wished we would
 
dress up more when we sang at union meetings because they always put on their best
 
c
lothes when they came to hear us.  We had thought we were looking as though we
 
were of the people; they thought we were being condescending.  An awful lot of
 
hippie art strikes me the same way -
- as a kind of insult to people who don't have
 
anything more refined to work with, but who wish l
ike hell that they had.
 
I not only f
ind �np/hippie art insulting and boring, to me it represents a middle=
 
class attempt to celebrate chaos; and it's to the advantage of the middle c
lass to
 
celebrate chaos because in a chaotic s
ituation, frankly, they can f
ind more and
 
easier ways to make a quick buck.  Working class people don't celebrate chaos;
 
chaos i
s their enemy.  They make profoundly serious attempts to examine their l
ife
 
pattern as it i
s and as it can be, in order to make it more serious ,
 more profound,
 
V
 
more beautiful, more joyous, more meaningful.  The Watts towers are a meaningful
 
statement in a working-class context; pulled out of context, they'd be in danger
 
of looking l
ike a cheap orange julius stand.  Maybe we can show them -
- and the
 
mud flat sculptures as well with photographs, but they'd have to be awfully,
 
awfully good ones.
 —
 
Dammit, I really want this to be a working-class festival.  I want everything
 
in it to be a celebration of the common man, of his creativity and eternal
 
restless pursuit of meaning and coherence and dignity.  That's why I
'm so hung
 
up on the cable car bell ringers; they seem to me a microcosm of what we want
 
to demonstrate.  Here are people working with the every-day of their experience,
 
taking something they have to do every five minutes as part of their job, and
 
adding to it that tiny injection of human passion and aesthetic impulse that
 
distinguishes man from the other primates.  Admittedly 
, it's not high art, but
 
it's real, and it is all we really have to celebrate.
 �

�►a �
':,�- d
v
 
So I don't want the California presentation to be a pop art celebration; I
 
don't want it even to smell l
ike a pop art celebration.  Every single artistic
 
presentation we make has to come out of the basic working-class l
ife fabric -
-
not out of the ad-man, quick-and-shoddy, self-indulgent "mainstream" that so
 
often spells "California" -
- and it has to be presented so as to demonstrate
 
its clear relationship with that l
ife fabric and seem logical and inevitable
 
and marvellous because of that recognizable relationship.
 
You probably either already know all this or e
lse profoundly disagree.  However,
 
it seemed to me that in our telephone conversation we were drifting -
- myself
 
included -
- in some very peculiar directions, and I wanted to write this mostly
 
to straighten my own thinking out.  I
'd be glad to hear your reactions.

P
.S.  After re-reading this, I honestly don't know whether I
'm setting up a
 
straw man or throwing down a gauntlet.  Some days I feel the generation gap more
 
poignantly than others.  But I did want you to know where I stand -
- and I wanted
 
me to know where I stand -
- so that a decision can be made as to whether this
 
kind of perspective is what should be brought to bear on the California presenta-
tion.  As far as I
'm concerned, I
'm afraid it's the only perspective I
've got
 
handy, or ever will have for that matter.  In one l
ife, there's a l
imit to how
 
far down the road you can see...

I intend to speak very briefly to you this afternoon.  My task
 
is f
irst to outline the dimensions of that extraordinary cultural
 
adventure -
- the Festival of American Folklife 4 which i
s presented
 
annually in Washington, D
.C. by the Smithsonian I
nstitution.  My
 
second job i
s to get rapidly out of the way of Tom Vennum, who will
 
both show and tell some of the musical results of that adventure.
 
Afterwards, both of us will be available for questions from the f
loor.
 
I find very few of my colleagues, e
ither folklorists or e
thno-
musicologists, know anything at a
ll about the Festival.  The general
 
impression, as far a
s I can tell, i
s that it consists of a few banjo
 
pickers and a b
lues s
inger or two s
itting under a tree somekhere in
 
Washington for a few days during the summer.  Let me try to correct
 
that impression.
 
I
t i
s the largest outdoor festival devoted exclusively to
 
traditional arts in the world.  Last summer, during the 1
0 day run of
 
the 1
975 Festival, some 7
0,000 people attended i
t.  During the summer
 
of 1
976 when the Festival, in celebration of the B
icentennial, will
 
last for 1
2 weeks, we will host some 800 traditional performers from
 
every part of the g
lobeeach week (
that's some d
J600 overall) and goodness
 
knows how many people will come to hear them.
 
The Festival i
s completely free.  I
t i
s a serious educational
 
endeavor mounted by the national museum of the United States for the

ong at
 
no cost whatever.  Every day of the Festival week (
from Wednesday through
 
Sunday), six or seven sound stages are in continuous operation between
 
the hours of 1
1 a
.m. and 5
:00 p
.m. with a two hour evening concert l
asting
 
until 8
:00.  The people performing on those s
tages are a
ll traditional
 
2
.
 
companies or folkloricos are invited; the performers are individually
 
selected by Smithsonian field workers or by folklorists and/or e
thno-
musicologists from the various foreign countries invited.
 
The Festival takes place a
long the s
ide of the reflecting pool
 
which l
ies between the Washington Monument and the L
incoln Memorial,
 
under the trees.  I
t i
s divided into a number of sections.  One of
 
them, Regional America, during the 1
2 weeks of the summer of 1
976,
 
will present the traditional folkways to be found in the 5
0 s
tates,
 
including Hawaii, Alaska, and, hopefully, American Samoa and the
 
Marshalls or the Marianas.  In the Native American section, 60 I
ndian
 
crafts workers and musicians will each week present the art of a different
 
indigenous tribal area.  Working America brings traditional American
 
workingmens' folklore to the mall, each week s
tressing a different set
 
of industries and crafts.
 
Of perhaps the most interest to this society are the l
ast two
 
major sections of the Festival -
- Old Ways in the New World and African
 
Diaspora.  In Old Ways, the e
thnic heritage of Americans i
s featured;
 
each week two d
ifferent European or Asian countries are invited to send
 
a delegation of 2
5 of their traditional artists to celebrate on the mall
 
jointly with their American descendants, who are represented in equal
 
number.  African Diaspora mounts an even more complex program, bringing
 
in s
imultaneously performers from B
lack Africa, from the B
lack traditions
 
of Latin America and from the B
lack United States.  During the 1
976
 
festival, these two programs together will import traditional musicians
 
and artists from 36 foreign countries.  A summer-long visit by any of your
 
s
tudents to the Festival would be the e
quivalent of -
- well, I won't guess
 
how many academic units -
- but I must point out the advantages of the fact
 
that our music and musicians are a
ll a
live and available for questions
  
From my own point of view -
- that of a person who
 
only recently joined the Festival staff -
-  the most remarkable
 
thing about the entire enterprise i
s ht that it happens at all.
 
I
t i
s probably the most complex piece of cultural engineering
 
ever to have been undertaken by Americans,  and until quite
 
recently it was managed almost entirely by Ralph Rinzler,
 
the Festival director, and a literal handful of staff, almost
 
none of whom could be described a
s professionals in an academic
 
sense.
 Only this year have we obtained the fulltime services
 
of an ethnomusicologist, in the person of Tom Vennum and quite
 
recently also we have enlisted the aid of a number of dixtixgxix
 
distinguished advisors: David McAllester, Al Ortiz, Conrad
 
Arensberg, Alan Lomax, Halim El Dabh, ,,
among others.
 
The main reason the festival works, in my opinion,
 
is because of what it does, rather
 
salutory lesson for an academic to
 
clear and simple and devastatingly
 
not because they are intrinsically
 
than who does it -
- a
 
learn.
 Its principles are
 
difficult to bring off,
 
so hard but because they
 
run exactly counter to so many powerful forces in contemporary
 
life.
 
The Festival is not show biz and it makes no con-
y
 
cessions to the forces of show biz.,\ It i
s not high culture
 
either and it makes no such pretensions.
 The Festival puts
 
its money into people rather than into things;  there are no
 
glass cases and very few photographs -
- the people are there
 
in person.
 The Festival says that ordinary people, when
 
working within their own cultural tradition, produce
 
extraordinary art, and they are right there doing it in front
 
of you.
 Finally,  the Festival takes sides:  it i
s not
 
interested in
 ethnographic
 
truth, whatever that may be. q It i
s not concerned with

The original charge to develop the Festival was
 
enunciated by S
.  Dillon Ripley, the present Secretary of
 
the Smithsonian, who took office}
} in 1964.
 Prior to his
 
�
1G d
 
Secretaryship,  the Smithsonian
 1had, of course, a long-time
 
commitment to ethnology, exemplified by the establishment
 
of the Bureau of Indian Ethnology in 1879 and such pioneer
 
recording efforts a
s those of Frances Densmore.
 During
 
Ripley's ten years of tenure, however,  the Institution took
 
on a major commitment to the establishment of Nxx outreach
 
programs, a serious attempt to break down the walls of the
 
museum and let the folks in, not only in Washington but across
 
the country.
 One of these outreach programs was the Folklife
 
Festival, designed,  in R'ipley's phrase to establish "an
 
outdoor l
iving museum on the Mall".
 The f
irst Festival took
 
place in 1
967;  it has been presented annually ever since;
 
the biggest -
-  and quite possibly the last -
- Festival will
 
occur next summer.
 
When you watch the films of the 1975 Festival which
 
Tom will presently be showing you,  I think you will be impressed

Tom and I
,  a

hope that you will take our Festival equally seriously, as
 
an opportunity for education and learning on a truly massive
 
scale.
 We need your help, your expertise, and your ideas.
 
And most of all, we hope that you and your students will come
 
and join us next summer on the mall.
 Whatever week you come,
 
we can promise m you that you will meet some 8

traditional artists -
- craftspeople, cooks, musicians, story
 
tellers  -
- and that you will come away refreshed and encouraged,
 
your faith in your discipline renewed.
 
MEMORANDUM
 
May 26,  1976
 
TO
 Jim Morris,  Ralph rRinzler,  Bob Byington
 
FROM
 Bess Hawe6
 
SUBJECT:
 Funding shortages for domestic participation in
 
OWNW and miscellaneous budget items
 
Pursuant to my memo of May 13,  Susan Kalcik,  Tom
 
Vennum and I have reviewed intensively the programmatic
 
effect of the reduction of Old Ways domestic participant
 
numbers from 25 to 23 to 18.
 In some cases,  the
 
programatic  effect was negligible;  in others,  nearly
 
catastrophic.
 The factors responsible for this variation
 
are:
 
a
.
 The complexity of the particular national unit.
 
Some nations are relatively monochromatic  (
e.g.  Hungary,
 
Scandinavia);  others are extremely complex in cultural
 
makeup  (
e.g.  Israel;  Egypt.)
 
b.
 The number of invitations sent out prior to the
 
reduction.
 In some cases,  20 or more invitations had
 
already been issued  (
e.g.  Ireland,  India.)
 Since we cannot
 
renege on our official word,  additional cuts in other
 
programs had to be taken,  or further economies in
 
presentation costs sought.
 
C.
 Personal commitments by field workers.
 Many of
 
our field workers,  all professional folklorists and
 
ethnomusicologists of standing in their disciplines, have
 
understandings with the participants they located which,
 
although not yet confirmed by formal invitation,  amount
 
to a commitment by the Smithsonian.
 They have warned us
 
that not only their personal reputations may be at stake
 
here but ours as well.
 
d.
 Programmatic balance.
 In certain cases  (
e.g.
 
Portugal,  Israel)  large groups have already been invited on
 
the assumption by the field worker  that additional elements
 
(up to the original number of 23) were to be added.
 Allowing
 
such programs to be filled out only to the number of 18
 
seriously skews the programmatic content of several
 
presentations.
 Some of our most respected professional field
 
-2-
workers  (
e.g.  Barbara Kirschenblatt-Gimblett,  professor
 
at the University of Pennsylvania; Nazir J
.airazbhoy,
 
professor at the University of California and President
 
of the Society for Ethnomusicology)  are in despair over
 
what they view to be an intolerable distortion of the
 
programs they had planned with such care,  (
Israel,  India,
 
Pakistan.)
 
e.
 Participant morale.
 When informed of the cut to
 
18,  many groups of participants have offered to pool their
 
per diem fees in order to bring the complete contingent,
 
and pay the additional transportation and the $18.00 per
 
day Georgetown fee themselves.
 Staff have already made
 
plans to house some of these extra folks to keep down
 
participant costs.
 Some groups,  such as the Portugese
 
dance group from Hartford are already soliciting funds on
 
their own to defray their costs.
 One field worker has
 
volunteered to stay home from the Festival if her expected
 
fee can be used to bring in the participants who have been
 
cut.
 Such extraordinary endeavors and sacrifices speak
 
to the extent of concern felt by both participants and
 
field workers.
 It is an encouraging development;  however,
 
inequality of treatment offered to participants must
 
inevitably lead to a lowering of morale.
 
Finally,  a special area of concern is the Italian
 
presentation.
 At a recent meeting the Supervisory group
 
agreed to eliminate the final week of the Old Ways program
 
as a money-saving device.
 The rationale was that
 
Czechoslovakia had cancelled and the Italian government
 
had offered only a token representation  (
five million
 
lire--enough for a delegation of 3 or 4
.)
 T
ile assumption
 
was that we would fit Italy in somewhere else in the
 
program.
 
However,  no other country has yet cancelled,  and we
 
are in the highly embarrassing position of having no funds
 
to mount even a domestic presentation.
 T
ile Italians,  it
 
is  true, did appear on the Mall last summer; however,  the
 
success of the Italian program stimulated the domestic
 
community to even greater efforts in anticipation of the
 
 
1
 
-3-
Bicentennial year program.
 They began practicing last
 
August,  immediately after the Mall program,  and a
 
cancellation by the Smithsonian at this  late date would result,
 
I am afraid,  in tremendous disappointment to the large
 
and politically powerful Italian community.
 I recommend
 
in the strongest terms that funds for the Italian
 
presentation be identified and reserved so that they can
 
be held as a fall back for a foreign country that might
 
fall out.
 If no other opportunity presents itself,  they
 
can be brought in the last week of the Festival.
 
Beyond these expenses,  there are the following
 
miscellaneous budgetary items for which no funds have so
 
far been identified:
 
a.
 Ethnic community publication  (
to be sold at
 
the Festival--we anticipate recovering this
 
cost from sales)
 
b.
 Tape stock for recording the Festival
 
C.
 Main stage programming for weeks 9 - 12
 
d.
 Referring to Bob and Ralph's April 26th memo
 
to you on the Regional deficit, we continue
 
to sustain a $50,000 deficit for instrument
 
handling which was removed from the Regional
 
budget.
 For details see Beverly Robinson's
 
April 26th memo to Ralph,  Bob and Bess which
 
was  forwarded to you that same day.

The following is a list, as I see them, of the program-related

present budget.  We have been instructed, I understand, that we must
 
honor our commitments to foreign nations; it is equally crucial that
 
we honor our commitments to the domestic participants who are the
 
essential subjects of our Bicentennial celebration.

t
 
SUBJECT:
 Italian Presentation
 
DATE:
 26 May 1976
 
The following considerations may ease the problem concerning the
 
Italian presentation raised in my memo of this morning.
 
1
)
 It now appears that the decision to cancel the Belgian tour
 
is inevitable.
 No bookings whatever have been obtained for this
 
tour, and the Belgian Embassy is to be advised of the necessity of
 
this cancellation.
 It is therefore possible that the Belgian
 
Government may cancel its participation in the Festival,  since they
 
may not wish to pay transportation for a single week's stay on the
 
Mall alone.
 
Should this occur, the Italian domestic presentation
 
(
total cost:
 $l0,OQ0)  could be mounted in place of the Belgian
 
(now budgeted at
 
2
)
 Should Belgium not cancel, my recommendation is to schedule
 
an Italian presentation on the main stage for three to four hours
 
a day during the final week of the Festival.  Week Twelve is a diffi-
cult week at best,  since Old Ways has been cancelled and only one
 
foreign nation =- Senegal -- will be present in Diaspora.
 
In the event this plan is followed, I would recommend programming
 
the p
i_-ppet show in the Children's Area tent adjacent to the main
 
stage as that area will be down to minimum operation the last two
 
weeks.

 Ralph feels there is no problem in disengaging from the
 
remaining shadowy involvement with the Italian government.

Concerning the L
ebanese f
ield tapes , encbosed herewith , i
t seems to
 
me we could do better . The Kaslik chorus does indeed have a woman
 
s
oloist with an e
xquisite voice and a beautifully subtle near-Eastern
 
s
tyle (or maybe i
t 's two women?
).  However the unison chorus and the
 
a
ccompanying orchestra seem bland and l
ifeless ;
 my impression i
s that
 
this i
s due to the fact that they are attempting a re-creation of an
 
h
istoric repertoire and s
tyle.  They are probably doing i
t very well,
 
but the effort s
eems to show . I
t's sort of conscientious music.  I
 
can s
ee that their work might well be of real interest to U
.S. Arabic
 
s
cholars ,
 but I
 hesitate to recommend i
t as a representation of
 
Lebanese l
ife-style for the general public.
 
The village group i
s l
ivelier, in fact so l
ively that I couldn't hear
 
much on the tape.  They certainly have some good i
nstrumentalists, but
 
that's about a
ll that c
ame through.  The thing that disturbs me here i
s
 
the fact mentioned both in Tony 's f
ield report and by the Lebanese
 
cultural a
ttache that they are a semi-military group and that much of
 
their dance s
eems to revolve around the martial arts and mimed battle.
 
This s
trikes me a
s risky in the extreme , e
specially when dealing with
 
the middle-east during this historical period.  Who knows what will be
 
going on i
n that part of the world by July of 1
975?
 
S
ince this martial arts business came up in the case of the Japanese-
American Taikko drummers a
lso, I
 might as well speak my piece.  I am
 
aware that much performing art throughout the world has derived from
 
mock combat ,
 but I do think we should keep our political wits about us,
 
and I do think we should keep our intentions f
irmly f
ixed on the general
 
goal of i
ncreasing human understanding . I don't think that festival goers
 
over 5
0 will be made more receptive to Japanese-American culture if they
 
see a great deal of sword waving and hear a l
ot of "Banzai " shouting or
 
whatever i
t i
s; (
the video-tape I saw both scared and depressed me, at l
east).
 
Nor do I think that half of what we bring to represent the people of Lebanon
 
should feature a
ggressive behavior . We have to be selective anyway; why
 
not s
elect t
owards the ordinary and the e
very day and the sociable? Everybody
 
has s
ome such behaviors -
- even the I
k of Uganda (
?) who are s
tarving to
 
death and s
pend most of their t
ime s
tealing food by one means or another
 
I
 understand.
 
I
'm not suggesting that we present a totally roseate and pacific view of
 
the world ; I
'm just recommending that we not r
isk increasing the already
 
ugly amount of paranoia felt about some areas of the world.

Dear Ralph:
 I
'll be talking with you soon, but won't have time to fill you in
 
on all that is to follow.
 There are the usual numbers of alarums and excursions
 
but quite a few achievements as well.
 I
'll start out with what's going well.
 
OWNW.
 I spoke to Worman in Mexico; he was most friendly but cannot
 
do the whole job for us (either Mexico or the Hispanic program) because of prior
 
commitments.  However, he will advise and intends to stand by Irene Vasquex who
 
he says can do most of the running around.  We are going to write today and see
 
if he will fly to New Orleans and join us there for at least an evening's meeting.
 
This plus the meeting mix-XkH with the Mexican ambassador et al (
see Pat's report)
 
will obviate the necessity of your going to Mexico.
 
Vennum appears to be flapping around in Switzerland having the typical
 
communication problems but otherwise seems okay.
 Svatava is ready to leave,
 
seems in fine shape except for her back which she's growing accustomed to. Shirley
 
is -working --
up El Dabh's contract covering Turkey and Nigeria; a contract is being
 
prepared for Chianis for Greece.
 Byelawsky has been assigned to work with you
 
in Poland.  We will start Anna's contract after I talk with you.
 
RA.
 Two more field workers have sent in tapes; I
've not listened to
 
them but Rayna and Bill both report they are excellent, especially Tulles'.
 I
'll
 
get work to yuu when I next write.
 
ADAG.
 Admisory committee seems stronger, though the level is still
 
medium-low but they are planning with
. care and thoroughness and are planning to
 
spend some money on domestic stuff to my relief.
 They invited me to sit in
 
and relations are friendly and professional.
 Bob took over the day I couldn't
 
come.
 They want Renee Lopez and Lionel to do Puerto-Rican/Cuban field work in
 
New York.
 
NA.
 Still no progress on an anthropologist.
 I shall go over next week
 
and talk to Bill Sturtevant in the guise of a professional-soci_31 visit.
 
WA.  McCarl is out in the field.  A rather charming sign has appeared
 
on the office mail box "Please put the Wall Street Journal into the Working
 
American's mailbox".
 Shirley A. doesn't understand why everyone thinks it °r
, _
fruo�oy .
 
CA appears to be in good condition as far as I can discover.
 There will be another
 
AFL CIO meeting in another couple of weeks and Bob and I shall attend.
 
MISCELLANEOUS.  Alan Lester is back, and things have picked up a bit.
 
We had a budget meeting last week at which Bob s ported a 14% deficit (
shortfall)
 
between the revised program budgets and the amount of hard money we seem to have
 
Jim has agreed to try to raise half of this (
7%) and we are to try to cut back
 
7%.
 Bob thinks there is some fat in the revised budgets, and I suggested that
 
at the absolute worst, we plan to cut out all documentation, on the grounds that
 
we should be successful in appealing for outside funding on such an important
 
issue.  No real action will be taken on any of this, of course, until you return,
 
but I think it's a positive step to have some realism in our financial picture.
 
On the question of shortening the festival, Bob suggested that cutting to 8 weeks
 
was fiscal overkill, and Jim agreed to initiate the long process of feeling out
 
reaction on cutting to 10.
 In the meantime, we are to stick with the 12 week
 
format, and the 10 is not to be discussed outside the supervisory group.
 
We are negotiating with the local educational TV station which wants
 
to produce a series (
9 programs or so) about the festival; I called a folklorists
 
meeting on the point and we thrashed out a policy I think we can live with.
 Next
 
Week I am calling another to discuss the program book contents and some revision
 
on the :rx t
.v. proposal.
 Alan Lester is negotiating with American Airlines on
 
tie movie theater idea; I have discussed my ideas on the subject and he will get
 
back Lo me.
 
As for problems, there are a few, mostly predictable.
 :
C do not want
 
you to worry about them or cut short your trip or any reaction so severe.
 Bob and
 
I are working together with considerable precision and harmony; however, we
 
discussed these few points and decided jointly that you should know about them in
 
order to give us your guidance, should they come to a head.
 
CALIFORNIA.  The California folks did indeed seek a lawyer who wrote
 
a polite enquiry to Ripley, and there has been much running about and consulting.
 
Ed Dye and Bill McNeill, in particular, seem t
o have gone onto the defensive, though
 
I
've suggested to both that we should use this situation to our own advantage,
 
thrusting the letter under the noses of the auditors and,the-folks upstairs, saying
 
"
See, that's what happens to us when things get so balled up upstairs".  Ed mutters
 
direly about nepotism, and the like (
mostly not to me); I think we have pretty
 
well, between Bob and me, killed the gossip, but there it is.  Tomorrow I intend
 
to have -
a word with R Jim .
if the opportunity arises.  I do not feel in the least
 
personally attacked or insecure, so for heaven's sakes, don't worry about that.
 
I just think it's a factor in the next point.
 
AFS MEETING.  As you remember, you, Bob and I recommended that all
 
folklorists go to the meeting.  In the meantime a memo came down from some weighty
 
type in the Castle -saying no -non-essential travel especially to academic meetings.
 
Jim read both and reacted predictably, appointing you, me, Rayna, Bernice, Charley,
 
Bob B abd Bob M
_
.to represent the troops.  Boh and I argued several t
imes to no
 
avail, so we put out a memo announcing same plus the rationale behind i
t.
 (
I'll
 
enclose).- Neither of '
us thought Jim's position irresponsible, just wrong.  Anyway,
 
the news was taken pretty badly, especially by Bill McNeill and Susan Kalchik, both
 
of whom announced in one way o
r another that they would not extend themselves for
 
the institution if it wouldn't extend itself for them.  This slightly juvenile
 
reaction would probably have blown itself away except that Bill uxiarmtxasetyz
 
unfortunately f
ldxA told Suzanne that he wouldn't watch the SI film to im identify
 
a fiddler on accout of he didn't want to do anything "extra" because he couldn't
 
go to AFS,  Suzanne memoed Bob and me about this unfortunate event; I hope y i
t
 
didn't get any farther,  Both Bob and I feel.in our bones that Rayna is pushing this
 
reaction; she.said something to Bob about the "
truth" coming out at AFS or some s
uch.
 
_Z.am__goln&,te..tackle_-Susan K, on the l
ixog problem on Monday, and Bob will take on
 
Bill.
.  Still, this is all involved in
 
RA MORALE. .There is just something still wrong there.  The only other
 
factual info I have_on
. what's going on and why is that Rayna and Ruth had an argu-
ment about outside contacts resulting in the problem being brought up at a super-
visory meeting which- is scheduled for this week.  I
'll let you know what the new
 
rulings will be.  Anyway, there is still something wrong there; my stocks seems to
 
'
 gone up, but  
 
OWNW,  The amount of anti-field-work gossip has gotten beyond countenancing
 
and I intend to.have.a friendly but frank session with Shirley about it, jus t
 
saying firmly that it is.unprof
 essional of her to allow such gossip among her staff.
 
My v
 iew:will be that Shirley has every right, indeed a duty, to point out the
 
operational weaknesses of field workers before they are hired; however, once that
 
hire has been made .the staff's duty is to support the field worker and this cannot
 
take place in an atmosphere where they are run down continually.  I think I may
 
take the risk of
 t elling her about Svatava's back trouble, as part of the unpleasantness
 
seems to,center around her, but they're still going on about Anna, and Tom now Tom,
 
and it simply must stop as a general principle.  Incidentally, Pat, who has more
 
cause to complain than anywne, dt sznas does not bitch all the time, and it is
 
really a pleasure to work S with someone who is rationally discreet and keeps his
 
private views to himself, and when I get a chance, I shall tell him so,
 (
His
 
lettersa are just as bad as ever but he never complains when they're rewritten.)
 
(Monday at the office)  I can't think of any other problems except that Joanne
 
Purcell is still tearing up the turf, writing us 12 page proposals listing all the
 
performers she can think of in any x number of combinations, calling various
 
PortugueseAAmericana officials and so on.  I have asked her politely but firmly
 
to cease and desist byziestvz until you get back (
in letter form so she can get
 
it in her head)
_.  I shall include some of her stuff f
.y.i, unless it's too bulky
 
to send; you might like to look some of it over before hitting Ram Portugal again.
 
And if -you think I
'm being alarm
ist in sen ding  her  my  letter, don't hesitate to say
 
so; I just don't want her
. to run off.with the entir e ball game
 before  you  have  a 
chance to-conclude tour negotiations.with Lisbon and Lopes-Graca.
 
I got both your long letters and thank you very much for them.
 It is good always
 
to hear from you, especially when you seem to be slashing through the red tape in
 
such bravura style, having such interesting sessions with folklorists and generally
 
functioning on the top level that you always do.
 I do agree that you're doing
 
exactly the part of the job-you should and that no one else could do it one-half
 
as well.
 I also.want you to feel that I am functioning reasonable well and
 
generally -without harrassment; my w
sxxxx only real concerns, in terms of problem
 
solving during your absence, really revolve around the intangible factors of
 
:office morale.
 I think you could address those issues far better than I, but
 
I also don't think they are severe enought to keep h you from going away.
 I shall
 
try to tread water here.
 
(( lAs for my personal reactions, my own morale is high; I find the problems interesting
 
(
� `
`
'and not infrequently entertaining, so don't worry about me in any way shape or form.
 
(JUst stopped to answer the phone -- it was that gxx gentleman who wanted to set
 
up the printing press on-the mall; I mentioned the humidity problem to him and he
 
�
\J
said he was thinking of a Mississippi country press that could run under
- water .
..
 
Did you ever make up your mind on that one?  I stalled the poor gentleman again...)
 
Anyway, have as much fun as you possibly can and come home -k not too x exhausted.
 
l
I
'm writing
. Worman today to see if he can't fly up to AFS to spend at least an
 
evening with us.  He sounds really great.
 E1 Dabh does not speak Spanish (according
 
to his vita:at.least), so we'll fill up that hole.
 I still think he could advise
 
us very very well on the problem, and I do not think that we necessarily have to
 
have a Spanish surname;. maybe the approach should be a committee or something of the
 
kind, as I hate to lose someone who has studied the interaction of Spain and North
 
Africa--
and the interaction -of Spain and Pueblo Indians in New Mexico.
 They don't
 
hardly come like that as far as I can find out...
 
i  Well, love to you, and take care; don't get sick any more.  Affectionately,

Subject:  publicity agenda
 
I have several concerns in the general area of p.r. that I don't quite
 
know what to do with.
 It occurs to me they might be brought up at
 
(1 
the publicity meeting of the supervisory group.
 If you agree that
 
this is a better strategy than my delivering myself of yet another
 
memo, please tuxexzs
 room for a discussion of:
 
importance of getting press releases from the festival while
 
it is going on to the home papers of the participants
 
need for a staff photographer to take pictures of all performers,
 
a copy to be sent the performer along with his certificate
 
need to solicit the performers' evaluation of the festival, perhaps
 
through a card of the type handed out on the ethnic tours.
 
i
 
I know these are old ideas and I also know they all spell money; they
 
still should be attended to.

'd l

Weighed i
n t

gainst t
he a

be.
 
1
.  The possibility of a s

even when weighed a

AFTERWORD
 
The f

our r

 But even i

and human r
esources at our d
isposal, we believe t
hey would be better
 
employed i
mproving r
ather t
han i

The most consistent and d

eceived has
 
been of t
he gap between r
hetoric and r
eality, t
he marked d
isparity
 
-

between what we say we are doing and what we actually produce.  We
 
should t

SUMMARY OF 1976 PROGRAM BOOK CONTENT SUGGESTIONS
 
The following recommendations were arrived at in
 
consultation between Bob. B. , Rayna, Charley,  Bill,  Susan K. ,'+ C%4e o 
Peter,  Tom K.,  Bernice and Bess.
 Not all are supported
 
with equal enthusiasm by each of the above;  the thought was,
 
however,  to get a beginning down on paper for later
 
refinement.
 
1
.
 Overall format. The decision to publish one program
 
book to be sold throughout the twelve weeks was strongly
 
supported;  this should be of the highest quality in
 
terms of content and illustrations,  in hopes that it will
 
be purchased and retained as a Bicentennial souvenir.
 The
 
program book would contain an insert which would be
 
published weekly or bi-weekly;  the insert should be
 
available for sale separately at a slight cost to
 
people who want only a simple schedule of events.
 
The suggestion follows that the program book return to
 
the original 9 x 12 format so as to encourage the
 
retention of the book in the family bookshelves.
 The
 
insert, however,  could still be printed longways,  if
 
schedule lay-out is better served.
 
2.
 Inse rt content. The
 
items at a minimum:
 
same throughout the
 
insert should contain the following
 
(
the first two should remain the
 
Festival;  the last two change.
 
a map of the Festival grounds
 
a general informational section  (as in 1975 program
 
book)
 
lists of the participants'  names
 
an abbreviated schedule of events in all sections
 
The names of sponsors and contributors might be divided
 
as follows -- sponsors and major contributors in the
 
program book;  donors whose contributions will be visible
 
on the Mall for only one or two weeks in the insert.
 
3
.
 Program book content. 
Several basic ideas as to content
 
emerged in our discussions.
 They are summarized for
 
the sake of convenience in terms of sections,  though
 
it is not necessary that this division be maintained in
 
the final book copy.
 
-2-
A.
 An overall "ceremonial" section which should
 
contain the following:
 
A statement by Secretary Ripley.
 We feel
 
that the Secretary should be invited to
 
contribute '
an especial'evaluative comment for
 
this Bicentennial book.
 
A statement from the National Park Service
 
Director.
 
An article of some length by Ralph Rinzler
 
reviewing the history of the Festival.
 
B.
 A program-related section in which each of the
 
seven Festival divisions is represented by a
 
brief statement of the purpose and perspective
 
of the particular program.
 Each of these
 
should be limited to a half-page  (one page at
 
most)  including an appropriate photo.

 A section of general cross-programmatic articles
 
addressing major issues,  interestingly written and
 
illustrated by photographs and other suitable

An article by Alan Lomax condensed from one
 
published by UNESCO magazine .,on the topic of
 
cultural feedback -- how the Festival can

the events on the Mall are finished.

A cross-programmatic picture story on a
 
single type of behavior:
 bread making was
 
suggested.
 
D.
 A section of short articles, including picture
 
stories, interviews with performers,  and the
 
like. generated out of the various sections of
 
the Festival.
 Each program would  (
according
 
to our somewhat rudimentary figuring) have
 
about seven pages, allowing for two or three
 
articles on different topics relevant to
 
their presentation.
 Regional suggested they
 
would like to have an article on the various
 
ways people have of defining or explaining their
 
"home turf" -- their region,  town, or homesite.
 
This would be prepared from interviews with
 
participants.
 Secondly,  they would like to
 
include an article on some aspect of regional
 
food and cookery practices.
 Old Ways wants to
 
have one article which would consist of the
 
life history of a participant, addressing
 
particularly the immigrant experience.
 Secondly,
 
they want to include an article on the ethnic
 
community,. how it works, how people move in and
 
out of it at varying times in their lives, what
 
its supportive functions are.
 Native Americans
 
suggests the possibility of reprinting one or
 
two of the fine articles written by a variety
 
of Indianist scholars which were printed in
 
the American Airlines magazine a year ago.
 The
 
article on Native American religion by Al Ortiz
 
and the article on Native American law by Vine
 
Deloria were mentioned as possible selections.
 
Other programs would provide similarly varied
 
sections.
 
It was agreed that Bess and Bob would discuss
 
this overall scheme with Susanne and Janet,  and
 
check it with Ralph upon his return.
 Bess will
 
then go back to the various programs for
 
further specific ideas for articles;  formal
 
negotiations with prospective authors  will be
 
condbcted by Bess.
 
Overall, the feeling seemed to be that the program
 
book should be generated by the Festival but should reach
 
beyond it.
 We want people to keep it and use it after
 
A
 
they' ve returned to their home towns.
 Its tone should be
 
popular - there is no reason whatever for it to be dull -
but its content should be meaty and thought--provoking.
 We
 
should call on the resources of our admirable picture file
 
as well as on the bibliographic recommendations of our
 
authors.
 We have a chance here to
' make a lasting contribution
 
which will keep the principles of our Festival alive long
 
after we've all gone home.

(_
 
Subject:
 Native Americans in the Hispanic Presentations
 
While I was in Santa Fe I spoke with Dr. Al Ortiz concerning
 
Southwestern United States Indians and any possible Hispanic
 
presentation correlation.
 He admits that in the New Mexico
 
Pueblos there is a 400 year influence of the Spanish derived.
 
These areas include cooking,  some governmental features  (
Pueblo
 
governors,  Fiscales,  etc.)
 and Spanish Catholicism.
 There are
 
also some influences in the performing traditions,  particularly
 
the Matachines.
 
i
 
i
 
However, he feels that a presentation of Pueblo materials s
 
should concentrate primarily on the Indian aspects,  the Native
 
traditions,  as these are the main points of our concerns.  (
It also
 
appears that those people who participate in the Matachines
 
do not participate in the native dances and vice versa).
 
If we are trying to get Native participation in a Hispanic
 
program,  he suggests that we use Pima-Papago materials rather than
 
the arboreal desert materials of Pueblo-Navajo.
 The Pima-Papago
 
materials would more than fill our needs,  not only in terms of
 
Matachines,  and Pascoles,  but also  'Chicken Scratch'  Spanish Poka,
 
and Nortenos.
 As presently constituted Regional Americans will
 
cover the Papago thru Jim Griffith and I am sure that the program
 
he provides will fill the bill.
 
(Meanwhile,  our Pueblo program will include Spanish derived
 
and Spanish influenced foods,  but with an Indian flavoring.)
 
From:
 Bess Hawes
 
Field Work Plan for Hispanic-American Week as of October 17,  1975.  
Sixteenth and seventeenth century colonization of
 
the new world stemmed from many nations:
 Great Britain,
 
France, Spain and Portugal,  among others.
 In the Festival
 
of American Folklife, we attempt to pay tribute to the
 
many cultures, both colonial and indigenous, which now make
 
up our multi-ethnic society.
 Even so,  up until now,  our
 
major linguistic component has always been English.
 
In view of the fact that Spanish remains the primary
 
language for at least half of the Western hemisphere and
 
for a significant percentage of U.S,  citizens,  it seems
 
appropriate for the Festival of American Folklife to spend
 
at least one week of its twelve-week-long Bicentennial Festival
 
emphasizing the multiple cultural contributions of Spanish-
speaking citizens.
 Thus, we are designating the week of
 
August 11-15 "Hispanic-American Week" during which almost
 
all our program areas will concern themselves either with
 
Spanish-speaking artists or with the many factors which
 
have affected the development of Hispanic-American culture.
 
As is the usual practice in our Festival, each program
 
area will use its own approach:
 
- Regional America will present the Southwest,  the
 
region of the United States most deeply affected by Hispanic
 
culture.
 However, since its charge is to represent an
 
entire region, Mexican-American or other Spanish speakers
 
will be only a part of the entire regional presentation
 
for that week.
 
- African Diaspora,  in its tri-continental program,
 
hopes to bring in the nation of Nigeria as the African
 
component,  featuring both the Hausa bardic tradition
 
(
to "stand for" the Moorish incursion into Spain)  and a
 
Yoruban presentation  (
Yoruban culture being one of the
 
main Black African components traceable in the Hispanic
 
Caribbean countries).
 Within the usual framework of
 
Diasporan performance -- the religious life,  the market,
 
etc.  -- Diaspora will also present the Black tradition of
 
Puerto Rico and, perhaps, Panama or  Colombia.
 
v
w.
 
I
  
-2-
- Native Americans,  on the other hand, will present
 
the Southwest during "Hispanic-American Week", bringing
 
in both a group from the Pueblo Indians(who were contacted
 
early during the period of Spanish exploration)  and also
 
the Navajo,  considerably less affected by Spanish contact.
 
- Old Ways,  to round out the picture, will be bringing
 
in Spain and Mexico and the Hispanic tradition of Puerto
 
Rico.
 
A diagram of the entire plan is attached.
 
It should be clearly understood by all concerned that
 
each program will only be responsible for effective
 
presentation of its own particular components during the
 
week of August 11.
 The overall statement of the theme of
 
Hispanic-American week will be made on the main stage
 
during both daytime and evening concerts, when the various
 
elements from the different programs will be brought together
 
for comparison and contrast.
 
The preliminary planning of the main stage programs
 
will be handled by Tom Vennum in conjunction with an
 
additional coordinator-planner, if the budget allows.
 
Presentation and coordination on the Mall will be supervised
 
by Tom and, hopefully, Halim E1 Dabh,  together with
 
presenters from the various program areas.
 Any advance
 
planning, however, will depend entirely upon the receipt of
 
a great quantity of information and suggestions  from all the
 
field workers concerned;  and, in such an interlocking
 
presentation,  the results of one inquiry will inevitably
 
affect another.
 
It seems wise,  then,  to consider setting up an informal
 
Committee of Correspondence among all Hispanic-week field
 
workers.
 Each field worker is urged to send in especially
 
frequent reports,  recommendations,  tapes, pictures,  and
 
comments.
 These should be addressed to Bess Hawes, who
 
will arrange for their duplication and distribution to all
 
the field workers concerned,  as well as to the necessary
 
staff.
 Field workers should also take every opportunity to
 
keep in direct touch with each other;  ideally, each one
 
should know what the others are doing and finding at all
 
times.
 To this end,  a list of those field workers presently
 
concerned with Hispanic-American week is appended,  including
 
-3-
addresses,  telephone numbers,  and field work responsibilities.
 
Bess will keep this up to date, as additional field workers
 
are added.
 
Please note the urgency of the early establishment of
 
a few parallel cultural elements which will dramatize for
 
the Festival visitor the overall thematic approach of
 
Hispanic-American week.
 This will make the problem of
 
field work a double one:
 to locate materials which make a
 
clear statement within the particular program  (
Diaspora,
 
Regional, etc.)  and which will combine in an interesting
 
fashion cross-programmatically.
 There are several
 
possibilities already apparent:
 
- The North African bardic tradition of the ornamented
 
solo voice accompanied by a single plucked instrument
 
(
observable also in Spain, Mexico,  and New Mexico)
 
- the marimba orchestra  (
Yoruban, Mexican and,  I am
 
told,  19th century California)
 
- the ballad tradition of Spain,  comparable to the
 
corrido tradition of Mexico, New Mexico and California
 
- the Christmas music of Spain, Puerto Rico and
 
New Mexico,  some of the most beautiful in the world
 
- the mural tradition of Mexico and California
 
The possibility of parallel craft traditions should
 
not be overlooked,  and I wonder if we could not do something,
 
in terms of the culinary arts, with the different kinds of
 
beans and bean cookery,  at least in the New World?
 
I am appending for your consideration several highly
 
preliminary field plans for Spain  (
Anna Lomax), Black
 
Puerto Rican and general Caribbean New York  (Rene Lopez)
 
and the overall Diaspora plan  (
Bernice Reagon).
 These
 
are quite tentative and will remain so until after more of
 
the field work has been completed.
 This suggests the
 
reminder that it is especially important,  in view of our
 
cross-programmatic needs,  for field workers not to commit
 
the Smithsonian to hire any particular individual performers
 
p
m.
 
-4-
until some coordination can be established.
 There is so
 
much beauty possible here that it would seem important to
 
avoid duplication between programs.
 
We are bound to make some mistakes.
 This is the
 
first time,  I believe,  that so ambitious a cultural
 
program has ever been undertaken anywhere in the world.
 
It still seems possible, however,  if we keep clearly in
 
mind our very simple goal:  to present some of the multiple
 
aspects of Hispanic-American traditions for the benefit
 
of Spanish-speaking and general audiences alike.
 Again,
 
our intention is to add rather than to alter.
 As each
 
program develops its own presentation with its own people,
 
we believe a Festival-wide statement on the strength of
 
Hispanic-American culture will emerge.

and handling.
 There are several misassumptions here, however.
 In the
 
first place, the books were sold at the Regional bookstore exclusively
 
by Niccola Daval, one of the California field workers, because the
 
Festival bookstore was not interested in handling them.
 Secondly, there
 
should have been a prior arrangement made with the Molokans as to pricing;
 
either they should have agreed to a 10% handling fee, or they should have
 
had the option of pricing the books 10% over their usual charge.  Neither
 
was done.  This may have been my fault as California coordinator, but that
 
is now beside the point; it wasn't done.
 
I am sure the normal business procedure of the Smithsonian is to take
 
a 10  cut on such sales.
 Is it normal, however, for us to deprive a small
 
and struggling religious congregation of the massive sum of $15.50 in
 
order to follow business procedure and thus squeeze every nickel we can
 
out of Festiv&l participation?  The whole affair strikes me as ignoble,
 
and I am embarrassed to correspond with my Molokan friends who, after
 
a history of centuries of religious harrassment in Czarist Russia,
 
had been brave enough to come forward for the first time in public in
 
order to sing at the 1975 Festival.  At the end, they told me that they
 
had decided at a prayer meeting that God had led them to accept the
 
Smithsonian's invitation.
 This seen+s to me to put the problem squarely up
 
to us: at the going rate of $15.50, which side are we on?
 
I hope you will pursue this minute but culturally highly significant
 
problem with vigor.  Get somebody to write them a check and a note of

 September 18, 1975
 
SUBJECT:
 Sale of Molokan books at 1975 Festival
 
The Molokan community of Los Angeles has notified me that they
 
received reimbursement from the Smithsonian for the sale of their books
 
in the Regional California presentation of the 1975 FAF.
 Unfortunately,
 
the payment was $15.50 short.
 
Their total bill breaks down as follows:
 
4 Molokan Histories  (
$5.00 each)
 20.00
 
18 Molokan Cookbooks  (
$7.50 each)
 135.00
 
They thus billed us for $155.00 but received a check for only $139.50.
 
Apparently the Smithsonian is taking a cut of 10% for sales service
 
and handling.
 There are several misassumptions here, however.
 In the
 
first place, the books were sold at the Regional bookstore exclusively
 
by Niccola Daval, one of the California field workers, because the
 
Festival bookstore was not interested in handling them.

EEPORTS ON FIELD WORKERS/PRESENTERS
 (
Barbara and Bill, Mike
 
Tcan Adler.  Week 2
.  A pleasant guy, didn't do terribly complete field
 
reports and recommended a mixed bag of people including the lady who
 
learned to weave cornshucks from watching an exhibit at Williamsburg
 
(
we found out after she got here, totally inappropriate.)  and the
 
Mayfields, a singing family from Illinois that Mike wouldn't re-invite
 
Bill said he claimed he never got clear instructions from in-house staff.
 
Barbara and the group generally feel that would not re-invite him to
 
do field work for another festival.  He was one of the guys we hired when
 
we realized we had some holes in week 2 and Rusty Marshall couldn't
 
go in and do the work, so Rusty and Bob Byington recommended him and Barbara
 
only spoke to him on the phone, so u perhaps his complaint was justified
 
(
no real guidance)
 !
 
He is a graduate student at Indiana but has not worked on Ohio festival
 
according to Tim.  In conversation, Barbara said he seemed to know the turg
 
well, knew the people Ralph and Tim had suggested looking up but this was
 
not reflected in the field work w he turned into us.  Could have been a
 
question of time, or money or a poor explanation on Barb's part.  Bill
 
thought he really didn't understand what the festival was about and not
 
therefore being sure how to go about doing what he had onyl a very few
 
days to do.  He might, in summary, be a good person to be in touch with
 
if you needed to know something about that area in a hurry, but not the
 
most clearly focussed field worker possible.  Nick poiinted out that what
 
he understood about the festival over the phone last summer was quite
 
E
la e
rxEmg$ey different from the festival when he got to sec it.
 
�!kRrxEH #
 eyz  Bess pointed out that this list will be totally out of date
 
in a matter of a year or so and should then be thrown out.
 
Peter Fagley.  Did work in New England, week 1
.  He was hired to do music
 
and Bill would not rec
nd him again.  Bill said he doesn't know his
 
stuff, maybe there is not anybody else up there that does either; he went
 
for revival types, a lot of the people he turned in were Greenwich Village
 
types.who  If anybody wants to know about contra dancing, however, he does
 
seem to know that backwards and forwards (
Barbara); Bill qualified that
 
to say if you want to know about contra dancing in New Hampshire he might
 
be the one.  Bill says he is simply not well versed in what we are looking
 
for; he was a free lance photographer with no training in folklore or
 
anthro -- Bill said somebody that Rayna knew. Bill said he has put on some
 
small scale festivals in New Hampshire.
 
Barbara said we should be looking for people's strengths as well as their
 
weaknesses, so that this list could have wider use than perhaps just
 
festival related skills.
 
Ma r
tin Lutz.  Tim said he and Doug Radcliffe were hired originally to do
 
Ohio and collectively they spent zero days doing fieldwork in Ohio.  They
 
were sent to areas where they had never been - Martin
--to New York state
 
and Kansas and Douglas to Illinois, Kansas and Nebraska.  Timxkiaa They
 
worked for the Ohio festival the several years it was held; the first year
 
they were sound technicians and were very good (
assigned by the state fair)
 
and it turned out they knew folklore in southern part of the state pretty well
 
A
 
pnown+r
 
The second and third years they were field workers, concentrating on the south
 
of the ax e state; t
hey know a fair amunt about music and material culture of
 
that area including cognates in West Virginia and Kentucky.  Most of the people
 
they worked with had come to Ohio from there.  Bill said they were k
ind o
f like
 
Jens; they turned in a lot of a stuff a lot of which was inappropri4te.  He  —
 
assumed they could tell the difference.  Bess said she thought some people got
 
mixed directions on whether to turn in everything they came across good, bad or
 
indifferent; some people turned in just what they recommended and some the whole
 
shot.  Bill thinks they did the latter  though some of the things they recommended
 
we vetoed.
 
Steve Poyser.  Material culture in Kentucky.  Barbara doesn't know him.  He had
 
previously done f
ield work out of personal interest zazwestazazKeakaeky and has
 
a masters degree in from Western Kentucky. Bill says he knows that field and area
 
fairly well.  Comes from Kentucky
.
'
:.
 
Ed Miller.
 (
Bill says no.)  Bazhaxaxsaid  Later added his material culture was
 
all right -- his music was awful.  Barbara said he recommended Gary Dunshee and
 
Rex Ivey and they were very good.  Bill said apparently he didn't know how to
 
use a tape recorder, because you could hardly hear the music he turned in.  He
 
would sit in down on a table sounded l
ike in a bar so you picked up the table
 
reverbs and the conversation and the music going on way in the background. The
 
tapes were almost useless to listen do.  He is Scottish in background and is now
 
in Scotland doing field work so one would assume he knows something about something
 
but maybe it's just material culture.
 (
It was really impossible to tell if his
 
music would have been any good if you could have heard it, so a judgment  there is
 
difficult to make.) He was a coffee house performer.  Most of his reco
ititendations
 
were seconded to Bess by Nick Spitzer;  Bess doesn't know how much Nick knows --
she thinks both had the attitude that it was the normal range of material that we
 
wanted, that if most bands in an area were elctrified, for example, that we were
 
obliged to represent the area in terms of electrified instruments.  Bess thinks
 
that was the baseline that various field workers were working from and that it
 
was an issue that never quite got unscrambled with all the changeover of directions
 
in Regional -- whether we were going for the typical or the old or the special or
 
what.  Generally it turned out to be a mix of everything; at least Ed Miller was
 
deliberately trying to go for the average of what you would hear in that region
 
as wa was Nick Spitzer.  Bill said that in talking to him, his idea was to show
 
how eclectic moxt folk musicians are which Bill isn't sure is what the festival is
 
out to show.  Bess thought that Jim Griffiths was similarly interested in and
 
intrmgued by the eclecticism they found -- its a respectable position; you have
 
to know though what people's line is.  This perspective has not been the one taken
 
by this festival -- however, there could well be others where this PH would be
 
useful.
 
Texas seems to be very big on that kimmmEk kind of things, Diana said,
 
not just in folk music but with the seven flags kind of thing and what influenced
 
the various directions culture has taken there etc.  It may thus be an emphasis
 
throughout the whole state, though also this is a position promoted by UT folklorist
 
as well.
 
Dudley Radcliffe.  His orientation is more musical than Mark's; both of them went
 
to Ohio State, studied with Utley et al.  Barb asked Tim if their notion of
 
traditional music is more varied than hers, and Tim said yes. He said they were
 
interested in revival musicians personally, though not for a festival; however,
 
they would clearly support such groups as the Etc. String Band who were reviving
 
a tradition indigenous to their region.
 
Ken Stewart.  Bill said he knew him and would not recommend him.  "He knows material
 
culture stuff in the R$ Dakotas  but he's clearly unrel&able.  He did his field work
 
1
/
 
for the 1975 Festival but turned it in so later that it couldn't be used until
 
1
976 -- actually, i8vember of 1
976.
 
Dianne Macallom.  Barbara doesn;t know her.  Tim said he and Charley (
?) went
 
up to talk her.  She had never done festival field work before, camp very highly
 
reconriended by Bob Teskie and Jack Witowski (
?) from Wayne State where she went.
 
She had done academic field work and some teaching assistant there.  She knows
 
Detroit like the back of her hand - has lived there all her life.  She was
 
extremely unfamiliar with what this festival was about, but caught on pretty soon.
 
She was the person who located the Williamsons. Her field work in terms of
 
amunt was rather small because by the time she got her coney she was already
 
starting graduate school - Most of what she turned in was music; the Williamsons
 
were the only people she found who were actually invited; she turned in a lot of
 
revival material but seems to know the difference.  She now has had some festival
 
work experience and Tim feels would be worthwile to work with again.  Bill doesn't
 
think you could send her just anywhere, that she would be better in Michigan,
 
specifically Detroit.  She has worked in the Wayne archives a lot, so she would
 
be good to contact for info about what is in the archives.
 
Rusty Marshall.
 (
Barbara didnt' know.)  Bill: I
'm not that impressed with the
 
stuff he's done. Barbara said she was totally unimpressed with the music he sent
 
in -- all sort of a jumble with no distinction between traditional carriers and
 
revival; we didn't invite any of the musicians he reconrrended -- the only thing
 
we went with was the mule business.  Tim said the problems with that were that he
 
talked with a guy at the state fair show and it got confused afterwards as to just
 
who hH he had talked to -- the guy -
m he wanted to get has since died and his
 
brother ca m and everything got balled up because it was not clearly indicated
 
that he had not talked to the people for wham he turned in the cards.  Bill: his
 
comments were more cute than really informative.  He worked in Missouri.  B
arbara:
 
Ralph and Bob have a very different opinion of Rusty; Bill said we didn't actually
 
hire him originally - Bob came in one day and said he had. wul Tim talked with
 
Rusty one day he did seem to know a good deal about the people in southern Missouri,
 
especially the mule shows.  His product however felt short of what we were led to
 
expect.  Barba said that he was really busy - that's why we had to hire Tan Adler
 
to work in that area.  Bill said that another thing is that he has a very abrasive
 
personality and that he's difficulty to get along with him until you get to know
 
him.  Bess suggested that he may have been adjusted to the earlier more casual
 
festival style (
before 1974) that this last year was the f
irst year things got into
 
some degree of general order - up till then it was pretty individualistic and
 
people didn't have to write reports and all that and he may just not have gotten
 
on to the new style.
 
Elliott Wiggington (
Was working with the Foxfire people for us.)  He phased in and
 
out. He has actually not sent in an invoice; Diana has talked to him a couple of
 
times and he feels very badly about taking any money from us at all and probably
 
will not.  He did recommend some people to Alan Tulles but actually he -

. didn't
 
have time to do anything for the Festival but was just going to do the building
 
because that was a good project for Foxfire students.  Bill said Wig is good on
 
crafts but knows very little about music.  Tim said.one of the reasons the building
 
project didn't come through was lack of time on Wq Wigginton's part; he was also
 
sick -- the foreman was ill also and they had a lot of projects they were ccnanitted
 
to get ready for the beginning of the school year.
 
Gail Zaninovich.  Gail was reco m
mended by Susie Jones to do Russian old Believer

singers -- she had to be asked to take a tape of them and send it in — so the
 
hunch is she doesakkXkR M

knows the co m
munity more from a social-anthropological ap aspect than a
 
folkloric.  She was also pregnant at the tiny, and had very l
ittle t
i me;
 
she was unable to come to the Festival for that reason.  She had worked in
 
the coninunity before and didn't seem to have a
 problem catching on to what
 
we were looking for.  She might or might not be interested in doing.things
 
beyond this; she probably would be interested in working for the festival
 
again -- she may be a Russian specialist.  Dhe  wasn't an obstacle -- saying
 
they won't do this or that or they shouldn't do this; she had a good attitude.

Sandy Rikoon did field work this past year and would like to again — fmm
 
Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri — midwest.  Tim also.  Also Bill.
 
Bill says midwest, south and New England are areas where he would feel comfortable
 
working; he's done more field work in New England than anyplace else.
 
Barbara said that a lot of the New Rg England material crafts that were sub-
mitt
(-
d reflected a colonial crafts revival -- Peter sent it in -- If we had
 
had more field workers there we could have gone beyond that level to others;
 
but the colonial revivals were what people hit when they first went out.  WE
 
rozJ #zdrkaktxdo  Munson protested that the level of New England f
ield work
 
was poor -- that in New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, not so much Conn and Mass
 
so much of the stuff is done exactly the way it's always been done.  The seaboard
 
along there is not revivalist, it's a part of life; Barbara agreed and said
 
she thought we didn't do the seacoast stuff well.  Bess said she thought we
 
blew New Eg England generally.  We didn't have enough field workers out; by the
 
time we caught on to the fact we were in trouble, it was tough to handle it only
 
by phone.  Bob mentioned two of the big things that go on in New England are
 
trapping and taxidermy; pretty tough to represent at the festival.
 
Barbara said we worried early on about whether or not we were to attempt to
 
have some representation from every state; Jim's position was that we were not
 
obligated to pick a person from each state.  In New England we really did Penn-
sylvania and Maine exclusively.
 
Karen Baldwin.  Did the recitation stuff.  Worked very well in the festival --
did her dissertation on the recitation in New England or some such; has had these
 
folks in the classroom.  She reconmended the people to Peggy (
she was one of
 
Peggy's teachers -- she's at Amherst now, went to school at Penn.  She was very
 
pleasant and cooperative to work with at the Festival during week one.
 
Jack Bennett (
�)  Barb:  "He was a nice person who was trying to do a strange
 
job well; he had no area of expertise that pertained to what he was doing.  If
 
you were doing a festival again and you had another nice person around who was
 
cooperative and willing, that other person would do just as well."  Nick:  "
I
 
saw him put a couple of performers on the spot once or twice; he had a tendency
 
to say, "Why don't you tell us about that' and hand over the mike, but he seemed
 
willing to learn and willing to try."  Barb:  He was hired because I had asked
 
area coordinators to recommend people as t
.l.c.ers and presenters that they could
 
work comfortably with.
 (
The implication was that he had been hired as t
.l.c.)
 
Joyce Bynum:  Tim:  Joyce worked very well this year; I
 wqx was very impressed
 
with her -- beter than last year.  Diana;waxxsa #xEpddmk"from the participant
 
coordination end of things and from the administrative end, she was kind of a
 
pain to work with; batxfxomzkhn the administrative and progra m
matic areas seem
 
to be entirely different.- e
.g. Diana said that she got on f
ine with Susie Jones.
 
the standpoint of a staff person who has to get certain information etc. from
 
a field worker seems to have no bPari
.ng on whether or not the person makes a
 
Good nrPGPntPr.
 
Barbara said however that if a person is a pill and makes difficulties until they
 
get on the stage, it just isn't worth having them around regardless of how expert
 
they are in presentation.  Beverly apparently had the same kind of problem with Joyce
 
as PRi Diana did.
 
(
Background on Joyce from Bess:  She came to present the Assyrians in 1
975 fm as_
 
part of the California presentation.  Several staff people heard her quarreling in
 
what must have been a very unprofessional way with them and Rayna got to the point
 
of wanting to send her home.  Bess opposed this on the grounds that nobody else could
 
get along with the Assyrians either — they were just like the Lebanese -- and that
 
Joyce was under terrific strain, both physical and psychological, since she had just
 
had a mastectomy two weeks before the festival and probably should not have car
e.
 
Bess had advised her to stay hone but did not insist since Joyce had done an enormous
 
amount of California field work and was looking forward to the experience very much.)
 
General agreement among the folklorid!staff (
Mike, Barb, Nick, Tim) was that she
 
handled herself much better this summer especially with the folks but clearly the
 
administrative staff wHs found her somewhat acerbic.  Mike suggested that she was
 
one of those people who felt terrific concern that every one of the folks got just
 
what they needed and that possibly it came out as an
d overly demanding attitude
 
on her R part.  Barb:  "Joyce is a hard worker who will do not only what you ask her
 
field wise but she'll generate a whole lot of her awn ideas; her big drawback is that
 
she doesn't differentiate with consistency what i
s revival and what is traditional."
 
Barb would not hesitate to hire her again.  Bill cov
 ented that she was a kind of field
 
worker like Jens — she turns up a lot of stuff.  Nick added that this was true not
 
just in the field but as a presenter, she was willing to tackle anything; she's not
 
afraid of anything and that's very handy.  Barb — she also was able to say that someone
 
was a nice person and that person would turn out to be nice.  Bess:  in her California
 
work she turned in a tape of an Assyrian lady who was singing in a very mpeHatax
 
operatic semi-professional style and we told her she was unsuitable and she had the
 
hutzpa to go back and tell the lady she wished she would sing like the lady ordinarily
 
did at home.  So the lady sang like she ordinarily did at home, and Joyce said that's i
i
 
Most people don't do that; they will not tell a performer any other dimension of
 
performance than the one they first get;xfhiszisxs
 Bill
 
commented that most people are both afraid to do that and don't have the time to
 
work on that level; when they are on the road, they can't go back.  Tim (
I think)
 
said he had found her flexible in progra m
ming.  Diana said she was inflexible in
 
business arrangements and tended to be brusquer and temvery in f
inancial arrangments;
 
Barbara commented that she was surprised to hear that Beverly had had problems with
 
her too.
 
Ed Cabell.  Bill: I was not totally i
_
r
rpressed with him.  Barb:  He was at f
irst de-
fensive, making sure that we were going to treat the black people we were inviting
 
properly.  Beverly had an interesting telephone conversation with him before he knew
 
that she was black in which he told her what black folklore was about and what he
 
expected his treatment would be; then he talked to Alan Tullos and called back with
 
a completely changed tone (
Bev had been carrying him on
:�x and he had told her that
 
you white folks just don't understand where we're coming from.)  M
ike:  He seemed to
 
have a decent background in what he was dealing in but he was very shy in presenting
 
and not willing to insert himself into a workshop or presentation in a way that could
 
guide or focus attention; he kind of laid back and seemed uncomfortable with the whole
 
idea of presenting.  Diana:  he was on the defensive and this comes out in all kinds of
 
ways.  Barb:  He was uncomfortable in presenting things he didn't know anything about
 
and when he presented things he h was familiar with he had a tendency �
pm to let it
 
just flow; his position was that people should pick out what was important rather than
 
telling them what to look for.  Bess:  This represents a definite philosophic dis-
agreement and some people are aware that they are taking that position and have a
 
lot of rationale behind it, and some people just do it because that's just their
 
personal style to let things go along in a serendipitous sort of way.

Hess:
 It S
MITES  to nu  L
hat it' s  iI ix).CLant  to  find out WhaL a presenter' s  attitude
 
is on that question.  If they have a very strong position one way or the other,
 
its awfully difficult for them to take the opposite point of view.  I have a strong
 
position the other way and as a result it's very hard for me to lay back in presen-
tational terms, though it's easy for me to in interviewing.  I sometimes just psych
 
myself into saying well I
'm just going to interview this guy and let him ramble
—
 
Bill:  Ed's a kind of a quiet person anyway; he was a lot better than(Sparky?)
 
Barbara: he felt that his job here was to take care of the black folks that we had
 
invited; he didn't show up to the second presenters meeting to find out the plans
 
and changes we were making and when I had a little run in with him the next day I
 
told him I thought one of the best waysto take care of the folks was to be a part
 
of the decision making.  He clearly was only interested in the folks that came from
 
West Virginia, again protecting them from whatever hard or oversights we might
 
inflict on them.  Bill coimented that he had a lot of information about those folks
 
but that he didn't usually give it when he got up on stage; "I just got the impression
 
that he was a kind of a quiet person•�who didn't l
ike to talk a lot." Mike:  I talked
 
to him frequently about the John Henry Foundation and he was very verbose when it came
 
to the role of black culture in the mountains etc. and twice I said, I
'm glad you told
 
me all this and I hope you can incorporate this information into your presentations
 
and he didn't really respond.
 
Barb:  He was very glad to have the folks we had presented in Regional rather than
 
Diaspora; and that says something positive about where he was caning from.  He
 
appreciated having them presented within a geographic cultural frame as well as
 
being Afro-Americans.  Bess:  he was a nice guy to have around; he seemed to get on
 
well with whites as well as blacks.  Barb:  he was willing to try things that he was
 
not familiar with - he presented the Christian Harmony folks because he was interested
 
in hearing them.  However, he was bored by the music and instead of saying so and
 
that he wanted to change he sort of didn't show up or pay much attention.
 
Guy Carawan.  Mike:  he did an excellent job with the presentation of his folks;
 
that's all I saw of him. It was more or less like his record; he felt a bit bad about
 
their being presented solely as m
iners, however, he wanted to give a little more
 
contextual information about life in West Virginia which Mike felt was also an
 
important point to bring out.  Barb:  Guy is good at getting people involved in and
 
sensitized to what music is about; he's too much so in that x everything sort of turns
 
into a happening or a love-in and so you sort of go with it.  Tim:  he was good in
 
what he did but he didn't do much with anything else, didn't go to the regional learning
 
center or anything like that.  Mike:  He limited himself in what he did.
 
Dennis Coelho.  Bess:  I only heaRrd him on the main stage and I thought he was ex-
ceptionally good; he got a lot of iRr =atioxzink0xa information into very brief
 
introductory statements and it was useful information, pertinent.  Barb:  he was
 
»
m
ac another one of those people who weren't afraid to tackle things he didn't
 
know anything about; he did the Basque workshop which could really have been a
 
disaster with three little people talking a whole hour about Basques in Idaho and
 
California.  He did an exceptionally good job on that; he had information that he
 
managed to slip in.  Mike:  He was totally plugged in to what we wanted to do with
 
the Festival.  He didn't hesitate either in week 6
 when we had a young gal who had
 
a drinking problem and who was making a fool of herself, not showing up at performances
 
etc. and he went and talked with her, didn't shy away from that sort of problem.
 
Bess: what about his field work?  Barb:  he had a sort of screwy setup as far as I
 
can determine.  He mm did Idaho and was then hired for a very few days to do Washingtoi
 
and he said he couldn't do it in that time and got 10 more days... Bill:  there was
 
a conflict between him and Susie because she thought he was going to do a lot of
 
ethnic communities in Washington and he didn't.  Bess:  I seem to recall Rayna didn't
 
approve of his field work.  Bill:  She didn't like him was what it was.  Diana:

to stop sending in that corny stuff.  Bill:  She liked some of his stuff; she liked
 
Roberta Whiting (
?) and all those fiddlers, she just said that we've got too many
 
fiddlers, and it had no balance.  Diana:  she said ik his work was not representative
 
of the area.  & Barb:  She also said his stuff was hokey and to stop sending in that
 
crap and some of that attitude got transmitted to Susie who then decided that Detar
iis
 
was on the wrong side of things.  Susie had the impression that he didn't have a good
 
relationship with the people  which certainly didn't come across in his f
ield reports
 
or in the people he brought in during his wccks (
his relationship with them).
 
He's still in school in Indiana, and is program director of the mid-west folk festival.
 
e
 
Bill:  The thing was he sent in some songs that a man and his wife learned from the
 
guy's father and Raymaxsaid we said no and then Rayna said you've got to get some
 
singers and they had a set-to.  Barb:  Some of the confusion canes about when you don't
 
know if someone is sending in everything they collected or only the stuff they were
 
recommending.  But he told me that Myna said that his stuff was crummy and then when
 
I looked it up in the book, most of it was graded 1 (
top grade).  Bill:said she was
 
referring to those singers that had been turned down and she wanted a better balance.
 
Barb:  So I think his field work was obviously of acceptable quality.  Mike:  he
 
pitched in quite a bit here, problem-solving.  Barb:  he again was l
ike Peggy who
 
accepted the responsibility of being a go-between to explicate rather than to set up
 
barriers between participants and staff.
 
Linda Danielson:  Mike:  Her perspective on folklore has been tainted too much by a
 
limited amount of experience in a small area and she hasn't attempted to move out of
 
that area and get an overall perspective of the entire nortizwest region.  Her judgment
 
in terms of fiddle style is good; she knows those styles she has been exposed to.
 
From the human relations end  I would give her a low grade.  Barb:  I would never work
 
with her again, period.  I thought the way she conducted heraffairs in the field with
 
participants was totally destructive to our efforts here.  She is competent in fiddle
 
styles but in eoopexatixexappiied the applied cooperative sense, she's a wash-out.
 
Diana:  She would walk up to people she had brought, and right in front of you, she'd
 
say "Well, they've screwed us over again."  2hexwasxa  Barb:  She was a problem in
 
the dormitory too, not explaining to people why they had to stop playing at 11:00,
 
finding pianos for her people to play on.  Mike:  she put in dust instead of oil.
 
Jim Griffith:  Okay.  Good presenter.  Bill:  he has a tendency to like to perform.
 
Mike:  he doesn't like to get involved with presenting per se; he goes in for self-
definition, let the folks define themselves.  Barb:  he's an energetic field worker.
 
Mike:  and when it canes to i working out wrinkles he's willing to lend a hand and
 
stay up as late as necessary to handle problems.  T
im (
?) he helped me out a lot when
 
I was in his area in the field. Hgsxzuports*zj�houghxaxii

Bess:  his reports, though a little inchoate, when you managed to figure out which
 
piece of paper he'd written what down on, were remarkably complete with the information
 
you needed.  Mike:  he's very good at working with people like Van Holyoke, people
 
who hasxeazx have narratives.  Nick:  he's definitely a westerner.  Barb:  he's sensity
(
 
to cultural dif
(ferences enough not to just blam into something, and I would work with
 
him again as a field worker and as a presenter, but I think he has somewhat the same
 
category as Joyce in that he turns in a lot of stuff  that is not app xr^
.
g ate for
 
this festival.  X One of the reasons may be that he is involved in a festival in his
 
own comuunity that is a little less selective in a lot of the areas that we are selec-
tive in.  He's more plugged into what he's doing there than what we're doing here.
 
I found him totally undefensive though;ahoxtxwhy e
.g. when we talked about why we
 
couldn't i
i i have the santero who tattooed saints faces on people he argued a little
 
bit but we didn't get into ideological hassles constantly over every such issue.
 
Bess:  I think he i
s, however, definitely a regionalist; he told me that one of his
 
job problems is that he is unwilling to leave Arizona; he said that's where I
've done
 
all my work axdx1xw! U and that's where I want to say.  I

one of the few who would sit d

Bess:  another nice thing about him was he was a good dancer and he was,very good-
at shilling for dances because you knew he liked to dance and you knew he liked the

Susie Jones.  Barb:  I would not work with Susie again where any kind of
 cooperative
 
effort was required between a her and anybody else.  She has a good eye for materiel
 
but not for the people who produce the artifacts and for me zmzte Mszofxmozazies

wmzk
:� it doesn't make her a good fimd field worker in terms of finding nice people
 
Jm.  Bill:  the problem is that she's in an area where if you don't work with her
 
there's not a whole lot of other people.  Barb:  I think you ask Barry Toelken to
 
ask around.  Diana:  just for the reebrd, I never had any difficulty dealing with her
 
in the kinds of things I had to deal with her about.  Barb:  Charley did in setting
 
up her contract; she wo wrote him a rather vitriolic letter which is in the f
iles.
 
Diana:  since we did this in reverse for Joyce, I think it's only fair for me to
 
comment again when it's this way round.  Mike:  I think the same holds true for Susie
 
as for Linda Danielson -- she's working from a very limited perspective andexposure
 
to a lot of things and that taints her outlook on the entire region.  And anybody
 
with a wider regional perspective is going to have a problem working with her.  Barb:
 
txtkimkx I don't think she is a regionalist in the same sense that Allen Tullos and
 
Jim Griffiths are; she's a wood-careerist from Oregon. I don't think she has an
 
interest and regional curiosity in terms of all the things going on in the area; I
 
think what we may have taken for regionalism was sort of defensiveness.  Bill:
 
I think she was Barry Toelken's suggestion.  Barb:  I think for a limited kind of thing,
 
if someone were interested in wood carvers in the northwest she would be the one to
 
contact, but in applying that to a general production of a festival she's not the
 
person.  Diana°  also Beverly had trouble with her — a
lmost everybody did.  Barb:
 
Poor a
x attitude.  Mike:  Also before the Festival she had planted very bad seeds
 
in the participants so that whe they arrived a lot of them were on the defensive and
 
ready for a fight.  Barb:  It was to the point where when Beverly would talk to someone
 
on the phone about having tried to make this or that arrangement, the person would say
 
"Well, you really are trying to be helpful, aren't you?" xx -- they said said you
 
wouldn't be very helpful ov you'd try to do less than y2m I
'd really need or whatever.
 
Ba Bill:  I think a lot of that is due to the fact that she was warned last year Not to
 
make sure that she got a guarantee on that, not to take anything for granted etc.
 
Barb: Many of us had first person experiences last year and if we recapitulated last
 
year's experience none of us would have been able to work together  and accomplished
 
what we did; we wouldn't even have accepted the job.  Nick:  It was the extension of
 
that to the participants that really got to me; I you don't use the participants as
 
weapons the way she did. She would stir them up really to make her point for her; it
 
was really kind of vicious.  T ic Sandy:  she was very unco m
municative too; she kept
 
im
.gistixgxsozonxhRzxoNnxwayxthat trying to get her own way behind your back so that
 
there was very little cooperation between her and the grounds crew.  Barb:  she would
 
also ask various people about the same thing until she got the answer she wanted
 
or misconstrue what one person said to the next person to produce the desired effect.
 
And this happened even before Linda Danielson was there, so it was not generated by
 
Linda.
 
David Littleton Taylor.  Knows material culture fairly well, N.E. seacoasts.  Seemed
 
willing to try to present zusic but wasn't very happy doing it and wasn't particularly
 
well; once we decided to turn him loose on crafts, he seemed a lot more happy and
 
productive.  He was very quiet, held back at the dorms.  Nick:  he took direction
 
pretty well; when he was presenting and got into difficulties, if you gave him a hint,
 
he would go right out.and work with it; clearly music wasn't his bailiwick but he was
 
interested in trying.  He is also a regionalist - a Maine man and a seacoast auv,

s
  
Guy RoK�sddn (
?)  Barb:  I thought he did a nice job; he was a little bit show bizzy.
 
Mike:  I think that has to do with the fact that he's put on a lot of fiddle contensts
 
and he's been in radio. Bill:  he's a frustrated country western...  (
Lverybody agreed)
 
I
le wanted to perform very badly and managed to sneak it in a couple of t
imes.  Sandy:
 
he gets along real well with the people from his area.  N
like:  his whole presentation
 
is based on visiting — he says, "We're going to visit with whoever" and he is very
 
informal and I only saw only one presentation that was bekow par.  Nick:  they were
 
a little on the corny side sometimes.  Barb:  he knows the region, he gets along very
 
well with the folks and he would be a good crafts presenter too because he can talk
 
to anyone, he doesn't stand there, he responds with gusto.  Maybe he works a little too
 
hard -- that's what dzives him over into show biz.  (
His region is Oklahoma and his
 
especial area is music.) l
ie's one of those "Let's give them a hand" kind of stage
 
presenters, which in context with the other things we had was a little forced.  Mike:
 
But he always managed to put in points about regionalism, about cultural geography
 
occupational skills and things like that so he was aware of what was going on.  I think
 
he functioned very well.
 
Jens Lund.  Jens was not one of those who was willing to go to the mat with a participar
:
 
trying to get them not to use a music stand or to do this kind of thing instead of
 
that.  He didn't take directions from the presenters meetings; he m
ac did, however,
 
do a great job ox of presenting the a cappella singing convention.  He managed to get
 
in a discussion of shape note and shapes and historical information; he talked up
 
at appropriate times.  Mike:  He got in a lot of information into his presentation of
 
a fiddle workshop where I was backing one of the fiddlers but it was k
ind of unnerving
 
the way he'd pop back and forth on stage and turn around and take pictures of the
 
participants on stage and so on.  I think he needed more experience in being used to
 
stage presence.
 Nick:  he looked uncomfortable on stage.

A FESTIVAL HISTOPY
 
In 1967 the Smithsonian  Institution presented the
 
first edition of what has become a major summertime event
 
on the National Mall,  the Festival of American Folklife.
 
Since its inception,  more than 4,400 craftsmen,  musicians
 
and dancers have performed before some 6 million visitors.
 
,The Festival has presented a variety of  folk traditions from
 
the rich resources of ou,• nation's cultural groups to audiences
 
that have grown substantially from year to year.
 For example:
 
1967
 The first Festival ; a three-day event.  offered an
 
overview of crafts,  dance and musical  traditions -
of Eskimos from King Island.  Chinese Dragon Dancers
 
from Washington and urban and rural  traditions
 
from 25 states and 13 et'lr,ic
; groups.
 Attendance
 
that first year was estim,
,ted :
it  184.000.
 
1968  Texas was the first  r
(-3tiv.,t-sponsoring State.
 
Exhibits presented 150 perfor
rmers,  craftspeople,
 
cooks,  musicians,  dancers and raconteurs from
 
Texas,  including people from German,  French,
 
Czech,  Polish,  Afro-American,  Chicano and Anglo-
Scotch-Irish origins.
 Visitors could eat  Indian
 
bread,  Western barbeque and tacos,  see wood
 
carvers and sorghum makers,  or watch Lummi  Indians
 
weave the myth of creation into basketry.
 Blues
 
and bluegrass,  jazz and _
gospel shared the stage
 
with Cajuns,  Basque and  Indian dancers,  and a host
 
of old-time ballad singers.
 Attendance was some
 
425,000_
 
196 9 Pennsylvania was the sponsoring State.
 Visitors
 
enjoyed a typical  lumberjack competition,  watched
 
shearers,  spinners,  weavers and dyers demonstrate

:ido  i
i
usic
,ians

1972
 Maryland,  the featured state,  added the waterways as
 
an area of presentation with the last remaining
 
commercial sailing fleet in operation,  and a panoramic
 
presentation of the diverse traditions related to

1973  Kentucky,  the featured state,  brought to the Festival
 
colorful crafts and lore surrounding major pastimes
 
and occupations in the state including basket makers,
 
fiddle and dulcimer makers,  chair and harness makers,
 
tobacco twisters,  ballad singers,  religious music
 
groups,  blues and country guitarists,  along with people
 
involved with whiskey production and the breeding and
 
showing of horses.
 The Seventh Annual Festival of
 
American Folklife was presented on a new site between
 
the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument,  under
 
the auspices of the new co-sponsor,  the National Park
 
Service.
 A new theme,  "Old Ways in the New World",
 
was developed to reflect America,  a nation of  immigrants.
 
This was the third consecutive year the American worker
 
demonstrated skills before visitors in a program pre-
pared in cooperation with the Department of Labor and the
 
the AFL-CIO.
 The "Working Americans" area featured crafts-
people from the nation's building trades in on-site con-
struction of a variety of shelters from tipis to mo-
dern office buildings.
 "Native Americans" presented past
 
and present culture and lifestyles of ten tribes of
 
the Northern Plains Indians.
 Dancers,  craftspeople
 
and seminars on Indian life today were part of the Indian
 
Awareness segment of the Festival.
 Attendance passed
 
one million.
 
1974  By this year,  the Festival had achieved the status of a
 
living laboratory of American culture offering curricula
 
appropriate to the study of people.
 More than 800
 
participants representing 15 Indian tribes,  8 foreign
 
nations,  9 participating organizations and unions,
 
and the state of Mississippi were featured.
 Through
 
the efforts of field researchers traveling thousands
 
of miles,  interviewing thousands of candidates, what
 
was presented was the best,  the most articulate,  the
 
most vital craftspeople,  tradespeorle,  musicians and
 
practitioners of  traditional culture.
 A new children's
 
area became a meeting place and shared community of ,
jump
 
rope rhymes,  songs,  circle games,  and activities familiar
 
to young people.
 A new Family Folklore center helped
 
dramatize to visiting family groups how the stories they
 
tell,  t
ale oames they give children,  pets,  and appliances
 
and their heroes can be traced to specific origins,  how
 
they indeed,  are "folk," too.
 With music and dance,
 
with work,  ritual,  and tradition,  with food and folklore,
 
the Festival continued to bring a tangible reminder of
 
our diversity to all who came to Washington.

1 thank you very much for h
elping
; me out so kindly - h
erewith
 
the check and I kiss you 3 times on each cheek with much love.
 
I am with you all in my mind..,ind I stil dream  e v
,e r y night
 
about groups of strange people I n
ever saw before,our talks are clear and
 
transparent although we do not know each other's language,I s
ee fragc;ents
 
of fantastic performances and happenings that disappear and I try in vain
 
to locate them again,a s
.o... and I stil
, 
wake up  in a panic (
1) that I
 
will miss sorie  performance,  and I wonder how is it with 7ou and all the
 
others.it was an overwhelming experience,a miraculous  event,an incredible:
 
endeavor
 only in America .
..
 
I am terribly sorry about what'hap ened to Ralph and Kate the
 
last day of t
 he festival ( 5.y. called to te]tme).Sickening and so thorotugh-
ly ironical.
 
A great surprise waited for me in Tx;  all my students got to-
gether to welcome me at the airport with flowers and with singing the Czech
 
and ",l
oravian folksongs.It l
eft me speechle x and one of, the songs in tears.
 
My place (incl.the dog) was in perfect state and the great green lawn and
 
the dhade of the c
edars absolutely lovely.  However the amount of things,
 
and papers and correspondence I found waiting for me at home  and that which
 
comes out of the boxes I sent is scary and I do n
ot see the end of the mes s
 
nn top of that
 the last 6 packages I s
ent,incl.one registered package with
 
some important books and especially with all my Festival n
otes (
1) disappears.
 
at the very University Post pffice from under the hands of the clerks just
 
when I arrived with the car to pick them up.
 
The ebst of
'f
'ice pegole a
#
ie at a
 
loss,the event grew into an administrative  ,case, to me it causes a gre at
 
anxiety. The purse stolen from me in i
f. was returned by the l
e
i. police with
 
the AAA and Soc.Sec cards but minus the driver
,"s 118enle and the charge
 
.
acc.
 cards - well planned.
 
The first Saturday I was here I went early in the morning dowtown
 
to change the car tires and I run into a parade of the Chicano cowboa7s on
 
horseback, must achoed and with sobreros,silent,magnificent. No music and the
 
crowd too was con sordina. And at the gaz station  an old black gentleman
 
asked me whether I was French - it was Lee Ray,  a sgXofonist who had been
 
performing recently all over Europe,  so we had much to talk about .
. in any
 
case,  the Festival MUST continue.
 
I am sorry I missed the Italian Carnaval performance Sunday m
:kgk:t
 
and also that I c
ould n
ot come to the 'new "eorgetown'in the evening to see
 
the Italians - I just could n
ot do it without hurting very much
 .Y., h
e is
 
such a generaous,  fine,gentle gentleman.
 
To be with ,
you this year,Bess, meant much for me.,llso to see
 
Alan and Anna - she looked so very handsome the last time I saw h
er. And
 
Z stil hope I will be able to make it for the Folklore Conference in Phi-
ladephia.
 
In the meantime - be web 11 and please
 
say my best regards to ev erybody -

Dear Miss Daval
 
I
 write somewhat belatedly, I fear, to express my very s
incere
 
appreciation f
or your work as research l
ibrarian consultant in
 
connection with the presentation of central California folkways
 
during the Smithsonian Institution 1
975 Festival of American
 
Folklife.
 
Your preliminary research was of the highest calibre, and I suspect
 
your bibliography of available works on California folklore will be
 
used by many teachers and s
tudents both in and out of the state.
 
As you know, your references were used as appendices to the articles
 
in the s
pecial i
ssue of the California Folklore Society newsletter which
 
was sold at the Festival in Washington and distributed by mail to
 
the 800 members of CFS.  Many people have commented favorably to me
 
on the s
cholarly nature of the research displayed in that publication.
 
I a
lso greatly appreciated the care, taste, and diligence you applied
 
to the task of selecting books for sale in the California section
 
of the Festival.  The l
ist was excellent; i
t i
s unfortunate that the
 
contractor responsible for f
illing your order did an unergetic and
 
irresponsible job so that some of your books did not arrive.  That
 
was in no way your fault, and the books which did come were welcomed
 
by Festival goers.  I further received many compliments on your
 
work at the bookstall, where your knowledgability and helpfulness
 
were greatly appreciated.
 
Overall, I am e
specially happy that our experiment of utilizing the
 
services of a professional l
ibrarian such as yourself within the
 
setting of a public festival proved so successful.  I
t convinces me
 
more s
trongly than ever that a s
imilar plan should be worked out for
 
the greatly enlarged Smithsonian Bicentennial Festival now being
 
projected f
or the s
ummer of 1
976.  I shall await with inteLbet any
 
comments and suggestions as to how you feel the resources of our
 
l
ibraries and the expertise of our l
ibrarians might be put to even
 
more effective use next summer.
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Annie:
 
I
 write to convey my warmest appreciation and thanks to you and
 
a
ll my other Molokan friends for the l
ovely g
ift of the Russian
 
bori
c* and spoons and the Molokan cookbook.  I had so greatly
 
admired the l
ovely painting on the wooden ware that I saw l
ast
 
s
ummer in Russia and l
onged to take some home with me; however,
 
I s
imply hadn't e
nough space in my luggage and had to be satisfied
 
with s
ome embriodered s
carves and the l
ike.  And now I have a
 
l
ovely set a
ll my own!  As to the cook book, my s
ister Shirley, who
 
i
s l
iving with me this year in Arlington, brought her copy out
 
when she unpacked i
n our new apartment, and I had been s
colding
 
myself f
or not havingbbouggbtone myself a
t the Festival.  I
 
shouldn't be s
o rewarded f
or forgetfulness, but 1 shall make no
 
objections.
 
I had been meaning t
o write you anyway about your tapes.  What
 
with working into my new job and f
inding an apartment and a
ll the
 
rest that goes with a new l
ocation, the entire project had s
lipped
 
my mind.  However, I did look into the matter early last week to
 
f
ind that the recordings amde at Marymount were done on ten inch
 
(
professional s
ize) half inch tapes.  I a
sked that they be copied
 
f
or you, s
ince the originals could only be played on professional
 
s
tudio e
quipment, and I an sending under separate cover one copy
 
of the Molokan s
ongs recorded at Marymount on a f
ive inch reel, and
 
another on a cassette.  We will, of course, send you the original
 
reels if you have any facility for playing them.  Please just l
et
 
me know, and I
 will send them along immediately.
 
My only regret i
n my new job i
s not being able to take advantage
 
of a
ll the marvellous new friendships that came my way while working
 
on the California presentation.  P
lease don't forget me, and I shall
 
hope to be seeing you i
n another year at the latest.  My s
ister joins
 
me in sending you and a
ll our other Molokan friends our l
ove and
 
best wishes.
 
Affectionately your friend,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

ister says to be sure to tell Paul that her wheat a

Dear
 
As you know, my fxixxd fellow-workers and I have been trying to do
 
ax particularly hard job during the past several months: to choose
 
out of a
ll the thousands of talented and knowledgeable Californians
 
a very small number who could effectively represent our state a
t
 
the 1
975 Festival of American Folk L
ife in Washington, D
.C.
 
Lack of money has forced us regretfully to l
eave out many Californians,
 
such a
s yourself, whose participation in the Festival we would otherwise
 
welcome.  We are very hopeful that next year, when the Festival will
 
be much larger, we will have an adev1axtxzkadgz$ budget adequate to
 
a
llowing us to invite you at that time.  A record of your particular
 
area of skill will be kept in the Smithsonian f

1
.  CHICANOS  Since the charro presentation within proper context seems
 
impossible, my view is that the charro association will decline the
 
Smithsonian's invitation.  This throws the entire Chicano presentation
 
into some disarray.  Currently we are still planning to include the
 
following items
 (

_
 
muralists:  three well-known
 of the East
 
Los Angeles community will paint a mural (
location undecided) on the general
 
topic of the Chicano presentation oh the mall.
 It will be painted on canvas
 
for easier transportation and will be re-presented to the community upon
 
its arrival back home.  The mural will be brought in various stages of com-
pletion so that festival goers on each of the five days will have an example
 
of how a mural is constructed.  On Sunday, the muralists would like to have
 
their mural formally dedicated.
 
crafts -- paper flower making, pinata making, will be demonstrated
 
and flower making taught the spectators.
 Bread dough sculpture and paper
 
mache sculpture are additional options.
 
cooking -- masa grinding, tortilla making and tamale making
 
will be demonstrated in the cooking tent.
 
corrido concert -- a special concert including traditional
 
corridos from the Mexican revolutionary period, farm worker corridos and
 
contemporary urban corridos, translations to be flashed on a rear screen.
 
farm worker presentation -- a special concert concentrating on
 
the farm worker repertoire.  Currently we are considering an organizer-
singer from Calexico and a group consisting of two 60 year old brothers,
 
a 60 year old neighbor and a young daughter from Delano.  (
This group would
 
also participate in the corrido concert -- personnel: guitar, violin,
 
trumpet (
discreet) and two singers; total 4
.)
 J
."ol:

I will try to lor
pate some extra impressive music or craft to
 
make up for the xxx charros.
 
2
.  CHINESE  Shadow Play: a 45 minute presentation which can be given twice
 
daily but, since it is l
iterally an enchanting production, should be shared
 
with the childrens' section.  Performance includes demonstration and explana-
tion of the puppet figures.
 
Crafts.  Mrs. Ung, a distinguished craftswoman, will demonstrate
 
kite making of both northern and southern China (
together with explanations of
 
the styles and principles involved); she will a
lso demonstrate paper cuts.
 
Further she will supervise the teaching of how to make folded paper kites and
 
paper ribbon fish t for audience participation. .

Games:  Three traditional games will be demonstrated and taught on
 
the dance floor area: an early form of yoyo from northern China; shuttlecock,
 
which in China is played with feet only; and cats cradle.
 
Cooking:  Chinese cuisine from northern and southern regions will
 
be demonstrated and explained.
 
Music and dance:  this i
s iffy; the Chinese will make a recommendation
 
to me on this within the next ten days.
 
2
.
 
3
.  MOLOKANS.  These remarkable people will s
imply s
ing and explain their
 
traditions and past history.  They will serve not only to demonstrate
 
California's peculiar tolerance for religious variance but also to provide
 
a choral sound that i
s absolutely unique.
 I
t i
s possible they may wish to
 
demonstrate a special greeting ceremonial together with the making of tea
 
in a samovar, but this has not been worked out.
 
4
.  PORTUGUESE.  Fishing tradition.
 
Joseph Silva, foremost tuna boat designer of the US will demonstrate
 
boat design and i
llustrate model testing methods in the reflecting pool.
 (
His
 
current model i
s 8 feet l
ong; it can be tested for speed with varying bows
 
attached and the stabilizer principle can be demonstrated by putting some
 
youngsters in the reflecting pool with boards to make waves.)  Additionally,
 
net making and lure making will be demonstrated by l
ocal f
ishermen plus, hope-
fully, the singing of Portuguese sea and work chanteys.
 
Dairying tradition.
 
Preparation for the major festival of California Portuguese, the
 
Festa da Espiritu Santu" will be demonstrated by the following activities:
 
Making of Portuguese sweet bread (
in fancy braids and coils)
 
Construction of paper f
lowers which are sewn into blankets and
 
garlands to decorate the black and white Holstein cows
 
Regular milking demonstrations in the barn
 
Rehearsal of the chamaritas, the traditional Portuguese square
 
dance, which will be demonstrated and taught the spectators.
 
The final celebration will involve parading the decorated cows
 
through the festival accompanied by the orchestra and participants, ceremonial
 
milking, a milk and bread feast, the sing%"r desafio (
a traditional contest
 
between solo s
ingers who improvise verses), and a final chamaritas in which
 
the audience can join in.
 
Other Portuguese participants include a ballad s
inger from
 
Madeira, a fado singer, and a small mandolin orchestra.
 
t 
5
.  CUPENOS.  These southern California Indians are extremely anxious to
 
demonstrate the work of their cultural center, the only one among the southern
 
tribes.  They are offering to bring to the festival the following activities:
 
acorn mush making
 
hand games
 
traditional dance and song
 
story telling
 
a demonstration of their bi-lingual program, using a few children
 
and some older tribal members as "walking dictionaries".
 
A final determination on the extent of Cupeno participation will be worked out
 
next week when I will visit the tribal council and the cultural center.
 
6
.  BLACKS.  This group includes
 
a fine traditional gospel quartet, 4 brothers, resident a
ll their
 
l
ives in Fresno and proud to have been influenced by the Golden Gate Quartet
 
a Kansas City blues style pianist, who is an excellent s
inger
 
a blues guitarist, not yet selected
 
hopefully, a black French-speaking ballad s
inger (
Louisiana in
 
origin) now resident in a small black c
ommunity outside Los Angeles.

8
. FILIPINOS  We plan to use here
 
a small mandolin orchestra (
3-4 people, o
ldsters)
 
4 young people who will divide their time between the craft tent
 
where they will demonstrate the common home craft of making paper Christmas
 
lanterns (
reaching sometimes 5 feet in height) and the "tinakling", the
 
traditional Philippine s
tick dance (
demonstrated and taught for audience
 
participation).
 
9
. MEDITERRANEANS
 This presentation is far l
imited to crafts:
 
a Greek father and son who will demonstrate traditional beehive
 
construction out of woven s
traw; the son (
college-educated) can also give in-
formation on bee-keeping and agricultural use of bees
 
an Armenian rug-weaver (
male) and an Armenian wool spinner (
female)
 
an additional participant may be an Assyrian drummer who performs
 
marvellously well in solo and who might also fit in well with the Lebanese
 
presentation in OWNW.
 
10.  BELL RINGERS.
 If the cable car can be present, bell ringing conductors
 
will announce each session at the main California s
tage and dance f
loor.  On
 
one day, at least, of the festival, a formal contest will be held among the
 
ringers;  (
blacks and Irish are among the competitors -
- they show great variance
 
in styles).
 
(
There are at l
east two other possibilities which factors of time and budget
 
may e
liminate: a group of Rumanian# singers and dancers recommended by Dick
 
Crum; and three I
talian bagpipe and oboe players recommended by Anna Lomax.)

.
 
SPECIAL EVENTS
 
Singles:
 
1
.  Dedication of the Chicano mural
 
2
.  Portuguese "festal'
 
3
.  Chicano party.
 (
With the e
limination of the charros this
 
may not prove practical; we had planned them to host a Chicano-Mexican fiesta
 
with s
inging, dancing, tamale consumption and pinata breaking.)
 
Cross-cultural:
 
1
.  An evening of waltzes (
audience invited to dance) accompanied
 
by the Philippino, Mexican mariachi (
borrowed from OWNW), Portuguese and
 
s
outhern white orchestras.
 
2
.  A mandolin concert featuring Kenny Hall (
a unique technician),
 
the blue-grass mandolinist, the Portuguese mandolinist and the F
ilipino mandolinists.
 
3
.  A quartet s
ing featuring the Wright Brothers (
the gospel quartet)
 
and the Don Par m
ely blue-grass band.
 (
This should be smashing.)
 
4
.  A Sunday morning religious c
oncert, including the gospel quartet,
 
the blue-grass orchestra, Otis Pearce (
white s
inger), Earl Collins (
who plays
 
religious tunes on his f
iddle) and possibly the Molokans.  Additional partici-
pation by the other e
thnic groups has not yet been checked out.
 
The basic theme of the California presentation seems to be the c
elebration of
 
human skills and artistry when given the same basic bank of materials with
 
which to work.  Each culture then uses these materials and s
kills to produce
 
their own unique traditional contribution to the general artistic health of
 
their own and their neighbor c
ommunities.  We seem to have several unifying
 
themes running throughout the presentation:
 
1
.
 The joy of s
ociable dancing, demonstrated by square dancing,
 
the Portuguese chamaritas, the F
ilipine t
inikling and the waltz evening.
 
2
.
 The grade of food, demonstrated by Chinese, Mexican, Armenian
 
and Portuguese chefs.
 
3
.
 '
The usefulness of paper, demonstrated by the Chinese paper
 
cuts, kites and paper folding techniques, the Philippine paper l
anterns, the
 
Chicano paper f
lowers, pinatas and paper mache, and the Portuguese paper f
lowers.
 
4
.
 The beauty of the human voice, demonstrated by concerts of
 
solo s
inging (
Portuguese, Anglo, French and black) and in groups (
Russian
 
Molokans, Anglos, Chicanos and blacks).
 
5
.
 The excitement of fhythm, demonstrated by the cable car bell
 
ringers and the Assyrian drummer.
 
6
.
 The prevalence of the s
tringed instrument in western culture,
 
demonstrated by a
ll the orchestras (
white, Portuguese, Philippino and Chicano)
 
and particularly the importance of the mandolin (
white -
- two styles, Philippine,
 
and Portuguese).
 
S
.
 
All the f
oregoing will be presented in varying c
ombinations, so that the
 
f
estival g
oer can savor the s
imilarities and the d
ifferences that make
 
l
ife both wholesome and s
timulating.
 
These point will be further demonstrated by
 
the California f

Dear
 
The following remarks, which I hope you will.#read not once but several times
 
before arriving in Washington, are excerpted from a letter Alan Lomax wrote
 
in evaluating last year's festival.  Please take serious note of theca.  On
 
ou-r
. ability to meet the challenges laid doi,,
n here will depend the success
 
of our presentation on the mall, and, much more importantly, the ultimate
 
effect of our presentation on the home coimunities.
 
.
..I have a mounting feeling, which I have picked up at every festival
 
I have attended, that too many of the people having to do with the choice,
 
the presentation and the care of the singers are not sufficiently versed
 
in the living material of the field to supervise the programming in the
 
festival.  The folk brought to 1
1
,ashington have the whole job and seem
 
left to run their own shows as they see fit, largely, I believe, because
 
the personnel staff is not sufficiently versed in -their repertory and
 
thus wisely decide to stay.
.out of the picture.  The performers may know
 
well what is to be done at home, or what would have gone over with their
 
audiences thirty years ago, but frequently their presentations could be
 
improved if they had worked on them a bit with someone who understood
 
them and their problems.
 
I take it that the a
im of this festival is not just to maL
ze A
i
r;erica proud
 
of i
ts folklore but to provide support for the big river of oral tradition
 
which i
s now being dissipated and corrupted a
ll over the p
lanet.  l
Ve
 
cannot foresee what we would do if we did not have this river o
:L pure
 
creativity always revivifying our culture, but l
ife would be a
. very s
orry
 
thing if it is dried t
ip.  The festival beats a big dram for rolklore on
 
a national l
evel
., but it is doubtful whether this is of much use to the
 
separate traditions and to their carriers -
- for these traditions are
 
l
ocal and their carriers depend on l
ocal audiences.  In my mind then, the
 
most important thing that the festival can do is to aid and strengthen
 
the s
ingers (
performers).  As a performer myself, I know that bad experienc
 
with ignorant audiences can turn you off for
. l
ire.
 
I know that when an authentic performer is topped by a non-authentic one,
 
and the non-authentic gets the b
i
-g hand, the genuine perFormer may be hurt
 
f
or l
ife.  The festival thus may d
ajnage s
ingers.  For this reason there
 
needs to be somebody always on hand at the performances who is taking
 
care that these real and sensitive people that you brim; from quiet. places
 
into noisy Washington are not hurt.  '
I think that most of them might be
 
easily helped, provided -t
he s
taff makes sure that they not only receive
 
l
ots of TLC on the festival grounds, but are -t
reated a bit l
ike royalty.
 
They are indeed royalty, each one an important artist in h
-
is own genre,
 
and it i
s their privilege to have tenperai:ient and be taken care of if they
 
are being a
sked t
o e
xhibit on your big stages.
 
But the TLC should go further than that.  It should be using the -estival
 
period to help develop the confidence of the artist, his solse of his worth
 
in co!itparison to other artists and other aesthetic -t
raditions so that ,he:t
 
he goes back home he can work more confidently i
t his own c
omil
jm
 city.
 
When I was young, I spent time with Guthrie, Leadbelly, Josh 1
0iite, Burl
 
Ives and others, and I consider the t
ime I gave them the most valuable
 
cultural work I ever did.  If I was helpful, it was because I care very
 
much for the singers' art and what they had to say...
 
This is a new profession, this folklorist work with culture.  It can't
 
be carried out with show biz standards -
- "We've got that performance
 
off the stage, thank God, now let's get on with the nett and get away
 
t
s
ickly to the party afterward."  There should not be a single person at
 
he festival who feels that way, because the opportunity you have during
 
those weeks is to strengthen the carriers of all kinds of cultures for
 
the bitter hard struggles they have at home, faced with T
.V. and indiff
.erencl
 
pretty largely.  In other words, I feel that the staff should be oriented
 
to work like devoted and wise young angels with the artists who come to
 
the grounds...
 
Lastly, on the question of authenticity, scientific aestheticians have
 
shown that well-trained art experts agree in their choices of the "best"
 
with people .
from the oral traditions themselves, even when they are not
 
members of these traditions.  This finding about art applies also to folklor , 
and culture.  The folklorist and the anthropologist and the devoted amateur
 
improve their perceptions of the quality of the activity or lore they
 
become interested i
n.  They are the protectors of this part of the human
 
environment.  We must depend upon the folklore
. expert and the anthropologist
 
whose job it is to care about the quality of culture, to keep the festival
 
at the high standard it has so far maintained, and to improve that standard.
 
We do not yet have a science of folklore, therefore the standards of
 
authenticity carried by the performers on the one hand, and the scholars
 
on the other, are all we've got to keep the river
, not just pure, but to
 
keep it flowing at all...
 
l
'
t
i
'
_
ith the above remarks in mind, I should l
ike to establish the following (
;round
 
rules for all presentations in the California section:
 
1
.  No concert, workshop or other major performance is to take place without a
 
f
ield-worker-presenter being there throughout.  He/she should start the event
 
off and set the tone.  It is also the field worker's responsibility to stop the
 
session reasonably on time, c
losing out, if possible on an up-beat s
o that everyone
 
goes away f
.eeling successful.
 
2
.  1
'
v
,hen the presenter is working with articulate performers, he/she may, not need
 
to m
.c. in any formal sense.  It is important for the festival goers to experience
 
the performers not only as ar tists but as thoughtful and interesting human beings
 
as well; many of our performers are quite capable of providing their own commentary
 
and this should be encouraged.  Some may best be presented in terms of a quiet
 
interview, the presenter remaining o
n stage, asking occasional questions and
 
suggesting interesting tunes or rominding the performer of good stories and the
 
l
ike.  Translations can often be handled effectively this vay.  Other good talkers
 
may bo able to take over entirely on their o
,an.  It still remains the responsi. :
i
.
lit
 
of the presenter to control the overall pace a
cid effect of the show; l
ie should
 
s
t
.arid ready at all times to intervene tactfully if anytliin" whatever is interfering
 
our goal: to present the traditional artists of California in their very
 
3
w
.  This kind of self-effacing program guidance requires two things:
 
that the presenter be quite familiar with the performer's repertoire. You
 
should wort. out a l
ist of songs and tunes and games and stories between you and
 
carry it with
 ~
` `1
st
.  The performer, under unfamiliar pressures, may
 
forget his best material; you should be ready to remind him.
 
that the presenter and performer(s) work out a program together in advance.  
This can vary in presentational detail from a completely scheduled and ordered
 
list of songs to be sung to a "
let's each one play the first fiddle tune he ever
 
learned" idea.  However, no performer should get up on one of those stages with-
out having some kind of idea of what he is expected to do, and without some prior
 
feedback from his field worker as to what i
s the most effective way to do it.
 
4
.  All concerts or workshops should include some informational content. Our pur-
pose is to excite and interest as well as entertain; but excitement can be
 
engendered by presenting not only new songs and new music and dances, but by
 
new ideas and new information also, to s
tretch our l
isteners' horizons a bit.
 
Long speeches should obviously be avoided; however, some
: little item of substance
 
should be a requisite of every program.  This can be done on several levels:
 
Folkloric or ethnomusicological commentary.  When you are planning this,
 
please be sure your information is as accurate as possible.  I have heard shockingl
 
inaccurate remarks tossed off at folly
, music concerts.
 
Historical or geographic commentary.  Remarks about the history of your own
 
performers' people in California would be of interest to most Easterners.  Bear in
 
mind that we have a bibliography on California available in the newsletter, the
 
Sour Dough Crock, as well as an extremely well selected stock of paperback books
 
on California for sale at the book stall under the supervision of Nicky Daval,
 
a young librarian who is well up on the available literature.  Festival goers who
 
stump you may be referred to her.
 
General remarks about the themes of the California presentation.  These have
 
worked out to be very s
imple, but they are t
i
-
:
orth stating here:
 
A
.  California is in a temperate climate with a year-round growing season; we
 
are thus the most important food-producing state in the union.  To easterners
 
who perhaps have only flow-i
i into San Francisco or Los Angeles, this t
rill come
 
as a real surprise; they appear to think of us as a
. cluster of industrial
_
 
metropolises separated by desert.  Many of the peoples represented by our
 
performers came here originally as agricultural workers:  Philippi -as, Portugue
 
Chicanos, many Chinese, Anglos from the rural south, etc.  The year-round
 
climate, moreover, gives our farm workers a chance at more residential stabili
 
in the east, farm workers
.-must move the year long frog,
,
-
 state to state.
 
B
.  In sprite of a really striking degree of surface conformity in terms of
 
public behaviors, Californians have retained their ethnicity to an equally
 
striking degree.  We do not know if this i
s unique to California; we only
 
know that this is what we have found here.  In my visiting round the state,
 
this has been the most impressive feature; almost every l
ivi
.ngroom I have
 
been in has been alike -
- all nice conventional middle-class-style homes --
almost everyone dressed alike -
-
- s
lacks and sport shirts for the men, fashiona
 
pant suits and bouffant hairdos fox the women.  But the honisland languages are
 
still alive, from Assyrian to Russian to Chinese to Tagalog; the cuisines
 
are still, alive; the music and dance and stories are still there, and still
 
beautiful.  It has made me wonder if perhaps the surface conformity may not
 
serve the crucial function of allowing all these extraordinarily varied
 
p0pUlations to l
ive together in a degree of social peace, while maintaining
 
their uniqueness in a decent privacy.
 
C
.  California traditional arts, as e
lsewhere, are learned in the family -
-
most frequently handed down from grand-parent to parent to child.  We did
 
not set out to prove this; it s
imply emerged from the fieldwork.  Almost no
 
group appearing in our presentation is without a familial representation;
 
we have f
.
our brothers (
the black gospel quartet), a three-generation
 
family of fiddlers, five Chicano artists and cooks of the same family
 
(
mother, son, two daughters and daughter-in-law), etc. etc.  This s
imple
 
fact -
- the way tradition works -
- i
s worth pointing out to our audiences
 
from time to time.  I
t may cause them to re-evaluate and re-examine their
 
own family traditions.
 
S
.  As a
. last point, I think I must make plain that all the foregoing requirements
 
add up to a potentially unnerving conclusion: as practicing cultural workers, you
 
are going to have to make choices on the mall, with and for your people.  This is
 
applied folklore with a vengeance, and this realization may be difficult for some
 
folklorists and anthropologists whose training has been to ob
-serve and not interfere
 
Here, interference will be required of you, s
ince many of the ultimate decisions
 
will be yours.  Don't let this throw you; because of your friendship with and
 
knowledge of your performers, you are the best qualified persons there are to do
 
this particular job.  So be confident and represent your people the best way you
 
know hoer.  It will probably be the best way there is.
 
At the end of this excruciatingly long letter (
I an reminded of the great Oscar
 
Wilde line -
- "I am in too much haste to write briefly"), I should like to say
 
that I am very proud of the level of work that has been carried on .
in California,
 
both
. in field research and in the endless details of assembling this presentation
 
and bringing all 1
12 of our performers to Washington in good health and spirits.
 
You have all shown the highest level of social responsibil=ity; the Smithsonian
 
could not possibly afford to pay for the volunteer hours you all have worked, and
 
the thought and expertise you have put into your recommendations.  I -t
hink we w iLll
 
all find ourselves rewarded on the mall when the l
ovely th-i
.ngs we have planned
 
together come into reality, but I
'd l
ike to say a personal thank-you to each one
 
right now.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
JUST A FEW REMAINING DETAILS...
 
1
.  I am enclosing the schedule for the California presentation which will be
 
printed in the festival brochure.  We only l
earned of the deadline the day it
 
cane to pass, so there was no time to consult you and l
ittle time to consider.
 
Please go over it carefully and note any discrepancies or necessary revisions.
 
Then please jot down the names of the participants for which you are responsible
 
uncles the times when they will be appearing.  This l
ist should be mailed or
 
phoned to us (
213-450-3112).  We want to be able to give each participant his
 
own personal schedule before we begin.  Please a
lso schedule yourselves (
as
 
presenters) and don't over-do it; we have enough people to fill in.
 
For your information, "c" before a listing indicates a concert; "w" means a
 
workshop (
including informal presentations with audience questioning, interviews,
 
audience participation activities, etc.)  One asterisk: (
*) means that the event
 
will take place on the main stage with the associated dance floor; two (
**)
 
means the workshop stage facing the reflecting pool; three (
***) means the
 
second workshop stage, location at present unsettled.
 
A separate schedule is attached for the craft workers and the cook tent.  There
 
will be a few "roving" performers, especially A
ir. Concepcion, our Philippine
 
yo-yo expert; also the Portuguese ladies are being invited to bring their
 
crochet and simply sit around where they can chat with the needle-workers in
 
the audience.  Since
_ these people are not being formally presented, they do not
 
have assigned field workers and are thus in danger'of feeling lonely or
 
unappreciated or over-worked.  I would greatly appreciate it if each field'
 
worker would keep an especial eye out for them.
 
2
.  At the Regional Headtauarters (
air conditioned!!I) will be Diana Parker,
 
who is i
n charge of all performers i
n the area and Dorothy Newman, who.is in
 
charge of all physical supplies.  Bill McNeill, Charles Camp, Barbara Rabin
 
and I will all be working out of the  
l
ead
 v
niarters, and there are several
 
volunteer runners as well.  Don't sit and'suffer; let us know what's wrong.
 
3
. Each evening immediately after supper at Marymount there will be a brief
  
meeting of all field workers and presenters for a resum- of the day's problems.
 
This is a must, but I promise to keep it short.
 
4
.  Lastly, p
l
.ea
.se paste the following in your hat, or keep it otherwise always
 
accessible.  In the participants' insturctions, the telephone number that is
 
l
isted as the one to be called if anybody is lost or in difficulties is the
 
l
ine to the general Smithsonian switchboard.  Presenters, or any participant
 
who might conceivably get into trouble, should instead call Diana, who will
 
answer the following number:
 (
202) 381-67 ,1
1.  Diana i
s a kind of miracle
 
worker
., and a
ll problems can be safely deposited with her.
 
ADDEM)MM  (
Not required, but you would get an extra strin(; on your heavenly
 
harp if you could do this)  Please try to notify your local newspaper or radio/TV
"
 
station about the performers who will be going from their town.  It would be
 
1
1
.1XVvellous  for the local communities to see their own artists' pictures in th(
 ,
 
piper or on the tube.  Again, it's what happens at home that's really important.
 
COOKING DEMONSTRATION SCHEDULE
-
The cooking area contains two complete kitchens, facing in opposite directions
 
i
:
ith an additional small unit on the side between.  Thus we can carry on two
 
different cooking demonstrations s
imultaneously while finishing-up work or
 
smaller operations can occupy the l
ittle unit.  Announcement boards will be
 
posted at each end of the cooking area; these are plastic and the day's "menus"
 
can be written on them with crease pencil and changed, when necessary, as  th e 
day goes on.
 
We have worked out the following suggested schedule for the cooking demonstrations;
 
field workers should discuss the schedule with the cooks in their groups to
 
determine if the t
imes allotted are practical.  I
t w
ill be }
lot there; don't
 
let your chefs overdo.  Clean-up and set-up cooperation will be of course essential.

Daily:

SPECIAL NOTE:  On Thursday and Friday the Philippine chefs could perhaps occupy
 
the small kitchen unit .
for a demonstration between 2
:00 and 3
:30 while the
 
Portuguese baking goes on.  Also the Assyrian ladies will be ver y busy spinning,
 
baking and helping with the dance demonstrations; daily tea making may be too much.
 
AUZII:Qut to lunch" sign is always a possibility.
 
CRAFT TENT SCHEDULE
 
There will be t
}Zree craft tents, each with a plastic announcement board as above.
 
Please work out suitable schedules among the crafts people so that some activity
 
is taking place in each tent at all t
imes between 1
1:00 and 5
:00.  Both crafts
 
and cooking demonstrations must close at 5
:00 so that mat er ials can  be secure
d
 
for the night.
 
A nearby table arrangement will be set up for paper craft teaching; a schedule
 
for use of this area should be worked out between the Chicano and
. Chinese craft
 
workers.  In between teaching sessions, the Portuguese ladies might wish to ex-
pand into this area during the early part of the week in order to prepare the
 
decorations for their festa on Saturday; it might also be used by our crocheters
 
whon not deeded for craft teaching purposes.

Special note to craftspeople:  Scissors Sam i
s a knife and scissors sharpener
 
who works entirely by hand, using files, and has published a small book on
 
the art of s
harpening small tools at home._  Crafts workers and cooks are
 
invited to give their tools to Scissors Sam for his expert attention; personally,
 
I intend to bring a
long a
ll the dull scissors I have around the place -
-
 
after all, he has to have something to demonstrate with!

t's just another exploitative
 
a

The Watts towers

beautiful because
 
in Watts, in that desolate, featureless, trash-littered urban sprawl.  They were
 
f
orced 
 out of

• me, by
 
T
bu
ow
rn
e r
s
forever underneath that particular s
pot on the earth's surface.  But if the

lse, say in Santa Monica
 
guished surburban neighborhood or over by UCLA, they would l
ook l
ike the junk of
 
which they are c
onstructed, and I would probably have s
igned the neighborhood
 
protest petition.
 
The reason I am belaboring this i
s because for me i
t's a crucial point.  I am
 
not suggesting that "
those people" have their art and it's all very nice for them,
 
Tu—t not f
or me, and s
o I want i
t l
eft in "their" neighborhood.  I am suggesting
 
that we must be very careful and quite c
lear in our conception of what we really
 
want t
o s
ay about
and
 believe,

c
onnectes

.  
m
eA
th
ni
dn
 g
thus we have to be extraordinarily cautious when we take art
 
out of i
ts context -
- and this applies, of course, to music and dance as well.
 
• me about
 
a museum c
ontext.  I guess i
t comes from an episode in my o
ld days a
s an Almanac
 
when s
ome ordinary union
•
 Detroit came to us and said they wished we would
 
d
cr
lo
et
sh
s eu
sp more when we sang at union meetings because they a
lways put on their best
 
• hear us.  We had thought we were l
ooking
though
 
N
  
i 
more beautiful ,
 more joyous, more meaningful . The Watts towers are a meaningful
 
statement in a working -c
lass context ;
 pulled out of context , they'd be in danger
 
of l
ooking l
ike a cheap orange julius stand.  Maybe we can show them -
- and the
 
mud f
lat sculptures as well.,aith photographs, but they'd have to be awfully,
 
awfully good ones.
 
Dammit, I really want this to be a working -class festival.  I want everything
 
in it to be a celebration of the common man, of his creativity and eternal
 
restless pursuit of meaning and coherence and dignity . That's why I
'm so hung
 
up on the cable car bell ringers ; they seem to me a microcosm of what we want
 
to demonstrate . Here are people working with the every-day of their experience,
 
taking something they have to do every five minutes as part of their job, and
 
adding to it that tiny injection of human passion and aesthetic impulse that
 
distinguishes man from the other primates . Admittedly  it's not high art, but
 
it's real, and it is a
ll we really have to celebrate. �
u-
'-
 
So I don't want the California presentation to be a pop art celebration; I
 
don't want it even to smell l
ike a pop art celebration . Every s
ingle artistic
 
presentation we make has to come out of the basic working-class l
ife fabric -
-
not out of the ad-man, quick-and-shoddy, self-indulgent "mainstream" that so
 
often spells "California" -
- and it has to be presented so as to demonstrate
 
its c
lear relationship with that l
ife fabric and seem l
ogical and inevitable
 
and marvellous because of that recognizable relationship.
 
You probably e
ither already know a
ll this or e
lse profoundly disagree.  However,
 
it seemed to me that in our telephone conversation we were drifting -
- myself
 
included -
- in some very peculiar directions, and I wanted to write this mostly
 
to straighten my own thinking out.  I
'd be glad to hear your reactions.

P
.S.  After re-reading this, I honestly don't know whether I
'm setting up a
 
straw man or throwing down a gauntlet . Some days I feel the generation gap more
 
poignantly than others.  But I did want you to know where I stand -
- and I wanted
 
me to know where I stand -
- so that a decision can be made as to whether this
 
kind of perspective i
s what should be brought to bear on the California presenta-
tion.  As far as I
'm concerned , I
'm afraid it's the only perspective I
've got
 
handy, or ever will have for that matter.  In one l
ife, there's a l

nto a c
one-like s
tructure.  Next, one weaves very t
hin
 
f
lexible twigs around the branches i
n an i
nterlacing f
ashion.  The outcome i
s a cone-
s
haped basket with very t
hick walls and an open bottom.  The outside of the basket i
s

resh c
ow dung and a

TEN years ago this S
eptember the most i

ispute b
etween g

which launched the f
irst s
uccessful drive t

nd s
truck the

or d

egin-

s
 
s
hoppers were urged t
o boycott table g
rapes.
 
BECAUSE virtually a

arm workers have been and a

as had meaning f

the character of i

ersion of t
he Mexican r
ound-
backed vihuela. According t
o Jesus S
anchez Valencia of Z
acoalco, Jalisco, a l
ife-
l
ong t
raditional v
iolinist, t
he mariachi of t
he 1
920's c
onsisted of a small number
 
of v
iolins, a f
ive-stringed guitarron (
a s
ixth s
tring was added i
n 1
929), and a
 
v
ihuela. Later, i
n t
he 1
930's, one group began u
sing a t
rumpet, a

ludes trumpets, violins, vihuela, s
tandard s
ix-string g

s
uccessful g

IN the past f

isen c
onsiderably i

arity.  S
inging f
amilies and members of s
inging families have had great effect upon
 
this growth.  The Carter F
amily, the S
tonemans, the R
itchies, the Monroe Brothers,
 
a
ll worked out of their f
amily music traditions i
n the production of their profes-
s
ional recordings and performances.
 
HO W-MAID music goes on t

ar r
emoved f

and O

n the 1

s

s whaler-men that the men of P
ico,
 
F
aial, San Miguel, T
erceira and the o
ther i
slands came t
o t
he United S

I
N t
he United S

he Azores (
and of o
ther P
ortuguese
 
i
slands, particularly Madeira a
nd t
he Cape Verdes) s
ettled i
n two main a
reas:  one
 
g
roup i

f New England, a
nd the o
ther g

i

hose who had b
een i

s
ettled primarily i
n t
he f
ishing ports a
long the s
outhern c
oast while those who had
 
engaged i
n a
griculture s
ettled i
n t
he f
ertile i

i
ndustry, thrift, a
nd a s
trong s
ense of c

or survival on t

i

o b
e valuable a
ssets i
n t
heir new c
ountry and the P
ortuguese f
ish-
e
rmen and f
armers quickly r
ose t
o prominence i
n their r
espective professions.
 
THE premium catch i
n the S
outhern California f
ishing i
ndustry when the
 
P
ortuguese began f
ishing t
hese waters was t
he a
lbacore tuna, whose white, t
asty meat
 
made tuna a d
esirable f
ood t
hroughout the United S

ppeared off San
 
D
iego a
round July of e
ach year, r
anged briefly northward a
long the c
oast t
o S
anta
 
Barbara, t
hen d
isappeared back i

During t
he s
ummer months the f
ishermen t

rom small s

based boats a
s f
ast a
s t
hey c

chools s
eemed e
ndless and a l
arge i
ndustry
 
a
rose based o
n the a
lbacore.

THEN, i
n 1
926, a s
trange t
hing happened.  The a
lbacore began t
o d
isappear.
 
They no l
onger arrived each July off San D
iego, but began s
hifting f
urther and further
 
out t
o s
ea.  A s
earch f
or t
he elusive f
ish i
n c
oastal waters off Mexico proved t
o be
 
fruitless and t
he f
ishing i
ndustry d
eclined dramatically.  L
ed mainly by P
ortuguese
 
skippers, the hunt moved i
nto the d
eep water off t
he s
hore; t
rips t
o the Hawaiian
 
I
slands and t
he Galapagos became c
ommon.
 
E
VENTUALLY new f
ishing areas were d
iscovered a
nd by the beginning of t
he
 
1
930s t
he i
ndustry had broken out of i
ts d
ecline.  But the nature of the i
ndustry had
 
changed drastically.  The new f
ishing grounds were f
ar off shore, t
he boats had t
o
 
k
eep t
o s
ea f
or much l
onger periods than b
efore, a
nd navigation had t
o be more precise.
 
Taking the f
ish by net was d
iscarded i
n f
avor of t
aking t
hem by hook a
nd pole; hauling
 
2
00 or more pounds of f
ighting tuna out of a r
ough s
ea by brute s
trength was a r
ough
 
j
ob, even with two or t
hree men on each l
ine.  The work was l
ong, hard, and very
 
d
angerous... but t
he P
ortuguese were up t
o i
t and quickly outstripped t
he c
ompetition
 
f
rom t
he I
talians and Chinese who had a
lso f
ished t
he coastal a
lbacore.
 
A new k
ind of boat--the "
tuna c
lipper"--was d
eveloped f
or t
he new i
ndustry.
 
L
arge, s
trong, d
eep-sea boats, their d
esign was originated i
n San D
iego by Manuel
 
Madruga.  They carried a t
all bait t
ank aft, a
nd had c
radles s
uspended over the s
ides
 
of t
he boat i
n which the men s
tood while f
ishing.  When a s
chool of tuna was s
ighted,
 
t
he boat would s
teer a course t
o i
ntercept.  A man called t
he "
chummer" wouls s
tand
 
a
top t
he bait t
ank and t
oss s
coopfuls of l
ive bait out i
nto the water around the boat.
 
Once t
he tuna began a
ttacking the bait, t
he f
ishermen would drop their l
ines i
nto t
he
 
water armed with barbless disguised a
s s
quid.  When a t
una s
truck a "
squid" t
he men
 
would s
et the hook, haul t
he f
ish up i
nto t
he a
ir over t
heir h
eads and i
nto t
he boat,
 
a
nd then whip t
he hook f
ree and s
end i
t back i
nto t
he water a
gain--all i
n one f
luid
 
movement.  I
t was s
aid that i
f you d
idn't have another tuna on t
he hook i
n the water
 
while t
he f
irst t
una was s
till i
n the a
ir, then you weren't a r
eal f
isherman!
 
THIS s
tyle of f
ishing c
ontinued virtually unchanged until t
he mid-1950s.
 
Then a s
econd r
evolution i
n f
ishing t
echnique t
ook place.  As t
he t
una became more
 
a
nd more e
lusive, f
ishing with hook and l
ine began t
o l
ose f
avor a
nd netting, or
 
"
seining," became t
he a
ccepted practice.  Again, a new k
ind of boat was d
eveloped:
 
t
he "
purse-seiner," a large, deep-water boat with an enormous net s
towed i
n a
 neat
 
pile on i
ts after d
eck.  The net--which i
n the l
arger s
einers exceeds 3
/4 mile in
 
l
ength--is handled by means of a t
all crane with a "power b
lock" a
t i
ts t
ip; i
t was
 
t
he d
evelopment of the power block i
n the 1
950s which made i
t possible t
o build
 
s
einers big e
nough t
o make a profit.
 
THE purse-seiners f
ish i
n t
he f
ollowing manner:  when the tuna a
re s
ighted,
 
t
he boat draws a
longside of the s
chool and drops a large s
kiff f
rom t
he s
tern.  One
 
e
nd of t
he net i
s a
ttached t
o t

M

PAPA —Why do I

And t

You have t

Then a

WHY CADDY GOT MR. GORDON
 
OUT OF JAIL
 
Caddy got married t
o a
 Mr. Gordon. Getting
 
married i
n t
hose days wasn't l
i
ke getting
 
married t
oday. Caddy n
ever bothered t
o go
 
t
o a
 p
reacher o
r a
nything. I
t
 was e
nough f
or
 
t
wo people t
o want t
o be marr
ied. Anyway,
 
Caddy wanted a
 l
ast name f
or h
er c
hildren
 
a
nd Mr. Gordon was w
illing t
o
 g
ive t
hem h
is.
 
I
t
's i
mportant f
or c
hildren t
o have a
n h
onest
 
l
ast name. Now Mr. Gordon was n
ot a
 v
ery
 
good man, b
ut he d
id have a
n h
onest l
ast
 
name a
nd h
e l
e
t Caddy have i
t
 f
or t

d

ut up w

is l

d
idn't s
ay t
oo much. F
inally, t
hough, he l
e
ft
 
Caddy a
nd got h
imself a
nother w

got married t
o a Mr. Rucker. Now Mr.
 
Rucker was a
 good man, hard work
ing a
nd
 
a
l
l b
ut h
e d
ied ear
ly. Caddy worked hard
 
a
nd s
aved her money. One day s
he heard
 
t
hat Mr. Gordon had gotten h
imself i
n
 s
ome
 
k
ind o
f t
rouble a
nd was going t
o be s

o
 
j

h

i
ght u
p t
o
 t
he c
ourthouse, marched
 
r
i
ght u
p t

tood before t

j
udge. She r
eached down u
nder her s
k

and put t

"
