Dear Mr. Spivacke:
Not one time have I said to hurry on the machine to me. Truly March 1 or March 15
or even April 1 would be ample time to disturb these peaceful days of soft, springtime
weather, the nightly singing of the Fiddler Crabs, the charming fragrances of blooming
rosebuds. Take your time, look properly after Mrs. Coolidge and don't worry about Your
friend,

I apologize for frequent letters. Alan Lomax thought my letters to you lacked specific
information.
