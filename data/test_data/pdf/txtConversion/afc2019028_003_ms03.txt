ALC: So when you were growing up on the farm did your family have a milk cow?
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Okay, okay.
HA: Yep.
ALC: So then would you have to, who would be responsible for making the butter? Would that
be your mom or the kids?
8
HA: It’d be my mom, sit and churn it. [unintelligible] I think she shook it...in a quart jar.
ALC: She’d just shake it in a quart jar?
[10:00] HA: Yeah, yeah. And then, later on, you come with the…
ALC: The crank, the hand crank?
HA: Yeah [unintelligible]
ALC: Yep, yep, and would that be something the kids would do?
HA: Yeah something the kids would do. I had three sisters.
ALC: And so your father was the one who bought this ground.
HA: Yeah.

ALC: Just down south
HA: Yeah
ALC: In Lawrence County?

HA: Pretty much all of it. All the meat that’s you know...
ALC: Yep
HA: Harvested and [unintelligible]
ALC: Mmm-hmm, and did you have a smokehouse?
HA: No, no.
ALC: How would you preserve the meat for the winter?
HA: They would uh, put it in barrels, put it in barrels and smoke it out in the yard, and then put
in, kind of wrap it in [unintelligible]
ALC: Okay, and did you have, would it get salted or sugared?
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Okay, okay, did you ever do maple trees and tap for sugar?
HA: No, no.
ALC: Okay, alright, alright, so it was salted then.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Yeah, yep
HA: Yeah, curing rabbits. Wintertime, hang ‘em out there and then they’d freeze outdoors.
ALC: Wow, and before you even skinned ‘em?
HA: No we skinned ‘em.
ALC: You skinned ‘em, and then you’d just hang ‘em outdoors to freeze.
HA: Yeah freeze yeah
ALC: Okay, and that way you could keep ‘em.
HA: Yeah for a while.
ALC: How high would you have to hang them? Cause wouldn’t something come and try to eat
it?
10
HA: Yeah, [unintelligible] you hang ‘em up high. And you put your apples in the ground, put a
board up over top of ‘em, and put dirt over top, and have apples too...
ALC: I had heard somebody talk about this and they said, “we bury our apples” and I couldn’t
figure out what that meant.
HA: Yeah, put straw in there first.
ALC: Okay.
HA: Put the apples in there first, I mean straw, straw, and then roll the straw up around.
ALC: Okay.
HA: And then put boards in there. Put a board you know…[unintelligible] so the water runoff.
ALC: So like in a tip almost like a little roof, Peaked up.
HA: Uh-huh, and then put your dirt up on top of that.
ALC: wow, wow, and that’s how you’d…
HA: Stay all Winter.
ALC: They’d stay all Winter, and would you eat those out of hand or bake with them?
HA: No, whatever you wanted.
ALC: Wow
HA: Go out there, had another little hole in there where you could, you know, go in there and get
‘em.
ALC: And you’d do that when you were a kid is that how your parents preserved them?
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Yeah, yeah, wow.  Did they ever…
HA: Mom, mom had a what-do-you call dried apples.
ALC: Okay!
HA: Hang ‘em on a string.
ALC: Wow, and how’d she dry ‘em?
11
HA: Just put ‘em out in the sunlight let ‘em dry.
ALC: Wow, wow,
HA: [unintelligible]
ALC: So you had, when you were growing up you had apple trees.
HA: Yep.
ALC: Okay, did they ever, ‘cause I heard that some of the early farmers they’d take those apples
and they’d distilled ‘em made apple cider, and then that would get a little alcohol in it.
HA: [laughs] I don’t know about that, but we made apple cider.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, did you ever make apple cider vinegar?
HA: No.
ALC: Mmm-mmm, any other kind of fruit trees?
HA: We had a few pear trees.
ALC: A few pear trees, mmm-hmmm, and is that something your mom would can?
HA: Yeah.
ALC: And how would you heat the house was that a wood stove or coal, coal stove?
HA: Woodstove.
ALC: Woodstove okay, so who had to chop the wood was it the kids?
HA: On Saturdays and Sundays we’d go out and cut them trees ‘bout like that
ALC: Mmm-hmm, you’re holding your hands about what, three, five inches apart.
[15:00] HA: Yeah, then, uh, haul ‘em in, haul ‘em in. Then they’d get the uncles and all the, you
know people around, come in and have a buzz saw, put the tractor on the buzz saw, saw away the
wood, and then we’d have a big pile of wood for the Winter.
ALC: Oh wow, oh my gosh so it would almost be like a party for getting the wood ready.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: What time of year would you do that?
12
HA: Well we’d do it when we get out of school and it’d be on weekends.
ALC: Okay, so sometime uh in the Spring, just before just like May or June or something like
that?
HA: Yeah, and when Wintertime come then that’s the wood.
ALC: Now did your mother cook or do a lot of bread baking?
HA: She done some, but mostly you know mornings you know, she got up in mornings made
biscuits, yeah.
ALC: Made biscuits. So what would you trade like if you were at the corner store the grocery
store, what would you like, would you get coffee and sugar or what were you purchasing?
HA: Yeah we had a huckster to come around.
ALC: Really?
HA: [laughs]
ALC: And you said you said, hucksters?
HA: Yeah
ALC: Okay tell me about this!
HA: He’d come around, have a truck [unintelligible] he’d have all kind of different stuff. We’d
take eggs up there, swap it for something else to eat.
ALC: So you’d take the eggs and swap ‘em.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Ever butter?
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Swap the butter. What kind of things would you swap it for?
HA: Bread, I think a loaf of bread was about a nickel [laughs].
ALC: About a nickel? And uh, yeah…
HA: Them’s hard times but, you look back at ‘em it wasn’t too bad.
13
ALC: What was, now the great depression hit that was the 1930’s.
HA: We was in that.
ALC: What was that like?
HA: Well somebody come along drop us off some canned foods, canned food and stuff, up on
where we met the corner a mile up on the main drive. And uh, they’d bring us stuff and drop it
off up there at the corner of the road.
ALC:  Why? Cause you needed it?
HA: Yeah, [unintelligible] it’s some sort of relief I don’t know.
ALC: Oh you’d get the relief and they’d drop it off. Kind of like WPA or something like that?
HA: Yeah, WPA worked for it didn’t he.
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
HA: [laughs] But this here they just dropped it off, then if you needed a pair of shoes or need
something down in Pinkstaff there, there was a store, it was a store, this place where if you didn’t
have money, go in there get these shoes.
ALC: Okay, so even if you didn’t have money you could get something.
HA: Mmm-hmm.
ALC: Cause I was hearing, I was talking with some families in Davies [presumed spelling]
County, Indiana, just on the other side of the Wabash there. And they said in the 1930s, just
before, you know, just before the great depression broke out, there were a lot of old farmers that
were African descended. But in the 1930s their farms got foreclosed the banks wouldn’t give
them loans, they couldn’t get the federal loans and they all, most of them lost their farms in the
1930s. How do you think your family held on to their farm?
HA: I don’t know.
ALC: Mmm, cause it sounds like it was hard times.
HA: Yeah they was hard times back then, but you look back well, it was hard times but, they
made it.
ALC: Did your father have family in the area that could sort of rally, and did they support each
other a bit?
HA: No you had tough times, [unintelligible][laughs].
14
ALC: Yeah I hear you.
HA: It was tough times back in them days.
ALC: Now what made you decide you wanted to be a farmer? Cause you saw your dad do it.
HA: Yeah but I, I uh, I went to the Navy.
ALC: Okay, World War II.
HA: Yeah World War II. I was farming with my dad and my brother, then I went to the Navy, my
brother he got a deferment.
ALC: Oh why?
HA: For the farm.
ALC: For the farm!

ALC: Okay.
HA: And then when I come up, then I had to go.
[20:00] ALC: Wow, how’d you feel about that?
HA: Alright, alright.
ALC: Okay.
HA: Then I went and spent time in the Navy, when I come home then the Vietnam War started,
and my brother had to go then!
ALC: Oh my.
HA: So, he had his chance...
ALC: So when you came back you decided you wanted to farm.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Okay, and…

ALC: Okay, and how many acres was that?
HA: About a hundred and seventy-five probably.
ALC: Hundred and seventy-five. Was any of it wooded or was it all cleared?
HA: No we had some of it wooded.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, and is that where you’d go hunting and stuff?
HA: Oh, we hunted on everybody’s then. Everybody [unintelligible] then. We’d start out here
and walk, well we lived down here then. And we’d walk maybe couple miles that way and a
couple miles that way, come in in the afternoon tired and everything.
ALC: Mmm, I have to ask this because I’m really curious because I’m a mom myself. When you
were growing up, were you the eldest or, where were you in the line of the kids?
HA: No, I was the second.
ALC: Second one of the...
HA: Second of the six.
ALC: Second of the six. So that means when your mom had the younger ones, did she have them
at home? Or did she go to the hospital?
HA: We was all born at home I think.
ALC: You were all born at home, did somebody come to help did kin? Who came to help?
HA: Yeah, her mother.
ALC: Her mother would come.

too much to do [laughs]. And uh, and uh, the only job we have is you know they had these
torpedoes on these submarines? On the head, you know on the head of it.

GC: Because you pass.
ALC: Mmm-hmm.
HA: It’s just like when uh, when in service, uh, the colored people had a line, one line and it was
long. The white people had two or three lines, and it was shorter. So it didn’t make no difference

over the color line, I mean it was…
HA: Yeah I can’t do it around here, but I can do it any other. I hear, I hear a lot of talk!
GC: Right.
ALC: Did it affect your ability to farm? I talked to some farmers that said they couldn’t get
loans.
HA: No, no.
ALC: No it didn’t affect you that way, did it ever affect the price you would get on your hogs?

HA: I just liked it.
ALC: You just liked it.
HA:  I just liked it.

HA: We just doing it.
ALC: Okay that was on your dad’s farm, and what about the beans? Would you save some for
seed as well?
HA: Yeah, yeah save some seed, but you couldn’t keep ‘em more than I’d say, two years or one

HA: Mmm-hmm.
ALC: And you were all in the car to grandma’s house because your mom was having a baby.
Wow.
HA: Uh-huh, yeah that’s stuck in my mind.
29
ALC: I bet! Did you ever like to get up to any mischief on the farm?
HA: Oh yeah! [laughter] My grandpa, his dad, my dad’s dad, we’d throw corn cobs at him.
[laughter] [unintelligible] We’d throw corn cobs at him you know. He was standing there and we
was off behind the shed and we’d throw them and then we’d run.  And he caught us one day and
we couldn’t [unintelligible]
ALC: [laughter] Couldn’t do what?
HA: Couldn’t get out of the shed
ALC: Ohhh! You were in, you were stuck in the shed! [laughter]
HA: You can’t say they was real bad days but, they was hard days.
GC: You asked Larry about the wells, and he didn’t quite remember.
JA: Who?
GC: About water wells did you have a well on your farm to get the water from? Where did you
get your water from?
HA: Drove a pipe down in the ground.
GC: Okay, just a pipe?
HA: Uh-huh, picture pipe.
ALC: And so then you’d have a pump.
GC: Uh-huh, wow
HA: Sometimes it’d be dry and sometimes it’d be…
ALC: What would you do when it was dry would you go to the creek or?
HA: Well long time ago there was a, when you go down there and you find a spring, you always
found a stick sticking in the ground, and a cup on top of that stick.
ALC: Okay.
HA: And you got your drink. And now, now you wouldn’t dare to drink that water.
ALC: But you would drink that water.
HA: Yeah.
30
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
HA: Now over here the Goinses [presumed spelling – “Goins” is a very old free-person-of-color
name in the United States, going back to Jamestown] back there, The Goinses back there they
got a spring back there the last time I was back that run just like a rain you know just like big
rain, that water just run down there all Summer long.
ALC: Wow, a really good spring.
HA: Yeah it’s a good spring.
ALC: That was pretty essential for farming, how did the family deal with the dry days? Did you
have to go out and water or what’d you do?
HA: We had little ponds.
ALC: You had little ponds.
[45:00] HA: We had little ponds kept water. It’d go dry when you pump it, and then night it’d
build up again, so.
ALC: And what would you do if there was a frost? How would you deal with a late frost?
HA: Back in them days they wouldn’t, you didn’t plant too much like you did today.
ALC: Mmm how was it different?
HA: You just didn’t plant it, you didn’t get it out early. You didn’t plant till later.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, you waited till a bit later.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: To avoid the frost.
HA: Yeah. [unintelligible] you didn’t have nothing to get in! You already got it in before the
frost.
ALC: Okay.
HA: Course you know when the frost hit the corn stub like that that doesn’t hurt it.
ALC: Okay.
HA: You just get out [unintelligible] frost in the morning and shuck it by hand.
31
ALC: Oh wow, okay okay, so what was it like harvesting the corn?
HA: You got out and got the team of mules, whatever one, and the wagon.
ALC: Did all the kids help with that one?
HA: We’d shuck corn in the mornings before we went to school.
ALC: Wow, wow you’d get up early and do that.
HA: Yeah dad would go down there and put them harness on the horses before daylight and we’d
go down shuck and shuck corn before we went to school.
ALC: How many ears of corn was usually on each, each plant.
HA: Um, a the wagon holds thirty bushel
ALC: Thirty Bushel.
HA: Thirty bushel or fifteen bushel, depends on whether you got the sideboards, sideboards on.
ALC: Sure sure yeah. Did the was the corn planted real close like it is today or little further
apart?
HA: No no no corn planted back in them days about fourteen inches apart, bout fourteen, now
they got ‘em down to six.
ALC: Yeah. What do you think about that? All these changes?
HA: Must be pretty good! But I thought you know about ten, ten or twelve...
ALC: Ten or twelve inches apart, mmm-hmm.
HA: Yeah, well we raised some good corn ten or twelve inches apart. So it seems like now you
plant it that thick and then you got a lot of stalk and stuff after you combine. Course now they
bail it [unintelligible] now.
ALC: Yeah that’s true, that’s true. So when you were raising hogs, you would feed them the corn
you were growing right?
HA: Yep, yep.
ALC: And was it just corn or would you feed them scraps and other things?
HA: There’d be somebody come along and sell something in a barrel and you’d put it and mix it
with water and I guess they call that slop or whatever you want...
32
ALC: Mmm-hmm, mainly it was corn though?
HA: It was made out of something I don’t know what it was.
ALC: Yeah.
HA: Back in the day [unintelligible] but all the time I raised hogs it was corn, go to the elevator
and grind ‘em up some feed and...
GC: Were the melons all grown on the Indiana side did they...
HA: No they grow ‘em along here now.
GC: Okay.
HA: Yeah they got ‘em down here [unintelligible]
JA: Oh you mean back then?
GC: Back then yeah
ALC: Back then…
HA: Oh.
GC: Did you grow…
HA: No
GC: Nobody grew melons.
HA: No yeah there’s a few people who melon thing I had an uncle grew melons. But now, now
they grow ‘em all over here.
GC: Is it the difference in the soil I think do they say it’s sandier over in the Indiana side.
HA: Yeah plant in the sand [unintelligible] put in rice uh not rice I can’t recall the name right
now, one sweet the other…
GC: Sorghum?
ALC: Mmm-mmm no.
HA: It grows lots taller than wheat.
33
GC: Millet?
ALC: Millet or...
JA: Milo? Milo ‘bout the same.
HA: Rye, rye might've been rye.
ALC: Rye?
HA: It grows high, taller than wheat [unintelligible].
ALC: Mmm-hmm so you’ve seen a lot of changes occur, you’ve seen a lot of changes.
HA: Yeah, what’s going to happen the next fifty years?
[50:00] ALC: I don’t know, I don’t know, if I knew that I’d be a lot richer than I am today!
[laughter] Did you ever feel like your identity... and you know I forgot to ask you. I was
supposed to ask you this and I was supposed to ask Jackie this. How would you identify
yourself? Would you identify yourself as a particular race or as a family or how would you
identify yourself?
HA: I’m white where nobody knows me.
ALC: Okay,
HA: I’m colored where I’m known.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, okay.
HA: Yeah like I used to go over there to the sale barn, and I’d get run down [laughs] white
people have a tough time, and you hear ‘em talking about ‘em.
ALC: So locally it was known.
HA: Yeah, locally around here.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, and did it make a difference sometimes, in a bad way?
HA: No round here they’re pretty nice around here.
ALC: Okay.
HA: They’re pretty nice around here. I, I don’t know anybody ‘round here you know that...
ALC: What about the school you went to when you were a kid? Was that...
34
HA: [unintelligible] It was a mixed school
ALC: It was a mixed school?
HA: All the way through.
ALC: Wow.
HA: It was just a mile the way a crow flies, straight across that mile there at the next corner.
ALC: And what was the teacher? Was the teacher white or black?
HA: White.
ALC: White.
HA: There was one of ‘em lived right over here.
ALC: Wow just on the other side of the house you’re just pointing to the right.

ALC: Real or that your ancestors had come here real early and settled here real early.
HA: Oh I don’t know anything ‘bout that. I don’t know anything ‘bout that [laughs].
ALC: Well that’s what I was writing all about but...
HA: Yeah.
ALC: You know I think, I think one of the questions I always wonder I think a lot of people live
in the cities they think farming is real hard, and but what do you think people get wrong about
farming?
HA: It was way back there, but since you got more modern today you go out there sit in air
conditioned tractor
35
ALC: Mmm-hmm
JA: [unintelligible][laughter] GPS guidance.
HA: It just ain’t what it used to be.
ALC: It isn’t what it used to be.
HA: The Air Condition, of course uh, I only had one tractor that had you know just blasting
away, had air condition in it. Rest of him still feel the sun.
ALC: Wow it’s hot, so when you bought your tractors did you get loans for that or just bought
‘em cash?
HA: The last one’s cash.
ALC: Wow.
HA: But dad he bought the others. Be probably ‘bout a month time.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, Jackie was saying sometimes you and your brothers would share ‘em around.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, Mmm-hmm. What was some of your favorite things about farming? Was
there a favorite season or a favorite crop to work or?

HA: You didn’t have to go out and face the cold weather!
ALC: Mmm-hmm! [laughter] So winter was a good season!

ALC: What did you like to do in the Winter when you had a little time?
HA: Well we went to school, we went to school and we cut wood on Saturdays [unintelligible]

36
HA: In Summer sometimes when we didn’t have ‘nothing we’d go down to the creek and jump
in the water!
ALC: Did you know how to swim?
HA: [laughter] in the water I just said in the water.
ALC: Yeah, uh-huh uh-huh.
HA: Course the creeks you know they ain’t very deep you know they just [unintelligible] water
[unintelligible].
ALC: So you just splashed around?
HA: Just splashed around in there.
ALC: When you were owning your own farm, running your own farm, why did you decide on
hogs?
HA: Uh, Jen, Jen in the 4-H, I had to get in [unintelligible]
JA: I got in there.
HA: Yeah was you in there too?
ALC: But when it came time for you to have your own farm it sounds like you did very similar
farming to your father, would that be correct?
[55:00] HA: No, no he my dad divided the ground up between all the kids.
ALC: Okay.
HA: And we farmed you know, we farmed all together and when we harvested we kept it apart.
ALC: Okay! Yep yep.
HA: So now they farm, they farm the whole thing now and they just go by the acres.
ALC: Right.
HA: We got, we got a nice farm here, I mean you know.
ALC: Would you say that your land was good land?
HA: Yeah.
37
ALC: Good growing land?

ALC: Mmm-hmm, your dad yeah.
38
HA: Well I’ll tell ya like it is, that Pinkstaff that sold that ground to him, him and his brother, him
and his brother uh was fussing against each other. The taxes wasn’t being paid.
ALC: Oh!
HA: And, when uh, at the end this Pinkstaff got the ground and dad had to pay the taxes to get
the ground.
ALC: Mmm! So he figured it out, so he bought it for the back taxes.
HA: No dad had to pay had to pay him for the ground, but he had to pay the tax the back tax.
ALC: So not only did he have to pay him for the ground…
HA: That’s right.
ALC: He had to pay for the back taxes  on it as well.
HA: Cause they was fussing over it.
ALC: Oh the Pinkstaff brothers were.

been saving up for it?
HA: Yeah he’d been saving up for it.
ALC: Mm-hmm he must have had his eye on it.
HA: Yeah, he farmed it you know.
ALC: Yeah, yeah.
HA: Generally around here if you farmed the ground if it goes up for sale, you pretty much have
the first chance at it unless you know [unintelligible].
ALC: So you what do you think is going to happen to the land now? Cause it’s been in the family
for a while.
