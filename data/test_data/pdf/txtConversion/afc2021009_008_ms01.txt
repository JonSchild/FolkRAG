Good afternoon and thank you so much for agreeing to take part in this historical project with the
Library of Congress. Will you please give me your complete name and your city and state where you
live?
JS
Thank you for having me to participate in this project. I'm honored. My name is Joseph Edward Stacy,
Senior and the city I live in is Chesapeake. The state is Virginia.
CH
What year were you born?
JS
I was born 
, 1948.
CH
Alright, and where were you born?
JS
I was born in the city of Norfolk.
CH
That's in Virginia?
JS
Norfolk, Virginia. Yes, ma'am.
CH
Tell me something about your family dynamic.
JS
Well, I think I've been [inaudible 0:56] blessed by the Lord because my pop, he was a deacon. He knew
the Lord. My mom knew the Lord. They led me to Christ. Like I said, I started out in a place called
Titustown, that's in Norfolk, and then we moved to Chesapeake. It was the country at that time. There
was a lot of fields and everything. It was the country at that time. As far as family dynamics, you
couldn't hope for, I think, anything better, you know. You know how it is when you're a child, you know,
you look at things, but I always said, you know, mom and pop provided the food in my mouth, a roof
over my head. Everybody else could have been very suspect, so I listen to what they say.
CH
[Laughs] Alright. Do you have any sisters and brothers?
JS
Yes, I do. I have one brother, one older brother. It was the two of us, you know. It was two boys and
came up, and of course, I had my granny, my grandmother. She used to keep the keen switch on the
3
XXXXXXX
boys’ back ‘cause, you know, you had two boys, you know. We were always tough and whatnot, but she
took care of everything, and when mom and pop came home, things were straightened out.
CH
Yeah, grannies used to do that, right? Different day today.
JS
Yes.
CH
Are you married and have children?
JS
Yes, ma'am. I'm married to the lovely Angela Kate [inaudible 2:31] Freeman Stacy. We've been married
now 53 years and we had four children. The Lord blessed us. We, you know, like I said, first of all,
pointing them to Christ and all of them know Christ and [inaudible 2:47] pardoned their sins. So, that's
number one. So, our children they're doing-- Thank the Lord. They listen to us and they're doing very
well. Thank the Lord.
CH
Okay, grandchildren?
JS
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. I have two girls, two grandbaby girls and two grandsons. My oldest grandson,
he's with my son down in the Atlanta area and he'll turn 21 in April. Thank the Lord. He’ll turn 21. My
youngest son, Benjamin, his two children, they are still pretty young. Sabrina-- I joke with my wife
sometimes. I say we run the free before and after school daycare. She drops ‘em off in the morning and I
get Jenny on the bus. TJ, he walks. He's in middle school, so he walks down the street to school. But we
get ‘em on the bus, and then in the evening one of them will, either her or her husband, pick ‘em up.
CH
That's wonderful. That's wonderful that you're available that way.
JS
Oh, yes, yes.
CH
Keeping the family tribe together.
JS
Yes, indeed.
CH
Yeah, that is very important. What inspired you or who inspired you to become a nurse?
4
XXXXXXX
JS
First of all, it was my mother. My mother was a practical nurse back in the day. She was born in 1906
and, you know, during those times, you know, she went to [inaudible 4:31] to a practical nursing
program and she was a practical nurse. I always came up knowing what nurses did. Now my dad, Pop,
he was a electrician helper down at the base, and I’d oft’ time go with him on jobs. Electrician, I knew
that wasn't my thing. But I always loved helping people and I saw what she did. It's really interesting
because, you know, I saw nurses and then there was a program on the TV back in the day when, you
know, you had black and white TV. It was called The Nurses, and on one of those shows, they had a man
nurse and that was the first time I'd seen men in nursing. I knew that men could be nurses and what they
do because I liked nursing. So, she's one of the key factors in my life for as far as going into the nursing
profession and everything.
CH
Where did you go to school for nursing?
JS 05:34
My first years in nursing school was at-- and I always tell people, I thank the Lord for Norfolk State
College. At that time-- Norfolk State University. At that time, it was the Norfolk division of Virginia
State College. They used to call it Little State. But I always say they gave a little Black boy from
Crestwood the opportunity to be a professional registered nurse, and I thank them, because at that time,
people that look like us, come from where we come from, were not-- especially males, [inaudible 6:11],
you know, they didn't want to see us. So, Norfolk State. I went there and got an associate degree from
Norfolk State. Subsequently, of course, right at that time, Vietnam was hotter than a pepper sprout, so
people were getting drafted and goin’ in the military. So, at that time, I raised my right hand for the
Navy. However, to be a nurse in the Navy, you had to have a bachelor's degree, so I came into the
Hospital Corps. But here again, it was a blessing from the Lord, because sometimes things look like
they're bad in one way but they're good in another. So, I got picked up later on. I got picked up for the
Navy Enlisted Nursing Education Program and the Navy sent me back to school for my Bachelor's in
Nursing at the-- it's now the University of Louisiana at Monroe, but at that time, it was Northeast
Louisiana University in Monroe, Louisiana. I got my Bachelor's in Nursing there and then, subsequently,
I was able to-- and I say that's a blessing too. I was able to use the GI Bill to pay for my master's degree,
and that was a blessing.
CH
And your master's is in?
JS
My master's is in human resource management. At the time, I wanted to get a different degree. So, I
didn't know how, coming out of the military, you know, what type of employment I'd be able to get too. I
knew I would be able to get something in nursing but I wanted that management degree, so that's why I
went for that degree.
CH
What positions have you had as a nurse?
5
XXXXXXX
JS
When I went in the Navy-- I say the Navy is really good because they kind of throw you into the fire.
They give you-- Before you get your specialty, you have to wear out-- I've worked the OR. I worked
neurosurgery, orthopedics. I worked med surg. I worked psychiatric nursing. But my subspecialty code
and my love was neonatal intensive care. So, I worked with the babies, and even there, I remember times
I would be praying that I can feel that [inaudible 8:29] over my head and praying to get a scout vein
needle in there, because some of ‘em you could hold the babies almost-- you could hold ‘em in your
hand. So, but I love neonatal intensive care nursing. I love my babies. I love my mamas.
CH
So, you did that type of nursing while you were in the Navy?
JS
Yes, ma'am.
CH
Did you work as a nurse outside of the military?
JS
Well, I worked at Norfolk Community Hospital for a little while and then after I came out of the Navy, I
worked at-- it was a clinic. It was more of a-- It was a clinic, so it was more ambulatory care type
nursing after I came out the Navy and everything.
CH
How were you received as a male nurse?
JS 09:16
Yeah, that's interesting, and I like to say, while I'm speaking on this thing, anybody that wants to go into
nursing or any other field, don't let anybody’s stereotype hold you back. This is really interesting,
because when I initially graduated from high school, I applied to Norfolk State. You had to have your
interview, okay. So, I went for my interview and the head of department, she interviewed me, okay, and
of course, you had to have, you know, you had to get references or whatnot, okay, and on one reference
it said that the person was surprised. I knew who the person was because it was my high school
geometry teacher. Now, I did really well in geometry so that wasn't the problem, but she said she was
surprised. The reason why surprised, she asked me, “Why did I-- Why did I--” She said that she was
surprised. I told her at that time, I told her, I said, “Well, I really don't know.” But I had understood why
she was surprised, and that was because we have stereotypes a lot of times hidden in us, and a stereotype
of men as not being nurses. I was the alpha male, so it was like, you know, it was that stereotype that
popped up. So, don't let stereotypes hold you back or anything like that. But that was quite revealing to
me coming in nursing. Now, when I went at Norfolk State, that's why I appreciate Norfolk State. I was
involved just with the rest of the nurses and we worked, you know, you gotta work hard, and I wanted to
be a nurse down in my gut. Some people asked, “Did you wanna be--" They would ask me, did I wanna
be something like a nurse’s [inaudible 11:21] or whatnot. When I went into nursing, I wanted to be a
nurse. I knew what nurses did.
6
XXXXXXX
CH
Does that mean you wanted to work at the bedside?
JS
I wanted to be a bedside nurse, ‘cause that Norfolk State nursing program was a bedside nursing
program. I wanted to be a bedpan totin’ [inaudible 11:39] nurse, ‘cause I knew what nurses did. I had no
illusions and that's what I wanted to be when I went in there. I wanted to be a nurse.
CH
You mentioned stereotype. What stereotype are you talking about as far as males being in nursing?
JS
Well, that one I mentioned was-- You know, sometimes people are programmed that, you know, they
start to believe about different roles that you have, you know, that, you know. Some people were
stereotypic back in that day. This is back in the 60s so, you know, things a little, you know, different
nowadays, but a lot of stereotypes have been broken but, you know, that women are nurses, you know,
because usually they tell the girls, “Oh, you ought to be a nurse,” but lot of time, they don’t say that to
the boys. Or just like they showed a lot of women doing truck driving and things like that, auto
mechanic stuff, but they don't say that to the girls, but a lot of women are hands-on and good for that
thing so, you know. So, don’t let people box you into any-- that's what I'm saying, box you into any type
of a stereotype. But they had a stereotype and, you know, different roles that, “You do this. You do that.
Women are not doctors”, this type of thing.
CH
In your role as a nurse, did you see that there were different roles for you as opposed to the female
nurses? Were you expected to do certain tasks more than the female nurse?
JS
From time to time you could see that coming out, but, like, I would do what I wanna do. That's one
reason, like I said, I loved the neonatal intensive care, but I had to do other things to get to that and
whatnot. That's one thing good about the Navy, though. Like I said, the Navy exposed you and they will
put you into that role. I don't know about the, you know, outside, but maybe there was a blessing I was
in, like, say, the Navy, but they did expose me to those different roles and everything.
CH
How long did you work in neonatal intensive care?
JS 14:03
I’d say several years. I was in the Navy a total of 23 and a half years. I worked in that for several years
because I was a charge-- In fact, I like to tell this because it’s a wonderful story. I was the charge nurse
of the newborn nursery and the neonatal nursery in Cherry Point, North Carolina, and I had the
privilege-- My wife got pregnant with my baby girl, Sabrina, and so I had the privilege-- because when
you’re a neonatal nurse, when they have a C-section, you have to go down, you know, receive the baby,
take the baby back and, you know, do the things you have to do and everything, and I was blessed
because her C-section, I was down. I always joke her, number one, I tell her that I saw her innards and I
did, because they, you know, when they cut, you see the old sutures that were left in there from before
7
XXXXXXX
and everything. That wasn’t her first section, so you see those sutures and stuff and I always joke about
that. But I always tell her I bonded with Brina before she did. I did. I took my baby girl back, gave her
her eye drops, her first vitamin K shots, weighed her in and everything, and that was a distinct pleasure
of my life right there.
CH
What a wonderful blessing.
JS
Yes it was. Yes it was.
CH
Nurses are often afforded those special moments in the circle of life.
JS
Yes.
CH
From the beginning.
JS
Yes.
CH
Well, from before the beginning and all the way to the transitioning from this life and to the other, and
that really is just such a wonderful blessing, actually.
JS
It is.
CH
To be able to have those experiences.
JS
Yes.
CH
When you got out of the military, you worked in ambulatory care, you said?
JS
Yes, yes. I worked--
CH
How many years did you do that?
8
XXXXXXX
JS
I did that for three or four years or so.
CH
What was that experience like?
JS
That was a good experience, because in the Navy too I had experience in some ambulatory care work,
some clinics or whatnot, some medical clinic, so that was an excellent experience, and it was with the
TRICARE, so it was, like, it wasn't military but military was, you know. We saw a lot of military
dependents and whatnot.
CH
Along with TRICARE. That is an insurance?
JS
Insurance, yeah, yeah.
CH
And you worked in a clinic.
JS
I worked in a clinic.
CH
That took that particular insurance.
JS
Yeah.
CH
Your out-of-military experience, was the clinic a urban clinic, a inner city clinic or what type of clinic
was it?
JS
I will say it was more out, because it was like-- this clinic was in Virginia Beach, setting was in Virginia
Beach.
CH
Was it, like, in a tourist area?
JS
Well, I was saying it was an area that mainly was single family dwellings, maybe apartments and, like I
said, it was urban, you know. It wasn't urban. It wasn't in the city.
9
XXXXXXX
CH
Did you experience any prejudice when you were going through your nurse training or while you were
practicing as a nurse in the Navy?
JS 17:56
Well, I’d say not as much. I’d say a lot of the Fraters-- One was a really interesting situation, and that
was when I started in nursing. I’d like to go back a little bit. I told you when we went down to
Louisiana, when the Navy sent me back for my bachelor’s, when we went down there we had a problem.
The school and education was excellent and they treated me great at the school and everything, but on
the outside, we had a problem getting housing. It was the housing situation, because the lady that let us
in the apartment-- We went in. We were the first Black couple that went into-- We had Joe Jr. with us.
He was a little baby at that time. We were, in fact, the first Black couple getting in this apartment
complex and she had to ask-- The guy was out of town. Her manager was upstairs and she had to ask
him. She was apartment manager but she had to ask the owner of the apartment complex because, a little
further down, they had a Black couple that moved into an apartment. They bombed the apartment
complex. This was in Louisiana in the early 70s, 60, early 70s. So, they had bombed the apartment
complex, and then we had a wonderful experience that while she was in the apartment, some church folk
came. They had to welcome the new people. As soon as they saw us, they started backing away and
said, “They got churches for y'all.” So, and then she says she was out with the baby outside the
apartment. Somebody drove by then backed up and looked at her real strange ‘cause, you know, like I
said, we were the only Blacks in that apartment complex and whatnot. And even it was really interesting
too to hear you talking about, you know, possible discrimination. Here again, when I got stationed--
when I got my commission, after I finished that I went to Newport, Rhode Island. When I went to this
training program, got my commission and everything, came down here to Portsmouth, it was really
interesting because, I mean, on the wards and everything it was fine, but even to get housing down here
at that time-- All my peers, they were [inaudible 20:22] in the Navy, they were naval officers, they had
no problem getting housing. Me and the wife had a problem. Finally we bought a house in [inaudible
20:32] out there, but we finally been able to buy a house, but we had problem getting housing even in
this area at that time. So, I would say the Navy environment was pretty good. You know, there were
some-- some folks didn't like-- once you put on an officer-- I noticed when I was enlisted it was, you
know, hunky-dory, but once you put on the officer’s [inaudible 20:57] and started telling some people
what to do, you know, you can see that they don't like that. You know what I’m trying to say. At that
time, they didn't particularly like that, but they had to do what they had to do.
CH
No instances of prejudice or differential treatment while you were performing your duties as a nurse in
the military?
JS
I would say not really. Like I said, that housing thing. There's some things went on can’t tell you about
but other than-- A lot of times, I can tell you about this, like when they evaluate you and whatnot, they
would act-- it was almost like they would act surprised, and they wouldn't want to put on there that you
showed excellent leadership skills and whatnot. So, you know, they didn't want to put on your
evaluation, like-- You could tell the white person, they say, outstanding leadership skills and
performance and whatnot. They act surprised when a Black person had great leadership skills and things
like that. So, that did arise, showed itself a little bit.
10
XXXXXXX
CH
As a male nurse, how did your patients receive you? In particular, female patients.
JS
Now this is the deal. Really well.
CH
Wonderful.
JS
Because I liked-- I said I worked neonatal. I worked OB. I worked Labor and Delivery. I really didn't
find a problem there, unless I was overlooking, but I didn't find one.
CH
That's wonderful.
JS
Yes.
CH
You had a wonderful nursing career.
JS
Yes, ma'am.
CH
That you have been accepted as a male nurse without a lot of prejudice, either in your clientele or with
your peers. That's really great to hear. And wonderful for--
JS
And I don't know whether-- When you're saying that, I don't know. It could have been because it was the
military, because by the military, you know, like say you go by rank and you have to do what you gotta
[Inaudible 23:23], it's a little bit different than in the civilian sector.
CH
Most of your nursing experience was in the military and first you were enlisted and then you became an
officer?
JS
Yes, ma'am.
CH
That was after you got your bachelor's degree.
JS
That was after I got my bachelor's degree. I got my commission.
11
XXXXXXX
CH
Your bachelor's degree was in nursing?
JS
Bachelor’s degree was in nursing. Yes, ma'am.
CH
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Now, we gotta talk about Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated.
JS
[Claps]
CH
[Laughs] How long have you been a member?
JS 23:56
I became a member on March 9th, 2013.
CH
Okay.
JS
And I tell you, we just put away my big sister Thursday, Miss Louie Burrell. She brought me in. And
here again too, I think it was military. I never heard of Chi Eta Phi Sorority and I tell people this too.
When I was coming through, even when in college, in undergrad and grad school, I looked at-- And
please don't misunderstand me. I'm not downing any fraternities or sororities or anything like that. I'm
not saying anything negative about ‘em or anything, but when I was coming through, a lot of fraternities,
they were about drinking and womanizing and that was not what I was about, but the values and
everything of Chi Eta Phi-- I never saw a sorority that had the values I wanted ‘til she introduced me to
Chi Eta Phi, and I wish that I would have found Chi Eta Phi earlier in my nursing career. I could
probably have done more or been more help to the chapter or whatnot. But, I love Chi Eta Phi.
CH
What chapter are you in?
JS
Eta chapter.
CH
Eta chapter. And you are in which region?
JS
Northeast region.
CH
The mighty northeast region!
12
XXXXXXX
JS
[Claps]
CH
Alright! Have you held any offices?
JS
Well, the office I was just appointed to this March was the Office of the Chaplain.
CH
Okay. Any other positions?
JS
Well, on committees, I'm on the Auditing Committee. I'm on the Second Welfare Committee. That's the
committees I’m on right now.
CH
Have you done anything on the regional or the national level?
JS
Not so far. Not so far. And that's the thing, like--
CH
Do you have any aspirations?
JS
Well, like I said, I wish I’d of find Chi Eta Phi earlier. Would have gave me more emphasis to, you
know, go further.
CH
The projects that the sorority are involved in, are you involved with any of the projects that your chapter
has?
JS
Yes, we’re involved with the chapter projects and everything.
CH
What projects have you been a part of?
JS
I’d have to check my [laughs]-- the minutes and whatnot. I know we did a thing not too long ago for St.
Jude. We had a project for St. Jude. We have a project that we work on with-- Like I said, I have to
check those notes. We've partnered with I think it’s Kids and Kin. It’s a project that she works with the
grandparents that-- and we've been with them on several-- the grandparents are parenting, because a lot
of times the grandparents parent children now because of, you know, drug-related, something happens to
13
XXXXXXX
the parent. We work with that organization. That's one of the projects that we're working on. I'm trying
to think the other projects. I'd have to-- I'm sorry. My mind is-- I'd have to look at my notes.
CH
Do you participate with any of the blood pressure screening?
JS
Oh, yes we do. Definitely. We've gone to different churches and organizations and done blood pressure
screenings and all of that, and I work with the Chesapeake Medical Reserve Corps too. I volunteer with
them. I've done a lot of volunteer work with the Medical Reserve Corps. Some of the Sorors have gone
with me. We've done, you know, blood pressure checks and everything like that. In fact, we used to be
with that partner. They do that senior sheriffs-- senior seminar in Chesapeake they used to do down at
the Chesapeake Conference Center. Because of COVID, a lot of things was stopped, but we'd be there
helping with the blood pressure, do the MRC, and a couple of our Beta chapter members, we'd be there
with that.
CH
Okay. Do you all provide health education when you go out to do those screenings?
JS
Yes, we do. Yes, we do. We've got information sheets we give out plus they have education and whatnot
then. Yes, ma'am.
CH
What would you like to see the sorority doing that might not be doing right now?
JS 28:58
Nothing I can think of, because there's so much to do especially with COVID, with the, you know,
vaccinations, like I said, doing the MRC and whatnot, but what we’re do with the, you know, helping us
through this COVID and everything. That's the other thing too I think about. We had a Kidney Day at
the different churches, ‘cause [inaudible 29:21] to my church, and we've been going to the different
churches or whatnot and educating about that and the blood pressure checks and that, the Kidney Day
Sunday and whatnot. But like I said, a lot of that was halted due to COVID.
CH
Did you all have a Kidney Sunday program this year?
JS
I think we've got one coming up, yes, ‘cause they talked about that in a meeting. We got one coming up.
CH
Will you be participating with it?
JS
I'm sure I probably will if they need some participants. I know I’ll be more than willing to. Yeah,
whatever they need. Yeah.
14
XXXXXXX
CH
Are you currently retired from nursing?
JS
Yes, ma'am.
CH
How long have you been retired?
JS
Well, I retired from the Navy in ‘92 but, like I said, it was about four years after that I was still, you
know, working in a nursing capacity a bit after that. So, I know by the time I turned 62, I know I was--
‘cause I had filed for Social Security and everything. Yes.
CH
So, you're pretty much done with being an active nurse as far as having a nine-to-five job?
JS
Oh definitely, definitely, and I will, like I said, I volunteer. I [inaudible 30:39] volunteer with the
Chesapeake Medical Reserve Corps.
CH
What do you do with the Chesapeake Reserve Corps?
JS
Well, we’re a volunteer organization. We help out, like, as far as immunizations. I help out the health
department. Our base is out of the Chesapeake Health Department, so whatever they need. We'd go out
to schools and give the, you know, the usual immunizations things and so, yes.
CH
Since we've been going through COVID-19, with your involvement with the Reserve Medical Corps,
how has that changed what you all have been doing?
JS
Well, it’s limited a lot of the function, but here again, the other function picked up because we were
doing the vaccinations, started picking up when they had the vaccination, and they were doing the
testing, the testing, the vaccination, all that through the Chesapeake Medical Reserve Corps, Chesapeake
Health Department, everything. So, those things really, you know, whatever need they had, that's what
those Chesapeake Medical Reserve Corps be doing.
CH
Did you find the community as a whole was really involved with getting those COVID vaccines?
JS
I think pretty much. I mean, you know, there's a lot of hype on TV and things but, you know, as best we
could we, you know. Like church says: Come as you are. So it was, you know, whosoever will.
15
XXXXXXX
CH
Do you feel that Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated makes a difference in service for humanity?
JS
I think Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated makes a big difference in service for humanity.
CH
In what way?
JS
We are out there in the community, and not just the Eta chapter but all the chapters. I look at [inaudible
32:50] and see what they're doing and all the chapters and work through the [inaudible 32:54]. Even on
Zoom. I mean, we got the Zoom thing. We had a Zoom call the other day talking about sickle cell with
one of the chapters, with one of the other organizations and whatnot. So, like I said, we've evolved.
We've been flexible to go to Zoom and educating in the community and everything, and we’re part of
the community.
CH
Absolutely. What words of wisdom would you leave for, in particular, a male who is interested in
becoming a nurse?
JS
It’s a wonderful career. If you enjoy helping people, this is it. This is it if you enjoy helping people, want
to use your skills or whatnot. And like I say, don't believe the hype, don't believe the stereotypes, and
don't let people put you in a box, ‘cause if you see it, you like it, do it.
CH
What words of wisdom do you have for our Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated and service for humanity?
JS
Keep on truckin’. Keep on doing what we're doing. Keep on loving each other. Keep on fighting out
there for service for humanity.
