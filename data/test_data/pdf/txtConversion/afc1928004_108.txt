GOOSE AND INGUNS. 
Oh, dear, rm nearly starving, 
I 
want something nice to eat 
I 
fancy myself carving, 
Big pies and joints of meat. 
Roast pork or leg of mutton, 
To me would be of use ; 
And though I'm not a 
glutton, 
Still, rd polish off a 
goose! 
OHOLUS. 
For it Is my opinion, 
That stuffed with sage and ingun, 
No bird that flies is half so nice, 
As a 
Goose with sage and ing,un. 
I'm very fond of Turkey, 
Spring Chicken is good to take; 
Of Partridge or of Pheasant, 
A dinner I 
could make. 
I 
like corned beef and mustard, 
Or sirloin steak with juice, 
Or Prairie hen or Bustard fat, 
But most I 
love a 
Goose! 
For it is my opinion, &we. 
I've liver tried and bacon, 
And tripe both boiled and fried; 
A sheep s.head I 
have taken, 
And put myself outside. 
Though turtle soup is filling, 
And fish- balls joy produce; 
'Tis not the rapture or the joy, 
4, 
That appertains to Goose! 
For it is my opinion, ttc. . 
THE ROVIN' 
IRISH BOY. 
Words by Wm. CARLETON. 
Music by C. J. MIER& 
(The music of this slug is published by Ono SUTRO, 189 West Balti-
more 6treet, Bait., Md. 
Price 5d cents.) 
I'm a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened Anchna-cloy 
With a 
turn o' the wrist 
My stick I 
twist, 
I 
am my mother's joy ; 
I've thravelled many 
mile, 
To win a 
coleen's smile 
With a 
love o' my heart, for them I'd part, 
And many an hour beguile. 
But now I'm here to tell you all, 
The places I 
have been, 
And all the very fonny things 
in my thravels I 
have soot. 
cuones. 
For I'ma rovin' Irish Boy, 
1 
was christened A 
uckna-cloy, 
With a 
turn o' the wrist 
Stiek I 
Mist, 
And Ptu my mother's joy.—[Dance Garryowen.] 
I've been to " La Belle France," 
Where the girls know how to dance; 
If I 
left the bogs 
Yet I 
couldn't nit frogs, 
Tho' rye t&en bad a 
chance ; 
Dond think that I 
am green, 
For in Germany I 
ve been, 
Where sausages strong, 
And pretzels long, a 
yai 41 or more I've Seen. 
Tileti into Itoussia I 
have rushed, 
The land of furs and capes. 
The pie!' all make the women work, 
Awl the soldiers look like apes. 
For Pm a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
1 
was christened A 
lick na-cloy. 
With a 
turn 0' my wrist, 
My stick I 
twist. 
And I 
am my mother's joy. 
To China thin I 
wint 
And got my hearts contiut 
Of the briny say, 
And wretch-cu bail lay 
Enough to make ine squint ; 
Japan then came in view, 
Be my StIVil I saw that too. 
lint yellow Jack 1101 broke my back, 
That's why I 
look so blue. 
Then sailin' ,.. tars and stripes 
I 
reached Colun•bia's shore. 
And now I 
hive the idtlee so 
I'll never leave it more. 
Except the cry will be, 
" 
Come Paddy, join with me • 
And brave once more. 
The Atlantic's roar. 
And make culd Ireland free."

SEVENTY-TWO.--{CoiccurDED.1 
In the red brick'd hall, with moss covered wall, 
Where my father he lived and died, 
I 
live at my ease, and do as I 
please. 
Caring nought for the world so wide— 
The pluck of a 
lion, a 
muscle of iron, 
And a 
heart teat is honest and true, 
Yet a 
heart that can always for others feel 
Altho' I'm Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &a. 
No sluggard am I, in my bed to lie, 
I 
ri,e at early dawn. 
Thro' meadows I 
jog, with my gun and my dog, 
Or mount at the sound of the horn. 
A seat in the saddle I 
still can keep, 
With a 
heigh, Tally ho, halloo! 
For my limbs are strong, and my wind is long, 
Altho' I 
am Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &o. 
At Christmas time, -when the bells they chime, 
I've a 
welcome as well as a 
smile, 
And hearty good cheer for peasant or peer, 
In a 
jolly old English style. 
I'm fond of good sport, yet, nevertheless, 
My passions I 
always subdue, 
For it's only a 
fool that loves excess, 
And will never reach Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, 414.44. dra. 
YES OR NO. 
A 
smile now gathers round thy lip, 
But not a 
word or sigh 
Escapes to tell if I'm beloved, 
Or bid sad doubts to fly. 
I 
sue to thee, no crimson cheek, 
Reveals love's burning glow, 
Have pity on my throbbing heart. 
Say Yes, my love, or No.

NAUGHTY MARY ANIV,----[CoNcLuDED. 
Describe her beauty ? no, I 
can't, 
And so I 
don't intend; 
The darling lived at a 
bonnet-shop, 
In a 
street at the West-end; 
I've stood so long in front of it, 
Her form to gaze upon, 
That once or twice a " bobby's " come, 
And told me to move on. 
Naughty Mary Ann, &c. 
She used to work there all the day, 
And then go home at night; 
I 
used to 'scort her to the door, 
Which I 
thought such delight; 
I've told her how I 
loved her more 
Than a 
miser loved his gold; 
And I've waited for her in the rain, 
And caught a 
dreadful cold. 
Naughty Mary Ann, &c. 
With her dad I 
used to smoke my pipe, 
And I'd drink tea with her mother; 
'Twas settled in a 
month we should 
Belong to one another: 
So I 
bought the ring, and, full of joy, 
To see her went one day, 
When they said a 
soldier'd been and gone, 
And taken her away. 
Naughty Mary Ann, &c. 
She'd known this soldier chap some time, 
Though she'd vowed to be my wife; 
I 
hopes if ever he goes to the wars, 
They'll frighten him out of his life: 
For he and she have ruined me; 
I'm a 
poor unhappy man; 
Bad luck to all false females, and 
Bad luck to Mary Ann. 
Naughty Mary Ann, &c.

When the ship got sight of Loew's bridge, 
An angry storm arose ; 
At first the wind it got to words, 
And then it got to blows, 
Poor William Jones felt rather queer ; 
(Ile looked as tho' in pain, ) 
He thought at the land where he was born, 
Also of Susan Jane.

WILL JONES AND SUSAN JANE.—[CONCLUDED.] 
The gallant Captain rush'd on deck 
With frenzy in one eye 
Cried lie—" stand by the main jib- boom! 
My brave bold crew----tand hy 
The noble crew stood by some time, 
'Twas useless--- it was vain, 
The storm rag'd wi d-- poor William dropp'd 
A 
tear to Susan Jane. 
---Fare ye well my Susan dear, 
J. may nev, r ee you mf.re; 
Oh I 
my heart's in a 
commotion, 
I'm agoing across the ocean, 
Where the winds and waters roar. 
Will rush'd below unto his trunk, 
And opened wide the lid---
Then kiss'd his Susan's portrait twice, 
He kiss'd it twice, he did 
The Captain hailed a 
ferry- boat 
For as istance---all in vain; 
For the ship went down with crew and Will, 
Who loy'd fair Susan Jane. 
Gurgling ---Fare ye well, drA„ 
When the the news was broke to Susan, 
How her William had been drown'd, 
She i
,rok,; 4,ut all over in fainting fits, 
Her anguish knew no bound, 
Said she---" with sorrow I'll go madl 
Or else I'll go insane 
For I 
did so love my William, and 
He lov'd his Susan Jane." 
And on parting he said: 
Fare ye well, ete. 
One night as Susan sat in grief, 
For the loss of her Will Jo: es, 
There came a

Cried she -‘. ; holt voice! that tone!" 
it was het Will, he was not eked, 
But had come hack again, 
And he violently threw his; arms round, 
The neck of Susan Jane.

For I'll never leave you more. 
My heart's in a

I 
never played at billiards before the other night, 
When first I 
took the cue up I 
was in an awful fright; 
My friend he gave me twenty points, I 
tried to make a " three," 
My cue it slipped, I 
cut the cloth, which was not so bad for me. 
Spoken—No, 'pon my honor 1 
considering I 
had only one " quid" 
to pay, And considering also, it was my first game at billiards, I 
really and truly do think it was—Cuoaus, as before. 
Not long ago, when at a 
dance, I 
asked a 
friend of mine, 
If she would kindly give to me with her valse number nine; 
She did, and as we swam along I 
twisted my right knee-
-We both of us fell on the floor, which was not so bad for me. 
Spoken—No, '
pon my honor! considering I 
was not the only 
one to fall, I 
really and truly do think it was—Cuonns, as before. 
After knocking 'bout the world I 
wished to settle down, 
And so I 
set my cap, sirs, at an heiress, called Miss Browne; 
We married, and I 
think we are as happy as can be,— 
I 
got a 
wife, three " thou." a 
year, which was not so bad for me. 
Spoken—No, '

considering the state of my 
finances at the time we married, I 
really and truly do think it 
was—Cnonus, as before. 
I 
now will bid you all good-night, and please don't cry " encore," 
Unless you wish that I 
should think you all an awful bore : 
Yet still I 
hope you all, my friends, on one point do agree,— 
That the song which I've just sung to you is not so bad for me. 
Spoken—No, '

every time I 
sing this song, I 
always think it is--Ciwaus, as before.

MISS jINICS' SUNDAY OUT. 
Air:—" Captain Jinks. 
I'm Jenny Jinks, the kitchen maid, 
Of hard work not at all afraid, 
Nor yet particular to a 
shade, 
But I 
must go out on Sundays. 
Six days I 
work with all my might 
And keep the pots and kettles bright, 
And put the cobwebs out of sight:— 
But I 
must go out on Sundays. 
CHORUS. 
I'm Jenny Jinks, the kitchen maid, 
Of bard work not at all afraid, 
Nor yet pirticu'ar to a 
shade, 
But I 
must go out on Sunday. 
When I 
first went to take a 
place, 
The lady looked me in the face, 
And said, 
Young girl, now state your case, 
And what about your Sundays ?" 
"Ma'am, I 
can bake it is quite true, 
And I 
can cook an Irish stew, 
And wash a 
shirt, and iron it too, 
But I 
must go out on Sunday !" 
I'm Jenny Jinks, &c. 
"Indeed! why, then 'tis plain," said she, 
"That you will never do for me !" 
From her I 
then did take my leave, 
Resolved to have my Sundays. 
A dozen places more I 
tried, 
Throughout great New York city wide, 
But everywhere the ladies cried, 
We don't give outs' on Sunday!" 
I'm Jenny Jinks, &c. 
At last to bring the fates to book, 
Some counsel with myself I 
took, 
And got a 
place with Doctor Hook, 
Who never mentioned Sundays, 
But when came round of days the best, 
In pink and green myself I 
dressed, 
And sailed off gaily to the West, 
Like other girls on Sunday. 
I'm Jenny Jinks, &c. 
MISS JIMIS SUNDAY OUT. [CoNcLuDED.] 
With Corporal Tomkins of the " Blues," 
So handsome—six foot in his shoes— 
I 
spent the day, did what I 
choose, 
And planned for future Sundays. 
But, fancy! when I 
homeward sped, 
The family were all in bed, 
Save one, who through the keyhole said, 
"That's going out on Sundays." 
I'm Jenny Jinks, &c. 
Now, wasn't this a 
pretty plight ? 
No friends at hand, locked out all night, 
And told it only serve .I me right, 
For going out on Sundays! 
But worse, because I 
kicked the door, 
" 
Police !" was called, there came up four, 
Who took me to—I'll say no more, 
But it wasn't a 
place for Sundays. 
I'm Jenny Jinks, &a. 
So here I 
am again you see, 
A 
girl of famous industry, 
And one who loves her liberty, 
But most of all on Sundays! 
Who wants a 
servant! Sir, do you! 
I'll cook, clean, bake, wait, scrub, for you; 
Darn, stitch, wash, starch and iron, too— 
But I 
must go out on Sundays. 
I'm Jenny Jinks, &o. 
One word before you answer, pray— 
This much about myself I 
say, 
To reconcile you to my way 
Of going out on Sundays: 
I'll not waste aught that's worth a 
pin, 
Nor ever let a 
Policeman in, 
To pick your hones or drink your gin, 
But I ,4ust go out on Sundays, 
I'm Jenny Jinks, &c.

I 
borrow from all who will lend, 
And none can resist me, they say; 
I'm kept in cigars by a 
friend, 
With orders I 
go to the play; 
For dinners my purse is not task'd 
Though many choice spreads do I 
see; 
Some people would wait to be ask'd,

ITIMING HARD AGAINST THE STREAM 
[CONCL1JDED.] 
Many a 
bright, good-hearted fellow,' 
Many a 
noble-minded man, 
Finds himself in water shallow; 
Then, assist him, if you can. 
Some succeed at every turning, 
Fortune favors every scheme, 
Others, too—tho' more deserving, 
Have to pull against the stream. 
So then, do your best, cto. 
If the wind is in yanr favor, 
And you've -weathered every squallL. 
Think of those who luckless labor, 
Never get fair winds at all: -• 
Working hard, contented, willing, 
Struggling thro' life's ocean wide; 
Not a 
friend, and not a 
shilling, 
Pulling hard against the tide. • 
So then, do your best, &a 
Don't give way to foolish sorrow, 
Let this keep you in good cheer ; 
Brighter days may come to-morrow, 
If you try and. persevere; 
Darkest nights will have a 
morning, 
Tho' the sky be overcast; 
Lonc-Pqt lanes must hnve a 
turning, 
And the tide will turn at last. 
So then, do your best,

I've made love to all the nice girls in our street, 
Jemima so charming, and Susan so sweet, 
But they turn up their noses, and all of 'em treat 
Me, somehow, remarkably cool; 
-When I 
speak to Miss Jenny she always looks black, 
While Jane often gives me an unpleasant whack, 
And Mary Ann chalks a 
large D 
on my back, 
While Caroline calls me a 
fool. 
Spoken—Never mind, it takes a 
clever man to be a 
fool; my 
pa was a 
clever man, and ma says I'm just like him, so here's a 
chance for the ladies—Cuoaus, as before. 
When Christmas comes round, oh, that's the go— 
Then I 
kiss the girls under the mistletoe; 
I 
last time fell in love with a 
dozen or so, 
And told them I 
wanted a 
wife: 
I 
asked one fair creature if she'd fly away 
With me, and be married the very next day,— 
She told her papa, and, I'm sorry to say, 
He near frightened me out of my life. 
Spoken—The enraged old buffer threatened to throw rne out of 
the window, and her brother had the audacity to pull my nose I 
and, to add insult to injury, he called me a 
nincompoop; but I 
don't care—Cuoaus, as before. 
If any young woman should want a 
young man, 
Oh, please send her to me as fast as you can,— 
If she thinks I'll suit her I'll put up the banns 
So that we can be married off soon; 
She shall have all my money, go on a 
tour, 
We'll go to the church in a 
carriage and four, 
She shall do as she pleases—I 
cannot say more— 
How I 
long for the sweet honeymoon 
Spoken—Yes, and after we're married, if she don't like me she 
can go home to her mother again; I 
can't say fairer than that, 
can I 
I 
so—Cnottus, as before:

THE IDOL OF THE D AY.—[CONCLUDED.] 
Now " After Dark" I 
like to roam, 
And have a " Loving Cup," 
Or at the hunt, I'm quite " at home," 
And with the master sup. 
I'm sweet on " Rural Felicity," 
Can course, when I've the chance; 
And as to give a " Blow for Blow," 
Why, I'm par excellence. 
Spoken—Yes, every fellow ought to stand up in defence of the 
'fair sex from a 
Peeress to a ' Lancashire Lass," even though she 
be a " Woman of the World," or a " Girl of the Period."—Cnonus, 
as before. 
At Cambridge I 
gain'd a B 
A;' 
Was never reckon'd slow, 
And at the side of " Royalty," 
A " Standard" man to row, 
As Volunteer was in the ' Queens," 
My military glance, 
Was noticed by the 
Prince cf Wales," 
As quite par excellence. 
Spoken—Ah I 
I 
don't mean the, au 
Tottenham Court Road 
Company—" Ours" is the, ah I 
crack corps in which—Cuogus, as 
bi7;v1 e. 
"St. James's" I've my chambers in, 
Duns can't make me retrench, 
A 
little Countess in May Fair, 
Makes me an fait tn French. 
No " Grecian" eye to ' Drury Lane," 
Where ballet girls do prance, 
To charm " Princesses," my finesse 
Is thought par excellence. . 
Spoken—Some find in the " Bower" of the South a " Gallery 
of Illustration," but give me the " Pavillion ' of the East in the 
"City of London," where I 
can revel in an ' Alhambra' of de-
lights, for—CI-loans, as before. 
N.B.-The places here mentioned can be readily localized by, the voca-
list, and the names of plays here mentioned can, of course, be changed so 
Atz to adapt the song to any place.

DER COBBLER'S DAUGHTER. 
In Baxter street, not long ago. 
Dere lived a 
cobbler's daughter; 
But now he don't live there some, 
Cos she's moved mit anodes quarter ; 
Her father soled Loots and also shoes, 
And put heels on them all for a 
quarter. 
Dem loafer fellows all used tc spark 
On dat little cobbler's daughter, 
CHORUS. 
But I 
lofed her and she alvays as 
So loving and so shrnilling, 
But they caught her picki ng 
pocket
s 
On a 
they 
sta ge, 
And sent her t
o Blackwell's Island. 
I 
took dat gal out for a 
ride, 
In a 
stage we went up Broatway; 
She sat down by a 
lady's side, 
Dat lady soon got uneasy; 
In a 
liddle vhile. 
She turned around to my gal, 
And caught her hands vete she oughtenter, 
She schreamed rght out, 
" 
My pocket- book's gone, 
it's stolen mit that cobbler,s daughter." 
But I 
lofed her, ctc. 
Der police came and arrested dat gal; 
Six months she got for her pocket-picking. 
Shudge Dowling said I 
vas her pal, 
Dat I 
deserved a 
licking. 
In a 
Black Maria they escorted her, 
To der Island across der Yater, 
Bey- set her making shoes mit very sharp toes, 
Dat innocent cobbler's daughter. 
But I 
lofed her, &c. 
Now ve.1 my lore she does come down, 
teld you vot I'll do, 
I'll make a 
big party mit my house, 
And invite efery one of you. 
You can dance der whole night long, 
Go home mit your gals in der morning, 
Und drink our lager after twelve at night 
Der ezercibe ve'll be schorning. 
But I 
lofed her, &c. 
OLD HATS AND RAG& 
As sung by the GREAT LINGAID. 
Old hats 1 
old rags! my trouble is great, 
Could I 
be in a 
more wretched state, 
I 
feel indeed my heart it will break; 
List, and I 
will tell you of my wrongs, 
Hark and I 
will my woes unfold; 
Br a 
girl I 
have been cruelly sold, 
And through her I've lost all my nice gold, 
My heart and my gold is both gone. 
CHORUS 
Old hats, old rags, my cry is old rags:' 
This bag on my back, the streets I 
drag, 
And Ruth, mine Ruth, I 
did love her so, 
Bat Slotchzein, I 
find I've been sold. 
She lived down an area in Union Square, 
And every day I 
did pass me by there, 
She was possess'd of beauty most rare, 
And one day she beckoned me to come, 
She had some old hats to exchange for new. 
She melted the heart of this poor Jew, 
And how I 
loved her! Ah, just a 
few, 
Dut Slotchzein, I 
find I've been sold. 
Old hats, old rags, dr.o..-
I 
used to call on her most every day, 
Down on my knees I 
implored her to say 
She'd be my dear wife and not to say nay, 
And then she agreed to be mine; 
But, oh my heart, I 
must have been cream. 
For in my old coat I 
opened a 
seam, 
And gave ten dollars to my heart's queen, 
To buy her some things for the time. 
Old hats, old rags, &e. 
She said, Now, dear Slotchzein, soon you'll be Irina, 
Drink my good health in a 
glass of old wine, 
It must have been poisoned, for I 
slept such a 
time; 
Which she turned it to profit it seems; 
For when I 
awoke, I 
thought I 
must choke, 
I 
was tied by the arms and legs with a 
rope, 
And Ruth had hooked it with mine coat, 
With a 
thousand dollars sewed in the seam. 
Old hats, old rags, &a.

I 
once could give good dinners, ah, ' twas then the hungry sinners 
Would haunt my table daily, praise my judgment, jokes and wine; 
Join in conviviality, accept my hospitality, 
Until, through prodigality, my fortune did decline. 
And so did they, for one by one they left me in my glory, 
A 
friend I 
stood in need of, but not one could I 
see; 
My money'd gone and so had they; well, 'tis the same old story, 
So while you have it, keep it, or you'll soon be "up a 
tree." 
CHORIIS.—I'd friends, &c, 
I 
one could drive my four-in-band, had money, too, at my command, 
Could " do the grand," you understand—how foolish I 
have been I 
I 
stand here to exemplify " sweet uses of adversity," 
To prove my friends in poverty—acquaintances, I 
mean : 
Better times will come again, a 
lesson 'twill have taught me— 
" 
Preserve me from my friends," for the future it shall be; 
I've paid for my experience, tho' you see to what it's brought me, 
I'm a " sadder, yet a 
wiser man," although I'm " up a 
tree."

THE SAILORS GRAVE. 
Our bark was far, far- from the land, 
-When the fiiirest.of-our gallant band 
Grdw deadly ,pale, and watietLaway, 
„Like the twilight of.,an autumn day. 
We had watch'd him throughiong hours of pain., 
-Our cares were greati-ourtiopes in vain 
Death's stroke he gave no coward's alarm.i, 
But,hesmiled, and died inhis.niestoute's #11318 
We had no costly winding-sheet, 
We placed two round & lot at his feet : 
Be lays in his hammock as snug and am sound 
,As a 
king in his long #Iliroud, marble- bound • 
-We proudly deck'd his funend vest 
With the Starry-Flad. upon his breast I 
We gave him this as a 
bldgc of the brave, 
,And then he was fit for a 
sailor's grave. 
Our voices broke, and hearts turned weak ; 
Oft tears were seen on the brownest cheek ; 
The quiver played on the bp of pride, 
As welewer'd him down the ship's dark side.; 
,Then a 
splash and a 
plunge, and our task was o'er, 
And.the billows rolled as they rolled- before, 
And many wild prayers hallow 'd the wave, 
And he sank beneativin a 
sailor's grave.

un- des and your grandmothers To see the ba - by show. 
The pretty little infant there, who's playing with a 
rattle, 
Weighs six pounds two and six, and lives on Thorley's food for 
cattle! 
You see that pensive piebald child, that interesting pet, 
Takes first prize at the show, and takes whatever he can get. 
The baby show, &c. 
That olive branch, of six months old, although lie cannot speak. 
Can read and wiite, and understands his Latin and his Greek; 
The next child, only ten days old, has grown so very stout, 
He takes his mother in his arms and carries her about. 
The baby show, dre. 
The next one is a 
knowing child, he must be, for he states, 
That though his mother eekacks and loves, his doctor whacks ase 
ales; " 
The way he bit his aged nurse brought tears into her eyes, 
He says, " That as he is a 
twin he's sure t'evin a 
prize." 
The baby show, 4c. 
That boy there is a 
little girl, just two foot high of age, 
she's took to drinking, and with her the bottle's all the rage; 
That other child does nothing else but suck his little thumbs, 
Just put your finger in his mouth, you'll bless his little gums. 
The baby show, die. 
It's feeding time; step in to see the pretty little dears, 
But if your nerves are weak at all, you'd better stop your ears; 
Then, when we think you've seen enough, we give a 
hint to go, 
And pinch the children till they cry, which clears the baby show. 
The baby show, die.

THE GAMBLER'S WIFE. 
Poetry by Dr. Crofts.—Musie by henry RnsseL 
Dark is the night; how dark I 
no light—no fire 
Cold on the earth the last faint sparks expire ; 
Shiv'ring, she watches by the cradle side, 
For him who pledged his love—last year a 
bride 1 
Hark! ' tis his footstep 1—No, 'tis past—'tis gone 
Tic I

how wearily the time rolls on. 
Why should he leave me thus ? he once was kind, 
And 1 
believ'd % would last—oh! how mad, how blind l 
Rest thee, my babe, rest on.—'tis hunger's cry I 
Sleep for there is no food; the fount is dry!, 
Famine and cold their wearing work have done; 
My heart must break—and thou my child I— 
Hushl the clock strikes one 1 
Hush ! 'tis the dice-box,—yes I 
he's there—he's there I 
For this he leaves me to despair; 
Leaves love— leaves truth--,--his wife—his child—for what? 
The gambler's fancied bliss—the gambler's horrid lot 
Yet, I'll not curse him,—no 'tis all in vain; 
'Tis long to wait, but sure he'll come again; 
And I 
could starve and bless him, but, my child, for y 
Oh, fiend I 
oh, fiend I—Hush ! the clock strikes two! 
Hark! how the sign board creaks—the blast howls by. 
Moan, moan, ye winds through the cloudy sky. 
ha! .tis his knock ! he comes, he comes once more; 
No, 'tis but the lattice-flaps—my hope is o'er I 
Can he desert us thus ? he knows I 
stay, 
Night after night. in loneliness to pray 
For his return, and yet he soes no tear; 
No, no, it cannot be—oh ! he will be here.,

Thou art cold—thou art freezing—but we will not part—

God ! protect my child—Hush— the clock strikes three— 
They're gone—the glimmerina spark hath fled— 
The wife and child are number'd with the dead ; 
On the cold earth, outstretch'd in solemn rest, 
The babe lies frozen on its mother's breast— 
The gambler ct)mes at last, but all is o'er,— 
Dread silence reigns around—the clock strikes four—

I COULD1PT -31ZILP LAUGHING, I.
..-
TICKLED ME SO. 
-From morning till night I'm indulging in mirth, 
I've always been so from the day of my 
birth; 
I 
grin like a 
Maltese cat all thro' each day, 
And never feel right unless laughing away. 
My infantile actions were certainly wild— 
All folks said I 
was a 
most wonderful chill; 
And when first sthort-coated, I'd have you to know, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
ClIORUS. 
Hal hal ha! ha! ho! ho! Ito! ho! 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
And when, by degrees, I 
had reached man's estate, 
I 
then looked about in search of . a 
mate, 
My eyea soon I 
Set on a 
girl tall and fair, 
And beg7.,'d that my heart and my home she would share. 
And while so persistently urging my claim, 
She gave her consent, and at last the clity came; 
But, when.in the morning to church we aid go, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, 
etc. 
I'm fond of a 
game, I'm a 
good one to chaff; 
At all kinds of mischief 
certain to laugh; 
I 
oft play a 
lark on some innocent elf, 
Nor care though the laugh should be turned 'gainst myself. 
I 
once, walking out, saw a 
man in a 
fit, 
To make him come round I 
his ear quickly bit; 
And when he jumped up, knock d 
me down with one blow. 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, etc. 
-My landlord once called for his two quarters' rent, 
But I 
couldn't .pay it because it was spent; 
So off to a 
broker he went very quick, 
And vowed he would seize upon every stick. 
Before he could get back, I 
gave him leg bail, 
For I 
shot the moon, but got caught, put in jail; 
And tho' plac"d in " limbo" for what I 
did owe, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, etc. 
Three times in succession my partner had twins— 
My place to look like a 
small school- room begins; 
Throughout all the day there is nothing but glee, 
For all of them have laughing fits just like me. 
The last time, to add to our family joys, 
To me three presented, a 
girl and two boys; 
Wher I 
saw the three cherubs all of a 
row, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, etc.

THE NIGHT THAT LARRY GOT WED. 
AIR: " 
Green's Grand New Balloon." 
00h, it was a.glorions night, 
The night that Larry got wed, 
So brimnd of fun and delight 
'Twas morn ' ere they got to bed. 
For the whiskey in showers like rain, 
Made the bride and the bridesmaids too, 
Each broth of a 
boy, e'en the swain. 
Young Hubby, have visions in view. 
Och, it was, ..tc. 
The world inito.,all went round, 
And they cared not a 
fig for sorrow ; 
In an ocean of joy_spell-bound, 
Not one of them thought of' the morrow. 
The bridegroom kissed his young wife, 
And so did some dozen others. 
For all of them were 'pen my life. 
As loving as sisters and Inotluzs. 
Qch, it was, ozo. 
The fiddler began to scrape, 
Their feathers the holies did shake 
They all Taglioni did ape, 
Till the floor was in a 
quake. 
Toe and heel was all the go, 
With an elegance quite sublime: 
To the fiddler they dodged to and fro, 
Yor they all danced in their own time. 
Och, it was, &o. 
Calamity water they took took 
Till both "of their eyes were wet ; 
Tho' they tried engaging to look, 
They couldn't their nature forget. 
Lasses quarrelled ' bout Jack and ' bout Jim, 
And they fought, and they swore, and they tore, 
But their heads beginning to swim, 
They one and all rolled on the floor. 
Och, it was, ate 
The smoke of the pipe tilled the room, 
They scarcely could each other,see ; 
And their ogles were all in a 
gloom, 
Through potations of gin and whiskey. 
The men now got in a 
rave, 
For they like the ladies were slewed, 
Their wrath no reason could assuage. 
So a 
general fight ensued. 
Next day when things came to view, 
As you may well suppose. 
Their eyes looked wondrous blue. 
And fat had grown each nose. 
Tattoo'd was each lady's face, 
On all an impression made. 
Of what at the wedding took .
place 
Of one of the Irish Brigade. 
Och, it was, &a.

TliE MOU&E-TRAP MAN. • 
.A.s Sang in the Burlesque of " Pluto," by MISS Arlen Dturnnto. 
Kind friends' in me you an object behold, 
Wounded iu feelings, and minus his heart: 
I 
lov'd a 
girl, but by her I've been sold, 
All for a 
mouse- trap man spicy and- smart. 
Outside her door loudly bawling he'd go 
"Mouse-traps a 
penny" thro'-out all the day. 
ia her good graces, he soon got, I 
know, 
Caught her with " mouse-traps" and stole her awtig t 
CHORUS. 
Mouse-traps, mouse- traps,' he'd
- cry, 
• 
Mouse- traps, fine mouse- traps' who'll'bny? 
Strong as a 
house, just hitve one and try, 
Mouse-traps a 
penny, a 
penny, who'll buy ?" 
In a 
dark corner this trep she didfix, 
Baited each hook with a 
piece of burnt cheese,' 
Woke up next morning and there she found six. 
Poor little mouses as dead as you please 
When she diskivered 'em, she cried ' 0 
lor, 
Never before was the like seen of sitch, 
Him as brought that ere' m.iusetrap to the door,.. 
I'm sure he's a 
conjuror, leastways a 
witch.' 
Mousetraps, mousetraps, etc. 
No more cold wittles I 
got from that day, 
All of.her perkisites' went to that chap, 
When I 
asked for 'era, she used for to say, 
As how she wanted 'ern to bait the trap. 
'That may be true,' said 
but, 'p'raps you'll tell, 
Where are the governor's left off suits ? 
You must have them for you know very well, 
They don't bait mousetraps with old trousers andboots! 
Mousetraps, ' mousetraps, &c. 
She kick'd me out, slamm'd the door in my face, 
Sent me adrift with a 
flea in my ear, 
She'd guy me ' turnips,' and it was a 
ease,' 
I 
was outrivalled by that chap, 'twas clear, 
Last Sun lay week they were man and wife made, 
Which fill'd by buzzurn with grief, care and woe; 
Now they are doing a 
fine roaring trade, 
For mousetraps a 
penny,' they both brawling do go. 
Mousetraps, mousetraps, dr,e.

SHE WAS JUST ABOUT THE AGE. 
-(CONCLUDED 
She lived a 
little way from town, It wasn't very far, 
And with her dwelt a 
cross old man although be was her pa; 
One day when her papa was out I 
went to her's to dine, 
And in my pocket for a 
treat, I 
took a 
quart of wine. 
For she liked wine, she would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the age. 
We sat and talked a 
little while, and after we had dined, 
for a 
little drop of wine felt mightily inclined, 
When a 
rat tat we heard at, the door, and she to me did rush, 
And pushed me in the cupboard, and 'twits then I 
saw her hlush: 
But then, of course, she would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the age 
Her father then came in, and talked for half an hour or more, 
And she sat leaning all the while against the cupboard door, 
• 
When the wine-flask in my pocket broke and made a 
precious mess, 
Ran underneath the cupboard door, all iound her new silk dress. 
For she wore silk, bhe would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the age. 
Her father saw the flowing wine, and said :" Sarah, what is that!" 
She said. " Some jam and pickle jars are broken by the cat," 
He opened then the cupboard door, exclaiming, " Who are you ?' 
And I 
was in a 
pickle, in a 
jam, and in a 
stew. 
The old man swore he would you know, he would you know, he 
would, 
But then, of course, he would you know, he was just about the age. 
He pulled me out and punched my head, then with good humor lie, 
On bearing I 
was not had off, invited me'to tea; 
Since then I've married Sarah Green, and pleased I 
am to see, 
That she and all our little ones quite happy seem to be. 
But then, of course, she would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
iut the, of course, she would you know, she was just about the age.

She's bare-footed and pretty, she's lively and witty, 
She sings her wild songs to the murmlring sea, 
She'll dance on the sand where the fisherman stands, 
And join in the music of a 
wild swelling glee. 
She sits in her boat and sings o'er th billow, 
And flirts with the spray like a 
sea s'cimming gull ; 
She laughs at the winds whose revels are music, 
And belts to the time with the stroke of her scull.- Cho.

Her hair I

wreath of bright sea weed; 
plant in her bosom a 
blooming moss rose: 
She shall go like a 
fay with sweet tinkling music, 
With rin,gs on her fingers and bells on her toes.-Cho.
