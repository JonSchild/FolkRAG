To lead the Mulligan ball.

SUE AND I". 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN especially for JAS. BRADLEY. 
WE went on a 
pic-nic, Sue and I, 
'Twas a 
high toned colored affair, 
We had lots of spruce beer and pie, 
All dinc:iy barbers they were there. 
We danced in the quadrille to and fro, 
The waltz and mnzourka to charm, 
Vihen she whispered you're my own dearest Job, 
And she leaned like a 
zephyr on my arm. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never shall forget my Sue, 
Like a 
weasel, oh jolly, she's sly, 
And its mighty high per coon, 
Of a 
Sunday afternoon, 
As we promenade, Sue and I. 
We arrived and landed from the boat, 
Ebenezer Thompson walked behind, 
He catched me by the swallow tail coat, 
I 
told him that he wasn't very kind. 
He pulled a 
razor to put my light, 
Jealousy was beaming in his eye, 
My Sue fell in the gutter in a 
fright, 
And the other nigger w
- enehes began to cry. 
I 
never shall forget, Ar.c.

And scorn not the strains of his ould withered hand, 
But remember his fingers they once moved sharper, 
As he sang to the praise of his dear native land ;

lov'd emblem, 
Was pluck'd from the soil by the Saxon's wild paw,

Their bold Phelim Brady the bard of Armagh,

Row I

Tho' tour score years have flown by since then, 
Oh sweet recollection how dear the reflection, 
The wildest of boys make the best of old men. 
At a 
fair or a 
wake I 
would twist my shillelah, 
And trip thro' a 
dance wid my brogues tied wicl straw, 
I 
was called by the colleens around me assembled,

Yet Ireland's my home and the land that I 
love, 
And when cruel death to his cold arms shall take me, 
And my soul shah have flown to the sweet realms above, 
Then oh let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be that °I 
dear Erin, old Erin go bragh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my good wife, God bless her, 
Lay your own Phelim Brady the bard of Armagh,

I

In the Daniel Webster, across the sea. 
In the Fourteenth Ward I

In a

By perseverance I 
elevated 
And went to the front like a

As I 
walk the street.. ,ach friend I

Says: " There goes Muldoon. 
He's a 
solid•man." 
At any party or any raffle 
I 
always go as an invited guest; 
As conspicuous General Granite, boys, 
I 
wear a 
rosebud upon my breast. 
I'm called upon to address the meeting, 
‘Vithout regard to clique or clan; 
show the Constitution, with elocution, 
Bekase, you know, bat a 
solid man. 
Go with me, &c. 
I 
control the Tombs; I 
control the Island. 
My constituents, they all go there 
To enjoy the summer's recreation, 
And the refreshing East River air. 
I'm known in Harlem, I'm known in Jarsey; 
I'm welcomed hearty on every hand. 
Wid my re-ga lay. on Patrick's day, 
march away likc a

Ff-177ORDS, 
New by-words now are all the go, 
You'll hear them almost everywhere, 
Even the ladies pick them up 
And use them without fear. 
I'll see you when I've sold my dog, 
For you know how it is yourself; 
Just find out how the old thing works, 
Then walk off on your ear. 
Let's go out and give the boys a 
treat, 
You'll hear the girls say on the street, 
So they give their trunks a 
holiday 
And start out for a 
time. 
They borrow some dry goods clerk's ear, 
Into a 
saloon him they steer. 
They pinch his leather, then they clear 
And still you wonder at crime ? 
I 
recollect a 
circumstance, 
I 
took a 
girl down to a 
dance: 
Says I, my dear you want a 
drink. 
Say she " You bet I 
do." 
I 
thought a 
lemonade was right, 
Says I 
Deav, whisky'll make you tight 
Says she, " Don't weigh me up so LOA, 
Or I'll put a 
head on you." 
15 
Such sayings I 
don't use at all, 
For fear some accident might befall; 
I 
might get pulled for ltnowing them. 
So I 
guess I'd better stop— 
On the quiet tvvixt you and I: 
Of danger I 
am always shy. 
I'd like to stop and say good-bye 
But Cheese it, here's a

DARLING, I

Life is fading fast away, 
But, my darling, you will be, will be— 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes, my darling, you will be, 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS. 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to- day, 
Life is fading fast away— 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say, 
Oh! my darling, mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes, my darling, mine alone— 
You have never older grown!

Never, never, winter's frost and chill; 
Summer warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I'm growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair, 
What to us is sliver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below; 
since I 
kissed you, mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you, mine alone, 
You have never older grown.

AMOS. 
I 
am in love with a 
pretty girl, 
Who calls me pudding head; 
BOTH. 
And when she turned and jilted me, 
For five long weeks I 
sighed, 
She eloped this town with some other chap. 
Who at the corner cried, cried, cried. 
What., did he cry ? 
cnouta 
Peanuts, peanut-, warm your hands and fill your bellies, 
Peanuts, peanuts, smoking from the can,

time fighting abut this girl; I 
don't care no more for her 
than 1 
do for my life. 
Does you ? 
BILL. — No; course I 
don't. I 
wouldn't care, only she took 
me so cool, I 
came near freezing after I 
took her to the 
theatre and squatted i
,er in a 
cushion seat. 
She put her 
hand so lovingly on my voice, and said in such a 
sweet tone 
of shoulder, 
Now you sit here, my Billy dear, 
I'll just go to the door, 
And fetch some roasted peanuts in, 
But I 
never saw her more. 
SPOREN. — Yes, she had gone fled from my gaze like a 
beautiful dream, and all that remained to tell the sad dismal 
story, was a 
lump of coke that looked up in my face as if it 
would say, 
Peanuts, peanuts, etc.

With your dimpled hands compressing, 
And your snowy arms entwine.

Come and whisper soft and low, 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I

Little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
We may never meet again, 
We may never roam together, 
Down the dear old shady lane. 
Future years may bring us sorrow. 
That our hearts but ,tle know, 
Still of care we should not borrow, 
Come and kiss me ere I

For singing or fpr dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patrick's Day I 
love to wear the Hat me father wore, 
It's old, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so 
green. 
From my father's great ancestors it dcscended with gallon--
It's a 
relic of old decency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good erenir'—good luck to ycu I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ti(:- nn I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Dallymore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore, 
It is old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see. 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and 
more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father 
wore. 
It's old, etc. , 
7iTS11. MAMMA WAS HitE, 
Sung with immense applause by ALEX. DAVIS. 
A TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss hiz, brawny cheek and say, 
Now, papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
Ard Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here!" 
CHORUS. 
I 
wish mamma was here! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigt 
"I wish mamma was here!" 
A 
tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
lie pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
And Willie murmured hi his sleep, 
" I 
wish mamma was here!" 
"I wish mamma," (tc. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Unti_ 
turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then. 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair, 
Oh! live, my darling dear!" 
And Willie breathed his last fond sigh, 
"I know mamma is here!" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," &c. 
24 
Its very strange, but every one, 
Gives me a 
name for noise and fun. 
What every body says is true, 
consort with a 
jovial crew. 
When the sun is sinking low, 
Helter, skeltr, out we go, 
A 
jolly dinner is the thing, 
And as we pass the wine we sing, 
Jog along, jog along, &c. 
Then to the music halls we post, 
And visit those we like the most, 
There in stalls our weeds we smoke, 
And shout encore to song and joke. 
Bal!et pets are in our way, 
We throw the prettiest a 
bouquet, 
Mu 
de vie, we gaily drab, 
And then why off we start again. 
Jog along, jog along, &c, 
The smal hours now are drawing nigh, 
And supper, supper, is the cry; 
Then Lobster salads disappear, 
With oysters, stout and lager beer, 
Deviled chicken, kidneys too, 
A 
glorious bowl of punch we brew, 
Clinking glasses gaily sound, 
While our merry chaunt goes round. 
Jog along, jog along, &c. 
JOG ALONG, BOYS. 
Sung by LEW TIMMONS. 
FRO21 me no dole-a-ful dirge you'll hear, 
To make you sad or leave you queer. 
But it you're dull this chant of mine, 
Will wake you ep like sparkling wine. 
Ups and downs in hie I've seen, 
Lucky and unlucky been, 
But wrong or rigt t. or right or wrong, 
This is the burtheu of my song. 
CHORus. 
Jog along, jog along, jog along, boys. 
Jog along, boys with a 
rattle and a 
noise, 
Jog alone, jog along, jog almg, boys jog along, boys, 
Hurrah.

For thy gracious presence long. 
Come and fill the fields with flowers, 
Come and flu the groves with song, 
Make the orchards white with bloom, 
Bid the hawthorn breathe perfume.

COMING HOME FROM THE BALL, 
Written and Corapcsea by Joszisa P. 
SI:ZLI.T. 
Arranzed 
THERE is no place so gay as the ball-room, 
When were dancing ia Creamy de:ight, 
When the cares of the day never ,: rcct 
In the flush cf the beautiful night, 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasure we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene no enchanting, 
And go home 1-toking sleepy and core. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we all know there is nothing more delightful 
than to go to a 
ball, and dance all night with a 
pretty girl, and 
eat expensive suppers, and flrt a 
I:tile I:1 a 
qu• 
corner, and 
all that you know; but when reflecting on it the next day, o3e 
an't help but think, 
CIIORC2. 
Oh it's all very we:1 to be waltzing, 
And the pleasure we love to recall, 
But you know how we feel hi the morning, 
Coming home, coming home from the balL 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us bestow, 
Ev'ry face wears a 
mantle cf gladness, 
There is welcome where ever we go; 
But when morning comcirik)aml we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we thint we were foolish for dancing, 
Wnen we should have been home in our beds. 
SPOKEN.—That is just how it is. 
It's all very fine while it 
lasts, but we have to pay for it in the end. 
One will say, " Oh, 
my, I'm so sleepy." 
Sonic body else will yawn out very loud, 
Dear me, I 
wisli I 
was home." 
Another will complain of 
being chilly, and so on. 
And when we contemplate all this we 
naturally say to ourselves, 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, etc. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And wc heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in thro' the window, 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we must all say good-bye at last, while we 
sympathize with each other ia our misery: and go home shiver-
ing in the morning air. 
On the way we all join together and 
give vent to our feelings thus— 
Oh it's all qery well to go waltzing, etc.

THE 4, P. 0. 
Sang by JENNIE H UGIIES. 
IN St: Martins le Grand as you all well know, 
Is the building that's known as the G. P. 0. 
Where billet-dothx, Valentines, and Tailor's bills too 
Before_ they:ever reach us must pass through ; 
A 
party was employed there whose sorrowful tale, 
Would touch a 
heart of flint, through a 
douple coat of mail. 
His surname it was Johnson, Ids °thar name was Joe, 
And he was a 
letter sorter hi the G. P. 0. 
crionus. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The .afEce in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. tile G. P. 0. 
And he was a 
letter sorter in the G. P. 0. 
Now Joe became spooney on a 
good-looking lass, 
Whose father was a 
dealer in crockery and glass, 
He often thought of marriage, though his screw was low, 
(He received " one pound per week" at the G. P. 0!) 
But her parent was ambitious, and nearly drop'd 
With horror when poor Joe, " the awful question" pop'd. 
What! think 
give my Che-lid to one so low, 
I 
mean her for a 
Big Gun in the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
".' 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
• 
You're but a 
letter sorter with the common name of Joe. 
• 
30 
From that cruel old Coger, poor Joe then rushed, 
His plans sent to smithereens, his hopes all crushed, 
At his " official duties" no longer wa.s he gay, 
He was " going to the dogs " the fellows would say; 
He was always making blunders, always doing wrong, 
The letters meant for Manchester, he sent to Boulogne, 
What should have gone to Charing Cross, turned up at Jericho. 
So they had to kick him out of the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. O. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. O. 
No more a 
letter sorter was the young man Joe. 
The girl who'd been the cause of his sorrows and his ills, 
Was poisoned with a 
box of Kamptulicon Pills, 
Her father became bankrupt, and wild with his losses, 
Sent a 
sixpence to " the Claimant," then took to backing 
horses; 
My melancholy story is drawing to a 
close, 
Joe meditated suicide to finish up his woes, 
He went and paid his Income Tax, and then did go, 
Attd cut his elbow with a 
post card near the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. 1'. 0. 
(And that was the finale of the young man Joe.

THE ANIMALS' FAIRS 
The FREEMAN SISTERS' version, as sung by them with great sums* 
throughout the Country. 
BANJO DUET. 
I 
SUPPOSE you've all had dreams, 
Scme strange and very curious, 
At least we've been there ourselves, 
The last it was most, furious; 
We dreamed we were two eagles bold, 
Called the king birds of the air, 
Together with all the birds and beasts 
Assembled at a 
Fair. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas at the animals' fair . 
All birds and beasts were there; 
The big baboon, by the light of the moon, 
Was combing his auburn hair; 
The monkey he got drunk, 
Stepped on the elephant's trunk, 
The elephant sneezed and 
1 
on his knees, 
Oh! how was that for the monk, monk, monks 
The donkey and the cow, 
And a 
great big dog called Gypsy, 
Got drinking soap-sud smash, 
And soon became quite tipsy; 
The ring-tailed ape and crocodile, 
Two such jolly fellows, 
The black snake kissed the turtle dove, 
Which made the pigeon jealous. 
A 
fight then soon began 
'Twixt the cat and the black and tan, 
The cat got bit and fell in a 
fit, 
And died like a 
bold Soldier man; 
The monkey theu came up, 
And challenged that ere pup, 
But the pup couldn't see 
Where the fun could be, 
So he quickly threw up the sponge, sponge, sponge, 
After everything was quiet 
The tables than were spread, 
They'd butternut.-
.; and corn, 
And grated Indian bread. 
They'd cod fish balls made out of mud, 
And brick-dust succotash, 
They had mince pies made out of flies, 
Red herring, toast and hash. 
CHORUS. 
It soon began to rain, 
The mule went home with the crane, 
The wolf and bear then chased the hare, 
Which caused the bed bug pain; 
The jackal he did cry, 
The spider eloped with the fly; 
The lion and bee they went to Sea, 
How is this for high, high, high

GOOD-EVENING. 
I 
HAD been dining rather late, 
The fact I 
think it best to state 
As I 
strolled out without a 
mate, 
One very pleasant evening, 
On fancy beats my steps were led— 
As onward through the streets I 
strayed, 
A. lovely figure I 
saw ahead. 
Walked past and said: " Good evening." 
I 
felt a 
disappointed dunce, 
Not a 
word she answered in response, 
Though I 
repeated more than once: 
" 
Good-evening, Miss, good evening." 
At length she turned her head this way— 
And you can judge of my dismay— 
She was fifty-five if she was a 
day— 
And of course I 
said " Good-evening." 
My disappointment made me queer, 
I 
stepped into an ale-house near. 
Addressed the bar-maid thus: " My dear, 
A 
glass of ale—good-evening." 
With sparkling eyes she a:1 ale soon served— 
What is It makes me so unnerved? 
Close standing by me I 
observed 
My tailor: s,"' Good-evenint. 
84 
SPOKEN—How do you do, sir ? 
I 
am always happy to see 
my tailor, especially when I 
don't owe him anything. 
Good, 
evening, sir, good-evening! 
His presence spoiled my wish to stay, 
I 
reached the door, then heard her say, 
" 
Please pay before you go away, 
Ten cents, sir then good-evening." 
" 
Pray, pardon Miss, I 
beg of you. 
I 
quite forgot." (and that was true.) 
The tailor says: " You often do; 
Good-evening, Snooze, good- evening." 
I 
felt a 
blush come o'er my face, 
At such a 
crowd and such disgrace— 
They shouted as I 
left the place, 
" " Good-evening, Snooze, good evening." 
Policeman Jones, outside the door, 
IncreE -ed my misery more and more. 
He say.. " I've watched your little game before, 
Get ()t 
my beat—good evening." 
I 
left his beat, . ' id not suit, 
To argue with the stupid brute, 
Or hear him make me that salute : 
" 
Good-evening, Snooze, good-evening." 
Into a 
lane I 
made a 
dive, 
A 
fresh street reached more dead than live, 
And there again met Miss Fifty-five, 
Who simpered out, " Good-evening, Johnny, 
good-evening." 
Is

I 
hired a 
hack myself to save, 
And handsome to him did behave— 
Two fares for one I 
did him give, 
On that unlucky evening. 
When I 
found out what I 
had done, 
I 
turned and found the cab had gone--
But I'll not forget the driver's tone, 
As he remarked, " Good-evening, sir 
good-evening!" 
But strange things happen for the best: 
If you're amused I'll waive the rest— 
Like the hackman you'll enjoy the jest 
At my expense this evening; 
But luckily he's left me here, 
This place where I 
have naught to fear; 
So with kind regards to all friends here 
I 
beg to say, " Good-evening."

THOM AS'S MAO= 
YOU all have heard of sewing machines, and all no doubt 
have seen, 
There's Wheeler & Wilson's, Wilcox and Singer's machines, 
But although I 
mention all these names, its none of these I 
mean 
The one I 
call attention to is Thomas's machine. 
Ily wife begged me to buy her one, of course what could I 
do, 
I 
loved her, and I 
bought her one, but oh! that act I 
rue, 
For ever since we've had such rows, and such disgraceful 
scenes, 
And all through buying one of Mr. Thomas's machines. 
Ouorrrs. 
Oh, Mr. Thomas, if my agony you'd seen, 
You'd be sorry you invented that wonderful maehine, 
For my peace and my happiness has never been seen, 
Since my Mary Jane began to work on a 
Thomas's ma-
chine. 
lsto sooner had I 
a 
thought, than to work she did begin, 
And all day long I 
had to hear that dreadful whirring din; 
I 
gently reprimanded her, and told her, my Mary Jane, 
If I 
had that noise too often, it would surely turn my brain. 
You must know that I'm an author, and by writing earn my 
bread, 
And to write well you want silence, and a 
cool collected head: 
So as any noise disturbed me, you can understand my spleen, 
When I 
had to write and listen to the whirr of that machine. 
Oh, Mr. Thomas, &c. 
,i11161.16V113164-
37 
At first I 
swore a 
littl) swear, and then I 
swore a 
big, 
And then I 
jumped about with rage, and almost danced a 
jig, 
But it never La:1 the last effxt, she worked away like steam, 
Sometimes she'd d.) a 
fixnee or tuck, aid then she'd do a 
.‘k 
seam. 
A 
feeling—the reverse of love, almost &siu to hate— 
At last came over m-, and I 
said, my lova w,:11 sf•parate 
I'll take my book'; and papers to a 
spot calm and serene, 
Where I 
cannot be annoyed by Thomas's machine, 
Oh, Mr. Thomag„ &c. 
_ 
It's two months since I 
left her, and I 
certainly must say, 
I 
regret the cause exceedingly, that made me go away, 
So mind you all take warning, now, by what you've heard 
and seen, 
And don't be over anxious for a 
Thomas'.; machine. 
Oh, Hr. Thomas, &c.

LARDY DARDY DO, 
AEI! dear friends, how d'ye do? hope I 
see you all well, 
If you're game now, my dodge 
just explain, 
And I 
think you'll agree, when once you've heard what it is, 
That it's simply no loss—but all gain; 
Don't you see, short °LIM and all that sort of thing, 
Very awkward for one it is true, 
But I 
find that the needful is quite amply supplied, 
By what I 
call my Lardy dardy do. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, dear friends, it's the lardy dardy do—very 
prevalent just now—and allow me to call your attention to the 
fact, that 
CHORUS. 
I'm the lardy dardy swell, 
And I 
don't mind telling:you, 
That the only income I 
possess, 
Is my lardy dardy do. 
I've a 
wonderful fancy now for all that is good, 
Superfine, and the best that can be had, 
What I 
wish for I 
purchase, never asking the price, 
For such meanness 'Mould truly be sad; 
As I 
don't mean to pay, it's the very best way, 
Not to ask what I 
don't wish to know, 
For you see Lardydardy is no coin of the realm, 
Tho' I 
find it always seems with me to go. 
SPOKEN.—And very seldom misses fire, but it's not to be 
wondered at, for you see— 
I'm the lardy, ite. 
39 
Witn our fair sex my Lardy dardy do is the go; 
And it seems the sweet darlings to impress, 
I've already the question popp'd to more than four score, 
And my answer has always been " yes !" 
But the worldly Papas, and their cautious Mammas, 
When their daughter's affections I 
woo, 
Always say, when I 
tell them upon what I 
depend, 
You can never live on Lardy dardy do. 
SPOKEN.—Which is a 
very natural conclusion to arrive at, but 
still the dear girls would gladly share my Lite, although 
I'm the lardy, Zze,

McSIVEGAN FROM MAYO. 
Written and sung by ED. Hartnioax, 
Dedicated to 
JERRY BARRINGTON, the Dublin Counsellor. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A. J. 
FlerrErt, in ;: he Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
OH, its lately I've missed her, 
Shure I 
mane me sister; 
She's strong as a 
bull, 
And she strikes a 
hard blow. 
Her cheeks they are rosey, 
And nate as the posey; 
At the big Castle Garden 
She landed below. 
CHORUS. 
Oh say, have you seen her, 
To you I'd describe her,— 
She wears a 
red petticoat, 
And a 
hat on her head; 
She moves whin she's walking, 
She spakes whin she's talking; 
An' her petticoat is marked 
0, P, Q, X, Y, R., Z. 
She comes out wid my Cousins, 
I 
count them by the dozens; 
I'm forced for to think 
They have led her astray. 
For some information 
I'd suffer starvation; 
43

She was the lady 
That fought Mrs. Brady, 
At home in Mayo 
She could whip all the men. 
She'd sing like a

Or any canary, 
She never was standing 
Whinever she set. 
Like old Neptune's daughter, 
She'd fall in the water, 
She'd come out like a 
herring, 
She'd never get wet. 
She was sober when drinking, 
When aslape she was thinking: 
She was .delicate and soft 
As the wild buffalo. 
She'd a

sailor 
On board of a 
whaler; 
Her name is McSwegan, 
From the county Mayo.

Air: Pat. _Roach. 
DID you ever hear tell of Ted Murphy, 
He came from the County Mayo, 
He kept a 
bar-room in this city, 
In a 
democratic ward here below. 
His distillery was over in Brooklyn, 
In a 
place that they call Irishtown, 
You'd get a 
bucket of ale for five cents, 
He'd trust whin you'd put money down.

Success to my friend, Teddy Murphy, 
He often gave me two for one, 
I've played forty-fives at his table, 
Drank his whisky his beer and rum.

Swept the sand off the flare wid a 
broom, 
I've raffled for many a

In Ted Murphy's little back room.

There was laborers, canallers, and riggers, 
Who worked on the docks very hard, 
Shovelmen, pipemen, and drivers, 
Who worked on the big Boulevard. 
On Saturday nights they assembled,

tiddler to play up a

And they danced till the break in the morning, 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was a 
Dutchman kept over opposite, 
Who was jealous of Ted's rushing trade, 
He put up a 
job one fine evening, 
For the police to go make a 
raid 
On the liquors, barrels and glasses, 
In the bar-room wid their clubs they whit, 
And poor Teddy without provocation, 
To the Island for 10 days was sint. 
Poor Teddy he lost his influence, 
In the courts and the grand committee, 
He sarved his full time in the prison, 
Praying each day to get free.

To swim to the Long Island shore,

-THE QUEEN OF THE CONCERT SALOON, 
I'LL sing you a 
song of a 
pretty little gal: 
Oh! she was a 
high percoon— 
Her hair it was red, and curled about her head, 
She's de Queen of de Concert Saloon. 
You will see her, every night dressed in blue and white, 
And her apron all trimmed off with yaller: 
Her smiles are fascinating when on de folks she waits, 
And breaks de hearts of all de pretty fellers. 
With a 
little paint and powder, she looks like a 
rose 
Or a 
sun-flower out in full bloom: 
Her nose it is pug, and sits on her little mug, 
And her breath is de sweetest of perfume, 
Her teeth dey am false but deir color am green, 
And she's left-handed in bofe feet: 
Each night out de door dere is lovers by scores, 
Who take her down to Taylor's for a 
treat. 
Dare was a 
young man who fell in love 
Wid dis little charming young dear: 
For, he seen her, one night when he was tight, 
In de concert saloon peddling beer: 
lie spent his money like a 
sailure so bould, 
And swore (hit he'd marry her soon: 
But she played de poor feller for all he was worth: 
Den eloped from de concert saloon. 
Now, this young maid was sweet thirty-five, 
But she looked like a 
woman of twenty: 
And her little pug nose was as red as a 
rose, 
But for all that she had lovers plenty. 
Her teeth was false, and so was her heart, 
Her skin was dark just like an Octoroon: 
So young fellers, take my advice: Shun de waiter gals 
What tends in de concert saloons.

GOOD-BYE-I'LL SEE YOU LATER. 
Sung with great success, by TONY PAsrox. 
TO what I 
hear a'bout the town

give my 
close attention; 
The sayings that I

How great the rage for by-words now, 
It couldn't be greater, 
But the latest one that's come out is, 
Good-bye--I'll see you later, 
Each little boy upon the street, 
Of men an imitator, 
Will holler to a 
boy he'll meet, 
Good-bye—I'll see you later. 
The other evening out I 
walked, 
My leisure time beguiling, 
When into a

And found the boys a "

had to drink 
Till my spirits grew elator. 
And very soon I 
staggered out, 
With " Good-bye—I'll see you later." 
A 
pretty girl I 
met, her eyes 
A 
glance of love shot through me, 
And soon for supper we were bound, 
I 
thought, of course, she knew me. 
She drank so much, it really seemed 
Twould soon intoxicate her; 
Thinks I 
she'll break my pocket-book 
Before it gets mach later. 
To my dismay I 
caught her soon, 
A-winking at the waiter, 
Saying, " here's a 
flat!" Says I, " Enough.

8OLDIER TALK. 
ONE very funny hatit, since our cruel war t 
s 
done, 
And as welcome as the devil, to each and every one. 
Whatever now may happen, even in oar daily walk, 
We find our soldier people full of military talk. 
Cuoans. 
Soldier talk, soldier talk„ it now 13 all the rage, 
In every conversation. on every tvritte:1 page; 
And it is the truth, both young and old you may go near or far, 
The people all have soldier talk, contracted in the war, 
Miss Dinah Snow is married to a 
dashing Soldier fine, 
She says, in hanging out the clothes, she's going to " dress the 
line," 
And when she goes to fix her hair, with military tunes, 
She combs her wool in " regiments," then turns it in " platoons." 
Soldier talk, Se. 
If you go to set a 
table, you must set the plates in " rank," 
The spoons in front as " skirmishers," the kulvcs and forks 
upon the " flank; ' 
You call the ham the " colors," for ths men to " rally round," 
And you toll the folks to " fall In," and bravely " bold their 
ground," 
So12.1er talk, 
.rhe women too, how quickly new habits now contract, 
You'll sae them every day wearing " cascades " on their back, 
4. 
54 
And when they go to cross a 
gutter (you'll think Pm rude, I 
fear), 
Especially If 2:4;'s 
ñy why, it's " close up in the rear.' 
Soldier talk, &e. 
But as this life Is ended, fast as I 
close the rhyme, 
The doctors at the " surgeon's call," the lawyers " marking 
time," 
And there's the " chaplain," with the " troops," he'll tell you 
what to do 
To miss old Nick's " roll-call" and shirk the last " tattoo. 
Soldier talk, ttc.

THE LITTLE HIBERNIAN HARP, 
Written and composed by SAM. BAGNALL. Sting by JENNIE ENG. 
An ! well I 
remember, one frosty December 
The winds whistled cold and the snow it fell sharp, 
I 
saw a 
young maiden whose arms were quite laden, 
She carried a 
little Hibernian harp; 
She stopped near the door of a 
mansion so stately, 
The lights from the windows shone full in her face, 
I 
thouL,lit it my duty to watch that young beauty 
Whose foot pressed the snow with such delicate grace. 
CHORUS. 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp, 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp. 
Bright jewels were shining, ' mid tresses entwining 
On heads of fair beauties, all blushes and sigh, 
But they saw not the beautiful jewels that sparkled 
And fell from the lids of this poor maiden's eyes 
As over the harp strings her fingers were straying 
The notes on the night wind came plaintive and slow 
The pale lamp of heaven shone forth on the maiden 
Who stood like a 
statue transfixed to the snow. 
And the wind, &C. 
59 
.64 
I 
spoke to this maiden, whose heart was so laden, 
Who stood so forlorn in the streets for a 
while, 
Her sobs wrung my heart as she answer'd me sadly, 
And said I 
am far from the Emerald Isle : 
My parents are dead, and I 
wander dejected, 
In search of a 
boy that I 
love and adore; 
He's long since departed from me broken-hearted, 
And I 
am alone far from Erin's green shore. 
The wind whistled, &c. 
Need I 
say, I 
saw her, with bright hopes before her, 
Embark in a 
vessel for Erin's green shore, 
I 
watched her on deck till the evening's dark shadows 
Shut out from my sight, and I 
saw her no more; 
On a 
cold winter's night as I 
sit by the fire. 
And mournful winds whisper that snow's falling sharp, 
I 
think of the desolate, poor Irish maiden 
Who tinkled the little Hibernian harp. 
The wind whistled, &c.

with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from

proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a

Her form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart.
