Born in Connecticut, father is a grad of Yale then served in WW II. Came into the 
merchant marine by chance. Wanted to go to the Coastguard Academy initially. Was 
applied and then turned down but then went to the US Merchant Marine academy. 
Graduated in 1979 as a deck officer. Worked with Texaco for fifteen years as a deck 
officer. Then got unlimited masters license, then sailed as chief officer. Trade outed were 
around the US. Went to South Africa, Soviet Union and got to see a lot of the world. 
Came ashore with General Maritime CO. Served as an expediter. Came to Norton Lily. 
Tanker operations manager. Like the 'fireman' for all issues related to tanker, oil etc. 
Have 33 years experience in the maritime world.

Mother was army nurse. Father graduated from Yale with engineering degree and went to 
sea as a wiper. When they heard he was a graduate from Yale with engineering degree 
offered to let him take the first asst engineer's license since they were desperate for 
people during war time. He sat for third asst and got through and then second asst during 
the war. Was told being Norwegian, all related back to Eric the Red. Oldest brother 
retired from Coastguards.  
 
00:10:30 
In the merchant marine academy, pick one of two tracks, - either deck officer or 
engineering officer. Or the dual license. Sophomore and junior year you spend 6 months 
on sea and 6 months of classes. Senior year only classes, completing education, getting 
licenses etc. Because of that asked normally carry 22-28 hours of credit time. Batch 
before his was the first to allow women into the service academies. Had technical 
knowledge to sit for the highest license but no experience. Changed a lot since first day to 
when he retired. Attributes it to training. First trip from New Orleans to Germany and 
then to Leningrad. carrying govt materials for the army into Germany and then structural 
steel for Moscow Olympics. Had taken pics in Leningrad. did not know was not supposed 
 
 
to. Camera disappeared that night from Seamen's club. Soviet Union was a unique 
experience. Also sailed to South Africa in the sophomore year.  
 
00:19:35 
Unique about King's Point - no training ship. Went aboard commericial vessels. Training 
was with professional who had been at sea for years. No training with contemporaries. 
Sea Project - navigation, cargo handling, ship stability, plus English and other subjects. 
Graded on this as part of graduate program. Was with second mate and was in charge of 
navigation. Helped with cargo. Got involved in every aspect. This is advantage of being 
in federal academy as opposed ot state run school. Intense one on one training. US Naval 
academy doesnot teach celestial navigation to officers anymore because they rely in 
electronics. But if there is a power failure they don't equip officers with tools to figure out 
where they are.  
 
00:25:10 
Container ships were converted from break bulk ships. McClane started Sealand. He 
revolutionized the industry by putting things in boxes and moving the boxes. Has made 
the world smaller.  
 
00:29:25 
Started as a deck cadet and when at sea achieved unlimited masters license. Third mate is 
entry level position for license deck. For Texaco was a non union ship. Carried three 
mates and a master. Engineering dept would have three levels of engineers. Master is in 
overall control of the vessel. Most union ships will have two third mates. Chief mate is in 
charge of cargo and acts as an asst to the master. When you come aboard as third mate, 
you are expected to know nothing and be green. Time requirements - as third mate got 
paid 8 hrs a day 5 days a week and overtime. After Exxon Valdez there were forceful 
laws on working hours in a day.  Shuttle hanker service. Been a lot of changes over the 
years. More structured world since they reinforced the work hours. Merchant ships have 
engine control recorders which are more accurate when it comes to reconstructing the last 
few minutes in case of an eventuality.  
 
00:41:40 
Rules that say if a boat is fishing it has right of way. Yes and no. If there is a larger boat 
is in the channel that is constrained by its draft, it has right of way. Sailboats normally 
have right of way because of the limitations under which it operates. The one rule that 
really applies is the bigger vessel always wins.  
 
00:48:10 
"There are days I miss the sea." Got to spend more time with family when was at sea. 
Since there were off days after an extended period of time at sea. Would see the family 
but would miss blocks of it. Longest trip was four and half months. Went around the 
 
 
world. One of the last trips. Provided a good economic base. There were trade-offs. Have 
seen whales playing in the middle of the ocean, St. Elmoâ€™s Fire, etc.  
 
00:53:10 
Came ashore and became a cargo expediter. Worked exclusively for oil companies. Like 
Saudi Petroleum. Difference between what is loaded and what is received. Often saw 
differences between 2000-3000 barrels. Job was to help ensure the measurement and 
tracking of oil was done as per industry standards was done as accurately as possible in 
close conjunction with petroleum inspectors. Supply and demand. When there are fewer 
ships to do the job, price goes up. People went out and ordered ships and prices went 
down.  
 
Container industry is based on concept that moves cargo quickly. Sealand SL7 - 6 day 
service from Seattle to Tokyo. Standard speed was 32 naughts. Burning a lot of fuel. 
Want ships to get to destination quicker. More weight of ship, more fuel used. So to 
compensate, used more smaller ships to get to destination. Same speed, more ships for 
the same job, same amount of time.  
 
01:04:31 
Have dealt with crude, petrochemicals, oil products. If diesel is put in a tank that had 
gasoline before and was not cleaned properly, it could potentially ruin all the diesel. Its 
properties affect the diesel. Design of a tanker - box girder construction. Was there as an 
expert and had to question something if it wasn't right and if it couldn't be corrected there 
and then had ot take it to the higher authority. As an expediter oversaw the operation. Ran 
the petroleum inspection office, became the expert on measuring the cargo and how to do 
it right. Measuring a ship is entirely different from measuring the cargo.  
 
01:09:02 
Company that he worked for had a sister company that was an agency. They needed an 
agent to go to tend the ship. Was doing fine until a sailor had to be repatriated. Dealt a lot 
with agents earlier but this was the first item on the other side of the fence.  
 
01:12:00 
Agency world is one of few industries where a person can come out of high school and 
still pursue a blue collar career and still rise to mgmnt level and earn a decent salary. 
Boarding agent will meet the ship and captain, then go down to customs, pay tonnage 
taxes etc. Ship owners representative on the ground in the port to help that vessel conduct 
its business at port. Industry and has grown and changed. Difference between tankers and 
container ships - containers ships are owned by company and operated by the company 
on a scheduled service very similar to a bus service. Same cities. same routes. Tankers 
and break bulk ships are tramp services. Can go where and when market demands. 
Tankers have chartered brokers. Agent comes in to act as an intermediary.  
 
 
 
Agency 101 - need to give customer what they want, in the form they want it and on the 
sked that they want. That works for any business.  
 
01:20:40 
Industry has diversified. Ship crews are also from all  over the world. Women are in an 
administrative or supportive role. Boarding agents are all men. some women. Tough 
world for a woman to come into. Still a rough business. Language on a ship is very 
coarse and expletives are a plenty. There are sailors who don't know how to sign their 
names, but still managed to earn a good living. It takes unique individuals to be involved 
in the industry.   
 
01:26:32 
one of the requirements for any ship coming into the US is that there has to be someone 
fluent in English. 8-5 jobs are non existent now.  
 
01:32:30 
Present role is tanker operation mgr. It is an evolving role. Train and instruct employees 
of Norton Lily in how tankers work. Revenue generated through liners have been pushed 
down. More involved in marketing in present job role. Need to be ISO certified. 
Reinforced because of incidents like the deep water horizon and various ship accidents. 
Need to have programs in place for checks and balances.  
ISO program was a way to keep information flowing back and forth. Because mngmt is 
supposed to annually review the program and assess the positives and negatives. Need to 
look at big picture but also remember that the supporting agents on the groudn are 
important too. ISO program handles quality managment.  
 
01:39:32 
ISO - international standards of operation. Document on how a company wants its 
business run. ISO helps give a company structure.  
 
01:42:20 
Houston ship channel has played and will cintinue to play a tremendous role in the US 
economy. HSC produces 40-50% of all petroleum products used in the US. Serves a vital 
function not just out Houston but to the rest of the world. Houston has a passenger ship 
terminal at Barbers Cut. People should start to realize that the terminals need to work in 
conjunction and not in opposition and should make Galveston the cruise port, the ports 
need to start thinking bigger.
