 WASHINGTON-HAWAII
 
Left Dulles airport at dawn or damned c
lose to it and f
lew to San Francisco
 
where I neurotically remembered thousands of things I hadn't taken care of
 
before and so called the office to f
ind they had already been  t
one.  Well,
 
it passed the time in the airport.
 
Flew from S
.F. to Honolulu, a strange f
light, they kept trying to make it
 
cheerful and festive but they showed a d rather depressing movie, and the
 
orchids in your drinks
' were small and pitiful and a bit tired and it all
 
seemed rather sad.  Americans really don't know how to be festive; I sympathize
 
with the airlines; it's an uphill struggle.
 
Was greeted and bedizened with leis by Roy Helms, direcot of the Consortium
 
of Pacific Arts and Cultures (
C-PAC), the Endowment regional organization
 
in the Pacific; by Jeff Hackler, director of the Arts Council of Hawaii
 
and past Ex Arts staff member; and Jeff's assistant, Alan Suemori.  They
 
drove me to the Waikikian Hotel, a marvellous place I would recommend to
 
anyone travelling to Hawaii.
 I
t was kind of like living on the set of
 
"Flying Down to Rio'
a
'
 n ancient Fred Astaire film, all tropical jungly paths
 
l
it by flares and little cottage rooms with verandas opening out into the
 
greenery, but if you looked up over your head, there was the xext±cxtxwxllz
 
wfx1kx implacable vertical wall of the Hilton Honolulu or whatever towering above.
 
We had dinner together and I fell into bed around 10:00.

Got i
n an early morning swim before being picked U
I)  by J
eff and Alan and taken
 
to the Kalihi-Palama Culture Center, headed by my old friend Wendell Silva,
 
a Portugues-Hawaiian, and a real talent.  There were approximately 35 people
 
there, including Hawaiians, Portuguese, Puerto Ricans, Japanese, Koreans, Chinese,
 
4 Samoans (
2 talking chiefs and one major cheif), Okinawans, Native Americans
 
txz o
it±o (
an urban coalition mf from various mainland tribes), Filippinos,
 
i
ssorted Anglos and some others I can't at the mm moment recall.
 Bea Ranis and
 
Sarah Richards (
Chairman and Executive Director of the State Foundation on Culture
 
and the Arts) turned up laterand appeared to be interested,
 I spoke
 
and answered questions for about two hours.  Some impressions:
 
a clear state of left-over irritation with a local arts agency ± policies
 
e
specially the State (
prohbbly
 
related to Preis' regime)
 
s
trong emphasis on festivals, e
specially t
ime-centered ones (
Korean F
lag
 
Day, e
tc.).
 I suggested topic-centered festivals as an antidote for the sort of
 
routine here-we-go=again j
qx quality they were describing to me, and the idea seemed
 
to be entertaining.  We'll see what they do
 
overall a really warm reception for the Folk Arts basic i
deas.
 I
t was really
 
tragic that I didn't have brochures to leave with them right then.
 
We also handled a few specifics: among them, the Hawaiian-PortugueseHerjtage
 
Project (
they will be coming in for third year funding; I recommended they s
tart
 
working on private funds to increase their match, hit the SFCA for more dollars,
 
and said I
'd try to get an evaluator to see their fall festival).  We also
 
talked over the possibility of our helping the Puerto Rican string band that will
 
he appearing in Los Angeles in May to extend their tour to Hawaii.
 
I later heard that the Center has not gotten much fiscal support from the State.
 
I hope this is not try
'c.  The Kalihi-Palania people struck me as maintaining an
 
extremely high level of artistic quality.  Though I hadn't time to tour the facility,
 
they had an impressive display of crafts in the corner of our meeting room.  Again,
 
I
 was impressed and moved by the number of ethnic groups that turned out to talk about
 
their culture.  Silva hsxc rtain±yxb e and his staff have certainly been doing a
 
F
irst-class JOT) to get that variety of active participants in
 the Center.

AN 6 continued
 
The afternoon was spent at the B
ishop Museum.
 We first xp Nt met with a group
 
of about eight staff members from various departments including Betty Tatar,
 
the ethnomusicologist who is directing 1
4 the Hawaiian chan rrecord that Folk
 
Arts is funding.   
 
I outlined what
 
Folk Arts was up to, and the B
.P. Museum staff responded in kind, with rather
 
anexpected frankness.  They seem dissatisfied with their own performance
 
i
nstitutionally speaking) and were not shy about saying so.
 Basically, the
 
problem seems to be that the high admission charge keeps the local citizens
 
away; the Museum Board has tried to attract tourists t  rather than reducing
 
cntrance fees, and there has been a big campaign going on to "se l
l" th e Museum

at least one to two yearx projects; they used also to bring in MA and PhD candidates
 
for special study at the University of Hawaii with xpm particular emphasis on

1:30 Jeff picked me up and took me to lunch at the Willows, a lovely old Hawaiian

of Sarah Richards; this gave me a good chance to get acquainted, listen to some
 
of Sarah's problems on taking over after Alfred Preis xd and get in some good
 
l
icks on behalf of a SFAC for Hawaii.  She is friendly, intelligent, interested,

 I think we can too, so we were in pleasant agreement.

At 2

The plane was late, and, because she was travelling on a Canadian passport,
 
thzr
 
she had to go through the "foreigner" customs lines,
 
so we did not get back to the hotel until 4
:30.  The Canadian passport, by the way,
 
gave us difficulties throughout the trip.

all evening; she seemed quite interested
 
in what we were doing but knew relatively l

Most of her work has been with Tongans and Fijiians and the like.
 Both she and
 
Rick expressed doubts about Kim
 
by the way; tk ±xxfxx they seemed to

once she had made up her mind.  fx txtxx
 Both of them had worked with her as
 
a graduate student at U of H

kaxpttx was the same back then.
 Barbara, I think, and Rick will be as much help
 
as they can to the Program.  There is a time constraint but outside of that they
 
were enthusiastic and supportive.

 Bee Ranis

received.  After I left the meeting room, I called 4900 *k._

until Jeff pulled me away to the East-West Center.
 
This was a curious meeting -
- perhaps 20 people, including some scholars (
Barbara
 
Smith was there, I was flattered to see), some community r
pxexeittxti
xx and ethnic
 
representatives, some artists, some general political administrative types.
 I
 
never felt I got the hang of the situation nor could I figure out just who I was
 
talking to or why, but they didn't throw tomatoes.
 I am not sure whether anything
 
will come of this session at all; as Jeff commented, i
t acted to inform but not to
 
inspire (
at least not visibly).
 
After two hours of this, we raced hack to the Honolulu C
lub where Sarah Richards
 
hosted a lunch for me, Corey, Jeff and the Council.
 I was pretty blah by then and
 
mostly ate and listened to the conversation.wkixhxw
z
tty  A missed opportunity.
 
In future trips, I must watch to schedule less tightly and to avoid mixed meetings.
 
Am My worst sessions were those where, like the East-West Center, there were too
 
many different kinds of interests in the audience.
 
We next took off for the Polynesian Culture Center (
sponsored by Brigham Young
 
University) around the other side of the island.
 The
 
facility is extensive and beautifully maintained by corps of students who dance,
 
sing, present, sweep, clean up, and otherwise run the place as far as I could tell.
 
(
I am over-simplifying in the interests of brevity; this is a multi-million dollar
 
operation, I suspect and obviously highly dependent on cheap student labor.
 I
 
expect the students get a lot out of the experience; I spoke to xxmlaxxx many both
 
before and afterward who did.  Still and all, I was not surprised when the d
irector
 
told me they were having difficulties convincing the IRS that they were a non-

e got a fast tour of two of the villages, stopped in to visit with the Hawaiian

The Director, Baden Pere is part Maori from New Zealand, an efficient, somewhat
 
more rigid, Aussie type -

 very smart and obviously highly competent.  They took
 
us to dinner and then to the evening performance.

 HAWAII  "Big i
sland"
 
More budget hassles with the home base before leaving for a  :
OO flight to
 
the big island of Hawaii.  We landed in Hilo, an old whaling port that we didn't
 
have time to look around in, drove right out to the University of Hawaii, Hilo
 
campus where we met with local artists, who had been scheduled in two delegations:
 
Hawaiian, and non-Hawaiian.  This seemed odd to me but things moved so speedily
 
I didn't ever have a chance to enquire why the arrangement and I
've forgotten to
 
ask Jeff since.
 
Frances Sherrard, a Japanese-American lady, Chairman of the East Hawaii Cultural
 
ran the meeting; Dav&d Farmer,
 
University of Hawaii took care of the arrangements.  Only one Hawaiian came for
 
the Hawaii session -
-
 pretty sad -
-
 she was a lovely older lady who apparently
 
teaches various crafts (
lei-making, bits of hula, pandanus weaving etc.) on a
 
craft-by-craft basis in l
ittle dribs and drabs around a various culture centers
 
and schools.
 Little attempt to provide context, just sort of how-to sessions
 
as requested.
 I felt bad for her; it seemed so feeble and she was embarrassed.
 
The Non-Hawaiian session was attended by some 15 contrastive types, mostly Japanese
 
business people, well organized, brisk, in contact with their particular inter-
national associations for bonsai, ikebana, bonsaiki, tea ceremony, whatever.
 
One lady there played k and taught koto, and they have an active samisen group.
 
Mostly they want to do self-promotion activities; they also ex
11xxXX1Rd seemed to
 
want to hire "teachers" from Oahu to come and show them the "right" way, mostly
 
for validation as far as I could tell.  TkXXXXNXx I suggested they seemed in pretty
 
good shape to me, and on the whole they concurred; I doubt we'll hear from them.
 
An Okinawan lady who was there startled me with her vigor and energy; l
ike the
 
r
apaf
lese  the Okinawans appear highly organized, and their local cultural club
 
aets weekly (
though most of what they do appears to be Japanese).
 If I could g have
 
atten her off separately, we might have dug a bit deeper; this was too public to
 
i
scuss what x happened with Okinawan culture in any depth.  Many bows and smiles
 
all round.  A successful buTinconclusive meeting.
 
'
-
Talked\to Biddle, got okay on budget.  Then on to the Volcano Arts Center in the
 
center of the island, part of the National Park System.  Marsha Morrison, a haole
 
director of the lo ca l Volcano
 Art  Association
 
_
_
 
showed us around the arts center (
owned by the Assn. buTt built on Park Service land
 
and hosted lunch.  The Center is largely a gift store cum studio space; mixed con-
temporary and traditional crafts.  Their most interesting (
to me) activity is that
 
that they have st built a dance platform out of lava blocks sort of hidden from
 
the general view that can be used by traditional hula dancers to do their private
 
devotions b9fl
ari
Rzkete or present public programs bHf0rNzReix looking out over Pele.
 
The tadjtiof
lal ferns worn by hula dancers have been planted throughout the area;
 
i
t is accessible yet se
'ded and seemed a very nice idea.  Two traditional old er  
Hawaiian quilters who lunc
hed  with
 us  obviously
 l
iked
 it very mich.
 
I drove back to Hilo with Dennis Keawha, an interesting though feckless young artist
 
who is a tapa cloth expert among other things.  He is dedicated to replicating some
 
of the forgotten arts, and will probably make
 quite a contributi on;  he's
 extremely
 
nice and quit e bright but  allowing
 himself
 to
 be pulled in too  many
 directions.
 
(
Adrienne Koeppler recommends him.)  Th e rest of the afternoon I met with other
 
big island craftspeople and university students, essentially useless except for
 
distributing information.  Corey reported that Jeff wanted me to get the feeling that
 
big island groups are different from Oahu groups and  ad orchestrated the meeting to
 
bring that out.
 I am sure it is quite true.  The folks there seem to feel a bit out of
 
it, a l
ittle old-fashioned and insecure.
 Frankly, that's not a big news i

reached a Hilo MD who said that a gastro-enterologist pal of his was now in residence
 
on Ponape and we could safely wait to have the tests run there.

we landed at Johnston Atoll, which is entirely
 t controlled by the US military
 
who would not allow xxxioxgm the passengers to get off; only a few discouraged

I had tried to make arrangements to stay over
 
so as to comm ence negotiations with the new native governing bodies but had not been

i)c possibly just as well.  Majuro is a long skinny island
 
mostly tk taken up with old army buildings, and most of the village
'  seem to *
-be
 
on other islands in the group.  Getting around would require some advance arrangements
 
and a boat.  We did visit the craft store in the airport briefly; beautiful shell
 
necklaces,a star charts, and absolutely gorgeous basketry.  We should have bought
 
three times what we did but it was so early in the trip, we enuidxtkzxixkxi1 didn't
 
want to use up too much of our money and packing space.

say the Marshalls may well be one of the most productive and imaginative crafts

had to get special tags from the M

Corey and I felt it was notably inferior to the one on Majuro -
-
 lots of piddly
 
s
lightly junky "souvenir" items
-.
 Interestingly, it was run by a Navy Wives Association
 
on behalf of the craftspeople, while the one on Majuro just had two young xx local

sland in an ±1  entirely new location.  Rx For the present, both federal and s
tate
 
offices are in
. Kolonia, often in the same building.
 
We charged out of the airport in a bevy of trucks, headed for the Cliff Rainbow
 
Hotel, a pleasant place reminiscent of the "tourist courts" of my childhood.  We
 
were
iven "the Red Cottage" a single room structure of concrete with a shower;
 
ach cottage was a different color and we were asked to sign chits at the iitri0
 
afe and outdoor bar with our cottage color instead of our names -
-
 easier to keep
 
rack.  Anyway, Corey maintains I walked in the door, lay down o
nxXixxxxxxxxx
 
the bad in full x view of our escorting force, and went to sleep before anyone
 
ould even say goodbye.
 I
t was about 2
:00 p
.m. local time. Corey then went foritih
 
o try to contact the ta Ponapean medical authoritie .only to discover that the
 
Jctor we had been referred to in Hilo had left Ponape on the plane we came in on;
 
2rofessor Siegal and Dr. Pretrick had gone; the Rainbow Hotel's phone was out of
 
order; and, as a matter of fact, all the lines were down in our end of the island.
 
She finally managed to connect with a friendly English-speaking type somewhere who
 
r
ecommended that I go to the Ponape hispotal which she finally contacted by CB
 
s
ince their phone, though on a different l
ine, was also out of whack. When she
 
enquired about a taxi, she was assured there were none but the ambulance would
 
come and get me, so off I went to the Hospital for a hemoglobin test which was
 
most competently and kindly conducted by a Ponapean medical technician.
 
(f
t turned out there were no M
.D.'s available; the only one on island had come
 
in on the same plane we were on and had gone home to sleep, being exhausted;
 
I certainly sympathized.)  Since there was no other way to get back to the Rainbow,
 
Corey and I drove solemnly home in the ambulance again complete with unnecessary
 
instructions 9

in the travel brochures
 
Kolonia is described/sometimes as looking like an old fashioned wild west town -

dusty streetsh bordered by nondescript buildings.  That's about it, but the incredible
 
coloration of the trees, shrubs and more than anything the people make the description
 
pretty off-base for my money.  Maybe it was that I was new to the scene, but I
 
thought the clothes on Ponape were the most gorgeous of our trip.  The ladies, by

I met various federal and state officials very brifly, but had a real sit-down talk
 
with one Yoshivo George, Secretary of the Department of Social Services for the
 
Federated States of Micronesia and thus in charge of education, cultural affairs
 
and all the other activities that might include the arts.  He is a young man who
 
impressed me, during our brief meeting, as i being absolutely outstanding,xNcx
 
fast, bright, interested,
 
and concerned.  We couldn't really nail down anything, since no formal relations are
 
possible, but he seemed extremely interested in my discussion about the possibilities
 
of Rx if a Pacific telstar project, committed definitely to azintexextx±xz
 
being represented in C-PAC, asked to be filled in on the basketry conference in
 
A
laska, etc. etc.
 
I really liked him; I hope he liked me enough so that we can gradually get some
 
projects going, Aitk0X9kzNex0X1
aX0k possibly under MARC's aspices -
- he seemed
 
interested in that and approved of MARC's work.
 
The rest of the m
ning was spent touring the local Comm unity College of Micronesia
 
campus with Dr. Siegel and meeting some of his colleagues, including a visiting
 
professor of Special Educat on from the University of Guam who ,
tu'n  out to have
 
1

him to go through i

be left in an archive such as MARC or the University of Hawaii or someplace more
 
logical than his Michigan ancestral home.  Will write him again to that effect.

Memorandum:  At the hospital, I walked around during one of the  i waiting periods
 
to a sort of open courtyard where there were eighty or so kids and assorted mothers
 
waiting around, apparently, for medical treatment.  Maybe it was innoculation day
 
or something; there surely was a crowd.  Anyway, almost all the kids were playing -
-
a kind of Breughel sight -
-
 ball here, c
lapping gxmjmxXx1k games there, singing circles
 
over yonder, several rounds of jacks using a te lime for a ball and nuts for the
 
jacks -
-
 it really made my mouth water.  This is certainly an area that should he
 
looked into.
 I mentioned the possibility to Siegel and others x ttxtkKc including
 
the educators on Truk, but it was a bit of an advanced notion to them, and probably
 
a mistake on my part.
 I am afraid they couldn't"read" the games and would just
 
mess what is obvioaaly a growthsome situation up.  But i
t would be marvellous fun to
 
l
ook into the games of Ponape...
 
JANUARY 1
3  PONAPE/TRUK
 
Woke early feeling exhausted.  A farewell breakfast t at the Rainbow with Dr.
 
Siegel who has done his living best to be kind and considerate.
 I have to say,
 
though, that the operation in which he is engaged strikes me as the absolute nadir
 
of education for these parts.  Admittedly the CCofM is not going to be MIT, but
 
surely it could attract better factulty and develop a more imaginative and useful
 
curriculum.
 I
t would be better, I believe, if it did not exist; if only the
 
most kx± brilliant and highly motivated high school graduates were sent off-island
 
to the University of Hawaii or to the mainland.  R Opportunities for advanced
 
education should be kip
OApL competitive.  As far as j could tell, relatively few
 
college graduates were needed on the job market'
 
r
'example, s "
  
s
uL
2L on Rota, I believe
ipan, and, for all I know, the Marshalls, many of the
 
elementary school teachers did not have a BA nor did the local law require them to.

Corey and I walked down to the f ingimeringi (
sp?) village to l
ook at the crafts
 
in the "crafts cooperative" thatched building -
- beautiful "trays", half woven,
 
half carved and adorned with cowrie shells; some shell marmars, mobiles of carved
 
wooden fish, carved turtles and sharks (
around 6" to a foot in size), a simply
 
superb carving of a frog catching a fly on his elongated tongue -
- not a large
 
number of categories but each one elegant,xx-Axm no junk, and nicely displayed.
 
The major concession to tourism I saw was a 4 inch star made in the "tray" technique
 
a nice idea, similar to the patches that the Cuna mola-makers construct for quick sale.
 
We also walked through the village which is all thatch houses every sociable whichway,
 
nicely kept up by the ladies who get out and sweep the dirt yards with short twig
 
brooms.  We stopped in at the men's carving shed where they hospitably invited us
 
to set a spell -
- about eight gentlemen ranging in age from 60. to 20 sitting on l
ogs
 
companionably hackigg away.  They were using adzes, pocket knives and rasps, the
 
ground a thi Cc layer of wood chips.
 I liked them enormously, but we were all very
 
shy and didn't say much. Lots of smiles.  The Kapnigimeningi are Polynesian and
 
wear lava-lavas -
- large squares of brilliant cloth -
- scarlet or purple, printed with
 
large white butterfly or flower shapes 9xz90Xgxoxxx sort of wrapped around the body
 
anywhere between the armpits and the waist -
-
 ye 
,,
han some.  At the "end" of the
 
village, a recent grave covered with brilliant
 ornamental sticks -
-
 a kind of
 
incredible flower garden planted into the grave.  We heard later a senior carver had
 
deed some weeks before.  ThRxX±xx  I did not find out exactly why the K
. village exists,
 
why the people came to Ponape :- but got the general feeling that it was basicaljy
 
an economic move -

 and is a b
 out of the way of anywhere, QA-.CQ

Back at the hotel, I began to feel really awful, and Corey rushed forth to see what
 
kind of medical advice I could get: stay in Ponape, go on to Truk as planned, go
 
straight to Guam on the same plane and
 home from there.  While I was flapping about
 
trying with my addled brain to pack, since we were obviously going to have to do
 
something, there was a knock on the door, and in walked Jose Camacho (
the film maker
 
we had funded to do a Po pean film from California, back to do a l
ittle cleanupp work

 som
work with the Kapingimeringis.

and I felt really bad that I hadn't know he was coming nor had he known I was on the
 
island.
 CNrX1
rxexmxzhaxk  Really terrible luck; he could have gotten me together with
 
some real folks instead of the sweet but petty bureaucrats I
'd been stuck with.

-wl;  Camacho said
 
they were planning to film in a distant part of the island in the mangrove
 
swamps requiring about a two hour walk in.
 IAidn't
 think I was up for that
 
so we regretfully decided to go on;  (
if we hapd't we would have had to miss
 
Truk and go straight to Saipan anyway).  Camacho drove us to the airport.
 
Jose
uite impressed me.  He is a Chamorro born in California; he wants eventually
 
to lo ate in Micronesia and likes Ponape the best of Ikx all the islands because
 
i
t is the reallest.  He will stay in California or in Hawaii as long as he is
 
primarily doi working as a film-maker,  He is interested and already involved
 
with the satellite idea,xw xiBx has discussed it with Roy Helms and has a Pacific
 
film and video organization all going.
 I think he even said they were planning
 
a conference.  So I am behind the times again but working in the right direction,
 
so no matter.  Every bit of pushing helps.
 
On to Truk.  A very different island -
-
 less lush, more misty, less colorful;
 
i
t somehow seems dusty even though it '
rained off and on all the time we were here.
 
We took a limousine-bus out to a gorgeous tourist-type hotel -
- big beautiful
 
rooms with lanais, a big beautiful beach, a long way from anywhere in particular.
 
A bunch of local boys got a bit nasty when we
 
didn't want to buy their shells but preferred hunting our own -
-
 the first deterioration
 
of this kind we've seen on the trip.  The folks in Ponapeyinformed me that the folks
 
in Truk were rude.

 RRNKX  TRUK
 
a young man named
 
Corey and I were met yesterday at the airport by/ Larry Bruton, Fine Arts
 
Specialist of the Trukese Department of Education; we spoke only briefly then,
 
but he arrived for breakfast and a lo
chew this morning.
 I
t was a bit
 
depressing.  He is a still photographe
'i
', married to 
L a Trukese lady and they
 
have three children.  He is a go-getter, apparently 5 nvinced the Department
 
of Education that they needed a Fine Arts Specialist and that he was it,  so
 
here he is turning out curricula and talking big-time about things he knows
 
little about.  He pumped me about tourism, what he should make of his job,
 
how to run festivals, how to developm a fine arts curriculum, how to gng
 
get grants, how to teach music -
 you name it.
 
ud
i e zlc
.  He was very hospitable, very confusc , on
'ry n
r
i Hoiu  to s
how H i,
 
frightened and
 -
 Ignorant underneath.
 
Bruton is, I
'm afraid, typical of a lot of the people we've met so far.
 i
ost
 
of the big wheels are in Ikx Washington attending the inaugural, so we see
 
the littler fish, mostly Anglos, mostly 2nd to 3rd rate, not really capable of
 
making it on the mainland but rising to the top in these small puddles.  Thry
 
get lots of perks and pretty good salaries from Tilm little Whatever.  For
 
instance, Mr. Bruton has an"assigned hous e
-'; these are houses that were con-
structed especially for Anglos who could not be expected to survive in nativc
 
housing.  Now that the FSM has taken over and the Trukese are putting more o"
,
 
own into the good jobs, there are more Americans going home and thus noon
 
of the assigned houses available.
 So, Bruton told us, for the first time,
 
Trukese are being allowed to l
ive in these houses - -  but only if they are on
 
department head level 5 C-f
 
Truk seesm overall less beautiful than Ponape.  The people l4e tin roofs for
 
their houses rather than thatch
, ma inta
in ing  that
 thatch
 
'
- -
 scorpions
 
(
but not on Ponape?), and they generally surround their houses with piles of
 
industrial detritus -
-
 rusting cars, piles of tin cans and the like.
 It's
 
pretty clearly a status symbol -
 they have money to have afforded all that
 
junk seems to be the idea.  The people loo  rather Spanish except for the
 
•
 range of skin color from dark to ligh\; they smile
xj t but you can't
 
really tell if they're with you  or  laughing a\ you.
 
Larry Bruton had planned quite a day; I begged off from meeting the l
ieutenant
 
governor (
turned out he wasn't there anyway), but we did visit the Social Action
 
of the Catholic O urch where we hoped to find Father Wenzel, the Mcironesian
 
historical specialist.  Unfortunately he was off-island (
actually on Yap teaching
 
an extension course), but we met Father Fogelsanger, Associate Pastor and
 
Director of Social Action Program.  He is a sweet old gnetleman with Parkinson's,
 
looks very much like Bill, and runs a radio program twice a week amongst other
 
activities.  He thinks Truk music is pretty awful, especially the love songs; took
 
us over to the radio station where  he introduced us to Maide Sounent, an elderly
 
Trukese songwriter who has written 70 songs that he has taught to a young people's
 
chorus he works with at the mission.  Apparently there is much spontaneous group
 
harmony singing.  Mr. Souneng requested we send him an e
l ec tr ic gu itar  an d a tape
 
of American tunes he cou
ld set  lrukes  words to; he apparently thinks Trukese music
 
is pretty bad too (
or said he did; it 1
ras all being interpreted).  My view of the
 
matter was somewhat colored by the Trukese young lady who was running the xl tape
 
machine; she pretty obviously l
iked Trutese secular music, laid hands on the tapes
 
twice as fast as on the religious ones, and gave Corey and me a meaningful eye in
 
several parts of the conversation.
 
We went from there to the Department of Education which was housed
 a large
 
building near the high school.  To Bruton's embarrassment and my r; ief none of
 
the big wheels were around to meet with us, but I did talk with a American
 
girl, Millie Buckea, an antFiro major from North Dakota Universit  married to
 
a Trukese

who Rks is head preservation officer and involved in an oral history collection
 
project; he was off-island  in the Mortlocks )collecting away.  They appear to
 
have no archive, responded with interest when I talked about MARC.  Millie teaches
 
and is a counsellor at the Truk high school; a nice person but very green, I would w

There was a very nasty slogan implying k that if you had any smarts at all, you
 
would know how to speak English hanging in the J

 I
 
found myself m feeling very defeated, and o

lected to ride
 
in the back ofxk his truck on the way to the hotel.  That was apparentlyxNRNxNxi
 
a groovy thing for an old lady like me to do -

 lots of youngsters waved and smiled
 
as we inched ourselves around chasms in the roadway or bounced around corners; and
 
even some of the normally slightly sour,Trukese grinned when they saw me hanging

I fear I shouldn't have made the trip, in terms of the very best possible use of federal

After
  this event, there was a long wai
fr ç the afternoon plane.  During this time I
 
observed that the Trukese Cultural Museum ç
hear the airport) was open.
 I had asked
 
Bruton about it when we came, and he had told me it wasn't openn and probably would never
 
be.
 I rushed over, had a brief chat with the young Tru ese who were manning the rather
 
small exhibit, picked up some of their informational brochures and split.  I was very
 
angry and managed (
I hoped) to convey to Mr. Bruton that, as the arts director (
self-
appointed) of Trukese affairs, he oughtxl:MAR keep a bit au courant as to developments
 
in the "native quarters". During the oourse of this rather embarrassing confrontation
 
between Bruton and me, he mentionned that i
rx hd had heard of a nos r flute player on
 
TxXx Truk.  When I asked why he wasn't using him as an artist-t
hn-schools or recording
 
him or presenting him in some other fashion, he had nothing in particular ix to say except
 
that he had applied to an arts/humanities grants program and, of course, if that came
 
through, all kinds of marvels would be forthcoming.
 I promised to send him info on the
 
upcoming basketry meeting.  We parted.
 I was angry both at him and myself.  Surely there
 
was more to be done on Tymik Truk...
 
c got into Saipan an hour and a half late.
 Kim Bailey met us along with two of her
 
carolinian friends, Frank and Rosa Balbina.
 (
The distinction between Carolinian and
 
Chamorran was to dog our footsteps the entire time we were on Saipan.)  Rosa Balbina
 
x is a weaver and  a jeweller (
bead work mostly).  Kim wo took us all mx to a small
 
Chinese restaurant near our hotel where we talked frenetically for an hour.  She's planned
 
a heavy schedule for us throughe the next days.  To bed at 1

hospital was full of people obviously much sicker than I was; the M

xxkiExt xh±1, as Arts Council
 
Director, was responsible to him, not to her Council, that the Council was only
 
advis ry, and that the Arts Council was governed by a Public Law Number  
 
that said Et the Saipan Government should concern itself with the arts of the
 
Chamorro and the Carolinian (
leaving out all others).
 I remarked mildly that I
 
felt that such a law would be regarded as unconstitutional by our legal eagles
 
and t
hat, though I felt that the Arts Council of Saipan should be second to no one
 
n its concern for Chamorran and Carolinian art forms, they shoulçl also be responsible
 
for Philippino, Chinese, Japanese, etc. arts, and that I was sure \
that that was what
 
the law intended.  We bowed and scraped a lot and ended up shaking\ hands effusively.
 
r
e thought I was perfectly awfu l
, an d th e fee ling  was  mutual, though I do hope that
 
K
im can hang in there somehow , an d may be he can  help.
 
Back we went to the Arts Council where I talked for a while with a Chaniorro l
inguist
 
who was a bit of an inter-cultural madman -
-
 I run into them every once in a while,
 
This one had come to the U
.S. to Arizona and gotten involved with the Hopi and the
 
Navajo and ended up writing an illustrated ±
 ctionary for Navajo speaking Headstarters.
 
He then made his way back to Saipan where he is principal of a high school and w pxmAxxi
 
producing the same kind of book for Chamorro-speakers.  Apparently he is having a real
 
rough time re-acculturating, is desperate to get back to the old U
.S. of A, and wants
 
to do anything that will help him get there.
 I couldn't be much use, since he had
 
nothing real to show me -
-
 none of his works have been published nor does he have copies.
 
I tk next dashed back to the hotel, changed into fancy duds, back to the Arts Council
 
where I was gifted with a beautiful flower mwaramwar and attended a reception opening
 
an exhibit of African xxfilx artifacts belonging to a local Saipanese!  ftabZara Smith
 
(
at Kim's earnest request) had given me a tape of African music suitable to play at
 
this event; I don't think anyone could hear it, but it was a gala social occasion.
 
Afterwards there was a potluck supper and an hour's worth of slides of the Festival
 
of the Pacific Arts in Papua New Guinea (
last year's).  Some time along in here I
 
recorded another half-hour interview with another radio station.
 
The Festival of Native Arts turns out to I have been a major affair, and one that we
 
should have paid much more attention to than we did.  Every Pacific nation was there;
 
every major European and Asian nation sent representatives (
media, at the least);
 
and only Ikm the U
.S. was i
ll-represented, as so often happens.  The slides were indeed
 
impressive -
-
 apparently our small Saipanese delegation showed up pretty well.
 
Back to the hotel, pretty worn out, to get a phone call from the doctor s
aying
 
the technician went home without processing my bldod test and he (
the doc) couldn't
 
find it.  Apparently the technician meant it when he said they only did blood crits
 
on Mondays.  The doc. and I had a long warm chat; he said to go on to Guam.
 
All in all, a mW W tough day.
 I am quoting here from my evening's diary "I don't know
 
or understand the local politics which seem to revolve around the Chamorros and
 
the Carolinians at each others' throats, uniting only in their determinationto to
 
put down the Filipinos and throw out the whites -
-
 known as "expatriates".

Corey is a rock.  She cheers me and does all the things I would fall into febrile tears

 I hope she's having some fun.  Snorkelling was a spell-binder for her, and

Up at 6
:30 for what turned out to be a heavenly day at Rota -
-
 a 45 minute trip
 
in a small plane -
-
 Kim, 9z Corey and me.  We were met at the tiny airport by
 
a large and hospitable delegation, including
 
fxo z aipx xqkoxw the head of the S?re of the e
lderly for the northern Marianas) 
a gentleman who was visiting Rot
the school principal, Rita Enos; the local
 
Field Coordinator for the Agingix Program, a young man named Jerry Calvo; a
 
large enthusiastic young man named Candido Maratita who directs their historic
 
preservation program  and a neurotic but nice Polish lady(married to a Rotan)who
 
i
s Coastal Resour e' Management Coordinator (
likes to snorkel and skin d
ive
 
and is basicall) Vin charge of beaches and fisheries).
 
-
L
 
Kim had not warned us; this
 upposed to be a "relaxing day off", so Corey and
 
I were totally unprepared/and I had to suppress my groans when we were ushered
 
into yet another truck to inspect yet another twenty-odd local sites and sights.
 
Well, it turned out to be the nicest day yet, I think.  All the people were just
 
l
ovely, and Rota turned out to be a lovely place, around 1
500 ± people, all
 
Chamorros except for a few odd-balls like my Polish lady, divided into 18 extended
 
families.  They farm, fish and raise beef cattle, of all
 things.  Most of
 
the people l
ive in th
 
single village on the w le is1an4' -
-
 Songsong (
which means
 
"village" in Chamorro  or along the beach and go into th  interior and/or up
 
the mountains to care  or their Axi herds and gardens øNz hmzwexkzn&x for an
 
hour or
 f
E
'
t ? work, or t
W  camp out up there on weeken\Ts.  They call their
 
cattle, by the way, by blowing on nx conch shells.
 
They seemed to absolutely adore their island, their Chamorroness, and their way
 
of life and were delighted to show us everything including several impressive
 
archaeological sites (
latti stones -
-
 huge mushroom shaped building blocks on
 
which the old buildings used to be erected' and an ancient coral-stone quarry L&
 
very impressive and very solemn.  I
t was clear they felt it was a magical location,
 
and we all behaved quite differently there).  They a
lso took us by the church
 
where they were making preparations for a wedding that was going to happen that
 
evening (
everybody begged us to stay) and it looked l
ike a ball -
-
 all the ladies
 
around weaving palm fronds into tablecloths and decorations, gentlemen# off doing
 
the cooking, apparently.  They said we couldyhave fruit bat.
/if we'd only s
tay.
 
c
stev
 
W
e visited the school -
-
 e
lementary, junior and senior high a
ll together -
-
with the elders happily showing the kids how to make rope with an incredibly ancient
 
old m
2E twisting machine, how to carve, how to weave pandanus, a really l
ovely
 
AIS working just the way it could in a less complicated world.  Everybody just took
 
i
t for granted -
-
 what e
lse would the old folks do but lkxm teach the kids  Ibw could
 
the kids learn without the old folks?  I really l
iked that principal; she was special.
 
They took us to the only big hotel on the island -
-
 a Japanese hotel at one end of
 
the island, very posh and the Chamorrans don't go there except to work.  Apparently
 
they had trouble with a teacher from San Jose State (
William Dusel) who insisted on
 
staying there instead of in Songsong and then wondered why nobody would come see h
im
 
and went home to say the Rotans were unfriendly and cold.  Since then they've not
 
been able to get extension teachers from S
.J. State and the teachers cannot get into
 
the M
.A. Program they need -
-
 the program is limited to 40 pep people and all the
 
places are being taken by candidates from Saipan.  Bess should look into this.
 
I by the way bought some local baskets at the I  i
 hop at the Japanese Hotel -
-
 
I knew they had been mad e by the old ladi es  jus A
 ok5at
.
, and X
iax the move
 
was the most popular one I made since leaving D
.C. -
-
 everybody just beamed, and
 
all the by-standers poked each other and said "Look there, she p
icked our baskets,
 
not the Filipino Ones!"
 
c vowed un dyi ng  friendship and flew back to Saipan in time for a local
 
show of Micronesian music and dance that Kim hxdxsxtxapzfoxzXx was desperate
 
for us to see.
 It had in part been arranged by Pachuco Billy, or whatever his
 
name is -
 the fellow that Kim wants to arrange the apprenticeship for. (We really
 
wanted to stay for the wedding, but it seemed too chancy; if the weather got
 
bad and we couldn't get back to Saipan the next day, the whok scheduled would
 
have x been thrown.) Anyway, the show was worth it.  Most of it struk me as
 
phony Tahitian hula -
-
 the powwow style of the Pacific, I began to feel -
-
but there were two extraordinary groups trained by Mr. Billy that did marches
 
from Palau and the Morlocks (
an island group in the Trukese chain).  The latter
 
were especially splendid, unique in all my experience -
-
 funny, subtle, complicated,
 
satiric, cross-rhythmed -
-
 really mad stuff.
 It must get filmed.
 I asked Kim
 
abnut it and the idea had apparently not occurred to her.  She is awfully specializcd
 
in her
 
The show was at the Grand Hotel, attended by Japanese tourists, basically.
 
The Japanese tours are a fascinating phenomenon and should be looked at carefully
 
faxxpoxxik as possible support mechanisms.  They are highly disciplined, arranged
 
well ahead of time, and everywhere we went we would see organized controlled
 
groups of Japanese arriving, getting on and off busses, going in and out of
 
hotels, watching shows, swimming departing, buying in approved gift stores.
 
They come all this way and I imag4ne spend lots of dough to see the Pacific world,
 
and I would imagine they could b  scheduled into supporting activities beneficial
 
to traditional dancers, musician* and craftspeople, if the right buttons could be
 
punched.

JANUARY 18  SAIPAN/GUAM
 
Got up at 6
:30 and dragged myself down to the ocean f
e  a swim -
 a disciplinary
 
process and a bit of a chore but I was determined to get in one swim before we
 
l
eft Saipan.
 Back in the room, Corey and & I ordered coffee, packed, and went
 
down at 9
:30 to talk with Eliisa, the Finnish arts (
crafts) administrator at the
 
Arts Council, who is elderly, hard-working, consc entious and had her feelings
 
hurt because I was spending all my time with Kim
 Kim arrived with others, and
 
suddenly we were all sitting at a long brunch tile -
-
 a totally ill-assorted
 
crew assembled by Kim whc
1aer explained to me
 "they were all Carolinians!"
 
which was apparently the' T
hasis  on which they were assembled.  For me it was a
 
bit of a nightmare -
-
 I was trying to talk simultaneously with a sweet but pitiful
 
young "artist" who made hangings out of driftwood and shells; a tough-minded
 
woman legislator-politico; her grant-seeking Palauan husband who just wanted to
 
find the right spigot to turn on; their bad-mannered little boy who raised hell
 
all over the hotel; two American expatriate arts executives who run arts festivals;
 
and several others I never got straight.
 
I spent a4qJ1O
W frustrating two hours trying to talk to all these people about
 
whatever was on their minds simultaneously
 Never again.  The next place I go
 
I shall insist upon one meeting at which I get at least 30 minutes all by myself
 
to explain what it is Folk Arts does and why we do it, and then let the sky fall
 
if it wants to.  This Saipan Visit (
except for Rota) has been o
nO W00d o frustrating
 
V O N and I
'm tired and started to cry right in the middle of breakfast.  Corey
 
covered while I made it to the ladies.  Afterwards Kim drove us to five or six
 
41f rwa dx
 different houses to "meet with artists", the element she felt had
 
been neglected in planning my schedule.
 It was pretty wiaL
.-- we had to make the
 
airport, butAwe charged up hill and down dale, occasionally stoppi ng  an d interrupt
ing  
people in the middle of their Sunday morning acitities to shake hands; I met the
 
last "artist" at the airport -
-
 Dr. Pecj( a darling old gentleman who really writes
 
poems. xNxxxAe
It turns out he speaks no Chamorran or Carolinian -
-
 why Folk Arts
 
funded that project is pretty unclearO therefore, I shall try to get his grant
 
transferred to Literature before Council.  He's a damn good poet, I think and I am
 
sure worked from good translations; however, it does seem more their baby than ours
 
Kim's grant proposal turns out not to be at all what I had envisioned nor, I believe,
 
the panel either.
 I shall discuss the whole business with Dan and get him to work
 
on recasting the project.
 Incidentally, Kim turns out to have a 3 month old daughter,
 
she mentioned casually on the way to the airport.  At the airport, in addition to
 
Dr. Peck, Anna Teregayo turned up with
ome farewell presents, also Elissa, also
 
the Carolinian "artist" who gave us a driftwood hanging.  We finally ended up rune i
lu;
 
for the plane; didn't think we would make it.
 
We were met at Guam by a blessedly calm Sister Callista who took one l
ook a
t me and
 
took us to the hotel and announce
d th at she was  pretty busy herself but would meet
 
us the next morning for breakfast.  Lovely.  Heavenly, in fact.  Ate a quiet supper,
 
watched about fifteen minutes of local television (
a B
.B.C, opera, believe i
t or not)
 
and went to bed.
 
January 19.  GUAM
 
Had breakfast in the hotel with Sister Mary Callista and her o
lder sister
 
"Annie" who she says helped the family survive during the Japanese occupation.
 
"Annie" is lively and has all her marbles, a little creaky, but full of beans,
 
on the whole, reminds me much of Shirley.  We set forth after eating on a day-long
 
tour of the island in an air-conditioned car (
Sister Callista, Annie, Corey,
 
Callista's assistant  
,  and I
.
 I
t was a heavenly sort of normal thing
 
to do, cool, comfortable,unstrenuous, lady-like.
 I went to s
leep twice on the
 
front seat while Sister Callista drove and murmured polite things about the landscape.
 
We saw three projects.  The first was Inrajan Village -
-
 a walk-through facility
 
n by an Irish priest named Father Thomas Devine.
 I
t was before hours, so no-one
 
s there and this made have made it seem a bit more phony than it xh
± xk x
 
ght have been; I worried, though, about the number of xixxmpkaxxx speakers I
 
w hidden in the shrubbery.  When I asked what they were for, it turns out that
 
the old folks l
ike modern music, so we keep things swinging pretty much all day long".
 
J
erk.
 I did not like that priest, though I suppose
,
L
.
 J1
 he never
 
intended to find himself out in the middle of the Pacific, trying to learn Chamorro.
 
1
kexexw r z  The facility was a kind of walk-through place from crafts facility to
 
craft facility -
-
 first a coconut weaving place, thenX a cooking hut, then a this,
 
then a that -
-
 apparently there are old people manning and womanning the place who
 
explain what's going pon but I didn't see any of that. Maybe with people there it
 
would be terrific, but I didn't really like it the way it was.
 
Then we went on to my favorite place in Guam -
-
 Y Linala Chamorro (
The Life of the
 
Chamorro People) run by the Chamorro Cultural Association of Merizo, a small town
 
on the east end of the island, I think.  TkxxxtUR The site is briefly marked, but
 
we were met by a whole delegation of Guamanian cub scouts, all rigidly drawn to
 
attention when they saw us, saluting feverishly.  They pointed the way down a country
 
road at the end of which we emerged into an open space filled with casual palm
 
roofed huts, some of them obviously private, others for public use.  There must have
 
been thirty elders there, old women and old men, all doing their various things -
-
making baskets, building a lime kiln, boiling sea water to get salt, weaving nets, -
cooking, drinking, chewing betel, kidding each other.
 I liked it all enormously,
 
and obviously the old folks did too because they told me they come every day and
 
stay all day mostly because it's so much fun. Schoolx classes come in to learn,
 
and some of the children come back regularly.  They fed me betel with pepper leaf
 
and everybody laughed when I thou
t Jt was bitter and spit it out, and gave
 me  tuba 
(
coconut sap).  This was first da
f
f fit for babies; second day tuha is for grownups
 
and third day tuba is I
cig vinegar.  There was a marvellous ten year old boy there who
 
showed me with enormous pride the lunch bag he had made weaving palm leaf.
 It was the
 
best piece there, and when I left I made the terrible gaffe of offering to buy it.
 
He froze, and so did I
, and all the old folks stood around saying "Give it to her, boy",
 
so he did, and it was a moment of a little death.
 I finally reached into my purse
 
and he cried in agony, "No, no!" and, fortunately I had one corn shuck doll figure
 
left, so I told him this was a gift from
 Appalachian
 
craftsn
 to a Guamanian craftsman, and we bowed and smiled and exchanged addresses
 
and I hope it was all right.
 It was a tricky moment, and made me realize how little
 
we (
in the U
.S. itself) have to give people.  Wherever I have gone on this trip, I
 
have been showered with gifts, and I have had so little to give in return.  Furthermore,
 
when people come to see me in my office, I have nothing to give them except a Folk
 
Arts brochure.  Maybe I should work something up -
-
 an Indian something maybe -
-
corn necklaces might work?
 
C
.
 
The third project was downright pitiful -
-
 a coconut •useuin/designed and directed
 
by five local ladies who are experimenting with how man
 :
kigx things can be made
 
out of coconut.  Since they're making it all up thems lves  it's pretty awful;  I
 
tried to point out tactfully that they didn't have to experiment so much, that there
 
were lots of people around who could make all kinds of wonderful things out of
 
coconut fibre, leaves, nuts, milk, who knows what-all.
 I suggested also that t if
 
they got in touch with MARC, someone might help them work up a map showing how the
 
coconut spread across Micronesia.  But I have an awful feeling that what they really
 
WR want to do is make fringy hats and 4100 011p.tourist-trap items
J
 
They did feel us a marvellous lunch, rather Puerto Rican in style -
 lots of achi te.
 
Then we drove to MARC -
 at the other end of the island.  The teachers strike has
 
affected the University also, and Dirk Ballendorf was Apo wmaM W completely tied up.
 
We talked with the staff (
mostly volunteer, I think, but
 
obviously highly competent) and Dirk came later to the hotel to talk ç He is f
liCC,
 
straightforward, harried.
 I liked him immensely.  We will breakfast th: n ii n
 
we leave for Palau and he will take us to the a
irport.
 
JANUARY 20  GUAM
 
Donna, Sister Ca 1 sta's chief cook-and-bottle--washer)picked us up after breakfast.
 
I had had a swi
 esterday afternoon before I met with Dirk at the hotel, so I didn
 
thave the intestinal fortitude to venture out early this morning.  There is a long
  
daunting flight of steps to the beach from this hotel, and the snorkelling is only so-so.
 
Donna drove us to the Arts Council where we met with Sister and talked NEA and Folk
 
Arts and other administrative problems.  Joyce Bamba turned up and looked over some
 
grant applications.  Sister was very unforthcoming; she holds information tightly.
 
We all went to a Japanese place for lunch, very pleasant, but still tense somehow.
 
Then Sister took us on a round of ceremonial visits that were obviously of great
 
importance to her.  We first went to the office of the Speaker of the House, where
 
we met with several other representatives (
cf. attached list).  The head of the
 
---
ltural committee
 Senator Kasperbauer, was much exercised over the failure of
 
i  - 
the United States authorities to pay attention to the South Pacific Arts Festival
 
in Papua New Guinea last year.  Not only did we not give fiscal support to U
.S. groups
 
attending and participating in the festival, but the U
.S. A
nibaassador offered no
 
assistance to the groups that did manage to get there, no hospitality, no cordiality;
 
i
n fact, the R U
.X. ambassador didn't even attend the events.  She also pointed out
 
utterly that there was no media coverage, contrasting with heavy media attention
 
from Europe and the Far East.  All this adds to the impression that is general throughout
 
the Pacific that Kissinger lives.  She was one mad lady, and I didn't blame her.
 
We went from there to the Governor's mansion, and also to a few additional governmental
 
offices.  Sister Callista is clearly deeply troubled by the teachers strike, and has
 
Aam done everything in her power to prevent us from seeing the picket lines or otherwise
 
coming to grips with that particular problem.  When we've talked about it she'd said
 
that the trouble has been brought about by off-islanders, that the idea of a strike
 
was culturally foreign to Chamorros.  Maybe she's right.  Anyway, it's made for a
 
tense visit.
 
The evening was spent at a local resta 'ant where the Insular Arts Council was meeting
 
for supper and the normal conduct of
 business.
 It was a made idea, and did not
 
work at all well.  The Council was a not especially interesting bunch, and the meeting
 
was impossible because no one could hear anybody else, especially me (
I'm getting
 
distinctly deafer and must check this when I
'm home).
 I became very slightly rude,
 
almost weepy, took a half a tranquil pill and got through, but learned little.
 
/
 
Donna drove us home and spilled a number of interesting beans.  For one thing Sister
 
Callista and the Arts Council have now spent øfzt
ix all of their dollars for the
 
fiscal year.
 (
Sister had said at th e f meeting in the A
.M. th t she was not only going
 
after Folk Arts but Expansion Arts, De ign Arts and Inter Arts also, a new development
 
i
n terms of our previous talks).  Donna
 a lso  sa id the Insu 4iArts Council had given
 
out
' about 30 grants last year, divided equally (
approximately) between group and
 
i
ndividual grants.  Therefore their grants must be really large in state grant terms,
 
e
specially to individuals.  Thirdly, they can no longer give direct grants.  Each grant
 
goes out in the form of a contract and following through on the terms of the contract
 
takes up almost all their staff time.  They have to sit down with each individual artist
 
and check x out his eppenditures, xi c salary draws, etc...
 
I went to bed feeling mmotionally p
'retty battered -
-
 it seems as though t
've worked
 
' 
so hard and accomplished so little.  The herrible fact about this whole area is the
 
F 
second-classness of everybody.
 I ghess the final straw was at the end of the evening
 
when Sister C
. told me that Mr. Arnou (
sp?), the director of the Marizu project, was
 
going to Anchora
as a weaver/net maker.  He has Just returned from 20 years in
 
Washington D
.C. as an aide to a Micronesian senator and is no more of a cfaftsman than I
.

Dan Baker, husband/ of Clothilde who directs hi-lingual studies and wrote a w rather
 
pitiful song book/  Clothilde had apparently had an appointment to talk with
 
me during the afternoon, but Sister Callista told her I was too busy and fobbed
 
her off with Corey, who went like an innocent lamb to the slaughter not knowing
 
any of this.  Corey reported Clothilde was very angry, also busy with the school
 
strike.
 It turns out Clothilde wants to put out songbooks, collect songs, do
 
dance interpretations, transcribe her material including writing up the cultural
 
and historical implications and make all this stuff available to teachers.  Wants
 
to comp
 a bunch
 Chamorro legends and write musical plays based on them,
 
Etc. etc.  Corey xr[

 Pretty sad stuff, Tm afraid, from the samples of her work.
 
JANUARY 2

/
 
Woke feeling much max more cheerful.
 I got a little more rest in Guam and began
 
to realize this morning that I had been up ag (nst some really difficult factors
 
on this particular island.  The politics are 4retty Byzantine; there is much too
 
much money around, and far too little
 These folks have been trashed
 
by the Spanish, the Germans, the Japanese and the U
.S.
j -- and I
've only just
 
begun to realize what a critical factor this is -
-
 the weather.  These peoples
 
lives just get blown away regularlyx by typhoons.  At the governor's affi mansion
 
yesterday, we were reverently shown "historical photographs" of buildings that
 
couldn't have been taken earlier than post-World War I
I -
-
 the 50's anyway.
 
Relics of t
he War are rare; pre-war mementoes hardly exist.

Anyway, Corey and I wished each other a happy bir t
hiay, packed, had breakfast and
 
a nice chat with Dirk Ballendorf who drove x uy o the airport where we took off
 
for Palau.  Dirk wants to enlarge his Center
  a real archive where he can keep
 
photographs and recordings as well as hist
ical dicuments.  He seems very respected
 
throughout the islands; I
've made a point to ask whether or not people thought
 
enlarging MARC as a study center was a good A idea, and got unanimous agreement,
 
with many people commenting favorably on Dirk himself as a good man and xxxx honest
 
scholar.  He is lxxxm a tense fellow, moves fast for these islands, is probably in
 
his late forties or early fifties and clearly committed to Micronesia.  A historian
 
cum sociologist, hmi and obviously a good administrator.  There is a distinct chill
 
between him and sister CallistaO and his institute is not part of the University of
 
Guam -
-
 sits on the land, but is not of it.
 Still and all, during the teachers
 
s
trike, he was off meeting with the president, so there is some relationship there.
 
couldn't find out why this particular prophet was liked on every island but his own;
 
he only piece of gt
hssip I picked up was that he had come to MARC from the Micronesian
 
:
ommunity College on Rxixxxxkm Ponape where he had been president and run afoul of
 
the board.  Anyway, I liked him very much.

t but decided against; neither of us liked betel, and we were not sure of the
 
propriety of taking them along as gifts, though many on the x plane said they brought
 
them in for the purpose.
 Betel must not grow as luxuriantly on Palau.  Yap seemed
 
dusty, flattish, and thexexw x we saw no people (
totally opposite to Ponape), no houses
 
naxzth zxi p xt only a dirt road we could walk down to see the remains of a crashed
 
Japanese Zero.  Clearly, the Yapese action must be e
lsewhere than the airport.
 
No one met us in Palau, so we took the hotel bus to the hotel.  Sadly enough,  i
t
 
turned out there was a strike of hotel workers demonstrating as we turned in.  Since
 
we only had a day and a half there, xx Corey and I considered the situation and decided
 
not to take a stand; we had no idea where else we could stay.
 I
t turned out we were
 
probably smart -
 there is only one other hotel on the island.  While we were unpacking
 
a Ja anese gentleman turned up whose name was Tatsuo Kamingaksang.  Apparently he had
 
gone to the airport to meet us, but we m hadn't known he was coming and he was late.
 
Mr .

I
,-Tatsuo (
as he suggested we call him) was a local businessman, father of Ted
 
Kwiiingaksang, the fellow who is a film maker in San Francisco that I never could reach
 
before I left (

I finally told him I was just too tired to be very sociable4 and he depar
'ted.
 
Corey and I napped, took a long leisurely snorkel in the mangrove lagoon near
 
the hotel.  Bottom was yucky, but the fish were absolutely gorgeous, and plentiful.
 
I xxdRxx:tx discovered later we could have taken a hotel boat out to an island
 
with a beach, but we enjoyed ourselves where we were.  Caine back up, and treated
 
ourselves to two martinis, the first since November 12 or whenever I got sick.
 
Enjoyed them thvroughly.  We had a long pleasant relaxed chat on the veranda;
 
Corey had brought along a can of nuts from Hawaii for an appetizer, a delicious
 
dinner in the hot 1 (
to which Corey insisted on treating me), and spent the
 
evening making ou  various lists.  We have lots to do in these last few days
 
together -
-
 shopping, post cards, comparison of our diaries.
 But today was
 
really lovely, a great birthday, complete with a funny card from Corey and a
 
l
itle bag; I I
F gave her the glove l
iners and a little purse.  Much love between
 
us; she is a great person.  Now we must s
tart planning for our 40/65 anniversary
 
t we've five years to think that one out!
 
ANUARY 22  PALAe
 
Our only full day on Palau, and i
t was complicated beyond all understanding.  Part
 
of it is that Corey and I are getting just plain worn out; my antennae wibble when
 
they should wobble, I keep forgetting things, I talk too much or not enough; I
'm
 
just out of my usual ability to cope.
 
And today was unbelieveably complicated.  bV Tat sui appeared at breakfast determined
 
to arrange our day.  He announced that he had laid all the necessary groundwork
 
put us in his car and drove us firmly, to the Community €x Action Agency to meet
 
with Kathy Kesolei
 many people ahead of time as the most
 
important cultural
 worker on the island).  He also got us there exactly one hour,
 
late  explaining to me all the time that this was Pal auan
 time . He dro pp ed us  off
 
and went on his way, before ascertaining that Kathy had only 15 minutes to give us,
 
had to go, but wq

I told her despe ately everything I knew in 15 pdnutees' (
a tactical error, I
'm sure
 
but I figured I ouldn't see her again), and
 rranged a ride for us up to the
 
Palauan Museum b fore our 10:00 a
.m. appointment with Moses Sam.
 I
t was a long way
 
to the Museum an  it was xx±g raining like stink.  Our  driver  droppe
d us  off ; there  
was no one but a  attendant at the museum.  We looked around for a bit, then called
 
a taxi to get ba k to the governor's h
.q. to meet with Moses Sam.  Moses Sam tx e
 
at 4
o n the fist ict Historic Preservation Officer; more importantly, he was also
 
the director of t e inaugural proceedings at which (
in two short weeks) the first
 
President of the  ew Republic of Belau would be installed.
 It's planned to be a week

He was busy as a
ll get out, working away with two phones at a table in the middle
 
of a large ware-house type of room, full of desks and phones and hurrying people.
 
I
t also turned out that Tina Rehuher, the Palau Museum Director, is Mr. Sam's
 
deputy director for the inauguration, which was why we didn't see her at the Museum.
 
While we were trying to get all this sorted out and have at least a brief conversation
 
with Moses and Tina, yet another element entered the scene: Ted Kamingaksang's
 
cousin, a young female hippy type who said Ted had written her to take the day off
 
work and entertain us, conducting us anywhere we wanted to go.  Mr. Tatsuo arrived
 
at that point, to see if we were behaving ourselves, and it was obvious that neither
 
he nor the Moses Sam contingent l
iked her.  Here name was Rena I
luches; she was a
 
sweet kid, chewed betel all the time, and acted just exactly like NxNxy a drop-out
 
from a California Community College, which was what she was.
 
I got the feeling we were in the middle of some sort of c(an fight -
-
 with none of
 
the three contingents speaking very much to each other.
 split and went with
 
Rena driving us around to various gift shops (
which are the back's of people's houses
 
or sections in small grocery stores in Palau) to try to help us catch up on our
 
shopping; then to lunch with Tina Rehuher.  We invited -
bf
t to stay but she said she'd
 
better not; when I urged, she said she knew more than I did about the situation.  So
 
off she went in her bare feet, and we lunched with Tina who is a very bright young
 
lady and I expect a pretty competent museum director A She has several major concerns
 
for the museum -
-
 mostly training.  She needs professional training for her museum
 
curator in conseryationt
ecropical conditions, and she needs library training for
 
her l
ibrarian.  Later discussion with Dirk and Bishop Museum folks Indicate that
 
there are no appropriate courses; the Museum used to give training workshops but no
 
longer does.  Most people seemed to feel lkt kkx that the best tactic is to send
 
somebody in to see what the situation is locally, and to help people utilize their
 
own resources rather than send the student out for training in operations he might not
 
be able to mount upon returning home.
 Bess should follow through on this.

I
 
Rena reappeared and took us to the Department of Education, where I met with
 
Romana Anastacio, coordinator of bi
 
good tough talk, I think.  She dea
 
thought the idea of a course on t
 music and dance was good; I suggested
 
pretty upfront tha
 didn't think these particular folks were qualified, and
 
that we could get m.
 i
tch better professors if that was what they needed, or
 
maybe they could just ask for funding for their own local dance organizations
 
if that was what they needed.  We also discussed filming the inaugural, and she
 
wil
t me in touch with their l
ocal film man.  Good session.
 
Rena
 
inx then drove us back to the hotel where she said forlornly that she had wanted
 
to take us to spend a day at her house and see what real Palauan village life was
 
like.  We swore somewhat lamely that we would do it next time.
 I felt very sorry
 
for her and very much that Corey and I should have run away with her for some k
ind
 
of crazy adventure instead of sticking to all the business types -
-
 but I guess
 
you have to have just a little energy to feel adventurous.  So she drove away after
 
we had thanked her many times, and we settled down to wait for Kathy, who finally
 
came two hours late (
6;30) accompanied by six other people, so that conversation
 
was really rough.
 I was a little irritated -
-
 we were sitting on the bar balcony
 
in the dark with the jukebox booming our third-rate disco behind us, and I couldn't
 
hear,  MdxtkeRz
KN1
 and I was still feeling bad that I hadn't handled the Rena
 
complication better.
 
Also,
 agxfoxx were brought a note at 6
:00 that Mr. Tatsuo would pick us
 
up for dinner at kRxi f
t 6
:30, no ifs, ands or buts.  Corey and Iwho had planned
 
a quiet dinner and early bed were
 LU; irritated.  He arrived in the middl e of
 
our conference (
so_ called) with Kathy and her buddies, so that we had to hurry that
 
L
d e
-
up, and still managed to keep him waiting.  He then drove us to a restaurant where
 
his wife was sitting a
ta table absolutely mounded with food (
most of it gotten cold;
 
we had no idea we were holding up his party, or even that that was the way he had
 
arranged it).  Mrs. Tatsuo Xx turned out to be  a Georgia cracker, as she merrily
 
explained herself, who had met her husband at a Seventh Day Adventist College
,
 f
 
so of course they couldn't eat any of this stuff -
_
 they had ordered crab, squid and
 
God knows what else -

 being vegetarians.  So Corey an  -
I had to sit there making

JANUARY 23  PALAU/GUAM/HAWAII
 
This
$ the last day of the "real" trip.  We bussed down to the airport with a
 
large contingent of Japanese tourists who had been staying at the hotel with us.
 
At the airport, ran into Romana Anastacio, the education lady (
coordinator of
 
bi-lingual education) who was escorting a geologist faculty member from San Jose
 
State/  He had been doing an extension course for Palauan teachers, and had been
 
on the island for six weeks -
-
 his second stay, I believe.
 I disliked him almost
 
instantly; he seemed to me crude and rude,
 devoted to the
 
rk ± superiority of western knowledge
civilization, you name it.  He wasn't actively
 
offensive, but I sure was underwhelmed;
 Ms. Anastaclo had it a l
l over
 him in terms
 
of sophist cation.
 (Honesty compel s me
 to admit that he might possibly have taken
 
as instant a dislike to me as I did to him; we flew out on the same plane, but
 
neither sought to sit together nor x±x1  keep in touch during the subsequent transfers.)
 
-
- 
\u
 
We had the obligatory thirty-minu te stopover
 in Yap.  
Th is time
 Corey sta ed on board
 
and I explored down the road a piece, tried to get back early to the  Iane and was
 
stopped firmly but gently by an enormous (
at least 6 and a half foyt tall) Yapese
 
policeman in an impeccable uniform, with a huge Afro topped by a
,'mnilitary uniform
 
visored hat, and his teeth and gums brilliant witkz e1ej red from betel).
 I
t was
 
a strangely unsettling experience, and I didn't dispute with him one bit.
 
We flew on into Guam, and there, at the a
irport, was KNxX Dirk Ballendorf, all full
 
of interest as to what we had found, and introducing us to all and sundry passing by.
 
Apparently, in this isolate xxxx island-hopping area, mush of your business is done
 
at airports.  During our conversation, he darted into the crowd and emerged towing
 
Father Wenzel, the Micronesian historian whom we had missed on Truk.  He and I actually
 
got all of fifteen minutes together, during which he told me that he had decided that
 
in future when film crew5approached him, he was going to say that he would cooperate
 
only if there was an appropriate quid pro quo arrangement.  Tkxy "They at least ought
 
to do some training", he informed me, "teach a course in something, sit around and
 
discuss issues of alternate energy resources, or describe various systems of parliamentary
 
democracy, or something". Oh wow.  He is tall, thin, intense, committed to the area,
 
and very busy; he bounded off right away, but we clasped hands and swore we'd kee½
 
in touch.
 I will send him some things to chew over when I get back.
 
Dirk has apparently been trying to get Kathy Kesolai (
Director of Palau Community Action
 
Agency) to do some additional study outside Palau; he thinks she might be the key
 
person.  He was disappointed that I had had so l
ittle time for a serious talk with
 
her -
-
 damn that kindly interfering gentleman, Mr. Tatsuo -
-
 but we will keep on movino.
 
ave written her especially.
 
extraoridnarily nice guy,
 
rk left, and Corey and I caught the plane for Hawaii, where we were met by the
 
indefatigable Jeff Hackler.  Realty, Jeff is anm
 but I am worried
 
that he spends so much time meeting planes; he should get his charming young assistant
 
Alan Suemori, to do some of it. He took us back to the Waikikian, where we spent the
 
relaxing, running into old friends who had arrived for the C
-PAC meeting and
 
the Crafts Task Froce, and doing a bit of Hawaiian shopping.
 
That evening the State Foundation on Culture and the Arts (
Hawaii Arts Council) and
 
C
-PAC invited us to a specially arranged dinner at The Willows, an old Hawaiian mansion
 
renovated into a really elegant restaurant.  Apparently, it's the place where old
 
Hawaii turns out.  We wxx (
being C-PAC members, Crafts Task Froce Members, Arts Council
 
members -
-
 about fifty to seventy people, were regaled with 11
ij.
 
an elegant Hawaiian luau dinner -
 better than I had expected, followed by a hula
 
performance from a l
ocal school.
 I think the dancing was traditional, or pretty c
lose;
 
very interesting.  A young man started off the proceedings, making a rather elaborite
 
apology that, because of various things beyond his control, there was no second
 
singer of the proper type and status to welcome us officially, so he would have to
 
take on both roles.
 I didn't quite follow this, but Kamaki (
back at home) questioned
 
me closely on this point -
-
 how many male singers were there, where did they stand,
 
who sang which etc., so apparently it was a serious matter of etiquette.
 
After he sang (
unaccompanied) three young women paced in, all wearing hula costume
 
with fresh green leaves and grasses around their heads, wrists and ankles; this is
 
also apparently an important point, signifying certain religious conditions. Tkxy
 
Two of them had drums, one a kind of rattle; they sat on the floor and sang and
 
drummed, mostly x
i&tNxJ x L+N, with about twenty young xx women dancers danging
 
in a sort of s
lightly military formation in front of them.

All dancers danced the same moves in unison, never touching.  My sense was that

 four moves repeated etc.
 (
Probably the

 strong hip swings from side to side

dance.
 
•
,' overall, a solemn, ritual atmosphere; the
 
singer had told us to begin with that this dance depicted a particular journey made
 
by Pele.
 
I must say I was impressed.  This seemed much more l
ike at least a forthright attempt
 
at the "real thing", whatever that is th ese  days than  th e fran kl y secularAcheerful
 
Tahitian hula.  Th
 e hula development that I heard
 on all sides is that male hula
 
is now being revi

and everybody is

 I didn/t see any, though.
 
JANUARY 24  HAWAII
 
This day is a kind of blank in my mind.
 I had stopped my diary as of the last day
 
in Palau, and yesterday was such a doozer -
-
 talk about culture shock -
-
 Palau,
 
Yap, Guam, and a formal Hawaiian banquet all in one day -
-
 I may never recover.
 
Slept late,a left Corey to relaz on the Waikikian Beach and dutifully took a taxi
 
over to the Crafts Task Force meeting around 11:30.  Arrived to find it under way,
 
with those damn sheets of butcher paper all over the walls, and everybody busily
 
underlining
 7a n
 - in purple and scarlet and green penteix inks.
 I foun d it so  
revolting t
simply x went out in the courtyard and sat in th e sun  where  -
-
 
surprise! -
mber of people found me.
 
Talked with Rix Pua Van Dorpe from Maui; she i
s a nicely-off,poetic lady who decided
 
all on her own to re-invent how to make Hawaiian tapa cloth.
 (
According to her it
 
is different than other Pacific people's tapa cloth; I expect she is right but have
 
no knowledge of the area.)  Since her children were in school and her husband is
 
in business, she had the time and the support to start forth on her own, and, I must
 
say to her very great credit, she decided right from the beginning to keep track of
 
exactly what she did in each experiment.  She showed me.  Book x
ici after book after
 
bookkk px each page outlining another attempt.  She said it took at least 1000 plus
 
kwx blows to exam get the bark softened down enough to begin to experiment, each
 
time.
 She has pictures, and samples.  Obviously she's devoted the last three years
 
of her life to this enterprise, and she's just as intense about it now as she must
 
have been to take it on at the beginning.  Remarkable, what human beings can
 x and will d
c
 
She pretty clearly doesn't need money; she did want support to go to some island
 
down around Tonga to live for six months (
the length of time between ship visits)
 
and work with a traditional Tongan tapa ma  
.4r.  Actually what she needed was encouragement
 
rather than support in the fiscal sense .(
,jdon't know what she ought to do.  Ab out  
the most helpful suggestio n I was  able to
ake was that she ought to date her experiments,
 
an observation that she greeted with awe, like some word from the Mount.  Heck, she's
 
nice lady and hipped on tapa cloth making, and I do wish her very well indeed.
 
have written her from home and hope it helps.
 
I also had a long affectionate chat with Edna Ryan, the improbably named chair of the
 
Portuguese Cultural Society.  She is a dear, and so was the lady w she had with her
 
(
name not n oted down, unfortunately .  Their festival seems to be coming along, in terms
 
of enthusiasm and participation.  What I can't tell is the quality of it; I do indeed
 
wish there was some way that I could get some real expertise to bear ± on this situation.
 
(
Mem. should discuss with Richard.)
 
I just plain snuck out after a while and went on back to the hotel, where Corey and
 
I re-organized, re-made lists, wpnt 3hll .i g, agreed to rent a car for the following
 
day and really take off for a m4-or spree, and otherwise amused ourselves.  Early to bed.
 
JANUARY 2
5
 HAWAII R (
Nonolulu)
 
'I
n
 
Got up early and breakfasqed by myself while trying to make up a sensible
 
speech to give to the C-PAC folks this morning.  Roy Helms tells me I should
 
be inspirational, and I shall try.  Corey went off to see about renting a car
 
while I had my last Portuguese sausage breakfast.
 I bussed out to the
 
C-PAC meeting at a place called Mark's Estate with the others, arriving around
 
9
:00.
 
I sat in on some of the meeting but felt nervous about my speech.
 I brought
 
some of the baskets and shell things I had picked up to show, and I tried
 
first to give them a summary of the trip (
as in the preceeding pages) and
 
then to give them some of the special points I had picked up along the way:
 
1
)  that although many of the islands I had visited were separating themselves
 
from the U
.S. politically, they seemed to retain their identification with each
 
other.  Micronesia seems to think of itself as a whole and as a working part
 
of a larger k whole -
-
 the Pacific islands (
Polynesia, Melanesia x with closer
 
ties, I think to the former).  C-PAC, I believe, should think about the practicality
 
of establishing some sort of membership or affiliation status for the Marshalls,
 
Palau (
Beleu) and the Federated States of Micronesia.
 
2
)  that the Pacific is an area, above all, of celebration.  They seem to adore
 
festivals, feasts, holistic sorts of get-togethers in which all the arts come
 
into play.
 In some places I even gathered they had so many festivals the whole
 
thing was getting a bit boring, and they needed some new ideas (
still wanted
 
the festivals, just other wxy
 organizing principles for
 
having their good times).
 1xbmtiexextka1zifxtkexxx  C-PAC should recognize that
 
there will be another Pacific Arts Celebration forth-coming; I believe in 1985
 
in New Caledonia.
 I believe if the various political units in Micronesia
 
and Polynesia started now having local contests (
inter-village), the winners
 
moving into larger inter-island contetts, etc., they could be in marvellous
 
shape by the time the next PAC meeting conies round.  This would allow C-PAC to
 
reinforce local celebrations and village contests with small amounts of funding
 
and/or techinical assistance, while recommending that the political bodies themselves
 
start saving up to finance the transport of their winning units to the celebration
 
four years away.  This might get x us all around the awkward prohibition against
 
funding overseas travel.
 
(
Apparently my remarks on this topic were poorly received by some on the C-PAC
 
board.
 Bea Ranis in particular had fought hard against participating in the
 
Papua-New Guinea PAC celebration, as I found nut later.  She was furious at the
 
end of my speech and had to be calmed down by Ryy Helms; she hardly spoke to me
 
afterwards.
 I still am not quite sure what the problem was: whether she just
 
thought I was being a presuniptious haole to come in with a recommendation, or
 
whether she resented any discussion at all of the PAC festival and possible
 
participation.  She is a difficult lady anyway.)
 
3
) that the energy crunch may drastically alter tourism in Micronesia.  Wherever
 
I went I tried to suggest that projects should not be based solely on hopes for
 
potential revenues from tourism.
 I did suggest that the level of cultural
 
offergins tmxkz made available to tourists should and could be raised, and that this
 
would be a good thing all around -
-
 the better artists would be supported and the
 
tourists would get a better product for their money.  This is true not only
 
in terms of the performing arts (
shows at hotels, etc.) but in crafts, especially
 
those offered for sale in tourist hotels.  Most of the stuff we saw in hotel
 
gift xXx shops were cheap-o objects from the Philippines.  This seems to me an area
 
where local arts councils could really have an effect.
 
4
)  that primary attention must be paid to radio and television, the principal
 
inter and intra island communication forms.  Particularly on Ponape and Truk
 
I was re-impressed by the ubiquitous and essential nature of radio.  Almost
 
everybody I met had a radio pressed to their ear; almost every vehicle had a radio
 
tuned in (
loud) to the local transmission.  This was not only a cultural but an
 
economic phenomenon; it was essential for most of the l
isteneers to know what
 
kind of weather would be forthcoming.  Somewhere in here, I said that I thought
 
the Endowment should help produce musical programs -
-
 radio transcriptions that
 
would be available throughout Micronesia, programming everything from local musics
 
to Bach and Brahms.  Somehow this came out wrong and several people thought I
 
was recommending exclusively tzzz European music.  There were nurmeous rumbles
 
among the California contingent about my ethnocentrism -
-
 how ironic; most of
 
the Micronesians, who by then knew me a bit, knew what I was trying to say, but
 
Californians get awfully holier-than-thou.  On my return to Washington I was
 
told by D
.C. based Micronesians that there were many radio programs of a local
 
native musics.  All I can say is that I only heard one in passing, though I
 
kept my ears open; m 99% of what I heard was mediocre disco, all one-beat and
 
extremely boring.
 I still think that  x
x xixg working with the island
 
radio stations to get a wide range of local and international musics available
 
to them woudl upgrade the quality of life enormously.
 
5
)  Finally, wherever I went, I enquired people's opinions about both C-PAC
 
and MARC.  Everywhere, they were approved of, and people liked the idea of
 
working with them.  There i
s an inter-island unity here; it can and should
 
be encouraged.
 
I have taken these statements from the notes that I wrote in advance of my speech.
 
Apparently, there was some considerable objection to what I actually said.
 
I
t is quite possible that I said something different, being pretty tired and
 
nervous for reasons I am not sure about.  Anyway, these five points are what
 
I wanted to say and I what I believe I did say.
 
Corey picked me up after lunch, and we went to a beach where for the first time
 
I ran into fish who had not been hunted.  The place was just north and east of
 
Honolulu, around the corner, so to say, from Waikiki, and when you got into the
 
water, you were positively bumped into by large one and two foot fish demanding
 
that you pony up with their daily calories.  Many people brought loaves of bread
 
into the water an doled them out like feeding ducks.
 It was really astounding,
 
another nice example of what the National Park System can do for the ecology.
 
They by the way had a fascinating maps posted that showed you what fish you
 
would run into I at what depth as you swam out towards the xEf protecting reef.
 
We swam and swam and swam and finally we went back home, walking up the long
 
lane that runs down to the beath,

the 26th is the correct date for the final day before I went home.  Jeff
 
wrote me a lovely note suggesting that I stay over, offering me the use of
 
his apartment and suggesting I need to rest and unwind, which I goodness
 
knows tax I could stand to do.  Corey goes home around noon.
 I am completely
 
confused as to whether or not I should stay.
 I am far too tired to be any use

 I don't feel

I finally took Corey to the airport and went with Roy Helms to the fancy
 
airport lounge he belongs to and visited with him until my own plane took off.
 
I think I was doing the right thing; it was a great experience, but I think I
 
have absorbed all I can.
 It will take me a long time to get back onto EST.

In working through the diary (
I'm still at it?) of my Micronesian trip, I
 
came across a note saying that Sister Callista requested me to determine
 
whether or not a legal document exists proving that the Insular Arts Council
 
of Guam has 501 0 status, and if so, where is it?  She would like a copy
 
post-haste, if sueb a thing exists.  If not  I suspect she would like * nice
 
legal explanation.  Could you take care of this for her?  1
 was completely
 
flumnoxed.
 
Yes  I will get you a report.  I don't seem to get any time at all to myself
 
these days, and nobody much cares about !

I apologize for the delay in getting it to you, but a eou le new vrinlçles
 
developed after I #poke with you.
 
First, Li. Bailey came by I 
to present us with several of the completed
 
radio program, that were developed out of the grant proj  t, and she ha
 
a long discussion with us about the proble m
s she had in working with
 
project director Jon Appleton, who was hued thousands of miles away at
 
Dartmouth.  I a n  afraid that this rather great co
znicatioua and logistics
 
problem might have been eliminated with a bit more foresight on our parts,
 
but we were so enthusiastic at the prospect of a worthy grant anpilcation
 
coming out of Micronesia, that we ray
 not have b e e n  our asual cr ticai
 
selves.
 
Second, r
:im informed us that she had taken over the job as director of tho
 
Arts Council of the Northern Marianas district and could not be involved
 
in the new proposal to continue the radio series idea in new areas (
see
 
project proposal and final application project description).  Consequently.
 
pine* there is no person with known expertise in recording and producin g
 
radio programs on the traditional arts involved in the new proposal (
s rce
 
Kim will be in Saipan and Dirk 3a11endorf in Guam), I doubt that the new
 
plan has much chance of being approved by our advisory panel.
 
Nevertheless, any thoughts you might have concerning the radio pro r
s
 
already completed and i
deas for cultural strategies for the future vis-
vie
 
the traditional arts would be very helpful to us.  I will send you a coiy
 
of our program brochure to give you an i
dea of the thrust of the Folk
 
Arts Program.  Also, if you Can recommend any local cultural '
1exp rta
 
(
anthropologists, ethno m
ueicoiogiata, folklorist,
 etc.), we may be a
!1e
 
to suggest their involvement in future project proposals from Micronesia.
 
The radio progr a
m proposal might. even be salvageable if the right personnel
 
were involved.
 
Under separate cover, I an sending you four seven-inch reel-to-reel t
'
 
with samples of the radio progra m
s and one cassette tape produced under
 
tm Bailey's supervision.  Please return the tapes after you have lister"

of a Yolk Artist in Schools project, an interesting program to
 
lace senior artisans practicing a variety of local traditional crafts
 
:

) They also debated the request for $20,452 to provide travel for
 
a
rming arts group to the Pacific Festival in Papua Now Guinea.  They
 
It uncomfortable about the project for several reasons:  the issue is
 
ot, since the festival begin

applications for travel by performing group, outside the United States.
,
 
since our small budget could soon be exhausted in such projects and s-i
nr
 
there Is no evioence as to the impact such adventures have on the local
 
communities .
 
However, the panel felt that the project was highly worthy and
 
even ca
ne up with an ingenious bureaucratic play for getting them some
 
assistance.  They pointed out that the Chairman could, if he felt it
 
visable, give the Commonwealth Arts Council an emergency grant to
 
pple e
nnt their normal block grant for the year (
thus freeing up their 
ney for this purpose).  They also recommended that the Endowment atto; pt
 
support the next Pacific Festival given a l

Dear Ms. Van Dorpe,
 
Thank you for your pleasant letter.  I an enclosing a copy of the brochure
 
that describes the program I administer, as I am sure I didn't have one to
 
give you the day we visited at the Academy of Arts.  I doubt that you will
 
decide to apply to us, but I thought von might like the brochure just for
 
itself; it gives an interesting discussion of why tradition is important
 
to people, and then I like the pictures in this edition -
-
 they speak of the
 
marvellous variation in human ideas of beauty that I see everywhere.
 
May I wish you all success in your work.  I did enjoy our conversation very

Dear Sarah,
 
When we '
visited recently, one of the things we spoke about was the possibility
 
of a Polk Arts Coordinator for Uavaii.  I
'm sending along the information we
 
usually send arts councils when they enquire how this program works.
 
It's pretty s
imple.  We will co-fund the position with you a year at a time for
 
a period not longer than three years; we will accept soft match but like to see
 
the federal share going down and the state share going up, as the years go by.
 
Along with your application, you'd need to send us a statement of qualifications
 
(
we enclose some samples of those used successfully by other states) and a j
ob
 
descrippion (
ditto).  We would urge you to keep your qualifications strict but
 
your job d.scr $pion wide, so as to allow the person you select mazimum flexi-
bility in developing an appropriate program.  We also require you to recruit
 
f
or the position, and can send you a list of places where a recruiting letter
 
might strike gold.
 
I hope the recent federal cutbacks will not affect your decision one way or
 
another.  You should t
hink in terms of what is best for your particular area;
 
we will continue supporting these positions as long as we remain in business,
 
because where high calibre candiáates have been selected, they have proven
 
themselves.
 
Finally, if you are thinking of applying reasonably soon, you might want to
 
consider gettinguns an application for our April 15 deadline.  We will be
 
allocating all our 1
981 funds at the subsequent panel meeting, and our 1982
 
budget -
 whatever the final figure -
-
 will surely be lower.  We will not have
 
another deadline (
except for dire emergencies) until September (
for projects
 
scheduled to start in 1982).  And, by the way  if you know of other projects
 
that are pAsuning to co m
e to us for assistance, please tell them the same thing--
the earlier the better.
 
I hope t
hat your plans are moving well.  We will be taking our budget to Congress
 
soon; the hearings should be especially interesting this year.  With all best wishes,
 
Cordially,

Dear Mr. Cornwall,
 
I
'm sorry it's taken me so long to get the enclosed information to you.
 
The brochure is just for info r
mation: it's easy to carry around and (we
 
hope) attractive.  The larger publication, the guidelines, has the forms you
 
will find necessary to fill in, if you decide to apply to us.
 
I
'd suggest that you try to make our April 1-15 deadline if at all possible.
 
I shall enclose a sheet with special information on it for film-makers.
 
Good luck with your Samoan ta p

Dear Aggi. Cop.,
 
I hope that Xamaki has
, alr e
ady written '
iou and told you how very confused
 
everything in the Arts Endowment is thee, days, and then you will not be
 
so surprised and irritated that it has taken we so long to write you.
 
I arrived ho m
e with a bad cold, picked up on one of the airplane flights I
 
made between Honolulu and Washington.  After I began to feel vaguely human
 
again, I was plunged into preparation for this recent National Council meeting,
 
a meeting that took place in the context of the severe cuts proposed by
 
President Reagan in all federal budgets.  By the time you read this, we will
 
know what he wants for the Arts Lndowment, but we had to work all weekend with
 
proposals that there might or might not be money for -
 who knew?  Mr. Biddle
 
felt we should conduct business as usual (as though we would be full-funded),
 
and I en sure he was right. but it was an odd experience.
 
So, it has taken me a long time to write and thank you once again for the
 
beautiful kikui nut necki
.acc you gave me, and t
he exquisite pillow from the
 
Waiane* Center.  I have worn the necklace to the office several times and
 
everyone always comments on how lovely it is.  I have so far, however,
 
selfishly kept the pillow at home.  They are doing some rebuilding of our
 
office space, and I want to be sure they are all through before I bring such
 
a beautiful piece of work in.  Please thank the ladies who made it for me, or,
 
if you will send ma the quilter's no w. I would be happy to write and thank
 
her directly.
 
I hope that you will one day be visiting me in Washington.  When you come,
 
I shall have a little surprise all ready for you.  (Katzaki will help me,
 
I
'm sure, so that I
'll know a day or two in advance.)

Tear Mrs. Bigler,
 
At the request of Jeff f
lackler. Director of the Arts Council of Hawaii. I
 
an forwarding to you information concerning the folk Arts Program and the
 
Museums Program at the National tniovment for the Arts.  I hope you will
 
find the enclosure, helpful.
 
As you will observe, the Arts Pndovment has little capacity to fund either
 
'
bricks-and-mortar  (
buildings) or actual equipment, such as display cases.
 
However, within the ?olk Arts Program, which I represent, we do have the
 
capacity to help with projects such as ethno raphic research towards the
 
production of an exhibit of T
Marshalless arts, or towards the production of
 
an associated exhibit catalogue.
 We also can help with personnel coats
 
for live demonstrations of the art forms being exhibited or for qualified
 
curatorial staff.  Our and out security guards would be outside our scope.
 
The Museum Progr a
m has its ow
o eeries of possibilities that should become
 
plain as you look throus
ub their guidelines.
 1 suppose I must mention,
 
however, that the Endowment is under severe pressure at the moment, with
 
the President's budget recommending that our funds be cot in half for 1982.
 
A modest inex en.ive project addressed to either Program would have the
 
better chance under the circumstance..
 
During January. 1 had the qreat pleasure of a quick island-hopping trip
 
through Micronesia.  Unfortunately,
 we landed only for a half hour each
 
in M
stjuro, Xvejaietn, and Johnston.  I was able to purchase a few exquisite
 
baskets and shell necklaces in the airports but had no chance to explore
 
farther.  I hope to come again some day, and will look forward at that time
 
to seeing your projected museum.
 
With my very best wishes for the success of your work. I am
 
Yours sincerely,

not help thinking of possibilities t

I noticed, for example, during my brief stays in Ponape and Truk (unfortun
 
I did not get to visit sigher Tap or Kosree) that there were many radios I

evidence and most of them played pretty continuously.  It occurred to me t
 
we should try once again to develop a sort of Pacific island network of  usL
 
programs to feature the music of each of the l
ttcroneaian islands.  The Polk
 
Program helped fund Kim bailey in a prel i
minary project of this type
 in Tr
 
Ponspe, but that project requires extending, improving, and strengthening,
 
believe.  It lacked experienced radio program know-how and was culturally
 
unskilled.  And I do think such a project should extend beyond Truk and Po'
 
\
nother notion that interested me was the thought that craft production an,
 
g
ales might be affected by the availability of packaging and shipping pos i
 
[
 personally found myself confined to buying just those items that 1 cou

crafts, suggesting to cmaftaworkera that they can only sell small easily

Dear Mr
.
 
Weital,
 
You have probably forgotten the incident, but I had the honor of addressing
 
you at a meeting of Micronseiso educators on the island of Truk on January 1.
 
I represented the National Endowment of the Arts Folk Arts Program and spoke
 
to you about the inclusion of traditional a
rt forms in school curricula through
 
apprenticeships and a program developed in the United States called "Artists in
 
Schools ".
 
At the time, I was traveling light and had no printed material,  to leave behind.
 
I an have now, though, and shall take t
he liberty of s
ending you two copies
 
o
f our i
nformational brochure, some an n
ouncements of our apprenticeship program
 
(please notice that they announcement is printed in English on one side of the
 
sheet and in Spanish on the other) and a copy of our formal guidelines.  I quite
 
well realize that you may not be interested in establishing any kind of granting
 
relationship with the Endowment, but the information contained in these publica-
tions, I hope, might still be of general interest.
 
Again, it was a privilege to meet with you  even if so briefly.  My very best
 
wishes for a successful school year,
 
Tours sincerely,

cLtcr to cunLtrm our conversjtio' of frt hv June 2C, J�

Ma. Teregayo and explained the whole situation to thee.  They seemed pleased
 
with the wey I
t hs a
ll wor..et ont.
 
The difficvitie , aa .
'
ou V
o w,  with t
he  pp Ic tion
 roceive  f
or suvport
 
of travel to the Festival of the Pacific were several:  Folk Arts does not
 
fund travel outside the United States; the t
ine span was so brief that it sicht
 
appear that we were funding something that had already happened which we are
 
not supposed to do; and we were anxious to avoid creating teu01002 throu ±out
 
the C
I'AC membership by appearing to favor one group over another.
 
Th... difficulties appear to have been solved by Chairman Biddie s auggeatior
 
that the grant be rephrased as a planning grant in anticipation of your
 
proposed Northern Marianas traditional art. festival.  We are walking tbroug
 
today * special Chairman's Grant for $10,000 in support of this.  The non
..y  ey
 
be allocated in any way the Arts Council sees fit, including travel for observer
 
and participants to the Festival of the Pacific if, as you told isv on the Phone
,
 
you feel that that is the best way for your group to gain the €
nporience
 
necessary to host a fins festival of your awn later in 1981.
 
This nay appear to be a bureaucratic ploy, but truly it is not.  It solveF
 
all three of the proble m I noted above, and, indeed has made it possible f
or
 
Talk Arts to support you in what at first appeared to be an impossible r
t ue t.
 
The grant will reach you as a Folk Arts grant; the Chairman has been kin,'
 
-
"tough to transfer some noney to our account from other sectiona of the
 
dowa.nt, sine, we are completely out of funds for 1980.
 
did, however, take the l
iberty of re-writing part of the project description
 
at you dictated over the phone to Martha Knenhold.  I eliminated all references
 
your proposed 1 1 festival me being,,
 "international "
 in scope for several
 
2-
First, I would not want te Foil- /rt  Pro'ra  t
o Lecome involve`
 
in a project as potentially expensive aa an internat T
h'il conferenco wtheut
 
p
anel consultation and approval.
 
Secondly, if your plans hold to make it international in scope.
 
I believe such an application should go to our "Special Projects", now known
 
as "Inter Arts" Program rather than to Polk Arts.  Inter Arts is the channel
 
through Which interdisciplinary projects may acquire funding by a process of
 
s
everal programs chipping in together.  It seems to me likely that if you are
 
going international and including such places as Japan and the Philippine
 
t
he f
estival would indeed turn out to be intgr-disciplin.rv  
,rather than
 
f
ocussed exclusively on the folk arts.
 
Thirdly, having been involved in mounting some international
 
conferences and festivals myself, I would caution you in the strongest terra
 
t
o allow at least two years lead time.  Such events are extremely difficult
 
and time-consuming to being off and I would most seriously recommend that for
 
1
981 you limit yourself to mounting the very beet Northern Marianas inter-
i
sland festival that the world has ever seen.  That would be a real "
first
 
and in the meantime, you could be laying the groundwork and gaining experience
 
f
or the larger effort.
 
Co
.
 with all the.w considerations in mind, I took the liberty of c r in' your
 
original dictated project description.  You are at liberty, of course, to go
 
ahead and broaden the plan as outlined, but I didn't want Polk Arts committed
 
to the  big  project until you had had time to think it over.  As it reads now,
 
we are supporting plans for a local festival: this fits our puidelines and
 
can, as I said before, be expanded later.
 
The folk artists in schools project will be reviewed at the August meeting of
 
the National Council and you will be hearing from us then with s
ome more
 
good n ., I
 hope.  Until then, keep in touch and please let us know how
 
things come alons'

that I

I also look forward t

Roy Helms is acting as a contact for me in Hawaii.  Should you need to get in

Deer Mr. Cabrera,
 
This is just a note to remind you of our meeting on Rota last January and
 
to urge you to be sure and look me up if you come to Washington for the
 
Conference on Aging.  My office is Room 1134 at 2401
. E Street, Northwest,
 
within walking distance of the Kennedy Center and the Watergate, so we are
 
strategically located for many Washington events.  And my telephone is
 
202-634-4282.
 
I shall enclose a brochure describing my trogram so that you will have a
 
fighting chance of recalling who I am and what I was doing on Rota.  Folk
 
Arts is not synonymous with arts of the elderly, but we do find that most
 
of our best practicing crafts people, story tellers, singers and the like
 
are by no means rev youth.  It takes years of experience to practice the
 
traditional arts well, as I saw all around we in Rota and Saipan.
 
May I wish you all success in your work.  Again, it was a pleasure to meet
 
you.

Dear Ana,
 
When we visited recently, one of the things we spoke about was the possibility
 
of a Polk Arts Coordinator for Saipan.  I
'm sending along the information we
 
usually send arts councils when they enquire how this program works.
 
I
t's pretty a
fapi..  We will co-fund the position with you a year at a t
ime for
 
a period not longer than t
hree years; we will accept soft match but like to see
 
the f
ederal share going down and t
he state share going up, as the years go by.
 
Along with your application, you'd need to send us a statement of qualifications
 
(
we enclose some samples of those used successfully by other states) and a job
 
description (
ditto).  We would urge you to keep your qualifications strict but
 
your job description wide, so as to allow the person you select maximum flexi-
i
bility in developing an appropriate program.  We also require you to recruit
 
f
or the position, and can send you a list of places where a recruiting letter
 
might strike gold.
 
I
 hope t
he recent federal cutbacks will not affect your decision one way or
 
another.  You should think in terms of what is best for your particular area;
 
we will continue supporting these positions as long as we remain in business,
 
because vh.re high calibre candidates have been selected, they have proven
 
t
hemselves.
 
Finally, if you are thinking of applying reasonably soon, you might want to
 
consider getting us an application for our April 1
5 deadline.  We will be
 
allocating all our 1981 f
unds at t
he subsequent panel meeting, and our 1982
 
budget -
 whatever t
he final figure -
 will surely be lover.  We will not have
 
another deadline (
except for dire emergencies) until September (
for projects
 
scheduled t
o start in 1
982).  And, by the way, if you know of other projects
 
t
hat are planning to come to us for assistance, please tell them the same thing--
t
he earlier the better.
 
I hope that your plans are moving well.  We will be taking our budget to Congress
 
soon; the hearings should be especially interesting this year.  With all best wishes,
 
Cordially,

Dear Bernadita,
 
It's been so long since I visited your home up the mountain t

'm the lady from the Yolk Arts Program in Washington who
 
visited you along with my daughter from Canada, Corey Denos.  I
'm enclosing a
 
copy of our brochure, t
he one I couldn't leave with you before.
 
I want to thank you for the little hanging you gave no.  We have a funny
 
custom in my family.  My husband, who was an artist (a draftsman and a sculptor)
 
was fond of quoting Picasso who once said that a picture begins to die when
 
you first hang it up on the wall.  Be meant, I guess, that von atop really
 
seeing it when it becomes a part of your ordinary surroundings.  So, my
 
children and I trade off things that we like, and whenever I go to see them,
 
I take along a picture or two that we all like and bring back some others1
 
so that we all get a chance to look at our pictures with fresh  eyes.  Anyway,
 
this is a long way of saying that I sent your hanging off with my daughter to
 
hang in my grand-daughter's room, until I get out there next Christmas with
 
something else to swap for it.  Megan is a very talented little girl, and 1
 
think she will like your work very much and may try to do something like it.
 
Pl e
ase give my best wishes to your husba n
d, and wish him the best of success in
 
his work.  And the same  of course, to you.  And thank you again for letting
 
us see your hone.  It was a beautiful spot, and you are making it even more
 
beautiful.

Dear Ms. Enos,
 
I an so sorry it has taken me so long to write you and thank you for the
 
lovely day w' daughter, Corey Donee (
from Canada) and I spent with you and
 
your friends.  I think of Rota often  it was  in many ways the most
 
beautiful island we visited, and I still recall with great pleasure the
 
lovely people we met there.
 
I an enclosing some extra copies of the Polk Arts brochure that were in
 
such short supply during my visit, also a few extra publications that eight
 
be of interest.  Some of them deal with how to set up folk-artist-in-schools
 
programs and how to start Voxf
 ire-type programs in the schools, but you have
 
such a good program already that I
'm almost embarrassed to send these things.
 
Still, maybe there will be something t
here you can use.
 
I hope you had a fine time at the wedding I It really grieved me not to be
 
able to stay, but we arrived beck in Saipan in time for a msr e1lous dance
 
program at a local hotel where I got to see a march from the Mortlock islandd
 
so I couldn't repine too much.  I
'm still sorry to have missed out on the
 
fruit bat though.
 
By the way, I have a special note to reein* myself to write you urging you to
 
think about trying to revive the cantanta custom before all the old folks who
 
know how to do it are gone.  I hops that's the right word: the folks in Saipan
 
said that that was that the custom of singing back and forth between a man
 
and a woman was called.  By the way, I forgot to ask you what the songs are
 
about.  Are they courtship songs, or sort of funny playing jokes on the other
 
people kind of songs?  Either way, I asked about i
t on Saipan and also among
 
Chamorros on Guam, and everyone said that the custom was nearly died out.
 
So perhaps you can revitali ze it and bring it back to life on Rota.  Let me
 
know if we can help in shy way: if you like, I could try to get a musician
 
with a first-class tape recorder to help you recoed and notate the music.
 
Please give my very best wishes to all the good people I met in Songeong.  I
 
shall drop a few more notes to the ones whose addresses I have  if I also out
 
on anyone, please apolog i
a. fore m

to send than my greetings, but as you know matters are a bit difficult
 
right now in Washington, and I do &t quite know what will happen next.
 
however, I an determined to keep in touch with the new friends I made on my

Dear Mr. Calvo,
 
Just a quick note to thank you again for the pleasant di, we spent in Rota
 
last January.  You may have forgotter
., it'. been so long, but I an the large
 
lady who visited from Washington with her Caisdian daughter, and you and
 
I
4s. Enos and Mr. Marstita and Ma. Taitano drove us all over Rota for a
 
whole day.  It was marvellous fun, and it will be a long time before I
 
forget your beautiful island.
 
I
'm enclosing a couple of copies of the brochure that explains the program
 
I manage.  Please show them to the lovely old gentlemen and ladies who came
 
to demonstrate at the school, and thank them again for me for their courtesy.
 
I did so much enjoy watching the rope making and the paudanu. weaving.  Tell
 
them that the three pandanus baskets I bought at the Japanese hotel are on
 
my desk, and every day some new visitor admires them.

Dear Mr. Mara Uta,
 
You any have forgotten me by now, but I wanted to write even after so long
 
and thank you for the pleasant day we spent together on Rota last January.
 
I will never forget the latti atones and the beautiful sites we visited
 
together.  I hope that you can keep those areas as they are; I found them
 
a really moving experience to visit.  I haven't had time to read further
 
about the archaeology of the Chamorros, but I shall get to it soon.  I
 tad
 
no idea how extraordinary the pre-history of Micronesia must have been.
 
I am encloeing a couple of copies of the brochure describing the program I
 
administer in Washington.  Maybe you can pass them along to someone if you
 
have no need of th e
m for yourself.  Things are a bit confused, as 1 expect
 
you know, here in Washington, but I do believe we will be able to  maintain
 
a good progrsn.  So if you hear of any way in which our Progr a

help on Rota, just drop me a line.
 
With my very best wishes to you always.

Dear Dr. Ba1l.ndorf,
 
t as sorry to have been so slow in responding  to your letter.  It arrived
 
while I
 was away from the office on * series of site visits.
 
My return to Washington  coincided with the arrival of two of your friends -
-
Carol Viti and Dan Baker.  We have had several long conversations about possible
 
Micronesian projects
 •
 I was also able to intruduce th e
n to Roy Usima, the
 
u, director of the organization called C-PAC, the Council of Pacific Arts
 
Councils.  Roy is a shrewd administrator, and I think may prove very helpful
 
in organising traditional arts activities in Micronesia and the other Pacific
 
islands.
 
As a matter of fact, C-PLC has invited ma to make a trip through at least a
 
part of the Pacific myself, and I shall be coming to Hawaii, Guam, Saipan, and
 
possibly Ponape and Truk some tine between January 8 and January 25 next year.
 
I do hope that I
 will be able to meet with you during my stay in Gu m, and I
 
shall write you my exact dates as soon as my itinerary is settled.
 
In the meantime, I am enclosing some of our new materials.  Pleas* pass then
 
along to anyone you think appropriate.  It so me to no, judging from the des-
cription of MARC that you sent, that we should be able to work out some interesting
 
projects together.  I
'll certainly look forward to * visit.

Dear Dr. Caldwell,
 
I hope you still may reae
er; we not on Ponap* and my daughter and I visited
 
a class you were teaching at the Community College of Micronesia.  I did finally
 
complete the tour I was making and an back at my home office catching up with
 
all the notes that I made along the way.  One of them reads that you remarked
 
that you had made both tape recordings and films in Micronesia some twenty
 
years ago, and that those materials were in storage in your home in Michigan.
 
Outside of sending you a friendly greeting and my regrets that my visit to,
 
Guam was too brief to allow as to t
ook you up there, I want to urge you
 
Dr. Caldwell, to look those materials up when next you get back to Michigan
 
and see if there is not some im
portant historical or cultural records included
 
in your films and tap...  In a part of the world whose history has been so
 
mangled, the visual and aural record of the past may be of major importance;
 
as a matter of fact, I am engaging right now in correspondence with Dtrk Ballendorf
 
of the Micronesian Area Research Center on your university campus with a plan
 
towards helping that facility become a proper stosage place for film, photographs
 
and audiotape.
 
Well, all that looks down the road.  But I do find over and over that people
 
who have taken what are essentially home movies -
-
 films for their own personal
 
interest -
 have often included important cultural documents in their shooting.
 
Pleas* take a look when you're next in the states and see what you might have;
 
wherever I went in Micronesia  the people seemed so vitally interested in their
 
past.
 
Again, it was a pleasure to meet you and in such a faraway and pleasant place.
 
I hope our paths may cross again sometime.  I shall enclose a description of the
 
program that I administer; perhaps you might run into someone who could make
 
use of it.

Dear Sister Cal
 lists
 ,
 
When we visited recently, one of the things vs spoke about was the possibility
 
of a Folk Arts Coordinator for Cu .  I
'm sending along the information we
 
usually send arts councils when they enquire how this program works.
 
I
t's pretty s
imple.  We will co-fund the position with you a year at a time for
 
a period not longer than three years; we will accept soft match but like to see
 
t
he f
ederal share going down and the state share going up, as the years to by.
 
Along with your application, you'd need to send us a statement of qualification.
 
(
we enclose some samples of those used successfully by other states) and a
 job
 
description (
ditto).
 We would urge you to keep your qualifications strict but
 
your job description wide, so as to allow the person you select maximum flexi-
bility in developing an appropriate program.  We also require you to recruit
 
for the position, and can send you * list of places where a recruiting letter
 
might strike gold.
 
I hope the recent federal cutbacks will not affect your decision one way or
 
another.  You should t
hink in terms of what is best for your particular area;
 
we will continue supporting these positions as long as we remain in business,
 
because where high calibre candidates have been selected, they have proven
 
themselves.
 
Finally, if you are thinking of applying reasonably soon, you might want to
 
consider getting us an application for our April 1
5 deadline.  We viii be
 
allocating all our 1
981 funds at the subsequent panel meeting, and our 1982
 
budget -
 whatever the final figure -
 will surely be lower.  We will not have
 
another deadline (
except for dire emergencies) until September (
for projects
 
scheduled to s
tart in 1982).  And, by the way, i
f you know of other projects
 
t
hat are planning to come to us for assistance, please tell them the same thing —
 
the earlier the better.
 
I hope that your plans are moving well.  We will be taking our budget to Congress
 
soon; the hearings should be especially interesting this year.  With all best wishes,

Dear Sister Cellists,
 
It is shocking to discover how long ago it was that we spent such a lovely
 
two days together in Guam,  As you might Imagine, matters have been very
 
difficult within the Endowment, and the qeneral state of confusion has put
 
me very far behind in my everyday work.  But that should not have included
 
at least dropping you a line and thanking you for the hospitality you showed
 
no and my daughter, Corey, during our stay on Guam.  Please forgive us, and
 
let us come again.  After another visit, we will surely do betterf
 
I am sending along with this letter a number of items that you wanted: extra
 
copies of our brochure, a copy of the Smithsonian festival program for 1980
 
and 1979 (if I have an extra), a copy of the Old Men of the Fiesta booklet, and
 
information from the Design Arts Program.

 hope you'll find all these things
 
useful, and please don't hesitate to write and ask for additional materials,
 
even if you  don't quite know what they are?
 
I an writing * n u

 If there turns out to be anyone '

Will you give your dauntless sister, Annie, a hug for me.  I have a sister

who cooked and served it, the pleasant company, the beautiful view, the marvellous

dish with especial fondness, also that marvellous soup with the achiote (
a
 
spice I an familiar with because they use it in Puerto Rico also) and that
 
delicious red rice and the coconut candy.  Wow.  It makes me hope that I can

the concept of the Museum is splendid.  As I suggested during my visit, it

afraid t

your projects may not be fundable t

The Arts Endowment has never done very much in the line of preparing material
 
for use in schools, feeling that such projects f
ell unier the domain of the
 
Department of Education.  With the current situation in Washington, i an not
 
quite sure where t
o refer you: the Humanities Endowment has * e

Development program, and I shell enclose information on that.  The Department
 
of Education is undergoing a major reorganization, and I have no information
 
t
hat would be at all helpful Vu afraid.

carefully, and see i
f you can frame a small project that might meet our

here may turn out to be state monies available to

Mr. Dirk Ballandorf
 
Micronesian Research Area Center
 
Guam
 
Dear Dirk,
 
Roy 1
!elma tells me he had a good long talk with you and that you are thinking
 
of coning into NE-
T1 with a three year proposal for a complete cultural (arts-
focussed) survey of Micronesia.  This seems to me an extremely good idea, and
 
I would like to offer every support.
 
You night consider one poasiblity.  We have on scaaaion funded the  egiuni ga
 
of projects that were obviously destined for I
hm
tanitiea support, on the
 
grounds that we are smaller, more flexible and can move faster.  Than the pro-
ject has a chance to prove -
-
 and improve -
 itself before final NMT review.
 
In this case, if you wanted to come in for * year's project of the type
 
you sent along before I came to Cuan, you would have to move very fast indeed.
 
Ourilast deadline for this fiscal year is April 15.  1 shall enclose a copy of
 
the guidelines in case pou want to try.  I shall also look into the possibility
 
of sending a telex akead
 of this letter to sort of get wouuthinking about it.
 
Concerning the proposal (which I think must have been drafted by Kim Bailey,,
 
no?) there are a few notable proble m
s.  The time period is too short be
 
be a year-long project, it seems to me.  Second, there should be something
 
written in about how you intend to get the materials out.  We are in the
 
business of getting cultural materials out to the culture producers themselves
 
(who often have been taught to de-value it) and to the general public.  If
 
you could put in something abo*t your eventu*k plans along that line, it would
 
help immensely.
 
Finally, and this is just a personal reaction, I think -
-
 if you do decide to
 
go ahead with developing your cultural archives and you decide to work with tin -
 
with or without a grant -
 you should consider that she's a bit fixated on
 
her own classification
mbe m
e.  Something simple-minded, like doing it by
 
island or by language would be a lot more useful to everybody else in the
 
world, it seems to me.
 
I have to run.  Will write you inter about several other things on my mind

Dear Sister Mary C*llista,
 
I was really delighted to get the application feson Traditional
 
Arts Coordinator from the Insular Arts CO WICile
 Iii fact,  it made
 
my day.  I am sure, if you can attract some f
irst-class candidates
 
(and we' ll help as much as we can, assuming that the project is
 
funded), you will find your problems are greatly eased.  And what
 
an opportunity for an exciting job for somebody I
 
I also wanted to tell you that I think your application is in very
 
good shape.  Eventually j we would hope to a.* some contribution
 
from state funds, but we are quite accustomed to exclusively soft
 
aatchffor the first year anyway.  However, there are a couple of
 
points in your application that I don't quite understand.
 
In your statement of qualifications, you suggest that a successful
 
applicant should have had professional training in at least one
 
folk art.  This might prove to be unnecessaryi it's not all that
  
useful for a coordinator to know how to make a basket or play a
 
guitar.  If I night suggest, I think you would do better to look
 
for sa
ne experience or training in documentation or presentation
 
techniques -
 photography, for example, festival organization,
 
recording technique., radio proluction -
 things like that.  You
 
night want to think about modifying that requirement, or possibly
 
expanding along the foregoing lines.
 
The other thing I wondered about was the make-up of your advisory
 
committee.  The formula you suggest has ghree representatives of
 
Cham a
rro pop/culture, one Filipino and one of another pacific
 
minority.  Thkn in pour list of possible co m
mittee members you list
 
Father Tom McGrath, Dirk Rallendorf and others who are clearly not
 
themselves Asian. Chamorro, etc.  Probably you are using the tern
 
to indicate persona knowledgabio in the cultures and arts of these
 
various groups, but it night be useful for the panel to know for
 
sure.
 
Perhaps you could drop ac aline about these two èssues.  Please
 
understand that I as not urging you to alter your application:
 
it's fine as it stands.  The first point it * friendly suggestion
 
that you sight want to consider or reject; the second i
s a point
 
of clarification.
 
Please give my very warses$treqards to your sister and to Donna
 
and your nice secretary, whose name X's embarrassed to may I've
 
forgotten.  And of course to pours.lf.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lonax Hawes

P.S.  I got a nice note from Joyce Samba the other day.  I had
 
written thanking her for the lunch and the recordings.  Please

apply to us for assistance, if you should need or want to; however, some kind
 
of project might possibly be worked out through the Micronesian Area Research
 
Center headed by Dirk  *1lendorf on Gu a

I really wish that you could consider further the needs of the various village
 
dance groups.  I think It is exceptionally important to keep these groups
 
going, and I an quite aware that money may not solve the problem in any way.
 
However, if money could help, do think of us.  Were you able to get films of
 
the dances at the  presidential inauguration?  1
 hope so, and I hope very much
 
that I could see the film some 4* .  I
'd also love to see the 8mm. film you
 
have of the making of the grass skirt.  Oh, and in my notes, I have written
 
down here that you will send me a cassette tape of Palausu march music.  I
 
really hope you can.  I enjoyed the little bit that I saw and heard of your
 
music and dance so very much.  It is a human treasure that mustn't be allowed

Dear Tins I
tebuher,
 
I an sorry I
've been so long in writing,  It was a long trip back home, and
 
then when I got back the difficulties over the new administration's budget
 
changes kept me extremely busy for quite a long t
ime.  I still don't quite
 
know where we are, but at least my part of the work is done for the time being.
 
I wanted to thank you for your hospitality while I was on Belau for that f
lying
 
visit.  Both Corey and I enjoyed our lunch with you greatly.  On my way home, I
 
not Birk Ballendorf of MARC at the Cuam airport and we had a few moment's chat
 
about your need for professional training for your museum curator and librarian.
 
He said that the Mshoi, Museum used to have such courses but did not any longer;
 
I also asked in Hawaii and when I got back to Washington and drew a blank.  It
 
seems to me that we ought to think in terms of send
 lug
, the mountain  to Mohammed,
 
in that case.  Could you, possibly in conjunction with MARC, figure out what
 
kind of training you might need and for how long, and perhaps we could get a
 
specialist out to you.  Dirk felt that often this was the more practical method
 
of training anyway, since it could take especial local conditions into account.
 
Think about it and let's see what we might come up with.
 
I shall send a copy of this letter to Roy Reins, the Executive Director of C-PAC
 
(
the Consortium for Pacific Arts and Cultures).  He may be visiting out your way,
 
and the two of you might be able to firm up a plan that we could help out with.
 
I shall also send a copy of this to Dirk Bellendorf, as I expect that for a little
 
while at least, any monies that we could forward you would have to go through
 
i
ARC, since I think it may take a while for our two governments to work out all
 
the fine details of our direct interactions.
 
While I was at the Museum, I bought three of the necklaces that have the little
 
plaques of the hal that say on the back "Friend of the Palau Museum".  Do you
 
know -
-
 many of my friends liked them the best of all the t
hings I brought back,
 
and so now I don't have even one for myself!  I shall have to arrange another trip
 
to get one.  I didn't really get to see your beautiful island at all, so I shall
 
look forward to returning one day.
 
Please giv, my best regards to Mo*ee Sam, Romans

Dear Mr. and Mrs. 7amingakssng.
 
I am sorry that it's taken me so long to write and thank you for your kind
 
hospitality during my too-brief visit to Palau.  My daughter, Corey Da
nce,
 
and I were reminiscing ontv t
he other day bi phone, and we agreed that our
 
dinner with you was certainly a high point i
t our stay on your lovely
 
island.
 
I mat also tell you that I finally spoke with your son, Ted, in Sar Francisco.
 
We had had a difficult time rachimg each other, but he was most kind and
 
cordial.  I shall be sending him some materials that might be of use to him
 
in pursuing his film interests, and he has offered to help me keep in touch
 
with ?icron sian matters.  He is trying now to determine I
f the rumor is
 
correct or not that Charlie Cibbona is seriously i
ll and in the hospital.
 
Our program had hoped to help fund a f
ilm on Mr. Cibbon's work: I hppe that
 
he will be well enough for the project to continue.
 
Again, my most sincere thanks for your hospitality and kindness during our
 
stay.  I wish we could have stayed longer: I felt as though we only got to
 
do a few harried bits of business, an' there was so much more I should have
 
liked to see and do.  Maybe some day I can return; I really hope so.
 
In the meantime, should you find yourself in the united States, especially
 
if you are near Washington, I hope you will
, allow me the p
leasure of trying
 
to return your Palanan hospitality.  With my very warmest wishes to you both
 
believe me.

August 27, left Honolulu, arrived Guam evening August 28th.  Tape:  August 29, 1983
 
Met by k  by Dr. Edward L
. Duckrow (
Kelp), Chairman, Guam Council on Arts
 
and Humanities, and Linda Tatiamo, Folk Arts Coordinator.  August 29, picked up
 
in a
.m. by Kelp and taken to Arts Council.
 
Kelp drove us a lot and we had many conversations.  He i
s aformer Peace
 
A
 
Corps worker from the P
liilllippines, lived there for some time, i
s now married
 
to a school teacher, has two small children, and has several arts jobs in the
 
area, mostly connected with schools.  He is running a program for the gifted and
 
C-O
4
 
talented (
which are different by the way).  He had attended the Pago Pago meeting
 
of C-PAC and was very disttrrmed and distressed  over the events that took place
 
afterwards.
 I
' wrassled with
, him pretty hard in every kind of dimension.
 I think
 
that he is a dedicated and devoted guy working very hard, I think he has very
 
limited vision really, and like many of the Guam people is so focussed on events in
 
Guam that conversations have a slightly Alice in Wonderland feel to them.
 
Corey pointed out 4
1j
- after the first t J
i or three days that no one yet
 
had asked me a single question that had anything to do with anything outside of
 
Guam nor had they volunteered any information on anything outside of their own
 
 
 concerns
 Annie Beneventej Stone  was talking a l
ot about the Festival
 
of Pacific Arts but then she had just gotten back from the meeting. She also was
 
concerned with C-PAC but approaching that again only from her own point of view.
 
Almost everybody else talked exclusively about Guam -
-
 of, by, for, to and with
 
Guam and it made for a very  -
-
 I think I was constantly misunderstood because
 
no-one was able to follow me if I went the least bit off of the primary topic,
 
even a minute or two. I may be wrong about this; I
'm going to think about this,
 
it may be too strong.
 
At the Arts Council, I
I talked a l
ittle bit with Annie and Linda.
 
L
inda was so involved -
-as she was throughout our visit -
-
 with care-taking of
Re-
many details that came up around the office that  we got almost no c
ommunication.

I
t was quite noticeable, RxpRxixti3c partly in contrast with Lynn (
Hawaii) who
 
had followed around and initiated conversations way beyond my capacity to tolerate
 
A
 
them, but who was very very interested and concernedA  Linda was really off about
 
her own business which amounted to taking care of a tremendous amount of work
 
connected with the basketry conference.
 I
'm not saying that she was not working
 
hard -
-
 she was -
-
 kx her attention was not on trying to pump me for any additional
 
i
nformation I might have.
 
During  the morning, in addition to talking in a scattered way with Annie
 
and L
inda,  a gentleman named John Benevente came in.  He had asked ahead for an
 
sotto voce
 
appointment with me.  Annie made i
t rather c
lear that she didn't think much of the
 
project and in fact blew speedily when he came in. I suspect that, judging by the
 
name certainly, he was one of her relatives, and she was a little embarrassed
 
Anyway Mr. Benevente turned out to have an awfully interesting idea.  My personal
 
hunch  is that he had gotten hold of one of those advertisements that says that
 
if you send of $7.50 for the right book, the book will inform you how to incorporate
 
yourself into a non-profit organization of some kind so that you don't have to
 
pay any taxes.
 Benevente however had gone a step further.  He was proposing
 
-
:
 
indeed had actually taken the step 4
A, of incorporating the Benevente

,
 
family (which i
s rather extensive
  in Guam
 in order to conserve taxes
 
and in order to provide benefits for the family.
 
He pointed out, for example, that they could then afford to give scholarships
 
to their young men and women xxi of the family who wanted higher education, and he
 
remarked with great  charm and a beaming smile that if you could hire a lawyer or
 
doctor named Benevente, why bother to hire one named Smith or Jones.  Somehow or
 
a
iso 
A
v1
 
another in there, he felt that this was a fundable project because a lot of the
 
A
 
Beneventes a
lso make baskets.  We couldn't work it out very much more precisely
 
than that, since I felt the whole thing was quite possibly i
llegal, and we didn't
 
pursue it very much fWrther, but it's a kind of fascinating development of the
 
whole c
lan idea, and for all I know the Beneventes may take over Guam before I
 
get back again.
  
August 1983, dictated in Saipan
 
Concerning the  Southj# Pacific Festival of Culture and the Arts,

And I get very antsy indeed and I don't have any particular
 
the problem in terms of
 
kind of trust in the way that they are going to handle/Guam at least.  Right at the
 
end I sort of tried to get at Annie on a couple of things.
 I confess that_I did
 
not face up to the ultimate problem which i
s that the newly appointed folk arts
 
coordinator, Linda, told Corey, who told me -
-
 and there doesn't seem to be any
 
.
0
'M  M
M
ONG
 
ccret about it anyway
 pthat the governor appointed her to the job l
ong before the
 
osition was advertized.  She is totally unqualified for the job except that she i
s
 
ni c e  e
nergetic lady and, although I continued to press Annie on such issues as
 
advisory
 
putting people of some degree of
 competency
 on her/committees and she assured
 
me invariably that they were ax already there, the problem is that I have absolutely
 
no evidence whatever that Ik cx she has ever consulted any of them about anything nor
 
that she \intends to.
 
We had a very disquieting conversation x
iixwk±xk concerning grants management
 
1 ' E
 
in which she was very surprised to hear that I did not
 to our panel
 
on aarwAs =es -
4.
.
 
how they should yotet I did not come in with staff recommendations, and she was
 
really quite startled by this, assuming, I think, that that was my function, and
 
assuming that I would be able to say on the basis of what I had seen on Guam what
 
our panel wk should do and would be able to assure her on that point  And I could not
 
do that.
 
qThe situation in Guam seems to me to require careful and very firm and very
 
gentle continuing work.
 I think that it's a l
ittle more than just political, in the
 
sense that whoeyer i
s in control gets to call the shots xxdxzktx until the other
 
side gets to g calithe shots, and it's just as blatant as that.
 It's not politics
 
1
 
in the sense of maneuvering or getting a l
ittle bit here in order to get a little
 
more there -
-
 tkaX x -
-
 it's not politics in that sense, it's blatant power.  They
 
going to be
 
seem to assume that it's/like that because it always has been like that and it always
 
will be l
ike that. nd they're not particularly interested in changing it.  A& And I
 
do believe that this applies to my dear fx x friend Annie Stone as well as to some
 
of the other people we met there.  They kind of like it that way and nobody wa txx
 
seems to want to do anything about improving it.
 
Xx
xaIctk±Ngxa
xxx±tx  So I think that steady strong Endowment pressure is going
 
to be very important in getting anything honest to come out of this situation at a
ll.
 
And I confess I didn't fight everything through in a
ll the ways I saw because I
 
in part -
-
 partly because I never did get anybody off by themselves. It was almost
 
a set-up.
 I was rarely with anybody in x
1q particular without at least two or three
 
other people being there.
 Annie and Kelp, for example, came out to the University
 
Of Guam with me, although I think that was the first trip any of them had made out
 
there in a year.
