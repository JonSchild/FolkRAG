Female 1 : From the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian National 
Museum of African American History and Culture. 
David Cline: Today is December 13, 2015. This is David Cline from the 
History Department at Virginia Tech, and also working with the Southern Oral History 
Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am here for the Civil 
Rights History Project of the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian’s National Museum 
of African American History and Culture, and the Southern Oral History Program. 
And [Fm] very honored to be here today with Joseph and Embry Howell. And 
what I would ask you to do—. Oh, one note. I wanted to acknowledge a couple of other 
people in the room, before I have you introduce yourselves. So, we have John Bishop 
from Media Generation behind the camera. And also, helping us out today is Guha 
Shankar from the Library of Congress. 
So now, what I would ask you to do—. And this is the only time Fm going to 
script you at all today—. Is to ask you to use a full sentence to introduce yourself, each of 
1 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133

you. “I am,” or, “My name is—,” and introduce yourself. And then what we’re going to 
do is just have a conversation. We’ll talk a bit about each of your childhoods, and what 
may have informed you, leading up to involvement later in the movement, and then we’ll 
talk about your activities. So, whoever wants to go first. 
Joseph Howell: Well, my name is Joe Howell. 
Embry Howell : And I’m Embry Howell. 
DC: And Embry, let me start with you, if you could tell us a little bit about 
where and when you were born, and I’ll ask you some questions about your childhood. 
EH: Okay. I was born in 1945 in Bethesda, Maryland, near here, at Suburban 
Hospital. The war had just ended, and my father was just leaving his assignment in the 
Navy. Actually, he had already gone back to where my family lived in Bristol, Virginia, 
at that time. And my mother stayed here to have the baby. 
DC: Okay. And so, where were you raised, then? 
EH: So, I was raised for five years in Bristol, and then my family moved to 
Davidson, North Carolina, where my father was treasurer of the college and ultimately 
president of the college. So, I grew up in a very idyllic setting, right on the college 
campus. 
DC : And could you tell me a little bit about what your family was like, the 
values that you were raised with? Sort of, the benefit of hindsight, in looking back. You 
obviously got involved in the civil rights movement. Can you see values that were 
instilled with you, or things that you were perhaps reacting to in North Carolina, at that 
time?

Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
EH: Yeah. Well, Em from Southern stock. We both are. My parents were 
both born and raised in Georgia. My father in North Georgia, near Atlanta, and my 
mother in South Georgia, really the Deep South. But they both came from—what I would 
credit my values—from very highly educated people, for the South. In fact, both of my 
grandmothers went to college, which was very unusual for women at that time, as well as 
my grandfathers. And that level of education goes back into the nineteenth century as 
well. 
So, my mother went to New York, and basically went to Communist meetings 
sometimes in the [19]30s, and was very connected to the radicalization in the [19]30s. 
Not my father. My father was a more traditional person, but they were very accepting. 
My father in his presidency was influential in integrating Davidson. So, the first black 
students who came were from Africa. 
DC : How did that begin, at Davidson? 
EH: That was—, I mean, it’s hard to believe that that wasn’t until—. Was that 
during the time you were there? 
JH: Sixty-three. 
EH: Sixty-three, the very first black students. And they started with African 
students, and then—. I don't know when the first African American students came to 
Davidson, but it’s amazing to think that when I was a child, and I went to thoroughly 
segregated schools. But it was a little Southern town, and my friends lived across the 
tracks, and their parents worked in the mills in town, and I had very close friends there. 
So, I would cross the tracks to go play with friends. And my mother—. I wouldn’t say it 
3 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
was her idea, but she didn’t discourage that. So, I’d say, from very early years, I learned 
that all people have value and should be treated with dignity. 
And we were—. Most people were quite religious in that era; went to church. 
And so, it was a Presbyterian church. And it was not integrated. But you got the values 
of [5:00] love and acceptance, I think, from that as well. 
DC: Did they have Race Relations Sunday, at that point, in the church? 
EH: No. There was nothing like that. There was no real effort reaching across. 
But that started a little bit—. I’d say, just starting in the beginnings of the civil rights 
movement in the early [19]60s, but I can’t recall anything like that happening much in 
Davidson. Joe might, because he was a student there, and he was a student radical there. 
But what was interesting was that we were in Southwest Georgia, which will come up 
later, and my grandmother—. My mother was raised just a few miles from where we 
lived. And so, there we were, back in Southwest Georgia, where she grew up. [Laughs] 
And she was quite accepting of us doing what we did. 
DC: Well, I will definitely ask about her connection to you all. 
EH: Yeah. 
DC : Joe, if I could turn to you for a moment, and have you tell us a little bit 
about where you were born and raised, and—. 
JH: See, I was bom in 1942, in Nashville, Tennessee. And I grew up in a 
suburb of Nashville called Belle Meade, which was the, quote, “elite” neighborhood. My 
father was—. Ended up being a president of a bank, and his father was the president of a 
bank, and it was understood that I would probably be a banker. And I went to 
Montgomery Bell Academy, which was an elite prep school of all boys. And this was 
4 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
part of the Nashville elite, a very heavy emphasis on some of the social aspects of social 
order. 
And what affected my life early on was having polio in 1952. I was moderately 
paralyzed. I spent six months in Warm Springs. I missed two years of school. I had a 
homebound teacher, but I was not a part of the school those years, with growing up at the 
very important ages of ten and twelve. And that gave me a sensitivity for people who 
were suffering. I never felt sorry for myself, really, in that sense of being, of suffering. 
But I felt an empathy for people that I think I probably would not have felt otherwise. 
And if I had not had that experience, it’s quite probable I never would have ended up 
getting involved in the Civil Rights Movement. 
So, that was sort of the foundations. What I did not know growing up—. 
DC: Do you remember making those kind of connections, even that young, or 
was it just something that you gravitated to—? 
JH: I think I lookback on it, it just sort of happened. I was always sort of a 
bleeding heart. It wasn’t just civil rights, but I had a soft spot in my heart. We were—. I 
remember bringing turkeys to poor people in high school and feeling, “Ah, how can I—? 
How can—?” And then, “How can people live in such conditions, and in an area where 
there’s such affluence?” So, I think that was a piece of it. And my parents were both 
very religious and very involved in the church. My mother especially. And I think there 
were religious values I think that were important as well. We were Episcopalians, and 
our church was near Vanderbilt, and it was a somewhat diverse congregation. 
DC : And you went to Davidson. 
JH: I went to Davidson. 
5 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
DC : And that’s where you met, I assume? 
JH: Well, senior year. After Fd gotten involved in the civil rights movement, 
we—. And Fm going to get into that, probably, in a minute, but we—. My senior year, 
Embry at that point was a mere child. Fm looking back on it now, I can’t believe we 
were so young. But it was at Randolph-Macon College. We had moved out of town, 
although I think briefly we had met once before. But that’s when we started dating, there 
at the end of my senior year at Davidson. 
DC : So, you dated the president’s daughter? 
JH: The president’s daughter. [Laughter] And I was the controversial student 
on campus. 
DC: So, tell us about student activism at Davidson, in that period. And this is 
[19]62—? 
JH: Well, yeah, I was going to get—. I meant to mention, in Nashville—. I did 
not know, in Nashville, what was going on at the time, in 1962 and 1963, and even earlier 
than that. But that’s where a lot of the early civil rights movement was taking place. 
And the planning of it all. The early sit-ins were planned in Nashville. Nashville was 
supposed to be the first spot, but they were pre-empted by Greensboro A&T, North 
Carolina A&T, etc. 
But Davidson was aware of that. My freshman year, my sophomore year, were 
other sit-ins. A few students participated, but it was very controversial. And then I 
became sort of a big man on campus my senior year. I was president of the YMCA, 
which for some bizarre reason, [10:00] it was an important institution then, at Davidson. 
And I was the president of ODK, which gave me a lot of social standing with their 
6 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
leadership fraternity. And I was in a fraternity. In fact, I was about as conformist as you 
can find. [Laughs] I did all the things you’re supposed to do. But the segregation piece 
was a no-brainer, even then, in terms of the injustice. I mean, even growing up, you were 
aware of, this just doesn’t make any sense. I remember having a playmate who was 
named Frederick. He was my age, and we played together until seven or eight years old, 
and at a certain point, my mother said, “Well, you and Frederick aren’t going to play 
together anymore.” Black kid, obviously. He was the nephew of our housekeeper. And 
I just didn’t understand. She said, “Someday, someday, you will understand.” 
And I went to—. I remember going to a YMC A camp with a lot of kids. They 
were white kids, from the other side of the tracks. They would be lower—quote-unquote, 
“lower-class,” working-class white kids that were very much anti-black-folks, and which 
rubbed me, or at least my sensitivities, etc. 
So, what you get today was that all this stuff is starting to happen. And we went 
to a conference in Bryn Mawr, called the Third Great American Revolution. And it was 
mainly East Coast colleges. It was put on by Haverford and Bryn Mawr. And I just 
happened to go there with a handful of other Davidson students. I was the only senior. 
And all of the leaders were there. I mean, CORE were represented, SNCC, SCLC, was 
there. And if they weren’t—. If the head guys weren’t there, their lieutenants were. 
DC: Thisis what year again? Just to—. 
JH: This was the spring of 1964. In those days—. This was sort of right in the 
middle of the Civil Rights Movement. In those days, they said—the message was clear— 
the audience, the participants were almost all white. And they were almost all Ivy 
League, prestigious schools. Davidson was the only Southern school, I think, that was 
7 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
represented. And it says, “Don’t sit on the sidelines. Get involved.” I mean, you can’t 
be neutral in this. So, we said, “Well, you know, we ought to do something.” And also, I 
did have one other experience at Davidson—. 
DC: They were getting ready for Freedom Summer, too, then. 
JH: This was right before Freedom Summer. 
DC: Yeah, right. 
JH: That’s right. Because Freedom Summer was 1964. And I had 
remembered the Freedom Riders had come through Davidson my sophomore year. And I 
sat in on a very small group of people—they were in the, I remember, the student union; 
there weren’t many people—describing their experiences of cattle-prodders, and being 
spat upon by these outraged white people, and all this. And I just couldn’t believe this 
was happening in our country. 
But before we, it was about a five-hour, six-hour drive to Davidson, and before 
we actually arrived at Davidson, which was late in the evening, we had come up with a 
plan to—. [Laughs] We were going to do something. We had this little stand-up. And I 
was the logical figurehead. I’m going to say, I was not an activist, and I didn’t see 
myself as a revolutionary. But it just seemed like the right thing to do. So, “What are we 
going to do?” 
So, we said, “We are going to organize a march.” This is a very—. This was the 
same time that the march—. It followed the March on Washington, which was in [19]63. 
This was the spring of [19]64. “We are going to have the March on Charlotte!” [Laughs] 
Somebody said, “Well, wait a minute. Charlotte is—. It’s not Jackson, Mississippi, or 
Birmingham, Alabama. They actually have fairly progressive racial policies. At least 
8 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
they thought they were. So, maybe it’s the March in Charlotte.” We went. [Laughs] But 
what we were going to do is collect signatures for people supporting the Civil Rights Bill, 
at that point in 1964, and then we were going to mail the signatures to President Johnson. 
And we were going to partner with all of the schools in the area that we could find, but 
predominantly black schools, Barber-Scotia and Johnson C. Smith, which was the, I 
believe, the host school, and several others. And I was the—. Ended up being the 
figurehead [laughs] in this thing, in this event. And it was quite controversial, as you can 
imagine. And the fact that I was doing it—. [Clock chimes] 
DC : Got to wait, just—. 
JH: Got to wait till we get the bird clock. [Laughter] 
DC: I do like that clock. [Clock chirps] 
EH: They don’t always go off at the same time. 
DC: Okay, it’s all right. 
JH: I mean, looking back on it, it seems about as innocuous as you can get. 
All you’re doing is saying you’re supporting the Civil Rights Bill. But it was, obviously, 
had a symbolic meaning that went beyond that. And Davidson was the sleepy school, 
safe place to send your child. So, I got—. I knew that I would get a telephone call. I 
would get some pressure, at some point. And sure enough, a [15:00] few days before the 
march was going to start, I got a call from the president of Davidson College, Grier 
Martin, who had a daughter named Embry Martin, whom I did not know, at the time. 
And he invited me into his house—. I mean, it was like eight o’clock at night, and his 
wife, Louise, greeted me at the door, and says, “Grier, he’ll be with you in just a second.” 
9 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
We went in the study, and we sat down. He said, “Joe, I just have to tell you that 
there’s a lot of pressure on me, from the Board of Trustees, and from the mayor of 
Charlotte, to ask you to just abandon this idea. Now, I have to also say that I can’t force 
you to do anything. You can do what you want to do.” He was very careful to point that 
out at the outset. But he said, “The racial relations in Charlotte have actually been pretty 
good, and the feeling is that it will create an image of the city that will do more harm than 
good, because it will distort the picture. And you’ve already made your point, so why 
don’t you just abandon it, and move on. But you don’t have to.” [Laughs] 
And he—, I could get a sort of a hint of a slight—not a wink, but I had the sense 
that he was actually supporting this. And it turns out, behind the scenes, he was doing a 
lot to make integration happen at Davidson, which happens [to have] already started with 
foreign students, and then, a few year later, two or three years later, the American 
students were at Davidson as well. American black students. 
So, we did the march. It got a lot of coverage. And the wire services picked it up, 
and the headlines of the conservative newspaper in Nashville had “Banker’s Son Leads 
Rights March.” [Laughs] So, that got everybody’s attention. Joseph T. Howell, III, 
which is me, the son of Joseph T. Howell, Jr., president of Nashville City banks, is 
involved and a leader of this march in Charlotte. So, that—. My parents were—. Their 
friends would, and they were part of the—. There was a Nashville elite cocktail party set. 
And they were—. People would come up to them, and they would say, “Well, Carol and 
Joe, it’s not your fault. I mean, these things do happen. And just don’t blame yourself 
for it.” [Laughs] And my parents were actually very supportive. They never—. I never 
10 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
got any feedback. And finally, my mother just came out and—. She said, “Fm tired of 
this happening,” and said, “Look, we’re very proud of what our son has done.” 
And Fd be going back to Nashville shortly after that. I was a bit of a pariah. My 
best friend’s mother, when I went to see my best friend, to play our usual game of 
Frisbee, met me at the door, and said, “You are no longer welcome in this house. You 
are a discredit to your race, and to this community. I never want to see you again,” and 
slammed the door in my face. It didn’t hurt my relationship with my good friend, but it 
was a real—. That was a—. And I felt sorry for her, really. I mean, they were—. I never 
took that personally, at all. I felt that she was a product of her time, and culture, and was 
in a sort of a straitjacket, as were a lot of people, in those days. Because it was a 
controversial time. 
So, just to sort of finish this up, in a sense, it could have been over. But we kept 
involved. One of—. One relationship that was established was with A1 [Allard K.] 
Lowenstein. And A1 was at UNC State, teaching history. I mean, he would send me 
stuff, and it would be on the back of a test. Or he would send me a special delivery 
envelope in a dorm. This mailman would be searching around the dorm for me to get a 
special delivery envelope with a test, and on the back of the test would be scribbled 
something like, “Give me a call. Al,” or something like that. So, we got to know Al, 
became almost Al Lowenstein groupies. Of course, he was involved in the Dump 
Johnson movement, very close to the Kennedy family, and a real progressive, brilliant 
guy. A very interesting guy. 
DC : So, did he just become aware of what you were doing at Davidson, or—? 
11 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
JH: Yeah, he had just become aware of me, said, “Listen, you’re one of the 
people I want to recruit.” And we became friends with him and his wife Jenny [Jennifer 
Lyman], at the time. And when we moved to Washington—. He was actually in our 
house when our first child was born. He was staying in—. He was sleeping on our sofa 
bed. [Laughs] But that helped, in a way, when I got to Union, which I’m sure we’ll talk 
about in a minute. The Lowenstein connection. Everybody seemed to know A1 
Lowenstein. In the Movement, as he called it. And we would all go to his apartment 
house and wait for him to show up two hours after he was supposed to, with fifty other 
people. 
DC : Can you just—? For those watching this who don’t know who A1 
Lowenstein is, could you tell us just a little bit about —? 
JH: Well, he went to the University of North Carolina, and became a leader of 
the—. I think he was the president of the National Student Association at the time, 
[20:00] and was brilliant. And he went to Yale Law School, and was a movement guy, 
progressive, and Eleanor Roosevelt was one of his heroes, very close to her. And he was 
like a Pied Piper. He had taught at Stanford, and he had taught at Yale, I think, for a 
while. And everywhere the he taught, students gravitated to him, because he was so 
smart, and he was such a charismatic figure. And [he] eventually got elected to Congress 
before they Gerrymandered his district, and then he didn’t get elected, but he ran again 
several times, and then was tragically, tragically killed; assassinated, really, by a former 
student, who was mentally ill. And the student who was mentally ill was the roommate 
of a good friend of ours at Union who became a pretty famous civil liberties lawyer. He 
12 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
lives in Portland, as a matter of fact. In Portland, Oregon. So, all these sort of 
interconnections. 
DC: These connections, yeah. So, when did you start thinking about going on 
to seminary? 
JH: Well, I got a Rockefeller fellowship, as did many people, and which at the 
time was a fund set up by the Rockefeller Foundation, to send people to seminary who 
didn’t have any idea what they wanted to do with their lives, and maybe some of them 
would end up in the church. And I chose Union, because it was in New York City, and it 
was a progressive institution. Paul Tillich and Reinhold Niebuhr had been there. It was 
probably the premier Protestant theological seminary in the world, in those days. So, I 
thought Fd really made it into the big leagues. [Laughs] And so, I went that one year—. 
And I liked it enough to stay on a second year, at which point, I got somewhat 
disillusioned, but then it was too late to change, so I took a year out of Union and did 
some—. Worked at something called MUST, Metropolitan Urban Service Training, Bill 
[Rev. Dr. George W. “Bill”] Webber had set up. I had a great year. And then, [I] 
finished up at Union. By that time, I was interested in other things. I was taking as many 
courses at Columbia Planning School, City Planning [Urban Planning] School. I had a 
job at the City Planning Department in New York, and then got into Chapel Hill [City 
and Regional] Planning School and went to Chapel Hill and got a planning degree. And 
my life career has been in developing affordable housing, and seniors’ housing. 
DC: And when did you—. So, we got the meeting of the families, right? With 
Embry’s father. And when did you first start dating and then get married? Where does 
that fit into the chronology—? 
13 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
EH: Well, actually, Joe doesn’t remember me, but I remember him. [Laughter] 
Which is kind of interesting to me. 
JH: I remember the basketball [games?]—. 
EH: But you see, I was much younger, just kid around town. But we actually 
met—. My first memory was being out there playing basketball, and meeting you—. 
JH: I remember that. 
EH: You do? Okay. And then I remember going with my father to the sunrise 
service [at] Easter, and Joe was speaking, because he was like this fascinating character, 
who was doing these interesting things. You know, a much older man. And then, also, 
that you had gone to work in the Lower East Side, and came and spoke to the senior high 
fellowship. 
JH: Right. 
EH: Yeah? So yeah, I knew Joe. And I remember being, I think in my 
bathrobe, and seeing you arrive at the front door with some kind of petition for Daddy 
about something or other. 
JH: [Inaudible.] 
EH: [Laughs] So, no, I was very familiar with Joe. And then I went off to 
college, and in those days, there were the women’s colleges and the men’s colleges. And 
you would have fancy dance weekend, and the guys would come for their dates. So, I 
had another boyfriend, and Joe came along for the weekend. And so, we began to get to 
know each other that way, and fell in love. And then, he went off to Union, and we got 
married after my sophomore year in college. And I transferred to Barnard College. 
DC: Oh, okay. So—. 
14 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
EH: So, we lived right there on campus at Hastings Hall, and I went to Barnard 
and finished my degree there. And so, that’s how it happened. Yeah. And then we both 
came down to Chapel Hill together, to go to grad school. He went to urban planning 
school, and I went to public health school. And so, we were in Chapel Hill, for a while, 
before we came up to DC. 
DC: Wonderful. Well, so, let’s stay at Union, just for a second, because I 
wanted to ask you about meeting Charlie [Charles] Sherrod, who would have been there 
while you were there, I assume. And how you ended up going to southwest Georgia—. 
JH: Well, it was because of Charlie Sherrod. Like everybody, he recruited all 
of us. I can’t remember—you probably remember, there must have been a dozen students 
close to him. And he was very charismatic, and very much involved in civil rights. He 
had been one of the founders of SNCC. And his area was southwest Georgia. And the 
people that he [25:00] viewed as like-minded people that might be interested in doing 
this, he would approach us all, and look us right in the eye and say, “I need your help. I 
need you down with me in Southwest Georgia.” How could you say no? And we had no 
idea what was going on in Southwest Georgia, and I don’t think he really did [laughs] 
either. He’d been away from it for a while. But I’m still not exactly sure what was the 
method in the madness, but nonetheless, he’d recruited us, and I remember we discussed 
if it was something they wanted to do. And people were still getting killed, in those days. 
It was still taking some risk. But I remember, we looked at each other and said, “Yeah, 
this is the right thing—” 
EH: A big adventure together. 
JH: “—thing to do.” 
15 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
EH: Yeah. 
JH: And part of it was sort of, I guess, an adventure. So, we signed up, along 
with some of our good friends, like Ed Feaver and Joe Pfister. 
DC: From Union? 
JH: From Union, right. 
DC : And went down for the Summer of 1966? 
JH: [Nineteen] Sixty-six, right. 
DC: And you sort of said this already; you didn’t really know what to expect. 
But can you tell me about the trip down there, and then what— 
JH: Well, that’s right. 
DC : —what you found when you got there? 
JH: Well, there were two things that pre-dated the—. Actually, working in 
southwest Georgia on this trip. One was the conference we went to, where we were 
supposed to be trained. And this was in Wake Forest, the old Wake Forest campus. And 
it was sponsored by something called—. Oh, gosh, I can’t remember. But it was a 
somewhat radical Christian Ecumenical something-or-other. 
DC: The Ecumenical Institute [?]? 
JH: Institute. Yeah. 
EH: That’s it. 
JH: Ecumen—. [Laughs] 
EH: Yup, yup. 
JH: And I know it was awful. I mean, it was thought-control, brain-washing 
kind of stuff, and sort of rebelled at that point. So it didn’t help us much, because it was 
16 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
not just civil rights people, it was all these other people who were involved in doing other 
things over the summer, and they were supposed to radicalize all these young Christians 
and take over the world with Christianity—. [Laughs] The guy was a complete nutcase, I 
thought; all the people who were involved. But we did meet some civil rights workers at 
the time, and they—. I remember going out, and they gave us some advice, in terms of, 
you always back in, into a restaurant, or some place, so you can run to the car and get out 
before they [laughs] come at—. If they come after you, you can make a quick getaway. 
DC : Run back to your car. 
JH: That’s right, and other things like that. So, we arrived in Southwest 
Georgia, after driving all night at the SNCC office, which was located in an area of “Al- 
binney” [Albany, Georgia], as it’s pronounced, called Harlem. And which was, in some 
ways— 
EH: That’s right. 
JH: —it was like a miniature of New York Harlem. 
EH: That’s right, it was a miniature Harlem. Mm-hmm. 
JH: And my recollection is [of] being met by these civil rights guys, black 
guys, in white T-shirts and blue jeans. And as we got out of the car, the comment—. The 
first comment that I recall somebody making was, “Welcome to Al-binney,” [they] said, 
“We are Black Panthers. You are Roosters,” which is the—you remember the emblem, 
that’s the mascot of the Southern Democratic party, white Democratic party, in Lowndes 
County, or some place. Alabama, or some place. “Panthers eat roosters. Go home, 
whitey, we don’t need you!” [Laughs] So I said, “Oh, my goodness! Here we are—. 
Wait a minute. What’s wrong with this picture? We’re coming down here. We’re 
17 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133

Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
Southerners, and we’re risking our lives, and this is the—. We are not met with open 
arms.” And so, it was quite unsettling, although that quickly passed, although that was 
the sort of introduction that times are changing. 
And what was going on there? The big story of 1966 in southwest Georgia, was 
the big fight between John Lewis and Stokely Carmichael. And all of this was going on 
behind the scenes. Charlie was right in the middle of it. But the one view, John Lewis 
view, is that integration is the way to go. You need the white people, and especially 
Southern white people. I mean, we were the only Southerners down there. The only 
married couple. You need these people. They will play a role—. Well, the Stokely 
Carmichael view was, “Yeah, they could play a role, and they’ve played a role in the 
past, but we have got to be responsible for our own fate. We’ve got to build up the 
leadership, and to have white people involved confuses things, at this point in history.” 
So, it wasn’t against us personally. 
But we had no idea that this was going on. We didn’t know that Charlie was 
struggling with all this. And so, that played out in part, in terms of where we got placed, 
and what we did, and it played out throughout the whole summer of this split between 
people who were really gung-ho, and really wanted to make a difference, and yet, people- 
-. The ambivalence felt by many of the grassroots black civil rights workers that saw us 
as a threat, [30:00] and as people whose time has come and passed, in terms of where the 
movement was. 
DC: Mm-hmm. And it was that summer that Stokely Carmichael and Willie 
Ricks gave that a name, right? 
JH: That’s right. It was almost to the date.

AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
EH: You know, it’s interesting, though. I don’t remember those statements. 
They might not—, I was treated kind of with kid gloves. I was an unusual person, this 
white Southern female. Most of the people had never met anyone like me. And the guys 
were always extremely polite and respectful to me. I never was spoken to harshly. The 
entire summer. So, I don’t—. If I was there, I don’t recall it. 
JH: That’s right, but—. 
EH: I’m sure it happened. But I think they talked to Joe that way. I think—. 
DC: What about your, Embry, your Georgia roots, and in a sense, this—. I 
mean, you had never lived there, but coming back to a place that was a family home—? 
EH: I had spent time in Georgia as a child. Ithinkit was actually helpful. I 
think our Southern roots were probably helpful to both of us. Especially as we became 
embedded in the community, and in the black family, because really, we were raised in 
fairly close proximity to black people. And had a fair amount of contact with them. We 
liked the same kind of food, we spoke a lot the same way, and we understood each other 
well. And I think it allowed us to not necessarily [clears throat] with the civil rights 
workers, because they were often not from there. But with the local people. So, I never 
had any sense of estrangement in that way. 
Of course, we couldn’t relate to the white people in the community. So, if they 
saw us walking down the street—. At one time, remember, there was white woman who 
stopped to pick me up as I was walking down the road. And then she realized who I was, 
and she wouldn’t. So, we never had contact with the white people. 
19 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
JH: And we had a—, I had a serious infection when I was down there. And I 
couldn’t see the black doctor. I had to go to a white doctor, because it was just unheard 
of that—. It was completely separate. But that one struck me as being kind of strange. 
EH: And then, I remember when you wanted to get your hair cut. My hair, it 
didn’t matter, because we had that long hair, in those days. But they had never cut 
anybody’s hair like that [laughs], 
JH: Yeah, that’s right. It wasn’t the best haircut I’ve ever had. 
EH: [Laughs] 
DC : So, you went into the barber shop? 
JH: I did get a haircut. 
EH: Went into the black barber shop. Because you didn’t want to go into a— 
JH: It would have been very tough for them— 
EH: —white barber shop. [Laughs] 
JH: —they were very reluctant to do it, but they did. 
DC: So, tell me about living within the black community, then, and the family 
that you got to know, and maybe before that, how difficult it was for a family to be 
found, at first, for you all to live with? 
JH: Well, that was the big issue, is, what are they going to do with us? In fact, 
we were a married couple, number one, and of course, there were all the people down 
there who were white, so some people would go into Cordele, some people in Baker 
County, some people Moultrie. They were all over, in Southwest Georgia. And Baker 
County was the worst. They had the worst reputation, and they had never had anybody- 
20 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
any outsiders come in there, and they had this guy, Sherriff Johnson, or whatever his 
name was. 
DC : The Gator. 
JH: That’s right. Just awful. You know? 
DC: [Inaudible.] 
JH: All these terrible things happened. So, that would be the last place they 
would send us, would be there. But they had an issue there, a problem there, in that the 
Head Start program had just gotten underway. And it had to be integrated. And there 
were no white people that would have anything to do with the Head Start program, so it 
had to have some kind of token radical integration. And they needed two or three people 
to do that. And it was Ashley, right? The other lady from New York was involved as 
well, but wasn’t part of the—. 
EH: And they had the one lady who came down from the Bank Street School, 
to direct it. 
JH: That’s what I’m thinking about. 
EH: Yeah. Mm-hmm. 
JH: So, they was going to be, Baker County—. This was Charlie’s idea. Let 
them go to the Head Start thing. They’ll integrate, or they’ll keep their funding. Which 
was great, because we did have a purpose. And so, that was a relief to me, that we had 
something to do, working in Head Start. But where were we going to live? I mean, that 
was the other big issue. Who’s going to take these people? So, we went to several mass 
meetings—quote-unquote “mass meetings,” which would be maybe twelve people one 
time, and maybe thirty, forty, another time, and it would be two hours late, as we [35:00] 
21 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
call Baker County time. You had to kind of get used to the cultural adjustment for all 
that. And then the call would be made, “Who would take this couple?” And people 
would be quiet and wouldn’t say anything. [Laughs] Wouldn’t know what to do. And 
then, finally, it came down, they had to make a decision, and it was a bigger meeting, 
and—. 
DC: People were sitting there, meanwhile? 
JH: That’s right. We’re sitting there, observing this. Sometimes we were 
asked to leave, but it was quite awkward. [Laughs] You know, we said, “Gee, we don’t 
really want to—.” Because people were actually pretty afraid to have a—. White people 
staying in their house would be a red flag for these, Sheriff Johnson, and these other 
people. After a week or so of this, of going—. And it was a good drive, of thirty, forty 
miles from Albany to Newton, Georgia. So we’d be going back and forth. There was a 
meeting where it was very tense, and you could just sort of feel the heat and the 
sweltering humidity. And one lady got up, and she said, “I know it’s—.” Something to 
the effect of, “I know it’s dangerous, but somebody’s got to take these folks, and I’ll do 
it.” And this was Divina Holt [?]. And [she] lived on a little sandy road, out in the 
middle of nowhere. And we stayed with the Holt family. It was Noah. Jack Holt, who 
was actually—. He was named Noah as well, as I recall. But it was Jack Holt was—. 
[He] was almost blind—. Was her husband, who was a small farmer there. They had 
gotten land free from a somewhat, quote, “enlightened” slave owner. But it was second- 
generation. They must have been second-generation, from his. And everybody on that 
little road had some acres of farmland. And so, we ended up staying with this family, and 
becoming a part of the family. And—. 
22 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
EH: They were independent, because they were independent farmers. So they 
couldn’t be thrown off their land. 
JH: That’s right. 
DC: So they could take some risk. 
EH: Yeah. Yeah. 
JH: So you might want to talk a little bit about the Holt family, and—. 
EH: Yeah. 
JH: That would like—. 
EH: The Holt family. We moved right in. They actually moved out of their 
bedroom, and we moved in. And in that house, there was us, the Holt parents, their two 
sons, who were sixteen and twelve, as I recall, that summer. Along about there. And 
those boys had been some of the first to integrate the white schools. Yeah. So, they were 
very brave people. And then, Ashley Wiltshire, who was another seminary student. So 
we all lived in the house together. 
They cooked for us. Ms. Holt, every day, we’d wake up, and she was making 
biscuits. And they were delicious. She cooked the most delicious food for us all 
summer. They grew their own food. They’d slaughter a pig, you know, and we’d eat 
everything that came from the pig. 
JH: Chase a chicken down and wring his neck, [Laughs] every morning. 
EH: Yeah, she would chase a chicken and wring its neck, like that. And every 
Sunday, there’d be chicken and dumplings. So, we ate very well, and we loved the Holts, 
and we became very close to them. She treated us like their own children, really. 
DC : And you’ve maintained contact with the Holts? 
23 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
EH: Yes. Well, it’s interesting how it happened. We did, and then we kind of 
trailed off, and we heard—. Because Ed Feaver, [and] our friends, they were down there, 
and so we heard that Mr. Holt died. And then, we were very careful to call them Mr. and 
Mrs. Holt. I mean, that’s one of the things in the South is that, often, black older people 
were called by their first name by people of our generation, which we definitely avoided 
that, and called them “Mr.” and “Mrs.” And I never heard her say, “Don’t do that.” 
They—. 
JH: [Inaudible.] 
EH: She appreciated that, because in the black community, it’s very formal. 
You know, and you do—. So, we heard he died. And he was quite a bit older than her. 
And then she lived on, but unfortunately, we didn’t see her until she died. But when we 
went back down, we—. Or we had had a visit down there on our way to Florida, and we 
had tracked down the boys, as they were now grown men. And then we saw them again 
when we went for the reunion. So, yeah, we just send them a Christmas card, and yeah, 
back and forth that way. So it was a great experience. So we were living with them, and 
we were working in Head Start, and with these kids. And then we were attending the 
mass meetings and church services on Sunday. And did a little bit of voter registration 
toward the end. But basically, we had a light job. And we were not targets, in terms of 
going door to door. [40:00] So, we were, in a sense, lucky. And plus, it was purposeful. 
We didn’t feel that we were wasting our time, because we had these kids we were helping 
out, and they needed the help. But it doesn’t sound very radical, looking—. I mean, when 
you think about it. But just being there, physically. And I didn’t think—. I never really 
24 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
thought about the danger involved. But when we connected with the Holt—, I would say 
Holt men now, but Holt boys, at the time. 
EH: Yeah, oh, they’re retired, now. [Laughs] 
JH: They told us the story of the summer preceding our summer. I guess it 
was [19]65, where there was a standoff around their house with the Ku Klux Klan, and 
their hoods and masks, with guns drawn. Pointed a shotgun, went out and surrounded 
their house. And the people in their house also had guns. And it could have been, I 
mean, it could have just been an incredible disaster. But they backed off, and nobody got 
killed. But they could have. And so, that was the climate that was going to—. There was 
violence, and there was hatred, and it was like a war. And we were the enemy, from the 
point of view of the white folks that lived there. 
But we didn’t see any of that first-hand. We were very—. In that form, we were 
sort of protected. This was—. And we really felt accepted and loved. One of the big 
events was the Fourth of July pig roast that they have every year, and relatives from all 
over come to the event, and family, extended family. It starts 4 or 5 o’clock in the 
afternoon, and they roast this pig all night. This is July 3rd, and then on July 4th there’s a 
big party, and you eat all of this terrific food. And you hear all the stories that get told, 
and stories about the alligators, and the ghost of the swamp. It was almost—. It was a 
civil rights experience, but it was also a cultural, intercultural. It could have been like a 
Peace Corps type experience, in some ways. You were with people that you sort of 
understood, because you’ve seen them, but you didn’t really—. It was a very different 
way of life from what we were brought up. I mean, there was no running water, no 
bathrooms, very modest. But warmth and love, and—. 
25 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
EH: We changed them, and they changed us. Yeah. 
DC: That’s what I think is so interesting, the different kinds of movement that 
the movement can be. Right? And that you weren’t marching in this particular case, but 
were getting to—. One-on-one, people getting to know each other, and each other’s 
humanity. And that’s very much in keeping with Sherrod’s vision, in that area, of the 
Beloved Community. 
JH: That’s right. That’s right. And the—. 
EH: And another thing that was going on that summer that we were not—. 
Were just peripherally aware of and involved in, but that Shirley’s father had been 
murdered, and the trial was going on that summer. So, we were able to go and observe 
the courtroom where this very prominent civil rights lawyer from Albany was involved in 
trying to bring this person to justice, but—. 
JH: This was the second trial, I think. This was, I think—. 
EH: Yeah, I can’t remember the details. 
JH: A civil suit. I can’t remember exactly, but I knew he’d already been— 
EH: Acquitted. 
JH: —acquitted the first time, and this was a second trial. 
EH: To try to get—. 
JH: C.B. King was the lawyer. 
DC: [He] was the lawyer, right. 
EH: Yeah. 
JH: And I mean, there was jury selection. So, they would ask the same 
persons, they’d ask these jury selection. They were all white jurors. And I guess it was 
26 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
C.B. King, would say, “Do you hate all black people?” And they would say to him, 
“Absolutely, yes, I do.” And then the white lawyer would say, “But an individual black 
person? Would you hate that person, necessarily hate that person?” “No, no. Not 
necessarily.” I mean, it was—. [Laughs] So they got them—. All of them got selected. 
Nobody got thrown out. I mean, it was just—. But he was building the case for an 
appeal. But I don’t think it ever happened. I don’t think that—. Something happened, in 
terms of actually bringing this kind of justice into it, and it never occurred. 
EH: What about going over to—. Not Jessup Island, but where’d we go? 
JH: Well, was at Jekyll Island? 
EH: Jekyll Island. Jekyll Island. 
JH: That was one of the highlights. 
EH: That was crazy. 
JH: Where they had—. The interesting thing about it was that there was an old, 
I think, NAACP group—. Elite black group from Atlanta, that was having a conference. 
But it was the black elite. It was very different from the grassroots SNCC people. And 
there was this great class difference between SCLC, and certainly the black elite, the 
educators, and sort of thing, versus the grassroots SNCC work. But somehow, we were 
invited, or we invited ourselves to get in, and to attend this conference on civil rights on 
Jekyll Island. And we got on a school bus, [45:00] and left early in the morning, and 
most of this was happening in a motel, but of course there was no place for us to stay, so 
we—. 
EH: Right on the beach. 
27 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
JH: —had to sleep on the beach. [Laughs] I remember the insect repellent 
going out. Eve never been so uncomfortable, bitten by mosquitoes. But we basically 
crashed this [laughs] this event. You could tell the people who were running it were just 
about—. Were completely shocked as to what—. As to the kind of people that showed up. 
These bleeding-heart white folks, and these grassroots black organizers. 
EH: Well, also because it was a white hotel, you see? 
JH: Yeah, I think it probably was. 
EH: And generally, everything was segregated at that time. And I don't know, 
maybe they’ve made some concessions to the NAACP, for a small group, but then, 
busloads of these people arrived. 
JH: That’s right, it was—. It was a very awkward situation. 
EH: And took over the establishment. 
JH: Nothing got accomplished, but we had a great time, I remember. 
[Laughter] [Recording stops and restarts] 
DC: Joe, I was actually just about to ask you about, you know, we had talked a 
little bit about when you first arrived, your welcome there to [laughs] Albany. But how 
did conversations play out during the rest of the summer, about Black Power, as things 
were shifting in the movement? 
JH: Well, yeah. What was going on, we were isolated there in Newton, 
Georgia. It was just three white folks; it was Embry and me, and Ashley Wiltshire, 
doing, as I’ve said, the Head Start and the mass meetings. But we didn’t see—. 
Occasionally the SNCC workers would show up to the mass meetings. And that bothered 
me, in a sense, because I felt they were pushing—. And again, a lot of this is completely 
28 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
my naïveté. There were so many things I was clueless about. But this was a revolution. 
This was not a summer camp. But they were pushing people to move, and to endanger 
themselves, and to take positions that they didn’t want, that the local folks didn’t want to 
do. They were afraid to do it. But they would push, push, push. And I kept thinking I 
wanted to push back. No! You shouldn’t make these folks risk their lives for the cause. 
It was a very important cause. That’s why we were there. But I had real ambivalence 
about that, not realizing at the time that this was not a feel-good, [laughs] although the 
Head Start was a little bit that way, but so, I missed that part. 
The other thing that I was really naive about was the black church. And then 
what bothered me about the black church was all this guilt, and the fact that they talked 
about how bad everything—. I mean, looking about heaven and getting your just rewards. 
And all, and you should be able to understand that, but I just felt like these ministers were 
frauds. And some of them might have been, but this was what they did. And of course, 
they would pass the plate several times, and off they would go to—. An itinerant minister 
would go off to another church. It really bothered me, and it shouldn’t have, because the 
black church was very important in civil rights movement, and it would not have 
happened without the black church. 
But in terms of the fringes churches, they were not a part of any of that. And 
these ministers had nothing to do with the civil rights movement. I thought there was a 
lot of manipulation and taking advantage of all these poor working people. But I, looking 
back on it now, I realize it was my lack of—lack of understanding. [Laughter] 
DC: Well, I don't know about that, Joe, because, as you say, there were a 
number of people from the black church that were incredibly important in the movement, 
29 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
and yet, sometimes that brush then paints all the black church as somehow heroic in the 
movement, and yet— 
JH: That’s right. 
DC: —there were many folks, especially in that area, in Southwest Georgia, 
who weren’t involved, who wouldn’t use their churches for meetings, and as you said, 
were more interested in maybe filling their pockets—. 
JH: That’s right, making a living. 
DC: Yeah. Right. 
JH: —holding people back. So I was a little bit disillusioned by that. And then 
a little bit disillusioned by the pushback to having white people there, and feeling 
insecure. But then again, you get over that, especially feeling the warmth and love of the 
whole family, and their relatives and friends. So the discussions would take place at 
these weekend retreats, at the Koinonia Farm, which goes way back into the [19]30s as a 
socialist—pacifist, really—organization. 
And that’s when you would have these discussions, both informal discussions, 
which basically went pretty well. I feel like with the informal discussions—, I felt well- 
liked by these guys, for the most part. And when they were not playing the role, it was 
fine. But when it was time to take a position, that’s when this would all come out about, 
“We don’t need you guys. Why don’t you go back home? This is Black Power, this is 
not white power. White power is what we are trying to get rid of.” Etc., etc. And then, 
how do you respond to that? And in some cases, [50:00] there was sort of acquiescence 
on the part of white people. “Yes, we are guilty.” And we would almost surrender. And 
I didn’t, I said, “Well, you know—.” I never took much of a stand, but I can remember a 
30 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
couple of things that I said that were—. I would finally make a statement, somebody said, 
“Well, this just proves how stupid these people are!” [Laughs] “They don’t get it!” 
But that was sort of a game that was going on on one level, a sort of intellectual 
level, but deep down inside, I think they really were glad to have us there, and we 
respected each other, and sort of liked each other, for that matter, as well. And they were 
under a lot of pressure, these guys. They were young men, for the most part. And none 
of them were local. They’d come in and out of the movement, and many of them had 
really no clue what they were going to do with their lives, and they were going. They 
were basically our age, a little bit older, and struggling, I think, with life decisions. Many 
of them had gotten scholarships to pretty good schools in the east, and they had feelings 
about going white schools. And some of them had gotten scholarships. 
So everything was changing. Everything was in flux. And you didn’t know 
where it was going to come back, so you sort of focused on what you can do, to occupy 
the day, and working in the Head Start program was what we did. And just didn’t worry 
about that, after a while. You just let the water run off your back, and if people want to 
sort of mouth off about one thing or another, I said, “Fine, [laughs] just let ‘cm do it.” 
And toward the end, I really felt some resolution, that a lot of these issues had 
been resolved. I felt pretty good. The diary that I wrote that I had, which is in the book, 
the Civil Rights Journey book—. It’s actually in the diary, that all of this soul-searching, 
the diary has all of this soul-searching in it of, “Why are we here? Why? We don’t —. 
People don’t want us here. We’re risking our lives. What are doing? We’re not making- 
-.” Plus it was hard, with these kids in Head Start. Many of these kids had very tough 
childhoods. They couldn’t do some of those basic things you would expect a five-year- 
31 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
old to be able to do, and so we were—. A lot of discipline issues. So all of that stuff was 
going on. And then the weather was hot, and there was no air conditioning [laughs] 
anywhere. But it was an extraordinary experience, though. And it, I think, changed 
everybody on both sides. And I’ll tell you, the other side of it here. We were changed by 
the whole family, and by the people that we got to know in profound ways, and 
respected, and I love these individuals as well as others we didn’t know as well, and 
primarily on that one little street. And it felt like family, but we didn’t know, really, what 
kind of impact we were making. And you never really know what kind of impact you’re 
making. You just do it because it’s the right thing to do. 
So we reconnect with the boys, who are now in their fifties and sixties, at the 
event, reunion, which you were at. And we went to visit—. We met both of them. 
Nathaniel had remarried and had a good government job with the Albany—. State 
government in Albany. “Al-binney.” And we were trying to track down Jackie, and we 
couldn’t do it, because he had gone back to his real name, Noah. So, we had no idea 
what had happened to him, but finally, we found out that we didn’t have his name right. 
And so, he had now retired and moved back to Albany, and lived in a very attractive 
house in a subdivision; a very attractive subdivision. Middle class, definitely solid 
middle class, and he had married and met his wife. 
He was one of the first kids to go to the white school, integrated school, and then 
had gone to a traditional African American college in Texas. A church school. I think it 
was called Trinity, I guess a Methodist affiliation. Met his wife, his then-wife. I mean, 
his wife, the woman who became his wife. They ended up going to California. And she 
got—. His wife got an MBA from Stanford. And he got a master’s in finance from 
32

Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
Stanford. She ended up being the head of Blue Cross Blue Shield Bay Area, and he 
ended up being the COO, Chief Operating Officer and president of the largest railroad in 
California. 
DC : Which one was that? 
JH: I mean, what an incredible success story. I mean, to think that his parents 
were basically—. Jack was completely illiterate. And Divina was close. And the fact 
that they were able to make that jump in that generation, basically says it all about what 
the Civil Rights Movement accomplished, and while it didn’t [55:00]—. A rising tide 
doesn’t lift all ships at the same speed, their lives would be profoundly different, had not 
the Civil Rights Movement occurred. I mean, profoundly different. And as we were 
leaving their house, after all the good-byes, we’d had the lemonade and some cookies. 
And they said, “But, Joe, I just have to tell you one thing.” And I said, “What is that?” 
And he turned to me, “If it hadn’t been for you—,” he looked at me, but I know he meant 
all of us, “If it hadn’t been for you, I never would have done what I did. You gave me 
faith in myself, and you gave me faith that white people were not all bad, and I attribute 
to you the fact that my life has been the success that it’s been.” I was just overcome. 
Speechless. Everybody else was, too. [Laughs] Ashley’s wife, Susan, “Well, that was 
some accolade, [laughs] Joe.” And I said, “Who—.” 
You never know. And I think the lesson here is—. And this is a universal human 
sort of lesson, that you never know what kind of influence you have on somebody else. 
And you think of your own life, of people that have influenced you in profound ways, 
that you’ve never able to express. Teachers, perhaps, or others, what kind of influence 
they’ve had on your life. That this is the way the world is, that maybe you can pass it on 
33 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
to somebody else, but this was a rare instance where you actually got some feedback that 
you’d made a difference, and it justified all the pain—quote, “pain and suffering” that— 
little letters, because it was not great pain and great suffering, by any means, but certainly 
issues that we were dealing with. All that was justified many times over just for that one 
story, just, I was just completely—. [Laughs] Completely overwhelmed when I heard 
that. I still am. Because he and his wife had been so successful. They both won, in 
different, years, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award for Accomplishment, in the whole 
Bay Area. We’re not talking about—. Which is a huge honor. So, there you go. What a- 
-. Talk about a success story, which I played a small role in, but it turned out to be a 
bigger role than I would have ever imagined. So you just—. 
DC: And this is another argument for the power of being present, right? Of 
being—? 
JH: That’s right. That’s exactly right. There are certain times just being there 
is what counts. You don’t have to do anything, it’s just being there that makes a 
difference, in profound ways that we don’t fully understand. 
DC: Mm-hmm. It’s interesting, too, because you were—. We talked a little bit 
about you coming down to Southwest Georgia, and meeting Sherrod at Union Seminary. 
But that was all part of a little-known civil rights project called the Student Interracial 
Ministry, right? 
JH: Right. 
DC: And the Student Interracial Ministry was about, initially, sending black 
seminarians to work in white churches, and vice versa. And then it got more radical and 
more direct action-focused, over the years. And I’ve read, you know, in some of the 
34 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
journals, there’s this complaint, at a certain point, maybe around [19]65 or [19]66, when 
you’re there, you know, “Why aren’t we out in the streets?” 
JH: That’s right. 
DC: “We’re not where the action is.” 
JH: That’s right, that’s right. 
DC: Right? And yet, what you’re talking about isn’t the action, as we think of 
it, but it’s something else that, as I hear you saying, is just, could be vitally important. 
JH: Well, that’s right. I looked at us sort of as foot soldiers. And I never 
looked at myself as being an activist. I never looked at myself as being a radical, or 
anything like that, or even a leader in any cause, particularly. I mean, a bleeding heart, 
yes. But we were just really foot soldiers. But that’s what counts. That’s when it—. 
When you get people like me and Embry involved, that’s when you’ve tipped the 
balance, you know? [Laughs] When you’re getting the average person on board is when 
you’re successful, I think, in terms of the movement. And it was a brief period in time, 
because just think, by [19]68, that’s when everybody was getting killed. Kennedy was 
killed, King was killed. Bobby was killed, and the Black Panther movement then took 
over SNCC, basically. SNCC I think folded in [19]68, or close to it, and it all became 
Black Panther stuff. And so, this was just a brief, just a three- or four-year window, 
where the cause was right. I mean, it was still non-violent, and non-violence was a big 
thing. 
I remember, at one point, when we were in Southwest Georgia, some guy reaches 
in—. A black guy reaches in his pocket—. [As] a matter of fact, this was in that 
conference in Jekyll Island—. Pulls out this revolver, fully loaded, and said, “This is 
35 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
where the movement is headed.” I said, “Oh, my God. [Laughs] Fm not interested in 
that!” [He] said, “Well, this is where we’re going.” [He] says, “They’ve been violent to 
us. We’re going to be violent back to them.” 
So this was on the cusp of that change. This was before the big riots. I think 
[1:00:00] Detroit, as I recall, was [19]67, that’s when the first big one—. And then it was, 
Southwest LA was about that time. Newark was about that time. And then the King—, in 
[19]68 when the Washington riots, and all that sort of stuff. The whole—. Everything 
changed. It was a whole different world. But this was when it was still purity in motives. 
There was black and white together, at that point. You really feel like you did make a 
little bit of a difference. You were doing the right thing. It was a no-brainer decision. I 
mean, I described this to our children, who are both—. Have the same—. The right 
values, we think. And our daughter is a schoolteacher, and our son works for a financial 
institution, but does what we call frontier market stuff in Africa primarily, in terms of 
getting investments and stuff there. But they will say, “Well, dad, you know, it was kind 
of easy in your day. The issues were pretty clear-cut.” But now there are economic 
issues, and there are subtle issues, and it’s much more complicated, in terms of how you 
solve these issues, which is certainly the case for us. In this brief moment in time, it was 
innocence. It was purity. It was idealism. 
But it only lasted for a few years before it all began to change with the Black 
Power movement, and the Black Panther movement, and with the Vietnam War. And the 
peace movement then sort of kidnapped the civil rights movement in the late [19]60s, 
early [19]70s. And it had its own life. But all the people that we knew that were 
involved in civil rights were involved in the peace movement, and they were—. I 
36 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
remember Ed Feaver was—. He burned his draft card. Of course, we were all burning 
our draft cards, at Union. Everybody had this guilt trip. Here we are at Union. We’d get 
this deferment, because we’re in graduate school. Where the blue-collar people who 
have to fight this terrible war, and we’re sitting on the sidelines. It’s not right. We’re 
going to burn our draft card. And I said, “Oh, God, we have to—. [Laughs] Do we have 
to burn our draft cards?” “Yeah, we’ve got to burn our draft cards. It’s not fair to get a 
student deferment.” So I said, “I guess you’re right.” 
So I remember coming in and announcing to Embry, “I’ve heard all the issues. 
I’m going to burn my draft card.” She says, “Well, why are you going to burn your draft 
card?” I said, “Because it’s not right to have a student deferment for graduate school 
when everybody else has to go to war, and it’s just immoral to do that.” And she said, 
“Well, wait a minute, you don’t have a student deferment. You’ve got a 4-F, because you 
had polio.” [Laughter] I said, “Oh! Thank heavens!” 
DC: Burn it! [Laughs] 
JH: “Fm not going to burn it! I’m not going to burn that 4-F. I don’t have a 
graduate deferment.” [Laughter] But I mean, we would go down there with them and 
others. They would be down there, spending every weekend at the Draft Board down 
there in Lower Manhattan, and it took a lot of energy out of things. 
But that moment in time with the Civil Rights Movement was just a great time to 
be alive. A great time to be young. And you could see the changes coming, and the 
changes were—. You know, the right changes. And just, what a blessing, just to have the 
opportunity to be a part of that. It was just, I think, an extraordinary luck of timing, and 
being sort of right time, right place. 
37 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
DC: Can you tell us a little bit about what you carried forward from that, as far 
as going to graduate school then, and the book that you worked on that came out of that, 
and then your later career? 
JH: Well, at Union, there’s a lot of angst. People like me and others. At that 
point, it was a depository of sort of smart people that didn’t buy into sort of mainstream 
culture that had no clue as to what they were going to do. They didn’t want to be 
lawyers. They didn’t want to be businesspeople. And I went there on a fellowship, as 
did a whole bunch of people at Union. I think like forty of us, almost every Rockefeller 
Fellowship person went there. But we were all lost souls. And when all is said and done, 
“What are you going to do with your life?” 
And the idea [is], you were supposed to be ordained. I was what was called a 
postulant in the Episcopal Church. I was going to be an ordained Episcopal priest. And I 
was in line for all that. I had a fiery, conservative, feisty bishop, [laughs] whom I 
respected, and he respected me, but what I was doing was just over the top. [Laughs] 
And we had a final resolution of it and he said—. I was taking a year out of school to do 
work in New York in secular jobs, or something like that. And he said, “Well, Joe, you 
know, you can do that. But for every year you’ve gone to this Union Seminary of 
heretics, you’re going to go to a High Church Episcopal seminary in Nashotah House, out 
in Wisconsin, someplace.” Well, that pretty much—. It was [1:05:00] my way out. 
[Laughs] I said, “Well, I’m not going to do that.” 
DC : So then that was going to be the penance you would have to pay? 
JH: That’s right. A year for every year. I mean, he would have let me get off, 
I’m sure, for less. But it was like an albatross that was being lifted—. A burden lifted 
38 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
from my shoulders, in terms of what I was going to —. But I still had to come up with 
something to do, right? And so, city planning just sort of happened, because they had the 
internship in Lower Manhattan for the City Planning Department, and I was working in 
Bushwick in housing issues grassroots, and it was really interesting. And so, I applied to 
go to planning school. But then you come out of planning, and then you still—. You 
know, what are you going to do with that? 
One thing I haven’t talked about that I think is actually fairly significant is, in my 
last year in planning school, which was 1970, one of my professors got a grant to study 
lower income, working-class white people. And they picked out the census tract in the 
Mid-Atlantic with the lowest income that was 100 percent white—. Almost 100 percent 
white. And they were looking for a participant-observer to keep the research honest. It 
was a National Institute of Mental Health grant. And I was selected to do that job. So 
Embry and I lived there in 1970 in Mount Rainier, Maryland. And these were white 
working-class families that we got to know. It was very similar to the Southwest Georgia 
project, in many respects. 
And I ended up writing a book about that experience, and it was published by 
Doubleday in 1973, and it’s still in print. It’s been in continuous print, and has sold 
several hundred-thousand copies, and it’s still used in colleges. 
DC : And the name—? 
JH: It’s called Hard Living on Clay Street. And that was really—. I mean, in 
terms of what my contribut—. And that was a very similar experience, in terms of what I 
would call acceptance of people where they are. Non-judgmental acceptance. In this 
case, [it was] white working-class families that were struggling with all these issues of 
39 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
health, and alcoholism, and family relationships. And I basically just wrote up a story of 
the lives of two primary families, the Shacklefords and the Mosbys [?]. So, I had that 
experience right after the planning graduate school. 
DC: Where were the white families, where were they from, primarily? 
JH: Primarily Appalachia. It was West Virginia, Southern Maryland, which is, 
you know, not the eastern shore part, but down in St. Mary’s County, Calvert County. 
And we’ve maintained relationships sort of now, because most of the people we knew are 
dead. They all die young. I mean, I remember this one guy, who I’ve got his photograph 
over there, [as] a matter of fact, that died at age sixty-four, and he had had diabetes, and a 
lot of health issues. And he said, “God, I never thought I’d live to be this old.” [Laughs] 
Sixty-four. Very old. The matriarch, who lived next door to us, was sort of the 
grandmother of the block, and everybody admired and respected her, but she was a 
chronic alcoholic with sort of low-grade maintenance—. She developed cirrhosis, and 
died in her mid-forties. And that was old! 
They would describe people there as to whether or not they still had their teeth! 
[They’d say], “Oh, George, you know, he’s the one that still has his teeth.” [Laughs] I 
said, “Oh, that was new.” So I had the in. But similar to the civil rights experience, in 
terms of the intercultural experience, but coming out of it with profound respect and love 
for these people. And it just—. 
DC: And similar issues, in some ways, that they were dealing with, in terms of 
entrenched poverty, and—? [Interruption] 
JH: I think I can finish up. But I believe there were profound issues related to, 
primarily to health issues, and Bobby Jean, who was—. All of these were pseudonyms 
40 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
that I used, but she was she was the—. I have a picture of her [inaudible.] She had 
various kinds —. It was not clear exactly what was wrong, but cancer was one of the 
issues. It was never even clear if she even had it or not. But she had something to go to 
the doctor, in and out of the doctor, and just getting to work—. Barry, her husband, was—. 
He was a painter, but he was drunk a good bit of the time, and we’d go on hunting trips. 
One of the highlights of the book was going on a hunting trip, and this coming-of-age 
with his thirteen-year-old, and it was the first time he had been on a hunting trip, deer¬ 
hunting trip, etc. 
But they were so human, and the humanity comes out there. I mean, middle-class 
people tend to sort of put a lid on things and keep everything kind of low-key. All the 
humanity comes out. And it’s true with the black families, too, and there’s nothing that—. 
We are who we are. And there’s nothing that you had to sort of sweep under the rug. 
And so, that had a profound experience. [1:10:00] But I still had to get work. I still had 
to—. So now, I’m still going to—. I have a real job. And the irony is that the first job that 
I got, just was the last job that I wanted. I wanted to work in model cities that was going 
on, with the HUD program. I wanted to continue to do this sort of reform type stuff 
where my heart was, but I couldn’t get a job. They weren’t available, and at least, I 
didn’t get one. In fact, I got turned down on several jobs because I was a little weird. 
I’d written this book, the Clay Street book, and some guy thought it was offensive 
that somebody from Chapel Hill trained in city planning would write a book about 
ordinary people, and without any big profound policy recommendations or something. 
So I got a job with a commercial real estate consulting company. Which I just bit my 
teeth at—. I bit my tongue. The guy that interviewed me said, “Joe, I’m interviewing you 
41 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
for a job, an entry-level job. Fm thirty-one. And Fm executive vice president of this 
company. And you’re thirty. Buddy, you’ve got a long way to go to catch up.” [Laughs] 
Which I openly did. But I learned—. Oddly, I learned the tricks of the trade. I learned 
how to do market analysis and financial analysis and all this other stuff that I didn’t get at 
planning school. [Break in audio] 
What I was able to do is take those skills that I had learned on the job with this 
company and use those to focus on building affordable housing and seniors housing. 
And I was actually a developer of Section 8 HUD housing for a really good company 
called the National Housing Partnership, and did that for three years. So I really learned 
how to do the real estate development piece. But instead of building condominiums, and 
offices, it was all affordable housing, and mainly low-income seniors housing. 
And then I built a little company up. I had about twenty-five employees over the 
twenty-year history of providing technical services to developers of affordable housing, 
seniors housing, and expanded out to market-rate seniors housing, which was actually 
where the money was in the business of what’s called continuing care retirement 
communities, independent, skilled, assisted. And we became sort of a niche company 
that was one of a handful of companies that would do this sort of thing. And I just loved 
it. It was fun, it was entrepreneurial. I mean, I liked the business part of it. You know, 
we were not building nuclear weapons, or chemical weapons, or any of that sort of stuff. 
[Laughs] We were helping people. 
So I feel like I was so blessed to have had that experience to do what I really 
loved, and to have the independence and the entrepreneurial aspect of it, I just loved that. 
And then I sold the company in 1998, and then became an independent advisor for about 
42 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
ten years, or ten to twelve years. And did some teaching in Maryland, at George 
Washington. I was an adjunct professor. In the honors college at GW, and a lecturer in 
the School of Public Policy in Maryland. And I taught a course on affordable housing 
and urban development issues with honors students in GW. I just loved it. [I] did that for 
six or seven years. And then, I had to re-tool a course, and I just didn’t have the energy 
to do that. And I had a sailboat [laughs] that I’d bought in the British Virgin Islands, 
where spring and fall sailing is the best. And part of a charter fleet. 
And so I decided to quit the GW piece and then the consulting piece sort of 
wound down. So for the last several years, I do a lot of board work. I’m on four 
affordable housing boards, and one continuous care retirement community board. So I’m 
doing the same thing that I was doing before professionally, except instead of receiving 
checks, I’m writing them. What is wrong with this picture? [Laughs] Right? So--. But I 
love it. And then there are these diverse boards, racially diverse boards in Washington, 
which is more of a rarity than it should be. And so I just really enjoy that work now. 
DC: I think this is one of the—. To me, one of the really interesting stories of 
the civil rights movement, and people who were involved in it, is, you know, the 
movement obviously—. The movement did not come with a pension plan. So you have 
to go out and make the living, and—. 
JH: That’s right! 
DC : And yet, how do you do so in a way that you can live with? 
JH: That’s right. 
DC : And do good work, and yet, have a life? 
43 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
JH: Right. Oh, yeah. I could not have ever asked anything better. I mean, 
how lucky can you get, in a way. And Embry is the same way. She got a master’s in 
public —. Well, actually, her master’s was from the School of Public Health and 
Demographics—. Or not demographics. I’ve forgotten. Something like that. It was 
mainly statistics, anyway. And then, [she] got a PhD in public policy from GW, and has 
worked for the Urban Institute for the last ten or fifteen years, and then other similar 
[1:15:00] companies before that, doing studies related to healthcare and related to helping 
poor people. And so, we’ve both been lucky. And she’s actually still—. She officially 
retired last year, but she now is a contract employee, and she’s working a couple of days 
a week, but a little bit more flexibility. So that has given us some more time. And we 
just completed an around-the-world trip this summer, four months. No airplanes. So we 
had to cross two oceans, one on a cruise ship, and another on a container ship. [We] took 
a railroad train all the way across Siberia. I’m in the process of putting together a book. 
I had a blog, and she had a diary. I’m going to combine the diary and the blog and see if 
I can—. I don’t think I will self-publish this one, but I’m going to at least try to see if I 
can— 
DC: Wonderful. 
JH: —see if I can store up some interest. I had a good number of followers for 
the blog. So that gives us the time to do travel. We’re going to do a road trip next 
summer, all across the US, and stop and see friends. It will be about a two-month trip. 
So yeah, we’ve been very lucky. 
DC: You’re having fun. 
JH: Yes. 
44 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
DC: Yeah, yeah. 
JH: We’ re very, very lucky. 
DC : Can I—. And we talked about it a little bit, but if I could ask you to talk a 
little bit just again about what it was like—. I think it was 2009, going back to Southwest 
Georgia, what it was like seeing what had changed there, over those many years? 
JH: Well, you know, the interesting thing is, Baker County—, I think Baker 
County had something like 3,500 people when we were there. Well, it‘s down to like 
3,000 today. It’s fewer people than now than had been by a somewhat significant 
percentage. And Newton, Georgia has disappeared, the capital, the county seat of Baker 
County, had got washed out in a flood. And there’s nothing there, except this one 
building that they restored, the courthouse. That’s it. It’s really bizarre. It’s like a ghost 
town. And then there’s a little bit of—. There’s a tiny little shopping center that they 
built up that’s awful. 
And the Holt’s house has disappeared, and sort of fallen into disrepair, as have all 
the other houses on that street. I think. But also, some of the houses that are close by, are 
much nicer. The brick houses, and their new houses. And someone was telling us—. 
I’ve forgotten who it was that we were talking to there, that the white people now are 
leasing land from them, rather than where it used to be. So, it’s just, it’s a huge change, 
in a lot of respects. Although, not as much in terms of governance. I think they had one 
or two people on the county council there that were black, but it still is dominated by a 
white population. 
So I’m sure there are issues. Schools are going to be an issue. But generally 
speaking, a vast improvement. Ichauway Plantation, which was then—. The Woodruff 
45 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
family had that one, 40,000 acres. And the Mellon family had the Pinelands that they 
were—. Had the tenant farmers, and all that stuff. Well, Ichauway is now a non-profit 
that’s an ecological thing. And it’s like a park. Pinelands, the Mellon family, may still 
be there, but you know, it’s probably somewhat different, but certainly there have been 
changes. 
Albany, of course, now has black people running that city. Harlem is—. In my 
recollection, we went by there to look at that—. It [has] pretty much disappeared. The 
Holt, quote-unquote, “boys,” because they were boys at the time, live in very nice houses. 
So all that’s—. There have been steps forward. The Civil Rights Museum, which was 
interesting. The people we work with, some of them, they had not been in that museum 
because of a dispute. Did you know that? 
DC: Hm. 
JH: They were—. Something that—. Something had happened that they felt 
like they had gotten short shrift on it. So they just refused to go into that museum. But it 
was a great museum. And I don't know what the issues were, but [laughs] hopefully, they 
would have gotten over that. And because of a lot of ego was involved. So it was great, 
catching up with friends like Ed Feaver, who was a very close friend, and David 
Campbell and others, and Joe Pfister. He looked like Jeremiah, or something. He had 
this very white beard. Of course, he tragically died too young. But it was a wonderful 
experience, to sort of—. 
And they’ve all done interesting things. And you’ve interviewed many of them, 
and have had interesting lives. So it was a great time in history for somebody to have this 
opportunity to get involved in something bigger than yourself that was going—. And 
46 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0133 
12/13/2015 
Joseph Howell, Embry Howell 
something that [1:20:00] you knew was the right direction, even though it got us dirty. I 
mean, every revolution is. But people weren’t getting killed like they did in the Russian 
Revolution, or French Revolution, or the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and so on. So, we 
were, I think, very, very fortunate. 
DC: Well, great. Anything that I didn’t ask you today that I should have asked, 
or anything else that we should cover? 
JH: Well, I think you’ve got a pretty full picture. I mean, I’m honored, and I 
know Embry is, too, that we’re included in this. It’s a great thing. I’m delighted that the 
Smithsonian is--. I mean, the Library of Congress. It was--. 
DC: Both. 
JH: Yeah, both are doing this. It’s terrific. And then, there the great stories to 
be told. It was a great time in American History. I think the concern I’ve got now is that 
we could be moving in very, very dangerous with the undercurrent of hate and fear that 
people have, that Trump has tapped into. If that gets out of hand, we could find ourselves 
in a very, very different situation. And that’s the scary part about the times we’re in 
today. 
And you think about my children. They are both set into doing great things, but 
our grandchildren, they’ve got to deal with this global warming stuff. I mean, when they 
get in their forties and fifties, they’re going to see it. And even before then. So, we live 
in a very fragile planet, and the stakes are very, very high. So you cross your fingers and 
say your prayers. But at least we got something out of the Paris talks that looks like it’s a 
good start. And I think the next election will also be very critical. So [we’ll see] what 
happens.

EH: [Inaudible] 
DC : So yeah, can I ask you just a little bit more to talk about the Sherrods then. 
You know, at that period. I guess you knew Shirley already? And—. 
JH: We did not know Shirley at that time very well. 
DC: Oh, you didn’t know her? She was very young then. Right. 
JH: But you know, we haven’t kept up with the Sherrods very much. I mean, 
we saw them there, and then they had a book talk here. She did, after her book. And met 
them at Busboys and Poets for dinner. I think she was doing a book talk there. And so 
we reconnected then. 
And of course, Charlie’s got some health issues that he’s dealing with now. He’s 
slowed down, as we all have. I mean, Charlie’s probably a couple of years older than I 
am, maybe five years. I mean, he’s got to be late-seventies, I think. I gather, their kids 
have done pretty well. They’ve got good jobs, good solid jobs. But Charlie has this 
charisma, and he always will. And he’s a great singer. I mean, you have to audition to 
work for Charlie. [Laughter] 
DC : Do you remember when you were at Union, do you remember hearing him 
sing there? Because I’ve heard stories about—. 
JH: I remember it, yeah. 
DC : He would break into freedom song in the—. 
JH: That’s right. I mean, he had a great voice. And a great singer. It seemed 
like everybody did! Of course, the Freedom Singers were from Albany. There’s where it 
all started. And that morphed into Sweet Honey in the Rock, which is up here in 
Washington, but they all started there.

And no, he was, I mean, some of the leaders there just were extraordinary people 
in the civil rights movement. They were smart. That’s what I didn’t realize. When I was 
writing the book, the Civil Rights Journey, it forced me to go back and do a little 
research. I realized how little that I actually knew what was going on. I mean, we just 
sort of did it. But I didn’t know about all the stuff that had happened in Nashville. And 
the fact that all this stuff—. You know, Rosa Parks, and this. It was not spontaneous. 
She was interviewed—. You had interviews for the job, and training. [Laugher] 
Everything was carefully thought out, in terms of what would have impact. 
Remember the Birmingham Children’s March, or whatever it was, that got all the kids in 
the schools involved? And they knew they were going to fill up the jails, and then they 
knew that Bull Connor would go for the bait, and loose the Police dogs and the fire 
hydrants. Staged! It was not spontaneous. I didn’t realize that. But a lot of smart 
people, strategizing, “When’s the right time going to be?” And then bringing in others 
like us, foot soldiers, to help implement that. There was spontaneity, but it was a lot of 
careful planning, and that goes along with any quote-unquote “revolution.” This really 
was a revolution. 
DC : So, did you know that at the time? Or was that with hindsight that— 
JH: No! 
DC: —that Sherrod was very—. Had recruited you for a purpose? 
JH: Well, I knew we were being recruited for a purpose, but it wasn’t like 
exploiting us, or anything. I mean, he was still—. But he was of the John Lewis 
mentality, in terms of having white people there. I mean, COFO’s summer, which we 
were—. I was recruited for COFO’s summer, and I was glad I didn’t do that one. I mean,

that was—. You know, when the [1:25:00] three young people were killed, the young 
men were killed at the very beginning of that summer—. And A1 Lowenstein had 
recruited me for that, but I actually had a summer job. I had an excuse not to do that. 
And that was [19]64, so that was two years before that. 
But I frankly think that Sherrod didn’t have it all, by any means. I mean, he was 
working from his gut. He was working from his intuition. And he knew that the struggle 
was going on with Stokely Carmichael, and I’m not sure that he knew how exactly he 
was going to come out on it. But I thought he was probably winging it. A lot of it. He 
was winging it. But his instincts were right. And he got good people, and he was in a 
difficult situation, sort of balancing all this without anything getting out in the open. And 
so, this was all sort of—. Behind-the-scenes stuff was going on. And I was not aware of 
that until after the fact. 
And I wasn’t aware of a lot of stuff that had gone on. 
DC: Right. And then he stayed for years and years, and saw great changes 
there. 
JH: 
DC: 
JH: 
DC: 
wanted to—? 
JH: 
DC: 
That’s right. 
Yeah, yeah. 
So it’s a great story. 
Yeah. Any other questions? Let’s wrap it up, then. Anything else you 
I think I’m pretty much—. 
Great.

JH: [Laughs] It’s not often that you get a chance to say whatever is on your 
mind, but I really appreciate it. 
DC : Well, then it’s just left to me to say thank you, because that was terrific, 
and we really appreciate your time, and Embry’s time. 
JH: Well, it was absolutely—. We’re really honored. 
F : This has been a presentation of the Library of Congress and the 
Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.
