Blia Schwahn Interview Index 
00:00:00 Ruth Olsen in Eau Claire talking with Blia Vang Schwahn on October 17, 2014.
Was born in Laos and was a product of the Vietnam War. When she was 10, in 1975, the Hmong 
helped the Americans in the Vietnam War. After the war ended, many Hmong who helped with 
the war were persecuted. When Blia was 10 her family escaped to Thailand, crossing the 
Mekong River in a small fishing boat. Lived in a refugee camp for five years before coming to 
the US. Came to the US in 1979. First came to a small town in Illinois. When first came to 
refugee camp, people had to apply to go to another country. You have to fill out all these papers, 
and send your picture, and during that time people could apply to go to Canada, Australia, South 
America or to the US. The majority of the Hmong people wanted to come to the US because 
America was their ally in the war. So Blia’s family waited for a long time to apply to come here. 
They had to wait for someone to be willing to sponsor them, to help them find housing, make 
sure they go to school and get training they need to learn English, and to help them find work. 
Catholic Charities was greatly involved in the effort to resettle Hmong refugees, so Blia’s 
family’s sponsor was a church in Kankakee, Illinois. 
Blia was 15, didn’t speak any English, she remembers landing at O’Hare airport in flipflops and 
a sweater in December. Kankakee is close to Joliet. Because she didn’t speak English at all, she 
was placed in 6th grade. They lived there until the end of the following spring, then moved to 
Eau Claire because there was a larger Hmong population here. In Eau Claire, there were ESL 
programs, and other Hmong families had been there since 1976, so could get a little support. In 
Kankakee, she was the only Asian person and they had never heard of the Hmong. She would 
cry several times before the day was over. When they got to Eau Claire, having other Hmong 
here really helped. She has been here ever since. 
00:05:41  
Has been in Eau Claire since 1980. Came from a family of 5. 3 older sisters, 1 
older brother. Two older sisters were married, so didn’t come with rest of family, but Blia came 
with older brother and 1 older sister from Laos to refugee camp in Thailand. Then they both got 
married. Brother came with his wife to Michigan, and sister got married and had to stay behind 
with her husband’s family in the refugee camp. So just Blia and her parents came to Illinois. 
Once they came to Eau Claire, her sister and husband came to Colorado, and then everybody 
came to Eau Claire to be together. Then Blia’s older sister came to California and stayed there, 
and her second oldest sister stayed in Laos. Her husband escaped to the refugee camp without 
her, and when he went back to get her he was captured and put in a re-education camp, and he 
died in the labor camp. But in the 1980s, that sister and her daughter escaped to Thailand and the 
family was later able to get them to America, so Blia has 2 sisters and a brother here in the Eau 
Claire area. It’s wonderful they were all able to come here and find work. All of them work for 
the school system. They have been interpreters and bilingual instructors for the school system for 
the last 20-30 years. Unfortunately, both her parents have passed away, mom in 2003 and dad in 
2006. The siblings were all able to come to the US in the 1980s, so her parents were able to see 
their grandkids and help raise them. It was difficult for them because they came in old age and 
never learned English. They were farmers, so it was difficult for them to get work here. They 
made a huge sacrifice to bring their kids to the US. 
00:10:25  
Did the support she received from ESL program and Hmong community in Eau 
Claire affect her decision to get a job in the school district? Definitely. Her experience in Illinois, 
where no one understood her, also caused her to want to become an educator to help those 
students.

And in Eau Claire, having teachers who encouraged her and inspired her made her want to help 
students. Plus, in the Hmong culture they value educators very highly, and so if you have a 
teacher in your family you have done well. Her parents had no education, they were farmers and 
so they really wanted her to be a teacher. Her father’s dream was that she would get her teaching 
degree, and some day they would be able to go back to Laos and teach Hmong students. Even 
when she was a little child, she knew they had to leave Laos because it wasn’t safe, but there was 
the perception that eventually they could go back and start their life over again. The older 
generation was hopeful for that, and they wanted their children to get a good education so they 
could go back and live a better life and help Hmong people. Her parents never got to go back for 
a visit. Because they couldn’t speak English, it took them a long time to earn their citizenship, 
and so their first twenty years here, it was really just survival. They focused on taking care of the 
grandchildren so their children could go to school and get an education. By the time that had 
happened, they were much older. Her mother never talked about wanting to go back but her 
father always did. Even though he came here to America, he never felt welcome, because he 
didn’t drive, he didn’t speak. He couldn’t sit still, he always had to move around, so he walked 
all over Eau Claire and met with a lot of racial things. People would honk at him, scream at him, 
call him names, sometimes spit at him. He got to the point where he said America is not my 
home, it’s your home, but I want to go back to Laos. It was very sad, because I was happy but I 
could see the sadness in my father’s eyes. In his heart he was yearning for his home, where he 
was accepted and knew what to do and how to fix things. It was really hard for him and for a lot 
of Hmong men his age. In 2000, he got his citizenship, and he hoped to go home and visit 
relatives he still had there, but he got sick very quickly and was diagnosed with cancer and 
within three months passed away. His children asked him if he wanted to buried in America or if 
he wanted them to take his body back to Laos to be buried. Blia thinks that getting his citizenship 
really helped him, so he said he thought it was okay for him to be buried here because he was an 
American. So, his kids would have a place to go and visit him when they missed him.  
00:15:55  
It was good closure for both of them to get their citizenship. And her mom was 
able to go to South America to visit her brother, and he was able to come here to visit her when 
she got sick. So many families were separated, and ended up all over the world. Some went back 
to China, some went to Australia, some to South America, some came here. There was a lot of 
first immigration, second immigration, just to be able to find your family.  A lot went to France. 
Both of Blia’s oldest sisters went back to visit, her brother and other sister went back once. They 
actually went to Thailand and were able to cross over to Laos and visit. But Blia hasn’t. When 
she left, she was 10 years old and the experience of trying to escape, and the threat of being 
killed or being put in a labor camp, made her feel like why would she want to go back to a place 
that didn’t want her and didn’t want her to leave either. For Blia, a lot of those memories are still 
back in her head and she had no urge to go. But she’d like to go someday and take her children 
there to show them the place she was born, and help Hmong people in the village her family was 
from, to help fulfill her father’s dream and her own. She doesn’t think she could survive living 
there now, but so much has changed now.  
00:20:55  
Blia’s mother would say that for this kind of conversation, three days might be 
too long, but two days is not enough. When Blia came to the US and was placed in 6th grade, she 
had to learn by cutting pictures out of magazines. It was winter, so her vocabulary was “mittens” 
“hat” “scarf” “boot.” It was very difficult. One day she went home to her mother and said “I

promise to be your slave, just don’t make me go to school.” Her mother told her, “You have to 
go to school because your father and I are too old and you have to learn the language so you can 
be our eyes and our ears and our mouths. We can’t do that anymore. We could do that in Laos 
for you but here in America we cannot, so you have to go back to school.” So Blia kept going 
back to school and kept crying, day after day. 
Once they moved to Eau Claire, and there were other kids like her, she learned faster and learned 
to write her ABCs. Then she went on to high school. It was still difficult; they learned very basic 
language. When she opened a biology book she had no idea what they were talking about. Her 
best subject was spelling. In choir, she had no idea because she didn’t speak English, but she 
loved it. Just by memorizing, she sang. She knew in high school she wanted to go to college. But 
she wasn’t ready; they say you need 7-8 years to be adequate in English to be successful 
academically. She went to UW-Eau Claire, and even then she took a lot of English classes. She 
remembers telling people she wanted to be a teacher and they would look at her and say “We 
don’t think you’re ready to be a teacher yet.” So much to learn. She really struggled, and realized 
that maybe she had to wait awhile. She started working as an interpreter for clinics around town. 
During that time, her parents weren’t working and they were still receiving assistance. She could 
help take care of them while working as an interpreter. Then she learned while interpreting. Then 
she got a job for the Menominee area school district as a bilingual specialist, to work with 
Hmong students, and with their ESL teacher. Working with the kids, she taught herself reading, 
writing, math, science. Did that for a while, and some of the teachers encouraged her to get a 
teaching degree because she was good at it. She told them she wanted to, but the language was 
hard enough, not to mention the math and science. 
00:26:10  
She kept doing what she was doing. Then she got married and had a child, and 
working full time as a bilingual aide. She started taking one class at a time. She went back to 
UW-Eau Claire and took night classes. It was hard to work in Menominee and take classes in 
Eau Claire, so she transferred her credits to [University of Wisconsin in Menominee] Stout. She 
started to be more hopeful. She started to take more summer classes. She worked full time and 
went to school part time for 7 years and got her teaching degree in early childhood education. 
She thought that would be the time when she had the most influence on children’s minds. When 
they get to high school, they have their minds set already. She was able to graduate in 2000. It 
took her a long time but she felt that was the best gift she gave herself. She couldn’t have done it 
without the help of her parents and family. She came to the US at such an older age; they say the 
window closes at a certain point. Whatever it takes a normal person to learn, she has to read over 
twice. She had to put in a lot of extra time but she is so glad she did it. She wouldn’t change 
anything at all. Her children are very proud that their mother was able to graduate from college; 
they learned that you have to work very hard for the things that you want.  
00:29:00  
Coming to the U.S. gave her the opportunity. She still can’t believe it. People say 
to her, “We don’t know how you did it!” and she says, “I don’t know how I did it either!” You 
are on a path, and you just keep moving, keep pushing, keep going. When she graduated, she had 
a job offer from Menominee but by then she lived in Eau Claire and her children went to the Eau 
Claire school district. The job she currently is in was open, because at that time there were a lot 
of issues between the Hmong community and the school district with dealing with some of the 
Hmong kids because during the late 90s to early 2000s there were gang issues and a lot of fights. 
So, the district and the Hmong community came together and were able to create her position, 
called School Community Liaison, to provide services for Hmong students. Hmong students are

her number one priority, and that includes, social, emotional, psychological, cultural, academic 
help, special education and all those areas. If there is a special case where they aren’t really sure 
and they have questions, they consult with her to try to figure it out and go from there. They also 
look at programs that will help improve academic performance. They work a lot with post-
secondary education, to help them access opportunities. She works with Hmong students, their 
families, their teachers, administrators, post-secondary—it just goes on and on. 
She loves her job. She gets to teach Hmong history and culture and also gets to teach Hmong 
parents what American culture and the school system is like. Typically, she gets to teach Hmong 
history and culture for something like a Staff Development Day, or when there is an opportunity. 
She would love to be able to teach it for a semester because there is a need. Their district has 
over 1,000 Hmong students, about 10% of the population. They are the largest minority in the 
Eau Claire district. Blia knows the Hmong students need to have a Hmong culture and language 
class because, as research shows, if a student appreciates who they are, they will typically do 
better in school if they have a good understanding of who they are. The high school students she 
works with tell her they want to learn how to read and write in Hmong, want to understand why 
their parents came to Eau Claire. Many of the kids don’t know how and why their parents came, 
maybe because a lot of the parents feel uncomfortable sharing their experience, or it’s not just 
something they sit down and tell their children, unless the children really want to know and ask 
them. Blia just touches the surface of the history and culture; it’s amazing, because the Hmong 
came to this country because of a secret war. 
Not many people know that the Hmong worked with the CIA. In the 1980s, you’d hear about 
Vietnam and Cambodia, but you never heard about the Hmong people. So when they came, 
people asked who are the Hmong people and why are they here? Even today there are a lot of 
people who don’t know about the Hmong or their history, and the fact that the Hmong were 
allies, and during the war many died, and they came here because if they didn’t they would be 
killed or persecuted. They didn’t have a choice. They didn’t just say, I’m going to take my 
family and go to this unknown place and learn this unknown language. Sure, it’s better here but 
they struggled a lot to get to the point to say “I’m okay now.” 
00:35:55 
Usually when she teaches Hmong parents about American culture, it’s on a parent 
night or something like that. She explains what the school system is like, the different parts of it, 
and how to get the things they need. Also, when the student goes on to high school, she tells the 
parents what they should be aware of, what a class looks like, the cultural differences. In Hmong 
culture, the parents believe the school is responsible for teaching and disciplining the children; 
they think that they don’t know what is good or not good for the children, the teachers are the 
experts in what the child needs to learn. So, the parents’ thought is that as long as they provide 
food and shelter and get them to school, they should be fine. Then if the school calls them and 
says, “Your child is not doing well, we’d like you to come in and talk about how we can make it 
better,” the parents say “I don’t know! You are supposed to know!” They are really polite and 
trust the school totally. Often Blia has to explain that it is like a three-legged table: there is the 
home, the school and the student, and they all have a part in making education successful for the 
child. She has to explain to the parents that they have a voice, and they can come in and talk 
about it. When Blia started, the parents of the Hmong students were her generation. So now, 
Blia’s children are high school students and they are the first generation [first generation to be 
born in the United States]. In the elementary school, the Hmong students may now be second 
generation [to be born in the United States], and there might be a few third generation. The

Hmong are still a very young group of refugees. 
A lot of the time, people like to label them as immigrants, and Blia corrects them: not 
immigrants, refugees. There is a big difference. Refugees came because they had to, and came 
not prepared. Immigrants came because they wanted a better life and wanted more to assimilate 
into the white culture. While for the Hmong, they came here but don’t want to give up their 
culture and who they are, and so it’s harder for them to assimilate into the larger community. 
They try to interact and do things with the larger community, but the Hmong also still have a 
very strong community, and still practice Hmong culture and many still speak Hmong at home. 
Now Blia sees a lot of young people who speak 
“Hmonglish.” 
00:40:00  
They will say something in English and then quickly add Hmong to it, or say 
something in Hmong and add an English word. The Hmong language is a very simple, basic 
communication tool and doesn’t have the terminology that English has. Now a lot of Hmong 
scholars are trying to build that terminology, for the future, because it is very hard to translate 
English into Hmong without using English words. You end up trying to describe it rather than 
translate it, trying to get the idea across. Even Hmong parents who went through the school 
system themselves don’t always know how the school system works. Blia herself is still 
learning: “Really? I didn’t know--!” “We always talk about being bi-cultural and being 
culturally competent, and I think for a lot of Hmong families, they are here in America; they are 
expected to know both cultures, but I don’t think they have enough opportunity to be in the white 
culture to be competent or to be really understanding exactly what it’s like to be in a larger 
community and the kind of lifestyle they have, and all the institutions, how do they function, the 
systems that they have in the school district. And so, they may only be able to learn what they 
experienced themselves, but if they didn’t they have no idea.” Because there is a strong Hmong 
community, they will probably just go back and speak in their own language and practice their 
own culture. And then when their kids come to school, they will continue to need support. Blia 
suggests that it might be the same for some Hispanic students, who because of their culture may 
continue to need support in school. 
00:43:35  
A typical day. Every day is not the same for Blia, each is very different. She 
works with the whole school district, over 1000 students, and each day there are needs from 
students, parents, staff, administrators, student service specialists, and also community agencies. 
For example, today, first thing in the morning she met with a student who as a senior has 
questions on what to do next. Blia’s work day starts at 7:35 am until 3:30 pm. Same schedule as 
the teachers. But unlike the teachers, Blia works when she is needed, she might be with a student 
until a teacher comes, or the principal might call and say I don’t know if this is part of your job 
but can you help me figure this out, so it is many things that fit together. She also meets with 
other people who will be doing presentations to staff, so that if it is something that involves 
Hmong culture and Blia can’t be there, she can give them ideas. Her job is everything under the 
sun. She focuses a lot on the academic, helping students succeed in school, and then a certain 
amount on activities, if students want to participate in something at school and the parents don’t 
understand. She can explain to the parents that such activities are not just playing, but an 
important part of the experience of the student, that colleges look for those types of activities. 
There are 22 schools in the district. Blia’s office is at North High School and she travels to other 
schools, also tries to do some things over the phone or on email because it’s hard to find time to 
meet with teachers. But she does travel if there is a meeting set up or home visits or things like 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

that. Not all the schools have Hmong students, although most of them do. Some have a larger 
number. She is housed at North High School because it has the largest population, between 240-
260 Hmong students. When she was hired around 2000, they wanted her place her at the board 
office, and just have her go out to the schools, but she felt she needed to be in the place where 
the majority of the Hmong students were so she could build a relationship with them. The 
families know that is where they can find her.  
00:48:45  
She asked to have two phone lines. One line is just for her, and the other one she 
calls “Hmong Line” and Hmong parents can call that line. It has a message recorded in Hmong, 
telling them to leave a message for her about any concern. She hopes the district will give her a 
cell phone eventually [laughing] “…but they say, ‘no, you’re not worth it yet.’ Just kidding.” 
When you work with the Hmong community, they don’t know that you just work from 7:30 to 
3:30. When they see you at the market, they want to talk about their issues. It never ends—you 
go to church, go shopping, go to the restaurant, people always talk to her. Her daughter says, 
“Mom, you should eat your food.” It never ends but she loves it. A lot of the time she says to 
people, “That’s confidential, so we can talk about that when I’m at school. Call me there or 
come and see me.” Because you don’t want everybody to hear those issues. Blia ran into an older 
Hmong man at the farmer’s market last Sunday, a grandfather whose granddaughter was sent to 
live with him from the Cities. He sees Blia at the market and starts yelling to her across a 
number of aisles about why his granddaughter wasn’t in school; Blia had to walk over there and 
talk with him so it wasn’t so public. But that’s normal in the Hmong community. 
00:51:30  
Back to a typical day. After meeting with the student first thing this morning, Blia 
had a call from a mother who was worried about her daughter attending school activities at night; 
then she had to talk to a counselor about a student having cultural issues. Then she had to meet 
with staff who were going to do a presentation for coordinators on Monday about how to 
effectively communicate with Hmong families. After that, a couple more phone calls.  This day 
is an easy day, as it has been more about academic things. Psychological issues can be harder. 
The gang issue that were prevalent when she started have pretty much resolved. She hasn’t seen 
activity for the last three or four years. 
When she started work, it was intimidating to meet with some young Hmong boys with their 
hoods up, all wearing blue or red. One boy she was working with at that time got caught up in 
the middle of a gang fight and he ended up in a wheel chair, paralyzed from the waist down. The 
work today is very light compared to what it was then. She tries to be a voice for the students but 
at the same time support the staff to do what they need to do. She spends about the same amount 
of time with students as she does with parents and staff, because there are so many different 
areas in her work. The majority of her day is spent in English rather than Hmong. The Hmong 
students understand English better. It’s Hmong mostly with the older parents. And sometimes 
she gets confused and starts speaking Hmong to the teachers 
[laughs]. 
00:56:10 
Has racial prejudice gotten better in Eau Claire? If you talked to Blia’s students 
they might say yes, but it is different now. It is about how they are not being addressed. For 
example, in high school, if they are learning about the Vietnam War, the Hmong role is not 
mentioned. Or other students might say words but not directly to the Hmong students, like 
making racist jokes. But not as prevalent as when Blia’s brother and brother-in-law were in 
school, and were being pushed against lockers and called “gooks,” told to go back to their 
country. A lot of awful things. 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers

Today, the Hmong kids speak English so that helps. But prejudice and racism will always exist, 
just at different levels. As each decade goes by, it just takes a different form. Right now, with the 
economy, Blia hears a lot of “they are taking our jobs, they are taking our resources.” Blia 
doesn’t think racism will ever go away, not in her lifetime and not in her children’s lifetime, until 
one day when all our skin colors are the same. Blia’s skin will always be dark and her hair will 
always be black, and even though she speaks English as well as any white person, she can’t hide 
who she is. Blia thinks that Hmong women tend to be more fluent in English than Hmong men. 
Maybe the men are more shy to use English. Even in school, the Hmong boys don’t seem as 
fluent as the girls. 
01:01:00  
Relationships with teachers: does she do potlucks or social things with the staff at 
North High School? It’s hard to work in a large school district, not even just because of being a 
district employee. You get to work with a large number of people but you don’t get to develop a 
close relationship. The only really close relationship she has is with the student services group at 
North High School; they get together for dinner, or get together during the summer for lunch. 
She does have monthly meetings with the district’s social workers and coordinators, but that is 
not the same as the close relationship she has with the student services group at North, where 
they are friends and hang out. The teachers she doesn’t see unless they need something from her, 
so she doesn’t have the opportunity to develop friendships. They are all wonderful people, but 
they just go on their way. Blia does end up staying later than 3:35 at the job, when she is meeting 
with students or the Hmong Club, or if teachers want her to give a presentation to them, or if 
P.T.A. or P.T.O. groups want her to give a presentation. There are always opportunities. If she 
can make a difference with one group, that is awesome. She has been in this job for 14 years, and 
was with Menominee for ten years. She has been asked if she would become an administrator, or 
become certified to be the school psych, but she always says no because she loves what she does. 
She can work across all areas, there are no boundaries, so she can really make a difference. She 
also works with D.P.I. to make policy changes; they call her up and consult. So she can make a 
difference, from k-12. And she gets to work with the parents who really appreciate her; they call 
her to come to their children’s graduation parties because they know she made the difference.
