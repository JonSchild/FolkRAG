GOLD RUSH SONGS This was copied [?] on p [115?][Caly .?] FS. Project [workmen?]from a book at
[L?] C Libraryin [Berkeley?]. JOE BOWERS This is probably the best-known relic of the gold fever of
'49. Its authorship,like that of Jesse James, has been much discussed but never clearly made out.H.
C. Merwin in his Life of Bret Harte (1911) 60-1 given a detailed but quite undocumentedaccount of
its having been written by one Frank Swift, member of a bandof two hundred Argonauts from Pike
County, Missouri, in 1849, concerning anothermember of the band whose name was Joe Bowers,
and sung by the band around theircampfire and then passing into the repertory of Johnson's
[Minstrels?] in San Francisco.A few years earlier W. E. Connelly in his Doniphan's Expedition (1907)
5-14, aftergoing over various attributions, concludes that the account given by Judge Thomas J.C.
Fagg of Louisiana, Missouri, is probably right: that it was the work of one JohnWoodward, who
was 'connected with Johnson's Minstrels in 1849 and the early fifties,'and that 'Joe Bowers' is
merely a typical figure of the forty-niners, not a realperson. It is of course possible that Woodward
merely picked up a song that he hadheard sung by miners; but its origin in the minstrel company is
inherently moreprobable. Whatever its authorship, it is clearly an adaptation to American humorand
the circumstances of the forty-niners of the world-old theme of 'the girl I leftbehind me.' It was
printed by Partridge (No. 718), Wehman (No. 455), and De Marsan,and frequently in song-books.
Collectors of traditional balladry have found it inWest Virginia (FSS 234-5), Mississippi (FSM 197-8),
Minnesota (Dean 98-9), Nebraska(ABS 186-8), and Idaho (JAFL XXVIII 5-7), and has served as model or
bass for alumberman's song in Pennsylvania (NPM 46). Lomax (JAFL XXVIII 5) says he has foundthat
it was 'one of the popular songs among the Confederate soldiers of the CivilWar' and that he has
'run upon men who know it in Wyoming, in California, in Arizona,in Oklahoma, and in other States.'
It is given in ABFS 421-4 and in CS 375-7. 'TheRambling Cowboy' (CS 192-4, Thorp's Songs of the
Cowboys 134-5) and 'Lackey Bill'(CS 187-8) are adaptations of it to the life of the cowboy. There are
four texts inthe Missouri collection, but as they differ chiefly by omission I give but one. 443 The
texts are:A From Finis Dean, in 1905; as sung by his mother in CarrollCountyB From George Williams,
Bollinger County, 1906, as sung byhis uncle, who learned it thereC Secured by Miss Hamilton in 1910
from David Hogan of theWest Plains High SchoolD From Homer Coffman, in 1935, as sung by his
grandfather inPhelps County, who learned it in a mining camp in Californiaor Nevada 'in an early
day'
BMy name it is Joe Bowers;I've got a brother Ike;I came from old Missouri,All the way from Pike.I'll
tell you why I left tharAnd why I came to roamAnd leave my poor old mammySo far away from
AFCCC-GOLDR http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_goldr
home.I used to court a gal thar,Her name was Sally Black.I axed her if she'd marry me;She said it
was a whack.Says she to me, 'Joe Bowers,Before we hitch for life,You ought to get a little homeTo
keep your little wife.''Oh, Sally, dearest Sally,Oh, Sally, for your sakeI'll go to CaliforniaAnd try
to raise a stake.'Says she to me, 'Joe Bowers,You are the man to win;Here's a kiss to bind the
bargain,'And she hove a dozen in.When I got in that countryI hadn't nary red,I had such wolfish
feelingsI wished myself 'most dead;But the thought of my dear SallySoon made them feelings git,And
I whispered hopes to Bowers [md] I wish I had 'em yit. 444 At length I went to mining,Put in my
biggest licks;Came down upon the bouldersJust like a thousand bricks:I worked both late and early,In
rain, in sun, in snow [md] I was working for my Sally;It was all the same to Joe.At length I got a
letterFrom my dear brother Ike,It came from old Missouri,All the way from Pike;It brought to me the
darndest newsThat ever you did hear.My heart is almost [busttin?]',So pray excuse this tear.It said
that Sal was false to me,Her love for me had fled,She'd got married to a butcher [md] The butcher's
hair was red.And more than that, the letter said [md] It's enough to make me swear [md] That Sally
had a baby;The baby had red hair.Now I've told you allAbout this sad affair,'Bout Sally marrying a
butcher,That butcher with red hair.But whether 'twas a boy or gal childThe letter never said;It only
said the baby's hairWas inclined to be red.
The tune of D runs as follows"Coffman's tune here

BETSY FROM PIKE A companion piece, in a rather broader vein of humor, to Joe Bowers. I
knownothing of its history. It has been reported from Kentucky (DD 123-6) lower(MAFLS XXIX 106,
a fragment), and California ( Mo.Hist.Rev. XXII 362-4, by aformer Missourian), and is given without
note of its provenience in ASb 108-97 CS383-91, and ABFS 424-6. It is in Put's Golden Songster (San
Francisco, copyr.1858) and no doubt in other song-books.
'Betsy from Pike.' Written down in 1904 for Miss Lowry by L. W. Lee ofValley View, Texas, formerly of
Howard County, Missouri, who writes that it is oneof the 'ballads that we California miners used to
sing with a vim in the [50's?].
Oh, don't you remember sweet Betsy from Pike,Who crossed the big mountains with her lover
Ike,With two yoke of oxen, a large yellow dog,A tall shanghai rooster and one spotted hog ?Eli
compoly [compoli?] copelia Eli compoly com copleriaEli compoly com petheriaEli compoly com
petheria. One evening quite early they camped on the Platte,Close by the roadside on a green shady
flat,Where Betsy sore-footed lay down to repose.With wonder she gazed on his Pike County rose.
The shanghai ran off and the cattle all died;The last piece of bacon that morning was fried.Poor Ike
was discouraged, and Betsy was mad;The dog wagged his tail and looked wonderfully sad.At length
the old wagon came down with a crashAnd out on the prairie rolled all kinds of [trash?];A few little
AFCCC-GOLDR http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_goldr
baby-clothes done up with great careLooked rather suspicious, though all on the square.They went
by Salt City to enquire the way,When Brigham declared sweet Betsy should stay.Betsy got frightened
and ran like a deer,And Brigham stood pawing the ground like a steer.They next reached the desert,
where Betsy gave outAnd down in the sand she lay rolling about.Poor Ike, half discouraged, looked
on with surprise,Saying, 'Betsy, get up; you will git sand in your eyes.' 446 At length they arrived on a
very high hill,With wonder looked down upon old Placerville.Ike sighed, and he said, when he cast his
eyes down,'Betsy, my darling, we've got to Hangtown.'This Pike Countyncouple attended a dance,And
Ike wore a pair of his Pike County pants;Betsy was dressed up with ribbons and rings;Says, 'Ike,
you're and angel, but where is your wings?'A miner says, 'Betsy, won't you dance with me?''I will that,
old hoss, if you don't make too free.Don't dance me too hard; if you want to [know?] why,Doggone
you, I'm chockful of strong alkali.'This Pike County couple got married, of course,And Ike became
jealous, obtained a divorse.Betsy, well satisfied, cried with a shout,'Goodby, you big [lumnix?], I'm
glad you backed out.'
447
I'VE JUST GOT IN ACROSS THE PLAINS A humorous recital of the difficulties of the crossing. Very
likely fromsong-book, many of which were printed but are not accessible to me. The textbelow
was communicated to Miss Hamilton in 1912 by one of her students at theKirksville State Teachers
College, a Miss McWilliams, from the repertory of herfather, who was then ninety-two years old. On
a corner of the MS was written:'Written on the California Trail about 1850 by Enual ( perhaps Ennel)
Davis.The readings are uncertain in places, and I have indicated what seem to beomissions, tho they
are not so marked in the MS. The title is simply 'Miner'sSong.'
I've just got in across the plains.I'm poorer than a snail.My mules all died but poor old clipI pulled
in by the tail.I fed him last at Chimney Rock;There's where the grass gave out.I'm proud to tell we
stood it wellAlong the trucky route.. . . . now poor and lean,Tho I started plump and fat.I wish I had
the gold machineI left back on the Platte.And a pair of bed-tick pantsMy Sally made for meTo wear
when digging gold. . . . . . . . .I [had?] needles, pins, and thread,Which my mammy did prescribe,But I
left them all on Goose CreekWhere I freely did [imbibe?].. . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . .The flintlock musket
loaded fullTo shoot the Diggers wild. 448 I joined in with a train from LikeAt Independence Rock,The
Indians they came in that nightAnd stampeded all our stock.They laughed at me to [ go ] on foot;But
soon they stopped their funWhen my old mule was left behindSo poor he couldn't run.I packed my
fancy nag,For the rest I couldn't wait,And traveled up Sweet WaterTill I came to Devil's Gate.When my
mule gave out, in sightOf where I started in the morn,I'd given all my boots and shoesIf I never had
been born.But I'd rather stripped at New OrleansTo swim around the Horn. . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . .I
arrived at Salt Lake CityOn the 18th of July.Old Brigham Young was on a bust;He said he'd never die.I
went to see the JordanWith a lady, God forgive her!She took me to the water's edgeAnd shoved me
AFCCC-GOLDR http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_goldr
in the river.I scrabbled out and started onAnd managed very wellUntil I struck the Humboldt,Which
I thought was nearly Hell.I traveled till I struck the Sink,Whose outlet can't be found;The [Lord?]
got through late Saturday night,So he run it in the ground.The [Plutes?] stole what grub I had,They
left me not a bite;And now the devil was to pay [md] The day it was a sight. 449 And as the people
passed alongThey said to me, 'You fool!You never will get there in the worldUnless you leave that
mule.'I pulled, I pushed and coaxed.At last I made a start.His bones discreet did rattle soI thought
he'd fall apart. I killed a buzzard now and then,Gave Clip the legs and head.I crossed the summit,
took the trailThat to Nevada led.[#?] There I fobbed the town with liceAnd robbed a China of his rice;I
robbed a nigger of a dollar,Bought angwentin to grease my collar.#
# This use of the verb 'fob' in strange to me. 'China' of course is for'Chinaman.' 'Angwentin' probably
stands for 'unguentine', which, tho I do notfind it in dictionaries, may well enough have been a trade
name for anointmentused to remove lice.
I tried a pint and not one had gone.It beat the world how I daubed it
on.. . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . .When I got to SacramentoI got a littleI lodged about the prison brigA
half a day and a night.I vamoosed when I got ashore,Went to the northern mines;Then found the
saying very trueAll is not gold that shines.At home they think we ought to haveGold on our cabin's
shelves,Wear high-heeled boots, well blacked,Instead of rubber number twelves;But let them come
and try itTo satisfy themselves.

WHEN I LEFT THE STATES FOR GOLD Another of the songs of the forty-niners secured by Miss
Hamilton fromMiss McWilliams in 1912. I find no other record of it. It is entitled inthe MS simply 'A
Miner's Song [md] - '49.'
When I left the states for gold,Everything I had I sold:A stove, a bed, and a fat old sow,Sixteen
chickens, and a cow.Refrain:Oh, leave, ye miners, leave;Take my advice, kill off the lice,Or go up into
the mountains.Oh, no, we've lots of dust,Going to the city to get on a bust.Off I started, Yankee-
like,And I [soch?] fell in with a lot from Pike.It first was 'Back, ges!' then 'Whoa[!?] haw!'A 'right smart
chance' from Arkansas.On the Platto we couldn't agreeBecause I had this diarrhoe;We had a split-
up, and I made a break,With one old mule for the Great Salt Lake.The Mormon girls were fat as
hogs[,?]The chief production, cats and dogs.Some had ten wives, others none;Thirty-six had Brigham
Young.

GOLD Another of the songs of the forty-niners secured by Miss Hamilton fromMiss McWilliams in
1912 and not known to me from other sources. The MS ismarked 'Sung to the tune of "Lily Dale."
Composed by Enuel Davis.'
When the Cold fever raged I was doing very well,With my friends all around, young and old;'Twas a
long time ago I bade them farewellAnd embarked for the land of gold.Refrain:O miners, poor miners,
hungry and cold,Tho poor, I'll return to my home far away.Then farewell to the land of gold.'Twas a
hard thing to part with the little ones so gayAs they played in the yard round the door,And my wife
sobbed aloud as I started away,Saying, 'Farewell, I'll see you no more.'I dreamed I was home in the
old orchard tread#With the loved ones around, it did seem;But as I reached for the apples that hung
round my head,Disappointed I awoke from my dream.
# So the MS seemed to read. I am at a lose to interpret it.
Cold, wet, and hungry I slept on the groundWhile visions of happiness came;But sad and
disappointed I awoke at the soundOf the screach-owl that lit on my claim.
452
COME ALL YE POOR MEN OF THE NORTH Another song of the gold fever, hottatory and optimistic
instead ofhumorous. Written down for Miss Lowry in 1904 by L. W. Lee, formerly ofHoward County,
Missouri, as one of the 'ballads that we California miners usedto sing with a vim in the 50's.' No title
is given. I do not know it elsewhere.
Come all ye poor men of the north who are working for your livesFor to support your families, your
children and your wives;There is easier ways of gaining wealth than toiling night and day;Go and dig
the gold that lies in California!The fairest of all countries that lies beneath the sun,Where lofty trees
grow towering high and noble rivers run;Beneath the sparkling waters as they glide to the seaIt is
often there we will dig the gold that lies in California[ .?]On every lofty mountain, on every sunny
plain,The gold dust lies glittering like dewdrops after rain.Beneath the shade of every tree, among
the flowers so gay,It is there we'll dig the gold that lies in California.What haughty, proud aristocrat
can say that this is mine?It's for the poor as well as rich those costly treasures find. #Why should you
be engaged in work when your labors don't repay?Then go and dig the gold that lies in California.#
'Find' is presumably miswritten for 'shine.'
Why should this noble country by Indians be run O'er,While many of them are starving and many
more are poor?Go, rise, and with new energy and without more delay,And go and dig the gold that
lies in California.There is many a loafer in that land, a low[ , ?] and shiftless race,They do theirselves
AFCCC-GOLDR http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_goldr
no manner of good, their country they disgrace.Whenever I meet with one of them I unto them will
say:'You had better be a-digging gold in California.'
453
THE DREARY BLACK HILLS The gold strike in the Black Hills of Wyoming came nearly two decades
after'49, and has left but one song that is widely remembered. It has been reportedfrom
Pennsylvania (NPM 174-5) and Wyoming (ABS 185-6); texts are given withoutnote of their
provenience in CS 372-4, ASb 264-5, ABFS 438-40, and in SCb87-90. There are two texts in the
Missouri collection, differing only byslight variations. A is from the Dresia MSS secured by Miss Lowry
at Columbus,Kansas, in 1909; and B was secured by Miss Newell in 1913 from Miss Ethyl Chandlerof
Farmington, St. Francois County.
BNow if you listen to the tale I will tell,I'm an object that's needy and looking quite well,I left off my
practice selling patent right pills,#To go digging for gold in the dreary Black Hills.Chorus:Don't go
there, I pray, stay away if you can,Far away from that city that they call Cheyenne;If Looking-glass#
don't, why, Cheyenne BillWill take off your scalp on the dreary Black Hills.
# 'Patent right' should no doubt be 'Wright's patent.' A has 'Ayres patentpills.' And for 'Looking-glass'
and 'Cheyenne Bill' it has 'big Wollipy' and'Comanche Bill.'
When I arrived in the Black Hills no gold could I find.Then I thought of that free lunch that I'd left
behind.With mud, rain, and snowstorms froze up to my gills,They call me the orphan boy in the Black
Hills.The round-house in Cheyenne is filled every nightWith people of every description and plight;No
coats on their backs, in their pocketc no bills,But still they keep striking out for the Black Hills.Now, if
you have listened to the tales I have toldDon't go to the Black Hills a-looking for gold;For the railroad
speculators their pockets will fillIf you go digging for gold in those dreary Black Hills. 454
THE DYING CALIFORNIAN For the history of this song see Kittredge's notes JAFL XXXV 365 and
XXXIX139. It has been reported as traditional song from Newfoundland (BSSN 359-60),New York (JAFL
XLVIII 381-2), West Virginia (FSS 232-5) Mississippi (FSM 221-2),and Iowa (ABS 191-3); Tolman prints
two tunes for it found in Ohio (JAFL XXXV364-5; he had the texts, but does not print them); it is in
Miss Pound's Nebraskacollection; and Jackson (SFSEA 37-8) prints a text and tune from TheOriginal
Sacred Harp (Atlanta, 1911), noting that 'it made its first appearancein fasola circles in the 1859
edition of the Sacred Harp, where it is attributedto Ball and Drinkard.' The passage to California
by water, whether around theHorn or across the Isthmus, was fraught with danger, especially of
disease. TheMissouri text does not differ greatly from others that have been reported, butis given
here for comparison.

'The Dying Brother.' Secured by Miss Hamiltonin [1912?] from Shirley Hunt ofthe Kirksville Teachers
College.
Lie up nearer, brother, nearer,For my form is growing cold,And thy presence seemeth [dearer?]As
thy arms around me fold.I am dying, brother, dying;Soon you'll miss me from your berth,For my
form will [soon?] be lying'Neath the ocean's briny surf.Hearken to me, brother, hearken;There
is something I [would?] sayEre the vale my vision darkenAnd I pass from earth away.I am going,
brother, going;But my faith in God is strong.I am dying, brother, dying[?]Yet he doeth nothing
wrong.Tell my father, when you see him,That in death I prayed for him,Prayed that I might one
day meet himIn a world that's free from sin.Tell my mother [md] God protect her,Now that she is
growing oldThat her child would glad have kissed herWhen his lips grew pale and cold. 455 Listen,
brother, catch each whisper;'Tis my wife I'd speak to now,Tell, ah, [ell?] her how I missed herWhom
the fever burned my brow.Tell her I never reached the havenWhere I sought the precious dust,But
I've gained a port called heaven,Where the gold can never rust.Tell her she must kiss my childrenLike
the kiss I last impressed,Hold them as when I last held themFolded closely to my breast;Give them
early to their maker,Putting all their trust in God,And he never will forsake them,For so he saith in
his word.Ah, my children! Heaven bless them,They recall my life to me.Would I could once more
caress themEre I sink beneath the sea.'Twas for them I crossed the ocean.What my hopes were I'll
not tell,But they've gained an orphan's portion [md] Yet he doeth all things well.Urge upon them to
secure an entrance,For they'll find their father there.Faith in Jesus and repentenceWill secure for
each a share.Hark, I hear my savior calling!'Tis his voice, I know full well.When I'm gone, oh, don't be
weeping.Brother, here's my last farewell.
456
THE ROLLING STONE This relic of the westward movement is interesting as an American specimenof
the debat [md] not amatory, but prudential. It is reported from Kentucky(BKH 100) and Ohio
(JAFL XXXV 408-10), and was known to Hamlin Garland in hisyouth ( A Son of the Middle Border
43-5. 446). In the Ohio text the husband proposesto go to Wisconsin; in both the Missouri texts
the migration proposed isto California. The antiphonal refrain is, I believe, unique in American
folksong.Presumably it circulated in song-book or slip-ballad print, but I havenot been able to trace it
in that field.A No title. One of the songs written down in 1904 for Miss [Eowry?] by L. W.Lee of Texas,
formerly of Howard County, Missouri, as 'ballads that we Californiaminers used to sing with a vim in
the 50's.
'Since times are no hard, I'll tell you, my wife,I've a mind for to shake off this trouble and strifeAnd
to California my journey pursueTo double my fortune as other men do;For here we may labor each
day in the fieldAnd the winters consume all that summers do yield.''Dear husband, I've noticed
AFCCC-GOLDR http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_goldr
with a sorrowful heartYou've lately neglected your plow and your cart;Your horses, sheep, cattle
disorderly run,And your new Sunday waistcoat goes every day on.Now stick to your farming, you'll
suffer no lose,For the stone that keeps rolling can gather no moss.''Dear wife, let us go, and don't
let us wait.I long to be doing, I long to be great,And you some great lady, and who knows but ISome
great Governor before we do die.For here we may' etc.'Dear husband, remember your land is to
clear;It will cost you the labor of many a year.Your horses, sheep, cattle will all be to buy,And before
you have got them you are ready to die.So stick to your farming' etc.'Dear wife, let us go and don't let
us stand.We'll buy us a farm all ready at hand,And horses, sheep, cattle are not very dear;And we'll
feast on fat buffalo more than half of the year.While here we' etc. 457 'Dear husband, remember
your land of delightIn surrounded by Indians that murder at night;Your house will be plundered
and burned to the groundAnd your wife and children lay mangled around.So stick to your farming'
etc.'Dear wife, you've convinced me. I'll argue no more.I never once thought of your dying before.My
dear little children, although they are small,And you, my dear wife, more precious than all.So we'll
stick to, our farming, and suffer no loss;For the stone that keeps rolling can gather no monn.'
B 'California Song.' Brought to Miss Hamilton in 1909 by Allie Elliott ofthe West Plains High School,
who had from J. L. McAnally, a Civil War veteran(Company D, 10th Iowa). Probably from McA.'s
Civil War notebook or diary. Itis a fragmentary and disordered text, but otherwise does not differ
essentiallyfrom A.
