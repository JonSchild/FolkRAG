She was a rugged kind of horse,
 
That wou1dn t be broken t

As days want by

He would always romp and pisy.
 
Then they joined a band of horses
 
led by a Dapple may.
 
They were run caiw t

And his heart would beet with rear,
 
When up against the boriaoi
 
A rider would appear.
 
Then one day ho made a mistak

He never s

But f

They were going down a rocky bill,
 
He t

And a c
