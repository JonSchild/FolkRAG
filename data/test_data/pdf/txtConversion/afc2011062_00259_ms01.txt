     Background noise:  The Local IWU 63 headquarters can be a bit noisy and this can be heard in the background.  
It's an industrial building for the most part, so the cooling and heating system is a regular problem.   Occasionally, 
the building even generates a line noise that is impossible to keep off the recording.  Sometimes you can also hear 
people in the office section talking and laughing or somebody will walk into the room.  His phone rings too.

[This is Bucky Halker and I'm here at ironworkers #63 and I’m here with Bill Satler.]  Yes.  [And Bill, tell me what 
year you were born first.]  1950.  [And here in Chicago, or where…?]  Born and raised right here in the city and I 
still live in the city.  [And where did you grow up in the city?  What part of the town?]  Northwest side, northwest 
side.  It’s called Mayfair.  [Did you go to high school?]  I went to Catholic grammar school in the neighborhood and 
then I went to Lane Tech, which was a technical school which helped me out, helped me become an ironworker, to 
tell you the truth because…  We had structural drawing, architectural drawings, and machine shops that taught you a 
lot about how metal was formed and made.  Drilling and tapping and whatever.  So it was a technical school so it 
really helped me become an ironworker.  [So did you start getting into ironworking right after you left high school?]  
No.  I went into tool and dye because that’s what I was good at in high school.  And I was apprenticeship for two 
years.  And I found out that I hated being in four walls.  So…and I had a friend that was caught with drugs and the 
judge said, “It’s either Vietnam or jail.”  And he was a good buddy of mine and I had a girlfriend that wanted to 
marry me…and I said, I'm just going out there and see if I can be Johnny’s best buddy in Vietnam so we joined the 
service.  We went to Vietnam together.  Unfortunately, he didn’t come back home.  He got killed.  So…that’s what I 
did right after that…  Then when I got out of the service, the State of Illinois had a program because so called baby 
killers needed to have a job and they’re trying to put us in a place that we belong.  So the Goldblatts Building on 
State Street, it used to be State of Illinois, (de)apartment there that would test us for that aptitude.  And I tested for 
being in the…like seven different things I tested for.  And they said you could become a policeman, or you could 
become an ironworker, or you could be a number of things.  So it came down to saying, all right.  What do I want to 
do with the rest of my life?  I says, “In order to be a policeman, you actually get shot at to shoot at people.”  It 
doesn’t make any sense to me.  So…I became an ironworker.  And the funny thing about it was I thought I was 
going to be a big rough tough structural ironworker.  And they had a apprenticeship school, Washburn Trade School, 
back then.  It’s not there now.  And I walk in the first day and there’s about seven lines of different trades.  And one 
of them said #63 and the other one said Local #1.  And I got in Local #1’s line by mistake.  I get to there and I’m 
waiting.  I get to talk to the head honcho and he says, “You sissy.  You’re one of the sissy #63 guys.  Get over in that 
line.”  I thought I was really doing something wrong.  You know…  A big rough tough guy from Vietnam.  And the 
next thing I know, wait a minute.  What’s a sissy #63 guy?  Well, the rest is history after that.  It’s the best thing that 
ever happened to me. 
 
3:11  [Did you start out at a particular work site?  Do you remember the first job you had?]  I remember it like it was 
yesterday.  It was 111 Chestnut.  It was a high rise that Mayor Byrne actually moved into.  It’s across the street from 
the Hancock Center.  And, it was pretty neat because I was always afraid of heights.  I didn’t like heights.  And I 
was with some peoples, and this is the beautiful thing about unions.  If you do everything you’re suppose to, the 
brotherhood of the unionism is…that…that they take care of you.  They find your weaknesses and help you out.  
And so they helped me overcome that and one of the ways you do that…is we started on, like, the 44th floor of a 60-
story building.  And when I finally got to 66, I was fine with it. [Not clear on number of stories here] So…but…  If 
you get in with the right crew and do…and you’re not a trouble maker, the unions are outstanding for that, for 
helping out their fellow man.  So it was kind of funny, there were things that would happen there.  And you say, ok, 
this is the right thing.  Every Tuesday at 9 o’clock, a woman across the street would wash the windows 
with…topless.  So that’s when everybody had their instruments out, surveying and doing things that you could be 
doing on the job that the whole building would lean to the left… GIGGLES  …when that would happen.  So one of 
the guys…  We all chipped in and bought flowers for this lady.  And so we got the flowers together and sent the guy 
over there.  And he…  We didn’t see him the rest of the day.  That was…  It was pretty neat.  Things like that 
happened back then.  It was a lot more fun back then.  There wasn’t a lot of, insurance people, safety people telling 
you, “No, you can’t do this.”  As long as you did your job, everybody pretty much left you alone.  It was just a great 
time to be an ironworker.   
 
5:28  [So were you an apprentice when you did that?  First year apprentice?]  First year apprentice, yeah.  And 
things would happen after that, you just say that I’m glad I belong to this brotherhood because…  Even though some 
of its boring, you play a game, that you say, all right.  I can out do myself, more than I did yesterday.  So you’d 
work harder and try harder.  And at the same time, you’re also watching the other trades and you see what they do so 
before and after you, so you know better how to do your job by watching them.  The apprenticeship is everything.  If 
you want to talk about apprenticeship, Al Pellacore, the guy that’s named…  This building is named after,,,  [Yeah, 
there’s a plaque out there, right.] …was one of the finest ironworkers, finest human beings you ever wanted to deal 
with.  And fortunately, he was our apprentice coordinator.  So you hear stories about unions saying, “Let’s get 
everything we can and get as much money as you can.  Let’s screw the big guy.”  But it wasn’t like that.  Al 
Pellacore  would say, “Listen, 8 for 8.  You get paid for eight hours, you do eight hours.”  And what he would teach 
you…  He was an old Navy guy…  And he was an officer but he was the highest ranking NC, non-commissioned 
officer could be.  And he was the most giving guy.  Everybody that went through his program…all the guys that I 
graduated with, are the main guys in the industry today.  And that’s because of him as far as I’m concerned.  But 
that’s one of the great things about unions.  You get people like that to teach you, there’s no stopping you.  You can 
build the world.  In fact, that’s one of the stories he told us.  He says, when he first got started, there was an 
interview with this old timer.  And they asked him, “Was there ever a job you couldn’t get done?”  And the guy 
would say…and the guy says, and this is after 50 years in the business. And he says, “I always thought that one job 
was going to come through that I couldn’t get done.  But I always surrounded myself with people that knew what 
they were doing.  And as a team, we always got it done.”  So those were the lessons to be learned as a young man.   
 
7:35  [So did you…  Were you an indentured apprentice for that period or did you just…?]  No.  [Some of the guys 
that I’ve been talking who did four years with the same company, you know.]  Well, you’re not going to believe this.  
I don’t know if anybody can say this.  I have only worked for two companies in 40 years.  I’ve never missed a day of 
work.  I mean, for sickness yes, but never from lack of work.  I’ve been blessed.  I lied to you.  It was three.  
Engineering Erection I was with for two years and then Northern Erectors I was with for 18 years and Area Erectors 
now, the rest of the time, so it was actually three.  But it was two at the apprenticeship.  And I’m glad I did that 
those first two years with Engineering Erection because that’s a whole different trade.  That was curtain wall and 
windows, where the rest of my career was in miscellaneous iron and ornamental iron that knowing the two of 'em, 
made a better ironworker out of me.  I knew the system.  [Were you a welder too?]  Certified welder.  Yes.  And 
it's…  It’s one of the things this…this slight depression or recession is done.  When I first got started, only maybe 
20% of the ironworkers actually knew how to weld.  And that’s a sin because you say, “All right.  That’s what 
ironworkers do.”  But there wasn’t the incentive.  There was plenty of work doing other things.  So…  Today there’s 
plenty of incentive to get to learn as much as you can…  Get your 30 hour OSHA.  Get your safety things in order.  
Get your welding in order.  And what it's doing is it's not only making a better ironworker, its making a better union.  
The unions have more to sell.  And that’s what this hall is doing.  They’re encouraging you.  You don’t have to pay 
union dues if you go through this, go through the separate programs that they have going.  They give you credits for 
that and that’s great.  Because if unions are going to survive, there is only one way they’re going to do it: By 
producing people that know what the hell they’re doing.   
 
9:51  [Yeah.  Why do you think…  This is not a question that I’ve asked anybody else but you brought it up.  The 
ironworkers are pretty good about that, quality control I guess is what we could call it, with their members.  It seems 
like a lot of other unions have a hard time doing that.]  Exactly.  And that’s why #63 is one of the finest unions you 
can talk to.  The leadership isn’t a bunch of thugs that are just going to…flexing their muscles, saying “Do this or 
else.”  These guys have computers underneath their hands and they look, for legal, you know, ratifications, safety 
ratifications, they create things rather than put out fires.  They look ahead and that’s what your leadership should 
have.  And not too many unions today are doing that.  And it’s a sin.  You might be starting now that the recession is 
in and they got to.  Non-unions all around us.  So…  It won’t be #63 that will shut down unions, I’ll tell ya that. 
 
10:49  [How did you see that…from, you know, working in various aspects of the trade.  What were some of the 
biggest changes you saw from the time you first started, after you got back from the war.  What kind of changes did 
you notice the most?]  You’d like to think that ingenuity would be the biggest but it wasn’t.  The biggest is safety.  
And when I say safety…  OSHA got involved and even more importantly, insurance companies got more involved.  
So the days that I used to ride a ball on a crane, and a crane operator had to follow me go around in circles, going 
around, trying to throw ya, without a safety belt, and that actually happened.  That’s definitely over with and that’s 
probably a good thing.  But when you have kids coming out of college, telling these guys that have, you know, 
twenty years under their belt, that never had an accident, you know.  And are very safety conscious and they know 
more about the business than anybody else, being told by the kid out of college that… And this is a fact.  It’s not a 
prejudice thing.  It’s a fact that they learned something in school and they learned by the books and they said, “This 
is the way it’s going to be.”  And they don’t have a clue on how to actually be safe out there.  And they sold the bill 
of goods to the general contractors and the owners who were building those buildings.  They said, “The building is 
going to be a lot cheaper if you have no accidents and you should follow these guidelines.”  In reality, it’s costing 
them money because it’s slowing down the process.  Everybody is afraid to do anything.  It’s like, you’re probably a 
damn good driver.  As soon as a cop gets behind you, how do you drive?  More cautious, slower.  You know.  And 
you’re not the person you could be.  It’s the same with these kids.  And I shouldn’t say just kids, there are old timers 
too that belong to OSHA.  They take the fun out of the game and it used to be fun.  You’d wake up in the morning 
and say ok.  For an example, I’ve got pictures here of things that…  There would be scaffolding that they had up to 
shoring and putting up this big beautiful ornamental piece and a carpenter comes up and says, “I can climb that just 
as fast as you.”  I look at him and say, “Well, all right.  Let’s try it.  I bet you lunch.” So you have a race going up to 
40 feet and down.  And…and…  You couldn’t do that today.  You couldn’t just do something that was fun and build 
ya know relationship with the other trades too.  You know…  It’s a big happy family down there, even though you’d 
beat his ass going up the scaffold…so…  You don’t have that today.  You’re not allowed to be all that you can be.  
They kind of cut ya…  It sort of reminds you of this stallion, running across that field.  It’s a beautiful thing until 
you get a saddle on it.  It’s terrible, getting that saddle on it.  You’ve taking away what he is.  I think that’s the 
biggest single thing that’s wrong with the industry.  Yes, you need safety.  But listen to the people that really know 
what safe means.  And don’t drive it…Don’t be a policeman on it.  Don’t, ya know…  Don’t think that around every 
corner there’s someone with a camera because there is.  It’s getting bad out there.  So…  That’d be the single biggest 
change that I’ve seen.  The tools, the men, they’re smarter today.  They get things done faster and the machinery is 
better today.  And I see that owners, the engineering of these things, the valid engineering, there’s more of it being 
done now.  Its being done cheaper and being done safer and it's not because of the insurance companies and 
OSCHA, it’s because they found out that if its done in the office before everybody else gets their two cents in it.  It 
comes up right, it comes out safe for the men, and the next thing you know, it’s done faster.  So that’d be the second 
thing that seems to have changed in the industry.  So…but the biggest one is they took the fun out of it. 
 
15:04   [Did you ever…  You started out by talking about how getting in the wrong line, you got in the Local #1 line 
instead of the sissy #63.  You know, have you had any jurisdictional, sort of differences with any of the locals?]  
Absolutely.  I’m a superintendent right now of this company and I’m in charge of Local #1 guys too.  So I schedule 
the men and I was just up in front of the Board of Local #1 and I probably shouldn’t say this as a matter of record, 
but it’s true.  They don’t have enough brain power to blow their nose between all of them.  They…  It was election 
time and they didn’t like what I did.  I sent #63 guys to do Local #1 guys work and actually, my guys were better.  
#63 guys were better than Local #1 guys, doing the work.  You know…  Local #1 guys are damn good at what they 
do but as soon as you tell them that there’s a 3,000 pound beam that has to go inside of an office building, 17 stories 
up, they’re lost.  These #63 guys do it all day long and what they do is…  They not only handled that 3,000 pound 
piece of steel and get it up there, the full pendant, put it together, and then clad it with some beautiful ornamental 
stainless steel, or brass cladding, or rails with glass.  So you have guys that could do both.  Local #1 guys, they want 
to be able to pick up the thing, you know, with a crane.  Put it in position.  Put a bull pin in there. Put a bolt in and 
lock it to the next connection.  They say, “Hello, I’m a man and I deserve $45 an hour.  Where these #63 guys, 
they’re taught to do just about everything that Local #1 guys just can’t do.  So…  I was up in front of the Board and 
they don’t want to hear that.  [Yeah, I can imagine.]  They don’t want to hear that but it’s a fact.   [What about other 
unions, like glazers or carpenters.  Did you ever have any run ins with them about jurisdictions?]  All the time.  But 
you see, not so much me or…  In the early years I did because of the curtain wall with the glass.  But…  There’s one 
way to fight all that.  Be better than the next guy.  Half the contractors want #63 guys out there instead of the glazers 
and most of them do hire us, because we’re well trained and…  We don’t ask for a whole bunch either.  We actually 
ask for what we’re worth.    
 
17:21    [It seems like that 63 guys, because I’ve talked to about seven or eight of them now and I went to the 
retirees luncheon the other day.  They all seem, just from my vantage point, to be smart guys, almost all of them I 
talked to.  I’d say they were good problem solvers.   It seems like the jobs you’re doing, maybe because they have to 
have a lot of skills and you’re doing a lot of things, you guys have to know how to solve problems.  Is that a good . . 
?]  Yup.  The average education to my first year apprentice class was three years of college.  That was our average.  
Now I just made it through high school.  But we had guys in there with master degrees.  And they’re leaders of the 
community right now.  That’s where Richie Rowe, these guys come from… They’re all college kids.  They work the 
industry and did some college.  That’s what I said in the beginning.  These guys do more on the computer than the 
Local #1 guys can do flexing their muscles and their extortionists.  And you can have that on the record too.  You 
know?  So…  You’re right.  And I think it all started… with the son of a gun, Al Pellacore, the guy that I have so 
much respect for.  He knew the importance of surrounding yourself with smart men.  I think that’s the same with any 
football team or baseball team.   You could ask some guys who could really kick ass, but you want them to play as a 
team and you want them to be smart about things.  I feel you sacrifice a couple of miles per hour from a pitcher, if 
he can be consistent and throw the same ball every time.  But I think that’s what they do at #63.  You probably have 
500-600 guys who tried to get into the apprenticeship program.  They’re not just hiring because Uncle Joe is an 
ironworker.  They’re hiring because they’re qualified.  It does happen, but not often.  So yes, we’re definitely the 
smart ones in the bunch. 
 
19:20  [Yeah, it seems like that.  Were there ever jokes played on you when you first started in the trade?  Some of 
the guys tell me they were treated badly now and then but mostly it seems like you guys don’t raz each other too 
much.]  I’ve seen some bad things, that people were treated wrong.  Fortunately, no one ever did it to me because…  
One thing, I was always a very strong kid.  And I never made any waves and I didn’t go along with any of the 
bullshit.  After being in Vietnam and volunteering for some of the things I volunteered for…  You have to treat 
everybody with some respect.  And most of the time that happened.  And if it didn’t happen, I’d be the person who 
would say something about it.  So…  That being said, there was times when you could have said something that was 
racially wrong, but was funny and actually happened.  So you had to hold it back where there was some offensive 
jokes that were off color that you didn’t want to keep them going.  But they pretty much knew that I was straight 
laced.  I wasn’t going to put up with too much.  And besides, I became the boss.  This is a fact.  Third year 
apprentice they made a foreman.  The teacher that was teaching me in school was my helper.  So I come onto the 
job, I have the truck.  And I said…I don’t want to say names…  But he’d ask me what to do during the day and then 
at night, in class, I’d be asking him what to do in class.  So I was always the boss and so people pretty much treated 
me with a little respect.  I earned it I guess…so…  There was things that were funny.  We had one guy that welded 
in some steel and I’m looking up at him and I say, “Dexter, how are you going to get out of there?”  He welded the  
angle across his head and couldn’t get his head out.   
 
21:28   And so another job I went to, there was another guy… McFarland and I had him put these stairs in.  And I 
noticed that all of the doorways that was suppose to be at the platform, but the platform was half way through the 
door.  And I says, “Do you think there’s anything wrong with this?”  “Well, I thought the holes were put in wrong.”  
I says, “You turned the stair around is what you did.  You had it going north instead of south.”  So… And you know, 
those are funny things because this guy is a class act.  He never made a mistake before, but the one time…  What it 
was, it was two different stairwells.  He just turned around in the stairwell.  It’s an easy mistake.  But when you 
move the platform half way across the doorway, how are you going to open up this door?  So…  Things like that 
happened all the time.  Put something in the wrong hand and then someone says you got to cut something apart and 
you go out there…  And they feel so bad because they are professionals.  I wouldn’t have them in that position to do 
that, if I didn’t think they were capable.  Everybody makes mistakes.  You know?  And it’s laughable at times.   
Another time, we’re carrying a ladder.  I was up front and a guy in the back, and the next thing you know, the end of 
the ladder was down to the ground.  I says, “Where did you go?”  And I looked and he fell in the sewer hole.  He 
went right down the hole and he’s still holding on to the ladder.  I says, “You get off of that.”  And I put mine down 
and we’re laughing so hard I couldn’t even pull him out of the damn hole because… “Where’d you go, asshole?”  
So…  Stuff like that happened all the time. 
 
23:10 [Now were you the guy…  I think Bud Martens told me a story about… You were unloading some stuff off 
the back of a truck and it came down and it clipped off the end of your boot.  Is that…]  Bud Martens’ a helluva 
man.  [Yeah, I really had fun interviewing him.  He’s got great stories, great pictures.]  Did he tell ya I had him in a 
55 gallon bucket with a chain fall…  [No he didn’t.] … on the side of a building.  [No.]   He was a gang worker.  I 
know those days are over.  And was it safe?  Yes.  Would I be fined heavily for doing that today?  Yes.  Did I ever 
see anything like that fail?  No.  You took calculated risks because you’re professionals.  And him and Larry 
Shoulders [spelling?]…  I mean, there’s two guys that own companies who were head honchos that actually worked 
for me.  And I never had one problem with either one of those guys, because they were such a class act.  They knew 
what they did.  I would tell them how to do something, I’d give them some stupid equipment to look for and they’d 
so, “Ok.  We’ll do it.”  Because they had confidence in me that I wouldn’t hurt ‘em.  And that’s the sort of thing that 
with unions that once you’ve established that kind of relationship.  I was…  Larry was my boss when I was an 
apprentice.  What do you see?  Direction.   
 
24:30  Bud Martens.  First day on the job.  Well, no, it wasn’t the first day…  It was the first year on the job.  Bud 
Martens and I were on the swing stage.  It was 25 below zero wind chill.  Water testing a window.  You sit there 
with this dial with this needle and you push it in because there was some leakage in this beautiful high rise.  And the 
owner of the company, Norm, was sitting there smoking a cigar going like this.  It’s 70 degree temperature inside.  
While we’re 25 all day long with a water hose outside, 30-40 stories up.  And I looked at Bud and I go, “Bud, I’m 
not going to make it as an ironworker because this sucks.  There’s nothing good about this.”  [Yeah, that’s great.]  If 
you interviewed Bud Martens, you got a good interview because he is definitely a class act.   
 
25:26  [What were some of the more memorable jobs that you worked on over the years that you can recall.  And I 
know you have some photos and we’ll talk about those in a little bit.]  What was funny about my apprenticeship is… 
The Sears Tower was being built when I first started.  I worked on the world’s tallest building for over a year, 
maybe a year and a half, 3 stories into the ground.  We’re putting cat walks in everything and doing all the stairwells 
and everything under the ground.  I never got to the top of the building until…well, I shouldn’t say never, but the 
main thing that happened, the antennas were put up.  But we had to put the cat walks and the ladders inside the 
antennas of the Sears Tower.  I have a picture here of me, standing at the top of a ladder, with my foot hanging over 
the side of it…  Where is it.  Right there.  That there is the antenna of the Sears Tower with me standing at the top 
off a ladder.  Now I would be fined heavily to do…heavily right now if I did that…  [Because you’re not tied off or 
anything.]  No tie offs.  [So is that… There’s a ladder there.  Is that going up the anterior then?  And your just kind 
of hanging right on the edge…]  There’s seven stories of steel going down like that going down into the building.  I 
think it was like 4 stories up.  So…I’m sitting at the very top that is the highest point of the Sears Tower right there.  
And I actually have another picture that shows my foot, taking a picture of it over the city of Chicago.  That was the 
next picture, I took it myself…that my foot was actually over the edge of this thing, over the city of Chicago.  That’s 
a neat picture.  I couldn’t find that one right now though.  So the Sears Tower was a big part of the apprenticeship 
program. We did all sorts of stuff there.  It was all interesting, first time stuff.  And I was fortunate to do it during its 
infancy.  Bud Martens was just learning' how to do that stuff.   
 
27:31  We also did a lot of stupid things too.  When I was young, and again I was still an apprentice and I was the 
boss…  We were doing a bunch of stairs, three story stairs in a big housing complex out in the sticks.  And they 
would…  And we were in competition at times because the pre-cast guy had this 300 ton crane, a big crawler.  Once 
he parked there, you couldn’t get him to do anything.  So I told this guy that was in charge of the crawler, the pre-
cast.  I says, “Listen.  We have about half an hour in there.  I’m going to get in here with my crane, throw these 
stairs up, and then get out of there.”  He says, “No you’re not.  I’m going in there.”  And I says…  I yelled at my 
guys.  I hand signaled.  I says, “Bring it in.”  So he started his crawler.  I stood in the way of his track.  Now his 
track is this big.  And he come right up and he hit me right in the back and I just stayed there.  And I’m telling those 
guys, “Get that trailer.  Get that truck in there.”  Then I don’t have to worry about getting them over here.  So the 
foreman of this pre-cast guy was a huge man and he was hot.  He said, “Git your …”  I was always taught that you 
could bluff your way out of a lot of things, but if something does happen, you have to control over whatever 
happens.  And one of the control things that I thought of at the time was: If this big old ugly guy is going to haul off 
and hit me, I’m not going to protect myself.  I’m going let him hit me.  I’m going to fall to the ground…and I’m 
going to say, “Ow.  I need an ambulance.”  And later, right in front of that track, and my guys are taking care of it.  
[LAUGHTER]  That was the kind of attitude you had back then.  You do whatever you want…  I guess there was 
not much different than the gladiators.  The Romans.  They worked together as a team and they did what they had to 
do to get the job done.  And the reckless part, it’s kind of neat that you were able to do something like that.  I don’t 
know if you’d be able to do that today.  It just doesn’t happen that way anymore.  So…  There are so many kinds of 
things like that that were happening so… 
 
29:54  [Well, maybe we should finish this portion and take a look at the photographs.  How about that?]  Well, this 
is roughly what we do in Local #63, the interesting stuff that we do.  And one of the things that I like to talk about at 
the unions is this job right here.  Now, you know Vector…  Vector made these.  This is a job that…  A Pakistan 
Indian, a rich man, came to the United States and bought a steel mill in Pennsylvania. He believed in the American 
Way, so he wanted to go with union, with re-building the plant.  And he wanted to go union with the men in the 
plant, which is unheard of because the steel mills were going crazy.  They were going bankrupt daily back then.  But 
he believed in the American Way.  While that was all happening, his daughter dies and so…  The opening day…  
They wanted a memorial, both for the opening day of the plant and the daughter…  Well, Vector…  They 
commissioned this professor from the Art Institute, you might know him, but I don’t know his name but…  He knew 
astrology.  He knew the planets and the stars.  So he came up with this piece that’s…what do you call it…a time 
piece.  [Oh, like a sundial?]  A sundial.  That’s exactly what it is.  And what he had is a hole in the top.  Its 14 feet in 
diameter and on the date of the birthday of the kid, the sunshine through, and it shines on her face.  Comes through 
and shines on her face.  And then on the big day of the opening of the plant, it comes through there and it shines on 
the plant date.  That’s the…  We had to put this in precisely.  Now, the reason I bring this up is…  It wasn’t that hard 
to put in but when I called Pennsylvania, and I says, “Listen, I’m coming in.  I’m a union outfit.  I want to work with 
union people there.  And I want to do things right.”  And the Pakistan guy wanted to do the same.  So Lottie was the 
business manager over there and he says, “We all heard about this.  We’re glad you called.  We want to be part of 
it.”  So he says, “How many do you want?”  I says, “Three guys.”  So I get out there and there’s four guys out there.  
And this guy introduced himself as Lottie.  And I says, “Lottie,” I says, “I only need three guys.  I can only pay for 
three.”  And he says, “This is so important to our community, that I'm coming, I want to make sure the job is going 
to be done.  I’m not charging you for my time.”  So it all worked out well.  We stayed at the house there.  They took 
me fishing.  It was just a great thing and such a great feeling to know wherever you went, you had a common cause 
with the unions and if you did things the right way, you always had a friend wherever you went.  So I mean it really 
worked out well.  Plus it’s just a great story because of the…  [Yeah, it was a great story.] 
 
33:17  [So what about these other things?  Maybe I’ll make copies of these when we’re done.  I’ll just shoot some of 
these now.  Show me what else you got.]  Something like this, this is a Greek church and this is brass…  [Oh, it’s a 
Greek Orthodox, yeah.]  We installed all that with the respect of the church because the Eucharist is always there.  
And so not only…respectful of the church, but we also got the job done.  It’s really neat.  [Now where is that 
church?]  It’s right down the street.  [Oh, that’s the one you see when you’re just going by on 290…]  No.  This is 
Chicago Avenue.  Then Augusta…Augusta and that would be about Western.  [Ok.]  But then, this here?  This is 
Soldiers Field.  We worked on a helicopter.  We had 27 picks on that helicopter putting it in.  And we did it without 
a hitch, no one hurt.  But these were things that were entrusted to us.  And this is what 63 does.  These are actually 
speakers… [Oh, gigantic speakers.  Yeah.  That’s what they are.]  Soldiers Field.  [Yeah.]  Yeah, so we do that.  We 
also do simple things like that.  You look at it and say, ok.  It’s a nice looking thing, but we actually silver-sided 
these rails in place, polished them, in place.  So the same guys that pick up thousands of pounds and bring them to 
the hire rises, they also are capable of doing work like that.  [Yeah.  Now what is that wheel on the top?]  That’s 
brass.  [Brass, all right.]  That’s brass.  You don’t see a seam.   
 
34:58  I went to Germany back in ’92 and the owls was on the Washington Library, in Washington, but this is in 
Germany.  These owls are in Germany.  So I went there and built the frames that were going to…to figure out the 
rigging, and how we were going to do all this back on the block.  So I was there a couple of weeks.  This is the full 
plumage.  You can see up there now, the eagles?  [Yeah.]  So…  It was . . .What was interesting about Germany is 
that…  [How did you get those in place, just with a crane?]  Yeah.  The ironic thing is…  The guy that did all this?  
Never delivered these.  He delivered the owls…  [And that was it…] …and that was it.  He had a real rough time 
fabricating.  So the actual leaves were made in Boston.  So a lot of work that I did, never showed up to Chicago.  It 
was funny.  One of the guys, this guy here…  You just look at it, you see a guy polishing brass.  But the interesting 
thing about it is and this is in Germany.  And I found it interesting in all of my…  I like to look at people and see 
how things are done to see if there are better ways of doing it.  He’s using his knee to push the brass up to the buffer.  
Now what do you think happens to a knee when its buffing like that?  [Yeah, I…]  It gets hot.  So I go up to him and 
I…  I speak English and he speaks German.  And I says, “How do you do that?”  And he smiles at me.  He drops his 
pants.  He stands and drops his pants.  He had a wooden leg.  [LAUGHTER]  And I said, “That’s ingenuity.  You 
find the right guy for the right job and you’re going to make some money.  [LAUGHTER]  So there I…  They take 
me to dinner out there one of them nights and he comes up to me and he says, “I want to apologize.”  And I says, 
“Apologize for what?”  He says, “I want to apologize for Hitler.”  And I says, “Well, you’re not even old enough to 
be his grandchild.”  He says, “I just want you Americans to know that us Germans didn’t all feel the way he did.”  
He says, “He was wrong.”  So it was just a real nice thing to do…  [That was nice.]  And a lot of places I go to, 
things like that are said and done and you just say, “The world is a nice place and it really isn’t as big as you think it 
is.”  You know?  It’s pretty small. 
 
37:24  [Now these are the Harold Washington Library, right?] Yeah.  [These are up there now.]  Yeah.  This is an 
interesting one.  This one’s…the world headquarters of Wriggly Chewing Gum.  They’re over there at Goose Island.  
[Oh yeah, I heard they were moving completely out of the old building, yeah.]  They’re moving here.  And what this 
is is a sky light above it.  This is about 40 feet higher than…  So we had to engineer scaffolding to hold up the thing 
as it was temporarily put in place.  We also had an engineer how it was going to all go into place.  So this is all made 
in Germany, all this steel.  So if you look at it…this whole thing is designed to look like Wriggly Field.  It’s a 
baseball diamond.  [That’s interesting.  I hadn’t heard a word about that.  That’s fascinating.]  If you ever go by 
there, you can look at it and say holy cow.  But you say, who does that sort of thing?  All of this is precise within an 
1/8 of an inch.  Every grid system.  So in order to do this, you have to have some quality men.  And this separates 
the men from the boys.  When you get it all put together and it ends up at the side and ends up where it’s supposed 
to be, you did your job.  And so that’s what Local #63 does.  It does the things that…  This is what the industry 
expects Local #63 to do.  This separates the men from the boys.  Would a good glazing outfit be able to do that?  I 
haven’t seen it.  Maybe there is…  [Did that come in in sections?]  You know, it came in in grid sections that…  
Well, it went to a shop in Elmhurst that each individual piece was together.  And then they would make it in 10 foot 
grids so they could ship it on a truck out to us.  [And each grids got to be in the right place so it all fits together on 
the edges?]  Yeah.  The elevation.  It’s hard to get the elevation.  How do you know what elevation to set that?  How 
do you know exactly where to put that that it’s all plum, that it’s going to hold itself.  And this is all done by 63 
guys.  Start to finish.  [Did you guys do the rigging under the grid there too?]  Yeah.  We did the shoring, the 
rigging, the cutting, you name it.  We did it.  And under budget and on time, so that’s what we do.   
 
39:57  This is called the Spirit.  Ahh…  I get screwed up here.  This is inside a high rise.  And its…its only one part 
of it.  There’s three pieces of it and there’s about 30,000 pounds worth of steel.  This is aluminum.  30,000 pounds 
of aluminum.  That, that we had shoring put in place.  Oh, this is upside down.  This is like this.  Chain fall.  [Oh 
yeah.  Now you can see the people on the ground...]  Yeah, and there’s three pieces.  Well, there was a window open 
there.  We had a crane and we’d bring it in.  It never touched the ground.  This is one piece and there’s three pieces.  
Well, we built this shoring in here and we put a beam across and then we…  This is all on wheels.  So when you’re 
finished with this piece…this is the middle one.  Then we slide over and do the next one.  But…ahh…  Being that it 
had to be done, that it never touched the ground, and they wanted it done on the weekend…so they can keep the 
atrium open…  [Yeah…]  This is interesting because I actually…the one day…  flew to New York, went to Grand 
Central Station, jumped on a train, went to Hudson Bay and…seen…talked about how we were going to rig it, what 
we were going to do.  Got back in the train, go back in the plane and made it home in the same day.  So…and it 
worked like a dream.  [So is that hanging from a big beam out there…]  There’s a beam going across?  […to the 
ceiling, like a whole super structural?]  No.  This is all scaffolding.  [Yeah, that is.]  This is scaffold.  And the beams 
going across.  You tie it all in.  There’s actually two beams that go across, so that they keep it tied together so it 
won’t fold in.  [Yeah.]  So we do this all the time.  This is what Local #63 does and we’re good at it and you don’t 
know too many other trades that can do what we do.  [Yeah.]  And that can be trusted with it.  This here is totally 
precision.  You look at all the different steel in different directions…  There’s not a mechanical connection.  It’s all 
welded.  You say, “Ok.  That’s kind of neat, but where do you start with the pitches, different angles.  And to be 
trusted with something like this that’s also going to hold glass so the centers and how do you look at pictures.  Look 
for angles.  And to be trusted with something like this that was also going to be holding glass so you know all the 
centers had to be bed and nuts for the glass, for all your water proofing.  And so, this is what we do.  The structural 
guys couldn’t do this any better.  If they did, it would have been the other building.  [Yeah, I guess that’s why I said 
that you guys are good, you’re smart.  I mean, if you didn’t go to college, you’ve got to be smart to do that kind of 
work.  And…it can’t always be right.  I mean, even if the engineer gives you the right plans, right?]  Well, yeah.  
[You guys have to jerry rig all the time or figure out and problem solve yourself to make it work, right?]  Well, the 
main thing is you start off with the right line so if the pieces don’t fit the line, it’s a red flag right off the bat.  So you 
know something is wrong.  [Yeah.]  Well, what do we do about it?  Let’s measure it.   
 
42:52  This is Great America.  This is the first rides they ever had.  When they first opened up about 20 years ago, 
25 years ago.  And it’s the one, when you first walk in there.  It’s the big merry-go-round…er…ferris wheel.  Not 
ferris wheel…with the ponies and elephants going round and round?  But we did this…  This is a sideline.  We just 
did this real quick.  This is a neat one.  This is the Board of Trade.  That’s the…  This is the Goddess of Wheat.  
This is 35 feet,  and if you go there now in the new section, this is the big atrium on the 12th floor.  This steel behind 
is only 3 foot wide and its probably 45 feet high.  And the trick was that the Art Institute had to re-do her…  She 
used to be in the inside of the old building.  They took her down and they had to re-do her, to make her…to last 
another fifty years.  So they had the Art Institute students and the professors come and re-do her.  So we designed a 
thing that we had some bar joists and then some plywood that we put her on, and when they were finished, we were 
able to bring her up with a hard board behind her.  Then take…  Then after we got her straight up in the air, because 
we were worried about it bending, you know because you’re laying flat.  And…  This here, you can actually go to 
the Art Institute and they have film…  They had a camera crew watching us do it because it was going to be a 
learning tool for the students.  So… and by the way, when you’re handling something like that, it’s priceless.  How 
do you handle priceless stuff?  You know, if you drop it’s not like you’re going to go to Grandma and say, “I broke 
your teacup.”  [Laughter] So the pressure is on, but the guys that you work with are up for it.  This is…what was 
laying down and again, we have the same shoring, towers, and the beams and picking it up and…  [And I can see 
that if I go to the Board of Trade now?]  12th floor.  Go there right now.  It’s a beautiful thing.  [I’ll have to go see 
that.]  You look at it…but really look at it, and say, “Holy shit, how did that happen?”  [Yeah.]   Because it’s inside 
of a high rise now.  How do you get…  This is the backing for it.  This is the steel.  How do you get this all on the 
12th floor in the elevators are ten foot long.  Piece by piece.  And it’s as strong as can be.  And there’s even steel 
underneath on the 11th floor that needed to be put in the main floor, column by column, to support it, there’s so 
much weight up there.  [So you had to figure all that out in advance.]  Yes.  [How could you test it?   You had to 
trust that you got it right, right…from the beginning?]  I was 32 years old when I did that.  [Wow. Were you 
nervous?]  No.  I was too young to be. I was too stupid.  You just say, “This is a job. Let’s get it done.”  And again, I 
had people around me at all times.  I was the boss.  But we worked together…  If you go out into battle, you’d want 
the guys to come in with you that I had because they would do anything for ya.  It was such a special thing.  This is a 
monumental staircase.  We do this every day.  And it’s cantilever and there’s probably 4,000 pounds of steel up 
there, and concrete.  You notice there’s no columns.  [Yeah.  How does that not fall?  Was this on Michigan 
Avenue?]  We’ve done 50…  [Lots of those, ok.]  But yeah…  Every fancy stair looks like this at the bottom and I 
got a couple of pictures I think.  But…so…   
 
46:27  But when you have quality guys that know that, see, there’s a bunch of steel on the floor here.  And there’s a 
bunch of steel up here.  When you fold and weld these things, it all stands on its own.  So there’s a science to it.  But 
there’s Kentucky limits too.  How high do you keep it up because when you kick the tempered legs off, its going to 
deflect.  So…and…  Beings that it’s cladded with glass, you can’t have much deflection in this.  [Yeah, because 
otherwise it would all break.]  So…that’s when 63 and Local #1 are just miles apart.  You put a Local #1 guy in and 
he’s gonna say, “What?!?”   
 
47:00  [Did you do the stairs in the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue?]  Ya know, it’s funny you say that.  We’re 
gonna be re-doing all of them.  I’ve been there.  In fact, I got the job.  I just bid on it.  [Well, yeah, I heard you 
mention Apple and I thought maybe you guys had done those stairs.].  Yeah, we just did North Avenue…  [Oh, you 
did.]  That’s stainless steel.  All that glass there on the frontage.  [Yeah.]  In fact, if you’re ever at the Apple Store, 
just see the simple thing like the rain gutter on the floor.  It goes all the way around the building.  Every piece is 
lined up perfectly with the granite floor.  It’s exactly welded.  It is exactly the same centers all the way around.  I 
mean it’s a work of art, just the gutter system that your standing on and spitting your gum into.  But that’s what 
Local #63 does.  This is another stair case that we did.  And again, I just brought two of these just to show ya.  This, 
you know…  Not only did we do the steel, the same guys that muscle in these thousand-pound stringers, which we 
also do the glass and we also do…same guys.  So…these are talented guys.  And the other one…   
 
48:06  This one…  This is the CTA Barn, or Pace, in Schaumburg.  If you ever go there, it’s between Higgins and 
Sheldon Road, right there.  There’s like 20 of these.  But if you look at it, each individual one is kind of interesting.  
But in order to get them all in line…  This is where the buses go underneath and keep the people from getting rained 
on.  It’s a depot.  But if you look at it, it’s kind of neat because all these pipes and everything had to be just right.  
You talk about 20 feet in between with radiuses, you gotta be on the money.  And that’s Local #63 does.  Wow, 
that’s great.  Very impressive.]  
 
49:46  And what you see here is probably only about 1/100th of what I’ve been involved with 63.  But Local #63, 
you probably multiply that by a hundred again.  We’re a big outfit and we do this stuff, but there’s probably ten 
good outfits that can do this all day long.  And that’s, as far as I’m concerned, Al Pellacore.  These people kept 
coming up, coming up from the way. . .  It all starts at the top as far as I’m concerned.  If you have good leadership, 
it’s an easy thing, it’s an easy thing for the men to follow.  And to be part of because they know it’s a good thing.  
[Yeah.  Well thanks.  I appreciate it.]  It’s my pleasure.  [Lots of fun.] 
 
END 49:35
