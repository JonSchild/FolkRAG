When Luna's Beams are Brightly 
Shining. 
Sung by the Virginia Trio. 
My own sweet love up there a 
sighing; 
I 
know for me you're pining; 
My love song now I 
sing to thee, 
Ah turn your ear inclining. 
To kiss the nectar of those lips, 
My loved one I 
pine, 
So come my love and meet me, 
When fair Luna's light does shine. 
C11ORIJS. 
The sun's gone down behind the hills, 
The moon and the stars are shining, 
My lady love come meet me where 
The moon's silver beams are shining. 
Like the troubador in days of old. 
I 
come to-night to greet thee; 
So come and join the lover, 
Who is waiting here to meet thee. 
When through life as man and wife, 
You link your fate to mine. 
We'll ne'er forget how oft we 
When met,
the silver moonbeams shine. 
Chorn3. 
Baby came when summer flowers, 
In the fields were sweetly growing, 
His presence brought info our hearts, 
A 
joy full to overflowing. 
But like the sweet June rose he died, 
And for him we sadly weep, 
'Neath where the purple lilacs bloom, 
Baby sleeps his last, last sleep. 
Crtoaus. 
He's gone where no care is known, 
And angels watch o'er him keep, 
The pride of our heart from us did part, 
And sleeps his last last sleep. 
You who have known a 
parents love. 
And can feel our bitter woe. 
Our baby's smile and innocence 
No more we'll see or know. 
O'er death's dark deep chasm. 
Baby's soul took its last leap, 
And our hearts are buried in the grave, 
Where he sleeps the last, last sleep. 
Chorus. 
The summer days have come again, 
And the birds sing from each tree; 
The nightingale's song so pure and sweet 
And the woods am fall of glee. 
II w 
we love to think of the days gone by, 
When we used to sing and dance with joy, 
When we were but little boys 
In our dear old southern home. 
Cnonrs. 
Hark, hark, hear the banjo ring, 
Listen, don't you hear thc dark es sing, 
It makes us feel so gay and free, 
To think of the days now gone, 
When we were happy darkey boys, 
In our dear southern home. 
Way down in the cotton fields, 
WVd wake up in de morn, 
How happy then we all would be, 
When we'd hear the dinner horn. 
And our hears were always light and free, 
In those (lays now gone, 
When we were but little boys, 
In our Southern home. 
Chorus. 
RECITATION. 
By Hank Goodman. 
A man like a 
pipe is made of clay, 
His brain the smoke 
So sadly puffed away, 
His blood the fire, 
To which the pipe is bent, 
A 
few short whiffs, 
And all the fire is spent. 
His food, tobacco, fills the hollow bowl, 
his biain the case, 
That holds the mighty soul, 
Brittle then, with bat a 
tiny stroke,. 
The man is dead, the pipe is broke. 
Sung by Miss JEssin M ERTON.

The sweetest treasure life can give 
I 
clasp unto my heart to- day, 
And childhood's golden moments live 
In dreams that soon must fade away. 
I 
see my angel mother's face, 
I 
hear her voice so true and brave, 
Her smile beams out with hallowed grace, 
From thee, my rose from mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, 
That grassy mound where willows wave ; 
Oh precious gem of countless worth, 
My rose from angel mother's grave. 
What memories cluster around it now, 
Like jewels around some holy shrine; 
Her loving hands are on my brow, 
Her eyes so fondly gaze in mine. 
I 
seem to gather to my breast 
The place and comfort life would crave. 
And dewy tears so fond and blest 
Are thine, dear rose from mother's grave. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, &c. 
it whispers that she dwells afar, 
-And watches o'er her loved ones here; 
Oh, brighter than the morning star 
Each. thought of thee my mother dear. 
Thy loving arms again caress me 
With all the hope and joy they gave, 
While fondly to my lips I 
press 
Thy leaves, my rose from mother's grave. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, ecc,

I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain ; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
f 
Ylis hair was turning gray, 
Oh, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care '•  
I 
left that home no friends to find , 
My heart was filled with pain,

To see it once again.

NETTLE MOORE. 
Copied by permission of Omvitis DITSON & CO., M USIC Dealers, 277 
Washington St., Boston. 
In a 
little white cottage where the trees are ever green, 
And the climbing roses blossom by the door, 
I've often sat and listened to the music of the birds, 
And the gentle voice of pretty Nettie Moore. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
miss you, Nettie Moore, 
And my happiness is o'er, 
While a 
spirit sad around my heart has come, 
And the busy days are long, 
And the nights are lonely now 
For you are gone from our little cottage home. 
Below us in the valley, on the Santee's dancing tide, 
Of a 
Summer eve I'd launch my open boat ; 
And when the moon was rising and the stars began to shine, 
Down the river we so merrily would float. 
Oh, I 
miss you, &c. 
One sunny morn in Autumn, ere the dew had left the lawn 
Came a 
trader up from Louisiana bay ; 
Who gave to master money, and then shackl'd her with 
chains. 
And then he took her off ty work her life away. 
Oh, I 
miss you, &c. 
Since that time the world is dreary, and I 
long from earr,. 
to rise, 
'
4 And join the happy angels gone before, 
I 
never can be merry 'or my heart is lull of woe, 
And I'm pining for 'In? pretty Nettie Moore. 
Oh, I 
miss you, 
You are gone, lovely Nettie, and my heart must surely 
break, 
When the tears come no more into my eyes ; 
But when weary life is past, I 
shall meet you once again, 
In Heaven, darling, up above the skies. 
Oh, I 
miss you, ke. 
Man is but a 
Pipe and His Life is but Smoke. 
As Originally sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
CONTENTED I 
sit with my pipe and my glass, 
Puffing sorrow and care far away, 
Though liquor may banish man's reason afar, 
He's only a 
fool or a 
sot, 
While his sense and his reason are always at war, 
He don't know when enough he has got. 
CHORE'S. 
Though many may laugh, others may joke, 
Man's but a 
pipe and his life is but smoke. 
Now man and a 
pipe are much nearer to kin, 
Than ever you have understood, 
For until with breath they are both filled within, 
Pray tell me for what are they good; 
For the one and the other composed are of clay, 
And if right I 
tell nature's plan, 
It takes but the breath from them both right away, 
The pipe dies and so doth the man. 
Though many may, &s. 
Now I'm told by my pipe man's lot is to die, 
For sooner or later he must, 
And when to the end of life's journey he's got, 
Like a 
pipe that's smoked out he's but dust; 
Then all you that wish in your hearts to be gay, 
Encourage not grief, strife nor sorrow, 
Make much of your pipe of tobacco to-day, 
ror you may be smoked out on the morrow. 
Though many may, Sse.

And inhaled the sweet pe,.fume.

Where the honeysuckle grows, 
And the blue-birds sing their lay, 
Where first I 
met my little sweet tube-rose, 
My lovely little blue-eyed Lulu Hay.

With the story of my love.

leaf of ivy from the grave;

And ' tis only in my visions, 
That I

Mother died when I 
was quite young, 
And it :oon broke up my home; 
Soon I 
found I 
was not. welcome, 
And like a 
stranger I 
did roam: 
All I've got now to remember her, 
And which 1 
chcrish and will save 
Is this little leaf of Ivy, 
A 
leaf of Ivy from my mother's grave. 
(Chorus). 
Since mother's death I 
feel forsaken, 
And o'er the wide world I 
have roamed; 
Until, when my poor heart was breaking, 
With my brother, then, I 
found a 
home ; 
From mother well not long be parted, 
Soon we'll meet her up above. 
Where well ne'er again be parted, 
But will livP in joy and endless love.

HUNGRY MAN FROM HARLEM. 
Written by Harry Bennett, and sung J. D. Rootne. 
Of a 
hungry man, I 
am going to sing, 
And pity to your heart will bring, 
He swallowed almost every thing, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
He'd eat a 
hundred times a 
day, 
His boarding bill he couldn't pay, 
He'd get out side of a 
bale of hay, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
CHORUS. 
The way he would eat, it couldn't be beat., 
All kinds of meat, both sour and sweet, 
He'd eat every thing they had in the place, 
And bit a 
big chunk from his mother- in law's face, 
He chewed up his father, devoured his mother, 
He swallowed his sister, and tackled his brother, 
lie swallowed the clock, bit a 
hole in the door, 
Chewed up the roof, and swallowed the floor, 
He chewed up his shoes, he chewed up his hat, 
Made a 
raid on the kitchen and swallowed the cat, 
lie chewed umbrellas, and eat up the stove. 
And bit the broadside from the servants girl's nose, 
But he never had enough to eat, from hunger he was sick, 
He'd eat a 
pair of army shoes. and pulverize a 
brick, 
To see him tackel turkey would cause you to smile, 
He'd eat a 
horse and cart, and chase the driver a 
mile. 
He ate so much it made him thin, 
His hair fell out, and his clothes fell in, 
His bones was sticking through his skin, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
He struck this city one fine day, 
But for a 
meal he couldn't pay, 
He took a 
walk along Broadway, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
Crtoaus. 
The very first thing ne chanced to meet, 
Was a 
German band corning down the street, 
lie swallowed them all as fast as they come, 
He chewed up their music, and ate up the drum, 
He tackled a 
crowd coming home from a 
ball, 
They began for to dance, and he swallowed thern all, 
Went down to the ferry and swallowed a 
boat, 
Went out on election day and swallowed the vote, 
At last he came in Brooklyn town, 
He met big a 
preacher and gobbled him down, 
He swallowed a 
pump picked his teeth with the handle, 
And ate the reporter of the Brooklyn scandal, 
Then getting disgusted with being so light, 
He swallowed himself and went out of sight. 
It was only on the tenth of last November, 
That we heard the news we ever shall remember; 
That tile tire-king had cast its burning embers 
O'er another fated city in our land. 
As the woeful tidings flashed along the wire, 
Of this oi her sad catastrophe so dire, 
That Boston, beauteous city, was on fire, 
And sinking 'needh the fiend's relentless hand. 
CHORL'S. 
Fire 
fire I 
was heard the cry, 
In every breeze that passed us by, 
And all the world did heave a 
sigh of pitg ; 
Fervent prayers to heaven to aid, 
Before the fire in ruins laid, 
Fair Boston, beauteous city. 
And all through the terrible commoticli, 
The wind blew a 
gale from off the ocean, 
The brave firemen worked with all devot1011, 
To laugh at their efforts yet it seemed; 
And soared with fiery prayer still higher, 
O'er chimney top, steeple and church spire, 
Till all was one vast flame of fire, 
And the light around the horizon gleamed. 
Fire I 
fire 
was heard, etc 
But who saved the city from a 
panic, 
From the rule of a 
fire-king too iyrannic, 
But the brave-hearted firemen and mechanic, 
The best and the noblest in the land ; 
kat brighter than t 
e 
soldier's record ol glory, 
Aro the names of those who live in song or stM7.1 
Who rebuild the city to its former glory, 
And build her up, if possible, more grand. 
CHORUS. 
And soon will no trace remain, 
Of this vast sea of flame, 
Boston will rise again remember; 
Brave men will be fount, 
Who will build a 
fairer town, 
Like Chicago. from the gi ound, 
Betere the next November.

wear them till I 
die. 
(Repeat.) 
It's a 
shame on the stage, how they mimic our race, 
In a 
style that's a 
mystery to me, 
How the people in front, will stand such insult; 
Receiving such blockheads with glee. 
If they went to old Ireland they'd find their mistake, 
For our boys and our girls are well dressed, 
In manners as well to you I 
will tell, 
For they stand in the land with the best. 
CHORUS. 
For in singing, and dancing and all kinds of sport, 
And if ever to Ireland you went, 
From their heads to their toes, they all wear decent clothes, 
I 
speak of a 
true Irish gent. 
Sure they make up their faces, and look just like fools, 
And they walk like a 
dog with three legs, 
If they went to old Ireland, to show them such sport, 
They'd be pelted with stones and bad-eggs: 
For it's there you'll find ladies and gentlemen too, 
Educated, kind-hearted and true, 
And I 
hope for to see, that little Isle free, 
And the green with the red, white and blue. 
For in singing kc., 
THE BRIDGE. 
I 
STOOD on the brith4e at midnight, 
As the clocks were striking the hour 
And the moon rose o'er the city, 
behind the dark church-tower. 
And, like tie waters rushing 
Among the wooden piers, 
A 
flood or thoug,hte came o'er me, 
That filled my eyes with tears— 
How often, oh ! how often, 
In the days that 1141 gone by, 
I 
had stood on that bridge, at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky ! 
How often, oh ! hew often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stock, on that bridge, at midnight, 
And gazed CI, that ware and sky ! 
How often, oh ! how often, 
had wished that that ebbing tide 
Wouid bear me away on its bosom, 
O'er the ocean wild and wide! 
For my heart was hot and restless, 
And my life was full of care: 
And the burthen laid upon me 
Seemed greater than I 
could bear--
But now it has fallen from me, 
It is buried in the sei, 7

"BECAUSE I'M POOR. 
And only the sorrow of others 
Throws its shadow over me; 
Yet, whenever I 
cross the river, 
On its bridge with wooden piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the ocean 
Comes the thought of other year: 
And for ever, and for ever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passions., 
As long as life has woes. 
The moon and its broken reflection, 
And its shadows shall appear 
As the symbol of love in Heaven 
Andliti wavering image here.

Words and Music by J. F. 
SHERIDAN. 
I'm a 
man who has seen better days in my time: 
I've not always been what I 
seem. 
I 
look on the bright faded past with a 
sigh, 
The present seems like a 
sad dream. 
Once I 
had plenty, my purse it was full 
No cause had I 
then to demure. 
But o'ersmy bright sun there came a 
dark cloud 
And reduced me to what I 
am— poor I 
CHORUS. 
Friendless, alone, through the streets I 
roam, 
Seeking a 
sustenance from door to door. 
All pass me by, disdain in their eye; 
None care to know me because I'm poor. 
I 
once drove my gay four-in-hand in the park, 
Their speed with success I 
did test • 
My broadcloth and linen superior then, 
My wines‘md my table the best. 
My friends they were legion shook wehimy hand; 
I, fool like, thought none could be truer! 
But when the cole hand of adversity came 
They left me because I 
was poor. 
Friendless, alone, etc.

I 
wear two lovely emblems, 
United on my breast, 
The honored " Harp of Erin," 
That land I 
love the best. 
A

So modest to be seen. 
That Harp that shines with glory, 
The Shamrock so fair and green.

My bles!=ings on those emblerar 
Of Erin across the sea. 
May they adorn the banners 
Proclaiming Ireland free. 
Vhe reason why I

So closely to my heart, 
Those gems of priceless treasure, 
United never to part, 
&cause that little Shamrock, 
Was fair and pure to see, 
The Harp was like the utterings, 
Of mother love to me. 
My blessing on those. etc. 
My mother wrought that gold harp, 
With tresses of her hair;

Did make a 
Shamrock fair.

Before I 
crossed the sea, 
Amid bade me wear those emblems,

There are songs unsung in ev'ry heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded, and withered, and dead. 
Oh ! beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS— 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh ! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsurr,-, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish. 
Tho' some are sombre and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clung, 
They are set in tears and never can die, 
Oh ! sorrowful songs unsung, 
Beautiful songs unsung, & et, 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love. 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad, wild dream, 
Cherished and loved, yet broken. 
And, oh! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kissed by death, 
Oh I 
sorrowful sungs unsung. 
Beautiful songs unsung, &v. 
CUR AT MY HEELS. 
—So:— 
As sung by W ILLIAMS & SULLY to many smiles 
I 
dislike to trust men who hang on to the truth, 
And haven't the nerve to tell lies; 
I 
like to hear a 
man say he killed fifty bears, 
When he knows in his heart they were flies. 
It may not be pleasant to have five thousand dollars 
Given you by each tramp you meet, 
But it's better to find your mother-in-law drunk 
Than to judge a 
poor girl by her feet. 
CHORUS: 
For I 
do like a 
Tom cat with a 
high tenor voice, 
A Maria that can kick, fight and steal; 
I 
like a 
spitz poodle with all kinds of fleas, 
But I 
don't like a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to see a 
chambermaid in a 
hotel 
Go through every new boarder's trunk, 
I 
like to see a 
preacher on Sunday in church, 
And on Monday in debt or on a 
drunk; 
I 
don t 
iike a 
maiden of sweet sixty-four 
To tell me she's just seventeen, 
But give me the girl from old Boston town 
Who can wrestle with baked pork and beans. 
Cuoitus: 
toor I 
do like boiled eggs that have seen better days, 
I 
can paralyze all kinds of veal; 
I 
can battle successfully with all kinds of soup. 
But I 
don't care to miss a 
square meal.

Chorus.

Oh, mother, what do they mean by blue, 
And what do they mean by gray. 
Was heard from the lips of a 
little child, 
As she bounded in from play. 
The mother's eyes filled up with tears, 
She turned to her darling fair, 
And smoothed away from the sunny brow, 
Its treasures of golden hair. 
Why, mother's eyes are blue my sweet, 
And grandpa's hair is grey, 
And the love we bear our darling child, 
Grows stronger every day; 
But what did they—persisted the child— 
For I 
saw two cripples to- day, 
And one of them said he fought for the blue, 
The other, he fought for the gray. 
Now, no of the blue had lost a 
leg, 
The other had but one arm; 
And both seemed worn and weary and sail, 
Yet their greeting was kind and warm. 
They told of battles of days gone by, 
Till it made my i'-ung blood thrill. 
The leg A179- ,st in the Wilderness fight, 
And the arm on Malvern Hill. 
They sat on the stone by the farm-yard gate, 
And talked for an hour more, 
Till their eyes grew °right, and their warm hearts seemed, 
With fighting their battles o'er, 
And parting at last with a 
friendly grasp. 
In a 
kindly, brotherly way; 
Each called on God, to speed the time, 
Uniting the blue and the gray.

A 
VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE. 
Words and Music by Winn H. Fox. 
Raging by Wm. McALooN in all the principal Theatres in Anybrics., an0 
by O'NEIL & CoNhoy. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gac, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A small Tiolq T. plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORITS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
now well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

When the curtains of night are pinned back by the stars, 
And the beautiful moon leaps the s 
ies, 
Aud the dew- drops of heaven ar - kissing the rose, 
It is then my memory flies, 
As if on the wings of some beautiful dove, 
In haste with the message it bears, 
To bring you a 
hiss of affection and say; 
" 
I 
remember you, love, in my prayers." 
CHORUS. 
Go where you will, on land or at sea, 
I'll share all your sorrows and cares, 
And, at night, when I 
kneel by my bed-side and pray. 
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers. 
I 
have loved you too fondly to ever forget 
The love you have spoken to me, 
And the kiss of affection still warm on my lips, 
When you told me how true you would be— 
I 
know not if fortune be fickle or iriend. 
Or if time on your memory wears, 
I. know that 1 
love you wherever you roam, 
And remember you, love, in my prayers. 
Chorus. 
When heavenly angels are guarding the good, 
As God has orda ned them to do, 
In answer to prayers I 
have offered to Him, 
I 
know there is one watching you; 
And may its bright spirit be with you through life, 
To guide you up heaven's bright stairs, 
And meet with the one who has loved you so true, 
And remember you, love, in her prayers.

Oscar Wilde Fresh, 
A. 
CHARACTER SONG. 
Wr.tten and sung by Billy Moore, in Moore and Vivian's 
Latest and Greatest Success, Fresh the Artist. 
I 
am an artist and ehromos I 
paint, 
In the greatest style ever you saw; 
You give me a 
handcart or a 
check on a 
bank, 
And 1'11 show you how well I 
can draw, 
My pictures the ladies admire very much, 
I'm immense in whatever I 
do; 
And with them I 
flirt and all do declare, 
Oscar Wilde Fresh is too, too. 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
baby, some call me a 
lady, 
But I 
honestly tell them I 
ain't; 
But I'm just like the girls with false teeth and curls, 
We both are great dealers in paint. 
Now down to the sea shore in summer I 
go, 
The ocean and beach for to sketch; 
But the ladies attention I 
sooner would draw, 
And try bard a 
mash for to catch. 
rl'o the last exibition a 
picture I 
sent, 
Of an Indian on the war path, 
They scalped the poor red man and put him 
on the root,

So judge of ray horror and wrath, 
I'd Like to Make That Little Girl 
My Own. 
By E. C. Dunbar, 
Sold by him to Fred Roberts. 
I'm fond of pretty flowers that decorate the earth, 
And spread their sweetest of perfume far and near. 
I'm fond of pretty music that cheers the sad of heart, 
And pleases with softest charm the ear. 
I'm fond of pretty jewels,I don't care what they are, 
The diamond, the ruby or the pearl 
But I'll tell you what I'm fonder of, yes, fonder of by far, 
And that's a 
very pretty, pretty girl, 
And I 
have got a 
very pretty girl. 
CHORUS. 
She's as pretty as a 
bunch of early violets in the spring. 
As happy as a 
skylark singing on the wing, 
She's as fair as any fairy, and if I 
was a 
king, 
I'd like to make that little girl my own. 
In a 
pretty little cottage just underneath the hill, 
With roses and clematis all around, 
Beside the running brooklet that turns the water wheel. 
My pretty little violet's to be found. 
As artless as a 
maiden of sweet seventeen should be, 
Her eyes as blue as heaven's sky alone. 
Her hair is bright and shining like a 
casket of gold, 
And the color of her cheek is all her own, 
The color's not laid on but nature's own.

When I waA only ten years old, I've heard my mother 
say, 
When was quite a 
baby I'd such a

When I 
was only twelve years old, a 
queer complaint 
I 
had, 
They called it kleptomania, and I 
had it very had. 
The old folks tried their best this ere complaint to cure, 
But no, 'twas all in vain, break out ' twas certain sure, 
But picking oakum cured me: Zor' I 
did'nt feel the same, 
So I turned my pretty talents

Though beauties may smile and try to ensnare,

I'M STILL A 
FRIEND TO YOU, 
(AwswER TO " You've Been a 
Friend to Me.") 
As Sung by ED. SCULLY. 
Ah! years have come and gone, dear Tom, 
The past seems like a 
dream, 
When you and I 
together met 
By the winding stream. 
When hand in hand we promised, Tom, 
To each. we would be true; 
Old time has made no change in me, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
CHORUS. 
I'm still a 
friend to you, dear Tom 
Alas! there are but few 
Have ever been as kind and true, 
As I 
have been to you. 
How often have I 
wept, dear Tom, 
When thinking o'er the joys 
The happy scenes of long ago, 
When you and I 
were boys; 
But now I'm told, you're very poor, 
Your days in life are few ; 
It gives me joy to meet you, Tom, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
I'm still a 
friend, .
5,:o 
Old friendship often withers, Tom, 
Whene'er a 
man grows poor; 
The rich and proud forget old friends, 
And know them then no more; 
But keep that honest heart of yours, 
- We'll make old friendship new; 
I 
care not what the world may say, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
I'm still a 
friend, &e,

To dwell by the river side t 
You told me I'd be happy, 
But no happiness I

Alone, all alone by the sea-side he leitnk 
And no other's bride I'll be; 
For in bridal flow'rs he deek'd me, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
From my cottage by the sea- side. 
I

I 
can see those hills and valleys, 
Where with pleasure I 
have roamed ; 
The last time that I 
met him, 
Oh, how happy then were we, 
But to-ni ht I 
am a 
widow, 
In the Cottage by the sea. 
Oh! my poor and aged father, 
How in sorrow he would wail. 
And my poor and aged mother, 
how in tears her eyes would swell. 
A

Oh, how he would weep for me, 
If he only knew his sister, 
Was a

PAT ROACH AT THE PLAY, 
ItultiC Of this long can, be obtanewl of E. II. H ARDING, 258 Bower: 
AS Pat Roach and the missus trom Galway, 
In Dublin once happened to be, 
To the playhouse they went one fine evening, 
Determined diversion to see; 
But says Pat as he entered there's no one, 
• " Pay here," cried a 
voice, " holy murther," 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
" 
Pay here," cries a 
voice, " hody- inurtn,4r," 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
The missus she looked all around her, 
In wonder her eyes they did roll, 
But says she " Paddy darling, alanaa, 
He is here like a 
rat in a 
hole, 
Pay here, how much is it ? a 
shilli g; 
A 
shIlting apiece, that won't do, 
"Ils too much. Mister Pay here avourneevt, 
Eighteen pince I 
will give you fo .
.• two, 
"'is too much, Mister Pay here avourneen. 
Nighteen pince I 
will give you for two. 
Pat grumbled but paid and got seated, 
The band was beginning to play, 
He j 
igg'd on his seat quite elated, 
And to the musicians did say, 
"*Tis yer salves that can do it, me houchali 
And I 
wish to ye's wid all my mind, 
To the tiddlers more power to your elbowsk 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind, 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer win& 
Tte play then went on, and Pat wondered, 
And sat with his mouth open wide, 
Is tile proud haughty Lord of the Manor, 
Sought to make the fair maiden his bride; 
"To the mountains," says he, " I 
will bear thee,' 
She shrieked as she saw him approach, 
" 
Is there no - ) ne at hand now to save me?" 
Shouts a 
voice, " yis, me darlin, Pat Roan 
Then up on the seat, jumped brave Paddy. 
Says he, " now you blackguard, be gone, 
Or a 
lord though you be, tin times over, 
I'll knock your two eyes into one:— 
" 
Sit down there in front!" " what you spal Pee*: 
Is it me you thus dar to addriss, - 
Pe ye think that Pat Roach would sit siey, 
And see that poor girl in distress? 
wuffle ensued in a 
minute, 
But soon sure the row did subside. 
Asid as 
at gasped for breath he discovered. 
Of the door he was on the wrong side; 
He soon found the missus, next morning 
They started for home, and Pat swore., 
If he once safely landed in Galway, 
he'd come up to Dublin no more. 
I'LL sing you a 
song of a 
pretty little gal: 
Ohl she was a 
high 
Her hair 
hair it was red, and curled about her head, 
She's de Queen of de Concert Saloon. 
You will see her, every night dressed in blue and white, 
Anti her apron all trimmed off with yaller: 
Her smiles are fascinating when on de folks she waits, 
And breaks de hearts of all de pretty fellers. 
With a 
little paint and powder, she looks like a 
rose 
Or a 
sun-flower out in full bloom: 
Her nose it is pug, and sits on her little mug, 
And her breath is de sweetest of perfume. 
Her teeth dey am false but deli' color am green, 
And she's left-handed in bofe feet: 
Each night out de door dere is lovers by scores, 
Who take her down to Taylor's for a 
treat. 
Dare was a 
young man who fell in love 
Wid dis little charming young dear: 
For, he seen hey, one night when he was tight, 
In de concert saloon peddling beer: 
He spent his money like a 
sailure so bould, 
And swore dat he'd marry her soon: 
But she played de poor feller for all he was worth: 
Den eloped from de_concert saloon. 
Now, this young maid was sweet thirty-five, 
But she looked like a 
woman of twenty: 
And her little pug nose was as red as a 
rose, 
But for all that she had lovers plenty. 
Her teeth was false, and so was her heart, 
Her skin was dark just like an Octoroon: 
So young fellers, take my advice: Shim de waiter gals 
What tends in de concert saloons.

I've just arrived in town you see, to spend a 
week or two, 
But I've been so vexed since I've been here, I 
don't know what 
to do, 
For everybody says to me no n.atter where I 
be, 
And whatever I 
am doing this is what they say to me, 
CHORUS. 
At it again, at it again, 
You rascal I'm looking your at it again, 
You're a 
naughty young man, I 
see very plain, 
You rascal I'm looking, your at it again. 
I 
took a 
cab when I 
arrived, and drove at once up town, 
And because I'd not pay double fare the "cabby" then did frown 
He said he'd take me to the Mayor, and of me he'd complain, 
Then the crowd said I 
was cheating, and cried out " you're at 
it again." 
At it again, etc. 
I 
paid him then to go away, and sneaked off very soon, 
And being as it were upset, I 
entered a 
saloon, 
I 
drank three brandies right clean off to ease my troubled brain 
When a 
youngster poked his head in the door, and cried out 
" 
you're at it again." 
At it again, etc. 
When evening came I 
took a 
stroll, the sights in town to see, 
And I 
met a 
lovely creature, who seemed pleased at meeting 
me. 
We walked awhile, and bye- and-bye, in a 
restaurant we went, 
And in a 
cozy little supper room, we soon were quite rtontent. 
Spoken.—We had a 
nice supper together, and after supper, I 
asked the young lady for a 
kiss, and just as she got her dear 
little mouth all puckered up for that delightful sensation, the 
infernal waiter put his head in the door, and shouted out— 
At it again, etc.

Sung at the Olympic 
In your path through life each day, you will meet upon ee 
way, 
Fellow mortals upon whom this world doth frown, 
Who, from poverty or crime, have fallen in their time, 
Or by circumstances crushed and striken down; 
Young inen with blighted names, who once had noble aims, 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whog
mrav, 
aekindly word might save, from a 
dark, dishonored 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
sneer, 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone; 
You know not what's in store, for the loved ones you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own, 
The shop girls on the street, with as much respect should meet, 
As the millionaire who in his carriage rolls, 
-And the honest laboring man, with his strong and horny hand. 
They too have hearts and feelings—yes, and souls; 
Their family is as dear to them as any here, 
Though their clothes mai fnolit‘ragged, torn and old.

THE SPADE 
As originally sung by GRIFF BOWDEN. 
VINT me the Spade and the man who can use it: 
A 
fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neighb5r, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHoung.—Give me the spex3e, 
Gkve me the spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak cf its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Created our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the queen of all weapons—the Spade, boys, the Spas 
Give me the spade, tt c. 
give me the Spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done, boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yelling, 
Where our stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
ow the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then lInrrati for aur Inie friend, the Spade, boys, the Spade 
Give ,ne the spade, Ice.

WHEN Erin first rose from the dark swelling flood, 
Goa blessed the green island, ant saw it was good: 
The Emerald in Europe, it sparkled and shone, 
In the ring ot the world, the most precious stone. 
In her SIM, in het soil, in her station thrice test, 
With her bac': toward Britain, and her ' ace to the West; 
Erin stands proudly insular, on 'her steep shore, 
Anil strikes her high harp, ' mid the ocean's deep roar. 
By the groamis that ascend from your forefather's grave, 
For their country t 
has lett to the brute and the slave; 
Drive the demon of bigotry home to his den, 
And where 
rants made brutes, now let Erin make men. 
Let her soils, like t 
be leaves of the shamrock unite, 
A 
partition of sects, from one foot-stalk of right, 
Give each his full share of the earth and the sky, 
Nor fatten the slave where the serpent would die, 
Alas! for poor Erin, that sonic are still seen, 
Who would dye the grass red, from their hatred to green; 
Yet, oh when we're up, and they're down let theta live, 
Then yield them th .t 
mercy which they would not give. 
Aria of Erin be strong, but be gentle, as brave, 
And uplifted to strike, be still ready to save 
Let no feeling of vengeance prenme to defile, 
The cause of, or man of, the Emerald Isle. 
The cause it is good, and the men they are true, 
And the green shall unite with the Red, White, and Blue 
And the triumphs of Erin her daughter shall share, 
With the full swelling chest, and the fair flowing hair. 
Their bosoms he..ve high for the worthy and brave, 
But no cowards shall rest in that full swelling wave; 
Men of Erin awake, and make haste to be blest, 
RiSO arch of the Ocean, and que 
of the West.

applause at Coone)'s Opera House, Stony Point, N. Y.

At Long Branch or Cape May, 
Some ruralize at West Point,

But when I

I 
take my sweetheart and we go 
Up to the Mormon land. 
CHORUS. 
Up in the Mormon land, folks are not shy, 
Up in the Mormon land, how's that for high, 
Up in the Mormon land a 
matrimonial band, 
The easy place for courting is the Mormon land. 
The rules of strict society, 
Are not to Mormon taste, 
And if I'm so disposed I 
pu', 
My arm around her waist. 
Their notions of morality. 
Are not so very grand, 
And so they do jnst what they please, 
Within the Mormon land.

UP A- TREE 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
YOU see before you one who's been, 
In life through many a 
changing scene 
And yet withal a 
little green, 
Of course I 
know it now. 
Altho' I've been unfortunate, 
You will allow Inc to relate, 
That once I 
owned a 
large estate, 
'Twas then friends used to bow. 
" 
Dear Jack, old boy," they then would say, 
I'm proud of such a 
meeting . 
How do you do '! where have you been 
Your looking well I 
see ; 
But now they've grown so very shy, 
They can't afford a 
greeting— 
In vulgar phraseology, 
Because I'm up a 
tree. 
I 
once could give good dinners, 
'twas thei tl.e hungry sinners, 
Would haunt my tabl-t 
Praise my ju,iguh-nt, jokes and wine, 
Join in con-vi-vi-ality, 
Accept my hospi-tal-i-ty, 
Until tilrough prodiga-h-ty, 
My fortune did decline. 
And so did they, for one by one; 
Delivered by the Irrepressible eccentric, Billy Moore. 
Angelina Concertina Too Fresh, 
Lives on cam pt tacks; 
She asked an Italian barber, 
To cut her hair with an ax. 
Her masher, Augustus Gum Drop, 
Tried to kiss her rosy cheeks, 
The white wash and red paint on them, 
Made him sick for weeks, 
Yet the 
or girl cried her eyes out. 
She had a 
lot of trauple, 
This poor dear a 
gelic soul, 
They wrapped an American flag around her. 
And used her for a 
barber's pole. 
She eloped with a happy Itotentot, 
Named Wall-hoo-wrin-tun-ching, 
When she got six weeks on the island, 
Instead of a 
wedding ring. 
'Twas only a 
thousand years after, 
She said she was sweet sixteen, 
She married a 
song and dance man, 
Gus O'Lee Margerine. 
But lie had six wives in Texas, 
And twelve more out in Kalamazoo, 
He sailed over to Hoboken, England, 
- in her little number twelve shoe, 
No wonder the poor girl cried her eyes out.

Oh, well I 
remember the days of long ago, 
I 
wander'd with you by my side; 
Your hand in my own love, your cheeks with 
rosy glow, 
Were blushing with happy love and pride. 
We stray'd by the brooks and the sweet birds 
were singing, 
But sweeter the words that you spoke; 
I 
dream of you now ( ho' tis all past away, 
For love in my heart then awoke. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas under the tree, the old apple tree, 
'Twas under the blossoms in Spring's gentle 
glow; 
Oh, then I 
was happy you gave your heart to me, 
Under the blossoms long ago. 
Tho' years have departed and roses of our youth, 
have faded like blossoms of old; 
Still, love, you are dearer in kindliness and truth, 
And beaming with gladness all untold. 
We 
still may regret happy days of our Springtime, 
While round us tis Winter so drear; 
Yet love's gentle bloom in our hearts still remain, 
With mem'ries of youth ever dear.

Now don't you think it's very nice, in such a 
scene as this, 
To fix your arm around her waist—steal a 
gentle kiss, 
And whisper tales of love to her, and press her to your heart, 
And vow by all the purple heads your love will ne'er depart? 
Cho. — It's all among the clover, &e. 
Then pluck the gentle clover, that blushes at her feet, 
Then robe your love in garlands, there's nothing half so 
sweet, 
The rose will mantle on her cheek, her ey.:ti will sparkle 
bright, 
All among the clover, on a 
summer's night. 
Cho. — It's all among the clover, &c. 
There's nothing in this wide, wide world, could please you 
half so well, 
As strolling in the clover, with tales of love to tell; 
It makes your heart rebound with joy, and fills your soul 
_- 
with bliss, 
To stroll among the clover, and steal a 
loving kiss. 
Cho:—It's all among the clover. &c.

AN IMS.'iMAN'S WANT. 
As sung by MD.xs Mourax. 
ALL the way from Paddy's land. 
I've jist travell'd down, Sirs, 
To see the English quality 
It was I 
came to town, Sirs. 
To see the Queen I 
meant, 
Likewise the sweet princesses, 
All smother'd up with gold 
And jewels and fine dresses. 
Cnontts. 
For sure the Royal folk 
Poor Paddy wants to know, Sirs; 
To Erin's verdant Isle, 
He wishes they would go, Sirs. 
When I 
was on the Packet, faith, 
I 
wish'd I 
was on shore; 
For sure the ugly blackguards 
Hant fastened down the floor. 
But I 
came safe at last, 
And went out for an airing; 
But not a 
soul I 
saw 
Though I 
hurt my eyes with staring. 
For sure, dr.e. 
At last I 
met a 
Peeler 
By himself a 
struttin', 
With his ugly mouth brim full 
Of impudence and mutton.

mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would 
only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunatly, there is 
enough of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting" 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
hook, bound in Morrocco leather, costing twenty-nee eents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 24 -1'..eey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief , fan, glove and parasol. 
As there

abided by, or been rutted by the ansts-ers of this Oracle. No further lib-

usages of this country. The questions being more numerous, and the

American Fortune-Telling Cart,—This is the old-

published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clulss, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q, for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under. 
standing. Many professional Furtune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting; Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
tei meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments In such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Meueey
eoung ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
de 
too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
cp16-/tion. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further exptanation un. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards b not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening partiee.
