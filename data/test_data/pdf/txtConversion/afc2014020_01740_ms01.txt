00:15 I am a plant pathologist by training and am interested in biology. Went to grad school for plant 
pathology. Station here was my first job. Tobacco is a big agricultural industry in the state. Tobacco takes 
a significant portion of my time. Initially I was looking at the role of cysnemotodes and fusarium wilt. It 
was a disease that was threatening to essentially kill all the broadleaf tobacco in the valley. It was about 
20 percent losses.  At the time there was a pathologist who was working here at the lab, Gordon Taylor, 
doing some work to incorporate some resistance to fusarium wilt. I had previous done some work with 
cysnemotodes in New York with potatoes I worked in New Haven for a year and was doing work here 
looking at the role of cysnemotodes which was also present in the fields. There was an interaction that 
when cysnemotodes were present the fusarium wilt was much worse.it was spreading all over the 
valley, it spreads in seed, which is why is spreads so quickly at that point fields could not be recovered 
no controls to get fusarium out of the soil. Once it became severe farmers had to abandon the field. It 
was threatening the entire industry.  
2:40 At about that time Gordon Taylor retired and I moved up here. It increased my role in tobacco and I 
took some lines that Gordon had made crosses on and done breeding work and we eventually came up 
with a wilt resistant tobacco released in 1991 or 1992 which is now the dominant tobacco today, the 
variety people are growing 
3:15 (Dale asks how dominant tobacco is in the region) More recently it is going down but it has been as 
high as 75 to a 100 million dollars in the recent past between shade and broadleaf. For a long time there 
was about 1000 acres of Shade and as high as 15,000 dollars and acres 3-4 thousand acres of broadleaf 
but that is probably down to 1000-1500 of broadleaf and 500- 600  acres of shade. The acreage is down 
but it is a high value crop and it is keeping land in farm land. Some of these guys have grown tobacco for 
generations. The Thrall family were here when Windsor was started and they have been growing 
tobacco ever since. It is important other than dollar value too.  
4:35 I am the only pathologist here at the Valley laboratory so I do a little bit of everything. It is more a 
matter of whatever is the pressing issues that need to be solved. Consistently tobacco has been an 
important thing that I have been working on. IO have conti8nued Gordon’s breeding program and 
expanded it to different approaches. This station is the first experimentation station in the country. One 
our scientists came up with hybrid corn. We have been doing breeding for a long time. Every time there 
has been an issue that has threatened tobacco we have come up with a resistant tobacco type that has 
allowed them to continue production.  
6:00 The reason this valley laboratory is here is because of a tobacco disease, a bacterial disease called 
wild fire. Eventually they brought resistance in and other control mechanisms and because they were 
doing so much work up here they set up this tobacco substation.  
6:30 (Darcy asks, “when faced with a new disease what is the course of your day?) (Dale: this is a test 
station?) As scientists we try to stay on the cutting edge of what is going on.  So we do testing. Growers 
will bring us soil samples in the spring and throughout the year. We have educational meetings where 
we tell farmers what is going on are the new things and the issues that they have to deal with. They also 
bring seed her, we have a machine that was built in the 1920’s that they still use, and clean it out for the 
next year. They bring soil samples before they plant and when they have issues during the year if plants 
are not preforming well. Periodically we get new diseases. Blue mold is one in 1996 it had not been here 
since 1982. Targus rot has only been here a few years.  Continually there are new things that we need to 
deal with and we incorporate resistance as we go along. Try to bring in plants that have resistant genes 
then do conventional plant breeding to get it into our tobacco types so in 1987 I got plants that were 
from down south and were resistant to tobacco cysnemotodes and just a few years ago we finally 
released a Variety that is resistant.  
8:50 (Dale: how different is the tobacco from down south to the tobacco here?) It is very different. It 
grows differently, it cures differently. In addition, a much more stringent control of pathogens because 
cigarette tobacco is ground up, up to 25% of the leaf can be effected by this pathogen without creating 
serious losses. If we get one lesion on a leaf that leaf is bad. We get very serious losses very quickly. 
9:40 I have fields right across the street and we probably grow forty or fifty types of tobacco with certain 
genes that we want to capture. We make crosses, do evaluations, screen in the greenhouse over the 
winter. I am collecting seeds from resistant lines which we will screen and then put them in the field. 
Give them to growers who plant in them in their most heavily effected fields. Eventually we hope to 
come up with a plant that they can grow without sprays or grow in a field that they could not have 
grown in otherwise. Some things they can’t control. I can certainly have resistant plants but it has to be 
a good cigar wrapper which has certain specific characteristics. It has to be a certain color, the veins 
can’t be too strong, it has to have a certain kind of stretch and silky oily feel to it. 
11:30 (Dale: CT shade grown is now a breed and a seed so that you can grow CT shade tobacco 
anywhere) It is people taking advantage of the Connecticut name. What it comes down to is that we 
could grow Cuban tobacco because we could get Cuban seeds and grow it here but it is not really Cuban 
tobacco. People have CT seed and are growing it all over the world. The unfortunate thing is that they 
are not saying that it is Ecuadorian tobacco which is just fine. They are saying it is CT seed by the way it 
is grown in Ecuador.  
12:30 The genius and species is Nicotiana Tobacco. All these different tobacco types are the same 
species. CT shade grown seed is a type or a selection. Most of the tobacco that is grown here since early 
1800’s are cigar types. CT is known is for the quality of the cigar, binder and wrapper, which has just as 
much to do with the soils and the fact that it has been selected for a long time here.  I have people from 
Hawaii who want to grow CT seed and I tell them that they can take it and grow it in Hawaii in about 100 
years they will have a tobacco that has adapted well to Hawaii. There has been a long time for selection 
for the best types here with sandy soils, low mineral contents, which contributes to the quality it is 
almost like the terroir of wine. It effects how it burns, how it smells, how it tastes and the look of it. 
Having a CT seed does not guarantee that they can grow it well. 
 14:30 (Dale: What is your favorite problem handed to you in early spring?) We get all kinds of things. 
Ideally we can come up with ways for people to control things – rotation crops to knock nematodes 
down. One of the things I am proudest of is the Nematode resistant variety we released. It is better than 
fumigation. Nematodes are plant parasitic round worms that go into the roots of the plants that 
severely stunt them. They attach all kinds of crops. They are in the soil and some of the chemicals used 
to control them are fairly toxic. By coming up with resistance is fairly important. 
Dale: what is the time frame for coming up with resistance? I started in 1987 and it took 28 generations 
before we released a variety. We can do 1-2 generations a year. It may be resistant by not acceptable so 
we continue this till it is marketable tobacco that is also carrying resistance to fusarium wilt, tobacco 
mosaic virus, tobacco cyst nematodes and carries tolerance to ozone and air pollution and some 
resistance to blue mold which is important as well.  
17:00 (Dale: do you get out into the fields?) Yes. Growers will come in and tell me to come out and look 
around and see what is going on. Can’t always tell by samples that are coming in you have to see it in 
place. There is a disease that is called Frenching, a bacteria in the soil that produces an amino acid that 
causes the plants to grow tight and poor quality plants. It does not do well where tobacco has been 
growing in root zone of tobaccos. Happens in conditions where they have not planted tobacco for a 
while. Turns out there was a strip of the disease in a strip of road where they hadn’t planted for years. 
Sometimes you have to see the location to understand what is going on. Sometimes there is field is 
uniform and then it drops down and the plants are doing poorly and the field comes up again. That was 
an area where they had not fumigated because it wasn’t their field and then they incorporated the two 
fields. Sometimes the wetter area of the fields are more effected.  
19:15 Blue mold has probably been the most damaging. It is a downy mildew it is more related to brown 
algae than it is to fungi . These spores will land on a leaf and given wet conditions they will create a 
lesion about the size of a quarter. Come out one day and there is a yellow spot on a leaf, you turn it over 
and masses of new spores grow on the bottom of the lesion. Now there are a couple million spores that 
will spread. Within two weeks of finding the first lesion they are discing the whole field down. They are 
trying to control something where the infection probably occurred before they saw it. When it first 
showed up it caught people unaware. Growers didn’t put fungicides on the tobacco. Even for 
insecticides they’d treat little areas.  
21:15 (Dale: do you have a role once the tobacco has been picked?) A few years ago we had very humid 
warm conditions. Until the tobacco is packed and put away there are storage molds. It can be a perfect 
beautiful crop that can rot. People are still taking down the last of their tobacco around thanksgiving, 
then in January they start preparing for the next year. That is when we have our meetings and they start 
collecting their seed and suggest varieties we want them to try. It is a year round issue. 
23:00 (Darcy: have you seen farmers go under because of diseases?) When blue mold first occurred a 
farmer called me out to his field and his plants were heavily infected. It is like telling someone, “ ya that 
is blue mold and there is nothing you can do about it. Even if you could spray there will be new 
infections by next week when you want to harvest your tobacco.” He kind of knew this and was sitting 
there with him and he said well I guess that I have to get a job. He just put in an entire year and got less 
than zero.  It cost him 5-8 thousand dollars and acre just to produce it. I work on these diseases and do 
all these evaluations and I get a paycheck whether my experiments work or not. These farmers can lose 
it all. He is thinking to himself how do I keep my head above water?  
25:00 Hs the amount of tobacco depleted over the past year? Yes but not necessarily because of 
diseases. A lot of it is marketing and the demand for wrappers going down. I still think that CT cigar 
tobacco is the best in the world but it costs a certain amount. You can’t produce tobacco as cheaply here 
as you can in Nicaragua so if a manufacturer can buy a sheds worth of tobacco here for 250,000 dollars 
and get a so many boxes of cigars out of it and then can spend ten times less, sort through it, throw 
some of it out and have it be lesser quality but they can still call it CT tobacco well…..that has had an 
influence. It is the ecomonics. 
26:45 Other countries have called me about breeding work. Buyers might tell us about issues going on 
say in Ecuador. I have interaction with scientists in other countries but I don’t fly to Nicaragua and solve 
their problems. I had a grower come in and talk about a certain seed that she was growing that came  
from Nicaragua. It was a wilt resistant seed. It was called 8-1. I thought, this is real interesting. When I 
had started on wilt resistant we had a few varieties that I gave out to growers. One of the varieties that 
came in second or third that year was called an 8-1. Someone had taken that seed, given to a buyer who 
brought it to Nicaragua that had done well there. They are growing CT seed in Nicaragua that is resistant 
to wilt that we produced here in CT. From now on I produce here from now on will be male sterile that 
cannot be taken and grown somewhere else. Someone can take the seed and spend 10 years working to 
adapt it to their country they can. It is a global industry but I am only concerned with right here.  
29:30( Looking at two prints on the wall and Jim talks about an artist who asked for a few leaves that she 
took and drew.) She brought the prints back to me the next year. We have people come by who want to 
talk about their experiences with tobacco. 
31:15 (Favorite shed?) Not a shed but there is a certain time that I like. When the tobacco is cured but 
there is still a little moisture in it. You can walk down wind of a shed and you get this smell. My wife 
thinks they should make a Yankee candle out of the smell. There are certain sheds that have real 
character and have probably been there for 100 years or more and been beaten by weather and you go 
inside and they are chestnut so you know how old they are. Every shed has its own personality but what 
I love is the curing time right before they take it all down.
