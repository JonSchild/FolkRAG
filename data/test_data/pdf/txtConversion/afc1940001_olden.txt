[Chuck?] Ben RiceOld England's ShoresSweet Phoebus had just rosen showne shone bright or
the wayThe birds they were singing,all nature seemed gayI saw a coule standing on Old England's
shoreA-viewing of the ocean where the billows did roar.One was a lady so beautiful and fairThe
other was a soldier persuading of his dearPersuading of his dearest to cross the broad seaAnd when
we get to sailing then married we will be.Oh Sally, Oh Sally 'tis you I do adoreTo leave you behind me
it grieves my heart soreYour father he is rich ? and angry with meAnd if I stay in England my ruin he
will be.Young Sally looked sorry and hung down her headAt last she took courage and unto his she
said"I have concluded to go with you across the broad seaAnd we get [so?] sailing then married we
will be.She dressed herself in a suit of men's clothesStraightway to her father disguised she goesShe
purchased a fine vessel, paid down on demandBut little did he know 'twas his own fair daughter's
hand.Whe this old gentleman come this to understandHe swore a cruel vengeance upon this worthy
young manHe swore he would pursue them their lives he' destroyThey never should escape him
Fair Lady Gilderoy.He went unto yon captain a rage of dispairHe told him of his trouble, the truth he
did delcareSaying, "He never shall embrace her,; she shall not be his wifeAnd for her disobedience,
I'll have her sweet life.The ship it was made ready, all ready for fighting They heisted their top sails
and To bring them back to justice it was their heart's desireThey hoisted their top sails, and colors
they let flyThey swore by their Maker they'd conquer them or die.They had not been sailing [mor
'n?] aweek or ten days'Till the wind blew from the southeast;it turned into a gale ? They saw a ship
a-sailing which gives them more joyThat they had overtaken the Lady Gilderoy.They bid them turn
back to Old England's shoreAgainst them a volley of grape shot did pourAt last this brave soldier, he
made them this reply,"For the sake of sweet Sally, my foes I'll defy.Broadside to broadside the loud
cannons roarLike thunder from heaven the grape shots did pourAt last this brave soldier he won the
victoryDrank his health to sweet Sally in the life of McGee.
