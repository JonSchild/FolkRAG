EDDIE NORWOOD'S " SCHNIEDER MUSKEDEERS 
77 SONGSTER, 
TO THE PUBLIC. 
IT 
may not be considered effotistical in the author of this col-
,. 
leetion to present his name to the public, inasmuch as he has 
, 
been, for several years past, before the footlights as a 
character 
comedian and vocalist. 
As a representative of the peculiari-
ties incident to German character and idiom, familiarly desig-
nated as the Dutch, he has, be believes, achieved reputation 
while performing at the principal variety theatres of the United 
States, at all of which his performances have been well re-
ceived during numerous and satisfactory engagements. 
Among 
the theatres at which be has appeared with great applause can 
be mentioned the Theatre Comique, Scranton, Pa. ; the Thirty-
fourth Street Theatre, New York ; Wagner's Black Crook Com-
bination, and the Washington Varieties, Providence, R. I. 
In 
consequence of his comic and vocal talents, he flatters himself 
to have merited and obtained the good wishes of admirers and 
of friends throughout the Union. 
While gratefully returning 
thanks to the public for their kind indulgence and continuous 
favor, he places this little collection of vocal gems before them, 
trusting that it may remain a 
pleasant reminescence of the au-
- thor, who has the honor of subscribing himself 
The Public's humble servant, 
NEW YORE, March, 1874.

I AM COMING, 
MY DARLING, 
TO THEE. 
Am.—" Waiting my Darling for Thee." 
YES, I'm coming, my datlinfT, to meet thee, 
I 
haste to the vine- trellised bower, 
And all the more fondly you'll greet me, 
For keeping you waiting an hour; 
For a 
heart that is true ne'er grows weary, 
But sings of the charms of its mate, 
While contriving new joys for its dearie, 
But, love, I 
am sorry I'm late. 
Oh, the lilies and cowslips and roses, 
They may bloom ne'er so fair for a 
day, 
But the sweet flower a 
fond love discloses, 
It blossoms for ever and aye. 
CHORUS. 
I'm coming, yes, coming, 
I'm coming, my darling, to thee; 
I'm coming, yes, coming, 
I'm coming, my darling, to thee. 
The sweet pledge that a 
year you've been seeking, 
While saying my absence you grieve, 
It was modesty kept me from speaking, 
And fear that you wooed to deceive; 
But now through the mists of the twilight, 
I'm coming my promise to bring, 
For your smile warms my heart like the sunlight, 
My darlin ,, 
my pride, and my king! 
Oh, the lilies and cowslips and roses, 
They may bloom ne'er so fair for a 
day, 
But the flower a 
fond love discloses, 
It blossoms for ever and aye. 
I'm coming, yes, coming. etc.

TRUE TO THE CORE. 
As sung by Miss ANNIE BATELLE. 
M ANKIND drift along through this broad sea of care, 
With sunie, ' Lis foul weather, with others ' tis fair, 
Some help 0:ie another to reach the bright shore, 
While others sit silent despairing the more. 
ve a 
few wortl- to say if you'll list to my song, 
lour at ention I 
ash, I 
will not keep you long, 
My subject for s,m7, is a 
new one I'm sure, 
For I'll shift about men that were true to the core. 
Let me -
first • ing of one whom all Ireland love, 
Who gave -
11:i his hi.° 
his devotion to prove ; 
lie died for 
is country, he cared not for fame, 
And each sous of Erin rejoice at his name ; 
I 
mean not the bravo Dan O'Connell of old, 
I 
mean ti ,
:)t the brave Dan O'Connell the bold ; 
Nor IrelaAr: sweet poet, the warm-hearted Moore, 
But brave it ,bert Emmet was true to the core. 
And now let me sine of America's friend, 
Who cave up his life for liberty's end ; 
Hand in hand with our Washington, noble hero, 
lie fought ' neath our banner, the red, white and blue ; 
From his own sunny France, from Ids kindred and home, 
Across the broad ocean lie feared not to roam, 
Let the battle fields echo the old days of yore, 
That dear Lafayette he was true to the core. 
Another name dear to us all here to-night, 
Who loved his own comrades, who tried to do right ; 
When the fierce storms of war was overwhelming our land, 
To his c-untry he offered his heart and his hand ; 
Though some misconstrue him and others complain, 
They never can tarnish, his honor or fame, 
Yet the red battle fields on Virginia's shore, 
Prove that Abraham Lincoln was true to the core. 
Let me sing now of one whom the whole world adores, 
Whose name is revealed upon all foreign shores ; 
America's hero, Columbia's star, 
A 
statesman in peace. but a 
lion in war, 
From the red battle- fields of Lundy's Lane, 
Front Pcinceton, from Germantown arises again, 
The echo of voices to sing evermore, 
That Washington always was true to the core. 
THE IRISH EXILE'S LAMENT. 
FAREWELL, lovely Erin, thy hills and thy mountains, 
Are lost in the distance beyond the blue wave; 
O'er the wide waste of waters far from the I'm roaming, 
The land of my fathers, the land of the brave! 
That bright sun now setting beneath the horizon, 
how oft I 
have watched at my own cabin door; 
But now I 
am an exile forced from Ireland to wander, 
Farewell, lovely Erin, I 
shall ne'er see thee more. 
Farewell, 0 
farewell, the loved scenes of my childhood, 
The vale near the church where in youth I 
have strayed: 
Farewell, sacred spot where my Shelalt lies buried, 
Beneath the green sod where my parents are laid ; 
Forlorn I 
must wander this wide world o'er, 
And seek a 
new home on some far distant shore ; 
A sorrowful ranger in the land of the stranger, 
Farewell, lovely Erin, I 
shall ne'er see thee more. 
Farewell, 0 
farewell, to the land of the shamrock, 
My heart now is sad, thou art lost to my sight, 
The shadows of evening have hid thee CI 
'
rover, 
Shut out from my gaze by the curtain of night ; 
Peace be to thy green valleys, dear land of my fathers, 
My country, I 
love thee, thy hills I 
adore, 
But now I 
am bound for the land of the stranger, 
Farewell, loyely Erin, I 
shall tie'er see thee more.

SHE RUNNED AVAY TO GERMANY. 
ROLLICKING DOLLIE DAY. 
Written, composed and sung by EDDIE Nutwoon, American Dutch 
Comique. 
AIR.—" He's Second Mate in the White Star Line." 
YUST look upon dis poor Daitchtuan und I'm sure dot you'll 
agree, 
I'm der vorst object you ever saw, a 
bicture of misery, ( Symph.) 
Per causes of der reason to you I 
will explain, 
Katarina, mine vife, has runned avay und my heart is Oa 
mid 
pain. 
CHORUS. 
She runned avay to Germany across der sea avay from me, 
Mid a 
butcher dot sold blood pudding und dripe, liver wust, 
sassages und Bologna. 
Her farder vos a 
fat Dutchman und vork in a 
brewery, 
Undev'ry night to der house I'd go my Katarina to see, (Symph.) 
She looked so sweed und beautiful mid cross eyes und carrotty 
hair, 
But she took flight mid a 
butcher voile night und left me in 
despair. 
She runned avay, etc. 
I'm always clinking of Katarina, I 
don't cood sleep at night, 
My brain vos filled mid oxcitement mid I'd lose mine appetite, 
(Symph.) 
Yah, dot vos so since she vos gone, dot's no use I 
can't get stoud; 
Ouf Katarina don't come back I'll stuff my kickings oud. 
She runned avay, etc. 
a 
> 
I'M the gayest girl in town, 
That's what the people say, 
Because I 
laugh and sing 
To drive dull care away. 
Old ladies shake their heads, 
And on the sly they say 
" 
She'll come to no good end, 
For she is much too gay." 
Drive, hoop, fence, dance, , 
Use 'the bow, the spear, the lance. 
I'm the gayest girl in town, 
My home is o'er the way, 
The village people here 
AU call me fly- away. 
I'm always full of fun, 
Of wrong, no one can say, 
411. 
My heart is light and free, 
I'm rollicking Dollie Day. 
Drive, hoop, etc. 
Sometime alone I 
walk 
Upon the village green, 
To hear the people talk, 
And see what can be seen. 
And if perchance I 
meet 
Some cavalier so gay, 
It's sure to go the rounds, 
" 
He's sweet on Dollie Day." 
Drive, hoop, etc. 
Though rollicking Dollie P 
iv, 
I'm always just the Eare, 
I 
laugh and chat with all. 
To me they're just the same. 
Perhaps some nice young man, 
That's got a winning way, 
May ask to change my name 
From rollicking Dollie Day. 
Drivo. hoop, etc.

THE GOOD-BYE AT THT-2, DO_ OR 
_UNCLUDED.] 
But time and place have quite estranged 
Each early friend we knew; 
How few remain,--bow many changed 
Of those,—of those we deemed so true ; 
Those happy hours again to me 
But memory can restore, 
The liug'ring thought will ever be 
The " good-bye,"--the " good-bye" at the door ; 
The ling'ring thought will ever be 
The " good-bye,"—the " good-bye" at the door. 
MY BABY BOY. 
On softly sleep, my baby boy, 
Rocked by the mountain wind: 
Thou drearn'st not of a 
lover false, 
Nor of a 
world unkind. 
Oh! sweetly sleep, my baby boy, 
Thy mother guards thy rest: 
rflw fairy clasp, my little boy, 
Shall soothe her aching breast. 
Wake, wake and smile, my baby boy, 
My heavy heart to cheer : 
The winery blast howls on the hills, 
The leaf grows red and sear. 
Oh 
tell me, tell me, baby boy, 
how shall I 
bear the cry-, 
When hunger gnaws thy little heart, 
And death lights on thine eye? 
Oh I 
was it meet, my baby boy, 
That thou such weird should (lite? 
Sweet Heav'n forgive thy father false, 
His wrongs to thee and me,

MY BEAUTIFUL LOITISA. 
HOPE you'll sympatise mit me, I'm a 
miserable man, 
Und if you'll listen to my song, I'll tell you if I

Dere reason is I've lost my girl, from me she has departed, 
She runned avay mit a Dutch musician und left me proken-
hearted. 
CHORUS. 
My beautiful Louisa, her breath smelt like limburger cheese. 
She had a 
big mouth to eat sourkrout, rind came from Fader-
land ; 
But now she has departed, und left me proken-hearted, 
She ruuned avay wit a 
leader of dot leedle German band. 
My Louisa she vas beautiful, her nose vas large und flat, 
Besides she had but vone eye, und she used to quint mit dat; 
To a 
bier saloon I 
dook her von night, vich caused me all dig 
pain, 
For dot Dutch musician vinked at Louise, und she vinked back 
again. 
My beautiful Louisa, etc. 
Ven his band stopped playing music, by my gal he took a 
seat, 
She called out for swi lager bier, und said dat him she vould 
treat; 
I 
said dat dat's played cud, Louise, I'm a 
flat do you subbose 
Veit dat Dutchman dook a 
lager bier glass, und broke it on my 
nose. 
My beautiful Louisa, etc. 
I 
got me so excited, dat I 
knocked him off his feed, 
Of course de vaiters dook his part, and chucked me in de street ; 
Pat night she runned avay mit him, got mai•rid, doo, no doubt, 
If ever I 
cotched dot Dutch musician, I'll kick my own brains

BARNEY ALEEN. 
BARNEY ALEEN, l'm down by the gate, 
Don't you know I 
am waiting for you 7 
You told me you'd conic around about eight, 
And I 
know you'll be faithful and true. 
I'm longing to hear your fond voice once again, 
As you whispered to me sweet and low, 
Your footsteps I'm longing to hear in the lane, 
For the clock has struck eight long ago. 
CHORUS. 
Barney Aleen, say, what do you mean, 
I 
know you are faithful and true, 
It's long after eight and I'm down by the gate, 
I'm waiting, dear Barney, for you. 
You told me last night you had something to say, 
When you kissed me good-bye at the door; 
You said you were coming to meet me again, 
And see me the same as before ; 
I 
know you will ask me to be your fond wife, 
And the answer of course you can guess; 
For Barney, I 
love you far better than life, 
And I'll certainly say to you yes. 
Barney Aleen, say, etc. 
Barney Aleen, say, what do you mean, 
Do you ever intend coining at all ? 
I 
hope you've not wandered with some other maid, 
And gone to a 
party or ball. 
It's lonely I'm waiting still down by the gate, 
And my heart groweth sad with its fear, 
I 
am thinking, dear Barney, why you are 50 late, 
And your footsteps I'm longing to hear. 
Barney Aleen, say, etc.

BUGABOO. 
As Sung by JEP.1:17 BARRINGTON. 
Come all ye tender-hearted bovs, wherever you may he, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardsh,ps, my boys, 
that I went 
throuall,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys ; on board of the 
Bugaboo, 
*Repeat. 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal : 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never 
shall : 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plowth the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of ABan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of 11:chinond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fire I 
a 
royal salute of bricks at the cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We sailed three years when a storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark blue 
sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—he set 
fire to the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When the captain found what he had done, be loud for help did 
shout, 
lie called up through the chimney- top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out : 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to Lis post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hard through the middle of the turf, 
they couldn't sav3 the Bugaboo. 
*R, ,peat. 
When fifteen thousand miles fann land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it couldn't burn any-
more ; 
So the captain he gave orders to lower the boats and save the 
crew,* 
While 1,000 rods of turf and 30,0 .i0 men were smothered in the 
Bugaboo,

DARLING BESSIE OF THE LEA. 
By RzNity TUCKER. 
On ! I 
wander 'mid the roses in the golden summer time, 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime ; 
But far sweeter than the roses and the streamlet unto me, 
Is the sunlit face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea.

She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea. 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call, 
Oh ! most I 
love the twilight when the pearly dew-drops fall, 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly welcomes me, 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc. 
Oh ! the honey bee may linger where the buds and blossoms

The gentle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they a.11 will pass unheeded, for wherever she may be, 
My heart is full of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc.

BIG LONG JOHN. 
By LUKE SCHOOLCRAFT. 
BIG long John was a 
Chinaman, 
And he lived in the land of the free, 
He peddled cigarettes on the upperland, 
Way out in Milwaukee. 
He could cat more hash than a 
free lunch cadet, 
And he never was late to his meals, 
he wore a 
long tail from the top of his head, 
Which hung way down to his heels. 
CHORUS . 
Ching, citing, chum, chow thing a 
ring a 
rue, 
Long John was a 
Chinaman, 
He is a 
barber by birth and a 
butcher by trade, 
I 
tell you he oil from the can. 
He went to San Francisco, 
For a 
Chinee gal to see, 
Feeling tired, he laid down to rest 
Beneath the shade of a 
huckleberry tree, 
He feeling very warm soon fell asleep, 
And he laid his head oa a 
plank, 
Along came an Indian with a 
big tomahawk, 
And chopped off a 
piece of his scalp. 
Ching, thing, chum, etc 
Now when he awoke he felt so had, 
That he hollered with all his might, 
Put his hand to his head and it made him so sick 
That he died that very same night. 
He was found next day about 12 M. 
By the captain of a 
Ilona Kong crew ; 
He wrote to his sweetheart, Chum Chum Fee, 
That he died from the loss of his cue.

GAZE ON ME FROM WHERE YOU SIT. 
Song and Dance by TOMMY DAYTON. 
I'LL sing to you a 
little sons, 
But not about the girls, 
You must be tired hearing 
Of bright eyes and sunny curls; 
So Grecian bends and all that stuff, 
We'll lay upcn the shelf, 
For of all that you have had enough, 
So I'll sing about myself. 
CHOI: Us. 
So gaze on me and tell me how is this, (Symph.) 
I 
don't think that I 
shall make a 
miss, (
Syniph.) 
I 
think that with so much of style, 
I 
ought to make a 
hit; 
I'm sure that I 
can try, 
You can tell me by and bye, 
If you'll gaze on me from where you sit. 
I 
promenade the streets alone, 
I 
meet my friends by chance, 
And oftentimes I 
hear them say, 
There goes a 
song and dance; 
I'm known here as par excellence, 
In that peculiar line, 
And I 
think that you will all agree, 
I've got it down quite fine. 
So gaze on me, etc. 
LITTLE MARY ANN. 
In a 
quiet little village near the banks of a 
stream, 
Where poets love to wander and sweet music seems to dream, 
Where the ivy-covered spire points alofi to happier spheres, 
And bids both young and old prepare to meet declinirg, years, 
ln a 
green and shady lane, long ere I 
became a 
man, 
1. whisper'd vows to heaven and may little Mary Ann. 
CHORUS. 
My little Mar}' Ann, 
Sweet little Mary Ann, 
whisper'd vows to heaven and my little Mary Ann. 
-But as years passed slowly on I 
impatiently did wait 
To reach that joyous time which gives to manhood its estate, 
When I 
should plow and. mow and gaily sing the jocund song 
Of the husbandman who plods his way so merrily along. 
Then I 
did as duty bade me, and ever sought a 
plan 
To enable me some summer's morn to wed may Mary Ann. 
My little Mary Aim, &c. 
By industry I 
gained a 
little fortune of my own, 
For well I 
knew what I 
would reap, must first be duly sown ; 
I 
bought a 
pretty cottage and a 
garden in full store, 
Where roses twined with honeysuckle graced the rustic door 
Now my joy was near complete and to perfect make my plan. 
I 
hastened and I 
married may dear little Mary Ann. 
My little Mary Ann, eze. 
The squire of the village gave the blooming bride away, 
And often have we called on hi in to celebrate the day ; 
Upon her brow be placed a 
wreath of flowers choce ano rare, 
Full many a 
year that wreath we've kept and o'er them breathed 
a prayer. 
Each day our bliss increases since our wedding life began, 
And the village sung from mum to night is little Mary Ann. 
My little Mary Ann, eze.

POETRY AND Pa0E3a—LCONCLUDED.} 
Two youthful 114_,n.i .ts in fonl communion, 
Lovingly confess 
Their hope to find in closer union 
Perfect happiness; 
But when in wedlock they are bound, 
Perchance it my disclose 
That e 
urtship is all poetry 
But matrimony's prose. 
That courtship is all poetry 
But matrimony's prose. 
Still there are voices ever near us, 
Mother, sister, wife, 
In loving tones to charm and cheer us 
On through rugged life ; 
And thus we find that woman-kind, 
That gentler nature shows, 
Which proves the woman poetry, 
And stupid man the prose. 
Which proves the woman poetry, 
And stupid man the prose. 
By KEATS. 
YOUNG stranger! I've been a 
ranger 
In search of pleasure throughout every clinic ; 
Alas I 'tis not for me : bewitched I 
sure must be, 
To lose in grieving all my maiden prime. 
Come then Sorrow, sweetest Sorrow , 
Like an own babe I nurse thee on my breast : 
I 
thought to leave thee, and deceive thee, 
But now of all the world I love thee best. 
There is no one; no, no, not one, 
But thee to comfort a 
poor lonely maid; 
Thou art her mother and her brother, 
Her playmate and her wooer in the shade.

BOSTON FIRE . 
As sung with success by Miss ANNIE RATELLE. 
Ara.—" Pat Won't Go Home Till Morning." 
IT 
was only on the tenth of last November, 
That we heard the news we ever shall remember, 
That the fire- king had cast its burning embers 
O'er another fated city in our land. 
As the woeful tidings flashed alone, the wire, 
Of this other sad catastrophy so dire, 
That Boston, beauteous city, was on fire, 
And sinking ' neath the fiend's relentless hand. 
CII011US. 
Fire ! fire ! was heard the cry, 
In every breeze that passed us by, 
And all this world did heave a 
sigh of pity; 
Strong men in anguish prayed, 
Fervent prayers to Heaven to aid, 
Before the fire in ruins laid, 
Fair Boston, beauteous city. 
And all through the terrible commotion, 
The wind blew a 
gale from off the ocean, 
The brave firemen worked with all devotion, 
To laugh at their efforts yet it seemed ; 
And soared with fiery prayer still higher, 
O'er chimney top, steeple and church spire, 
Till all was one vast flame of fire, 
As the light around the horizon gleamed. , 
Fire ! fire ! was heard, etc. 
But who saved the city from a 
panic, 
Front the rule of a 
fire-king so tyrannic, 
But the brave hearted firemen and mechanic, 
The best and the noblest in the land ; 
Far brighter than the soldier's record of glory, 
Are the names of those who live in song or story. 
Who rebuild the city to its former glory, 
And bulld her up, if possible, more grand. 
cuonus. 
And soon will no trace remain. 
Of this vast sea of flame; 
Boston will rise again remember; 
Brave men will be found, 
Who will build a 
fairer town 
Like Chicago, from the ground, 
Before the next November.

THE RISE EMIGRANT. 
Words by LADY DEFFERIN. 
Music by DEMPOTria 
I'm sitting on the stile, Mary, 
'Where we sat side by side, 
On a 
bright May morning, long ago, 
When first you were nly bride ; 
The corn was springing fresh and green 
And the lark san ,r 
loud and high, 
And the red was on your lip, Mary, 
And the love light in your eye. 
The place is little changed, Mary, 
The day as bright as then ; 
The lark's loud song is in my ear, 
And the corn is green again; 
But I 
miss the soft clasp of your hand, 
And your breath warm on my cheek, 
And I 
still keep listening for the words 
You never more will speak. 
'Tis but a 
step down yonder lane, 
And the village church stands near— 
The church where we were wed, Mary--
I 
see the spire from here ; 
But the graveyard lies between, Mary, 
And my step might break your rest, 
For lye laid you, darling, down to sleep, 
With your baby on your breast. 
I'm very lonely now, Mary, 
For the poor make no new friends, 
But oh I 
they love the better far 
The few our father sends ; 
And you were all I 
had, Mary, 
My blessing and my pride 
There's nothing left to care for now 
Since my poor Mary died. 
I'm bidding you a 
long farewell. 
My Mary kind and true, 
But l'll not forget you, darling, 
In the laud I'm going to, 
They say there's bread and work for alit 
And the sun shines always there 
But I'll not forget old Irel,nd, 
Were it fifty times as fair.

The drunkard's a

robber of God, a

Ye poor, wretched creatures, come, give up your folly,

The drunkard works hard, and he gives his week's wages 
To furnish the landlord with every fine thing; 
Fine beds and fine carpets, and grand, splendid parlor, 
A 
watch in his pocket, and jewels and rugs, 
A 
sumptuous hying, and excellent clothing; 
His wife dressed in silks, her gold rings, hat and veil; 
Look round you, poor drunkard, examine your conduct, 
And, now, make a 
trial of Adam's good Ale. 
This Ale is so cheering, refreshing, and cleansing! 
It makes the whole world rich, healthy and gay; 
It watered bright Eden, and Adam enjoyed it, 
Before he transgressed or corrupted his way.

More free, meet, or plenteous for man's happy 
It's granted in showers, sent down by the Powers

BEAUTIFUL SNOW. 
THE following is an account of the origin and publication of 
these beautiful lines, pronounced by the London Spectator to be 
" 
the finest American poem ever written." and now going the 
rounds again, 
has been attributed to various authors, and 
among them Miss Dora Shaw. 
Miss Shaw is not the authoress. 
In the early part of the war, one dark Saturday morning in 
dead of winter, there died at the Commercial Hospital in Cin-
cinnati, a 
young woman, over whose head only two and twenty 
summers had passed. 
She had been once possessed of an envia-
ble share of beauty, and had been, as she herself says, " flat-
tered and sought for the charms of her face;" but alas ! upon 
her fair brow has long been written that terrible word—prosti-
tute! 
Once the pride of respectable parentage, her first wrong 
step was the small beginning of the " same old story over 
again," which has been the only life-history of thousands 
highly educated and accomplished in manners, she might have 
shone in the best of society. 
But the evil hour that proved her 
ruin was but the door from childhood, and having spent a 
young life in disgrace and shame, the poor friendless one died 
the melancholy death of a 
broken-hearted outcast. 
Among her personal effects was found in manuscript the 
g• Beautiful Snow," which was immediately carried to Enos B. 
Reed, a 
gentleman of culture and literary tastes, who was at the 
time Editor of the Xational Union. 
In the columns of that 
paper, on the morning of the day following the girl's death, the 
poem appeared in print for the first time. 
When the paper 
containing the poem came out on Sunday morning, the body of 
the poor victim had not yet received burial. 
The attention of 
Thomas Buchanan Read, one of the first of our American poets, 
was soon directed to 
the newly published lines, and was so 
(1)

taken with their stirring pathos that he immediately proceeded 
to the hospital, nom whence he followed the corpse to its final 
resting place. 
0, the snow, the beautlal snow ! 
Filling the sky and earth below ; 
Over the houe-tops, over the street, 
Over the, heads of the people you meet, 
Dancing, 
Skimming along. 
Beautiful snow ! it can do no wrong; 
Flying. to kiss a 
fair lady's cheek, 
Clinging to lips in a 
frolicsome freak, 
a:sant:eta snow from the heaven above, 
Pure as an angel, but fickle as love! 
0, the snow, the beautiful snow ! 
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go! 
Whirling about in their maddening fun, 
They play in their glee with every one. 
Chasing, 
Laughing, 
hurrying by, 
It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye ; 
And even the dogs, with a 
bark and a 
bound, 
Snap at the crystals that eddy around ; 
The town is alive and its heart in a 
glow 
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow! 
How the wild crowd goes swaying along, 
hailing each other with humor and song ! 
How the gay sledges, like nrs:eors, flash by, 
Bright for a 
moment„ thea lost to the eye— 
Ringing, 
Swinghlg, 
Dashing they go, 
Over the crust of the beautiful snow ; 
Snow so pure when it falls ft orn the sky, 
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by, 
(2) 
I 
BEAUTIFUL SNOW.—Concluded. 
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet, 
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street. 
Once I 
was pure as the snow—but I 
fell! 
Fell like the snow flakes, from heaven to hell: 
Fell to be trampled as filth in the street; 
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat • 
Pleadincr, 
Cursing, 
Dreading to die, 
Selling my soul to whoever will buy ; 
Dealing in shame for a 
morsel of bread, 
hating the living and fearing the dead ; 
Merciful God! have I 
fallen so low 
And yet I 
was once like the beautiful snow. 
Once I 
was fair as the beautiful snow, 
With an eye like its crystal, a 
heart like its glow ; 
Once I 
was loved for my innocent grace, 
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face! 
Father, 
Mother, 
Sisters, all, 
God and myself, I 
have lost by my fall ; 
And the veriest wretch that goes shivering by, 
Will make a 
wide swoop least, I 
wander too nigh; 
For of all that is on or about me I 
know 
There's nothing that's pure but the beautiful snow. 
How strange it should be that the beautifnl snow 
Should fall on a 
sinner with no where to go! 
How strange it should be, if ere night comes again, 
The snow and the ice strike my desperate brain; 
Fainting, 
FreezinDg,ying alone, 
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan 
To be heard in the crash of the crazy town, 
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down, 
I 
should lie and should die in my terrible woe, 
With a 
bed and a 
shroud of the beautiful snow.

TELE BARD OF ARMAGH. 
As sung by NED HARRIGAN. 
0 
list to the lay of a 
po')r Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his old withered hands, 
But, remember those fingers, they once could move sharper, 
In raising the merry strains to his dear native land, 
It was long before the shamrock, dear isle, lovely emblem, 
Was crushed in its beauty, by the Saxon's lion paw, 
And all the pretty colleens around me would gather 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Though four score and three years have flew by them, 
It's king's sweet reflection that every young joy, 
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of old men 
At a 
fair, or a 
wake I 
could twist my shillelah, 
And trip through a 
dance wid my brogues tied with straw, 
There all the pretty maidens around me would gather, 
Call me their bold Plielim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
In truth I 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home and a 
dweling for me, 
And oh, let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be cut from the land that is trod by the free ; 
And when serjeant death in his cold arms cloth embrace. 
And lull me to sleep with old Erin-go-bragh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my dear pride, oh place me, 
Then forget Maim Bra ly, the Bard of Armagh.

'• KEEP TO THE RIGHT ." 
Words by H ARRY LINN. 
Music by ROLAND H OWARD. 
One day while walking thro' the streets, amidst a 
busy throng, 
Studying and musing on a 
subject for my song, 
A board ' laird to a 
corner, it quickly caught my sight, 
And painted there I 
saw the warning, " Keep to the right," 
cuottes. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, shun whate'er is wrong, 
Then upon life's billows you'll go merrily along. 
Be honest in your dealings, morning, noon, and night, 
And let your watchword always be, boys, keep to the right. 
Keep a 
smiling countenance, never wear a 
frown, 
Do not try to raise yourself by pulling others down, 
Envy not your neighbor, ne'er indulge in spite. 
Malice brings unhappiness, so keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, & c. 
Be sober and industrious, ambitious to get on, 
For in life's unequal battle you must struggle hard and strong, 
In gossiping or meddling, never take delight, 
Always mind your own affairs. and keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, &c. 
Keep to the right then, how happy you will be, 
Your heart will be as light as air, your conscience pure and free, 
Behind the darkest cloud, the sun is always shining bright, 
Prosperity will crown you if you keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, & e.

I WISH MAMMA WAS HERE.

Street, Boston, Mass. 
Price 35 cents. 
Sung with immense applause by TONY rASTOR. 
A 
TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here!" 
CIIORUS. 
I 
wish mamma was here! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
A 
tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
lie pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
Be bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
Ana Willie murmured in his sleep, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here !" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," etc. 
Ills darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then, 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair, 
" 
Oh! live, my darling dear !" 
And Willie breathed his last fcnd sigh, 
"I know mamma is here !" 
"I wish mamma," etc. 
THE OLD HONE AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO B. 
Oh, the old home ain't. what it used to be, 
The banjo and the fiddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn ; 
Great changes has come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes him sad and forlorn, 
For no more we hear the dam Ides singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
No, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The change makes me sad and forlorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
In the field I've worked when I 
thought ' twas hard, 
But night bro't its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side. 
The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered now and o'er the world they roatn, 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No. the old home, & c. 
Now the old man would rather lived and died 
In the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom came to the colored man, 
He left his cotton-field and corn. 
This old man has lived out his three-score and ten, 
And he'll soon have to lay down and die, 
Yet he hopes to go into a 
better land, 
So now, old cabin home, good-bye. 
No, the old home. & c.

SWEET JENNY 
THAT PLAYED THE WELCH HARP. 
My name is Dan Dugan, 
Cookelorum, Cock Lane, 
I 
came from Llangotilin, 
A land far away ; 
With my head near turned, 
And my heart full of fear, 
To seek a 
Welch lassie, 
But can't find her here. 
Her name it is Jenny, 
So neat and so sharp, 
She came from North Wales, 
And she plays the Welch Harp. 
I 
courted sweet Jenny, 
Six months and three days, 
I 
sat by her side, 
And she paved the sweet lays, 
Till a 
man with a 
banjo 
Came strolling that way, 
He saw my sweet lassie, 
And bore her away. 
Her name it is Jenny, dkc. 
I'd told her I 
loved her, 
As true as time stars; 
I 
thought her a 
Venus, 
But she turned out a 
Mars; 
She scattered my hopes, 
With one single blow, 
She tingles her harp, 
To a 
nasty banjo. 
Her name it is Jenny. 
If ever I 
meet him, 
As sure as the dead. 
smash his old banjo, 
And the crown of his head. 
As for false Jenny, 
I'll leave her to die. 
For leaving Dan Largan, 
The wandering boy. 
Her name it is Jenny, dtc.

The one who holds my little heart 
Plays trombone in the band.

Marching with the band, born, born, 
Marching with the band, born, born, 
My soul's delight from morn till night. 
Is marching with the band, born, born. 
Marching with, etc 
As down Broadway they go, 
march close by the band, 
When my trombone sees me, 
He slyly waves his hand; 
You may have the cornet 
Or alto's sweetest tones, 
Take all the band but leave for TIV3 
My mellow brass trombone. 
Marching with, etc. 
Some girls love the soldiers 
As they march up the street, 
But when it comes to style, 
My trombone can't be beat; 
His moustache is so black, 
And it is all his own ; 
My longing heart goes pit- a- pat 
When I 
hear that trombone.

I

spree, 
And never shall I 
quite forget the looks she cast on me. 
She ask'd me, in a 
voice so sweet, " What I 
would take to drink ?" 
That I 
muttered, in a

" 
I 
will drink some bread and butter,

THE MAZE AT HAMPTON COURT .—[CoscLunED.] 
We had no fuss or bother, 
But, as we pleased each other, 
We thought we needn't put the happy day off very far. 
Cno.—Oh, dear 1 &e. 
Each Sunday afternoon I 
used to take her for a 
walk, 
And wondered at the easy wax in which she used to talk. 
It cost me five bob every time, to treat my future bride; 
For one of her great vices 
Was a 
love for penny ices, 
Which always give me toothache and a 
pain in my inside. 
Cno.—Oh, dear I & c. 
One day I 
took her to the Maze, and, when inside we got, 
She said, " Let's both go diff'rent ways," I 
thought we'd better not. 
Her way, however, she did get, she said it was for sport; 
So then and there we parted, 
And on diff'rent paths we started, 
To try and find the middle of the Maze at Hampton Court. 
Cuo.—Oh, dear! & c. 
I 
turned about both right and left, for half an hour or more; 
But the more I 
turned the further off I 
still seemed than before. 
At last I 
hit upon the path which led me the right way, 
And there I 
found my Sarah, 
And felt inclined to tear her 
Into pieces, for the trick she served me on that horrid day. 
Cno.—Oh, dear! & c. 
She was sitting on a 
young man's knee, and he was making love, 
While she was looking into his eyes just like a 
turtle dove. 
I 
felt inclined to knock him down, but thought I'd better not; 
So I 
rushed from out the maze, 
With my mind in quite a 
haze, 
Intending, when at home, at my brain I'd have a 
shot. 
Cno.—Oh, dear ! &e. 
But when at home at last I 
got, and thought about it all; 
1 
really didn't see why I 
should shoot myself at all. 
So from my mind my faithless Sal I 
in an instant threw, 
And sent her back her carte, 
And told her that my heart 
In future would have nothing more at all with her to do. 
Cno.-011, dear I 
cte. 
:
MORAL. 
Now, young men all, take my 
advice, when to Hampton Court you go, 
Don't fall in love with the barmaid fair, you'll rue it, if you do. 
For though she smiles and lo,)ks so sweet, you a 
lesson will Le 
And one thing more I'll say, [taught. 
Before I 
go away— 
Be sure you never leave her in the Maze at Hampton Court. 
Cuo.—Oh, dear 1 &c.

WHAT RIGHT HAS A MAN T i BE PO cR . 
Written by J. F. Poetic. 
Sang by BILLY W EST. 
I'm going to sing a new ditty : 
You will say there is truth in my rhyme. 
Where ever you go through the city— 
That poverty's counted a 
crime, 
A man may be worthy and honest, 
Yet his conduct we cannot endure 
For while Riches alone People worship, 
What right has a man to be poor. 
One day as I 
went out a- walking, 
Stop thief !" I 
heard somebody cry— 
Amongst the crowd that began to assemble 
Was a 
fop with a glass to his eye. 
At a 
poor workingman there he pointed, 
Saying that mill in you'd bet ter secure, 
That he is the thief I 
assure you 
He must be because he's so poor. 
'Pother day on a 
steamboat excursion, 
A young lady fell ovet-board 
A poor man jumped alter I save her, 
While her parents in agony roared. 
When safe in his arms he brought- her, 
Say's her father, I 
thank you, I'm sure ; 
But you'll please to leave go of iny daughter, 
To embrace her, young man, you're to poor. 
When war cast a 
cloud o'er our nation 
And liberty's call did resound ; 
How many kid gloved wearing gentry 
In tile ranks of our soldiers were found. 
The first 
to march oil was the toiler, 
Our Union awl rights to secure; 
When our Banner was saved from the spoiler 
The fighting men came from the poor. 
DON'T SELL MY FATHER RUM. 
A BEAUTIFUL TEMPERANCE BALLAD. 
DON'T sell him another drink, please, 
He's reeling already, you see, 
And I 
fear when he comes home to-night 
He'll beat poor mother and me ; 
She's waiting in darkness and cold, 
And dreading to hear him come; 
He treats us so bad when he's drunk, 
Oh! don't sell him any more rum! 
ClIORLTS. 
Don't sell him another drink, please, 
He's reeling already, you see, 
And I 
fear when he comes home to-night 
He'll beat poor mother and me. 
I 
heard mother praying last night, 
She thought I 
was quite sound asleep, 
She prayed God her husband to save, • 
His soul from temptation to keep ; 
She cried like her poor heart would break ; 
So, trying to comfort her some, 
I 
told her I'd beg you to day 
Not to sell father any more rum. 
Don't sell him another, etc. 
Why don't you have something to sell 
That will not make people so sad ; 
That will not make dear mothers grieve, 
And kind fathers cruel and bad 
Ah me ! it is hard ; I 
can see 
You're angry because I 
have come 
Forgive a 
poor, sad little girl, 
And don't sell her dear father rum !

My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away; 
They say that young love's like the flower. 
That needs tender care in its urn, 
But mine it was snatch'd from its bower, 
And I 
never galled one in return, 
CHORUS. 
My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
For it brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it. has all pass'd away. 
My sad heart recalls all the pleasure, 
Of thoughts that were all, all for thee, 
When dreaming of you of its treasure, 
And you seem'd to love none but me ; 
Tho' we meet not as friends, yet cl I 
never, 
One unkind word to thee give, 
For your cherished memory ever, 
Shall be my sole joy while I 
live.

We stroll 'd 
thro' the woods and some how lost our way, 
And our hearts, which are not found as yet. 
But I 
think I've found his, I 
know he has mine, 
Tho' parted now forever more; 
Yet still in my dreams I 
can see his eyes shine, 
And hear his rat-a- tat at the door. 
Oh, how my heart, ttc. 
He has not yet proposed, but 1 
think he will soon, 
My mirth I've to hide with a 
frown ; 
For I 
know the dear fellow has often began, 
And as oft in confusion bloke down. 
He has vowed to be mine, in fact we've both vowed 
Each other to love ever more; 
wh .‘res there a 
girl whose heart, beats not fast 
When she hears her love knock at the door. 
Oh, how my heart, Itte.

PARODY ON "PUT ME IN KY LITTLE BED?" 
Words by JEICEY COHEN. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
Oh, Birdie, I 
am exceedingly fatigued at this moment, 
I 
do not care tor an exhibition or your vocal abilities, 
All day you've displayed them to satisfactory advantage, 
So put your head beneath it's usual feathered protector. 
Fin sleepy too, the approach of slumber is apparent, 
And, Birdie, when my habi.: 
nal devotions have been dis-
posed ot 
I 
want to prostrate my person in the arms of Morpheus. 
So put we in that soothing harbor designated as my vir-
tuous couch. 
CHORUS. 
Come affectionate feminine relative approach, 
Kiss me with compliments of the hour. 
For I 
my evening- devotion have tittered, 
Fin infinitely fatigued and lain would seek repose. 
So put me in that resting place designated by the usual 
appellation of my little bed. 
Oh, Birdie, repeat the ejaculations of our maternal pro-. 
tector, 
AVhen she to the abode of eternal bliss N'as summoned 
She told me always to assume a 
disposition of amiability, 
And never, never stray from the paths of virtue and pru-
dence. 
nSer forget the day her spirit departed from its mortal 
casket, 
She placed her digits upon my devoted cranium, 
And whispered softly, retain my obedient offspring. 
And then I 
received information to the effect that she had 
shuffled off this mortal coil. 
Come affectionate, 86c.

IT'S FUNNY WTI-FIN YOU FEEL THAT WAY. 
As sung by Gus lifitmAms. 
I 
SHAN'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
CHORUS, 
IOW 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the ices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask him if I

NEWTON FOSTER.— One pe-
rusal of this will give a 
clearer idea 
of a 
seaman's existence than a 
voy-
age around the Horn. 
MIDSIII L'MAN E AS Y.—This 
writer never wrote a 
dull book, and 
this one is the least of all open to 
that fault. 
PETER SIMPLE.— This is one 
of the best sea stories in any lan-
guage. 
Thousands have laughed 
at the locker full of fun that the 
Captain opens for all. 
PACIIA OF MANY TALES. 
The many tales will be found equal 
to one another, and all excellent, 
and never tedious in length. 
'rim PIRATE AND TIIE 
it It EL CU 
1"r E R S — 
Frowning men, clambering aboard 
contested craft; shots exchanged; 
cutlasses clashimi—m short, fierce 
encounters fill thes: thrilling pages. 
E KING'S OWN.— Unal-
loyed enjoyment—the sea-breeze, 
the exciting espisodes, the novel 
scenes and persons, without the 
discomforts attending them. 
JAPHEF IN SEARCH OF 
A [' AllEIC.—There has risen 
not one worthy to wield Marryatt's 
pen. 
No reader regrets starting 
out with Japhet in his long search. 
SNALLLEVOW, THE DOG 
Fl EN 
D.--If laughing makes peo-
ple increase in bulk. 
Snarleyow" 
would have been found guilty of 
making DAniel Lamberts of the 
human race.

JACO 
IS FAITHFUL. — There 
has rarely been a 
man placed in a 
position so fitted for seeing the sail-
or's life as Captain Marryatt, and 
never one so able in portraying it. 
FRANK MILDMAY. — Per-
haps in no other work does Marry-
att better evince his talent than he 
does in " Frank Mildmay." None 
can beat the " Cap." 
PERCY/VAL KEENE. — A 
thorough knowledge of every wish, 
hope, and fear of a 
sailor, makes 
Marryatt the best nautical novelist 
that ever lived. 
PHANTOM SHIP.— Now, if 
anybody knows more about " Wiz-
ard Skiffs" and 
Flying Dutch-
men" than Marryatt, he can take 
our tarpaulin. 
ILA'FLIN, 'FITE REEFER.— 
The happiest days of our existence 
were when we were " laying off " 
in the foretop of old " Ironsides," 
reading this charming book to our 
all-delighted messmates. 
TINE voAcnErt. — Marryat t 
proves that be could write as well 
of " shore" life. 
The adventures 
of Joseph Rushbrook are at once 
very extraordinary and very affect-
ing. 
POOR JACK.—The history of 
this little sett-,ide waif is one of the 
most genuine narratives of a 
sailor-
bby's cinise that has ever been en-
tered in the log-book of life.
