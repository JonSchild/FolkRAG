[Salutation in Diné (Navajo)] 
 
Sherwin Bitsui:  My name is Sherwin Bitsui, and I’m of the Deer Springs Bitter Water People. I’m 
born for the Many Goats People. My maternal grandparents are the Towering House People, 
and my paternal grandparents are the Coyote Pass People. I’m originally from White Cone, 
Arizona, on the Navajo reservation.  
[Sherwin Bitsui reads “From Dissolve”] 
SB:  These fragments are taken from my book-length poem, “Dissolve,” published by Copper 
Canyon Press is 2018. The scenes and images take place in a dark post-world imaginary. In this 
sequence, the reservation is a ghost and the human characters are free-falling and making drip 
patterns on the “somewhere parts” before they dissolve into “somewhere mud.” The speaker’s 
understanding of “place” has been disrupted by invasive systems of thought and perspectives—
as a result that “place” is now the phantom-like “hovering smear,” trailing desert washes. 
Dissolve attempts to recreate the contrasts and endlessly ambiguous notions of how place 
manifests within Indigenous worldview and time, and also, hopefully, speak to its 
incompatibility with Western thought and language. These two systems merge to create a 
world attempting to restore itself even when change is inevitable.
