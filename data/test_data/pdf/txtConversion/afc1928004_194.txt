NOT SO EASY TO DO. 
As Sting by JOHNNY SMITH, COM IC 
-Vocalist. 
It's all very well for people to tell, the course they mean to pursue ; 
There are many things easy to talk about, but they're not so easy 
to do. 
I've heard mat y 
a 
speech that a 
mile would leach, 
But strange to relate, up to this very date, such people do nothing 
but talk. 
Words are but wind very often we find, and I 
think you'll agree it 
is true, 
There are many things easy to talk about, but they're not so easy 
to do. 
The tetotalers, they have been trying, they say, to rebus of hearty 
good cheer, 
And because they, you see, prefer water and tea, they would stop 
us from drink iug our beer. 
Despite their abuse, they'll find it no use, if they try to close up 
our pubs, 
We've as much right I 
think, to a 
smoke and a 
drink, as those who 
can stand the big clti• s. 
They may chatter for hours with 5 peech-making powers, and hold 
temperance ball meetings too, 
But they'll find it is easy to talk about, but it is not so easy to do. 
.r• 
I 
courted a 
girl, a 
charming young love, a 
beautiful creature di-
vine, 
But a 
rival I 
found, who was fast gaining ground, so I 
asked this 
fair girl to be mine; 
Being first in the field, I 
had no wish to yield, but she with my 
rival took flight. 
I 
called him a 
scamp, with my girl to decamp, so he sent me a 
chal.. 
lenae to fialit ; 
My friends said 
go in, you are certain to win," but he was about 
six feet two, 
And fighting is easy to talk about, but it's not so easy to do. 
I've now got a 
wife, and we never have strife, for we've tempers 
uncommonly niil,1; 
The one point on which we at all disagree, is because we're not 
blessed with a 
chili. 
I 
should really like one, say a 
nice little son, but my wite says a 
girl is the best ; 
And when I 
walk out, my friends are about, and they make this 
a 
subject for jest. 
While some I 
have read, have too many instead, for th • v're blessed 
with a 
dozen or two, 
Well, keeping thein's easy to talk about, but it's not so easy to do. 
There are natures so proud, that they talk very loud, as they to 
great power advance ; 
They mutter and say, we are going to decay, and at our possessions 
taey glance. 
When foe a 
they combine, ' tie time I 
opine, that we should look 
after ourselves, 
And ready will be, our sons of the sea, to secure any covetous elves, 
For area ' tis known, we have here held our own, although we've 
been threatened a 
few, 
But they know it's so easy to talk about, but it's not so easy to do-

For my name it is Captain Jinks of the Horse-Marines,

I 
always lived beyond my means, 
For to cut a

FOR EVER AND A DAY. 
AN ORIGINAL NEW MOTTO-SONG. 
As Sung by EDDIE NORWOOD. 
In life's spring time and glory, 
When all is fresh and DCW ; 
Men vow and promise rashly, 
What they will be and do. 
But promises like piecrust, 
I've beard the proverb say ; 
Are made but to be broken 
For ever and a 
day. 
Oh merry men, and maidens, 
Beware of what you say: 
Don't vow and promise lightly 
For ever and a 
day. 
"I'lllove Thy love for ever, 
(I've heard the lover say:) 
There's nought on earth can sever 
My heart from her away." 
But soon a 
rich old widow, 
Lured by her gold display ; 
He wed, and thought no more of 
For ever and a 
day. 
Oh, merry men, &c.. 
Some would-be warrior hero. 
Eager for tame, will cry: 
" 
Though all should fall around me, 
I'll fight on till I 
die !" 
But danger conquers courage, 
he'll vanish from the fray 
Preferring life to glory, 
Forever and a 
day. 
Oh, merry men, &c. 
" 
We swear eternal friendship," 
Cry revellers o'er their wine ; 
But jealousy makes foemen, 
Of them thro' love divine. 
Then friendship's ties are broken, 
They meet in hostile fray: 
And, if not slain, are sundered, 
For ever and a 
day. 
Oh, merry men, &c. 
The,' 
forms may be all beauty, 
And brows as fair as snow ; 
And voices like sweet music, 
And cheeks like roses glow: 
And tresses bright and golden, 
And eves of starlight ray ; 
They cannot last, remember, 
For ever and a 
day. 
Oh, merry men, &c.

LITTLE DAISY. 
As sung by JOHNNY NOLAN. 
There's a 
light-hearted maiden who lives in the vale, 
And they call her the modest little Daisy, 
When my day's work is done to see her I 
ne'er fail. 
'rho' her beauty it nearly drives me crazy. 
By day or night where e'er Igo her blue eyes on me beam, 
Laughing like the dancing moonlight gleaming on a 
running stream. 
CHORUS. 
Oh Darling Daisy, ' tis of thee I 
dream, 
With thy blue eyes beaming, brighter ne'er was seen. 
Oh Darling Daisy still of thee I 
dream, 
Laughing like the dancing moonlight gleaming on a 
running stream. 
When away from my work thro' the weary long day, 
Thro' the hours, oft, I 
feel sad and lonely, 
But when Daisy I 
see all my fears pass away, 
Tho' she whispers she loves me only. 
By day or night where e'er I 
go, her blue eyes on me beam. 
Laughing like 
the dancing moonlight gleaming on al 
running stream. 
CHORUS. 
Oh Darling Daisy, tis of thee I 
dream, 
With thy blue eyes beaming brighter ne'er was seen. 
Oh Darling Daisy still of thee I 
dream, 
Laughing like the dancing moonlight gleaming on a 
running stream. 
MABEL WYLDE. 
As sung by JOHNNY NOLA:st 
In our dreams we often hear, sweetest voices soft and clear, 
Gently whispering of the little one that died, 
Of our darling angel-child, happy little Mabel Wylde, 
Now at rest where no sorrows can betide, 
Angels guard, protect, and bless, cherish thee with 
tenderness, 
Till we meet at heaven's portals, Mabel Wylde, 
And we ever love to think, that we soon shall reach life's 
brink, 
And we're nearing thee, and heaven's angel-child. 
CHORUS. 
In our dreams we often hear, 
Sweetest voicses soft and clear. 
Gently whispering, gently whispering, 
Of the little one that died, 
Gently whispering of the little one that died. 
As we wander day by day, o'er life's weary fruitless way, 
Angels-voices seem to murmur in our ear, 
Do not think that she is dead, tho' she was by death's 
hand led, 
Happy is our darling little angel-child. 
When clouds and shadows fade, and the future seems 
arrayed, 
With a 
promise that when happy visions smile, 
rhat when life's sad dream is o'er on the great eternal shore, 
We will meet our little darling angel-child. 
CHORUS. 
In our dreams we often hear, 
Sweetest voices soft and clear, 
Gently whispering, gently whispering, 
Of the little one that died, 
Gently whispering of the little one that died.

DELEHANTY. 
In an ivy-covered cottage, 
Hidden back of oaken trees, 
Lives a 
lovely little maiden, 
Blythe and happy as you please. 
Where upon a 
low verandah, 
Every summer's eventide, 
I 
sit amid the flowers fair 
CamiIlia by my side. 
All among the roses, 
Making sweet proposes— 
Lovely, laughing, soul bewitching, 
Sweet Camillia May ; 
Captivating, aggravat i 
Never tired of play— 
Flitting like a 
little birdie, 
Happy, light and goy ; 
Kill me or 1'11 die with love 
For sweet, Cainillia May. 
There's a 
pretty white camelia, 
Ever glowing in her hair, 
Lovely violets and roses 
Blooming in her face so fair; 
Little stars and merry sunshine 
In her eye so bright and gay, 
And a 
choir of angels singing 
in the voice of Milly May.

- 
I 
am waiting here to meet my darling, 
And my heart is in a 
flutter of delight; 
For we kissed last night when we were parting, 
And this is where she bid me come to-night. 
When away from her 1 
am so lonely, 
I 
know not what to do; 
But her bright, sweet smile can ever cheer me, 
Tier heart is warm and true. 
Oh! 
When we kissed then I 
saw her pretty blushes, 
She turned her face away the blush to hide ; 
I 
was happy with my bunch of roses, 
My little bunch of roses by my side. 
There is something that I 
must not toll, 
And that is where this maid does dwell. 
In her hair she wears a 
white camelia, 
And darn blue is the color of her eyes; 
And I 
call her my little bunch of roses, 
My darling, charming, captivating prize. 
It was in those happy-days of childhod, 
When first I 
met this roguish little belle ; 
By a 
streamlet running through the wild wood, 
Though but a 
boy, in love with her I 
fell. 
She is now the pride of all the city, 
Of summers, sweet sixteen ; 
t,nd is called by all a 
perfect beauty, 
A fawielike, fairy queen. Oh! 
Now I 
meet her almost every evening, 
And I 
think it is the sweetest thin ,, in life; 
For to walk with the flower of my affection, 
Especially when she's soon to be my wife.

There is something, Stc. 
'Twas an evening when the moon was shining, 
The little stars were twinkling far above; 
Arm- in-arm we were walking in the garden, 
'Twas then and there we both revealed our love. 
So I 
asked her then if she would take me, 
For better or for worse ; 
When she smiled on me so very sweetly 
And answered, " Yes, of course; Oh !" 
I 
confess that I 
never was so happy, 
Nor do I 
think that ever I 
could be ; 
Till I've married my little bunch of ooses, 
With a 
little bunch of roses on in y 
knee,

At last I 
said, " if she wouldn't wed, 
By jingo! myself I'd kill."—Cho. 
I 
thought it was " right," and so I 
had 
The banns put up " on spec," 
And sent my love a " sweet silk dress," 
Her darling self to deck. 
Upon the wedding morn I 
called, 
My intended bride to find, 
Not dressed at all, and worst of all, 
She'd not made up her mind. 
Spoken—She said she thought— 
Cho.—At first she would, and then she wouldn't, 
And then, somehow, she thought she couldn't, 
And then she said, " I 
really shouldn't," 
And I 
was a 
naughty, naughty man. 
Well, after that, we married were, 
And we're pretty jolly at home; 
To one thing, though, my wife objects, 
That's when I 
wish to roam. 
She says that " home's the proper place 
For all good married men," 
If I 
trot out at night I 
have 
To be in bed by ten. 
Spoken—As for letting me have the latch-key— 
Cho.— Once she would, but now she wouldn't; 
I 
say " she could," she says " she couldn't," 
She says, " what's more, she's sure she shouldn't," 
And I'm a 
naughty, naughty man.

KILLARNEY. 
By Killarney's lakes and fells, Emerald Isles and winding bays, 
Mountain paths, and woodland dolls, mem'ry ever fondly strays, 
Bounteous nature loves all lands, beauty wanders ev'ry where, 
Footprints leaves on many strands, but her home is surely there! 
Angels fold their wings, and rest, in that Eden of the West, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, ever fair, Killarney. 
Inisfallen's ruiu'd shrine. may suggest a 
passing sigh, 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, such God's wonders floating by 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mueross you must pray, though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man there would fain prolong life's span, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, evur fair, Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye, with such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, verdure broiders or besprints, 
Virgin there the green grows, every morn Spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries daff the snows, smiling winter's frown away. 
Angel's often pausing there, doubt if Eden were more fair, 
Beauty's. home, Killarney, ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for Echo dwells, makes each sound a 
harmony 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, till it faints in ecstacy, 
With the charm ful tints below, seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, tiugo the cloud-wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, glancing back soft light divine, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, over fair Killarney.

BUT OF COURSE ITS. NO BUSINESS OF MINE. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Some people say I 
am curious, 
For they know that I 
never refuse, 
No matter from whence I 
obtain it, 
In getting the latest of news. 
I 
certainly own that I 
do so, 
And no harm there is I 
opine; 
But whatever I 
hear I 
keep close, 
For of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
see lots of chaps on Broadway. 
Who are dressed in very best style, 
With a 
diamond pin stuck in their bosoms, 
With kids and the shiniest tile. 
They measure out tape in some shop, 
And their salaries ain't very fine; 
Now I'd like to know how it is done, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, there's Jones, he's a 
temperance man, 
And he never will go near a 
bar, 
But his nose is as red as a 
berry, 
It shines like a 
lighthouse afar. 
He always drinks milk on a 
Sunday, 
And lie says that it's wholesome and fine; 
He's a 
friend of the late Deacon Smythe, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
know lots of married men, too, 
That are steady and sober at home; 
When they're out of the sight of their spouses, 
From paths which are narrow they roam. 
They drive about town in their coaches, 
And you oft see them kick up a 
shine; 
To the " Personals" daily they're writing, 
But of course it's no business of mine.

Behold in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by woe, 
I've lost my wife and cannot find her anywhere I 
go ; 
At first, she robbed me of my heart and now she's flown 
from me, 
4) And taken all my furniture, wherever can she be ? 
CHORUS. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so fair,— 
Perhaps she's up in a 
balloon, flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive, perhaps she's on the sea; 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd 
talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chap each day she used to 
walk ; 
She said he was a 
Mormon saint from far across the sea. 
I 
have not seen her for a 
week, wherever can she be ? 
Perhaps she's, cte. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she 
swore,

only hope her Mormon spouse has fifty wives or more ; 
I 
hope he'll thrash her every night \Olen he comes home

I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever they may be. 
Perhaps she's, Sce. 
I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling brats to keep, 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep ; 
I 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers never pay, 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day. 
Perhaps she's, &e. 
If she is in the railway train, 1 
hope that it will smash ; 
If up in a 
balloon, I 
hope she'll fall out with a 
crash ; 
If on the road to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may get 
drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and quickly I'll be bound.

LIMER ICK IS BEAUTIFUL. 
As 
sung by JOHNNY NOLA-N. 
0 ! 
Limerick is beautiful, as every body knows, 
The river Shannon, full of fish, besides that city flows, 
Tis not the river, nor the fish, that weighs upon my mind, 
Or with the town of Limerick have I 
any fault:to find. 
Oh the girl I 
love is beautiful, as fair-eyed as the fawn ; 
She lives in Garryowen and is called the Colleen Bawn. 
And proudly as that river flows, besides that blessed city, 
More prouder still, without a 
doubt, the Colleen goes by 
me. 
CHORUS .. 
Och hone, Och hone, 
Oh, then Limerick is beautiful as every body knows, 
Oh, Norah, you're my darling, Acushla Grammachree. 
Oh, if I 
was the Emperor of Russia to command 
Or Julius Caesar, or the Lord lieutenant of the land. 
I'd give my gold, my silver plate, likewise my army, 
The Horse-guards, the Rifles and the Royal Artillery, 
I'd give the crown from off my head, my people on their 
knees, 
I 
d 
give my fleet of sailing ships upon the briny seas, 
A beggar would go to bed, to rise at early dawn 
If by my side just as a 
bride, I'd find my Colleen Bawn, 
CHORUS. 
Och hone, Och hone, 
Oh, then Limerick is beautiful as every body knows, 
Oh, Norah, you're my darling. Acushla Grammachree. 
STAR OF BROADWAY. 
As sung by JOHNNY SMITH, Conde Vocalist. 
I 
am one of those glorious, jovial young bricks 
That don't care a 
jot, whate'er is my lot, 
I 
toss off a 
glass, though I 
am not a 
sot, 
Or a 
slave to that beverage quite. 
In society there appearance we keep, 
And don't indulge too much in wine, 
While at night, boys, we roam, while others do sleep, 
For in Broadway, this star it does shine. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am the star of Broadway, aha 
Of Broadway, alta! of Broadway, aha I 
For I 
am the star of Broadway, aha! 
And shine most at night, my dear boys, hurrah. 
1 
drive to the races in my four-in-hand, 
Like a 
lord in the land, I 
cut it grand, 
Right down the road, till I 
reach the grand stand, 
Where my place is already marked out, 
1 
draw my pencil, and pocket- book for sooth, 
And to make a 
short book I 
begin, 
With beats, my boys, I 
never book, 
But to stand against chance for to win. 
For I 
am, &c. 
My time, all I 
can. the ladies annoy, 
To their perfect joy I 
make them my toy. 
When naught else to do, sure for to find 
A 
little mischief to do, I 
declare. 
I 
crack a 
good joke, or smoke a 
cigar, 
Or at billiards for a 
five I 
will play, 
There are none can equal this Broadway star, 
So for me you must clear the way. 
For I 
am, Sze.

MY SUGAR PLUM. 
Words and Music by THOMAS M. 
HENGLER. 
I 
am over head and ears in love, 
The truth I 
tell, with a 
turtle dove ; 
She ought to be in the skies above, 
An angel she should be. 
Her laughing eyes, with a 
dimpled chin, 
Her thee so white and fair : 
Her looks so neat and so complete, 
With a 
mass of silk like-hair—oh 
CHORUS. 
Prettily she dances on her little toes, 
Looks as neat and sweet as a 
little tube rose ; 
Charms all the people as up the street she goes, 
She's my sugar plum. 
This luscious little sugar plum. 
Was introduced to the one you see. 
At a 
masked ball, where I 
had such fun, 
Everyone was in mu glee; 
This joyous night my heart felt light. 
With gleams of future bliss— 
When parting at the dawn of day, 
I 
was rapt in happiness—oh ! 
CHORUS. 
Prettily she dances on her little toes, 
Looks as neat and sweet as a 
little tube rose; 
Charms all the people as up the street she goes, 
She's my sugar plum. 
THE TAIL IV MY COAT. 
Ant—If You Travel the Wide World Over 
I 
lamed my reading an' writing, 
At Ballyragget, where I

'Twas there I

With the schoolmaster, Misther 0' Toole. 
He an' I

scrimmage, 
The divil a

wrote, 
But not a

Dare thread on the tail iv my coat. 
CHORUS.

I 
an illegant hand was at courting, 
For lessons I 
took in the art, 
Till Cupid, that blaggard, while sporting, 
An arrow drove cane to my heart. 
Judy Conner I 
lived straight forninst her, 
And tindher lines to her I 
wrote; 
Who dare say a 
word against her, 
Whoo 1 
I'd jump on the tail iv his coat. 
Sing whack, &c. 
A 
bog-trotter, one Mickey Maloney, 
He thought for to coax her away; 
He had money, and I 
hadn't any, 
So a 
challenge I 
sent him next day. 
Next morning we met at Killhcaly, 
The Shannon we crossed in a 
boat; 
Whoo ! I 
lathered him with my shelalah, 
For he trod on the tail iv my coat. 
Sing whack, & e., 
My fame spread about through the nation, 
Folks flocked for to gaze upon me, 
And they cried out without hesitation: 
" 
Och, yer a 
fightin' man, Mickey Magee." 
I 
fought with the Finnegan faction, 
I 
bate all the Murphies afloat; 
If you are in for a

Just thread on the tail iv my coat.

BILLY JOHNSON'S BALL.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
There were the Jones-es-es, and the Brown-es-es, 
And the Smith-es-es a 
score, 
The Spriggins-es, the Scoggins-es, 
And half a 
dozen more; 
In Billy's room, there wasn't room, 
To dance a 
decent jig, 
So he went and took a 
big one 
At " The Tinder-box and Pig." 
Spoken.—An efficient band was provided, consisting of a 
fiddle, 
a 
tin whistle, and a 
Jew's harp and they played—Ono. 
They introduced the baby, 
And we kissed it twice all round, 
Mrs. Johnson was quite "overcome," 
Fell fainting to the ground. 
But they " brought her to" with water, 
And " a 
drop of something in," 
And when " she felt herself again," 
The dancing did begin. CHO. 
In and out and round about, 
Such a 
ball was never seen, 
And every now and then, 
We'd " a 
drop to drink between," 
Billy Johnson he got dancing 
With all the girls he'd find, 
Mrs. Johnson she grew jealous, 
And declared he was " unkind." 
Spoken.—I 
make it a 
rule never to interfere in family quarrels' 
so I 
chose a 
lovely creature in red and yellow, and we glided into 
the 
Cuo. 
I 
drank " love" to the Jones-es, 
I 
drank " love" to the Browns, 
I 
tried to keep on dancing, but 
'Twas somehow " ups and downs," 
To tell you how it ended, 
I 
really am not able, 
For I 
found myself next morning 
Lying underneath the table. 
Spoken.—I 
felt rather confused till a 
friend reminded mo that 
I 
had been doing the—Clio.

I MAKE NO NOISE AT ALL. 
Song and dance. 
Written and composed by MR. CHAS. AfAavor, for the Original 
Published by W HITE, SMITH, and PERRY, Boston. 
Some people think that they must make a 
noise to get through life, 
While others are more sensible, avoiding every strife; 
The wise lay low and wait their chance, the foolish loudly bawl, 
So here's my subject when I 
dance, I 
make no noise at alL 
Dance—Then watch my motion to and fro, 
So silently about I 
go; 
You'll see the movement of my foot, you cannot hear it fall, 
For when I 
do my little dance, I 
make no noise at all. 
I 
think it very foolish to confide in every friend, 
And tell him all your business from beginning to the end; 
Yon c 
,n't trust everybody, if you do you'll surely fall. 
Be wise in speaking ot yoursolf, so make no noise at all. 
Now as I 
think I've said enough, then silently I'll go, 
And if I 
have made too much noise, of course you ought to know; 
I 
Lope to see you here again, you're welcome when you call, 
So recommend us to your friends, but make no noise at all. 
THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK. 
Sung by M ARIE DALTON M AC EVOY, and W. F. S. LAWLOR, in Cu. 
MACEvox"s Original Hibernicon. 
There's a 
sweet little spot, away down by Cape Clear, 
Sure, it's Ireland herself, to all Irishmen dear ; 
11"here the white prat ies blossom like illigant flowers, 
And the wild birds sing sweetly ab6ve the round towers; 
And the dear little Shamrock that none can withstand, 
Is the beautiful Emblem of Old Ireland. 
In his hat, good St. Patrick used always to wear, 
The Shamrock, whenever le went to a 
fair ; 
And Nebno-adnezzar, no doubt highly prized 
A bit of the blossom when he went disguised; 
For, the bosom of beauty itself might expand, 
When bedecked by the Shamrock of Old Ireland. 
When far, far away, a 
sweet blossom I've seen, 
I've dreamt of Shillelahs and Shamrocks so green; 
That grow, like two t 
wins, on the hop-s 
and the hills, 
With a 
drop in my eye, that with joy my heart fills ; 
And I've blessed Cie dear soil from a 
far distant strand, 
And the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland. 
APPLE OF MY EYE. 
Oh where, oh where, 
Can all the music be, 
Fulling on my ear, 
Floating in the air ? 
Or, are the angels 
Singing love to me, 
'Bout Miss Susie Dean, 
The apple of my eye. 
Oh Susie, my darling, 
I 
hope I 
never die; 
That you may live forever, 
The apple of my eye ; 
'Twas in the orchard, Susie darling, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
called you then my star and treasure, 
The apple of my eye. 
It fills my soul 
With joy and ecstacy; 
The memory is so sweet, 
Of when we first did meet 
The sweetest fruit, 
That ripens on a 
tree, 
With Susie can't compete, 
The apple of my eye. 
Oh, Susie, my darling, 
I 
hope I 
never die, 
That you may live forever, 
The apple of rev eye; 
'Twas in the orchard, Susie darling, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
called you then my star and treasure, 
The apple of my eye.

MY LOVE SHE IS A COOK. 
I 
wonder where my Susie is ? 
She said she would meet me here; 
Its been a 
half an hour or more, 
And still she don't appear. 
There's something must the matter be, 
Or she would not stay away ; 
have not seen her loving face, 
A week ago to day. 
CIIORSYs. 
0 my love she is a 
cook, 
She has such winning ways ; 
And a 
fascinating look. 
0 
yes, I 
love my Susie dear, 
Although she's but a 
cook; 
For she has such winning ways, 
And a 
fascinating look. 
0, Jimmy, you'll excuse me, 
For I 
could not come last night ; 
My sister's cat was very sick, 
And the dog had got the gripes. 
But don't forget to- morrow, 
About the hour of half-past two ; 
And I'll be in the kitchen, love, 
Awaiting there for you. 
CHORUS. 
My Susie she is handsome, 
She is upon my word ; 
She dances like a 
fairy, 
And sings just like a 
bird. 
My Susie says she loves me, 
And I 
know she loves me too; 
And if she would prove false to me, 
It would break my heart in two. 
PAT O'BRIEN. 
Pat O'Brien it is my name, I'll tell you, boys, from whence I 
came, 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy; 
No country is so dear to me as the little Isle stands near the 
sea, 
Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
Ould Ireland is the place where they're famed for fun and 
mirth, 
It's equal can't be found if you search all o'er the earth; 
Good natured boys and girls are there, with none of them you 
can compare. 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish boy.

Pat ('Brien is my name, I'll tell you boys, from where I 
came. 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy. 
Dan O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, he struggled hard for to 
defend, 
Gainst all invaders who di& intend to claim poor Paddy's land. 
He advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all his 
might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains, 
In high courts of justice he caused them all to stare, 
With his knowledge, wit, and humor, to hear him it was rare; 
He always proved poor Paddy's friend when to his trial he did 
attend, 
He caused the noblest back to bend to the honest Irishman. 
Pat O'Brien, dr,c. 
In eighteen forty-four gone by, our countrymen they had to fly, 
For famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wives and babies to 
wail; 
They were determined not to fail, but their hardships endure. 
The harp that once through Tara's Halls, shall strike each chord 
again, 
To welcome back those called from across the raging main, 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near 
the sea, 
— 
And all our toasts be, Ireland free I 
and you'll be happy then. 
Pat O'Brien, dlc.

I LOVE YOU. 
Sublime Rhyme and Chime.—By W M. II. 
DELELIANTY. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
When the silver moon was shining, 
And the little stars were twinkling, 
All in the month of June, 
I 
chanced to meet a 
beauty, 
So sylph- like, neat and pretty, 
With pouting lips like ruby— 
Bea ch tdoEtoms in full bloom, 
And as she cattle up nearer, 
Her sweet face full in view, 
IIIv heart spoke like a 
whisper, 
Fair maiden 
love you. 
CilouriS. 
Oh ? yes, yes, yes, she's all the world to me, 
No, no, no, there's none so fair as she, 
Her bright blue eyes betwiehi ng, 
had piereol rite thro' and thro', 
INIv heart still breathes Os whisper, 
Fair maiden I 
love you. 
Tho' strange it may be seeming, 
Her face is ever beaming, 
A starlight in my dreaming, 
A daisy dipped ill dew, 
Alt I 
could my arms perlieu her, 
I 
like a 
dove would coo her, 
And wed as well as woo her. 
This maiden fair and true; 
And all the wor1.1 might envy, 
And NViSll tile ill to do, 
But I 
would still be happy, 
Fair maiden, but with you. 
Oh! yes, yes, yes, &c. 
Ali here I 
have a 
letter, 
What could please ine better, 
Now, who can be the writer, 
That hand t 
never knew, 
It says, dear friend, excuse me, 
If Os a 
friend I 
Choose thee. 
To meet me, don't refuse me, 
Thk cow se I 
must pursue ; 
I 
can no longer tarry. 
Since first my eyes met you, 
Now, it you wish to marry. 
You'll find we good and true. 
Oh ! yes, yes, yes, 4Scc. 
GAMBLERS. 
Pete.—" I 
had a 
dream last night. 
Steve. — What did you dream ?" 
Pete.-1 
dream% we were both playing cards. 
Clubs 
were trumps; you begged, and I 
gave " you one," ( pre-
tends to strike hint.) 
Steve.—" Hold on, I 
never play cards!" 
Pete.—" Yes, you do; we all play cards." 
Steve.— • How do you make that out ? ' 
Pete.—" Our life is but a 
game of cards, 
Which each one has to learn ; 
Each shuffles, cuts and deals his cards, 
And each Ids trump (loth turn, 
Some turn a 
high card to the top, 
While others turn a 
low; 
Some hold a 
hand quite flush of trumps, 
When others none can show. 
When hearts are trumps 
1Ve play for love, and pleasure decks the hour; 
No thought of sorrow checks our joys, 
In friendship's rosy bower. 
For when the heart is on the top, 
We our cards at random play ; 
But when the heart is in the hand, 
Our life is but a 
holiday. 
When diamonds chance to crown the pack, 
'Tis then men stake their gold; 
Large sums are often lost and won, 
By gamblers, young and old. 
Each watches his neighbor, 
In chance to catch him cheat upon the sly ; 
It is then when men become the dupes of rogues, 
And rogues each other cheat. 
And he is indeed a 
wise man, 
Who never meets defeat. 
When clubs are trumps look out for war, 
On ocean and on land ; 
For horrid deeds are often done, 
When clubs are in the hand. 
The last game of all is when the spade 
Is turned by the hand of Time ; 
'Tis he that finishes up the game, 
In every land and clime. 
No matter how much each may win, 
Or how much each may save; 
You'll find the spades turn up at last, 
And digs the player's grave. 
Ana so you see, Steve, we all play cards."

SONG OF JOKES. 
As I 
walked Ulm' the town one pleasant night in spring, 
I 
stood 'neath the windows to hear the girls sing ; 
Oh where and oh where, has my highland laddie gone, 
IIe's gone, he's gone, as meek as any lamb, 
They took him, yes, they took him to the arms of Abraliani ; 
Away, away, away down south in Dixie, 
Where the troops are the finest I 
ever did see. 
And the captain with his whiskers, took a 
sly glance at 
Johnny Sehmoker, Johnny Schmoker, Scc., 
Oh I 
heard the drum beat and the music so sweet, 
But my eyes at the time caught a 
much better treat, 
For gay and happy, gay and happy, 
We'll be gay and happy still, 
Glory, glory, hallenjah, as we go marching on 
Oh Sallie come up, 
Sallie come down, Sallie come down to 
Maryland, my Maryland, Maryland, my Maryland, 
For hast thou no feeling to see me kneeling with 
No one to love, none to caress, 
Roaming along thro' this world's wilderness, 
Oh bow can I 
leave thee, how can I 
break apart, 
When sheepskin and beeswax make an awful plaster, 
The more you try to take it oft, 
A few days, a 
few days, 
What's the use of sighing, I'm going home, 
To the land of the free and home of the girl I 
left behind me, 
The girl I 
left behind me. 
WHEN THESE OLD CLOTHES WERE NEW 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Eight years ago, I 
looked a 
swell, sirs, 
With walking cane, and purse as long, 
I 
quizzed the ladies in the street, sirs, 
Alas, that game did not last long, 
I 
married got, to my misfortune, 
From that day every penny flew, 
For soon I 
spent the marriage portion, 
On my wedding-day these clothes were new 
We went to church, so blythe and merry, 
This hat of mine was new and light, 
We drank our crusted port and sherry, 
And ev'ry eye was beaming bright. 
13ut you, poor hat, can tell the hisery 
Of where we go, and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a 
mist'ry— 
Think of the days when you were new. 
And you, poor coat, have got quite seedy, 
I 
never cuffed you, speak the truth, 
You cannot say that I 
was greedy, 
I 
filled your pockets, yes, forsooth, 
For ev'ry morning you I 
studied, 
And after dinner open threw, 
And seldom were you skirts e'er muddied, 
1 
kept a 
coachwhen you were new. 
And you, poor boots, were bright as any, 
You really were a 
lovely pair. 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me ev'rywhere, 
Put farewell to the soles departed— 
For my poor toes they do peep through--
1.nd you, poor tops, look quite faint-hearted, 
flow different now, then you were new. 
And you, poor gloves, my bands did shelter, 
Yet still I 
held you in my love, 
We through the world wen', helter skelter, 
Like true friends, living hand and glove. 
But farewell, clothes, we part too soon. 
Then for a 
pauper's suit, grey or blue. 
I 
must die in the city prison, 
In clothes I 
hate though perhaps quite new. 
TtlY TRULY RURAL PRIZE. 
Written and Composed by Thous U. IIENGLER. 
In a 
scene of rural splendor, 
Where the murmuring waters flow ; 
Birds there sing together, 
Zephyrs whispering soft and low. 
There in a 
cot so cozy, 
A 
lovely flower cloth dwell; 
Spotless, fair as a 
lily, 
in love's dream there I 
fell. 
CHORUS. 
Her lips are like the roses, 
Kissed by the morning dew; 
She is my rustic beauty, 
To her I'll e'er be true. 
"2 was there I 
first beheld 
This lovely face and form ; 
Which made me feel the dart 
Of Cupid's magic charms. 
She sat within a 
bower, 
Where birds did harmonize; 
Perfumed by every flower, 
Was this truly rural prize. 
Pm as joyful as the birds, 
That warble in the trees; 
As they hop, and jump, and chirrup 
And fly where'er they please. 
The happiest thing to me, 
Is to know I 
ruralize, 
With a 
charming little maiden, 
My truly rural prize. 
Her lips, &c.

HAPPY LITTLE FLIP FLAPS. 
Words and Music by T. M . 
HENGLER. 
In the old plantation, years ago, 
'Fore dis cruel war begun, 
We hoed de cotton all day long, 
Each happy black and tan. 
And when de dinner horn did toot, 
We made de hoe cake sick, 
Old massa laugh and missis shout, 
At Dinah, Jim and Dick. 
CHORUS. 
We 
are happy little flip flaps, 
Joyfully we dance along, 
All we want is nice, sweet slap jacks, 
Den you'll hear us sing dis song. [Dance. 
'Twas in bright, sunny Florida, 
Where sweet Dersimmons grow, 
It's there we love to live and die, 
Dancing on our heel and toe. 
Now we're free and massa's gone 
To the golden streets on high, 
We hear him sing and laugh away, 
While we sing and dance shoo-fly. 
CHORUS. 
We are happy little flip flaps, 
joyfully we dance along, 
All we want is nice, sweet slap jacks, 
Den you'll hear us sing dis song. 
Written by W .

DELEHANTY. 
We are happy Hottentots, 
Happy, happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got our name; 
We used to gather Buchu leaves, 
Buchu, Buchu, gather Buchu leaves, 
And when Massa Hembold came, 
He paid us for the same. 
CHORUS. 
This is what we used to do, 
Picking up the Buchu ; 
We are happy Hottentots, 
Happy, happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got our name. 
Every night when work is done, 
Day time, night time, always full of fun, 
In our cozy little cots, 
Us happy Hottentots, 
Sing and dance most all the day, 
Singing, dancing, pass the time away, 
All our troubles come and go, 
We send them down below. 
CHORUS. 
This is what we used to do, 
Picking up the Buchu, 
We are happy Hottentots, 
Happy. happy, happy Hottentots,

IF I HAD A DONKEY WOT WOULDN'T GO. 
Ant :—" White Cockade." 
If I 
had a 
donkey what wouldn't go, 
D'ye think Pa wallop him? no, no, no; 
By gentle means, I'd try d'ye see, 
Because I 
hates all cruelty ; 
If all lnul been like me in fact, 
There'd ha' been no occasion for Bergh. 
Dumb animals to prevent getting crackt on the head. 
CHORUS. 
For H I 
had a 
donkey wot wouldn't go, 
I 
never would wallop him, no, no, no, 
rd give him some hay, and cry, " Gee Nvo," and 4‘ 
come up, 
Neddy.” 
What makes me mention this, this morn, 
I 
seed that cruel chap, Bill Burn, 
Whilst he was out a 
crying greens, 
his donkey wallop with all his means; 
He hit hitn o'er the head and thighs 
He brought the tears up in his eyes— 
At last my blood began to rise, and I 
said— 
If I 
had a 
donkey, &c. 
Bill turn'd and said to me, " Then, perhaps, 
You're one of these Mister Bergh's chaps, 
Wot now is seeking for occasion 
All for to lie an information.

IF I HAD A DONKEY. &c.--ICONCLUDED. 
Though this I 
stoutly did deny, 
Bill up and gave me a 
blow in the eye, 
And I 
replied as I 
let fly at his head. 
If I 
had a 
donkey, tic. 
As Bill and I 
did break the peace, 
f0 us came up the new police, 
And hiked us off; as sure as fate, 
Afore the sitting magistrate. 
I 
told his worship all the spree, 
And to prove the veracity, 
I 
wished he would the animal see; for I 
said— 
if I 
had a 
donkey, cte, 
Bill's donkey was ordered into court, 
In which it caused a 
deal of sport ; 
He coded his ears and ope'd his jaws, 
As if he wished to plead his cause. 
I 
proved I'd been uncommonly kind, 
The ass got a 
verdict—Bill got fined ; 
For his worship and I 
were of one mind; for he said— 
If I 
had a 
donkey, Sze. 
Bill said, " Your worship, its very hard, 
But ' tisn't the fine that I 
regard, 
But times have come to a 
pretty pass 
When you mush% beat a 
stubborn ass." 
His worship said nothing, but shut his book, 
So Billy off his donkey took, 
The same time giving me such a 
look; for I 
said—Bill 
It I 
had a 
donkey, & c.

Darling little Gertie,

Blooming in our bower.

MARY ANN; OR, THE BUTCHER BOY IN 
ERROR. 
AIR :—" John Brown." 
Words by H. J. WIITMARIC. 
Doubtless you've heard the song about that poor young 
man, 
Who had been jilted by a 
girl named Mary Ann, 
Prove that it is untrue, I 
very quickly can, 
It you'll attend to me. 
1 
CHORUS. 
I, as a 
beau, did ne'er receive him, 
Therefore, how could I 
deceive him? 
'Tis a 
falsehood, don't believe him, 
If he says so again. 
Oft to the tup'ny hops, ' tis true we'd nightly go, 
But not a 
single step of dancing did he know, 
Each time he tried, he always trod upon my toe, 
A clumsy chap was he. 
I, as a 
beau, &c. 
One night he call'd for me, and took me to the play, 
But when we got there, for the two I 
had to pay, 
" 
I've left my purse at home, my charmer," he did say, 
Oh I 
what a 
stingy man. 
I, as a 
beau, &c. 
If to his slop I 
went to buy a 
pound of steak, 
While he was weighing it the scales he'd slyly shake, 
Say "one ounce over," then would twopence extra take. 
Oh ! what an unfair man. 
I, as a 
beau, &e. 
Tho' lie may speak about his rival's head of hair, 
His is a 
mop to it and can't with it compare, 
'Tis nought but jealousy that prompts him, I 
declare, 
The green-eyed, greasy man 
I, as a 
beau, Sze. 
It's very well for him to say revenge is sweet, 
That's more than he can say about his joints of meat, 
He's not a 
bit got in his shop, that's fit to eat. 
For touch it no one can. 
I. as a 
beau, Sze. 
DANCING ON THE BRAIN. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Of all the figs you ever see for dancing or for singing, 
Such a 
nig as me you never see to set the boards a-ring-
ing; 
I 
go to balls and parties too, in moonlight snow or rain, 
I've got so fond of dancing that I've got dancing on the 
brain. 
CHORUS. 
You twist your heel and shake your toe, 
Now this is how you do it, (
Music.) 
Everybody's getting it and none seem to complain, 
I 
reckon it's mighty pleasant to have dancing on the In am. 
There was a 
ball the other night, I 
got an invitation, 
I 
went and got my purtty's on with the greatest exulta-
tion; 
I 
was not dancing long, when I 
found it mighty plain 
That all the gals was after me for dancing on the brain. 
You twist your, Scc. 
Such a 
happy nig I 
do declare was never yet created, 
To dance and sing is my delight, and yet I'm celebrated ; 
And how I 
got this dancing fit I 
never can explain, 
But I'll carve my way to glory, oh, with dancing on the 
brain. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Lovely as a, Rose." 
I'm going to sing a 
song, I 
hope it will please you all, 
It is all about a 
colored family seen at a 
fancy ball ; 
There was Nancy Fat and Susie Brown and Annie Maria 
Jane. 
Ham Fat man, Saucy Stun had dancing on the brain. 
CHORUS. 
For we will shortly please you, (Music.) 
The Ham Fat man \ 
\
ill grease you, (Music) 
They are handsome as a 
rose, their eyes as black as coal, 
And as they gazed upon us, my coat away they stole. 
(Dance.) 
I 
will describe them mokes as I 
met them at the dance, 
The Ham Fat man and Saucy Sam I 
think they came from 
France; 
But Nancy Fat and Susie Brown and Annie Marie Jane, 
The Ham Fat man he's smothered to death with dancing 
on the brain. 
For we, ttc. 
When the ball was out they all came down the street, 
And for a 
lager beer saloon to lager for to treat ; 
The Ham Fat man and Susie Browit they both got in a 
How Susie Brown did get out, I 
cannot tell you now.

IPECACUANEA, 
OR THE DOCTOR'S DAUGH, 
TER. 
W ords by W . 
THORNTON. 
Music by A RTHUR L LOYD. 
" 
Throw physic to the dogs," some say, 
But that I 
never did, 
For I 
beneath the nauseous dose— 
Found some sweet sugar hid, 
Then for my wife I 
tried to gain 
A doctor's daughter Mir ; 
And sudden illness used to feign, 
My way just to prepare. 
Spoken.—Now I 
never could get over that girl's name, 
for her eccentric father, instead of having her christen'd 
by any of the names peculiar to the fair sex, insisted on 
calling her after one of the bottles in his surgery. I 
always forgeE the name, but it's something like— 
CHORUS. 
Ip-e-cac-u, Ip-e-cac-u, 
Ipecacuanlia, 
Ip-e cac, I1)-e-cac, Ip-e-cac, 
Ipecacuanlia. 
Now in her father's Surgery, 
This girl would work away, 
A female doctor, as I've heard, 
She hoped to be some day. 
To valk the hospitals resolved, 
Like " Mary Walker" she— 
Made out. his bills, mixed up his pills, 
And nicely physic'd me. 
(With her)—Ip-e-cac-u, &c. 
Next, down upon my knees I 
went, 
To her my love contess'd; 
And of my passion long concealed, 
I 
soon made a 
clean breast,

IPECACUANHA, & C— C ONCLUDED. 
Said I, sweet girl, my malady. 
Much pain makes me endure; 
My heart's affected, and for me 
There only is one cure. 
Spoken.—And that, sweet maiden, is no ordinary remedy 
—neither Cockle's Pills, nor Battle's Vermin-killer, Glen-
field Patent Starch, or Barber's Poison'd Wheat ; the only 
thing, sweet maiden, calculated to alleviate my sufferings, 
Ip-e-cac-u, &c. 
Said she, my answer's No, 
For I'm to marry not inclined ; 
My mission, sir, don't think me cruel, 
Is to dissect mankind. 
I 
rusli'd away,— that very clay 
They took me home to bed ; 
And as I 
madly tore my hair, 
The brutes, they shaved my head. 
Spoken.—Yes, they took off all my hair, all my curly 
locks gone at one fell swoop ; I must have been mad to 
let them shave me in that way. They say that when I 
was delirious I 
thought I 
was a 
cane-boltonfd chair, and 
trembled lest anyone would sit down on me ; then I 
thought I 
was an omnibus, 2d. all the way, and never was 
happy till I 
heard the conductor cry out that I 
was full 
inside, and every day at a 
certain hour I 
used to try and 
Sing— 
Ip-e-cac-u, •!tc. 
Since then she's risen in the world, 
And taken her degree ; 
And in America has gained 
The title of M.D. 
The other day she sent me word— 
If ill—I 
might rely— 
On her, for drugs at wholesale price, 
And a 
liberal supply—

THE DOCTOR SAYS.—[CoNcLunEn.] 
What I 
eat or I 
drink I 
don't trouble to think, 
I 
never care much what it is; 
If it's water, or porter, or sherry, or beer, 
Or a 
draught from a 
bottle of fizz; 
Red herring or lamb—roast turkey or jam— 
A 
rabbit's not bad when it's curried— 
I 
can do with pot-luck, if it chance to be duck— 
If there's nothing—I 
never am worried.— Cho. 
When my wedding-clay came I 
went boldly to claim 
The fair damsel who'd plighted her troth ; 
But found two ladies dressed to be married, I'm blest 
If I 
hadn't proposed to them both; 
I 
said, " Some one decide" now which one is the bride, 
Let no further delay be incur-red, 
I'm a 
marrying man, I'll have which one I 
can, 
But I 
certainly mustn't be worried.— Cho. 
Oh dear! what a 
fuss people made about us, 
When we christened our first little girl, 
I 
thought 'twas a 
him, so I 
gave the name Jem, 
For my bead seemed to be in a 
whirl; 
I 
got much abuse from my wife, 'twas no use, 
I 
said, " Darling, now don't you get flurried, 
Say it's short for Jemima, you stupid young goose, 
And remember I'm not to be worried— Cho. 
My doctor came to me, a 
fortnight ago, 
Requesting I'd pay him some cash; 
But I 
said, " Dr. Squill, I 
shall not pay your bill, 
For your conduct's unfeeling and rash; 
I 
shall lose confidence in your excellent sense, 
If again this request is prefer-red, 
And I 
tell you again that you, sir, of all men, 
Should have known that I'm not to be worried.— Cho. 
I 
begin to think I 
must now bid you good-bye, 
You may like or may dislike my song, 
But I 
don't care a 
rap, you are caught in a 
trap, 
And you cannot make out I 
am wrong; 
For should you encore, I'm flattered I'm sure, 
Though, of course, I 
don't mean to be hurried ; 
If I 
get no applause, I 
shall say it's because 
You're aware that I'm not to be worried.—eko.

MISS MOLLY O'RIGGE. 
At Cork lived Miss Molly O'Rigge, 
With a 
nose like the snout of a 
pig; 
Long carrots- locks, 
And ten pounds in the stocks, 
Was the fortune of Molly 0 
Rigge. 
What a 
beautiful Molly O'Rigge. 
Tom Treacle loved Molly 0 
Rigge, 
A pert little tea-dealing prig! 
Says he," Molly, my dove, 
My heart's brimful of love." 
Says she, " Grocer, I 
don't care a 
fig." 
What a 
hard-hearted Molly O'Rigge. 
" 
I 
hate men," quoth Molly O'Rigge, 
c' In love they're a 
mere whirligig; 
But Cornelius O'Whack 
Gave her heart such a 
smack, 
That to church both cappered a 
jig. 
What a 
hearty Molly O'Rigge. 
Says the tea-dealer, " Molly O'Rigge, 
My heart is with jealousy big." 
Says she, 
Hold your clack, 
I'm now Mrs. O'Whack, 
I'm no longer Molly O'Rigge." 
Good-bye, Mrs. Molly O'Rigge.

"TAKE IT BOB." 
Written and Composed by A RTHUR LLOYD. 
I'm a 
jolly old m 
ller, Bob Bell is'iny name, 
And in my own village I'm well known to fame, 
I've a 
wife and a 
daughter, a 
dear little lass. 
I'm fond of them both, and I'm fond of a 
glass. 
Some say, I'm too fond, well, perhaps that may be, 
I 
try to be steady, and am, as you see, 
But if I 
attempt to refuse drink a-day, 
I 
fancy the wheel of the mill seems to say— 
CHORES. 
Take it Bob, take it Bob. take it Bob, take it Bob, 
That's what I 
fancy the mill says to me; 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, it's better than tea. 
I've tried very oft a 
tee-tot'ler to be, 
But my mill is quite right, brandy's better than tea, 
And altho' what I 
say, you may all think absurd, 
I 
believe what the mill says is right, 'pen my word. 
I 
called on old Jones ' bout some business, you know, 
And be said, Bob, a 
pipe and a 
glass, ' fore ye go, 
Now I 
didn't require it, believe what I 
say, 
But altho' a 
mile off, I 
could hear the mill say— 
Take it Bob, &e. 
Now I 
dreamt Vother night that Bob Bell was no more, 
That he'd died at the age of p'rhaps forty or more, 
And I 
heard people round me say, drink's done its worst, 
-But altho' I 
was dead, I 
was dying with thirst. 
A bottle of brandy close by I 
could see, 
It was meant for the mourners, it wasn't for me, 
But as on mv bed, still and silent I 
lay, 
In the distance distinctly I 
heard the mill say— 
Take it Bob, &c. 
I'm only up here for a 
bit of a 
spree, 
Mv wife thinks it's business bet ween you and me, 
And you know the old saying, that never deceives, 
What the heart doesn't see, why the eye doesn't grieve. 
I 
must toddle at once, so good bye to ye all, 
Next season I 
hope I 
shall give ye a 
call, 
Don't ask me to drink when I'm going away, 
Or I'm certain to fancy I 
hear hear the mill say— 
Take it Bob, &a

PADDY IN LONDON. 
From great Londonderry to London so merry, 
My own natty self in a 
waggon did ride; 
In London so frisky, folks ride in a 
whiskey : 
In Ireland we carry the whisky inside. 
I 
jumped from the waggon, and saw a " Green Dragon ;" 
1 
spied a -blue Boar" when I 
looked to the south ; 
At the "Swan with two Throttles" I 
tippled the bot ties 
And bothered the beef at the " Bull and the Mouth." 
Arrah, Paddy, my hunny, look after your money ; 
'Tis all botheration from bottom to top ; 
Sing-diddheroo daisy, my jewel be aisy, 
This Louden is surely the devil's own shop I 
The great city wax-work was all a 
mere tax-work. 
A plan to bamboozle me out of my pelt ; 
Says I, -Mistress Salmon, pray none of your gammon, 
Your figures are no more alive than yourselves." 
I 
asked a 
tall quaker the way to Long Acre ; 
With his thees and his thous he so bothered my hrain, 
After fifty long sallies through lanes and lot.g alleys, 
I 
found myself strollinz in Petticoat lane. 
Arrah, Paddy, my honey, Ltc. 
A 
t 
night, oh ! how silly, along Piccadilly, 
wandered when up came a 
beautiful dame; 
"Huzza!" says the lady, "Arndt, how d'ye do, Paddy," 
Says I, "Pretty well, ma'am, I 
hope your the same ;" 
When a 
big skulking fellow who held her umbrella, 
lie gave me a 
mighty neat thump on the nob ; 
She ran away squalling, I - Watch, watch !" was bawling, 
But the devil a 
watch there was left in ihe fob. 
Arndt, Paddy, my honey, cte.

DIULROONEY'S MY NAME. 
Mulrooney's my name, I'm a 
comical boy, 
A tight little lad at shillelah ! 
St. Paddy wid whisky he suckled me, joy, 
Among the sweet bogs of Killalah. 
The world I 
began with a 
prospect so fair, 
My dad was worth nothing, and I 
was his heir ; 
So all my estate was a 
heart full of care, 
And a 
tight little twig of shillalah. 
Turn captain, cried dad, and if kilt in the strife,— 
Success and long life to shillelah ; 
Your fortune is made all the rest of your life, 
As sure as there's bogs in Killelah, 
But, thinks I, spite of what fame and glory bequeath, 
how conceited I'd look in a 
fine laurel wreath, 
Wid my head in my mouth, to stand picking my teeth 
Wid a 
tight little twig of shillelah. 
Yet firmly both Ireland and England 
aid, 
The land of oak stick and shillelah ; 
For now these two sisters are man and wife made, 
As sure as there's bogs in Killalah. 
I'll still for their friends have a 
heart warm and true ; 
To their foes give my ham], for what else can I 
do ; 
give 'em my hand—but along wid it too, 
A tight little twig of shillelah. 
MY JUDY'S BLACK EYES. 
To be SUM I 
can't sing an oration,l i 
To show how I'm greatly allied, 
But a 
pair of black eyes, botheration,1 
Has bother'd my family pride. 
My mother ne'er did as they bid her, 
Such rank did her lineage adorn, 
And she took just nine months to consider 
Before she would let me be born. 
CHORUS. 
Yet l'm a 
kin to the Callaghans, Brallaghans 
The Dowlans, and Nowlans, likewise; 
What's birth to the lustre of beauty, 
That peeps from my Judy's black eyes ? 
My father sold mouse-traps and rabbits, 
Pigs, treacle, and all other game, 
Would you know the sweet town he inhabits. 
'Es jolly Dungarvon by name. 
My grandfather married a 
quaker, 
My uncle made hay with a 
fork, 
My brother's a 
great grand brogue-maker, 
In that beautiful city call'd Cork. 
Yet I'm a kin, &c. 
At Chapel I 
first saw my darling, 
I'll ever remember that day; 
She sung like a 
peacock or starling, 
Which made me unto her to say—. 
44 I'm related to all the Macarteys, 
All meniality I 
do disdain, 
[1.1 
DIY JUDY'S BLACK EYES. [CONCLUDED.] 
If you miss such a 
husband, so hearty, 
, 
You never will get him again.' 
For I'm a 
kin, &c. 
These words being moving and tender 
Which 110 female woman could stand. 
I 
determined a 
letter to send her, 
So I 
took up my pen in my hand ; 
But just on the point of inditing, 
By the powers it was rather too bad 
I 
forgot that I 
hadn't learnt writing, 
And she couldn't read if I 
had. 
Yet I'm a 
kin, ctc. 
Oh Judy, arrah I 
your my honey, 
Your coldness sets me in a 
flame, 
I'll marry you if you have any money, 
In spite of my family name. 
Myself I 
was reared very tender, 
A gentleman born, too, and bred, 
And my sister now lives in great splendour, 
With one Justice Mooney that's dead. 
Yet I'm a kin, &c. 
So now without any bother, 
My mind on the thing being bent, 
I'll marry herself and no other, 
And afterwards ask her consent. 
Politeness an Irishman's trade is, 
So on that blessed day that we're wed, 
I'll hand cakes and tea to the ladies,' 
And dance till we're all put to bed. 
Then I'll visit the, &c.

She thought that I

But I 
squeezed her waist and kiss'd her lips— 
Och sure!" cried Molly Doolan.

Said she, " You can't support a

You know yez cannot, Barney," 
But soon T

THE GREAT EVENT. 
Written by J. WILSON. 
Music by C. U. R. 
MARMOT. 
My mother expected me long before 
The day that I 
was born, 
And Wry thing was quite prepared 
For that eventful morn. 
My father's friends, my mother's too, 
Agreed with one consent, 
And thus the birth of this here child, 
Was nam'd the " great event." 
CHORLTS.—And a 
great event it surely was, 
And what they said they meant, 
For you'll all agree with them and me, [Repeat 
That I'm the " great event." 
I 
was sent to school, my daddy thought 
I 
then might make my way, 
And didn't I 
thrash the other kids, 
When we went out to play; • 
And tile schoolmaster he thrasled me. 
To the black hole I 
was sent, 
Says he, " when I 
make a 
man of you 
'Twill be a 
great event." [And a 
great,&c. 
I 
tried to follow the old man's trade, 
A barber bold was he, 
But shaving dirty customers 
Was not the cheese for me; 
So I 
left the old folks both at home, 
Without the least comment 
And became a 
brave militia-man, 
And that was a" great event." ( And a 
great, ttc. 
I've travelled old England nearly through, 
A roving life I 
lead; 
And all the girls they fall in love 
With me, they do indeed; 
My manly form their hearts will warm, 
And when their eyes are bent 
On me, I 
often bear them say, 
"There goes the ' great event.'" [And a 
great, Scc. 
But a 
little circumstance occurred, 
That I'll relate to you, 
And whether you all believe it 
Or not, it is quite true; 
A blooming child, the other day, 
Was to me safely sent, 
With a 
note containing just these words, 
" 
The second great event." [ And a 
great, Ete.

I've tried a 
dodge ten times or more 
To hit 4, 11, 44,,

But I 
didn't make a

dreamt last night I 
caught a

It weight ten pounds, that wasn't bad; 
A darkey said, go it, Billy, or burst, 
You'll catch 'em sure on 7

:But I 
didn't, &c. 
So then I 
thought I 
could win, 
But Ben Wood said, just try again; 
And as my pile was not so big, 
I 
paid five cents and bought a 
gig. 
But I 
didn't, itc. 
The more I 
dreamed, the more I 
dropped, 
They cleaned me out before I 
stopped'; 
I 
played the saddle and the horse, 
And now I'm played out with my boss. 
But I 
didn't, cte. 
To policy I've given the shake, 
The more you put the less you take; 
To Blackwell's Island, free from care,

612•111.11.011•11.EM... 
" 
Harry Bluffs" and " Tom Bowlines " are now only to be found in all 
their native colors portrayed in the pages of Marryatt. 
This edition is from 
he latest revised copy, and is the cheapest in the world. 
PRICE TWENTY-FIVE CENTS EACH. 
NEWTON FOSTER.— One pe-
rusal of this will give a 
clearer idea 
of a 
seaman's existence than a 
voy-
age around the Horn. 
MIDSHIPMAN EASY.—This 
writer never wrote a 
dull book, and 
this one is the least of all open to 
that fault. 
PETER SIIIIPLE.—This is one 
of the best sea stories in any lan-
guage. 
Thousands have laughed 
at the locker full of fun that the 
Captain opens for all. 
PACHA OF MANY TALES. 
The many tales will be found equal 
to one another, and all excellent, 
and never tedious in length. 
THE PIRATE AND THE 
1' II It EE CtT 'j'rI. Rs • — 
Frowning men, clambering aboard 
contested craft; shots exchanged; 
cutlasses clashing— in short, fierce 
encounters fill these thrilling pages. 
THE KING'S OWN.— 
Unal-
loyed enjoyment—the sea-breeze, 
the exciting espisodes, the novel 
scenes and persons, without the 
discomforts attending them. 
JAPIIET IN SEARCH OF 
A FATHER. 
— There has risen 
not one worthy to wield Marryatt's 
pen. 
No reader regrets starting 
out with Japhet in his long search. 
SNARLEYOIV, THE DOG 
FIEND.—If laughing makes peo-
ple increase in bulk, " Snarleyow " 
would have been found guilty of 
making Daniel Lamberts of the 
human race. 
JACOB FAITHFUL. — There 
has rarely been a 
man placed in a 
position so fitted for seeing the sail-
or's life as Captain Marryatt, and 
never one so able in portraying it. 
FRANK MILDMAY. — Per-
haps in no other work does Marry-
att better evince his talent than he 
does in " Frank Mildmay." None 
can beat the " Cap." 
PERCIVAL KEENE. — A 
thorough knowledge of every wish, 
hope, and fear of a 
sailor, makes 
Marryatt the best nautical novelist 
that ever lived. 
PIIANTo3I SHIP.— Now, if 
anybody knows more about " Wiz-
ard Skiffs" and " Flying Dutch-
men " than Marryatt, he can take 
our tarpaulin. 
IIATLIN, THE REEFER._ 
The happiest days of our existence 
were when we were " laying off " 
in the foretop of old " Ironsides," 
reading this charming book to our 
all-delighted messmates. 
THE POACHER.. — Marryatt 
proves that he could write as well 
of " shore" life. 
The adventures 
of Joseph Rushbrook are at once 
very extraordinary and very affect-
ing. 
POOR JACK.—The history of 
this little sea- side waif is one of the 
most genuine narratives of a 
sailor..

tered in the log-book of life.
