Upper Cut Styling Salon is located in the Appalachian Mountains in the small town of 
Lewisburg, West Virginia. This was my first time visiting Appalachia and to be honest, 
being a black woman, I was a little nervous about how I might be received. It was a 
beautiful drive through the mountains and once I arrived in Lewisburg I was surprised to 
see the mansions lining the street. The town looked old and had a quiet southern charm. 
Terri’s salon is located in downtown Lewisburg which is has a very quaint old-town 
feeling. The salon was not easy to find, it’s hidden away on a side street but once I 
found it there was a parking spot right out front.  
 
I arrived at the salon around noon. Terri welcomed me with a big warm hug and a smile. I 
instantly felt comfortable and realized my nerves were unwarranted. The salon was 
empty except for her receptionist sitting at the front desk. The salon was bright and 
spacious. Terri had cleared her schedule for the day so we would have a quiet space to 
conduct the interview. I set up the recording equipment in the waiting area of the salon. 
The interview lasted about an hour. Her client, Karen Bowling arrived towards the end of 
the interview and I set up the tripod and camera equipment to photograph Terri doing 
hair. I left the salon around 3pm.
