" 
RING DOWN THE CURTAIN." 
W ords by GEORGE COOPER. 
3 
Music by CHARLES E. 
PRATT 
" 
RING down the curtain I" the last act is o'er, 
The sad play of life is now past; 
One more is nearing the dark, unknown shore, 
The moments are waning so fast! 
Far from the burden, the tumult and strife, 
While tears dimm'd each sorrowing eye; 
Sad was the whisper, the last words of life : 
"It's no use, God bless you! Good-bye ! " 
CHORUS. 
"Ring down the curtain ! " Oh, sweet be the sleep 
That waits the kind-hearted on high! 
Fondly this mem'ry the heart now will keep ; 
" 
It's no use, God bless you, God bless you, 
good-bye ! " 
"Ring down the curtain !" no more shall we see 
The sweet smile so kindly and true; 
Dim are the eyes that once sparkled with glee, 
The hopes that were bright as the dew! 
Dear is the vision that mem'ry recalls, 
To hearts that forever must sigh ; 
Sad is the echo that lingering falls : 
" 
It's no use, God bless you! Good-bye !" 
" 
IlitAg down the curtain !" etc. 
"THAT SETTLES IT." 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Or sayings sharp and sayings 
Which now and then we hear a 
bit, 
There's one of which I 
now do sing, 
Which beats them all—" That settles it." 
You hear it used most every day, 
That curious, jovial little bit, 
And as I've told you what it is, 
I 
now may say—" that settles it." 
CHORUS. 
" 
That settles it," " that settles it," 
It is the latest little bit, 
That settles it, that settles it, 
Oh yes, indeed, that settles it. 
Now I 
went the other night 
Upon a 
bit of spree, you know, 
A 
policeman did soon request 
That I 
with him should quickly go. 
I 
swore a 
thousand times that I'd 
Be darned if I 
would stir a 
bit ; 
But when his big club he showed to me, 
I 
calmly said—" that settles it." 
That settles it, etc 
I 
called the other night to see 
A 
sweet dear little girl of mine; 
Her pa no sooner saw me than 
He made for me a 
straight bee-line. 
He fetched me such a 
fearful kick, 
I 
felt as if a 
locomotive had me hit, 
And on my way down in the street I 
cried, 
In fearful tones—" that settles it." 
That settles it, etc. 
STRANGERS NO MORE.

Price 40 cents. 
STRANGERS HO more forever, 
Still we as friends shall meet ; 
Give back thy heart's affection— 
Trustful and true and sweet. 
What is the summer's glory, 
Far from thy loving sight ? 
Now in my heart forever 
Reigneth supreme delight! 
Strangers no more forever, 
Each bitter word forgot ; 
Gaze in mine eyes so fondly ; 
Des,i.est, 0 doubt me not 
Strangers no more forever, 
Each loving vow renew I 
Welcom'd as summer roses 
Welcome the diamond dew. 
Life, that was sad and lonely, 
Now is one blissful dream ; 
Sunlight and joy forever 
Here in my heart shall beam. 
Strangers no more forever, 
Each bitter word forgot; 
Gaze in mine eyes so fondly ; 
Dearest, 0 doubt me not I 
EVANGELINE. 
An original Song and Dance, performed with immense success by the 
DALY BROTHERS. 
Written by TH0313 S 
DALY. 
In the summer when the birds begin to sing, 
And the pretty notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valley and the woodland ring. 
Down by a 
little running stream, 
in a 
neat white cot, down in a 
shady dell, 
There lives a 
fairy queen ; 
She is the fairest maid there is beneath the Suns 
Is my Evangeline. 
Cnortus. 
In the summer when the birds begin to sing, 
And the pretty notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valley and the woodland ring, 
I'll wed my sweet Evangeline. 
Now of all the sweetest creatures in the land, 
Ever the sweetest one, yes, the dearest one ; 
And I'll happy be whene'er I 
gain the hand 
Of my pretty sweet Evangeline. 
For she is such a 
belle, and always looks so well, 
And mine she'll surely be; 
Pm as happy as a 
king, or a 
bird upon the wing, 
And I 
sing and dance with glee_ 
In the summer, etc. 
WHY CAN'T I HAVE A BEAU ? 
Copyright, 1875, by E. H. HARDING, Music Publisher, 229 Bowery, T. Y 
Price 10 cents. 
As Sung by BERTHA For. 
I THINK Ws very cruel— 
Now here I'm seventeen, 
And have not got a 
lover— 
A " Beau," of course, I 
mean, 
There's lots of charming fellows, 
Who smile and flirt with me ; 
But matarlyt says, when older, 
'Tis time enough, you see I 
CHORUS. 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? 
I'm sure I'd like to know ! 
I'm sure it's wrong to wait so long— 
Why can't I 
have beau ? 
I 
never go to parties 
Without Papa, you know, 
Who watches me so closely— 
Oh I 
ain't it awful slow ? 
He takes me home so early, 
While other girls they stay, 
Aiiil with some charming fellow 
They pass the hours away. 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? etc. 
If I 
should go a 
walking 
Ana meet some one I 
knew, 
And he should see me safely 
At home, then say, adieu I 
If I 
should ask him kindly, 
A 
moment to come in, 
Papa would say, 'twas awful! 
And mamma, such a 
sin ! 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? etc. 
I'm growing quite discouraged, 
I 
am, upon my word; 
I 
won't be any longer 
Kept shut up like a 
bird. 
This world was made for pleasure; 
Then I 
am bound to try 
An'i sea a 
little of it, 
That some. folks would deny. 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? eta, 
DAYS GONE BY. 
Words by P. J. DOWNEY. Sung by JIMMY YOUNG. 
The times are very hard, my friends, 
And getting worse each clay; 
A 
young man's chance is just as slim 
As he that's old and gray. 
Now when I 
think of old times, 
It almost makes me cry; 
For an honest man could live with ease 
In days gone by. 
CHORUS. 
If then a 
man was needy, 
A 
helping hand was nigh; 
For the people lived in harmony, 
In days gone by. 
When I 
was young the boys were not 
Afraid to take a 
glass; 
We would have a 
tight between ourselves, 
And that would quickly pass. 
But now with knives and pistols, 
Oh, my, it makes me sigh! 
For we never carried things like them 
In days gone by. 
If then a 
man, etc. 
When I 
was but a 
little boy. 
Oh, what a 
change since then I 
Our government was then ruled by 
The very bet: or men. 
We all lived gay and happy, 
I'll tell the reason why : 
Then men were for the country's good 
In days gone by. 
If then a 
man, etc. 
You see I 
am a 
poor old man, 
I 
once was light and gay, 
I 
have had my days like many more, 
I 
soon will pass away. 
Oh, when my end is nearing! 
One wish, oh, let me die 
Where the thiug I 
see remind me 
Of the days gone by! 
If then a 
man, etc. 
MAE. 
Written by W ALLY W EST. 
Music by PETRUCHIO H ALEY. 
Sung by the Two Dromios of Ethiopian Comedy, HALEY and W EST.. 
W HILE walking down the street one eve, 
'Twas in the month of May, 
I 
saw a 
charming little blonde, 
Come tripping o'er the way 
She was the sweetest creature, 
Whom I 
ever did behold, 
With flashing eyes of azure blue, 
And curls that shone like gold. 
As she tripped across the street, 
I 
saw her pretty feet, 
She looked just like a 
fairy, blithe and gay. 
I 
never shall forget, 
The day when first I 
met, 
My darling, fascinating little Mae. 
followed her some distance, 
In hopes to catch a 
smile, 
And though she never looked behind, 
She knew it all the while. 
Her silence filled my heart with strength 
And really made me bold, 
So much so that I 
dared to speak. 
She turned her head of gold. 
Her smile, like Cupid's dart, 
Pierced through this darkey's heart. 
When she spoke to me she stole my heart away. 
I 
never shall forget 
That day on which I 
met 
My darling, fascinating little Mae. 
MEDLEY-. 
"Waiting." 
THE Stars shine on his pathway, 
The trees bend back their leaves, 
To guide him thro' the meadows, - 
Among the golden sheaves ; 
Where stand I
- watching, waiting, 
And listen while I 
wait, 
To the nightingale's sweet singing, 
Sweet singing to his mate. 
Singing, singing  
"Jeremiah, Blow the Fire." 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, 
Puff, puff, puff! 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, 
Puff, puff, puff ! 
First you blow it gently, 
Then you blow it rather rough, 
Jeremiah, blow the fire  
" 
Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane." 
In that little old log cabin in the lane. 
CHORUS. 
Things are changed about the place, the darkeys all are 
gone, 
I 
cannot hear them singing in the cane ; 
And the only friend that's left me, is that little boy of 
"I wish I 
was a 
Fish." 
At the bottom of the deep blue sea, oh, my ! 
CHORUS. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fish with a 
great big tail, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fish with a 
great long tail, 
A 
tiny little tittlebat, a 
whiukle or a 
whale, 
At the bottom of the deep blue sea, oh, my ! 
MEDLEY.—Continued. 
Take this letter to my mother, 
Far across the deep blue sea; 
It will fill her heart with pleasure, 
She'll be glad to hear— 
Such an Education has my Mary Ann." 
My Mary Ann's a 
teacher, in a 
great big public school, 
She gets one thousand dollars every year; 
Oh, she's studied Greek and Latin, real French and 
Timbuctoo, 
German, Spanish, Turk and. Hindoostan, 
Portuguese, Irish and Jerusalem Hebrew; 
Such an education has my Mary Ann. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
dumpling, she's a 
lamb ; 
You should hear her play on the pi-an-a, 
Such an education has my— 
Eileen Allanna," 
Eileen Allanna, Eileen astore, 
Queen of my heart, and my love evermore I 
It seems years have parted since 
" 
Twilight in the Park." 
Twilight in the park, 
Twilight in the park, 
Cupid lingers there, 
And no one nigh to mark— 
"

That dear little shamrock ! 
That sweet little shamrock! 
That dear little, sweet—

Little Maud, little Maud, 
She's the daintiest darling of all

" 
When a 
Little Farm we Keep." 
When a 
little farm we keep, 
And have little girls and boys, 
And little cows and pigs to make 
A 
little noise, 
Oh, what merry, what happy times we'll see 
With our children sitting  
"By the Sad Sea Waves." 
By the sad sea waves I 
listen while they moan 
" 
Whoa, Emma." 
Whoa., Emma ! Whoa, Emma ! 
Emma, you put me in such a 
dilemma ! 
Whoa, Emma ! Whoa, Emma ! 
That's what they said  
" 
Then You'll Remember Me." 
When other lips and other hearts, 
Their tales of love shall tell, 
In language whose excess imparts 
The power they feel so well. 
There may, perhaps, in such a 
scene 
Some recollection be, 
Of days that have as happy been, 
Then you'll remember  
" 
First She Would and then She Wouldn't." 
First she would and then she wouldn't, 
Then she could and then she couldn't, 
Then she should and then she shouldn't, 
Oh, you naughty, naughty man !

UNDER THE ARCH IN THE PARK. 
Dedicated to Miss JENNIE MormAN. 
Words by W. E. MelcuLT -r. 
Music by GEO. VON KAMEKE. 
(Copyrighted) 
UNDER the arch in the park, 
We were delightfully dreaming, 
Sweet was the song of the lark, 
Sunbeams around us are streaming ; 
He sat with his hand clasped in mine, 
My heart how I 
longed to unmask it, 
Glad to have said " It is thine." 
Had lie the courage to ask i. 
CHORUS. 
Birds of the air, joyous and fair, 
Singing from dawn until dark ; 
Were you asleep, or did you just peep 
Tinder the arch in the park ? 
Under the arch in the park, 
Shadows around us were falling, 
Hushed was the song of the lark, 
Only the night- birds were calling ; 
He whispered in tenderest strains, 
But his love, au 1 
he dared not reveal it, 
A 
kiss would have soothed all his pains— 
Had he the courage to steal it. 
Birds of the air, etc. 
-Under the arch in the park, 
Moonlight around us was shining, 
He timidly made the remark : 
" 
Oh ! for a 
heart I 
am pining. 
You might give me yours, love," he said, 
" 
I 
promise you never to break it." 
I 
blushed and I 
hung down my head— 
Then he mustered up courage to take it. 
Birds of the air, etc.

OH 
! 
some may sing of sweet moselle, 
Or topaz, sherry claret, port ; 
For common wines they'll do quite well, 
But as for me, they're not the sort. 
Fill me a 
bumper to the brim 
Of Piper Heidsieck, sparkling gay, 
And every care and shadow dim 
Will take the hint and fly away, 
CHORUS. 
Heidsieck, yes, Piper Heitisieek! 
That is the wine, boys, bumper divine, boys. 
Heidsieck, yes, Piper Heidsieck ! 
That is the wine, boys, the wine for me ! 
For Rhine wine some may have a 
taste, 
And some may fancy other brands; 
But as for me when on a 
spree, 
The wine I 
drink unrivalled stands. 
It softly climbs up to my brain, 
And sings for me the sweetest songs ; 
While all the joys of life again 
Come flocking 'round in fairy throngs!

Oh, ' tis the wine I 
love to drink, 
It keeps me merry all the year ! 
What joy to see its bubbles wink 
Like diamond eyes we love so dear. 
Take whiskey, brandy, if you choose, 
No pleasure in the draught I 
see ; 
But, oh, to drive,away the blues 
It's Piper Heidsieck, boys, for me ! 
Heidsieck, etc. 
It makes you every pain forget, 
It makes the darkest day so bright; 
The only draught I've seen as yet 
To tempt a 
fellow's appetite. 
Tho' cocktails are the style at morn 
When heads are dizzy, very queer, 
The drink to take when you are gone 
Is Piper Heidsieck sparkling clear ! 
Heidsieck, yes, Piper Heidsieck, 
That is the wine, boys, bumper divine, boys, 
Heidsieck, yes, Piper Heidsieck, 
That is the wine, boys, the wine for me!

UINA. 
Written by WALLY WEST, Sung only by " Les Grotesque Eccentriques," 
HALEY and WEST. 
Or all the pretty, winsome girls that ever yet were seen, 
Mv Uina, with the jet black curls, must surely be the 
queen; 
She is the sweetest maiden who has ever charmed my 
eyes, 
And when I 
marry her I'm sure that I 
shall get a 
prize. 
CHORUS. 
She's like a 
little fairy, 
So winsome, light and airy, 
The queen of all the charming girls is she, my little pet ; 
She fascinates the darkeys all, does my Uina, my pretty 
brunette. 
In the forest 'neath the murmuring pines, where first I 
met my love, 
Her bright eyes pierced me through and through, I 
seem-
ed in heaven above, 
I 
knelt down on a 
mossy bank and offered her my heart, 
She said she'd give me her's instead, for 'twas pierced 
with Cupid's dart. 
CHORUS. 
She's like a 
little fairy, 
So winsome, light and airy, 
The queen of all the charming girls is she, my little pet; 
She fascinates the darkeys all, does my Ulna, my pretty 
brunette.

Sung only by HALEY and WEST. 
OFall the pleasant ways to spend a 
charming summer 
night, 
The nicest is to take a 
sail 'neath Luna's melting light. 
The other eve I 
asked my girl, if she with me would go, 
She answered yes, and what we did I 
now will tell to 
you, 
CHORUS. 
We were sailing o'er the lake, the moon in beauty shone, 
The birds all sang with light free hearts, responsive to 
our own. 
Unheeded thus time passed away, till the waves began to 
break, 
Reminding us ' twas time to leave the charming moonlit 
lake. 
Our little bark so lightly rode the white crowned glisten-
ing waves 
Which glowed beneath the pure moonlight, like coral 
from their caves. 
We sang our love songs, and the sound the echoes did 
awake, 
We plighted troth that summer night, out on the moonlit 
lake. 
CHORUS.

ROLLING ON THE GRASS. 
To those who live in cities, 
Where but bricks and mortar's seen, 
There's nothing so refreshing 
As " a 
little bit of green ! " 
So often on a 
summer's day, 
An idle hour to pass, 
Off to the fields I'd get away, 
And roll about the grass. 
CHORUS. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
An idle hour to pass ; 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child again, 
Rolling on the grass. 
The prettiest of carpet ' tis, 
That ever could be found, 
With daisies sprinkled here and there, 
And May bushes around ; 
A 
bright blue roof above, o'er which 
The silver clouds sail by, 
Arid skylarks think it but a 
lark, 
To sing up in the sky. 
CHORUS. 
While you're rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
An idle hour to pass, 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child again, 
Rollims-
Lf on the grass. 
( ) 
One day, whilst I 
reclining was, 
And half inclined to dream, 
I 
suddenly was startled by 
A 
female's piercing scream ; 
Towards me rushed a 
pretty girl, 
In fearful state of mind, 
And followed by a 
frantic cow, 
Unpleasantly behind. 
SPOKEN. — Of course to spring to my feet and catch the 
fainting maiden in my arms was but the work of a 
quarter of a 
second ; the cow on seeing my defiant atti-
tude came to a 
full stop, and stared; I 
said, waving my 
hat commandingly, ' Go away, cow—go away directly !" 
and so she did, and sent us both  
CHORUS. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
That awful cow did pass ; 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child again, 
Rolling on the grass. 
I 
often met her after that, 
And this was ray excuse, 
That should ' a 
frantic cow " turn up, 
I 
perhaps might be of use ; 
She's going to change her name for mine, 
When a 
few short weeks shall pass, 
And so I 
bless that blessed cow, 
And rolling on the grass. 
CHORUS. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
An idle hour to pass. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child again, 
Rolling on the grass.

I 
TICKLED HER UNDER THE CHIN. 
Music published by G. P. BENJAMIN', 712 Eighth Avenue, can be 
obtained from any music dealer. (Copyright 1876, by W . 
P. 
DENHOFF.) 
Written and composed by ITAnnv MoNTAcluE, and sung by him with 
overwhelming applause at Tony Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
I 
met a 
fair charmer a 
few weeks ago, 
In a 
Madison Avenue stage, 
Her style and her figure it pleased me, you know, 
She was just about the right age. 
As we were alone, I 
suggested to her 
In terms quite polite and refined, 
That I'd be moSt happy to see her safe home, 
She said yes, if you'll be so kind. 
SPOKEN.—SO 
I 
took the young lady to her home, she invited 
me in, and I 
spent a 
very pleasant evening, and just before I 
left 
CHORIJS. 
I 
tickled her under the chin, 
Repeat—I 
tickled again and again, 
She did not say no, she liked it, you know, 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
I 
called by appointment to see her next day, 
And asked her if she'd take a 
drive, 
She said I'm delighted, that's just what I 
want, 
And in a 
moment was close by my side. 
Now driving, you know, makes your appetite keen, 
So when we got back, to Delmonico's we went, 
And I 
ordered same oysters and wine. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we had a 
delightful supper together, and after 
supper, when the wine commenced to make her cheeks rosy, I 
reached across the table, and I 
I 
TICKLED HER UNDER THE CHIN— Continued. • 
Now I 
see her quite often, and you won't be surprised 
That our friendship ripened so fast, 
For I 
found that in her, I 
really had met 
A dear, darling creature at last. 
And our love grows stronger, day after day, 
We're going to be married next June. 
And it all came, through that queer little way, 
That I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SPOKEN.—So 
last night when she bid me good-by at the front 
door, she said Charley, you dear good fellow, I'll never forget 
the first time that you— 
Tickled me under the chin, 
That you tickled me under the chin, 
I 
didn't say no, for I 
liked it you know, 
When you tickled me under the chin, 
When I 
tickle her under the chin, 
I 
tickled again and again, 
She did not say no, for she liked it, you know, 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SPOKEN.—This is the moral of the story: 
You all have a 
chance for adventures like this, 
With the charming young ladies you meet, 
And you'll find on an average that five out of ten 
Won't object to a 
drive and a 
treat; 
But pray let me give you one piece of advice, 
When a 
girl's loving kiss you would win, 
Just do it quite gently, and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the clan. 
CHORUS. 
When you tickle her under the chin, 
Repeat—When you tickle her under the chin. 
Just do it quite gently, and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the chin.

AMONG THE VIOLETS. 
Written by W ALLY W EST. 
Sung only by HALEY and W EST. 
BY 
the steamlet where the violets bloom, 
As once by chance I 
strolled, 
I 
saw a 
dazzling picture bright, 
Like rubies set in gold. 
I 
found ' twas the coral lips and golden curls 
Of a 
charming girl, 
Whose heavenly eyes, so dazzling bright, 
Had set my brain awhirl. 
I 
offered her my arm, she took it, 
Then we both did go, 
Strolling by the murmuring streamlet, 
Where the violets grow. 
Oh! we spoke of love, so fondly then, 
As we wandered through the glen. 
She talked so sweetly then completely, 
Charming me as on we went. 
I 
can't forget that happy meeting 
Down among the violets. 
But earthly joys must fade away, 
And time must take its flight ; 
Yet, though the months have passed since then, 
ne'er forget that night. 
'Tis ever sacred to my heart, 
And will be all through life, 
For as we strolled beside the brook, 
She sail she'd be my wife. 
And soon she will confide 
Her darling self unto my care, 
Then all our paths through life 
Must be blooming ever bright and fair. 
Oh ! we spoke of love, etc. 
VISION OF MY DREAM. 
Written by W ALLY W EST. 
Sung only by " Les Grotesque Eccen• 
triques," IIALEy and W EST. 
UPON a 
little mossy bank beside a 
rippling stream, 
I 
lay ine down one slimmer eve and fell into a 
dream, 
I 
seemed to be in Fairyland Nvhile voices sweet and clear, 
In delicious strains of music sweet, fell upon my ear ; 
Their queen appeared, I 
started, for beside the meadow 
stream 
Appeared in all her loveliness, the vision of my dream. 
CHORT'S. 
So bewilderingly beautiful this pretty girl did seem, 
I 
felt my heart leap forth to meet the vision of my 
dream. 
At first so great was my surprise, I 
knew not what to say, 
For the sight of so much loveliness quite took my breath 
away, 
Then starting up I 
culled a 
bunch of violets from the 
ridge, 
And place them 'mongst her curls just as she crossed the° 
rustic bridge. 
She thanked me with a 
sweet, sweet smile, her eyes with 
love did beam, 
I 
poured forth all my heart and love to the vision of my 
dream. 
So bewilderingly beautiful, etc. 
As we onward walked, of love we talked, till she said 
'twas time to go, 
I 
pressed a 
kiss of true love on her forehead white as 
Snow, 
I asked her if she'd be my wife, she said she couldn't 
say, 
But she'd answer me down by the bridge if I'd meet her 
there some day. 
I 
went, but I 
shan't tell you what she said there by the 
stream. 
Next Sunday eye I'm going to see the vision of my 
dream.

A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS .—M R. AND M RS. FIBS. 
[Scene—drawing-room. 
rrim---2 o'clock, A...1f] 
M RS. FIB13S (
seated at tahle.) 
F. Heigh ho ! 
It's two o'clock, and that odious 
husband has not come home ! Oh, how I 
would like to 
be 7'n his hair just now I 
Ugh ! I 
hate him ! Night after 
night he leaves me to go to his wicked clubs. 
This is a 
specimen of the hour he returns, 
When he does come 
home he's generally so " how-come-you-so " that he can't 
bite his own finger. 
Oh, what a 
fool I 
was to marry him ! 
But I'll pack up my trunk, and go back to mamma, I 
will. 
Ther,., I'm determined. 
I'll try him once more, to- night, 
and if I 
don't succeed in breaking up this bad habit of 
his, off I 
go. 
(Coinesp»-icard, sings.) 
" 
W HAT A FOOL A YOUNG GIRL IS TO M ARRY." 
" 
Air.—Bell Goes a- Ringing for Sarah." 
I 
was once what was called quite a 
beauty, 
I 
wandered as free as the birds ; 
Bat I 
married, I 
thought it my duty,— 
Cajoled by a 
silly man's words. 
Oh, now matrimony's perplexing, 
My husband won't come home to tea ; 
His answers are ugly and vexing, 
And very insulting to me. 
What a 
fool a 
young girl is to marry, 
Marry, marry ! 
What a 
fool a 
young girl is to marry 
And give her freedom up ! 
Not home yet ! 
I 
shall go mad ! 
Then he's so ag-
gravating when he has a 
drop too much. Only last night, 
or rather yesterday morning, he staggered into the house, 
and would insist on saying " No " to everything I 
said. 
( ) 
YES.—Continued. 
I 
asked him if he wasn't ashamed to leave his truly wedded 
wife alone. 
He said " No !" I 
told him that probably he 
might be sorry if he knew that some one had been here in 
his absence. " No !" said he, in the coolest manner. 
I 
tell you what I 
will do to cure him. 
I'll take the opposite 
tack this morning when he comes in. and say " Yes !" to 
everything he says. 
I'll see how he likes it. 
(Xoise on the stairs outside.) 
There he conies at last, and I'll warrant as drunk as a 
lord !

When far away to other climes 
Your Fibbsey, ma'am, shall go, 
When nevermore you'll spend his dimes,

One sweet little wish I

Think of me, Fibbsey dear ! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you, darling, 
When your clothes Avid look very queer ; 
One sweet little wish, darling., grant me,— 
Think of me, Fiblosey dear !

HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price ten cents. 
Written and composed by G. W. II LT,NT. 
They tell me I 
am too bashful by far, 
And sometimes I 
think they are right, 
But so awfully naughty the masculines are, 
No wonder one feels in a 
fright. 
I've been led to believe men were born to deceive, 
So when they their compliments pay, 
In language absurd, I 
don't hear a 
word, 
But first as a 
caution I 
say: 
CHORUS. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say; 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say; 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are. 
When I 
go to a 
ball, and one asks me to dance, 
At the finish I 
soon slip away, 
For I 
know Mr. Noodle, if he has the chance, 
Is sure to have something to say: 
So I 
stop the sad man as Foon as I 
can, 
In case he'd be going to 
far, 
Perhaps what he'd tell me he has told two or three, 
For such sad Don Giovanis they are. 
Go away, etc. 
I 
dread Christmas time whene'er it comes ' round, 
'Tho' it's awfully jolly, I 
know, 
But so many young men, again and again, 
Lead me under the mistletoe ; 
Oh! would you believe, on last Christmas eve, 
I 
found a 
young man at my feet, 
With an offer of marriage, a 
mansion and carriage, 
Of course I 
soon beat a 
retreat. 
Go away, etc. 
KITTY CLARE. 
Irish ballad. sung by " Les Grotesque Eccentriques," HALEY and W EST, 
in their Beautiful Society Sketch, entitled " Down on the Old 
Plantation Bitters." 
Esi Erin's isle, the shamrock's home, lives the darling of 
my heart, 
I 
see her yet, I 
can't forget when Kate and I 
did part 
I soothed her sorrow, bade farewell, then murmured 
"Kitty, think of me," 
Then grasped her father's hand, and loft them to cross 
the stormy sea. 
I 
whispered, Katy, don't forget, but to me still be true, 
I'll soon return to Innesfell, my colleen dear, for you. 
Katy, my darling, when tempests be snarling, 
The faith of my colleen will shield me from harm. 
Pure as the flowers, washed by the showers, 
Katy, my darling, your presence is a 
charm. 
ne'er forget, when first we met, down by the old oak 
mill, 
And the sweet things that you told me then are sounding 
to ine still ; 
You told me, Kitty, that you loved me, that you'd given 
me your heart, 
That you would be true unto me ' till death did us part. 
Oh, Katy, darling, don't forget, but to me still be true. 
I'll soon return to Erin's isle, my colleen dear, for you. 
Katy, my darling, blithe as a 
starling 
I'll still try to be, though my heart's bowed with care; 
By the bright stars above, still will I 
love thee, 
My heart's only darling, my meet Kitty Clare. 
THAT YOUNG MAN ACROSS THE WAY. 
SONG AND CII01:11S. 
Words by Miss KATIE BELLE W ICH3IANN. 
Music by E. MacK. 
W ELL, I 
wonder what's the meaning, 
Always looking over here, 
When I'm at the parlor window, 
He is sure then to appear; 
Every evening as I 
sit there, 
Just before the close of day. 
There he is, with roguish glances, 
Watching me across the way. 
So let him stare, I 
do not care, 
I 
shall not go away ; 
Young men who live across the street 
Must look across the way. 
He has brown hair, dark and waving, 
And his eyes, I 
think, are gray, 
But I 
know, whate'er their color, 
Often do they look this way, 
And one tender twillight evening, 
I'm quite sure that he did this— 
Just before I 
left the window, 
Unto me he threw a 
kiss. 
So let him stare, etc. 
From the other side, one evening, 
To our door he found his way, 
After that, ' twas very often 
That he came across the way ; 
And while sitting by our window, 
There was much he made me say, 
And, 'mong other things, I 
promised 
That I'd live across the way. 
So let him stare, etc. 
DON'T FORGET TO BE KIND TO THE BOYS. 
Written expressly for LITTLE BOB by BEN DODGE. 
There is something which I 
wish to mention to you, 
While trying to please with my song; 
Some solid advice unto you I 
will give; 
Please listen, it's not very long. 
Your attention I'll call to the poor little boys 
You will meet on the street every day, 
Do not spurn them aside with a 
curse or a 
kick, 
When by chance they are thrown in your way. 
CHORUS. 
Don't think they're too small to be noticed at all, 
Let them share in your sorrows and joys, 
Their love will repay your kindness some day. 
Don't forget to be kind to the boys. 
If a 
poor boy accosts you while trying to earn 
By honest means but half a 
dime, 
If you have it to spare, buy a 
paper at once, 
Or invest when he proffers a 
shine. 
lie has loved ones at home who upon him depends 
For the poor crusts of bread which they eat: 
And the brave, honest boy, to provide them with food, 
has to labor each day in the street. 
Don't think they're too small, etc. 
The greatest of statesmen were once small like me, 
And no one can tell what s 
in store 
Tor a 
boy in the future, if upright be proves, 
No matter if now he is poor. 
So, unheeded, don't pass the advice which I 
give, 
But by your applause let me see 
Thatyou promise to ever ho kind to boys, 
And I 
hope you'll begin here with me. 
Don't think they're too small, etc.

THE old inan ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And these hands refuse to do the daily toil ; 
I 
never dream'd 'twould come to this, or that I'd be in 
need, 
After years of service in Carlina soil. 
My limbs are bending 'neath their weight, my hair is white 
as snow, 
And I 
cannot see the gentle summer sky ; 
My feet grow weary day by day, my step is weak and slow, 
And I'm gwine to leave my comrades by and by. 
CHORUS. 
The old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to 
seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to 
seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The good old days when I 
was young have flitted like a 
dream, 
And I 
hardly knew that I 
was growing old ; 
I 
never stopped to think how these poor arms of mine 
would seem, 
If the poor old man was left out in the cold. 
But now I 
know the feeling well, it almost breaks my heart 
For to think that I 
must die away from home. 
Oh, if I 
could be young again, to-morrow I 
would start, 
And to old Carlina's shores I'd quickly roam. 
The old man ain't himself, etc. 
I 
low-, to see the cotton fields, the tall Palmetto trees, 
And to hear the happy darkeys shout and sing ; 
I 
Dever shall forget the good, the old plantation glees, 
Or the way we used to make the banjo ring ; 
But all is nearly over now, the trumpet soon will sound, 
Then I'll have to cross the river over there ; 
And when I 
set my aching feet upon the sacred ground, 
I 
shall know no mo' about this wordly care. 
The old man ain't himself, etc. 
MY HEART IS BENT UPON A SAILOR 
By 
NED H ARRIGAN. 
- 
As sung by ROSA LEE. 
Oh, I 
love to see the ships, 
Sail in from foreign trips, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
mermaid in the water; 
Or else a 
little pearl, 
Or the darling little girl, 
That the sailors call jolly Neptune's daughterl 
Then when a 
ship would wreck, 
I 
would jump upon the deck, 
Or through a 
golden horn I 
would hail her.; 
I'd pick out from the crew 
Some jolly tar in blue, 
For my heart is always on a 
sailor. 
I'd be constant as a 
dove 
To my bonny own true love, 
If he left me the seas to go a 
roamin'; 
I 
would dream at night of him, 
Aloft in a 
gale of wind, 
You'd never catch me sighing or a 
moaning. 
Saying " I'll meet my darling boy 
With his jolly ship ahoy; 
Who'd be a 
lawyer or a 
tailor, 
I 
never will get wed 
Unless my husband tread 
The dock of a 
vessel as a 
sailor."

"One night," said he, " while out at sea there came a 
dreadful 
gale, 
Which wash'd me overboard and I 
was swallowed by a 
whale, 
And there I 
lived for twenty days wandering about, 
Then seized the whale by the tail and turn'd him inside out."

So if you wish to pass a 
pleasant hour or two away, 
Just call and see old Uncle Jack, and then I 
think you'll say 
He's ev'ry inch a

For many years a 
whaler, quite a 
hero of the sea.

DOWN AMONG TEE DAISIES. 
Written by W. A H UNTLEY, banjoist, for W ILL. II . 
M ORTON. 
Down among the daisies, by the running stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low ; 
Sitting with my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
heedless of the hours that come and go. 
There I 
meet my darling every summer's day, 
And the leaflets nodding up above 
Were the only ones that list to what we'd say, 
As we whispered o'er our tales of love. 
CHORUS. 
Down among the daisies, by the running stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low ; 
Sitting by my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
heedless of the hours that come and go. 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream ; 
Naught will ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the happy glimmer of our dream. 
Days may come and go, like flowers that bloom and die, 
But as long as life is with us, queen, 
We will dwell together, you and I, 
Down among the daisies by the stream. 
Down among the, etc.

THE SONGS MY MOTHER USED TO SING. 
Sang by SAM. DEVERE. 
THE songs my mother used to sing, 
Could I 
but hear them once again. 
To childhood's memories still they cling, 
They soothed my every ache and pain. 
Oh ! how sweet they used to seem, 
flow they made my heart rejoice 
Years, long years seem but a 
dream, 
Still I 
hear my mother's voice. 
CHORUS. 
Childhood's days to me so dear, 
Sweetest recollections cling ; 
How I 
often long to hear 
The songs my mother used to sing. 
Those sweet and simple little songs, 
Songs I 
love so well to hear; 
How they'd heal my childish wrongs, 
How they'd seem to please and cheer. 
Songs in memory buried deep, 
Songs that oft put me to rest, 
Songs that closed my eyes in sleep, 
Lying on my mother's breast. 
Childhood's days to me, etc. 
Every simple little strain, 
Calls to mind some happy Scene, 
Brings up childhood's days again, 
Days to me yet fresh and green ; 
Better to me than glittering gold, 
Greater by far than crown of king ; 
Dearer to me than all the world, 
Are the songs my mother used to sing. 
Childhood's days to me, etc, 
OUR ARMY AND NAVY OF BLUE,

LIST to the music while I 
sing a 
lay, 
In praise of our flag, boys, that waved for many a 
day ; 
It sheltered our soldiers and sailors so true, 
It covers our Army and Navy of Blue. 
CHORUS. 
Over our heads, boys, flaunting to the breez ,,
- ; 
Up to the peak greeting all lands and seas ! 
The emblem of Liberty, ever so true, 
That covers our Army and Navy of Blue. 
Peace be our motto, charity our cause, 
Faith to our colors, respect to our laws ! 
Friendship our greeting, our flag as it flew 
Inspired our brave Army and Navy of Blue. 
Over our heads, boys, flaunting to the breeze 
17p to the peak, greeting all lands and seas ! 
The emblem of Liberty ever so true, 
That covers our Army and Navy of Blue.

CLOSE THE SHUTTERS— WILLIE'S DEAD. 
FAR away from wife and children, 
Still I 
plod my way along, 
Massa Clare has gone to Eva, 
Leaving friendless poor old Tom! 
Yet, with trust and strength in Heaven, 
I 
remain a 
faithful slave ; 
When de whip to me am giben, 
I'll think of Him who died to save ! 
Shall I 
turn against my brother, 
Raise the hand of cruelty ? 
No ! we must love one another, 
Den we'll get where all am free. 
Patience here I'll go to glory, 
There is comfort for the slave ; 
When de lash makes dis flesh gory, 
I'll pray to Him who died to save. 
Good-bye, Chloe, farewell children, 
Poor old Tom you'll see no more ; 
Mind be good and hab religion, 
"Twill bear you to the faithful shore. 
Do not weep nor feel dejection, 
Suffering's over in the grave ; 
But at the glorious resurrection, 
We'll meet with Him who died to save.

Whom we loved so dear— 
Like a 
dream his spirit tied 
From our home, now sad & TA drear; 
When the spring- time flowers w.!.re blooming, 
And the happy birds sung sweet, 
Angels called him to their home, 
Up in heaven where we shall meet.

Close the shutters— Willie's dead. 
Close the shutters—Wiliie's dead; 
Gone in childhood's bloom— 
Pillowed now his little head 
In the cold and silent tomb. 
Beer his grave the daisies blossom, 
Where his little form is laid, 
knd the murm'ring streamlet plays 
'Neath the willow's quiet shade. 
Close the shat,..6r2, 
close the shutters—Willie's dead— 
Death has claimed him now ; 
Never more his smile will shed 
Sunshine on poor mother's brow. 
She is almost brok ,93-hearted, 
And our home is sad to-day ; 
Life has lost its hope and joy, 
Since our Willie's gone away.

THE labor is over and done, 
The sun has gone down in the west, 
The birds are asleep every one, 
All nature has gone to its rest ; 
But one little sleeper is out in the cold, 
Alone, in the rain and sleet ; 
There's no one to greet him with welcome kisses, 
Or list to his coining feet.

Dead! dead! found dead in the the street. 
Dead in the cold night air : 
Dead for the want of a 
crust ; 
With no one to pity or care. 
The daisy looks up from the grass, 
Just fresh from the fingers of night, 
To welcome the birds as they pass, 
And drink in fresh rivers of light. 
But one little sleeper has gone to his rest— 
Has gone to his heavenly birth ; 
And there, all alone, by the church door stone, 
He passed from the sorrows of earth.

DON'T be sighing, little darling, 
Better days will come again, 
Dry your tear- drops, lovely roses 
Soon forget the passing rain. 
We have seen the summer weather, 
We have loved when life was fair, 
So we'll fondly cling together, 
Though our hearts are full of care. 
CHORUS. 
Don't be sighing, little darling, 
Sunshine follows after rain ; 
Though the shadows now are falling, 
Better days will come again. 
Don't be sighing, little darling, 
Come and sit beside me now, 
Though your tresses once were golden, 
Time has silvered o'er your brow. 
Days of sorrow wandered near us, 
But our love is still as pure, 
While adown the hill we journey. 
Ever more it shall endure. 
Don't be sighing, etc. 
Don't be sighing, little darling, 
Brighter skies will shine above, 
Life is gladness, hope is round us, 
While our hearts are full of love. 
Oh, your smiles can make it summer, 
Though the wintry days may blight, 
We will fondly cling together, 
As we've done in days so bright. 
Don't be sighing, etc.

CEASE thy weeping, sadden'd heart,-
Brighter days are on the way, 
And the clouds so dear and dark, 
All will surely pass away. 
Flow'rs of spring will come again, 
Blooming sweetly o'er the lea, 
And the warblers of the grove 
Songs of love will chant for thee. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, cease thy weeping, sadden'd heart, 
Drive away all idle fears, 
Let those clouds of grief and care 
Melt away in silent tears. 
Cease thy weeping, sadden'd heart, 
Why thy face so wan and pale, 
Has thy friend in death been laid 
'Neath the grasses of the vale ? 
Ah ! there is a 
fairer land, 
Where we meet no more to part, 
Let this cheer thee, gentle one, 
Let this soothe thy sadden'd heart. 
Oh, cease thy weeping, etc. 
Cease thy weeping, sadden'd heart. 
Has thy loved one prov'd untrue, 
Has he broken every vow 
That he promis'd only you ? 
Weep not for him, gentle maid, 
He who would both woo and win, 
Then turn traitor to his word, 
Deep has drank of darker sins. 
Oh. cease thy weeping, etc.

HARDING. 
Wno rides yonder, proud and gay, 
Spurning the dust on the King's Highway ? 
Lord of thousand acres wide, 
While I, the beggar, must stand aside ! 
Go thy way ! let me go mine ; 
I 
to beg, and thou to dine : 
Scatter the dust on the King's Highway, 
But room for the beggar, room I 
say. 
Fair and free, night and day, 
Fair and free is the King's Highway ; 
Fair and free, night and day, 
Fair and free is the King's Highway. 
Hug thyself in wealth of state, 
Empty purse has a 
careless gait ; 
Thou must watch thy chests and bags, 
None would steal the beggar's rags. 
Wine for thee, for me a 
crust, 
King and beggar, they both arc dust ; 
And dust to dust will be borne one day, 
High and low on the King's Highway. 
Fair and free, night and day ; 
Fair and free is the King's Highway. 
Fair and free, night and day ; 
Fair and free is the King's Highwa. 
Dainty maid of high degree, 
What has the beggar to do with thee ? 
Thy life is morn, and love is May ; 
What has the beggar to thee to say ? 
Gentle word hat thou for me, 
Tears are in my heart: for thee ; 
Ah, that thou should'st fade One day, 
E'en as I, on the great Highway ! 
Fair and free, night and day ; 
Fair and free is the King's Highway, 
Fair and free, night and day ; 
Fair and free is the King's, the King's Highway. 
THE SUMMER OF LIFE. 
Dedicated to Enwsnn 
By JOHN ERIGENA BAERETT, Author of " Love and Labor." 
0, THE summer of life is a 
joyous time 
When the eye is undimmil by care, 
When the bosom responds to each thought sublime, 
And each propeet on earth is fair ; 
When love lights his lamp at each beautiful shrine, 
And whispers we'll never grow old, 
When happiness lingers on lips half divine, 
Whose smiles are more precious than gold. 
onollus. 
Then let age do its worst 
In this wide world of strife, 
It can never rob me 
Of the Summer of Life. 
They say friends prove false and that Pleasure's a 
sham 
That passes from the touch like a 
dream, 
But while youth is mine I'll be just what I 
am, 
And never endeavor to seem 
A 
slave unto sorrow or whitening hairs : 
Let time march along, I'll be gay ; 
Let those whe 6njoy them have troubles and cares, 
But I'll have mirth while I 
may. 
Then let old age do its worst, etc. 
If wrinkles should come then I'll laugh them away ; 
They cannot abide where there's cheer, 
With a 
jolly ha, ha, they never can stay, 
No wrinkles for me while I'm here ; 
But sunshine and laughter and song to the last, 
And some one I 
love for my wife ; 
Then the tempests may howl, the frosts may fall fast, 
I'll bask in the Summer of Life. 
Then let old age do its worst, etc.

BOY

Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by Wank and 
Goo erAlm, in the Office of the Litnarian of Congress, -Washington, D. C. 
These were the last words of " Amerieus," the well-known child violinist, 
seven years of age, who expired very suddenly during the night of January 
10th, 1874, in Boston 
So 
uietly did his spirit take its flight, that his 
father, who occupied the same room, although hearing his son make the 
foregoing exclamation, thought the boy was talking in his sleep, and was 
horrified to find the little child, cold in death, m the morning.

" 
GOOD night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close, 
And a 
smile came o'er his features radiant with holy joy, 
As if angels came to whisper tidings to our little boy, 
" 
Good night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Good night, father !" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died at, died at twilight's close. 
When night draped Ler sable curtain, hanging folds upon each 
star, 
Came a 
halo soft and lustrous, streaming o'er the window bar ; 
And we heard our darling murmur, as the briohtness lit his face, 
" 
Please God, make me room in heaven, make your little boy a 
place !" 
" 
Good Mein, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close. 
" 
Good night, father !'' etc. 
He was weary of the strurrgle, discords jarred upon his soul ; 
And his gentle spirit left us, wafted to the heavenly goal ; 
He has room among the anuels, he is freed from sin and care; 
God, who watcheth e'en the sparrow, answered little Jitmaie's 
prayer. 
" 
Good night., father !" said our darling, as he sank to sweet re, 
pose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close.

Good night, father !" etc. 
THE SUMMER IS DYING. 
By COL. CLAUDE DE HAVEN. 
THE roses have bloomed for the last time, 
The violets are folded to rest, 
The daisies and butter-cups lying 
Entomb'd on the pimpernel's breast 
The meadow lark's song has abated, 
The robin chirps high on its way 
To the land of the magnolia flowers, 
For the Summer is dying to-day. 
The forest with green blended yellow, 
Is changing its hue to the sere; 
The orchard with fruit ripe and mellow 
Proclaims ' tis the end of the year, 
When flowers shall bloom in their beauty, 
And birds sing their happiest lay— 
The harvest is all garnered safely, 
For the Summer is dying to- day. 
Dying! yes, flowers and humanity, 
Fond affections and friends we deemed pure, 
Dead are the feelings of others 
To the sorrows we may endure. 
Happy thought ! bless'd the vision ! 
May we all leave a 
mark on our way, 
To that land of the bright Elysium, 
While the Summer is dying to-day.

It can be guarded against and repelled by a 
timely use of 
neallh Granules. A person should never 
travel to the mountains, to the . sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a 
supply. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very great. 
DVSPEPSIA, the arch- fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of ??Ifer.iiiiN Health 
Granules. Why I Because these Granules go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not, only drive out the fecu-
lent matter that clogs the avenue-2 
of the body, but they in-
vigorate and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery ; then comes 
a 
good appetite, awl good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
in the Cholera Years it was found that the first 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effectual for 
this purpose as Merlin's Health Granules, for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man. 
" 
I 
DON'T KNOW WHIT AILS NE!" 
How often do we bear this remark. 
A man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet says, " Man delights not 
me, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exercise, loss of appetite, deep grief—all these tend to 
render the fluids of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There 
was a 
health- lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit from its waters. 
It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This is precisely the effect produced 
by Merlin's Health Granules. The sluices are cleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it, is wanted and can do 
most good.

It pro-

irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility ; but, as we have said, Nervous Debility 
Can be cured ; the diseased humors can be driven from the

that every Doctor, after fN!ling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertainine: the teinperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
" 
Are your bowels reoatlar ? " 
This you will therefore 
notice is 
the very Eiey-noge by whicli he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction he learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may wander 
10, he 
rct urnslo the aigestive or,Tans. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lunge, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the head; but it is always the bowels he 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be fir ,t treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
org ans of diaostion.

hurtful. 
nese are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy ? 
Surely a 
medicine powerful

having such baNarnic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the difrerent ducts.
