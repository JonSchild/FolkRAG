Near the intersection of US-59 and Interstate 610, in Northeast Houston,
 
is a court of twenty-three houses--the Khmer Village that is home for about
 
150 Cambodian-Americans.
 At the center of the compound, one of the two-bedroom
 
houses is used not as a residence but as a school.
 In that building,
 
6779 Bonita, adult residents of the Village learn English, women are instructed
 
in health and nutrition, and children study Cambodian reading and writing.
 
The story of the school is the story of the remarkable community it serves,
 
and in large part the story of one remarkable woman.
 
Yani Rose KEO's nominal title is "Job Placement Officer" for the
 
Catholic Charities of Houston, an organization active in assisting Cambodian
 
and other Indochinese refugees since 1975.
 In fact, her responsibilities
 
are much larger, encompassing not just employment but every aspect of
 
social services for the more than 2
,000 Cambodians who have arrived in
 
Houston under the aegis of Catholic Charities.
 In a typical aay,  she might
 
go see the principal of an elementary school, visit sick Cambodians at the
 
hospital, pick up a family arriving at the airport (
and then, provide lodging
 
for them in her own home until permanent housing can be found), make funeral
 
arrangements for a deceased refugee,
 go to a job site t
o clear up a mis-
understanding involving a Cambodian worker,  teach an adult ESL class, settle
 
a domestic dispute at one of her cluster housing sites, and then return home
 
to handstitch a traditional Cambodian wedding dress.  Nor is her work
 
restricted to those refugees sponsored by Catholic Charities: any Cambodian

in need who calls on her will be assisted, to the extent humanly possible.
 
She is a modern-day Jane Addams, motivated by the intense commitment to
 
help her Cambodian countryfolk become self-sufficient, productive, and
 
happy in their new homes.
 
The Khmer Village is the first Houston experiment in "cluster housing"
 
f
or Indochinese refugees.  One of the patterns of immigrant settlement that
 
has been common among recent refugees, especially those in large cities,
 
is for them to cluster themselves in cider neighborhoods and older apartment
 
complexes.  That pattern of unplanned ghettoization has both advantages and
 
disadvantages, but this is not the place to discuss them.  The "cluster
 
housing" designed by Yani KEO i
s very different in important respects from
 
that unplanned clustering.
 Cluster housing brings together, in a carefully
 
prepared and planned manner, thirty to two hundred members of one ethnic
 
group in a single, bounded place--a complex of houses or garden apartments.
 
These clusters are islands of one ethnic group within a larger community
 
made up of another ethnic group, in this case, blacks.  A critical mass allows
 
the residents of the cluster to gain the benefits of living together with
 
people like themselves while simultaneously avoiding the problems of ghettoization,
 
The clusters are relatively small, and separated from one another by some
 
distance, so that no single neighborhood is saturated.  For example, all of
 
the children at the Village attend the same elementary school.  There are
 
enough of them so that they do not feel isolated and so that the teachers
 
and staff are able t
o learn about their needs and respond to them.  But there
 
are not
7 t
oo many in one school, so that the teachers' resources and energy
 
5
re not overburdened and so that the Cambodian children benefit from close

contact with American children of other cultures.
 Cluster housing maximizes
 
the advantages and minimizes the disadvantages of the less deliberate refugee
 
settlement patterns which prevail in other parts of Houston.
 In Yani KEO's
 
words, it is intended in large part to help preserve the culture, especially
 
for the young and the old, and to minimize problems with culture shock.
 
Friends protect one another, and in an emergency, "they know how to help each
 
other"
 (KEO, C1OA-110).
 Cluster housing is especially desirable for widows
 
with families, many of whom could not even have come to the U
.S. without
 
cluster housing available to them.
 
The Khmer Village is the prototype of cluster housing, and the general
 
description (
if not the particular history) applies as well to the three
 
other sites Yani KEO has established elsewhere in Houston.
 The twenty-three
 
houses had been built as low-rent housing in the '
60s, but had not been very
 
successful.  As described by Yani KEO's colleague, Charles THOMAS*,  the
 
renters "became disenchanted and as the landlord phased out that program with
 
the low rent agency,  they would just damage the place, dilapidate it,  tear
 
it up so badly the landlord got a little disappointed and then never bothered
 
about trying to fix the place up and rerent it again.
 That's how we were
 
able to get this place" (THOMAS, C1OA-220).
 Part of the arrangement
 
negotiated with the landlord was that the twenty-third house was provided
 
rent-free to be used as a school.
 They pay only for utilities and (
donated)
 
furnishings for that building.
 Their first task was to make the structures
 
habitable, since when they took over they were just shells: t
ithe brick
 
walls were still there and that was the extent of it" (
THOMAS, ClOA-212).

The first to move in, in February 1981, were a few families that had been
 
living elsewhere in Houston:  "I chose the ones that had low incomes, large
 
families, family problems  Lr were living in bad neighborhoods]"  (KEO,
 
C1OA-267).
 Then families started arriving from Thailand and the Philippines
 
who were specifically intended for cluster housing (
such as those with
 
widowed mothers).
 
The ideal cluster involves some newly arrived refugees and some who have
 
been in the U
.S. for a longer time--up to two years--but not those who arrived
 
in 1975 or soon after.
 "We're trying to put them together based on their
 
background,  their experience,  their economic status..." (
THOMAS, C1OA-365).
 
Those who have been here for several years (more than four) usually have
 
jobs,  cars, and good English skills, and they can manage well in more expensive
 
(
and more remote) housing.
 They would be out of step with someone who had
 
just arrived, and perhaps disinclined to assist them.  Yet it is helpful to
 
have some residents who are in their second or third year--those who have
 
cars, are employed, and can speak English enough to assist the newer ones.
 
Each cluster has a few of these key contacts, "anchor persons that we can
 
communicate back and- forth with" (
THOMAS, ClOA-395).
 Then, "when husband
 
and wife have a job I move them out, find a better place"--a larger apartment,
 
a rental home, or some have bought houses (KEO, ClOA-405).
 
For the residents of the Khmer Village, education is not constrained
 
within the four walls of the school building or the local public schools.
 
It ranges from orientation in practical matters such as how to count change
 
or use American fixtures and appliances,  to instruction in English and other
 
academic subjects,  to technical training in schools and on the job,  to
 
learning or improving literacy in Khmer, and to the informal transmission
 of

cultural traditions by neighbors and family members.
 
I concentrate on the programs encompassed within the
 
must necessarily be seen in the larger c
ontext.  The
 
While in this report
 
Village school, they
 
Village residents have
 
arrived there through various paths, with widely divergent skills and experiences.
 
No single program can meet all of their educational needs, and thus a range
 
of alternatives is available.  Underlying them all, however, lies the idea
 
of survival--providing the knowledge and skills which they need t
o survi ve
 
t
o flourish, and to prosper in their new homeland.
 
The classes that take place most frequently in the Village school building
 
are "survival English" classes for adults (and some older teenagers).  These
 
English as a Second Language classes (
ESL) are funded by the Houston Community
 
College system, which pays for two teachers, one American and one Cambodian.
 
The American teacher instructs the more advanced students, while Samphup KOU
 
(
Yani KEO's son-in--law) teaches those with no knowledge of English.  Some of
 
the refugees were fortunate enough to be able t
o begin learning English in the
 
camps in Thailand or the Philippines, but for many of them such classes were
 
unavailable.  The routine procedure recently has been for refugees to go from
 
Thailand t
o the Philippines for several months of orientation and ESL, but
 
some come directly from Thai camps where teaching English is sometimes
 
prohibited (
or where lessons must be paid for).
 In any case the ESL classes
 
in the camps are only for adults, while children are restricted to learning
 
Cambodian (
HUOT, C6A-
.
.400).
 
The ESL classes meet T
MDnday through Thursday evenings from around 6
 p M.
 
t
o 9 p
.m., and currently serve around thirty students.  Books are provided on
 
loan from Houston Community College, and students are drawn from the Village
 
and from a nearby house on Shreveport (
housing some twenty-five new arrivals).

Yani KEO also supervises ESL classes taught by volunteers at a church across
 
from her Weaver Street cluster.
 She herself teaches ESL several evenings a
 
week at 2800 Main Street, attended by those from the Schroeder Street cluster
 
and the Elgin neighborhood.  Advanced ESL for adults is offered at other
 
H
.C.C.  facilities, and some Village residents attend these classes or GJ.
 
classes also offered by H
.C.C.
 
The Village classroom is also used on an irregular basis for women's
 
classes.
 Sometimes assisted by volunteers from the YMCA, and more recently
 
by staffers from the Red Cross, Yani KEO teaches women's health and hygiene,
 
nutrition, child care, money management, driver education, rape prevention,
 
and birth control (KEO, C1OB-250).
 She is training Villager Madorom H
IJOT
 
(
see below) to take over these classes soon.
 
Turning finally to the classes in Cambodian literacy for children, we
 
must again backtrack for a moment.  Yani KEO,  the schoolteacher Madorom H
IJOT,
 
and the parents in the Village share a commitment to the maintenance of
 
Khmer fluency and literacy--a commitment most similar to that which probably
 
characterizes most ethnic language schools.  However, a more immediate
 
problem relates to the special circumstances which preceded the refugees'
 
arrival in the U.S.  Many of the refugee children (especially those born
 
after a certain date and those from rural areas) never attended school in
 
Cambodia, and most of these did not attend Cambodian schools in the Thai
 
refugee camps.
 In this respect,  it is necessary to recall that rural schooling
 
in most provinces effectively ended before 1970, and that after 1975 there
 
were no schools anywhere in Cambodia.
 Thus, Yani KEO explains,  "children
 
born in 1963-64 in rural areas have never been to school" (KEO, C1OB-010),
 
and those born anywhere after 1968 probably did not attend school.
 Those
 
Pro schan

S

from rural areas, even if their parents had some literacy, were rarely taught
 
to read or write during a period when sheer survival demanded constant work
 
and when education was an invitation to be murdered.
 Some educated parents,
 
for instance MOUK Phon and IN Man (
both of whom had taught school in Cambodia--
t
o adults and children respectively), managed to teach their children in Cambodia
 
or Thailand, but most children were not so lucky.
 In some of the Thai camps,
 
Cambodian-language schools were established, so that some children who had not
 
previously attended school were able to achieve at least partial literacy in
 
Khmer (see below).
 For those who never learned to read and write their own
 
language,  they are at an enormous disadvantage when trying to learn English,
 
and thus initial experience with reading and writing Cambodian is a primary
 
short-term goal for them.  Yani KEO explains:  "If you don't know the alphabet
 
you cannot go far.
 You don't have a strong root.  That's the Cambodian way
 
to say it,  '
strong root.'
 If you don't have that strong root, you cannot go
 
far.
 You will give up very soon" (KEO, C1OB-040).
 Literacy in Cambodian
 
helps them learn English in part because the very idea of literacy (that there
 
can be a correspondence between audial and visual signs) is important, and if
 
one sees how it works with one's own language, it is less mysterious when
 
learning a second language.  Yet more practically, Madoroin HUOT explains,
 
"I think that if the kid can understand Cambodian, knows how to write and
 
how to read Cambodian,  they can learn English fast because some words in
 
English they can write (i.e. transliterate] in Cambodian.
 If they don't
 
know how to read and write Cambodian, what can they do for English?  Not
 
at all" (HIJOT,  C6A-461),
 Consequently, the Cambodian classes that Yani
 
KEO taught last summer in the Village were limited to six children, aged
 
Proschan
 
8
 
7-15, who had never been to school,  in order to prepare them to enter the
 
American public school in the fall.
 However, review classes scheduled
 
intermittently throughout the
 
new (
illiterate) students and
 
their literacy.
 The increase
 
results from the fact that it
 
year, and this summer's classes,  include both
 
those who just need to maintain and improve
 
in the number and type of students served
 
is no longer necessary for Yani KEO herself
 
to teach all of the classes, because of the arrival in the village of
 
experienced teacher Madorom HUOT.
 
Madorom HUOT, widowed mother of three, arrived in the Khmer Village in
 
the fall of 1981.
 Her family had lived in the capital city of Phnom Penh
 
for many generations, and her father was a district mayor, so she and her
 
sister were encouraged to study.
 She graduated from high school and completed
 
one additional year of teacher training that qualified her to teach physical
 
sciences (
chemistry and physics) in high school.
 As a student during the last
 
years of the French protectorate, she studied French throughout her schooling,
 
and studied English for five years.  When she started teaching science in
 
1966, the textbooks were in French and classes were conducted in Cambodian.
 
A government translation project had managed to produce Cambodian texts for
 
the first eleven grades before it terminated in 1975, so that her later
 
teaching usually involved Cambodian-language textbooks.  Madorom HUOT fled
 
Phnom Penh on April 22, 1975, and for the next four years "worked like a
 
farmer" under the Pol Pot regime.
 Escaping finally from Cambodia in November,
 
1979, she eventually made it to Mairut Camp in Thailand, where she and three
 
other Cambodian teachers established a primary school of twelve classrooms.
 
She became principal after the first principal emigrated to New Zealand, and
 
under her direction the school grew to twenty classrooms and a staff of about
 
S
 
Pro schan
 
9
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
fifty people.
 The camp school taught Cambodian, math, health, physical
 
education, dance, and music.
 U.N. authorities wanted them to teach history
 
but they declined; she wanted to teach English and French but was prevented
 
from doing so by Thai and U
.N. officials, whose official policy was that
 
refugees were being prepared for repatriation to Cambodia rather than emigration
 
to the U
.S. or France.
 
Yani KEO describes some of Madorom HUOT's activities now that she has
 
come to the U
.S.: "Right now she's teaching Cambodian, she's helping me with
 
the women's program, and volunteers at [Terrell MiddleJ school where we don't
 
have any Cambodian aides or teachers or translators.
 She goes to school in
 
the morning to prepare her G
.E ID., and she comes back, goes to the public
 
school to help"  (KEO, ClOA-305).  Her work during the school year at Terrell
 
Middle School is voluntary and uncompensated.
 In addition, she tutors her
 
own children in order to see that they do not fall too far behind Americans
 
of the same age.
 For Madorom H
TJOT has made a decision that illustrates the
 
dilemma that confronts many Cambodian parents.
 She decided, with the advice
 
and encouragement of Yani KEO,  to start her eleven-year old daughter in the
 
second grade instead of the sixth grade.
 "I want her to understand more
 
English.  And I will teach her the math.  When she's able to understand
 
English, I don't worry about [her catching up inj math.
 I don't want her
 
to stay a long time in elementary school, but if I put her in junior high
 
she can't understand at all--even in math" (HIJOT, C6B-225).
 She shares
 
the expectation enunciated by Yani KEO:  "I had experience when I was teaching
 
in 1976, some students that were put in second grade,  third grade, but they
 
can skip.
 When they get the English, they catch up like this" (KEO, ClOB-076
 
This problem points out another valuable benefit of the Cambodian lessons
 
Proschan
 
10
 
in the Village: students who are embarrassed or uncomfortable in the
 
public school, who feel lost or too old,  can gain a feeling of pride and
 
accomplishment in the Cambodian classes.  The Village school offers a haven
 
in which they can feel productive, to offset the alienation they sometimes
 
experience in the American schools despite the best efforts of concerned
 
American teachers.  Yani KEO notes, "When they go back home they say,
 
'
I know how to write in Cambodian "(KEO,C1OB-440).
 
These immediate benefits of the Village school (
introducing literacy,
 
permitting transliteration, and encouraging students) are especially important
 
and unusual because of the personal biographies of the refugee children and
 
the particular circumstances of their forced flight from their homeland.
 
The longrange goals and benefits of the school fit more closely with what
 
we expect of ethnic language schools, and it is to those longrange goals that
 
I now turn.
 It is these distant goals, of preserving and maintaining their
 
language and culture, that are cited most often by parents in explaining
 
why they teach their children Cambodian and send them to the Village school.
 
Even through the filter of translation, the explanations are compelling.
 
CHUNG Huon states that if his children asked him why study Cambodian, "He
 
would explain to them why they have to learn Cambodian.
 He loves his
 
country so he'd like his children to learn Cambodian" (
CHTJNG, C12A-178).
 
And musician MOIJK Phon explains why his daughter is eager to learn Khmer:
 
"She wants to learn all languages--Cambodian, English.
 She is a Cambodian
 
so she has to learn Cambodian.
 LMoreover,7 the father knows about music
 
so the daughter has t
o learn about music" (MOIJK, C7A-450).
 
Seen from this broader perspective of cultural preservation, another
 
advantage of the cluster housing is evident: within the Village, all of the
 
Proschan
 
11
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
children are fluent in spoken Cambodian, even if they are not literate.
 
Yani RED explains that sometimes "these children forget what they were
 
before.
 I have experience.  The children who came in '
75-76 don't speak
 
Cambodian anymore and they don't dance Cambodian dance" (
KEO, ClOB-267).
 
Within the Village, perpetuation of the spoken language is assured, and
 
instruction in the written language acts to validate it and encourage the
 
students to want to remember it, even after they leave for other housing.
 
Nevertheless, it should not be assumed that all of the children are eager
 
to learn Cambodian.
 Children resist the Cambodian lessons because they
 
are school, and children everywhere have always disliked school.  Madorom
 
HUOT says, "If the parents say,  '
Go to school and study something,' the
 
kids don't want to .
... I have to force sometimes my children too, but the
 
older Cones are] not difficult for me to force them, but the small one I
 
have to tell him all the time, everyday,  to learn, learn English, learn
 
Cambodian..." (HT
.JOT, C6B-485).
 
Charles THOMAS recounts an anecdote that demonstrates this resistance
 
and rejection on the part of some young Cambodians.  Language is the keystone
 
of the cultural edifice that the school and Village are dedicated to preserving,
 
because it is the most vital link between the young Cambodians and their
 
families and elders:
 "One Sunday Yani and I were over at the Village...
 
and this mother c a
me in with her two little children raged 5 and 7].  And
 
the mother could not speak any English at all, and the two little children
 
spoke English and they were being kept by this family at the Lutheran Church
 
and they were very rude to the mother.
 So the mother was crying and she
 
brought them to Yani for Yani to help her work with them.
 So I said to Yani,
 
'
What is the problem?' She said,  '
Well,  it's a very simple problem,  that the
 
Pro schan
 
12
 
children have outgrown the mother, and there's the problem.
 She can't
 
communicate, they don't speak Cambodian and she doesn't speak English.
 They
 
speak English and they don't speak Cambodian.' So I said to her,  '
Yani, it's
 
a shame but we always expect children to outgrow the parents, but when they're
 
this age we don't expect that to happen because when they're young they become
 
unmanageable.'
 So she said,  'Well, I don't know, we have to do something about
 
it.
, (
.
..J We want primarily to make sure that the culture--at least some of th
 
culture,  the fine arts and so forth--are passed on from one generation to
 
the other.... I said,  '
Now let's talk about how are these cultures passed on?
 
Are
. they passed on by elders in the family?  Or are they handed down through
 
religion?  There must be some organization for maintenance of these things to
 
continue
, to exist'" (THOMAS, ClOB-295).
 The Cambodian lessons in the Village
 
school are central to the endeavor of tr nsuiitting cultural knowledge, and
 
language is the most crucial connector, but that does not exhaust the efforts
 
toward cultural preservation.
 THOMAS
. continues:
 "What we're doing now is we're
 
using the adults, as often as we possibly can, we have affairs within the Village,
 
and it brings Cambodians from all over the city--outside and within the Village--
and there we demonstrate cultural things--dance, games, singing, and even, to
 
some extent, religion —to try and keep the younger people in touch with what
 
their ancestral background and what their cultural past was" (THOMAS, C1OB-295).
 
Yani KEO cites the New Year celebration which took place on April 24, 1982
 
as an example:  "The aged people they are very happy to see the games,  like at
 
the New Year, we have the games that they used to play.
 Because the children
 
don't care, but the parents care" (KEO, ClOB-379).
 
It becomes clear that formal training in literacy is the keystone of the
 
cultural preservation efforts organized by Yani KEO, but it is equally clear
 
S
 
S
 
Pros chan
 
13
 
S
 
S
 
0
 
that the keystone does not hang unsupported in mid-air.
 Instead it is held up
 
by an  arch of formal and informal programs by which Cambodian children are
 
educated in their rich traditions.  And the keystone in turn serves as the
 
foundation upon which future programs will be based.
 Thus Yani KEO dreams
 
of having the Villagers publish a Cambodian-language magazine or newspaper
 
(
C1OA-084), perhaps not unlike the Foxfire publications.
 Charles THOMAS
 
explains:  "We re thinking about developing, if we can, a larger type of
 
complex that will have more than twenty-three houses and within that will
 
have some shops that will cater to them and their needs, and of course it will
 
give them the kinds of opportunities to express, to train, and also develop
 
among themselves" (THOMAS, ClOB-355).  And Yani KEO would like to teach
 
Cambodian literacy to refugees elsewhere in the city, some of whom have
 
already asked if they could enroll their children at the Village school.
 
"In the future, my plan is that I will talk to the fpublic7 school,  to
 
teach them at school, like they teach Spanish.
 If they teach Spanish, why
 
don't they speak the other languages?" (KEO, C1OB-285).  '
No one who knows
 
Yani KEO s drive and commitment, her inexhaustible energy and her simple
 
eloquence, would doubt that her dream will come true, just as her visions
 
of cluster housing and a school in which to teach Cambodian have already
 
been realized.

PART II
 
S
 
The foregoing has been a report on the school and the Village, and what
 
follows is more in the nature of a report on the research.  As is by now
 
evident to readers familiar with the Folklife Center's project and familiar
 
with better-known models of ethnic language schools,  the Khmer Village school
 
is atypical, and thus my research has perforce taken me over different paths
 
than other researchers.
 The immediately obvious fact is that this is a
 
school in the birthing, and not one with a long history or established
 
traditions.
 It is also less stable, less established, and less institutionalized
 
than many of the schools in the Folkitfe Center survey.
 Often, no boundary
 
can be drawn between activities that are properly the school's and other
 
activities undertaken by Yani KEO —no board of directors or fiscal officer
 
is around to say what is an official school project and what isn't.
 Many
 
of the questions posed in the instructions and guidelines from the AFC were
 
simply inapplicable to this school.
 However,  the particular circumstances
 
by which. these refugees arrived in Houston imposed an additional set of
 
questions and problems to be investigated, some of which are included in the
 
report but others of which are not.
 I have endeavored, both in the research
 
and in the report, to keep the school and the activities within its walls at
 
the center of my interest, but at the same time I needed to look back in time
 
and space to these people's former lives, and to look around me, in the present,
 
at their total educational opportunities.
 Let me turn now to those topics.
 
In talking to Villagers, both in formal interviews and in informal
 
conversations,  I found it easy to get answers on two topics:  what their
 
education had consisted of in Cambodia and what educational activities they
 
S
 
i
s
 
Proschan
 
15
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
were pursuing here at present.
 In fact, a perfect conversation opener was
 
"Where did you learn English?" or "What grade are you in?"  Most of the
 
adult men, and fewer of the adult women, had attended enough school to have
 
at least some literacy in Cambodian.
 Schools at home were of two types:
 
the wat (pagoda) school, sponsored and funded by the Buddhist wat (
pagoda),
 
but usually taught by lay persons and teaching secular subjects, and the
 
public schools.
 Evidently, curriculum covered in the two types of schools
 
overlapped, although it was perhaps more standardized and uniform in the
 
public schools.
 Then, as now, schooling might have to be sacrificed if a
 
child had to support a family.  Thus, MOUK Phon was forced to withdraw from
 
school when his parents and older brother died, and some of the older teenagers
 
now, who would perhaps benefit greatly from continued schooling, must instead
 
seek work.
 This problem is especially pronounced for those in their twenties
 
who would like to attend college, but who cannot because their work demands
 
too much time.  As to the education of women, my impression is that most
 
urban girls and many rural girls had access to education, but the older a
 
woman is the less likely it is that she went to school. These women are
 
nevertheless staunch in their conviction that their daughters should attend
 
school and that it is just as important that they learn as that their brothers
 
do.
 Except for Yani KEO, who had attended college in France, none of the
 
people I interviewed had attended college, although Madorom HUOT had attended
 
teacher training.
 This is not surprising considering that most of the Village
 
residents were farmers or soldiers from rural areas, and that those refugees
 
with advanced education were more likely to have immigrated to the U
.S. before
 
now, leaving the ones without family ties or education to immigrate later.
 
By fortuitous circumstance,  the fathers of two of the families in the
 
Village who I chose to interview (and whose children attend the Cambodian
 
Proschan
 
16
 
lessons) had been teachers in Cambodia.
 IN Man had taught French and
 
Cambodian at the elementary school level for several years until he joined
 
the army, and MOUK Phon had taught evening literacy classes to adults.
 
Perhaps "fortuitous circumstance" is not a proper characterization, but my
 
point is that no one arranged for me to interview them or preselected them
 
for me.
 However,  the more I got to know the Villagers, the more it became
 
apparent that the same faces were showing up again and again in my photos,
 
and that the kids who helped clean up the Village for the New Year,  for
 
example, were the same ones who attended the school, and that their parents
 
were the ones I had also seen actively engaged in "civic" activities.  A
 
few families seemed to be the ones who valued education and community most
 
highly, and thus among the 150 residents there are perhaps thirty, drawn from
 
a half-dozen families, who figure repeatedly in my documentation and interviews.
 
I have mentioned most of the American educational opportunities in
 
which Villagers are engaged, with the exception of the Gary Job Corps Center,
 
a residential technical institute in San Marcos.
 Gary Job Corps seems to
 
be well suited especially to one group of people--those from fifteen to twenty
 
years old who never attended school in Cambodia.  Were they to enroll in a public
 
high school or junior high,  they would be lost if placed with Americans of
 
their own age, or it would take them forever to finish if they started at
 
a lower grade than their age group.  And,  these are kids whose parents may
 
perceive them as being of employable age, who should be contributing to the
 
family economically instead of going to school.
 Gary Job Corps provides both
 
technical training and academic instruction, including intensive English for
 
foreigners, and the students are lodged and fed without charge.  Thus, even
 
though they are not themselves contributing to the family's resources,  they
 
S
 
S
 
Pros chan
 
17
 
S
 
S
 
are at least not draining them. and moreover they are being prepared for
 
remunerative occupations.
 Girls can be admitted to Gary Job Corps anytime,
 
although boys must sometimes wait as long as a year, during which time they
 
attend public school and begin learning English.  When they do go to Gary
 
Job Corps,  they can make better progress than they would have
 
stayed in the public high school.
 
In looking backward and enquiring
 
confronted with the inevitable problem
 
if they had
 
into the Villagers' past lives,  I was
 
of the horrors through which most of
 
them have lived.  My approach was as delicate and tentative as possible, and
 
as long as we
. were talking about education it was relatively easy to avoid
 
painful topics, or once touched upon to move beyond them.
 However, I avoided
 
many of the customary questions of personal biography that I would have liked
 
to ask, or that I might ask in the future once I know them better.  When I
 
talk to a widow, for instance,  I don't feel inclined to interrogate her on
 
tape about the circumstances of her husband's death, and although such topics
 
came up many times in my informal conversations with people, I did not pursue
 
them in formal taped interviews.
 Likewise, with those whom I have known since
 
last year, and with whom I have discussed such topics, I did not want to drag
 
them over the coals about it again.
 By consequence,  the "Key Contributor"
 
forms are not as complete as could be desired--only living children are
 
listed, for example.
 
Another problem was
 
translator,
 It must be remembered that many of these people pride themselves
 
on their attempts to speak English at the same time that they apologize for
 
their inability.  When someone answered me in English,  I deemed it impolite
 
to ask them to elaborate in Khmer, although a translator was there who could
 
inherent in the situation of interviewing-with-a-
 
Proschan
 
18
 
assist.
 I felt that it demonstrated respect for their English abilities
 
to accept a tentative or incomplete response in English, rather than demanding
 
a fuller reply in Cambodian.  This was especially true when posing questions
 
to the children, who lost all of their brash self-confidence when the tape
 
recorder was turned on.
 Even if their English response was monosyllabic, I
 
was disinclined to make the implicit criticism of their abilities by suggesting
 
that they respond in Khmer.
 Of course, Madorom HUOT was there to act as
 
translator when they did not understand my question or when they chose to
 
respond in Khmer, but if they volunteered English I did not reject it.
 
NOUK Phon, for example, probably speaks better English than he was inclined
 
to demonstrate, but he felt very comfortable working through translation and
 
the two interviews with him worked very well.  This may also be a factor of
 
an individual interview versus group interviews--if I were to go back to the
 
families and interview one person at a time,  I would probably rely more on
 
translation and push the questioning further.
 For the initial interviews,
 
however, I think that the group approach was better —it represented less of
 
an imposition on the people and their time and hospitality.  That is, by
 
going into their homes and speaking with everyone who was there, I interfered
 
less with their ongoing activities than I would have if I had demanded
 
uninterrupted time with each person (imagining that such uninterrupted time
 
were even possible).
 In my logs of the taped interviews, I have reported
 
only the on-the-spot translations done by Madorom HUOT or Moni KOIJ.
 It would,
 
however, be productive to return to the salient portions of the tapes,
 
transcribe the Khmer responses, and then translate them in more detail, rather
 
than relying on the more summary on-the-spot translation.
 This would,
 
however, require additional payments to the translator (
I did pay Madorom HUOT
 
for the time she spent assisting with interviews).

A final word must be inserted on the proper use of quotations from the
 
taped interviews.
 In my tape logs,  transcriptions, and the quotes excerpted
 
in this report, I have frequently transcribed English statements in a way
 
that certain scholars might find improper.
 I have taken the liberty of
 
correcting the English words of my informants on occasion, but this has been
 
done neither casually nor carelessly.  After careful deliberation,  I have
 
taken this step with the following considerations in mind.
 First, in the
 
area of pronunciation, Khmer speakers characteristically do not release the
 
final sounds of words (as contrasted to American English-speakers who
 
frequently emphasize final phonemes, even to the point of exaggeratedly
 
releasing them into a schwa).  Additionally, certain of the final consonant
 
clusters that are common in English are difficult for Cambodians to pronounce.
 
This is especially true of the consonant clusters which serve in English as
 
verbal inflections or plural markers.  As an example, a Cambodian might not
 
distinguish in pronunciation between "look" and "looked", but this does not
 
mean that they are unaware of the difference or would not make the distinction
 
in writing or slow, careful speech.
 I have consequently conjugated verbs or
 
indicated plurals correctly wherever the meaning was unmistakable, in spite
 
of the pronunciation.  At the level of syntax, Cambodian does not inflect or
 
conjugate verbs for number or for tense (
past and future being indicated
 
sometimes by compound verbs but just as often not being indicated at all
 
except by context).
 I have consequently occasionally corrected the tense
 
of English verbs, or corrected person-number inflections, but again this has
 
been done only where the sense was unmistakable.
 Because the research and
 
the report are intended to communicate the ideas and intentions of the speakers,
 
and not to provide linguistic data,  I believe this procedure to be sound.
 
The tapes themselves are the final document should someone eventually wish
 
Proschan
 
20
 
to use them for linguistically oriented analyses, but for general informational
 
purposes the "corrected'  transcripts should be used.
 
Finally, I offer a few suggestions for continuing research.  As I have
 
remarked several times above, the Village school's instruction in Khmer
 
literacy can only be understood in light of the total range of formal and
 
informal educational institutions and channels by which cultural knowledge
 
is transmitted from old to young.
 If work were to continue in the Khmer
 
Village,  it should be designed to investigate that total range of activities.
 
That would include, for example, mothers "instructing" their daughters in
 
cooking (
conventional gender roles still apply for many tasks), or musician
 
NOUK Phon teaching younger Villagers to play traditional instruments.  The
 
first might be more amorphous and unstructured, while the second would likely
 
be more formal and regularized.  Research would include parents telling their
 
children the traditional heuristic tales of Judge Rabbit, or showing them how
 
t
o garden or harvest.  And,  it would involve more detailed observation of
 
children at the public schools, at Gary Job Corps, and adults at ESL classes.
 
In sum,  continued research would more profitably investigate "education
 
within an ethnic community" rather than an isolated "ethnic language school."
 
The school itself would surely figure centrally in any such research, but to
 
limit our curiosity to the physical boundaries of the school building's four
 
walls would be to constrain our possible understanding.

CAMBODIAN SCHOOL

Final Report by Frank Proschan
 
Near the intersection of U.S. Route 59 and Interstate 6
10 in
 
northeast Houston is a court of twenty-three houses known a
s the Khmer
 
Village, home for about 150 Cambodian-Americans. One of the two-bedroom
 
houses a

In that building, located at 6779 Bonita Street, adult
 
of the village learn English. In addition, women are
 
instructed in health and nutrition, while children study Cambodian
 
reading and writing. The story of the school is the story of the
 
r
emarkable community it serves and, in large part, the s
tory of one
 
remarkable woman.
 
Yani Rose Keo's nominal t
itle i

Catholic Charities of Houston, an organization which has actively
 
assisted Cambodian and other Indochinese refugees since 1
975. In fact,

On a typical day she might go

involving a Cambodian worker, teach

site to clear up a misunderstanding
 
an adult English-as-a-Second
 
-Language (ESL) class, settle a domestic dispute at one of her housing
 
sites, and then return home to hand stitch a traditional Cambodian
 
wedding dress. Nor i
s her work restricted to those refugees sponsored
 
2
 
by Catholic Charities; any Cambodian in need who calls on her will b
e
 
assisted,  t
o whatever extent possible. She is a modern-day Jane
 
Addams, motivated by an intense commitment to help her Cambodian
 
countryfolk become self-sufficient, productive, and happy in their new
 
homes.
 
The Khmer Village i
s the first Houston experiment in  "
cluster
 
housing" for Indochinese refugees. One of the common patterns of
 
immigrant settlement among recent refugees, especially those in large
 
cities, i
s to cluster in older neighborhoods and older apartment
 
complexes. Such a pattern of unplanned ghettoization has both
 
advantages and disadvantages which cannot be discussed adequately here.
 
The cluster housing designed by Yani Keo i
s different in important
 
respects from unplanned clustering. Cluster housing brings together
 
between thirty and two hundred members of one ethnic group in a
 
carefully prepared and planned manner. They all live in one place,
 
either in a complex of houses or garden apartments. The clusters create
 
islands o
f one ethnic group living within a larger community of another
 
ethnic group--in this case, blacks. Maintenance of critical mass allows
 
the residents of the cluster to gain the benefits of living together
 
with people like themselves, while simultaneously avoiding problems of
 
ghettoization. The cluster communities are relatively small and are
 
carefully spaced, so that no single neighborhood is saturated. For
 
example, all of the children at the village attend the same elementary
 
school. There are enough of them that they do not feel isolated and the
 
teachers and staff are able to learn about their needs and be
 
3
 
responsive. There are not so many in one school, however, that t
he
 
teachers'  resources and energies are overburdened, or that the
 
Cambodian children lose the benefit of close contact with American
 
children of other cultures.
 
Cluster housing maximizes the advantages and minimizes the
 
disadvantages of the less deliberate refugee settlement patterns
 
prevalent in other parts of Houston. In Yani Keo's view it i
s
 
to help preserve the culture, especially for the young and the old, and
 
to minimize problems with culture shock. Friends protect one another
 
and in an emergency,  "
they know how to help each other." (Keo,
 
ES82-FP-CIO, Side 1
, 1
10)  Cluster housing i
s especially desirable for
 
widows with families, many of whom could not even have come to the
 
United States without the support system inherent in the housing
 
pattern.
 
The Khmer Village i
s the prototype of cluster housing. Its general
 
description (if not the particular history) applies as well to the
 
three other sites Yani Keo has established elsewhere in Houston. The
 
twenty-three houses had been built as low-rent housing in the 1960s,
 
but had not been very successful. As Charles Thomas, a colleague of
 
Yani Keo's, explains, the renters  "became disenchanted, and as the
 
landlord phased out that program with the low-rent agency, they would
 
just damage the place, dilapidate it, tear it up so badly the landlord
 
got a little disappointed and then never bothered about trying to fix
 
the place up and re-rent it again. That's how we were able to get this
 
4
 
place." (
ES82-FP-CIO, Side 1
, 220)1 Part of the arrangement negotiated
 
with the landlord was that the twenty-third house was provided
 
rent-free to be used as a school;  they would pay only for utilities and
 
furnishings (later donated) for that building.
 
The first task was to make the s
tructures habitable, s
ince when
 
taken over,  "the brick walls were still there and that was the extent
 
of it," says Thomas. (ES82-FP-CIO, Side 1
, 2
12) In February 1981 a few
 
families that had been living elsewhere in Houston moved in.  "
I chose
 
the ones that had low incomes, large families, family problems,  f
or
 
were living in bad neighborhoods]," says Keo.  (E582-FP-C10, Side 1
,
 
267) Soon families specifically intended for cluster housing, such a
s
 
those with widowed mothers, started arriving from Thailand and the
 
Philippines.
 
The ideal cluster combines newly arrived r
efugees with others who
 
have been in the United States for up to two years, but not w
i
 
who arrived in 1975 or soon thereafter.  "We're trying to put
 
together based on their background, their experience,  their economic
 
status .
 .
 .
 ,
 "
 Thomas explains.  (
ES82-FP-c10, Side 1
, 365) Those who
 
have been here for more than four years usually have jobs, cars, and
 
good English skills;  they can manage well in more expensive (and more
 
remote) housing. They would be out of step with someone who had just
 
arrived, and perhaps disinclined to assist them. Yet it is helpful to
 
have some residents who are in their second or third year--those who
 
'Charles Thomas is personnel director for Standco Industries, a Houston
 
firm that employs about one hundred Cambodians and as many or more
 
Laotians and Vietnamese.
 
have cars, employment, and sufficient English t
o assist t
he newer
 
arrivals. Each cluster has a few key contacts, "anchor persons that we
 
can communicate back and forth with," notes Thomas. (
ES82-FP-CIO, Side
 
1
, 395) Then, adds Keo,  "when husband and wife have a job, I move them
 
out, find a better place." (
ES82-FP-ClO, S
ide 1
, 405) That may be a
 
larger apartment, a rental home, or even a purchased house.

classes are funded by the HoustcM
 
6
 
American and one Cambodian. The American teacher instructs the more
 
advanced students, while Samphup Kou (Yani Keo's son-in-law) teaches
 
those with no knowledge of English. Some of the refugees were fortunate
 
enough to be able to begin learning English in the camps in Thailand or
 
the Philippines, but for many of them such classes were unavailable.
 
The routine procedure recently has been for refugees to go from
 
Thailand t
o the Philippines for several months of orientation and ESL.
 
Some, however,  come directly from Thai camps where teaching English is
 
sometimes prohibited, or where lessons must be paid for. In any case,
 
the ESL classes in the camps are only for adults; children are
 
restricted to learning Cambodian.  (Huot, ES82-FP-C6, Side 1
, 400)
 
The ESL classes, currently serving some thirty students, meet
 
Monday through Thursday evenings from around 6
:00 P
.M.  to 9
:00 P
.M.
 
Books are provided on loan from Houston Community College. Students are
 
drawn from the village and from a nearby residence on Shreveport
 
Boulevard which houses some twenty-five new arrivals. Yani Keo also
 
supervises ESL classes taught by volunteers at a church across from her
 
Weaver Street cluster. In addition, several evenings a week she herself
 
teaches ESL classes at 2800 Main Street, attended by students from the
 
Schroeder Street cluster and the Elgin neighborhood. Advanced ESL for
 
adults i
s offered at other HCC facilities. Some village residents
 
attend General Educational Development (GED) classes, also offered by
 
HCC.

The village classroom i
s used on an irregular basis for women's
 
classes. Yani Keo teaches women's health and hygiene, nutrition, child
 
care, money management, driver education, rape prevention, and birth
 
control, sometimes assisted by volunteers from the YMCA and, more
 
recently, by staffers from the Red Cross.  (Keo, ES82-FP--CIO, Side 2
,
 
250) She i
s training villager Madorom Huot to take over these classes
 
soon.
 
Turning finally to the classes in Cambodian literacy for children,
 
we must again backtrack for a moment. Yani Keo, schoolteacher Madorom
 
I
-
Iuot, and the parents in the village share a commitment to t
he
 
maintenance of Khmer fluency and literacy--a couimitment similar t
o th
 
which characterizes many ethnic language schools. A more immediate
 
problem, however, relates to the special circumstances which preceded
 
the refugees' arrival in the United States. Many of the refugee
 
children (especially those born after a certain date and those from
 
rural areas) never attended school in Cambodia. Rural schooling in most
 
Cambodian provinces effectively ended before 1970;  after 1975 there
 
were no schools anywhere in Cambodia. As Keo explains, children born in
 
1963-64 in rural areas have never been to school (ES82-FP-c10, Side
 
2
, 010), and those born anywhere in the country after 1
968 probably did
 
not attend school. Those from rural areas, even if their parents had
 
some literacy, were rarely taught to read or write during a period when
 
sheer survival demanded constant work and education was an invitation
 
to be murdered. Some educated parents, for instance Mouk Phon and In
 
8
 
Man (both of whom had taught school in Cambodia), managed t
o t
each
 
their children in Cambodia or Thailand; most children were not so
 
lucky.
 
Cambodian language schools were established in some of t
he Thai
 
camps, so some children who had not previously attended school were
 
able to achieve at least partial literacy in Khmer. Those who never
 
learned t
o read and write their own language are at an enormous
 
disadvantage when trying to learn English. Therefore, initial
 
experience with reading and writing Cambodian i
s a primary short-term
 
goal for them.  "
If you don't know the alphabet you cannot go far," says
 
Yani Keo.  "You don't have a strong root. That's the Cambodian way to
 
say it,  '
strong root.' If you don't have that strong root, you cannot
 
go far. You will give up very soon." (ES82-FP-C1O, Side 2
, 040)
 
Literacy in Cambodian helps these students learn English, in part
 
because the very idea of literacy (that there can be a correspondence
 
between audio and visual signs) i
s important. If one sees how i
t works
 
with one's own language, it is far less mysterious when learning a
 
second language. More practically, as Madorom i
luot explains,  "
I think
 
that i
f the kid can understand Cambodian, knows how to write and how to
 
read Cambodian, they can learn English fast because some words in
 
English they can write [
i.e., transliterate]  in Cambodian. If they
 
don't know how to read and write Cambodian, what can they do for
 
English? Not at all." (ES82-FP-C6, Side 1
, 461)

Consequently,  the Cambodian classes that Yani Keo taught in the
 
village during the summer of 1981 were limited to six children, aged
 
seven t
o fifteen, who had never been to school; the classes were t
o
 
prepare them to enter the American public school in the fall. Review
 
classes are scheduled intermittently throughout the year, however. The
 
1
982 summer classes included both new (illiterate) students and those
 
who just need to maintain and improve their literacy. There has been an
 
increase in the number and type of students served by such classes
 
because i
t i
s no longer necessary for Yani Keo herself to t
each all of
 
them with the arrival in the village of the experienced teacher
 
Madorom Huot.
 
The classroom sessions that I observed featured lessons drawn from
 
textbooks prepared in the late 1960s by the Buddhist Institute in Phnom
 
Penh. This set of three graded books was used throughout the country
 
for language instruction. The series was reprinted recently by the
 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to be used in the refugee
 
camps in Thailand. It is not uncommon for these books to be highly
 
prized by those in the camps--I have seen families arriving in the
 
United States who brought with them a few pounds of rice, perhaps some
 
t
reasured family photographs, and copies of their Khmer and beginning
 
English schoolbooks.

The younger students used the f
irst book. The lesson I observed
 
involved learning to recognize letter shapes, with students drilled to
 
pronounce the letters correctly or to step to the blackboard to write
 
the letters that Madorom Huot pronounced. The older class used the
 
third-level book for a more complicated lesson on spelling.
 
The Cambodian writing system overlays an Indic-derived script on a
 
sound system that diverges from those Indian languages for which the
 
orthography is better suited. Consequently, as with English, there are
 
various ways to write the same combination of sounds, and complicated
 
spelling rules determine why one combination of letters is preferable
 
to another. Madorom Huot copied a long text onto the blackboard with
 
empty spaces awaiting missing words. She would then read the proper
 
word and students would respond with the proper spelling.
 
Madorom Huot, a widowed mother of three, arrived in the Khmer
 
Village in the fall of 1
981. Her family had lived in the capital c
ity
 
of Phnom Penh for many generations. Her father was a district mayor, so
 
she and her sister were encouraged to study.  She graduated from high
 
school and completed one additional year of teacher training that
 
qualified her to teach physical sciences (chemistry and physics) at
 
the high school level. As a student during the last years of the French
 
protectorate, she studied French throughout her schooling and English
 
for five years. When she herself started teaching science in 1966 the
 
textbooks were in French and classes were conducted in Cambodian. A
 
government translation project managed to produce Cambodian texts for
 
1
1
 
the first eleven grades before it was t
erminated in 1
975, h
owever, so
 
that her later teaching usually relied upon Cambodian-language
 
textbooks.
 
Madorom Nuot fled Phnom Penh on April 22,  1
975. For the next four
 
years she "worked like a farmer" under the Pol Pot regime. Escaping
 
from Cambodia finally in November 1979, she eventually made her way t
o
 
Mairut Camp in Thailand, where she and three other Cambodian teachers
 
established a primary school of twelve classrooms. She became principn
 
after the first principal emigrated to New Zealand. Under her directi
 
the school grew to twenty classrooms and a staff of about fifty people.
 
The camp school taught Cambodian, math, health, physical education,
 
dance, and music. United Nations authorities wanted them to t
each
 
history, but they declined. I
-
{uot wanted to teach English and French,
 
but was prevented from doing so by Thai and United Nations officials;
 
their official policy was that refugees were being prepared for
 
repatriation to Cambodia rather than emigration t
o the United States
 
or France.
 
Yani Keo describes some of Madorom Huot's activities now that she
 
has come to this country as follows:  "Right now she's teaching
 
Cambodian, she's helping me with the women's program, and volunteers at
 
[
Terrell Middle] schools, where we don't have any Cambodian aids, or
 
teachers, or translators. She goes to school in the morning t
o prepare
 
her GED and comes back,  [
then] goes t
o the public school to help."

voluntary. In addition, she tutors her own  children to insure that they
 
do not fall too far behind Americans of the same age. For Madorom Huot
 
has made a decision that illustrates the dilemma that confronts many
 
Cambodian parents: she decided, with the advice and encouragement of
 
Yani Keo,  to start her eleven-year-old daughter in the second grade
 
instead of the sixth grade.  "
I want her to understand more English, and
 
I will teach her the math. When she's able to understand English, I
 
don't worry about [her catching up in] math. I don't want her to stay a
 
long time in elementary school, but i
f I put her in junior high, she
 
can't understand at all--even math." (Huot, ES82-FP-C6, Side 2
, 225)
 
She shares the expectation expressed by Yani Keo,  "
I had experience
 
when I was teaching in 1976;  some students were put in second grade,
 
third grade, but they can skip. When they get the English, they catch
 
up like this." (ES82-FP-CIO, Side 2
, 076)
 
The problem of students' having t
o be placed in lower public
 
school grades points out another valuable benefit of the Cambodian
 
lessons in the village:  students who are embarrassed or uncomfortable
 
in the public school, who feel lost or too old, can gain a feeling of
 
pride and accomplishment in the Cambodian classes. The village school
 
offers a haven in which they can feel productive, to offset the
 
alienation they sometimes experience in the American schools, despite
 
the best efforts of concerned American teachers. Yani Keo notes,  "When
 
they go back home they say,  '
I know how to write in
 
Cambodian!' "
(E582-FP-C10, Side 2
, 440)

Another American educational system i
s also attended by a number
 
of Cambodian adolescents as an alternative to local public high
 
schools--the Gary Job Corps Center, a residential, technical institute
 
in San Marcos, Texas. Gary Job Crops seems to be especially well suited
 
to young people from fifteen to twenty years old who never a
ttended
 
school in Cambodia. Were they to enroll in a public high school or
 
junior high they would be lost, i
f placed with Americans of their own
 
age, or it would take them forever to finish, i
f they started at a
 
lower grade than their age group. Also, these are young people whom
 
parents may perceive to be of employable age, capable of
 
contributing to the family economically instead of going to school.
 
Gary Job Corps provides both technical training and academic
 
instruction, including intensive English for foreigners. The
 
students are lodged and fed without charge. Thus, even though they are
 
not themselves contributing to the family's resources, they are at
 
least not draining them. Moreover, they are being prepared for
 
remunerative occupations. Girls can be admitted to Gary Job Corps
 
anytime. Boys must sometimes wait as long as a year, during which time
 
they attend public school and begin to learn English. When they do go
 
to Gary Job Crops, they can often make better progress than they would
 
have i
f they had stayed in the public high school.
 
The immediate benefits of the village school —introducing
 
literacy, permitting transliteration, and giving students
 
encouragement —are especially important and unusual because of the
 
personal biographies of the refugee children and the particular
 
circumstances of their forced flight from their homeland. Th

Most of the adult men and fewer of the adult women had attended
 
enough school to have at least some literacy in Khmer.  Schools at home
 
were of two types: the wat (pagoda) school, sponsored by the Buddhist
 
Church but
 
the public
 
of school
 
uniform in
 
sacrificed
 
forced t
o
 
usually offering secular subjects taught by lay persons, and
 
schools. Evidently, the curricula covered in the two types
 
overlapped, although it was perhaps more standardized and
 
the public schools. Then as now, schooling might have t
o be
 
if a child had to help support a family. Mouk Phon was
 
withdraw from school when his parents and older brother died.
 
Some of the older teenagers here, who would perhaps benefit
 
greatly from continued schooling, must also seek work instead. The
 
problem of priorities i
s especially pronounced for those in thei
 
twenties who would like to attend college, but who cannot because their
 
work demands too much t
ime.
 
As to
 
girls and
 
woman, the
 
the education of women, my impression is that most urban
 
many rural girls had access to education; but the older a
 
less likely it is that she went to school. These women are
 
nevertheless staunch in their conviction that their daughters should
 
attend school and that it i
s just as important that they learn a
s that
 
their brothers do. Except for Yani Keo, who attended college in France,
 
none of the people I interviewed had attended college. Madorom Huot did
 
receive a year of teacher training, however.

Lack of higher education among village residents i
s not
 
surprising,  considering the fact that most of them were farmers or
 
soldiers from rural areas. Refugees with advanced education are more
 
likely to have been among the first to immigrate to the United States,
 
leaving the ones without education or family t
ies with other United
 
States residents to immigrate later.
 
The other attitude concerning the value of education held by many
 
of the parents with whom I spoke appears to emanate from their sense of
 
civic and social responsibility. The parents demonstrate a
 
responsibility to their neighbors in the village but also, more
 
broadly, to Cambodian culture as a whole. In Man taught French and
 
Cambodian at the elementary school level for several years, until he
 
joined the army; he then resumed teaching in the refugee camp. Prior to
 
1975 Mouk Phon taught Khmer adult literacy classes for several hours
 
each evening and then gave music lessons until late at night. These
 
same people and their families helped sweep the village for the New
 
Year's celebration which took place on April 24, 1982, built the stage
 
for the band, and served refreshments. Although they are no longer able
 
to serve their homeland, they are able to help preserve i
ts culture.
 
Further, although they are discouraged about their own ability to
 
contribute productively to American society, they want to be sure that
 
their children gain the skills necessary to allow them to be productive
 
citizens. The broader commitment to the preservation of Cambodian
 
culture i
s encouraged by the cluster housing arrangement of the village
 
itself
 
1
7
 
Within the village all of the children are fluent in spoken
 
Cambodian, even if they are not all literate. Yani Keo explains that
 
sometimes "
these children forget what they were before.  I have
 
experience. The children who came in '
75-'76 don't speak Cambodian
 
anymore, and they don't dance Cambodian dance." (ES82-FP-C10, Side 2
,
 
267) Perpetuation of the spoken language is assured through the village
 
experience. Instruction in the written language acts to validate it and
 
encourage the students to want to remember it, even after they leave
 
for other housing. Nevertheless, it should not be assumed that all of
 
the children are eager to learn Cambodian. Children resist the
 
Cambodian lessons because they represent school, and
 
everywhere have always disliked school. Madorom Huot
 
parents say,  '
Go to school and study something,' the
 
to.

children
 
says,

• I have to force, sometimes, my children, too. But the older
 
the small one, I
 
learn English, learn
 
Language is the foundation of the cultural edifice that the
 
school and village are dedicated to preserving because it i
s the most
 
vital link between the young Cambodians and their families and elders.
 
Charles Thomas recounts an anecdote that demonstrates the resistance
 
and rejection that exists on the part of some young Cambodians:
 
One Sunday Yani and I were over at the village .
 •
 
and this mother came in with her two little children
 
[
aged 5 and 7
].  And the mother could not speak any
 
English at all, and the two little children spoke
 
English. And they were being kept by this family at the
 
Lutheran Church. And they were rude to the mother, so
 
the mother was crying. And she brought them to Yani for
 
1
8
 
Yani to help her work with them.  So I said to Yani,
 
"
What is the problem?" She said,  "
Well, it's a very
 
simple problem, that the children have outgrown the
 
mother, and there's the problem. She can't
 
communicate--they don't speak Cambodian and she doesn't
 
speak English. They speak English and they don't speak
 
Cambodian." So I said to her,  "
Yani, it's a shame, but
 
we always expect children to outgrow the parents; but
 
when they're this age, we don't expect that to happen,
 
because when they're young they become unmanageable.'
 
(
ES82-FP-CIO, Side 2
, 295)
 
The Cambodian lessons in the village school are central to the
 
endeavor of transmitting cultural knowledge, and language is the most
 
crucial connector; but the classes do not exhaust the efforts toward
 
cultural preservation. Thomas amplifies on this point:  "What we're
 
doing now is we're using the adults as often as we possibly can. We
 
have affairs within the village, and it brings Cambodians from all over
 
the city, outside and within the village. And there we demonstrate
 
cultural things —dance, games, singing, and even, to some extent,
 
religion--to try and keep the younger people in touch with what their
 
ancestral background and what their cultural past was." (ES82-FP-C1O,
 
Side 2
, 295) Yani Keo cites the New Year's celebration as an example
 
of the cultural reinforcement offered by events at which Cambodians
 
gather.  "
The aged people, they are very happy to see the games, like at
 
the New Year. We have the games that they used to play, because the
 
children don't care, but the parents care. (ES82-FP-CIO, Side 2
, 379)

Formal training in literacy i
s the keystone of the cultural
 
preservation efforts organized by Yani Keo; but that keystone does not
 
hang unsupported in midair. It is held up by an arch of formal and
 
informal programs by which Cambodian children are educated in their
 
r
ich traditions.
 
The keystone in turn serves as the foundation upon which future
 
programs will be based. For instance, Keo dreams of having the
 
villagers publish a Cambodian-language magazine or newspaper.
 
(ES82-FP-C10,  Side 1
, 084) Charles Thomas adds,  "
We're thinking about
 
developing, if we can, a larger type of complex that will have more
 
than twenty-three houses. And within that [we] will have some shops
 
that will cater to them and their needs, and, of course, it will give
 
them the kinds of opportunities [needed]  to express,  to train, and also
 
develop among themselves." (ES82-FP-C1O, Side 2
, 355) Keo w
 
like to teach Cambodian literacy to refugees elsewhere in t
 
some of whom have already asked if they could enroll their children at
 
the village school.  "
In the future my plan is that I will talk to the
 
[
public] school, to t
each them at school, like they teach Spanish. If
 
they teach Spanish, why don't they speak the other languages?"
 
(
ES82-FP-CIO, Side 2
, 285) No one who knows Yani Keo's drive and
 
commitment, her inexhaustible energy, and her simple eloquence would
 
doubt that her dream will come true, just as her visions of cluster
 
housing and a school in which to teach Cambodian have already been
 
realized.

The foregoing has been a report on the school and the village.
 
What follows is more in the nature of a report on the research. The
 
Khmer Village school is a school in the birthing, not one with a long
 
history or established traditions. It is less stable, less established,
 
and less institutionalized than many other ethnic language schools.
 
Often, no boundary can be drawn between activities that are properl
 
the school's and other activities undertaken by Yani Keo;  no board of
 
directors or fiscal officer is around to say what is an official school
 
project and what is not. Many of the questions posed in the
 
instructions and guidelines provided by the American Folklife Center
 
were simply inapplicable to this school. In addition,  the particular
 
circumstances by which these refugees arrived in Houston imposed an
 
additional set of questions and problems to be investigated, some of
 
which are included in the report but others of which are not. I have
 
endeavored, both in the research and in the report, to keep the school
 
and the activities within its walls at the center of my interest. At
 
the same time I needed to look back in time and place to these people's
 
former lives and at their total educational opportunities t
oday.
 
In talking to villagers, both in formal interviews and in informal
 
conversations, I found it easy to get answers on two topics: what their
 
education had consisted of in Cambodia and what educational activities
 
they were pursuing here at present. In fact, a perfect conversation
 
opener was "Where did you learn English?" or "What grade are you in?"
 
2
1
 
When inquiring into the villagers' past lives, I was confronted with
 
the inevitable problem of the horrors most of them had experienced. My
 
approach was as delicate and tentative as possible. As long a
s we were
 
talking about education, it was relatively easy t
o avoid painful
 
t
opics, or, once touched upon, to move beyond them. I avoided many of
 
OO  C
s
 )
U
]ory questions of personal biography that I would have liked
 
Pat I might ask in the future, once I know them better.
 
When I talked to a widow, for instance, I did not feel inclined to
 
interrogate her on t
ape about the circumstances of her husband's death.
 
A
1though such topics came up many times in my informal conversations
 
with people, I did not pursue them in formal taped interviews.
 
ikewise, with those whom I have known since last year and with whom I
 
ave discussed such topics, I did not want to cause them to reiterate
 
painful  stories. As a consequence, the "Key Contributor" forms are not
 
a
s c
omplete as might be desired--only living children are l
isted, for
 
caamp l
e
 
'ather  crcb
m  cis  i nerent  H :e

 t
 ntor:ie wi
p  a
 
translator. It must be remembered that many of these people pride
 
emselves on their attempts to speak English, at the same t
ime that
 
L
ey apologize for their inability. When someone answered me in
 
i
glish, I deemed it impolite to ask them to elaborate in Khmer,
 
though a translator was there who could assist. I felt that i
t
 
oct for their English abilities to accept a t
entative
 
ponse in English rather than demanding a fuller reply
 
pecially true when posing questions t
o the
 
W 
recorder was tuned on. Even i
f t
heir English r
esponse was monosyllabic,
 
I was disinclined t
o make an implicit criticism o
f their abilities by
 
suggesting that they r
espond in Khmer. Madorom
. Huot was there t
o act as
 
translator when they did not understand my question or when they chose
 
t
o respond in Khmer; but i
f they volunteered English, I did n
ot r
eject
 
i
t. Mouk Phon, for example, probably speaks better English than he was
 
inclined t
o demonstrate, but he f
elt very comfortable working t
hrough
 
translation and the two interviews with him worked very well.
 
The question o
f individual interviews versus group interviews may
 
also have influenced the choice o
f language used. I
f I were t
o g
o back
 
t
o the families and interview one person at a t
ime, I would probably
 
rely more on translation and push the questioning further. For the
 
initial interviews, however, I think that the group approach was
 
better--it represented less of an imposition on the people, their t
ime,
 
and hospitality. That i
s, by going into their homes and speaking with
 
everyone who was there, I interfered less with ongoing activities than
 
I would have if I had demanded uninterrupted t
ime with each person,
 
supposing that such uninterrupted t
ime were even available.
 
In my logs o
f t
he t
aped interviews I have r
eported the
 
on-the-spot translations by Madorom Huot and Moni Kou. It would,
 
however, be productive t
o return t
o the salient portions o
f the t
apes,
 
transcribe the Khmer responses, and then translate them in more detail,
 
rather than relying on the more summary on-the-spot translations. That
 
M 
paid Madorom Huot f
or the t
ime she s
pent assisting with interviews.)

A final word must be inserted on the proper use of quotations from
 
the taped interviews. In my tape logs, transcriptions, and the quotes
 
excerpted in this report I have frequently transcribed English
 
statements in a way that certain scholars might find improper: I have
 
taken the liberty of correcting the English words of my informants on
 
occasion. This has been done neither casually nor carelessly. After
 
careful deliberation I have taken the step with the following
 
considerations in mind. First, in the area of pronunciation, Khmer
 
speakers characteristically do not release the f
inal sounds o
f words
 
(in contrast to America-English speakers, who frequently emphasize
 
final phonemes, even to the point of exaggeration). Additionally,
 
certain of the final consonant clusters that are common in English are
 
difficult for Cambodians to pronounce, particularly the consonant
 
clusters which serve in English as verbal inflections or plural
 
markers. As an example, Cambodians might not distinguish in
 
pronunciation between "
look" and "
looked"; but this does noL  i
i
lv,111
 LLL dL
 
they are unaware of the difference, or would not make the distinction
 
in writing or in deliberate speech.
 
I have, consequently,  conjugated verbs or indicated plurals
 
correctly wherever the meaning was unmistakable, in spite of the
 
pronunciation. At a level of syntax, Cambodian does not inflect or
 
conjugate verbs for number or for tense (past and future being
 
indicated sometimes by compound verbs, but just as often not being
 
indicated at all, except by context). I have occasionally corrected the
 
tense of English verbs, or corrected person-number inflections. Again,
 
24
 
this has been done only where the sense was unmistakable. Because the
 
research and the report are intended t
o communicate the ideas and
 
intentions of the speakers, not to provide linguistic data, I believe
 
this procedure to be sound. The tapes themselves are the final
 
document, should someone eventually wish to use them for linguistically
 
oriented analyses; but for general informational purposes, the
 
"
corrected" transcripts should be used.
 
Finally, I offer a few suggestions for continuing research. As I
 
have remarked several times above, the village school' s  instruction in
 
Khmer literacy can only be understood in light of the total range of
 
formal and informal educational institutions and channels by which
 
cultural knowledge is transmitted from old to young. If work were to
 
continue in the Khmer Village, it should be designed to investigate
 
that total range of activities. That would include, for example,
 
mothers "
instructing" their daughters in cooking (conventional gender
 
roles still apply for many tasks), or musician Mouk Phon teaching
 
younger villagers to play traditional instruments. The first might be
 
more amorphous and unstructured, while the second would likely be more
 
formal and regularized. Research would include parents telling their
 
children the traditional heuristic tales of Judge Rabbit, or showing
 
them how to garden or harvest. It would involve more detailed
 
observation of children at the public schools and Gary Job Corps
 
and of adults at ESL classes. In sum, continued research would more
 
profitably investigate "education within an ethnic community" rather
 
than an isolated "
ethnic language school." The school itself would
 
25
 
surely figure centrally in any such research, but to limit our
 
curiosity to the physical boundaries of the school building's four
 
walls would be to constrain our possible understanding.
 
Postcript--March 1983
 
Returning to the Khmer Village almost a year after the beginning
 
of fieldwork for the Folklife Center's Ethnic Heritage and Language
 
Schools Project in the spring of 1982, I found that formal classroom
 
instruction in the Cambodian language had been suspended. I noted that
 
the word "
suspended" was chosen carefully instead of  "
terminated," for
 
it is hoped that classes can be resumed by the summer of 1983. What
 
factors produced this turn of events and what lessons can we draw from
 
it?
 
The major problem with the school has been economic--both strictly
 
in terms of money and also in terms of time. Madorom Huot has taken a
 
job, so the time that she can devote to volunteer teaching has been
 
curtailed. She has also enrolled in Houston Community College to pursue
 
a degree in chemistry, and study time for those classes is yet another
 
demand on her time. Finally, I report with great pleasure that her
 
household has grown, through circumstances at which we can only
 
marvel. When she spoke t
o me previously about her three children, she
 
2
6
 
referred to them as her three living children. I did not ask further
 
about others, who were presumably dead. In December 1981 Madorom's
 
oldest daughter (now sixteen) made her way finally to Mairut refugee
 
camp in Thailand, where Madorom had been principal of the school. She
 
had been taken care of by another family since 1
975, and had almost
 
forgotten the name of her mother, whom she had last seen when she was
 
only seven. At Mairut someone casually mentioned to her that she looked
 
like Madorom.  "What was that name you said?" she asked, and the person
 
repeated,  "Madorom." It did not take them long t
o determine that she
 
was Madorom's daughter. She has now joined her mother and siblings in
 
Houston, accompanied by members of the family that had adopted her in
 
the interim. Obviously, these new responsibilities take precedence over
 
Cambodian lessons for the time being.
 
The school building continues to be used daily for adult ESL
 
classes. During my last visit Yani Keo was rehearsing a group of young
 
girls in the classical dance style. When Madorom Huot or another
 
teacher i
s able to devote additional time, formal classroom Cambodian
 
language lessons will likely resume.
 
A similar pattern--for a school to operate for a few months and
 
then discontinue--seems to occur quite often when Indochinese refugees
 
have attempted to establish language schools. Mong Heng told me that he
 
held Khmer classes at St. Anthony Church in Falls Church, Virginia for
 
several months at the beginning of 1
982, until other demands on his
 
t
ime forced him to stop. The two Lao language efforts I have found out
 
2
7
 
about--in San irancisco, California and Murfreesboro, Tennessee--also
 
proved to be short-term projects that ended when their organizers could
 
no longer devote t
ime to them.
 
The most permanent lessons about which I have heard are the Khmer
 
language lessons run by the Venerable Oung Mean at the Cambodian
 
Buddhist Association temple in New Carrolton, Maryland. He has
 
conducted language and religion classes regularly every Saturday for
 
more that two years. Although the classes are regular, the attendance
 
is not always stable, primarily because of transportation difficulties.
 
Finally,  there i
s one additional literacy effort at present which
 
is quite different from the Lao and Cambodian classes. It i
s organized
 
by the Kmhmu, a highland ethnic group from Laos, now living in
 
Stockton, California. They have been conducting classes twice weekly
 
for three months in the Kmhmu language. Kmhmu was unwritten until the
 
mid-1950s, and even after missionaries devised a Latin-based alphabet,
 
the Kmhmu were prohibited from learning it by the central Laotian
 
government.  Since only a few of the 1
,200 Kmhmu in the United States
 
are literate in their own language, they have made it a priority to
 
increase literacy among adults and children. An additional problem for
 
them is to develop teaching methods and curriculum materials as they
 
proceed since they do not have a written heritage and there are no
 
available textbooks. The Kmhmu lessons, including both adults and
 
children, are held in someone's home, with a piece of painted plywood
 
serving as an improvised blackboard, and notebooks and pads which the
 
students bring from home.

These various endeavors, along with the Khmer Village activities,
 
remind us of the necessity of minimizing our preconceptions when we
 
search for ethnic language and heritage education. It will l
ikely be a
 
long t
ime before any of the Indochinese refugees are able t
o establish
 
formal schools with stable and permanent facilities,  faculties, and
 
attendance. The exigencies of their economic situation prevent them
 
from devoting the time, energy, and money which would be necessary to
 
establish permanent schools. Yet language training and cultural
 
education proceed in these communities, perhaps not enclosed within
 
a school building or occurring within a set time period every week, but
 
important nevertheless. Studies of cultural education among America's
 
ethnic groups must consider the total range of formal and informal
 
educational institutions and channels by which cultural knowledge is
 
trnsmitted from old to young. Our studies should not be limited to
 
those activities which meet some external standard of formality or
 
permanence, even if such established institutions might be our primary
 
focus. Such schools would surely figure centrally in our research,
 
but t
o limit our curiosity to the physical bounds of a school would be
 
to limit our greater comprehension of community education.
