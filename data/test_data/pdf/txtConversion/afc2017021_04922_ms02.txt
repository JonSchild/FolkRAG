Interesting Projects: Challenged by the established process of oversewing books, new methods had 
to be found. The double fan adhesive binding process, already widely used in Europe needed to be 
introduced in North America. LBI did sponsor Werner to study the adhesives used for this process and 
most of all, to study its longevity. His research found, that such adhesives most likely will last over 
500 years. Librarians first did not believe his research and requested a repeat by two well-known 
preservation experts, Barkley Odgen and Robert Strauss. They came up with the same results. These 
days, over 90% of all library bindings are done using the double fan binding process. Newer 
adhesives, like PUR (Polyurethane) will last even longer. 
 
Associations: Werner gave several presentations at American Library Association Conferences about 
various binding processes and introduced librarians to the materials used.  He worked with groups 
developing revised Library Binding Standards at outset.  Werner was s strict proponent of a 
performance-based standard. 
 
Career: Werner can look back to a 65 year long career as a Bookbinding expert. Moving from a most 
successful industry career into the academia, sharing his wide-ranging experiences with students, 
industry seminar participants and librarians.
