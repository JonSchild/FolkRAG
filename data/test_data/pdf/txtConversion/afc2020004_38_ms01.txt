i gotta be Indian tomorrow 
 
i came back to Nevada 
because somebody decided 
they needed a native american 
on their radio show 
& i came to mind 
i’m flattered 
& my ego drove me 
200 miles over snow packed mountains 
but now 
before the interview/reading 
i’m panicked 
i haven’t written an “Indian poem” 
in a long time 
maybe only 1 out of 100 poems 
even touch my tribal-ness 
they think just because 
i am native 
means anything 
i write somehow is rooted 
in native-ness 
but in flipping the pages of 
my 3 ring binder 
i find nothing mentioning 
mother earth or feathers or reservations 
even though 
i stand on mother earth 
& my rearview mirror has 
an eagle feather tied to it 
& after the interview 
i’ll be going back to the reservation 
to see my family 
 
is that indian enough 
for them? i don’t know 
i guess it will have to be 
tomorrow 
i’ll think deeper 
about being indian.
