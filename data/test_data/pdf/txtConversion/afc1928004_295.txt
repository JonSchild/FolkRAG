On the corner beyond there's a

Milking sweet the passing hours, 
Then my darling waits for me;

Cheer our sorrows when they come, 
Bless its pure and simple pleasures, 
Evermore, " God bless our home !" 
When the gloomy night is falling, 
And my weary heart is sad, 
Sweetest voices then are calling, 
Making music pure and glad; 
Oh! they charm away my sorrow, 
Smooth my path where'er I 
roam; 
Not one cloud can dim the morrow, 
While I 
sing. " God bless our home !" 
Bless our home, &o. 
There the dearest joys are biding, 
There is Heaven on earth for me; 
While the sands of life are gliding, 
Sweetest blessings there I

Atay those blessings live forever, 
Keep the wolf from out the door. 
Welcome be each friend, and never 
May our hearts forget the poor.

When first I 
met this widower, 
'Twas on my journey down; 
To spend a 
day at Long Branch— 
Just like a 
swell from town; 
The widower loved romantic scenes, 
And t 
squeeze on the sly; 
So when his arm went round my waist, 
The boy began to cry. 
SPOKEN—Yes, the more the boy cried, the more the 
father said— 
Tommy, make room., &C. 
The father told his loYing son 
To watch the passing train ; 
But no, he said, Papa you'll kiss 
That lady again. 
Of course I 
blushed a 
maiden blush, 
And he was not himself; 
For who could make love on a 
seat 
In front of that young elf.

SIX FEET OF EARTH, 
Written, composed and sung by JOE A. Guracx, and sung by 
W ILEY HAMILTON with tremendous applaute. 
I'LL sing you a 
song of the world and its ways, 
And the many strange people we meet, 
From the rich man who rolls in his millions of wealth, 
To the poor starving wretch in the street; 
Now a 
man though he's poor and in tatters and rags, 
We should never affect to despise, 
But think of the adage, remember my friend, 
That six feet of earth makes all men of one size. 
There the rich man with thousands to spare if tie choose, 
But he haughtily holds up his head, 
And thinks he's above the mechanic who toils, 
And is honestly earning his bread; 
But his gold and his jewels he can't take along, 
To the world alp above when he dies, 
For death levels, all and conclusively shows, 
That six feet of earth makes all men of one size. 
There's many a 
coat that is tattered and torn, 
That covers a 
brave manly heart, 
But because he's not dressed like his neighbor in silks, 
Society keeps them apart! 
On one fortune smiles, while the other one fails, 
No matter what venture he tries, 
Till time in the end calls them both to the grave, 
And six feet of earth makes both men of one size. 
When e'er you see a 
poor fellow that tries 
To battle the world and its frowns, 
Let's help him along, and perchance he'll succeed, 
Don't crush him and still push him down, 
For a 
cup of cold water in charity given, 
Is remembered with joy in the skies, 
We're all human beings, we've all got to die, 
And six feet of earth makes us all of me size.

Cares may come and weary sadness, 
Must we then forever sigh ? 
Brave the storm with firm endeavor, 
Let your vain repinings go 1 
Hopeful hearts will find forever--
Roses underneath the snow! 
CHORUS. 
Brave the storm with firm endeavor, 
Let your vain repinings go! 
Hopeful hearts will find forever— 
Roses underneath the snow. 
One by one the links that bind us 
May be severed here on earth ; 
But the Sun will surely find us 
Thro' the Winter's gloomy dearth! 
Cheerful hearts around us beating, 
Wearing ever Summer's glow, 
Ah! we know you're always meeting— 
Roses underneath the snow ! 
Brave the storm, ike. 
Never joy that earth can send us 
Can forever leave us here! 
Ey'ry flower that Spring can lend us 
Blooms again another year! 
Cares may come, but never mind them, 
Joys may come and joys may go 
Look around and you will find them—

POOR, BUT A GENTLEMAN STILL.

Price, Ten Cents. 
Don't think by my dress that I've come here to beg, 
Though the sharp pangs of hunger I 
feel; 
The cup of misfortune I've drained to the dregs, 
But I'm proud, though I'm shabby- genteel. 
A 
time was, when nobs who met me would say, 
"Ha, Harry, dear boy, come and dine." 
But now, when they meet me, they look Other way; 
My company now they decline. 
CHORUS. 
Though poverty daily looks in at my door; 
I 
am hungry, I'm footsore and ill, 
I 
can look the whole world in the face and say, 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman still. 
Reverses in business brought me to a 
stand; 
I 
found very soon I 
should smash; 
My friends advised me to fly from the laud, 
And seize upon all my loose cash; 
ut my reputation was dearer to me 
Than all the bright gold in my 
till, 
So I 
paid what I 
owed and proudly I 
said, 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman still. 
Though poverty, &c. 
One evening last week, the other end of the town, 
Whilst wandering sadly along, 
I 
picked up a 
purse a 
lady had dropped, 
The temptation to keep it was strong. 
My pockets were empty, but firmly I 
said, 
She shall have her own come what will; 
She looked at my dress as I 
gave it and said, 
" 
If you're poor, you're a 
gentleman still." 
Though poverty, & c. 
Last evening I 
rescued a 
poor homeless girl 
Whom a 
swell was insulting ; I 
found 
My strength for the moment was something immense, 
As I 
hurled the great brute to the ground. 
He cried out " you begger, don't meddle with me 
Or very soon you'll -rt•et a 
pill," 
But I 
said, " lay a 
-hand on that girl and you'll find 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman still."

In life I'm certain to succeed, 
Tho' tricks I 
do disdain • 
I 
know just how to do things brown, 
No matter what's the game. 
In business, or 'society, 
Good luck I 
can command: 
I 
show them all that I 
am right, 
For I 
hold the winning hand. 
CHORUS. 
I 
hold the winning hand, boys, 
The Fates I 
can command, boys; 
In love or strife, and all thro' life, 
I 
hold the winning hand. 
I 
sailed upon the stormy sea, 
And heard the billows roar ; 
The ship was sinking down with me, 
So I 
thought I'd swim ashore: 
One man began to shout and pray, 
He could not reach the land ; 
"Farewell," said I " my Christian friend, 
I 
bold the winning hand!" 
I 
held, 65.c.. 
heard those saintly gentlemen 
In Barnum's music hall, 
With all their might and sense of right, 
For sinners they did call; 
I 
heard them singing, " Hold the Fort." 
And, " Come and join the Band 
But I 
belong to Plymouth Church, 
And I 
hold the winning hand! 
I 
hold, &c. 
I 
fell in love—of course you know 
All mankind is the same ; 
My sweetheart was a 
charming girl, 
McGuinness was her name. 
I 
thought she was the fairest flow'r 
That bloomed in all the land; 
Like Cupid's dart, she pierced my heart, 
For she held the winning hand! 
I 
hold, &c. 
But soon there came another chap 
Who wears much finer clothes, 
He introduced himself to her 
As " Hilderbrandt Montrose !" 
His baby words and " crochet work," 
My ears could never stand, 
So I 
bounced him out, and showed him then 
That I 
held the winning hand! 
I 
hold, .

He must be neat, he must be sweet, 
His brains in his head must be; 
He must not stare at girls, 
Whene'er he walks abroad with me1 
He must not drink, he must not think 
When I 
speak, to make reply; 
Work ey'ry day, give me his pay; 
None other need apply! 
I 
fancy that with such a 
one, 
Life would a 
pleasure be; 
But where to find just such a

Is what perplexes me; 
Perhaps he may be in the throng 
Collected here to night; 
If so, I 
hope he'll step right up, 
IIl make the rest all right.

List gentle lark, joyous spirit of Spring; 
Thou with the sweet voice and cloud-cleaving wing, 
Shake from thy plumage the tears of the night, 
Haste where the splendors of morning invite; 
Soar where the sinless and beautiful stray, 
Tell them my Norah's as lovely as they. 
CHORUS. 
She's the " Lilly of Kerry 1" 
The fairest e'er seen 
In Erin the seagirt, 
In Erin the green. 
Greet, in thy rapture, yon rose-scented dell, 
Deep in whose shadow my Norah cloth dwell ; 
Norah, as pure as the pearls on the thorn, 
Bright as the golden hair'd goddess of morn ; 
She, from whose fairy-like fingers, the flow'rs 
Fall on the meadows in odorous show'rs. 
She's the:Lilly, itt.. 
E'en the bright shamrocks that bloom round thy bed, 
Tremble with joy at my Norah's soft tread. 
Mild as the moonbeam that falls on the stream, 
When at love's vespers, the glow -worm cloth gleam, 
Free from all guile, and unconscious of wrong, 
Simple and sweet as thy -silvery song. 
She's the Lilly, Icc.

But when his daily toil is done, all round the streets he'll roam, 
And sometimes after midnight, you will find him rolling home. 
Ciro '. 
When Brown comes rolling home, oh, then he's in his glory 
He loves to sing a 
song, or tell a 
jolly story; 
But there's a 
scolding wife, that waits for him alone; 
0, there's sure to be an awful row, when _Brown comes rolling 
home! 
He circumvents the excise law upon the Sabbath day, 
And drinks his beer with right good cheer, no matter what they 
say; 
He loves a 
schooner, tall and deep, with no great wealth of 
foam; 
A 
few of these are sure to please and send him rolling home! 
When Brown comes, &c. 
At night he wakes his neighbors up, when pounding at the 
door; 
Sometimes its two, sometimes its three, and often after four; 
And where he stays till such an hour, the fact is never known, 
He says " it's business" all the time, that sends him rolling 
home! 
When Brown comes, & c. 
Be drinks a 
keg of lager bier, he quaff the wine of Mumm! 
And if he stands without support, he's slightly out of plumb; 
But Brown heeds not his wavering st , 
PS, he cries out " Come 
boys, come! 
" 
We'll take a 
drink, a 
social drink, then I'll go rolling home !" 
When Brown comes, &c.

PATCHOULA. 
LOVELY and fair is my darling Patchoula, 
With eyes tender blue as mid summer's sky; 
She is my 
jewel, my heart's fondest treasure, 
The bloom on her cheeks will the roses outvie. 
She treats coldly my passionate ardor, 
Oh I 
its then that I 
love her the harder, 
Though She says on her life she'll ne'er be my wifb 
Such a 
dear little witch is Patchoula. 
CHORUS. 
Ohl beautiful, bewitching Patchoula, 
My dear little riddle Patchoula, 
She can fool me at will but I'll think of her still, 
My witching, my darling Patchoula. 
When I 
first saw Patchoula one bright summer morning 
She stood by the side of her own father's gate, 
The smile that she gave me had the spell of a 
charmer; 
'Twits then that I 
knew I 
had met all my fate, 
With her manners so bewitching and simple, 
Her cheeks are so roguish and dimpled; 
What care I 
for life if she'd by ray wife,

DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away, 
But, my darling, you will be, will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes, my darling, you will be, 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS. 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to-day, 
Life is fading fast away— 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say, 
Oh! my darling, mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
yes, my darling, mine alone— 
You have never older grown! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc, 
25 
Love can never mOre grow old, 
Locks may lose their brown and gold; 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know, 
Never, never, winter's frost and chill; 
Bummer warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I'm growing, etc 
Love is always young and fair, 
What to us is sliver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below; 
Since I 
kissed you, mine alone, aloof..., 
You have never older grown— 
since I 
kissed you, mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing etc.

Of a

It killed a

A

Oh everything was shaky, 
It broke every gin mill's slate, 
When ten billion pounds of water 
Busted at hell gate ; 
Move away from powder, 
Get out for your late, 
Or ' twill send you up to glory, 
Dis busting at hell gate. 
Dutch went up with Irish, 
Republicans and Democrats'.; 
It killed every feline Thomas, 
And buried all the rats, 
It threw up old tine (lumplings, 
Cut up half the State, 
And sent Astoria up to venus, 
Dis busting of hell gate ; 
Vesuvius ain't a

Banks are sure to break, 
It hove up all the Ocean, 
Dis busting of hell gate.

I'm a 
brother t ) Josephus Orange BlGssom, 
I 
can sing and dance, and all that sort of thing; 
I 
can play upon the fiddle and the banjo, 
Oh, Lord a 
Massa can't I 
make them sing. 
I 
suppose you all have seen my brother Joseph, 
And his dancing you have found it hard to beat 
For he never had a 
chance for education, 
So he only tried to educate his feet. 
.CHORUS. 
Come soon (Sym) plenty of room (Sym)— 
Come, we'll give all a 
good fair chance, 
For I 
tell you that it runs right in the family 
For all of us to play and sing and dance. 
Now Joe is getting old and rather shakey, 
And thinks its time for him to take a 
rest; 
So lie sent for me to come up here before you, 
And to fill his place, I'll:try and do o'ir best. 
I 
know that Joe has made a 
good impression, 
And I 
only hope that I 
ran do the same; 
For I 
also want to make a 
reputation 
As that will help keep up the family name.

THIS season now has opened bright, 
For us to cut the wing, 
So let us now embrace this chance, 
A 
song and dance we'll sing; 
We will sling ourselves clear out of sight, 
'Way off of this plantation, 
And show you tricks you never saw 
Before in all creation. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
I'm so jolly, 
And I'm in for folly, 
For we both wear the laurels now, 
And with them we will never part, 
To sing and dance here every night, 
Is just the object of my heart. • 
We feel like falling on our heads, 
Our feet they seem so light, 
It's easy done if you know how, 
In it we take delight; 
For sensation now and novelty, 
Is all the rage and go, 
And if you'll notice us a 
while,: 
Observe this fact we know. 
Ohl I'm so jolly,

Oh, watch the way we sling our gains, 
Glory hallelujah lam to all the blessed lambs, 
Now watch our 
yle, and watch it close, 
With our educated bend, 
For we are easy careless colored gentlemen. 
We are going to run for Congress the coming election, 
And on our style we do depend, 
For we are easy, careless colored gentlemen, 
If they will only let the women vote, 
I 
am sure we will have a 
chance, 
For if they stick to us we will not go back on them, 
For we art easy, careless colored gentlemen.

YE may talk about your " Mulligan Guards," and " Regular 
Army, Oh !" 
I 
never shall forget the day I 
started for to go, 
And be a 
bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and free, 
In the gallant " Sixty- Ninth," I 
jined the ranks of Company 
G i o 
They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a 
dozen 
more. 
Wid a 
musket on me shoulder, sure they made me walk thiz 
floor! 
We march'd unto the right and left, until me feet were sore, 
When we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift ! Lift!" the sargint used to say, 
"Now ye's have it! can't ye keep it.? 
Turn yer head this way! 
Right about! Shoulder arms!'' 
An hour every day, 
Whin we were in the timid " Awkward Squad," 
I 
found it very diflikilt to keep the step at all, 
Along wid all the others when paradin' in the Hall; 
At aich mistake I 
used to make, the sargint he would say: 
"Yer as awkward as the divil; (loan% ye hould yer gon that 
way!" 
35 
Whine'er fie'd space an ordher, but egad! 'twas wid a 
vim; 
I 
often wished, upon my soul, to put a 
head on him. 
But he at least \veigh'd twenty stone, while I 
was very slim, 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
Chorus.—" Lift! Lift!" &c. 
Whin we're considered compitant, into the company 
They'll put us in the ranks at wanst, and there they'll let us be; 
And undher sargint's orders thin no longer we'll plod, 
Shouldher arms and counther marchin' in the timid "Awkward. 
Squad." 
Whin out into the strate we go to have a 
foine parade, 
We'll be looked upon wid pride, me boys, by every servant 
maid; 
And wid the sargint on our right no more we'll be afraid. 
Of marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
Chorus.-'' Lift! Lift!" &c. 
If ever I'm promoted, and a 
Gineral I 
be, 
I'll make 'em feel me vingeance, all sargints under me! 
I'll have 'em marchin' ivery day, or carryin' the hod, 
For being so uncivil to the timid " Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retalyate or give me any talk, 
rejuice them to the ranks at wance, and there I'll make 'em 
walk! 
If that ain't punishment enough, " like any other gawk," 
Gad, I'll put them in the timid " Awkward Squad."

I am in love with a

Who calls me pudding head;

She eloped this town with some other chap, 
Who at the corner cried, cried, cried.

And leave her darling Billy, 
For a

If she don't soon return to me, 
I'll go and cut my throat, 
And I'll get some fellow's big tuba horn, 
And blow all my brains out. 
SPOKEN.—Look here, Bilious, what's the use of us all the 
time fighting about this girl; I 
don't oare no more for her 
than I 
do for my life. 
Does you ?

don't. I 
wouldn't care, only she took 
me so cool, I 
came near freezing after I 
took her to the 
theatre and squatted her in a 
cushion seat. 
She put her 
hand so lovingly 'on my voice, and said in such a 
sweet tone 
of shoulder, 
Now you sit here, my Billy dear, 
I'll just go to the door, 
And fetch some roasted peanuts in, 
But I 
never saw her more. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, she had gone fled from my gaze like a 
beautiful dream, and all that remained to tell the sad dismal 
story, was a 
lump of coke that looked up in my face as if it 
would say,

RING THE BELL SOFTLY 
SOME one has gone from this strange wofid of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers, 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where; on all beauty, Death's fingers are laid. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
CHORUS. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet; 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is resting from sorrow and sin, 
Happy where earth's conflicts enter not in. 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams have brought us their right. 
Weary with sowing and never to reap, 
Weary with labor and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to He:-,ven's glad shore ! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Weary with mingling, &c. 
Angels were anxiously longing to meet 
One who walks with them in heaven's bright street; 
Loved ones have whispered that some one is blest, 
Free from earth's trials, and taking sweet rest. 
Yes! there is one more in angelic bliss, 
One less to cherish, and one less to kiss, 
One more departed to Heaven's bright shore! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door.

Now some girls are bashful, 
And others are bold, 
Now I

Of nineteen years old ; 
About her—like some others—

For at the least thing 
She'd be sure to commence ( with her) 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! fie, for shame, 
What would Mamma say? 
What would Papa say ? 
Oh, my! fie, for shame ; 
G-et along Joseph, do. 
I'd take her about 
To wherever she'd pleaAe; 
When we were alone 
She'd appear ill at ease ; 
Now a 
kiss, once a 
week, 
Every fellow'd expect, 
But when I 
tried for one, 
She'd be sure to object ( with her) 
Oh, my! fie, for shame, dr.c. 
Her Pa and her Mo. 
Out of town chanced to 1?e, 
So I 
called on my ekarmer, 
And with her took tea; 
The time like a 
slow 
Quaker's meeting did pass, 
Till she somehow by accident 
Turned out the gas. 
SPOREN. — There we were all in the dark. I 
was afraid 
to move for fear of breaking something, and she couldn't 
or wou!dn't find the matches ; when she found I 
didn'l 
mocc.7, she said— 
Oh, my! fie, for shame, &c. 
She seemed, oh, so awfully 
Coy and demure, 
That I 
thought her complaint 
Only marriage would cure ; 
So.I.asked, " If she wed, 
Did she think she would die ?" 
She pretended to faint, 
But her only reply was— 
Oh, my! fie, for shame, Jct. 
Now I 
found out this bashful 
And timid young lamb 
Via,s simply a 
con-
glom-er-a-tion of sham;

Her kisses were free :

All hearts they captivate.

MeGER was a 
jolly old cobbler, 
He came from the divil knows where; 
Of whiskey he was a 
great gobbler, 
And delighted to go on a " tare." 
tle was often persuaded to alter 
His habits and live like a 
man ; 
But whenever he tried he would falter, 
And go back to his bottle and can. 
CHORUS. 
McGee was a 
terrible man, to. 
He was always so flighty and frisky; 
He tried to reform, but he couldn't keep warm, 
Sure, he'd die if he had'nt his whiskey. 
His wife was a 
dacent old woman, 
And scolded from mornin' till night; 
She told him he must be inhuman 
To be keeping them in such a 
plight. 
He would listen in scorn and derision, 
And drink just as much as before ; 
Till at length she gave out her decision 
To begin on a 
temperance war. 
McGee was, etc. 
Sbe went to a 
temperance preacher 
And stated the case of McGee; 
40 
iIe promised to help the poor creature— 
" 
I'll go over next mornin'," says he, 
When he came, the old cobbler was roaring 
A 
song with a 
glass in his hand; 
'Twas the glass he was fond of adoring, 
And he seemed hardly able to stand 
McGee was, etc. 
"Dear Misther McGee," said his rev'rence 
" 
I 
hope you will alter your ways; 
I've come now to give you deliverance 
From the evil that's blighting your days.'," 
"'Pon me soul, says McGee, " I 
am ready, 
I'll stop with the greatest of cheer; 
But I 
fear I 
can never be steady 
While a 
drop of good whiskey is near." 
McGee was, etc. 
"Fear not," said the man of cold water, 
"You'll show us how good you can be; 
The demon of drink we will slaughter, 
And we'll honor the name of McGee." 
Then he promised to keep at a 
distance. 
All drinks of whatever degree; 
"Noble man, you shall have our assistance— 
In a 
week the result we will see. 
McGee was, Azc. 
SPOKEN.— The reverend gentleman, after some further per-
suasions, took his departure, and Mr. McGee at once became a 
strict disciple of temperance. 
The sudden change of life had a 
severe eflect upon him; he lost all his exuberant spirits, being 
entirely under the control of his wife and the temperance advo-
cates, who filled his mind every day with solemn lectures, and 
worked him into such a 
queer state— half comfort, calf despair 
—that be would often say to himself, " Begob, I'n. idOS atm& 
60 
at all!" 
At last they induced him to state in a 
public meeting 
the various benefits be had derived from his adherence to the 
pledge—the comfort, the happiness, the great joy and peace of 
mind he had experienced during his short season of sobriety. 
Ile attended the meeting, and with a 
very grave countenance, 
related his experience as follows; 
RECITATION. 
Good people, I 
stand here before you to-night, 
Me month very dhry, and me head very light; 
It's three weeks to-day since I 
joined the ranks 
Of the Wather Brigade, I 
left ofT me onld pranks 
And ever since then, sure, me life has been blessed 
With a 
great many comforts, and nights of good rest. 
I 
paid all me debts, and I 
bought a 
new gown 
For the wife of me bosom—a 
beautiful brown— 
I 
took from the pawn shop me foine Sunday coat,. 
Which cost me last winter a 
ten dollar note, 
And put a 
new sole on the could woman's shoes,— 
A 
moighty big job, for she wears " twinty-two's!" 
I 
made a 
new sty for the fine little pigs, 
And fixed up the garden with bushes and twigs; 
I 
wint to a 
lawyer and made out my will, 
My duty to all I 
was bound to fulfill. 
And yesterday morning, (don't think that I'm scofiln'), 
I 
bought for me body an illigant coffin! 
Forl know if my whisky is taken from me, 
You'll very soon make a 
dead man of McGee.

Song and Dance, composed by JA..s. Nrrms. 
Performed by NILES & EVANS with success. 
Oh, when we were two little boys 
Way down in South Canine ; 
We used to sing and dance about, 
And with our hands keep time. 
But when we grew up bigger 
We had to work all day, 
And then we never had a 
chance 
To fool around that way.

But, Oh! my! NN hen our work was done—Sym, 
Then was the time that we all went in for fun ; 
We used to sing and dance about

[Dance. 
But now the times have changed you see, 
Down in our Sunnily Home ; 
The Rebellion broke the country up, 
So now we have to roam. 
And what they want to do with us, 
We're sure we do not know, 
Unless to make us Senators

WE 
often read of the power 
Of princes and if kings, 
Who stripp'd of all their grandeur, 
Are but poor mortal things; 
But there's a 
power stronger, 
Which lasts for ttne untold, 
To which all men must bow and that's 
The bright, bright Gold. 
CHORUS, 
Gold, Gold, Gold! I 
love to hear it:ling:A 
Gold, Gold, Gold! its power is untold, 
We men strive hard to store it, 
And woman she'll adore it, 
The best friend that a 
man can havel8 
Gold, Gold, Gold! 
The man that's minus money, 
The world will cell a 
fiats 
And pass him by, but if he's rich 
Will gaily raise as bats 
It sneers at the unlucky, 
But smiles on he who wins, 
And gold will gloss and cover, 
Quite a 
multitude of sins. 
Gold, sold, &n. 
The maid both plain and ancient, 
Appears a 
perfect " sweet," 
If rich, her gold magnetic draws 
"Fond" lovers to her feet; 
some say this Gold's a 
curse, and thal 
It causes strife and pride, 
But we know it is a blessing, 
When its properly applied. 
Gold, Gold, &A 
Love and content in a 
cottage, 
I've heard of, so have you, 
But I 
fear that kind of bliss, 
is only experienced by few: 
Wheit trouble comes unto the door, 
Love flies, or else grows cold, 
And the only thing to warm it up is

As sung by Anicv2. BErrN-ETT. 
Why turn away when I 
draw near? 
Why cold to-day? once I 
was dear; 
Then thy heart stirred and flushed thy brow; 
Never a 
word comes to me now— 
Now thy hand lies listless in mine; 
Once its replies spake love divine; 
Cold as if we never had met; 
Can it then be hearts can forget? 
CHORUS. 
Speak to me, speak— 
Be my heart heard, or it will break, 
For one kind word; 
No vows to bind, no pledge I 
seek, 
Only be kind—speak to me, speak. 
One idle day thou did'st deplore 
Some castaway, on desert shore; 
'Twas but a 
tale, by poet feigned, 
Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan—sad, gad to be 
'Utterly lone, by the bleak sea; 
My life is drear, I, cast away— 
Give me the tear thou shed'st that day. 
Speak to me, ite.

I 
WILL sing a 
song of nations great, 
Among them I 
will name, 
English, Irish, German, and America, 
Though I 
hope not one of you 
Will find the least offence, 
With anything that I 
may say; 
For I 
will give to all of them, 
There own justly dues, 
Not one of them out of place will name, 
For I'm not the least bit partial, 
To any country 'neath the sun, 
But cry aloud, let them all have their righteous claim. 
CHORUS. 
Then praise all of you your country, 
Your country's glorious name, 
And if you will take a 
righteous path, 
You will win a 
honored fame. 
There is dear old England, always calm, 
Who never speaks a 
word, 
Not even to praise her honored name, 
If she would only speak and tell the good she does, 
Many other countries they would blush for shame, 
In honor to the men-of-war that's in her navy yard, 
Is a 
most wonderful sight to be seen; 
Then let us give her credit, 
For the noble work she's done, 
And all say, God save the Queen. 
Then praise all of you, etc. 
Now there's oueGerman country, 
Who's deserving of great praise, 
With her noble King William at their head, 
Although he was victorious in the recent Prussian war, 
He's mourning now the blood his country shed, 
Let us hope that he may never have cause to fight again, 
To lose the useful men that they have raised, 
But let each brotherly country together hand in hand, 
And each sing aloud the other's praise. 
Then praise all of you. etc. 
Now there is dear old Ireland, 
Which is next upon my list, 
Who for long has been opposed to he own right, 
But she will not beg for mercy, 
If she thought it would be granted; 
She will wait till she is strong enough to fight. 
For old Ireland is the mother of many honest hearts, 
And every day more are growing in the land, 
Then why, if she can help it, should she be trod upon, 
For bold hearts are often found in Irishmen. 
6o 
CHORUS. 
Old Ireland has suffered, 
But soon will cry for glee, 
For the time is quickly drawing near, 
When old Ireland shall be free. 
Now there's another country, 
She's the greatest ot them all, 
America, where Freedom never dies, 
Fihe's the mother of invention, 
Her productions they are greatest, 
Of any country ' neath the skies, 
She's a 
refuge for all nations of every land and clime, 
But of this pray don't think we boast, 
We only ask you to remember how America has suuerel 
For the lives to win this Freedom that was lost, 
CHORUS. 
Then who deserves this honor, 
Why, our noble Washington, 
For he's Father of the greatest country

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We hags, 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-comraittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too tearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonge d 
an d 
enjoyed 
i
n 
the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
