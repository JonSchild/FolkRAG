THE ROVIN' IRISH BOY. 
Words by Wu. CARLETON. 
Music by C. J. 21tEns. 
(The music of this song is published by Ono SUTI10, 189 West .Balti• 
more Street, Bait,, Md. 
Price 50 cents.) 
I'm a 
roviu' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened A 
uekna-cloy 
With a 
turn o' the wrist 
My stick I t 
wist, 
I 
am iny mother's joy ; 
I've thravelled many a 
mile, 
To win Iti'tiev(eilko". '1s l 
our heart for them I'd part, .1 
And many an hour- bog-idle. 
But now Pm hero to tell you all, 
The places I 
have het-
And all the very funny things 
In my thravels I 
have soen. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened A 
itck na-cloy, 
With a 
turn o' the wrist 
stiek I 
twist, 
And I'm my mother's joy.—[Dance Garr3-owen.] 
I've been to " La Belle France," 
Where the girls know how to dance; 
If I 
left the bogs 
Yet I 
couldn't ait frogs, 
Tim' I've often had a 
chance ; 
Don't think that I 
am green, 
For in Germany I've been, 
1There sausages strong, 
And pretzels long, a 
yard or more I've seen. 
Then into Mile:sip, I 
have rushed, 
The land of fittS 81111 capes, 
The men all make the women work, 
L And the soldiers look like apes. 
For I'm a 
rovite Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened A 
uekna-eloy. 
With a 
turn 0' my wrist, 
My stick I 
twist, 
And 1 
ant my mother's joy. 
To China thin I 
whit 
And got my hearts contint 
Of the briny say, 
And wretch-eil bad tay 
Enough to make me squint ; 
Japan then Caine in view, 
Be toy sow I 
I 
saw that too, 
But yellow Jack nigh broke my back, 
That's why I 
look so blue. 
Then Sainte up illier"4tars and stripes 
I 
reached Columbia's shore, 
And now I 
love the place so well, 
I'll never leave it more. 
Except the cry will be, 
"Come Paddy, join with me 
And brave once more. 
The Atlantic's roar, 
And make euld Ireland free," 
ICILL OR CURE. 
I'm a 
roving Irish boy, I 
was born in Ballaraghan, 
And christened with much joy, after my father, Patrick Faghan ; 
1 
had a 
sweetheart Kitty, and I 
courted her so gaily, 
Devil a 
thought had I 
of trouble, as I 
twisted my shelalagh. 
CHORUS. 
Musha, Kitty O'Shaughnessy, she's the girl for me, 
Whack fal de daddy, mushy. O'Shaughnessy. 
Och, ' twas herself I 
courted, a 
girl so neat and cosy, 
She said she loved Inc in return—her cheeks were red and rosy; 
Of sovereigns I 
had twenty, says she, I've seventeen, 
Faith, we'll join ourselves and them together, and live like king 
and queen. 
Musha, & c. 
So we both set sail for Liverpool, and packed our kits' together, 
And married got so neat and cool, in spite of wind and weather; 
'With our money we opened a 
shop, in business not amiss, 
We sold oysters, haddocks, mac'ral, mussels, praties, and fried 
fish. 
Musha, & c. 
In business we did well, till one day she was taken ill, sirs, 
And the doctor almost ruined me by sending in his bill, sirs; 
So I 
made a 
bargain with him, " kill or cure," for twenty pounds 
so frisky, 
He was a 
dacent sort, so I 
thought I'd stand a 
noggin of Irish 
whiskey. 
Musha, drc. 
But she grew worse and worse, which made me ' quake with fear, 
sir, 
The doctor he attended her for more than half a 
year, sir; 
Till one fine morn she died, and myself it; did bewilder, 
And the doctor he wanted his twenty pounds, ( spoken) says 
I, you never cured her! 
No, says he— then says 1, (singing) you dare not say you 
killed her I 
Musha, &c. 
So gentlemen enjoy themselves, the whiskey drink like thunder, 
You cannot help but own yourselves, there's mirth in an Irish 
blunder; 
But when for your wives a 
doctor you want, mind and yer be sure, 
Make the bargain as I 
did myself, wid the doctor, " kill or cure.' 
Musha, & c. 
JUDY =GEE. 
Parody on " A 
Baby was Sleeping." 
Tat Fagan was snoring, poor Judy was roaring, 
He'd given her a 
beating for nothing, d'ye see, 
And while he was sleeping, poor Judy was weeping, 
Say ii2g, I 
know the devil has been whispering to thee. 
The pot it was boiling, and the praties were spoiling-4 
But the :devil of .a 
bit more I'll cook -for him, says she. 
To find him the eating when he gives me the bating, 
For he's trashed well the hide of poor Judy rGee. 
-Why need I 
be telling of my father's snug dwelling. 
For he was a 
farmer and a 
kind man to me; 
Be had a 
cow, and a 
pony, and a 
little dog, 
Tony; 
And a 
pig he christened after me, Judy M'Gee. 
You nasty big scrawl now, I 
will.explain all now, 
And my big brother Barney, will soon let you see-; 
Altho' you're a 
Fagan, he'll whack you like a 
Pagan, 
For you've murdered the soul out of Judy M'Gee. 
I 
once was your charmer, but now I'm your bed warmer; 
Each night I'm asleep when you're out on a 
spree,— 
'You come home in clover and you make me roll over, 
Then you jump into the warm place of Judy M'Gee.

THE IRISH EMIGR.A.NT"S LAMENT. 
'Twas all for your swats cake, dear Patrick McCree, 
'To better my fortune, I 
crossed the wide sea; 
.Sure I'd not have you marry a 
poor girl like me, 
So I'm here sail and lonely, dear Patrick MeCree. 
I'm rememberin' <balite, that dark ugly day, 
Whin I 
from ould Ireland wint sadly away ; 
'Tie long since we parted, far distant to be, 
But my heart niver left ye, mate Patrick MeCree. 
The cup fortune gives us, I 
think it is true, 
Has some big hole in it that lets the luck through.; 
It's mighty uncivil, that spite all my pains, 
The fun always runs out and the sorrow remains; 
But hope kke the stars, peeping down through the night, 
'Shall cheer my poor heart with its true faithful light, 
tell while it beckons me over the sea, 
To ould Ireland my country and Patrick McCrea. 
O'BLARNEY. 
PARODY. 
AIR—Kate Kearney. 
Oh! have you not limed of O'Blarney, 
Who came all the way from Killarney,. 
If you wear a 
black eye, 
Take a 
warning and fly. 
For a 
broth of a 
boy is O'Blarney. 
When the pooteen, that's whisky, is steaming, 
'Tis nought but of fighting he's dreaming. 
And, oeh, I 
can tell, 
Where mischief does dwell— 
The shillelah of Paddy O'Blarney. 
Then should you ere meet this O'Blarney, 
Who rode all on foot from Killarney, 
Beware of his smile, 
Mind your eye all the while, 
A shellelah has Paddy O'Blarney. 
Though he looks so bewitchingly simple, 
Och, faith, but he'd soon crack your pimple,. 
And should he inhale 
drop of the rale, 
Then's fatal thP blow of O'Blarney..

SHE IS FAR FROM THE LAND. 
She is from the land where her young hero sleeps, 
And lovers are round her sighing; 
But coldly she turns from their gaze and weeps, 
For her heart in his grave is lying— 
For her heart in his grave is lying. 
She sings the 
song of her dear native plains, 
Every note which he loved unchanging; 
Ah! little they think . who delight in her strains; 
flow the heart of the minstrel is breaking. 
He had lived for his love, for his country he died, 
They were all that to life had entwined him ; 
Nor soon shall the tears of his country be dried 
Nor long, will his love stay behind him. 
Oh, make her a 
grave where the sunbeams rest, 
'When they promise a 
glorious morrow; 
They'll smile o'er her sleep, like a 
smile from the West, 
From her own loved island of sorrow.

THE TWIG OF SHELALY 
Mulroony's my name, I'm a 
comical boy, 
A 
tight little lad at shelaly; 
St. Paddy wid whiskey he suelnea me, joy, 
f.Among the sweet bogs of Killaly ! 
The world I 
began with the prospect so fair, 
My dad was worth nothing, and I 
was his heirs 
So all my estate was a 
heart free from care, 
And a 
tight little twig of Shelaly. 
" 
Turn captain," cried dad, " and if nilt in de Etrife 
Success and long life to Shelaly ! 
Your fortune is made all the Test of yer life, 
As sure as there's bogs in Kelaly." 
But thirfks I, spite of what fame and glory bequeath, 
flow conceited I'd look 'in a 
fine laurel wreath. 
Wid my head in my mouth to stand picking my teeth, 
Wid a 
tight little twig of Shelaly. 
Yet firmly both Ireland and Americall 
The land of oak stick and shelaly ; 
For now those two sisters are man and wife made. 
As sure as there's bogs in Killaly. 
I'll still for their friends have a 
heart warm and true, 
To their foes give my hand, for what else can 1 
do ? 
Yes, I'll give 'ern my hand—but along wid it too, 
A 
tight little twig of Shelaly. 
NARY AVOURNEEN. 
Oh Mary, dear Mary, I've come back to thee, 
But cold is the welcome you now give to me. 
Is there not then in parting, or not in long years, 
Is there not in the absence—I've mourned thee in tears. 
For the gold of the stranger, I 
ye left thee in pain, 
For the jewel of hope, I've come back again; 
But it is only to meet like the dew-drops from' high, 
Where the sunbeam it left them, heart broken to die. 
Oh Mary, clear Mary, I've come 'back to thee, 
Oh give then, Avourneen, kind weloome to me. 
Oh Mary, dear Mary, oh turn not away, 
sure 'tis joking you are in the sunshine to-day ; 
Yet now it would be pleasant to meet with a 
smile, 
To show you were laughing and loving the while. 
Oh let me not lose all the dream of the past, 
The joy and true hope there where sunshine is cast; 
Let thy lamp be my light, and fll worship at its 'shrine. 
Till the heart it illumined be hushed in the dark night, 
Oh Mary, dear Mary, I've conic back to thee, 
Oh give then, Avourneen, kind welcome to me.

\ I'd choose to take things aisy, 
If I 
had but the power, 
My time rd spend so careless, 
From morn to midnight hour. 
And waking in the morning, 
Wid not a

Och, I

And so would Judy too. 
I

EILY NAVOURNEEN, THE ROSE OF ICILLARNYI 
Through Erin's green and bonny isle, 
From Coleraine to Killarney's waters, 
Each lovely haunt bath had its song, 
Of gallant sons and charming daughters. 
But 0 
I 
there is one sunny spot, 
To me more dear, more prized than any, 
Where first in loveliness sprung up 
The rose that blossoms in Killarney. 
CHORUS. 
The rose that blossoms in Killarney, blossoms in Killarney, 
The rose that blossoms in Killarney, blossoms in Killarney. 
I 
thought when first her eyes met mine, 
My peace, my heart, were gone forever; 
I 
did not dare to speak of love, 
For fear a 
breath the charm might sever : 
Her cheeks are like the rose of May, 
Her voice bath banished care from many 
No thought can wrong my bonny flower, 
The rose that blossoms in Killarney. 
The rose that blossoms, &e. 
THE IRISH SQUIRE. 
In the county KiMare, on a 
May morning fine, 
We were all of us born, of course at one time; 
/n a 
noble brick mansion saved out of the flood, 
And there's none in the county can boast better blood. 
From a 
race of old kings my ancestry begins, 
I'm the youngest of seven, and all of us twins. 
A 
finer domain, sure, than ours ne'er was seen, 
Rich valleys and hills clothed in emerald green, 
In the woods we all lived like a 
snug hive of bees, 
Till the blackguards one day they cut down all the trees. 
For high breeding to none, faith we'd yield in the least, 
And for whiskey and war we'd a 
natural taste. 
We'd a 
fine strong mild castle 'twas quite cannon proof; 
Till ould Cromwell ( the thief) he bombarded the roof; 
Besides fish -
ponds well stocked with live salmon and frogs, 
And a 
thousand green acres of beautiful bogs ! 
From a 
race of ould kings my ancestry begins, 
I'm the youngest of seven, and all of us twins. 
Then, of jewels and riches we had a 
fine store, 
There wa coal mines and ccrn fields, and all to the fore; 
But my grandmother's mother she lived in such state, 
That she swallowed all these and the family plate. 
From a 
race of old kings my ancestry begins, 
I'm the youngest of seven and all of us twins. 
We'd a 
fine stud of hunters, fine timber and logs; 
A 
huntsman in scarlet, and packs of fine dogs; 
With whiskey and wine sure we'd sup every night, 
And the next day for diversion we'd get up a 
fight. 
Sure for courage to no one we'd yield in the least, 
And for whiskey and war we'd a 
natural taste. 
Then to see us all mounted and dressed for the chase, 
In coats of red scarlet, strip't over with lace; 
Such a 
troop of bould boys sure there never was seen, 
For a 
feast, or a 
fight, or a 
jig on the green. 
For good breeding to none, faith, we'd yield in the least, 
And for whiskey and war we'd a 
natural taste. 
Then to stand by a 
friend, or contrive a 
neat plan, 
At a 
dance or a 
duel, faith I 
am the man ; 
I 
can drink with a 
friend till the liquor it spe'd, 
Then oblige him by fighting and breaking his head. 
From a 
race of ould kings faith my- ancestry begins, 
I'm the youngest of seven, and all of us twins.

SWATE CASTLE GARDEN. 
As sung by Bryant's Minstrels. 
When I 
landed at Swate Castle Garden, 
I'd just came from the say, 
In my pockets I 
had not a 
farthing, 
As I 
stepped out up the Broadway; 
I 
walked ,up to a 
lamp-lighter, 
The mystery for to unravel, 
His hair was cut short, like a 
fighter, 
So I 
shouldered my bundle and travellea. 
'CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the stars and the stripes, 
And the land where we never see fogs, 
if I 
hadn't come here, by the pipes, 
I'd been digging up turf in the bogs 
'Shnre the road it was dirty and sloppy, 
Until I 
came to a 
street they call Wall, 
A 
blackguard shouted, there goes a 
Croppy. 
Whin I 
kim to the big City Hall, 
I 
axed. a 
Dutch barber the way; 
He answered me dunder and blitzen, 
And a 
big old fat Yankee stepped out, 
And made me an American citizen. 
Hurrah for the Stan, •;,,
,,0 
The first time I 
wint out to Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm 
The Commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm. 
No, says I, I'll go back to New-York, 
Where the Politicks they are so pretty, 
Lave your Dutchmen stop here and work, 
But be jabers I'll stick to the City. 
Hurrah for the Stars, &e. 
Bad luck to that villain from Sligo, 
Shure he tould me his name it was Hubbs 
Re sould me a 
card for Chicago; 
Be my s 
jul, 'twas au ou d 
Jack of Clubs, 
But I 
musn't indub,e 
in reflections. 
What lye said isn't worthy of note, 
I'll be running for Sheriff next election, 
, So step up me brave boys, and vote. 
Hurrah for the Stars, &

PAT'S CURIOSITY 
Did you hear tell of Paddy's Museum,-
Its ancient and modern antiques? 
If not, when ye bear, yell see 'ern, 
Of their fame all old Ireland speaks„ 
I 
was always considered a 
lover 
Of antiqnities, sure from my birth,, 
And did somehow or other discover' 
What nobody else could on earth. 
crrours. 
So don't talk about Barnum's-Museum;-
If in passie'my house you will stop, 
There's things you'll be struck for to see 'ent 
In Paddy's curiosity shop. 
I've been twinty-nine times round the globe;-
And niver took sleep night or day 
I've had double the patience uv Job

Before iver the world was created.

Curiosity bore a 
young native of Erin, 
To view the gay banks of the Rhine, 
When an empress he saw, and the robe she was wearing 
All over with diamonds did shine; 
A 
goddess in splendor was never yet seen, 
To equal this fair one so mild and serene, 
In soft murmur she says, My sweet linnet so green, 
Are you gone—will I 
never see you more ? 
The cold lofty Alps you freely went over, 
Which Nature had placed in your way, 
That Marengo, Saloney, around you did hover, 
And Paris did rejoice the next day. 
It grieves me the hardships you did undergo, 
Over mountains you travelled all covered with snow. 
The balance of power your courage laid low, 
Are you gone, will I 
never see you more ? 
The crowned heads of Europe when you were in splendor, 
Fain would they have you submit 
But the Goddess of Freedom soon bid them surrender, 
And lowered the standard to your wit; 
Old Frederick's colors in France you did bring, 
Yet his offspring found shelter under your wing, 
That year in Virginia you sweetly did sing, 
Are you gone, will I 
never see you more ? 
That numbers of men are eager to slay you, 
Their malice you viewed witli a 
smile, 
Their gold through all Europe they sowed to betray you, 
And they joined the Mamelukes on the -Nile. 
Like ravens for blood their vile passions did burn, 
The orphans they slew, and caused the widow to mourn, 
They say my linnet's gone, and ne'er will return, 
Is he gone, will I 
never see him more ? 
When the trumpet of war the grand blast was sounding, 
You marched to the north with good will, 
To relieve the poor slave in their vile sack clothing, 
You used your exertion and skill 
You spread out the wings of your envied train, 
While tyrants great Cmsar's old nest set in flames, 
Their own subjects they caused to eat herbs on the plains, 
Are you gone, will I 
never see you more ? 
In great Waterloo, where numbers laid sprawling, 
In every field, high or low, 
Fame on her trumpets tliro' Frenchmen was calling, 
Fresh laurels to place on her brow. 
Usurpers did tremble to hear the loud call. 
The third old Babe's new buildings did fall, 
The Spaniards their fleet in the harbor did call, 
Are you gone, I 
will never see you more. 
I'll roam thro' the deserts of wild Abyssinia, 
And yet find no cure for my pain. 
Will I 
go and inquire in the isle of St. Helena, 
No, we will whisper in vain. 
Tell me, you critics, now tell me in time, 
The nation I 
will range my sweet linnet to find, 
Was he slain at Waterloo, on Elba on the Rhino? 
If he was I 
will never see him more.

MRS. 
MCLAUGHLIN'S PARTY. 
AIR: "The fair of Clogheen." 
OuId Ireland's is the place for a 
frolic, 
The boys and the girls are frisky; 
They never can feel melancoholic. 
They're the divils fbr tippling the whiskey, 
For a 
row or a 
ruction oh, 'norther! 
The boys they go in, strong and hearty. 
Now, I'll tell yez before I 
go further, 
Of Mrs. McLaughlin's party. 
CHORUS 
W 1100! it's welt the flure, Peter O'Dougherty; 
Shake your leg, Biddy McCarty; 
Dance to your partners, ye divils, 
At Mrs McLaughlin's party! 
Moll Dolan, a 
buxon young craythur, 
Had lately been raising me dandher; 
I 
met her going down, to McGuffin's, 
To borry the loan of a 
gandher. 
The gandher the geese had been coorting. 
She sould it to Paddy McCarty, 
To buy her a 
pair of white slippers, 
To go to McLaughlin's party. 
It's welt the flue, & c. 
For a 
week or two, I 
was preparing, 
Determined in style for to shank it. 
Put a 
pair of new tails to my coat, 
With a 
piece I 
cut off of the blanket; 
I 
turned the corduroy-breeches 
I 
borrowed from Phelim O'Flaherty, 
And I 
put a 
new patch on the sate, 
For to cut a 
big swell, at the party. 
'It's welt the flare, cte. 
They hired a 
fiddler and piper, 
And stuck them on top of a 
barrel, 
With a 
jug full of whiskey between'em, 
To keep them from having a 
quarrel,

DIRS. MCLAtrGaLIN'S PARTY. [CONCLUDED. 
When the piper struck up Garyowen, 
Faixl the fiddler another tune started; 
And they welted the soles off their brogues, 
Whoo I 
at Mrs. McLaughlin's party. 
It's welt the flure, &a. 
Tim Fagan got up for a 
reel, 
But he jigged it on every one's corns. 
To try for to stop him was worse 
Than to take a 
mad bull by the horns. 
He skinned Dinny Haggeity's shins, ' 
Tore the skirts off Winny O'Doherty, 
And exposed the dear craythur's fat limbs 
To all the gay boys, at the party. 
It's welt the flure, 6;c. 
Now, while they were dancing and jigging, 
Tom Cassidy burst in the dure, sir; 
Thin, the ducks and the dlirakes and the pigs, 
They came all flying in on the flare, sir I 
The ould sow it set up a

,The girls laughed merry and hearty, 
While the pig balangayed down the middle, 
At Mrs. McLaughlin's party. 
It's welt the flure, &c. 
Thin the party was brought to an ending. 
The fiddler fell drunk from the table; 
They carried him home on a

Tore off the dure of the stable.

PETTICOAT LANE. 
When to Dublin I 
came from the sweet County Down, 
I 
called on a 
friend, for to show me the town; 
He brought me thro' streets, lanes, and alleys so grand, 
my brogues were most wore, and I 
scarcely could stand. 
He show'd me fine houses, were built up so high, 
And a 
man made of stone, almost up to the sky; 
But the names of them places went out of my brain, 
Except one, and he said it was, Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to, & c. 
Convenient to Petticoat Lane there's a 
place, 
And as we walked through it, we couldn't get peace; 
The shops were all full of fine clothes black and blue, 
But the fellows outside nearly tore me in two; 
One dragged me this way, to get a 
good frieze, 
Another had corduroy breeches, my size: 
But one chap bawls out, when I 
wouldn't remain, 
Show him up to the college in Petticoat Lane I 
i-to, 
We got lose from this spot, myself and my friend, 
I 
couldn't do less than a 
teaster to spend, 
But we spied boys and girls in a 
laughable group, 
Sitting cross-legged, and they licking up soup. 
Says I, are these what you call your poor-house recruits? 
Ax the divil, says one, and his bowl at me shoots. 
They roared with pleasure, while I 
roared with pain, 
Arrah. Paddy, you're welcome to Petticoat Lane! 
My friend thought to drag me away by the sleeve, 
When a 
tartar dropt over my head, an old sieve; 
I 
turned for to strike her, but got in the eye 
A 
plaster of what cu.;,-; 
called, hot-mutton pie ! 
I 
kept groping about, like a 
man that was blind, 
Till I 
caught hould of somebody coming behind: 
I 
prayed that I 
might get the strength of a 
CAIN, 
To be AuLE to whale him in Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to, & c. 
&c.

PETTICOAT LANE.—[coNcLunED.] 
walloped away, and I 
got walloped, too, 
While all sorts of ructions were raised by the crew; 
You would swear it was raining brick-bats and stones, 
Till I 
heard my antagonist giving some groans: 
Run and be damn'd to you I 
some one did cry, 
Stire, I 
can't ta‘ the mutton that's stuck in my eye 
I 
was led through the crowd, and heard somebody saying, 
There's a 
peeler most kill'd, up in Petticoat Lane. 
Ri to, iko. 
• 
These words like a 
thunderbolt, fell on my ear, 
So, I 
scooped all the fat from my eye, pretty clear; 
Aly friend tould the crowd that was round, to be mute 
While we slipped to a 
house, called, the sign of a 
boot; 
There I 
call'd for a 
sup, and we both took- a 
seat, 
Two or three that had backed us, came in for a 
treat— 
'''When the reckoning was called for, my pockets were clean; 
For pounds, shillings, and pence were in Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to, &c. 
The reck'ning it came to a 
hog and a 
groat, 
For which the landlord he took the lend of my coat; 
1 
started without, still cursing the town, 
When a 
policeman's pot-stick made friends with my crown. 
.ttys he: You have killed C. 106.— 
Arrah, be aisy, sir I 
I 
want none of your tricks. 
But the sergeant and twenty more swore it was plain 
That I 
was the bully of Petticoat Lane. 
Ri to, &e. 
They all swarmed about me, like flies on a 
cask; 
But to prison to take me was no easy task. 
When I 
got there, I 
was charged with the crime; 
"f was my own brother Darby I 
bate alt the time. 
When he seen me, he iet out a 
thundering curse 
On the day that he filet went to join in the force; 
He released my ould coat and ne got me off clean, 
To go home and say prayers for sweet Petticoat Lane.

IltISit MOLLY, 0! 
As I 
walked out one morning, all in the month of May, 
I 
met a 
pretty Irish girl, and thus to her did say, 
I 
put my hand into my pocket, as it happened so, 
And pulled out a 
guinea to treat my Irish Molly, 0

She is yonng, she is beautiful, she is the fairest one I 
know, 
The primrose of Ireland, before my guinea go, 
And the only one that entices me, is my Irish Molly, 0. 
I 
said, my pretty fair maid, will you go along with me, 
I 
will show you the straip,-ht way across the country; 
My parents would be angry, if they should come to know, 
They will lay all the blame on my Scotch laddie, 0.

That she had been courted by a 
Scotch laddie, 0.

if you court my daughter Mary I 
will send you far away. 
She is young, & a. 
Since Molly has deceived me, all by her father's wave, 
Through some lone woods and valleys it's there I'll spend my 
days, 
Like some poor forlorn pilgrim I'll wander to and fro, 
It is all for the sake of my Irish Molly, 0. 
She is young, ctc. 
There Is a

She is young, fkc. 
When that I 
am buried there is one thing more I 
crave, 
To lay a 
marble tomb-stone at the head of my grave, 
And on this tomb-stone a 
prayer Shall be said,. 
That young M'Donald lies here for his young Irish maid. 
She is young, & c. 
Come all you pretty fair maids a 
warning take by me, 
And never build a 
nest at the top of any tree; 
For the green leaves will wither and the root it will decay, 
And the beauty of a 
fair maid will soon fade away.

JOHNNY DOYLE. 
am a 
fair maiden, all tangled in love; 
My case I 
will make known to the great God above; 
I 
thought it a 
credit, vet I 
fear it a 
crime 
For to roam the world all over for you, Johnny Doyle. 
It was Saturday evening we made up the plan, 
it was early Monday morning to take a 
trip along; 
My 
waiting-maid was standing by, as you can plainly see, 
She slipped in unto my mamma, and told upon me. 
MY mamma she conducted me into a 
bed-room high, 
Where she knew no one could hear me nor pity my cry; 
She bundled up my clothes, and she bid me begone, 
For she knew well in her heart, that I 
loved that young man. 
A horse and side-saddle my father did provide, 
In hopes to get me married and be young Somers' bride ; 
A horse and side-saddle my father aid prepare, 
With six noble footmen to wait on me there. 
So we rode all along till we came to Belfast town, 
Our horses being stabled and footmen seated down; 
'While they were at their merrimentj had my own toil, 
For my heart it lie at home with my young Johnny Doyle. 
13y my eldest brother I 
was conducted home, 
My mamma she conducted me into my own bedroom 5 
My own bed being the softest, my head I 
did lie down, 
For to seek consoling sorrow, my body it was found. 
Now close the door, dear mamma, don't you let Somers in, 
Now close the door, dear mamma, don't you let Somers in ; 
For to-night is the night that he means to enstrive, 
But he'll never gain the girl that is intended for his bride. 
When she saw the minister coming in the door, 
IIer ear-rings, they bursted and fell upon the floor; 
The gold ring on her finger, in a 
hundred pieces did fly, 
And her stomacher, it bursted, and death was drawing nigh. 
I 
will send for Johnny Doyle for you, my own darling child, 
I 
will send for ,Johnny Doyle for you, my own heart's delight ; 
Yes, you'll send for Johnny Doyle, mamma, but I 
fear it is too late 
For death, it is coming, and sad is my fate. 
Now death, you are coming; you are welcome to me, 
From the pains of love, I'm sure, you'll set me free ; 
There is more trouble on my mina than my poor tongue can tell. 
And these are my dying words: Johnny Doyle, fare you well. 
The day of her funeral, it was a 
great eight, . 
There were four-and-twenty fair maidens, all dressed in white, 
They carried her to St. Mary's ground, and laid her in the clay; 7, 
Saying: The Lord, lb may be with you forever and a 
day 
MAGINNIS'S RAFFLE,

bit of a

While for company's sake, in me fist did I 
take 
Me mild country blackthorn shillaly. 
Going through Cherry street, there who should I 
meet 
But me ould countryman, Larry McGaffle; 
"

A ticket to go to a

Wid fat Mrs. Byrnes an' her daughter;

The prize, you must know, is a 
fiddle an' bow, 
'Twos presented to Misther Tim Whaffle; 
The chairman is he iv the grand committee, 
On Mickey Maginuis's raffle. 
Siz I, " Larry, begor, wiL you tell me who it's for, 
Nor me mind wid wild fancies bewildher," 
"'Tis to bring out," siz he, " from the ould courithry

He'd a

All me powers of description 'twould baffle;

HERE STANDS A YOUNG MAN.—[CoNcLunED.1 
I've made love to all the nice girls in our street, 
Jemima so charming, and Susan so sweet, 
But they turn up their noses, and all of 'em treat 
Me, somehow, remarkably cool ; 
When I 
speak to Miss Jenny she always looks black, 
While Jane often gives me an unpleasant whack, 
And Mary Ann chalks a 
large D 
on my back, 
While Caroline calls me a 
fool. 
Spoken—Never mind, it takes a 
clever man to be a 
fool; my 
pa was a 
clever man, and ma says I'm just like him, so here's a 
chance for the ladies—Cnos.us, as before. 
When Christmas comes round, oh, that's the go— 
Then I 
kiss the girls under the mistletoe; 
I 
last time fell in love with a 
dozen or so, 
And told them I 
wanted a 
wife: 
I 
asked one fair creature if she'd fly away 
With me, and be married the very next day,— 
She told her papa, and, I'm sorry to say, 
He near frightened me out of my life. 
Spoken—The enraged old buffer threatened to throw me out of 
the window, and her brother had the audacity to pull my nose I 
and, to add insult to injury, he called me a 
nincompoop; but I 
don't care—Cuoaus, as before. 
If any young woman should want a 
young man, 
Oh, please send her to me as fast as you can,— 
If she thinks I'll suit her I'll put up the banns 
So that we can be married off soon; 
She shall have all my money, go on a 
tour, 
We'll go to the church in a 
carriage and four, 
She shall do as she pleases—I 
cannot say more— 
How I 
long for the sweet honeymoon 1 
Spoken—Yes, and after we're married, if she don't like me she 
can go home to her mother again; I 
can't say fairer than that, 
can I 
I 
so—Cnoau -

BILLY O'ROURKE. 
Faith, I 
grased my brogues and took my stick the twentieth day 
of May, sirs, 
Then off to Dublin town I 
tripped to work upon the sea, sirs, 
To see if I 
could get employ to cut their hay and corn, sirs, 
To pick up pence upon the sea the cockneys I 
might lam, sirs. 
CHORUS. 
With my phillaloo and heart so true, 
Arrah! Billy Oltourke's the Boy sure. 
I 
gave the captain six thirteens, to carry me o'er to Porgate, 
But before we got half of the road the wind it blew at a 
hard rate; 
The sticks that grew up through the ship they sang out like a 
whistle, 
And the sailors all, both great and small, they swore we's going 
to the devil. 
With my phillaloo, (tc. 
The ship she sang us all to sleep till they came to the place of

IRISH SCHOOLMASTER. 
Old Teddy O'Itonrke kept a 
bit of a 
school 
At a 
place called Clarina, and made it a 
rule, 
If the mind wouldn't mark, faith he d 
soon mark ths back, 
And he'd give them their own with a 
devil/Ai crack. 
His scholars were: Jerry, Big Billy, and Ned,

To kick up a

Faith. Ted had a 
nose as big as a 
ton, 
And a 
chin, too! och honey, but they were all one; 
A. grin, too, lie had, and if there was a 
noise, 
he'd just give a 
squint and frighten the boys; 
A fortune he had, too :— his birch and his wig, 
A black, ugly cow, and an old dirty pig, 
A 
pretty plantation, a 
dog and a 
cat. 
And his head that he kept in an old greasy hat. 
SPOKEN.—Phelim O'llaheney, says he, one day, before you sit down,

PADDY IYIILES.' 
From the big town of Limerick lately I 
came, 
I 
left Ireland solely bekase of my name, 
For if anything wint wrong, or a 
mischief ' twits done, — 
Shure they'd have all the blame on my mother's own son. 
So my name now is Paddy O'Connor, 
'Pon an Irishman's throe word and honor, 
Oh, misfortnue my curse light upon her, 
'Twas he christened me Paddy Miles. 
If a 
windy was broke, or a 
house robbed of tiles, 
And you'd ax who done that, shure they'd say Paddy Miles; 
Who was it set tire to his reverence's wig, 
And cut the tail of Pat Flanig,-an's pig. 
Who called llishes Moloney a 
scollop, 
And gave Biddy McGee's cat the jallop, 
Seine blackguards would hit me a 
wollop, 
And say it was you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
worked in the bogs and behaved, as I 
thought, 
From my master Mick Flynn, a 
character brought, 
lint it done me no good, and I 
thought that was odd, 
So I 
made up my mind for to leave the mild sod. 
For the devil a 
wan would employ me, 
The girls there they would annoy me, 
They threatened at once to destroy me, 
bskase I 
was called Paddy Miles. 
Vim cut off one of the tails of Pat Fineg,an's coat, 
And who broke the left horn of Ned Shoughnessy's goat,, 
Who through the back door to the chapel got in, 
And drank all the wine, blood and ounds what a 
sin,: 
Who half-inurdermi a 
poor-house inspector, 
And fired at a 
polioe detector, 
When ALists Fagan they tried to eject her, 
Who was it, but you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
trotted to Dublin to look for a 
place, 
Tho' they'd ne'er saw inc there, faix, they all knew ml 
The jaekeens kept calling meself to annoy, 
There's goes Paddy Miles, he's a 
Limerick boy. 
Till I 
fionrish my sprig of shillalah, 
An' smattered their gobs so genteelly, 
When the blood it began to flow freely, 
Said I, how do you like Paddy Miles. 
In short, before long to this country I 
came, 
An' found Paddy Miles here was the same; 
If my name "wasn't clanged I 
was likely to starve, 
For bad luck to the master could I 
sarve. 
So Paddy O'Connor it is made, sir, 
An' if you want to get a 
smart blade, sir, 
Be my soul then you need not he afraid, sir, 
For to hire me, I'm not Paddy Miles.

PADDY ON THE CANAL. 
When I 
landed in sweet Philadelphia, the weather was pleq.sant and 
clear; 
I 
did not stay long in the city, so quickly I 
shall let you hear. 
I 
did not stay long in the city, for it happened to be in the fall, 
I 
never reefed a 
sail in my rigging, ' till I 
anchored out on the marl, 
CHORUS. 
So fare you well, father and mother, 
Likewise to old Ireland too ; 
So fare you well, sister and brother, 
So kindly 
bid you adieu, 
*When I 
came to this wonderful empire, it filled me with the greatest 
surprise, 
To see such a 
great undertaking, on the like I 
never Opened my eyes, 
To see full a 
thousand brave fellows at work among mountains so tall, 
To dig through the vallies so level, through rocks for to cut a 
canal,. 
So fare you well, & c. 
I 
entered with them for a 
season, my monthly pay for to draw, 
And being in very good humor, I 
often sang Erin go bragh ; 
Our provision it was very plenty, to complain we'd no reason at all; 
I 
had money in every pocket, while working upon the canal, 
So faro you well, & e. 
I 
learned for to be very handy, to use both the shovel and spade; 
I 
learnt the whole art of canalling, I 
think it an excellent trade. 
I 
learned to be very bandy, although I 
was not very tall, 
I 
could handle the sprig of shillalah with the best man on the canal, 
So fare you well, & c. 
I 
being an entire stranger, be sure I 
had not much to say; 
The boss came round in a 
hurry, says, Boys, it is greg-time.a-day. 
We all marched up in good order. he was father now unto us all ; 
Sure, I 
wished myself from that moment to be working upon the cantsl. 
So faro you well, 64c. - 
When at night we all rest from our labor, be sure but our rent is all 
paid, 
We laid down our pick and our shovel, likewise our axe and our spado ; 
We all set a 
joking together, there was nothing our minds to enthral ; 
If happiness be in ads wide world, I 
tue sure it is on the canal. 
So fare you well, &e. 
RORY O'B1ORE. 
Young Rory (More courted Kathleen Bawn, 
lie was bold as the hawk,- she as soft as the fawn, 
lie wished in his heart pretty Kathleen to please, 
And he thought the best way to do that, was to tease. 
" 
Now, Rory, be aisy," sweet Kathleen would cry, 
Reproof on her lip but a 
smile in her eye; 
" 
With your tricks I 
don't know, in troth, what I'm about, 
Faith you've teased till've put on my cloak inside out." 
Oh, jewel," says Rory, ' that same is the way 
'You've treated my heart this many a 
day, 
And 'tis pleased that I 
am, and why not, to IDe sure ? 
For 'tis all for good luck," says bold Rory ° More. 
"Indeed, then," says Kathleen, " don't think of the like, 
For I 
half gave a 
promise to soothering Mike; 
The ground that I 
walk on he loves 1'11 be bound," 
" 
Faith," says Rory, " I'd rather love you than the ground.", 
" 
Now, Rory, I'll cry it you don't let me go, 
Sure I 
dream every night that Via hating you so!" 
Says Rory. " That same I'm delighted to hear, 
For dreams always go by contraries, my dear; 
Oh! jewel! keep dreaming that same till you die, 
And bright morning will give dirty night the black lie; 
And 'tis pleased that I 
am, and why not, to be sure? 
Since ' tis all for good luck,' says bold Rory O'More. 
" 
Oh Kathleen, my darling, you've teased me enough, 
I've thrashed for your sake Denny Grimes and Jim Duff, 
And l've made myself drinking your health quite a 
beast, 
So I 
think after that I 
may talk to the priest 1" 
Then Rory, the rogue, stole his hand round her neck, 
So soft and so white, without freckle or speck, 
And he looked in her eyes that were beaming with light. 
And kiss'd her sweet lips, dont you think he was right ? 
"Now, Rory. leave off, sir, you'll bug me no more, 
That's eight times times to-day that you've kiss'd me before." 
Then .liere goes another," says he, - to make sure, 
For there's luck in odd numbers." says Rory O'More.

WATERFORD BOYS. 
AIR :—" The Flaming anannigans." 
Well, boys, for divarsion, we all met together; 
I'll tell you how from Waterford hither I 
came; 
I 
left that dear city in dark, gloomy weather, 
My heart it was light, and my pockets the same. 
I 
lilted a 
song as I 
tripped it along; 
By the road-side a 
tavern I 
happened to spy, 
And, as I 
was meltin', my pockets I 
felt in 
For the price of a 
drink; I 
was mortally dry. 
CIIORUS. 
But we are the boys for fun, wit, and element, 
Drinking, and dancing, and all other joys, 
Ructions, destruction, divarsion, and devilment; 
Who can compare with the Waterford Boys ? 
In the tavern I 
strolled, out the landlord he rolled; 
Good mornin', says he. 
Says I: If you please, 
Could you shake me a 
bed, but first bring some bread, 
With a 
bottle of porter and small lump of cheese ? 
For, times they are queer, and provisions are dear; 
If you cannot get meat, with cheese be content. 
Says the landlord: You're right, as he brought me the bite; 
So, I 
rolled up my sleeves and at it I 
went. 
We are the boys, &c. 
My bread and cheese ended, I 
then condescended 
To seek my repose: so, I 
bade 'em good-night. 
Soon under the clothes I 
was trying to doze, 
But first popped in my toes, and then popped out the light. 
Not long was I 
sleeping, I 
heard something creeping, 
And meandering, and scratching about the bed-post.

WATERFORD BOYS.—[CONCLUDED.] 
My breath I 
suspended, but the noise never ended: 
Thinks I: ye have mighty long claws for a 
ghost ! 
We are the boys, &c. 
The row it commences: near out of my senses, 
I 
ventured to peep from beneath the bed-clothes. 
Mffla murther! what's that ? 'Twas a 
big black jack rat, 
With a 
leap from the ficor, came a 
top of my nose. 
Divil swape ye! says I, for a 
scheming ould vagabone; 
Take that, and that. 
I 
jumped on the floor; 
Oh! Moses; blue fire, Biddy I 
Sophia 
The rats they are eating me up by the score ! 
We are the boys, &e. 
The landlord affrightened, he then brought a 
light in. 
Says I: I'm near dead, it's time I'm away; 
Says he: Before going, I'd have ye be knowing, 
For supper and bed you've five shillings to pay. 
Five shillings ! for what ? Now, don't be disgracing 
Yourself as a 
rogue, says I, if you please; 
When I 
can't sleep for rats, you've the divil's own face on ye, 
To charge me five shillings for plain bread and cheese! 
We are the boys, &c. 
Says he: Och ! those rats, I 
wish they would leave me, 
They ruin my trade. 
I'm not worth a 
rap. 
Says I: The five shillings now would you forgive me, 
If I 
tell you the way to keep out every rat ? 
I 
will.—Says I: Then to supper invite them, 
And plain bread and cheese set before them, be sure, 
Don't mind if they're willing, but charge them five shillings, 
Bad luck to the rat that yell ever see more 
We are the boys, &e.

TEDDY O'NEALE. 
rve come to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As neat a 
mud palace /
IS ever was seen; 
And consid'ring it served to keep poultry and pigs in, 
I'M sure it was always most elegant clean. 
But now all about it seems lonely and dreary, 
All sad and silent, no piper, no reel; 
Not even the sun, through the casement, is cheery, 
Since 1 
missed the dear darling boy, Teddy &Neale, 
I 
dreamt but last night—oh, bad luck to my dreaming! 
I'd die if I 
thought ` twould come truly to pass— 
But I 
dreamt, white tears down my pillow were streaming. 
That Teddy was courtin' another fair lass ; 
Oh ! didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing, 
The grief of that thought was too deep to conceal ; 
ISly mother cried—" Norah, child, what is your ailing?" 
And all I 
could utter was—" Teddy &Neale." 
Shall I 
never forget when the big ship was ready, 
And the moment was come when my love must depart 
how 1 
sobbed like a 
spalpeen, " Good-by to you Teddy," 
With drops on my cheek and a 
stone at my heart. 
IIe says ' us to better his fortune he's roving, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel 
If I 
saw him come back to me, honest and loving, 
. Still poor, but my own darling, Teddy O'Neale.

RAGGED PAT. 
A IR: " 
Lather and Shave." 
Now, all you young gents to my song lend your ear; 
'Tis about a 
poor Irishman whose name was Pat Clere: 
His clothes were all patches, and torn was his hat, 
So they called hint the name of Poor Ragged Pat. 
Oh, boy, paddy awack 
A 
cat won't catch mice if put in a 
sack. 
On Sunday at church, his coat was of black, 
'With a 
big ivory button sewed into its back, 
And his breeches were blue, the cloth very coarse, 
he'd look like a 
clown, if he sat on a 
horse. 
Oh, boy, paddy, &T. 
Now, this gent Ragged Pat, although he was poor, 
Sickness, no matter what sort he could cure: 
With a 
measure of oats, another of grass, 
lie could take away glanders from any jackass. 
Oh, boy, paddy, & c. 
Ms eves they were black, and his voice was so sweet, 
Ile stood up for the laws, and on Friday eat meat ; 
On the Sabbath at church he'd sure shut his eyes, 
With his big mouth wide open as if catching flies. 
Oh, boy, paddy, dre. 
As you gave close attention, I'll here end my song, 
Although full of patho.:, vet not very long: 
In the elm chyard of Erin far under the sod, 
Lies poor Ragged Pat, but trustful in God. 
Oh, boy, paddy, &-e.

PRETTY MAID MILKING HER COW. 
It being on a 
fine summer's morning, as birds sweetly tuned on 
each bough, 
I 
heard a 
fair maid sing most charming, as she sat a 
milking her 
cow. 
Her voice was enchanting, melodious, which left me scarce able to 
go; 
My heart it was soothed in solace, by the pretty maid milking her 
cow. 
With courtesy I 
did salute her—good morrow most amiable maid ; 
I 
am your captive slave for the future. 
Kind sir, do not banter, 
she said ; 
I 
am not such a 
precious rare jewel that I 
should enamor you ; 
I 
am but a 
plain country girl, said this pretty maid milking her 
cow. 
The Indies afford no such jewel, so precious and transparent clear, 
Oh, do not refuse to be my jewel; but consent and hive me, my 
dear ; 
Take pity and grant my desire, and leave me no longer in woe; 
Oh, love me or else I'll expire, sweet colleen Dhas cruthin amoe. 
I 
don't understand what you mean, sir, I 
never was a 
slave yet to 
love— 
These emotions I 
cannot experience, so I 
pray, these affections 
remove ; 
To marry, 1 
can assure you, that state I 
will not undergo, 
So, young man, I 
pray you will excuse me—said this pretty maid 
milking her cow. 
Had I 
the wealth of great Omar, or all on the African shore 
Or had I 
great Devonshire's treasure, or had I 
ten thousand times 
more, 
Or had I 
the lamp of Alladin, and had I 
his genii also, 
I'd rather live poor on a 
mountain, with colleen Dhas cruthin 
amoe. 
I 
beg you withdraw, and do not tease me; I 
cannot consent unto 
thee ; 
I 
prefer to live single and airy till more of the world I 
see. 
New cares they would me embarrass, beside, sir, my fortune is 
low, 
Until I 
get rich, I'll not marry, said the colleen Dhas cruthin amoe. 
A 
young maid is like a 
ship sailing, she don't know how long she 
may steer ; 
For in every blast she is in danger, so consent, and love me, my 
dear. 
For riches, I 
care not a 
farthing; your affection I 
want, and no 
more ; 
In wedlock I 
wish to bind you, sweet colleen Dhas cruthin amoe.

KATHLEEN (MOORE. 
My 
love, still I 
think that I 
see her once more,' 
But alas I 
she has left me her loss to deplore, 
My own little Kathleen, my poor lost Kathleen, 
My Kathleen 011oom. 
Her hair glossy black, her eves were dark blue, 
Her color still changing, her smiles ever new: 
So pretty was Kathleen, my sweet little Kathleen, 
My Kathleen O'Moore. 
She milked the dun cow that ne'er offered to stir, 
Though wicked it was, it was gentle to her; 
So kind was my Kathleen, my poor little Kathleen, 
My Kathleen O'Moore. 
She sat by the door one cold afternoon, 
To hear the wind blow, and look at the moon, 
So pensive was Kathleen, my poor little Kathleen, 
My Kathleen O'Moore 
0 cold was the night breeze that sighed round her bower, 
It chill'd my poor Kathleen, she drooped from that hour, 
And / lost my poor Kathleen, my dear little Kathleen, 
My Kathleen O'Moore.

On St. Patrick's day, in the morning. 
How they nursed me with joy; said : what a 
fine boy! 
Put a

toy ; 
Faith 1 
there's no mistake, they admired my make, 
And said some day I'd give the girls a

At a

He will fight foe or friend, if they do him offend; 
Let the piper strike up, he will rise from his cup, 
With a 
smile on his face adorning. 
With his little Colleen, he'll dance on the green, 
Sure, an Irishman, there, in his glory was seen 
Play a 
reel or jig, he don't care a

But he'll dance till day-light, in the morning. 
For, Paddy is the boy,

Long, long, may it stand, and good luck to the land,

May the girls, young and old, may the boys, brave and

Ycu're looking as bright as the day; 
But while on your charms I'm dilating, 
You're stealing my poor heart away; 
But keep it and welcome, mavourneen, 
Its loss I'm not going to mourn, 
Yet one heart's enough for a 
body, 
So pray give me yours in return, 
Mavourneen, mavourneen, 
Oh ! pray give yours in return. 
I've built me a 
neat little cot, darling, 
I've pigs and potatoes in store; 
I've twenty good pounds in the bank, love, 
And may be a 
pound or two more. 
It's all very vell to have riches, 
But I'm such a 
covetous elf, 
I 
can't help still sighing for something, 
And, darling, that's something's yourself, 
Mavourneen, tnavourneen, 
And that something, you know, is yourself. 
You're smiling, and that's a 
good sign, darling, 
Say " Yes," and you'll never repent, 
Or, if you would rather be silent, 
Your silence I'll take for consent. 
That good natured dimple's a 
tell-tale, 
Now all that I 
have is your own, 
This week you may be Kitty Tyrrell, 
Next week you'll be Mistress Malone, 
Mavourneen, mavourneen, 
You'll be my own Mistress lalone.

FATTIER TOM O'NEIL. 
PART FIRST. 
There was a 
widow lived in this place, she had three charming 
sons; 
Their father died, and left them when they were very young. 
A hue, time she endeavored to maintain her darline. sens, - 
Until the youngest one became a 
man at the age of twenty-one. 
One night, he discoursed with his mother, these words to her did 
say : 
I 
think it will fall on one of us to go far away; 
Your hind is too small to support us all, and if you would agree, 
1 
am fully bent and well content a 
clergyman to be. 
His mother being glad to hear such a 
thought come in his mind,. 
She says, I 
will do all I 
can to help my darling child. 
She spoke unto his brothers, and they did soon agree 
They'd send him off to college, a 
clergyman to be-. 
Ile was not long in college, when the Rev. Bishop Brown 
Came to examine the collegians, and viewed them all around. 
Ile saw this clever young man, marked him above them all, 
lie was the first he did discourse when on them he did call. 
He says: Young man, where are you from? come tell to me your 
name. 
I 
am from the County Armagh, they call me Tom O'Neil; 
INT y 
mother, she is a 
widow of a 
low degree; 
She has done her best endeavors to make a 
priest of me. 
As Thomas O'Neil then is your name, the Bishop he did say, 
Go study hard, both night and day ; 
1 
will have you soon ordained, to help your tender mother that did 
so well for thee; 
will semi you home, a 
credit your country boys to see. 
'When this young man came home ordained, the neighbors were 
glad to hear, 
And all that came to welcome him, came in twos and threes; 
Particularly his own dear friend 7 
to welcome him they ran, 
And you never saw such welcome as was for the widow's son. 
There was a 
man lived in this place, he was as rich as a 
Duke or. 
K 
night ; 
He had an only &molder, she was a 
beauty bright. 
She s:iv s 
unto her father ; I 
will go this young man to. see., 
For before he went to college he was a 
school- boy along with me_ 
She was brought into a 
parlor, where she drank ale and wine; 
She says: You are a 
clever young man, I 
would have you resignx. 
What made you be a 
clergyman you know von are astray; 
For a 
clergyman must rise by night, and travel hard by day. 
Come, take sonic noble lady, whose fortune will be grand ; 
You will have men to wait on you, and be a 
gentleman. 
Come, take myself, now, as I 
stand; you know my fortune is great ; 
1have ten thousand pounds a- year, and, at a 
death, a 
whole estate-. 
41 
'FATHER TON O'NEIL. 
PART SECOND AND LAST. 
Tie says: My noble lady, do not explain your mind; 
For, if you offer ten times more, I 
would not resign; 
For, in this holy station I 
mean to lead my life ; 
So, say no more, my dearest dear, I 
will never take a 
wife. 
ft was when he did deny her, this villain she came home: 
And in eight weeks after, her secret she let know: 
She swore, before the magistrate, that he did her beguile, 
And for four long weeks, before she went to him, she was with 
child. 
The mlrning of his trial, it grieved our hearts full sore 
To see his tender mother: It grieved her ten tunes more 
To see her son, a 
clergyman , his age about twenty-three, 
To be cut down, in his prime, by cruel perjury. 
Now, Torn, what is the reason you don't marry this fair ? 
I 
think she is a 
companion for a 
duke. I 
declare: 
What are you, but a 
widow's sou, that is both poor and mean ? 
You might think it a 
great honor such a 
lady to obtain ! 
Then Father Torn stood up and said: I 
have no witness here: 
I 
call on the Ahnighty and he will make me clear: 
I 
never said I 
would marry her, or make her my wife; 
For, I 
neve.: knew a 
female from a 
man in all my life. 
Now, Torn, as you won't marry her, I 
will give you to understand: 
Seven long years transportation into Van Dietnan's Laud: 
That is bad, but it might be worse. 
Then Father Tom did say 
Our Savior suffered more than that, when he died on calvary. 
These words were hardly spoken, when a 
horse came as swift as 
wind, 
And on him came a 
rider, saying: I 
was not here in time 
call that trial over again, I 
am here that can reply: 
She wants two fathers for her child: that's Father Tom and I. 
I 
can tell the very moment, likewise the very spot. 
She gave me ten thousand pounds the night the child was got. 
She said she would give me a 
thousand more, if I 
would not let on 
She wants to make a 
husband of the Right Reverend Father Tom I 
Then, Father Tom put on his hat, and then began to smile; 
He says unto his mother' you see how God assists your child I 
They looked on one another, when they found her perjury ; 
The villain was found guilty, and his Reverence came home fre9, 
4 `; 
LATHER AND SHAVE, 
It was in this city not far from this spot, 
Where a 
barber he opened a 
snug little shop, 
lie was silent and sad but his smile was so sweet; 
That he pulled every body out of the street. 
CHORUS. 
With his lather and shave ' em, lather and shave 'em, 
Lather and shave ' ern, frizzle 'em burn. 
One horrid bad custom he thought he would stop, 
That no one for credit should come to his 6hop, 
So he got him a 
razor full of notches and rust, 
To shave the poor devils who came there for trust. 
With his lather and shave, & e. 
One day a 
poor Irishman passed by that way, 
Whose beard had been growing for many a 
day; 
He looked at the barber and put down his hod. • 
Will you trust me a 
shave for the pure love of God! 
With his lather and shave, & e. 
Walk in, says the barber, sit down on that chair, 
I'll soon mow your beard off right down to a 
hair. 
So his lather he spread over Paddy's big chin, 
And with his trust razor to shave did begin. 
With his lather and shave, & c. 
Och murther, says Paddy, now what are you doing, 
Leave off wid your tricks or me jaws you will ruin. 
Faith now how would you like to be shaved with a 
saw ; 
Be the powers you'll pull every tooth out o' me jaw. 
With his lather and shave, d:c. 
Still, still, says the barber, and dont make a 
din; 
With moving your jaws I'll be cutting your chin. 
Not cut but sawed, Och that razor you've got, 
Sure it wouldn't cut butter if it wasn't made hot. 
With his lather and shave&c. 
Now lave. off yer tricks and don't shave any more, 
And Paddy he bolted straight out of the door. 
Crying ye may lather and shave all yer friends till yer sick 
But be Jabers I'd rather be shaved with a 
brick. 
With your lather and shave, tke. 
Not long after that Pat was passing the door, 
When a 
jackass he set up a 
terrible roar. 
Och murther, says Paddy, just list to yon knave, 
He's givin some poor devil a-love- a'-God shave. 
With his lather and shave, &e, 
THE LADS WHO LIVE IN IRELAND: 
OR, WHERE THE APPLE PRACIES GROW, 
My name is Ned O'Manney, I 
was born in sweet Killarney; 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plough, reap or mow; 
And, if I 
met a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd lilre to know: 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show: 
Oh ! I'm of the O's and Mac's, and likewise the sturdy Whacks, 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Pratles grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree: 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name has a 
Mae or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan: 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show : 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid; 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, &c. 
May Heaven still protect our hospitable Country. 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow I 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely bay of Bantry ! 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show. 
Oh I 
those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, & c. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man in truth, was he; 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow ; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go : 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be: 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show ; 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found. 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, (ire.

He is gone, and I'm now sad and lonely, 
He has left me to cross the wide sea, 
But I

And will soon be returning to me. 
His eyes they were filled with devotion, 
As my h

And send back my Barney to me.

And watch every cloud o'er the sky.

And send back my Barney to me. 
He has left me his fortune to better, 
I

To say that he'll soon be returning, 
To his dear native Ireland and me,

His fingers were long like the cane in the brake, 
And he had no eyes for to see ; 
He had no teeth for to eat de hoe-cake, 
So he had to let the hoe-cake be. 
Then lay down, &L.

Oh. the tears down massa's Lice run like rain, 
For he knew when Ned was laid in the ground, 
He'd Leber see his like again.

We may be happy yet.

Miss Biddy and I

I'd treat her whenever she'd ax it; 
Each day, on the street, Miss Biddy I'd meet, 
Going round, peddling nuts in a

Sure, I 
thought I

When I

There a

THE BLACKBIRD. 
It was on one fine morning for soft recreation, 
I 
heard a 
lair damsel making a 
sad i 
oan, 
Siohing and sobhing with tad lamentati n, 
Saying my Blue bird most loyal has flown. 
My thoughts they deceived me, reflection it grieves no 
And I 
am o'er-burden'd with sad fll.ely; 
But if death should blind me, as trae love inc:ines me, 
My Blackbird 
seek out wherever I 
1
,e. 
Once in titir England my Blackh!rd did flourish, 
lie was th • chief-flower that in it did spring, 
Fair ladies of honor his person did nourish, 
Because that be was the true t 
on of a 
king 
But 0, that false fortune has proved so uncertain, 
That caus'd the arting b twe n 
ycii and me, 
But if he remain in Fra ce or in S:'ain, • 
I'll be true to my B.ackbird wherever he be. 
In England my Blackbird nd I 
w 
ro together, 
When he wits the most noble and gon'rous of heart, 
But woe to the time when be arrived ther e, 
Alas he was t-oon forced from me to par t. 
In Italy he beilin'd and was highly esteemed, 
In England he seems but a 
s• ranger to me, 
But if he remain in Franc 
or in :Spain, 
All blessings on rn 
Blackbird Is hei ever he be. 
But if by the fowler my Blackbird is taken, 
Sighing and sobbing will be all the tune, 
But if he is safe, and I'm not mistaken, 
I 
hope I 
shall see him in Blay or in June. 
The birds of the forest, they all flock together, 
The turtle was chosen to dwell with the dove, 
So I'm r 
solved in fair or f 
ul w 
ather, 
Once in the spring to seek out my love. 
Oh, he is all my treasure, my joy and my pleasure, 
He's justly belov'd though my I

De-erving of blessings wherever i.e b 
It's not the wide ocean can fright me with danger, 
A'though

For I'll find more friendship frcm one that's a

More than from one hat in Bri am n

SAVOURNEEN DEELISH. 
A IR—" Exile of Erin." 
Oh ! the moments were sad when my love and I 
parted, 
Savourneen deelish icelon oge, 
I 
kissed off the tear, and was nigh broken-hearted. 
Savourneen, &e-
Wan was her cheek, as it hung on my shoulder ; 
Damp was her hand, no marble was colder, 
1 
felt that I 
never again should behold her. 
Savourneen, &c. 
,When the word of command set our troops into motion, 
Savourneen, &c. 
I 
buckled on my knapsack, to cross the wide ocean. 
Savourneen, &c. 
Brisk was our troops—all roaring like thunder, 
Pleased with the voyage, impatient for plunder, 
- My bosom with grief was almost rent asunder. 
Savourneen, Szc. 
Peace was proclaimed ; escaped from'the slaughter— 
Landed at home, my sweet girl, I 
sought her ; 
But sorrow, alas I 
to the cold grave had brought her. 
Savourneen, &c. 
Long I 
fought for my country, far, far from my true love. 
Savourneen. &c. 
All my pay and my plunder I

THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN . 
AIR 
" Irish Jig." 
In the merry month of June, when first from home I 
started, 
And left the girls alone, sad and broken hearted, 
Shook hands with Father dear, kissed my darling Mother, 
Drank a 
pint of beer my tears and grief to smother: 
Then off to reap the corn and leave where I 
was born, 
I 
cut a 
stout black- thorn, to banish ghost or goblin: 
With a 
pair of bran new brogues I 
rattled o 
er the b,gs: 
Sur. I 
frightened all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin. 
cnonus. 
For, it is the rocky road, here's the road to Dublin; 
Here's the rocky road, now fire away to Dublin! 
The steam- coach was at hand, the driver said he d 
cheap ones 
But sure, the luggage van was too much for my ha'penoe. 
For Engiand I 
was bound it would never do to balk it: 
For every step of the ro id, be dad I 
says I, I'll walk it. 
..1 did not sigh nor moan until I 
saw Athlone— 
A pain in my shin bone, it set my heart a 
bubbling ; 
And fearing the big cannon, looking o'er the Shannon, 
I 
very quickly ran on the rocky road to Dublin, 
For, it is the rocky road. &c. 
In Mullingar that night I 
rested limbs se weary— 
Started by daylight, with spirits light and airy ; 
Took a 
drop of the pure, to keep my spirits from sinking. 
That's always an Irishman s 
cure, whenever he's troubled 
with thinking 
To see the lasses smile, laughing all the while 
At my comical style • set my hetrt a 
bubbling ; 
They axed if I 
was hired, the wages I 
r.!quired, 
Until I 
was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it is the rocky road, &c. 
In Dublin next arrived—I 
thought it was a 
pity 
To be so soon deprived ef a 
view of that fine city. 
'Twas then I 
took a 
stroll all among the quality— 
My bundle thea was stole in a 
neat locality. 
THE ROCKY ROAD TO DIIBLIN .—[coNcLuDED.) 
Something crossed my mind—thinks I, I'll look behind— 
o 
larndle could I 
find upon my stick a 
wobbling. 
Inquiring f 
r 
the rogue, they said my Connaught brogue 
It wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it is the rocky road, &c. 
A coachman raised his hand, as if myself was wanting— 
I 
went up to a 
stand full of cars for jaunting. 
Step up, my boy, says he, ah, ha I 
that I 
will with pleasure— 
And to the strawberry beds I'll drive you, at your leisure. 
A 
strawberry bed, says I, faith that would be too high, 
On one of straw I'll lie, and the berries won't be troubling. 
He drove me out as far,upon an outside car— 
Faith such jolting never were on the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it was the rocky road, &c. 
I 
soon got out of that my spirits never failing-
1 
landed on the quay just as the ship was sailing. 
The Captain at me roared, swore that no room had he, 
But when I 
leaped on board, they a 
cabinfound for Paddy. 
Down among the pigs I 
played such rummy rigs, 
Danced some hearty jigs, with the water round me bubbling. 
But when off Holyhead, I 
wished that I 
was dead, 
Or safely put in bed, on the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it is the rocky road, &G. 
The boys in Liverpoll, when in the dock I 
landed, 
Called myself a 
fool— I 
could no longer stand it; 
My blood began to boil, my temper I 
was losing, 
And poor Old Erin's Isle they all began abusing. 
Hurrah my boys, says I, my Shillalah I 
let fiy; 
Some Galway boys were by, they saw I 
was a 
hobble in: 
Then, with a 
loud Hurrah, they joined me in the fray; 
Faugh-a-ballagh I 
clear the way for the rocky road to Dublin, 
For, it is the rocky road, &c.

PADDY CAREY. 
'Twas at the town of nate Clogheen, 
That Sergeant Snapp met Paddy Carey; 
A clatter boy was never seen. 
Brisk as a 
bee, light as a 
fairy; 
His brawny shoulders, four feet square, 
His cheeks like thumping red potatoes, 
His legs would make a 
chairman stare I 
And Pat was loved by all the ladies, 
Old and young, grave and sad, 
Deaf and dumb, dull or mad, 
Waddling, twaddlng, limping, squinting, 
Light, brisk and airy— 
CHORUS. 
All the sweet faces at Limerick races, 
From Nullinavelt to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's beautiful name would melt! 
The sowls would cry, and look so shy, 
Och! Cushlaraachree, did you never see 
The jolly boy, the darling joy, the ladies 
Nimble- footed, black-eyed, rosy-cheeked, 
Curly-headed Paddy Carey! 
0, sweet Paddy, beautiful Paddy! 
Nate little, tight little Paddy Carey. 
His heart was made of Irish oak, 
Yet, soft as streams from sweet Killarney, 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of the brogue, 
But the deuce a 
bit at all of the blarney. 
Now Sergeant Snapp, so sly and keen; 
While Pat was coaxing duck-legged Mary, 
A shilling slipped, so nate and cane, 
By the powers, he 'listed Paddy Carey 1 
Tight and sound—strong and light— 
Cheek so round—eyes so bright— 
Whistling, humming, drinking, drumming, 
Light, tight and airy— 
All the sweet faces, &c. 
thy, 
PADDY CAREY.—[coNcLuDED.1 
The Bowls wept loud, the crowd was great, 
When waddling forth came widow Leary; 
Though she was crippled in her gait, 
Her brawny arms clasped Paddy Carey 1 
" 
Och ! Pat," she cried, " go buy the ring; 
Here's cash, galore, my darling honey." 
'Says Pat, " You sowl 
do that thing." 
And clapped his thumb upon her money. 
Gimlet eye—sausage nose— 
Pat so sly—ogle throws— 
Learing, tittering, jeering, frittering, 
Sweet widow Leary! 
All the sweet faces, ex. 
When Pat had thus his fortune made, 
He pressed the lips of Mistress Le,lry, 
And mounting straight a 
large cockade, 
In captain's boots struts Paddy Carey; 
He grateful praised her shape, her back, 
To others like a 
dromedary; 
Her eyes, that seemed their strings to crack, 
Were Cupid's darts to Captain Carey! 
Nate and sweet, no alloy— 
All complete—love and joy. 
Ranting, roaring, soft adoring,

Dear Widow Leary! 
All the sweet faces, &o. 
From Mullinavat to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's promotion sigh and melt; 
The sowls all cry as the groom struts by,

BRENNEN ON THE MOOR. 
It's of a 
fearless Irishman a 
long story I 
shall tell : 
His name was Willie Brennen, in Ireland lie did dwell 
It was on the Calvert mountains he commenced his hellish 
career, 
Wht?,re many a 
wealthy gentleman, before him, shook with fear. 
CHORUS: 
Brennen on the moor, Brennen on the moor, 
Bold and undaunted, stood Brennen on the moor. 
A brace of loaded pistols he carried with him each day: 
lie never robbed a 
poor man upon the Queen's highway; 
For what he'd taken from the rich, like Turpin, and Black Besst 
lie aiways did divide it with the widows in distress. 
One night, he robbed an Irishman, by the name of Juler Dawn: 
They travelled on two together, till the day began to dawn; 
The Juler found his money gone, likewise his watch and chain, 
lie, at once, encountered him, and he robbed him back again. 
'When Willie found the packman was as good a 
man as he, 
lie took him on the highway, his companion for to be ; 
The Juler threw away his pack, without any more delay, 
And he proved a 
faithful comrade, amidst his Agnus 
One day, upon the highway as Willie be sat down, 
lie met the Mayor of Cashill, a 
mile outside of the town ; 
The Mayor he knew his features: I 
think, young man, 'mid he 
That your name is Willie Brennen, you must come along 
with me. 
Willie's wife she being in town, provisions for to buy, 
When she saw her Willie, she began to weep and cry; 
BRENNAN ON THE MOOR. [CONCLUDED ] 
I 
wish he handed me the temperers, as soon as 'Willie spoke, 
She handed him a 
blunderbuss, from underneath her cloak. 
Its with this loaded blunderbuss, the truth I 
will unfold, 
He made the Mayor to tremble s and rotbed him of his gold ; 
One hundred pounds he offered for his apprehension there, 
And he, with hie horse and saddle to the mountains did repair 
Willie being an outlaw , upon the mountains high. 
With cavalry and infantry, to take him they did try; 
He laughed at them with scorn, until at length did say 
Ah false hearted young woman did basely me betray t 
in the County of Tipperary in a 
place called Clonmore, 
Brenien and his comrade was made to suffer sore 
He lay amongst the briars that grow thick upon the fields, 
And he received nine wounds before that he would yield. 
They were taken prisoners, in irons they were bound, 
Conveyed tc Clonmell jail, and strong walls did them surround, 
The jury found them guilty the judge made this reply: 
For robbing on the Queens highway, you're both condemned 
to die. 
Farewell unto my wife and you, my children three! 
And you, my aged father, that may shed tears for me 
And you, my icving mother, tore her gray locks and cried: 
it were better 'Willie Brennen, in your cradle AGALL °HIGH 
CROOS-KEEN LAWN. 
Let the farmer praise his grounds, 
As the huntsman does his hounds, 
And the shepherd his sweet scented lawn, 
While I, more blest than they, 
Spend each happy night and day 
With my smiling little Croos-keen lawn, lawn, lawn, 
Oh, my smiling little Croos-keen lawn. 
Leante ruma Croos-keen, 
Sleante gar ma voor inch neer,.

In court with manly grace, 
should Sir Toby plade his case, 
And the merits of his cause make known, 
Without his cheerful glass, 
He'd be stupid as an ass, 
So he takes a 
little Cross-keen lawn. 
Leaute roma, &e. 
Then fill your glasses high, 
Let's not part with lips so dry-, 
Though the lark should proclaim it is dawn 
But if we can't remain, 
May we shortly meet again, 
To fill another Croos-keen lawn.

And when grim death appears. 
After few but happy years, 
And tells me my glass it is run, run, run,

For great Bacchus gives me lave

Da Witt's Ten Cent Romances No. 6;. 
Secrets of the Old Smithy. 
—0--
Seldom has a 
book been written so full of wild, strange, and 
yet most truthful incidents as the pages of this work contain,— 
Every sentence tells—every individual represented is a 
positive 
character—every event seems to take place before our eyes, so 
vividly is everything depicted. 
It hardly seems a 
fiction. 
Mys-
tery but ' eads to mystery—the plot appears to be eternally thick-
tiing—the mists of blood and dark deeds go on as if to envelop 
he two young loving hearts, as if in the folds of a 
shroud.
