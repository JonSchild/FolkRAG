LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, 
Words by ROBERT MCKAY. 
Music by KELLER, 
As sung by the DELANOS. 
Gent.-0, such a 
charming girl I 
met 
While out the other day, 
For a 
morning constitutional 
Upon our great Broadway; 
She tripped along, and looked so neat. 
Withal so very shy; 
As at her sprightly form I 
gazed. 
I 
really thought I'd fly. 
CHORUS. 
0, she looked so very charming, 
(Symph.1 
It really was alarming (Symph.) 
The way my heart went bumpety bump, 
As she went tripping by. 
When I 
saw this sweet creature, 
So fair in every feature, 
With an awful lump, like a 
camel's hump, 
I 
really thought I'd fly. 
Lizdy.—While walking out the other day. 
0, such a 
handsome man, 
I 
chanced to meet upon the street. 
By accident, my fan 
I 
dropped, he picked it up, and gave 
It to me with a 
bow; 
0, I 
can't forget his handsome face, 
Would he were with me now. 
C." 
CHORUS:. 
0, he looked so very charming; 
It really was alarming 
The way my heart went i 
bumpety_bump' 
When to me he did bow2-
My peace is gone completely, 
Since he smiled on me so sweetly. 
0, I 
can't forget his handsome face; 
Would he were with Inc now. 
Gent. — Excuse me, Miss; a 
splendid day ; • 
I 
don't intrude, I 
hope? 
Lady.—Oh ! 
not at all, sir. 
[Aside.] Heavens 'tis he, 
I 
feel as if I'd drop. 
Gent.By chance, your words I 
overheard; 
You do then love me true ? 
Lady.—I 
do, and have, my darling, since 
My first meeting with you. 
CHORUS. 
Gent and Lady.-0, is'nt (she, he) a 
darling. 
Gent.—I'm sure there is no harm, in 
My asking you to favor me 
With one sweet little kiss. 
Both.—And henceforth and forever. 
It shall be our endeavor 
To make our little home, at least 
A place of perfect bliss 
Business and Exit.

THE DAY THAT WE WENT WEST. 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Performed by HARRIGAN & HART. 
Whin we came out from Cork, 
This day twelve months ago; 
We landed in New York, 
At the Battery here below. 
We wint out on the railroad, 
On the freight that wint so slow; 
An' settled down a-farmin', 
In the State of Ohio. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, it's bothered we are really, 
We never have no rest, 
Since we met with Horace Greeley, 
And the day that we wint Wet. 
The divil a 
bite we ate 
Till we got to Chicago; 
Nor not a 
wink of slape, 
Oh, how could they trate us so? 
Then we rid upon the stages, 
All 'cross the prairie land; 
And left the State of Ohio, 
For the State of Michigan. 
Oh, it's bothered, etc. 
We're tired out complate, 
Wid work and fat-i-gue; 
It's our frinds that we will seek, 
D'yees know thim, now, any of you? 
Sure we would like to find thim, 
If yees would interest 
-3Cerselves just for a 
moment, sure, 
We're strangers from the West. 
Oh, it's bothered, etc. 
AS WE PROMENADE DOWN BROADWAY. 
Written for JEPPE and FANNIE DELANO. 
Words and Music by JOHN T. 
RUTLEDCE. 
;ent.—In life there's nothing nicer than 
To be a 
dashing swell. 
To flirt with all the pretty girls, 
And court the fairest belle. 
Now I 
have got a 
sweetheart, 
She's the sweetest girl I 
know; 
And I 
am called the nobby chap, 
In every place I 
go. 
CHORUS. 
As we promenade down Broadway, 
The people smile and say, 
A 
nobby pair are they 
Who ever they may be. 
We're happy then you know, 
Each a 
captivating beau; 
Our fashions all we show, 
When coming from the matinee. 
Lady.—I'm always full of life you know, 
And like to have my fun, 
I 
like to flirt with gay young men, 
As well as any one. 
I 
like to promenade the street, 
With Gussey by my side; 
While some, with eager glances look 
The love they cannot hide. 
As we promenade, etc. 
Gussy, dear, why did you stay 
Away so long, my dear; 
I've waited for an hour or more, 
My heart was filled with fear. 
Gent.—I 
would have been here sooner, love, 
With something sweet to say, 
But then you know I 
had to take 
A promenade down Broadway. 
As we promenade, etc.

KISS ME AGAIN.

I 
have a 
darling whom I 
adore, 
When he is near I 
am sighing no more: 
Lone are the hours when we are apart, 
Fondly his image now dwells in my heart. 
Sweet hours of gladness we pass side by side, 
Waiting the day when I'll be his bride; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss Inc again and say that you love me, 
Ever my darling remain; 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
How it will cheer you and banish all care; 
Never refuse one, never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful and scream out " Oh, my!" 
Kisses are plenty and kisses are sweet, 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat; 
If with your lov'd one you'd always remain, 
Come to his side and say, " kiss me again!" 
Kiss me again, etc. 
JUR AND FANNIE, 
MEDLEY. 
Arranged by JEPPE DfrANO. 
He. 
Little Rosebud will you miss me, 
When I 
am so far away— 
She. 
Oh, Nicodernus, Nicodemus what makes you go away, 
I've told you that I 
love, and I 
have for many a 
day— 
He. 
Then why turn away when I 
draw near, 
Why cold to-day, once I 
was dear.— 
She. 
You may kiss me if it please you, 
And I 
won't say no, won't say no, 
You may— 
He. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, 
Now don't be unkind, though we're alone.— 
She. 
Oh, ain't you awful, 
It's wrong you know to tease me so, 
Oh, you are awful, 
Go 'way and let me be.— 
He. 
Why there is no harm in kissing, 
Pray tell me is there, dear, 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near.— 
Oh, fie, fie for shame, 
What would mamma say? 
What would papa say— 
He. 
(Spoken.)—He would say— 
Wait till the moonlight falls on the water, 
Then take your sweetheart out for a 
walk, 
Mind what you say, boys, that's how to court her, 
Tell her— 
He's one of our boys, hooray! 
Yes one of our boys, hooray! 
He's honest and true, so give him his due. 
We're proud of our boys, hooray— 
And she is such a 
shy young girl— 
She. 
Boo da day, doo da dey. 
Eyes like diamonds, teeth like pearl—. 
Boo da doo da, dey. 
Won't you tell me why, Kitty, 
Won't you tell me why— 
Certainly, I'll ask my mother and 
let you know next 
Sunday afternoon. 
For they say you're awfully clever— 
Yes, deuced clever rather, 
And they say I've got the belle of the ball, my friends— 
She. 
Yes, you've got the belle of the ball, Charlie, 
You've got the belle of the ball, Charlie, 
You've got the belle of the ball— 
He. 
That's so. 
When you and I 
shall married be, 
I 
hope we'll suit just to a 
T ; 
Then oh, so happy we will be, 
So happy we will be— 
She. 
Yes, but there's billiards and beer. — 
He. 
Those I 
will swear off, my dear, 
She. 
No more cigars, do you hear. 
He. 
I'll try, my love, I'll try. 
Both. 
When you and I 
shall married be, 
I 
hope we'll suit just to a 
T, 
Then, oh, so happy we will be, 
So happy we will be, 
0, so happy, o 
so happy, 
0, so happy we will be, 
0, so happy, o, so happy we will be 
We will be, we will be. 
WALKING OUT ON SUNDAY. 
sung with great success by JEPPE & FANNY DELANO. 
He. 
Walking out on Sunday I 
think very nice, 
What I 
would dispense with, not at any price, 
So when the weather's proper, I'm ready in a 
trice 
To take my usual walk upon a 
Sunday. 
A 
drive out in a 
trap, how some folks seem to prize, 
But the exercise of walking I 
would most advise; 
And, oh, such funny sights, and, oh, such horrid guys 
You meet with when you're walking out on Sunday. 
CHORUS. 
Walking out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
Driving out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
It's awful jolly walking out on Sunday. 
She. 
Now there's Augustus Tompkins, a 
very heavy swell, 
He manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill; 
You'd think he was a 
banker instead of a 
Broadway clerk, 
As he goes out to take his walk on Sunday. 
With his silver headed cane, and a 
glass stuck in one eye, 
He twirls his fine moustache, which suspiciouS looks of dye, 
In fact you seldom see so elegant a 
guy, 
As Tompkins when he's crawling out on Sunday. 
Walking out, etc. 
.//e. 
There's that pretty little shop girl, as she sweeps along, 
With the newest style of hat, from the Bowery, corner of Bond. 
In the distance you might take her for one of the Haut ton, 
As she goes sailing out upon a 
Sunday. 
She. 
Oh, there's that nobby Broadway clerk, in business he's so smart. 
Got up regardless of expense to captivate some heart, 
His garments are from Brooks' fashionable mart, 
So off he struts to meet his girl on Sunday. 
Walking out, etc.

Fond memory weaves a 
blissful dream, 
Of love and long ago; 
That hovers near me like a 
beam 
Of golden sunset glow. 
A dimpled hand is laid in mine, 
Blue eyes upon me gaze; 
And stars of heaven softly shine, 
As in skeet other days. 
And stars of heaven softly shine, 
As in sweet other days. 
I 
hear a 
gentle voice repeat 
Affection's story still; 
So fall the hours or sad or sweet, 
My heart with rapture thrills. 
By leafy glade and flow'ry dell, 
My heart in gladness strays; 
And recollection weaves a 
spell 
Of love and other days. 
And recollection weaves a 
spell 
Of love and other days. 
TELL ME, I 
PRAY, WOULD YOU? 
Written expressly for JEPPE & FANNIE DELANO, by W ILL H. 
I 
know a 
youth with golden hair, 
And eyes that beam so bright, 
With happy face so sweet and fair, 
And heart so fond and light. 
He's merry as the joyous birds, 
And says he loves me true; 
Yet I 
can scarce believe his words, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you ? 
CHORUS. 
I'm sure I 
love him very well, 
He says he loves me, too; 
Yet I 
can scarcely trust the spell, 
Tell me. I 
pray, would you ? 
I 
know a 
maid so bright and fair, 
And sweet as she can be; 
With roguish eye and sunny hair, 
Such as you seldom see. 
She's merry as the laughing brook, 
I 
think she loves me, true; 
Yet I 
can scarcely trust her look, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you? 
CHORUS. 
know I 
love her more than all, 
And think she loves me, too; 
And soon to ask her I 
shall call, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you ? 
I 
wish he'd call me to his side, 
And whisper words of love; 
And call me all his joy and pride, 
His darling turtle dove. 
But, then, he never will do so, 
Although I 
love him true; 
I've half a 
mind to let him go, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you? 
I'm sure I 
love him, etc. 
Come, tell me, sweetest little pet, 
You'll love no one but me. 
SHE. 
While life shall last, without regret, 
I 
give myself to thee. 
And as we journey on through years, 
We ever shall be true; 
We'll never shed regretful tears, 
Tell me, I 
pray; would you ? 
CHORUS—BOTH. 
We're happy as two turtle doves, 
We love each other true; 
We'll ne'er regret the day we met, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you? 
Music by BURT SITITARTI 
Sung with great success by JEPPE & FANNIE DELANO. 
HE. 
In yonder snow white cottage dwells 
The prettiest of girls, 
Her azure eyes and glittering teeth, 
Resembling strings of pearls, 
Have won my heart, and so, to-night, 
I'm going to propose, 
Earth would be but a 
waste without 
My pretty little Rose. 
She may give me the " mitten," though, 
For, ' neath yon broad, blue sky, 
Lives not the like of little Rose— 
So sweet, and yet so shy. 
Men tell me I 
am beautiful, 
And much extol my charms, 
But yet their praises only fill 
My bosom with alarms: 
'Twos thus that Satan, as I've read, 
In Eden tempted Eve. 
And some men still his arts employ, 
Her progeny to deceive. 
But, hark! a 
stranger hither comes, 
The trees obstruct my view, 
'Tis only Harry—why, what makes 
Me blush and tremble so ? 
Ah I 
little Rose, I 
did not think 
To find y 
-Yu loitering here. 
16 
SHE. . 
I 
merely stopped a 
moment, for 
I 
love the birds to hear, 
They haunt in throngs this pleasant spot, 
And here I 
often stray, 
To watch them as they blithely flit 
From bough to bough, at play. 
HE. 
Would I 
with thee, sweet Rose, 
These sylvan scenes might share, 
How cheerfully then I'd resign 
The world's deceitful glare. 
SHE. 
Can it be love that thrills my breast? 
What raptures o'er me steal! 
HE. 
Oh speak—behold, before thy feet, 
Thy votary now does kneel. 
SHE. 
He speaks again—expects reply— 
Oh! my, what shall I 
say ? 
HE. 
Oh! speak and bid me wander hence, 
Or by thy side to stay. 
Joy forever blest am I, 
Than he to whom chance throws 
A crown, a 
costlier gift, I 
deem, 
The love of little Rose.

FAMILY JARS,

Written expressly for JEPPE & FANNIE DELANO, by EDWARD 
CHRISSIE. 
CAST : 
MR. GEORGE WALKER  
..JEPPE DELANO. 
FANNIE DELANO. 
MRS. SUSAN WALKER  
Scene.—NEAT PARLOR IN 3. 
FULL SET or FURNITURE. PEN, 
INK AND PAPER ON SMALL TABLE. 
Time. — 2 
O'CLOCK, A. M. 
Susan discovered seated on sofa. 
SUSAN. —I 
declare this is too bad. 
Two o'clock, and my hus-
band not home yet! 
And when he does come, he'll tell me 
he has been to the lodge. 
A nice excuse—this " lodge!" 
There ought to be a 
law against married men belonging to se-
cret societies. 
I 
wonder what he would say if / came home at 
two in the morning, and told him I 
was detained by important 
business at the ladies' sewing circle? 
But, of course, I 
am 
only a 
weak woman, and have no rights, while he is one of the 
"lords of creation," and can do as he pleases. 
Oh! dear, oh! 
dear, why did I 
marry? (
Sings.) 
Air—" Wait till the Moonlight." 
Why did I 
marry is what I 
often wonder, 
When I 
was so happy in my single life; 
I 
really do believe I 
made a 
stupid blunder, 
When I 
did consent to become his wife. 
But he coaxed and teased me, 
And his adoration pleased me, 
And he swore that he would kill himself 
Unless I 
did him wed. 
So I 
finally consented, 
But.have bitterly repented, 
And I 
feel so very miserable 
I 
wish that I 
was dead. 
18 
CHORUS. 
SO, ladies, take warning, and never think of mar-
rying 
A man who belongs to a 
secret lodge, 
For late hours he will keep, 
And rob you of your sleep, 
And think that he is playing 
A very cunning dodge. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, a 
very cunning dodge, indeed. Keeping their 
wives up till two or three in the morning. 
And if you say a 
word about it, they'll coolly reply, " Well, why didn't you go to 
bed?" 
But I 
have thought of a 
plan that, I 
think, will keep 
my husband at home in future. 
I 
will write a 
letter as if from 
a 
gentleman, to me, asking my acquaintance, etc. 
That will 
make him jealous, and he will remain at home to watch. 
(Sits down at table, writes, and reads aloud)— 
" 
Dear Susan—Excuse me for being so presumptious as to 
call you Dear Susan,' but I 
have long admired you, and pitied 
your sad fate—left alone night after night, while your husband 
is out enjoying himself. • He is unworthy the affection you 
bestow upon him, as he plainly shows by his neglect and ab-
sence from you. 
If you will only permit me to call and en-
deavor to cheer your solitude, you will bestow inexpressible 
happiness upon your devoted admirer."--
Let me see what name to sign— Oh, yes, " John Brown." I 
will leave it on the table, where he will be sure to find it, (
sings) 
Air—"Letter in the Candle." 
There's a 
letter on the table, 
Which I 
think will work a 
cure, 
For, although he is not jealous. 
Tlá will hurt his feelings sure. 
For he'll see how very careless 
Aral neglectful he has been, 
And I 
think he'll truly promise, 
Never to offend again. 
INL4iEN.—Hark I 
think I 
hear his voice. • (Singing outside. 
Mr. George Walker, a 
little tipsy. sings chorus through, entering on 
last ne- - For I'm a 
member of the Rollicking Rams.") 
19 
SPOKEN.—Hello, my dear, not gone to bed yet ? 
SUSAN.—No 
sir; I 
waited to see what time you would come 
home. 
And now, sir, where have have you been ? 
GEORGE.—Where have I 
been? 
Why, as the old song goes, 
I've been— (Sings) 
Air—" Monkey's Wedding." 
Up the outside down the middle, 
To the music of a 
fiddle, 
How I 
did it was a 
riddle, 
For I 
was awful blue. 
SUSAN — Am I 
to understand that you have been to a 
ball, 
and without me? 
GEORGE.—No, my dear, I 
was only joking; I 
was detained 
by very important business at the lodge. 
SUSAN.—The lodge, indeed! Mr. Walker, that excuse won't 
do any long" 
GEORGE.— It's a 
fact, my dear; The truth of the matter is, 
the goat fractured one of his horns while initiating the last can-
didate, and I 
remained to assist in setting it. 
(
Aside.) 
And I 
think I 
got a 
few horns too many. 
SUSAN. (
sneeringly)—Now, I 
presume, you think you have 
said something very witty. 
But, I 
can tell you, I 
shall not 
stand this sort of treatment any longer. 
What would mama 
say if she knew all ? 
(Sings) 
Air—" What would Mama Say? 
Oh, George, ain't you ashamed? 
What would mama say, 
What would mama say, 
She'd call me foolish if I 
remained, 
And let you treat me treat me so. 
(George sings) 
Air—" I 
want to go Home to Mama." 
Then, why don't you go home to your ma? 
Likewise your respectable pa; 
If I'm such a 
brute, why, you'd better scoot, 
And trot along home to your ma. 
(Susan sings) 
I'll leave you in the morning, 
Though you don't care of course, 
Ill take the train for Chicago, 
And sue for a 
divorce; 
And, when I'm gone away, 
You'll be quite happy, then, 
For you can rest asSured that I 
Will never return again. 
(Repeat the last two lines.) 
Air— When the Pigs begin to Fly. 
(George sings) 
Air—" Hildebrand Montrose." 
Ta-ta, ta-ta, my darling wife, 
You've made me very happy-, 
You have, upon my life; 
No more your " curtain lectures " 
Shall torture my poor brain, 
For I 
shall be that happy elf — 
A single man again. 
SUSAN (
speaks)—George Walker, you are a 
brute. I 
did think 
you loved me, but now I 
am convinced you do not care a 
fig for 
me. 
But, thank goodness, there are some people in the world 
who appreciate my worth, as I 
think that letter will convince 
you 
GEORGE (
takes letter, reads it aloud)—aside—Her own hand-
writing. 
I 
see it's a 
put up job to try and make me jealous. 
(Aloud) Well, my dear, this is a 
very nice affair, but a 
little bit 
too thin. 
(Sings) 
.Air—" Jilin Brown's Body." 
John Brown's letter is a 
little too thin, 
For I 
am not so stupid or so easy taken in; 
So do not be so foolish as to try it on again, 
For at plotting you're not at home. 
SUSAN (sings) • 
Well, the truth I 
won't deny, 
I 
did it just to try 
To make you jealous— 
(Aside)-0h, dear, I 
feel as if I'd like to cry. 
G 
EORGE (
sings) 
But you see it wouldn't do, 
For I

GEORGE.—No—that is, I'll only go once a

For when you do return at eve, 
I'll never meet you with a

No bitter words shall you receive, 
For I

As gentle as my loving wife; 
So all the world shall envy me, 
My happy cheerful wedded life.

I

lesson you will see. 
Gents don't tarry from your home, 
And leave your loving wives alone. 
SUSAN (
sings) 
And wives, whate'er your trouble be, 
Don't raise the demon, jealousy. 
(Both sing) 
For when you both are growing old, 
And silver threads are 'mong the gold; 
Then what happiness 'twill be, 
To know through life you did agree.

AN ABSENT-MINDED MAN. 
Written and sung by DAN. SULLY Irish Comedian. 
0, my name is Mickey Dolan, 
I'm a 
dacint meaning man, 
But the divil for making blunders. 
And do right I 
never can 
On account of absent-mindedness. 
I'm never out of scrapes, 
I'm a 
regular Handy Andy for 
All sorts of queer mistakes. 
(
Break.) 
Oh, I 
blunder with my hands and feet, 
I 
blunder with my tongue. 
And if blundering would hang a 
man 
Be heavens I 
would be hung. 
For its divel a 
haper do I 
know 
What's now my present plan; 
Whether it be a 
dance or song, for I'm 
An absent-minded man 
(
Dance.) 
It's perplexed I 
am entirely. 
I'm a 
walking paradox; 
If I 
want to kill a 
chicken 
Be me sowl I'd kill an ox. 
For me water I'd drink whiskey 
And eat sugar instead of salt, 
For I 
don't know what I'm doing 
And of course it's not my fault. 
(Break.) 
At table in the morning, whin 
Me breakfast I'd be at, 
Instead of handing up my plate 
Be heavens I 
hand my hat. 
Then I'm laughed at by the blackguards 
And I 
tell them to be calm; 
Bad manners to ye's, don't ye see I'm 
An absent-minded man. 
(
Dance.) 
On account of my propensities, it's myself 
That am in doubt 
Exactly whether I'm up or down, 
Or whether Pm in or out. 
If North I'd go, I'd travel South, 
If West I'd travel East, 
And when wanted at a 
funeral 
I 
would attend a 
marriage feast 
(Break.) 
And when I 
call to see the girls 
I 
t's whin they are away; 
I 
would make me bow" and say 
Good night, and thin sit down and stay. 
And if on drowning I 
was bent, 
Be me sowl I'd miss me plan, 
For I 
would jump into the fire, for I'm 
An absent-minded man.

Air—" Gendarmes" 
Original by NED HARRIGAN. 
OLD Gabriel Withers he was fat, 
With the boys he would go ' round, 
He was limber and as spry as a 
cat, 
He weighed four hundred pounds. 
They said he was a 
natural growl, 
For he uttered many a 
damn; 
And his voice was the worst, 
You ought to hear the old man growl, 
His voice was the worst, 
Such a 
terrible obstinate man. 
If you ask him out to take a 
ride, 
In a 
Pullman Palace Car, 
For an old stage coach he'd make a 
dive, 
He could stand a 
terrible jar. 
Then ask him to take whiskey punch, 
Or a 
sandwich with plenty ham; 
He'd eat pig's feet, pig's feet, you know, 
Just for a 
lunch; 
He'd eat pig's feet, 
Such a 
terrible obstinate man. 
If the lay was fair and as 'clear as a 
bell, 
He would wear his great big boots, 
And always carry an umbrell, 
While the boys at him made snoots. 
But when a 
stormy day there came, 
In his shirt sleeves he would stand; 
And he'd get awful-wet, 
While standing out in the rain; 
He'd get awful wet, 
This terrible obstinate man. 
His friends advised him to take a 
wife, 
Some young girl good as gold; 
That would make him happy all his life, 
But he married something old. 
So grief set in, he soon got thin, 
Like a 
Coney Island Clam; 
And they said he was dead, 
And throwed him up-stairs into bed; 
And they said he was dead, 
Such a 
terrible obstinate man.

When I 
was a 
boy, 
was brimful of fun, 
For all sorts of tricks I 
was noted; 
From morning till evening I 
never was done, 
On rollicking pleasure I 
doted. 
I 
tried every game, and when winter time came, 
With joy I 
was all in a 
flutter, 
Then out on the ice, Oh, I 
tell you 'twas nice, 
I 
went skating on one in the gutter. 
CHORUS. 
Skating on one, skating on one, 
Oh, boys, there was never such glorious fun ; 
All other pleasures of youth I 
would shun, 
And go skating on one in the gutter. 
I 
beat all the boys with my far-fetching stride, 
In fact I 
was never artistic; 
While backward and forward so graceful did glide, 
I 
thought every motion majestic. 
I 
cared not to skate on the rink or the park, 1 
You may believe its the truth which I 
utter, 
The best of all pleasures from daylight till dark, 
Was skating on one in the gutter. ' 
Skating on one, etc. 
To join in the sport I 
would loiter from school, 
And gain the great wrath of my master; 
Sometimes on the ice I 
would get a 
great fall, 
And go home for a 
piece of shin plaster. 
And oft through the day, I 
would steal soft away, 
With a 
hungry boy's balm, bread and butter, 
To meet my companions, so noisy and gay, 
And go skating on one in the gutter. 
Skating on one, etc.

Fly across the ocean, birdie, 
Fly beyond that gloomy sea; 
There you'll find a 
truant lover, 
Who has pledged his life to me. 
Tell him how my heart was aching, 
Aching that I 
gave him pain; 
That my pride will not allow him 
To recall those words again. 
CHORUS. 
Birdie, Birdie, Darling birdie, 
Do not tarry on the way; 
When you hear the ocean murmur, 
Birdie, birdie fly away: 
Take with you this glossy ringlet, 
Place it on his bosom bare; 
Tell him, birdie, to remember, 
How my curls have nestled there. 
Let him call to mind the momenta, 
When our hearts were both so free, 
When he pledged his life forever, 
Unto me, yes, unto me. 
Birdie, birdie, &e. 
Let him think how once he falter'd, 
Near the window, by my side, 
When he ask'd me would I 
love him? 
When he ask'd me for his bride ? 
Fly away, now birdie, darling, 
Stay no more to hear me sigh; 
There now, bless you, birdie, bless you, 
Bear my message through the sky,

We marched behind the Branigan's band on the great St. 
Patrick's day, 
With fifes and drums, a 
playing martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's band 
Oh! we marched so gaily down the street, 
And every one we meet says don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's band. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time, keep step, forward march away ! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array, 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand. 
Like heroes bold, the young and old will march with the Bran-
igan's band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
For handkerchiefs, they're waving towels, to catch our soldiers 
eyes; 
They've left their hash to come out and mash, when the Mar-
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's band; 
Oh ! don't their hearts go pit-a-pat, 
As oach one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
Says there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the daisy swell that's with the famous Branigan's band. 
Mark time, keep step, ttc. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emerald Hall, and an illegant supper

There was beaus and peas and frigaees, and oysters fat for

With pickled stews, and hullabaloos, and Irish quail so grand; 
Beets and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brani-
trans band; 
Oh! it's then we sung, and danced a,reel, 
And oh! how good We feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's band.

When first I 
went to see my gal, 
We courted in the dark; 
But her father and her mother and cross-eyed brother, 
Would listen while we'd spark. 
So I 
bought the new invention, then,

And gave them all the laugh; 
'Twas a 
string with a 
tin box on each end, 
Called the Lover's Telegraph.

Oh, the new invention is awful nice, 
I 
know 'twould make you laugh; 
To hear the very funny things we said 
Through the Lover's Telegraph.

When next I 
went to see my girl, 
I 
had very little to say; 
I 
gave her one end of the new machine, 
And sat about twenty feet away. 
The old folks thought we acted strange, 
And called me a 
great big calf; 
But they didn't know how the old thing worked. 
Through the Lover's Telegraph. 
Oh, the new, etc. 
Said I, ' sweet angel dost thou know, 
I 
lovest thee the best?" 
The answer came so soft and sweet— 
" 
Oh, George, pull down your vest!" 
When I 
asked her if she'd fly with me 
To the land of the wild giraffe; 
She answered back ' s 
how are you fixed ?" 
Through the Lover's Telegraph. 
Oh, the new, etc. 
Love went flying through the string, 
Till her brother found us out; 
And then he whispered to his dad 
What we had been about. 
The old man gently raised his hoof, 
Nearly splitting me in half; 
He busted a 
hole in my new pants, 
And the Lover's Telegraph.

Oh ! we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er. 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last. 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future, evermore. 
Our once tender love is buried in the past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall 
In spite of all that I 
could do. 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again.

My dream of love is o'er,

see again. 
Oh! they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget, 
All the vows we pledged together 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my Pet. 
Ah! the heart is like the.tides 
That flow and ebb at will; 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could. 
So, thro' all the future years,

0, this is the age of invention, 
Strange wonders turn up ev'ry day, 
All the sciences seem in convention. 
Where they'll stop at, no mortal can say; 
But the latest and greatest of mysteries, 
Which all other wonders surpass, 
To go down in posterities' hist'ries, 
Are these wonderful panes of blue glass. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis a 
science none others compare to, 
The philosopher's stone found at last, 
For 'twill cure all the ills flesh.is heir to, 
These wonderful panes of blue glass. 
If a 
pane of blue glass you put over 
The head of your mother-in-law, 
She'll be tame as a 
lamb in spring clover, 
And she can't even wag her own jaw; 
Your own wife won't dare ask where you've been to, 
If a 
night at your club you should pass, 
If you have in your own bed-room windows, 
These wonderful panes of blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, eta. 
'Twould do well in the windows of churches, 
It might keep the preachers from sin. 
And in street cars %would make the conductork• 
Account for each fare they take in; 
•

And if you had a 
brick in your hat, sir, 
For a 
sober man wanted to pass, 
'Twould be easy for you to do that, sir, 
In your hat put a 
pane of blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, eto. 
A 
blue goblet full of good whiskey, 
Would be most tee tempting to pass, 
And no temperance mar will get frisky, 
If he drinks his rum from P blue glass; 
All the boarding-house keepers will have them, 
And the boarders will get fat quite fast, 
They can't tell the shirt buttons from grizzle, 
When the hash is served up in blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, et& 
If we send up a 
dozen of glaziers, 
To the Capitol with this blue glass, 
Congressmen would be honest as blazes, 
And the days of their stealing be past; 
If we had blue glass ballot boxes, 
We'd have fair elections at last, 
And a 
President upright and honest, 
U 
the White House was glazed with blue glass.'

SONG AND CHORUS. 
My Susan has the sweetest face, 
In all Manhattan Isle; 
The whitest hand, the smallest waist, 
The most bewitching smile; 
And when by her bright lips I 
swore 
Her love would crown my bliss, 
I 
thought I 
was in duty bound, 
The rosy book to kiss. 
CHORUS. 
Don't now Don't now, modest Susan cried, 
As bashfully she turned from me, 
Her blushing cheeks to hide. 
Don't now! don't now! darling, if you please! 
Well, have your way, though I 
must say, 
You are an awful tease. 
I 
gazed on her retreating form, 
With rapture most intense, 
And as she waved adieu to me, 
I 
thought she looked immense; 
The naughty pull-back dress, 
That to her charming figure clings, 
Revealed her little fairy feet, 
As light as fancy's wings. 
Don't now! Don't now, etc. 
My heart was leaping with ielight, 
No thought of care or pat..., 
I 
dreamt of Susan all the night, s 
And sighed to dream again, 
When by the squalling cats disturbed ; 
That round the roof did stroll, 
As Susan's modest chidings fell, 
Like music on my soul. 
Don't now! Don't now, etc. 
So all went like a 
marriage bell, 
Upon a 
summer's day, 
Till I 
discovered she was false, 
Or had been led astray. 
I 
saw her standing with a 
swell, 
Whose arm was around my dear; 
And, as I 
passed, her silv'ry voice 
Stole softly on my ear. 
Don't now! Don't now, etc. 
'Tis sad to find your friends are false, 
Your pockets void of cash; 
To find remains of toothless combs 
And boot-heels in your hash; 
But 0, what grief was mine to hear 
My cruel rival say, 
Another kiss, you're all my own, 
Since you have named the day. 
Don't now! Don't now, etc.

Someone's watching at the window, 
Where the people hurry by, 
Listening for a 
well-known footstep, 
With a 
bright and eager eye. 
For they cherish still a 
promise 
Of a 
heart they know is true, 
Who has whispered, love, to-morrow, 
I 
will come again to you. 
CHORUS. 
Someone's watching at the window, 
With their face.against the pane; 
Someone's softly, sweetly saying, 
"Will he, will he come again ?" 
Someone's growing very weary, 
As the moments come and go; 
Where the wayward one is wandering 
They would dearly like to know. 
Surely he can never linger 
From my side so long and late, 
When he knows the sweetest welcome, 
Here, his coming doth await. 
Someone'slwatching, etc. 
Someone's dreaming of the story, 
Ever new and ever old, 
That they long to hear repeated, 
Though it often has been told, 
They are from the past recalling, 
All their many dreams of bliss, 
Hearing not the footsteps falling, 
'Till they are startled with a 
kiss. 
Someone's watching, etc:

LEAN BANANA. 
.A. Parody on " Eileen Allanna." 
Written by SAM DEVERE. 
COpyright Secured. 
A 
lean banana, decayed to the core, 
E'er since I 
slipped on thy peel I've been so sore. 
On my back I 
lingered just where I 
fell; 
The sweet words I 
uttered would ne'er do to tell. 
If I 
could have caught then the dizzy looking gawk, 
Who threw that banana peel out oh the walk. 
It made me see stars that I 
ne'er saw before, 
A 
lean banana I'll love thee no more. 
1St CHORUS. 
Lightly I'll tread on the sidewalk evermore, 
A_ lean banana rotten to the core; 
I 
slipped on thy peel, I'll be careful eVermore, 
A. lean banana from some foreign shore. 
A 
lean banana, you've caused many a 
roar, 
I 
slipped on thy peel and you turned me o'er and o'er. 
And young girls have blushed so when thrown off their pegs 
Slipping on a 
banana and showing their dear legs. 
Numerous are the pedestrians that you have caused to fall 
Great big and little, lean, lank and tail. 
The seats of fat men's pants you've busted and you've tore. 
A 
lean banana, how they have swore. 
2d CHORUS. 
Watchful I 
am from the time I 
leave my door, 
A 
lean banana, I've heard of you before. 
E'er since I 
slipped on thy peel I've been so sore, 
A 
lean banana from some Dutch grocery store.

Thou Hast Learned to Love Another. 
Words by H. C. STRICKLEY. 
Music by CHARLES E. 
PRAT% 
Dedicated to HENRY F. FORBUSH & FRANK W EST. 
Air—" Put My Little Shoes Away." 
Thou hast learned to love another, 
Thou haat broken every vow, 
We have parted from each other, 
And my heart is lonely now; 
I 
have taught my looks to shun thee, 
When coldly we have met, 
For another's smile hath won thee, 
And thy voice I 
must forget. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, is it well to sever 
This heart from thine forever? 
Can I 
forget thee—never! 
Farewell, farewell forever. 
We have met in scenes of pleasure, 
We have met in halls of pride, 
I 
have seen thy new-found treasure, 
I 
have gazed upon thy bride; 
I 
have marked the timid lustre 
Of thy downcast happy eye, 
I 
have seen thee gaze upon her, 
Forgetting I 
was by. 
CHORUS. 
I 
grieve that e'er I 
met thee, 
Fain, fain, would I 
forget thee, 
Shall I 
forget thee—never: 
Farewell, farewell forever. 
We have met and we have parted, 
But I 
uttered scarce a 
word, 
Like a 
guilty thing I 
started, 
When thy well-known voice I 
heard; 
Thy looks were stern and altered, 
And thy words were cold and high, 
How my traitor courage faltered 
When I 
dared to meet thine eye. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, woman's love will grieve her, 
And woman's pride will leave her, 
Life has fled when love deceives her, 
Farewell, farewell forever.

Her mother was his early love, 
Her sire his boyhood's friend, 
And when they pass'd away, their child, 
The old man vow'd to tend. 
She was the sunshine of his home, 
A 
rose so bright and fair, 
With all her mother's loving ways, 
Her eyes and golden hair, 
her eyes and golden hair. 
What wonder to his lonely heart 
Crept back the lovelof old, 
But autumn may not wed with spring. 
He cherished it untold; 
But autumn may not wed with spring. 
He cherished it untold. 
TOURS. 
One day there came a 
seemly knight, 
To woo her from his side, 
The old man smiled upon him, 
For her sake, his joy and pride, 
His joy and pride. 
But fickle was the knight and false, 
(A story threadbare old.) 
lie woo'd her for a 
little while, 
Then wed for lands and gold. 
A 
blighted flower can bloom no more, 
The old man wept one day, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd, 
His darling pa.ss'd away,' 
Ls murmuring the name she lov'd, 
His darling, his darling, his darling, parsed away.

RIDING in a 
street car the other day, 
Reading in the Herald to pass the time away, 
A 
darlin4- 
little creature dressed in latest style, 
Took the seat I 
offered her, and thanked me with a 
smile, 
Eyes of brightest lustre, hair of glossy hue, 
Form so fair and slender, and so graceful too; 
How my heart went pit pat, I 
shall ne'ver forget, 
And the dear emotion lingers with me yet. 
CHORUS. 
It was riding in the street car just the other day 
Some one that I 
saw there stole my heart away 
handsome form and feature just the one for me 
And if our love is mutual,happy we shall be. 
She's the charming fair one coming down the street, 
I 
wonder if she'll know me when we chance to meet, 
How my heart is throbbing, tho' I 
must appear 
As if chance alone had made me linger here. 
Oh there's the charming fellow that stole my heart away, 
Tbat gave me up his seat in the car the other day; 
How I 
wish he'd ask me for to take a 
walk, 
It would be enchanting could I 
hear him talk. 
It was riding. etc. 
Darling little creature, pardon me, I 
pray, 
But won't you go a 
walking to pass the time away, 
Well, really sir, I 
thank you, I 
can hardly choose, 
Still you're so engaging I 
will not refuse. 
Won't it be so pleasant just to have a 
walk, 
Yes, and so delightful just to have a 
talk; 
I've a 
little secret to whisper in yotu ear, 
I'll agree to treasure ev'ry word I

Some folks will cry " Oh ! shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to blame, 
I 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
Whi, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a 
sin, that Mrs. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors " tall --men " from day to day; 
While Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defencs was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
" 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though of ttimes they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For hours three or four, lovers Ppooning at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unawares, 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they. say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
But what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek I 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray;" 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc.

Grandpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
.Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, . 
And sadly meditate. 
Gently 4.gh. we all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window, 
A 
careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc. 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
prayer she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc.

George Barnwell, THE IlEscitiNT's CLERK. — This is an 
extremely sensational sketch, but shows Truth stranger than Fiction. 
This deluded victim went from crime to crime with a 
fearful rapidity, 
urged by the baneful influences of women lost to honor. He realized 
every moment the evils of his course, but, like a 
bird fluttering over the 
basilisk eye of the serpent, he went down, down, into the vortex of ruin 
and despair. 
This book teaches, in the strongest way, the moral lesson 
of resisting that temptation, which comes arrayed like an " angel of 
light"—beautiful to the eye, and blasting to the soul.... Price 25 Cents.
