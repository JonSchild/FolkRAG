I: 
Okay. Finally. 
P: 
Yeah. We’re started. 
I: 
Yes. And I’m going to start just by saying thank you, A, for agreeing to do this interview, nerves and all. 
And we feel privileged to be here. It’s our privilege to be here and to hear your stories. So, we feel the work 
that you do is really important. And as I said earlier, what we’re trying to do is to let the rest of the world know 
what you’re doing and why it’s important. So, thank you for being here, and also for the work that you do. 
P: 
Thanks for listening [laughing]. 
I: 
I’m happy to. I love listening to the stories. So, we want to hear your story from the beginning. How did 
you get into this kind of work and why? 
P: 
Well, 18 years ago I needed a job [laughs], and I knew a person that [1.28.59] was a manager at an 
adult foster care home, and they were looking to hire somebody. Said, “Come on in. Fill out an application. I’ll 
hire you.” I was very fortunate, and it happened to be a behavioral home for mentally challenged—bipolar, 
schizophrenic. It was, I believe, at the time an 8-bed home, and that was quite the experience to start out 
with— 
I: 
I imagine. 
P: 
--that kind of care. It’s amazing. It can be frustrating. They have a lotta rights for the times too, and the 
staff don’t have a whole lot. So, you have to endure a lot. You have to go in every day to work thinking of it as 
an adventure, meeting somebody new, and that’s just what I did. After that, I went to in-home care—going to 
people’s homes. That was—I liked that a whole lot better because it was more personal, more one-on-one, 
helping them with their medical needs. That was more fun to me because it was personal. Then I moved back 
into an AFC home, and that was more—it was a home setting, but it was kind of like a nursing home, but they 
made it into a home setting. Each person had a bedroom, not a room, clinical, and that’s what I liked about it. 
There wasn’t anything clinical about it. And they were there because it was end-of-life. That was a first 
experience with that. Then I liked my job even more because I was able to give them what they wanted, what 
they needed, hold their hand. A lot of them see you as a granddaughter or a daughter, and I always went into 
work every day, what if this was my mom? What if this was my grandmother? How would I want the person 
taking care of them to treat them? And that was it. I was taught [laughs], and I’ve just done it ever since. I 
wouldn’t give it up. Wouldn’t give it up. 
I: 
Did you have any experience before you went into that first AFC? Any experience, any training, any—
did you know what you were getting into? 
P: 
No. I had no idea. Other than raising kids, and taking care of a significant other, I had no experience 
whatsoever. I did go to college for medical administrative assistant. Hadn’t had a job in that [1.25.58] yet 
because I can’t seem to leave this [laughing] whole caring for people. I’m hands on instead of paperwork. I’m 
not a desk person. I wanna take care of people. 
I: 
Did you get any training with the AFC? 
P: 
Lots of training. I had to go to, and it was required. You had to take blood-borne-pathogen classes, 
nutrition classes, medication classes. It’s not coming to me. Like personal care, and then we had to take 
classes for HIPPA. Very, very important. That was mandated once a year, I believe. And I still to this day take 
classes. You have to continue your training, your learning, your education every year. 
I: 
Are you certified nursing assistant? 
P: 
I’m not.

I: 
Okay. 
P: 
The most I’ve done—direct care worker—and the reason why I didn’t get certified nursing assistant, I 
didn’t get the education: 1) I felt, and maybe it’s a bad way to think of it, I don’t need a piece of paper telling me 
how to do—that I can do my job. I do know how to do my job. And then, unfortunately, in the 18 years I’ve done 
this, I’ve seen certified nursing assistants, with a piece of paper saying, “I can do this,” that can’t do their job. 
So, it’s frustrating to me that I don’t have this piece of paper, but I can do more than a certified nursing 
assistant can. 
I: 
So, the training was through the AFC? 
P: 
It was through the AFC, most of it. And then when I did the bigger AFCs—even the individual home-
health aide, I still had to do training. I had to go to classes for them as well [1.23.53].  
I: 
Because it was through an agency? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
I see.  
P: 
So, all of that I’ve had to do. 
I: 
You’ve had quite the range working with people with behavioral disabilities all the way up to end-of-life. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
It sounds like end-of-life is what you really like? 
P: 
Yeah. A lot of people have asked me, “Why don’t you get a job with Hospice?” Because I learned a 
long time ago when I started this kind of work, you have to be able to acknowledge when you’re getting burnt 
out yourself because then you will not be able to give the quality of care that somebody needs. You can give 
quantity all day, but you have to be able to give quality. It’s time to take a break. It’s time to say, I need to use a 
couple vacation days, or I need a couple days off or—end-of-life is—it’s rewarding, but it’s sad. So, I could only 
be able to do it for just a short time, so that’s why I don’t go that far and make that my—just what I do. I’ve 
been able to—I’ve been very fortunate to keep it a variety. And not only that, it gave me more experience. It 
gave me an appreciation of what it takes and what I need to do to be able to do my job at the fullest. I take 
great pride in that. 
I: 
You should. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, you do end-of-life, but you have other types of clients as well? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. It’s a mix. 
P: 
And what I do now is for strictly older people. I work with seniors, and so you kinda get a mix. You have 
the seniors that are very vital, still driving. “You know, I’m 87 years old, and I still drive. My car’s in the garage.” 
I’m like, okay [laughs]. That’s wonderful. I think that’s awesome [1.21.46], but then you also have the 87 to 95-
year old’s that are at the end of their life, but they’re still at home, they’re still able to do some, but they just 
need a little help—showering, cleaning, grocery shopping, things like that. They’re still at their house. They can 
still get themselves up in the morning, but they may have fallen, so they’re afraid of falling again. I’m there to 
assist them, you know, joints don’t work as well anymore. So, you know, we do the shower. You know, what 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
2
they can’t reach, I help them out with. You know, and they’re very appreciative. Ninety-nine percent of them. 
You have your few [laughs], but I think when I get to be that age, I might get a little grumpy myself because 
they can’t—and a lot of it’s the women. 
I: 
And what do you mean by that? 
P: 
I mean women are caregivers. Women raise children. They take care of a house. They take care of 
their husbands or just taking care of themselves, and they get to a point they can’t do it. It’s very frustrating for 
them, very depressing for them. So, I go in there and I think of myself as their ray of sunshine for that 2 hours 
I’m there. I do my best to make them feel good whether it be blow-drying and curling their hair, and that just 
made their entire day. I have a client now [laughs] that she wants her curls. She has to have her curls, so we 
do the shower, you know, and we talk through the whole thing because I want to give her that respect, and I 
don’t want her to feel—like, it’s embarrassing to older people. Somebody’s gotta come in and shower me. 
They’re very private. They don’t wanna undress in front of me, so you have to keep the eye contact. You know, 
give them their integrity, and you know, and it makes a world of difference. When she’s done with her shower, 
you know, we get her dressed, and we go and get the blow dryer, and it’s—she’s to a point now that—she has 
Alzheimer’s, so she’s slowing down a lot, can’t remember, but she knows she likes her curls. And I love it. You 
know, she will fall asleep while I’m trying to blow-dry her hair, and I have to be very yoga about it because, you 
know, she’s down like this, and I’m trying to blow-dry her hair, and it’s awesome when I’m done, and I say 
there you go beautiful. You’re more beautiful than when we started. And she says, “Oh, no, I’m not.” I love it. 
And she’ll look in the mirror, and she’s got her curls, and she feels fantastic, which she got that relaxing hour of 
blow-drying the hair, you know, being pampered even though she doesn’t remember it, I know I made her day. 
You know, and I’ve been there for, mmm, a year now I think I’ve been going there, and I look forward to it. And 
even though she’s losing her memory, she knows I’m her shower lady. She sees my face, she knows what I’m 
there for, and it’s awesome. 
I: 
She recognizes you? 
P: 
Yes. She’ll get right up, and she’s ready for her shower [1.18.15]. That’s is my—what I call my 
paycheck. That’s my reward right there. Making her feel like a queen, you know, she took care of everybody for 
so long. It’s you’re turn. Let me take care of you. “Oh, well, I can’t do that.” Sure, you can. Sit back, enjoy it. I 
got this. I can sweep your floor, whatever it takes. It doesn’t matter man or woman, whatever it takes me to 
make them feel better, it’s worth every second of my time there. That’s I guess why—I remember—I’m sorry, 
what your question was [laughing]. 
I: 
I’m not sure either, but you’ve been doing great. 
P: 
That is what I do. 
I: 
Where does that come from within you? You’re obviously a natural born caregiver, and you have these 
natural skills, like how—just keeping eye contact to help maintain somebody’s dignity, where does that come 
from? 
P: 
I’m not sure to be honest with you. I have done factory jobs. I couldn’t keep the job. I’ve tried other jobs, 
and I tried waitressing. When you’re taking care of people, it’s not the same. It is not the same. I don’t know. 
You have to have the compassion. I guess I have the compassion. If I’m not taking care of somebody, I’m not 
happy, and my entire family tells me that. I have to take care—when I met my husband, he was so used to 
taking care of himself he wouldn’t let me take care of him. Well, I’ll wash that for you. “I can do it.” Well, no, so 
he had to [laughing] learn how to let somebody take care of him. And I had to learn how to let him take care of 
himself [1.16.17] a little bit. That was hard for me. It’s just me. 
I: 
It’s just who you are. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18

P: 
It’s just who I am. 
I: 
How do you take care of yourself? 
P: 
That’s been a struggle, believe it or not. That has been a real struggle for me because I was always so 
busy taking care of everybody else I forgot to take care of me [1.15.54]. And for a while I did end up getting 
sick because I wasn’t taking care of me or I didn’t have insurance because the AFC home I was working in 
didn’t offer insurance, so I had none. So, I didn’t go to the doctor regularly. I would forget to eat lunch, or I 
would have two people in two different rooms pulling their call lights, and lunch, oh, that was 3 hours ago. Well, 
[laughs] I’ll catch dinner. You know, so you have to balance. I still don’t quite have it, but I’m better at it now 18 
years later than I was when I first started. You know, I would go without breakfast because I’m a mom, you 
know. Get the kids up for school, then I have to get ready for work, and out the door I go. No breakfast, 
breakfast was coffee, you know. Lunch? Don’t have time for lunch, you know, you have to make the clients 
lunch, or if you’re doing in-home care, you grab a granola bar ‘cause you have to leave this house and get to 
this house. You know, so taking care of myself is a struggle. Taking care of other people is easy.  
I: 
But you seem to recognize now that you need taking care of as well as others— 
P: 
Yes. Yeah.  
I: 
And you’re okay with that. It’s just adjusting to figuring out how to do it. 
P: 
Yes. And I get reminders from my family. Now that my kids are older, you know, “What’d you have for 
lunch today?” Well, I took a granola bar, or some carrot sticks to [laughing] work. You know, but they help me 
remind myself that—and I’ve learned like I said, you have to recognize yourself when you’re reaching the 
burnout point. When you do need a break, you know. I struggled for many, many years because a lotta places 
didn’t offer vacation days, sick days. You know, they didn’t offer that, so I can’t afford to take off work, you 
know. Double shift? I’ll take it. You know, and you just have to do what you have to do, but it’s a struggle. 
I: 
So, now you work for the Commission on Aging. 
P: 
I do, and it’s an awesome job— 
I: 
And you like. So, tell, why do you love it so much? 
P: 
I love it so much: 1) the people that I help, 2) I couldn’t ask for a better more amazing supervisor than I 
have. 
I: 
And that makes a difference? 
P: 
It makes a huge difference. She listens to everyone of us. You know, if we’re struggling with something, 
she will give us different ideas how to approach it. If we need a day off, you know, I need a couple hours off. 
My daughter has a doctor’s appointment. “Well, let me see what I can do.” You know, most bosses, “This is 
your schedule. You need to work it. If you need time off, put a slip in.” Well, I just found out about this. You 
know, she works with us. She most of all—she recognizes and tells us all the time that we have skill. We have 
a real skill. It takes a skill to do what we do, and she tells us that all the time. Recognizes it and appreciates it. 
I’ve never in 18 years  of work, I have never had a boss/supervisor like that. Never. And I can give you an 
example.  
I: 
Please do. 
P: 
For the job that I left to take this job [1.12.09], I worked for this company for 3 years. It was in-home 
healthcare, and we happened to have a client that was—it wasn’t medical, it was behavioral, and I struggle 
with PTSD. I didn’t know this at the time. I knew I had a history, but this client didn’t have behaviors at first, but 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18

we knew he had some self-destructive behaviors, but he never—at the time when the company took him on as 
a client, didn’t have outward towards anybody else. It was more self-destructive. Towards the end of my 
employment with this company, this particular person started acting out. I mean very violent behaviors towards 
us staff, and it was always one-on-one. We did 12-hour shifts with this person. Okay, first of all, 12-hour shifts 
were difficult. It was in his place of residence. We had to endure—one of his obsessions was ice fishing. It 
didn’t matter the temperature, your job was to walk out on that ice, and sit with him 8, 10 hours ice fishing if 
that’s what he wanted to do. I’m not built [laughs] for cold weather even though I live in upper Michigan. You 
know, but that was my job, and if I wanted to keep my job I had to do this. Well, I had over and over and over I 
spoke with the scheduler in my struggle in trying to raise children and keep this job. You know, work with me 
on the schedule, and there was no flexibility. “Here’s your schedule. You work it.” Okay. I went to my 
supervisor, and these behaviors on how much anxiety it gave me, and I just couldn’t do this because, 
unfortunately, in my personal past in what I’ve been through, you know, this, this, this was creating horrible 
things for me [laughing], and she just kept putting me off and putting me off. And “Well, you know, it’ll be all 
right. You have a couple days off. You know, regroup, and you don’t go back for a couple days.” This went on 
for months [1.09.39], months, and finally she told me “Because this person was through mental health you 
need to go see his psychiatrist. If the psychiatrist feels that we need to pull you out of there, we will.” Yeah. So, 
I had to go speak to a psychiatrist, and he said, “You should have been pulled out of there a long time ago.” 
But I had to go through all of this. This was like a year that I went through this with the scheduler and 
supervisor, and nobody was listening to me. So, my supervisor, now, I appreciate her so much. I mean she—if 
she’s busy and she is, she has a lot on her plate, she will schedule a time for us to come in and talk to her. So, 
she’s there, and there’s no interruptions. “What do you need? What can I help you with?” You know, and I can’t 
tell you how much we appreciate that because there’s not many out there. You know, so I think they need 
recognition as well as we do because their job is not easy either. You know, she has to be there for the clients, 
that’s her job, but she’s also there for us. You know that takes some kinda work. 
I: 
It sounds like she really encourages the self-care. 
P: 
Oh, yes. 
I: 
And helps you— 
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
And supports that. 
P: 
Exactly, and that’s hard to find, so I will be at this job until I retire [laughing]. It took me—I’ve been 
there—this fall it’ll be 4 years [1.07.59], so it took me all those years to find a job like this. 
I: 
You have no intention of leaving this line of work? 
P: 
On, no. Absolutely not. None whatsoever. 
I: 
Because you love it? 
P: 
I love the job. I love the people that I work for. I love the people that I go in and work for. The other 
homemakers, the caregivers, we support each other. You know, if I’m gonna have time off of work, and one of 
the other girls is going to fill in for me, they’ll get a hold of me. You know, what do I expect? “What works, what 
doesn’t? Do I need to know anything?” You know, so when they go in there, they already have an idea of what 
I do, how I do, and that is—it’s funny because a lotta the old people they get a routine. They get a schedule. 
I’ve been coming in there for a year. They know when I’m gonna clean their bathrooms. They know what 
routine I use when I go in there. You know, this is my visiting time with them. This is my, you know, work time, 
and they get into that. How do I do things, what I use for cleaning, how do they get their baths, whatever. And 
so, some of them will say, “If you’re going on vacation, I don’t want anybody else. I’ll wait for you to come back, 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
5
which is sweet. It’s appreciated. I feel so good that they say that, but I don’t want them to go without services 
either. So, I reassure them, you know, don’t worry. It’s okay. I will talk to the girl that is coming in, and I’ll give 
her an idea of what I’m doing. Some will say, “Okay.” Some will say, “Absolutely not.” I do have a few that will 
not [laughs] let anybody else come in. They’ll wait for me, so I try not to take too much time off of work, but I do 
take time off of work. You know, like I try and keep that balance, and they appreciate it. I appreciate it. You 
know, I couldn’t ask for better, and that makes me a good caregiver. You know, to have that kind of supervisor, 
and to have those kind of people to take care of, you know. 
I: 
We’re gonna pause just for a moment. 
P: 
Okay. I told you I could talk a lot. 
I: 
I’m glad. No, you’re doing great, and you said you can’t think on your feet very well. I totally disagree. 
P: 
[Laughing] this is actually the nervousness. 
I: 
So, it’s working in our favor [laughs]. 
P: 
When I’m nervous I talk a lot [1.05.22]. 
I: 
You talk more? 
P: 
I talk a lot. 
I: 
Yeah. Well, you’re doin’ fine. Yeah. 
P: 
Yeah. I start answering a question, then I forget you ask. 
I: 
No, you’re doing exactly— 
P: 
Just put it in order in your video—edit it [group laughter]. 
I: 
We could switch things up a little. 
I2: 
That’s funny. 
I: 
I’ve neglected to tell you that we’re going to do three kind of 20-25-minute blocks. That was the first one 
P: 
Okay. That was 25 minutes already? 
I: 
Well, yeah. 
P: 
Oh, my, gosh. That went fast. 
I: 
That’s amazing. 
P: 
Well, you did email me the sections we were gonna do, and I’m talking I’m thinking of those sections, 
and I’m going here, and here, and here, oh, back over here. I’m like, oh [laughs]. 
I: 
We’re actually following it in pretty good order, so you’re doing great. We will shift gears again as soon 
as he’s ready. 
I2: 
Pretty close.  
I: 
The other thing I neglected to tell you is just ignore him, okay. 
P: 
Oh. I look at him once in a while. I feel like I’m in the middle [1.04.18]. 
I2: 
I noticed that we didn’t say that until after we had already started, and I was just like, no. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

I: 
Yes. He’s very entertaining, and very nice looking, but just pretend he isn’t there— 
P: 
Okay [laughing]. 
I: 
And actually, he may ask some questions as well, but then he’ll act like he’s not paying any attention to 
you, so don’t be offended. 
P: 
[Laughing] okay. I’m used to that. I have four boys and a husband. 
I: 
So, it’s just he’s— 
I2: 
In fact, I’m very intently listening to the audio and checking the video all the time, so and on that note 
I’m ready to go. 
I: 
Okay. All right. So, you’ve mentioned a couple of things, and I’d kind of like to segue into talking 
about—you’re going to do this forever— 
P: 
Forever— 
I: 
--until you retire. 
P: 
Yup. 
I: 
And I am sure over the last 18 years and over the next 18 you’re going to have this huge range of 
experiences. 
P: 
Oh,  yeah. 
I: 
You said every day is an adventure. 
P: 
It is. 
I: 
And I think that’s one of the interesting things about homecare work is you don’t really—I mean you do 
get to know people over time and get a routine and everything, but especially those first visits, you really don’t 
know who you’re talking to [1.03.08].  
P: 
You don’t, and—especially for somebody like me, it is a lot of anxiety because-and this is where our 
supervisor also comes in, because she meets with us before we go to the house. And she tells us what she got 
a feel of, and because she spends a good hour, sometimes more, with the person doing an evaluation. So, 
she’ll give us what’s needed in the home, you know, what kinda personality she got a feel for, and we have 
quite the range of—I wouldn’t necessarily say hoarders, but there’s hoarders. And we have to try and go in and 
our job is to try and organize and clear some of that out because sometimes it’s at a borderline of a health 
issue. So, we try and prevent that. We try and help. Sometimes we can’t. Sometimes you go into a home and 
it’s a couple—an older couple. One is receptive of the care, the other one is not. And sometimes that can 
cause issues. You have to be very careful. It’s difficult sometimes because you don’t wanna step on toes. You 
wanna be respectful, but you have a job to do as well. You know, and it’s frustrating, and it can be difficult. 
Most people are nice, but you do have those ones that you’re not [whispering] so sure about. You go in with 
the idea the care could be this much, and it’s really this much, and you’re very overwhelmed. It’s a lot more 
physically challenging for you, and you’re wore out when you walk out of that home because so much has to 
be done in a very short period of time. 
I: 
Tell me about a situation, a time, when you walked in and you were expecting to do, you know, one 
thing, but you were faced with something completely different. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
7
P: 
That’s a lot [laughs]. Well, there was one home that—I was filled in [1.00.25]—what to expect, but by 
the time I got there—I knew that the couple was incontinent, so you know, be aware that there is an odor in the 
house. Well, when I got to the home to do my job not only are they incontinent, she also has a colostomy  bag, 
which in turn creates some messes in the home, in the bathroom, and I only go there—they only will accept our 
help every other week, so those messes are there for some time, and that takes quite a bit to—I have to work 
harder than I would in—what do I wanna say? Not normal, but normal home to cleaning the bathroom. It takes 
me way longer. I’m trying to help them so there isn’t such an odor in the house, so it’s not such a health issue. 
So, that’s one that I went in. Another one, if you wanna talk about a totally different aspect, I do have a house 
that I go to that I know she has some breathing issues. She has COPD. She’s on oxygen. Her COPD is way 
more advanced than I thought, and actually had to—I went there one time, which was not that long ago 
[laughs] and I had to end up calling an ambulance for her. She kept saying she was fine, and I thought, mmm, 
you have to use your judgment, and every person is different. Every person is different where she could have 
been fine, I felt she didn’t—wasn’t, but maybe to her son, “Oh, yeah, this is typically, you know. She’ll be alright 
tomorrow.” So, you have to—what you expect when you walk in, may not be what you get. You know, then 
there’s the whole behavioral aspect, you know, if you’re doing mental health part. That’s just a variety you just 
don’t know. 
I: 
Give us an example. 
P: 
I had a house that I went to that was—I believe she was an 11-year-old girl. I can’t remember exactly 
what challenge she had, but I was told it was a 10 or 11-year-old girl. She did have behaviors now and again, 
but not terrible. Mom was the only caregiver, and I was to go in as a respite. Okay. You know, nobody told me 
that she was a runner, so I went there 10, 11-year-old girl, oh, let’s go for a walk. Don’t want her cooped up 
inside [56.56]. Not only was she a runner, but she was also a kicker, a hitter, a spitter, pulling hair. Yeah. I was 
not aware of this, so the first couple times I was there—and actually, I was fortunate. I do have a daughter that 
has bipolar, so I’ve had some experience in moody behaviors. So, I’m lucky I guess. Going into a situation that 
you’re not aware of, I knew kinda somewhat how to handle it. Unfortunately, because I was not given all the 
information, the first time I didn’t handle it correctly. I ended up getting hurt. 
I: 
In what way? 
P: 
Because she was kicking me and punching me, and trust me, a 10, 11-year-old little girl [laughing] has 
like the strength if she wants to, and I ended up getting scratched quite a bit, and I didn’t appreciate that at all. 
My company actually knew about these behaviors before I went into the house; however, all of the home aides 
that had been there before me, refused to go after they experienced the behavior. 
I: 
The company did not tell you? 
P: 
No. And that was rough, so— 
I: 
How did you do it? How did you protect yourself? ‘Cause you don’t want to, like smack her. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
You can’t do that. 
P: 
But this is where I was very fortunate, and because my first job was in the behavioral home—adult 
foster care home, we had to have training back then. You could do what they call take downs. That was 
acceptable back then. I don’t believe it is now, but I could be wrong. Where they teach you how to basket-wrap 
somebody so that person doesn’t get hurt and you don’t get hurt, which you just wrap yourself around them 
and holding their arms, so they can’t punch you. And then you help them down to the ground. You both go 
down to the ground, so then there’s no hitting, kicking [54.32], you know, you wrap your legs around them. So,

that’s how I was able to because she was 10 or 11, luckily, because I’m short [laughs] I just after the first time 
when I went back I knew what to expect. I wasn’t gonna give up. 
I: 
So, just educate me. What happens when you’re both down on the ground? Then what do you do? 
P: 
You wait. You wait until the behavior has stopped. You have to stay there and hold that person, and 
they also teach you how to—back then I learned how to hold the person on the ground, so they don’t get hurt, 
and a lot of them will bang their head on the floor or try and whip back and hit you to let them go, so you 
position yourself, so your body is against their head. They don’t get hurt, and you don’t get hurt. And they can 
do what they have to do, you know, with their adrenalin without hurting themselves and without hurting you. 
I: 
And eventually it rides it’s course? 
P: 
Eventually, they wear down, and once they wear down then you’re good to go. 
I: 
So, I should mention since we—I don’t have the visual on here, that you’re not a very big person. 
P: 
No. I’m 5’ 2 1/2” now. I shrunk a half an inch [laughs], and I’ve actually put on weight. I’m about 115, 
now [53.06]. Back then I was about 100 pounds. 
I: 
So, at that time an 11-year-old girl can be that big and bigger— 
P: 
I’ve already had to help—the one woman was 6’ 2” and weighed well over 200 pounds. It took three of 
us and thank goodness there was the home manager that was there that day, and two staff. That was another 
situation, yeah. 
I: 
Now, what do you do if you’re in a home alone, and you’re not in a facility. You don’t have a staff. 
You’re there by yourself. 
P: 
The particular job that I have now, if I were to run into that situation, I’d walk out. That is their policy. 
That you are not there, you know, you remove yourself from the situation. You call the office. You call 911, and 
that’s that. I don’t have to—I don’t have to do anything. You know, being that I’ve had the training how to do it, I 
probably would ‘cause that’s just who I am. If I don’t, before 911 gets there, they could hurt themselves. They 
could hurt somebody else in that home. 
I: 
But you step out and let—if it happened while 911 is on the way? 
P: 
Correct. 
I: 
Okay. So, before we started this interview, you were talking about the need for male PCAs. 
P: 
Yes. I wish—I truly, truly wish more males would be willing to be personal care givers because one job 
that I had I was very lucky because they would schedule male homecare givers with the larger—I mean I’ve 
had to go in a home with a 300-pound man, and I had to get him in the shower with a lift. Get him out of the 
shower. I mean it was a struggle, so if more males would come into this line of work it would be so helpful to us 
smaller females [laughing] [50.46], you know, and I think they would be good caregivers. I really do, but a lot of 
‘em find that they don’t have quite as many patience as a woman does, so we don’t have a lotta males. But I 
really feel it would be beneficial for the patients, clients, consumers especially for the males. A lotta males 
struggle with a female coming in and taking care of them especially our veterans. They have a lotta pride, and 
they should. They have a lotta—they wanna keep their dignity. They don’t want some female coming in and 
helping them with a shower. You know, and I do have—I have had a few that we both struggled. I had a job to 
do to help him, but he just—so, I had to figure out a way that I could help him with a shower, he could keep his 
dignity, but his hygiene was still kept up. You know, and it was a struggle for both of us, and I was very, very 
fortunate that he was willing to work with me. You know, and I had to kinda—I put it back in his hands. How do 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
9
you wanna do this. Tell me how you want me to help you? You know, if we had more males, you know, people 
would be able to have the option. Would you prefer a male or a female? When you got to the doctor a lotta 
times when you’re signing up for a new doctor, “Would you prefer a male or a female doctor?” Why can’t in-
home care people have the same choice? You know, I wish—I don’t know what I could say to more males out 
there—please consider it. You know, it’s hard work, but it’s very rewarding. You’ll learn patience. Your patients 
have to learn patience with you. You know, you can work together [48.37], but a lotta of ‘em won’t, and there’s 
a lotta reasons when they don’t have patience. I’ve heard, “I can’t support my family with this kind of work,” or 
“In order to support my family I have to work double shifts, then I don’t see my family.”  
I: 
And isn’t that what the women are doing? 
P: 
That’s what the women are doing. You know, I don’t know if it’s because that’s just what we have in us 
or—for me, it’s what I know. You know, and I’ve struggled as far as the pay, and you just learn to work around 
it.  
I: 
So, we’ve had a couple of the men anyway say they’ve been told, “That’s women’s work. What are you 
doing women’s work for?”  
P: 
That’s true. I’ve heard that. I have heard that.  
I: 
You don’t buy it? 
P: 
I don’t buy it. You know what, I’m going out there whether I’m working in a factory or doing in-home 
came. I’m out there working 8, 10, 12 hours just like you are, so when I come home if you happen to have the 
day off and I had to go to work, clean the kitchen, cook dinner. You know, it’s 50:50. I haul wood at my house. 
You know, I don’t expect my boys and my husband just to do that. I want my house heated as well. I enjoy the 
heat. I set my thermostat at 75 [laughs]. You know, so I need help. It has to be—it’s not women’s work. We’re 
not back in 1940 – ’50 [laughs]. You know, it’s everybody’s job. It’s your job as a younger person to take care 
of the elderly, to take care of the disabled because when you get to that point in your life you’re going to want 
somebody there. And if you happen to be one of those people that, “Oh, I don’t wanna show—oh, I don’t 
wanna woman lookin’ at me or washing my private parts,” then you’d really appreciate a male homecare giver. 
I: 
Now, we had one gentleman say he will not take female clients, partly because he’s so concerned 
about allegations of sexual misconduct. 
P: 
That’s true. That’s true, unfortunately, that happens, but I could flip the tables and say, hmm, some of 
the people we take care [laughing] that have lost their significant other, you know, for many years, you come 
in—depending on the age of the person—I have seen, I’ve witnessed, and it’s quite embarrassing where I’ve 
gone into a home training a male person—we’ve gone into a home for a female, and she’s very interested in 
the young man or vice a versa. You go into a gentleman’s home to take care of him, and you know, they’re 
very forward sometimes. And that’s something else we have to deal with. 
I: 
You’ve experienced that? 
P: 
Oh, well, yes. 
I: 
Can you give us some examples? 
P: 
Gentleman lost his wife. I was in there helping—I helped take care of his wife [45.21] at her end-of-life. 
She was gone, mmm, probably a year, so some time had passed. And he knew me ‘cause I had been in his 
house with his wife, you know, taking care of her, so we got to know each other. Now, then I was going in his 
house taking care of him, helping him with showers, and of course, so because his wife was sick for so long he  
hadn’t had really female companionship one-on-one. Well, he enjoys my company, and then of course, you 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
10
know, you help him with showers and you get all kinds of personal information that you really don’t wanna hear 
[laughs]. And, you know, I’m a hugger. I like hugging people. It makes me feel good, you know, and he decided 
to hug a little tighter, hands went a little lower, and you know, it’s like, um, that’s not—you can’t do that. I don’t 
appreciate that. And then unfortunately, I’m not sure why, maybe I’m too laid back, but it kept happening, and it 
kept getting worse where I actually went to my supervisor about it. So, sometimes—and even if you say it 
sternly they don’t hear you, so you have to deal with that more often than you realize. You know, you have to 
endure that, and it’s not fun. 
I: 
You started that story by saying you had to learn how to deal with that? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You come up with some strategies? 
P: 
Yeah. Mmm hmm. Some of the instances were very, very uncomfortable. I’ve asked not to be sent back 
to certain homes because of it because the gentleman was so forward, and I just would not go back [42.57]. 
I: 
This would be a good time for a male PCA. 
P: 
It would, and it would, yeah. They need to—we need somebody to recruit and advocate for more of 
them. You know, I’m not sure—I don’t think any—a lotta males think about it. I really don’t. I mean back in the 
day men were picked on for being nurses. You know, why? Most of ‘em are fantastic, but in-home caregivers, 
none of ‘em—there’s no—I don’t want to say advertisement, but there’s no information I guess. Nobody talks to 
men about it. You know it’s a tough-man’s world. You know, forget it. What about those caring men out there? 
Why can’t we get the information out there, and then they can choose. I think we would have more males at 
least look into it, try it, and I think—I know a lotta men in my personal life that would be fantastic at it. 
I: 
Have you ever mentioned it to ‘em? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Give it a try? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And they say? 
P: 
I have a good job, and I don’t wanna leave it. And they do, and they make more money than they would 
doing the homecare, and that’s a lot of it—more money, better benefits, so they’re not gonna leave. You know, 
and that’s very unfortunate, very unfortunate ‘cause we could use the help, really. I mean we work—I’m lucky. I 
work an 8-hour day, but when I worked in the homes or I did through an agency, in-home healthcare, I worked 
10, 12 hours. You know, and if we would have had more males or I had to work 12 hours with a 300-pound 
person to do the full shift, and I was responsible for getting them outta bed, getting them a shower. Whereas 
they could have scheduled a male in there instead of me. 
I: 
It wouldn’t have been as hard on that person physically. 
P: 
Right. Exactly. 
I: 
It might not have taken as long. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Okay.  
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
11
P: 
Yeah. There’s a whole lot of—whole list of advantages to male caregivers [40.40], you know. The 
gentleman would have been probably more comfortable because he was so large, you know. And it was a 
struggle for him to be in that lift chair. You know, it was a real struggle, and I just grunted and groaned, and I 
got it done, but I think he would have appreciated it much more because he felt bad for me as well. And why 
should he feel bad, you know, he shouldn’t. So, that just added more stress for him. 
I: 
Okay. Short break. While he’s swapping out, I’m dying to hear the end of the VA story—the guy who 
you said you were both feeling awkward, and you figured out a way to get it done? 
P: 
Yeah. So, I would help him get his pants off, and his socks and shoes ‘cause he couldn’t quite get that 
on, and we would get him down to his underwear. I did make sure he got in the tub okay, and he’s sit on a 
shower chair, and then he would take his boxers off and hand ‘em out the shower for me. 
I: 
Out of the curtain? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
You’d pull the curtain, and then he’d take his boxer’s off. Okay. 
P: 
Right. And mostly I was there because he had a hard time lifting his arms at any height, so I he would—
I’d get out the biggest wash cloth he had in his cupboard, and he’d lay it over his lap, and I’d wash his hair for 
him, and then I’d give him his body wash. He’d wash everything that he could, and then he’d put the wash cloth 
back, and we’d rinse everything off, and then when he was done then I would hand him a towel through the 
shower curtain, and he’d dry off his front, put the towel in his lap, I’d dry off his back, and then I’d help him out 
with the towel in front of him, and then I made sure I was—his backside didn’t bother him quite as bad for me 
to see, so I’d dry his backside off, and have him sit on a—he had a bench in his bathroom. He’d put his 
underwear on, and then we were good to go [38.28]. Twice a week. 
I: 
Wow. 
P: 
Yup, and he got to keep his dignity, but he was able to get his hair washed. When I first started going 
there, oh, my, gosh. His hair hadn’t been washed in—it was bad, bad, bad. Yeah. Terrible. 
I2: 
I’m ready. Wait a second. I need to change cards here. 
I: 
Okay. While he’s doing that, tell me [laughs]—one of the things we want to do is, as we said before, is 
put a human face and humanize who you are, the work that you do, hoping that your story will touch people, 
and we understand that there’s much, much more to you than your job, right? You have eight kids. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
A dog named, Charlie? 
P: 
Charlie. 
I: 
Charlie. Husband. You love—we’re sitting in the most marvelous place in the deep woods, it feels like. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Which you described as your getaway from work. 
P: 
It is. 
I: 
You work with people all day long, and then you like to— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
12
P: 
Yup. I come home, and more or less detach. I’m out of town. The only ones I have to deal with are 
myself, my family, the animals, my garden. I love my garden [36.55], and I get to take care of—I guess that’s 
where taking care of me comes in. You know, I get to cook my dinner, talk to the kids. How was your day at 
school or at work? And then, you know, showers, and then when they’re in bed, I come out and sit on the 
porch. For example, this last weekend my daughter came up— 
I2: 
I’m ready. 
P: 
--with her husband and three grandkids, and we came out here at about 10:30 last night, and I showed 
them the most amazing sky you could possibly imagine. There were so many stars up in that sky, and I can sit 
out here every night, as long as it’s not raining, and look in that sky, and it’s just like fantastic. This is my 
getaway. Fifteen miles out of town, this is my little island. 
I: 
Your self-care. 
P: 
Yup. 
I: 
Yeah. Good. I’m glad you have it. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
I guess we’re ready? 
I2: 
Yup. 
I: 
Okay. This final segment I want to look at the bigger picture. I know when we started you said you’re 
here to speak on behalf of all PCAs, and this is your chance to do it. 
P: 
Oh, my. 
I: 
You’re gonna be a spokesperson, and I’m so glad that you are. So, we want to talk sort of about—just 
pretend I’m somebody from the public. I don’t know anything about what you do, and you’re explaining to me 
what you do for people and why it’s important? 
P: 
What I do for people? Well, in one sense I feel like I don’t do enough, but in the other sense I’ve been 
on the other spectrum where I’ve done everything. It depends really on what care level you’re at [34.53]. When 
you’re in AFC Home it could be more medical, whereas you are cleaning up messes all the time. 
I: 
When you say messes, what do you mean? 
P: 
I  mean feces, urine, vomit, you’re turning people that are three times bigger than you are, you’re trying 
to change a bed with the client in the bed because they’re bed-ridden. You clean, cook. In some of your jobs 
as a homecare giver, it’s a housewife magnified by 100. In other ones, where it’s more medical, it’s more 
demanding as far as the responsibility of meds, the changing beds with clients in it. It’s somebody who’s at the 
end-of-life, and you’re trying to do your best to take care of that person, but you also have their family there 
asking questions, you know. “What can we expect? Is it their time?” You don’t have this information. You don’t 
have this—so much is expected out of you. You have to keep a schedule, you know. Everybody needs their 
meds at a certain time. It’s a lot of responsibility. That’s the big thing. It’s a lotta responsibility. There’s timelines 
to meet for meds, meals, a lotta different—showers, you know. Sometimes it’s a struggle for somebody in a 
shower. There is a lotta responsibility for a homecare giver. The job I have now, my title actually is, 
homemaker. I don’t like that title at all.  
I: 
Why? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
13
P: 
Because there’s so much more that I do. A stereotypical homemaker is a stay-at-home mom, stay-at-
home housewife, and I realize this when I went to finance a car [laughs]. You know, “What’s your occupation?” 
Oh, I’m a homemaker. “Oh, you stay at home.” No, I don’t. I work very hard, so I don’t appreciate that title very 
much because we do so much more. We are caregivers whether it be in the home, in a facility. We are 
caregivers. That’s what we do. We’re caring for people whether it be changing their briefs because they 
messed ‘em, cleaning up their urine off the floor because they couldn’t make it, you know. Remind them to take 
their meds or sometimes we do have to count meds out, you know, make sure that they’re taking them [31.55]. 
It’s a lotta responsibility. I’m more than a homemaker. I’m a very hardworking caregiver. 
I: 
What do you think about people who would say, “How hard can it be to fix a meal?” 
P: 
Well, think about it this way. Everybody has a grandma that they’ve tried cooking for, but this grandma 
has cooked for 60 years, and she knows how she wants it done, and you cook something for her and tell you 
what. That meal is not gonna be the way she wants it, and while you’re cooking that meal you also have to 
assist her to the bathroom four times because she forgot that she went to the bathroom 5 minutes ago 
because she has dementia, and while you’re doing that go start the laundry. Don’t forget it’s in there. It’s not 
just a meal. 
I: 
And I’m also thinking about special diets, people have difficulty swallowing. 
P: 
Yes. Trouble swallowing, or they have allergies. Maybe you do or don’t know about because it isn’t your 
family. You know, so there’s a lot of things you have to think about. There’s a lotta things you have to juggle. 
The job I have now, I’m given a 2-hour timeslot to go in there and clean everything that needs to be cleaned, 
and sometimes it’s not enough. Try cleaning an entire house in 2 hours. You know, you do the best you can. 
Plus, this person is lonely. You are the only person that they see once a week for 2 hours, so they want you 
just to sit and talk to them, but you know your job is cleaning, or in the case of the other homecare jobs I’ve 
done, my job is to come in and I have an hour and a half. I have to bath this person, change their bedding, get 
their laundry going, make sure the kitchen is cleaned up, make sure that they have all their meds, and then 
hurry up and move to the next one, and make sure I’m giving quality care [29.46] not quantity care.  
I: 
And if these people didn’t have you, what would they do? If they didn’t have somebody like you, PCA? 
P: 
Most of the people that have us coming in, if they didn’t have us they’d be in nursing homes, and a lot 
of them will tell you that. I am so thankful that lady that I was talking about that was on oxygen, had COPD, and 
I had to call an ambulance, the next time I was scheduled to go to her house, she thanked me a 100 times 
when I was there because if it wouldn’t have been for her, first of all she may not have survived. Second of all, 
they may have not let her come out of the hospital, you know, because I’m there to help her clean her house, 
and she has other people coming in to assist her with her showers. She’s able to stay home, you know, with 
her son. 
I: 
And why is that so important? 
P: 
That’s very important to people to be at home. And I hear over and over, “This is my home. You’re 
gonna have to drag me outta here feet first.” And they appreciate that I come in to help them, so they can stay 
in their home, and I am thankful I can come into their home and help them stay in their home and not be in a 
facility where one staff has 12 people that’s assigned to them, and they’re overworked, and they’re giving 
quantity care not quality care. Not that caregivers in facilities don’t give quality care because most of ‘em do. 
But they’re overwhelmed. They’re over—they have too many. You know, I’m thankful I can give that one-on-
one care, and most—99% of my clients appreciate that I do come in, so they can stay in their home [27.45]. 
This is their home. This is where they lost their spouse. This is where they’ve raised their kids. This is their 
home. It’s their sanctuary. [Inaudible -wind] they don’t wanna leave.

I: 
So, as you know, we have a huge shortage of personal care workers. 
P: 
Yes, we do. 
I: 
We need more, desperately. The statistic that always amazes people is that it’s anticipated that we’re 
gonna need 32,000 more PCAs by 2020, which is a year and a half away. So, where are all of these PCAs 
gonna come from? And we don’t want just, as you say, people giving quantity care, we want quality, right? 
P: 
I’m hoping that somewhere along the line—I do have eight children—four boys, four girls—so, I’m 
hoping somewhere along the line at least one of my four girls or one of my boys would get in this line of work. I 
always think of it as I’m always talking to other people ‘cause they’ll ask  me, “What do you do?” You know, so 
I tell them. “Oh, well I wouldn’t wanna do that. That’s not—that’s a nasty job.” No, actually, it’s not. You’d be 
amazed at the stories you hear. And I have actually, in 18 years, have gotten quite a few people to check into 
it, and at least half of them are still working in that field.  
I: 
Hmm. We need you to be a recruiter. 
P: 
[Laughs] we need a lotta people. We need more advocacy for caregivers [25.56]. 
I: 
What kind of advocacy? 
P: 
We need—I hear so many times people talking, “Oh, you know, working in a nursing home you have to 
work so many hours and you’re cleaning up poop all the time, and you know, nobody cares, and you’re 
working long hours, and you have to work every—it’s horrible work. Don’t do that.” It’s not. It really isn’t. I can’t 
say 100% that every boss is amazing, that every facility is amazing because it’s not, but the work is very 
rewarding. The pay—I’m sorry, the pay is not great. Unfortunately, that’s where we lose a lotta people between 
the pay and the benefits. We lose a lotta people. They can’t make a living, and if they do stick it out, they have 
to work double shifts. They have to pick up whatever shift they can to get a decent paycheck, and 
unfortunately, that hurts the clients, the patients, as well as hurting the caregivers. The caregivers are getting 
burnt out, and the patients are suffering for it because they don’t get the quality care ‘cause this person’s trying 
to make ends meet, and this person is just trying to be cared for, and it’s not working. It’s not working. 
I: 
So, again, when we started you said you wanted to speak on behalf of other personal care workers, 
what did you have in mind? What did you wanna say? 
P: 
I’m not sure. I have so much to say, but I guess I don’t know how to say it.  
I: 
Well, take a minute. 
P: 
I would love to see, like I said, a lot more advocacy for homecare workers. Get rid of that stereotype 
that it’s horrible. It’s not horrible. I would love to see somehow through training how people can give quality 
care not quantity care. Don’t let facilities or anybody demand quantity care out of you [23.42], you know. Give 
us more resources, give us more information on resources that we have as caregivers, that we can pass along 
and give to other people. We need people to take our jobs seriously. It’s not a joke. We’re just not house 
cleaners. You know, it’s hard work, and I go into every home thinking, if this was my mother. Here’s a good—
this is what I want to say. Whoever you are, state representative, a congressman, a mayor, I want you to just 
stop for 1 minute, and I want you to say to yourself, my mother needs somebody to come and take care of her. 
Okay, if I hire you, want kind of care are you gonna give my mother? If this was my mother, and as a worker, a 
caregiver, I want you to ask yourself every time you go into work, if this was my mother, if this was my 
grandmother, what kind of care would I want her to have? ‘Cause when I go in a home, if this was my 
grandmother, I want her to be treated like a queen. But in order for us to be able to stay in this line of work, you 
have to help us. Keep the training coming, more training, better training. This last year my boss has found 
some amazing people that have had seminars that they were lucky—they pay us to go to, you know, and I’m

so thankful. I learn every time I go, I learn something. It’s fantastic. We need that, but we also need people to 
listen to us, that this is a real job. Someday it’s going to be you getting the care. What kind of care do you 
want? Do you want me coming in giving you quantity care, or do you want me coming in giving you quality 
care? Really, that’s what it comes down to. We all want to give quality care, but our paychecks say, you need 
to do quantity. Hurry up and get this done. It’s not fair to anybody [21.15]. 
I: 
So, I know the kind of care that I would want my mother to have. I think the question is, how do we 
make it possible for you to provide that kind of care? 
P: 
Give our supervisors the training that they need to listen to us. I have more bosses and supervisors and 
home managers that I can say that don’t listen. They don’t have the training on how to listen to us. We’re in 
these homes. We know what’s going on. This person needs another hour of care. I cannot do this. “Well, I’m 
sorry the schedule doesn’t allow for that.” Then hire somebody else. Hire somebody else. Or on the flip side of 
that, unfortunately, you have the companies that just hire anybody, and I’ve run into that problem. They don’t 
have the training. They don’t have a clue of what they’re getting into, so they’re not giving any care. They think 
the job is you go in, you make this person a sandwich for lunch, and there ya go. No, they have to be assisted 
to the bathroom. You know, look into it. Talk to us out here that do go into the home. What does it take to do 
your job? A lot. A lot. You have to be a caregiver, a mom, a grandma, an aunt, a sister, you know— 
I: 
A medical professional making some really life and death decisions. 
P: 
Exactly. You have to make decisions sometimes on ambulance, no ambulance. Call the family? You 
know, call the supervisor, and they call the family. Sometimes you’re put in those situations, you know. And so, 
like I said, I’m a very fortunate person because I have had from one extreme to the other, so I’ve had the most 
possible training down to the little piddly trainings that they do. So, I’m very lucky that I’m knowledgeable in a 
lot of different situations, but a lot of these caregivers that are coming into this don’t get that kinda training. So, 
they don’t know. 
I: 
So, you’ve had the training, which is important. You have 18 years of experience— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
But somebody could have 18 years of experience and have been doing it wrong for 18 years, right? 
P: 
I’ve seen that. 
I: 
So, you have 18 years of experience, plus the training. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
You’ve learned a lot over the years on how to handle different situations. 
P: 
I have. 
I: 
What would you tell a young person coming who might be considering this? Like one of your children 
about, you know, where they don’t have that experience? They don’t know [inaudible – wind]? 
P: 
I would encourage ‘em—if I young person [18.12] is thinking about getting in this line of work, I would 
very strongly encourage them, talk—if they know somebody who does this line of work, talk to that person. 
Find out the worst of it; find out the best of it. Call an AFC Home. Most of them allow visitors with a scheduled 
appointment. See if you can visit and go around with a caregiver. You know, with the HIPPA laws, it’s a lot 
stricter, so you may not be able to do that. But you might be able to talk to a caregiver that works in that home, 
you know. You can—there’s a lotta resources on line to get information. There’s a lotta people that’ll talk to 
you, and you have to talk to  more than one person because I have found in my experience, especially when it 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
16
comes to young people—because there is such a shortage, I’ll be honest, and I’ll use plain language, 
sunshine’s blowing up their hiney, and they give this perception that, “Oh, it’s an easy job. Come on in.” You 
know, and they’re hired, and they’ll leave. They run, and that’s not fair. That’s not fair [16.51]. 
I: 
So, what do you say to the employers, the agencies who are either—I guess, two questions here. What 
do you say to the agencies who don’t really care about quality and they’re just hiring, hiring, hiring, and if they 
quit and run, so what? I’ll get 10 more. 
P: 
It’s not gonna work. It doesn’t work because then you get somebody in there like me that you do hire 
that does care, and you’re gonna burn me out, and I’m gonna leave. So, now, you’ve lost what little bit of 
quality care you did have. They need to stop and really truly interview a person, and then really truly—you  
know what, some jobs that I’d have hired they’ve actually made me take a test. 
I: 
What kind of a test? 
P: 
Not really a test, like a questionnaire, so it was a test to see what responses I would have. You know, in 
this situation, what would I do? You know, and I had to write out how I would handle that situation. They knew 
they could hire me, and they’d gave good care. 
I: 
So, that was a test for critical thinking skills? 
P: 
It was critical thinking—how you handle—some of it was medical situations, you know, on the lighter 
end of medical situations. Some of it was how would you handle family member that came and started getting 
irate with you because they were misinterpreting the care you were giving. So, I was lucky, I knew how to 
handle it ‘cause I’d already had the training. So, that gives you a good perception on what knowledge this 
person has. So, you could still hire this person, but then you know what training to give them, you know, before 
you just start throwing them on your schedule. “Oh, we’ll train you as you go.” That doesn’t work [15.03]. 
I: 
You need it beforehand? 
P: 
You need it beforehand. 
I: 
What do you think about personality testing? Because there are some people who just, they’re not cut 
out for this job no matter what. 
P: 
I think you could do a personality testing, but I don’t think that would tell you much because every 
house you go in has a different personality. You have to adapt, and that’s part of being a good caregiver. Every 
room you go into that person is different than the room you just left. So, you have to adjust your personality a 
little bit. You have to adjust your attitude a little bit to accommodate that person to give them the dignity, the 
respect, the compassion that they deserve. So, the personality thing is hard because every person you run into 
has a different personality. 
I: 
So, what would you say to an employer who wants to be a good employer, and they want to—or they at 
least want to retain their workers— 
P: 
Training! Training, training, training. Please provide them training. These caregivers need more training. 
Almost every one of the homes that I worked in did the very minimal, state-required training. Please, you will 
get caregivers that will stay with your business a lot longer with that just a little bit of extra training. 
I: 
So, what I hear is employers need to hopefully someday pay people more, give ‘em training, but also 
show respect. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And how does an employer do that? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18

P: 
When your employee comes to you with an issue, really listen. Just don’t write, oh, okay. Write it down, 
and “I’ll get to that.” And 3 weeks later the employee’s trying to figure out why hasn’t this situation changed 
yet? Really listen. Really have that employee’s—what I call, have their back. Be supportive of them [12.49]. 
Listen! If there’s something you can do, help them change it. If there’s something they’re struggling with, try 
and help them figure it out. Even with my 18 years of experience, I still go to my supervisor and say, you know, 
I’ve got this situation. I’ve tried A, B, and C with this person, and I’m just not getting anywhere, and she has her 
own 20-plus years’ experience, and she’ll give me something that she’s tried with somebody else 15 years 
ago, and it worked for her. I’ll give it try, and wouldn’t you know it, my job is so much easier. This person is 
happier. Listen! You have to listen. 
I: 
So, in our last minute or two, on behalf of PCAs everywhere, any final words? 
P: 
Demand respect [laughs]. Demand respect [inaudible – wind] compassion. Please give quality care 
[inaudible]. And like I said, some day you’re going to be in that position, and you’re gonna need somebody to 
take care of you, and hopefully, somebody after me will be sitting here doing an interview saying the same 
thing, so I get the care that I deserve, and I’d like to have, you know, compassion. It takes a lotta compassion 
for this job. 
I: 
So, I have to say you are a marvelous spokesperson. You’ve done a wonderful job on behalf of all 
PCAs. 
P: 
Well, thank you. I appreciate it. 
I: 
Yeah. No. Thank you so much. It’s really seriously an honor to talk with you. 
P: 
Thank you. 
I: 
Thank you for this interview. Thank you for the work that you do. 
P: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
And what does your tattoo say? 
P: 
It says, no worries [11.10]. 
I: 
Ah, with angel wings. 
P: 
Yup.  
I: 
Is that to remind yourself? 
P: 
It is to remind myself. When I met my husband that was his—what I call, famous saying ‘cause I’m a 
worrier. I’m a worrier. I worry about everything. 
I: 
And he would say, “No worries.” 
P: 
He would say, “No worries, baby. It’s okay.” And it would just, shoo, so everyday when I feel myself, 
you know, especially when I’m stressing I’m not doing well enough for my job, I just rub my arm and say, no 
worries, and it’s gone. So, it helps. I think every home should have that saying in their house. 
I: 
No worries, yes. 
P: 
Every workplace should have that. 
I: 
[Laughs] 
P: 
It would help I think.

I: 
So, I hate to quit, but we must. K has his magic to work, and then, you know, we need to get out of your 
hair, so you can get things ready for your kids and your husband. 
P: 
Well, you made it very easy. I’m sorry I talk so much [laughing]. 
I: 
No. 
I2: 
You did perfectly. 
I: 
Absolutely, perfect. That’s exactly what we wanted. I think he wants to probably— 
I2: 
I’ll photograph you right here, actually. But I’m gonna wrap up first, and thanks one second. I’ll grab it. 
Thank you. 
I: 
And while he’s doing that I’m going get your gift card ready. 
P: 
Okay. That was actually fun. 
I: 
Yay! See. That wasn’t so bad was it? 
P: 
So, now that I talked about my boss a lot, how do I get somebody to go interview her to show 
employers of caregivers. That would be so fabulous. 
I: 
You know what, I actually think that—there are so many things we want to do, so I’m actually—this is 
one project that K and I are doing together. I have another major project. I’m the director of an organization—a 
new organization called IMPART Alliance, and we’re trying to—I think I mentioned that [9.07] training program 
earlier, Building Training, Building Quality? 
P: 
Oh,  yeah. 
I: 
So, a big focus of IMPART is to get this training up and running across the whole state, across the 
nation someday, but then we also wanna continue to do advocacy work on behalf of personal care workers, 
but we have so many ideas—things we want to do, and we’re hoping to stay in communication with you. 
P: 
Oh, absolutely. 
I: 
People like you, who might want to be part of other projects. One thing we’re hoping to do is to start a 
PCA Association. 
P: 
Oh, that would be wonderful. 
I: 
You think so? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Why so? Why do you think that would be wonderful? 
P: 
Well, first of all I guess I should ask what would that entail? 
I: 
[Laughing] 
P: 
To me, my stereo—I talk about stereotypes— 
I: 
What does that mean to you? 
P: 
PCAs that would—I don’t wanna call it a union, but like a union type thing. PCAs that have a voice, and 
who can advocate for all us other PCAs. I’m all for advocacy. I learned that in the behavioral home. Once I 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
19
learned that role because we had to be advocates [7.58] at mental heath for our residents, so that’s—I’m a big 
advocate. 
I: 
Good. So, can we tap that—we need your help. We need people to make noise. 
P: 
Like I said, my oldest daughter has bipolar, so I’ve dealt with mental health for so long that it was like 
can’t there be a job just for an advocate? I just wanna be an advocate and get paid for it too [laughs]. 
I: 
There actually are jobs like that. 
P: 
Really? That would be fabulous. But, yes, PCAs need—and I guess that’s what I see a PCA—personal 
care association being an association that advocates for personal care. 
I: 
That would be a big chunk of that. Another piece that we need to is to help establish some professional 
standards— 
P: 
Oh, that would be fantastic. 
I: 
--so that you don’t have the people who are just doing it for a pay check. If you want to belong to the 
association, you have to agree to abide by these certain standards. 
P: 
Oh, fabulous. 
I: 
Something like that. The other—another thing—facet of it would be giving you a forum for talking to 
each other and sharing ideas— 
P: 
That’s fantastic. 
I: 
--and coming together and learning from each other. Does that sound appealing? 
P: 
That’s actually very helpful, and like I said us girls get together, we’re [inaudible] for another one, we try 
really hard even if it’s just over texting over the phone after hours. You know, is there anything special you do 
for this person? You know, is there anything I need to know [6.23]. You know, so much [inaudible] and we only 
see each other—we have a staff meeting once a month, so we see each other at that. Other than that, we 
really don’t see each other at the job that I have now. Other than that, in the homes that you work at, you 
really—most of them have like a shift change. [Sigh] you have a lot of employees that don’t take their shift 
change seriously, so when you come on shift you get very little. “Oh, the woman in room 202 is doing good 
now. You know, no problems with any layouts,” and out the door they go. They didn’t bother saying, “Oh, well 
it’s been 3 hours since I’ve changed whatever.” You know, and you go in there and they’re just soaking wet. 
You know, so yeah, talking to each other— 
I: 
Communication— 
P: 
--or in the situation like, you know, I have this gentleman who doesn’t like to keep his hands to himself, 
you know, how do you handle that? 
I: 
Exactly. 
P: 
And even though the HIPPA laws are as strict as they are, I will be honest, all home caregivers talk to 
each other about—you don’t use names. It’s, I have this guy, or I have this woman, whatever. Sometimes they 
can figure it out, but, you know, we don’t do that. And it’s like venting. We vent to each other. 
I: 
You need to have a way to deal with—process things, right? 
P: 
To be able to have caregivers to come together to vent, to get different ideas would be so fantastic. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

I: 
Okay, so we might tap you for that. But to get back to your original idea, one of the ideas we would love 
to see eventually, someday, is manager training, supervisor trainings. 
P: 
Oh. 
I: 
And supervisor support ‘cause they need support as well. 
P: 
Yes. They do. 
I: 
And we are talking to supervisors. We sent those letters out, and we’re gonna follow those up with, you 
know, thank you very much for passing the word on. We’ve been doing trainings in—I always pronounce it 
wrong. Mount Morenci, Mount Morenci County. 
P: 
I don’t know, you pronounce it better than I do. 
I: 
Really? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
I have to stop every time Mount Morenci in Atlanta for the Commission on Aging. We’ve been working 
with that supervisor there, so I think it’s slow, you know, long road, and it’s slow going, but we’re trying to build 
these networks.  
P: 
I will tell, I’m from down state. I’m not from up here. I’m from a little town called Allegan [laughing]. It’s 
not on the map. 
I: 
It is on the map. 
P: 
It’s half way between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo. 
I: 
Yeah. 
P: 
That’s where I started all my caregiving experience. When I moved up here, it is so far behind. Up here, 
it’s unbelievable. 
I: 
You know, I should have asked this question. I wanted to ask this question [3.21]. Do you think there’s 
a difference between care up here versus other places in the state? 
P: 
I do. 
I: 
In what way? 
P: 
Whether it be medical is coming up quicker up here than the mental health care. It’s so far behind up 
here I couldn’t believe. I could not find—there is one AFC home in Grayling. There were two in the phone book. 
I looked the other one up, I couldn’t get ahold of anybody ‘cause I was looking for a job when we moved up 
here. And the one in town here that I took is a 12-bed house. They hired me. “Yeah. We’ll hire you.” They 
wanted me really bad. Minimum wage working second and third shift. I left down state, I was just ready to get 
my next raise, and I had only been there 6 months. I was gonna make $11 an hour, and I said that’s all you 
can pay? “That’s what we pay.” I didn’t stay at that job very long. I could not believe it. I almost cried. I’m like—
and it’s a 12-bed house, one staff. Yeah. It was hard. 
I: 
So, they’re behind in terms of just the availability of medical care? 
P: 
Availability, the pay. There’s not many up here. The private homecare places charge a lotta money, the 
one particular one that I worked for, for 3 years, and I left to take this job, I know how much they charge their 
clients ‘cause the clients would show me [1.36] their letters, which was none of my business. But I had been in 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Ann Bilyeu. 7.8.18 
 
21
their home long enough. I wasn’t making half of that for one, and I know they have overhead and so on and so 
forth, but it’s expensive. It’s very expensive for the patient not to pay the employee for that patient to get—if I’m 
paying $25 an hour, which now it’s more than that I’ve heard ‘cause I’ve been out of there for 4 years, I want 
somebody that’s not gonna steal my meds, which I had that issue in one of the ones I was going in. I took it to 
the company. That woman is still working for the company. I’m like this is not fair 
I: 
Mmp mmm, not right. 
P: 
And they knew it. She was set up—that’s another issue I have—caregivers, you know. Some of them 
come in on medication, which fine, some people need it, but they should be regulated. They should be tested. 
Something. There needs to be something. There is a lot of medication theft in this line of work, which is a total 
separate issue, but yeah, as far as—there’s not much up here. 
I: 
Well, we could just talk and talk and talk and talk, yeah [laughs]. 
P: 
I said I talked a lot [laughing]. 
I: 
Yeah. No. I’m glad you do. I’m going to let K do his thing. I’m going to go get my phone, ‘cause 
sometimes I like to take pictures of him taking pictures of you.
