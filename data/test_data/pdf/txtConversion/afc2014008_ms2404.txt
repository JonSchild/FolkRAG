Dear $hl
.rley:
 Thurs.Deo.11,1986
 
Hope all is well with you, and your family.
 
I gave your name & address to Susan Egli,
 
home for Thanksgiving from Lubbook..Campus
 
Crusade for Chriat..Texaa Tech.  Hope she's
 
able to oontacy you and can give me some up-
to-date news re you..she'll be back home for
 
Christmas.  Her family so very aotive..our
 
Methodist Churoh..their Chalet real esta e
 
business, construction, etc. Father, Mother
 
and Mother's sister (unmarried, attractive
 
Aunt).  Susan was a baby when we moved here
 
June, 196L$...so were her brother and sister.
 
Bandy met his "bride" (couple yrs now) in
 
Calif. .Carapua Crusade.., moved out there..
 
now in oregon,he told me at Thanksgiving time,
 
It's a FINE FAMILY!
 
Did I ever tell you I have a copy of your
 
Father's "
Cowboy Songs" first published in
 
1910??  This oopy..The Macmillan Co. 1925..
 
was owned by George MoEldowney, Chicago Heights
 
Ill.  They were our neighbors.. 94ac" died
 
after Burgy did.  Betty kept the house for
 
about k yra..she has a big family. .
and getting
 
bigger all the time, with great grand-children.
 
Two daughters and two sons.  They loved to
 
visit hero., hiking •.
 and Mac & Betty had
, a
 
swinimkng pool (that was the best feature re
 
the property to them. .house was nice, but took
 
Betty awhile to sell it.)
 
Betty is my special friend here, tho she did
 
finally sell the house & move close to town
 
into a nice cond
.o...where she's been happier.
 
Wish she could have done that before she
 
married again...aa that second marriage of
 
here  wasn't so good...and she thought she
 
knew him//pleasant, nice looking. .been married
 
for yrs to sister PiPhi who'd been dead about
 
two yrs.  B
1YI.
,heG was a real complainer.. real 
and imagine& t. he finally put him in a nurs-
ing home, went back & forth constantly, etc.
 
til he died

Betty was SO tired clearing the house for
 
moving,  that when she got to the books, she
 
said sh. just did not have strength enough
 
to sort & pack.  Jerry, no help, of course.
 
!'had afit....and said
. I
'd do it, which I
 
did....some for local library... .but some
 
I N EW one of her daughters should have..
 
books on Lincoln. for instance, which had be-
longed to Betty's father.  Was so plea
to
 
find your Father's book...did not know Mac
 
had it,..he loved the Weet..hiking..outdoore,
 
etc.
 Betty said I was welcome to it.  Have
 
with it a note from your Father to Burgy
 
written..Dallae..1
.t's a toaet..remember:
 
"AS LONG AS I HAVE A DROP OF RYE-
I
'LL GIVE YOU HALF
 
J
'
HEN YOU COME BY.
 
IF  OU DON'T LIKE IT.ND ACT RIGHT STUBBORN,
 
I
'LL DIG DOWN DEEP AND GIVE YOU BOURBON."

We moved from Memphis to Dallas the Spring of
 
1936. .would have had "

BUT with
 
all the fun & games for the Centennial, we
 
REALLY had
. it.  Now, it's 50 more yrs .
.did not
 
join the "
fun & games" for this celebration, BUT
 
did at least set foot on Texas soil at the airport
 
en route to LA. .Aunt Kathryn has family there now
 
(she's Mother's younger siater..at 87..going
 
strong!  Don't make them that way any more!) She
 
i
s a dar].ing..right now she's a widow (Burgy never
 
liked for me to discuss her huebands..she'e out
 
.

September 18
 
Dearest Johnny:
 
It'w my last day away from home,  I will be flying out of the
 
big city after noon, and home tonight.
 Got everything packed last night, so
 
this morning I have time to write the long planned letter to you, telling
 
you about our summer.
 
I suppose you heard that Bess
, Chris Gordon and I went abroad
 
early in June, Bess was attending a folktale conference in Helsinki and the
 
group had an opportunity to include two weeks in Russia in a low cost pack-
age deal.
 She invited
, me, I invited Chris and it was a good trip.
 We arrive
 
back on July 6 and Joe and John came up from Washington and joined us;  then
 
Joe remained in New York and the rest of us drove out to Long Island where
 
Alan had leased a house for two months.  Alan's idea was to have a long
 
enough time with John to really find out about him, and how his family could
 
help you and Joe with not only his care, but how to give or build for him at
 
least a modicum of happ ness.
 
It was a shock to see my brother looking so dreadful.
 Twist-
ing hands, face covered with raw places, shambling walk, and clothes kind
 
of thrown on, and Johnny,  that awful lost look in the depths of his eyes.
 
Joe went on with his pla.s to see some friends around New
 
York and then go to the yoga camp in Montreal.
 I had promised Joe last
 
spring that I would stay with John while He had this trip.
 As the days pass-
ed it became e f
id ent that John was no better.
 I talked to him every day
 
and the only real assertation that he continually made was that he "nev r
 
wanted to go back to Houston".
 Then I would ask him what he really wanted t
c
 
do,  telling him that he could -afford to set up wherever it suited him, and
 
he would always say, with a really, begging humility  '
well, I wondered if I
 
might go back to Lubbock with you."
 I was reduced to a tearfully ineffectual
 
mass.
 I could not bear his diffidence and constant apology about living.
 
He was v,ndering around the house time after time at night;. Bess and
. I tried
 
him with and without the sleepingpills that he had, and still he would come
 
into our room in the night, always asking if we were there, and checking to
 
see if we hadleft him alone.
 
You can perhaps faintly imagine the hours of discussion between
 
Bess and me, far into the night.
 Bess finally told me that my late hours
 
of monolugues made absolutely no senses
 So Alan called a social acquaintanc
 
Dr Wayne B rker, a psychia rist that was out for the summer nearby and who
 
a
 
has a wonderful  medical reputation.
 He came to the house, and we started a
 
series of family meetings with him; John was always included,  everyone else
 
who happened to be there was also and things were talked out with John as a
 
participia ±tor;  it was a far cry from the sessions with Dr Mendell with the
 
glaring absence of John.
 
Dr Barker first had to find
, out from Dr Mahoney just how much arteo-
schierosis he had fou
la
id and what the heart condition was for he wanted to
 
try some differenct medication.
 Dr Mahoney gave him the r equested irrrorma-
.
 
tt
hon and stated that "anything would be better for John than to continue as
 
he was when I last saw him".
 Dr Barker then told us that we had three differ-
ent things to contend with;  that John had some normal amount of hardening of
 
the arteries, that he had some frontal brain damage from anoxia, and that he
 
was in deep depression.
 So he started John in on an anti—depressant, another
 
medicine to increase the intake of oxygen by the brain cells, and changed the
 
sleeping pills.
 He expalned that all these were slow acting, and that any
 
improvement, from the medication (if it occurred) would be very slow and he
 
wanted reports on any difference that was noticed.
 So, since Bess had to get
 
back to her job and Alan was coming out only when he was able to get away
 
fri i constant office crisis es (he's making two films) it was necessary for
 
me to stayon, to observe, and care for my brother.
 
The first thing I noticed was that he did not wake in the night, he
 
never came to my room again, and it seemed to me that he was not as disoriente
 
when he came to breakfast.
 And when he started clearing the table, and askin
 
me if he could help in the kitchen, it seems so small, but it was a great
 
difference.
 
And Johnny,  the medidine, or the care or something---it workedi
 
Within a couple of weeks we could really see a change.
 John
 
quit the fumbling with the pieces ­6
'f dirty paper in his wallet; he quit going
 
to sleep in the living room when a conversation or the R V was going on; he
 
quit telling all and sundry that he was "broke"; he e en started making
 
remarks on his w.  ; and the morning that he told a small joke at the breakfast
 
table Bess and I had to leave and have a cry.
 
And he responds so well to Dr Barker.
 That man doesn't beat around
 
the bush, he makes concrete suggestions, and answers all questions directly.
 
One small thing that he suggested seemed to be of great help.
 John is now
 
carrying a supply of money in his wallet and paying for his share of the
 
groceries, gasoline and such.
 At Dr Barker's suggestions John called a bank
 
in Houston and had them send him some money so he could have a checking accoun
 
of his own and pay his expenses by check.
 Of course this is very closely
 
superbised,  but with his great care in spending,  that 's no problem.
 
Dr Barker does not think that John should live with any of us;
 
he thinks that some imporveinent in his mental  condition and his being
 
able to gain some sense of value in himself could not be handled without
 
competant trained person-tel.
 What Dr Barker suggested was someone to be
 
around 24 hours a day to be a constant r
s urance with the memory prob—
 
lems.
 And he was encouraging about the possibi41ty for memory retraining.
 
It seems that it is possible for the paths of memory in the brain to bypa
 
the destroyed cells, and find new ways.
 This was a totally new concept
 
for all af us  ; the doctor called this person a valet—companion who would
 
belong to John entirely; didn't even know that there were such persons.
 
However it was emphasized that John should set up his ii'ing near one  of
 
us who would seem him very often.
 I was told frankly that I was too soft
 
answere df or John instead of making him remember, enti ely too loving
 
and sympathetic for the memory retraining process.
 
S
o we continued to search for an interim person, and one turned
 
up, and we took him for a trial period.  His hame is Riëhard
. Carlson,
 
a rollege graduate, has a varied program of exj
n ence, worked in a psy—
 
chiatric hospital, taught school, directed plays,  taught and acted.
 But
 
mainly for me ,  he is very kind, likes John and John responds to him.
 He
 
has been there for nearly two weeks and we have watched him carefully.
 He
 
ha s seen to all the things that were i
ihpossible for me;  that he bathes;
 
washes his hair in the stuff the dermatologist suggested and used the dry
 
skin cream regularly; cleared up a severe rash in the groin that none of
 
us knew about; and John seems happy with him, looks all spruced up.
 
I think Richard is like a lot of his generation, fumbling aroi r
nd looking
 
for his place, but right now this a good place for him.
 H is also willin
 
to come to !exas with John, while we decided what to do in a more perman—
 
ent way.
 
John still does not want to go back to Houston,  ever, Dr Barker
 
got a lot out of him about how he really feels that we had not known;
 
Houston for him is the place where he failed; where he could not handle hi
 
bu iness; where his life fell apart; and a symbol of complete frustration.
 
He kept on saying he was alone in that house, that he woke not knowing
 
where anyone was.
 Since this all came out in front of Joe I think poor
 
Joe was completely surprised and horrified.
 John is afraid to be alone,
 
and since Joe was living in Moneysunk, he was alone and this Joe did not
 
realize.
 
Its a very hard situation to work out.
 One helpful part
 
of course is that there is money to let him do what he wants to do;  the problem
 
is to find out from John just what that is.
 We talked about getting him a
 
place
. in New Braunfels, with a companion and Joe and I seeing him often;
 
John liked the idea (he loves to swim, and we were in the water often twice
 
a day).
 Alan remembered Bill Cook, now living in Friedericksburg, and called
 
him, and he was willing to work out something so he could supervise.
 He had
 
cared for the lady from whom he rented when they lived in Wimberly; I went
 
to see them there with Johnny Faulk,
 Did you hear that Johnny had moved out
 
of Austin and is living on a far at Madisonville (I think), where he intends
 
to be come se i
lsufficient about food and such.
 Well, Alan called him and he
 
invited one and all to come live with him
 
The plan right now is for John to stay with Richard in a nice
 
house Alan found on Long Island and see Dr Barker a few more times with Richard
 
in his professional capacity to report to Dr Barker the success or failure
 
of some trials of memory regaining; Alan will be there at least half of the
 
time; and then for the two of them to come to me.
 I had turned my home into
 
a duplex several years ago, and have a couple in the front who cared for the
 
dogs when I was away and kept the baggers from clearing out my stuff inside
 
my part
 (I still have Indigo, a spry fifteen, and a Cairn terrier  Susan gave
 
me a year ago.
 But John and Richard could stay for a time at a nice motel
 
very close nearby, and then we would settle for a location,  or find one in
 
Lubbock.
 
Guess I have been long winded, but its been a long summer.
 I
 
feel very tired and in need of solitude for a little.
 The place on Long Island
 
was perfect, we swam daily, sailed, played golf, enjoyed being together;; aud
 
mainly watched our dear one unfold just a little, but get firmly on an upward
 
trend, from the horrible pit of depression, and not feeling wanted.
 Johnny,
 
Dr Barker told us the last time he came before I left 
1that when he first saw
 
your father his 1
?hrought was that he would not live a year unless this was
 
halted.
 And none of us knew how he felt.
 There are lots of things left to be
 
worked out and none if final;  I keep on watching my frt
h nds  here diaappear
 
and marvel that  we four can still be together.
 And the dear older brother
 
is getting to be more like the brother I have been so close to for so long.
 
I'm very tired.
 Alan won't let me say I'm getting old, but the
 
aching bones refute this; and I walked many a mile this summer in and out of
 
the darned kitchen.
 And the discussions, after all I have mostly lived by
 
myaelf for fourteen years, and my quiet and my yard are my therapies; when
 
things get too tight,  I go dig!
 Dr Barker told me personally that when my
 
thoughts got to going back and forth and over and over just to get my—
 
self out of wherever I was, go swimming, take a walk; and it worked for
 
me.
 So I am now on my way back to my small comfotkable home and when I
 
et to worrying  that small Cairn won't let me be mournful, she wants to
 
go for a walk, and she's in chargel
 
Share with me our joy about your father.
 I will continue
 
to let you know; call me when you wish, I'll be home.
 
As y
yo
ou
u can see I did not get through with this in New York and when I
 
reread it I thought I should add a little.
 Its just as nice as I remem-
bered to be here;  the amount of catching up is discouraging; flower beds
 
and garden full of waist high wee s, cabinets full of bugs and spiders.
 
But its still more important that I should have been with John.
 
Each of us has his small things that seem important and inter—
 
esting; but I have had a long and happy life and you and Joe have to have
 
the first consideration; to fulfill your own lives and build your futures.
 
I think I can help out finding a place for John, and checking on his
 
welfare; realizing of course its not a final decision, but a continuing
 
job.
 I am so glad that we are in communication, and that there are all of
 
us so concerned not only with our brother but with you two, and your
 
concerns.
 
The pictures of Nova were so good, and he looks handsome and
 
very sturdy,  I think he looks a lot like your little boy pictures.
 You
 
never did give me his size, nor when his birthday is?

Dearest Shirley:
 
Jutt a note.  Umps got off all right, though he rather frightened me by
 
getting dizzy when we got to the parking l
ot and started to get out of the
 
car.  He sat down for a minute with his head down and then said he felt
 
better, couldn't carry his bag though; we must have looked a sight walking
 
into the airport with me wagging that enormous bag!
 
,
 1
- 
I got him checked in/and we had about a half a
iY hour to wait.  He was very
 
nervous, kept asking me about which was his boarding pass and which was his
 
baggage check, so I finally located the passenger representative, a nice young
 
man named Mr. Johnson and explained the situation to him.  He said right away
 
that he'd help Umps find his seat ahead of the other passengers and that he'd
 
come back to get him on landing and see that he was delivered into Joe's
 
arms, so then I took him over and introduced him to John, who immediately rose
 
up, shook hands, and said, "
I'm John Lomax, glad to know you.  I
'm all right,
 
I just get all confused over these l
ittle things."  So then we waited some more
 
and I told him 25 more times which was his baggage check and Mr. Johnson came
 
back to get his chargex and let him board before any of the other passengers.
 
He gave me a big hug and thanked me, so I guess all i
s well.  I was mighty
 
upset, of course, and when I got home, called Joe, who was getting ready to
 
leave for the air port!  He promised he'd mention the dix dizzy business to
 
Dr. Mahoney and asked a number of concerned questions and promised he'd call
 
some time during the week and let me know how things were.  He is apparently
 
considering taking Umps with him to New England in another month or so while
 
he looks into college possibilities for the fall.  I didn't mention your ±
 
suggestion that you'd come to Houston, thought I
'd let hèmread your letter and
 
think it over.
 I haven't heard from Joe s
ince -
-
 don't know if that's good
 
or bad.
 
Then I copied your letter to Dr. Mahoney, left out most of the part about how
 
he has been handled at home, because we really don't know that for sure, and
 
took it down to the SM post office and got it in the mail.  I hope it reached
 
him before he saw Umps, but the mail is so bad these days and the P0 was c
losed,
 
it being Sat. afternoon and I couldn't get a special delivery stamp.
 
So, that's what happened.  Nxomixaxdxdmhx  Got a sweet letter from Corey, all
 
seems fine there and her ears are better.  Her doctor is sending her to an aller-
gist with the notion that she might have an allergic complication which is making
 
it harder to get over these chronic winter colds.  I hope it's as simple as that.
 
Barbara and I went out to the campus yesterday, and she invited me to stop for
 
supper, so I did, and you'll be pleased to hear it was a highly dietetic meal -
-
broiled hamburgers, broccoli and an enormous bowl of cherry tomatoes -
-
 really
 
delicious.  Anyway, I hope this means she's Taking Steps.  She and Danny both
 
said how sorry they were not to have seen you and Umps before you left and said
 
to send l
ove.  And so do I
, honey; I
've been sort of recovering from my stomach
 
upset for the last few days and trying to finish this double-damned vita, so I
 
haven't had much time to get to the travel agency.  I
'll h keep in touch, though,
 
it was such a joy to see you.  Oh -
-
 the Raggedys (
Ann and Andy) turned out really
 
spectacularly well; they look absolutely professional and I admired them so my
 
self that I took them out to campus with me for the office girls to mirate over
 
before I sent them off.  Paul's secretary immediately whipped out her camera and
 
took a bunch of pictures of them ps posed in various ways, so I
'll send you a
 
formal portrait when I see them.  Thanks a million, honey, for being such a help
 
and so much fun to be with.  Hope you had a good time with Susan,
 
; Lovingly always,
 
P
.S.  On re-reading this, it sounds awfully gloomy about Umps; I think I was
 
reflecting my feelings at the time.  Thinking about it later, it seems to me
 
that if you xx and I are going to spend much time with him, we'll simply
 
have to develop a more professional or detatched or something point of view
 
towards him or we'll roil ourselves up to the point where we're no good to
 
oxrxet-zzsxoxzkimzx f
thnrx him.
 I mean, self-protection is mighty strong in all
 
of us, and I know that if I go on getting a sinking feeling every time I look
 
at him, I
'll eventually start to avoid being with him.  Or I
'll start feeling
 
sorry for myself, which is the least constructive emoti6—nI know.
 Let's talk
 
or write this over with each other after a few weeks when we've had a chance
 
to settle down .

Diet
 
I recommend the following in diets
 
1
.  Do not offer too much food.
 Or too often.
 
2
.  Juice in the morning or mil < instead of coffee
 
which contains caffeine and the latter is not
 
known to benefit the heart.
 Sanka is ok, but
 
JUIce or milk still preferable
 
3.  Do not offer bacon or sausage for breakfast
 
since their fat content is so high
 
4.
 Not an excess of eggs per week.  (Not more than 4.
 
5.
 Meat contains a large amount of uric acid.
 
The liver produces its own supply in addition
 
to wehat is taken in form of meat--animal
 
poultry,  fish.
 Therefore the body cannot
 
rid itself of all uric acid.
 It remains in
 
the body and forms deposits in the joints
 
which inflame them and make existing arthritis
 
even more painful.
 
)
 
6.
 Offer very little aichohi.
 
7
.
 In case these guideliaeS seem to be too
 
restricting, the following foods may be given
 
instead of the ones limited above:
 
fruits of all kinds and fruit juices  (essential)
 
raw or steamed vegetables of all kinds
 
grain cereals, brown rice, oats, barley,
 
wholesme breads of all kinds
 
large salads of all kinds
 
cheese
 
dates,  and all varieties of dried fruits
 
nuts
 
yogurt,  as a snack or at breakfast
 
8
.  Avoid as amuch at possible all products containing
 
white sugar--name brand hreadfast foods,  rich
 
desserts, etcetera.
 The sugar is bad for the
 
teeth and the entire body as well.
 It makes
 
the blood thick,  stiffens the joints.
 If a
 
sweetener is needed,  try to use honey instead.
 
Thanks

Dear Dr. Mahoney:
 
I
'm Shirley Mansell, John Lomax's sister, writing you again about my brother
 
and his condition as I see it.  In my last letter I told you that I was taking
 
John to California for a visit with my daughter and my sister.  I
t has been a
 
happy time for all of us, and I have some observations to report to you.  I
 
understand from my nephew, Joe Lomax, that you are to see John next week.
 
We are hopeful, following the suggestion of my doctor son-in-law who observed
 
John for a week out here, that he can have a complete physical evaluation while
 
he is in Houston.  When I talked with Joe, I suggested that in addition to
 
seeing you about his heart he also see Dr. Hal Snyder, who is an old hand-ball
 
playing friend of John's, also a good general physician and the one who was in
 
charge of the family until the various special emergencies started in.  Joe
 
thought that i
t would be enough for John to see you, but it still seems to me
 
someone should be in overall charge.  This i
s in addition to the dentist and
 
to the eye man.  I
t will not be hard to notice the front tooth, out for months,
 
and I have discovered his s
ight i
s very had, have found that he can enjoy
 
reading if we get him a book set in the large type.
 
I had been told that John has a cataract, and I remember years ago he had a
 
detatched retina operation.  I really suppose he is remarkable after all the
 
things that he has had go wrong.  l
ie seems content with me and with our  ot her  
sister.
 I
t's wearing to remember to tell him all the daily things he must do,
 
but it seems to me I have noticed a change for the better.  I
t's dreadful that
 
the only subject that completely throws him, that he is unable to remember
 
for ten minutes, is that he is very wealthy.  We go over and over i
t, with a
 
letter from his banker in his hand; th en  he ge ts on to worrying if the income
 
tax has been started, and after ten  hours
 of thi s
,  w ith his distress so evident
 
in his eyes, one can only hope for the next day to come and pray he won't re-
member i
t.  And usually he doesn't.
 
There are a few specific things I
'd l
ike to mention:
 
1
.  Dr. Andrew,Mihalik, my son-in-law, changed his pavabid to peritrate,
 
1 mg. t
.i.d.; we were out of the pavabid.
 
2
.  John does not walk well.  His balance seems bad; he claims this i
s
 
because of an old basketball knee.  I wonder if he has had any exercise the past
 
yetr -
-
 l
ie claims he has, but his memory is completely undependable.
 
3
.  I have not given him the melaril at all except for yesterday and
 
today when he began worrying about the trip back to Houston.  I haven't given
 
him the dalmane e
ither; he s
leeps twelve hours a night and would stay in bed
 
longer if I did not call him.  Also l
ie will s
leep four hours an afternoon, and
 
did so the only three times I left him while he was in Lubbock.  I need to know
 
if it i
s all right to let him s
leep this much, s
ince it's possible, if he checks
 
out physically, that my sister and I will be taking him on a trip this spring.
 
4
.  His appetite is enormous, although he does not seem to have any selective
 
function -
-
 great to cook for!
 
5
.  His eyesight i
s very bad, as I told you.
 
6
 6
.  I
le is troubled by extremely dry skin and hair; the bubbock dermatologist
 
gave him some skin and hair ointment, but it still seems unnaturally dry to me.
 
I am returning to my Lubbock home for the next month or so -
-
 2412 16th Street -
-
if you should need to reach me; my phone there i
s 806-PO 5-9609.  Thank you again
 
for your kindness and patience,
 
Sincerely,
 
September 18
 
Dearest Johnny:
 
It's my last day away from home, I will be flying out of the
 
big city after noon, and home tonight.  Got everything packed last night, so
 
this morning I have time to write the long planned letter to you, telling
 
you about our summer.
 
I suppose you heard that Bess , Chris Gordon and I went abroad
 
early in June, Bess was attending a folktale conference in Helsinki and the
 
group had an opportunity to include two weeks in Russia in a low cost pack—
 
age deal.
 She invited me, I invited Chris and it was a good trip.
 We arrive
 
back on July 6 and Joe and John came up from Washington and joined us;  then
 
Joe remained in New York and the rest of us drove out to Long Island where
 
Alan had leased a house for two months.  Alan's idea was to have a long
 
enough time with John to really find out about him, and how his family could
 
help you and Joe with. not only his care, but how to give or build for him at
.
:
 
least a modicum of happ neSS.
 
It was a shock to see my brother looking so dreadful.
 Twist—
 
ing hands, face covered with raw places, shambling walk, and clothes kind
 
of thrown on, and Johnny, that awful lost look in the depths of his eyes.
 
Joe went on with his plans to see some friends around New
 
York and then go to the yoga camp in Montreal.
 I had promised Joe last
 
spring that I would stay with John while He had this trip.
 As the days pass-
ed it became e id ent that John was no better.
 I talked to him every day
 
and the only real assertation that he continually made was that he  'nev r
 
wanted to go back to Houston".
 Then I would ask him what he really wanted t
c
 
do, telling him that he could afford to set up wherever it suited him, and
 
he would a
lways say, with a rea11  begging humility "well, I wondered if I
 
reduced to a tearfully ineffectua:
 
might go back to Lubbock with you."
 I
 
ma ss.
 I could not bear his diffidence and constant apology about livings
 
He was
 1
.
 vandering around the house time after time at night;: Bess and I tried
 
him with and without the sleepingpills that he had, and still he would come
 
into our room in the night, always asking if we were there, and checking to
 
see if we hadleft him alone.
 
You can perhaps faintly imagine the hours of discussion between
 
Bess and me, far into the night.
 Bess finally told me that my late hours
 
of monolugueS made absolutely no senses
 So Alan called a social  acquaintanc
 
Dr Wayne B rker, a psychiatrist that was out for the summer nearby and
, who
 
a
 
was
 
has a wonderful medical reputation.
.  He came to the house, and we started a
 
series of family meetings with him; John was always included,  everyone else
 
who happened to be there was also and things were talked out with John as a
 
part 
icipianttor; it was a far cry from the sessions with Dr Mendell with the
 
glaring absence of John.
 
Dr Barker first had to find out from Dr Mahoney just how much arte
 
schlerosis he had foi t
hd and what the heart condition was for he wanted to
 
try some di±
'ferenct medication.  Dr Mahoney gave him the r e
cjuested in -Porma-
tt
hon and stated that "anything would be better for John than to continue as
 
he was when I last saw him".  Dr Barker then told us that we had three diffe
 
ent things to contend with; that John had some norr
na3  amount of hardening of
 
the arteries,
, that he had some frontal brain damage from anoxia, and that he
 
was in deep depression.
 So he started John in on an anti-depressant, anotbe
 
medicine to increase the intake of oxygen by the brain cells, and changed th
 
sleeping pills.  He expalned that all these were slow acting, and that any
 
improvement, from the medication (if it occurred) would be very slow and he
 
wanted reports on any difference that was noticed.
 So, since Bess had to ge
 
back to her job and Alan was coming out only when he was able to get away
 
f
.v = constant office crisis es (he's making two films) it was necessary for
 
me to stayon, to.observe, and care for my brother.
 
The first thing I noticed was that he did not wake
 
never came to my room again, and it seemed to me that he was
 
when he came to breakfast.  And when he started clearing the
 
in the night ., h
 
not as disorien
 
table, and askij
 
me if he could help in the kitchen, it seems so small, but it was a great
 
difference.
 
And Johnny, the i
nedidine, or the care or something --it worked
 
Within a couple of weeks we could really see a change.
 John
 
quit the fumbling with the pieces '
of dirty paper in his  v
et; he quit goin
 
to sleep in the living room when a conversation or the R V was going on; he
 
quit telling all and sundry that he was "broke"; he e en started making
 
remarks on his 
n; and the morning that he told a small joke at the breakf
 a
 
table Bess and I had to leave and have a cry.
 
And he responds so well to Dr Barker.
 That man doesn't beat aroix
 
the bush, he makes concrete suggestions, and answers a
ll questions directly.
 
One small thing that he suggested seemed to be of great help.
 John is now
 
carrying a supply of money in his wallet and paying for his share of the
 
groceries, gasoline and such.  At Dr Barker's suggestions John called a bank
 
in Houston and had them send him some money so he could have a checking acco
 
of his own and pay his expenses by check.
 Of course this is very closely
 
super ised, but with his great care in spending, that's no problem.
 
Dr Barker does not think that John should live with any of us;
 
he thinks that some imporvement in his mental condition and his being
 
able to gain some sense of value in himself could not be handled without
 
competnnt trained person±el.  What Dr Barker suggested was someone to be
 
around 24 hours a day to be a constant r
s urance with the memory prob-
lems.  And he was encouraging about the possibi4ity for memory retraining.
 
It seems that it is possible for the paths of memory in the brain to bypass
 
the destroyed cells, and find new ways.
 This was a totally new concept
 
for all of us ; the doctor called this person a valet-companion who would
 
belong to John entirely; didn't even know that there were such persons.
 
However it was emphasized that John should set up his 1i2ing near one  of
 
us who would seen him very often.
 I was told frankly that I was too soft
 
answere df
 or John instead of making him remember, enti ely too loving
 
and sympathetic for the memory retraining process.
 
So we continued to search for an interim person, and one turned
 
up, and we took him for a trial period.  His hame is Richard Carlson,
 
a college graduate, has a varied program of ex
n ence, worked in a psy-
chiatric hospital, taught school, directed plays, taught and
. acted.
 But
 
mainly for me ,  he is very kind, likes John and John responds to him.  He
 
has been there for nearly two weeks and we have watched him carefully.  He
 
ha s seen to all the things that were i
mpossible for me; that he bathes;
 
washes his hair in the stuff the dermatologist suggested and used the dry
 
skin cream regularly; cleared up a severe rash in the groin that none of
 
us knew about; and John seems happy with him, looks all spruced up.
 
I think Richard is like a lot of his generation, fumbling around looking
 
for his place, but right now this a good place for him.
 H is also willing
 
to come to Texas with John, while we decided what to do in a more perman-
ent way.
 
John still does not want to go back to Houston, ever, Dr Barker
 
got a lot out of him about how he really feels that we had not known;
 
Houston for him is the place where he failed; where he could not handle his
 
business; where his life fell apart; and a symbol of complete frustration.
 
He kept on saying he was alone in that house, that he woke not knowing
 
where anyone was.
 Since this all came out in front of Joe I think poor
 
Joe was completely surprised and horrified.  John is afraid to be alone,
 
and since Joe was living in Moneysi
. mk, he was alone and this Joe did not
 
realize.
 
Its a very hard situation to work out.  One helpful part
 
of course is that there is money to let him do what he wants to do;  the proble
 
is to find out from John just what that is.
 /
e talked about getting him a
 
place
. in New Braunfels, with a companion and Joe and I seeing him often;
 
John liked the idea (he loves to swim, and we were in the water often twice
 
a day).
 Alan remembered Bill Cook, now living in Friedericksburg, and called
 
him, and he was willing to work out something so he could supervise.  He had
 
cared for the lady from whom he rented when they lived in Wimberly; I went
 
to see them there with Johnny Faulk.  Did you hear that Johnny had moved out
 
of Austin and is living on a far at Madisonville (I think), where he intends
 
to be come se f
lsu±ficient about food and such.
 Well, Alan called him and he
 
invited one and all to come live with him
 
The plan right now is for John to stay with Richard in a nice
 
house Alan found on Long Island and see Dr Barker a few more times with Richar
 
in his professional capacity to report to Dr Barker the success or failure
 
of some trials of memory regaining; Alan will be there at least half of the
 
time; and then for the two of them to come to me.
 I had turned my home into
 
a duplex several years ago, and have a couple in the front who cared for the
 
dogs when I was away and kept the buggers from clearing out my stuff inside
 
my part
 (I still have Indigo, a spry fifteen, and a Cairn terrier Susan gave
 
me a year ago.
 But John and Richard could stay for a time at a nice motel
 
very close nearby, and then we would settle for a location, or find one in
 
Lubbock.
 
Guess I have been long winded, but its been a long summer.
 I
 
feel very tired and in need of solitude for a little.
 The place on Long Islan
 
was perfect, we swam daily, sailed, played golf, enjoyed being together;; @
aid
 
mainly watched our dear one unfold just a little, but get firmly on an upward
 
trend, from the horrible pit of depression, and not feeling wanted.
 Johnr
.r,
 
Dr Barker told us1 the last time he came before I left that when he first saw
 
your father his throught was that he would not live a year unless this was
 
blted.
 And none of us knew how he felt.
 There are lots of things left to be
 
worked out and none if final; I keep on watching my fr
nds  here diaappear
 
and martel that  we four can still be together.
 And the dear older brother
 
is getting to be more like the brother I have been so close to for so long.
 
I'm very tired.  Alan won't let me say I'm getting old, but thE
 
aching bones refute this;: and I walked many a mile this summer in and out of
 
the darned kitchen.  And the discussions, after all I have mostly lived by
 
myaelf for fourteen years, and my quis
t and my yard are my therapies; when
 
things get too tight,  I go digs  Dr Barker told me personally that when my
 
thoughts got to going back and forth and over and over just to get my-
self out of wh erever
 I was, go swimming, take a walk; and it worked for
 
me.
 So I am now on my way back to my small comfo
abie home and when I
 
et to worrying  that small Cairn won't let me be mournful, she wants t
 
go for a walk, and she's in chargeL
 
Share with me our joy about your father.
 I will co nti nue
 
to let you know; call me when you wish, I'll be home.
 
As you can see I did not get through with this in New York and When I
 
reread it I thought I should add a little.
 ItD just as nice as I re me m-
bered to be here;  the amount of catching up is disco u
raging; flower beds
 
and garden full of waist high wee
 
s, cabinets full of bugs and spiders.
 
Bttt its still more important that I should have been with John.
 
Each of us has his small things that seem important and inter-
esting; but I have had a long and happy life and you and Joe have to hay
 
the first consideration; to fulfill your own lives and build your future,
 
I think I can help out finding a place for John, and checking on his
 
welfare; realizing of course its not a final decision, but a continuing
 
job.
 I am so glad that we are in communication, and that there are all
 
us so concerned not only with our b ether but with you two, and you'
 
concerns,
 
The Pictures of Nova were so good, and he looks handsome and
 
very sturdy, I think he looks a lot like your little boy pictures.  You
 
never did give me his Size, nor when his birthday is?

I
'm making this  letter a xerox one because there
 are so many
 
of you I have neglected and there
 is news so good
 I had to tell
 
you that I was pushed into writing.
 
As
 far as
 Tom and
 I are
 concerned,  things go along fairly
 
well.
 I see him going down hill for a  while and then a plateau
 
where things
 go really well.
 Right now we are in one of the bad
 
times and the
 last two or three trips we have made have ended in
 
an angina
 attack.
 We have
 such an understanding
 doctor and we
 
have made
 so many
 rushed trips
 to the
 emergency room
 that he
 
finally gave me
 some things  I could
 try to stop the
 pain so we
 
wouldn't have a week in the hospital  .
 .
 .
 it seems that when the
 
pain is stopped,
 he  just lies up there in
 the hospital and kids
 
with the nurses for
 a week and that seemed ridiculous
 to all of
 
US.
 So now I have Demarol which I can give if the other remedies
 
have
 not
 worked.
 So
 the
 last
 three
 times,  we have made it
 
through at the house.
 It pretty well takes it out of both
 of us
 
but it's
 so much better
 than the other.
 So I don't
 leave him
 
except a weekly bridge game and an interminable round of errands.
 
As  far as I'm concerned,  arthritis in my thumb and knees makes me
 
so mad that I've had, to almost cut out my yard work.
 By the way,
 
we have the strangest weather.
 We never did
 have any real cold,
 
it didn't rain for months,  and then when it did,  it wouldn't stop
 
and the
 poor old farmers have mostly
 had their cotton wiped out
 
again.
 And I  suppose all of you have heard
 about the oil price
 
drop and Tom's income has been cut more than half.
 But since we
 
are both savers,  we will get along fine.
 
But
 the
 big news
 came from
 Alan,
 my brother in
 New York
 
City.  He is being awarded the National Medal of Arts by President
 
Reagan
 on
 July
 14th
 at
 a  luncheon in which the Congress has
 
decreed that the Nation's
 First Official Medal to recognize both
 
artistic excellence and support of the arts is to be awarded.
 In
 
the legislation,  it is stated:
 
"The President
 shall  from
 time to
 time award
 the National
 
Medal of Arts,  on the
 basis of recommendations from the National
 
Council
 on
 the
 Arts,
 to
 individuals
 or
 groups
 who
 in the
 
President's
 judgment
 are
 deserving
 of
 special recognition by
 
reason
 of
 their
 outstanding
 contributions
 to the excellence,
 
growth,
 support,
 and
 availability
 of
 the
 arts in the United
 
States."
 
The people to be honored by the President are:
 
Dominique deMenil
 
Hudora Welty
 
Aaron Copland
 
Marian Anderson
 
Eva LeGalliene
 
Frank Capra
 
Agnes DeMille
 
Seymour Knox
 
William de Kooning
 
Lewis Mumford
 
Exxon Corporation
 
Alan Lomax
 
As
 some
 of
 you
 know,
 my
 sister,  Bess Hawes,  has been in
 
Washington for 10 years in the National Endowment for the Arts in
 
charge of
 all grants
 in the
 folk field
 for the United States.
 
She has funded and set up such varied things as sending linguists
 
to an Indian
 tribe whose language
 has never been
 written,  only
 
spoken,
 to another
 Indian tribe
 who had
 one particular basket
 
that was
 only made by this tribe and
 they asked that the copies
 
and the mistakes
 that were displayed
 be corrected.
 Of
 course,
 
there
 are many things such as elderly musicians,  basket weavers,
 
rug
 makers,
 musicians,
 and
 even
 traveled
 through all of the
 
islands in the Pacific that
 belong to the United States
 to help
 
these people preserve their particular culture.
 
So
 when
 Bess
 reported
 about
 the
 big
 deal  for Alan,  we
 
decided we
 would have
 a family
 reunion to
 celebrate and as my
 
Lisa said,  "We will all be together and nobody died!"  Lisa
 and I
 
are coming from Lubbock;  Pat from Tulsa;  Susan,  Andrew,
 Annicka,
 
and Michael from Boulder Creek,  California;  Ann
 and her 11 month
 
old son
 Onnisis.
 Perhaps John's
 two sons,  Joe
 and Johnny,  may
 
join us.
 
Bess
 has
 a  lovely
 two
 bedroom
 condominium
 in Arlington
 
and thank
 goodness there is a subway station one-half block from
 
her residence.
 She
 is making reservations at a motel across the
 
street inspite
 of the fact
 that Alan mournfully
 complained,  "I
 
thought we could
 all sleep on the floor and
 talk all night like
 
we used
 to."
 This suggestion
 met
 with stony
 silence from all
 
concerned but
 we will have so much
 fun being together.
 We will
 
all arrive on Friday and have Saturday and
 Sunday together,  then
 
Monday at 11:00 a.m.,  Alan and I will go to the White House for a
 
formal  luncheon and that night,  there is a formal reception given
 
by the State Department.
 Can you believe it?
 
Tom's
 doctor flatly refused to let
 him go  .
 .
 .
 I'm sure it
 
is
 a  great
 relief
 to
 Tom
 who regards family gatherings with
 
deepest horror.
 And since he has had such a rotten time
 lately,
 
he is going to
 put him in the
 hospital in the cardiac

the
 four days and really,  much as  I hate it,  I will admit  I will
 
not
 have
 any
 worries.
 Tom
 doesn't
 seem
 concerned about my
 
leaving.
 He is worried about
 our dog,  Sassy,  having to go
 to a
 
horrible kennel where she
 will probably be mistreated constantly
 
and not have our king size bed to sleep in!
 
If  I haven't told you,  Pat,  my oldest daughter,  is working in
 
Tulsa
 and
 loving
 it.
 And
 Lisa
 Gordon,
 her daughter,  is an
 
Occupational
 Therapist at
 Lubbock General
 Hospital.
 Susan and
 
her
 doctor
 husband
 and
 three
 children live in Boulder Creek,
 
California.
 Chris,  the oldest daughter,  can't be with us because
 
she is
 camp director for
 the 4-H camp
 two weeks right
 at that
 
time.
 Susan's husband,
 Andrew,  plans to
 fly to San
 Antonio on
 
the 15th for a short visit with his mother and father while Susan
 
and the
 two younger ones
 rent a car
 and tour that
 part of our
 
country before flying home.
 
Lisa
 and
 I will come
 back on Tuesday
 the 16th.
 I decided
 
that since I  had all the family pictures and
 I was the only one
 
that
 knew the names
 of the older
 people,  I should
 get all the
 
pictures put
 in albums,  so I have
 been driven almost mad trying
 
to sort and
 make some kind of sense

 last night
 I gave up
 
and just started putting them in holes.
 If I don't recognize all
 
these different babies,  somebody
 will!
 I'm now trying to figure
 
out how to
 get this tunnage to Washington
 safely.
 Anybody have
 
any ideas?
 
I
 guess
 that's
 about
 all
 except,
 again,
 please
 
forgive
 me
 for
 neglecting each
 and everyone
 of my dears and
 
nears as you are.
 Let me hear if you have time.
 
Dearest Johnny:
 
It's my last day away from home, I will be flying out
 
of the big city after noon, and home tonight.
 Got everything packed
 
last night p so this morning I have time to write the long planned let-
ter to you,  telling you about our summer.
 
I suppose you heard that Bess,  Chris Gordon and I went
 
abroad early in June p Bess was attending a folk tale conference in
 
Helsinki and the group had an opporutnity to include two weeks in Russia
 
in a low cost package deal.
 She invited me, I invited Chris and it was
 
a good trip.  We arrived back an July 6 and Joe and John came up from
 
Washington and joined us;  then Joe remained in New York and the rest of
 
us drove out to Long Island where Alan had leased a house for the two
 
months.
 Alan's idea was to have a long enough time with John to really
 
find out about him, and how his family could help you and Joe with not
 
only his care p but how to give or build for him at least a modicum of
 
It was a shock to see my brother looking so dreadful.
 
Twisiting hands, face covered with raw places,  shambling walk, and
 
clothes kind of thrown on, and Johnny,  that awful lost look in the
 
depths of his eyes.
 
Joe went on with his plans to see some friends around
 
New York and then go on th the yoga camp in Montreal.
 I had promised
 
him last spring that I "f
l
1
E
 John while 
.
 
As the days passed it became increasingly evident that  his disori e
nta-
tion
 
assertion that he continually made was that he "never wanted to go back
 
to Houston",
 Then I would ask him what he really wanted to do p where-,
 
he wanted to go and he would always say, with a really begging humility
 
"well, I wondered if I might go back to Lubbock with you."
 I was re-
duced to a tearfully a ineffectual mass.
 I could not bear his diffidel
 
and constant apology about living.
 He was wandering around the house a
 
night, Bess and I tried him with the sleeping pills that he had v and
 
without them, and still he would come into our room in the night, alway
 
asking if we were there, and checking to see if we had left him alone*
 
You can perhaps faintly imagine the hours of discussion
 
between Bess and me, far into the nighto
 Bess finally told me that my
 
late hours of monologues made absolutely no sendel
 So Alan called a
 
social acquaintance, Dr Wayne Barker, a psychiatrist that was out for
 
the summer nearby and who has a reputation that is very goodo  He sp.f
l
to the house, and we started a series of family meetings with him.
 
John was always included, and everything was talked out with him as a
 
participant;  it was a far cry from the sessions with Dr Mendell, with
 
John left outo
 
Dr Barker first had to find out from Dr Mahoney just
 
how much arteo-schlerosis he had found p and what the heart condition 
iwi
 
for he wanted to try some different medtcinese
 Dr Mahoney gave him
requested information and stated that "anything would be better for 
 John

and
. changed the sleepings pills.  Dr Barker explained that all these
 
were slow acting, and that any improvement, if it occurred, would be
 
alow. So, since Bess had to be back to prepare to start teaching, and
 
Alan was coming out only when he was able to get away from constant
 
office crisises (he's making two films) it was necessary for me to stay
 
to observe the effect of the medication, and care for John.  Dr Barker
 
said that he did not think that the heart caused damage to the brain
 
from alLoxia, nor the amount of arteo-sclerosis was all he had to contend
 
withk but that John was in very deep dzprxzimx depression, so he had
 
three avenues to contend with.
 
And Johnny, it workedi  Within a couple of weeks we
 
could really see the change.  He did not walk at night a single time,
 
he quit the constant fumbling with the dirty pióces of paper in his
 
wallet; he quit telling all and sundry that he was "broke"; he even
 
started making a few remarks on his own; and the morning that he told
 
a s
nlRll  j
oke at the breakfast table /
//Bess and I had to leave and have
 
a cry.
 
And he responds so well to Dr Barker.  One small thing
 
that the doctor suggested seemed to work so well.  1
10km is now carry-
ing a supply of money in his wallet and paying for his share of the
 
groceries and gasoline and such.  At Dr Barker's suggestion
"
1led
 
the bank in Houston and had them send some money so he could have a
 
checking account of his wunp and pay his expenses by check.  Of course
 
this is all very carefully supervised, but with his careful habits with
 
the expenditure of money, that's not hard.
 
Dr Barker does not think that John should live with any
 
of us; he thinks that some smell improvement in his mental condition
 
and his being able to gain some sense of value in himself could not be
 
handled without competent tr ained personnel, he told me frank ly that
 
I was too soft to make John do for himself the things that he could;
 
it was a process of retraining that I would not capable of doing.  Dr
 
Barker thinks he should be very near some one of the family whQl
 
would check on him very often.
 So we continued to look for an interim
 
person and one turned up.  His name is Richard Garlson, a college grad-
utee and who has worked in a psychiatric hospital, taught school, has
 
a varied exp erenced background.  But mainly he!ie very kind, and likes
 
John, and John responds to him.  He has been there for nearly two weeks
 
and we all watched him carefully.  He has seen to it that John really
 
bathes, washEs his hair with the special stuff the dermatologist pre-
sc abed, cleared up the rash in his groin that none of us had dis-
covered and John seems happy with him.  Richard is kind of liKe a lot
 
of the men of his generation, fumbling around loo.ing for his place,
 
but right now this is a good place for him.  He is also willing to come
 
to Texas with John, while we decide what to do, in a I
nore permanant
 
way for his care.
 
John still does not want to go back to Houston, ever, Dr
 
Barker got a lot out of him that we had not known; Houston for him
,
 
is the place  where he failed; where his life fell apart; and is a
 
symbol of complete frustration.
 Since this all came out in front of
 
Joe I think poor Joe was completely surprised and khrrified.  John is
 
afraid to be alone, and this Joe did not realize at a11
 
As you can see 1 did not get through with this in New York,
 
and when I reread it I thought I should add a paragraph.
 Its just as
 
nice as I remembered;  only the amount of catching up is disheartening.
 
The yard looks like a jungle, and its raning steadily so I can't get my
 
yard man to help me.
 The cabinets are full of bugs and everything in
 
boxes and sacks has to be thrown out.  Just should not have left thines
 
alone for so long, but being with J
'"hn seems more important even now.
 
Each of us has his umn thing one is interested in doing..  And
 
you and Joe are still so young, and its even more important that you be
 
able to fulfill your own lives, and interests.
 I think that I can help
 
with finding a place for John, and check on him often; realizing of course
 
that its not a final decision; goodness knows its most unusual that all four
 
of the Lomax brothers and sisters are still kickingi
 
The pictures of Nova were so good, and he looks so sturdy, I
 
think he looks a good deal like your little boy pictures.
 You never did
 
tell me what size he is, nor when his birthday?
 
Much love,
 
Share with me our joy about your father.
 I will continue to
 
let you know; call me when you wish, I
'll be home.
 
S
 
Its a very hard situation to txNk work out of course.  One
 
helpful part 
o
-ux 
is the fact thati there is sufficient money to
 
let him do what he wants to do; the problem is to fm
. d out from John
 
just what that is.  We talked about getting him a place in New Braunfels,
 
John seemed to like this; then Alan remembered Bill Cook, he is in
 
Friedericksbugg, and we talked with him, and I think something could be
 
worked out there, Bill took care of the lady who lived next door to him
 
in Wimberly when I was there with Johnny Faulk.  Did you know Johnny had
 
moved out of Austin and bought a farm at Madisonville (I think) is farm—
 
ing?  Well,
. Alan talked with him, and of course Johnny invited one and all
 
to come live with him
 
The plan right now is for John to stay with Richard in a nice
 
place Alan found on Long Island and see Dr Barker a few more times with
 
Richard in a professional capacity to report to Dr Barker the success or
 
fa
.ilure of some small trials at memory regainingj and then for the two of
 
them to come to Lubbock.
 I turned my home into a duplex several years
 
ago, and have a couple in the fro t who care for the dogs (I still have
 
Lady Indigo, a serene fifteen) and a lir Ue Cairn Terrier Susan gave me
 
a year ago; and they water my yard and keep the buggers from taking off
 
my things.
 But John and Richard could
, stay for a time at a nice motel
 
quite nearby and then I would go wit  them and see about a location, or
 
find one in Lubbock.
 
'
I 
been
 ,i
 mighty long winded I think, but its
 
b
een a long summer.
 The place was perfect, we swam daily, often twice,
 
sailed, played golf, enjoyed each other; and maiEly watched our dear
 
brother unfold just a little, but firmly on an upward trend, from the
 
horrible pit of depression.  Johnny, Dr Barker said that when he first
 
saw him his thought was that he would not live a year unless this was
 
halted.  And none of us knew really how he felt.  There are lots of
 
major things still to be worked out, but I now feel that they can./).
 
And the dear one is getting to be more like the brother I have been so
 
close to for so many years.
 
I am very tired.  Alan won't let me say I am getting old,
 
but the aching bones refute this; and I walked many a mile this summer
 
in and out of the darned kitchen.  And the discussions , after all I have
 
lived mostly alone for fourteen years, and I like my quiet, and my yard
 
is my therapy; when things get too tight I just go dig.  Dr Barker told
 
me personally that when my mind got to going back and forth an  over and
 
over to just get myself out of wherever I was, and go swiiming; and this
 
seems to work for me.
 So I am on my way back to my small comfortable
 
home and when I get to worrying that Cairn Terrier won't let me be
 
mournful---she's pretty much in charge of the homel
 
Share with me our joy about your father.  I will continue to
 
let you know; call me when you wish, I
'll be home.
 
What Dr Barker suggested was soi eon
.e who would be around
 
24 hours a day to be a constant reassurnace with the memory problems.
 
And he was encouraging about the possibili -j or a memory retraining
 
and reassua ring pro r rn  helping John find new paths in the brain for
 
worhing out new paths of memory.
 This was a totally new concept for
 
all of us, as Dr Barker called it, a valet—companion that belonged to
 
JOhn entirely; didn't even know there were such persons.  Dr Barker
 
told us that there was an accellerated program going on for such train—
 
ing since this type of memory trouble was being found folowing heart
 
surgery.

 All Unnt

ith them beside his pillow.
 And I keep on losing things, and trying to
 
him to be able to do something to help me,  I wish you could have a movie o f 
John wrapping packages, we will have to buy a gross of scotch tape.  And

really puts it away.

 I kiddc's
 
him about talking about leaving when he had just arrived, and he always
 
firmly said he didn't want to leave.
 So when I snowed him the money he
 
had in his wallet, plus the Bankamericard, he then started in on how he
 
would get to the house, plus what if Joe was not there, how would he
 
get in.
 Finally got that decided, and he hasn't mentioned it in several

 Thank heavens for the pecans,  every day there is a long session

Dear Mr.  Lomax,
 
The writing in The Land Where the Blues Began is just
 
beautiful.  The last book I read that came close to what you did
 
was Let Us Now Praise Famous Men by James Agee.
 
Reading your interview with Muddy Waters brought to mind
 
what Walker Evans wrote in the preface of Famous Men about Agee,
 
"he wrote devotedly and incessantly." I can only imagine you
 
transcribing everything as soon as you got back to your motel
 
room or as you leaned alone in the moonlight against your
 
automobile. Am I wrong? Did the people you interviewed let you
 
take notes as they spoke? If not,  how did you remember so much?
 
Your images of Muddy Waters changing a tire--"Several
 
agonies at once--the Arkansas bottoms, miles from everything,
 
mosquitoes and gnats stinging, hot as hell, squatting in a muddy
 
road,  trying to get the car jack to work, and thinking about that
 
special new girl going out with everybody else"--made me realize
 
how important it is to understand the person you are interviewing
 
and how important it is to persevere in getting every detail.  I
 
am so impressed.
 
Years ago,  your name was mentioned in passing by a college
 
history professor who was trying to explain the tradition of oral
 
history by researchers and then in 1991 I read your name again in
 
Nicholas Lehmann's book,  The Promised Land. Lehman described you
 
as a "white man with a bulky tape recorder--Alan Lomax,  the
 
folklorist from the Library of Congress in Washington." Despite
 
all the different labels--folklorist,  researcher,  interviewer--
could you tell me what mattered the most to you?
 
I ask because I think you will answer being a writer--that
 
being a good writer meant everything to you.  Lines like '
SI  spent
 
a lot of time with Big Bill Broonzy when he lived in Chicago in a
 
rented single room lit by a single light bulb hanging at the end
 
of a fly-specked wire.  I watched as he wrote lyrics for his next
 
blues session with a stub pencil on a school tablet" seem to come
 
as easy to you as a summer breeze.  I ask for your patience with
 
all my questions.  Its just that good writing means everything  to
 
me.  It is something that I have wanted to do for a long time as a
 
career.  But I'm not sure if I would want to do it if I didn't
 
also strive to meet your standards.
 
Honestly,  I didn't read your book because I like the Blues.
 
Beyond an occassional concert,  the most music I hear is on the
 
radio as I flip the channels in my car.  I read your book because
 
I was curious about your career.  You took risks in an age when
 
people didn't.  You stepped across lines because something was
 
driving you toward the truth.  Your research was superb.  As a
 
librarian,  I find that fascinating.  As a woman who wants to
 
attend journalism school and be a reporter,  I'd like to use you
 
as a role model and ask your advice--What made you so good at
 
what you did? Where did you get the courage to never stop or care
 
what people thought?
 
I'm planning on applying for admission to a journalism
 
school in Chicago.  Last June I spent a couple of days walkin g a ll
 
over Chicago and taking th e subway to the outskirts of town.  It
 
felt like I had lived there forever.  I thought if you could take
 
risks and try something new,  so could I. Are you still
 
researching and writing? If you have the time to write me back it
 
would be appreciated.  If you ever need a good research assistant
 
give me a call.  Oh,  one more thing,  could I have a copy of the
 
photograph of you from 1941? Even If I had never seen your
 
picture before,  after reading your book,  I would have known that
 
was you anywhere.  I thank you for your book and time.
 
Yours truly,

March 16
 
Day after your check arriv d' I called and found rhe best person
 
in New York to copy the material in my archive that iF mot-t at
 
risk ,
 anC this job ought to be done within the next few weeks.
 
Also I got off my feeling of dispair,  which I sometimes have because
 
I have taken on so many responsibilities,  and got in touch with
 
the places  in Washington,  that may help me put this whole place
 
in order,  on a long-term basis.
 In other words,  :
khiR your generosity
 
and Lomax spontaneity got me focussed on
 roblems I have been
 
neglecting right here in front of my nose. And I'll keep the fire
 
burning and let you know about things as they happen.
 
You do know,  don't you,  that three or four years ago I
 
spent almost nine months making sure that all the best black
 
performances that father and I recorded got put onto master tapes
 
and got ready for publication.  Since then I have been so busy on
 
thi'  film and video project,  that I haven't got those tapes out.
 
I need a black committee to spon or them
 so as
 o make sure that
 
they got to a black audience
 so,  again spurredby your  interest,  I called
 
on
 a black neighbor of mine,  who is an agent and knows the right
 
blacks,  z z
x and interested him in organizing the black Fponnoring
 
committee the project needs  .
 Score 2
.  for Mr .  Duggan.
 
Next week I'll get  in touch with the Library and maka
 
begin to talk with them about the records that are endangered.
 
Tharli,s and much love

Dearest Shirley.
 
This is from the Indian folk festival I recently saw in Wa
 
Washington.  I wished so often that you could
 have been t
 there.  It
 
was  just  like having an adventure with Kim iii.
 
Talked with Anaa this morning  .
 The baby is healthy,
 
free o
defects of any sort,  very lively and happy,  eating away at
 
its mother's milk,  Anna a bit groggy still from the Caesarian and
 
content Bill gentle and totally fatherly Elizabeth looking queenly
 
and proud of her daughter(she has a book out called Wk Wi ening
 
Circles about helping the lost balck kids of the Bronx get t z straight
 
and get job--80% remissions of the worst delinquents I was happy to see
 
her finally happy and sett7ed down says she  is sleeping for the
 
first time  in her whole life  looks entirely different.. .  .
 s0000 in
 
our various wags all the Lomaxes are surviving anw ell. .  . and you,  the best
 
of us all,  the mother of us all,  must take care...  Please,  pleas,  for
 
your brother's sake,  have a bit of therapy.  it's doen marvels for
 
Bessmarvels.  And  for Pat--just look at the change.. And you,  the ncest
 
he sweeest and the most sensible and truly
 asiva  ly the most
 
t
x talented of os somewhat overrated Lomaxes shouldn't be
 
suffering.. .Please for my sake.  Try to find another Doctor Mac.  I' m sure
 
there's one around....
 
Your ever devoted brother.

But 
the
 big news
 came from
 Alan, 
my brother in
 New York
 
City.  He is being awarded the National Medal of Arts by President
 
Reagan
 on
 July
 14th 
at
 a 
luncheon in which the Congress has
 
decreed that the Nation's
 First Official Medal to recognize both
 
artistic excellence and support of the arts is to be awarded. 
In
 
the legislation, it is stated:
 
P
r
e
s
i
d ent's
 
-
 
d eserving
 
speci a l
 
award
 •
•
 
The people to be honored by the President are:
 
Dominique deMenil
 
Eudora Welty
 
Aaron Copland
 
Marian Anderson
 
Eva LeGalliene
 
Frank Capra
 
Agnes DeMille
 
Seymour Knox
 
William de Kooning
 
Lewis Mumford
 
Exxon Corporation
 
Alan Lomax
 
As
 some
 of
 you
 know,
 my
 sister,  Bess Hawes,  has been in
 
Washington for 10 years in the National Endowment for the Arts in
 
charge of
 all grants
 in the
 folk field
 for the United States.
 
She has funded and set up such varied things as sending linguists
 
to an Indian
 tribe whose language
 has never been
 written,  only
 
spoken,
 to another
 Indian tribe
 who had
 one particular basket
 
that was
 only made by this tribe and
 they asked that the copies
 
and the mistakes
 that were displayed
 be corrected.
 Of
 course,
 
there
 are many things such as elderly musicians,  basket weavers,
 
rug
 makers,
 musicians,
 and
 even
 traveled
 through all of the
 
islands in the Pacific that
 belong to the United States
 to help
 
these people preserve their particular culture.
 
So
 when
 Bess
 reported
 about
 the
 big
 deal for Alan,  we
 
decided we
 would have
 a family
 reunion to
 celebrate and as my
 
Lisa said,  "We will all be together and nobody died!"  Lisa
 and I
 
are coming from Lubbock;  Pat from Tulsa;  Susan,  Andrew,
 Annicka,
 
and Michael  from Boulder Creek,  California;  Ann
 and her 11 month
 
old son
 Onnisis.
 Perhaps John's
 two sons,  Joe
 and Johnny,  may
 
join us.
 
Bess
 has
 a  lovely
 two
 bedroom
 condominium
 in Arlington
 
and thank
 goodness there is a subway station one-half block from
 
her residence.
 She
 is making reservations at a motel across the
 
street inspite
 of the fact
 that Alan mournfully
 complained,  "I
 
thought we could
 all sleep on the floor and
 talk all night like
 
we used
 to."
 This suggestion
 met
 with stony
 silence from all
 
concerned but
 we will have so much
 fun being together.
 We will
 
all arrive on Friday and have Saturday and
 Sunday together,  then
 
Monday at 11:00 a.m.,  Alan and I will go to the White House for a
 
formal  luncheon and that night,  there is a formal reception given
 
by the State Department.
 Can you believe it?
 
Tom's
 doctor flatly refused to let
 him go  .
 .
 .
 I'm sure it
 
is
 a  great
 relief
 to
 Tom
 who regards family gatherings with
 
deepest horror.
 And since he has had such a rotten time
 lately,
 
'
he is going to
 put him in the
 hospital in the cardiac
 care for
 
the
 four days and really,  much as  I hate it,  I will admit I will
 
not
 have
 any
 worries.
 Tom
 doesn't
 seem
 concerned about my
 
leaving.
 He is worried about
 our dog,  Sassy,  having to go
 to a
 
horrible kennel where she
 will probably be mistreated constantly
 
and not have our king size bed to sleep in!
 
If I haven't told you,  Pat,  my oldest daughter,  is working in
 
Tulsa
 and
 loving
 it.
 And
 Lisa
 Gordon,
 her daughter,  is an
 
Occupational
 Therapist at
 Lubbock General
 Hospital.
 Susan and
 
her
 doctor
 husband
 and
 three
 children live in Boulder Creek,
 
California.
 Chris,  the oldest daughter,  can't be with us because
 
she is
 camp director for
 the 4-H camp
 two weeks right
 at that
 
time.
 Susan's husband,
 Andrew,  plans to
 fly to San
 Antonio on
 
the 15th for a short visit with his mother and father while Susan
 
and the
 two younger ones
 rent a car
 and tour that
 part of our
 
country before flying home.
 
Lisa
 and
 I will come
 back on Tuesday
 the 16th.
 I decided
 
that since I  had all the family pictures and
 I was the only one
 
that
 knew the names
 of the older
 people,  I should
 get all the
 
pictures put
 in albums,  so I have
 been driven almost mad trying
 
to sort and
 make some kind of sense
 .
 .
 .
 last night
 I gave up
 
and just started putting them in holes.
 If I don't recognize all
 
these different babies,  somebody
 will!
 I'm now trying to figure
 
out how to
 get this tunnage to Washington
 safely.
 Anybody have
 
any ideas?
 
I
 guess
 that's
 about
 all
 except,
 again,
 please
 
forgive
 me
 for
 neglecting each
 and everyone
 of my dears and
 
nears as you are.
 Let me hear if you have time.
 
Tom just never writes,  and most of this is of no interest to
 
you lam sure,  but just to let you know that he is getting along
 
pretty well,---thank goodness he is not going to Washington with
 
me,  he would date the large group,  always says he is opposed to
 
family reunions!
 My family is  just  the opposite,  and altho he
 
likes them mostly,  its  just at a distance!
 He is really quite
 
a darling person,  and we are so lucky to have found each other.
 
I had been a widow t
hor twenty years when he came along,  but
 
its worked out fine,  and I love taking care of him.

 It must be wonderful to be with
 
those kids who are so courageously changing the South forever.
 
hope they feel proud of the cultural heritage of their forbears.
 
I
t was a heritage of protest against oppression, of assertion
 
against hopelessness, of joy in life against death.
 Tell thcii
 
that they can search the world over, all the libraries, all the
 
manuscripts and they will never find a cultural heritage more noble,
 
more vital, more flexible, more sophisticated, more wise, more full
 
of love, more hutnan or more beautiful,
 F

s
 
shaken by hearing its faint echoes in jazz.
 Tell them that i

can walk into their free future with the great arts,  the great
 
laughter, the wit and perceptiveness of life that their oppressed
 
but always proud and life-enobled ancestors possessed
 and a
cid
 
to this their own sophistication, that the culture of the Amertcen

Mrs.  Shirley Mansell Duggan
 
2412 16th Street
 
Lubbock,  TX

Dear Mrs.  Duggan:
 
It was such a pleasure meeting you the other day to discuss the
 
Chris Mansell Medical Student Loan Fund,  one of the first
 
established at the Medical School.
 Through the years,  this fund
 
has been a "lifesaver"  for our medical students.
 It has offered
 
immediate financial assistance to those faced with late financial
 
aid checks or unforeseen emergencies.
 It has alleviated a little
 
stress during a time in their lives when they must cope with much
 
stress.
 You can never fully know the good which has been done as
 
a result of the Mansell Loan Fund.
 
Attached is a breakdown of the activity in the account over the
 
last ten years.
 Beginning with $6180.41 when it was transferred
 
over to the School of Medicine in May,  1973,  these monies have
 
been used and reused by the students,  loaned out almost as
 
quickly as they were repaid.
 Since 1978,  278 students have
 
borrowed $185,800 to avert some personal crisis!
 The balance in
 
the account today is $403.90, which gives you a clear indication
 
of the need.
 
This need is even greater than it was when the loan fund was
 
begun.
 Tuition has gone from $400 per year to $4800 per year and
 
in 1989-90 it will be $5463. 
At the same time,  federal support
 
(awards,  grants & scholarships)  has dropped significantly  (see
 
attached).
 The result,  of course,  is a dramatic increase in
 
student indebtedness.
 Over 75% of our medical students must
 
borrow money to finance their education with the average in-
debtedness of our may graduates being $35,100.
 
TTUHSC is at a disadvantage inasmuch as we have so few
 
scholarship endowments.
 The other medical schools in Texas can
 
offer their students much more financial aid of the kind which
 
does not have to be paid back.
 This fact also enhances
 
recruiting efforts at the well-endowed medical schools.
 
I am enclosing information which I thought you might find
 
interesting.
 It illustrates the tremendous commitment required
 
by young people who wish to pursue careers in medicine.
 I know I
 
personally might think twice about such a career choice.
 And
 
that's why,  of course,  we need to provide as much help as we can
 
to students.
 
"An Equal Opportunity /A f
f
irmative Action I
nstitution"
 
I've probably told you more than you wanted to know,
 
subject dear to my heart.
 We deeply appreciate your
 
the school and the medical students.
 In researching
 
of this loan fund,  I came across clippings outlining
 
Mansell's many accomplishments.
 He must have been a
 
a dedicated physician.
 Surely he would be pleased
 
the loan fund,  set up in his name,  is assisting so
 
follow in his footsteps.
 
but it's a
 
interest in
 
the history
 
Dr.
 
fine man and
 
to know that
 
many who
 
Again I enjoyed meeting you,  and I hope we have an opportunity to
 
get better acquainted.
 I
'll call you soon to arrange a time for
 
you to come to the campus for a "cook's tour."
 Until then...
 
Sincerely,
 
Vonda K.  Somerville

 Students borrowing from 4 or 5 sources (typical) will face a
 
significantly higher payback.
 
3
.
 Educational loans are presently considered consumer loans and
 
thus are not exempt from interest.
 
4
.
 Physicians face declining earning power.
 Choice of
 
specialization could be influenced by potential income.

.
 High cost of a medical education is definitely a factor in
 
in the declining medical applicant pool.

See "The Students' Story"
 
Medical, nursing & allied
 
health students do not
 
currently have a common
 
lounge in which to relax.
 
There is available space,
 
but no funds to build or
 
furnish this much needed
 
facility.
 
Students presently must
 
go off campus to buy even
 
a pencil.
 The
 
inconvenience factor is
 
significant.
 
Exercise is essential to
 
good health, particularly
 
in stressful environ-
ments.
 A small workout
 
area would address this
 
problem.
 
Current loan funds are
 
adequate to meet the
 
short-term emergency
 
needs of the students,
 
but they are an essential
 
component of our
 
financial aid efforts.

Dear Mrs.  Duqqan
 
Thanks very much  for  your kind note  re my article  or
,
 
our  father which appeared  in Texas Hi ghways.
 
I guess you were unaware of  the ori ginal  article  I wrote
 
a couple of years ago for Persi mmon Hill
,  of which  the Texas
 
H
i ghways piece was a shortened and onl y sli ghtl y rewritten
 
versi on.
 (I  had requested Texas Hi ghways  to cite  the
 
ori ginal  publicati on data,  but  they failed to do so).
 I m
 
encl osing a copy of  the earlier story--it's more  detailed
 
and has some evocative  i
llustrati ons.
 
My recollecti on  is that  I sent a copy of  the  old article
 
to Al an c/o Columbi a U  but  I never  learned  if he had
 
received  it.
 No matter.
 I enjoyed researching and writing
 
thi s story--your father's autobi ography  is a great  story and
 
obvi ousl y my major source and  it woul d be nice  if  the  book
 
were redi scovered.
 Another source,  if  I recall  correctl y,
 
was an  interesting article written by your mother back  around
 
1912 dealing with cowboy culture on  the cattle  trail.
 
Again,  thanks for  your note which  is much appreciated.

Dearest Shirley,
 
Enclosed you will find a rather strange magazine that the Arts Endowment
 
puts out for no e
special reason that I
've been able to come up with.
 
I
t's called Arts Review.  This issue, however, contains an article about me
 
that I thought you'd l
ike to see along with a rather strange photo that
 
I think makes me look a little bit weird, but then I have to contend always
 
with the thought that perhaps I am.  Anyway, the article i
s kind of nice,
 
so I thought you'd l
ike to have it.
 
The New Yorker clipping i
s especially for Pat, who will remember some of
 
the people mentionned.
 I was pleased about it even though the program wasn't
 
named (
which it really should have been).  However, it wasn't silly-funny
 
or poking fun even a l
ittle bit as the New Yorker sometimes does.
 
I went to Dr. Ascnuse and complained at him about my terrible disposition
 
and told him I
 
was depressed and not sleeping well and he gave me some pills that have really
 
pepped me up considerably, so keep right on warting your doctor.
 (
I don't
 
know what these things 
, are but will see Dr. A next week and enquire.)  I keep
 
on being ridicudously busy, but hope that things will let up now that I
'm
 
through with the Council meeting that took up all this past weekend.  Next weekend
 
i
s a long one, and I hope to get Many Things Done and Much Accomplished.
 I
'm
 
so tired most of these evenings I just sit in a daze in fromt of the old TV.
 
All seems well with
 
a call next weekend
 
The Olds is perking
 
Virginia hills next
 
Love always, honey,
 
Bess
 
my chillun, and I hope the same for you.
 I
'll give you
 
and see how you are.
 Love to you and Tom always.
 
right along; I intend to take it for a fall romp in the
 
weekend before it antifreezes.
