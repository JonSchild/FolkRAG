Connections to Racing 
Jipp and Rick introduction: Jipp Ortiz son of Ed Ortiz, Rick Ortiz is Ed Ortiz’s 
younger brother. Ed Ortiz one of the primary founder’s of the Ransomville 
Speedway along with the rest of the original Slowpokes 
Discussion of the origins of the Ransomville Speedway around 1955 behind Ed’s 
Garage (then Pedro Motors), Rick’s memory of how it started (was around 10 
years old then) 
Speedway being built on both the Ortiz and Cantara property due to surveying 
error 
Origins of the Ransomville Slowpokes the racing club, that founded the 
Ransomville Speedway 
Jipp growing up at dirt and asphalt tracks – that it was always going along with 
his dad every summer driving around everywhere: instead of trips around to 
Disney or vacations, always were going around racing

skaters) 
 
[4:00]  
Early Memories of Ed Ortiz Racing  
 
 
Putting on thousands of miles driving to different race tracks in old cars 
Story of flat towing the cars, and fixing the cars: race cars then being very fragile 
and high maintenance 
Racing back then being more ‘club racing’ than the professional racing see 
nowadays 
 
[5:30]  
Ransomville Speedway & The Ransomville Slowpokes 
Relationship between the Speedway and the Slowpokes, and Jipp’s recollection 
of how that relationship changed overtime 
Originally raised money by passing hat around, then moved into selling stock 
which raised money for building the new track (current track to this day) on 
Braley Road 
Story Jipp heard of how the Slowpokes gradually ended & when his dad (Ed 
Ortiz) stopped racing at the track midseason in 1962, involving a buyout of stock 
& operations takeover by local businessman Harry Schultz  
Stan Friesen, when purchased the track in the 1970s, gave his dad the track 
championship jacket from 1962 (Stan had been racing at Ransomville at that 
time) 
Gradual dissolving of the Ransomville Slowpokes from 1958 to 1962 – 1962, and 
some of the original crew leaving – Speedway becoming more of a business than 
a club: ‘looking to make $500 dollars a week’ 
 
[12:00]  
Ransomville Speedway Early Changes 
Removal of the modified class (top class) because of the big purse, and Harry 
focusing more on general amount track can raise weekly  
Old, pit entry money paid the purse for the winnings – the grandstand side (hot 
dogs, concessions, etc.) paid for the facility side 
Unlike professional sports, local short track racing – you pay to race (pit entry 
fees) 
Motto of the Slowpokes – ‘Safety not Speed’ 
Origin of the Slowpokes as a way to get the guys to not race on the street: mix of 
people drag racing on the streets and also racing to Niagara falls  
9 original members of the Ransomville Slowpokes who started the club, and 
quickly grew

professional year in year out’ – that they saw other tracks doing on TV, so they 
kept trying to improve everything every year, new track, new concessions, better 
maintenance, etc.
