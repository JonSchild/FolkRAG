BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF JAMES O'NEIL . 
THE subject of our sketch was born in neither this world or 
the world above, consequently he was born very young, with 
no teeth, but terrible large feet; and when first discovered the 
people all exclaimed : What is it I 
He commenced his education 
as a 
doctor, making pills with his face, it being the only ( orig-
inal) mould, and took the first prize at Centennial Grounds in 
the year 1492, when Washington crossed the Lakes of Killarney 
in a 
bull rush, and, having acquired all the rudiments of a 
monkey but his tail, his first situation as a 
human being was 
biting button- holes in coats and pants 22 inches around the 
bottom ; his gums being soft, he lost his teeth, but not his 
cheek, consequently he had to give up the job. 
ills next job 
was at Fulton Market, sewing red flannel in the gills of fish to 
make them look fresh; tired of this, and health failing, he hired 
himself out on a 
Long Branch steamboat as a 
mop for cleaning 
decks. 
His first appearance on any stage was on an ash- barrel, 
in front of a 
deaf and dumb asylum, and he would never take a 
tumble if the head of the barrel had not gave away. 
He next 
turns up in the Great American Tea Company, as a 
model for 
chromos to be given away ; but the trade of the American Tea 
Co. soon began to fail—his face frightened the customers, so 
they all go to Stiner's. 
The dog days came at last, and Bergh 
commanded him to be chained, as several in the neighborhood 
died with human hydroliceppizootic ; he was compelled to be 
sent to Fire Island to prevent his breath from spreading in the 
neighborhood. 
The following winter he bought a 
cluster and 
loaded the pockets with weights to keep it from blowing off 
him. 
He is next seen in a 
slaughter house knocking down cat-
tle with his breath: a 
farmer paying a 
visit to the slaughter 
house, engaged him at sight of his feet for leveling lawns. The 
country air being too bracing, he returned to the city, where 
he got a 
job, to travel with the tatooed Greek, but the same 
luck followed our ( we will have to guess it). 
The people visit-
ing the museum asked the Greek what kind of a 
thing was that 
he had with him. 
The Greek called him a 
descendant of 
swine, which caused a 
row with the subject of our tale. 
Now 
for the end of nonsense ; a 
little nonsense now and then is rel-
ished by the best of men of blue glass or Solomon persuasion. 
Our subject's name is as familiar as household words at all first 
class opera-houses and music halls of Europe and America, and 
is pronounced by press and public as the most original Irish 
comedian and vocalist. 
And I 
remain the public's servant, 
Yours humbly, 
JAMES O'NEIL. 
SUSANNAH MelVCANUS. 
Composed by OOPTY GOOPT. 
Sung by tTAXES O'NEIL. 
I ONCE had a 
fine, platy lump of a 
girl, 
Susannah McManus be mune ; 
She's gone to the divil entirely now, 
And played me a 
dirty, mane game. 
It's over and over I 
tould her me love; 
She pledged me her heart and her hand; 
But now she has fled with a 
villainous scamp 
That played in a 
minstrel band. 
CHORUS. 
0, sorra's the day for Susannah she left; 
Forget her I'll try if I 
can ; 
But the divil got into her head, so it did, 
When she met with that minstrel man. 
Susannah McManus, sure that was her aame, 
And a 
fine dacent girl, be the way, 
Till that nagur minstrel came into the town. 
Bad cess to that very same day! 
Meself and Susannah we went to the show, 
Which caused me a 
dollar to spend, 
And Susannah was struck with the fellow that played 
On the tambourine there on the end. 
0, sorra's the, etc. 
The curtain wint down, and then it wint up, 
And that very same divil came out, 
With a 
grin and a 
kick, and a 
slap of his fist; 
Like a 
monkey he wriggled about. 
He straddled a 
chair with a 
quare-looking thing; 
He called it a 
bingo I 
think; 
He sang and looked at Susannah, he did, 
And gave her an old-fashioned wink. 
0, sorra's the, etc. 
She packed up her duds on the very next day, 
And straightway she wint from her home, 
And she sent me a 
letter and said she was gone 
Wid this minstrel man for to roam. 
I'll gouge him! I'll fight him! I'll kick him 
I'll 
bite him! 
I'll smash him as flat as a 
pan, 
For taking Susannah McManus away. 
That ould nagur minstrel man. 
0, sorra's the, etc. 
PATRIOTS OF IRELAND. 
Sung by JAMES O'N-ExL, the Great Irish Vocalist. 
Now, friends, if you will listen I'll sing to you a 
song 
Of Ireland and her sons we loved so dear; 
There were patriots and heroes, and their names we love 
to hear, 
For the green they were not afraid to wear. 
There was one so young and noble, who for his country 
died, 
To remember him the Irish won't forget; 
Perhaps you've read his speeches in the Irish history; 
This hero's name was Robert Emmett. 
CHORUS. 
Then give thee cheers for Ireland, 
And let the people see 
That our rifles all are ready 
To set old Ireland free. 
There's another I 
will mention, and to Irishmen most 
dear, 
And for Ireland. he proved a 
useful tool, 
I 
mean Dan O'Connel, may his soul now rest in peace. 
For dearly he loved. Ireland and home rule. 
There were three patriots to this world did bid good-bye 
Before they could finish their design, 
They died hand in hand trying to free their native land. 
Three martyrs, Allen, Larkin and O'Brien. 
Then give, etc. 
Now America had her heroes, and she loved them well, 
I'm sure. 
Take the history and you'll know what they have done, 
There was General Lafayette, Frenchman so true, 
And our own immortal General Washington. 
'Tis now one hundred years since the country they did 
free, 
And drove the English tyrant from our shore, 
I 
wish that every Irishman could have the same to say, 
Then Ireland would be free for evermore. 
Then give, etc.

THE FENIANS' ESCAPE. 
An original song of the escape of the Fenians from Australia, as written 
and sung by the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist, JAMES O'NEIL. 
Now, boys, if you will listen, to the story I'll relate, 
I'll tell you of the noble men, who from the foe escaped. 
Though bound with Saxon fetters, in the dark Australian 
jail, 
They struck a 
blow for freedom, and for Yankee land set 
sail. 
On the 17th of April last, the stars and stripes did fly, 
On board the bark Catalpa, waving proudly to the sky. 
She showed the green above the red, as she did calmly 
lay, 
Prepared to take the Fenian boys in safety o'er the sea. 
When Breslin and brave Desmond brought the prisoners 
to the shore, 
They gave one shout for freedom, soon to bless them ever 
more, 
And manned by gallant hearts they pulled towards the 
Yankee flag, 
For well they knew from its proud folds no tyrant could 
them drag. 
They have nearly reached in safety the Catalpa, taut and 
trim, 
When fast approaching them they saw a 
vision dark and 
dim. 
It was the steamer " Gorgette," and on her deck there 
stood 
One hundred hired assassins, to shed each patriot's blood. 
The steamer reached the bounding bark, and fired across 
her bow, 
They in loud voice commanded that the vessel should 
" 
heave to." • 
But noble Captain Anthony, in thunder tones did cry, 
You dare not fire a 
shot at that bright flag on high. 
My ship is sailing peacefully beneath that flag of stars, 
It's manned by °Irish hearts of oak, and manly Yankee 
tars. 
And that dear emblem at the fore, so plain now to be 
seen, 
'Tis the banner I'll protect, old Ireland's flag of green. 
The Britisher he sailed away, from the stars and stripes 
he ran, 
He knew his chance was slim to fight the boys of Uncle 
Sam, 
(1) 
'11:114 FENIAN'S ESCAPE.—Concluded. 
So Hogan, Wilson, Harrington with Darragh off did go, 
With Hasset and bold Cranston, soon to whip the Saxon 
foe. 
Here's luck to that noble captain, who well these men 
did free, 
He dared the English man-of-war to fight him on the sea. 
And here's to that dear emblem, which in triumph shall 
be seen, 
The flag for which those patriots fought, dear Ireland's 
dag of green. 
THE CANDIDATE FOR ALDERMAN. 
An original Irish Comic Song, as written and sung by JAMES O'NEIL, the 
great Irish Comedian and 'Vocalist, with tremendous success, at the 
various theatres of the United States. 
I 
AM a 
true born Irishman, and I'll ne'er deny the same, 
I 
took it notion to cross the ocean, to America I 
came. 
When I 
landed here, it was in the year 1862, 
I 
was willing to fight, both day and night, for the Red, 
White and the Blue. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am your candidate for Alderman, so believe me what I 
say, 
Put on your coats, and cast your votes for me on election 
day. 
When I 
started first in politics, my friends they were but 
few, 
I 
can't forget, every one I 
met, said that I 
was too " brand 
new." 
I 
worked the pipes on the Boulevard, along with Mickey 
Hart, 
He was foreman over the old sixth ward, and the owner of 
a 
big ash-cart. 
I 
am your candidate, etc. 
So now, my friends, I 
must be off, I 
can no longer stay, 
I 
hope you wont forget to vote for me on election day. 
And if I 
am the lucky man, on me you may depend, 
If you want to borrow, I 
wont be sorry, for I 
am the poor 
man's friend. 
I 
am your candidate, etc.

But no, 'twas all in vain, break out 'twas certain sure,

For I 
once went on a

I 
didn't like the treatment, so found it didn't pay; 
So now I

THE HUNGRY MAN FROM HARLEM. 
Sung with immense success by JAMES 0 'N EIL. 
OF 
a 
hungry man I'm going to sing, 
And tears to your eyes it will surely bring, 
He could swallow almost anything, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He'd eat a 
hundred times a 
day 
And for his board he could not pay, 
He could get outside of a 
bale of hay, 
This hungry man from Harlem 
CHORUS. 
The way he'd eat it couldn't be beat 
All kinds of meat both sour and sweet, 
He'd eat everything they had in the place, 
And bite a 
big chunk from his mother-in-law's face. 
He chewed up his father, devoured his mother, 
He swallowed his sister and tackled his brother, 
He swallowed the clock, bit a 
hole in the door, 
Chewed a 
hole in the roof and swallowed the floor, 
He chewed up his shoes and chewed up his hat, 
Made a 
raid on the kitchen and swallowed the cat. 
He chewed umbrellas and eat seven stoves, 
And bit off one-half of the servant girl's nose. 
And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem.

THE HUNGRY. MAN FROM HARLEM.—Con-

He eat so much it made him thin, 
His hair fell out and his cheeks fell in, 
His bones were sticking thro' his skin, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He struck this city one fine day 
And for a 
meal he could not pay, 
He took a 
walk along Broadway, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
The way he'd eat, etc. 
The very first thing he chanced to meet 
'2 was a 
German Band coming down the street, 
He swallowed them all, as fast as they come, 
He chewed up the music and eat the base-drum. 
He tackled a 
crowd coming home from a 
ball, 
They began for to dance and he swallowed them all. 
He went down to the ferry and swallowed a 
boat, 
He went out on election and chewed up his vote. 
At last he came into Brooklyn town, 
He met a 
big preacher, and gobbled him down ; 
He swallowed a 
pump, put his teeth thro' the handle, 
And eat the reports of the Brooklyn scandal. 
Then, galling disgusted with grub so light, 
He swallowed himself clean out of sight, 
And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
The way he'd eat, etc.

RAPID TRANSIT. 
Written and sung by JAMES O'NEIL. the great Irish Comique. 
AIR.— King of the Cannibal Nand," 
THE world is now turned upside down— 
In a 
minute you travel around the town; 
At the slow street cars no more you'll frown. 
For we've got rapid transit! 
Babies will not be born at all, 
They'll be cooked to order like a 
codfish ball, 
Made fat or lean, made short or tall, 
Just made to measure, as you may call. 
You can marry by steam, and, don't you laugh, 
A 
divorce will be granted by telegraph, 
When once the joys of speed you quaff, 
Now we've got rapid transit 
I'll describe the journey of every day: 
When from Bowling Green you start away, 
The strange scenes on the route you'll see, 
Now we've got rapid transit; 
An early morning ride we'll take, 
Before the city is wide awake, 
A 
look in each third story make, 
And a 
peep in every window take; 
You'll see Charles Augustus, that corner swell, 
Blacking his mustache to please his " gal," 
Yet to win a 
meal will her hoop-skirt sell, 
Now we've got rapid transit. 
You'll see Mrs. Jones at number four, 
Letting the parson out at the door, 
Looking around, behind and before, 
As he makes rapid transit ; 
You'll see the honest man who by work does live, 
To his starving child his last crust give,

ATS SIT. — Concluded. 
And each bank cashier, day after day, 
Getting ready for Europe to steal away, 
And a 
member of the Committee of Crime 
Knocking a 
bottle of whiskey out of time ; 
Yet he'll temperance preach with a 
cheek sublime, 
When we get rapid transit. 
You'll see the girls each day you meet, 
Like angels rniuning thro' the street, 
Who in form and figure wont be beat, 
When we get rapid transit ; 
You'll see them lay their false teeth by, 
Their paints and powder round them lie, 
And those charms which pleased your manly eye 
Turn out but pads !—these darlings sly ; 
You'll see swells wash out their only shirt, 
And under the mattress iron it out, 
Before starting to work their day's lunch route, 
When we get rapid transit. 
You'll see these sights at early morn, 
Few going to work, yet many to pawn— 
'T will be fashion soon hard work to scorn, 
Now we've got rapid transit ; 
You'll see miser3 counting out their gold, 
And many a 
wife her husband scold, 
He walking around the room so cold, 
Nursing the baby nine days old; 
While she the warm sheets is tucked in, 
He is trying to stop the infernal din. 
These are some or the sights you will take in, 
Now we've got rapid transit.

MY MARY ANN. 
Sung to great applause by JOUN CONROY. 
Oa, I 
have a 
girl—she looks like a 
queen— 
Her hair it is red, and her age is sixteen; 
She's just like a 
fairy you'd see in your dream, 
And in fact she's the sweetest that ever was seen ; 
She plays the piano, and sings " Aileen Allanna," 
With a 
voice so soprano, so low, and so sweet; 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killarney," 
She frightens the people all off from the street. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you should see Mary, so sly and contrary ; 
She's like a 
canary from sweet Tipperary ; 
She is not a 
bit airy ; she 'tends to her dairy, 
So airy—contrary—is my Mary Ann. 
I 
took Mary one night to a 
massacre ball, 
To a 
place down below they call Wall Halla 
And when she got there, she went straight for the grub; 
The way that she eat was like filling a 
tub. 
She called for the turkey, the quail, and the oysters ; 
She ate onions and garlic, to make her breath sweet; 
But her mouth when it opened her breath was so strong 
That it knocked the people clean off from their seats. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc. 
find her at all of the blow-outs and parties, 
She dances the polka, mazurka and all; 
And when she is at it she goes it so hearty 
That she knocks the plaster all off from the wall. 
We were down at McNally's one night at a 
party, 
And to make things look lively, she whipped off her 
shoes. 
Her feet, when she shook them, threw out such a 
flavor, 
That it drove all the people clean out of the room. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc. 
Written and composed by SAX. BAGNALL.

OLD CURIOSITY SHOP. 
As sung by JAMES 
Now, you've all heard of Barnum's Museum, 
And the sights that were there to be seen, 
For there's none can begin for to equal 
The strange things in that place have been ; 
I 
have all sorts of new startling things, sirs— 
When I 
speak of them I 
cannot stop— 
That I 
gathered all over the world, sirs, 
To put in my curiosity shop. 
CHORUS. 
Then don't talk about Barnum's Museum, 
For if into my place you will drop, 
I've such wonders you'll stare for to see them, 
In my curiosity shop. 
I 
have the soul of a 
miser, 
It's been lost a 
long time, it is true ; 
It's so small you scarcely can see it 
With a 
powerful' microscope, too. 
I've the heart of poor noble Jim Fisk, sir, 
How I 
got it is not worth your while, 
But you don't need a 
spy-glass to look through__ 
It's so big you can see it a 
mile. 
Then don't talk, etc. 
I 
have the fingers of an " honest politician," 
That didn't steal from the New Court House job. 
And the mouth of a 
fourth ward policeman, 
Who on beat wouldn't go for his tod; 
'!I 
OLD CURIOSITY SHOP—Concluded. 
I've the face of the first married man, sir, 
Who was never untrue to his wife, 
And the hand of a 
street car conductor 
Who never knocked down in his life. 
Then don't talk, etc. 
I've the nose of a 
temperance reformer, 
To see it would raise up your ire, 
Since I've had it I've bought no more matches, 
For I 
use it to kindle my fire. 
And I 
have the portrait of Grant, sir, 
True to nature as some day you'll learn ; 
It shows how he'd look the day after, 
If he had run for that other term. 
Then don't talk, etc. 
I 
have the conscience of Beecher, 
The most wonderful thing to be found, 
I 
stole it one night when the preacher 
Was asleep on that little red lounge; 
But the Government, they want to buy it, 
It's true, just as sure as I 
live ; 
They will stretch it from New York to Brooklyn 
To support the big East River bridge.

Then don't ialk, etc'. 
THE PULLING MACHINE. 
Written by PETE CANNON, and sung by JACK CONROY. 
To bother you long is not my intention, 
I'll bid you good-night and be leaving you soon ; 
But first let me tell you about an invention 
I 
recently saw in a 
liquor saloon. 
I 
have met with some things that puzzled me greatly, 
And twenty-four years in this country I've been, 
But, believe me, I 
never was caught so completely 
As they caught me one night with a 
pulling machine. 
CHORUS. 
The villain that first studied out the invention, 
Whoever he is, must be terrible mear,. 
I'd give fifty dollars for his apprehension, 
And I'd put him to death on his pulling machine. 
" 
See how much you can pull," says a 
man who steed 
near me. 
"Ill bet you the drinks I 
can pull more than you." 
Then the crowd all around him began for to cheer me, 
So I 
just took hold, to see what I 
could do. 
The bar-tender sent electricity through me. 
Such dancing and leaping there never was seen. 
My hair stood on end, and I 
swore I 
would murder 
The man who invented the pulling machine. 
The villain that, etc. 
The shock that it gave ma it near drove me crazy, 
It went through my system like needles and pins; 
They say that my dancing was graceful and easy, 
But some of them*got a 
good kick in the shins. 
When the torture was over they called me a 
gilly, 
And they told me that I 
must be terrible green; 
That I 
ought to know better than be such a 
sucker 
For to dance all my steps on a 
pulling machine. 
SPOKEN. —Says one fellow, " It's only a 
patent for eiren-
lating the blood well." 
Says I, " I 
want all the blood I 
have now." Says he, " Did you never read where Dr. 
Franklin caught the lightning in a bottle ?" " I 
did," 
says I; " but if I 
had the fellow that made that machine 
he'd catch blazes quicker than lightning. 
In fact," says 
I, " I 
think it's a 
shocking machine, and—:.

Sung by BILLY Asucaorr. 
Ix Dublin, that city of riches and fame, 
A

The neighbors all grieved, rich and poor, high and low, 
And to the wake of poor Jerry resolved for to go. 
SPOKIIN.—Poor Jerry! Though he often half-soled shoes, he 
was a 
whole-souled man himself, and many's the job he done for 
nothing, 
lie mended Tim Reilly's brogans, and pegged Mrs. 
M'Carthy, and gave her a new patch on her upper, an' all for 
sixpence; so no wondher they all came to his wake. 
Tim 
Donohoe wint for a 
coach for the ladies; he stuffed the fine soft 
straw feather bed in the bottom of Con Casey's wheelbarrow; 
he smoothed down the lone- feathers for fear any of them might 
stick in the ladies, and hurt their—feelings, as he handed theta 
in. 
CHORUS.

And another big party about twenty score, 
All met them a 
knocking at Jerry Flynn's door. 
SPOKEN —" Mrs. Flynn! Mrs. Flynn! why the blazes don't 
you open the door 7 
Here's the quality coming to Jerry's wake. 
Stick him up slantindickler in the bed ; clap a 
cane pipe in his 
mouth and put a 
nightcap on him, that he may look nate and 
dacint. 
Mistress Biddy, will you shake some cane straw in the 
corner for the company to sit down on 
There yees are all now 
as snug as a 
bug in a

Come. now, Darby Reilly, while 
Nelly's mixing the punch, will you just tip us a 
bit of a

Faix I

sod of turf in your gob if you don't hould your tongue. Darby 
Reilly is going to sing ; silence." 
(Sings in a 
drawling tone.)

York.

Copyright, 1876, by E. II. IIAnnum 
THE regiment is forming now, 
The ranks are nearly filled; 
For valor and for victory 
Our hearts are always drilled ; 
All Irishmen unite with us, 
And give their heart's consent 
To live or die like soldiers 
In the Irish Regiment. 
In dashing uniforms we go, 
So straight in every line— 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And say we look so fine. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the Irish Regiment that waits the bugle's call 
Gallant soldiers all, who for their flag would fall ; 
Of raging war or cannon's roar we have no fear at all; 
We'll march away to glory in the Irish Regiment. 
We'll show our Yankee nation 
What the Irishmen can do 
In the armory or battle-field 
To duty we are true ; 
When marching on the gay parade 
We are the nation's pride, 
While the stars and stripes and Erin's flag 
Are flying side by side 
In dashing uniforms we go, 
So straight in every line ; 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And say we look so fine. 
Hurrah for the Irish Regiment, etc. 
The cause we serve is liberty, 
And we're a 
valiant band— 
Some day we'll see the tyrants fall, • 
And freedom in our land ; 
But far away we now must stay, 
And be with hope content, 
While marehine• on to victory 
In the Irish Regiment. 
In dashino- uniforms we go, 
So straight in every line ; 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And say we look so fine. 
hurrah for the Irish Regiment, etc. 
THE FITT,TNY LITTLE TAILOR. 
Composed and. sung by PAT KELLY. 
M
ERE was a 
jolly tailor once that I 
knew well, 
He kept a 
little tailor shop and had pantaloons to sell, 
Neck-ties, broadcloth, and everything like that, 
And anyone coted tell he wore a 
very funny hat ; 
It wasn't very low nor it wasn't very high, 
It had a 
peculiar look that would quickly take the eye. 
He wore it on Sunday and every day in the week, 
And it always looked glossy, for he kept it very neat. 
Ile was tht pride of the ladies and the envy of the boys ; 
Wherever he would go he would never make a-noise ; 
He was as light on his feet as a 
canary on a 
tree; 
He was bashful, he was neat, and as happy as could be ; 
Whenever there was a 
party he was sure to be there, 
With his tight pantaloons and glossy curly hair; 
He could talk, dance, sing, and wink, and everything like that 
But no matter where he would go he wore his fanny little hat. 
He went to a 
party one night where there was lots of fun, 
He got rather tired and sleepy from drinking rum and gum ! 
They put him in the corner to have a 
little doze, 
When the boys found it out they put a 
cork on his nose, 
And they all yelled " Fire !" with a 
terrible shout; 
But he quickly jumped up and quietly put it out; 
He took his little hat and walked to the door, 
A.nd he bade them all good-bye, and they never saw him more.

DU 
FFY, YOU'RE GIVING US TAFFY. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, and sung by J. CONROY. 
I'm a 
naturalized citizen of this great land, 
And I'm proud of the honor, I'm sure; 
In politics I'm quite a 
prominent man, 
And respected by rich and by poor. 
Now, I 
try to be civil to every one, 
But they've not the same manners toward me, 
For it's up and down as I'm strolling along 
These words they will say unto me : 
CHORUS. 
" 
How are you, Macduff ? 
Don't you think you look 
tough ?" 
Expressions like these make me wrathy, 
And whenever I 
say, " Lave off with your play," 
They say, " Duffy, you're giving us taffy." 
They'll tell me to go put my feet in a 
frame, 
And go chase myself round the square; 
And they say that if Barnum knew I 
was alive 
He'd have me caged up with the bear. 
Now, I 
know I'm not handsome, but this much 're sure— 
To do right I 
always did try, 
And the next man that tells me to sit down on myself 
I'll put a 
lump over his eye. 
How are you. Qtc. 
They say my feet occupy the whole street, 
With my bunions the people can't pass, 
And say that my face would stop the street ears, 
And my ears just look like a 
jackass; 
But let them all talk until they are sick ; 
They're jealous because they're not me. 
I'm a 
sound Irishman, and that they'll find out, 
And 
they'll never find taffy in me. 
How are you, etc.

You've no doubt heard the song. 
Of " Father dear, come home." 
And the fate of hungry little Ben, 
Who sent for him to come ; 
How the old man used to 
smile," 
And cause the family pain, 
But he let up for a 
little Male, 
And then got drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
We've given him up for gone. 
He's lying in the lane, 
And almost every body knows, 
The old man's drunk again. 
He takes his morning nip, 
And loafs about the door; 
He told his family more than once, 
That he would drink no more; 
But then lie would forget 
From " benzine" to abstain, 
The police, they would come and say. 
"The old man's drunk again." 
We've given him up for gone, &e. 
He'd smash poor mother's nose, 
And upset brother Ned, 
Aud drive us all into tie street, 
Then tumble in o 
bed ; 
And \Olen he'd be asleep. 
We'd go back and remain, 
Until he woke and left the house, 
To come home drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, Ztc. 
" 
0 ! Father, dear, come home," 
Stop drinking like a 
sow ; 
You've drank away the beds and stove, 
Don't swallow up the cow ; 
0! don't abuse the boys, 
And cause poor mother pain, 
Or we'll rebel and " go for you," 
When you get drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, 4fw. 
FACES IN THE FIRE. 
By GEORGE H
ET. 
I'VE oft in boyhood crept up to the fire 
And watched the faces fashioned by the blaze, 
Which soon as formed as quickly would retir 
As do the fancies of our younger days. 
And even now, when in mature old age, 
I 
watch the faces as they come and go. 
They form a 
story written on life's page— 
A 
story full of weal and full of woe. 
I 
there have seen my own face as a 
boy, 
All wreathed in smiles, unknown to grief or care, 
Beyond the breaking of some favorite toy— 
A 
face on which its thoughts were all laid bare. 
Look at it now, as left by Time's hard hand— 
For care and sorrow both have made their mark— 
My brow's as withered as yon burning brand ; 
My smile e'en pales beside the flickering spark. 
And sometimes faces we have learnt to loathe 
Our fancy shapes beneath our very eyes, 
And dearest friends beside the bitterest foes 
From out the embers steadily arise. 
Oh, if we knew but where to draw the line 
'Twixt loving hearts and hearts as black as night, 
About our lives then fondly would entwine 
Some flowering shrub instead of parasite. 
And oft methought the fire would blaze anew, 
And then a 
group of little faces came, 
Whose beaming eyes have thrilled we thro' and thro', 
Whose smiles outvied the brightness of the flame. 
What man can look on such a 
happy scene 
And feel no pride or joy within him rife 
Such little faces gathered there are e'en 
The stepping- stones in every father's life. 
And then a 
brighter face than all the rest 
Would lovingly look up from out the blaze, 
And make me think that all my life was blest., 
In having one so good to cheer my days. 
For, though from clime to clime a 
man may roam, 
He finds how dreary soon becomes his life, 
Without a 
purpose and without a 
home, 
Without a 
faithful, true, and loving wife. 
And so I 
often wheel my easy chair 
Toward the bright and ever cheerful blaze, 
And hour by hour I 
sit before it there, 
And think upon my boyhood's joysome days. 
So will my children do when I 
am gone, 
For this same fancy they will soon acquire, 
And often sit until the nurrnino's dawn, 
To gaze upon the Faces in the Fire. 
DUFFY'S OPENING NIGHT. 
Originally sung by JACK CONROY. 
DID you ever hear tell of Pat Duffy ? 
He came from the County Mayo. 
Last week, shure, he started a 
bar-room 
Down in the Fourth Ward below. 
There was lager, free lunch, and whiskey. 
Faith, indeed, 'twas an elegant sight; 
But the boys, one and all, they got frisky 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
CII0P.1."S. 
Ah, but Duffy sold horrible liquor; 
It would knock you up high as a 
kite, 
And the bar I'm sure never looked sicker 
Than on Duffy's grand opening night. 
Poor Duffy sent out invitations, 
And invited his neighbors to come. 
He told them he'd treat them all dacent, 
And give them their fill of good rum. 
They came there in droves and by dozens, 
And got into a 
terrible fight. 
They broke all the doors and the windows 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
Ah, but Duffy, ete, 
They stole all the stock that he had there, 
And drank all his whiskey so sweet ; 
They took both his clothes and his money, 
And threw him out into the street. 
They scattered his family, and left him 
To roam in a 
terrible plight. 
Poor Duffy now lives on free lunches 
Since he gave the grand opening night. 
Ali, but Duffy, etc. 
THE GIRL FROM KILDARE., 
Aia.—" Bold Jack Donohoe." 
I 
AM a 
decent Irish girl, 
As you can plainly see; 
Sure I 
have come from Ireland, 
And I 
crossed the briny sea; 
My husband he deserted me, 
And left me here in despair; 
But I 
am a 
decent Irish girl 
From the County of Kildare. 
When I 
did land in New York, 
It was on a 
Sunday morn ; 
The weather it was very cold, 
I 
went to get a 
horn, 
I 
went into a 
tavern, 
And, boys, what do you think 1 
That in New York on Sunday morn 
I 
couldn't get a 
drink. 
SHAKE THE DICE.: 
IT 
is eight years to- day that I 
came across the sea, 
And left Limerick town behind me ; 
Sure, the boys all kinds of tricks on me do play; 
Now I 
never get mad, now mind ye; 
They do call this a 
dice, and a 
queer six too, 
But time isn't like it used to be, 
But it is mighty aggravating upon Saint Patrick's Day 
For to have the blackguards bawlin' after me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, not for the world 
Would I 
part with this eleaant bat, 
And the boys still cry with the top of their voice, 
" 
Are you ever going to shake that dice 1 " 
This hat was made in the County of Galway, 
And I'm not ashamed for to wear it; 
But as down the street I 
go stones at me the blackguards throw, 
And all does call me a 
Paddy; 
It's proud I 
am of that, you can see that ; 
If the blackguards would only let me be; 
But it's mighty aggravating unon Saint Patrick's Day 
For to have them bawlin' after me. 
Oh, not for the world, etc. 
THE IRISH FAIR. 
Written by W. 
WfILTEllEAD, and originally sung by J. IL CONROY. 
As I 
rose up one morning, 
The same day as the Fair, 
All the pretty boys and girls, 
They assembled there. 
There was humped- back McCarty, 
And cork-legged Teddy Lee, 
They were among the party, 
Who rode along with me. 
CHORUS-
While on the road to the Fair, 
Tascha shin ga miska, 
Arrah, what fun was there, 
Fa1ga Balga Lorrah. 
Now we're off to Donnybrook, 
For to see the Fair; 
Won't we have a 
jolly time, 
With the boys and girls there ! 
We'll dance and sing-, 
and -whiskey drink, 
Till our hearts are tree irom care - 
There's no suen Inn, where'er you go. 
As you'll find at an Irish Fair. 
We all went into a 
tavern, 
And there began to sing, 
And Judy O'Brien and Mickey Flinn, 
They done a 
double fling. 
And then they got a-fighting, 
You couldn't hold them back, 
Teddy off with his cork-leg, 
McCarty's head he cracked. 
While on the, eto. 
On the road while driving, 
The crowd sung songs so sweet, 
And big fat Lizzie McCarty, 
Shure she broke down the seat. 
They all fell out of the wagon, 
The horse he gave a 
jump ; 
I 
split my sides a-laughing, 
At McCarty on his hump. 
While on the, etc.

WHOA, McGINNIS. 
AIR.— " 
Whoa, Emma " 
Written and sung by PAT. McGt.oNE, also by the great JAMES O'NEIL. 
MY 
name is Owen McCiinni ,,, 
In New York I 
reside, 
And as I 
pass the corner " tuffs," 
They say that I 
am " snide." 
They bawl out on the walk, 
" 
Oh, aint he a 
guy," 
And all such talk 
They use to me as I 
do pass them by. 
CHORES . 
Whoa, McGinnis ! 
Whoa, McGinnis ! 
McGinnis, I 
think that your name it is Dinnis, 
Whoa, McGinnis ! 
ha, ha, McGinnis ! 
That's what the gang there do bawl after me. 
On last St. Patrick's day 
I 
marched away so gay, 
With the ancient order 
Of which I 
do belong. 
While parading through the streets, 
I 
met a 
gang of " beats," 
One of them struck me 
And bolted through the throng. 
SPOKEN. —I 
followed that fellow for as good as seven-
teen blocks, when he slipped me. 
Then I 
went into a 
lager bier saloon for to get a 
glass of lager to cool myself 
off. 
I 
asked the bartender for a 
bier ; he gave it to me. 
I 
forgot myself , and was walking out when the bartender 
called me back, and asked me if he gave me my right 
change. 
I 
says, " I 
beg your pardon, but what did I 
give you ?" 
Says he, " What are you trying to give 
me ? " I went through myself, and said, " D—n the 
cent I 
have to give you." 
Then be said to an " ace" who 
was hanging around the store, " Riley, put up the shut-
ters, the Chinee's dead." I 
says, " What do you mean, 
would you murder a 
man for the price of a 
drink ? " 
He 
says, " No, the sawdust has to be raked for the morning ; 
we might as well rake it with you." " Never mind," 
says another fellow, " let us give him the rammer." 
Four of them got a 
hold of me and began to bang the 
pistol pocket side of my pants against the wall. 
Surmise 
the second rap I 
got ; 
it 
knocked me unconscious. 
When I 
came to, I 
found myself laying out in the gutter. 
I 
picked myself up, and was about to start off when the 
crowd commenced calling out 
Whoa, McGinnis, etc.

Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma, 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
That's what I

I 
ask'd them what they meant ? 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye. 
Emma began to scream! 
" 
Oh, Fred, what does this mean ?" 
I 
ask'cl again, and this was their reply— 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police !" 
And when he came he look'd at me so sly. 
The crowd then at me laugli'd, 
And said I 
must be " daft ;" 
And once again they all commenc'd to cry— 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
An old man said to me, 
" 
Why, young man, can't you see 
The joke ?" and I 
look'd at him with surprise 
He said, " don't be put out, 
It's a

And then their voices seem'd to rend the skies,

HARDING. 
On ! one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug hat and all, 
And I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernian Hall. 
Going round a 
corner a 
gang of rowdies— 
Oh ! I 
know they're rowdies, for they never work— 
Says, let us give this old Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
picnic, boys, and toss the Turk. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter„ nor yet a 
biter, 
But when duty calls I 
never shirk ; 
So I 
tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no picnic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh ! the big ringleader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien, you had better paint the 
tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it !" 
And he thought 'twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk ; 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no picnic when they tos.s'd the Turk. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, etc. 
Oh I 
they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall ; 
" 
You can't go behind me," says I, " now mind me, 
If ye stand forninst me I 
can bate ye all." 
Then the gang did face me, and thought to lace me, 
But I 
show'd them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Bight and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for reeve)* they began to bawl. 
SpoKEN.—Well, they looked surprised, and Redheaded 
Mike says, " Who are you ?" " Well," says I, " my name 
is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, and more-
over—" 
I'm not a 
fighter, etc. 
CHARLEY FLYNN. 
Sung by JACK CONROY. 
I'LL ask consideration, friends, 
And I 
will let you know 
That I 
am saluted by the gang 
Wherever I 
may go. 
I 
live in eighteen " carrot " style, 
I 
drive a 
trotting mare; 
I 
smoke Elora de five per cent. cigars, 
And singe my curly hair. 
CHORUS. 
Charley Flynn, Charley Flynn, 
Wears the latest style of collars, 
Charley Flynn, Charley Flynn, 
Worth one hundred thousand dollars. 
When I 
go out to walk, 
My shirt as white as chalk, 
The gang say clear the way, 
For here comes Charley Flynn. 
I'm known in all the social clubs, 
I 
live on oyster stews; 
I 
can pivot on a 
three-cent piece, 
And dance the Lauciers too. 
And oftentimes I 
make a 
speech, 
Of course on politics, 
And when I 
say a 
little too much, 
I 
get a 
shower of bricks.

Behold in me a 
pedagogue, 
Who keeps a 
little school ; 
To teach children to read and write, 
Is my never failing rule. 
From morn till night you can hear their tongues, 
In chorus go click, clack ; 
And don't they have a 
jolly game 
Whene'er I 
turn my back. 
And all day you can hear them say 
CHORUS. 
I 
never fail to use the rod, 
Tho' always draw it mild ; 
But you know that it' you spare the rod, 
You're sure to spoil the child. 
My scholars range from fifteen down 
To those who scarce can speak; 
And for their education, I 
Just charge one bob per week. 
And all day you can hear them say 
The parents of my scholars 
Are not wealthy—that you'll know ; 
When I 
tell you that their bob a 
week 
For months they often owe.

In certain subjects suitable 
To all and every class.

As sung by Nr.o H ARRIGAN. 
0 
I 
list to the lay of a 
po ,)r Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his old withered hands, 
But, remember those fingers, they once could move sharper, 
In raising the merry strains to his dear native land, 
it was long before the shamrock, dear isle, lovely emblem, 
Was crushed in its beauty, by the Saxon's lion paw, 
And all the pretty colleens around me would gather 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Though four score and three years have flew by them, 
It's king's sweet reflection that every young joy, 
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of old men 
At a 
fair, or a 
wake I 
could twist my shillelah, 
And trip through a 
dance wid my brogues tied with straw . 
There all the pretty maidens around me would gather, 
Call me their bold Pilelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
In truth I 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home and a 
dweliing for me, 
And oh, let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be cut from the land that is trod by the free ; 
And when serjeant death in his cold arms doth embrace. 
And lull me to sleep with old Erin-go-bragh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my dear pride, oh place iise. 
Then forget PheRua Bra : y, the Bard of Armagh.

BLACKWELL'S ISLAND. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
ADL—" Ten Thousand Miles away." 
Sing I 
of a 
gallant Isle, my boys, not many miles away, 
Whef e 
there's lots of time for digging stone, and little time for play ; 
Where we get no lush, but lots of mush, and they w'ollop you if you 
smile: 
It's opposite to Jones' Wood, and they call it Blackwell's Isle. 
CHORUS. 
Judge Dowling told me so, to Blackwell's Isle I'll go, 
Just at Bellevue, I'll say adieu, to my true love so gay ; 
For the steamboat now does wait, 
To carry me in state, 
And I'll stay for a 
while on Blackwell's Isle, 
7.\_Tot many miles away. 
While buzzing in a 
Broadway stage, I 
met a 
country bloke, 
I 
faked his cly, so like and sly, went through him for a 
joke, 
But a 
cop did drop, he caught me pop, he stagged my game in style, 
And they didn't send me to Ludlow street, but up to Blackwell's Isle, 
For the Judge, & c. 
When 
at that summer resort, wh:ch aint much like Long Branch 
How many a 
day I'll feel quite gay, could I 
vamoose ti e 
ranche ; 
When I 
think of my girl at Jones' Wood, with another cull waltzing 
gay. 
Then ; eel so melancholy when the band begins to play. 
'or the Judge, dm 
When Jim Fisk's boats so gaily floats, close to the Hellgate shore, 
And I 
think of the state room I 
have cracked, and like to do once 
more; 
Of the wallets full I 
used to pull, with my moll to work the pay, 
While all ttlo:e I'm breaking stone, from my pals so far away. 
For the Judge, & c. 
II I 
had my way on some fine day, I'd set the Tombs on fire, 
Such a 
flame id raise, and in the blaze I'd burn the Black Maria. 
The peelers, too, I'd catch the crew, and roast them on the pile ; 
And each judt:e what lives, six moons I'd give way up at Blackwell's 
Isle. 
Spoken— Hey, Shorty Gilli‘ er, wouldn't that be bully I We'd hay.

JOHN MONAHAN'S DONKEY. 
Sung by JAMES 1311SDLEY, at the Eagle Theatre, with great success_ 
I've got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy ; 
Ile drinks seltzer water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
run on the turf sure he never proved shy ; 
He makes good time, one mile a 
day, 
I'll match him against any stallion or bay ; 
He fought for his country, been all through the war, 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope and tar. 
CHORUS. 
I 
got a 
donkey, 
He's not very chunkey, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey 
To 
any old flunkey ; 
Wouldn't that be hunkey 
If he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, 
And donkey also 7 
When he's locked in his stable he makes a 
stiff kick, 
He wants to get out, be pretends he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey, his name it is Dick, 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick ; 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up, leave none for next day; 
Last week he broke loose and of course went astray, 
lie was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I 
got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
ro le on his back so cheerful and gay ; 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We got to the hall without any delay ; 
Just as I 
was turning into the park 
S,une one fired a 
pistol, just for a 
lark ; 
The donkey fell down which caused a 
blockade. 
Only tor fifty horse doctors led spol the parade.

TEA LA LA, 
GEORGE. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. SKELys. 
MY 
love is young and fair and sweet, 
My fancy she can please, 
But, 0, she is inclined to flirt 
With every one she sees; 
IChenever she goes out alone 
She's sure to catch a 
beau, 
tint then she says it's all for fun, 
And that's no harm, you know. 
I 
want her to be mine, 
And oft I 
tell her so, 
Bu: though she don't decline, 
She wont say yes or no.

You must go and ask papa, George, ha, ha! 
Her father is a 
gruff old man, 
With lots of worldly pelf— 
He says his charming daughter is 
A 
fortune in herself ; 
In that, of course, we both agree, 
But when I 
speak about 
Her hand and heart we have to part, 
For he coolly kicks me out ! 
I

She say it is a 
shame; 
What will we do ? I

Her answer is the same—

THAT GIRL ACROSS THE WAY. 
Words and Music by JosEPII P. :':-71tELLY. 
Music may be had of E. IL H ARD IN G, 229 Bowery, New York. 
I 
SAW her peeping through the blind, 
With a 
laughing, roguish eye, 
And every time I 
looked at her, 
She smiled a 
sweet reply ; 
I 
fell so much in love with her, 
She led me quite astray ; 
But soon I 
found she was a 
flirt, 
That girl across the way. 
CHORUS . 
For she was a 
naughty flirt, 
She fool'd me ev'ry day, 
Oh, boys, beware and never stare 
At girls across the way. 
My duties all were left undone, 
Like a 
fool I 
did behave, 
I 
could not tear my eyes away, 
In truth I 
was a 
slave ; 
From morn till night it was the same, 
The same from day to day; 
In fact I 
was enchanted by 
That girl across the way. 
For she was etc. 
She flirted with her handkerchief, 
She flirted with her fan ; 
You know how girls can u:e such things 
To captivate a 
man ; 
Distraction fill'd my heart and brain. 
While she her tricks did play, 
And still I 
could but gaze upon 
That girl across the way. 
For she was, etc. 
I 
threw her kisses with my hands, 
And she returned the same. 
And soon I 
felt within my breast 
A 
strange consuming flame ; 
At last I 
begged her to come down, 
And hear what I 
should say, 
She came, and with her came a 
man 
Who lived across the way. 
For she was, etc.

Heads up—to ,,

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SOME very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be .true ; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you ; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want ; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetim.e, 
But finds in the end that he can't ; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door ; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
"Ills a 
very hard battle indeed. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A man may be poor, but still honest be. 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace ; 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart
, 
No knowing when the tide it may turn ; 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the worIde 
And your kindness he's sure to return.

ne'er forget the parting kiss 
She gave me at the gate 
One evening fine in summer time, 
As it was growing late. 
She said that we must separate 
• 
That night, and never more 
Should I 
escort her out to walk, 
Or cross her cottage door. 
ClIORUS. 
ne'er forget the parting kiss 
She gave me at the gate ; 
It shattered my once manly heart, 
My grief I 
can't relate. 
I 
asked her why she acted so, 
And pleaded, but in vain, 
For her to stop her foolish talk 
And not say that again ; 
She only laugh'd, and quickly said, 
" 
My dear, ' tis getting late, 
$o I 
must take a 
parting kiss 
Before I 
shut the gate." 
I'll nc'er forget, etc 
I 
loved her as none other loved, 
I 
tried my best to please, 
And thought I 
had a 
comforter 
My later days to ease; 
But bow deceived in her I 
was 
That evening at the gate, 
When I 
received the partincY kiss 
That burned my cheek with hate. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc 
BECAUSE WE WERE POOR. 
Sung by GEORGE HUNTER. 
THERE'S a 
dear spot in Ireland I 
long to see; 
It's my own native birth-place, and it's heaven to me. 
Sure, my poor widowed mother lies there all alone, 
With my brothers and sisters. 
T'was a 
bright, happy 
home. 
Sure, we hadn't much money, but my own mother dear 
To me gave her blessing, bade me heart be good cheer, 
Then the shadow of poverty darkened my door, 
And I 
left mother and Ireland, because we weie poor. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my thoughts oft go back to that dear little spot— 
To my brothers and sisters, and that thatched cot— 
To my poor widowed mother--I'll ne'r see he more. 
'Twas a 
shame ! but I 
left her because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright, rosy morn 
-When old Ireland I 
left how my poor heart did mourn, 
When my blessed old mother said, " Be of good cheer ! 
Good-bye, Michael darling !" Farewell, mother, dear ! 
Then my brothers and sisters took me by the hand 
And bade me do right when I 
left Ireland ; 
Then I 
bade them good-bye at our cottage door, 
And left Ireland and mother because we were poor. 
Oh, my thoughts, etc. 
Since leaving old Ireland my poor mother's dead. 
" 
God bless and protect him !" were the last words she 
said, 
And the ring that my father gave she sent to me. 
'Tis a 
far dearer prize than bright gems could e'er be. 
And my bothers and sisters, I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them ; but they'll come, never 
fear. 
I've a 
neat little cot on America's shore 
Where happy we'll live, although we are poor. 
Oh, my thuoghts, etc. 
Dedicated to my old friend JOHN DOUGHERTY, 
By PHIL. 11. M OWHEY. 
In the gray old village church-yard 
There is seen a 
grassy mound ; 
There is where my mother's sleeping 
'Neath the cold turf-covered ground. 
Brightest flowers cluster round it 
Feathered warblers sing their song; 
While my heart is sad and lonely 
For my mother's dead and gone. 
CIIORUS. 
Gently waves the weeping willows— 
Feathered songsters sing their song— 
While I 
sit so sad and lonely, 
For my mother's dead and gone. 
I 
was young, yet I 
remember 
That sad day when mother died ; 
1 
sat watching, waiting, weeping, 
%Alien she called me to her side. 
Whispering-, 
I'll not see the morning— 
ngel voices bid me conic; 
Trurt in God, we'll meet in heaven 
When life's cares all are done. 
Gently waves, & c. 
Oft I 
wandered to the church- yard, 
Tenderly I 
nurse the flowers— 
There beiil C 
my mother's grave 
pass many, many hours. 
Looking on the sky above me, 
Wondering if it will be long 
,Ere the angels conic to take me, 
To the place where mother's gone. 
Gently waves, & c. 
Give me the Spade and the man who can use it; 
A fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neigh-
bor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the Spade, &do. 
Give me the Spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak of its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with 
gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Create 
our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the Queen of all weapons—the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, &e. 
Give me the Spade. there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done, boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew 
cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yell-
ing. 
Where out stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Sow the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then Hurrah for our true friend, the Spade, boys, the 
Spade.

THERE'S a 
land that is fairer than day, 
And by faith we can see it afar, 
For the Father waits over the way 
To prepare us a 
dwelling place there. 
CHORUS. 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore, 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. 
We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
The melodious songs of the blest, 
And our spirits shall sorrow no more— 
Not a 
sigh for the blessing of rest. 
CHORUS. 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shor.a, 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shorA, 
To our bountiful Father above 
We will offer the tribute of praise, 
For the glorious gift of his love, 
And the blessings that hallow our days. 
CHORUS. 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore, 
In the sweet by-and-by

" 
COME AND LET US REASON TOGETHER." 
It has been well said that he that cannot reason is a 
fool; he 
that dare not reason is a 
slave ; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore address ourselves to you. 
You will have noticed that every Doctor, after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
asks, " Are your bowels regular 7 " 
This you will therefore 
notice is the very key-note by which' he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction he learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may. wander 
to, he soon returns to the digestive organs. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lungs, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the head ; but it is always the bowels he 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of digestion. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
without thorough digestion half the food taken is 
worse than useless. 
As certain things strewn around become 
incorporated with the soil and nourish it (left in a 
compact 
heap they breed disease), so without an active digestion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is.the remedy ? 
Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry off all injurious matter, and at the same time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different ducts. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctors 
recommend is Merlin's Health Granules. 
Pleasant 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving lasting good effects after 
their use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
vinced. 
Merlin's Health Granules do not compete 
with any other aperient medicine; they simply extinguish 
them. 
The sun don't fight with a 
penny dip, it merely out-
shines it.

DON'T WAIT TILL TO- MORROW 
If you feel any symptoms of Jaundice or other complaints be-
ginning in a 
non- acting Liver. 
The bile is stopped, and not 
doing its duty. 
Soon follow torpidity, congestion, mor-
tification, DEATH. Take at once a 
full dose of Mer-
lin's Health Granules. That will stop the disease. 
NERVOUS .DEBILITY 
is the curse of civilization. 
Luckily it can be cured. 
It pro-
ceeds from intense mental strain; from violating physical laws, 
throwing the reins on the neck of Passion. The body becomes 
impaired, the mind follows suit, then the weak body and the 
irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility ; but, as we have said, Nervous Debility 
can be cured; the diseased humors . can be driven from the 
blood ; the stomach becomes strong and active, the heart 
bounds to its work, the mind follows suit, black despair flies, 
health returns, tiot by any miracle, but simply by using the 
great remedy, Merlin's Health Granules. One box 
has been known to bring a 
poor wretch from the edge of the 
grave. 
Do your bones ache 1 You are either filled with Malarial 
Poison or there lingers in your system the dire effects of an-
cestral indiscretions and the Mercurial Poisons never driven 
out. 
But do not despair. 
By judiciously using the never-
failing remedy, Merlin's Health Granules, the poison-
ous atoms are expelled to give place to pure, strength- giving 
blood. 
THE PRESENT DAY 
is the time to try and get well. 
The ounce of prevention i. 
the thing. 
Don't wait till you have to get the nound of cure. 
Stop the first small leak. 
Don't wait till the ship is water-
logged. 
Disease is absolutely prevented by using Mer-
lin's Heaith Granules as a 
family medicine.

JOHNNY MORGAN. 
Sung by JACK CONROY. 
i'LL sing of a 
band that used to play 
Music in the street, 
Nnd if you heard it you would say 
It was anything but sweet. 
They all played different instruments ; 
The music was the same. 
They were all one family, 
And Morgan was their name. 
CHORUS. 
Johnny Morgan played the organ; 
The father beat the drum ; 
The sisters played the tambourine; 
The brother went porn, porn, porn, porn. 
kll alone on an old trombone. 
The music was so sweet 
/hey often got a 
penny to go 
Into another street. 
The; used to say that Johnny 
W IL3 the smartest of them all, 
And around the area windows 
He wou1.1 often make a 
call. 
His music was so lively, 
All the latest airs from France, 
The servant-gir;s could not keep still, 
The music inad;) -,
hem dance. 
Johnny Morgan, etc. 
Now, one day John; he chanced to play 
Outside a 
lady's docr, 
And the lady said she'd never heard 
Such music played before. 
It pleased her so that you must know 
She heavy sums would pay 
To John to stand outside the Li..raise 
And play to her all day. 
Johnny Morgan, etc. 
John played upon his instrumeni, 
And pleased the lady so 
That when the time arrived to leavi_ 
She would not let him go. 
She asked if he would marry her, 
Which John did very soon. 
Now on the organ Johnny Morgan 
Plays her many a 
time.

Beware the first approaches of this stealthy foe, that cometh 
like a 
thief in the night. 
A change of drinking- water, unripe 
fruit, a 
debauch, a 
slight cold may be the first clutch of Fever. 
It can be guarded against and repelled by a 
timely use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. A person shou!d never 
travel to the mountains, to the sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a 
supply. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very great. 
DYSPEPSIA, the arch- fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of Mer:in's Health 
Granules. Why'? 
Because these Gratin:es go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not only drive out the fecu-
lent matter that clogs the avenues of the body, but they in-
vigorate and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery ; then comes 
a 
good appetite, and good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
in the Choiera Years it was found that the first 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effectual for 
this purpose as Merlin's Health Granules, for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man. 
" 
I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT AILS ME!" 
How often do we hear this remark. A man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet says, " Man delights not 
me, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exercise, loss of appetite, deep grief—all these tend to 
render the fluids of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There 
was a 
health- lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit from its waters. 
It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This is precisely the effect produced 
by Merlin's Health Granules. The sluices aro/cleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it is wanted and can do 
most good.

I'VE a 
letter from thy sire, 
Baby mine— baby mine; 
I 
could read and never tire, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
He is sailing o'er the sea, 
He is coming back to me, 
He is coming back to me, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He is coming back to me, 
Baby mine. 
Oh ! I 
long to see his face, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
In his old accustomed place, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Like the rose of May in bloom, 
Like a 
star amid the gloom, 
Like the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
Like the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine. 
I'm so glad I 
cannot sleep, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
I'm so happy I 
could weep, 
Baby mine—Baby mine. 
He is sailing o'er the sea, 
He is coming home to me. 
He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine.
