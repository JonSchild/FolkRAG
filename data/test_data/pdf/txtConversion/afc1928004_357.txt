My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf, 
So it stood ninety years on the floor • 
It was taller by half than the old man himself, 
Though it weighed not a 
pennyweight more. 
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born, 
And was always his treasure and pride; 
But it stopp'd short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
• 
CHORUS. 
Ninety years, without slumbering (tick, tick, tick, tick), 
His life-seconds numbering ( tick, tick, tick, tick), 
It stopp'd short—never to go again-
When the old man died. 
In watching its pendulum swing to and fro, 
Many hours had he spent while a 
boy; 
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know, 
And to share both his grief and his joy, 
For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door 
With a 
blooming and beautiful bride; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Ninety years, etc. 
My grandfather said that of those he could hire, 
Not a 
servant so faithful he found; 
For it wasted no time, and had but one desire— 
At the close of each week to be wound. 
It was kept in its place—not a 
frown upon its face, 
And its hands never hung by its side ; 
But it stopp'd short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Ninety years, etc. 
It rang an alarm in the dead of the night— 
An alarm that for years had been dumb ; 
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for fligl)t— 
That his hour of departure had come. 
Still the clock kept the time, with a 
soft and muffled chime, 
As we silently stood by his side; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died.

In the violet blue, 
Sorrow quits the heart, 
Tears will cease to flow.

FINE OLD ENGLIS 
H GENTLEMAN. 
ru sing you a 
good old song, made by a 
good old pate, 
Of a 
fine old English gentleman, who had an old estate; 
And who kept up his old mansion at a 
bountiful old nte, 
With a 
good old porter to relieve the old poor at his gate. 
Like a 
fine old English gentleman, all of the olden time. 
His hall, so old, was hting around with pikes and guns and bows, 
And swords and good old bucklers, which had stood against old foes, 
And 'twas there " his worship" at in state, in doublet and trunk hose, 
And quaft'd his cup of good old sack to warm his good old nose. 
Like a 
fine old, eiz.c. 
When winter old, btonght frost and cold, he opened house to all, 
And though thr &score and ten his years, he featly led the ball ; 
Nor was the houseless wanderer ever driven from his hall. 
For while he feasted all the great he ne'er forgot the small. 
Like a 
fine old, & c. 
But time, though old, is strong in flight, and years rolled swiftly by, 
And autumn's falling leaf proclaimed, the old man—he must die! 
He laid him own right tranquilly, gave up life's latest sigh. 
And mournful friends stood round his cone 
la and tears beditied each eye. 
* For a 
fine old, &e. 
JAMIE'S ON THE STORMY SEA. 
E'er the twilight bat was flitting, 
In the sunset, at her knitting 
Sang a 
lonely maiden, sitting 
Underneath her threshold tree; 
And e'er daylight died before us, 
And the vesper star shone o'er ns, 
Fitful rose her tender chorus: 
Jamie's on the stormy sea. 
Warmly shone the sunset glowing, 
Sweetly breathed the young flow'rs blowing, 
Earth, with beauty overflowing, 
Seemed the home of love to be, 
As those angel's tones ascending, 
With the song and season blending, 
Ever had the same low ending: 
Jamie's on the stormy sea. 
Blow ye west winds blandly hover 
O'er the bark that bears my lover, 
Gengy blow and bear lAm over 
To his own dear home and me; 
For, when night winds bend the wilierilt. 
Sleep forsakes my lonely pillow, 
Thinking of the foaming billow: 
Jamie's on the stormy sea. 
How could I 
but list, but Hager 
To the song, and hear the singer 
Sweetly wooing heaven to bring her 
Jamie from the stormy sea ? 
And while yet her lips did name me, 
Forth I 
spring, my heart o'erc.ame me 
Grieve no more, sweet, I 
am Jamie, 
Home returned to love and thias.

MEMORY BELLS. 
Wards and Jlasic by HENRY Mama-
DARLING, how can I 
forget thee, 
How lose the memory sweet 
Of the hour when first I 
met thee, 
And laid my true heart at thy feet. 
There we plighted vows so truly 
There in sorrow wild did part, 
Memory bells are ever ringing 
Those mournful changes o'er my heart. 
CHORUS—Murmuring sweetly, cheerily— 
And the tale their music tells while ringing, 
Bids me hope for days of joy, love, 
Those gentle, murmuring memory bells. 
When the silent stars are weeping, 
I 
gaze in grief and pain, 
As my lonely watch I'm keeping, 
Ah, shall we ever meet again 
Cheering souls, with sorrow laden, 
Memory bells—oh! ne'er depart, 
But with pictures of those by-gones, 
Bring hope to glad the weary heart. 
Csonus.—Murmuring sweetly, cte.

HARK, the vesper bells are chiming, 
Hear their notes upon the air,

Call the worshippers to prayer; 
Listen to the tuneful calling 
In the gentle twilight haze, 
Hear the tones so softly falling, 
Hearken to their song of praise. 
CHORUS. 
Hark, the vesper bells are chiming, 
Hear their notes upon the air, 
As the echoes, upward climbing, 
Call the worshippers to prayer. 
Hark, the vesper bells are ringing, 
Hear their music soft and clear, 
Like a 
choir of angels singing, 
Their sweet sounds are ever dear; 
Listen to their mellow blending 
With the softly sighing breeze, 
Hear the notes so slowly wending 
Thro' the tall and leafy trees. 
Hark, the vesper bells, etc. 
Hark, the vesper bells are tolling, 
Hear the melody they make 
When with zephyrs they are strolling 
Far across the misty lake ; 
Listen to the strains harmonious 
Floating here and there in spells, 
Hear the silver strokes so glorious 
Of the chanting vesper bells. 
Hark, the vesper bells, etc.

On! sing to me one song of thine, 
One song before we part; 
The voice that angels stoop to hear, 
Must soothe my aching heart. 
Oh! let it be a 
gentle song, 
Replete with love innate; 
Such as the golden robin sings, 
To win an early mate. 
(Repeat two last linet.) 
'Tis true, when lovers meet to part, 
When breasts with sorrow swell, 
Sweet music lends her cheery voice, 
And helps to say " farewell 1" 
"We've met our last, perhaps for years, 
To-night,we bid adieu 
Our fondest hopes of timely bliss 
Have vanished like the dew. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Then sing to me a 
song of joy, 
One song before we part; 
That I may bear away with me 
Thy music in my heart. 
I'll kiss thee as thou warblest on, 
A 
token of our love; 
And leave thee, till we meet again, 
In care of Heaven above. 
(Repeat two last lines.)

W HEN the toils of day are ended, 
And we reach a 
place of rest, 
Then our happy way is wended 
To that spot we love the best, 
Where we find such joy and pleasure 
With the dear ones all our own, 
For the earth has not a 
treasure 
Like the light of hearth and home. 
CHORUS. 
Home is home, dear home for ever, 
Humble cot or golden dome, 
And the heart should cherish ever 
Golden light of hearth and home. 
Sunny faces linger near us, 
Merry shouts of childish bliss; 
What on earth can ever cheer us 
As a 
happy scene like this ? 
Gentle words and sweet caressing, 
Pleasure rules supreme alone ; 
Where is found so true a 
blessing 
As the light of hearth and home. 
Home is home, etc. 
Round the fireside, close together, 
Singing in a 
sweet refrain, 
Not a 
storm of heart or weather 
There to bring us care or pain; 
We may find it e'er so lonely, 
From its portals we may roam, 
Still, there's naught so bright or holy 
Is the light of hearth and home. 
Home is home, etc.

GROWING older day by day, 
It is sweet to dream of this 
In the years now pass'd away, 
With their scenes of joy and bliss; 
Over all the rosy past 
Recollection's footsteps climb 
To these hours too bright to last, 
In the happy olden time. 
CHORUS. 
Softly, sweetly, to and fro, 
Still the bells of naem'ry chime, 
While bright visions come and go 
Of the happy olden time. 
How we love to live again 
Childhood's fair and sunny hours, 
Wand'ring clown the dear old lane 
Through the paths of fairest flow'rs, 
Straying by each cherish'd spot 
Where in youth we loved to climb, 
Not the slightest word forgot, 
Since the happy olden time. 
Softly, sweetly, etc. 
From those days now dim and old 
Many visions oft arise, 
Dimpled cheeks and locks of gold, 
Sunny smiles and laughing eyes, 
Mother love and childish pray'r, 
Whisper'd in a 
simple rhyme; 
Unforgotten over there, 
In the happy olden time. 
Softly, sweetly, eta.

HER mother was his early love, 
Her sire his boyhood's friend, 
And when they pass'd away, their child, 
The old man vow'cl to tend. 
She was the sunshine of his home, 
A 
rose so bright and fair, 
With all her mother's loving ways, 
Her eyes and golden hair, 
Her eyes and golden hair. 
What wonder to his lonely heart 
Ckept back the love of old, 
but autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold; 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold. 
One day there came a 
seemly knight 
To woo her from his side, 
The old man smiled upon him, 
For her sake, his joy and pride, 
His joy and pride. 
But fielc .
3 
was the knight and false 
(A story threadbare old), 
He woo'd her for a 
little while, 
Then wed for lands and gold. 
A 
blighted flower can bloom no more, 
The old man wept one day, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd, 
His darling pass'd away, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd, 
His darling, his darling, his darling, passed away.

W E 
kiss'd each other, Tom and I, 
Beneath the linden tree, 
And now and then he breathed a 
sigh 
That told his love for me ; 
He held me to his loving breast 
And whispered words of cheer, 
My band in his was softly pressed, 
And I 
had naught to fear. 
CHORUS. 
We kissed each other, Tom and I, 
Beneath the linden tree, 
And now and then he breathed a 
sig._ 
That told his love for me. 
The birds were singing songs of joy 
Among the linden boughs, 
But they did not the least annoy 
My darling's golden vows; 
Within his eyes of gentle blue 
I 
saw the honest heart— 
His promise that he would be true, 
And never from me part. 
We kissed each other, eta 
The kisses that he gave to me 
Beneath the linden leaves 
Have lingered since he went to sea, 
And oft a 
vision weaves; 
In dreams I 
feel his lips again, 
And see his form of grace, 
But nothing will relieve my pain 
Until I 
see his face. 
We kissed each other, etc.

think I 
see him now. How he could sing, too. 
He went 
away five years ago. last Christmas eve. 
Just five years ago 
to-night. 
JAKE.— Why, he taught me the first step I 
ever knew. 
PETE.—Yes, and me too. 
They couldn't beat him much on 
laeel and toe-ology. 
Could they, Jakey? 
JAKE.—Not much. 
PETE.—Then he was so good-natured. 
JOE.—What tricks we used to play on the old man. 
JAKE.—Yes; do you remember when we filled an old hat 
with bricks, and turned it upside down on the ground before 
Uncle Billy's door ? 
He made a 
kick at it, and then you ought 
to have heard him squeal. 
Ha! ha! 
ALL.—Ha! ha! 
JIM.--But he was so good-natured. 
JOE.—Then do you remember how well we fooled him with 
the dinner horn? 
PETE.—Yes; when we filled it up with mud. 
JOE.—Ha 
ha! Who ever saw such a 
face when he got 
through blowing I 
JAKE.—'Twas a 
shame to worry the old man. 
I'd like to 
see him once more.

OH! POOR OLD MAN.--[CoNTINui:D.] 
PETE.—Wouldn't it be a 
joke if he was to walk into this 
room, of all the nights in the year, this very Christmas eve? 
Jim.—Don't; you make me shudder. 
JOE.—Oh, you can't scare me. I 
aint afraid of ghosts; are 
you, Jake ? 
JAKE,—No; wouldn't run for an army of 'em. 
ALL—Guess not. 
JAKE.—Anyhow, not from such a 
good-natured ghost as 
Uncle Billy. 
Why, he wouldn't hurt a 
fly. [Knock heard 
outside.] 
ALL (
startled).—Who that ? [Knock repeated.] 
Am.—Who—who—who's that knocking at the kitchen 
door ? 
Jon.—I 
aint a 
bit frightened; but I'm gone down the street, 
Good bye, boys. [Exit JOE.] 
ALL.—Oh, he's a 
coward. [Knock outside.] 
Am.—I'm a 
good mind to follow Joe. I 
hate to let him go 
alone. 
Not that I'm a 
bit scared. 
Oh, no! 
PETE.—That must be Uncle Billy's ghost 1

think 
I'll leave you, Jake, to keep him company. 
JAKE.— Not if I 
know myself. 
No ghosts for me. 
Let's go 
together. [Exit PETE and JANE.] 
[Air of " Poor Old Man" played plaintively as UNCLE BILL 
enters.] 
UNCLE BILL (
looking round).—Nobody home? I 
thought 
I 
heard voices. 
Can it be possible that these old ears of mine 
have deceived me? I've been away from home just five years 
this very Christmas eve. 
Ah, that's a 
long time to wander up 
and down the world. Maybe the folks are all dead. 
Shouldn't 
wonder. 
Most time for the old man to turn up his toes to the 
roots of the daisies. 
I 
suppose I'm forgotten.

valise.] 
Everything looks so natural.

Ah, they

The room is dark and drear; 
Oh, just a 
little closer creep, 
I 
love to have you near. 
Dear mamma, kiss my eyes to sleep, 
And cheer your darling child, 
You know that papa's on the deep, 
The storm is raging wild; 
I 
hear the surging billows roar, 
His ship is rocked and toss'd! 
The wind is blowing to the shore, 
And papa will be lost. 
Dear mamma, etc. 
Dear mamma, kiss my eyes to sleep, 
And hold me to your breast, 
I'm sorry that I've made you weep, 
But put your mind to rest; 
Perhaps the clouds will break away— 
The billows cease to roar; 
The morn may bring a 
sunny day, 
And papa safe to shore.

But your vows like chaff will scatter, 
You'll forget me, by- and- bye. 
You may, etc. 
You may ask my hand in marriage, 
Name, perhaps, the wedding day,

You may give me precious tokens, 
And my virtues glorify, 
But your promises will wander, 
You'll forget me, by-and-bye.

WHEN GEORGE THE THIRD WAS KING. 
MY DARLING LITTLE QUEEN.

MITCHELL.

D. RossEnt & Co., 126 Tremont 
St., Boston, Mass. Price 30 cents. 
THERE'S a 
sweet and cunning maiden 
With the brightest kind of eyes, 
And her heart is never laden 
With a 
load of heavy sighs; 
She's as merry as a 
robin, 
She's the dearest I 
have seen, 
And my heart is ever throbbing 
For my darling little queen. 
CHORUS. 
Darling little queen, my darling little queen, 
She's as merry as a 
robin, 
She's the dearest I 
have seen, 
And my heart is ever throbbing 
For my darling little queen. 
In her smile there is a 
gladness 
That illuminates the face, 
And the slightest trace of sadness 
Her sweet glance would soon efface, 
She has teeth of pearly whiteness, 
She has hair of golden sheen, 
And there is a 
fairy lightness 
'Bout my darling little queen. 
Darling little queen, etc. 
Where the sunbeams loved to linger, 
And the linnet used to sing, 
Once I 
placed upon her finger 
What she termed the wedding ring; 
Tho' I 
chanced to leave my dearest, 
And the verdant village green, 
Soon I'll take the path that's nearest 
To my darling little queen. 
Darling little queen, etc.

JERSEY SAX. 
Ohl I 
was bo7n in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wiog. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans, 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
But I'm Jersey Sam, the Farmer's man, 
Hurrah! hurrah ! hurrah! 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can ; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago. 
For lam one, &a. 
When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
But now, when they are twelve years old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call for rum and beer, 
And smoke cigars, heigh-ho ! 
What would our parents have thought of that 
Sot ‘e 
Fifty Yeats ago? 
For I 
am one, &S. 
At midnight, too, one hears yonng men, 
With husky voices sing, 
That. " Champagne Charlie" is their namo, 
And they know it's no such thing; 
They go to bed with a 
bead-ache, 
At least they tell its so. 
I 
never heard of such a 
thing, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am ono, &a 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw a 
line: 
But wear our hats and jackets, 
And appear quite masculine; 
They wear false hair, for it's the style, 
And call it their own ; you know— 
Bnt our girls would scorn to wear a 
wig, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one &a.

Young folks, come listen to my song, 
I'm old, I 
won't detain you long,

My hair once black has all turned gray, 
But what, of that while I 
feel gay,

If I 
was as young as I 
used to be.

When I 
was young I 
knew life's joys, 
But many sorrows have come, my boys, 
My dear old wife the joy of my life, 
I 
lost some twenty years gone by.

story ' twould break your heart, 
But let all sorrow and grief depart.. 
I'm a

Tididi i

When I 
was young and in my prime, 
I 
was with the girls the most of my time, 
I'd take them out each day for a 
ride, 
And always had one by my side. 
I'd hug and kiss them just for fun, 
And I've proposed to more than one, 
So if any girl here wants a 
kiss from me, 
She' I 
find me as young as I 
used to be.

TWENTY YEARS AGO. 
i 
have wandered by the village, Tom—I've sat beneath be tree, 
Upon the school-house playing-ground, which sheltered you and 
me; 
But none are left to greet me, Tom, and few are left to knor 
That played with us upon the green, just Twenty Years Ago 
The grass is just as green, dear Tom; bare-footed boys at play 
tire sporting just as we were then, with spirits just as gay; 
But master sleeps upon the hill, all coated o'er with snow, 
That afforded us a 
sliding-place, just Twenty Years Ago. 
The old school-house is altered some, the benches are replaced 
By new ones very like the same our pen-knives had defaced; 
But the same old bricks are in the wall, the bell swings to and 
fro, 
The music just tho same. dear Tom, 'twas Twenty Years Ago. 
The river is running. just as still—the willows on its side 
Are larger than they were, dear Tom, the stream appears less 
wide; 
The grape-vine swing is rained now, where once we played the 
beau, 
And swung our sweet-hearts, pretty girls, just Twentffears 
Ago. 
The spring that bubbled 'neath the hill, close by the spreading 
beech, 
Is very high—'twas once so low that we could almost reach; 
thit in kneeling down to get a 
drink, dear Tom, I 
started so, 
To see how sadly I 
am changed since Twenty Years Ago. 
Down by the spring, upon an elm, you know I 
cut your name— 
Your sweet-heart is just beneath it, Tom—and you did mine 
the same; 
Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark—'twas dying sure, 
but slow, 
just as the one whose name you cut, did Twenty Years Ago. 
31y lids have long been dry, dear Tom, but tears come in my 
eyes; 
I 
thought of her I 
loved so well—those early brollen ties; 
L 
visited the old church-yard, and took some flowers to strew 
Upon the graves of those we loved, some Twenty Years Ago 
some are in the church-yard laid, some sleep beneath the sea 
But few are left of our old class, excepting you and me; 
But when our time shall come, dear Tom, and we are called to 
go, 
t 
hope they'll lay us where we played, just Twenty Years Ago

JOHN. — Glad to see you, old friend Joe! [They shake hands 
cordially.] 
JOE. — Why, let me see, its a 
long while since we've met, and 
we're both very near to the bottom of the bill, hey, John ? 
JOHN.—Aye, aye; but barrin' a 
little bit of rheumatiz, these 
old legs of mine are good for many a 
mile yet. 
JOE. —Yes, yes; why, we're as good as the best of 'ern: al-
though the snow is falling on our heads, there's plenty of 
warmth beneath. 
Ha! ha! 
JOHN.—And then what good old times we've had, hey, Joe / 
Do you remember the rosy-checked girls we've kissed in our 
youth ? 
JOE. —Do I? 
Shall I 
ever forget 'em ? 
JOHN. --And the jolly meeting with our companions! 
JOE.—And the bouts we've had over our punch I 
JOHN. -And the picnics! 
JOE.—And the songs we've sang. 
JOHN. — Ha! ha!

his side as if in pain.] 
JOE.—Ho!

ONE OF THE OLDEN TIME, 
Oh, I 
was born some years ago 
When George the Third was King, 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing.

And every day we must improve, 
But I

If folks are any better now 
Than fifty years ago, [Yes, 3'm one, cte.

favorite place of resort for Cadets on a 
con-
vivial party, " sans permissione." The lamented0Brien, formerly a 
sergeant in the anus', was commi=sioned as a 
lieutenant in the " Eighth 
Infantry." Before or while about joining his regiment, he stopped at 
'West Point to visit an eaTly friend of his, the late Major RIPLEY

ARNOLD, then a 
first class Cadet, rcsiding at No 32 " Rue de Cockloft," 
lathe old North Branch. They made frequent excursions to" Benny's." 
The song was composed by O'BRtEx, ARNOLD, and others of the class,

graduates who ever learned the way to " Benny Havens" during their 
academical course at West Point,

BROKEN DOWN. 
Once I'd money plenty!

Then fortune smiled upon me

With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last. 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I

THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL ON THE Garza 
How I 
love the bright daysi of my youth, to review, 
And fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful and true, 
And friendship which knew no alloy; 
Oh, the thoughts that returns as I 
ponder the past, 
Recalling each dear youthful scene ; 
But the one I 
most prize, and shall love to the last, 
Is the old village school on the green. 
Near that dear village church, there the cotta,-re still stands, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light, 
And now over the porch, in rich cluster bands. 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As when with garlands and wreaths of wild flowers 
We joyously crownen our layqueen, 
And told the childish love-tales in the neat little bowers, 
By the old village school on the green. 
Tho' I've left many dear and some loved ones behind, 
At rest as I've journeyed along, 
There are others remain just a.s faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the song. 
So whenever I'm called for grim death to prepare, 
I'll answer with spirit serene, 
If they'll lay me at rest, when I've breathed my last prayer 
sear the old village school on the green. 
THERE IS NO HOME LIKE MY OWN. 
In the wild Chamois track, at the breaking of morn, 
With a 
hunter's pride, o'er the mountain side, 
'We are led by the sound of the Alpine her; 
Tra la la is Is la is la Is la. 
Oh! that voice to me is a 
voice of glee, 
Wherever Dry footsteps roam. and I 
long to bound, 
When I 
hear that sound, agail to my m inntain home. 
In the wild Chamois track, at the breaking of morn, 
With a

And there is no spot llke the simple cot,

There the skies are bright. and our hearts are light, 
Our bosoms without a

And our sport the fray with the mountain roe or deer.

GIVE THE MAN OF AN HONEST HEART. 
Give me the man of an honest heart, 
I 
care not what he be; 
lie may be rich, he may be poor, 
It matters not to me; 
He may not wear a 
silken vest 
Or boast of high degree, 
But if he owns an honest hear‘ 
lie's nature's all to me. 
CHORUS. 
All praise then be to him, 
Who acts a 
noble part; 
For, a 
right good man is he 
Who owns an honest heart. 
What if a 
man can learning boast, 
And wealth of golden ore, 
Yet, if he lacks an honest heart, 
I 
call him yet but poor. 
Tell me not of wealth and rank, 
They're bubbles on the sea, 
A man may dwell in gilded halls, 
But may not honest be. 
All praise then be to him, &o. 
Oh 1 
if he owns an honest heart, 
Is gentle, true and kind, 
We need not search the wide world o'er, 
A better man to find. 
Then give to ev'ry man his due, 
Who acts the honest plan; 
It is the heart, and not the coat, 
That makes the honest man. 
All praise then be to him, ttte. 
THE OLD FRIENDS STILL. 
As time speeds on with his relentless wing, 
He is bringing a 
change to all, 
The daisies peep from the lap of spring, 
And the oak leaves fade and fall, 
The new ones grow old and the old depart. 
And the years their cycles fill; 
The friends that are new may be kind and true 
But give me the old friends still. 
The friends that are new 
May be kind and true. 
But give me the old friends still. 
The friends that I 
loved when the spring was born, 
That were true when the summer died, 
That were still unchanged thro' the ebb and flow 
Of my life's unstable tide, 
The flower that blooms in sun's warm ray, 
May fade when the night is chill, 
The friends that are new may be kind and true, 
But give me the old friends still. 
The friends, tire. 
Oh! give me a 
clasp of the same warm hand, 
That I 
felt in the days of yore, 
And give rue the heart that time has proved. 
Is true to the inmost core; 
For time speeds on and friends are few, 
Whom the void in the heal t 
can fill, 
The friends that are new may be kind and, true, 
But give me the old friends still.

Am—" The Admiral." 
I 
hope you will not think me bold, 
Or, say I 
make too free, 
The young folks say I'm growing old, 
Though I'm -only sixty-three. 
It scents to me but yesterday, 
My good old wife and I 
Stood hand in hand in the village church., 
Our hearts both filled with joy. 
And then at night, oh, what delight, 
Such joys were seldom seen, 
As each voting fellow took his lass, 
And tr pped it on the green. 
In that gay throng there was not ono 
At wrestling could me throw ; 
But I'm not as young as I 
used to be, 
Some Forty Years Ago, 
ellOECS. 
No, I'm not as young as I'd used to be, 
Some Forty Years Ago. 
When I 
have done my daily toils, 
My wife stands at the gate, 
She asks, her face bedecked with smiles, 
What kept you out so late ? 
She'll take my arm and lead me to 
The arm-chair by the fire, 
And if I 
feel a 
little cross, 
her patience never tire. 
My grand children they gather round, 
And on my knees will creep, 
I 
sing, and te 1 
them stories 
'Till they all drop off to sleep. 
'Tis then we talk of the good old times, 
When first I 
was her Lean, 
And I 
feel as young as I 
used to feel, 
Some Forty Years Ago. 
Yes, I 
feel as young as I 
used to feel, 
Some Potty Years Ago. 
Air—" Put the Break on." 
There's nothing like good wine depend, 
To make man's heart rejoice, 
And nothing like a 
good old friend, 
To cheer him with his yUcc 
Tho' life is brief—and cares and grief, 
Most of us have to bear. 
With friends to laugh—and wine to quaff, 
We need not quite despair. 
CHORUS. 
With good old friends, and good old wine, 
To cheer this life of mine ; 
With good old friends, and good old wine, 
I 
never will repine. 
A bottle of old crusted port, 
Give me when things look blue, 
A good old friend, a 
PORT-1y sort, 
To share it with me, too; 
With both, beside my own hearthstone, 
I 
envy ne'er a 
man— 
Celestial Emperor, on his throne, 
Nor Turk on his divan ! 
With good old friends, & c. 
When women jilt, when men betray, 
When fortune on us frowns, 
When wealth takes wing and flies away, 
In this life's ups and downs. 
Or when we mourn— for loved ones gone 
And feel inclined to pine, 
It's sweet to meet—and kindly greet, 
Old friends, with good old wine. 
With good old friends, &c. 
I 
envy not the millionaire, 
Nor wish for rank and show, 
I 
only want a 
moderate share, 
Of good things, here below; 
This maxim's mine— till I 
recline 
In my last tenement, 
With good old friends, and good old wine,

'WILL WATCH. 
T'was morn, when the wind from the northward blew keenly, 
While sullenly roar .d 
the big waves of the main, 
A famed smuggler, Will Watch, kiss'd his Sue, then serenely 
Took helm, and to sea boldly steer'd out again; 
Will had promised his Sue, that this trip, if well ended, 
Should coil up his hopes, and he'd anchor on shore. 
When his pockeis were lined, why his life should be mended 
The laws he had broken he'd never break more. 
fils sea-boat was trim, made her port, took her laiincr, 
Tnen Will stood for home, reach'd the offing and cried, 
This night, if I've luck, furls the sails of my trading, 
In dock I 
can he, and a 
frit-
nd serve beside; 
Will lay-to, till night came on darksome and dreary, 
TO crowd every sail then he piped up each hand, 
But a 
signal soon spied, 'twas a 
prospect uncheery, 
A. signal that warn'd him to bear from the land. 
The Philistines are out, cries Will, we'll take no heed on'tt 
Attack d, who's the man that will flinch from his gun ? 
Should my head be blown off. I 
shalt ne'er feel the need out 
We'll fight while we can ; when we can't, boys, we'll run ; 
Through the haze of the night a 
bright flash now appearing, 
Oh ! now, cries Will Watch, the Philistines bear down, 
Bear- a- hand, my tigl,t lads, ere we think about sheering, 
One broadside pour in, should we, swim, boys, or drown. 
But should I 
be popp'd off, you, my mates, left behind me, 
Regard my last words, see 'em kindly obeyed : 
Let no stone mark the spot, and, my friends, do y•ou mind t.te, 
Near the beach is the grace where Will Watch would be laid; 
Poor Will's yarn was spun out—for a 
bullet next minute 
Laid him low on the deck, and he never spoke more. 
His bold crew fought the hr g 
while a 
shot remained in it, 
Then sheeed—and Will's Lull to his Susan they bore. 
In the dead of the night his last wish wtts complied with, 
To few known his grave, and to few known his end, 
He was borne to the earth by the crew that he died with, 
He'd the tears of his Susan, the prayers of each friend ; 
Near his grave dash the billows, the winds loudly bellow, 
You ash struck with lightning, points out the bo.d bed, 
Where Will Watch, the bold smuggler, that famed lawleaS 
fellow, 
Once feared, now forgot„ sleeps in peace with the dead.

I 
WON HER HEART AT BILLLARDS.—Concluded. 
Our host one lovely daughter had, 
Who dearly loved the game, 
Sometimes she'd join us with the cue, 
And set our hearts a 
flame; 
She'd oft with winning grace declare, 
While watching us at play, 
That he who proved himself the best, 
Would win her heart some day. 
CHO. — Oh! the game, eze. 
I 
do believe that each of us, 
hind in his turn proposed, 
To wed this little maiden fair, 
Who feigned to be opposed; 
Till she at last with firm resolve, 
Gave us to understand, 
That he who at a 
game scored most, 
Might claim her heart and hand. 
Cno.—Oh! the game, &c. 
No sooner was it said than done, 
Each man was handicapped, 
To strive his best, to win the prize, 
To which his heart was wrapt; 
The time arrived, the tournament, 
Was fought with cue and ball, 
But I 
came out victorious, 
And fairly beat them all. 
Cno.—Oh! the game, &c. 
With smiles as bright as sunshine, sh4a 
Applauded my success, 
And fondly leaning on my arm, 
Returned my glad caress; 
And never from that very day, 
Do I 
the game regret. 
But always look on Billiards, with 
A 
love I 
can't forget. 
Cno.—Oh! the game, &c.

GOOD OLD FRIENDS, 
When I 
think of the friends of my youth, 
And the hearts that were dear to me then, 
I 
turn with a 
sigh to the days gone by, 
Yet I 
love to recall them again. 
When I 
think of the friends that once were mine, 
And hearts that were gentle and true, 
My heart still bends to my good old friends, 
And I 
sigh when I 
bid them adieu. 
CHORUS. 
For my heart still bends to my good old friends, 
To my good old friectls of yore, 
And I 
turn with a 
sigh to the days gond by, 
And the hearts that shall greet me no more. 
When I 
think of a 
mother so kind, 
And the hearth of my childhood so dear, 
Wherever I 
roam I 
dream of that home, 
With a 
sigh that would melt to a 
tear. 
When I 
think of that hand that led me forth, 
And the footsteps that followed my own, 
And my eyes they smiled when she called me a 
child, 
Have faded and left me alone. 
For my heart, itc.

POLLY PUT THE KETTLE ON. 
I 
am a 
merry, happy chap, 
A 
jolly cove am I, 
One of those very merry boys 
Who never will say die; 
I 
have a 
very loving wife, 
Her age is twenty-one, 
She's like me and other folka, 
So fond of harmless fun. 
Sometimes we invite a 
friend, 
An hour or two we pass, 
For nothing beats at home, 
A 
social pipe and glass; 
And when the clock is striking four, 
It's then I 
sing with glee, 
"Polly, put the kettle on, 
We'll all have tea." 
cnouus. 
Polly, put the kettle on, 
The kettle on, the kettle on, 
Polly, put the kettle on, 
And make it sing with glee. 
Polly, put the kettle on, 
The kettle on, the kettle on, 
Polly, put the kettle on, 
We'll all have tea. 
Now when a 
very little lad, 
I've often heard them say, 
Polly, put the kittle on, 
And clean the things away; 
Don't sit reading there so long, 
But get the tea things laid, 
And when being done, 
A 
pretty aspect made, 
There's nothing looks much nicer, 
On a 
cold and frosty day, 
Than to see the toast and butter, 
Shining on the tray; 
like I've heard it when a 
child, 
[11 
FOLLY PUT THE KE1.1.LE ON.----LCoNcLuDED. 
Those words still stick to me,

Polly, put the kettle on, dm 
A 
brother I've, a 
sailor, 
The other day came home, 
He told us of his travels, 
And where he'd been to roam-, 
He told us of his battles, 
What wondrous things be did, 
And when he'd hoist his slacks, 
And chew another quid. 
I 
gazed with all astonishment, 
At his altered style, 
And judge of my surprise. 
Altho' it made me smile, 
For with a 
voice like thunders 
To my missus shouted out, 
"Polly, put the kettle on, 
We'll all have tea." 
Polly, put the kettle on, rke. 
No matter where I 
go, 
Or when invited out, 
As the clock is striking four, 
You'll hear my welcome shout; 
Some folks may langh at me, 
For them I 
do not care, 
As I'm a 
chap as you can see, 
I'm jo117 everywhere ; 
So not to creak the friendship, 
I 
ask you one and all, 
Some afternoon when you have time, 
On me to make a 
call, 
And as the clock is striking four, 
It's then I'll shout with glee, 
"Polly, put the kettle on, 
We'll all have tea."

HAPPY OLD MAN', 
Oh, young folks, how do you do? 
You're all looking quite well ; 
I 
suppose you don't know me. 
Well, my name is Grandfather Ben, 
About sixty years ago, 
was young and happy then ; 
But I'm told I'm getting old, 
So pity Grandfather Ben. 
CHORUS. 
Fal de dal du ral d.a, 
Fal de dal du ral da, 
Fal de dal, fal de dal, 
Fal de dal du ral da. 
In the days when I 
was young, 
Of civility one was sure; 
But now as you walk the street, 
You're either a 
guy or a 
cure. 
The other day some smart young chap, 
I 
think it was on Monday ! 
Says, see here, Old Cauliflower, 
Oh, where are you going next Sunday ? 
CHORUS.— It's the truth now, what 1 
say, 
The boys that you may meet. 
They're sure to shout, when you walk out, 
! 
Governor, how's your poor old feet ? 
So now Pve had my say, 
I'll just begin to toddle, 
About sixty years ago 
I 
could run instead of waddle. 
But I'm glad to see you here, 
Whenever I've the chance; 
So now I'll bid you all good-bye, 
And off at once I'll dance. 
CHORUS—No wonder you may laugh, 
When I 
say off I'll dance ; 
There was a 
time when I 
could, 
But now the rheumatics won't give me a 
chance.

THE IVY GREEN. 
Oh! a 
dainty plant is the ivy green, 
That creepeth o'er ruins old; 
Of right choice food are his meals I 
ween, 
In his cell so lonely and cold. 
The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed., 
To please his dainty whim; 
And the mouldering dust that years have made, 
La a 
merry meal for him. 
Creeping where no life is seen, 
A rare old plant is the ivy green. 
Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings, 
And a 
staunch old head hath he; 
How closely he twineth—how tightly he clings 
To his friend, the huge oak tree! 
And slily he traileth along the ground, 
And his leaves he gently waves. 
As he joyously hugs, and crawleth round 
The rich mould of dead men's graves. 
Creeping vhere grim death bath been, 
A 
rare old plant is the ivy green. 
Whole ages have fled and works decayed, 
And nations have scattered been ; 
But the stout old ivy shall never fade, 
From its hale and hearty green. 
The br , ve old plant in its lonely days 
Shall fatten on the past; 
For the stateliest building man can raise, 
Is the ivy's food at last. 
Creeping where grim death hath been, 
A 
rare old plant is the ivy green.

THE GRAVE OF BONAPARTIL 
On a 
lone barren isle, where the wild roaring billows, 
Assail the stern rock, and the loud tempests rave, 
The hero lies still, while the dew- drooping willows, 
Like fond weeping mourners lean over the grave. 
The lightnings may flash and the loud thunders rattle, 
He heeds not, he hears not, he's free from all pain; 
He sleeps his last sleep, he has fought his last battle, 
No sound can awake him to glory again— 
No sound can awake him to glory again. 
Yet, spirit immortal, the tomb cannot bind thee, 
For like thine own eagle that soared to the sun, 
Thou springest from bondage, and leavist behind thee 
A 
name, which before thee no mortal had won. 
Though nations may combat, and war's thunders rattle, 
No more on thy steed wilt thou sweep o'er the plain; 
Thou clecp'st thy last sleep, thou hest fought thy last battle, 
No sound can awake thee to glory again— 
No sound can awake thee to glory again 
Oh, shade of the mighty, where now are the legions, 
That rushed but to conquer when thou led'st them on? 
Ala.s! they have perished in far chilly regions, 
And all save the fame of their triumph is gone. 
The trumpet may sound, and the loud cannon rattle, 
They heed not, they hear not, they're free from all pain; 
They sleep their last sleep, they have fought their last battle 
No sound can awake them to glory again— 
SO sound can awake them to glory wait%

THE CAPTAIN AND HIS WHISKERS, 
Words and Music by T. 
II. 
BATLT. 
As they marched through the town, with their banners so gay. 
ran to the window to hear the band play; 
I 
peeped through the blinds very cautiously then, 
Lest the neighbors should say I 
was looking at the men. 
Oh 1 I 
heard the drums beat, and the music so sweet, 
But my eyes at the time caught a 
much greater treat, 
The troop was the finest that I 
ever did see, 
And the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly glance at me. 
When we met at the ball I 
of course thought it right, 
To pretend that we never had met till that night; 
But he knew me at once I 
perceived by his glance, 
And I 
hung down my head when he asked me to dance; 
Oh ! he sat by my side at the end of the set, 
And the sweet words he said I 
never shall forget; 
My heart was enlisted and could not get free, 
As the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly glance at me: 
But he marched from the town and I 
saw him no more, 
Yet I 
think of him still and the whiskers he wore; 
I 
dream all the night, and I 
talk all the day, 
Of the love of a 
Captain who has gone far away; 
I 
remember with superabundant delin•ht, 
When we met in the street aud we danced all the night; 
And I 
keep in my mind how my heart jumped with glee, 
As the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly glance at me.
