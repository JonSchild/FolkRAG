I'm always gay and free, my boys. 
Where'ver I 
may go, 
A fig for every grief I 
say, 
And every petty woe; 
I 
laugh at what the world calls care, 
Am always gay and free, 
Look always on the. brighter side, 
That is the style for me,

Always gay and free, boys, 
happy as can be, boys, 
"That's th6 style for me, boys," 
Always gay and free. 
The fleeting years go swiftly by, 
And life is but a 
span, 
To treat its troubles lightly is 
By far the better plan; 
Brave hope will cheer -us on our way, 
On land or stormy sea; 
Look always on the brighter side, 
That is the style for me. 
I'm 
Always , gay and free, &c. 
Though troubles often bore us, 
And the world seems dark and drear, 
We've better days before us, 
if we only persevere; 
Behind life's darkest clouds 
A silver lining we may see; 
Look always on the brighter side, 
That is the style for me. 
I'm' 
Always gay and free, cte. 
Though gay, and free, as I 
have said, 
' 
You always may depend, 
That I 
will do my best to soothe 
The troubles of a 
friend ; 
A kindly word works wonders, 
I 
am sure you will agree: 
Look always on the brighter side, 
That is the style for me.

Always gay and free, &Air

AURA LEE. 
When the blackbird, in the Spring, warbling o'er the lea. 
Sat and rocled, I

Aura Lee, Aura Lee, maid of golden hair, 
Sunshine came along with thee, and swallows in the air. 
CHORUS.

Maid of golden hair, 
Sunshine came along with thee, 
And swallows in the air.

Fairer face was never seen kissing lips of rose. 
Aura Lee, Aura Lee, take this golden ring, 
Love and light it brings to thee, and swallows in the spring,

The pride of all the village and the fairest in the dell, 
Is the Queen of my song, and her name is Fairy-Belle; 
The sound of her light step may beheard upon the 
Like the fall of the snow-drop, or the dripping of the rill. 
, CHORUS: • 
Fairy-Belle, Gentle Fairy-Belle, 
The Star of the night, and the Lily of the day ; 
Fairy- Belle, the Queen of all the dell, 
Long may she revel on her bright sunny wy 
She sings to the meadows, and she carols to the streams; 
She laughs in the sunlight, and smiles, while in hr dreams; 
lter hair, like the thistle down, is borne upon the air. 
And her heart, like the hummingbird's, is free from ev'ry care. 
Fairy-Belle, kk,:e. 
Her soft notes of melody around me sweetly fall ; 
Her eye, full of love, is now beaming on my soul; . 
Tiie sound of that gentle voice, the glance of that eye 
Surround me with rapture that no other heart could sigh,

Wild roved an Indian Girl, 
Bright Alfarata, 
Where sweep the waters, 
Of the blue Juniata. 
Swift -Ts an antelope, 
Through the forest going, 
Loose were her jetty locks, 
In wavy tresses flowing. 
Gay was the mountain song, 
Of bright Alfarata, 
Where sweep the waters, 
Of the blue Juniata. 
Strong and true my arrows are, 
In my painted quiver, 
Swift goes my light canoe 
Down the rapid river. 
Bold is the warrior good, 
The love of .Alfarata, 
Proud waves his snowy plume 
Along the Juniata. 
Soft and low he speaks to me, 
And then his wilt' cry sounding, 
Rings his voice in thunder loud, 
Front height to height resounding. 
Thus sang the Indian Girl, 
Bnight Alfarata, 
Whrre sweep the waters 
Of the_blun Juniata. 
Fleeting years have borne away, 
The voice of Alfarata, 
Still rolls the river on, 
Blue Juniata.

For the angels have placed a

With Willie, who has gone before

CHARCOAL MAN. 
In Brooklyn city there used to a 
dwell a 
gal unknown to fame, 
Iter mother's name was Mary Ann, and hers was Mary Jane. 
Every morning in the summer time, she crossed the briny river 
To her market stall, where she sold fresh tripe, sassangers, like-
wise liver. 
There was a 
gallant charcoal man, McClosky was his name, 
his fighting weight was seven stone ten, and he loved sweet 
Mary Jane. 
He drove her out in his charcoal wagon, 'twas on St. Patrick's 
day, 
When his donkey took fright at a 
Jersey man, and started down 
Broadway. 
They both did holler with all 
stop, 
But he upset Mary Jane, wagon

pity,

WHY DID SHE LEAVE HIM. 
Why did she leave him? They grew up together, 
Near to the old church on the bright village green, 
Never to part, in fair or foul weather, 
Ellen and Edward in childhood were seen. 
She had not wealth, but her beauty commanded 
Suitors, alas! who could riches secure; 
But when her hand as his bride he demanded, 
Why did she leave him ? Because he was poor. 
He was once mild, young, and gay-hearted, 
First in the frolic at market or fare; 
Ills are the cheeks whence the smile has departed, 
Others may revel, but. he cannot share; 
Bright are the eyes that around him are.

Cold is the heart that still strives to adore, 
Save when, at night, on the past he is thinking— 
Why did she leave. him? Because he was poor. 
Now she rides by in her pride and her carriage, 
But where is the bloom that once shone on her cheek? 
Haughty and proud are the friends of her marriage, • 
Now she must feel what she dares not to speak. 
She, perchance, smiles for her earliest hours, 
Grieves for the sorrows that he must endure, 
And would give up the world for a 
wreath of wild flowers—

Kind friends, your pity, pray, bestow 
On one who stands before you,

Though I 
promise not to bore you. 
I 
longed to be a 
soldier's bride,

For I

COUNTY JAIL, 
COUNTY JAIL.--[coNcLuDED.j 
Good people, all give ear I 
pray, and mark ye all to What I 
say; 
To my misfortunes, great and small, come listen and I'll tell you 
all: 
I 
used to lead a 
glorious life, devoid of care, devoid of strife; 
Could go to bed and fall asleep, no ugly visions around me creep— 
But, oh I 
the toots and Cupid gods, they nearly drove me ramp-
ing mad, 
They piped into a 
railroad mail and carried me off to the County 
Jail I 
And when we got to the end of the route, the turnkey turned my 
pockets out, 
To see if I 
had got such stuff as money, grub, tobacco, or snuff; 
They took me in to try my size, the color of hair, the color of 
eyes— 
They measured me up from root to lip, to see if I 
had but one top 
lip; 
Then straightway to the yard did go and ordered me a 
suit of 
clothes, 
The kyds .came out and did me hail; " Another new cove for 
County Jail I" 
Then one of them,'with a 
roguish leer, says./' My jolly old cove, 
what brought you here l" 
What do you think brought me out, what brought me here but 
your railroad route ? 
Then they gathered around me like so many fools, and one talked 
about the rules, 
That each new corner should sing a 
song, or tell a 
tale-God knows 
how long— 
Or they'd break his wind and give him a 
whack, or they'd take 
hirn down to Black Jack, 
From there they wollop him-, tooth and nail, with an old wet 
towel' from County Jail I 
As I 
walked out and strolled the yard, thinking my 
case was won - 
drous hard, 
All at one" I 
heard a 
din, the deputy warden shouts " All in 
Then lumbering down the yard we go, like beasts let out of a 
wild beast show— 
Some cracked in mind, and some in wind, and others with a 
crack 
behind ; 
Then one by one we march around the tub to get our county 
allowance of grub, 
Which blew our ribs out like a 
sail with a 
skilly and whack from 
County Jail! 
At five o'clock one of them said; " It is nearly time to go to bed :" 
The truth from him 
round did creep, for all turned in and went 
to sleep. 
The turnkey bawled as stiff as starch: " Right about face and 
then quick march I" 
We did, and made such a 
rush like monkeys marching around a 
bush. 
Such clanking of clogs, such shaking of knees, such croaking of 
hellys, and clanking of keys, 
Such damning beds as hard as a 
nail, they'd starve a 
poor devil 
in County Jail! 
At six next morning up we got, each man was called to clean his 
pot, 
Then through the yard we did lurch, all fell in line to go to 
church; 
And there such dresses as met my view, one arm was red, the 
other was blue— 
One leg was yellow, the other was gray, and then the parson be-
gan to pray. 
He said that Elijah went up in a 
cloud, and Lazarus walked about 
in his shroud, 
And that Jonah he lived inside of a 
whale, a 
d 
d 
sight better 
' than County Jail 
Service being over, we all got back, and fell in line for skilly and 
whack; 
We crushed like pigs all in a 
lump—at nine each took his hand at 
pump. 
At ten we raised a 
glorious mill, and smothered each other with 
right good will 
At eleven we raised it and quit the house, all fell in line for pans 
of skouse. 
.Then if there's a man, no matter how droll, we pop him into 
Pompies hole, 
Where whack and water-cocks his tail, there's glorious times in 
County Jail

DARK-EYED SAILOR. 
'Tis of a 
comely young lady, fair, 
Was walking out for to take the air; 
She met a 
Sailor, upon the way; 
So, I 
paid attention to hear what they did say. 
Fair maid, said he, why roam alone? 
For, the night is coming, and the day's far gone ! 
She said, while tears from her eyes did fall: 
It's my Dark-eyed Sailor that's proving my downfall ! 
There's two long years since he left this land; 
A 
gold ring he took from off my hand; 
lie broke I 
lie token : here is half with me, 
And the other is rolling at the bottom of the sea. 
Cried William; Drive him from off your mind ! 
As good a 
sailor as him you'll find ; 
Love turns aside, and cold does grow, 
Like a 
winter's morning, when the hills are clad with snow. 
These words did Phcebe's fond heart inflame. 
She cried: On me you shall play no game! 
She drew a 
dagger, and then did cry: 
For my Dark-eyed Sailor a 
maid I'll live and (lie! 
his coal-black eyes and his curly hair, 
And flattering tongue, did my heart ensnare ; 
Genteel he was; no rake like you, 
To advise a 
maiden to slight the Jacket Blue. 
But a 
tarry sailor I 
will never disdain, 
But always I 
will treat the same ; 
To drink his health here's a 
piece of coin ; 
But my Dark-eyed Sailor still elauns this heart of mine. 
When Willaim did the ring unfold, 
She seemed distracted, 'midst joy and woe. 
You're welcome, William ; I 
have lands and gold, 
For my Dark- eyed Sailor, so manly, true, and bold ! 
In a 
cottage, down by the river-side, 
in unity and love, they now reside. 
So, girls, be true, while your lover's away: 
For, a 
cloudy morning oft brings a 
pleasant day

I'll sing to you a 
song, dat you all likes to hear,

THE DARK GIRL DRESSED IN BLUE. 
From a 
village, up the Hudson, 
To New-York, here, I 
came, 
To see the Park called Central, 
And all places of great fame : 
But what I've suffered since I 
came, 
I 
now will tell you. 
How I 
lost my heart and senses too, 
Through a 
dark girl dressed in blue. 
CHORUS. 
She was a 
fine girl, 
Fol de riddle I

'Twos on a 
Friday morning, 
The first day of August 
When of that day I 
ever think, 
My heart feels ready to bust! 
I 
jumped into a 
Broadway stage, 
The Central Park going to; 
On a 
seat, by the right-hand side of the door, 
Sat a 
dark girl dressed in blue. 
She was, & c. 
Now, we hadn't gone on very far, 
When the lady looked so strange, 
The driver knocked down for his fare, 
Says she ; I 
have no change: 
I've only a 
Ten-dollar bill: 
Oh, dear! what shall I 
do? 
Said I: Allow me to pay.—Oh ! tnank you, sir, 
Says the dark girl dressed in blue. 
She was, tke. 
We chatted and talked, as we waward walked, 
About one thing or other : 
She asked me, too,: ( oh ! wasn't it kind?) 
If I 
had a 
father or a 
mother. 
Says I. Yes, and a 
grandmother too, 
But pray, Miss, what are you ? 
Oh ! I'm chief- engineer in a 
milliner's shop, 
Says the dark girl dressed in blue. 
She was, & c. 
We walked about for an hour or two 
Through the park, both near and far;

THE DARK 
GIRL DRESSED IN BLUE.—[coNCLUDED.] 
She slipped in my hand a 
Ten- dollar bill— 
I 
said: What are you going to do ? 
Oh ! don't think it strange, I 
must have change, 
Said the dark girl dressed in blue. 
We had some slight refreshments, 
And I 
handed out the bill ; 
The barkeeper counted out the change, 
And the bill dropped in the till; 
'Twas in currency and silver change. 
There was a 
three-cent piece or two, 
So I 
rolled it up and gave it to 
The dark girl dressed in blue. 
She was, erc 
She was, (te. 
She thanked me, and said: I 
must away; 
Farewell ! till next we meet ; 
For, on urgent business I 
must go 
To the store, in Hudson street. 
She quickly glided from my sight, 
And soon was lost to view; 
I 
turned to leave, when by my side 
Stood a 
tall man dressed in blue. 
She was, &e. 
This tall man said: Excuse me, sir, 
I'm one of the ' special force; 
That bill was bad; please come with me. 
I 
had to go, of course. 
Said I: For a 
lady I 
obtained the change, 
Says he: Are you telling me true ? 
What's her name? Says I: I 
don't know, 
She was a 
dark gitrl dressed in blue. 
She was, & c. 
My story they believed, thought I 
was deceived, 
But said I 
must hand back the cash. 
I 
thought 'twos a 
sin, as I 
gave her the tin, 
Away went ten dollors smash ! 
So, all young men, take my advice, 
Be careful what you do, 
When you make the acquaintance of ladies strange— 
Especially a 
dark girl dressed in blue.

THE FINE OLD IRISH GENTLEMAN. 
I'll sing you a 
dacent song that was made by a 
Paddy's pate, 
Of a 
raal ould Irish gintleman, who had a 
tine estate, 
Whose mansion it was made of mud, with thatch and all complate 
With a 
hole at the top, through which the smoke so gracefully 
did retrate, 
hurrah for the ould Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden time 
His walls so cold, were cover'd wid the devil a 
thing for show, 
Except an ould shillalah, which had knocked down many a 
foe, 
And there ould Barney sat at ease, without shoes or hose, 
And quaft'ed his noggin of potteen to warm his big red nose, 
Like a 
fine mild Irish gintlemsn, the boy of the oulden time. 
To Donnybrook his custom was to go to every fair, 
And though he'd seen a 
few score years, he still was young when 
there, 
And while the rich they feasted him, he still among the poor, 
Would sing, and dance, and hurl and fight, and make the spal-
peens roar, 
Like a 
real ould Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden time. 
But och mavrone! once at a 
row ould Barney got a 
knock, 
And one that kilt him, 'cause he couldn't get o'er the shock; 
They laid him out so beautiful, and then set up a 
groan, 
°eh ! Banney, darlint, jewel dear, why did you die? och, hone! 
Then they waked this Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden time. 
Though all things in their course must change, and seasons pass 
away, 
Yet Irish hearts of oulden time were just as at this day. 
Each Irish boy, he took a 
pride to prove himself a 
man, 
To serve a 
friend and bate a 
foe, it always was the plan 
Of a 
raal ould Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden time.

FADED FLOWERS. 
The flowers I 
saw in the wild, wild wood 
Have since dropped their beautiful leaves, 
And many dear friends of my childhood, 
have slumbered for years in their grave. 
But the bloom on the flowers I 
remember, 
Though their smiles I 
shall never more see, 
For the cold chilly winds of December, 
Stole my flowers, my companions from me. 
The roses may bloom on the morrow, 
And many dear friends I 
have won, 
But my heart can part but to sorrow, 
When I 
think of the ones that are gone. 
"Es no wonder that I 
am broken-hearted, 
And stricken with sorrow should be, 
For we have met, we have loved, we have parted, 
My flowers, my companions, and me. 
How dark looks this world and how dreary, 
When we part from the ones that we love, 
But there's rest for the faint aid the weary, 
And friends meet with lost ones above. 
. 
But in heaven I 
can but remember, 
When from earth my proud soul shall be free, 
That no chilly winds of December, 
Shall steal my companions from me.

HIGHLAND MARY. 
Ye banks and braes and streams around 
The castle of Montgomery, 
Green be your wcods and fair your flowers, 
Your waters never drumlie; 
There simmer first unfaulds her robes 
And there they langest tarry, 
For there I 
took the last farewell 
Of my dear Highland Mary. 
Hoiv sweetly bloomed the gay green birk, 
how rich the hawthorn's blosom, 
As underneath her fragrant shade 
I 
clasp'd her to my bossom: 
The golden hours on angel wings 
Flew o'er me and my dearie, 
For dear to me as light and life, 
Was my sweet Highland Mary_ 
Wi' many a 
vow and lock'd embrace 
Our parting was fu' tender, 
And pledging aft to meet again,. 
We tore ourselves asunder; 
But 0 
fell death's untimely frost 
That nipt my flower sae early, 
Now green's the sod and cauld's the clay, 
That wraps my Highland Mary.

pale, pale now those rosy lips 
I 
oft hae kiss'd sae fondly, 
And clos'd for aye the sparkling glance 
That dwelt on me sae kindly ; 
And mould'ring now in silent dust 
That heart that lov'd me dearly, 
But still within my bosom's core 
Shall live my Highland Mary.

A

A 
play-thing for the ladies, 
No care in childhood's hour. 
The girls would kiss and hug me, 
Saying; That's a 
dear, don't cry; 
And fondly lull me fast asleep, 
And sing sweet lullaby. 
How they did press and cuddle me, 
Till I 
felt any how. 
Undress, and put me off to bed! 
I 
wish they'd do it now. 
I'd choose to be a

And took me on their lap,

And dress me fine somehow, 
And let me do whate'er I 
liked,

wish they'd do it now !

Oh ! when I

I ALWAYS TAKE IT COOL. 
Now, just keep cool and lend your ears, 
And listen to my song; 
Though folks at first may think me green, 
I 
always get along; 
The reason why ? is very plain, 
For this I 
make a 
rule: 
When other folks get in a 
heat, 
I 
always take it cool. 
The other day while walking out, 
Stop thief! 
I 
heard the cry; 
An excited crowd pursued a 
man, 
And soon, he passed me by; 
A 
nice gold watch he'd in his hand, 
IIe dropped it, like a 
fool; 
When they'd gone past, I 
picked it up, 
For, I 
always take it cool. 
Unto a 
ball I 
went one night, 
Two fellows raised a 
row, 
And soon, they had a 
general fight, 
'Twas an awful time, I 
vow! 
Hats, bonnets, shawls, and coats were lost, 
Confusion was the rule; 
I 
came out with a 
bran-new overcoat, 
For, I 
always take it cool. 
One evening going down Broadway, 
(Remember that I 
shall ! ) 
Two nice young men were pitching in, 
'Twas all about a 
gal; 
And while they went it right and left, 
Hard hitting was the rule: 
I 
took her arm, and saw her home, 
For, I 
always take it cooL 
I 
dropped in at a 
faro-bank, 
To see them play the game; 
When some one hollered out Police! 
Then, terror seized each frame: 
They all rushed off, like little boys 
Skedaddling out of school; 
I 
nabbed the stakes, and out I 
stepped, 
For, I 
always take it cool.

A travling box stood by her side; upon it: Jemima Brown. 
CHORUS. 
I Used to take her ey'rywhere, to all the sights in town; 
And then she left me in despair, did naughty Jemima Brown. 
At a 
baby-linen builder's, in the Burlington-Arcade, 
I 
next saw Miss Jemima, as past the shops I 
strayed; 
'She looked the Queen of a 
sewing machine, I 
spent there many a 
crown, 
In collars and straps, and babies' caps, to gaze at Jemima Brown.

used to take her, & c. 
I 
sought an introduction, obtained it; all was right; 
At eight o'clock I'd meet her, and walk home every night. 
To seal our loves, I 
bought her gloves, to Cremorne we went down, 
Took tea and shrimps, drank bitter beer, and waltzed with Jemima 
Brown. 
I 
used to take her, & c. 
One night I 
flew to meet her, the weather yet was warm; 
I 
saw her fondly leaning on a 
nice young fellows arm I 
Against my will, I 
felt quite ill ; inquiring with a 
frown, 
Who's that? It's only brother Bill, said naughty Jemima Brown. 
I 
used to take her, & c. 
I 
want to ask a 
favor; I 
hope you won't be cross, 
Or think it had behavior; but father had a 
loss. 
Would you kindly lend us fifty pounds? My brother he'll be bound. 
Of course I 
would; could I 
refuse my life to Jemima Brown ? 
I 
used to take her, dic. 
From that very day I 
missed her, tho' she said she'd be my bride. 
From Kensington to Chester I 
sought her, far and wide. 
Years after that, when passing by a 
shop in Camden-Town, 
'Midst heaps of greens and kidney-beans, there stood Jemima 
Brown. 
I 
used to take her, & c. 
She was weighing out potatoes, throwing coppers in the till; 
Three lovely children by her side, the image of brother Bill. 
Her broken vow, I 
see it now, ( but not my fifty pounds,) 
That shop was BOUGHT—and I 
was SOLD by naughty Jeminia Brown. 
I 
used to take her, &c.

JOHNNY SCHNOIKER: 
LI 
this song, an old German musician tells his friend, Johnny 
Schmoker, about the instruments upon which he can play, and 
describes them by motions while he sings. 
When performed by 
a 
chorus, especially of men, the movements being in exact time, 
and all together, an effect is produced which has not been equal-
led by anything of the kind ever produced in this country. 
Ob-
serve, that the motions are made only when the words describing 
the instruments are sung, as for example, at " Rub a 
dub a 
dub," 
the roll of the drum is imitated, beginning (as in the case of all 
the instruments) with the first, and ending exactly with the last 
word; at " Filly willy wink," the hands are placed as if playing 
the fife, and the fingers only move; at " Tic knock knock," the 
right hand strikes three times under the left, as if playing the 
triangle; at " Boni born born," the hand is moved forward and 
back, as if playing the trombone; and so on to the last, which is 
imitated by crooking both arms and striking with them against 
the sides, as if playing the bag-pipe.. 
Observe that the singing 
at some of the instruments is loud, and at others soft; also, that 
the phrase where each instrument is first mentioned', is repeated, 
and that the first movement, which is sung when each instrument 
is introduced, is, to save room, printed but once.

And trips it along the brook side, 
0, how I 
do wish that I 
was a 
fish. 
To be caught by sweet Kitty Clyde. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, (ke. 
How I 
wish that I 
was a 
Bee, 
I'd not gather honey from flowers, 
But would steal a 
dear sip from Kitty's sweet lip, 
And make my own hive in her bowers. 
Or, if I 
was some little bird, 
I 
would not build nests in the air, 
But keep close by the side of sweet Kitty Clyde, 
• 
And sleep in her soft silken hair, 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, & c. 
Near a 
bog in sweet Ireland, 
I 
am told sure there born 1 
was, 
Well 1 
remember a 
bright Monday morn it was, 
My daddy, poor man, would cry, what a 
green-horn I 
was; 
Three months I 
am married, hurrah how they laugh, 
Says he to my mother, troth Judy I'll leave you joy, 
Says Judy to him, 0 
the devil may care, my boy, 
By St. Patrick I'll leave you both here to weep and cry 
What shall we do for our daddy O'Gaff. 
With my didrewhack off I 
am, 
None of your blarney, man, 
Keep your brat to your chat all the day so you may, 
By the powers I 
won't tarry, 
So he left little Larry, 
I 
never saw more of my daddy O'Gaff. 
Och, it's then I 
grew up, and a 
sweet looking child I 
was, 
Always the devil for handling the stick I 
was, 
But somehow or other my numbscull so thick it was, 
Go where I 
would all the folks they did laugh. 
I 
rambled to England where I 
met with a 
squad of boys, 
They got me promoted to car:y the hod, my boys, 
I 
crept up a 
ladder like a 
cat newly shod, my boys, 
A 
steep way to riches, says Larry O'Gaff. 
With my didrewhack in and out, 
Head turning round about, 
Ladder crack, break your back, 
Tumble down, crack your crown, 
My dear Mr. Larry, this hod that you carry, 
Disgraces the shoulders of Mr. O'Gaff. 
They made me a 
master, then dressed like a 
fop I 
was, 
Bran new and span new from bottom to top I 
was, 
But the old fellow popt in as taking a 
drop I 
was, 
Says he, Mr Larry, you bogtrotting calf, 
Get out of my house or I'll lay this about your back; 
With the twig in his hand like the mast of a 
herring smack, 
Over my napper he made the switch for to crack, 
Says I, this don't suit you, Mr. O'Gaff. 
With my didrewhack hub bub ho, 
Drums beating row de row, 
0 
dols my life plays the fife, 
Patrick's day, fire away; 
In the army so frisky 
We'll tipple the whisky, 
With the whack for old Ireland, 
And Larry O'Gaff. 
Then they made me a 
soldier, but oh, how genteel I 
was, 
Scarlet and tapes from the neck to the heel I 
was, 
Larry, says I, when brought into the field I 
was, 
This sort of fighting don't suit you by half; 
We fought like the devil as Irishmen ought to do, 
So sweetly we beat Mr. Bony at Waterloo; 
But now the wars are over, and peace we've brought home to you, 
Welcome to old Ireland, and Larry O'Gaff. 
With my didrewhack save ray neck, 
Round an l 
sound free from wound, 
With a 
wife to spend my life, 
Sport and play, night and day, 
Arrah with your blarney, 
For the breed of the Carneys, 
Would fight for old Ireland, 
And Larry O'Gaff.

THE LOW BACK'D CAR. 
When first I 
saw sweet Peggy, 
'Twos on a 
market day, 
A Low Back'd Car she drove, and sat 
Upon a 
truss of hay. 
But when that hay was blooming grass, 
And deck'd with flowers of spring, 
No flowers were there that could compare 
With the charming girl I 
sing. 
As she sat in the Low Back'd Car, 
The man at the turnpike bar, 
Good natured old soul, never asked for his toll, 
But looked after the Low Batted Car. 
In battle's wild commotion, 
The proud and mighty Mars, 
With hostile scythe demands his tythes 
Of death in warlike sears; 
But Peggy, peaceful goddess, 
has darts in her bright eve, 
That knocks men down in the market town, 
As right and left they fly; 
As she sits in the Low Back'd Car, the battle more dangerous 
far, 
For that aoctor's art cannot heal the smart 
That is hit from the Low Back'd Car. 
Sweet Peggy round her car, sirs, 
has strings of ducks and geese, 
But the scores of hearts she slaughters, 
By far outnumbered these ; 
While she among her poultry sits, 
Just like a 
turtle dove, 
Well worth a 
cage, I 
do engage. 
With the blooming God of Love. 
As she sits in her Low Back'd Car, the lovers come near and far, 
And envy the ehikens that Peggy is picking, 
As we rode in her Low Back'd Car, 
I'd rather own that car, sirs, 
With Peggy by my side, 
Than a 
coach and four, and gold galore, 
With a 
lady for my bride; 
For the lady would sit forninst me 
On a 
cushion made with taste, 
While Peggy would sit bipside me, 
With my arm around her waist. 
As we rode in that Low Back'd Car, to be married by Father 
11Iagar, 
Oh, my heart would beat high, at each glance of her eye, 
As we rode in her Low Back'd Car, 
THE LANDLORD'S PET 
A IR 
There was a 
Jolly Miller. 
I 
was once the landlord's pet, 
When I 
had money to spend ; 
For I 
spend it in drink, and did verily think 
It never would come to an end. 
CHORUS. 
But now I've nothing but rags to my back, 
And my boots won't hide my toes, 
While the crown of my hat goes flap, flip, flap, 
And just twig my rum-blossomed nose. 
The landlord called me a 
decent fellow, 
And oh ! but I 
was vain, 
As he got my cash, and I 
got his trash, 
To soak my poor silly brain. 
But now I've nothing but rags, & c. 
But everything has got an end, 
And some landlord's chalks have got two ; 
And the money which brought me such great respect, 
To the landlord's pocket soon flew. 
But now I've nothing but rags, & c. 
The landlord's coat is good broadcloth, 
And his pants are no worse of the wear; 
But the landlord's coat was bought by the sot, 
And so was his wife's false hair. 
But now I've nothing but rags, & e. 
The landlord who keeps at the sign of the Pox, 
Soon kicked me out of his door; 
For, landlords can tell, by instinct, full well, 
When a 
body's confoundedly poor. 
But I 
had nothing but rags, & e. 
Now I've got a 
sprinkling of sense; . 
I'll sign the Pledge to abstain, 
And Old Harry may cook me up for a 
mess, 
if I 
e'en touch their trash again. 
CHORUS. 
For, I 
fain would get some clothes to my back, 
And the boots that would hide my toes, 
And the crown of my hat shall no more go flip, flap, 
Nor rum discolor my nose.

LULA IS GONE. 
With a 
heart forsaken, I 
wander, 
In silence, in grief, and alone; 
On a 
form departed I 
ponder, 
For, Lula, Sweet Lula is gone. 
Gone when the roses have faded, 
Gone when the meadows are bare; 
To a 
land by orange blossoms shaded, 
Where Summer ever lingers on the air. 
CHORUS. 
Lula, Lula, Lula is gone! 
With Summer birds, her bright smiles, 
To sunny lands have flown. 
When day breaketh gladly, 
My heart waketh sadly; 
For, Lula, Lula is gone! 
Not a 
voice awakens the mountains; 
No gladness returns with the dawn; 
Not a 
smile is mirrored in the fountains; 
For, Lula, Sweet Lula is gone! 
Day is bereft of its pleasures, 
Night of its beautiful dreams, 
While the dirge of well remembered measures, 
Is murmured by the ripple on the streams. 
Lula, Lula, cl7c. 
"nien I 
view the chill blighted bowers, 
And roam o'er the snow-covered plain, 
How I 
long for Spring's budding flowers, 
To welcome her sweet smiles again I 
Why does the earth seem forsaken? 
Time will this sadness remove; 
At her voice the meadows will awaken 
To verdure, sweet melody and love.

When birds are singing in the trees, 
And natureJs face is fair, 
Where wild flowr's bring the busy bees, 
I 
often wandered there, 
To meet young Harry in the grove,— 
But where can harry be ? 
I 
placed a 
letter to my love 
In yonder hollow tree; 
In yonder hollow tree, 
In yonder hollow tree; 
I 
placed a 
letter to my love, 
In yonder hollow tree. 
No " Postman's knock," or ringing bell, 
No maids to peep and see, 
Dear Harry knows this very well, 
He's sure to come to me. 
Young Cupid watches near 
The lover's hollow tree, 
Hell see me safe, I've nought to fear, 
While Harry's true to me ; 
Dear Harry's true to me, 
Dear Harry's true to me; 
He'll see me safe, I've nought to fear, 
Dear Harry's true to me.

THE LONE STARRY HOURS 
0, the lone starry hours give me, love, 
When still is the beautiful night; 
When the round laughing moon I 
see, love, 
Peep throult the clouds, silver white, 
When no wind through the low woods sweep, love, 
And I 
gaze on some bright rising star, 
When the world is in dream and sleep, love, 
0, wake while I 
touch my guitar. 
'Till the red rosy morn grows bright, love, 
Far away o'er the distant sea, 
Till the stars cease their gentle light, love, 
Will I 
wait for a 
welcome from thee. 
And 0, if that pleasure is thine, love, 
We will wander together afar ; 
Mv heart shall be thine, thine mine, love, 
Then wake while I 
touch my guitar. '

Oh, Lilly, sweet Lilly, dear Lilly Dale, 
Now the wild rose blossoms 
O'er her little green grave,

Her cheeks that once glowed 
With the rose tint of health, 
By the band of disease had turned pale, 
And the death damp 
Was on the pure white brow, •

I 
go, she said, 
To the land of rest, 
And ere my strength shall fail. 
I

You must lay poor Lilly Dale. 
Oh, Lilly, & c.

LAZY CLUB. 
AIR—" Green grow the Rashes, oh." 
My wife is such a 
lazy Turk, 
She will not do a 
bit of work; 
She says she isn't such a 
fiat, 
:Hard work will never make her fat. 
But in the morning when she wakes, 
Iler breakfast up stairs then she takes,. 
She treats herself to toast and shrub, 
And says she's joined a 
lazy club.

When she takes it in Tier head, 
She makes me lift her out of bed; 
To say a 
word, I 
do not dare, 
But place her in an easy chair. 
To stir a-peg it seems a 
crime; 
Why, there she sits till supper time. 
While I'm obliged to cook the grub, 
Because she's joined the lazy club. 
Skiddy mi dig, & e. 
My eldest daughter's just as bad— 
I 
really think she's lazy mad; 
She seems too lazy now to talk, 
And scarce seems half inclined to walk; 
IIer tongue is never free from scolds, 
Her shoes are always full of holes, 
Her dress is never free from mud, 
in honor of the lazy club.

LAZY CILM3.—{CONCLUDED .) 
My dutiful son shows off his airs ; 
lie cannot sit without throe chairs, 
And he pretends he's got the gout, 
And NVantS me then to carry him about. 
He is too lazy to go to bed, 
So snores upon the chair instead, 
Wanted me to give his boots a 
rub, 
In honor of thQ lazy club. 
Skiddy mi dig, tlx. 
We keep a 
girl about sixteen, 
To mind the house and keep it clean, 
But lawks, she is such a 
lazy elf, 
I'm obliged to do it all myself; 
.And if I 
ask her then to stir, 
She says I 
ought to wait upon her, 
And give the yard and kitchen a 
scrub, 
in honor of the lazy club. 
Skiddy .mi dig, tirc. 
We keep a 
very lazy dog, 
Who lays about, just like a 
log; 
Ile seems too lazy to wag his tail, 
And trys to imitate the snail, 
Before the fire all in a 
heap ; 
Why, there he lies, goes fast asleep, 
And lawks, he is such a 
lazy chub, 
I 
think he's joined the lazy club. 
Skiddy, mi dig, & e. 
And now I 
am in a

Through their cursed laziness; 
And now my debts I 
cannot pay, 
In prison shall be obliged to lay,

They'll be obliged to help themselves, 
And no doubt, when they're in want of grub, 
They must get it from the lazy club.

Maggy, dear, I 
come to hear that you've been on a 
spree, 
Where is my whole week's wages, I 
pray come tell to me ; 
When I 
come home at night I 
find no smell of drink on you, 
Yet I 
would like to know how you laid out my One Pound Two, 
Oh, Johnny, dear, I 
have it here, pen'd down in black and white, 
Come count it now right after me, and you will say I'm right; 
You've been told that I've been on a 
spree, but you'll find it is 
not true, 
For I 
will let you know how I 
laid out your One Pound Two. 
In the first place there is one shilling paid for two stone of meal, 
Served four of us around the week2I am sure it aint a 
great deal, 
And four stone of potatoes, for you know no less wonld do, 
That's three and twopence halfpenny out of your One Pound Two. 
For two hundred weight of coal three shillings I 
did pay, 
Fourpenny loaf each morning, and two on the Sabbath day, 
And every morning for the child—it's a 
baby son it's true, 
That's seven and cloven pence out of your One pound Two. 
Seven pence for sugar, seven pence for tea, 
Seven pence for tobacco, that's one penny worth each day, 
And one shilling for beef, you know no less would do, 
That's ten and ninepence ha'penny out of your One Pound Two. 
Sixpence for a 
pound of ham, and seven pence for a 
steak, 
And sixpence for vegetables it every week does take, 
Fourpenee for two eggs this day I 
paid for you, 
That's eleven and eleven pence ha'penny out of your One Pound 
Two. 
Twenty pence for butter, John—you know it's of the best, 
And fourpence more for buttermilk—now add that to the rest; 
Oh, Johnny, dear, you ask what with your money I 
do. 
That's thirteen and tenpence ha'penny out of your One Pound 
Two. 
There is four shillings for rent, that's all we do require, 
And ninepence for sticks for to kindle up the fire, 
Arid one shilling for milk, soap, soda, starch, and blue, 
Add that up and you will exactly find your One Pound Two. 
Maggy, dear, your neighbors on you do complain, 
They tell me my whole wages you every day do spend. 
That a 
virtuous woman is worth gold I 
find it to be true: 
You've exactly counted up my One Pound Two. 
ONE POUND TWO.

OM WOULD I WERE A FLY 
Oh ! would I 
wear a 
fly, to buzz about all day, 
Oh ! wouldn't I 
live high, without a 
cent to pay ; 
And in store- windows I 
would bask it in the sun, 
And lick molasses-candy—oh! wouldn't that be fun ? 
I'd never mind the taxes, no matter how they'd rise; 
Fur, while there's stamps on every thing, there's none upon tin 
flies. 
C11011 US. 
Oh ! would I 
were a 
fly, to buzz about all day ! 
Oh ! wouldn't I 
live high, without a 
cent to pay. 
Oh! if I 
were a 
fly, a-buzzing I 
would keep, 
And hunt until I'd find some bummer- chap asleep ; 
So jolly it would be upon his nose to light, 
Or drop into his ear, and there I'd buzz and bite; 
And, if away he'd drive me, I 
would come back*again ; 
For, flies are mighty lively, when plaguing sleepy men. 
Oh I 
would I 
were, die. 
Oh! if I 
were a 
fiv, I'd on a 
gin glass light; 
Then I 
would sip away, and never would get tight, 
Nor fear to be arrested, or through the streets to reel; 
For, a 
tly can sip his toddy, and ne'er a 
headache feel. 
Oh ! then, how I 
would guzzle, with no fear of human woes, 
And never have a 
pimple, or strawberry on my nose. 
Oh! would I 
were, dye. 
Oh! if I 
were a 
fly, from place to place I'd roam; 
I'd have no rent to pay, I'd have no care athome ; 
For unlike married men, then 1 
would laugh at fate, 
And have no wife to scold me, if I 
should stop out late; 
No falsehood 1 
should try, or no excusive dodge, 
By telling Mrs. Fly, that I 
was at the lodge. 
Oh! would I 
were, &e. 
! 
if I 
were a 
fly, some pretty girl I'd seek, 
And, just beneath her eye, I'd perch upon her cheek: 
And I 
would linger there, and fellers, passing by. 
Would all be sure to envy the happy little fly, 
If with a 
gal a 
feller a 
game like that e'er tries, 
She'd smack him in the snout, or else sihe'd scratch his eyes. 
Ohi woughl I

PADDY O'LYNN. 
One Paddy O'Lynn courted Widdy APKay, 
He bold as a 
lion, she fresh as the day ; 
Now to win her, he knew he the widdy must plase, 
So he thought the best thing he could do was to tase. 
"Now Paddy be aisy, you devil," she'd cry, 
And she'd smack Paddy's chops, while she'd look at him sly: 
"Lave your tricks and your nonsense, and mind your affairs, 
Through your tickling I 
know I'll be tumbling up stairs!" 
" 
My honey," says Paddy, " that, some folks do say, 
Is a 
sign that you'll soon know your own wedding day; 
And it's pleased that I 
am—sure to say so's no sin, 
since 'tis all for good luck," says Paddy O'Lynn. 
" 
Arrah, now I" says she, " Pat, don't think of the like, 
For I 
didn't say no to your fat cousin Mike, 
The sole of my shoe he loves, thpugh it arn't whole." 
Says Paddy, 
Pd rather love you than your soul." 
" 
Now, Paddy, I'll squeal, and I'll punch your fool's head— 
Sure I'm dreaminc.,, each night, I've your cousin in bed ;" 
Says Paddy, " That same I 
am glad that you say, 
For drames always go quite the contrary way; 
So, Widdy, kape draming that same till you die, 
When you drame Mike's in bed, why, you'll find it is I; 
And its's plased that I 
am, sure to say so's no sin, 
For 'tis all for good luck," says sly Paddy O'Lynn. 
" 
Arrah! Widdy, my darling, you've plagued me enough, 
And sure, then, 'tis time that you left off such stuff; 
For your sake I've been fighting, and broken my head, 
And think after this, it is time we were wed." 
Then Paddy so sly, threw his arms around her waist, 
And his lips put to her's, of their sweetness to taste; 
And he looked in her eyes that were sparkling so bright, 
And he hugg'd her swate form—faith, then, sure he did right. 
" 
Now, Paddy, be quiet, to take you I'm loath, 
Sure, I've now had two husbands, and done for them bath." 
e;Then have me for the third, and p'raps this time l';•1 win, 
F'or the third Unit is different," says Paddy O'Lynn.

Was spread at Paddy's wedding , 0!

And still as they guttled, the merry pipes 
Struck up a

And then, at night, 0 what delight, 
To see them all footing and prancing, 0 1 
An opera or ball were nothing at all 
Compar'd to the style of their dancing, 01 
And then see old Father Quipes,

POLL Y PERKINS. 
I'm a 
broken-hearted butcher-boy, in grief fin arrayed, 
l'hrough keeping the company of a 
young servant-maid, 
Who lived on board-wages, the house to keep clear, 
In a 
gentleman's family, near Washington Square. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she was as beautiful as a 
butterfly 
there's none could compare 
With pretty little Polly Perkins of Washington Square. 
tier eyes were as black as the pips of a 
pear; 
No rose in the garden with her cheeks could compare; 
lIer hair hung in ringlets so beautiful and long I 
I 
thought that she loved me, but found I 
was wrong. 
Oh! she was, ike. 
When I'd call in the morning, and cry: Meat! below 
At the sound of my voice, her face she would show, 
With a 
smile upon her countenance, and a 
laugh in her eye; 
If I 
thought she'd have loved me, I'd have laid down to die ! 
Oh ! she was, & c. 
When I 
asked her to marry me, she said: Oh ! what stuff! 
And told Inc to drop it, for she'd had quite enough 
Of may nonsense—at the same time I'd been very kind, 
But to marry a 
butcher-boy, she didn't feel inclined. 
Oi ! she was, & e. 
Oh ! the man that has me must have silver and gold— 
A 
chariot to ride in, and be handsome and bold ; 
His hair must be curly as any watch-spring, 
And his whiskers as big as a 
brush for clothing. 
Oh ! she was, & c. 
The words that she uttered went straight through my heart; 
I 
sob-bed, I 
sigh-ed, and straight did depart, 
With a 
tear on my eyelid as big as a 
pear— 
Bidding good-bye to Polly Perkins and Washington Square. 
Oh 1 
she was, &e. 
In six months she married, this bard hearted girl; 
It was not a 
Viscount, it was not an Earl , 
It was not a 
Baronet—but worser by far—

bow-legged conductor of a 
Third- Avenue ear I

PRETTY MAID MILKING HER COW. 
It being on a 
fine summer's morning, as birds sweetly tuned on 
each bough, 
I 
heard a 
fair maid sing most charming, as she sat a 
milking her 
CONN% 
Her voice was enchanting, melodious, which left me scarce able to 
go; 
My heart it was soothed in solace, by the pretty maid milking her 
COW. 
With courtesy I 
did salute her—good morrow most amiable maid ; 
I 
am your captive slave for the future. 
Kind sir, do not banter, 
she said ; 
I 
am not such a 
precious rare jewel that I 
should enamor you so; 
I 
am but a 
plain country girl, said this pretty maid milking her 
cow. 
The Indies afford no such jewel, so precious and transparent clear, 
Oh, do not refuse to be my jewel; but consent and love me, my 
dear ; 
Take pity and grant my desire, and leave me no longer in woe; 
Oh, love me or else I'll expire, sweet colleen Dhas cruthin amoe. 
I 
don't understand what you mean, sir, I 
never was a 
slave vet to 
love— 
These emotions I 
cannot experience, so I 
pray, these affections 
remove ; 
To marry, I 
can assure you, that state I 
will not undergo, 
So, young man, I 
pray you will excuse me—said this pretty maid 
milking her cow. 
Had I 
the wealth of great Omar, or all on the African shore : 
Or had I 
great Devonshire's treasure, or had I 
ten thousand times 
1nore, 
Or had I 
the lamp of Alladin, and had I 
his genii also, 
I'd rather live poor on a 
mountain, with colleen Dhas cruthin 
amoe. 
I 
beg you withdraw, and do not tease me; I 
cannot consent unto 
thee ; 
I 
prefer to live single and airy till more of the world I 
see. 
New cares they would me embarrass, beside, sir, my fortune is 
low, 
Until I 
get rich, I'll not marry, said the colleen Dhas cruthin.amoe. 
A young maid is like a 
ship sailing, she don't know how long she 
may steer ; 
For in every blast she is in danger, so consent, and love me, my 
dear. 
For riches, I 
care not a 
farthing; your affection I 
want, and 14) 
more ; 
In wedlock I 
wish to bind you, sweet colleen Dhas cruthin anoto61. 
THE RAGGED COAT 
Oh, what a 
world of flummery, there's nothing but deceit in it; 
So you will find through life, e'er as you travel on; 
Old and young, rich and poor, every one you meet in it, 
'Tis the same. I 
will maintain, and prove it in my song; 
Whex I 
was poor I 
found that friends seldom e'er did heed me, 
Till a 
rich one died and left me cash, which set me all afloat, 
So then I 
had money, but I 
kept it quite a 
secret, 
And to fathom out deception I 
put on a 
ragged coat. 
I 
thought my friends I 
would try, as I 
had so many, 
At least so they professed to be at Brooklyn, Mr. Ford. 
And as a 
trip by steamboat would be cheap as any — 
I 
went down to the ferryboat, and quickly stepped on board, 
When I 
heard a 
silly puppy say, though lowly he did breathe it, 
'Tis a 
shame to let a 
ragged man on board of a 
steamboat, 
Says I, you speony rascal, there's a 
good heart beats beneath it, 
Don't despise a 
man because he wears a 
ragged coat. 
My 
journey being ended, I 
placed my foot on shore, sirs, 
Glad enough I 
Was of such a 
crew to get relief, 
I 
went to the house and knocked at the door, sirs, 
The people all kept eyeing me as though I 
was a 
thief, 
The door was banged against my face with many a 
bitter snarl, sirs, 
When I 
shouted loud: Good Mister Ford, I 
come to pay a 
note. 
I 
beg your pardon, sir, said he, come step into the parlor, 
We thought you were a 
begging when we saw your ragged coat. 
A chair was quickly placed for me and down T 
sat instanter, 
You've come front town, you must be tired, pray stop here and diue 
Jane, bring the glasses, likewise the decanter, 
I 
think that you will find that it is most excellent port wine. 
Your wine you may keep, though I 
got this ragged dress on, 
I 
tell you what, I 
changed my mind, I 
mean to keep my note, 
And put it to sonic better use, so let this be a 
warning, 
Don't despise a 
man because he wears a 
ragged coat. 
Next I 
went a 
courting the brisk young widow Moore, sir, 
I 
went to the house and boldly I 
proposed, 
Is suit I 
pressed, but she exclaimeil, pray show this knave tho door! 
At the sight of my appearance she soon turned up her nose, 
But when I 
showed my bag of gold, she fain would be h 
talker, 
At the sight of all my money she quickly changed her note, 
Says I, I'm off, dear madam, ' tis time my name is Walker; 
Don t 
despise a 
man because he wears a 
ragged coat. 
Never trust to appearances, they often will deceive you, 
"Pis not the gaudy Peacock turns out most faithful bird, 
'Tis not your wealthy relatives stand forward to relieve you, 
„Trust not those who raise their nose, the thought is quite absurd, 
But when of tkese deceitful friends this country has a 
clearance, 
Down life's tide there's many a 
bark once more will proudly float, 
So mark my moral well, now don't trust to one's appearance, 
For there's many an honest heart beats beneath a 
ragged coat.

RAGGED PAT. 
Am: " Lather and Shave." 
Now, all you young gents to my song lend your ear ; 
'Tis about a 
poor Irishman whose name was Pat Clere: 
his clothes were all patches, and torn was his hat, 
So they called him the name of Poor Ragged Pat. 
CITORUS. 
Oh, boy, paddy awaek ! 
A cat won't catch mice if put in a 
sack. 
On Sunday at church, his coat was of black, 
With a 
big ivory button sewed into its back, • 
And his breeches were blue, the cloth very coarse, 
he'd look like a 
clown, if he sat on a 
horse. 
Oh, boy, paddy, atc. 
Now, this gent Ragged Pat, although he was poor, 
Sickness, no matter what sort he could cure: 
With a 
measure of oats, another of grass, 
lie could take away glanders from any jackass. 
Oh, boy, paddy, &e. 
Ilk eyes they were black, and his voice was so sweet, 
lie stood up for the laws, and on Friday eat meat ; 
On the Sabbath at church he'd sure shut his eyes, 
With his big mouth wide open as if catching flies. 
Oh, boy, paddy, die. 
As you gave close attention, I'll here end my song, 
Although full of pathos, yet not very long: 
In the elm' chyard of Erin far under the sod, 
Lies poor Ragged Pat, but trustful in God. 
Oh, boy, paddy,' 47c:

I 
saw her first in Chatham street, in such a 
dashing shop, 
Working Singer's No. ! At the window I 
did stop. 
By the signs that passed between us, Barnum's Museum she'd not

But she promised to meet, if I'd stand treat, when

And said: dear sir, will you take care of this icy pocketdiook ? 
So I

I 
told her not to be afraid, I'd guard it with my life, 
And thought how happy I 
would be, if she was my dear wife ! 
Then I 
heard the cry of Stop thief! and, before a 
word I 
could say, 
I 
was collard so tight, and out of my sight my girl had bolted away. 
So I 
fairly lost. &c. 
asked them what they meant by it. I 
asked them it' they knew 
-Who I 
was when they replied : I 
should rather think we do; 
For officers are we, and of nailing a 
watch you are accused, 
And beware what you say: for against you, some day, as evidence it 
may be used. 
So I

I 
told him how I

She was a

You said you loved me dearly, 
And sorra a

I

You said when we should married be, 
you'd make me quite a

But now I

It's ugly Norah Grady. 
At Phelim's wake I

Her hand with glances tinder, 
Tho' sorra a

I 
saw ye through the winder; 
Your arm you placed around her waist, 
Its little she did mind ye— 
You called her ' dear' right in her ear, 
I 
wish I'd been behind ye. 
Thady O'Flinn you vowed it thin, 
You'd make me quite a

But now I

Along with Norah Grady; 
It's sorra a

But I

On Norah so consaited, 
Why I

As if you'd been ill-trated. 
There, go your ways, yourself to plaze, 
You only need be throublin', 
Ye think there's few as fine as you 
From here away to Dublin. 
There's Pat Malone at least you'll own, 
And Mike, and Clanty Brady, 
And Barney Bourke, and Terry O'Rourke. 
I'm not in earnest, Thady. 
Now, Thady dear, come sit ye here, 
And listen awhile to razin, 
It's sorra a

Sure I

It's you're the One to throw your fun 
At ugly Norah Grady.

TEDDY O'NEALE. 
I've come to the cabin be danced his wild jigs in, 
As neat a 
mud palace as ever was seen; 
And consid'ring it served to keep poultry and pigs in, 
I'm sure it was always most elegant clean. 
But now all about it seems lonely and dreary, 
All sad and silent, no piper, no reel; 
Not even the sun, through the casement, is cheery, 
Since I 
missed the dear darling boy, Teddy O'Neale, 
I 
dreamt but last night—oh, bad luck to my dreaming 
I'd die if I 
tlumght `twould come truly to pass— 
But I 
dreamt, white tears down my pillow were streaming. 
That Teddy was courtin' another fair lass ; 
Oh ! didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing, 
The grief of that thought was too deep to conceal ; 
Mv mother cried—" NoraIt, child, what is your ailing?" 
And all I 
could utter was—" Teddy O'Nealc." 
Shall I 
never forget when the big ship was ready, 
And the moment was come when my love must depart t 
How I 
sobbed like a 
spalpean, " GOod-by to you Teddy," 
With drops on my cheek an8 -4 
stone at my heart. 
He says 'tis to better his fortune he's roving, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel 
If I 
saw him come back to me, honest and loving,-
Still poor, but my own darling, Teddy O'Neale.

AN ORIGINAL SONG. 
You have heard of Teddy Regan, 
How he won his Winnie fair, 
And her fortune, fifty guineas. 
Set them up in business rare. 
For they crossed the briny ocean 
To deal out the whiskey swate 
At the famed hotel d'Irish 
Down in lovely Baxter state.

Fal de ral de ral de ra; 
Fat de ml de mai de rady;

Things kept working brave and hearty— 
Proving money makes the limn— 
'Till the Dimycrathie party 
Put Ted up for alderman. 
Misther Regan felt the honor 
With a

And resolved to give a

When it came election night.

With the strongest kinds of welcomes

For throughout that lovely section

Word after word, I

Yet strange it seems to me,

THE WORN OUT SAILOR. 
One Summer's eve, as labor was o'er. 
And the birds were singing gaily, 
A poor old Tar, worn out with age, 
Came through our village begging, 
I 
pitied his sad mournful tale, 
Of pity I'm no railer: 
I 
pray you bestow your charity on me, 
I'm a 
poor worn out sailor. 
Despise not my hull, I 
pray, you don't 
Because I've shabby rigging. 
If I 
had my limbs, I'd rather work 
Than I'd be seen a 
begging; 
I 
am like a 
ship distressed at sea, 
Without a 
friend to hail her ; 
I 
pray, you, bestow your charity on me, 
I'm a 
poor old worn out sailor. 
When false reports came home that I 
was dead, 
My poor wife died broken hearted; 
My daughter roamed I 
know not where, 
And forever we were parted ; 
I 
was shipwrecked of all I 
held most dear: 
Poor girl, I 
often wail her; 
If I 
could find her, she would comfort me, 
I'm a 
poor old worn out sailor. 
As he sang his mournful song, 
A 
female gaz'd upon lnin ; 
She burst in tears so 
wild, 
And sank upon his boo' 
Oh father! she cried, ( for 
Whose duty ne'er had f:‘ 
Oh, come you home and Ii 
You're a

Although you're poor an

MANTLE SO GREEN. 
As I 
went a 
walking, one evening in June, 
To view the fair fields and meadows so green, 
I 
spied a 
young damsel, she appeared like a 
queen, 
With her costly line robes, and her mantle so green ! 
I 
stood in amaze—I 
was struck with surprise— 
I 
thought her an angel that f( ,11 from the skies— 
ller oyes like the diamond. her cheeks like the rose ; 
She is one of the fairest that nature composed. 
Said I: Pretty fair maid, if von come with me, 
We will join in wedlock, and married we'll be ; 
I'll dress you in rich attire, and you 11 appear like a 
Queen, 
With your costly tine robes and your mantle so green ! 
She answered me. Young man, you must be refused, 
For [ 11 wed with no man, you must me excuse; 
The green hills I'll wander, to shun all men's view, 
For the lad that I 
love, lies in famed Waterloo. 
Since you are not married, tell me your love's name; 
I 
have been in battle, I 
might have known the same. 
Draw near to my garment, and there you will see 
ills name embroidered on my mantle so green! 
:! 4 
On the raising of her mantle, it's there I 
behold 
ills name and his sirname„ in letters of gold !— 
Young William. O'Rielly appeared in' my view ; 
lIe wa.s my chief comrade in famed Waterloo. 
We fought so victorious, where bullets did fly, 
And in the field of Norvon, your true love does lie. 
'We fought for three days to the fourth afternoon ; 
lie received his death stunbons on the 18th of Juno.

They had Nobles to attend them on their wedding day.

WATERFORD BOYS. 
AIR :—" The Flaming O'Flannigans." 
Well, boys, for divarsion, we all met together; 
1'11 tell you how from Waterford hither I 
came ; 
I 
left that dear city in dark, gloomy weather, 
111v heart it was light, and my pockets the same. 
1 
lilted a 
song as I 
tripped it along; 
By the road-side a 
tavern I 
happened to spy, 
And, as I 
was meltin', my pockets I 
felt in 
For the price of a 
drink; I 
was mortally dry. 
But we are the boys for fun, wit, and element, 
Drinking, and dancing, and all other joys, 
Ructions, destruction, divarsion, and devilment ; 
Who can compare with the Waterford Boys 
In the tavern I 
strolled, out the landlord he rolled ; 
Good mornin', says he. 
Says I: If you please, 
Could you shake me a 
bed, but first bring some bread, • 
With a 
bottle of porter - 
small lump of cheese ? 
For, times they are cf 
If you cannot get r: 
Says the landlord: Ybli. 
So, I 
rolled up my sleeve, 
Provisions are dear;

Soon under the clothes I 
was tryingv!;,,

But first popped in my toes, and then popped out the light. 
Not long was I 
sleeping, I 
heard something creeping,' 
And meandering, and scratching about the bed-post.

WATERFORD BOYS.---[coscuunEn.] 
My breath I 
suspended, but the noise never ended: 
Thinks I: ye have mighty long claws for a 
ghost ! 
We are the boys, Arc. 
The row it commences: near out of my senses, 
I 
ventured to peep from beneath the bed-clothes. 
Milla 'norther ! what's that ? 'Twas a 
big black jack rat., 
With a 
leap from the floor, came a 
top of my nose. 
Divil swape ye ! says I, for a 
scheming °old vagabone ; 
Take that, and that. 
I 
jumped on the floor; 
Oh I 
Moses; blue fire, Biddy ! Sophia ! 
The rats they are eating me up by the score ! 
We are the boys, &e. 
The landlord affrightened, he then brought a 
light in. 
Says I: I'm near dead, it's time I'm away; 
Says he: Before going, I'd have ye be knowing, 
For supper and bed you've five shillings to pay. 
Five shillings! for what ? Now, don't be disgracing 
Yourself as a 
rogue, says I, if you please; 
When I 
can't sleep for rats, yor',-e the divil's own face on ye, 
To charge me five shillingg 
bread and cheese ! 
re are the boys, tke. 
Says he: Och ! 
eiy would leave me, 
They ruin m3 
irth a

Says I: The fivecjj- 'ould you forgive me, 
If I 
tell you filet;

I 
will—Says I: The

invite them, 
And plain bread ant",i-

Don't mind if they're4illing, but charge them five shillings, 
Bad luck to the rat that 
ever see more ! 
We are the boys, & e.

WEE-HAW-KEN. 
On a 
Monday afternoon in the latter part of June, 
I 
got on board the ferry- boat for Wee-haw-ken ; 
As my eyes I 
chanced to raise, a 
lady met my gaze, 
She was crowded in the cabin ' mongst a 
lot of men; 
In her hands she had a 
bouquet, and she wore a 
jockey-hat, 
And she gave me such a 
look—oh, how my heart went pit-a 
CHORUS. 
She'd a 
gingham umbrella. 
Tier name was Isabella, 
And her father kept a 
barber's snop at Wediaw-ken. 
I 
rushed to her side, and I 
proffered my assistance— 
Oh, the smile she gave me, as I 
offered her a 
seat! 
I 
sat down beside her, and, as she made no resistance, 
We talked of the weather, the- rain, and the heat. 
I 
asked her of her parents, I 
asked her her trade, 
She was " bossinv in a 
bonnet-shop, and sold them ready made. 
Then she raised her umbrella— 
Said " My naj-Ak. 
And my father Lw 
Before we parted, shrq

When I

And her gingham umbrella, 
And her father's little barber-shop at We-haw-ken.

WEE-HAW-KEN.—[CONCLUDED] 
When you hear the sequel, you'll say it has no equal 
In all the annals of woman's deceit, 
I 
went one night for to meet my Isabella, 
But no Isabella was there to meet: 
I 
searched far and wide, till I 
happened to drop 
In a 
lager bier garden, where they had a 
sort of " hop." 
Oh, there was Isabella 
With a 
ginger whiskered fellow, 
1)oing " double shuffles" at Wee-haw-ken. 
I 
staggered with surprise, then exclaimed—" 
Do I 
look like a 
fool? do you take me for a 
flat?" 
She coolly replied. " Well, I 
rather think I 
do; 
And if you don't like it, take it out of that." 
I 
rushed at my 
rival, satisfaction to get, 
But found that my troubles had not ended yet. 
For up jumped Isabella, 
-With her gingham umbrella, 
And let me have it on ,the nc

Ja,-

So a 
fig for Isabella - 
And her gingham umbrella. 
And her father's little barber-shop at Wee-haw-ken. 
So my Kathleen, you're going to leave inc 
All alone by myself in this place, 
But I'm sure you will never deceive me, 
Oh, no, ff there's truth in that face. 
Though England's a 
beautiful city, 
Full of illigant boys, oh, what then— 
You wouldn't forget your poor Terence, 
You'll come back to old Ireland again. 
Och, those English deceivers by nature 
Though may be you'd think them sincere, 
They'll say you're a 
sweet charming creature, 
But don't von believe them, my dear; • 
No, Kathleen, agra ! don't be minding 
The flattering speeches they'd make, 
Just tell them a 
poor lad in Ireland 
is breaking his heart for your sake. 
It's a 
folly to keep you from going, 
Though, faith, it' s a 
m i
ghty hard case— 
For, Kathleen, you know there's no knowing, 
When next I 
shall see your sweet face; 
And when you come back to me, Kathleen, 
None the better will I 
be off, then— 
You'll be speaking such beautiful English, 
Sure, I 
won't know my Kathleen again. 
Ali, now, where's the need of this hurry, 
Don't flutter me so in this way-
