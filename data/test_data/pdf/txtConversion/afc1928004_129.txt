HIS HEART WAS TRUE TO POLL. 
Ant:—" 
In 1869." 
I 
heard my aunt once sing a 
chant, 
Which now iirsaps isn't new, 
Of Billy Kidd, who, whatever he did, 
To his Poll was always true. 
He sailed away in a 
gallant ship 
From the pretty port of jovial Bristol, 
And the last words as he uttered, 
While his hankerehee he fluttered, 
Were " My heart is true to Poll." 
CHORUS. 
My heart is true to Poll, (
bu,sinees) 
No matter what you do, 
If your heart is ever true, 
And his heart was true to Poll. 
They were wrecked. 
William, to shore he swam, 
And he looked about for an inn, 
When a 
noble savage lady, of a 
color rather shady, 
Caine up, with a 
cheerful grin; 
Says she, " Marry me, and a 
king you'll be, 
And in a 
palace loll, 
Or they'll eat you like aft/et ;" 
So he gave his hand, did Billy, 
But his heart was true to Poll. 
My heart is true to Poll, dm 
So William Ridd a 
happy life led 
As the King of Kikaroos. 
He had nothing but a 
hat upon his head, 
And a 
pair of over-shoes. 
They made him a 
present of twenty wives, 
Which their beauties I 
cannot now extol; 
But one day they all revolted, 
So he back to Bristol bolted, 
For his heart was true to Poll. 
My heart is true to Poll, Ste. (Dance.) 
MY LOVE HE IS A SAILLEUR BOY. 
My love he is a 
sailleur boy, so gallant and bold, 
lie's as tall as a 
flag-staff, scarcely nineteen years old, 
For to cruise around this wild world he has left his own dear, 
And my heart it is a 
busting because he isn't here. 
CHORUS. 
For his spirit was tre-men-du-ous, 
And fierce to behold, 
In a 
young man bred a 
carpentier. 
Only nineteen years old. 
Ills parients, they bounded him for to be a 
capentier. 
But a 
sea- faring life lie did very much prefer— 
For his spirit was tre-men-du-ous and fierce to behold 
in a 
young man bred a 
carpenlier, only nineteen years old. 
For his spirit, &c. 
My buss= it is a 
tossing just like the rolling sea, 
For fear that his affections don't still point to me; 
For a 
sweetheart can be found in each port I 
am told, 
Especially for a 
young man only nineteen years old. 
For his spirit, & c. 
And it's 0 
for my lover I 
grieve and repine, 
For fear that this young man can never be mine— 
All the wealth of the Indies in silver and gold 
I 
would , lye for my eailleur boy, only nineteen yeurs old. 
For his spirit, &c. 
ROLLICKING 'ROVING BARNEY. 
Composed and sung by JERRY Gomm 
They call me the rollicking Barney, I 
delight to danceand sing, 
I'm full of the divil -and blarney, and all that sort of thing, 
Just watch my graceful motion, as Imovenpon the floor,

I've traveled this world all over, to stop I 
don't know how,

THE IRISHMAN AND THE JEW. 
By JERRY COHAX. 
Of a 
hod carrier once I 
heard a 
story, 
tie was climbing a 
ladder in the height of glory, 
But just as Faddy had got to the top 
A German Jew pedler near the ladder did stop, 
When some bricks dropped -out of the Irishman's hod, 
And struck Mr. Jew right straight on the nob. 
The pedler had on :a 
new -silk hat, and of course he was madas 
the devil at Pat, 
lie looked at the Irishman and -he said: " What for you try to 
break mine head ?" 
Pat loo'ked ,down from his-perch and he said: " Ivish to the Lord 
I'd broke your head, 
Or smashed the big .nose on your face, you son of .
fit lying thiev-
ing race, 
You dirty, wandering thief of a 
Sew, 
But for your forefathers, the likes of .you, 
The blessed Savior so they tell 
Would be alive thi.4 day and doing well.'

THE itACTIRICAN GIRL 
Our hearts are with our native land, 
Our song is for her glory ; 
her warriors' wreath is in our hand 
Our lips breathe out her story. 
Her lofty hills and valleys green, 
Are shIning bright before us, 
And like a 
rainbow sign is seen 
Her proud flag waving o'er us. 
And there are smiles upon our lips 
For those who meet, her foemen, 
For glory's star knows no eclipse, 
Whea smiled unou by women. 
For those who brave the mighty deep. 
And scorn the threat of danger, 
We've smiles to cheer—and tears to weep 
For every ocean ranger. 
Our hearts are with our native land, 
Our songs are for her freedom; 
Our prayers are for the gallant band 
Who strike where honor leads them 
We love the taintless air we breathe 
'Tis freedom's endless power, 
We'll twine for him an endless wreath 
Who scorns a 
tyrant's power. 
They tell of France's beauties fair, 
Of Italy's proud daughters ; 
Of Scotland's lasses—England's fair, 
And nymphs of Shannon's waters. 
We need not boast their haughty charms,. 
Though lords around them hover, 
Our glory lies in freedom's anus, 
A freeman for a 
lover.

A very sweet girl, with a 
pair of nice doves, 
Thro' the village came tripping along; 
She petted and played with their beautiful wings, 
And her voice was like a 
sweet song. 
wished to caress them there all in my turn. 
Ah I 
near me her blushing cheeks, how they burn! 
Ahl ah I 
the birds were the emblems of love— 
Of the beautiful Cupid!

This very sweet girl in my hand laid the doyen, 
Then she gaily went tripping away I 
O'er valletv

have wandered in vain, 
For we never have met since that day! 
I 
dream of her now in her loveliness, 
But never my life will she come to bless!

a 
lesson it taught me, alas! 
That young Cupid has pinions; 
I've learned this, alas! 
Love he flies, love be flies, be flies away! 
41.H.1, LETTER PROM OVER THE SEA. 
As Nelly one morning was thinking of days gone away, 
To the heat of her heart and her spinning, 
She warbled this sweet little, bright little lay, 
The notes to her lips sweetly springing; 
`‘ He told me he neer loved another, 
lie called m Mavourneen Machree, 
But au ! sure he's with me no longer, 
Fur he is gone over the sea. 
But au I 
sure he is with, elle. 
"'Tis long, very long since he left me, 
And oh 
they would make my 'heart sore. 
'They said amt. his Culeen forgetting, 
He'd wed, and I'd see `him no more. 
But still in my bosom a 
whisper, 
Tho' they chatted an very free, 
Told honor and love would be sending 
A 
letter from over the sea. 
Told honor and love, hc. 
'Last night in a 
beautiful vision, 
A 
robin flew round where I 
lay, 
And a 
voice chirruped over my pillow, 
" 
Oh, come to your Willie away." 
I 
awoke and beheld it was morning, 
The sun shone on fallow and lea, 
And I 
got—oh—how my heart flutteredl— 
A 
letter from over the sea. 
And I 
got, oh hew tt7c. 
Impressed on the seal e'er I 
broke it, 
Two hearts in a 
ribbon were bound, 
When I 
kissed it and opened it swiftly, 
Where a 
bonnie bright charm I 
found, 
Its name Ill not mention to any, 
But some one is watching for me, 
Oh, waft ye winds till I

Walk up now, this is no humbug, 
Everything you here shall see! 
You may judge by all the pictures 
That you will not humbugged be; 
First is Eve along with Adam, 
And the snake and apple, too, 
Then we've William Tell and son, 
And both of them as good as new 
Here you see the Queen Artemis, 
'Weeping tears like white sea-foaux 
Close beside the Doge of Venice, 
'Neath his proud palatial dome I. 
Then the belle who set, you know, 
Old Holifernes sadly wild, 
For he lost his head in love 
And acted like a 
silly child! 
Here we copy all from nature, 
And you'll find it very fine; 
Ugulina then we have, 
Who ate his children, eight or nine I 
Last we have the wonder fair that 
Makes Dame Nature quite despond; 
'Tis the lovely, perfect Princess, 
Fair Princess of Trebizond ! 
This way, gentlemen and ladies, 
Come and see the splendid show, 
This way, gentlemen and ladies, 
Come and see the splendid show 
This way, this way, this way, this way, this way, this way, 
This way pass here, pass here, pass here, pass here, pass here; 
pass here ! 
This way 1

THE SEAMAN'S HONE.

you, whose lives on land are pass'd, 
And keep from dangerous seas aloof; 
Who careless listen to the blast, 
Or beating rains upon the roof; 
You little heed how seamen fare— 
Condemu'd the angry storm to bear. 
Sometimes while breakers vex the tide, 
He takes his station on the deck; 
And now, lasted o'er the vessel's side, 
He clears away the cumb'ring wreck; 
Yet, while the billows o'er him foam, 
The ocean is his only home! 
Still fresher blows the midnight gale 
" 
All hands reef top-sails," are the cries, 
And, while the clouds the heavens vail, 
Aloft to reef the sails he flies. 
Still while the waves around him comb, 
The ocean is the seaman's home. 
A SOLDIER TO-NIGHT IS OUR GUEST. 
Fan, fan the gay hearth, and fling back the barr'd door, 
Strew, strew the fresh rushes around on the floor, 
And blithe be the welcome in every breast, 
Fr a 
soldier—a 
soldier to-night is our guest. 
Al) honor to him, who, when danger afar 
Had lighted for ruin his ominous star, 
Left pleasures and country, and kindred behind, 
And sped to the shock on the wings of the wind. 
If you value the blessings that shine at our hearth— 
The wife's smiling welcome, the infant's sweet mirth— 
While they charm us at eve, let us think upon those 
Who have bought with their blood, our domestic repose. 
Then share with a 
soldier your hearth and your home, 
And warm be your greeting whene'er he shall come ; 
Let love light a 
welcome in every breast, 
For a 
soldier—a 
soldier to-night is our guest.

There's a

Wait a

The pen shall supersede the sword, 
And right, not might, shall be the lord, 
In the good time coming; 
Worth, not birth, shall rule mankind, 
And be acknowledged stronger, 
The proper impulse has been given, 
Wait a 
little longer. 
There's a 
good time coining, boys, 
A good time coming, 
There's a 
good time coming, boys, 
Wait a

look both fair and bright? 
Silks all this pretty form enclosing: 
Smiles—how they follow me each night!

By all the crowd am I 
adored! 
The public cheer when I 
appear, 
While I 
make my fantastic pose 1 
Their kindly smile, their kindly smile 
Dwells in my fond heart forever. 
Hearts I

Here I'm a

Vows—silly men are always dinning; 
Vows—till my ears are weary grown 1 
Beaux on a " string" I'm always getting!

THE DAYS WHEN WE WENT GIPSYING. 
In the days when we went gipsying, 
A 
long time ago, 
The lads and lassies in their best, 
Were dressed from top to toe. 
We danced and sung the joyful strain, 
Upon the forest green, 
And nought but mirth and jollity 
Around us could be seen. 
C11011173. 
And thus we passed the pleasant time, 
Nor thought of care or woe. 
In the days when we went gipsying 
A 
long time ago. 
All hearts were light, and eyes were bright, 
While inture's face was gay, 
The trees their leafy branches spread, 
And perfume filled sweet May. 
'Twas there we heard the cuckoo's note, 
Steal softly through the air, 
While every scene around us look'd 
More beautiful and fair. 
And thus we passed, &e. 
We filled a 
glass to every lass, 
And friends we loved most dear— 
We wished them many a 
happy day 
And many a 
happy year. 
To friends away we turned our thoughts, 
With feelings kind and tree, 
And oh, we wisli'd them with us there 
Beneath the forest tree.

I'LL GO AND ENLIST FOR A SAILOR. 
List

pray, 
And when you've heard it all, you'll say 
That I'm " an unfortunate tailor." 
I 
once was as happy as a 
bird on a 
tree, 
My Sarah was all the world to me, 
But I'm cut out by a 
son of the sea. 
She has left me here to bewail her. 
CHORUS

why dill my Sarah serve me so? 
No more will I 
stitch, no more will I 
sew

M y 
Sarah was the daughter of a 
publican, 
A gen'rous, hind, good sort of a 
man, 
Who spoke very plain what he thought of a 
man, 
But he never look'd cross at the tailor ; 
My Sarah was as tall as a 
poplar tree, 
As fair as a 
lily, and as brisk as a 
bee, 
And many were the smiles that she smiled on me, 
Oh I 
why am I 
left to bewail her ? 
Oh ! why did, &c. 
My days were happy, and my nights the same, 
'Till a 
man named Cobb, from the ocean came, 
With a 
big black beard and a 
muscular frame, 
A captain on board of a 
whaler ; 
Be spent his money so frank and free, 
With his tales of the land, and his songs of the sea, 
He stole my Sarah's heart from me, 
And blighted the hopes of the tailor ! 
Oh why did, &c. 
I 
went to plead but she did refuses 
She lov'd another, so I 
must excuse 
Her candor, but it was no use, 
She never could marry a 
tailor 1 
When telling ray love in came that Cobb, 
Who cried, " avast there, you lubberly swab 1 
If you don't belay, Ill Pcuttle your nob,"

Old Brown's girl. 
Old Brown, now, he sells very nearly 
Everything you'd please: 
Treacle, soap, and bundles of wood, 
Lollypops and cheese. 
His daughter minds the shop, 
It's a 
treat to see her serve; 
I'd like to run away with her, 
But I 
haven't got the nerve.—Cnoaus. 
Poor old Brown he's very often 
Troubled with the gout, 
He " grumbles" in the little parlor, 
When he can't get out. 
Then I 
go and make a 
purchase, 
Oh, and when she hands the change, 
That gal makes me feel gal-vanized, 
I 
feels so very strange.—Cnoaus. 
Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly, 
When I 
says a 
tender word, 
But old Brown says that she shall wed 
A 
marquis or a 
lord; 
But I 
don't think as ever 
One of them swells I 
shall be— 
But, by jingo! next election 
shall put up for M.P. 
Spoken—I 
shall then get in the House of Commons, which is 
only next door to the Lords. " Who'll vote for Seroggings I"— 
" 
Serogging,s for Spitalfields!"—" Seroggings for ever !"—" Scrog-

think 
I'd stand a 
chance anyhow, I 
shouldn't be the only muff in the

should be the happy owner of—Cnoaus.

THE BROADWAY SWELL AND THE BROOKLYN 
BELLE. 
I 
guess you'll wonder to see me, 
A walking down the street, 
I 
would not do so, hut I 
hope 
A nice young girl to meet. 
In a 
buggy through the town I 
drive, 
That you must know full well, 
And New York City could not thrive, 
Without this Broadway swell. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I'm a 
swell, you all know well, 
The figure bead of this young swell, 
If you don't know, the folks will tell 
That I 
am called the Broadwey c
jvall 
She—From Brooklyn I 
have just come o'er, 
A 
nice young man to see, 
I 
met hitn at the Central Park, 
And he vowed that he loved me. 
I 
guess that you know him well enough, 
For he's called the Broadway swell, 
And I 
am known by all the folks, 
As the handsome Brooklyn belle. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I'm a 
belle, and you I 
tell, 
I 
dearly love this Broadway swell. 
He is such a 
swell, and in love fell 
With me the Brooklyn belle.

Won't harm you, never fear.

BATHING. 
One quiet afternoon in the latter part of June, 
My employer said, "James, I'll dispense with 
Your service, from to-day, for a 
fortnight go away; 
Here's a ' fifty' for defraying the expense with. 
how nice it is to go, just for aweek or su, 
From town to ease the mind from toil and slaving; 
Along the hills to scramble, and in the waters gambol, 
To enjoy a 
little clean and wholesome bathing. 
I 
was a 
single man, and my sweetheart, Mary Ann, 
In the country lived ( the daughter of a 
fanner); 
So, natural enough, next morning with a 
puff. 
I 
was soon locked in the embrace of my charmer. 
She met at the train, and how can I 
explain 
My ecstacy or how I 
was behaving. 
But I, kissing, went away, when I 
heard an old, man say, 
"To cool his love he'd better try some bathing." 
So, next morning I 
arose, and the weather being close, 
Determined on dipping in the river. 
So I 
told the servant maid that I 
going was to bathe, 
And at eight o'oclock I'd be returning thither. 
Two hundred yards I 
swam from the spot where I 
began, 
To an island, when for breath I 
almost craving, 
From the water up arose, turned round to find my clothes, 
But all had disappeared while I 
was bathing. 
I 
shaking was like leaves when I 
saw the nasty thieves, 
I 
shouted out, " You sacrilegious wretches, 
Take my coat, [fly boots and hat, satin vest and silk cravat 
But for decency do bring me back my breeches. 
But all was no avail, they were off and in full sail, 
Not e'en a 
pair of socks could I 
be saving. 
When, my troubles on to force, in a 
boat a 
gent across 
Pulled two ladies to the spot where I 
was bathing. 
[1] 
BATHING. [CONCLUDED.] 
Oh, judge of my surprise, I 
could scarce believe my eyes, 
When I 
saw that one was Mary, my intended. 
I 
was dumb, I 
had no choice; if I 
spoke she'd know my voice, 
And look a 
thing that ought to be prevented. 
So I 
dodged around the isle, till a 
quarter of a 
mile 
Stood between me and the boat, I 
almost raving. 
When, agreeable to view, and by chant() most lucky too, 
I 
saw another individual come bathing. 
I 
soliloqui-ed, "Here goes, I 
must have a 
snit of clothes, 
Or they'll raise a ' hue and cry' for Mary's lover;' 
So in I 
plunged once more, and swam towards the shore, 
And took his, for one good turn deserves another. 
Ile saw me in the fact. and I 
scarce knew how to act 
To get out of the dilemma I 
was braving. 
So away I 
quickly ran, saying " Catch me if you can," 
But he couldn't in the state that he was bathing. 
Like a 
tiger home I 
tore, kept knocking at the door, 
The servant she refusing to admit we. 
While creating these alarms, I 
ru,lied in Mary'sarmS 
In a 
suit of corduroys that didn't fit rite. 
I 
very soon explained why I 
had been detained, 
And was laughing, though the theft was most depraving, 
When a 
man wrapt in a 
sheet and with nothing. on his feet, 
Came and asked to see the gent who'd been out bathing. 
Said Mary, " Dear, it's true, that he is wanting you, 
I 
wish I'd known what made you stay away so. 
I 
saw you all the w,,ile, you were dodging round the isle; 
But, to tell the truth, I 
ditInt like to say so." 
So the stairs I 
stumbled down, while I 
nearly broke my crown 
And apologized for rudely thus behaving. 
But now rob me if you can, for I'm since a 
married man, 
And Mary minds my clothes when I 
go bathing. 
THE CAN-CAN. 
A 
girl who lives up our Court, 
Served me as she didn't ought, 
And made of ine a 
cruel sport, 
Thon ,h 
after her I 
ran. 
She knocked my heart to smithereens, 
All for a 
chap of larger means, 
Who made Java coffee out of beans, 
While she danced the Can-Can. 
CHORUS. 
And like a 
fairy, she would glide, 
Over the stage f 
om side to side; 
While every one with pleasure cried 
how well she does the Can-Can. 
I 
used to stand at T`nion Square, 
Just to pick np odd jobs here. 
113' passion there, I 
did declare,. 
She told tne she loved me. 
I 
never thought that she would jilt, 
On wedding her my hopes were built, 
I 
boo glut the ring—ltwas silver gilt, 
And cost me one and three. 
Yet like a 
fairy, etc. 
One afterno ,,n 
with feelings gay, 
I 
to be house did go straightway 
I 
asked her for to name the day; 
But oh ! what did I 
see? 
My rival on his bonded knees, 
A giving of her hand a 
squeeze. 
I 
didn't think it quite the cheese, 
It looked so awful free. 
Yet like a 
fairy, etc. 
Said I, indignant, clear up this, 
I 
want an i.xplanation, Miss; 
But she says, and gives him such a 
kiss, 
To marry him I 
mean. 
My reasons they are various, 
-My objections to yon serious; 
Your living is precarious, 
And not like selling beans. 
Yet like a 
fairy, etc. 
Now jnst to think how things go queer, 
lie married my Sally dear ; 
She often drops a 
bitter tear, 
And wishes she was free. 
ITe, poor chap. is altered too, 
A 
lid she a 
regular tyrant grew, 
She whacks hint till he's black and blue, 
Ain't I 
glad it is'n't me? 
Yet like a 
fairy, etc. 
SPOKEN ON Trim DOMTNANT NOTE.—And it's the way with all of ' ern, 
they're like angels before they're married, but after the ceremony 
they turns out the werry—never mind, as is prov'd in my sad case, 
for I 
assure you once on a 
time that, (SING) 
Like a 
fairy she would glide, 
With a 
basket by her side, 
As ion.- the street she cried. 
"flow well I 
does the Can-Can." 
A BOLD BRAVE CREW—SONG OF THE SEA. 
A 
bold brave crew and an ocean blue, 
And a 
ship that loves the blast; 
With a 
good wind piping merrily 
In the tall and gallant mast. 
CHORUS. 
Ha! Ha! my boys, 
These are the joys, 
Of the noble and brave; 
Who love a 
life 
In the tetnpest's strife, 
And a 
home on the mountain wave. 
When driving rain of the hurricane 
Puts the light of the light- house out, 
And the growing thunder sounds its gong 
On the whirlwind's battle rout. 
Ha! Ha! do you think 
That the valiant shrink ? 
No ! 
No ! we are bold and brave 
And we love to fie-ht 
In the wild midnight, 
With the storm on the mountain wave I 
Breezes that die where the green woods sigh, 
Ti, the landsman sweet may be, 
But give to the brave the broad-backed wave, 
And the tempest's midnight glee ! 
Ha! Ha! the blast. 
And the rocking mast, 
And the sea- wind brisk and cold, 
And the thunder's jar, 
On the seas afar, 
Are the things that suit the bold. 
The timbers eroik, the sea-birds shriek: 
There's lig,litning it you blast ! 
Hard to the leeward ! mariners, 
For the storm is gathering fast! 
Ha 
Ha! to-night, 
Boys, we must fight ; 
But the winds which o'er us yell, 
Shall never scare 
The mariner 
In hi.; winged citade' 
A home on the rolling deep— 
A 
life on the boundless sea! 
Where the waters never sleep— 
A sailor's life for me 
Some dwell upon the land, 
Am] say they love its hills, 
Its grassy vales, its woods and dales, 
And its gentle murmuring rills. 
But give me the ocean's roar— 
The restless rolling sea : 
I 
love not the listless shore— 
A 
sailor's life for me I 
My foot on a 
firm set plank; 
Then let the wild wind shout— 
I 
love to sweep o'er the foaming deep, 
When the tempest king is out. 
Some love to li.st while the ladies sing, 
Amid the festive crowd— 
I 
love the music of the wind, 
As it whistles through the shroud. 
Some love to urge the courser's speed, 
Swift as the wind to flee— 
Hurrah ! for a 
ride o'er the rushing tide ! 
A 
race with the angry sea I 
Oh I 
this is the life for the brave; 
And this is the place for the free— 
A 
life on the ocean wave— 
A 
grave in the dark blue sea

Michael Bray was an armorer bold, 
In the days of chivalry, 
His hair was long, 
His limbs were strong, 
A sturdy man was he ; 
And his forge stood in the ruins 
Of an ancient monast'ry, 
And in the night, 
His fire so bright 
Threw streams of light 
O'er the paths to the ruins old, 
And the ring of his heavy hammer 
Seenid like a 
bell being tolled. 
Michael Bray was a 
jovial man, 
As armorers used to be : 
Though lowly born, 
Both night and morn 
His heart was light and free ; 
Singing, while shield or lance he =do, 
" 
Away dull care from me?' 
And oft a 
knight, 
In hauberk bright, 
On palfrey white, 
Would halt at those ruins grey; 
And recount to the armorer many a 
decd 
Done in a 
gallant fray. 
Alas I 
poor Michael I 
sad his fate, 
Though goodly man was; 
The blazing light 
From his fire so bright, 
Was dinon'd right mournfully ; 
No more his merry voice re' g 
out 
From the crumbling znonastry, 
For those ruins grey, 
From long decay, 
Footling one day, 
Buried that armorer bold : 
And through hut and hall, in the olden time 
The sorrowful tale was told. 
MINT JEMINA'S PLASTER. 
Aunt Jemima she was old, but very kind and clever, 
She had a 
notion of her own that she would marry never, 
Sloe said that she'd live in peace, and none should be her master 
She made her living day by (lay in selling of a 
plaster. 
CHORUS. 
Sheep- skin and bees'-wax made this awful plaster, 
The more you try to get it off 
The more it sticks the faster. 
Sheep-skin and bees'- wax made this awful plaster, 
The more you try to get it off, 
The more it sticks the faster. 
She load a 
sister very tall, end if she'd kept on growing, 
She might have been a 
giant now, in fact there is no knowing 
All of a 
sudden she became of her own height the master, 
And all because upon each foot Jemima put a 
plaster. 
Sheep- skin and bees'-wax, ctc. 
There was a 
thief, night and day kept robbing of the neighbors 
But none could find the rascal out with all their tricks and labors, 
She set a 
trap upon the step and caught him with a 
plaster, 
The more he tried to get away the more he stuck the faster; 
Sheep-skin and bees'- wax, tSze. 
Her neighbor load a 
Thomas eat that eat like any glutton, 
it never caught a 
mouse or rat, but stole both milk and mutton, 
To keep it home she tried her best, but ne'er could b its master 
Until she stuck it to tho floor with Aunt Jemima's plaster. 
Sheep-skin and bees'-wax, & c. 
Now if you have a 
dog or eat, a 
husband, wife or lover, 
That you would wish to keep at home, this plaster just discover, 
And if you wish to live in peace avoiding all disaster, 
Take my advice and try the strength of Aunt Jemima's plaster, 
Sheep-skin and bees'-wax,

THAT'S WHERE YOU MAKE.—[CONCLUDED.] 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
cabby, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could crawl up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
girl dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be—what some folks call—a 
cake: 
If you think your collector of taxes won't call, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
Don't imagine a 
man has no coin in his purse, 
Because he's not dress'd as a " swell," 
A book with a 
cover that's olden and worn 
Has often a 
good tale to tell. 
You'll oft see a 
swell, all collar, and cuffs 
To his finger-tips, white as snow-flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
The ladies still wear an abundance of hair, 
'Tis a 
wonder their dear necks don't break, 
But if you imagine they grow it themselves, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
When courting, don't write spooney letters 
To your fair one, for love, nor for sport, 
For should you but break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court. 
When you wed, do not marry the faufly as well, 
For that will not a 
paradise make; 
Above all, close the door to your mother-in-law, 
Or—that's where you'll make the mistake. 
But—talking of marriage—reminds me, 
We've given the Germans a 
shake: 
They fancied Louise and her cash was for them, 
That's where they made the mistake. 
Don't imagine your milk is not " doctored," 
Nor quite pure is your two-shilling tea, 
Don't imagine it's awfully jolly, 
The first time you go on the sea. 
Don't reckon your chicks before hatched, or 
Your duck may p'rhaps turn out a 
drake, 
Don't go and eat mustard, and fancy it's jam, 
Or that's where you'll make the mistake. 
With all the advice I 
have given, 
You ought to be well wide-awake, 
And should you imagine I'll sing any more, 
That's where you make the mistake.

To kiss the tide, 
That loves to press so silently,

RIGHT SIDE UP WITH CARE. 
It's if I 
had the piles of cash, I 
would not care two straws, 
Hard times would never but her me, for them I 
have no cause. 
But as it is, I 
am satisfied that money starts the mare, 
And as you see Inc here to-night, I 
am right side up with care. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, siree, yes siree, right side up with care, 
And at you see me here to-night, I 
am right side up with care. 
[Repeat. 
A 
nice young girl she courted me, she broke my heart in twain. 
I 
did not cry, nor did not die, but made it whole again. 
Her cheeks were like roses, red and curly was her hair, 
I 
did not die, oh, no, not I, I 
am right side up with care. 
Yes, siree, & c. 
Our Union was not dissolved, though traitors round us swarmed. 
Its Johnny Bull across the pond, he tried to do us harm, 
Our Starry flag is to the mast, our fathers' placed it there, 
And freedom's sons will die to keep it right side up with care. 
DARLING MINIONETTE. 
You may talk about your fascinating beauties, 
Your fashionable blondes and pretty belles; 
But the subject of my song I'm going to sing you, 
Is par excellence the queen of all the swells. 
We met, ' twas in a 
crowd and then we parted, 
The beauty of her face I 
will ne'er forget, 
As she never told her name I 
cannot tell it : 
But I 
have christened her my Darling Minionette. 
CHORUS 
She is sweeter than the flowers I 
name her after, 
And the memory of her beauty haunts me yet. 
There is a 
band of opera music in her laughter, 
You will know her she is my Darling Minionette. 
She looked at me, a 
glance was all I 
wanted, 
As I 
followed her along the crowded street, 
And my memory with her loveliness was haunted, 
As she tripped so lightly on those fairy feet. 
The second time she cast her eye upon me, 
She smiled on me and then a 
moment more, 
She rang the bell and faded from my vision, 
Then all was dull, for she was there no more. 
She is sweeter, & c. 
Next day in hopes to see my little darling, 
I 
sought the house, 'twits No. ninety four, 
When the poodle in the house commenced a 
snarling, 
And barking loudly chased me from the door, 
I 
ran along the street and he ran after, 
And with his teeth be seized my pantaloons. 
He hung on while the crowd convulsed with laughter 
Cried that's the chap that stole the silver F
,poons. 
She is sweett•r. (tc. 
GAL THAT I MET IN THE 
-DOCTOR'S SHOP. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
In New York City once there stood 
A shop well known to lame, 
And pills and squills its owner sold, 
But I 
cannot tell his name. 
Near by that shop there lived a 
maid, 
A lovely flower was she, 
A nice young chap did loved that maid, 
And that young chap was me! 
,cpoken — I 
was only a 
clerk for the doctor, but I 
had a 
soul 
above pills I I 
stood behind the counter one day and there I 
met my love. 
I 
really assure you— 
cuones. 
The first limo that I 
saw her 
I 
was her adorer, 
And sweeter to me than a 
raspberry drop 
Was the girl that I 
met at the doctor's shop. 
Susan Jane was this maiden's name, 
A lovely 
dose" was she 1 
0! lots of love I 
had for her, 
And she had the same for me. 
I 
asked her if I 
could prescribe 
To cure her beating heart, 
And then she sighed, and then I 
vowed, 
That we should iii-ver part! 
Spoken—How could I 
help it ? 
I 
kissed her once and then 
repeated the dose, for you see— 
The first time that I 
saw her, dr,c. 
The next week saw her my ,00d wife, 
Anil we're happy as can be; 
I 
know no trouble, care, or strife, 
Since she's belonged to me.

And a

GLENDY BURK. 
The Giend:,7 Burk is a

I 
can't stay here, the work's too hard, I'm gwine to leave the

I'll take my duds and tote 'ern on my back, when the Glendy

Oh, Lousianna, I'm going to leave this town,

SWEET LOVE, GOOD NIGHT TO THEE. 
The exile leaves his native land, 
With sad and tearful eye, 
He thinks upon his village home, 
And heaves a 
bitter sigh. 
But oh! he feels not half the grief, 
That now is felt by me, 
As when I 
falter out the words, 
Sweet love, good night to thee. 
The miser views his golden store, 
With joy it fills his heart, 
his sordid mind is pained to see, 
One single coin depart. 
Than let me be a 
miser. too, 
Thy smiles are geld to rue. 
Ne'er let another voice repeat, 
Sweet love, good night to thee. 
IT'S A SORT OF THING YOU READ ABOUT. 
I'm going to sing a 
little song, 
If you will list to me; 
It's not too short and not too long; 
But that you'll quickly see. 
I 
don't say my song will please you, 
Tho' your verdict. I 
don't fear ; 
In fact, its a 
sort of song you read about 
But very seldom hear. 
Now, politics are all the rage, 
And bribes are changing hands; 
On either side it's just the same 
No matter how it stands. 
I 
don't say, among politicians, 
That no honesty can he, 
And yet it's a 
sort of thing we read about, 
But very seldom see. 
Divorces are the fashion now, 
Chicago is the place 
Where, if a 
man don't like his spouse 
lie goes to charge his base. 
There are ninny wedded people, 
Who, of course, in peace agree; 
But then, it's a 
sort of thing we read about, 
But very seldom see. 
The girls arc trying hard to vote 
And wear the breeches, too; 
They're trying hard to Doctor us, 
But then, 't 
would never do. 
They would have us nurse the babies, 
And to cook and make their tea, 
But then, its a 
sort of thing we read about 
And hope we 11 never see. 
Words by GEOltGE COOPER. 
Some people say I 
am curious, 
For they know that I 
never refuse, 
No matter from whence I 
obtain it, 
In getting the latest of news. 
I 
certainly own that I 
do so. 
And no harm there is I 
opine; 
But whatever I 
hear I 
keep close, 
For of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
see lots of chaps on Broadway. 
Who are dressed in very best style, 
With a 
diamond pin stuck in their bosoms, 
With kids and the shiniest tile. 
They measure out tape h some shop, 
And their salaries tin't very fine; 
Now 
like to know how it is done, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, there's Jones, he's a 
temperance man, 
And he never will go near a 
bar, 
But his nose is as red as a 
berry, 
It shines like a 
lighthouse afar. 
He always drinks milk on a 
Sunday, 
And he says that it's wholesome and fine ; 
He's a 
friend of the late Deacon Smythe, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
know lots of married men, too, 
That are steady aml sober at home ; 
When they're out of the sight of their spouses, 
From paths which are narrow they roam. 
They drive about town iii their coaches, 
And you oft see tllem kick up a 
shine; 
To the " Personals" daile they're writing, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
There was a 
place in childhood, 
That I 
remember well, 
And there a 
voice of sweetest tone 
Bright fairy tales did tell. 
And gentle words of fond embrace 
Were given with joy to me, 
When I 
was in that happy state, 
Upon my mother's knee. 
CHORUS. 
My mother dear, my mother dear 
My gentle, gentle mother I 
When fair tales were ended, 
" 
Good night," she softly said, 
And kissed and laid me down to sleep 
Within my tiny bed; 
My mother dear, my mother dear, 
Methinks I 
yet can see, 
Her angel eyes, as close I 
knelt 
Beside my mother's knee. 
My mother dear, &e. 
In the sickness of my childhood, 
The perils of my prime, 
The sorrows of my riper years, 
The cares of every time— 
When doubts or danger weighed me down, 
Then pleading all for me, 
It was a 
fervent prover to heaven 
That bent my mother's knee. 
/ ALWAYS SAY I'M SINGLE 
Words and Music by J. 
RATCHELDER. 
Kind friends, I've found a 
secret mat 
And which I'll tell you ad about, 
The truth of it you will not doubt, 
If with the upper ten you mingle. 
You must do as I 
do, that's the way, 
And then you're sure to win the day; 
If they say, " Are you married, pray ?" 
I 
always say I'm single. 
cumus. 
Rind friends, let our voices mingle, 
Clink your glasses. let them jingle, 
For here and there, and everywhere, 
I 
always say I'm single. 
One night I 
went to a 
fancy ball, 
was asked to dance by nearly all, 
A 
girl in love with me did fall, 
Her name was Patty Pringle 
Her brother stood cigars and wine, 
Her mother said I 
danced divine, 
And in the waltz I 
cut a 
aid no, 
I 
whispered, " Love, I'm single I" 
Kind friends, etc. 
As thro' the world we onward rove 
Let's keep always on the move, 
And if it C'OnleS you fall in love, 
Be sure that you are single. 
Take no heed of care or strife, 
Be just and honest all thro' life ; 
And don't forget if you've a 
wife 
To love her as when single. 
Kind friends. etc. 
MINNIE DEAR. 
Minnie dear has left us, 
Bonnie, blithesome lass, 
And gone to rest adown the vale, 
Beneath the springing grass. 
Always kind and gentle, 
We did love her well; 
How we miss her presence 
Words can never tell. 
CHORUS. 
Minnie dear, Minnie dear, 
Bonnie, winsome lass, 
Has gone to rest down in the vale, 
Beneath the springing grass. 
Minnie loved the blossoms, 
In the fields so sweet; 
And the breezes softly 
Came her cheek to greet. 
All about the wild wood 
Ling'ring on her way, 
Did she lightly wander. 
Every sunny day. 
Minnie dear, Minnie dear, sic. 
Minnie left the blossoms 
Growing on the lea ; 
For the angels loved her 
Better far than we. 
Minnie dear has left us, 
Bonnie, blithesome lass, 
And gone to rest adown the vale 
Beneath the springing grass. 
Minnie dear, Minnie dear, ttc. 
Oh, Cupid is a 
very naughty boy, 
For with his poisoned dart, 
My tender bosom he 
Made a 
target, and you see, 
He's quite riddled my poor heart. 
But its all through a 
lazy dandy swell, 
Who just like all the men, 
Said, Marry he should. 
And I 
really thought he would, 
But he forgot to mention when. 
CHORUS. 
I 
do declare, 
It's enough to make a 
girl go mad, 
And wander all the day 
To see what he has brought me to, 
And now he's gone away. 
As I 
passed the " Grand Central" one day, 
On the step, this swell caught my view, 
He wore a 
suit, a 
check. 
And he twiddled round his neck— 
A 
glass that he couldn't see thro' 
I 
thought he was a 
general at least, 
And when he said he'd be mine, 
I 
trembled with delight 
And I 
couldn't sleep at night, 
For I 
thought what a 
chance was mine. 
I 
do declare, etc. 
Ladies all take warning from my tale 
The men do not believe, 
No matter what they say, 
You should no attention pay. 
or you'll find that they all decaim-

can't forget my wrongs

ANGELINA. 
Oh! my Sammy's gone and join'd the Volunteers, 
And now I'm unhappy as can be ; 
He leaves me every night to play at soldiers, 
When he ought to be at home here with me. 
We were as happy as the birds of Paradise; 
He wasn't in re than twenty years of age, 
And he always was so very, very nice, 
But I'll tell you now what puts me in a 
rage, 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Sam, he would be a 
soldier, 
When I 
think on't I 
can't restrain my tears. 
He once was very kind, but he's broke my peace of mind, 
Since he went and join'd the gay young volunteers. 
Oh ! Sam, he used to like his cup of tea, 
So soon as his daily work was done, 
And then, he'd make me sit upon his knee, 
O ? wasn't that a 
happy little home. 
Oh I 
Sara, he would, etc. 
But now, alas ! be never wants his tea, 
For he takes something stronger now I 
fear ; 
And when I 
want him to stay at home with me, 
He's always got to meet a 
volunteer. 
Oh I 
Sam, he would, etc. 
Foi Sam often marches home belated, 
Attention there! he bellows out to me, 
He's an awful martinet when elated ; 
He wants to come the soldier over The 
Oh I 
Saw, he would, etc. 
But I'm not agoing to stand it any longer, 
For when Sammy comes home late o' nights, 
Instead of bifng at home, a-sitting all alone, 
He'll find me maintaining " Woman's Rights." 
So, Sammy, you may now remain a 
soldier, 
And I'll dry up all niy bitter tears, 
And prove a 
woman's right to stay out as late at night 
As any of your gay, young volunteers.

GIVE A MAN A CHANCE. 
Words and Music by J. Batchelder. 
I'm tir'd of offering advice, 
So will the subject change, 
And try a 
song ot different stamp, 
A title far from strange; 
So, while I 
strive to do my best, 
At me pray take a 
glance, 
Just lend your sympathizing ears, 
And. give a 
man a 
chance. 
CHORUS. 
So always, boys, act fair and square, 
Accept what fortune grants, 
And don't be over critical. 
But give a 
man a 
chance. 
It's anything but proper, 
On a 
couple to intrude, 
To spoil a 
fellow making love, 
is very, very rude ; 
Don't interrupt their tete-a-tete, 
By making an advance, 
But walk a 
mile another way, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, etc. 
Suppose a 
fellow can't stump up 
Twenty shillings in the pound, 
Perhaps if breathing time be given, 
The needful will be found; 
Say to him, " Well, I 
il wait a 
bit," 
Think of this circumstance ; 
And if you don't press over hard, 
You give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, etc. 
My song perhaps, may not please you, 
But to do so is my aim ; 
To meet your kind approval is 
The summit of my fame ; 
But if you do not quite agree 
With what I 
now advance, 
Just be as lenient as you can, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, act fair and square, 
Accept what fortune grants, 
And don't be over critical, 
But give a 
man a 
chance.

SOME LADY'S 
LADY'S DROPPED HER CHIGNON. 
As I was walking out one day 
VI, and down the street, 
Some dear, be' % itching- beauties 
It was my luck to met. 
Then down upon the sidewalk 
A chignon caught my eye, 
I stuck it on my cane, and thus 
Addressed the passers by— 
cuonen. 
Some lady's dropped her chignon, 
A lovely head its been on : 
A charming fair has lost her hair, 
Some lady's dropped her chignon. 
I 
assure von ' tis the truth, 
As these simple words I 
said 
The hand of every lady 
Was popped up to her head. 
The swells all laughed, and seemed to think 
It wa a 
PIN' game, 
As I 
hell up the chignon, 
And I 
continued to exclaim— 
Seine lady's dropped, tie. 
I 
noticed that a 
damsel, 
Who seemed a 
little dazed, 
Rushed for wrt , d, hesitate-d; 
And on the chignon gazed. 
I'd have sworn she was the owner, 
By the flatness of her head; 
But still held up the chignon, 
And still these words I 
said— 
Some lady's dropped, et e. 
We lit tie 1:now what swindles 
Go on hehind the scenes ; 
I'll keep the chignon for her sake 
If free front gregalines. 
And tho,:e who will wear chignons, 
I'd caution, every dear, 
To see they're fixed on tightly, 
Or else perhaps they'll hear— 
Some lady's dropped, ttc.

ON AND OFF SOUNDINGS. 
This is one of those great 
lor yarns" that no one else 
knows so well how to spin, as Professor Ingraham. 
It is 
chock fall of the daring devil-may-care actions of real salt-
water tars—lads that have had the rough sou-westers tr:,-
Ing to blow them from the royal yards, many a 
time ah41 
oft. 
But the story is not all of terrific gales, and scuppeis 
running blood. 
There are passages of real tender love ad. 
ventures, such as fill with pleasure every young, pure, bon 
est heart—whether of lad or lassie—on sea or on shore.
