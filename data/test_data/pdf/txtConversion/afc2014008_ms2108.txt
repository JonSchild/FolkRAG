An e

 major c

t
 was a

whose i

Dear Bess:
 
Enclosed is a copy of the galleys  (
!)  for your article for New York
 
Folklore.
 Please  review,  correct,  and  return  at  your  earliest
 
convenience.
 (
I am hoping to spend the long Thanksgiving weekend
 
working on the issue your article will be in,  so it would be good
 
to get  your corrections before  then.)
 I think  it's  easiest  for
 
everyone if you write right on the galleys, make one photocopy for
 
your files,  and send the original back to me.
 
There definitely is a light at the end of the tunnel now,  and I
' m
 
very excited about seeing the conference papers in print.
 
With every best wish,

Dear Egle:
 
Now "Taking a Breath"  is back over to you.  Frankly,  I was
 
surprised how well  it all  read.  And although  I approached my
 
task with a mental  lecture on not doing any last-minute
 
editing unless  I just  couldn't  stand it,  I found myself quite
 
untempted until pages  8-9,  where  I have marked,  in the right
 
hand margin,  a possible cut of four lovely paragraphs that
 
seem to me might well be Just Too Much.
 
That was  last night.  This morning they don't  look too
 
obtrusive and I have mentally put them back  in.  And then  I
 
tried it with them out.  And then with them in.  Please,  dear
 
Egle,  edit me;  I don't  really care which way.  Perhaps some
 
overall problem such as the number of pages  for the issue
 
will dictate a decision -
-
 or you can tell me so.
 
Otherwise,  I have  indicated a few mis-prints along with
 
eliminating a few underlinings which looked a bit  silly in
 
print,  I thought.  Should any or all of the above be
 
indecipherable,  give me a call -
-
 703/243-2271,  and if  I am
 
not home,  my little machine will  say I will call you back,
 
and  I will.  I wish you a happy Thanksgiving and good editing.
 
Yours  ever,

Welcome  'ack from your travels!
 As requested, your paper from the
 
New York  olklore Society 50th anniversary conference was moved to
 
the head o  the queue for editorial scrutiny.
 And,  from the date
 
of this let er, you can see that very little editing was required.
 
l
,W7
'* L y
&,
 /i 2.
 
Most of my scribblings are commas and dashes which,  I hope,  would
 
help  the  reader  keep  track  of  what  is  happening  in  some  of  the
 
longer sentences.  If any of these cause problems for you,  just let
 
me know.  I try not to get too emotional about punctuation marks.
 
In your letter of 23  September to John Suter,  you mentioned that
 
you felt the last pages of your article were going off in several
 
directions,  so I was on the lookout for this symptom.  I have marked
 
two places  (p.  12 and p.  13)  where the transition is a bit abrupt,
 
but personally I don't think you need to change anything.
 If we
 
just  insert  the  three  asterisks,  as  I did  in  the  manuscript,  I
 
think it will read well.
 
The other materials in this issue of the journal will also reflect
 
an  oral  rather  than  a  literary  style--the  "Who  Inherits  the
 
Tradition" panel plus the discussion which followed, for instance--
so  too  much  editing  in  any  single  article  would  be  counter-
productive,  I think.  I am very happy with your piece as it stands
 
and feel  that  it  is ready to roll.  lf you feel  strongly that you
 
want to make a change,  a transitional  sentence located somewhere
 
around the site of the asterisks  (or apt statement earlier on saying
 
that you will share with the audience some general thoughts about
 
the status of the  field)  should be the maximum effort needed.  (
I
 
would vote to stop now,  but you have the ultimate say.)
 
At the point when you feel ready,  please send me one  final paper
 
copy along with your disk  (we use WordPerfect,  but  can translate
 
from the other programs) .
 The other manuscripts should be rolling
 
in during the month of March,  so that would be a good time for me
 
to get yours as well  (
if possible) .
 I look forward to it.
 
Best,

TAKING A BREATH

I was  indeed honored to be  invited to address the New
 
York Folklore Society on the occasion of its  fiftieth
 
anniversary.  My first visit to Manhattan as a teen ager still
 
fizzes  in my memory -
-
 waking up in Mary Elizabeth Barnicle's
 
apartment  somewhere in the west  seventies or eighties,  seeing
 
my very first  snow falling outside the window,  hearing the
 
unmistakable screech of snow shovels on the sidewalk,
 
smelling Vienna rolls heating up for breakfast.  I had never
 
seen or heard or smelt anything remotely similar in my entire
 
life,  and the whole experience hurled me out of the backwoods
 
of Austin,  Texas  (which wasn't all that backwoods,  it  just
 
wasn't New York)  into the Great City,  then the biggest and
 
most  complicated in the world.  And later on,  I found out
 
there was a whole enormous  State of New York too,  just as
 
full of beauty and mystery as the city itself.
 
So  I was  really pleased to be invited back to New York,
 
because  I' m a long-time lover of the place and the people.  I
 
thought the occasion was  interesting too.  Admittedly there
 
have been a
Ã§great number of anniversaries  lately,  starting
 
with the mind-blowing extravaganza of the national
 
Bicentennia
so nobly celebrated by the Smithsonian
 
Institution with its  summer-long Festival of American
 
Folklife.  Indeed,  there have since been so many calendrically
 
imposed observations that  some people are tending to grumble
 
rather than cheer when another anniversary comes along,
 
feeling that they are  irrelevant and unnecessary
 
interruptions.  But the calendar has  its own logic and must be
 
attended to respectfully(
 
Every now and again,  the calendar say s  we should take
 
just a moment to stop,  to do nothing except to inhale and
 
exhale,  taking in a few heady drafts of future possibilities
 
perhaps and exhaling some of the never-to-be-despised
 
detritus of past efforts.

Of course breathing is an incessant and unstoppable
 
activity -
 rather like the work of folklore. " ne could
 
parody the ancient aphorism as  follows:
 
Men work from sun to sun
 
Unless they are folklorists kn which case they
 
join with the women
 
Whose work is never done.'
' 
The comm on expression  "taking a breath," meaning to
 
pause,  actually makes  little sense,  except insofar as  it
 
implies becoming momentarily conscious of the process of
 
breathing.  In  just  such a way,  anniversaries,  which stop us
 
in our tracks,  also pull our work -
 what we are actually
 
doing -
 into our conscious minds  for a short period of
 
inspection.  So  I like anniversaries.  I think they are useful.
 
I have been asked to use this particular anniversary as
 
an occasion to comment  from the national perspective on what
 
American folklorists have been doing since  1944.  It  is a
 
rather daunting assignment.  Most people already know what has
 
been going on,  and thus everything I include is going to be
 
old news to someone.  I will simply try to put a possibly
 
different  spin on these elderly issues.
 
What have  folklorists been up to for the past half
 
century?
 First of all,  the bulk of our energies has been
 
consumed in responding with varying degrees of effectiveness
 
to an actively changing society,  one that has been notably on
 
the move:  with whole populations migrating south to north,
 
east to west and back again;  with major industries that had
 
employed thousands of people relocating themselves out of the
 
United Statesj Leaving the  folks behind;  with the virtual
 
elimination of small  farming in favor of agri-business;  and
 
with the development of an enormous  service industry which is
 
notably not centralized but  
Al

-indeed,  if I may say so,
 
slathe
,
-
evenly across the nation
o that  few communities
 
are any longer without their MacDonal
d or with their Mom's
 
Cafes.  With all these disruptive  factors and more,  it's a
 
7(
f
lk (A'
 
3
 
wonder ,there's any folklore around at all or any folklorists
 
left to tell the tale.
 
For folklore and folk arts,  however one may define them,
 
are never national.  They are local phenomena,  occasionally
 
regional;  however,  as the American population becomes ever
 
more mobile,  fewer and fewer distinctive geographic cultural
 
regions  survive.  Perhaps their place is being taken in part
 
by ethnicities.  Ethnicities  frequently show great coherence
 
and tenacity across vast distances of time and space;  so do
 
other non-geographic alliances based on religion,  gender,  ageI \ 
and the like.  The increasing strength of such groupings may
 
result  in part  from the gradual breaking down of some of the
 
smaller community or neighborhood ties.
 
But those ties don't disappear,
if ever they really do
 
without putting up a darned good fight.  For example,  one of
 
the  features of the past
 years has been an increasing
 
public concern for the general health of tradition.  In the
 
past people rarely worried about traditions,  they just
 
quietly had them or did them;  nowadays the general public is
 
often intensely and vocally concerned about the survival of
 
"those old things".
 
In partial response to public concern,  after a fifty -
year span that began with the sudden and tragic
 dismantling
 
of the New Deal,  federal action on behalf of folk traditions
 
has  resumed with the Arts and Humanities Endowments,  the
 
Library of Congress,  the Smithsonian Institution
,Ã§ nd the
 
National Park Service investing modest but plainly defensible
 
amounts of public dollars  into academic and public folklore
 
program
 Even more significant  is the plethora of activities
 
that have grown up1r
\ upported almost entirely by local moneys
 
and local enthusiasms,  from cor
i iunity festivals to the
 
proliferation of small community-based museums.
 
And even more significantly,  such major issues as
 
cultural  identity,  the enrichment of the cultural historical
 
record,  the aesthetic innovations of small groups,  and
 
similar topics  familiar to folklorists,  have become the
 
(

f
or
 
topics of choice b  writers,  film makers and composers  from
 
the  formal arts world
A folklorist didn't write -".00t
Ã§ nor
 
did the discipline of folklore contribute to its phenomenally
 
successful reception.  It was Alex Hailey,  a splendid
 
professional writer,  who put his particular genius to the  job
 
of responding to an overwhelmingly important question from an
 
American population that had believed itself bereft of
 
history and a sense of place.
 
An even larger phenomenon was the Folksong Revival of
 
the  fifties and sixties
uring which the American people from
 
coast to coast,  casting about  for a better sense of who they
 
were and where they came from,  became fascinated with the old
 
songs of the American frontier era and beyond.  The Folksong
 
Revival was a major cultural development.  It was also in
 
considerable part a quest  for reassurance by a people whose
 
insistence on rootlessness and rampant  individualism was
 
affording them ever more acute psychic pain.
 
A great many academic folklorists didn't really approve
 
of the Revival,  thinking of it as inaccurate from a scholarly
 
point of view,  oversimplified history,  a commercial take-over
 
of a particular group's cultural creations,  even a new kind
 
of fakelore.  And of course there was  some truth to all those
 
concerns.  But even folklorists who thought the Revival was a
 
fascinating new phenomenon typically did not take much of an
 
active part  in it.
 
They had quite a lot to attend to already,  for another
 
large-scale development during the past 50 years was the
 
almost daily announcement of new technologies,  each invention
 
promising wider and more accurate coverage of every possible
 
kind of human behavior.  Fifty years ago even tape recorders
 
were not yet  in wide use,  and few workers even took still
 
cameras  into the field.  This  is why it  is so rare to find
 
photographs of early folklorists doing fieldwork;  in my
 
family,  for example,  we used the camera in its primal
 
function,  for portraiture.  Everyone would line up on the
 
front porch and someone would take a family picture,  but
 
5
 
there are almost no photographs of my father,  John A.  Loma::,
 
recording or interviewing anybody.
 
World War II,  hard on the heels of the brilliant work of
 
the Farm Security Administration photography projects,
 
however,  accustomed the American public to excellent
 
photographic coverage of almost any kind of human activity.
 
The universe of recorded sound advanced light years in
 
accuracy,  scope/' nd portability during the post-
.
.war years,
 
A
 
and the capturing of motion itself moved into a world of new
 
possibilities with the development of television and
 
eventually the camcorder.
 
And how this unending stream of invention changed
 
things!  The increased use of portable recording equipment by
 
folk song collectors,  led in part by my doughty father and
 
innovative brother,  shifted the emphasis of folklore
 
scholarship from the song as a cultural artifact to the
 
performance as an event and to the performers as artists.
 
Ballad versions roared off the page via the recording,
 
bringing the humanity of the singers and the excitement of
 
the occasion with them.  One couldn't help listening,  and what
 
had been remote and intellectually exciting became immediate
 
and visceral.  And so the singers began to seem more important
 
and more interesting than the product he or she was working
 
with -
 the song.
 
As academics began to turn away from ballad traces,  so
 
too the buying public stopped piling more books of folk songs
 
on top of the piano and started record collections.  The world
 
of popular music showed exactly the same shift;  I recall
 
LUla rl
 
buying pop song word sheets at the five-and-dime every week
 
A
 /
%
-
throughout 
 the late thirties,  because I
,  like my other teen-
age friends,  wanted to learn the songs on that week's Hit
 
Parade.  I wanted to sing them myself.  But by the late 1940s,
 
stores would advertise a new Frank Sinatra or Andrews Sisters
 
record for us to listen to;  the songs on the records were
 
listed in small print.
 
I

Every new documentary invention resulted in ever more
 
relatively easily obtained and clearly recorded or pictured
 
data.  First  scholars and then archives began to fall behind
 
in the most elementary tasks of accessioning and cataloguing;
 
interviews went untranscribed,  tunes un-notated,  film )' 
(especially videotape
unedited,  often not even inspected.  Joe
 
Wilson's gentle warnin /\that God must have called more people
 
to make documentary films than to sit and look at then)
ould
 
have been equally applied to the recording of folk and
 
traditional music,  especially the new compact discs that  can
 
go on forever.
 
Even academics  found it hard to make much sense out of
 
all the accumulated piles of human creativity.  Two
 
contrastive scholarly tendencies developed,  one group
 
steadfastly continuing to increase the pool of information by
 
insisting on the inclusion of ever more sectors of the
 
population,  especially white collar and urban folks,  as well
 
as the previously under-emphasized areas of traditional
 
visual arts,  crafts,  foodways,  agricultural practice ,\ nd
 
other non-verbal genres.  The work of gathering and amassing
 
seemed never ending.
 
Still other scholars were busily announcing that the
 
great age of collecting was now over,  we had done all that
 
really,  there wasn't anything left of any real importance to
 
be  filled in,  and folklorists should now turn their attention
 
exclusively to problems of critical analysis.  This  led a
 
number of the more dissatisfied scholars down some murky
 
intellectual paths,  and a few issues of the Journal of
 
American Folklore became downright  impenetrable in their
 
language and complex theoretical postures.
 
But history kept on happening;  it never ever stops.  A
 
third movement began to take shape,  still somewhat awkwardly
 
referred to as public sector or simply public folklore.  The
 
major federal institutions -
 the Smithsonian,  the Library of
 
Congress,  and the Endowments -
 in many respects  led the way,
 
a
.
 
U
 
and during the next decade/\1 ublic folklore programs popped up
 
across the country in almost every state and territory.
 
Like most new movements,  public folklore began and still
 
continues in a half-world somewhere between suspicion and
 
hope.  Its work often appears neither scholarly enough for the
 
academics nor inclusive enough for cultural activists.
 
Certainly those folklorists who have taken jobs in this part
 
of the field continually find themselves in situations that
 
are unexpected,  disconcerting,  and fraught with both
 
possibilities and risk.  Such activists may complain of
 
burnout -
-
 and they often do -
-
 but never of boredom.  And
 
they have changed the field forever;  it will never be what it
 
was
 
For a single example out of possible hundreds,  public
 
folklorists are forever being confronted with new immigrant
 
populations that most of us have barely heard of.  Many such
 
incoming groups include(th  pArticular society's most
 
important traditional artists,  artists who have migrated here  2â€”
 
in part because of their hope that 
5 at least their art form if
 
not their entire culture 
)might come to thrive in the more
 
open artistic climate of the United States.  The American
 
dream has held out some awfully improbable future prospects
 
to the rest of the world,  and these days it's often the
 
public folklorist who is somehow supposed to know how
 
everyone's dreams can be realized.  For if your own public
 
folklorist doesn't know,  who on earth does?
 
So,  taking it all in all,  whether inside or outside
 
academia,  folklorists have certainly been busy these past
 
fifty years  just trying to cope,  to stay even with their
 
responsibilities in a chronically changing society. And
 
nowadays many folklorists seem super-busy,  running in all
 
manner of complicated and unpredictable directions,  like a
 
disturbed nest of ants that scatter every whicha;ay.  It  is
 
A
 
comforting to remember that ethologists say such random
 
behavior produces a surprisingly high survival rate per ant,
 
since unpredictability keeps a predator from successfully
 
7
 
8
 
knowing what any specific prey is going to do at any
 
particular moment.  I recommend this  strategy,  especially to
 
public folklorists.
 
And now -
-
 right on schedule and at precisely the right
 
moment,  I do believe -
-
 here comes the fiftieth anniversary
 
of the New York Folklore Society,  and,  thank heavens,
 
everyone can
 stop scattering for a minute and take a
 
collective deep breath.
 _
_
_
_
 
Overall,  folklorists are not  in bad shape,  really.  We
 
have a respectable history to work from,  a certain amount of
 
reasonably stable financial  support  from a variety of sources
 
-
 federal,  state,  private,  and academic -
 and,  most  important
 
of all,  a pretty good reputation amongst ordinary folks.  They
 
may not be up to the minute on folklore theory but they do
 
indeed know what they like.
 
In Colorado a few weeks ago somebody asked me, 'What do
 
folklorists do anyway?" And
 my Colorado folklorist colleague
 
said somewhat wearily,  "Well,  to begin with,  we spend an
 
awful lot of time telling people what  folklorists do." But
 
after the  laugh,  it didn't take either one of us more than
 
three sentences to satisfy the nice lady who had asked the
 
question;  furthermore,  she approved of our answers.  She
 
understood us quickly and she thought that what we were up to
 
was worth doing.  And really,  these days,  so do most people.
 
From the  inside,  however,  we can see that things are
 
actually quite complicated and difficult,  that what  is
 
happening in folklore,  especially public folklore,  is all
 
right -
-
 indeed fifty years ago,  it would have been
 
sensational -
-
 but not by today's  standards.
 
Our work is too often not up to the stature of our
 
material,  of our great  subject.  Our scholarly studies do not
 
seem to have reached into the hearts and minds of even other
 
academics,  much less the everyday folks we might hope would
 
thrill to them.  And as a discipline,  we are not  in the
 
mainstream,  and we ought to be,  especially in Albany and in
 
Washington,  where we have made  some strides,  but where
 
a  
 
I
 
9
 
folklore  is  still thought of as a sort of decoration -
-
 what
 
you think of after the real issues have been resolved.
 
From the point of view of the art world,  folk arts are
 
approved of and boosted and glowed over extravagantly,  but
 
they somehow never quite seem to have the stature,  the
 
dignity,  the downright  inevitability of the  "real" fine arts.
 
And from the point of view of the humanities world,  folklori
J1C
 
scholarship seems  rarely to be prominently placed in the
 
first  line of the social sciences or anywhere else.
 
j
 Ironically,  the  fashionable watchword of the day -
-
"multi-culturalism" -
-
 ought to have us  leading the whole
 
parade.  This brave term has been in trouble,  though,
 almost
 
from its  first enunciation.  It has been picked on,  hacked at,
 
misconstrued,  redefined,  overworked4
nd used to cover a
 
multitude of totally contradictory activitie
ntil the poor
 
thing is pretty close to hanging on the ropes.  But  I think we
 
ought to be careful before we  join the  folks with the tar and
 
feathers.  For once,  no matter how curiously defined,  we do
 
have a publicly accepted watchword that dares to specify
 
multi and also cultural, and I believe this  reflects an
 
awkward but widÃ¨spread generalized acceptance of the
 
outlandish and the non-popular,  as well as a kind of
 
softening,  perhaps,  of the  stony soil onto which so many
 
different kinds of people have stumbled,when they at  last
 
reached these hard-scrabble,  make-your-own-bed-and-lie-in-it,
 
speak-English-or-don't-talk shores.
 
However,  during the past
)years,\two groups of citizens
 
have been taking newly hard positions,  each very large in
 
numbers and influence,  each deeply concerned about
 
multiculturalism,  each speaking from an absolutely opposite
 
point of view.
 
-
One group repre
Ã±fs the  social  conservatives,
ho are
 
deeply troubled by their perception that the commonality of
 
the English language  is weakening in the United States,  that
 
immigration is  continuing without check,  and that the melting
 
pot principle  is no longer working.  Theirs  is a truly
 
/
 
10
 
fearsome picture of potential national dissolution and
 
deserves careful analysis and expert treatment.
 
One possibility for helping ease such fears might be to
 
consider co-opting the multi-cultural banner,  regularly and
 
calmly including in our rhetoric the fact that most of the
 
world actually speaks more than one language and still
 
remains true to
 j
.e- r own national identities,  also that many
 
Americans move comfortably in multi-cultural  settings
 
already,  speaking and eating in Yiddish happily with their
 
spouse's grandparents on weekends,  working and talking in
 
computerese at the office weekdays,
nd living in their own
 
comfortable African-American world in between.  Why not  start
 
suggesting,  again regularly,  calmly,  and comfortably,  that
 
many of us are already bi-or tri
cultural
,Ã§ nd wouldn't we
 
miss  it  if it weren't  so? Wouldn't we miss all that good
 
food,  all those great  songs,  all those  interesting stories?
 
We must remember that  folklore,  which has always deeply
 
concerned itself with both stability and change,  is in a
 
particularly strong position to help reassure those who may
 
not be so much angry as  frightened.
 
And although the  100% Americans  feel under attack these
 
days,  so does the second group -
-
 the many tribes,
 
ethnicitiesJ
nd other affiliations that are desperately
 
trying to maintain their own cultural  individualities]d(if
 
only they could be quite sure what they ar .
 Their views are
 
diametrically opposed to the conservatives /but  such
 
dis junctures are a standard state of affairs  in the American
 
body politic.  Part of our system's genius  is  its  capacity to
 
contain total opposites---
The  special angst and particular fears of these smaller
 
groups comes  from the  fact tha %\for many of them,  history is
 
carried almost entirely in the memories of their fragile
 
elders,  and without a clearly organized and articulated
 
history they tend to feel negligible,  uncounted,  weak.  Again,
 
perhaps the world of folklore might take the offensive.

In the first place,  we should always enquire  from the
 
older folks  in such groups what and where the oldest  ideas
 
and materials are.  It  is shocking how often they are
 
neglected.  These deep structures are the wellsprings  from
 
which everything else  flows,  and they must be respectfully
 
recognized and called upon.
 
I have been troubled recently by the realization that
 
the current  folklorig preoccupation with product, from
 
festivals to books to recordings to craft  sales  facilities,
 
has  clearly been spurred on by the granting process which
 
nudges  field workers to look first of all to those culture
 
bearers who are already presenting their work -
-
 local
 
orchestras that play for weddings,  story tellers who are used
 
to classrooms,  crafts workers with home-grown marketing
 
ideas.  Many busy and hard-pressed field workers thereby
 
simply never get around to the small home traditions,  to the
 
newly developing not - quite-ready-for-prime-timers,  and most
 
important of all,  to the older tradition bearers who may
 
never choose to appear in public in any form or who may need
 
a great deal of asssistance  if they decide to do so.  This
 
situation clearly needs re-examination.
 
There are other ways to help besides.  Those of us who
 
study traditional systems often have access to information
 
not easily available within the traditional group;  this  can
 
and must be corrected.  Part of our next  fifty years might
 
well be spent doing  just that -
-
 getting information back to
 
the  folks.  Culturally appropriate methods for transmission
 
and storage are often easily at hand.  When I worked in the

Folk Arts Program I was once visited by a delegation of
 
A
 
basket makers  from a particular tribe
who told me Atheir
 
principal  interest was to build a simple reference slide file
 
of all the known basket weaves and designs pertinent to their
 
tradition.  Frankly,  I was embarrassed not to have already
 
visualized such a relatively do-able project,  economical in
 
time,  money,  and effort and easily sustainable once done.

Some tribes have set up culture banks of such materials,  in
 
which new items can be deposited at will and loans taken out.
 
There is a lot of loose talk these days about power,
 
implying that folkorists bestow power upon or take it away
 
from traditional groups as though it could be Plopped on or
 
scraped off their plates like spoonfuls of mashed potatoes
 
But knowledge really is power,  and we need to think about
 
that in a much more sophisticated way than we have in the
 
past.  And we must also remember that no cultural event is
 
ever the result of another single act -
-
 there are always
 
multiple occurences that bring about and alter every event.
 
Folklorists can indeed provide useful information and
 
experiences to the organization of cultural events,  in which
 
they will inevitably be joined by other people with other
 
useful information and experiences,  the whole enterprise
 
taking place within an overall context of amazingly potent
 
outside influences,  from national media competition to local
 
police regulati on s.
 
We are always,  whether we choose to
 
recognize it or not,  part of a team.
 
We have,  however,  tended to advertije folklore,  folk
 
culture,  and folk arts studies as a source of information on
 
almost any cultural problem,  and now these brave chickens are
 
flying home to roost.  Most of us who are known as public
 
folklorists get asked unanswerable questions every day,  we
 
are thrown into ancient cultural battles without a by-your-
leave,  we are expected to have the most elegantly refined
 
opinions about literally h
f
l/reds of art
 
problems
 forms and soci a
l
 
Nobody knows all that much.  But we ought to try
 We must
 
continually educate ourselves,  we folklorists;  indeed,  we
 
must demand to be educated better.  Besides reading and
 
listening and looking,  we must continue to do basic field
 
work,  the most emotionally and intellectually exhausting and
 
rewarding work we can do.  Every field encounter can produce
 
an analytical paper,  or a contribution to a local cultural
 
13
 
event,  or an increase  in mutual understanding,  or all of the
 
above.
 
To do field work well,  we  should know more than most of
 
us  know,  and we  should have access to more  information than
 
we have.  In this computer age,  it  is unconscionable that
 
there is  still not easy access to the massive amount of data
 
that has already been organized,  for only one example,  in my
 
brothe r
 's (Alan Lomax' s/'Global Jukebox.  New cultural studies
 
appear almost daily,  but any individual's  lifespan is
 
limited.  Perhaps various academic/public teams could be
 
worked out to provide reliable but quick cultural/aesthetic
 
references as required.  The overall point is that we all must
 
continue to learn and to study.  The world is not getting any
 
simpler.
 
The great blind ballad singer of the Ozarks,
 
Mrs.  Emma Dusenberry,  once told Charles Seeger that, when she
 
was a girl
l3  she had determined that  she would learn all the
 
songs  in the world.  He asked her,  "Did you do it,  Mrs.
 
Dusenberry?" And she answered.  "No.  I had to quit.  They kept
 
on making up new ones."
 
And they always will.  And some of them will  last  into
 
the thirtieth century and some of them will be forgotten
 
before they are even sung out  loud.  Our field deals with the
 
creative depths and heights,  with the unstoppable on-
goingness of all the cultures of all the peoples in all the
 
world,  and with their  irrevocable determination to say at any
 
14
 
given point who and what they are.  It's enough to stagger
 
even the  stalwart,  sturdy,  stable,  well-grounded,  fifty-year-
old New York Folklore Society.
 
Maybe some of the previously mentioned suggestions might
 
help -
-
 proclaiming multiculturalism as a positive value,
 
providing cultural data and information to folk groups,  and
 
attending better to your own educational needs.  I hope you
 
also seek more  friends and continue to cultivate those you
 
already have.  So many folklorists
 
other and limit according to such
 
in that conversation.  But ours  is
 
enormous task;  we need allies and
 
amongst us -
-
 old ones,  new ones,
 
folk songs,  old-timers who may be
 
talk exclusively to each
 
rigid rules  just who can be
 
a small discipline with an
 
they are often already
 
avant-gardists,  singers of
 
out of fashion,  artists,
 
self-appointed scholars,  workers  in other disciplines or in
 
other parts
 
that  I came
 
people as a
 
of the body politic.  I am myself always grateful
 
into a field that addresses the work of the
 
whole,  because,  for that very reason,  we have the
 
whole of the people to work with us.
 
And so I wish the New York Folklore Society good health
 
and lots of energy.  Fifty years old is the prime of life;
 
there are glorious days ahead.  Take some really deep breaths
 
and let your minds roam over the incredible creative range of
 
the
 'tate of New York,  where so many marvelJ
us things
 
happen,  all right there for you to play and work in for the
 
next  fifty years and beyond.  What a lucky bunch you are!  I am
 
so grateful to have  shared this moment with you.
