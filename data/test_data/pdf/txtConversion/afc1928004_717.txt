This pretty little flower, which I

I 
wish to give to some one, yes, one whom I 
may trust, 
value may be smoll, t we tis dear as life, 
For she who will accept it 1 mean to make my wife. 
Her cheeks they must be red, just like the little flover, 
And she must always think of me, yes, almost ev'ry hour, 
And I 
will think of her when I 
am far away, 
And some day I'll return again to hear what he will say. 
CHORUS. 
Promise me you'll keep it, make this promise, do; 
Promise me you'll cherish it, make•your answer true. 
If this promise you

This sweet rose Ih1 give to you, my own true love, 
to-day. 
Within this rose a 
vow, of love and truth 
Lies nursed with fond devotion, from out this heart of 
mine; 
Just like the water's flow, just like the winds that blow, 
My thot's will be of thee, love, tho' in a 
foreign clime. 
In springtime when the earth, awakes with nature's 
green, 
When fragrant flowers and pretty birds may everywhere 
be seen. 
Go ramble thro' the woods; and search the green fields 
o'er, 
Not one you'll find to welcome you like this dear little 
flower.

When evening shadows gently fall, 
And the night winds murmur soft and low, 
My herrt is sad as I 
recall, 
The scenes of long ago. 
This same blue sky that bends above, 
Looked down on you and me, 
As lip to lip we breathed our love, 
But now I'm far away from thee. 
Cnoaus. 
I'm so lonely, oh, my darling, 
And the shadows gather over me, 
I'm so lonely, yes, so lonely 
I'm so lonely when away from thee. 
I 
mingle with the joyous throng, 
And feign a 
mirth I 
cannot feel, 
They little dream who hear my song, 
How much its notes conceal, 
No charm can teach me to forget, 
Her whom I 
long to see, 
With all my soul I 
love thee yet, 
Although I'm far away. 
Chorus, 
I 
Have No Home 
Oh ! how he merciless winter winds blow, 
As onward I 
tread through the " Beautiful snow, 
Asking a 
penny from each one I 
meet, 
To buy me some shoes for my little cold feet, 
No one takes pity or hears my appeal, 
God alone knows how I 
suffer and feel. 
Half starved and shivering, sadly I 
roam. 
No place to she.ter me--T 
have no home, 
CHORUS. 
Angels of Heaven, look down from the skies, 
Oh I 
go to our Father with tears in your eyes, 
And tell Him to call me I'm ready to COMA, 
Tor I 
have no home—I 
have no home. 
Father and mother now sleep in the grave, 
I 
gave to the poor all they told me to save, 
But little I 
dreamed when they came to the door, 
That I 
would be penniless homeless and poor, 
Tear drops now freeze on my colorless cheeks, 
No one seems caring.wherever I 
roam, 
What will become of me? I 
have no home, 
Chorus. 
Oh! where shall I 
go, tell me, what can I 
do, 
Is there no one to tell me what course to pursue ? 
With my little dress torn, and no shoes on my feet, 
Oh 1 
I'm htrigry and cold—must I 
die in the street. 
When my journey is over, and death calls me to go, 
Let me die in the street in the " Beautiful snow,

For you I

For you my darling one alone

And still my heart is ever true; 
Although I 
sigh in sad regret, 
Still every thought has been of you. 
Tho' smiles on other lips may beam, 
Yet you are still my heart's delight; 
And ev'ry wish and ev'ry dream 
Is still your own by day or night. 
Oh, bring me back the one I 
love, 
And give my heart the joy I 
knew; 
For like some lone and weary dove, 
My heart flies o'er the waters blue. 
Sad sighing ' till again we meet, 
And longing till you're by my side, 
With gentle smiles and kisses sweet 
Oh, wander to me o'er the tide.

And the sunlight fades away; 
While the tender g'oitining deepens 
And the golden turns to gray. 
Watching while the starlight quivers 
Brightly in the Heav'n above, 
I 
am waiting for her coming, 
Waiting, watching for my love.

Waiting while the shadows gather, 
And the sunlight fades away. 
While the tender gloaming deepens, 
And life's golden turns to gray. 
List'ning for the well known foot fall, 
And the voice whose loving tone, 
Sweetly bids me cease my waiting, 
Watching, list'ning for mine own, 
Ling'ring still among the shadows 
As they deepen on the beach, 
Hearts exchange in sacred stillness, 
Thoughfs that would be soiled by speech. 
Chorus. 
Thus in perfect love and trusting, 
Winged moments pass away, 
Till the holy star-crowned night is 
Sweet to us as golden day. 
And as tenderly the gloaming 
Gathered on the brow of day; 
God shall keep her, God shall bless her, 
When life's golden turns to gray.

Backward o'er life's troubled pathway. 
One spot of beAuty appears, 
Bathed in a 
sunshine of gladness, 
Arched with a 
rain -bow of tears. 
Dreams of my childhood come o'er me; 
Scenes of its innocent play, 
When all the world was before me, 
In the old home far away ! 
Skies they were brightest and bluest, 
Birds sang their merriest lay, 
Friends, they were kindest and truest, 
in that old home far away. 
Weary of life's heavy burdens, 
Sick with its sorrows and sins; 
Often my heart turns with longing, 
Back to the bliss that has been. 
Memory's fond bells are ringing, 
Chillies of that halcyon day 
When hope sweet siren was singing, 
In the old home far away. 
Skies they were brightest, eto,. 
Waters flow pure from their fountains, 
noses bloom fresh in the wild; 
Never on passion-stained eye-lids, 
Falls the soft sleep of the child. 
Oh ! for the dew-drops of morning, 
Sparkling on leaflet and spray, 
Type of 1 
fe's beautiful dawning, 
the old home far away. 
Skies that were brightest, etei.

Down the shady lane she goes, 
And her arms are laden 
With wood-bine and wild-rose. 
Happy little maiden, 
Sweetly, sweetly does she sing 
Like the lark above her 
Surely every living thing 
That has seen must love her. 
As she strayed and as she sang, 
happy little maiden, 
ShAlowy lane and dells among, 
With wild flowers laden, 
Chanced a 
bonny youth that way, 
For the lanes were shady, 
And the fate he met that day 
Was this little lady. 
Now in sweet lane wanderings, 
With love flowers laden, 
With her love she strays and sings 
happy little maiden.

Oh, those happy joyous moments when we wandered 
with our dearies, 
Thro . the wildwoods in the merry month of May; 
Plucking violets and daisies, and the blossoms of the 
cherries, 
Driving care and sorrow from our midst away. 
Oh, ' tis then the pleasant hours we are beguiling, 
When our laughter makes the very welkin ring, 
When all nature's like the pretty lasses smiling, 
And the birds are sweetly singing in the spring. 
CHORtra. 
To the music of the zephyrs all the boys and. girls are 
dancing. 
And pleasure, mirth and jollity is king, 
And our queen of May so gentle and exquisitely en-
trancing, 
While the birds are sweetly singing in the spring. 
Oh then give to me the gentle spring for billing and for 
cooing, 
And for copying the little turtle dove. 
Sitting cozy by the brook-side with your pretty sweet-
heart wooing, 
While you're whispering to her choicest words of love. 
Oh ' tis then her lips are pouting like the posies, 
While your arm around her slender waist you fling, 
And her blushes on her cheeks are red as roses, 
While the little birds around you sweetly sing.

Blue-eyed darling, kind and true, 
Heart of Hummer and soul of May; 
Thou art ever with me through, 
Darkest night and dreariest day. 
Strife and toil and care may come, 
Cloud and storm before 1116 rise, 
Still like stars through deepest gloom, 
Beams the light of Lying eyes, 
Eyes of blue, kind and true, 
Soft and clear as fairest skies, 
Love itself find life anew, 
In the light of loving eyes.

In the wild or by the shore, 
Loving eyes, thou art with me,

Soft and clear as fairest skies, 
Love itself finds life anew, 
In the light of loving eyes. 
Time may sprinkle gleams of snow, 
Over the sheen of golden hair, 
Age may steal the roses glow, 
From full many a 
face that's fair, 
But though cheeks grow pale, and care 
Turns to gray the locks of gold. 
One dear charm time still must spare, 
Loving eyes can ne'er grow old. 
Eyes of blue. kind and true, 
Soft and clear as the fairest skies, 
Love itself finds life anew, 
In the light of loving eyes.

To greet the blushing roses of the morn.

Oh, mother, what do they mean by blue, 
And what do they mean by gray. 
Was heard from the lips of a 
little child, 
As she bounded in from play. 
The mother's eyes filled up with tears, 
She turned to her darling fair, 
And smoothed away from the sunny brow, 
Its treasures of golden hair. 
Why, mother's eyes are blue my sweet, 
And grandpa's hair is grey, 
And the love we bear our darling child, 
Grows stronger every day; 
33ut what did they—persisted the child— 
For I 
saw two cripples to-day, 
And one of them said he fought for the blues, 
The other, he fought for the gray. 
Now, lie of the blue had lost a 
leg, 
The ether had but one arm; 
And both seemed worn and weary and sad, 
Yet their greeting was kind and warm. 
They told of battles of days gone by, 
Till it made my Y--iing blood thrill. 
The leg NtrP -1,,st in the Wilderness fight, 
And the arm on Malvern Hill. 
They sat on the stone by the farm-yard gate, 
And talked for an hour more, 
Till their eyes grew bright, and their warm hearts s

And parting at last with a

In a

Brighter gem than decks the starry

Chains of love unconscious weaving, 
Where'er her footstep trips.

LITTLE NELLY RAY. 
I 
LOVE a 
little country queen, a 
village beauty rare, 
With rosy cheeks and pearly teeth, and lovely nut-brown hair; 
Her waist it is so slender, and her feet they are so small, 
Of all the girls I 
ever loved my Nelly beats them all. 
CHORUS. 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, charming little Nell, 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, pretty little belle; 
Nelly Ray like birds ot May, singing all the day, 
I 
never had a 
sweetheart like my charming Nelly Ray. 
Her father keeps a 
farmhouse, in a 
village down in Kent, 
A 
id being on my holidays, to spend them there I 
went; 
And while a 
strolling through the fields, as on my way I 
roame4 
It's there 
met my Nelly, as she drove the cattle home. 
Nelly Ray, .ke. 
I 
took my Nelly for a 
walk, among the bright green gr&en, 
And words of love I 
whispered to this young country la" 
placed my arms around her waist, as I 
sat by her stele, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged to be my brift, 
Nelly Ray, &.4. 
And now we've named the happy day, and how happy cal 
shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or me; 
But in our farm-i4ouse we'll be happy night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the brighteet 
ray. 
Nelly Ray, At 
Massa's in the Cold Ground. 
Sung with great success by Barlow, Wilson, Primrose & West's Minstrels, 
Round de meadows am a 
ringing 
The darkies' mournful song, 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
Happy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a 
creeping 
O'er the grassy mound, 
There old massa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold ground. 
CUORUS. 
Down in the corn-field 
near that mournful sound; 
All the darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground. 
When the autumn leaves were falling, 
When the days were cold, 
'Twas hard to hear old massa calling, 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, 
Now the summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
Down in the corn-field, 8r0 
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning, for 1.e leave them behind.

We're an Irish pair and we just landed,

BRIGHT LITTLE SPOT. 
Words and Music by JOHN WALsn. The greatest Irish patriotk 
singer in America. 
We're stout-hearted boys from the green shores of Erin, 
That Emerald set in the sea; 
Where bounteous nature her best cloth appear in, 
And choicest gifts scattered free; 
Her mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Her rivers and lakes filled with life in galore; 
Loveliest scenes on all sides are surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Cnonus: 
Hurrah for that bright, little spot on the ocean. 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar; 
True Irish hearts love with fonde.-t devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Dear granuail, her daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn; 
Ever in battle her sons they arc fearless, 
Death do I 
bold but in scorn; 
Our hearts ever warm to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turn from your door; 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud, boys, to wear it. 
To it I 
will ever prove true; 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply, indeed, as I 
do; 
Di4auce or climate that bond cannot sever, 
True in our hearts all this wide wo.11 o'er; 
The latid of St. Patrick, forget it, no, never! 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore.

I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn ; 
No iivvter kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain ; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
his hair was turning gray, 
Oh, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, eta 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again.

_MY POOR HEART IS SAD WITH ITS 
DREAMING. 
As sang by the 13th Ward Glee Club. 
MY poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away. 
They say that young loves like the flowers, 
That needs tender care in its urn. 
But minelit was snatched from the bower, 
And I 
never gained one in return.

My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away. 
My sad heart recalls all the pleasure, 
Of thoughts that are all, all for thee, 
When dreaming of you, of its treasure, 
And you seemed to love none but me. 
Tho' we meet not as friends, yet I'll never, 
One kind word to thee give, 
For your cherished memory ever,

CLRTEE. 
Oh, love Is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold. 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And muses your head to swell. 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket-book as welt. 
Cams. 
Boys keep away from the gale, I 
sv, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're 0,04. 
They will bang you till you're dead, 
With bald-headed end of a 
broom. 
When man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
He talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
He spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
He finds the old saying it is true, 
Vaat a 
mole on the arm is worth two ce the leg, 
But what's be ping tor to de. 
. 
Boys keep way, et4 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half-starved kids, 
I 
tell you its no fun. 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With a 
dog and double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
Young fellows just take my advice, 
• 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
ion think you're in clover till the honey-moon's over, 
• 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
placter on her nose, 
vovil find true love don't run so very smooth, 
Whom you have to wear your second-hand clothes. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to ohm, 
You'll holler for yuur son 
'lb load upyour gun, 
Whileyou vaccinate mothelATASW. 
Tell me where my Eva's Gone. 
Sung with great success in " Uncle Tom's Cabin." 
POlished by permission rd. GEO. Mottusux, 44 Fourth street. Brooklyn. 
I 
had a 
dream, a 
happy, happy dream, 
I 
dreamt that I 
was free ; 
And in my own dear far off distant home 
I 
liv'd so fancy free ! 
CHORUS. 
Eva, Eva, Tell me where my Eva's gone, 
She has left here to sigh and to mourn, 
Can't von tell me where my Eva's gone 
And in this that seem'd a 
happy dream. 
I 
was so prcud and brave; 
And when I 
woke and found ' twas but a 
dream 
I 
found myself a 
miave I 
Eva, Eva, Scc. 
I 
long to dream that happy dream again, 
To see my home so fair; 
For now I 
roam wfwere all is sad and area, 
And life is full of care.
