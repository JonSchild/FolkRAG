As we pass Union Square.

With all in line don't we look fine 
When marching down Broadway. 
There the people all do shout and say. 
All so fine when we go on parade.

And style they can't be beat, 
You talk about excitement, 
When we go on the street 
The ladies, heaven bless them,

Whenever we go on parade, 
To see us how they run.

Say to me that you'll be true,

So far away from home.

Good-bye, Jakey, don't forsake me, 
Say to me that you'll be true, 
We have murdered, robbed and plundered, 
I'll never part from you.

You're the one led me astray, 
Now you see both you and me 
Are to be hung to-day. 
Oh, how I 
wish that I 
was home, 
Oh how sadly I 
feel, 
You will never die alone, 
Because I'll never squeal. 
Good-bye, Jakey, 
Good-bye, mother, sister, brother, 
To this world we bid adieu, 
Do not know us, but disown us, 
We throw no shade on you. 
If we had done as you advised us, 
From bad company staid away, 
Do not cry, we now must die, 
For us we hope you'll pray. 
Good-bye, Jakey, Scc,

I 
will tell you of a 
lady, 
One I 
love so well, 
Bonnets and ribbons she does sell ; 
On the' Bowery she owns a 
store, 
She has " Milliner" on the door, 
And Augustine Delia Clancey that's the belle. 
Shure it's every Sunday night, 
It is my heart's delight 
To go up Miss Clancey for to see. 
A 
grand piano she plays so fine, 
To me she is divine, 
And all those lovely songs she sings to me. 
CHORUS. 
She sings, she sings Sweet Bye and Bye, 
And go to sleep my Baby Mine. 
She sings, she sings such pretty tunes, 
The girl I 
love I'll marry soon. 
There is Owen Smith and Grady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all so fine. 
Sure Smithy has comical talk, 
And such a 
funny walk, 
Which causes all the party for to smile. 
When Miss Clancey does appear 
Such curious things you'll hear, 
" 
Miss Clancey, dear, you're looking all serene," 
She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me. 
She sings, she sings, &c.

Glides little Maggie Ann,

In all the festive glory 
Of gay flags and banners bright, 
The merry picnic barge is drifting, 
Thro' the starry night ; 
And borne across the waters 
Come sounds of music sweet, 
And merry laugh, and joyous shout, 
And pat of tripping feet, oh ! 
CHORUS. 
On the picnic barge they dance, 
In the moonlight soft they dance, 
Down the river gliding free, 
To rich music's melody ; 
'Round the deck the merry feet, 
In a 
jolly measure beat, 
Whirl and glide, as down with the tide, 
On the barge they lightly dance. 
A 
vision of rare beauty, 
Floating gently down the stream, 
Thro' plashing waters silvered 
By each brilliant moonlight beam. 
A 
time for joy and pleasure, 
For merry dance and song, 
A 
time to tell love's sweetest story, 
While we drift along. 
On the Picnic barge, & c.

What is it ? 
COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and music 
Sung with great success by 
M URPHY and AlAcx. 
It's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear about me every day; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SPOKEN—As 
soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo ? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare. 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green ! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
What is it, &c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
Pipe , 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw 
8qt abc,v 111 they wildly ask— 
What is it, & c.

Last Wednesday I 
attended 
A 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Kellys, Hogans, and O'Briens, 
All came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, 
And try and win the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play, 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
(Chorus.) 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bott,e, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

The sudden name of " Nan," 
But now her high- tuned monnygram 
Is Bidalia Jane McCann. 
CHORUS. 
Bidalia Jane McCann, the elegant Miss McCann, 
There's none so sweet as her, no girl so neat as her, 
Peggy or Julia, Johanna or Kate, like Bidalia Jane McCann, 
The elegant Miss McCann, I'm sure there's not wan, 
That can bate the bon-ton of Bidalia Jane McCann. 
Her education's wonderful, 
She spells and writes by ear, 
She plays the " Maiden's Prairie," 
And sings " Beloved Ear." 
She says, " I 
feel so fatigayed 
I 
don't know what to do," 
Says I, " Bidale, some grub and ale, 
Might help your fatigu." 
(Chorus.) 
She gives a " German" every week, 
And " Irish" too as well, 
She says a 
cork would shade my face, 
So I 
could tend the bell; 
She sings duets all by herself, 
She talks French like a 
man, 
She's very aurevoir indeed, 
Is Bedelia iitne McCann.

Hands around and round, and round, oh! what a

How the spielers prance, at the moonlight dance, of the

The " Ours" and " Yours" and other coteries, 
Together with their friends and their ladies, the daisies, 
Invited guest whose hearts are blessed with all the beer

It's skip and dip, and sachez round in glory, 
Oh, Kate asthore I

From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan, wid a.very fine eye for a 
nica 
young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A.- down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meandas he, enveloped in 
A 
braid new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A Don Juhannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
(Chorus.) 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the do ,q, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast " in " Pinafore" 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canada w 
to San Franciscu, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassday.

For fun, for sport and merriment, 
After working hard all day, 
Go down to the Battery, that's the place 
To drive dull care away. 
They have a

Where the boys and girls have a

It's better than Newport or Long Branch, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
CHORUS. 
You'd split your sides a 
laughing 
To hear Crook's Concert Band, 
The boys play concertina's, 
And the girls they look so grand; 
They dance around like fairies, 
And then commence to spark, 
It's better than Newport or Long Branch, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
You never saw such a 
happier lot 
In the course of all your life, 
Young men of twenty with their girls, 
The working man and his -wife. . 
They're happy as if they were kings and queens, 
They're bound to have a 
lark, 
Would set you wild, the music would, 
The dance at Battery Park.

When I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house, 
In Cherry street below, 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
CHORUS. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a 
wreath for thee, 
All the little children, 
Sang so sweet to me; 
Ladies came in carriages, 
With presents and boquets, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gaily did turn out; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. 
(Chorus.) 
There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Ciselmyer, 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn the old clothes buyer.

But the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride.

You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, stag the old guy.

For they yell out, you terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick. 
For they call me a

I 
went down the street, 
A 
charming young damsel 
I 
did chance to meet. 
Says I, you look charming, 
A cushla ma vick; 
Says she, go drop on yourself, 
You ould flannel mouth Mick.

When election day comes 
Shure I 
know what they'll say, 
It will be, Mr. McGinnis, 
How are you to-day ? 
They'll hand me a

Say, go vote it now, quick. 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out, &c.

MURPHY, and sung by ' VPHY

Good-evening to you, one and all, 
We ask your kind attention ; 
The subject of our song 'tis one 
To you all now we'll make mention. 
It's about a 
day that's not far away, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
The bands will play, and the fifes will play, 
As down Broadway we'll march away; 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
Now if on that day we should meet, 
We hope you won't get offended, 
For what we say and do that day 
It never was intended. 
When we march out we know what we're about, 
That's the time the boys will shout; 
And before it's night we are kicked out 
Of the barrooms in the city. 
The bands will play, 8.:c. 
We learned our marching in the war, 
We fought with George McClellan; 
We was high private in the rear, 
This is the truth we're tellirtg. 
And when we're out upon parade, 
We throw all others in the shade; 
We march along in the Fenian Brigade, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
The bands will play, &c.

The Wild Irish Rovers. 
Original, by M URPHY and M ACK. 
We've just come down here for to sing you a 
song, 
And we tell you we're not going to keep you too long; 
If you think that we are, you'll see that's where you're 
wrong, 
For we have to go home in the morning. 
My name is Tim Doolan—and my name is Pat, 
If you want to see dancing, just stand out of that; 
We're both Irish boys, from the crowns of our hats, 
And old Ireland is the land we were born in. 
CHORUS. 
:Yor we're the boys the shillelah to whack. (1reak.) 
All over Cork county, to Limerick and back, 
We're known as the wild Irish rovers. 
We traveled to Connaught, from that to Tyrone, 
And we walked all the way to the bridge of Athlone; 
Through Dublin and Kerry and Wexford alone, 
We roamed all around through the clover. 
We sailed over to France, from that into Spain, 
And we're going to America by the next train; 
So we'll bid you good-bye, but we'll come back again, 
And we'll still be the wild Irish rovers. 
For we're the boys, &c.

I'm a

name; 
I'm the talk of all the city now, it's well I 
know my fate, • 
Four dollar cigars will not be smoked when McMullen, rules 
the State. 
CHORUS. 
I'll give you my idea, that is, I'll give you some, 
Of what McMullen intends to do when he's there in Wash, 
ington. ( Repeat.) 
I'll raise the laborers' wages, politicians' I'll reduce, 
Soap and sugar I'll give away, and all kinds of produce; 
All Chinese must emigrate, and go back home again, 
And when I'm there in Washington I'll stick to Senator Blaine. 
I'll give you my idea, &c. 
No crooked men in office, stealing money from the poor, 
Politicians will have no graft, or any sinecure ; 
The world will be rejoicing, and my friends will propagate, 
And they'll all find money in the street when McMullen rules 
the State. 
I'll give you nix idea. &c. 
The Greenhorn. 
Original words and music by JoHN E. MURPHY, and sung by MURPHY 
and M ACK with great success. 
We just dropped in to see you, friends, 
And hope you are all well, 
And of our emigration 
To you we'll quickly tell. 
We left our native country 
For to cross the briny sea, 
For to try and better our fortune here 
In sweet America. 
CHORUS. 
Then we can't forget old Ireland, and the Paddies evermore, 
And the rosy Irish lasses so enchanting, 
And the merry happy dances we had upon the floor, 
When we kicked away the boards with our dancing. 
[REPEAT.] 
There's a 
land that's in this world, my boys, 
We're praying hard to see, 
And we hope it won't be very long 
Before that she is free. 
For her rivers, her hills and her valleys 
Are so beautiful and grand, 
We would like to go back home again 
To our own dear native land. 
Then we .can't forget, &c,

Written by FRANK E. 
McNisit expressly for M URPHY and M ACK, 
AIR: " 
Forget Me Not." 
Oh, I'm in lore with all the girls, 
The short, the lean, and tall, 
And I 
know that they are gone on me, 
For after me they call: 
There goes the beau ideal of man, 
I 
wish he'd come this way ; 
But I 
surprise them all, indeed, 
When this to them I 
say— 
CHORUS. 
Get thee gone, you naughty girls, 
1'11 strike you with my stick ; 
If ever I 
blow my breath on you, 
I'll make you fearful sick. 
Your mamma she won't know you 
When you go home to hash, 
So keep away from me, I 
say, 
For I'm not on the mash. 
One young girl, she loved me so, 
She wanted me to elope ; 
One hundred thousand dollars had she, 
While my poor bank was broke. 
I 
says, young lady, you must know 
That I 
love single days; 
Yourself or money I 
don't want, 
So this to her I 
says— 
Get thee gone, & c.

roars of laughter.

A 
neat and tidy widow 
By the name of Mrs. McCune 
Keeps a 
shebeen in Mott street, 
Among the neighbors she's well known, 
She sells coal, wood and candies, 
Pickles, cakes and pies, 
And keeps a 
bottle of the best, 
To sell the neighbors on the sly. 
CHORUS. 
There's all of Ryan's family, 
Muldoon and Mike McGuire, 
They smoke the widow's three-cent segars, 
And sing around the fire; 
Take a 
glass of whiskey then 
Smack their lips and say, 
We'd die for the want of a 
drink 
If the widow would move away. 
The woman come to gossip 
The price of taffy candy, 
They buy a 
box of matches then, 
Or a 
cup of the widow's brandy; 
They talk abrult, old Ireland, 
Like glue 'together they stick, 
.She has a 
sign in the window saying— 
PleAse don't ask Tor ticl.

Mary the Walker. 
'Written expressly for AltiRrhv an MACK by FRANk 1 McNisit. 
AIR: "Biddy the Ballet Girl." 
I 
am in love with a 
bouncing fat girl, 
Who is known all over creation ; 
She beats the life out of Harrigan's Mary Ann, 
Or Dr. Landis for a 
good education, 
A 
masher she is called on the street, 
In the " Black Crook " she does the statues ; 
But lately she has canceled all dates, 
And is off her nut on walking matches. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, her front name she says it is Mary, 
And she is a 
bouncing fat fairy. 
It is no use to talk, she's a 
daisy to walk, 
She has the score-board all marked with long streaks of chalk. 
As around on the track she goes creeping, 
And time to the music keeps beating, 
The men they all shout, " Give it up, you're too stout ?" 
But Mary sticks out to the finis. 
Next Monday night she starts out 
To try and beat Harriman and Ennis, 
And if they don't do better than before, 
I'm sure that their names will be Dennis. 
Next season she goes out with me, 
Then I'll be as proud as a 
lord. 
No danger of my trunk's getting stuck, 
For Alary'll walk off with the board. 
On, her front name, &c. 
I 
Married Biddy McCarthy 
• 
Composed by Ned Talbot for J. E. Murphy, of Murphy & Mack. 
I 
went down to Goerck street 
To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
met there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
And the amusement of the party, 
Says I, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
CIIORIIs. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy. 
(Repeat.) 
We danced the polka " mazourka," 
Likewise the dizzy lanciers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy, sure I 
feel afraid 
That I'll have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.) 
As I 
went home to Biddy's house 
A 
laughing, talking, chatting, 
I 
met her father at the door 
All out of breath a 
panting. 
Says he, now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party, 
Oh, yes, you honor was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
I 
am happy now, I 
have a 
cow, 
Likewise a 
pig and a 
daughter, 
I 
live in a 
cot in a 
shady spot 
Away across the water. 
My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar, 
Tier husband as well is like a 
bull, 
But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy.

Our Neighbors' Cats. 
Written by GEORGE S. 
BLAMPEY. 
Dedicated to and sung by J. E. 
M URPHY, of M URPHY and :
MACK% 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, IS80. 
Mrs. Mulligan and meself took apartments fine, 
Along the road of the elevated line ; 
'T was the other night, at tin. whin we'd both got into bed, 
That we heard a 
terrible racket right up over head; 
I 
rushed up to the roof to see what was the row, 
Whin I 
saw all of our neighbors' cats having a 
pow-wow ; 
I 
wint down to Mrs. Mulligan to have her come and see 
The greatest sight she iver saw since she left old Killkenny. 
There was Murphy's great big Tom Cat,who was as black as jet, 
Making love to Mrs. Finnegan's Puss and Miss O'Hara's Pet; 
There was Miss Fagan's pretty Maltese and Miss Malony'sTom, 
With twinty more upon the roof to have their midnight song; 
Bad luck to yez, says Mrs. Mulligan, but we'll put a 
stop to this, 
And see if our nights cannot be spent in quietude and bliss; 
So together we descended to get ready for the throng 
Of all our Neighbors' Pussy Cats, should they begin their song. 
We waited for an hour or more, and divil a 
sound did we hear, 
But a 
me'ow now and then from O'Brien's cat who lived back in 
the rear ; 
And just as me eyes were closed for the balance of the night, 
Mrs. Mulligan gave a 
yell that set me all afright 
Saying, Pat, don't you hear the cats again, 0, murther, such a 
squall, 
That I 
hardly knew, whin I 
jumped up, that i 
was myself at all, 
So to the roof we wint again, prepared to make them fly, 
Mrs. Mulligan threw the broom at them, but it struck me in 
the eye. 
0, sez I, now Mrs, Mulligan, don't be taking me for a 
cat, 
But before I 
finished the sintence,another blow knocked me flat; 
I 
thin jumped up, excited, and began to yell wid pain, 
And went for Mrs. Mulligan for not taking better aim ; 
And the cats flew in all directions as they scampered out of sight, 
But Mrs. Mulligan made me sleep upon the roof that night ; 
So I'll move me board and lodging away from these French flats, 
And go to a 
dacent place to live where the neighbors don't 
keep cats.

THE APPLE WOMAN'S LAMENT. 
A SCOTCH SONG. 
As sung by CLARA. MOORE. 
My young mon was a 
shanus born, 
A 
grand piano tuner, 
But he ran away from me one day, 
On board of Meery Schooner, 
And left me here, heart broken ; 
When I 
would rather sooner 
Have sold off my old apple stand, 
I 
had upon the corner. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, his name was Bill, a 
granite chap, 
Oh, wouldn't I 
like to find him; 
But he's o'er the sea, awa' from me, 
And the lassie left behind him. 
In his stockings he stood six foot three, 
I've a 
likeness in a 
locket, 
And a 
little piece of curly hair 
I 
cut from his whiskers, in my pocket. 
He'd made a 
clever policeman, 
But he's gone off like a 
rocket, 
And left me with my apple stand, 
Still standing on the corner. 
Oh, his name, etc. 
I'm scudding under bare poles now, 
My own sad fate bewailing, 
And thinking of the night, alas I 
We parted at the railing. 
And when he swore upon his ' bacca box, 
Before the ship was sailing, 
By his bulwarks, stanchions, jibs and booms, 
lie would be true to me. 
Oh, his name, etc.

The Man that Stole the Country. 
Written by FRANK E. 
McNisn, expressly for MURPHY and MAcx. 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun. 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A 
stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A 
whole row of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He was bred of a 
family of very bad rank, 
He stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank. 
The Elevated Road he would have got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out West and collared all tramps; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's Garden le collared the track, 
He even tried to steal Murphy and Mack, 
31 
THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY 
Continued. 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life-time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent--
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told--
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with the cast-iron jaw. 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever; 
Came to New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
He stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
la- k. 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Pao; 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all, 
Then went up and took Tammany Hall. 
Took a 
cop right off from his beat, 
Stole all the bears there were in Wall street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish, 
He took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He stole a 
house they had just finished building. 
Took Bessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
school and nipped the teacher, 
He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were playing backgammon, 
Went to the London and stole Murphy and Shannon, 
And still he was not satisfied— 
The :an that stole the country.

In a 
little cot not far from here 
There lives the girl I 
love, 
To me she is as beautiful 
As the stars that shine above. 
Nancy Green that is her name, 
Her parents they like me, 
And every Sunday afternoon 
Miss Nancy I 
go to see. 
CHORUS. 
Pretty little Nancy will you love me? 
For you know I 
love you, Nancy Green, 
I 
will love you in the morning and the evening, 
If you will only wed me, Nancy Green. 
'Twas in among the sweet grape vine 
Where first I 
met Miss Nance, 
The little birds sang sweetly, 
My heart was in a 
trance. 
I 
asked her for to marry me, 
She did not answer no, 
And on next Sunday afternoon 
We both to the church will go. 
Pretty little Nancy, &c.

Around to McGowan's dance.

Always Speak a 
Kind Word when you Can. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan & Hart's Theatre Comique, amid 
roars of applause. 
Strange sayings are the rage, on the street and on the stage, 
And many glorious maxims you will find; 
But there's one more than the rest 
Seems to linger in my breast, And very oft comes stealing 
o'ermy mind; 
I'll sing a 
song to-night of a 
motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, or to anyone that's poor, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can. 
Now there's many a 
man, who great riches does command, 
But his praises and his honors they are small ; 
But when he's dead and gone, they will speak of him and 
mourn, 
And say how good that he has been to all. 
And while upon this earth, struggling hard through life, 
No one would assist him in his plans ; 
But the stories they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can. 
The workingman to-day with his poor and scanty pay, 
Striving very hard his family to maintain ; 
While the rich they stay at home with the riches that they own, 
The poor may ask assistance all in vain. 
When humble is your lot in the wretched laborer's cot, 
Don't pass them by, but take them by the hand, 
Don't turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can. 
Flirting in the Moonlight. 
35 
acIS by T. F. CASEY, musk by CHARLES JEROME, and sung with great 
success by ELLA JEROME in the original sketch of" Comedy." 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
We pass the happy hours away, 
Where the music sounds so clear, 
Feeling happy, light and gay, 
As we smile on the fellows dear. 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, how happy we do be! (Sym.) 
Yes, yes. full of mirthful glee! (Sym.) 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
Now the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I 
could not tell; 
And making love with some one at the first sight, 
Down in a 
fairy dell. 
With our fans held close up to our eyes, 
We watch for the passing swells, 
And look abashed at the moving skies 
Down where the floweret dwells. 
Now the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I 
could not tell; 
And making love to some one at the first sight, 
Down where the flowerets dwell. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, how happy we do be! (Sym.) 
Yes, yes, full of mirthful glee! (Sym.)

Glittering Dew Drops. 
Written by Wm. E. McNutar for M ISS FANNIE BEANE. 
Music by CHAS. A. 
FULLER. 
Dedicated to my brother, GEO. A. 
BEANE, JR. 
When the dew drop in the buttercup was glistening, 
We wandered o'er the fragrant lea, 
With a 
throbbing heart I 
eagerly was listening, 
To words my lover breathed to me. 
"Believe me when I'm by your side, love, 
I 
never have a 
care, 
Will you ever be my wife and pride, love, 
My treasure rich and rare ? " 
CHORUS. 
Ever linger by my side. ( Break.) 
Never let our path deride, ( Break.) 
And when no one but the cooing doves were listening, 
He kissed me when he told his love, 
His back eyes were brighter than dew drops glistening 
On wild flowers in the grove. 
While the rising sun in all his golden splendor 
Smiled on us from the azure sky, 
Close he pressed me to his breast with kisses tender 
As at the gate we said good-bye. 
O'er and o'er I 
softly was repeating 
One little word I'd said, 
With fond love my happy heart was beating, 
I 
whispered I 
would wed. 
(Chorus) 
Sung by EMMA ROGERS, in the sketch -written for her by N ED STRAIGHT,. 
entitled: " Jealousy ; or, Two can Play at that Game." 
Where are all the words endearing 
That my darling used to say ? 
Where the tones that were so cheering ? 
Oh bring them back to me, I 
pray. 
They say that he is false to me, 
Has brought upon me deepest shame 
Vet bring him back where'er he be, 
For, oh, I 
love him all the same. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' the ocean rolls between us, 
Tho' upon his name's a 
stain, 
Tho' he languish in a 
prison, 
Still I 
love him all the same. 
When we parted in the arbor, 
Sweet to me the kiss he gave, 
As his ship sail'd from the harbor 
My heart was lonely as the grave. 
Three long and weary years have fled, 
One letter only from him came, 
"I'm coming back to you," he said, 
And oh, I 
love him all the same. 
Tho' the ocean rolls, &c. 
Sung with great success by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
What care I 
to-day for the world and its vay, 
I 
can smile when the poor they do frown ; 
Though rich I 
have grown, there's no one can say, 
The poor man I 
ever put down. 
I 
help him along when I 
find him in need, 
What more would you ask me to do— 
But it's this that I 
want to impress on your minds--
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
CHORUS. 
Though you see me to-day in this costly array, 
Who knows what I 
yet may go through ? 
So you'll find just as far as equality goes, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Last night in the street a 
poor man I 
did meet, 
Who asked me if aid I 
would give, 
I 
extended my hand at the poor man's demand. 
Yes, says I, my dear friend, you must live. 
I 
gave him assistance, he thanked me and said, 
It is hard sir, but what can I 
do ? 
Says I, my dear friend, be that as it may, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Though you see me, &c. 
In conclusion I'd state though your lot may be great, 
Don't think yourself better than all, 
But bear this in mind, for its truth you will find, 
The greatest of men sometimes fall. 
Tho' the poor man may want and the rich man may have, 
There's one thing I 
know to be true, 
Let death come a-knocking at either man's door, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Though you see me, &c.

For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernia Hall. 
Going round a 
corner, a 
gang of rowdies: 
Oh! I 
know they're rowdies for they never work, 
Says, let give this ould Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
pic-nic, boys, and toss the Turk. 
CHORUS. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter. 
But when duty calls me I 
never shirk; 
So [11 tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no pic-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh! the big ring-leader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien you had better paint the ' tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it ! " 
And he thought 'twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk; 
So T 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no pic-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Now I'm not, etc. 
Oh 1 
they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall; 
You can't go behind me, says I, now mind me, 
If you stand forenint me I 
can bate ye all. 
Thor- the gang did face me and thought to lace me, 
But I 
showed them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mercy they began to bawl. 
Spoken after 3d verse.—" Well, they looked surprised, and 
'Red Handed Mike' says, ' Who are you?' 
Well, says I, my 
name is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, and, 
moreover," 
I'm not, eta.

I 
woui.n ask of you, my darling, a 
question soft and low, 
That gives me many a 
heart-ache as the moments come and go. 
Your love I 
know is truthful, but the truest love grows cold I 
I 
tis this that I 
would ask you: will you love me when I'm old ? 
It is this that I

Life's morn will soon be waning, and its ev'nings bells be toll'd; 
Life's morn will soon be waning, and its ev'nings bells be toll'd; 
But my heart will know no sadness, if you'll love me when I'm old. 
But my heart will know no sadness, if you'll love me when I'm old. 
Down the stream of time together we are sailing side by side, 
Hoping some bright day to anchor safe beyond the surging tide. 
To- day our sky is•cloudless, but the night may clouds unfold, 
And its storms may gather round us: will you love me when 
I'm old ? 
And its storms may gather round us: will you love me when

Life's morn, etc. 
When my hair shall shame the snow-drift, and mine eyes shall 
dimmer grow, 
I 
would lean upon some loved one in tIke valley as I 
go. 
I 
would claim of you a 
promise, worth to me a 
world of gold: 
It is only this, my darling, that you'll love me when I'm

It is only this, my darling, that you'll love me when I'm

When I 
ran up the Ladder with my Hod 
Words by MASTER EDDY. 
Sung by FOSTER & DUDLEY. 
You've heard of politicians, 
With their brooms a 
sweeping streets ; 
And of the well-known policeman, 
As he walks along his beat. 
I 
never work in the Navy Yard, 
Nor do I 
dig the sod ; 
But like a 
decent, honest man, 
For my health, I 
carry the hod. 
CHORUS. 
Mike McCann, the mason, he will say— 
Scrape the mortar from your hod 
And bring your brick this way ; 
Move about when you hear me shout, 
Ten hours every day. when I 
run up 
The ladder with my hod. 
There's an Irishman called Patsy Flin, 
Who wanted me to go 
About the streets of New York, 
In the Winter. and shovel snow : 
But before I'd think of such a 
thing 
On the President I'd trod; 
I'd show him I 
was born and bred 
With my shoulder to the hod. 
Mike McCan the mason, 16c. 
Now boys, if you would like to see 
A 
rough and tumble fight, 
Call 'round to the stable 
Where I 
bum al night; 
Yon all will see that Mike McCann 
Waq raised on Irish sod ; 
I'm going to fight a 
duel 
With the man that stole my hod.

We came from dear old Ireland, 
Where the apple praties grow, 
Way over across the ocean, 
In the County of Sligo. 
We left our wives, God bless them, 
Which made our hearts feel sore, 
But now we're tired roaming around, 
So we're going home once more. 
CHORUS. 
We're going home, 
We're going home, 
For now we're tired roaming around, 
So we're going home again. 
[Repeat Chorus 
Oh, take us back to Ireland, 
Where we were bred and born, 
Way out among the shamrocks, 
So early in the morn. 
We think we see the dear ones 
Coming down the lane; 
When we get back to Erin's Isle, 
We'll never roam again. 
We're going home, &c..

We Came From Ireland. 
Written by BEN COLLINS for the W HITNEY'S. 
Oh, here we are this evening, 
An Irish pair so true, 
We're just from Tipperary, 
Across the ocean blue. 
We'll sing and dance to please you, 
Our style you see is grand, 
We're as happy as two thrushes, and 
We came from Ireland. 
Cucatus. 
Then watch our easy motion, (Break.) 
We have just come o'er the ocean 
To sweet America, 
We're gay and free as the little birds, 
And we'll have you to understand, 
We are two Irish Paddy's, and 
We came from Ireland. 
We 
left our native country 
While the birds were singing gay, 
To meet you here this evening 
We've braved the stormy sea, 
We 
left our friends behind us, 
And as we waived our hand, 
We softly murmured to them all, 
We're leaving Ireland. 
(Chorus.)

My Darling Son, 
Composed and sung by BEN H . 
BENTON. 
I'll sing to you of my darling son, 
He's nicknamed gallous Billy, 
He wears a 
great big stand-up collar 
That he calls a 
picadilly. 
He travels all the avenues 
In a 
style you would call grand; 
He teaches the girls to pivot on a 
5-cent copper rivet, 
In a 
way you couldn't understand. 
When he comes home from work at night 
He goes down to Harry Hill's; 
And whin there's to be an exhibition there 
His name is in big letters on the bills. 
He ginerally set-to's with the Mouse, 
And says he makes a 
rattler v 
id young Kelly, 
But whin I 
put the mits on with him at night, 
lie hits me a 
whack in the belly. 
He took his sister's best underclothes 
To give to an Irish fairy, 
And buried some jewelry in the hock 
That belonged to his cousin Mary; 
He takes in all the theatres, 
And says he'll be an actor yet, 
And have his picture in the windows along with 
Clara Morris, 
When he doubles with tl.e Hoboken Pet. 
When I 
try .o 
give him good advice, 
And ask him to be a 
good boy, 
He tells me to go and chew bean soup, 
That I 
mustn't take him for a 
toy. 
I 
surely think he'll do time yet 
If lie don't mend his way, 
And quit his racket of swiping wipes 
That he sells to them sheenys in the bay.

MY NATIVE LAND OF GREEN. 
I 
AM a 
true born Irishman I 
come from Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome with the grasp of friendship 
hand, 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure does abound, 
And good nature mix'd together in abundance can be found, 
iN here the boys are all so jolly, at a 
pattren race or fair; 
For courting purty girls none with them can compare, 
They're the bravest set of boys, that ever yet were seen, 
The boys of dear Ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
You will surely find Wit Paddy, his aid will always lend; 
And be ready to assist Toil. if e'er you want a 
friend. 
If his cabin you should enter, you know as yrell as me; 
He'll treat you with the very best, quite welcome you will be. 
He'll share his pipe and wtiskey, your sphits hs will cheer ; 
Oh! ould Ireland you're lily darling, the spot I 
love so aear. 
For true hospitality, no matter where I've been; 
There's no place lika ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
If e'er you're bent on plsasure; abroad you need not, roam, 
There's no such sights in foreign lands, like those we havu at horns 
Killarney's lakes are beautiful, as every (ine must own, 
And if your fond of ionsense, just kiss the Blarney Stone, 
We have scenery in W.eklow, there's the, Giant's Causeway toe 
The bay and sights '.zlind Dublin, are splendid to the view,

rtly Gal She is a 
Lusher. 
Written by W ASH. FAVOR for CHARLES GILDAY. 
My gal she is a 
lusher, 
She's always on the booze, 
And to see her drink cheap gin would make you 
Her nose is always blooming, 
It's as red as any rose, 
And her hair it is the color of a 
brick. 
But still she is a 
masher, 
And on her you bet I'm stuck, 
And I'd spend a 
quarter on her any day. 
For she'd straighten out my whiskers, 
And say I 
was a duck, 
And my darling then it's this to me she'd say. 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
dandy, I'm a 
loly pop, 
You can bet your life that I'm a 
swell ; 
With my nobby walk, I'm no dizzy gay. 
For I 
captivate the pretty Broadway belle. 
My daisy is a 
walker, 
On the track she is the boss, 
She could beat O'Leary any day. 
She can wrestle like a 
major, 
And never get a 
toss, 
For she's just as limber as a 
bale of hay. 
. 
She can also walk the tight-rope, 
And balance on her ear, 
Or do a 
juggling act with any clown. 
She can throw a 
double flip flop, 
Or break neck song and dance 
As good as any ham fat in this town. 
I'm a 
dandy, &c.

MY FATHER SOULD CHARCOAL. 
As Originally Sung by Dicx SANDS. 
When I 
was a 
servant in sweet Tipperary, oh !

And just as contrairy, oh! 
An Irish gosson, 
And great was th'applause of it;

She fell in a ditch, [ ing, oh! 
Which set her thinking, oh! 
A

And great was the size of it; 
My mouth held a 
dozen, 
Which widened the breadth of it. 
Me mouth held a

Which widened the breadth of it; 
My father sould charcoal, 
And that was the cause of it, 
At a 
break-down or reel, 
It's highly and dutiful, 
And if to remember, 
You deed not to stare at me; 
Sure, I 
can wear my brogans, 
Both behind and in front of me. 
And how does ye's do? 
I 
see ye's all laugh at me; 
And what would ye's give 
For a 
nice Photograph of me? 
And if to remember, 
You need not stare at me; 
Sure, I'll give every mother's son of ye's 
A 
lock of the hair of me. 
Sung by Mvuts MORRIS everywhere with great success. 
Oh, ' tis happy an Irishman ever will be 
In America—listen, the land of the free, 
Where whiskey is plenty, an' money galore, 
While at home we have ever the wolf at the door, 
If there's plenty to do we're always content, 
An' thankful to heaven for what has been sent ; 
Our consciences easy, light-hearted an' free, 
No king on a 
throne is more happy than we. 
An Irishman bears on his broad face a 
smile, 
Estranged though he be from Erin's green isle, 
No country born gossoon ever can be 
More happy than we from the isle of the sea. 
Unlike other people, no sorrow, no care, 
Find in their bosoms, light-hearted they are; 
They're happy an' merry, as merry can be, 
In America, whisper !—the land of the sea.

Sung by BILLY PORTER. 
Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
In this busy world of ours, 
Though we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flowers. 
Ev'ry loving deed and action 
is remembered but a 
while; 
And the thanks are oft as heartless 
As a 
flirting maiden's smile. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flow'rs, 
We are very soon forgotten 
In this thankless world of ours. 
Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
in the paths of daily life. 
Though we aid our lame companions, 
Who are plunged in deepest strife. 
Ey'ry tender word that's spoken 
To a 
friend in sad despair, 
Has a 
meaning seldom relished 
In this bustling world of care. 
Tho' we often, ctc.

Though we've helped the poor and needy

Johnny McGrath. 
Composed, written and sung by M. J. Emus, the popular Irish:Comediati 
and Comic Vocalist. 
Come all you tender-hearted, a 
story I 
will tell, 
It's about a 
true-born Irishman who on Dutch hill did dwell, 
He had an only daughter, and her name was Mary Ann, 
She'd lovers all by the score, to come at her command. 
CHORUS. 
Shinah, Shinah, Coka, anis a 
gal a 
fennah, hun, 
Hum, ah hum, argue a 
wallowah and me rummer vickah. 
Now Mary Ann loved a 
nice young man, and his name was 
Johnny McGrath, 
He had a 
city sinecure, a 
driving a 
big ash cart, 
Ile gathered up stuff in the Nineteenth Ward, and he loved 
his Mary Ann, 
He was second 
cousin 
to 
Harry Genet, 
the runaway 
Assemblyman. 
Now Mary Ann's father was wealthy, and own'd a 
big jackass. 
He was a 
noble boxer, and he wouldn't stand much sass; 
He said that Mary Ann must marry, there was no disputing 
that, 
To Billy Gillholly, who used to make soap fat. 
When Johnny McGrath had heard the news, the truth I 
will 
have you to know, 
He went and hired a 
big canal boat, and up East River did go; 
The boat it sank, and they were drowned in the bottom of 
the sea, 
On account of Billy Gillholly and her father's cruelty. 
When Mary Ann's father heard the news, he was very much 
in dread, 
He went and swallowed an ash barrel, and shot himself with 
a 
pig's head, 
And Billy Gillholly got blind drunk, as you can plainly hear; 
He slipped and fell, on Fourth avenue, and broke his ear. 
Come all you cruel parents, warning take, I 
pray, 
Don't force your daughters for to wed, or they'll surely run 
away 
Like Mary Ann and Johnny McGrath, that loved each other 
so dear, 
So I 
think I'll tumble to myself and drink a 
schooner °fixer.

Oh, I 
came to this country a 
short time ago, 
To better my fortune to find, 
For the old country, sure, is a 
very hard place, 
For any poor hard-working boy. 
But it's little better here, to my sorrow I 
find, 
As I 
search for employment each day, 
And to get it I 
can't; and the reason is this, 
Just because I 
am Irish, they say. 
CHORUS. 
Just because I 
am Irish they would give me no work, 
Just because I 
am Irish they cry, 
But where ever I 
go, in good fortune or woe, 
I 
will still be a 
true Irish boy. 
Aint it bard now,I ask you,that such things should be 
In a 
country where all are free men ? 
What have Irishmen done, now I 
plainly ask you, 
That such slurs should be cast upon them ? 
In America's troubles in days long ago, 
In the battle fields, fiercest arrayed, 
They did nobly fight for their God and the right, 
" 
Just because I 
am Irish," they cry. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
will say little more; I 
don't wish to offend, 
As my aim it is ever to please, 
And this world is a 
hard one to the poor,you all know 
With but little comfort and ease, 
There's a 
haven of rest away up in the skies 
That is ever pleasant and fair, 
And God, in His Infinite mercy, I 
know, 
Will admit all good Irishmen there, 
(Chorus.) 
Written expressly for CHAS. REDMOND and GEORGIE BLAKE, 
We're an Irish pair and we just landed, 
We came across the deep blue sea, 
And POW we're here we're going to tell you 
What we will do in America. 
We'll sing a 
dance like many others, 
Let troubles come, go where we may, 
We'll borrow none, our hearts are cheerful ; 
We're always gay on St. Patrick's day. 
CHORUS. 
We'll go home again, we'll go home again, 
So farewell friends, we'll go home again. ( Repeat.) 
So now kind friends we're going to leave you, 
We're going back where we were born— 
That dear old spot that we call Ireland, 
The climate there is always warm. 
When we get there, kind friends will greet us 
With loving hearts and welcome hands, 
So farewell friends, we now must leave you, 
We're going back to old Ireland. 
We'll go home again, &c.

FATHER—What's that you called me, you auld Dutch ras-
cal of de divel ! 
Don't ever attempt to call me that again, or 
I'll kick the daylights out of you. 
Do you hear that, auld 
Fritz Van Winkle? 
Ha, ha, ye're the chip off the auld block. 
'Twas no harm to call you Fritz, you well deserve the name. 
FRITZ—Well, Mr. Mc. O'Donnell, you must oxcuse me for 
using that name. I 
speake me not much good de Irish lang-
uge, and when St. Patrick's Day comes, widout regard to

will marry Kitty for sure. 
Ain'd dot so, 
Kitty? 
KITTY—Yes, Fritz, that is so. 
FATHER—Look here, Dutch, you see-see-see—Man over-

I 
swallowed the cud of tobacco, and it's resting on 
my left lung! Hould up now, I'm all right again. You made

You said klick klu klux, when you should 
have stepped forward like hunchback McCarthy, and cry out: 
Widout regard to clique or clan, 
I 
am Muldoon the solid man, 
Hurrah for the Queen, God save us all. 
KITTY—Father, you will have to pardon me for keeping it 
a 
secret, you see I 
am -;oing to get married to Fritz, and 
we will be happy all the days of our life. 
FATHER (coaxingly)—Will you ask the young gintlemaa to 
have a drink, Kitty, I am sure he needs something to 
strengthen his nerves. 
KITTY—He never drinks any strong liquor, father, so don't 
you offer him any. 
FATHER— Is that so, he looks pale, I 
think a 
little soothing 
->yrup or some of Railway's Ready Relief would do him good ;

KITTY—Never mind, father ; the wedding comes off to-
morrow, and Fritz will now sing his favorite song, ' The 
Shamrock."

FRITZ (
sings as follows)— 
THE SIIAMROC 
K. 
Through Erin's Isle, 
To sport awhile, 
As Love and Valor wander'd 
With Wit, the sprite, 
Whose quiver bright, 
A thousand arrows squandeed: 
Where'er they pass, 
A 
triple grass 
Shoots up with dew drops streaming, 
As softly green 
As Emeralds, seen 
Through purost crystal gleaming. 
Oh, the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock ! 
Chosen leaf 
Of bard and chief, 
Old Erin's native Shamrock. 
Says Valor, " See, 
They spring for 111e, 
Those leafy gems of morning !" 
Says Love, " No, no, 
For me they grow, 
My fragrant path adorning !" 
But Wit perceives 
The triple leaves, 
And cries, " Oh ! do not sever. 
A type that blends, 
Three godlike friends, 
Love, Valor, Wit, forever I" 
Oh, the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock ! 
Chosen leaf 
Of bard and chief, 
Old Erin's native Shamrock

FATTIER —
Well, Fritz, (shaking his hand) ye're my friend, 
and in; daughter belongs to you, so now join hands, and Le 
happy for the rest of yer lives ; and see here, Kitty, wlvil 
have you got to say about yerself ? 
K ITTY (sings)— 
I 
love Fritzy, I 
love Fritzy, 
And my Fritzy he loves me, 
We eat cabbage in our cottage, 
And he's all this world to me. 
F 
tu -rz (sings)— 
I 
love Kitty, I 
love Kitty, 
And my Kitty she loves me, 
she's my darling little treasure, 
And in Ireland we will stay. 
FATNER (sings)— 
They're as happy as can be, 
In the winter nights when Jack Frost he bites, 
And they'll sing and dance for ye. 
They will make yer faces smile, 
Oh, they are a 
fine odd couple, 
And with me you will agree, 
They are awful mighty clever, 
And are full of merry glee. 
FRurz— Vell, father, I 
hope you will give us your blessing, 
and pray that we may always be able to look on the bright 
side, and when the enemy comes down on us too hard, father, 
and when you are dead and gone I 
will see that you are 
buried in a 
Jews' burying ground, for that is the last blace the 
devil will ever go to look for an Irishman. 
(A great noise is heard outside ; great excitement all around ; 
soldiers, sailors, farmers and milkmaids all come in ; the 
music plays an Irish hornpipe, and all hands take parr 
in the dance, after which scene closes.)

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the.old-

published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
ad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Serieb of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such sb, way as to be non-coAamittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
Ltlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
pment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these cards is not restricted to two players, 
" but may be enjoyed by evening parties
