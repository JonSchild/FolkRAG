Matt McCullough interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 26, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company 
Plant in Evansville, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo:  
Today is Wednesday, May 26, 20210. This is an interview for the Occupational 
History Archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress funded by the 
Archie Green Fellowship. As part of this project, I'm interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent record collection at the 
Library of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I am speaking with Matt McCullough at the 
Lehigh Cement Company Plant, the Evansville plant in Pennsylvania. And just to confirm you, 
give me your permission to record the interview?  
 
Matt McCullough: Yes, I do.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. Could you give me your full name, year of birth and where you 
were born?  
 
MM: My name is Matthew Aaron McCullough. I was born in Redding, Pennsylvania, at the 
Redding Hospital. And my date of birth is 1991.  
 
VP: 
And is that where you grew up as well?  
 
MM: Mhm, yep.  
 
VP: 
When did you first learn about cement?  
 
MM: Six years ago. My father-in-law has worked here for I think 26 years maybe. And yeah, 
so he helped me get into the industry and I've been here ever since.  
 
VP: 
So, he works at the plant?  
 
MM: Yes. He is a payloader operator.  
 
VP: 
What does he do?  
 
MM: He drives, he pretty much fills all the hoppers and all the, he pretty much takes care of 
moving all the material around and loading and things like that.  
 
VP: 
And what's your job?  
 
MM: I am a shift supervisor.  
 
VP: 
And when exactly did you start?  
 
MM: I started June 1st, 2015 as a laborer.  
 
VP: 
And what did you do as part of that position?  
 
[00:02:07] 
 
MM: As a laborer, that position pretty much, we clean up different messes that are made just 
through the process and just a lot of miscellaneous things. You when you get hired here, you 
start as a laborer on the union side and everyone who comes in here on the on the union side 
starts as a laborer. So, that's how I got in that position. And then from there, I moved, I bid onto 
a what used to be called a Unit Five position, which is the feed and operations of the kiln, of 
the kilns. And then I worked in that position for roughly four years. And then I had a short stint 
in the shipping department and then back to the feed end. And then then I crossed over to the 
salary side and became a shift supervisor.  
 
VP: 
What was the bidding process like to get a job?  
 
MM: My first, when I first bid onto my first feed end job since I was the low man on the 
totem pole. So, I kind of got forced into a position and then, so that so that wasn't so bad. And 
then when I went over to shipping a bit over to shipping, I don't think there was any other takers 
who bid on that position. And then to come back, a position opened up back on the on the feed 
end side, which is a swing shift position and I just from then I had more seniority, so I was able 
to get that no problem. And not many people since and since I've worked it before, there was 
no training that I had to go through to get it. So, it was an easy choice. And then so I worked 
at and then as a Unit Eight position, which is a shift supervisor, that came up and then I decided, 
you know, I wanted to I wanted to cross over and see what the salary side was like and hopefully 
move up in the company as time goes on.  
 
VP: 
So, how is it how is it different working on the salary side?  
 
MM: Um, uh, I like it more because I'm involved in every aspect of the plant. As before, I 
was just involved in the in the kilns and that process. But now I'm involved throughout the 
entire plant, which I like. And then I have I have my own group of guys that I'm in charge of 
and I like that. And other than that, I mean, I'm still out and about, still I still like to get my 
hands dirty and work with the guys, but I definitely like I definitely like being a shift supervisor 
more than my previous positions. So, but other than that, it's different, but it's not, you know, 
because I'm still out and about. But like I said, I definitely like that more. 
 
VP: 
Can you do the job that you did in the previous positions? 
 
MM: Um, yeah, in the previous position, pretty much the main task of a feed end operator is 
keeping those kilns running, keeping the rotary kilns running and making sure they're getting 
what we call kiln feed, which is just crushed up limestone, it’s going through the raw mills 
down in the mill department. It gets sent back to us. And our main job is to make sure the kilns 
are getting the feed that they need. And it's such a delicate, it's a very delicate process. And it's 
definitely interesting. And from what I've heard, it's more hands-on at this plant since it is such 
an older plant. I think it's 110 years old, maybe, maybe more maybe less. But it’s definitely 
over 100 hundred years. And so, and the feed end is considered more, one of the more difficult 
jobs in the plant.  
 
VP: 
[unclear] 
 
MM: Since it's working around the kilns is gets a lot hotter and you definitely get dirtier and 
it's dusty. And there's a lot more of, I don't want to say responsibility, but there is more urgency 
to make sure the kilns are getting what they need because it is such a delicate process with the 
kilns.  As far, you know, outside people wouldn't even realize how delicate it can be, especially 
with the chemistry and in the fuel that the kilns take. But it's very, very, very, very hot 
sometimes back there. So, and then it's primarily outside all the time, winter, summer, no matter 
what. So that's why it's considered one of the more difficult jobs here.  
 
VP: 
So, can you talk a little bit about what, how is it delicate, how does that change your 
job versus if you worked at a different time?  
 
MM: It's delicate because if the feed would flood, the kilns will call for a certain amount of 
kiln feed at any given time. And if one of the storage silos, which is the silos that that feed the 
current through a pump into a preheater, it's delicate as far as if we could have a cyclone choke. 
And a cyclone is what comes before the riser, which is from the riser it goes into the kiln and 
the cyclone, that could choke. And that's could be a very dangerous job to unclog a cyclone, 
especially for someone who's never done it before. I've had a few of them in my day back there 
and it can be stressful if you don't know what you're doing, but and intimidating. But throughout 
my time here, I've always worked with a good group of guys, and especially at this plant, there's 
a lot of guys here with a lot of knowledge and a lot of seniority. And for the most part, 
everybody is more than happy to help. It's kind of like a brotherhood here, so.  
 
VP: 
And why is it difficult to work in an older plant?  
 
[00:08:29] 
 
MM:  Just because of the machinery, since the machinery is older, as far as like a modern 
plant. But from what I've heard, some of the modern plants still haven't worked out all the bugs. 
We kind of know all our bugs here. So, it can be more difficult just as far as take, for instance, 
our kiln feed system, I think was designed or put in in the 1960s. And it's a completely different 
setup than what would be in a modern plant. It's a lot more hands on and it's a lot more, it can 
be more arduous to get things flowing as opposed to a different style of kiln feed setup, you 
know what I mean?  
 
VP: 
And so, you mentioned there's some bugs that you know and anticipate.  
 
MM: Oh, yeah.  
 
VP: 
What are some of them? 
 
MM: Just with the kiln feed system, we know that some gates that are at the storage silos 
won't feed as well as others, especially like when we bring a kiln up, like from it sitting down, 
there's certain things that you have to pre-do before starting up and get everything rolling and 
get the gas on that maybe at a different, more modern plant you might not have to do. But some 
of the bugs would be, especially at a since this is an older plant, you have to, it's a lot more 
manual, I guess you could say. Instead of being automated, you know, especially in 2021, I 
know in the mill building it can be like that too, there's more manual work that has to be done 
hands-on instead of just pressing a button. So that's what can make it more harder. And some 
of the bugs, you know, things material will choke up or things that or material doesn't want to 
come out of a silo. So, you have to kind of get in there and [unclear] and use one of them to get 
them to get everything flowing.  
 
VP: 
And so, you kind of anticipate some issues that might come about.  
 
MM: Yes, absolutely.  
 
VP: 
And what kind of skills do you think that cement workers need to anticipate those 
problem?  
 
[00:10:58] 
 
MM: You need to know how to troubleshoot things and you definitely need to, a good trait, 
I should say, maybe not necessarily a skill, is definitely perseverance and not giving up, because 
there's some things here that almost seem like it would be an impossible task. But, you know, 
and just from talking to some of the more senior guys here, it's not impossible, you just got to 
keep working at it and just keep chipping away. So, I would say that, um. But, yeah, it's 
definitely different working in an older plant as opposed to a more modern plant. But it kind 
of gives you more of a sense of pride knowing that out of, because Evansville, everyone here, 
for the most part, is pretty proud of working here. And I think our kiln just did number one for, 
I'm pretty sure just did number one, out of all of Lehigh. We’re kind of, Evansville’s kind of, 
even though we're the oldest, we still produce, we produce and we always just keep shining. 
So, I'm pretty proud of that. And I know a lot of other guys are too that we as old as we are, we 
still keep doing our thing. But yeah, I mean, the Evansville plant, it's since it is a smaller plant 
with less employees, everybody knows everybody and is like I said, it is it is kind of a 
brotherhood here. I mean, everybody knows the machinery, you know what I mean? Everybody 
in your work at every day, so you do as—and I tell the newer guys that I've trained in the 
back—you almost develop, as odd as it sounds like a relationship with some of the equipment 
because you're working with it so often and you know the different like, you know, if it sounds 
off, then, you know, like, OK, there's an issue with this. So that's one thing. But it's rewarding, 
I'd say it's rewarding.  
 
VP: 
You guys have, like, favorite equipment that they like to use the most or do they claim 
equipment as theirs.   
 
MM: Um, yeah, sometimes. But a good example that I that I tell some of the newer guys that 
I've trained out back in the past where the feet end is, take, for instance, dustbin 2 and dustbin 
1. Dustbin 2 always has trouble feeding as opposed to dustbin 1. Sometimes you forget about 
it because it feeds all by itself all the time. But dustbin 1 can be a little bit more temperamental. 
I guess you could say, so. Yeah. With something like that I'd rather, I've already said that 
backhouse 1, which goes which is the pretty much the dust collector for four kiln 1 always 
behaves better than backhouse 2. So, it's funny that you that that's how I say it. But everyone 
who worked back there knows what I'm talking about. It's so that's funny in that way.  
 
VP: 
It has its own personality.  
 
MM: Yes, exactly. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, what is it like to work with the older guys?  
[00:14:27] 
 
MM: It's honestly cool because you talk to you talk to them and they'll tell you stories about 
how it was in the past and how, you know, especially here I've seen pictures of things where 
stuff that's not even been there, that that's not even there anymore. Or guys will talk about the 
old bag houses and what it was like to work with them or, you know, just how we used to run 
coal here. We used to run coal because we used to use coal as the primary fuel for the kilns, 
and we don't do that anymore. We just got off of that, I think, in 2017 or 2018. But some of the 
newer guys, and coal was a very hard job. Running coal was a hard job and it was a part of the 
feeding task. So, but talking to the older guys, especially the one guy here, has been here 53 
years and I'm pretty sure he started went off to fight Vietnam and came back. And he's still 
here, he's a payload operator. So, it's pretty cool talking to him and seeing his experience with 
this place. So, it's everyone for the most part, especially the longer you're here, you're very 
interested in the history of the place because you're here. You're here all the time, so.  
 
VP: 
Yeah, well, what was most surprising for you to learn about their experience in 
comparison to your experience?  
 
[00:15:50] 
 
MM: I guess how things in the past, I don't want to say they were unsafe because they weren't 
unsafe, but they, things since it was a different time and a different generation, things were a 
lot more rough than they are now. There was a lot more safety protocols set in place as opposed 
to back in the 60s and 70s or 80s, you know? So, in that sense, it's cool to hear how things were 
done back then as opposed to you think to yourself, wow, that's, that's crazy that that’s how 
you used to do it back then. I couldn't even imagine having to do that now and how. But they 
did it, you know, they did it and they did it. They somehow did it safely. So, it's cool in that 
sense to hear and how they used to do that and to especially to see pictures of the older guys 
back then doing the job that that we do now. So, that's cool.  
 
VP: 
So, hearing their stories, did you learn something new about the cement industry? Did 
it change your thinking about it?  
 
MM: Here, especially now as a supervisor, but you learn something new every day, you 
know? If you don't learn something new, then it wasn't a good day because it's so, things are 
so temperamental in the cement industry and there's so many different types of people that 
work. I mean, you got you got a lab guy. Now, obviously, his experience is going to be 
completely different than a mill guy. So, it's some of the things, some of the newer things you 
learn. Now, as a supervisor, I learned, especially a newer supervisor, I learn something new 
every single day, every single day and night I learn something new. So, but I love it. I love 
learning stuff new about the cement industry. And I would have never thought, you know, 
when I first started as a laborer that I would have gotten this far and learned as much as I do 
especially, It's always neat understanding it. You know, you hear the other, the older guys talk 
about it. And you kind of, it's like especially listening on the radio, it's almost sounds like a 
foreign language. But then as you're here and you pick up on it, it's awesome. You know, when 
you're like, it clicks and you understand, OK, that's how that works or that's what they're talking 
about or that's where that is.  
 
VP: 
Does it sound like a foreign language because they're using particular terms or do guys 
start kind of using shorthand for some things?  
 
MM: Oh, yeah, both, absolutely. It can sound like foreign language, just as a newer employee. 
You're just not familiar with some of it. But yeah, a lot of, there is definitely a lot of shorthand 
like abbreviations of what you're talking about. And there's so many silos, you know, as a 
newer guy, you have no idea what silo’s which or what piece or what motor’s which, you 
know? But as time goes on and working, working some, you know, you learn what's in what 
silo or what 40 means, you know, as a point. The different types of cement people would never 
you know, people who don't work in the industry would never realize how many different types 
of cement there are, you know, so that's cool. It's weird that something as common as cement 
you would be interested in, you know what I mean?  
 
VP: 
So, can you talk about like what your typical day looks like at work?  
 
MM: Every day is different, every day is different. There's always new issues. There's always 
something new that that arises. But a typical day, just take, for instance, last night, you come 
in, I'll come in, I'll talk to the shift supervisor who was on previous before I was.   
 
VP: 
What time do you come in?  
 
MM: I show up as a supervisor, I like to get here a half hour before my shift would come. It's 
just so he can give me the rundown on what was done in the previous shift, what's still left to 
do and what needs to get done. Because my boss will send out especially on, well, always on 
second shift or third shift, which we call B shift in C shift and then day shift is A shift. He'll 
send out a daily production, we call “the daily.” And it's just the things that need to get done or 
things that need to be worked on and fixed or what type of cement we need to switch over to 
and what silo it needs to go to. So, each and every day is different. But so after we call, after 
he passes on to me, he'll go home, my guys will show up and I'll give them their duties for the 
night. I'll tell them what needs to get done. And some guy some areas, some areas, nothing 
specific needs to get done. But they still need to do their rounds and make sure everything is 
running good. How I used to explain it to the newer guys is, you don't get paid for when things 
are going good, you get paid for when things go bad. You need to know what to do. And you're 
kind of like, how I used to explain it would be you're like a babysitter, you know, you want to 
make sure the kilns, I would always call them, they're your babies you're watching. You're the 
babysitter for eight hours or twelve hours, depending on what you're doing. You're the 
babysitter and you want to keep that baby happy. You don't want then to get upset. So, you'll 
do whatever it takes to keep that baby from crying and make sure that baby stays running. So 
that's how I always explain. And I think that's a perfect analogy for it, because, you know, 
you're in charge. You're in charge, so you got to make sure those things are those things are 
running because that's the money. They're the money makers, so.  
 
VP: 
What is it like to work a night shift?  
 
[00:22:18] 
 
MM: Some people, they think they would think it'd be hard, but after doing it for almost six 
years, in a few days, it'll be six years, June 1st it'll be six years exactly. But you get used to it. 
You just get used to it. This would be my last this would be my last night out. Last night was 
my last night on third shift. So, today I'll stay up all day and then I'll go to bed at night to 
transition, to get ready to transition to day shift. I'll have off tomorrow and then I'll come back 
day shift Friday. So, I tell some people that, they're like how do you stay up for thirty-some 
hours. And I just, I don't know if it's because I'm younger or but I know some of the older guys 
do the same thing, but I'm so used to it that I don't really think about it anymore. I just do it.  
 
VP: 
How does that impact your personal life outside of work?  
 
MM: It can be hard at times, it can be hard at times. My wife has gotten used to it over the 
years. But you make it work. You know, I see some of the newer, some of the younger, newer 
employees who start they have trouble with it. They have trouble being able to, you know, 
work second shift or work day shift where they they've got to get up early because they don't 
they might not necessarily have as many responsibilities or they're just younger, they're not 
used to it. But it can, it can impact it. But second shift is the one that mainly impacts your 
personal life. Third shift, third shift, you're able to make it work and working swing shift and 
having off during the week is nice because you can still you can still make it to baseball games 
for the kids or, you know, so in that respect, it's I personally like swing shift. A lot of people 
don't. But I love it because I couldn't imagine having to work Monday through Friday, only 
having two days off. I love working swing shift. So, and some people think that's nuts, but I 
don't as of now, I don't ever plan on getting off swing shift.  
 
VP: 
And so how much time off do you get on swing shift?  
 
MM: As a shift supervisor, we have a pretty nice schedule. I like it. It's changed, you know, 
throughout the years. But the schedule we follow now, so I'll have off today and then I'll have 
off Thursday. I'll go back dayshift Friday. I'll work Friday and then Saturday and Sunday, I 
will work 12-hour shifts, I'll work 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and then Monday, Tuesday, 
Wednesday, I'm just 7-3. And then I will have off Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and 
then come back second shift Monday through Friday. And then after that, I'll have off Saturday, 
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and then come back third shift Wednesday at 11 o'clock. And then 
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, 11-7. And then Saturday, Sunday, 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. and 
then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Monday, Tuesday are just 11-7 and then start the whole 
cycle back over again. So, you get used to it over the years. But like I said, some, some people 
couldn't imagine doing it. Some of my friends couldn't imagine having to do it, but you get 
used to it.  
 
VP: 
So, you mentioned working in the cement plant is a kind of brotherhood.  
 
MM: Yeah.  
 
VP: 
Could you talk a little bit about how you build community together?  
 
[00:26:09] 
 
MM: Since some of the jobs can be hard and unenjoyable, as far as some of the tasks you 
have to do, like getting dirty and being around noise all the time. You kind of, I don't want to 
compare it to the military as far as like your, but I've described it in the past, like when, you 
know, a certain thing has to get done, it's almost like you're ready to go into battle with getting 
with get in the silo, feeling well, you know, like especially in the dead of summer when you 
know it's 90 something degrees and you're going to go into a silo that's above 100 degrees and 
you're going to be in there for a little while, getting dusty, getting almost muddy. Since you're 
not the only one doing it and every shift has to do it at some point, you develop a brotherhood 
as far as like talking about your different experiences or how you did something and you 
compare like how they did it compared to how you do it. So, in that way, I'd say it's a 
brotherhood. And just in any job there's not everybody's going to get along. But for the most 
part, I would say everybody gets along here, for the most part.  
 
VP: 
Do you hang out after work, outside of work?  
 
MM: A lot of the guys do, a lot of the guys do. I don't so much, I don't so much as a shift 
supervisor just because I still like to maintain a, I'm friendly with my guys and I like my crew. 
I think my crew a good group of guys and they're hard workers. But I still like to maintain a 
professional relationship with them where, and I do consider them some of my friends—I went 
to high school with two of them, but I may consider them friends. But like I've said before to 
another one of my friends who's also a supervisor. You know, if some of your guys are your 
friends, then they'll work for you. You know, they won't take advantage of you, they'll try. You 
know, if they take advantage of you, then then they're not your friends. So as a shift supervisor, 
I definitely like to maintain a, I don't I don't I won't hang out with them in that, you know, just 
because I feel like if you get too close, you might run into, you still want to be able to discipline 
them if something goes, if something would happen. So that's why I do that. But everybody's 
different.  
 
VP: 
Yeah, what is it like to work with your high school classmate?  
 
MM: Um, it's cool. I mean, it's cool that the one the one of my classmates, he was two years 
older than me, but I knew him all throughout school and he got hired the very same day that I 
did. And I didn't even know he was getting hired here. So, it's kind of like a journey, you know, 
you have. And then the one, my PCL operator, I went to kindergarten with him. So, it's cool in 
that way that we know all the same people, grew up in the same places. And it's even cool that, 
you know, some of the guys in my unit 4, my mill operator, he graduated from the same high 
school I did except thirty years before I did. So that's cool in that way that everybody here is 
pretty much either from the Allentown area or the Redding area, the Fleetwood area, so. I feel 
like in that way it can kind of be a brotherhood.  
 
VP: 
All paths lead to the cement plant.  
 
MM: Yes, exactly.  
 
VP: 
It seems like there are a few international workers or especially on the management 
side.  
 
MM: Mhm.  
 
VP: 
So how do the local workers, laborers react to the newcomers or outsiders, workers who 
come outside the Lehigh Valley? 
 
[00:29:57] 
 
MM: Some of the older, senior guys who've been here for so long, you know, I don't want to 
say they're not open to them, but they're more, how do you say, skeptical of what they're going 
to do compared to what how things are done, you know, this is how things have been. You 
know, this is how things have been done for 40 years is a saying. But some of the newer guys 
are more open to it. I know a few years back, and I believe you even interviewed him, Amr, I 
would love talking to him about how things were in different countries or how, because he's 
worked almost all over the world in different cement plants. So, I would love talking to him 
about stuff. And he's a lot of the stuff, he’s, I've learned a lot from him. And I think I love 
talking to the guys who've been around. I think they have a wealth of knowledge that and 
they're more than happy to share. So, everyone who and everyone who knows about cement 
loves talking about cement. So, it sounds funny, but that's the truth.  
 
VP: 
And you mentioned your friends are surprised that you're so into cement sometimes.  
 
[00:31:09] 
 
MM: Yeah. I mean, the way I look at it is, this is what I do. You know, I think it'd be silly 
not to be interested in it. You know, I want to know everything I possibly can about cement. 
And I think that's what separates a good worker compared to someone who's not going to make 
it, because we've seen a lot of people don't make it in cement. They just can't take it. So, they're 
surprised as far as because, yeah, people ask you what you do and you say you work at a 
cement, you know, with cement, they think you pave roads, and they have they have no clue 
what you really do. You can't even you can't even begin to describe to them what really gets 
done in a cement plant, so. They're surprised in that because a lot of people think cement is just 
such a simple, simple process, but they have no clue, especially as important as it is to society.  
 
VP: 
So, how has the pandemic changed work at the plant for you?  
 
[00:32:18] 
 
MM: At first, when the pandemic started, it was almost like we were in a little bubble here 
because everybody was getting, everybody was losing their jobs or getting laid off. And 
Governor Wolf, he gave us, we work, what was the term they used? Essential. We were 
essential. So, like, it was pretty much it was business as usual here. We didn't really, except 
with more safety protocols to prevent Covid, with the masks and different, and you have to 
answer questions as far as travel wise. But for the most part, it was business as usual. They did 
lay off for a short period of time here. They laid off for a short period of time, I was back within 
two weeks and it impacted a little bit for the most part, Evansville did great, Evansville did 
great, you know, through the whole pandemic. And we're still going strong in 2021. So, that's 
why personally, I'm more than happy to keep working in cement.  
 
VP: 
What would you say is kind of the most challenging part of your job or working at the 
cement plant?  
 
MM: The most challenging … maybe. Well, I'd say one of the more challenging, now I've 
gotten better at it is since being a new guy, I've now been here six years is still considered new, 
especially with how many senior guys are here. But some of them, one of the more challenging 
aspects at first was telling a guy who's been here longer than I've been alive what to do or how 
to do it, you know? That was that was challenging at first. But it's gotten easier, especially 
because, like I said, it's kind of close knit. So, it's not like ever that I'm ordering somebody to 
do something. Everybody pretty much knows what needs to be done. And everybody knows, 
you know, it's going to be tough. But I think I'm kind of at an advantage as far as somebody at 
least at a supervisor standpoint. I've worked it. You know, I'm never going to tell somebody to 
do something I didn't already do or I wouldn't do. So, I'm more than happy to jump out and 
give them a hand if they need it. So, I think and that builds respect with your guys to see, you 
know, I'll get dirty with them and all. I'll be through the hard the hard jobs with them as opposed 
to some supervisors who might have not worked in the cement industry before, won't or just 
don't know how. So, I think I'm at an advantage as far as that.  
 
VP: 
And what would you say is the best part of your job? What do you like most about 
working in the industry?  
 
[00:35:19] 
 
MM: Something new every day, something new every day. And two nights ago, I'd say one 
of the more rewarding things, is two nights ago we came in, finish mill 3 was down. There was 
something called a mud ring inside of it. And it's almost like it's a race against time in my eight 
hours, like I always tell my PCO, you know, there's not enough time in the shift to get over 
with everything that I want to get done. But the more, to come in and see a piece of to see a 
piece of machinery down and doing what needs, doing what needs to be done to take care of 
the issue. And by the time you leave, that piece of machinery is up and running and going 
strong. And I always like coming in and leaving it better than how I found it. So that's 
rewarding.  
 
VP: 
How long do your jobs typically take?  
 
MM: It all depends. It all depends on how serious the issue. If it's a full-on failure of 
something, then it could take you know, there's jobs here that take days to complete and then 
there's jobs that could take a matter of seconds to do, depending on how serious the issue is. 
But it's nice seeing a job that does take days, it's nice to see that come, you know, to see it 
happen, you know, to see like, OK, we started with this, it was a huge mess, this was broken 
and it was destroyed. And everybody comes together each shift, you know, A, B and C shift, 
work around the clock, get it done and it’s back up and rolling. So that's something. And I think 
that goes along with the brotherhood as well as everybody's doing it. You know, everybody's 
a part of it. Even the guys who might not get along, you're still right there with them doing it. 
So, everybody shares the same experience, I would say.  
 
VP: 
So, in closing the interview is there is something that you would like to say that you 
haven’t had a chance to talk about or something that I didn’t ask, perhaps you would like to 
comment on?  
 
MM: Not so much. As far as people, I just would only thing I'd like to say is people who don't 
work in the cement industry will never understand how hard it can be and the sacrifice that 
some of the guys, that some of the guys take to make something as, what people think as far as 
cement, you know, people have no idea that isn't as important cement is, nobody thinks about 
it. You know, nobody thinks about the bridges that they're on or, you know, and how what it 
took to make that bridge or just the highways that they that the that they drive on, you know, 
and I don't expect anybody to think that. But a lot goes into making this stuff. And I think it's 
great that we're being recognized. You know, the cement, the cement workers are being 
recognized because we’re important to society. And, you know, everybody for the most part in 
this industry, they’re tough, you got to be tough, and that's what makes it cool. Some of the 
guys here have a saying, you know there’s Marines, there's pirates, and then they're cement 
workers. So that's, so that's cool.  
 
VP: 
That's amazing. Thank you so much.
