I'm thinking to- night of the old rustic bridge 
That bends o'er the murmuring stream ; 
'Twas there, Maggie dear, with our hearts full of cheer 
We stray'd neath the moon's gentle gleam ; 
'Twas there I 
first met you— the light of your eyes 
Awoke in my heart a 
sweet thrill. 
Tho' now far away, still my thoughts fondly stray 
To the old rustic bridge by the mill. 
CHORUS . 
Beneath it the stream gently rippled, 
Around it the birds loved to trill ; 
Tho' now far away, still my thoughts fondly stray, 
To the old rustic bridge by the mill. 
How often, dear Maggie, when years passed away, 
And we plighted lovers became, 
We rambled the path to the bridge day by day, 
The smiles of each other to claim; 
But one day we parted in pain and regret, 
Our vows then we could not fulfil; 
Oh may we soon meet and our fond Jove repeat, 
On the old rustic bridge by the mill. 
Cno.—Beneath it the stream, etc. 
I 
keep in my mem'ry our love of the past— 
With me ' tis as bright as or () id; 
For deep in my heart it was planted to last, 
In absence it never grows cold. 
I 
think of you, darlin(r, when lonely at night, 
And when all is peaceful and still ; 
My heart wanders back in a 
dream of delight, 
To the old rustic bridge by the mill.

There's an old-fashioned house in the old country,

There's an old-fashioned gate by the old country road, 
And an old-fashioned man near the chair;

Don't call me weak- minded—perchance I 
should sing 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth : 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring 
To my mind the dear land of my birth, 
With its bills and its valleys, its mountains and vales. 
Of which our forefathers would boast— 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green— 
Ah 
but list, and I'll give you an Irishman's toast— 
CHORUS. 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so °Teen; 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen ; 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most— 
May God save old Ireland that's on Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam 
Through the castle that stood on the hill ; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air-----
C110.—Here's to the land, etc. 
The church and the school- house have long been replaced; 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host, 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post. 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas ; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot, 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze— 
Ctro.—Here's to the land, etc.

Each animal and bird can hear the voice of love, 
From the roaring lion- to the turtle- dove ; 
And when I 
want to call a 
mate, I 
have my way, 
And in a 
language of my own tints I 
say : 
" 
How d'ye do ? w'st, w'st ! how are you? w'st, w'st !" 
You are always sure to fetch them with a 
w'st, w'st, w'st ! 
Come along, w'st, w'st ! nothing wrong, w'st, w'st ! 
Oh! won't you come and take a 
walk and w'st, w'st, w'st 1 
One day I 
met a 
lady in the Central Park, 
She said that she was fond of birds, and liked a 
lark; 
So I 
sat myself beside her 'neath the rustling trees, 
And took her little hand in mine and gave it a 
squeeze. 
" 
How d'ye do ? w'st, w'st ! how are you ? w'st, w'st !" 
You are always sure to fetch them with a 
w'st,w'st,w'st! 
Come along, w'st, w'st ! nothing wrong, ws't, w'st! 
Oh! won't you come and take a 
walk and w'st, w'st,w'st! 
Says she, " I 
think my appetite is very good. 
A 
pleasant meal I'd relish, sir—indeed, I 
should. 
I'm good at ordering suppers, and I'll save your pelf, 
So if you do not mind it, I'll order it myself." 
" 
Garcon, here ! w'st, w'st ! nothing queer, w'st, w'st! 
We want the best of everything, w'st, w'st, w'st! 
And will test, w'st, w'st ! the very best, w'st, w'st 
And we don't mind what we pay for it, w'st, w'st,w'st!" 
She ordered everything with such a 
charming grace, 
That the bill was growing just about as long as my face, 
When in a 
hulking fellow came, who grimly said, 
" 
If you don't pay the bill and go, I'll punch your head !" 
Au revoir ! w'st, w'st! through the door, w'st, w'st 
Then arm-in-arm they left me, with a 
w'st, w'st, w'st! 
Waiter came, w'st, w'st ! same old game, w'st, w'st! 
" 
Come and settle for the supper, with a 
w'st,w'st,w'st!" 
The charges were about as high as Bunker Hill, 
Amazed was I 
when called upon to square that bill. 
And when I 
went to settle up, what could I 
do? [too! 
When I 
found my purse was gone, my watch, my diamonds 
"Policeman, here! w'st,w'st! something queer, w'st,w'st! 
They had to fetch my father, with a 
w'st, w'st, w'st ! 
Never try, w'st, w'st ! if you're fly, w'st, w'st! 
In the Park to get a

In summer time, when all is fine, 
And the trees and grass are green ; 
When the boys are drinking lager beer, 
And ev'ry thing's serene, 
On Tom McD.'nnell's old tin roof, 
The boys do dance at night, 
With Kitty Malone and Mary Shea, 
Who sing with all their might. 
They have a 
big RCCOrdecn— 
The music it is grand, 
You'll hear them shout for miles away ; 
Faith ! they never will go home 
While they can have a 
nine, 
And Tracy on his instruments will play.

It's polkas, waltzes, quadrilles all the night ; 
'Ti .s 
finer than the Op'ra Bouffe ; 
If you don't believe I'm right, 
Call around there any 
And you'll find us on McDonnell's old tin roof. 
They call themselves the midnight owls ; 
They dance by li!Tht of moon ; 
To start for home at two o'clock, 
They say it is too soon. 
They keep the folcs awake all night, 
They never have their rest, 
To sing their songs and play their tunes, 
They do their level best. 
The music it is charming— 
It really is divine ; 
'Tis.finer than the Op'ra Bouffe. 
When they the Boston dip, 
Faith ! the house rocks like a 
ship ; 
there's no place like McDonnell's old tin roof.

And you'll find us on McDonnell's old tin roof. 
Across the street from where I 
live, 
A 
German keeps a 
store ; 
He is a 
baker- man by trade, 
He's worth a 
thousand or more, 
He keeps about five men at work— 
Of course they're up all night ; 
But when they hear the music play, 
They shout with great delight. 
About the time the bread is bak'd 
The boys and girls descend ; 
They don't stop till they've reached the door. 
Then they'll skip across the street, 
And the bread they'll nip so neat— 
Oh, you ought to hear the bakers, how they roar.

Dar's heaps of trouble on de old man's mind— 
Come, darkies, weep with me; 
My Mary Ann's run away wid a 
coon, 
And he's black, he's black as he can be. 
But I 
wouldn't care if he was only yellow, 
But he's black all o'er, he's porter in a 
store, 
And my heart it is tore, when I 
think the matter o'er, 
Dat de child dat I 
bore should think of me no more 
Dan to run away wid a 
great black coon. 
CHORUS. 
Mary's gone wid a 
coon 
Mary's gone wid a

Heaps of trouble on de old man's mind, 
Since Mary's gone wid a 
coon. 
Oh! I 
never thought, when I 
raised dat child, 
Of de trouble she would be to me ; 
She had everything dat her heart could wish, 
She was raised in de lap of luxury ; 
And I 
never once for a 
moment suspected 
But dat she'd reflected, before she selected, 
A man more respected, more highly connected, 
Less darkly complected, and not have' dejected 
Dis old man's mind with trouble like dis.-
010.—Mary's gone, etc. 
Now all you people who have children to raise, 
Take warning at my fate ; 
Watch over dent carefully, or else you'll find, 
Like me, dat you have been too late. 
For girls are wild when dey're in deir teens ; 
Dey're always after beaux, and wearing good clothes, 
And going to shows, and no one knows, 
All de troubles and woes from a 
parent's heart flows— 
It's enough to break dis old man's heart.

With merry coons from far and near.

spoon a 
girl named Mary A 
nn, a 
tender little dove, 
-Who costs me lots of half- pence and a 
precious deal of love ; 
She's living *W I 
her mother, as a 
maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me, or you. 
But somehow, when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to 
know ; 
For, certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, [shout— 
Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your ma ; 
She little thought, when you came out, you'd go so far. 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are— 
Mary Ann, fie ! for shame, Yak I 
yah! yah ! Oh I 
yah 
We went last Whitsun-Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the timing first-class, of course— at that I 
never fail. 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they culd not bear the sun ; 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go, 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
('no,—Oh I 
very well, etc. 
We wander'd through the forest-glades as happy as could be, 
We thought, from vulgar people there, we should at least 
be free. [could hear, 
We sought a 
sweet, secluded spot, where none our vows 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so 
dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet, and kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap, bird's- nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
eno.—Oh ! very well, etc. 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere Ave met the cry, no matter where we'd roam. 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not— 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about ; 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside. 
A 
volce came down the staircase, and her little brother cried— 
SPOKEN.—Oh oh! oh I 
Cno.—Oh! very well, etc.

stormy winter's night, 
The snow was falling fast ; 
A mother and two little babes 
Were wandering through the blast. 
Still clinging to their mother's breast, 
The little ones would cry, 
Please, mamma, won't you make us warm ? 
0 mamma! we will die. 
CHORUS. 
Toll the village bell, 
Let all good people know, 
'Twas on that dreadful stormy night 
Three perished in the snow. 
When morning dawned the sun came out, 
The snow was melting fast ; 
Three darling forms lay side by side, 
In one fond, loving clasp. 
A 
farmer heard the sad, sad news, 
That made him weep to know, 
That from his house not twenty rods, 
Three perished in the snow.

We're not surprised to see you stare 
Upon our neat array 
Of dandy colored gentlemen 
Employed upon Broadway. 
We never lose our dignity, 
Though jingling plates of hash, 
We never could associate 
With common colored trash. 
CHORUS. 
We hear de gong a 
sounding, 
We hear the steward call ; 
Now all the figs are ready for to slide into the hall I 
Oh! flourish all de napkins, 
Be sure to take your place, 
And skip around the tables with aristocratic grace. 
Take dis gemman's order, 
Bring a 
glass of water, 
Soup and fish on separate dish, 
The steward's in a 
flutter. 
Ah, here comes a 
stranger, a 
hay- seed and a 
granger. 
Slightly stoop and spill the soup, 
And grease him wid de butter. 
Polite attention to the man 
That puts beneath his plate 
A 
dollar bill to make us prompt-
Such folks will never wait. 
We'll smother him in luxuries, 
And eagerly prepare

I 
strolled along the Avenue, 
When I 
saw passing by 
A 
damsel pert with pretty face, 
Who smiled with roguish eye. 
I 
raised my hat and glided near, 
" 
Are you going far ?" said I ; 
And to my question whispered low, 
She made me this reply. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Are you going far this ev'ning ? 
No, not far; only to the car, 
To meet Papa! Ta! Ta! 
To meet Papa! Ta! Ta !" 
I 
thought perhaps she failed to hear 
Exactly what I 
said; 
Encouraged by another smile, 
Which almost turned my head, 
Again I 
spoke in sweetest tones, 
And said, " I 
meant 110 harm. 
I'll be your escort, sweetest girl," 
And offered her my arm. 
Cuo.—" Are you going," etc. 
I 
asked her then if she'd partake 
Of oysters, stewed or raw. 
She said she would, and in we went, 
And she passed in before. 
Her appetite was very keen, 
And my money quickly flew. 
Our supper o'er we stepped without 
Upon the Avenue. 
Cno.—"Are you going;" etc.

The moon was shining on the lake, 
The stars shone from above ; 
Gazing on the water, 
My heart was filled with love. 
There I 
met my darling, 
Whose eyes with joy did beam, 
As gently I 
spoke to her 
Of young love's sweetest dream. 
CHORUS. 
Moonlight at Killarney, 
While stars shown from above ; 
Oh, what bliss ! a 
loving kiss 
From hearts that beat with love. 
Oh ! moonlight at Killarney,

Oh, what bliss! a

From hearts that beat with love. 
'Tis by the margin of the lake, 
Battles have been won; 
Not by spear or sword, 
But by blarney of the tongue; 
She, I

As stars shone from above ; 
She gently smiled upon me, 
While whisp'ring words of love.

Beneath the far Australian sky an Irish exile lay ; 
The sand from out his glass of life was ebbing fast away, 
The friends who stood around his bed his eyes could scarce-
ly see ; [the sea. 
His thoughts, which soon would be at rest, were far across 
In spirit, once again he stood upon the Emerald sod, 
Which as a 
boy and as a 
man his foot had lightly trod : 
In fancy he could feel upon his brow the mountain air, 
Then from his parted lips there issued forth the exile's 
prayer. 
CHORUS. 
Lay me on the hillside, with my face towards the west— 
Towards that sacred island, ' tis the land I 
love the best ; 
Let a 
bunch of shamrocks green be planted on my grave, 
My dying prayer is, may God bless the island of the brave! 
" 
Eviction" foul and cruel sent him far across the foam, 
From that dear spot which Irishmen, where'er they be, call 
" 
home." 
The land whose halls have heard the tread of princes and 
of kings, [St rings ; 
Whose harp, which wooed the world, is now a 
mass of broken 
Whose sons were forced to leave the land which gave their 
fathers birth, 
As outcasts and as strangers, to wander o'er the earth. 
The time came back again to him, when he was but a 
child 
With mem'ries of sweet rambles thro' her woods and valleys 
wild. 
CH0.—Lay me on a 
hillside, etc. 
Each eye is wet with briny tears, his words have touched 
the heart, 
For they are exiled too, and time has failed to heal the smart. 
(In every land beneath the sky the Irish race is seen, 
But still their every thought is fixed upon the Isle of Green.) 
He calls his friends around him, for the end is drawing. near, 
And on his haggard cheek there lies a 
pearly little tear ; 
Another victim of misrule has felt the hand of death— 
" 
God bless you, Ireland!" were the words which filled his 
latest breath. 
(' HO.— Lay me on the hillside, etc.

Och, girls dear, did yon ever hear 
I 
wrote my love a 
letter? 
And althouoli he cannot read, 
thottobt ' twits all the better ; 
,For why should he be puzzled 
With hard spelling in the matter, 
'When the notning was so plain 
That I 
loved him faithfully, 
And he knows it— oh ! he knows it— 
Without one word from me. 
I 
wrote it, and I 
folded it, 
And put a 
seal upon it ; 
'Twits a 
seal almost as big 
As the crown of my best bonnet ; 
For I 
would not have the postmaster 
Make his remarks upon it, 
As I'd said inside the lett er 
That I 
loved him faithfully, 
And he knows it—oh he knows it— 
Without one word from me. 
My heart was full, but when I 
wrote 
I 
dare not put it half in ; 
The neighbors know I 
love him. 
And tney're mighty fond of chaffing ; 
So I 
dare not write his name outside, 
For fear they would be. laughing, 
SO 
I 
wrote : " From little Kate to one 
Whom she loves faithfully," 
And he knows it— oh ! he knows it— 
Without one word from Inc. 
Now, girls, would you believe it, 
That postman, 8 C0128att-d, 
No answer will he bring me, 
So long as I 
have waited ; 
But mt.ybe there mayn't be one, 
For the roson that I 
stated, 
That my love can neither read nor write, 
But loves me faithfully, 
And I 
know where'er my love is. 
That, he is true to rho.

On the seventeenth of Match I 
dressed so neat and gay, 
For to join the grand procession, I 
at once set on my way ; 
There was citizens both tall and short and ladies short and 
tall, 
All anxious for to see us march forninst the City Hall. 
There was little Michael Dooley wid a 
bran new suit of 
clothes 
That was made by' " Johnny Docherty, " who everybody 
knows ; 
Muldoon, the solid man, was there as decent as could be, 
But there wasn't one in all the crowd could stand aside of 
me.

Did you see Pat Mahone wid his shining bran new hat, 
Did you see him march along like a 
gay aristocrat ? 
There were flags and banners waving high .and dress in 
style was shown, 
But the finest man in all the crowd was Mr. Pat Mahone. 
The Mayor near by the City Hall quite stately took his stand; 
He noticed none till I 
came by and then he waved his hand. 
He saw at once the style was there, for he stared wid both his 
eyes, 
For he thought I 
was the President all dressed up in disguise. 
We marched all through the city, till I 
thought we'd never 
stop, 
And as I 
needed stimulant, I 
thought I'd take a 
drop. 
The people there were talking of the sights they'd seen that 
day, 
And I 
felt a 
little flattered when I 
beard some ladies say,

I 
received an invitation to attend a 
fancy ball, 
But without an evening suit of clothes I 
could not go at all ; 
Old " Docherty," the tailor, my measure could not take, 
Because for -Mr. Doo'ey he had got a 
suit to make. 
I 
then walked to the Bowery, bon °lit a w 
suit second hand, 
And wid a 
flower stuck in my coat I 
looked a

one remark,

Life then had no alloy; 
With such a 
truth I 
seem'd to love 
My sweetheart when a

My sweetheart when a

And yet the dream has pass'd away, 
Tho' like it lived it pass'd ; 
Each moment was too bright to stay, 
But sparkled to the last. 
There, on my heart, the beams remain 
In gay unclouded joy, 
When I 
remember her again, 
My sweetheart when a

My sweetheart when a

By the blue Alsatian mountains 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair, 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair ; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
Angel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A- de, A-de, 
Such songs will pass away ; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains 
Seem to watch and wait alway 
By the blue Alsatian mountains 
Many spring-thnes bloomed and pacsed, 
And the maiden by the f
ountai
ns 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last, 
And she withered like a 
flower 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A- de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
A-de, A-de, A- de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains,

Our messmate in his hammock lay 
The death- dew on his brow, 
And heard the dashing of the spray 
Against the vessel's prow. 
"My life is ebbing fast," he said, 
" 
Kind messmates, do not weep, 
When I 
am laid in ocean's grave, 
Committed to the deep— 
When I 
am laid in ocean's grave, 
Committed to the deep." 
CHORUS. 
Our Father, who art in Heaven, 
Hallowed be Thy name: 
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done 
On earth, as it is in Heaven. 
We pray the Lord his soul to keep, 
committed to the deep— 
We pray the Lord his soul to.keep, 
Committed to the deep. 
Oh! sink me deep beneath the surf 
Of angry heaving waves, 
And mermaids fair will chant my dirge 
In ocean's coral caves. 
No village bell will toll for me, 
No gentle maiden weep; 
Deep in the sea my grave shall be, 
Committed to the deep— 
Deep in the sea my grave shall be, 
Committed to the deep.

Let cowardly slanderers say what they will 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villanous lie in their teeth. 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity, as everybody knows— 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm ; 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Ciro.—Pat may be foolish, etc. 
Remember that Celts and the Saxons are bound 
By the ties of pure brotherly love ; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as true 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands joined in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Is not fit for a 
country so green. 
Cuo.—Pat may be foolish, etc.

I 
like honest pluck in this warfare of life. 
No matter whoever I 
meet ; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear ; 
Yet ' tis better to know you're prepared for the worst 
Than tremble like children with fear. 
CHORU S. 
I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up. 
And tell me at once what be feels ; 
I 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
Bat I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none ; 
Hard words may be used, but I 
like him the most 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong, I 
can cure the foul slander at once, 
And destroy every venomous part ; 
Yet I 
reel when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
Cao.--I do like a 
man, etc. 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can do him no good, do him no harm ; 
If you don't like backbiting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm. 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A 
good open field for the race, 
And if you have cause of complaint 'gainst a 
man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face.

Oh, my love stood under the walnut tree, 
Over the garden wall, 
She whispered and said she'd be true to me, 
Over the garden wall ; 
She'd beautiful eyes and beautiful hair, 
She was not very tall, 80 she stood on a 
chair, 
And many a 
time I 
have kissed her there, 
Over the garden wall. 
CHORUS. 
Over the garden wall, 
The sweetest girl of all, 
There never was yet such eyes of jet, 
And you may bet I'll never forget 
The night our lips in kisses met, 
Over the garden wall. 
But her father stamped, and her father raved, 
Over the garden wall, 
And like an old madmen he behaved, 
Over the garden wall. 
She made me a 
bouquet of roses red, 
But immediately I 
popped up my head, 
He gave me a 
bucket of water instead, 
Over the garden wall. 
(Mo.—Over the garden wall, etc. 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the garden wall, 
And she bravely promised to be my bride, 
Over the garden wall ; 
But she screamed in fright, " Here's father, quick ! 
I 
have an impression he's bringing a 
stick ;" 
But I 
brought the impression of half a 
brick, 
Over the garden wall. 
Cuo.—Over the garden wall, etc. 
But where there's a

Over the garden wall, 
There's always a

We hadn't much money, but weddings are cheap, 
So while the old fellow was snoring asleep, 
With a 
lad and a 
ladder she managed to creep 
Over the garden wall.

Father, please, don't drive me out in the street— 
There, among strangers, no pity to meet. 
See how poor mother is w 
eeping, I 
pray, 
And, father, for her sake, don't drive me away. 
You never speak kindly, your looks are so wild. 
Oh ! smile as you used to upon your poor child. 
Dear father, have pity, don't tell me to go 
Begging for help to- night, out in the snow. 
CHORUS. 
Ragged and hungry, alone in the street, 
Walking about in the cold and the sleet; 
Wild is the tempest, I've nowhere to go— 
What will become of me out in the snow? 
Drink no more, father, look up in my face, 
Blushing for shame at the sin and disgrace. 
Why are you always so cruel and wild ? 
Have you no love for your poor wife and child? 
Our home is so dreary, 0 
father! just think— 
You gave your last penny for something to drink ; 
And now, in my hunger, you force me- to go 
Begging for help to-night, out in the snow. 
Clla—Ragged and hungry, etc. 
Cease to abuse me, I'll do as you say; 
But first let me kneel by my mother and pray. 
Don't strike me! I'll go, with a 
heart filled with pain ; 
I 
feel that I 
never shall see you again. 
Oh ! let me kiss mother, heart- broken and lone— 
May Heaven have pity on her when I'm gone! 
If I 
die in the streets, who one tear will bestow 
On the poor wanderer, out in the snow?

Over the billows my light barque cloth ride, 
Like a 
feather ' tis tossed on the turbulent tide, 
Yet proudly rising upon the wave's crest, 
She defies the wild waters that foam on her breast. 
Yo Ito swifter now we sail; 
Yo ho! higher blows the gale. 
Father above, in Thee I 
trust, 
More than a 
mother, love Thee I 
must ; 
Oh, let Thy power the flood assuage 
And save me from the tempest's rage ; 
Glide o'er the sea, my faithful boat, 
To that dear shore where we lightly float. 
Haste! for my heart to thee would fly, 
My barque for thee already is nigh. 
CHORUS. 
When starry eyes look on the sea, 
My weary heart still longs for thee ; 
Alas ! that I 
afar must rove 
From thee my queen, my life, my love. 
When lonely watching at night on the main, 
I 
discern the black tempest advancing on high, 
I 
laugh at the storm fiend, and fear I 
disdain, 
Thy love gives me courage all ills to defy. 
Yo ho! as the storm grows loud ; 
Yo ho ! still more sail we crowd. 
Santa Maria, in thee I 
trust, 
More than a 
mother, love thee I 
must, 
Oh, let thy power the flood assuage, 
And save me from the tempest's rage. 
What matters now to me the wind, 
If it but waft me to where I 
find 
My loved one waiting, waiting for me; 
My love, my angel, sainted one for me.

dozen children, quite proud of them am I, 
And some are influential and hold positions high ; 
Oh, I 
have lovely daughters,that can't be denied, 
They wear their silks and satins and in a 
carriage ride ; 
There is Larry, Ted, and Owney, with Terence, Dan, and 
Mike, 
All elegant, and scholars, you never saw the like ; 
But the youngest is our Patrick, he's worst of all, you 
see, 
For he's travelling with a 
circus, an actor man to be. 
CHORUS. 
Our Patrick is an actor, he wears the finest clothes, 
The ladies all admire him, no matter where he goes ; 
A diamond on his shirt- front, a 
lump the size of that, 
It's folly to deny it, a 
dandy is our Pat. 
When he's home upon a 
visit, the neighbors far and near 
Extend an invitation to have cigars and beer; 
I'll cook corned beef and cabbage to have a 
lovely meal, 
But Patsy doesn't touch it, so dainty does he feel ; 
But he'll 
eat ice cream and oysters, blanc mange and 
custard pie, 
It's the style he learns from actors, they're always living 
high; 
But in spite of all his manners, a word for him we'll 
speak, 
He ne'er forgets his parents ,with money every week.

By the sweet ties of love forever blest.

love so

You ne'er will forget me, though waves roll between us, 
Your image will follow wherever I

Safe in your arms, love, again ne'er to go; 
Then will our days be the bright days of sunshine, 
Safe in the land where the shamrock does grow.

Little empty cradle, treasured now with care, 
Though thy precious burden it has fled; 
How we miss the locks of curly golden hair 
Peeping from thy tiny, snow-white bed. 
When the dimpled cheeks and little laughing eyes 
From the rumpled pillow shone, 
Then I 
gazed with gladness, now I 
look and sigh; 
Empty is the cradle—baby's gone. 
CHORUS . 
Baby left her cradle for the golden shore; 
O'er the silvery waters she has flown; 
Gone to join the angels peaceful evermore; 
Empty is the cradle—baby's gone. 
As with beating heart I 
looked upon her form 
Many hours upon that silent night, 
Hoping to the last, but still at early dawn 
Her spirit fled to join those realms of light. 
Often do I 
fancy I 
see that little face, 
Life to me of pleasure it has shorn, 
With tearful eyes I 
gaze upon that vacant place— 
Empty is the cradle—baby's gone. 
C110.—Baby left her cradle, etc. 
Near a 
shady valley stands a 
grassy mound; 
Underneath my little darling sleeps ; 
Blossoms sweet and roses cluster all around, 
Overhead the willow silent weeps. 
There I 
laid my loved one in the long ago 
And my heart does sadly mourn; 
Though she's with the angels, still I 
fain would weep; 
Empty is the cradle—baby's gone.

Ohl father's gone to market town— 
He was up before the day, 
And Jamie's after robins' nests. 
And the man is making hay; 
And whistling down the hollow goes 
The boy that minds the mill, 
While mother, from the kitchen door. 
Is calling with a 
will: 
Polly ! Polly! the cows are in the corn ! 
Polly ! Polly! the cows are in the corn I 
From all the misty morning air 
There comes a 
summer sound, 
A 
murmur, as of waters, comes 
From ships, and trees, and ground; 
The birds they sing upon the wing, 
The pigeons bill and coo, 
And over hills and hollow rings 
Again the loud halloo! 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn I 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn! 
How strange at such a 
time of day 
The mill should stop its clatter; 
The farmer's wife is list'ning now, 
And wonders what's the matter. 
Oh! wild the birds are singing in 
The woodland on the hill, 
While whistling up the hollow goes 
The boy that minds the mill. 
Polly! Polly ! the cows are in the corn !

We trod the old paths that we knew 
Ere absence had caused us to sigh.

A 
merry and mirth-loving throng, 
With links of relationship dear, 
To bind us life's pathway along.

I 
saw the sweet smile that you wore, 
As we gazed on the friends that we knew, 
I

That told of a

And long did that pleasure remain, 
And joyous each spirit did seem. 
Oh, vision, return once again, 
Or quickly fulfilled be my dream.

There's a 
little white cottage half hid by the trees, 
Where in summer the roses they perfume the breeze 
And the song of the nightingale singing its lay 
Fills the woodland with music at close of the day. 
A 
little white face at the window is seen, 
'Tis my wife's happy smile—of my heart she's the queen; 
And I 
always shall love her, wherever I 
roam, 
Little Nellie, the light of my home I 
CHORUS. 
Her eyes are like diamonds, her face is so fair, 
And a 
little pale rose decks her bonny brown hair ; 
Oh, I 
always shall love her, wherever I 
roam, 
Little Nelly, the light of my home. 
On the floor there's a 
baby, that's just turning three, 
And the little voice whispers, " Come, Papa, take me ;" 
Then a 
soft, silken arm round my neck is entwined, 
With a 
kiss from my Nelly, so good and so kind. 
I 
care not for riches while she's by my side, 
And I 
oft bless the day that I 
made her my bride; 
For no matter what trials or sorrow may come, 
I 
shall always love Nelly, my own I 
Cito.—Her eyes are like, etc.

Ohoi yeho, ho yelio, who's for the ferry 
(The briar's in bud, the sun going down), 
And I'll row ye so quick, and I'll row ye so steady, 
And ' tis but a 
penny to Twickenham town. 
The ferryman's slim, and the ferryman's young, 
And he's just a 
soft twang in the turn of his tongue, 
And he's fresh as a 
pippin, and brown as a 
berry, 
And ' tis but a 
penny to Twickenham town. 
Ohoi yeho, ho yeho, " I'm for the ferry " 
(The briar's in bud, the sun going down). 
And it's late as it is, and I 
haven't a 
penny, 
And how shall I 
get me to Twickenham town 
She'd a 
rose in her bonnet, and oh, she look'd sweet 
As the little pink flower that grows in the wheat, 
With her cheeks like a 
rose and her lips like, a 
cherry, 
" 
And sure and you're welcome to Twickenham town." 
Ohol yelto, ho ! you're too late for the ferry 
(The briar's in bud, the sun going down), 
And he's not rowing quick, and he's not rowing steady--
You'd think ' twas a 
journey to Twickenham town. 
" 
Ohoi and Oho," you may call as you will, 
The moon is a 
rising on Petersham Hill, 
And with love like a 
rose in the stern of the wherry, 
There's danger in crossing to Twickenham town.

Once I 
loved a 
yaller girl, she said she'd marry me;* 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny, Ho my Jenny Johnson! 
Saw her eating apples at a 
huckleberry bee, 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny Johnson 
Took her to a 
ball and we never did get back 
Till the breaking of the morn, when you hear the chickens 
quack; 
She wouldn't take the cars, so I 
took her in a 
hack; 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny Johnson I 
CHORUS. 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny, come along with me, 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny, Ho my Jenny Johnson, 
Sweeter than the honey at a 
huckleberry bee, 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny Johnson. 
Oh, my darling Jenny, she's the sweetest girl in town, 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny, Ho my Jenny Johnson! 
Captivates the neighborhood for miles and miles around, 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny Johnson! 
Said she loved another, and it broke my heart in two, 
And I 
had to get it mended with a 
little piece of glue; 
She gave me back my locket and a 
little silver shoe; 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny Johnson! 
Cno.—Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny, etc. 
Now my Jenny's married to a 
little yaller coon, 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny, Ho my Jenny Johnson! 
'rake care for Jenny's hubby, for he'd kill you mighty 
soon, 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny Johnson ! 
Woolly-headed picaninnies running roun' de floor, 
For they say there's only two, but I 
wish dey had a 
score ; 
I'm gwine away to China, so Pll never see her more : 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny Johnson!

In days of old, when knights were bold, 
And barons held their sway, 
A 
warrior bold, with spurs of gold, 
Sang merrily his lay, sang merrily his lay. 
My love is young and fair, 
My love hath golden hair, 
And eyes so blue, and heart so true, 
That none with her compare ; 
So what care I 
tho' death be nigh, 
I'll live for love, or die. 
So this brave knight, in armor bright, 
Went gayly to the fray ; 
He fought the fight, but ere the night, 
His soul had passed away, his soul had passed away. 
The plighted ring he wore, 
Was crushed and wet with gore, 
Yet ere he died, he bravely cried 
I've kept the vow I 
swore; 
So what care I 
tho' death be nigh— 
I've fought for love, and die.

I 
stood on the bridge at midnight, 
As the clock was striking the hour, 
And the moon rose o'er the city, 
Behind the dark church tower, 
And, like the waters rushing 
Among the wooden piers, 
A 
flood of thoughts came o'er me, 
That filled mine eyes with tears 
How often, oh, how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
Iliad stood on that bridge at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky! 
How often, oh, how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stood on that bridge at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky! 
How often, oh, how often, 
I 
had wished that that ebbing tide 
Would bear me away on its bosom, 
O'er the ocean wild and wide. 
For my heart was hot and restless, 
And my life was full of care, 
And the burthen laid upon me 
Seemed greater than I 
could bear. 
But now it has fallen from me, 
It is buried in the sea, 
And only the sorrow of others 
Throws its shadow over me. 
Yet whenever I 
cross the river, 
On its bridge with wooden -piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the ocean 
Comes the thought of other years : 
And forever and forever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passions, 
As long as life has woes, 
The moon and its broken reflection 
And its shadows shall appear, 
As a 
symbol of love in heaven, 
And its wavering image here.

Like a 
dream ye come to cheer me, 
Hound me echoed soft and low, 
Still your mem'ries linger near me, 
Chiming bells of long ago ! 
Sweetly fell your silv'ry numbers, 
Down the still and fragrant air; 
Woke my soul from gentle slumbers 
List'ning to your echoes fair 
Friends and hopes of happy childhood 
Blest me in their purest glow ; 
Softly rang o'er grove and wildwood, 
Chiming bells of long ago! 
CHORUS. 
Sweet chiming bells! sweet chiming bells! 
Ye murmur soft and low 
Sweet chiming bells ! sweet chiming bells I 
Sweet bells of long ago! 
Happy visions rose before me, 
Brightest that my heart could know 
Still your spell is ling'ring near me, 
Chiming bells of long ago! 
Sweetly now your notes are falling 
O'er my heart so Fad and lone; 
Mein'ry from the past is calling 
Dreams that once I 
called my own ; 
Visions of my dear ones only 
Bless me now at evening's glow; 
Oh ! ye cheer my life so lonely, 
Chiming bells of long ago!

WHO WOULD SAY A WORD AGAINST OLD 
IRELAND?

When first the Saxon conqueror 
Invaded Erin's shore, 
The Irish did not calmly yield, 
But struggled o'er and o'er. 
Tho' craven-tongued throughout the land 
May utter words of spleen, 
Saint Patrick's chosen people 
Never sullied Erin's green. 
CHORUS. 
There's open-handed friendship for every stranger there, 
There's bright-eyed little colleens with beauty rich and 
rare. 
Should poverty oppress you, each man will give his share— 
Then who should say a 
word against old Ireland ? 
My blood with indignation boils 
At what I 
often hear : 
Poor Paddy here, poor Paddy there. 
Is uttered with a 
sneer. 
He may be poor in worldly wealth, 
And lack the shining gold, 
But rich in honest friendship, and 
In courage true and bold. 
Cuo.—There's open-handed, etc. 
Where'er the human foot has trod 
The Irishman is seen, 
His thoughts for ever, day and night, 
Are with his " land of green," 
So drink, each Irishman, to- night 
This toast along with me, 
May she never be worse off than now, 
" 
Old Erin," " Gra Machree." 
Cuo.—There's open-handed, etc.

I'm a 
jovial sort of man, 
That you can plainly see, 
I 
lead an active son of life, 
And nothing troubles me ; 
I'm happy as the day is long, 
All cares I 
cast away, 
I 
always feel so jolly, 
And sing and say each day, 
CHOI-
ZITS. 
I 
love to sit by the fire so bright 
At home on a 
cold and winter's night, 
With my children on my knee, 
Then my heart is full of glee, 
As 
smoking my old clay pipe. 
I 
have a 
charming little wife, 
And children full of glee, 
Their sweet and prattling voices are 
Such joy and bliss to me. 
I 
love my dog, I 
love my gun, 
I'm happy day and night, 
And when my daily toil is o'er 
I 
keep tny pipe alight. 
CH0.--I 
love to sit, etc. 
'We may have diffrent tastes, 
And difrrent whims and ways, 
And though our path of life be rough, 
We may see brighter days. 
We 
oft build castles in the air, 
We often crack a 
joke, 
But at the finish all will end 
Without a 
doubt in smoke. 
Cn0.--I love to sit, etc.

Homeless, ragged and tanned, 
Under the changeful sky, 
Who so free in the land? 
Who so contented as I ? 
Never need I 
quake 
Lest fortune prove unkind, 
Never my heart break 
That vows have ceased to bind. 
Not even a 
dog 
Would I 
call by friendship's name; 
Lonely I 
jog, 
E'en thither whence I 
came. 
CHORUS. 
Homeless, ragged and tanned, 
Under the changeful sky, 
Who so free in the land? 
Who so contented as I? 
Nursed by hunger and want, 
Taught out of Nature's page, 
Banned by saintliest cant, 
Scorning hypocrisy's wage. 
Singing, I 
plod by wayward fancy led, 
Trusting in God, who the sparrows still hath fed. 
! 
let me die— ere be the world's base thrall, 
Fate I 
defy—to-morrow ne'er recall. 
Cita—Homeless, ragged, etc. 
Once tender love watched at my side, 
Now from above her angels may guide: 
When Heaven above asks my last breath, 
Angel-love smile on the vagabond's death, 
Smile on the vagabond's death. 
Ah! Homeless, ragged and tanned, 
Under the changeful sky, 
Who so free in the land? 
Who so contented as I ? 
('no.—Homeless, ragged, etc.

Far away in the South, among the cotton- fields, 
Is the place I 
ever long to see; 
Oh! the dear, sunny clime, where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me! 
Oh ! the mocking- bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam ; 
In this wide, weary world, wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHOW'S. 
Then give me a home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still. 
Then I 
sigh night and day ; I 
long to see again 
That old log-cabin on the hill. 
Oh! the ones I 
loved are sleeping in the ground, 
While I 
ant passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad, I 
long to return— 
Oh! the old man ain't what he used to be ; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
'Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh ; 
Oh ! I 
will go back again, back to them cotton- fields ; 
In that old cabin home, there let me die. 
Cno.—Then give me, etc.

I'm out in the cold and I 
can't. get in— 
Os- 
I've turned my back on wicked sin; 
De pass-word's lost, what shall I 
do? 
I'm thro' de key-hole peeking; 
clim' up de stairs in the early morn— 
I'm de fust dat heard ole Gabriel's horn, 
But de gate is shut and de hour is late, 
I'm standing here a 
knocking. 
CHORUS. 
Knock— knock, but I 
have got to wait 
Till Peter brings de keys. 
Open up that gate. 
Knock—knock, I 
want to get good boarding— 
Dat's why I'm knocking, knocking, knocking 
At de gates of Jordan. 
De jay- bird hopped on de orange tree, 
De wasp insulted de bumble-bee, 
Which goes to show dis world is made 
For folks to fret and grumble. 
I 
greased my shoes with the oil of hope, 
And I 
clutched de end of de heavenly rope; 
I 
was hoisted up to de main-top gaff, 
While de sinners had to stumble. 
Cllo.—Knock—knock, etc. 
I'll clean my robes wid golden soap, 
I'll sit on a 
cloud wid a 
telescope, 
To watch de stragglers a climb de stairs, 
And try and reach de landing; 
But de way is slippery as isinglass, 
And Peter's a 
hard ole man to pass, 
For he wants de grip and your history too, 
Or your head he'll be expanding. 
CH0.—Knock—knock, etc.

East Lynne; or, The Earl's Daughter. 
Li-
brary - edition, complete and unabridged. 
This novel is Mrs. 
Henry Wood's masterpiece, and stands in the very front rank of 
all the works of fiction ever written; it has scarcely a 
rival as a 
brilliant creation of literary genius, and is prominent among the 
very few works of its class that have stood the test of time, and 
achieved a lasting reputation. 
In originality o4: 
design, and 
masterly and dramatic development of the subject, East Lynne
