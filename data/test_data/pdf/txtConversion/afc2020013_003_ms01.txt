Movement over to asphalt and full size asphalt cars from about 15 to 20 
Getting into dirt modifieds around age 20 
Description of different classes 
Not necessary / not one class lower than other in terms of moving onto another 
class, some people decide to stay just in one class 
Deciding to stop running asphalt, having a backup plan (went to college for 
business) 
Being able to run dirt modifieds (professionally) as his main source of income / 
for a living 
Does other things around racing, like fixing up shops or working on other

Falls  
Similarities and differences across different manufacturers

where its used, and contrast with Jersey and downstate 
Power to weight ratio 
Being seated in the center of the car in a dirt modified compared to a road car (4 
banger), and how high the modified motors can push 
TQ Midget class ran on asphalt 
Feels that dirt is harder to race because of the way you take corners

Discussion of race day routine, starting with arrival 
Difference in racing at Ransomville, where will stick around after and see / talk 
with folks he grew up with, in contrast with other tracks where would finish, 
and then pack up and head home or onto next track 
Planning out his year on what tracks he’ll be racing at when, by march and april

Covid impacting as some tracks ran and others didn’t  
 
[23:10]   
Offseason Work 
Working on the car everyday, including in November, with next dirt race not 
until end of January 
Looking after equipment and getting ready for next year, not just the racing stuff 
but the other things like upgrading a trailer to a longer one 
Rebuilding engine or transmission in the offseason if needed, some work done 
on their own but some stuff (like transmissions) they don’t do on own 
Used to do engine stuff but not as much now, and Dad on the crew works about 
every day, is retired (mostly) from his main job  
 
[26:45]   
Racing Skills 
Talent is a part of it, but a lot of it is experience 
Being taught the ‘right way’ to do things (like maintain a car part) versus the 
wrong way 
Learning from dad and grandpa 
From experience also knowing when to change lanes, how to approach a corner 
Dirt races having a lot of movement, and always lane changes, where 
NASCAR/asphalt is mostly staying in same lane 
Knowing when to run bottom or top, as cars aren’t always tuned the same way 
 
[30:05]

Falling behind on general maintenance 
Life events 
Major time commitment 
 
[31:05]   
Racing Skills (continued) 
Description of how a race develops in a 100 lap race, contrasted with a 30 lap 
race where just trying to go fast as can 
Strategy and long-game, and balancing not gaining positions but also not losing 
position 
Being able to understand where other drivers might be better than you, and 
where you might be better than them 
Knowing a little bit of work can prevent a lot of breaking / damage 
 
[34:55]   
Overview of Modfieds (continued)  
No major developments from when he started, in terms of geometry still same 
centered and front end 
Rear end of modifieds little different now, with example being moving from bars 
to coils 
 
[37:00]   
Gear with Modifieds 
Not liking the idea of using goPros or helmet cams, feels like it’s bad ‘juju’ 
Helmets a long time ago were a bit different, but he’s had the same helmet for 
about ten years 
Suits pretty similar, slightly lighter 
Helmets come in some different configurations, felt that the ‘shape of his head’ 
fit that helmet better, and doesn’t jazz up helmet too much (did paint it one time) 
 
 
 
[39:00]   
Memorable Races 
Winning at Syracuse (which doesn’t exist anymore), first time ever in a 
Sportsman, and winning in Atlantic City in the TQs. 
With the dirt modifieds, there’s few that stick in mind: biggest being in 2019 up 
in Quebec and then at Eldora in Ohio, one of the most famous in the world. 
Eldora having lot of prestige 
Lot of prestigious races haven’t won yet, like Super Dirt Week in Oswego 
 
[42:25]  
Track Performance and Familiarity 
Having certain tracks you are ‘good at’ and other tracks not good at 
Getting better at those tracks through exposure 
Typically being strong at Ransomville, Canandaigua, and Rome  
In typical year might race at 30 different tracks 
 
[44:15]   
Customs 
No major customs, only thing before a race out of the standard is maybe 
pumping his inhaler 
 
[45:00]   
Enjoyment in Racing and Looking Forward 
Enjoys being able to travel around and see different parts of the US, in terms of 
being able to race professionally and travel 
Enjoys driving the modifieds in general; that it’s a “fun thing to do” 
2021 looking to get out there and compete at an ever higher level 
Becoming consistent in terms of performance and race records 
 
[48:00]   
Reflecting on Wrecks 
Haven’t had any major wrecks, except for flipping a car and bending the frame; 
that time being driver mistake and other times can be track 
Sometimes there’s accidents ahead of you that might not have anything to do 
with you and you end up getting caught up in it and damaging your vehicle 
In a wreck focus is really on just keeping yourself safe, and because of how the 
cars are designed with the frames and that generally nothing too bad happens 
 
[50:00]   
Closing Advice and Thoughts 
Important to manage expectations and set personal goals, don’t go for too high 
too soon 
Expensive running modifieds and financial side of racing is really tough 
especially if not consistently performing 
Racing is a family thing, and it’s a good way to keep kids active, teaching 
responsibility and keeping them occupied especially racing karts
