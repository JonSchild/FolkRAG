Music by H. P. Thsanis. 
DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to-day; 
Life is fading fast away; 
But, my darling, you will be—will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes! my darling, you. will be 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS . 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away. 
When your hair is 9ilver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say— 
" 
Oh, my darling, mine alone--alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes! my darling, mine alone, 
You have never older grown! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old; 
Locks may lose their brown and gold, 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know.. 
Never, never winter's frost and chill; 
Summer's warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost aind chill, 
Summer's warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair— 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below 7 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc.

THE LOVE-BIRD'S KISS. 
Words by L. H. F. DU TERREAUX. 
Music by GEORGES JACOBI. 
The Music of this song is published by W M. A. Perm & Co., 547 Broadway, 
New York City. 
Price 30 cents. 
HIGH in my window two love-birds 
Hung in their cage for a 
summer long; 
Their passion had not the relief of words. 
And they did not appear to know a 
song; 
But there they nestled upon the perch, 
Beak to beak in a 
loveable way, 
Like two young lovers just fresh from church, 
And a 
look in their eyes that seemed to say— 
CHORUS. 
Hours go by, 
Let them fly, * * 
We'll mark them with a 
kiss. 
Hours go by, 
Let them fly, * 
The time we pass in kissing, 
The time we pass in kissing 
Is time we never miss. * 
My birds' example spread far and wide; 
There in the window they kiss'd and coo'd, 
'Till it soften'd the hearts of folks outside, 
And quite affected the neighborhood ; 
And love grew in fashion more and yet more; 
All thro' the terrace flirtation so rag'd, 
That no one of twenty, few of two score, 
But was either just wed or else engaged. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss and coo, 
1 
and you, 
Take our delight in this. 
Kiss and coo, 
I 
and you, 
To share a 
perch together, 
To share a 
perch together, 
And kiss and kiss and kiss. 
My aged granny, a 
prim old dame, 
Was wholly perturb'd at their wooing ways: 
What forward things, I 
am fill'd with shame. 
No birds so acted in my young days, 
Their brazen immodesty pray disown, 
And send the creatures at once to roost; 
You ought to provide them a 
chaperone, 
, 
And see them properly introduced. 
Kiss and coo, etc. 
(I)

TrIF LOVE-BIRD'S KISS.—conciuded. 
At last came some one too see the birds; 
Somebody came, I 
won't tell who, 
But he begted them of me with pleading words; 
Ask'd for them and their mistress too: 
And some how, I 
and that foolish man, 
Tho' how it happen'd I 
cannot swear, 
Agreed to follow the Love-bird's plan, 
And make two couples instead of a 
pair. 
Kiss and coo, etc. 
KISS, KISS. 
The Music of this song is published by G. D. 
RUSSELL & CO., 126 Tremont 
St., Boston, Mass. 
Price 50 cents. 
Wiro bath not felt when sad and lone 
The magnetic pressure of a 
hand 7 
The music of a 
friendly tone. 
We all the charm well understand! 
But there's a 
rapture deeper, dearer, 
Love's symbol and its seal of bliss, 
When hearts and lips come nearer, nearer, 
And language melts into a 
kiss! 
CHORUS. 
Ail 
Leaves on the tree, 
Flow'r and the bee! 
To the waters glowing, winds are kisses blowing! 
Matron and maid, 
None are afraid, * 
Sign of all our earthly bliss is this, a 
kiss; 
Tho' many a 
false kiss bath been given! 
Tho' many a 
lip bath feign'd its love! 
A 
kiss came none the less from heaven. 
It must be right, ' tis done'above! 
Affection bath no image purer. 
Then if a 
maid be over coy, 
Let this reflection reassure her, 
That angels quite approve the joy 7 
Ah! Leaves, etc.

I'M getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no more; 
I've laid de rusty-bladed hoe to rest; 
Ole maasa an' ole miss's am dead, dey're sleepin' side by side; 
Deir spirits now are roaming wid de blest! 
De scene am changed about de place, de dailies am all gone; 
I'll nebber hear dem singing in de cane, 
And I'se de only one dat's left wid dis ole dog ob mine, 
In de little old log cabin in de lane. 
CLIOBtrig. 
De chimney's falling down an' de roof is cavin' in; 
I 
ain't got long round here to remain; 
But de angels watches over me when I 
lays down to sleep 
In de little old log cabin in de lane. 
Dar was a 
happy time to me, ' twas many years ago, 
When de darkies used to gather round de door; 
When dey used to dance an' sing at night I 
played the old banjo, 
But alas, I 
cannot play it any more. 
De hinges dey got rusted an' de door has tumbled down, 
And de roof lets in do sunshine an' de rain, 
An' de only friend I've got now is dis good ole dog ob mine, 
In de little old log cabin in de lane. 
De chimney's falling down, etc. 
De foot- path now is covered o'er dat led us round de hill, 
And de fences all are going to decay, 
An' de creek is all dried up where we used to go to mill; 
De time has turned its course anodder way ; 
But I 
ain't got long to stay here, an' what little time I 
got 
I'll try and be contented to remain, 
Till death shall call my dog an' me to find a 
better home 
Dan dat little old log cabin in do lane.

My heart ever longs to be there, 
To meet her, my darling, my own,

To meet her, my darling, my own, 
Sweet Jennie, the flow'r of Kildare. 
The flow'r of Kildare, the flow'r of Kildare, 
Sweet Jennie, the flow'r of Kildare. 
I'm waiting her sweet face to see; 
While we're parted I 
linger in pain, 
But soon will my heart beat with joy, 
O'er the sea I'll be sailing again, 
Again her sweet kisses of love to receive ; 
For her the sea's storms I 
will dare, 
To meet her, my darling, my own, 
Sweet Jennie, the flow'r of Kildare. 
I 
know that she's waiting, etc.

The place I 
left to wander the day that I 
was free; 
I'se getting old and weary, and tired of roaming too, 
So on my way to Dixie I'll say good-bye to you. 
CHORUS. 
I'se trabling back, yes trabling back, 
I'se trabling back night and day, 
I'se trabling back to Georgia, 
I'se trabling night and day, 
l'se trabling back to Georgia, 
For I 
cannot keep away. 
I'se trabling back to Georgia, the place where I 
was born, 
Among the fields of cotton, the sugar cane and corn, 
So happy with old Massa, a-living in the lane; 
To see de ole plantation l'se trabling back again." 
I'se trabling back, etc. 
I'se trabling back to Georgia, to see the darkeys there, 
And see my old Aunt Dinah—oh, golly, wont she stare; 
We'll dance all night till morning by the banjo's sweet refrain, 
And have a 
celebration, when I 
get back again. 
Use trabling back, etc.

OH ! POOR OLD MAN. 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT 31. DEWITT.) 
CHARACTERS—UNCLE BILLY, PETE, JAKE, JOE and JD!. 
lireS8 to 
suit the performers. 
[Scene, a room. 
PETE, JAKE, JOE and Jim discovered. 
Banjo hanging on the wall.] 
PETE.—Joe, can't you take down the old Cremona once 
more, and let's have one more dance before we go? 
Just to 
get your hand in. 
JOE.—Don't care if I 
do. 
Anything to keep up the racket, 
[Takes down banjo.] Now, boys, give us the heel-taps. [Plays 
and JAKE, PETE and JI.Zrf dance.] 
PETE.—Play that tune Uncle Billy used to freeze to. [JoE 
plays the air, " Oh, Poor Old Man," at first pretty briskly, gra-
dually more and more slowly and faintly.] 
Jim.—That makes a 
feller's eyes water. 
How I 
wish old 
Uncle Bill was here. 
He used to love to be with the boys. 
JOE. 
Uncle Bill ? 
Why, he must be done gone long ago. 
I 
think I 
see him now. How he could sing, too. 
He went 
away five years ago last Christmas eve. 
Just five years ago 
to-night. 
JAKE.—Why, he taught me the first step I 
ever knew. 
PETE.—Yes, and me too. 
They couldn't beat him much on 
heel and toe-ology. 
Could they, Jakey? 
JAKE.—Not much. 
PETE.—Then he was so good-natured. 
JOE.—What tricks we used to play on the old man. 
JARE.—Yes; do you remember when we filled an old hat 
with bricks, and turned it upside down on the ground before 
Uncle Billy's door ? 
He made a 
kick at it., and then you ought 
to have heard him squeal. 
Ha! ha! 
ALL—Ha: ha! 
3-pt.—But he was so good-natured. 
JOE. — Then do you remember how well we fooled him with 
th , dinner horn? 
P ETE. - -Yes ; when we filled it up with mud. 
.TOE.—Ha! ha! 
Who ever saw such a 
face when he got 
through blowing! 
JAKE. —'Twas a 
see him once more. 
shame to worry the old man. 
I'd like to 
(

OH I POOR OLD MAN.--[CoynNuED.] 
PETE. — Wouldn't it be a 
joke if he was to walk into this 
room, of all the nights in the year, this very Christmas eve? 
JIM.— Don't ; you make me shudder. 
JOE.—Oh, you can't scare me. 
I 
aint afraid of ghosts; are 
you, Jake? 
; 
wouldn't run for an army of 'em. 
ALL—Guess not. 
JAKE.—Anyhow, not from such a 
good-natured ghost as 
Uncle Billy. 
Why, be wouldn't hurt a 
fly. 
[Knock heard 
outside.] 
ALL (
startled).—Who that ? 
[Knock repeated.] 
JIM.—Who—who—who's that knocking at the kitchen 
door? 
JoE.—I aint a 
bit frightened; but I'm gone down the street. 
Good bye, boys. 
[Exit JoE.] 
ALL.-0h, he's a 
coward. [Knock out 
Jar.—Pm a 
good mind to follow Joe. 
I 
hate to let him go 
alone. 
Not that I'm a 
bit scared. 
Oh, no! 
PETE.—That must be Uncle Billy's ghost! I—I—I 
think 
I'll leave you, Jake, to keep him company. 
JAKE.—Not if I 
know myself. 
No ghosts .for me. 
Let's go 
together. 
[Exit PETE and JAKE.] 
[Air of "Poor Old Man" played plaintively as UNCLE BILL 
enters.] 
UNCLE BILL (
looking round).—Nobody home? I 
thought 
I 
heard voices. 
Can it be possible that these old ears of mine 
have deceived me? I've been away from home just five years 
this very Christmas eve. 
Ah, that's a 
long time to wander up 
and down the world. 
Maybe the folks are all dead. 
Shouldn't 
wonder. 
Most time for the old man to turn up his toes to the 
roots of the daisies. 
I 
suppose I'm forgotten. 
[Lays down his 
valise.] 
Everything looks so natural. [Sees banjo.] 
Ah, they 
aint all dead here! 
[
Plays.] 
My old fingers haven't forgot-
ten their old game yet. 
[Enter PETE, JAKE, JIM and JOE, each shoring and hiding 
behind the other.] 
PETE.—That's Uncle Billy or his ghost. 
JAKE.—Ghosts don't play banjos, do they? 
(

OH! POOR OLD MAN.—[CONTINUED.] 
Jim.—Never beard one before. 
Did you? 
JOE. — Never. 
Sartin sure. 
UNCLE BILL.—Why, there's the boys! 
Don't ye know your 
old friend, Uncle Billy ? 
ALL— Uncle Billy! 
Alive and well! 
UNCLE BILL—Never felt better in my life, barrin' a 
little 
rumatiz. 
[All shake hands with UNCLE BILL] 
JAKE.—W hy, we took you for a 
ghost. 
JIM.— How d'ye do, Uncle Billy ? 
JOE.—Why, you came very nigh scaring us. 
PETE.—Old man, how do you find yourself? Where have 
you been ? 
UNCLE BILLY.-011, I've wandered up and down a 
heap 
since I 
saw you. 
But I'm as good and as fine as a 
cotton hat,

OH! POOR OLD VIAN.—{CONCLUDED.] 
And when I 
grew up I 
was sent to a 
school. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
Cos I 
couldn't learn they said I 
was a 
fool. 
Oh 1 
poor old man! 
My skin was white, and I 
was fair before they took to teaching me; 
I 
always cried, and never tried to learn my alphabet; 
I 
used to drink the ink, I 
think, as they were always beating me, 
'Twas through my skin the ink worked in, and made me black as 
jet. 
Oh! b'lieve me, &c. 
I 
had many sweethearts when I 
was young and strong. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
But now all the girls laugh and say go along. 
Oh I 
poor old man! 
I 
once did love a 
pretty girl, and promised I 
would marry her, 
I 
bought the ring, and everything was ready for the day; 
And when the day arrived I 
called, and hope to church I'd carry 
her, 
She'd slop'd, elop'd, gone, done, and run with another man away. 
Oh 1 
blieve me, drre. 
If I 
had the cash I 
would treat you all round. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
But in my pockets not a 
penny to be found. 
Oh! poor old mall! 
But listen while I 
tell you what my little brother Jimmy did, 
He borrowed all my money for to speculate, you know; 
He put it in a 
bank whose liabilities was limited, 
'Twas very rash, the bank went smash, and settled my poor hash. 
Oh I 
blieve me, &c. 
My story is done, so now I'll go away. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
For nobody here seems to mind what I 
say. 
Oh! poor old man I 
Well, now you know my woes, I 
s'pose you feel inclined to pity 
me, 
I 
guess you must confess that I'm the unluckiest of men. 
But, oh, I 
see you don't mind me, but just want to get rid o' me, 
Well, anyhow I'm going DOW, but I 
will come again. 
Oh! blieve me, &c.

ARMY SO GRAND. 
Music by JOHN BRAISAM. 
Published by G. D. RUSSELL & 
Co., 126 Tremont St., Boston. 
I'm a 
gay vivandiere, yes, a 
gay vivandiere, 
And the pet of the army so grand; 
I 
march t the drum, to the tune of the drum, 
And halt at our Colonel's command; 
In the light bivouac, round the camp fire at night, 
We sing in such sweet harmony; 
Aye, bravo they shout, while the guard turn out, 
And join in the wild harmony. 
CHORUS . 
Then mark time to the band in the army so true, 
In the army so fearless, so fearless, so true, 
Who fight for the right, regardless of might, 
And our banner the red, white, and blue. 
I'm joyous and free as a 
lark in the sky, 
And the life of a 
soldier adore; 
The officers oft throw sheep's eyes at me, 
But a 
lad in the ranks I 
love more; 
He's the pride of my heart, so nobby and smart, 
And the best in the regimerxt to-day; 
When his time does expire then we will retire, 
Get married, and live on half pay. 
SPOREN.—Not altogether on half pay, for he will have a 
nice 
little cottage and farm, and raise all our own vegetables; but 
we will never forget our military life and discipline, when we 
used to— 
WHAT I 
LIVE FOR. 
As sung by the LucA BROTHERS. 
I 
live for those that love me, 
For these who know me true; 
For the heaven that smiles above me, 
And waits my spirit too; 
For the human ties that bind me, 
For the task by God assigned me, 
For the bright hopes left behind me, 
And the good that I 
can do. 
I 
live to learn their story 
Who suffered for my sake; 
To emulate their glory, 
And follow in their wake: 
Bards, patriots, martyrs, sages— 
The noblest of all ages— 
Whose deeds crown history's pages, 
And Time's great volume make. 
I 
live to hail that season, 
By gifted minds foretold, 
, 
When man shall rule by reason, 
And not alone by gold; 
When man to man united, 
And every wrong thing righted, 
The whole world shall be lighted, 
As Eden was of old. 
I 
live to hold communion 
With all that is divine; 
To feel there is a 
union 
'Twist Nature's heart and mine; 
To profit by affliction, 
Reap truths from fields of fiction, 
Grow wiser from conviction, 
And fulfill each grand design. 
So I 
live for those who love me, 
For those who know toe true, 
For the heaven that smiles above me, 
And waits my spirit too; 
For the cause that lacks assistance, 
For the wrong that needs resistance, 
For the bright hopes in the distance, 
And the good that I 
can do.

PETERS, 599 Broadway, New York.

As you are all aware, 
I 
love to dress and cut a

My heart is never sad, 
I

To keep my spirits glad.

And well I

The other day I

He offered me his arm, 
lie talked so sweet, we walked so slow, 
He worshipped every charm; 
He spoke his heartfelt love for me 
In words I 
cannot tell. 
"Pray stop," said I, " for don't you see 
That I'm the Female Swell." 
Oh, yes, I 
am a 
gay, etc. 
As I 
walk down the crowded street 
I 
toss my flowing curls, 
And smile on every gent I 
meet; 
Pm envied by the girls, 
The little dears they are so shy, 
Their thoughts they dare not tell, 
They are afraid to wink so sly, 
Like me, the Female Swell.

I 
LOVE the golden summer months, 
The fondest of the year, 
With pic-nics and with morning drive; 
To me they are so dear; 
But sweeter far than all these, oh! 
The truth I 
cannot hide— 
Is walking down Fifth avenue 
Upon the shady side. 
CHORUS. 
Walking down Fifth avenue 
Upon the shady side— 
There you'll meet the maidens fair, 
Decked out in Fashion's pride. 
There's some that think tne summer months 
Are made to pass away 
In bathing in the sultry sun, 
At Long Branch or Cape May; 
But as for me, the nicest thing— 
I 
really must decide— 
Is walking down Fifth avenue 
Upon the shady side. 
Walking down Fifth avenue, etc. 
There are others go up to the Park, 
To stroll beneath the trees, 
Or ride around the lake in boats, 
To get the cooling breeze; 
But for such pleasures I 
don't care— 
There's one I 
think more wide— 
'Tis walking down Fifth avenue 
Upon the shady side.

Music by ARTHUR PERCY. 
Published by Wax. A. POND & GO 547 Broadway, New York. 
'TwAs in the pleisant summer time. I 
met him all by chance, 
The robins sang their sweetest rhyme, and loving was his 
glance; 
We wander'd mid the blooming flow'rs, he called me sweet and 
fair, 
The queen of all the sunny bow'rs, the brightest rose-bud 
there.

CHORUS. 
When we met there by the river, 
in the sunlight's merry glow; 
For my heart he won forever, 
Where the pretty little water lilies grow. 
I 
dream of him where'er I 
go, I 
never can forget 
Those eyes that shone with sparkling glow, the day when first 
we met ; 
The lilies all will fade and die, the birds will fly away, 
We can't forget, nor he nor I, the love was told that day. 
SPOKEN.—No For he begged me just to whisper the little

COT ON THE HILL 
Composed by FRANK LAVAHNIE. Published by KUNKEL Baos., St Louis. 
'um years since I 
left my home, the one I 
loved so dear, 
Where in my youth kind parents lived my weary heart to 
cheer; 
Now all those days are pass'd and gone, and I 
am from them 
still, 
But while I 
live I'll not forget the cot upon the hill. 
CHORUS. 
The cot upon the hill, where friends are living still; 
That pleasant little love-birth place, the cot upon the hill, 
That pleasant little love-birth place, the cot upon the hill. 
'Twas in that cosey little cot I 
passed my younger days, 
With friends and others always by, to cheer my childish ways ; 
But now that I 
am far away, I 
often wonder still 
If those kind friends would welcome me, to the cot upon the 
hill.

TRA LA LA, GEORGE. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
My love is young and fair and sweet, 
My fancy she can please, 
But 0, she is inclined to flirt 
With every one she sees; 
Whenever she goes out alone 
She's sure to catch a 
beau, 
But then she says it's all for fun, 
And that's no harm, you know. 
I 
want her to be mine, 
Ana oft I 
tell her so, 
But though she don't decline, 
She wont say yes or no. 
CHORUS. 
Tra la la, George, 
You must go and ask papa, George, 
Tra la In, George, 
You must go and ask papa, George, ha, ha! 
Her father is a 
gruff old man, 
With lots of worldly pelf— 
Ile says his charming daughter is 
A 
fortune in herself; 
In that, of course, we both agree, 
But when I 
speak about 
Her hand and heart we have to part, 
For he coolly hicks me out ! 
I 
see my love each day, 
She says it is a 
shame; 
What will we do ? I 
say— 
Her answer is the same—

should he so wild, 
But girls in love only have one voice, whose language is their 
only choice. 
I'll meet you in the Park, etc. 
At the lake side and Casino we will mingle with the crowd, 
And the grass will feel our footsteps, if such freedom be allowed;

happy pair.

Like a

Walk along, keep a-gittin' up, John, 
She's as graceful as an elephant, 
She walks like a

IIer eyes are of a 
gimlet twist, 
And her lips are cherry red; 
And when she goes to promenade, 
She makes all de niggers laugh, 
And when she dance de juba, 
She kills de niggers dead. 
Oh, yes, she does! oh, yes, she does! oh, yes, she does 
She kills de niggers dead.

OUT OF WORK. 
Music by Meer. 
Sung by A . 
A . 
LUCA. 
THE old shop is silent, and cold as a 
stone, 
No work to do, no work to do; 
The old merry voices, so cheerful are gone, 
No work to do any more. 
Papa's so sad when I 
look in his eye, 
And mamma, I 
know, is most ready to cry; 
But maybe good angels will come by-and-by, 
To drive the old wolf from the door. 
CHORUS . 
Waiág to hear the old ringing bell, 
Oh I 
how its echoes sweet stories can tell ; 
Men out of work, you must sorrow no more, 
Stout hearts will drive the old wolf from the door. 
Sometime-; I 
hear, in the cold winter's night, 
Father, so dear, mother so near, 
Talking alone by the dim fire-light, 
Talking of bright days of yore. 
Then I 
hear mother say, " never be sad, 
People will need you, don't doubt it, my lad; 
But trust with the faith that you always have had 
In One who keeps wolves from the door." 
Waiting to hear, etc.

'NEATH the white and purple blossoms 
Blooming down the meadow wide, 
Both our darling little angels 
Now are sleeping side by side; 
There the summer breezes murmur 
Solemn dirges all the day, 
And the daisies seem in mourning 
Where our darlings used to play. 
CHORUS . 
'Neath the white and purple blossoms 
Blooming down the meadow wide, 
Both our darling little angels 
Now are sleeping side by side. 
When the trees were richly laden 
Early in the crimson fall, 
Little Sophie in her beauty, 
Left us at the angels' call ; 
Soon the carol of the robin 
Welcomed in the springtime fair, 
But it brought us grief and sadness, 
Making vacant Lizzy's chair. 
'Neath the, etc. 
Now adown the scented meadow 
Where the clover sweetly waves, 
All we see to love and cherish 
Are those tiny angel graves; 
Through the day the robins guard tLem, 
And at night the whippoorwill, 
But our darlings do not mind them— 
They are sleeping, sleeping still.

GO GET PERMISSION OF MA. 
I 
fancy I've seen you before." 
I ONCE had a 
sweetheart, a 
charming young girl, 
A beautiful young village queen, 
A 
rustic young beauty with hair all in curl, 
And only just turned seventeen; 
When I 
told her I 
loved her, her head she bung down, 
And her cheeks colored up like the rose, 
So I 
thought I 
would try and just steal a 
sly kiss 
From the spot where her victuals all goes. 
SPOKEN.—And I 
did try, but she stopped me and said: 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before you attempt to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
While talking one night of what pleasure love brings, 
'T was one pleasant evening in May, 
No dickey bird sailing through air on his wings 
E'er felt half so happy or gay, 
I 
asked my fair charmer if she would be mine, 
And begged she would then name the day 
When we should be married and settled for life, 
Just listen to what she did say: 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before we attempt to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
Her ma did consent, and in one month from this 
Maria and I 
will be one; 
To my suit the old lady with pleasure said yes, 
Her consent it was easily won; 
",But you must agree," said her mother to me 
"To what I 
am now about to say ; 
When married you calmly submit and agree 
To let us have all our own way." 
SPOKEN.—This quite stunned me for the moment ; but re-
covering myself, I 
coolly replied : 
CHORUS. 
-OH must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before I 
agree to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
• ',

GO GET PERMISSION OF MA.—Concluded. 
A 
little advice to you girls I'll now give, 
So listen to what I 
shall say ; 
When sweethearts want to marry, and with you to live, 
Don't say, " I 
must have my own way," 
If you do, as sure as I 
am singing to-night, 
old maids I 
am certain you'll die, 
For a 
man's but a 
fool, if he doesn't tell you, 
Or rather unto you reply : 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before I 
agree to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma.

I'm in love with such a

A musician in the military band, 
And I 
love him better than gold or wealth, 
When I 
see him in his uniform so grand. 
The first time that I 
met him, 
With love I 
was struck dumb, 
And my heart was in a 
flutter, 
When Charlie played the drum. 
SPOKEN.—And it's

Oh! my! but I 
tell you it's fun, 
When Charlie plays the drum. 
Oh! he often comes to take me for a 
walk, 
And we stray along touether, side by side, 
And so sweetly and so lovingly he'll talk ; 
And once he ask'd me if I'd be his bride. 
And ev'ry Thursday evening, 
As soon as work is done, 
I 
hasten to the park to hear 
My Charlie play the drum. 
And it's one, two, etc.

'WAY down in Georgia, when on de old plantation,

He stabbed himself with the tail of a

Bestrewn with care and strife; 
I 
speculated foolishly, 
My losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny little voice 
Kept whispering in my ear :—Cno. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, 
And found, to my surprise, 
My funds instead of sinking 
Very quickly then did rise. 
I 
grasped each chance, and always struck 
The iron while 'twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities 
And never once forgot :—Cuo. 
I'm married now and happy, 
I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, 
Devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, 
We have little ehildreit three,

teach them, 
As they prattle round my knee

SWEET KITTY CLYDE. 
0, WITO has not seen Kitty Clyde ? 
She lives at the foot of the hill, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
That carries her father's old mill. 
0, who does not love Kitty Clyde ? 
That sunny-ey'd, rosy-cheek'd lass, 
With a 
sweet dim/MI chin, 
That looks rousTish as sin, 
With always a 
smile as you pass. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde. 
With a 
basket to put in her fish, 
Every morning with line and a 
hook, 
This sweet little lass, 
Through the tall heavy grass. 
Steals along by the clear runnina brook. 
She throws her line into the stream, 
And trips it along the brook side ; 
0 
how I 
do wish 
That I 
was a 
fish, 
To be caught by sweet Kitty Clyde. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde. 
How I 
wish I 
was a 
bee, 
I'd not gather honey from the flowers, 
But would steal a 
dear sip 
From Kitty's sweet lip, 
And make my own hive in her bowers. 
Or, if I 
was some little bird, 
I 
would not build nests in the air, 
But keep close by the side 
Of sweet Kitty Clyde, 
And sleep in her soft silken hair. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde.

" SOLID DISHES TO THE FRONT." 
As sung by BiLLY BIRCH of the San Francisco Minstrels. 
Ain.—" Spring, Gentle Spring." 
BEANS, beans, Boston baked beans, 
Served up red-hot on a 
Sunday morn; 
Beans, beans, Boston baked beans, 
Is a 
dish that is fit for a 
queen, sure's you're born! 
Whenever you go to Boston town, 
Get some one to show you round; 
Smoking red-hot on the plates, 
Oh, how I 
love those Yankee dates! 
You may talk about your good clam chowder, 
Talk about your whiskey sour— 
CHORUS. 
Give me beans, beans, Boston baked beans, 
Served up red-hot on a 
Sunday morn, 
With coffee, sugar, bread, and cream, 
Is a 
dish that is fit for a 
queen, sure's you're born. 
Hash, hash, mysterious hash! 
In a 
second-class hotel you never miss hash; 
hash, hash, beautiful hash ! 
It's a 
hard crowd to tackle, but easy to catch; 
I've travelled this country thro' and thro', 
This famous conundrum is always new; 
Talk of scrambled eggs, crumbs and crust, 
But mysterious hash is more robust; 
Reed- birds, quail, champagne and ice, 
Canary birds stuffed is all very nice— 
CHORUS. 
Hash, hash, mysterious hash ! 
In a 
second-class hotel you never miss hash; 
Hash, hash, beautiful hash! 
It's a 
hard crowd to tackle, but easy to catch. 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Floating so gayly and sweet in the breeze ; 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese, 
Brine- me a 
dish of sweet Limburger cheese; 
At Miller's saloon I 
take my ease, 
And revel on lager and Limburger cheese; 
That's the luscious stuff to eat, 
For it makes your breath so sweet. 
Talk of love in Cupid's bowers, 
Talk of the balm of a 
thousand flowers— 
CHORUS. 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Floating so gayly and sweet in the breeze; 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese, 
Bring me a 
dish of sweet Limburger cheese.

And feel the breezes cool,

DOWN the meadow ' neath the clover 
Where the sparrow builds its nest, 
Emma, once the fairest flower, 
Now is calmly laid to rest; 
Robins sweetly carol o'er her, 
Chirping crickets sing their lays, 
Blending harmony together 
Through the golden summer days. 
CHORUS. 
Robins sweetly carol o'er her, 
Chirping crickets sing their lays, 
Blending harmony together 
Through the golden summer days. 
Kind and loving was our Emma, 
Good alike to friend and foe, 
When the angels came and told her 
That with them our dear must go; 
Summer days were in their glory, 
And we wanted her to stay, 
But they took our only treasure 
To that land so far away. 
Robins sweetly, etc. 
Now beneath the purple clover, 
Down the meadow she is laid, 
And the honeysuckle blossoms 
Sweetly o'er the grave we made; 
Daisies, too, are bending near her, 
And the buttercup's bright head, 
Wafted by the gentle breezes, 
Bows to Emma, who is dead. 
Robins sweetly, etc.

SCOTCH SONG BY MRS. HOWARD PAUL. 
Hurrah for the Highlands, the stern Scottish Highlands, 
The home of the clansmen, the bold and the flee ; 
Where the clouds love to rest on the mountain's rough breast 
Ere they journey afar o'er the depths of the sea. 
'Tis there where the cataract sings to the breeze, 
As it dashes in foam, like a 
spirit of light; 
'Tis there the bold fisherman bounds o'er the sea, 
in his fleet tiny bark through the perilous night. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the Highlands, the stern Scottish Highlands, 
The home of the clansmen, the bold and the free ; 
Where the clouds love to rest on the mountain's rough breast, 
Ere they journey afar o'er the islandless sea. 
'Tis the land of deep shadow, of sunshine and shower, 
Where the hurricane revels in madness on high ; 
For there it has might that can war with its power, 
In the wild dizzy cliffs that are cleaving the sky. 
I 
have trod merry England and dwelt on its charms, 
I've wandered through Erin, the gem of the sea; 
But the Highlands alone the true Scottish heart warms, 
Her heather is blooming, her eagles are free. 
Then hurrah for the Highlands, &c. 
DASHING BELLE.

Or take a

Houseless, homeless—sad to behold, 
Eyes red with crying, care- worn and sighing, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
No one to soothe the sad heart of sorrow, 
None to pity—plenty to scold ; 
None will ask if he lives to-atorrow, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
Hungry, & a, 
What has be done to be so neglected ? 
Why do you thrust him away from the door ? 
Perhaps he was once most highly respected, 
The answer is simply,—because be is poor. 
Hungry, tkc, 
What is that dark-looking object, before us ?

They're taking a 
poor wretch home to his friends, 
They found him last night out in the cold. 
Ifungry, 
Friends of the churchyard, none there will scorn him, 
E'en from the best down to the worst; 
He'll sthm be forgotten, no one will mourn him, 
'Where he commingles his dust with the dust. 
Hungry, & c. 
Sad scenes of sorrow, each coming morrow, 
Brings in it's dull stealthy pace day by day; 
Heaping fresh troubles on man to his horror, 
Till death seals his doom, aud he passes away. 
Hungry,

THE OLD HONE AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE. 
Oh, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and the fiddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn ; 
Great changes has come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes him sad and forlorn, 
For no more we hear the datkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
No, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The change makes me sad and forlorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
in the field I've worked when I 
thought 'twas hard, 
But night bro't its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side. 
Time place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered now and o'er the world they roam, 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the old home, &c. 
:Nov the old man would rather lived and died 
in the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom came to the colored man, 
He left his cotton-field and corn. 
This old man has lived out his three-score and ten, 
And he'll soon have to lay down and die, 
Yet he hopes to go into a 
better land, 
So now, old cabin home, good-bye. 
No. the obi home. & e.

I 
Tell - big her you'll wed her when the days grow short. 
See, when the moonlight falls on the streamlet, 
Silvering each ripple with its brilliant rays, 
Out in the midnight making the heart 
Waking the " dickey birds " before the break of day ; 
Tickling and teasing, kissing and squeezing, 
Telling lots of little fibs, and saying they are true ; 
Some say 'tis naughty, others very pleasing, 
Just wait a 
moment, and I'll tell you what to do. 
Cllo.—Wait till the moonlight, Sze. 
Homeward retreating, one sad heart beating, 
Now she must bid you the last good-night; 
She fondly wishes those stolen kisses 
Could last till to-morrow morning's broad daylio:ht. 
Out goes the gas-light, then comes the " good-night," 
Carefully she raises the latch with her key; 
Seo then the dear miss rush for the last kiss, 
Mind what you tell her when you next m—t— 
( 
Spoken, read " meet.") 
Cno.—Wait till the moonlight, itc.

DON'T YOU DARE TO DO IT, 
GEORGE, 
I 
coraTED once a 
lovely girl, 
A beauty young and fair, 
She'd cherry- red lips, and teeth like pearl, 
And golden was her hair; 
Her eyes were like the evening stars, 
That shine in heaven above, 
And with this lovely beauty 
I 
was overhead in love. 
SPOKEN.—I 
shall never forget the first time I 
met that girl— 
never—no never, and when the time came to bid her good-bye 
you know that time always comes, although it comes rather late 
with some, and rather early with others. 
We were early birds 
that time—early in the morning, you know. 
So, I'd gone 
through all the preliminary ceremonies, such as good-bye, 
darling, and pleasant dreams, and I'd just slided my arm around 
her waist and was goino- to give her one good kiss right square 
on the mouth, when she boxed my ears and said: 
CHORE'S. 
" 
Don't you dare to do it, George, 
Don't you dare to do it, George; 
If ' twas found out, what would my mother say 
Don't you dare to do it, George, 
Don't you dare to do it, George; 
Ain't you a 
very, very, naughty man ?" 
I 
took her for a 
walk one night, 
'Twas in a 
flowery dell, 
And while there, to my fair one, 
I 
tales of love did tell; 
She sat down in a 
shaded spot, 
I 
sat down by her side, 
And with my arm around her waist 
I 
said, " darling, be my bride." 
SPOKEN.—" Tes,"I says to her, says I—" Susan," says I—says 
I—" Susan," says I—. 
Darned if I 
know what I 
did say now; 
(1) 
A 
5 
I 
DON'T YOU DARE TO DO IT, GEORGE.—Con-
eluded. 
but I 
know I 
said it, yes, I 
did, and when I 
showed her the ring, 
and asked her for her answer, she said: " Get away, George, 
you're always saying something," that, means yes, yes it does, 
so I 
says to her, says I, " I'll go and have our names put in the 
morning papers, and then I'll go to the minister and have our 
names called in church next Sunday, George so-and-so, and 
Miss Susan so-and-so, to be joined together in holy wedlock, 
any one having any objections will please state them or forever 
after hold their peace, and my Susan actually swooned over in 
my arms; yes, she did; and when she came to herself the very 
first words she uttered were : 
Don't you dare to do it, etc. 
Well I 
need not tell you more about 
Those happy nights we met, 
For soon we put off courting, boys, 
And married we did get; 
And now I 
feel so happy, 
Oh my heart is filled with joy; 
For yesterday my Susan dear 
Brought forth a 
little boy. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, it's the prettiest little baby you ever saw. 
Oh, 
girls, do come and see it! all the girls in the neighborhood have 
been to see it, and they say it's the handsomest child they ever 
saw—the very picture of its father. 
I'm its father ; yes, I 
am. 
By the by, boys, before I 
go I'll let you into a 
little secret, on 
the quiet, you know. 
When you take your sweetheart out for 
an evening's promenade and you want to kiss her good bye at 
the door, and she says, " don't you dare to do it," that's Ihi' 
time you must. They only pretend to be a 
little shy. 
Why, bless 
your soul, after they're married their shyness and bashfulness all 
vanish just as quickly as a glass of lager in the hands of a 
thirsty Dutchman. 
Why, since 
I've been 
marled, I don't 
remember, not even once, my Susan ever saying: 
Don't you dare to do it, etc.

W HAT! no! it can't be that they've driven 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may their crime be forgiven,) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh, Heavens, I 
am sadden'd awl weary, 
See the tears how they course down my cheeks! 
Oh, this world it is lonely and dreary, 
And my hear' for relief vainly seeks. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm old, and I'm helpless and feeble, 
The days of my youth have gone by; 
Then over the hill to the poor house 
I 
wander alone there to die. 
Ah, me! on that old door-step yonder, 
I've sat with my babes on my knee ; 
No father was happier or fonder 
Than I 
of my little ones three. 
The boys, both so rosy and chubby, 
And Lilly NN W' 
prattle so sweet! 
God knows how their father has loved them, 
But they've driven him out in the street. 
For I'm old, etc. 
It's long years since my Mary was taken, 
My faithful affectionate wife; 
Since then I'm forlorn and forsaken, 
And the light has died out of my life. 
The boys grew to manhood; I 
gave them 
A 
deed for the farm! ay, and more, 
I 
gave them this house they were born in! 
And now I'm turned out from its door. 
For I'm old, etc. 
Oh, children! loved children! yet hear me, 
I 
have journeyed along on life's stage ; 
With the hope that you all would be near me, 
To comfort and cheer my old age. 
My life-blood I'd gladly have given, 
To Shield and protect you! but hark! 
Though my heart breaks, I'll say it's you've driven 
Me out here to die in the dark. 
For I'm old. etc. 
But, perhaps, they'll live happier without me; 
Farewell, dear old home, ah ! farewell! 
Each pathway and tree here about we, 
Some memory precious can tell. 
Well, the flowers will bloom bright as ever, 
And the birds sing as sweet to the morn ; 
Then over the hill from the poor house, 
Next Spring the old man shall ba borne. 
For I'm old, etc.

TOOK my love one ev'ning,, 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro) silent arbors gleaming, 
Where Cupid has control ; 
I 
wanted to tell her 
how dearly I 
adored her, 
But oh, she would not 
Tho' I 
tenderly implored her ; 
Oh, love, oh, love, why don't you keed me? 
How can you treat me so ? 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain; 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, ain't you awful; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Yes, you are awful; 
Your like I 
De'er did see ; 
Oh, ain't you awful ; 
It's wrong you know to love me 80, 
Dear me, you're horrid ; 
Why don't you let me be 7 
To make my feelings clearer, 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
.A_n(I said I'd like to hear her 
Say yes, and ease my mind ; 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention ; 
She said mamma would scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention ; 
" 
Come, love," I 
cried, " we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind." 
" 
Oh, no, oh, no," she said, 
" 
Don't ask me now to wed; 
What would the people say 
If we should run away 7 " 
ain't you awful, etc. 
(1) 
AIN'T YOU AWFContinwed. 
She talked on useless matters, 
Till my patience was in tatters, 
Just as a 
woman clatters, 
When silent she should be; 
I 
begged her to listen, 
And drew her close beside me; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me, 
And soon she told me with a 
smile 
That she did not care for me; 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turned away her head, 
And this wo.s all she said— 
Oh, ain't you awful, et.s. 
As sung by ED 
Buscrori. 
I
T'S sailing I 
am at the dawn of the day 
To my brother that's over the sea, 
And it's little I 
care for my life anywhere, 
For ' tis breaking my poor heart will be ; 
But a 
treasure I 
take for old Ireland's sake, 
And I'll pledge all belonging above, 
'Tis a 
handful of turf from the land of me birth, 
From the heart of the country I 
love. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Then won't that poor lad in his exile be glad, 
When he sees the bright present I 
bring ? 
And won't then the flowers in their elegant bowers 
Breathe forth the perfume of spring 1 
Oh, Erin, Machree though it's parted we'll be, 
'Tis a 
blessing I 
leave on your shore, 
Though your mountains and stileams I 
will see in my 
dreams, 
Till I 
cross to old Ireland once more. 
(Repeat as before.

On, look at this here sweetheart ; 
I 
told you what's her name ; 
She came from Louisiana, whare 
Dey hoe dat sugar cane; 
She's tall, slim, and slender, 
Her eyes as black as coal; 
She takes in washing, dollar a

And she's as good as gold.

Sift sand, Sal, sift, sift— 
Sift sand, Sal, sift, sift— 
Sift sand, Sal, sift, sift ; 
Cow jumped over the moon. 
I 
took her to the parson ; 
Hadn't we such fun ! 
She clutched me and I 
clutched her, 
And the parson made us one; 
Balance to your pardner, 
Swing hands all around ; 
Right and left to Liza Jane's, 
The prettiest gal in town. 
OH, 
DIS IS WHAT I DID. 
KIND friends. I'm glad to see you 
Smiling all around ; 
I 
think I 
will just throw myself, 
I 
feel so good and sound; 
I've always been accustomed 
Dancing to the fid, 
And when I 
heard the music play, 
Oh, dis is what I 
did. 
When I 
came to this city 
To see the sights and fun, 
Among the pretty yeller gals, 
You bet I'm number one; 
I 
went into an auction store. 
For these ere shoes did bid, 
When the man he asked me for the pay, 
Oh, dis is what I 
did.

You were more than all beside 7

Bring again those happy days, 
With the never-ending yearning 
For my lips to speak thy praise'?

Are you waiting still to meet me

And he must go.

GET THE BEST! GET THE LEST! 
WEBSTER'S 
READY-MADE LOVE- LETTERS. 
COYPIIISING 
Every Style and Fashion of Note and Letter incident to Love, 
Courtship, and 171arriage, which should pass between 
Ladies and Gentlemen from, First Acqaintance 
to Final Union. 
This Rook teaches plainly—so plainly that the most simple can 
understand and make use of the lessons taught. 
It tells a Lady how to meet a 
Gentleman's advances. When to seem a 
little forward; when to seem a 
litle shy. How a 
lady should meet, and how 
part from a 
Lover. Shows Ladies and Gentlemen how to act to each other, 
and in company, in all the parts of Bride, Bridegroom, Bridesmaid, and 
Groomsman. How to act at the Altar and at the Wedding Feast. How to 
behave during the Honeymoon, and how and whom to receive and visit. 
In brief, teaches everything that Lovers should know about Court-
ship— its attendant joys and troubles; of the Marriage Ceremony, its customs 
and the thousand duties, cares and pleasures that attend and follow. 
It is a 
perfect rade mecum. 
Study it and you can act easy, natural, and 
genteel in all the above positions, and pass with success through all these 
most trying and difficult scenes—equally well with any lady or gentleman 
born to wealth and brought up in fashionable society. 
This Book also tells you—flow to write your first letter to a 
lady. 
How the lady should reply. 
How a 
gentleman is to tell he loves. 
What the 
lady should write in reply. How a 
gentleman should write to a 
lady, under 
all and any circumstance. What the lady's replies should be. 
Shows how 
widowers as well as bachelors should woo widows, whether young or middle-
aged 
In short there is not an occasion of any kind calling for a 
correspond-
ence on the subject of Love and Matrimony but what is here treated of, and 
plainly and fully explained. 
To which are annexed, SPECIMEN LOVE LETTERS, 
written by persons in real life, in every possible contingency that can occur; 
together with the famous letters of ABEL.tED and ELOISE, and other cele-
brated lovers. 
Moreover, it contains, A COMPLETE DICTIONARY OF POETICAL 
QUOTATIONS and THE WONDERFUL ART OF SECRET WRITINCS (which no 
one but those in the secret can read.) 
Also, in this Book 
is revealed, every requisite to win the esteem and 
love of a 
lady or gentlsman.

mental and useful manual for lovers of both sexes, which should be their bil-
separable companion. Bound in cloth, with a
