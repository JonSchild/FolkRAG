Talking about money alone is a low note on which to
 
end this extraordinary meeting.
 Money is
 
important, but what we talked about up to now has
 
been much more important.
 I would like to remind
 
you that the greatest work in this field of
 
folklore has not been done by folkloristSbut by
 
A
 
amateurs who didn't have government grants.
 The
 
latter recognized the spirit and the integrity of
 
the cultural beauty that
f
t
s around them and they
 
set about to preserve it for their own benefit and
 
for posterity.
 
I got into this granting business about 10
 
years ago because I thought it might be interesting
 
to be where the money was and to see what could be
 
done with it.
 In the process I've discovered that
 
people have an unclear picture of the way grants
 
are provided.
 They believe that if they fill out
 
a form, meet the criteria and deadlines, and so
 
forth, then they ought to get their grant.
 But
 
doing all this doesn't guarantee them funding.
 
The granting process is a little like a
 
potluck supper with people bringing a lot of
 
beautiful and interesting kinds of food and put-
It'
 
ting them on the table.
 people run around
 
with the napkins and the ice-tea spoons and make
 
sure that they don't forget the salt and that
 
everything is organized in an appetizing and

interesting way.
 Then
 - ave to select a good
 
meal out of all that wonderful display of foods.
 
They have to decide "Are we going to have ham or
 
turkey?"
 It isn't that ham is bad and turkey is
 
good or the other way round.
 Or they have to say
 
"We're going to have some ham and some turkey and
 
maybe the potato salad with dill pickles in it this
 
time instead of the kind with sweet pickles because
 
we had that last time.
 The potato salad with sweet
 
pickles was good, but we'd like a change."
 
Making.
. 9 choices also happens at a panel
 
meeting that is called to discuss applications for
 
program grants.
 Choices must be made because
 
funding agencies never have enough money to fund
 
all the programs.
 So when you apply for a grant,
 
you ought to ask yourself whether the proposed
 
project is truly important, because the panel is
 
going to respond to your conviction that it needs
 
to be done.
 Also,  learn the rules of the funding
 
agency.
 For instance, my agency, the National
 
Endowment for the Arts (NEA),doesn't fund, except
 
in the rarest circumstances, oral history projects.

So, although I agree with the remark made today
 
that local history is the backbone of cultural
 
investigation, you can come to us until the moon is
 
blue with oral history projects but we  i

them.
 
NEA is responsible for-supporting and helping
 
all kinds of arts across the country in every part
 
of the United States.
 It has an annual budget of
 
approximately $148 million.
 Over the past five
 
years, Folk Arts Programs has received
 
approximately $3 million of the budget.

Bear in mind, however,
dealing with an agency
 
that was set up to make sure that major symphony
 
orchestras are in most of the major cities, and
 
that major art museums and all kinds of theaters
 
are across the country.
 I don't have any objection
 
to any of these.
 I think a lot more money is
 
needed for all of them, as well as for the folk
 
arts.
 
Try to make sure when you apply for funding
 
that you understand the situation you're dealing

with.
 Get the agency's brochures and our
 
guidelines.
 Go to your local arts agency and look
 
at the annual report, which lists the grants given
 
each year.
 Try to use the people who work for the
 
agency because they are your enployees.
