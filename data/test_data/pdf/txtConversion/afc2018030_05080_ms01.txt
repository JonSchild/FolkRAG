MM  0:00   
I'll start it off. Just to say I am Meredith McGriff doing the interview and it is October 15, 2018. And if you could 
introduce yourself so that people know who's here. Yeah. 
 
JVB  0:13   
My name is Jenna Vanden Brink. I'm a full time potter here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
 
MM  0:20   
And if you could just say just a few words for the record about where we are today. 
 
JVB  0:25   
We're in my home in Highland Park. It's a neighborhood in Pittsburgh. My husband and I are restoring a 1905 
Victorian home. And we live here with our baby daughter and small dog, Wellington. 
 
MM  0:44   
It's beautiful. 
 
JVB  0:45   
Thank you. 
 
MM  0:49   
So, how did you first become interested in ceramics? 
 
JVB  0:54   
So my father was involved in clay. And he actually he studied, studied ceramics at Calvin College, which is where 
I ended up also going. And then he was making pots while my mom was counseling at the Center for Creative 
Studies, and he got connected with a class in automotive clay modeling and ended up choosing fields he didn't 
know anything about. But because he got all these free classes, he just took them. And he used to bring me along 
as a baby to all of his ceramics classes that he would take. He was mostly just using the studios at the community 
colleges. 
 
JVB  1:47   
And he got a job working for Ford modeling clay cars, so he still works for Ford. I think it's probably been about 
30 years. He's a model manager. So he's working in clay. But in a very sort of alternative way. So I was exposed 
to ceramics from a really young age and my family was really committed to arts and community. They moved to 
Detroit, my mom was really involved in theater. And my dad, yeah, he made pots. And then he started working 
for Ford. So our home was filled with artwork and handmade pottery, and it was sort of always surrounding me 
and always something that my parents promoted as something that was valuable. 
 
MM  2:38   
How did you make the decision that that's what you wanted to do? 
 
JVB  2:42   
So when I, I didn't really have access as a kid to any, any ceramics classes specifically, I took art classes, but there 
wasn't really that much in Detroit where we grew up. And so I didn't really get involved in ceramics until college. 
And in college, I mostly just pursued classes that I was interested in, so I ended up studying English and art studio 
art. So I got a double major in those two things. And then when I graduated, I thought I would for sure use my 
English degree. And I ended up getting connected with the Union Project. And very directly we used my 
background in ceramics, my degree in ceramics. 
 
MM  3:32   
What year did you graduate? 
 
JVB  3:34   
I graduated from Calvin in 2009. And had a really close group of friends in college and we lived together in 
college and then decided when it came time for graduation to move somewhere together. And then we visited a 
couple of different cities and chose Pittsburgh to move together. So there were 11 of us that moved from 
Michigan to Pittsburgh together to sort of live and work in a community. And once we made the decision about 
Pittsburgh, I started looking at job opportunities and ended up signing up for AmeriCorps to do year of service. 
And then Union Project was one of the placement opportunities through AmeriCorps. So that's how I landed there 
into that in the fall of 2009. 
 
MM  4:28   
That's great. So what kind of work were you doing at the project when you started? 
 
JVB  4:38   
When I started Justin Rothshank had left in the spring. So five or six months later, I came up, came on. So the 
ceramics program was sort of without a manager or leadership at the time. The organization was going through a 
big transition, and had to downsize staff really dramatically. So then they brought on a couple of AmeriCorps 
interns to help take on some of that load. So I sort of found myself in a technical internship, but it was very much 
a role where I had a lot of agency and a lot of input and a lot of opportunity to grow the program. So my, my role 
eventually was ceramics program manager. But at the time, when I came on, it was more broad, like arts program 
manager, because I oversaw this stained glass restoration program, as well as the ceramics program. So Union 
Project is a 100 year old church building, and one of the ongoing projects from the time it was founded in 2001, 
was to restore the stained glass windows. And they did that by running a program where members of the 
community would sign up to take classes, pay to take classes in stained glass restoration, learn the skill of stained 
glass restoration, and simultaneously restore the hundred year old windows at the Union Project. Yeah, it was, it 
was an amazing, amazing vision, amazing concept. And one of my first projects was to wrap that up, it had sort of 
been put on hold for a couple years when the ceramics program had grown, and then it sort of got put on hold 
because the organization was going through these changes. And so then one of the first things that I was tasked 
with was to finish the windows. Yeah. So it was it was really I mean, now I know how to restore stained glass 
windows, do I ever get to restoring our own? No. But it's very good that I could do that. Yeah, so that was one of 
the most rewarding projects, I think, of my time there. And that was right at the beginning, I ended up staying at 
Union Project for seven years, growing the ceramics program, mostly, but also finishing up that stained glass. 
 
MM  7:16   
That's amazing. So coming out of college, did you have a sense of what your own ceramics work was going to be 
or what you, what you wanted to do with your career. 
 
JVB  7:30   
I didn't really. And I think even when I was at school, I didn't, I didn't really have a strong, like, career focus. 
Maybe that was just not being responsible. Or maybe it was a privilege to not worry about that. But I definitely 
just sort of took the approach that it was important for me to figure out like sort of what made me spark and what 
made me come alive. And I pursued those things, and then found myself in this role at Union Project where I was 
managing the arts program, the ceramics program, and I still even for a full year, if not two even, didn't even 
make any pots really, so much of my focus and my work was restoring the program, growing the program, 
making people feel included, drawing people in, asking the community what they wanted. What they wanted, it 
had been pared down so much. And had been focused on sort of production potters and I was shifting it to be 
more of a community program. 
 
JVB  8:49   
So I grew the co-op of artists from, I think there were like three or four left, to over 20 members, created a full 
slate of classes for adults and kids, and there had never been any classes for children, which is something I never 
had access to as a kid. And I thought how cool it was for people to have kids, young kids to have access to 
throwing classes at age four, I think that's so fun. Yeah, I sort of tried to create opportunities for people to engage 
with the program at whatever level they were at. So whether it was co-op members who were, you know, fully 
capable of making their own work, they would also have access to teaching opportunities and peer, sort of 
interactment just from, you know, being with other members to like novices, who were needing a beginners class 
to people who are hobbyists, who needed to just have access to the studio, and not really any instruction, but no, 
but like low commitment, so we had open studio sort of opportunities. And then I also started to do a huge amount 
of outreach into schools and partnerships with other nonprofits and organizations. So sort of using the ceramics 
program as a tool to engage other people even off site. So that was a big part of the program too. 
 
MM  10:33   
That's a lot. 
 
JVB  10:33   
It was a lot. It was a tremendous amount of, of work. And it was a really big program. And then after seven years, 
I, it was, it was sort of time for me to shift and do something different. The organization was changing again, and 
it felt like a good time to move on. 
 
MM  10:53   
So during the time that you were there, when did you start making your own work, and how did that progress? 
 
JVB  11:01   
it took a couple years, I felt like the program was my, sort of was my art. And then eventually, I realized that it 
was important for me to make my own work. Partially for, just as, just in the role that I was in, it was important 
for me to exercise my skills, but also for the co-op members, especially to see that I was also a practicing sort of 
potter, I think that that was really important. And not just an administrator. 
 
JVB  11:38   
And then the the first sort of, I would, I would do things like participate in wood firings, that was sort of a really 
natural communal sort of opportunity to put some pots in the wood firing, and I had to go out there anyways to 
help facilitate it. So things like that. 
 
JVB  12:01   
And then the other big sort of motivator to start making my own work was a friend of two of my friends who were 
part of the crew that we moved out here to Pittsburgh with, were getting married and wanted me to make them 
dishes. So I made them sort of a custom set of dishes. And then I liked the product so much that I kept making it 
so now it's one of my lines of work that I make. So that was sort of the motivator for finally starting that. 
 
MM  12:39   
That's great. Was that line, something you developed with them? Or? 
 
JVB  12:48   
Not really, it was more, they sort of gave me complete creative control. And I thought about what would be fitting 
for them. So they're actually, they're, they don't live here in Pittsburgh anymore, they moved back to Belding, 
Michigan and bought a farm and now they're vegetable farmers there. And so the pots I made for them were 
earthenware, so like a deep, rich, red, brown clay. And then they were both, the husband of the two was, was an 
artist and he sort of had this line drawn style in his own work so I adapted sort of that style. And I and I did 
drawings of fruits and vegetables on the, on the pots that I made for them. Yeah. 
 
MM  13:40   
So as you started producing work, where, where were you selling it? Or were you selling...? 
 
JVB  13:47   
I mostly just took advantage of the opportunities that came about just from my role at Union Project. So part of 
my job also was to coordinate a group booth at the Three Rivers Arts Festival, which is just a big summer arts 
festival, downtown Pittsburgh. So I was one of, I also participated as an artist through that. And then I started a 
sale, the Mother of All Pottery Sales, which is different than, it's just like, all ceramics, and it was in the Great 
Hall at Union project, which was the former sanctuary. So it was all ceramic artists in Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh 
reach, you know, broader Pittsburgh region, were invited to apply to participate. And then so I would participate 
in that, because that was something that I was doing, you know, just as part of my work as Program Manager. 
And then eventually, we started the Highland Park pottery tour, and then I participated in that as well. Yeah, it 
wasn't until I started making, making pots full time that I started my online shop and adding shows and those sorts 
of things. Mostly, I just did things that made sense with, in coordination with my work through Union Project. 
 
MM  15:19   
Did you have, so you have the one line that you developed out of your work with your friends. And then did you 
have other lines or other styles that you were developing before you left Union Project? 
 
JVB  15:32   
Yeah, I did. I did one other, developed another line for other friends who another, another pair that got married, 
that's my porcelain line. And it has sort of a green base, and then growing out of that are drop, you know, slight 
line drawings of like flowers and ferns. And that friend that I made those for, we did some flower farming 
together. And I sort of designed those just to their aesthetic, and then I also can continue to make those 
afterwards. So I have two main lines, the earthenware and the porcelain, and both of them came out of sort of 
commissions for friends. 
 
MM  16:21   
That's really nice. 
 
JVB  16:22   
Yeah. 
 
MM  16:26   
So when you were deciding to shift to full time, what, what kinds of considerations did you have in mind, then as 
far as, that's a, that's a big change in your work. 
 
JVB  16:38   
It was, yeah, it was really, it was really scary, not so much in the financial sense, though, it is scary to give up a 
regular salary, but I have a, you know, partner who also makes a regular salary, so I didn't feel as nervous about 
that component of it. I was really nervous to give up, or to feel like I was losing so much of the meaningfulness 
that was part of my job at Union Project. I had, I was investing in this place that I was, I felt like was doing really 
good work, just in my, in my community, in my neighborhood, it's only a couple blocks away from my house, like 
walk to work. I had made over the years, so many close friends, all of my studio mates now were co-op members, 
that were part of the co op over the years when I was managing it. And I just constantly had opportunities to teach 
and opportunities to connect and collaborate with people. And I felt a lot of fulfillment in the social interaction I 
got from the, my other, from the co-op members. And, and in all the programs that I would facilitate, I sort of had, 
I felt like I had access to, just like a tool that would help me, like, connect with people through the program. And I 
was giving that up. And I, that made me really nervous. So when I first started working on my own, I, I took on a 
number of teaching opportunities, and also joined up with three of my ceramic peers and we started our own small 
studio. And it's not a community studio, it's sort of our own private workspace. But it still was able to help me not 
be isolated. I think when I first decided to leave, my plan was to just work out of my home in my basement. And I 
didn't think very much about the reality of that until that was not the plan and I thought back on it and thought, oh 
my goodness, that would have been so horrible to be stuck in my basement all by myself. I think I wouldn't have 
thrived nearly as much as I did when I left. But yeah, it was really, it was really scary because I just I loved my 
work at Union Project so much that it was a really hard transition to shift away from that. 
 
MM  19:28   
So what year was it that you left there? 
 
JVB  19:33   
Two years ago, so 2016, early 2016. 
 
MM  19:44   
Is that when you established this workspace with other potters? 
 
JVB  19:48   
Yep, yep. Yeah, so I yeah, yeah. So when I decided to leave, Keith and Joe, Keith Hershberger and Joe Delphia 
also decided to leave the co op and we started a studio with Reiko Yamamoto is our fourth studio mate. And the 
space that we found is about 10 minutes away from our homes here in Highland Park, and was a ceramic studio 
that just happened to be, the people were, the people had grown, the business had outgrown the space, and they 
were moving out of it. So it came open. Reiko called me and asked if I was interested in sharing it, and Keith and 
Joe and I had already talked about finding a place. So the four of us sort of all got together, and it's a really 
affordable space. It's an old storefront in, yeah, the little borough of Sharpsburg. It's kind of an interesting little, 
little town. 
 
MM  20:55   
That's, that's so fortunate that that opened 
 
JVB  20:59   
It is. Yeah. 
 
MM  21:01   
So what was the process of setting that up, and deciding what to do with that space like? 
 
JVB  21:17   
We, we, I think we all just four met and talked about before we decided whether the four of us could make it 
work, I think we talked about sharing the space and what that would look like. We've reconfigured things since 
that original setup. Joe, we were going to have a packing and shipping area in the back. And that ended up getting 
nixed and Joe made this like back room his studio. So each of us sort of have our own private, not private, our 
own designated workspace. And then there's communal storage space in the basement, which is sort of a game 
changer to have a lot of storage space. Because we all have I think the space is about 1400 square feet. And then 
there's all of that, again, in storage in the basement. So the four of us each probably have, I don't know, a little 200 
square foot spot in the main space. And then there's communal area for kilns, a communal glazing area and then 
like a central table that can be sort of multipurpose and gets used for packing, shipping, loading kilns, glazing, big 
projects, that kind of stuff. 
 
MM  22:35   
That sounds really nice. Do you do share equipment? 
 
JVB  22:39   
We do. Yep. So I contributed a slab roller and a kiln. And then Joe, Keith and Reiko each contributed a kiln, and 
they all happen to be different sizes. So depending on what project you're working on, what you need, you just 
sign up for the kiln that you want. So we have a shared calendar, shared Google Calendar, you just sign up for 
accounts. And then each kind of firing and each specific kiln has a cost associated with it, which is something I 
had to figure out at the beginning. So that was part of setting it up, calculating the, the cubic feet and the 
temperature was going to and so I have a spreadsheet and I input everyone's firings and then I handle the electric 
bills. Reiko handles paying rent, Joe handles paying the gas bill, we have rotating weeks of cleaning the studio. 
There's, there's a lot of benefit to, a lot of logistical benefit to sharing a space with other people. None of us are 
shouldered with the full burden of rent, we can share. I would never have been able to afford, you know, three or 
four kilns. We can share, you know, the burden of you know, kiln maintenance and cleaning a big space like that. 
And taking out the, remembering to take out the trash and little things like that is really, really helpful. We go in 
on like big orders of materials together, that kind of stuff. 
 
MM  24:20   
That's great. That would be really nice. So this, at the point that you started this, the Highland Park tour have been 
going on for a while. Tell me about starting that tour. And what that was like. 
 
JVB  24:40   
Yeah, so I, it wasn't my brainchild, Keith, I think came up with the original idea and then pulled a couple of us in. 
Yeah, so I'm not even, I couldn't even speak to how he came up with it, but I'm sure that he's on the record for that 
part. I just, it was, I think four or five guys, one of which, he has moved to Baltimore now. And then Joe, Keith, 
and Jeff, who's the other host, Adam, who's has moved and then I was invited in also. And I remember going over 
to Keith house one night to chat about it. And we sort of just came up with a plan and it must have been in 2010, 
because that's, I think it's in its eighth, going on its eighth year now. It's, it's such a special event, it's grown. It's 
my, it's my most successful sale of the year, it's my most favorite sale of the year, it's grown every year, which is 
really encouraging and exciting. That's been part of the challenge, I think with it is to figure out how to keep it 
growing when the size of our homes is sort of not getting any bigger. And that's, I mean, we have, we send out 
surveys every year, and that's one of the main critiques is that sometimes the houses can be really crowded. But 
yeah, we all, each host sort of has autonomy over who they invite, we will sometimes meet and throw around 
names and see if, you know, anybody wants to take some, you know, and some people who we've either 
connected with or heard about or doing good work in Pittsburgh or beyond. One of the ways we've tried to grow 
is to invite people from outside the city. So Keith is having a guest from Philadelphia this, this year, I think he and 
Joe are both having guests from Philadelphia this year. I sort of came up with my own personal rule to rotate 
guests through every two years to sort of keep things different at my house. It wasn't this exact same stop every 
single year. I've broken that rule. But that was what I was going for for a while. Yeah. 
 
MM  27:19   
Yeah, that's really neat. So what kind of, I mean, you said you send out surveys, what kind of tracking do you do 
year to year and how, how do you get this sense of growth... 
 
JVB  27:32   
We track, we have, we have people sign in, and when they sign in, they get a little passport. And each passport 
has the different stops on it, and they get stamped at each passport and then you turn in the passport at the, at your 
last stop. And we entice people to do that by, by offering them into a drawing for free pots, we always give away 
some free pots every year. But we get their contact information when they sign up to get the passport and then we 
see where they, you know, where they start. So we can see which stop they start at and we can see where they end 
that we can see the average of how many stops people go to. I think that's what we get from the passports and then 
we send out email surveys afterward and get feedback on what worked and what didn't if people have suggestions 
for improvements or things they want to see in the future. And then we also ask about their purchases, if they 
purchase, how many stops they purchased work at. So we get that data. It's not. It's not numbers, not spending 
numbers, but it's something. 
 
JVB  28:51   
And then Union Project is a partner in the event also. And because they're a nonprofit, they can support the tour in 
sort of a unique way where they can go after sponsorships and media sponsorships and we partner. Standard 
Ceramic Supply is the local clay supplier, and they have sponsored it since its inception. And then most recently, 
in the last, I think just last year, and then this year, again, the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, which is just down 
the street, approached us about wanting to sponsor and participate in some way support the tour, as, as just a 
activity that happens in the neighborhood that they think is great. And as a fellow neighbor. They also have a little 
sort of archaeological ceramic museum on their campus. So they, we're pulling that in as a little point of interest, I 
think this year. 
 
MM  29:57   
That's really neat. As far as how you, how you set up and plan for your house, what you do and how you work 
through that... 
 
JVB  30:09   
I try to keep my house looking more like a house and less like a gallery. 
 
JVB  30:18   
But that's part of the challenge, is how much, I mean that's part of the question is, and strategies, how much 
furniture do you move out, I like to, I leave my couches and this big coffee table in here. And I set up pots here 
and, because I like to have a space for people to sit down and hang out for a while. So we usually have the fire on 
and sometimes people just camp out for a couple hours even, they'll just hang out, which is good. That's what I 
sort of want to facilitate in, that sort of feels like the benefit of having it, an event in your home, is that it feels like 
a place where you can be comfortable and have a completely different sort of shopping experience. Or not 
shopping or just like experience in general just looking and talking and eating and all those kind of experiences. 
We have a big entryway so I, we set up shelves in the entryway. And we have this big red sort of China cabinets, I 
move out all of my pots that I, all of my personal collection and move in pots for sale. So we clear out like the 
mug rack. And we'll have a mix of people's things here. I tend to organize my house more by giving each artist an 
area and then we have some sort of communal spaces, whereas I think the other guys often will just mix things in 
and sort of set it up as one, one cohesive gallery and mine is more like areas for, for people, just sort of a different 
approach I think, to the layout. 
 
MM  31:58   
Do you ever get to visit each other's houses? 
 
JVB  32:00   
We tried to, sort of before and after hours. And sometimes I think we've all sort of hired or traded for or recruited 
help with managing checkout, that was a piece of feedback that we got early on, from attendees, that the artists 
were too busy checking people out and wrapping pots to really get to talk to them. And part of, a huge part of the 
pitch and value of the event is that you get to meet and talk with the potters in, in our homes. And so if we're too 
busy, yeah putzing with checkout, then we can't, we don't get as much of that interaction. I feel really self 
conscious about leaving during the tour for that same reason. So I try to visit the other people's houses before or 
after. It's two days, so you sort of get four when, you know... 
 
MM  33:02   
Had you attended other pottery tours before participating in this? 
 
JVB  33:07   
I think I ever had. I, I don't feel like, I mean Calvin where I went to school was just a such a small liberal arts 
school with not a very strong arts program. So I didn't, I didn't really feel like I was immersed in like clay culture 
until many years later in Pittsburgh when I really got committed to ceramics or I was, really got involved in 
ceramics. So I don't think I've ever been to another pottery, I ever had been to another pottery tour. But it's from 
what I've what I know now that this sort of urban setting for a pottery tour is pretty unique. They're often in more 
rural settings, and they're often in people's studios. Very rarely just in, in your house. 
 
MM  34:08   
It's the only one I know of, 
 
MM  34:09   
Really? 
 
MM  34:10   
But I'm so focused on the Midwest. I think there might be one other that's homes, but I'm not... 
 
JVB  34:17   
Yeah, I don't know. I know that there's a, an urban pottery tour in Philadelphia. And they it's branded as like the 
Philadelphia urban pottery tour, specifically. 
 
JVB  34:29   
But I still think that those are studios and not homes. 
 
MM  34:33   
Yeah, well, and I guess some places there seems to be, at least like in Michiana for example, there's so many, my 
home is here, my studio is here, and it's just kind of, less of a come into my house and buy pottery...  
 
JVB  34:47   
Right. Right.  
 
MM  34:47   
kind of situation, so. And of course, you're in December. So coming inside is a good thing. 
 
JVB  34:55   
Yeah. Yeah. The weather is such a factor always even, even for indoor things. people in Pittsburg. Don't like bad 
weather. 
 
MM  35:05   
Fair enough.  
 
JVB  35:06   
Yeah.  
 
MM  35:07   
Have you had challenging years due to weather? 
 
JVB  35:10   
We have had some, like, dead Sundays when it's snowing or something like that. This past year, I think was really 
mild the year before that was, like, 70 degrees, something horribly not right. And then I think the year before that, 
we had some serious snow. I think it deters people from driving. But, I find it very charming to be so cozy in here 
with, hunkered down with food and the fire and seeing the snow outside. We always make sure to get the 
Christmas tree up before the tour and we sell ornaments off of it. 
 
MM  35:47   
That's nice... So that's obviously a really big sale for you. I think you said your biggest. Now that you've shifted to 
doing this full time, what are some of the other big sales that you do? Or what are, what's your work schedule 
like? 
 
JVB  36:12   
So I, my work schedule shifted, shifted a lot when I had a baby, which was a year and a half ago. I before then 
would work all the time, Really long days, I'd stay at the studio from morning until really late at night and then 
work almost every weekend day also, just because I felt like it's, it's just, I was figuring out I think I was figuring 
out sort of my strategy and how to balance my workload, I didn't now how to say, I was too afraid to say no to 
anything, because I was just starting out and I felt like turning down opportunities for work felt really scary. So I 
said yes to everything at the beginning. I worked all the time. Then I had Rosie and had to figure out some way to, 
to not work so much. 
 
JVB  37:20   
I couldn't work all the time I had, I wanted to hang out with my kid. So I work four full time days, I work Tuesday 
through Friday, and she goes to a really, really great in-home daycare with some friends of ours. My husband 
drops her off and picks her up. It's right by his school where he teaches, and I don't work on the weekends, unless 
it's like after she went to bed and I'm under a deadline. But I try to just relax when I'm at home. That's the other 
really important thing about having my studio outside of my house, is I'm able to give myself some boundaries. 
When you own your own business, it's really hard to feel okay about not working. I think that's probably true for 
everybody, no matter what you're, what you're doing or making or whatever. And so for me, it's really helpful to 
have my studio outside of my house. So my latest shift is I do a couple events. The pottery tour is a great one. I try 
to do more local things. The only things I do out of town are the Central Pennsylvania's Festival for the Arts in 
State College, and I do a couple events in Washington DC, usually one or two in Washington DC. It's sort of nice 
to grow my market, my sort of direct buyers market in other cities besides just Pittsburgh. So I do Three Rivers 
Arts Festival, I do another local one called Handmade Arcade. It's at the convention center in December, and 
that's a really big one. So mostly just Pittsburgh events, and then those two other ones. I'm trying to do more 
direct to consumers sales and less through galleries and wholesale. I think my prices would need to be adjusted 
way higher, to do more of that. Or at least that's what I learned when I was working, working, working. And now 
I still make the same amount. And I work a lot less. Because I tried, I've tried to focus on more online sales, more 
meeting people in person at sales, which is also what I really like. And then I also added a third line of ceramic, of 
porcelain jewelry, and that I am pursuing wholesale for. So that's, sort of, feels like a, it's still clay. But it behaves 
like a totally different product, it's, the markup is higher from pottery to, from, for jewelry rather than pottery, 
there's a lot less loss, it's quicker to make, the material cost is a lot lower, it's just a lot more manageable. So I can 
supplement sort of my pottery with my jewelry sales. And then that also gives me an opportunity to do some 
wholesale. Yeah, so that's my, that's my latest strategy. 
 
MM  40:42   
That's really interesting. Do you have wholesale jewelry customers who also buy pottery from you? 
 
JVB  40:47   
Um, I have, I have like precious few. I sell to the Society for Contemporary Craft in Pittsburgh, that's in the Strip 
District in Pittsburg. So like really great, really great ones that I just can't say no to, I'll do that for. But yeah I'm 
trying not to do much wholesale of pottery at all. Unless they beg me. 
 
MM  41:18   
It's good that you know what works for you. 
 
JVB  41:20   
I think, I think alternatively, the option would be to increase my prices a lot. And I am so leery to do that because 
I want it to be accessible to people. And so this is the way to do that, is to just sell directly. 
 
MM  41:38   
That's great. As far as customer interaction, I'm always curious to hear what kind of feedback you get from 
customers, or what you've learned from selling directly to customers. 
 
JVB  41:50   
Yeah, that's actually one of the one of the big benefits of doing these big arts festivals for they're really exhausting 
things to do. And some people do a lot of them and do circuits. And I just do two. And I still feel like the two are 
really exhausting. But every time I do it, I every time I do it, I think why am I doing this and then afterwards, I 
think, okay, this is like, one of the big benefits of doing this is you get mass feedback on your, on your work. 
Because there's just crowds and crowds of people coming in and giving you way more feedback than you get 
online, there's social media, but there's something so different about people just walking by and coming in and 
having a conversation with you, or making comments about things right there, you know, while they see things or 
it catches their eye, and they say something about it. And you don't really get anything, any, you don't get much of 
that with online purchases. So it's, it's an opportunity to yeah, get feedback, and then also get to meet the people 
that, that they're buying, that are buying the work. So and that's really valuable. It does also often give me sort of a 
fresh perspective on things. And, when I have my head down in the studio, and I'm just producing, producing, 
producing, it's really hard to get perspective or even, like, realize what I'm creating, or what I'm doing often until 
it's finished and out there. And the nice thing about it too, is it's set up sort of in mass, and I can sort of see it all 
together and I can, and I can get people's reactions to it. 
 
JVB  42:47   
It helps me see things differently, too because other people are, have different perspectives on it, and so they'll 
say, it reminds me of a Scandinavian style, or it makes me think, of I don't know, whatever. Or they associate, one 
of the things I like about the earthenware pots that have all different drawings on them is that people will have 
their, well, they'll sort of imprint their own associations with those images on to them. And it wasn't what I 
thought of when I did it. But you know, they have, you know, a story of their Grandma, who always took them 
cherry picking, and that's why, you know, that plate is meaningful to them or whatever. So that kind of experience 
is really meaningful to me, too. Which is why I haven't cut out the big arts festivals, even though they're so much 
work, some people love them. I think Keith loves them. Right, they're, they drain me. 
 
MM  44:07   
It's a lot of work. It's really a lot of work. I used to do some art fairs. It's exhausting. 
 
JVB  44:45   
It is exhausting. It is partially why I feel like I'm just really picky about which ones I do.  
 
MM  44:53   
Yeah. It's got to be a good experience for you, gotta be the right crowd. 
 
JVB  44:58   
Yeah. 
 
MM  45:04   
Do you, do you find you get different kinds of feedback or tend to have different kinds of conversations when 
you're talking with other potters versus customers who aren't potters? 
 
JVB  45:14   
Yeah, I think so. I mean, potters will just talk technical stuff a lot. And I think my work often sort of bridges, sort 
of general appeal and potter appeal. I think, I think part of part of what makes my current work engaging to 
people who aren't potters is the imagery. I think it's easier for people to engage if it has, like, an image of an 
object on it, if that makes sense? 
 
MM  46:00   
It does make sense. Yeah, absolutely. Do you feel like that helps your online sales to have like, this has cherries 
on it. And people can search for cherry? Did you feel like that helps? 
 
JVB  46:13   
I mean, I haven't noticed, my, my online shop isn't so so well honed that I have all the right tags on everything, so 
I probably could be better, I probably could see better results from that. I'm sure it does. I mean, part of what the 
bummer about selling things online is that people can't see it and touch it and feel it and experience it in person. 
So they can't feel the weight of it and the comfort of the handle and the thinness of the lip and the sheen of the 
glaze. It's all just based on what photos they, there are. But I think having images on things helps, helps sell 
things, just because yeah, I think it's easier for people to approach. Rather than sort of the nuanced flame path on a 
wood fired mug that you, it's really so much nicer to experience in person, I think. 
 
MM  47:22   
Absolutely. Yeah. That is, it's kind of an interesting balance in ceramics that I hear people talk about how great it 
is to get work out online and to ship things off online. And, and yet, customers miss out on so much, or potential 
customers miss out on so much. 
 
MM  47:41   
Yeah, absolutely. What kind of a turnaround time do you... 
 
JVB  47:41   
Yeah, I feel a lot of responsibility when I ship things, that they be really perfect. And I mean not perfect, but they 
will be really high quality and my attention to detail be like extremely, extremely careful because people don't get 
to see every inch of it. And they're sort of trusting me to send them this, you know, my high quality standard of 
what I make. It's a little bit, it's a little bit of like a trust game. A big thing that's been successful for me lately is 
offering the earthenware pots as made-to-order, which is a little bit more pressure on me to make sure that that 
specific thing comes out of the kiln. So I usually make double of all of those. But they can, people can choose 
their color, and they can choose their drawing so they can sort of connect really personally with what they are 
buying, but it's, they also don't get to see a photograph of exactly what they're buying. So it's sort of a big trust 
exercise for that sort of order.  
 
JVB  48:53   
I usually do like three to four weeks, about a month. 
 
MM  48:58   
Tell me about your, your process. I mean, obviously, you have different lines. But if you could just talk through a 
little bit of what your process looks like for different things. 
 
JVB  49:05   
Yeah, I usually, I usually do cycles for each, for each sort of line. So whether it's the jewelry, or the porcelain 
pottery or the earthenware pottery, I'll do like a cycle of making, so I'll make a kiln, I have to sort of fill the kiln to 
make it efficient. So I'll make a batch of earthenware pots and make sure to get in any of the made to order things 
and then think about what is low in stock and what, what sales opportunities I have coming up and sort of what 
will sell there. I have all of my sales data from past sales over the years, so I usually just look back at what sold in 
the past and then make according to that. So for the earthenware I do both slab-built and wheel thrown pieces. The 
mugs and cups and vases are all wheel thrown and the plates are all hand-built. The timing is really tricky. The 
pots have to be this perfect leather hard state before I add the color on to it. If it's too dry, when I try to do the 
drawing it will chip it won't give me a nice, fine clean line. So I have to keep them wet in time for me to 
underglaze them. And then I do the drawing, let them dry, clean them up a little bit, and then I bisque fire them 
and then I add a clear glaze and fire them again. The porcelain pieces are also some hand-built some wheel-
thrown. And then I do the carving right into the porcelain with an Exacto knife and let them dry, and then I inlay 
them with a technique called mishima. So I do a like, watered down colored clay. It's like a thin underglaze. And I 
paint it on to the whole, all the lines, and then wipe it away. So everywhere that I carved, the color stays in the 
line and then I wipe the surface away. And then I add the green on to the bottom. And then bisque fire it. And 
then I do sort of like a watercolor wash on some of the some of the flowers and leaves, and then clear glaze it and 
then fire it again. So that, the porcelain line is a bit more labor intensive. 
 
MM  49:11   
Seems like it. 
 
JVB  49:59   
Which is also why I just I have to say no to wholesaling it. It's just too, too much work and not, not high enough 
of a mark-up.  
 
MM  51:49   
Yeah. 
 
JVB  51:50   
My time is just so often the limiting factor for me. So. 
 
MM  51:54   
Yeah, yeah. Were those techniques things that you learned in school or things that you experimented with over the 
years? 
 
JVB  52:04   
Yeah, they were things I experimented with, I didn't really do much surface decoration stuff in college, my 
ceramic education was pretty, pretty, I would say pretty basic in college, just sort of like the fundamentals. And 
then I felt like my time at Union Project was sort of like a master's degree in both arts administration and 
ceramics. I was around lots of other potters who knew way more than I did. And just because I was working on 
certain projects I would research it and try things out. And I was working in a ceramic studio. So I just had access 
to constant firings and materials and, it was really being in that environment that got me to, that taught me so 
much. 
 
MM  52:05   
Yeah. What kinds of resources did you turn to for researching different techniques?  
 
JVB  53:08   
Oh, there was a massive backlog of ceramics arts, of Ceramics Monthly magazine. So I would look through those 
lot. Ceramic Arts Daily, which is Ceramic Monthly's daily email, they have collections of glazes and videos of 
techniques, potters doing different techniques. That was, that's a really good one. What else? Other, just other 
potters online. Instagram came up partway through my time at Union Project and that was a, that's a huge resource 
just for seeing, just for learning about other artists. I think that's really how I learned about a lot of potters, in, and 
a lot of potters will share process and product sort of shots, and so... I have, I have a, I feel like a majority of my 
following on Instagram are clay people. And so anything that I do that talks about technical stuff, or videos of 
process are way more fan favorites than other things. 
 
MM  54:26   
That's, that's always interesting to to think about sort of the in-group and the outsiders who actually... 
 
JVB  54:34   
I know, I don't know, I don't know how to get non-potter followers. But yeah.  
 
MM  54:40   
I don't. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Something I need to learn more about is ceramics online is its own 
world. 
 
JVB  54:50   
It is its own world. And it's totally, it's been a game changer, I think for people.Yeah, you can even just like 
crowdsource something, if you're having a technical question about some weird cracking or crazing or something. 
And people will chime in with all different theories on what it could be.  
 
MM  55:08   
That's amazing. Wow. 
 
JVB  55:10   
It's really, it's really valuable.  
 
MM  55:11   
Yeah, that's, that's really neat. Kind of look back through my notes, and see what we've covered... So is your, is 
your family involved in your work now? Or is it, is it mostly something you do alone? 
 
JVB  55:41   
Well, my husband gets roped into any building projects I have. So he usually, he will build my shelves and 
display boards and those sorts of things. But he, him, Dave and Rosie will come with me to my shows, all my 
shows, which partially started because I was nursing and so she needed to come with me if I was going to keep 
doing those things, if I wasn't going to take... I took a, I took three months off when I had her but then I did, I did 
shows this past summer and.. So I'm, I don't know how it will change when she gets older and it's not as easy to, 
to just schlep her along to shows. But for now, all three of us go and Dave and I set up and then he'll hang out 
with Rosie during the day. And I'll stay at the booth during the day. The rest of my family's still in Detroit. And 
they always just come down for the pottery tour.  
 
MM  56:49   
That's really nice.  
 
JVB  56:50   
Yeah, my mom handles the spread of food every year, which is so, so helpful and so sweet. 
 
MM  56:58   
That is really nice. Does your, does your dad still make pots at all, or is he mostly just... 
 
JVB  57:03   
No. I need to invite him to be a guest at my house and then he'll be forced to make pots. He can make them, he's 
really really talented. He's so overwhelmed with work stuff. I think maybe in retirement, maybe in a couple years 
when he retires, he'll get back to making pots. I still have some of his pots that I use in the house. But yeah, he 
hasn't made pots in a long time. 
 
MM  57:31   
So what's next for you? What's on the horizon? You expect...? 
 
JVB  57:38   
Oh, I don't know. I think, I think about, I don't know if I will or not, I think about buying a building in Pittsburgh, 
I think we're sticking around Pittsburgh for the foreseeable future. So I think it could make sense for me to buy a 
space, to have a space. And to provide space for other, other artists, other potters, other ceramic artists 
specifically. That doesn't really exist in Pittsburgh, and even Union Project, they have a co-op, but it's a shared 
community studio. So there's not private studio space for artists. And there's, you're sharing with, you know, all 
the other classes and open studio people and pumpkin carving workshops and those sorts of things. So and then 
otherwise, it's private studios, like people going out on their own and finding small space and just working on 
their own. And I feel like my background at Union Project, my time at Union Project, and now my shift to just 
being the four of us in the smaller studio space. And having my own space within that space has made me realize 
the value of having other people around I really, I think it can be really challenging and limiting to just be 
working in isolation all the time. So I think that there's just real value to that. I also felt really empowered when I 
first moved out of working at Union Project to having my own space and having my own table and my own 
shelves, where I could leave something in, in process and I could have enough storage space, it's just really 
empowering to be productive and work sort of the way you need to work and, and I want, I like making 
opportunities for other people. And I think down the road when I'm ready to make things more complicated for 
myself again, I could see myself buying a building and chopping it up into space for other people to work. 
 
MM  1:00:05   
Yeah. 
 
JVB  1:00:06   
You know, that's really well equipped for ceramic artists, that has kiln hookups and proper ventilation and sinks 
and all of that and not just making do, like something that's really good. So I think that probably is like, long term, 
down the road. It's been really, it was really nice to shift and just think about making my own work, and only 
having myself to manage and deal with and that was such a nice transition that I don't really quite feel ready to 
shift back into a management administrative role. But, yeah, and in the meantime, scaling back on some 
wholesale commitments has also allowed me to do like custom projects for cafes and restaurants. So that's been 
sort of also a fun, supplemental addition to my just normal line of work. 
 
MM  1:01:13   
That's neat. So what kinds of, what kinds of custom projects have you done? 
 
JVB  1:01:20   
I've done a handful of restaurants in Pittsburgh. A restaurant called The Vandal ordered custom espresso and 
cortado cups, and there is a restaurant called Bar Marco on the strip, and they have a wine room where they do 
these fancy wine dinners, and so they ordered some plates that they use in the wine room. The, there's a new cafe 
in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, which is like, 45 minutes away from me here. And they bought, they're a bakery and 
they just opened a cafe and they bought all teacups and cappuccino cups and, and espresso cups for their cafe. It's 
just a really special edition. 
 
Video File #2 (afc2018030_05080_sr02.wav) 
 
JVB  0:00   
They did a really beautiful job with the space and thought about a lot of details and went out of their way to get in 
touch with me. And that was a very, like, very collaborative project. Whereas my friends, when I was first 
creating these pots, sort of gave me complete control over what they would look like. Which is, I think, why I 
continued to make them. The custom stuff for the restaurants, I haven't continued to make any of those because 
they felt very, very specific to them. And were, I would say, like a collaboration between their, like a unifying of 
their vision and my vision, or their vision and my style. I'm working on one right now for an organization called 
The Beauty Shop they're a co-working space, they create co-working like office spaces, and they're opening a new 
space on the south side in Pittsburgh and adding a coffee shop. So they're having custom espresso cups and 
cappuccino cups. 
 
MM  0:35   
That's really nice. 
 
JVB  0:36   
Yeah, and it's, it's fun to do different things. It's fun to learn. It's like trying to figure out technical, technical 
solutions to things. So I learn a ton in the process. They are also sometimes really tricky to figure out how to 
navigate what they have in mind and what's realistic, and the ceramics process, especially if people don't know a 
lot about the ceramic process, it can be really tricky. Because, you know, glazes are not just like paint and you 
can't just tweak the color a little bit without a lot of testing and a lot of firing. So it's been one of the more fun and 
more challenging things that I've done, are sort of collaborative things, but that's not that surprising. 
 
MM  1:19   
Yeah, well, I'm sure it was an education for them too, to find out what was possible, or not?  
 
JVB  2:15   
Right. 
 
MM  2:16   
Yeah. Are there people, are there potters who have been, whose work has influenced you? Or who have been 
mentors through all this, or? 
 
JVB  2:30   
Work has influenced me... I mean, I definitely think a lot of the people who have influenced me have just been my 
peers here in Pittsburgh and some of the co-op members who were members when I was managing the studio. I 
mean, anytime I have a technical question I'll just call Joe Delphia who's a ceramics professor at CCAC here, at 
the community college here in Pittsburgh. And Keith and I bounce ideas off of each other all the time. Reiko my 
other studio mate is really honest and has a really, like, good, a good eye and I trust her. So definitely my, I would 
say definitely my studio mates but, but also I just, I feel like I have such a rich ceramic community here because 
of all the work I did at Union Project and having co-op members cycle through over the years. So the, the 
national, the NCECA conference, the National Council on Education for Ceramic Arts. That was, it's an annual 
conference that was here in Pittsburgh this past year, and it was really fun to have past co-op members who have 
moved away all come back. We had a pottery tour, a special NCECA version of the pottery tour, so they got to 
come by my house. Yeah, it was really sweet. 
 
MM  4:05   
That's really neat. I want to be conscious of the time, I know you have to go soon. I always just like to ask kind of 
an open ended question at the end. Is there anything I haven't asked? Or anything that's important in your work 
that you would want to share?  
 
JVB  4:26   
I mean, I don't think so. I think, I think we covered a lot of it. I think, it's interesting to talk about sort of my 
trajectory and starting with, sort of like the value of art and community for my family, and then experiencing 
really powerful community in college, so much so that we moved here together. And then my pots being made for 
those people in my community, and doing community-building work at Union Project. It just, yeah, I feel like it's 
really obvious to me now that I'm talking, talking, talking, that there's a very much a common thread about what's 
important to me. And I mean, part of what I love about making pots is the fact that they're used to share meals and 
often are given as gifts. That's one of my favorite things about getting orders and packing shipments and writing, 
writing birthday notes to people and, as their sister is sending them a mug or something like that. But yeah... 
 
MM  5:39   
I love that. That's really, well, I mean I think that's what drew me to this project, too, was to learn about people 
who are really driven by community. Thank you for your time.  
 
JVB  5:48   
Yeah. 
 
MM  5:48   
I appreciate it. 
 
JVB  5:49   
Of course.
