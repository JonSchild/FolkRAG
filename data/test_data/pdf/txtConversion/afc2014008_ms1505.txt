Dear Dr. Prator:
 
I have r
ecently been informed that Mrs. Bess Hawes  c
ontract

t S
an Fernando Valley S
tate C
ollege will not be renewed f
or the new
 
academic year.
 
I am an anthropology major and have taken f
ive c
ourses in
 
the Anthropology Department, two of which were with Mrs. Hawes.  I
 
f
ound her at all tinies to be an interesting and inspirational teacher
 
with an extraordinary knowledge of the c
ourses she taught and a unique
 
ability not only to impart this knowledge to the students, but to excite
 
their interest and enthusiasm in the subject matter.  Furthermore, I
 
believe that her s
pecialty s
hould be included in the c
urriculum of the
 
A
nthropology Department.
 
I hope that the decision not to renew her c
ontract i
s not an
 
irrevocnble o
ne a
nd will be reconsidered.

arms. But
 
Bess was not much i
nvolved i
n a
ll of
 
t
his. Her mother had d
ied shortly be-
f
ore, and Bess had been s
ent t
o a
 
boarding school i
n Dallas.
 
Always a good s
tudent, Bess s
tudied
 
hard a
t t
he boarding school and l
ater
 
a
t a public school; a
t t
he age o
f f
if-
t
een, she became a s
tudent a
t t
he Uni-
versity o
f Texas. Here began her as-
sociation with t
he world o
f f
olk music.
 
Through her f
ather and Alan, she met
 
several t
raditional s
ingers, i
ncluding
 
Leadbelly and t
he Gant f
amily, and was
 
i
nspired t
o begin s
tudying f
olk music
 
i
n a serious way. Her s
tudies a
t t
hat
 
t
ime were entirely f
rom t
he v
iewpoint
 
of  t
he  collector-scholar,  with no
 
t
hought o
f performing.
 
After a year a
t t
he University, she
 
j
oined her f
ather and brother i
n Wash-
i
ngton, D
.C., where t
hey were working
 
on a second book -- Our S
inging Coun-
t
r .
 Bess had t
he j
ob of t
ranscribing
 
th  words f
rom hundreds o
f f
ield re-
cordings, made on scratchy o
ld a
lumi-
num d
iscs; she a
lso helped Ruth Craw-
f
ord Seeger i
n t
he t
ranscribing o
f t
he
 
t
unes.
 
I
t was shortly after t
his book got
 
safely o
ff t
o t
he printers t
hat Bess
 
t
ook up t
he guitar. Her f
ather had j
ust
 
married t
he Dean o
f Wo men a
t t
he
 
University o
f Texas, and he i
nvited
 
Bess t
o go a
long on a honeymoon
 
ocean voyage t
o Europe. Somewhat
 
d
iffident about being t
he t
hird party
 
i
n t
his s
ituation, Bess f
ound a
 way t
o
 
keep herself out o
f t
he way, but gain-
f
ully occupied; she spent $
15 f
or a
 
second-hand guitar and t
aught herself
 
t
o p
lay i
t during t
he voyage.
 
She had, o
f course, no t
eacher: she
 
d
idn't even have an i
nstruction book.
 
Luckily, t
he guitar's previous owner
 
had pencilled on t
he t
op t
he l
etter-
names o
f t
he open s
trings, so Bess
 
was able t
o t
une i
t; f
rom t
here on, i
t
 
was a
ll up t
o her. On t
he way t
o
 
Europe, she f
igured out how t
o p
lay
 
t
he chords o
f G
, C, and D-seventh;on
 
t
he way home, she "invented" t
he
 
chords f
or t
he key o
f A-minor. With
 
t
hese f
ew chords, she f
ound she was
 
able t
o do quite satisfactory accom-
pani ments, and d
iscovered f
or her.-
self t
hat most American f
olk songs
 
are best s
et o
ff by s
imple accompani-
ments o
f t
his sort. Even now, when she
 
can p
lay a
ll t
he chords, she'd rather
 
rely upon s
implicity and good t
aste
 
t
han upon f
lashy modulations and o
ther
 
spectacular t
echniques. Frank Hamil-
t
on once said t
o her, wistfully, "Gee,
 
I
 wish I
 could p
lay n
ice and p
lain t
he
 
way you do!"
 
After t
he t
rip t
o Europe, Bess en-
t
ered  Bryn  Mawr,  where nobody
 
seemed much i
nterested i
n her music.
 
I
n New York City, however, t
here
 
were p
lenty o
f k
indred spirits, and
 
she spent as much t
ime t
here as her
 
s
tudies  would a
llow. The Almanac
 
S
ingers were j
ust beginning t
o get t
o-
gether, and Bess j
oined up with t
he m,
 
a
long with such o
ther l
uminaries as
 
Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Butch
 
Hawes (whom she l
ater married), and
 
a host o
f o
thers. Woody t
aught her t
o
 
p
lay t
he mandolin, and on t
his i
nstru-
ment and t
he guitar, she soon develop-
ed a good solid "back-up" s
tyle which
 
was quite important i
n holding t
he
 
group t
ogether. She a
lso held t
he group
 
t
ogether i
n another way, her infinite
 
patience, wisdo m, and t
act l
eading her
 
i
nto t
he role o
f peace maker -
-
 a
n
 
active and valued role f
or t
his volatile
 
band o
f h
ighly i
ndividualistic musi-
c
ians.
 
The Al manacs broke up, however,
 
soon a
fter t
he beginning o
f World War
 
H, and Bess t

overnment's radio broadcasts t

ope and t
he Near East. She l
ooks back
 
upon t
his experience as an important
 
)
art o
f her education, r
einforcing as
 
i
t d
id her convictions t
hat art and poli-
t
ics are not necessarily very f
ar a-
part, and t
hat she could never be con-
t
ent l
iving i
n an i
vory t
ower o
f musi-
cal exclusivity.
 
Her t
eaching career began when,
 
a
fter t
he war, she and Butch moved
 
t
o Boston. A number o
f parents heard
 
her s
ing f
or a nursery school, and
 
t
hey wanted t
o l
earn how t
o s
ing and
 
accompany
 t
he mselves;  so  Bess
 
organized  an  i
nstrument c
lass. I
f
 
o
ther f
olk i
nstrument c
lasses existed
 
t
hen, Bess d
idn't know about t
hem, and
 
she had t
o make up her own rules. No-

hard t

lass o

ifteenpeople
 
a
t once, with n
ine guitars, f
our banjos,
 
and two mandolins, so she went ahead
 
and d
id i
t -
-  with great success. S
ince
 
t
hen she's been t
old about t
he d
iffi-
culties, but hasn't experienced t
he m
 
herself, and many o
f her c
lasses are
 
s
till s
tructured i
n t
his way. She says
 
t
hey make better music!
 
I
n Boston, her b
lending o
f social
 
consciousness with music prompted
 
her t
o write a
 number o
f songs i
n sup-
port o
f Walter F
. O'Brien, who was
 
running f
or mayor on t
he Progressive
 
Party t
icket.  Mr. O'Brien l

f t
he songs, written
 
i
n
 collaboration  with  Jacqueline
 
S
teiner, t
urned out t

was t
he "M.T.A. Song."
 
By t

ime Bess and Butch and t
he
 
k
ids (who were i
nevitably known as All
 
t
he Pretty Little Hawses) came t
o l
ive
 
i
n Los Angeles, Bess was an estab-
l
ished t
eacher, f
olklorist, and per-
f
ormer.  Her admirable qualities i

One o

n-
s
ight i
nto t
he workings o
f Bess Hawes
 
i
s t
o watch her handle a

ever i

f unhappiness or confusion. The
 
whole setting i
s as i
nformal as can be,
 
yet t
here i
s ample evidence o
f
 a
 skill-
f
ul underlying organization. Bess pre-
sents each new concept i
n t
erms o
f
 
her belief t
hat s
tudents shouldn't be
 
pushed t
oo hard; t
hey should be en-
couraged t
o reach continually f
or new
 
goals, but t
hey shouldn't t
oo often be
 
f
aced with d
ifficulties t
hat see m, a
t
 
t
he  t
ime,  i
nsurmountable.  I
f she
 
senses t
he beginning of a t
oo-hard
 
s
truggle, she quietly l
eads t
he c
lass
 
i
nto something she knows i
t can do
 
well, and self-confidence i
s restored;
 
soon, t
hen, everyone will be ready f
or
 
a f
resh assault upon t
he proble m. Very
 
f
ew s
tudents have ever l
eft one o
f her
 
c
lasses with a f
eeling o
f f
rustration.
 
Bess says t
hat what she calls a
 
"flat-out" beginner can have f

is guitar r

but t

n l
ess
 
t
han a year-and-a-half. All sorts of
 
f
ancy runs and specific f
inger-styles
 
can be me morized earlier, but t
he
 
authority and t
he f
irm control j
ust
 
aren't t
here. Bess i
s quick t
o point
 
-28-
out t
hat her philosophy i
s j
ust one
 
among many equally valid ones, and
 
she l
aughingly says t
hat o
f a
ll t
he
 
scores o
f guitar t
eachers who s
tarted
 
out as her s
tudents, not one o
f t
hem
 
t
eaches by her methods: "They've
 
a
ll gone e
ither more c
lassical or more
 
e
thnic, and t
hey probably don't ap-
prove o
f me. .
.and t
hey a
ll p
lay better
 
t
han I
 do!" What Bess wants t
o do i
s
 
t
o help people t
o develop t
heir own
 
personal s
tyles, and i
n t
his she i
s
 
f
abulously successful.
 
One o
f her i
deas i
s t
hat, i
n order t
o
 
keep i
nterest a
live, t
he s
tudents must
 
produce some decent music a
t every
 
s
tage o
f t
he game. Partly t
o t
his end,
 
she has everybody l
earn t
o s
ing t
he
 
songs, o
ften i
n t
hree- or f
our-part
 
harmony, before a
tte mpting t
o add ac-
companiments. She l
ikes t
o s
tart a
 
c
lass  session i
n t
his way, getting
 
everybody enthusiastic about a
 song,
 
t
hen getting down t
o work on t
he ac-
companiment. Before c
losing, t
hey a
ll
 
do a repeat and practice o
f something
 
t
hey've  a
lready  l
earned,  so  t
hat
 
everybody goes ho me with good music
 
s
till r
inging i
n t
heir ears.
 
Thinking of herself mainly as a
 
scholar and t
eacher, Bess i
s s
till
 
called upon t
o do a great deal o
f per-
f
orming. Her s
inging i
s quiet, a
l most
 
self-effacing,  with  t
he  song i
tself
 
being f
ar more important t
han t
he
 
expression o
f her own personality.
 
Her ad miration o
f some o
f t
he songs
 
i
s obvious; even i
n f
ront o
f t
he l
argest
 
audience, she can become rapt i
n t
he
 
conte mplation of a beautiful melody
 
or a l
ine o
f poetry, and i
s not a
t a
ll
 
concerned with t
he f
act t
hat she i
s
 
t
he person who i
s doing t
he s
inging.
 
This admiration i
s contagious, and
 
countless people have f
irst appre-
c
iated f
olk music upon hearing Bess
 
s
ing. I
t i
s only when she has l
eft t
he
 
s
tage t
hat one realizes how sensitive
 
and skillful a performance she has
 
g
iven.
 
As a concert artist, panelist, l
ec-
t
urer, and t
eacher, Bess has t
o dash
 
about  t
o an endless succession o
f
 
campuses, schools, workshops, i
n-
s
titutes, coffeehouses, banquet halls,
 
and t
heatres. She has been f
eatured
 
i
n most o
f t
he great f
olk f
estivals,
 
i
ncluding t
hose a
t Berkeley, UCLA,
 
San Diego, Long Beach, and Newport;
 
and, f
or a number of summers, she
 
has been on t
he f
aculty o
f t
he f
olk
 
music  workshops  a
t  t
he  I
dyliwild
 
School  o
f  Music  and  t
he Arts, a
 
mountain branch o
f t

f
 
Southern California. Pete Seeger has
 
written o
f her t
hat "
...she can s
ing
 
more songs, and prettier, t
han any
 
Person I
 know."
 
At San Fernando Valley S
tate Col-
l
ege, Bess t
eaches several courses,
 
i
ncluding a general i
ntroduction t
o
 
f
olklore, a survey o
f American f
olk
 
music, and courses of special s
tudies
 
f
or advanced s
tudents. These c
lasses
 
are conducted very much l
ike her
 
"how-to" c
lasses, with t
he friendly
 
i
nformality of t
he a
tmosphere h
iding
 
t
he very careful organization. There
 
i
s a

and Bess has t

ift
 
o
f making every question p
lay an im-
portant part i
n t
he d
iscussion, and
 
o
f guiding t
he d

t goes
 
where she wants i
t t
o go. Her courses
 
are not "Mickey Mouse" courses i

The  skill with which  you  guide  the  growth  and  maturity
 
of  SFVSC has  helped  it  become  the  important  intellectual  an
 
cultural  center  in  the Valley.
 I chose  SFVSC  for  its  acad
 ic
 
environment  and  the  distinguished  faculty  in Anthropology  to
 
begin my  studies  in the  Spring  .f  1965.
 I hold  a BS  from
 
the  University  of  Illinois,  1954,  and  have  taught  school  in
 
Illinois  and  Culver City,  California.
 I am  studying
 nt1'r -
pology with  plans  to  continue  through  a Masters.
 I pr t'r
 
the  many  advantages  of  SFVSC  over  other  schools  I have

careful  organization  makes  it  possible  for  students  to  learn
 
and  think a great  deal  in the  very  relaxed  atmosphere  of  i
'r
 
classroom.
 Time  and  time  again  I have  seen  her  guide  the
 
discussion  the  way  she wants  it  to  go,  while  making every
 
question  and  comment  an  integral  part.
 Students  feel  import-
and  involved  in  her classroom,  and meet  her very  demanlin'
 
research and  study requirements.
 H r  personal  librar
 :p j
 
research  files  are  available  Tor  stud
nt  use  under  her
 
direction.
 She  is  readily available  to  help students  carry
 
the  library research  one  step  further,  and  to  discuss  their
 
ideas  to  stimulate  evaluative  and creative  thinking.
 
She  returns  written  assignments  promptly,  and  with  inc h
 
red  pencil!
 Sloppy  and  incorrect  use  of  Engl ish have  no  ploce
 
in  college,  so  she  underlines  errors •
 She  comments  on  the
 
ideas  expressed,  and  .
tre  uently  relates  the  paper  to  those  the
 
student  has  previously written.
 She  frequently  recommends
 
books  for  further  reading.
 As you  can  imagine,  this  kind  of
 
reaction to  one's  paper  encourages  greater  care  and accuracy
 
of thought  and research  the  next  time •

I am  saying that  she  is  not  an  average  teacher,  but  on

many aspects  of  co1

scholarship.
 
her  enthusiastic  patience  as  a teacher  is  matched  by
 
enthusiastic  energy as  a performing  concert  musician,
 
panelist,  and  lecturer.
 Besides  being well  known  to  Los
 
\ngeles  audiences,  she  has  been  featured  in  such well -h -
foikmusic  festivals  as  UCLA,  Berkeley,  and Newport.
 Her
 
continued  influence  in the  leadership  of  Idyliwild  School
 
of Music  and  the  Arts  (affiliated with  u
sc) and  the  annual
 
Banjo  and Fiddle  Contests  (in  Topanga)  have  he] pe
 them
 row
 
to  influence  serious  study  of America's  music.
 
On many  occasions  I have worked with Mrs.  i
,awes  planning
 
the  Banjo and  Fiddle  Contests.
 She  is  always  tactful  yet
 
honest  in  interpersonal  relationships,  with  the  good  manners
 
of a lady  always  evident.
 Her  patience  and wisdom  facilitate
 
group discussions  and decisions,  and she  never  pressures  or
 
hurries  or  criticizes  destructively.
 This  sensitive and
 
gentle  lady  helps  people  of diverging  (or  emerging)  views
 
work together.
 And  the  projects  she  influences  are  undeniah! . 
successful.
 Books  she  has  helped with  have  sold  through  many
 
editions.
 You must  have  a listing  of  them  in  her  file,  done
 
in  collaboration  with  the  Lomaxes).
 The  UCLA Extension
 
guitar classes  have  consistently been  the  largest  of  any  of
 
their  classes  (and  therefore  the  most  profitable),  and  the
 
Folkmusic  Festivals and  Contests  have  grown  in  size  and
 
stature.

Most people are contented i

hey
 
can make a success o
f one career,
 
but  i
t t
akes  f
our t
o satisfy Bess
 
Hawes. She i
s a

o
f t
hree children; she i
s one o
f t
he
 
best-loved  guitar  t

s i

former; and she i
s an associate

I
t

o f
ind t
ime
 
t
o do so many t
hings, and because
 
she does t
his so well, one would ex-
pect Bess t
o be a
 h
igh-geared, super-
charged sort o
f person. Nothing could
 
be f
urther f
rom t
he t
ruth. She i
s quiet,
 
gentle, and s
ensitive, and her superb
 
sense o
f organization does not work

ffectively f
or being unobtrusive.
 
Everybody  f
eels  "ho mey" around
 
Bess.
 
I
t's not really surprising t
hat Bess
 
i
s i
nterested i
n f
olklore, and has a
 
t
re mendous knowledge o
f i
t
, f
or she
 
was born a Lomax. But even i
f her
 
f
amily background had been d
ifferent,
 
i
t would see m i
nevitable t
hat Bess
 
should t
urn t
o f
olklore as a means o
f
 
t
ying t
ogether t
he various aspects o
f
 
her  d
iverse character. Her i
nnate
 
l
ove f
or people and her respect f
or
 
t
heir i
ndividualities, her desire t
o see
 
a
ll o
f human culture as a s
ingle con-
t
inuous spectrum, and her great musi-
cal t
alent -
-
 a
ll o
f t
hese have f
ound
 
expression i
n t
he s
tudy and perform-
ance o
f f
olk music.
 
As a l
ittle g
irl, she was exposed
 
14
 -26-
more t
o c
lassical t
han t
o f
olk music.
 
She s
tudied l
ong and hard a
t t
he p
iano,
 
gaining a good grounding i
n f
ormal
 
music t
heory which has helped her
 
ever s
ince. During t
his period, her
 
f
ather, John A. Lomax, made h
is l
iv-
i
ng as a banker, and a
lthough t
here
 
was quite a
 b
it of s
inging o
f a
ll k
inds
 
around t
he house, f
olk music as such
 
was not especially i
n evidence.
 
When Bess was about t
en, t
he De-
pression f
orced her f
ather's bank t
o,
 
reduce i
ts s
taff, and Dr. Lo max f
ound
 
h
imself une mployed. So he r
eturned
 
t
o h
is f
irst and greatest i
nterest -
-
t
he collecting and s
tudying o
f f
olklore.
 
He and h
is son Alan, t
hen seventeen,
 
contracted with t
he Macmillan Co m-
pany f
or t
he publication o
f a
 book -
-
American Ballads and Folk Songs
f
or which he had earlier collecf ed
 
most o
f t
he material; t
here were some
 
gaps i
n t
he collection, t
hough, and t
his
 
was re medied by t
heir going i
nto t
he
 
f
ield, collecting new material i
n such
 
p
laces as Southern prison f
arms. But
 
Bess was not much i
nvolved i
n a
ll o
f
 
t
his. Her mother had d
ied shortly be-
f
ore, and Bess had been s
ent t
o a
 
boarding school i
n Dallas.
 
Always a
 good s
tudent, Bess s
tudied
 
hard a
t t
he boarding school and l
ater
 
a
t a public school; a
t t
he age o
f f
if-
t
een, she beca me a s
tudent a
t t
he Uni-
versity o
f Texas. Here began her as-
sociation with t
he world o
f f
olk music.
 
Through her f
ather and Alan, she met
 
several t
raditional s
ingers, i
ncluding
 
Leadbelly and t
he Gant f
amily, and was
 
i
nspired t
o begin s
tudying f
olk music
 
i
n a serious way. Her s
tudies a
t t
hat
 
t
ime were entirely f
rom t
he v
iewpoint
 
of  t
he  collector-scholar,  with no
 
t
hought o
f performing.
 
After a year a
t t
he University, she
 
j
oined her f
ather and brother i
n Wash-
i
ngton, D
. C
., where t
hey were working
 
on a second book --Our S
inging Coun-
.
 Bess had t
he j
ob o
f t
ranscribing
 
words f
rom hundreds o
f f
ield r
e-
cordings, made on scratchy o
ld a
lumi-
num d
iscs; she a
lso helped Ruth Craw-
f
ord Seeger i
n t
he transcribing o
f t
he
 
t
unes.
 
I
t was shortly after t
his book got
 
safely off t
o t
he printers t
hat Bess
 
t
ook up t
he guitar. Her f
ather had j
ust
 
married t
he Dean of Wo men a
t t
he
 
University o
f Texas, and he i
nvited
 
Bess t
o go a
long
 
ocean voyage t
o Europe. Somewhat
 
d
iffident about being t
he t
hird party
 
i
n t
his s
ituation, Bess f
ound a
 way t
o
 
keep herself out of t
he way, but gain-
f
ully occupied; she spent $
15 f
or a
 
second-hand guitar and t
aught herself
 
t
o p
lay i
t during t
he voyage.
 
She had, o
f course, no t
eacher: she
 
d
idn't even have an i
nstruction book.
 
Luckily, t
he guitar's previous owner
 
had pencilled on t
he t
op t
he l
etter-
names o
f t
he open s
trings, so Bess
 
was able t
o t
une i
t; f
rom t
here on, i
t
 
was a
ll up t
o her. On t
he way t
o
 
Europe, she f
igured out how t
o play
 
t
he chords o
f G, C, and D-seventh; on
 
t
he way home, she "invented" t
he
 
chords f
or t
he key o
f A-minor. With
 
t
hese f
ew chords, she f
ound she was
 
able t
o do quite satisfactory accom-
paniments, and d
iscovered f
or her-
self t
hat most American f
olk songs
 
are best set o
ff by s
imple accompani-
ments o
f t
his sort. Even now, when she
 
can p
lay a
ll t
he chords, she'd rather
 
rely upon s
implicity and good t
aste
 
t
han upon f
lashy modulations and o
ther
 
spectacular t
echniques. Frank Hamil-
t
on once said t
o her, wistfully, "Gee,
 
I
 wish I
 could p
lay n
ice and p
lain t
he
 
way you do!"
 
After t
he t
rip t
o Europe, Bess en-
t
ered  Bryn  Mawr,  where nobody
 
seemed much i
nterested I
n her music.
 
I
n New York City, however, t
here
 
were p
lenty o
f k
indred spirits, and
 
she spent as much t
ime t
here as her
 
s
tudies  would a
llow.  The Almanac
 
S
ingers were j
ust beginning t
o get t
o-
gether, and Bess j
oined up with t
he m,
 
a
long with such other l
uminaries as
 
Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Butch
 
Hawes (whom she l
ater married), and
 
a host of o
thers. Woody t
aught her t
o
 
p
lay t
he mandolin, and on t
his i
nstru-
ment and t
he guitar, she soon develop-
ed a good solid "back-up" s
tyle which
 
was quite important i
n holding t
he
 
group t
ogether. She a
lso held t
he group
 
t
ogether i
n another way, her i
nfinite
 
patience, wisdo m, and t
act l
eading her
 
i
nto t
he role o
f peace maker -
-
 an
 
active and valued role f
or t
his volatile
 
band o
f h
ighly i
ndividualistic musi-
c
ians.
 
The Almanacs broke up, however,
 
soon a
fter t

I
i, and Bess t

he Near East. She l
ooks back
 
upon t
his experience as an important
 
part o
f her education, r
einforcing as
 
i
t d
id her convictions t
hat art and poli-
t
ics are not necessarily very f
ar a-
part, and t
hat she could neverbe con-
ont l
iving i
n an i
vory t
ower of mUst-
a
l exclusivity.
 
Her t
eaching career began when,
 
.
,'
ter t
he war, she and Butch moved
 
t
o Boston. A number o
f parents heard
 
h
er s
ing f
or a nursery school, and
 
t
hey wanted t
o l
earn how t
o s
ing and
 
accompany
 t
he mselves;  so  Bess
 
organized  an  i
nstrument c
lass. I
f
 
o
ther f
olk i
nstrument c
lasses existed
 
t
hen, Bess d
idn't know about t
hem, and
 
s
he had t
o make upherown rules. No-
e
ody t
old her, f
or i
nstance, t
hat i
t was
 
hard t
o t
each a c
lass o
f f
ifteen people
 
a
t once, with n
ine guitars, f
our banjos,
 
and two mandolins, so she went ahead
 
and d
id i
t -
-  with great success. S
ince
 
t
hen she's been t
old about t
he d
iffi-
u
lties, but hasn't experienced t
he m
 
h
erself, and many o
f her c
lasses are
 
o
ill s
tructured i
n t
his way. She says
 
-
 t
ey make better music!
 
I
n Boston, her b
lending o
f social
 
nsciousness with music prompted
 
r
 t
o write a
 number o
f songs i
n sup-
• r
t o

or mayor on t
he Progressive

f t
he songs, written
 
collaboration  with  Jacqueline
 
a
iner, t
urned out t
o be a winner. This
 
- t
t
h
he
e  "M.T.A. Song."
 
By t
he t
ime Bess and Butch and t
he
 
i
s (who were i
nevitably known as All
 
Pretty Little Hawses) came t
o l
ive
 
Los Angeles, Bess was an estab-
hed t
eacher, f
olklorist, and per-
f
ormer. Her admirable qualities i

t i

Bess days.
 
One o
f t
he best ways t
o gain an i
n-
s
ight i
nto t
he workings o
f Bess Hawes
 
i
s t
o watch her handle a l
arge guitar

s n
ever i

d

icture

he while with an a
lert eye out f
or
 
s
igns of unhappiness or confusion. The
 
whole setting i
s as i
nformal as can be,
 
yet t
here i
s ample evidence o
f a
 skill-
f
ul underlying organization. Besspre-
sents each new concept i
n t
erms of
 
her belief t
hat s
tudents shouldn't be
 
pushed t
oo hard; t
hey should be en-
couraged t
o reach continually f
or new
 
goals, but t
hey shouldn't t
oo o
ften be
 
f
aced with d
ifficulties t
hat see m, a
t
 
t
he  t
ime,  i
nsurmountable.  I
f she
 
senses t
he beginning of a t
oo-hard
 
s
truggle, she quietly l
eads t
he c
lass
 
i
nto something she knows i
t can do
 
well, and self-confidence I
s restored;
 
soon, t
hen, everyone will be ready f
or
 
a f
resh assault upon t
he proble m. Very
 
f
ew s
tudents have ever l
eft one o
f her
 
c
lasses with a f
eeling o
f f
rustration.
 
Bess says t
hat what she calls a
 
"flat-out" beginner can have f
unwith
 
h
is guitar r
ight f
rom t
he f
irst l
esson,
 
but t
hat a good, solid, AUTHORITA-
TIVE  t
humb-pluck  accompaniment
 
usually can't be accomplished i
n l
ess
 
t
han a year-and-a-half. All sorts of
 
f
ancy runs and specific f
inger-styles
 
can be me morized earlier, but t
he
 
authority and t
he f
irm control j
ust
 
aren't t
here. Bess i
s quick t
o point
 
-28-
out t
hat her philosophy i
s j
ust one
 
among many equally valid ones, and
 
she l
aughingly says t
hat o
f a
ll t
he
 
scores o
f guitar t
eachers who s
tarted
 
out as her s
tudents, not one o
f t
he m
 
t
eaches by her methods: "They've
 
a
ll gone e
ither more c
lassical or more
 
e
thnic, and t
hey probably don't ap-
prove o
f me. .
.and t
hey a
ll p
lay better
 
t
han I
 do!" What Bess wants t
o do i
s
 
t
o help people t
o develop t
heir own
 
personal s
tyles, and i
n t
his she i
s
 
f
abulously successful.
 
One o
f her i
deas i
s t
hat, I
norderto
 
keep i
nterest a
live, t
he s
tudents must
 
produce some decent music a
t every
 
s
tage o
f t
he game. Partly t
o t
his end,
 
she has everybody l
earn t
o s
ing t
he
 
songs, o
ften i
n t
hree- or f
our-part
 
harmony, before a
tte mpting t
o add ac-
companiments. She l
ikes t
o s
tart a
 
c
lass  session i
n this way, getting
 
everybody enthusiastic about a song,
 
t
hen getting down t
o work on t
he ac-
co mpaniment. Before c
losing, t
hey a
ll
 
do a
 repeat and practice o
f something
 
t
hey've  a
lready  l
earned,  so  t
hat
 
everybody goes ho me with good music
 
s
till r
inging i
n t
heir ears.
 
Thinking of herself mainly as a
 
scholar and t
eacher,  Bess i
s s
till
 
called upon t
o do a great deal o
f per-
f
orming. Her s
inging i
s quiet, a
lmost
 
self-effacing,  with  t
he  song i
tself
 
being f
ar more important than t
he
 
expression o
f her own personality.
 
Her admiration o
f some o
f t
he songs
 
i
s obvious; even i
n f
ront o
f
 t
he l
argest
 
audience, she can become rapt i
n t
he
 
conte mplation of a beautiful melody
 
or a l
ine o
f poetry, and i
s not a
t a
ll
 
concerned with t
he f
act t
hat she i
s
 
t
he person who i
s doing t
he s
inging.
 
This admiration i
s contagious, and
 
countless people have f
irst appre-
c
iated f
olk music upon hearing Bess
 
s
ing. I
t i
s only when she has l
eft t
he
 
s
tage t
hat one realizes how s
ensitive
 
and skillful a perfor mance she has
 
g
iven.
 
As a concert artist, panelist, l
ec-
turer, and t
eacher, Bess has t
o dash
 
about  t
o an endless succession of
 
ca mpuses, schools, workshops, i
n-
s
titutes, coffeehouses, banquet halls,
 
and t
heatres. She has been f
eatured
 
i
n most o
f t
he great f
olk f
estivals,
 
i
ncluding t
hose a
t Berkeley, UCLA,
 
San Diego, Long Beach, and Newport;
 
and, f
or a number of sum mers, she
 
has been on t
he f
aculty o
f t
he f
olk
 
music  workshops  a
t  t
he  I
dyllwtId
 
School  o
f  Music  and  t
he Arts, a
 
mountain branch o
f t
he University o
f
 
Southern California. Pete Seeger has
 
written o
f her t
hat "...she can s
ing
 
more songs, and prettier, t
han any
 
person I
 know."
 
At San Fernando Valley S
tate Col-
l
ege, Bess t
eaches several courses,
 
i
ncluding a general i
ntroduction t
o
 
f
olklore, a survey o
f American f
olk
 
music, and courses of special s
tudies
 
f
or advanced s
tudents. These c
lasses
 
are conducted very much l
ike her
 
"how-to" c
lasses, with t
he f
riendly
 
i
nformality o
f t
he a
tmosphere h
iding
 
t
he very careful organization. There
 
i
s a
 l
ot o
f back-and-forth d
iscussion,
 
and Bess has t
hat rare t
eacher's g
ift
 
o
f making every question p
lay an im-
portant part i
n t
he d
iscussion, and
 
o
f guiding t
he d
iscussion so i
t goes
 
where she wants i
t t
o go. Her courses
 
are not "Mickey Mouse" courses i
n
 
any sense; a great deal i
s de manded
 
o
f t
he s
tudents, but t
hey are not l
ed
 
t
o f

s j
ust work-for-

hey l

 great
 
deal about f
olklore. One o
f Bess's re-
quire ments i
s t
hat each s
tudent must
 
collect a song f
rom h
is own neighbor-
hood.
 
Bess a
lways has several b
ig pro-
j
ects on t

ire. As o

f
or example, she i

ot
 
o
f Bessie Jones's songs f

or her brother Alan, and she

he belated birth of my son,  I have been aerolled there the
 
revious five years.
 It was with some horror that I learned
 
arough a friend, that her -J

l
e was in question.
 If I  i
iougit
 
i
t would do any good I would write a long and eloquent letter, suFFice
 
it to say that I have felt genuinely affected by two teachers,Dr.
 
dellinger in the Biology department and Mrs. Hawes in Anthropology.
 
After working in a Biologicali.&for a year I returned as an Anthro.
 
major.  I feel
. Mrs. Hawes i
s much more than just a teacher.
 
Prsoiial  [
eei i
ngs aside,  I bel i
cve  i
t  i
s due to the met cuious
 
design of her courses,the logical sequence of lectures, and the
 
many and parallel work assignments that provide so much impetus
 
to her students.
 I know that I am not the only student who  i
ns
 
experienced a heightened motivation to do good work for this
 
woman, not just the fulfilling of assignments but the desire to
 
do something meaningful to me.
 With many teachers I make an
 
attempt to do the k
ind of work I
'm sure the teacher will like,
 
i
n 11
1
or c
lasses  f d
id work  f thoubht was  i
mportant.
 
ne of Mrs. Hawes' most unique teaching habits isthe manner in
 
hich assignments are returned.
 Never have I received a paper
 
hack from her with just a grade.
 She writes comments on every
 
pertinent or impertinent point made.
 If it is a good paper she
 
tells you why,if not she explains that too.
 Even if she never
 
has the opportunity to speak to a student individually, the
 
student feels that there i
s a steady comaun 1
 en t
 i
on between t
ic
 
teacHer and h
iiiscl1.
 
In Mrs. Hawes'  classes one feels that here is a woman who i
s an
 
authority,
 whose depth of knowledge and insight into many facets
 
of lore and music are still untapped.
 Some students enter her
 
classes awed by her reputation outside the college.
 All of
 
them find she is more than willing to share her knowledge and
 
talents, always approachable and available and always interested
 
i
n an attempt, no matter howl elementary or amateurish.

It has just come to my attention that the contract of one of my
 
favorite professors, Mrs. Bess Lomax Hawes, might not be renewed
 
for the academic year 1966-1967. Permit me to offer a plea in
 
her behalf, and in behalf of San Fernando Valley State College
 
which would, in the long run, be the loser were she to leave.
 
It has been said that the study of folklore and folk music might
 
not belong in the Department of Anthropology. I feel that, until
 
this college is large enough to have a separate department for
 
the study of folklore, this is exactly where it does belong. As
 
a student of Cultural Anthropology I find this approach,  as
 
taught by Mrs. Hawes, invaluable as a key to the way neople think
 
and feel about themselves and their culture. When upon my gradua-
tion in 1964 I inquired about the possibility of advanced work
 
in Folklore at UCLA,  I was informed that the degree involved at
 
the time was a Master of Anthropology with a specialty  in Folk-
lore. The fields are indeed compatible.
 
Goethe said, "A teacher who can arouse a feeling for one single
 
good action, for one single good poem,  accomplishes more than he
 
who fills our memory with rows on rows of natural objects,  class-
ified with name and form." Mrs. Hawes has inspired me in jus
 
this way not once, but countless times in the two years I have
 
known her. She opened new vistas for me in the field of Anthro-
pology and in understanding people. She introduced me to media
 
which are at once enjoyable in themselves and invaluable as tools
 
for research. She taught me a method of folklore research that I
 
never dreamed existed,  and inspired me to inquire and search for
 
yself to the extent that I plan to work for a Master of Arts
 
degree in her field, Folklore,  as soon as I complete my credential.
 
If her influence on other students has been even half as profound
 
as on me, Mrw. Hawes has more than fulfilled the requirements for
 
a good teacher. Such individuals are indeed rare.  For the sake of
 
future students who might benefit from contact with this fine
 
lady,  I implore you to allow her to continue to serve San Fernando

Vice-President  viatt told me last srin
 that he had raceivcd
 
a number of letters relative to such matters as my teaching abili-
ty, my experience as a folklorist and so on.
 I had assumed that
 
copies of these letters would appear in my personnel folder, but
 
I
. understand that they are being retained (
I assume in Dr. Ovintt':
 
office) in view of the fact that they were not addres e' t
o
 
and that the writers might prefer that I not see them.
 
However, it occurs to me that these letters might contain statc-
m
ents appropriate to the deliberations of either the school or
 
t
he college personnel committee.  Would it be in order for you t
o
 
e
nquire as to the possibility of these letters being included in
 
c
y file when it leaves this office, so that they may be examined
 
by such committees as may b  involved in consideration of t

raif
lst which a teachers o-
f
'f

It would seem only logical to evaluate teaching e-
°fectiveness in terms of the goal  of the educational procens.
 
The degree to which a teacher accomplished this goal would
. he
 
a measure of his or her teaching ability.  But there is con-
siderable disac reement as to what the goal of education is.
 
Is the goal to teach the student to think critically or to
 
successfully fill him with the "necessary facts" or to moti-
vate him to pursue a subject further or is it to contribute
 
new knowledge and/or orginization to a field of study? Per-
haps all of these taken together constitute the goal of edu
 
cation? It is my personal belif that this lattec ie the case.
 
In the case of Professor Bess Hawes, -
 fin7 a tori-
cher who is considered to be very knowlegeable about her fi ld
 
nd related subjects. That she is knowlegeable is not only en
 
'
f
lersonal belif but also that of some of the r

of nor students to pursue the science of folklore and/or folk-

usic further.  There is ample evidence for this. Many students
 
take not just one class from her,  they take two and if pos-
oible three. Also one needs only to look at the quality of
 
L

like the "My gosh its 11 P.N. and I

In reading the papers sub l:;ted to her and in oeadia

awes not only attem'ets to teach, but oft n s- co '

While she has not published extensively under

the science of folklore(and foli

work for the Folkmusic Archives of the Library of Congress

Deer Dr. Pretor,
 
I have recently heard from several valid sources that Fred K
atz
 
and Bess HSWOB may possibly be asked to leave our campus in the near
 
future.
 If this is true, it may be one of the biggest mistakes Valley
 
State has yet to make.  The quality of these individuals as educators
 
cannot possibly be questioned.
 
I attended Valley S
tate College for four years and g
raduated
 
in June, 1964, with a BA in Psychology.
 During this time I had the
 
opportunity to take a class by Bess Hawes and three by Fred Katz.
 Even
 
though the classes demanded a great deal from the student in terms of
 
time and effort, they were very rewarding experiences.
 I am currently
 
a graduate s
tudent at Los Angeles State College and will graduate in June.
 
I only wish that the professors I have had in my particular area were 58
 
stimulating, as interesting, and interested in their s
tuaents as Bess H
ewes
 
and Fred Katz certainly have been.
 
I hope I
'm not suffering from too i
dealistic an orientation to
 
the field of education, as I have always thought, or hoped, that college,
 
besides being a learning situation, would at the same time s
timulate
 
the student toward desiring more knowledge and create for him an
 
environment where he could express himself creatively.  Bess Hewes and
 
Fred Katz demand the s
tudent to think for himself, and allow him the
 
freedom in which to accomplish this.  Regurgitation of academic information
 
is of course necessary to a certain extent.
 But more important for the
 
student is that he be able to use this information -
 to at least attempt
 
to think independently.
 
I cannot believe that Valley State would want to lose two such
 
fine people who have done so much toward furthering the academic interest
 
of the many students they have had in their classes.
 
I sincerely hope that whet I have heard is incorrect as I
 
believe Valley State has a great potential for becoming one of the finest
 
schools in California.  But a school is only as good as i
ts faculty.
 
Sincerely,
 
f

The eight consecutive semesters that I have been a part-
time graduate student of the college have been a most
 
interesting experience for me.
 During this period I have
 
audited 12 hours,  and will have credit for about 27
 
hours at the end of this semester.
 Except for 6 hours
 
in psychology and  3 hours  in sociology,  it has all been
 
in anthropology.
 
There are two matters I want to call to your attention.
 
I have at one time or another discussed many independent
 
study projects with a number of professors in several
 
departments.
 Last year,  for example,  I took 3 hours of
 
599 with Dr. Rainey in psychology,  and it was rewarding.
 
Later I learned that he gets no credit whatever for
 
doing this,  and I believe it is poor policy.
 If it's
 
worth doing at all,  it's worth doing on a regular,  paying
 
basis.
 Administratively,  it may be a problem,  but son
ic-
thing should be provided as a further incentive to the
 
professor.
 If encouraged,  the tutorial,  independent
 
study situation could be very effective.
 
The other item on my mind is the apparent transformation
 
in the Anthropology Department.
 One of the exciting
 
aspects of the college when I first registered in February,
 
1962 was the boldness and liberality of the curriculum
 
and teachers in anthropology.
 It was for that reason I
 
tcgan taking its courses,  and hoped eventually to obtain
 
M. A. degree there.
 For some time it has been rumored
 
at the college might drop the courses in folklore and

etc.,  but I have had folklore with Bess Hawes.
 Both are
 
fine people and a credit to any campus interested in
 
providing a human climate.
 But whoever the teacher may
 
be,  I feel strongly that folklore belongs in the cur-
riculum,  and preferably in anthropology.
 In addition,
 
Bess Hawes is particularly well qualified both by reason
 
of her learning and experience,  and for being a very
 
fine person.
 
In recent years,  Anthropology has emerged from the stage
 
of microscopic data compilation,  and now asks the larger
 
questions concerning cultural man.
 In this new context
 
it is a serious mistake to consider the elimination of
 
the study of folklore,  which is an important area of
 
human life.
 
Your consideration will be appreciated.
 
Yours very truly,

There are rumors that hr •  h

ogy student I wish to say that such a move would be a seriou
 
blow to the anthropology program and to Valley State
 tJeits.
 
nthropologists are quite agreed on  ow central the folklore
 
contribution is to anthropological knowledge.  It would be
 
unnecessary to discuss Mrs. Hawes' place of emininence amon st
 
folklorists.  Eliminating Mrs. Hawes and folklore from the
 
anthropology program can in absolutely re  ay  o cor
 
a constructive change in the College.
 
a student of Mrs. Hawes I have b
eer
. eti
'o
ly lortaa t
 
ing exposed to a leading figure in her field, a rare
 
ccurance at this school.  As a professor Mrs. Hawes
 '
or
 
stimulating and very demanding.  She presents lively and
 
always relevant lectures and allows considerable class dis-
cussion.  In short, a great deal of valuable learning goes
 
in her classes.  I don't need to r,_ :
i
d :co that thea
 
ways enrolled to the maximum limit.
 
yone who has talked to Mrs. Hawes can attest to her treiner-
ualities as a sensitive human being.
 
• ring the possibility that the rumor about her dismissal
 
i
ia be true I can only believe that certain mindless forces
 
deciding Valley State's future as a second rate college.
 
students are the tragic victims, as they will he if
 
;.  Hawes doesn't continue to be the magnificent contri-
ution to the faculty and the anthropology program that she
 
now is.

Dear Dr. Prator:
 
I feel strongly that good teachers should be acclaimed,
 
and I am writing to you at this time, to express my
 
appreciaticn for the excellent teaching of Mrs. Bess Hawe
 
of the Anthropology Department of San Fernando Valley
 
State College.
 I have had two courses with Mrs. Hawes;
 
Anthropology 326 -
 Folklore; and Anthropology 4
76 -
 Folkl ore
 
Field Study.
 I feel that in these two courses,  I received
 
the kind of directed learning that reflects excellence in
 
teaching.
 
I became interested if
l the  culture and 1an uage of the
 
Fasque people, sometime ago,  in a rather vague way.
 In the
 
Folklore classes, Mrs. Hawes fostered this interest, guided
 
and encouraged me in real work in this area of study.
 And
 
he has continued to do so outside of class.  From her,
 
I feel that I have learned the great difference between
 
"interest" in a subject and
. "discipline" in study and rese r h,
 
although I have a long way to go.
 I am very grateful to her
 
for this kind of learning, and I want to express my sincere
 
appreciation to you as her Administrative superior, for the
 
TC'  he -i tea
-:
