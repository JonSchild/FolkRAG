€ tLy€  0avis,
 
,t
ank you so much for inviting me to the Fourth Orff- chulwerk
 
-mposium.
 At the moment, I don't quite see how I can make it
 
r
ice I
'm on leave this year and taking full-time graduate work
 
U.C. Berkeley.
 I
've just looked up April 29th in my UC Calendar
 
A
d I
'm afraid I would have to fly down for the evening only,
 
which case I doubt my participation would be worth the expense
 
volved.
 I
'm really sorryl I should have loved to come.
 
You may remember that I mentioned to you a year or so ago that I
 
was intending to make a movie of traditional black childrens' games'
 
I actually did - -
 through a sea of vicissitudes and problems that I
 
won't take up your time to mention - -
 but it did get done, and it i
s
 
available (though I don't like it myself very much anymore!)
 I don't
 
think it would be useful for the Symposium, but it occurred to me
 
that you might like to see it, so I
'm taking the liberty of enclosin
 
the publicity brochure and the so-called "
study guide" which comes
 
with the film.  You could take a look at it, if it sounds interesting
 
to you, either by writing the Extension Media people (
see brochure)
 
or by borrowing a copy from the Anthropology Department at San Fernando
 
Valley States  I should think the secretary there, Mrs. Phyllis DeSarrio,
 
could make the arrangements, though the Extension Media people can
 
also arrange a preview copy to be sent.
 
Anyway, much good luck with rhc? Conference.
 I wish I could he there.

Dear Mrs. Haves:
 
It is with pleasure that we announce the Fourth International Symposium on
 
Orff-Schulwerk in the United States on April 29, 30, and May 1, 1970.  Once
 
again it will convene on the beautiful campus of the University of Southern
 
California.  The theme of the symposium will be "Action in Priority Changes
 
in Education".
 
On the evening of Wednesday, April 29,  there will be a Multi Media Presentation
 
entitled "What is Orff-Schulwerk?" in which we invite you to take an active
 
part.  It is our belief that your contribution would help make the symposium
 
a significant experience for those who desire to broaden their understanding
 
of Orff-Schulwerk.
 
We have submitted a request for $25.00
 to assist you in covering the expenses
 
of your participation.
 
Please let us know at your earliest convenience if you can accept our invi-
tation.  We need to arrange for your communication with those with whom you
 
would be working.  Brochures for the Symposium will go to press in January
 
so that your immediate answer would greatly speed preparations.
 
Your participation will be highly valued.  We await your reply ea gerly.
 
Sincerely,

accompanied by rhythmic chanting; clapping and ball bouncing games are
 
also.
 Even the game of jacks develops a rhythmic quality in the hands
 
of many children. Since these games are not only not taught but actively
 
discouraged in many schools, they form a level of child-to-child oral
 
t
:
radition from which valuable clues to their own  preference patterns
 
in rhyme and rhythm might be gained.
 There are not many recorded 
a
rnples of these games; Tony Schwartz' ONE TWO THREE AND A ZINC ZINC
 
dING; MILLIONS OF MUSICIANS and NEW YORK NINETEEN (Folkways Records
 
have some examples.
 There are, however, a large number of publishe
 
collections.  ROCKET IN MY POCKET is one (
I forget the author); PaLri cia
 
dvans' a mBLES is another.
 The Baring-Goulds' ANNOTATED MOTHER GOOS E.
 
is worth examination also'
c n

-
Singing games proper have dirdin shed in popularity among majority
 
children; the tradition is still quite active, however, among Negro
 
and Mexican-American children.
 Harold Courlander's NEGRO GAMES FRON
 
ALABAMA (Folkways) and some of the Library of Congress field recordings
 
have examples of the former.
 The American play party tradition might
 
yet be saved for children if it coijld.be taught them with some vigor
 
and masculinity.
 Benjamin Botkin's
IIERICAN PLAY PA TY has all the best
 
games, and there is a useful Folkways recording by Pete and Mika Seeger
 
and Larry Eisenberg called AMERICAN PLAY PARTIES which is notaöle for
 
some forthright mid-American style singing.  Historically, the institu-
tion of the play party was a frontier attempt to circumvent religious
 
prohibitions against dancing; adults then met for evenings of playing
 
childrens'  singing games.
 These were the real dances of our frontier
 
heroes and cowboys, and,  to appeal to American children,  they should
 
be taught in that context.

 Instruments.
 Here I have two questions.
 Is it really important
 
to work through the i
 t onx f historical development of Euro-
pean instruments?
 (The answer to this obviously depends on the eventual
 
goal.)  Secondly, is the Orff instrumentarium too complex and expensive
 
for American public schools?
 
From the perspective of American folk music, our important instruments
 
historically have been from the string family, especially plucked strings.
 
For what use it might be,  the "folk" instruments might be listed as:
 
Appalach
n (plucked) dulcimer, psaltery, banjo (
four and five..string,
 
most especially the latter), guitar, mandolin, autoharp, fiddle (violin
 
with a flattened bridge, frequently tuned to chords on the onen strings);
 
among American Negroes: drums of any kind including pots, kettles,
 
coke bottles, the floor (very important), hand-clapping and body-slapping,
 
home-made horizontally-blown fifes, wash boards (for a snare-drum effect),
 
wash-tub bass (always plucked),  tamborines, harmonicas and the whole
 
battery of brass instruments for jazz playing.
 
For one practical suggestion, most American schools have auto-harps
 
and tone-bells; could not some more interesting methods be demonstrated
 
for using them?  The auto-harp is played in a very interesting manner
 
by southern white "hill-billy" musicians who hold it upright and have
 
developed a method of pulling melody out of the chord positions  this
 
seems to me highly instructive as well as much more fun than the old
 
scrub-board position used in the schools.
 For some of the possible
 
:isical results of this method,  see a Folkways recording titled, I
 
b
.olieve AUTOHARP, edited by Mike Seeger and recently released.
 The
 
t
hnomusicology people at UCLA under Dr. Mantle Hood experimented with
 
re-tuning tone bells to the Javanese (
?) scale a year or so ago, and
 
used them in teaching Javanese music to elementary and secondary children
 
in Santa Monica.
 Perhaps there is some published report on this project
 
that might be useful.
 
3
.
 Rhythm.  My general impression is that 3/4 and especially 6/8 '
meters
 
are relatively unfamiliar to American children.
 Occasionally triplets
 
are used to break up a straight four beat phrase but even these are
 
apt to be jazzed; the gapped triplet is far more f
fr
re
eq
qu
ue
en
nt
t -
t
 
-ta  than the
 
full triplet as is made clear in most of our popular music.
 In teaching
 
American adults, I find that a plain 6/8 is the most difficult rb
.z
- t
hm.
 
It is very important to recognize that most majority "white" children
 
use extremely square rhythmic patterns.  They admire and like synco-
pation but have enormous difficulty with it, almost always evening out
 
and flattening the rhythm.  I
1y own feeling is that they need a great
 
deal of physical rather than strictly musical loosening before they can
 
successfully handle syncopation.  However,  the operative factor here is
 
that they admire it.
-" At early ages,  then,  they will learn European
 
"
square" musical and dance patterns which they almost always reject
 
later during adolescence when so many turn to Negro models in this field.
 
Most of them,  then, will end up not dancing or singing at all, because
 
they feel they cannot successfully emulate the admired style.
 
Negro children, on the other hand, developE a high degree of rhythmic
 
sophistication at a very early age; this shows up both in dance and
 
musical activities.
 (In a mixed group, the "white" children will clap
 
on the down-beat,  the Negro children on the off-beat; both moves are
 
"natural" to the two cultures.)
 "Hand jive" (body slapping) is almost
 
a culture train among Negro male adolesèents; it is highly syncopated
 
and complex.
 They move directly from this to drumming on tables, b6-
,,
-es
 
and bottles; from this to bongo drums.
 
4
.  Harmony.
 Southern "white" harmony tends to open intervals,  open
 
fourths and fifths being very popular.  Two and three voices are more
 
frequent than four, for this reason.
 The American traditinn of sh ape 
note singing (see the Sacred Harp hymn book) gives a guide to this
 
sort of harmony, besides containing some beautiful music; it is to me
 
a real shame that this music is not used in secondary choral work.
 
Negro vocal harmonic style is closer,  thirds and sixths being added
 
for a fuller less independent blend.
 
Instrumental harmony is spare; chord changes are infrequent
 
and chord forms being kept on the whole simple.
 (The triad is more
 
frequent than the seventh, for example.)  The full rolling instrumental
 
chord is rarely used; in the southern "white" tradition,  the instruemtns
 
?lay rapid almost pointilist counter-melody or fi rm  rather dry chords
 
with a heavy bass line.
 In Negro instrumentation the instrument is
 
treated as a responsive voice with its own melodic function. The current
 
'
pop" style of folk-singin  with frequent chord changes and elaborate
 
chord forms is a product of 
 the last twenty years and stems more from
 
who show music than from the country tradition.
 
5
.  Scales and melodic patterns.  Without looking it up,  I would judge
 
that Ionian, Mixolydian and Dorian modes ar e th e mos
t w id e-sprea
d in 
American folk music of European origin.
 Aeolian is rare, almost corn-
plctcly limited to melodies of central European origin.
 Of course, there
 
are thousa±ds of pentatonic tunes and gapped scales are frequent.
 
Among American Negroes the "blues" scales wi th neutral thirds and sevenths
 
are widely heard. Generally speaking, I have found that the minor modes
 
are unfamiliar and difficult for American children.
 
Among Negroes, melodies organized along responsive patterns are
 
omnipresent.  The "white" cultural tradition has developed longer solo
 
uelodies, broken sometimes by refrains or longer choruses, but always
 
r
nephasizing the solo vocal line.
 In my experience, majority Americans
 
therefore have had little experience in singing together (or even play-
ing together).
 Group rapport is weak and there is little attention to
 
or concern for blend; generally one musician does not hear the other
 
players or singers at all.
 
3
.  A final general comment.  The United States public schools have
 
2ncouraged an extraordinarily eye-oriented culture; seeing is believing,
 
after all.  Along with the emphasis on eye-learning there is a positive
 
attempt made to eliminate ear-learning; the child is encouraged to
 
shut out distracting sounds when he is reading and so on.  Many adults
 
I teach literally do not hear any sounds whEn during the time that they
 
are using their eyes (as in reading music); they not only do not hear
 
other musicians playing at the same time,  they don't even hear them-
selves.
 Further complicating the matter is the tendency to use music
 
as a sound baffle; "background" music is used in stores, restaurants,
 
in homes during study hours etc.  to screen out "more distracting"
 
sounds.  For this reason, I find that a strong positive attempt must
 
be made to teach listening and even hearing, and that this is made much
 
more difficult when visual aids are used.
 In teaching adults, I use
 
as little written material as possible for this reason and occasionally
 
even turn off the lights for a whole lesson.  Personally I feel that
 
musical literacy can and should be let go for the sake of the much
 
more fundamental learning experience of really hearing music.
 
I have put these ideas down just as they occurred to me; due to my un-
familiarity with the Orff method, they may be quite valueless but I
 
would be delighted to continue in this sloppy way or expand on any of
 
the points that might be of value or provide more specific examples
 
in recorded or printed form of any of the materials mentioned.

As I mentioned to you the other day, I have been invited t
o participate in a
 
conference sponsored by the State Committee on Public Education, meeting  n
 
Berkeley from J
anuary 2th thro gh February 1
st.  A
. copy of r
i y  invitation
 
is attached.
 
Attendance at t
his c
onference would necessitate r
Lv  missing one s
cheduled
 
examination p
eriod on Thursday, January 26th; the class affected is one of
 
the two s
ections of Anthropology 3
26 (Folklore).  Since I have always given
 
a t
ake-home examination in this course, our meeting at the examination period
 
s
imply s
erves as an opportunity to go over the exam and to return any final
 
papers.
 
Therefore it does not appear to me absolutely essential that I meet this
 
exam s
ection; many students will be able to meet with the other Folklore
 
s
ection at their examination period Monday morning.  For students with a
 
c
onflict, I propose to announce that I will be available in my office
 
from 8
:00 until  :
00 Monday and Tuesday, January 23rd and 24th to hand
 
back papers and d
iscuss any final problems in private c
onference •
 This
 
would, it s
eems to me, f0 f
ill the normal function of py examination periods
 
perhaps even more effectively than the group meeting.
 
I hope this arrangement will meet with your approval.

Dear Professor Hawes:
 
The State Committee on Public Education hopes that you
 
will join in a conference to be held at the Claremont Hotel,
 
Berkeley, California, Wednesday, January 25 through Wednesday,
 
February 1
, 1967.  A tentative list of participants is attached.
 
The meeting is to (
1) develop a digest of key state-
ments of the goals and needs of California public school educa-
tion and (
2) place them in a provisional order of priority.
 
Statements will be derived from position papers prepared for
 
the State Committee, plus reactions from educators and para-
educational organizations and scholars from many disciplines.
 
Conference procedure will be described in greater detail
 
prior to your arrival.  We are authorized to provide an
 
honorarium of $100 a day and expenses.  A room will be reserved
 
for you at the Claremont.
 
The State Committee on Public Education was organized by
 
the State Board of Education and Max Rafferty, superintendent
 
of public instruction, under a grant from Elementary and Secondary
 
Title V funds of the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965.
 
Its mission is to advise the Board of Education on the
 
conditions and needs of the educational enterprise and to seek
 
Professor Hawes
 -2-
 December 16, 1966
 
approaches to the design of some system of continuous educa-
tional inquiry for the state.
 It is attempting to ascertain
 
what will be the educational problems and opportunities of the
 
decades just ahead and to recommend to the board an order of
 
priority for dealing with them.
 
We sincerely hope that you will find it possible to
 
participate.  We regard participation in the first day of the
 
conference advisable, but if your schedule is difficult, we
 
would welcome as much time as you are able to give.
 
Sincerely,

meeting.  Mr. Clark has written extensively about him but for years, he has success-
fully written about '
lost mines'.  Comment: a perfect tie-up for folklore.

As you can s
ee, there have been s
ome changes made.  We would now l
ike you
 
to s
erve as M.C. (
or hostess, if you prefer) on the Friday night concert.
 
As you can see, you are listed for both Friday and Sat. workshops.  S
ome
 
of these are instrumental techniques.  At any rate, you will get a chance
 
to discuss  them with the person in charge beforehand.  You will not be
 
s
cheduled for anything until Friday afternoon.
 
I am also enclosing a check for your tickets, excursion rate, roundtrip
 
from Los Angeles to Providence •
 Let us know the time you are due to arrive,
 
your flight number, and the airline.  That way we c
an arrange to have you
 
picked up, no matter what d
elays might ensue.
 
We are a
ll d
elighted that you are g
oing to b
e here.
 
Sincerely yours,
 
Helen von Schmidt
 
Added note: The films s
ound delightful, but i
z
riforbunately we have n
o
 
provision for showing films this year.  We are having Ed Young in the
 
f
lesh, and the others perhaps c
an be shown another year.

The Board
, of Directors of the newport Folk Foundation would like very
 
much to have you participate in the 1968 Newport Folk Festival,
 Th e
 
Festival will run from Tuesday, July 23 to Sunday, July 26.
 
The Board would like you to participate in a small concert on  ednesdav
 
evening, July 24th and in informal workshops on Friday and Saturday.
 
The workshops are now much smaller audience—wise, as we have as many as
 
ten going at once with no amplification.  We tried this last year for
 
the first time and it worked very successful] ,.
, 1oth  for ncrformers  and
 
audience.
 
Again the fee is $50.00 performing day, a total of
 
travel expenses, and room and board in Newport.

I
've been assigned the job of collecting material for
 
the Festival program book.  I was ill most of the past month,
 
so I am dreadfully behind schedule atthe moment.  The first
 
thing I need from you is a picture of yourself and a brief
 
autobiography.  Second, I wonder if I could impose on
 
you to write a brief (one paragraph) bio of the Almanac
 
Singers.
 Third, I can't locate a picture of the
 
Almanac singers, and I wonder if you have one we could
 
use (and return) for the book.
 
I must apologize for the short notice.
 I
'd be deeply
 
grateful if you could send off the first, and , if possible,
 
the other two, as soon as possible.
 
We are all looking forward, with real excitement, toseeing you
 
at Newport.
 
Sincerely yours,
 
Helen von Schmidt

Dear Pauli
 
As I mentioned to you when we last met, the Doparment hero
 
asked me in December to bring my Vita up to date. so I am
 
simply enclosing a copy of the results for my current personnel
 
file.
 I think it makes a useful summary, thpugh these is
 
additional information in the sort of running diaries that I
 
have turned each year previously.
 
I am also including a brief summary of my 1868 l969 activities
 
plus a bit about what I
've been up to this year, as well as
 
such supporting documents as I have available.
 Please bung
 
them into my fiêèlif they seem appropriate.
 It all seems a
 
bit skimpy to me, but I
've forgotten what I did in 1968 except
 
for running mighty fast...
 
I hope all the enclosures are in reasonably proper order and
 
form.
 I am currently taking fifteen graduate units, so that
 
I will have a bit more time for my thesis in the spring quarter,
 
and I s
in not terribly coherent on any given topic as a result.
 
Do you know what a proverb is -
-
 as a linguistic form?
 
neither do I
.
 If I find out, I will let you know; then there
 
will be two of us.
 
All the best,
 
Bees Lomax Hawes
 
P
.S.
 I have signed this formally so that it will serve, hopefully,
 
as an official authorization for you to put the enclosed papers
 
into my file.
 Put this letter in too if it's necessary; I don't

We're taking a
 moment now that the festival is
 
over to say thank you for caring to Newport.  in the
 
rush and cop
-fusion of the festival, we don't get
 
much of a chance to thank each of you personally.
 
This year's Festival was very successful due,
 
in a large part .,
 to your musical contribution.  As
 
we who work on p1nnning and production are often
 
too close to it to fully appreci,tte the performer's
 
view.,
 we would be grateful for your suggestions
 
and criticisms which might serve as guidelines for
 
future festivals.
 
We hope your stay at Newport was an enjoyable
 
one and loolc fcnr
,
.rd to hearing from you soon.
 
Once again, thanks for he lp 4ng  US to make this
 
,'
estival a huge success.

In case you have mislaid the other one we sent we are enclosing another

Dear Bess:
 
On behalf of the summer session students and myself, I want
 
to thank you for your contribution to our Workshop on Con-
temporary Music in the Classroom.  The students were very
 
anxious to hear you and to have a chance to use the material
 
from your work with the Georgia Sea Islanders.
 I think your
 
comments about the world of children's folk music are
 
extremely valid.
 I wish we as music educators would recog-
nize this great resource and use it.
 
Best wishes on the publication of your book.
 
Sincerely,
 
Ralph Heidsiek
 
Professor of Music

Tha�-i
k you for helping make this year's Festival a delight!  You were,
 
as always,, charming and full of the life spirit that is your trademark.
 
I heard your singing at Saturday's Round Robin and I later heard the
 
frequent comments tl:
at your presence there made the concert hall seem
 
like a living-room.
 
I hope Earl Collin's recording is proceeding without difficulty. I havenIt
 
heard any more and I guess no news is good news. Be sure to let me
 
know if I can help on that in any way.
 
I am enclosing the newspaper stories and reviews of the Festival published
 
to date.(Others will be sent later.)  I've also sent some posters of the
 
Festival not already distributed, and if you need additional of any of
 
these just let H -
John's photographs are the best we've ever had of a Festival ., and we'll
 
send some down when they're printed.  I am continuing to enjoy working
 
with him and seeing Naomi a bit, too-- they have really got a nice life
 
going, which makes us feel good whenever we are around them.
 
Again, my thanks for coming to Berkeley and helping us get the Festival
 
together with good music and exceedingly good vibrations.

1,
 
Dear '
Jr. Kirk,
 
I am  writing this letter to express my opinion of a most impress-
ive member of your teaching staff: Bess Hawes. Having been a student
 
• e years (
 2 years at UCLA and 1 year at CS
) I find
 
unter a professor with such well rounded qualities:
 
Mrs. Hawes is warm and helpful to her students whenever she is called
 
upon for advice and she is highly knowledgeable in her field of study.
 
It was, for me, a privilege and pleasure to become acquainted with
 
Mrs. Hawes
 not only as a student, but as a friend (which is hard
 
to honestly say about most college professors I have had).
 
I thought perhaps, Dr. Kirk, that as Dean of Anthropology, you
 
might be interested in one student's opinion of a member of your faculty;
 
although I am sure that if you know Mrs. Hawes yourself, what I have
 
told you has not been too surprising to you. To ;me, she is rernntkable - 
not only as an individual, but also as an instructor!
 
Sincerely,
 
ILA- C

Dear Distinguished Colleague:
 
Based upon the premise that you might already have spent
 
the monetary award that accompanied an honor conferred
 
upon you by your fellow faculty members some time ago,
 
I am forwarding to you a more tangible -
-
 and nonnegotiable
 
certificate saluting the occasion.
 
Belated though this physical evidence is, may I congratulate
 
you anew for possessing those intangible but identifiable
 
traits that characterize all great teachers -
-
 a sensitivity
 
to the needs of students,  a warmth and compassion in person-
ality,  a concern for the continued growth of the academy.
 
Though this arrives some several months after you were
 
honored at this university's commencement exercises,  it
 
comes with a hearty repetition of the words:  "Congratulations."
 
Upon the occasion of your next visit to the Faculty Center
 
you will find on display the names of those individuals
 
honored since the practice was  inaugurated.
 It is good and
 
proper that your name is  there.

Dear B
etty I
nman:
 
Thank you so much for your l
etter about the 20 year observance of the
 
Barbara Greenwood Lectureship Fund.  You certainly have my permission
 
to quote from my remarks on the occasion of the 1
971 lecture; so much
 
water has gone over the dam s
ince that I no l
onger remember anything
 
I said worth preserving for posterity, and I shall be most interested
 
in f
inding out just what you think was!
 
Ad f
or a
ttending the celebration i
tself, I shall be delighted providing
 
I am in town.  I am on sabbatical this year and my whereabouts during
 
the s
pring are not yet t
otally f
irm.  Would i
t be possible for me t
o l
et
 
you know l
ater about this, or perhaps that i
sn't even necessary.  I
 
shall certainly turn up if at a
ll possible; I know I
'll have many o
ld
 
friends there.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Most people are contented i
f t
hey
 
can make a success o
f one career,
 
but  i
t t
akes  f
our t
o satisfy Bess
 
Hawes. She i
s a
 wife and t
he mother
 
o
f t
hree children; she i
s one o
f t
he
 
best-loved  guitar  t

n  t

s I
n great demand as a
 
performer; and she i
s an associate
 
professor i
n t
he Anthropology De-
part ment  a
t  San  Fernando  Valley
 
':
,

I
n addition t
o t

unofficial c
learing-house f
or a

of i

area  I
s l
ikely t
o end with "Well,
 
we'll j
ust call Bess; SHE'LL s
ettle
 
i
t" And s
ettle i
t  he usually does,
 
.
.:h  humor  and  impartiality. Her
 
phone  i
s  rarely  quiet,  but no
 
(
 er i
s ever made t
o f
eel t
hat he's
 
an unimportant part o
f a mob;
 
t
hat he's asked a
 f
oolish question;
 
bat h
e has I
nterrupted Bess i
n t
he
 
e o

seventy-nine exam papers.
 
I
t
's quite a j
ob j
ust t
o f
ind t
ime
 
t
o do so many t
hings, and because
 
she does t
his so well, one would ex-
pect Bess t
o be a
 h
igh-geared, super-
charged sort o
f person. Nothing could
 
be f
urther f
rom t
he t
ruth. She i
s quiet,
 
gentle, and sensitive, and her superb
 
sense o
f organization does not work
 
l
ess ef
fectively f
or being unobtrusive.
 
Everybody  f
eels  "ho mey" around
 
Bess.
 
I
t's not really surprising t
hat Bess
 
i
s i
nterested I
n f
olklore, and has a
 
t
re mendous knowledge o
f i
t
, f
or she
 
was born a Lomax. But even i
f her
 
f
a mily background had been d
ifferent,
 
i
t would see m i
nevitable t
hat Bess
 
should t
urn t
o f
olklore as a means of
 
t
ying t
ogether t
he various aspects of
 
her  d
iverse character. Her i
nnate
 
l
ove f
or people and her respect f
or
 
t
heir i
ndividualities, her desire t
o see
 
a
ll o
f human culture as a s
ingle con-
t
inuous spectrum, and her great musi-
cal t
alent -
-
 a
ll of t
hese have f
ound
 
expression i
n t
he s
tudy and perform-
ance o
f f
olk music.
 
As a l
ittle g
irl, she was exposed
 
-
26-
more t
o c
lassical t
han t
o f
olk music.
 
She s
tudied l
ong and hard a
t t
he p
iano,
 
gaining a good grounding i
n f
ormal
 
music t
heory which has helped her
 
ever s
ince. During t
his period, her
 
f
ather, John A. Lomax, made h
is l
iv-
ing as a banker, and a
lthough t
here
 
was quite a
 b
it o
f s
inging of a
ll k
inds
 
around t
he house, f
olk music as such
 
was not especially i
n evidence.
 
When Bess was about t
en, t
he De-
pression f
orced her f
ather's bank t
o
 
reduce i
ts s
taff, and Dr. Ldmax f
ound
 
h
i mself une mployed. So he returned
 
t
o h
is f
irst and k
ivatest i
nterest -
-
t
he collecting and s
tudying o
f f
olklore.
 
He and h
is son Alan, t
hen seventeen,
 
contracted with t
he Mac millan Co m-
pany f
or t

f a
 book -
-
American Ballads and Folk Songs
f
or which he had earlier collecf ed
 
most o
f t
he material; t
here were so me
 
gaps i
n t
he collection, t
hough, and t
his
 
was re medied by t
heir going i
nto t
he
 
f
ield, collecting new material i
n such
 
p
laces as Southern prison f
arms. But
 
Bess was not much i
nvolved i
n a
ll o
f
 
t
his. Her mother had d
ied shortly be-
f
ore, and Bess had been s
ent t
o a
 
boarding, school i
n Dallas.
 
Always a good s
tudent, Bess s
tudied
 
hard a
t t
he boarding school and l
ater
 
a
t a public school; a
t t
he age o
f f
if-
t
een, she became a s
tudent a
t t
he Uni-
versity o
f Texas. Here began her as-
sociation with t
he world o
f f
olk music.
 
Through her f
ather and Alan, she met
 
several t
raditional s
ingers, i
ncluding
 
Leadbelly and t
he Gant f
a mily, and was
 
i
nspired t
o begin s
tudying f
olk music
 
i
n a serious way. Her s
tudies a
t t
hat
 
t
ime were entirely f
rom t
he v
iewpoint
 
of  t
he  collector-scholar,  with no
 
t
hought o
f performing.
 
After a
 year a
t t
he University, she
 
j
oined her f
ather and brother i
n Wash-
i
ngton, D
.C., where t
hey were working
 
on a second book -- Our S
inging Coun-
Bess had t
he j
ob of t
ranscribing
 
t
he words f
rom hundreds o
f f
ield re-
cordings, made on scratchy o
ld a
lumi-
num d
iscs; she a
lso helped Ruth Craw-
f
ord Seeger i
n t
he t
ranscribing o
f t
he
 
t
unes.
 
I
t was shortly after t
his book got
 
safely o
ff t
o t
he printers that Bess
 
t
ook up t
he guitar. Her f
atherhad j
ust
 
married t
he Dean o
f Wo men a
t t
he
 
University o
f Texas, and he i
nvited
 
Bess t
o go a
long on a honeymoon
 
ocean voyage t
o Europe. Somewhat
 
d
iffident about being t
he t
hird party
 
i
n t
his s
ituation, Bess f
ound a
 way t
o
 
keep herself out o
f t
he way, but gain-
f
ully occupied; she spent $
15 f
or a
 
second-hand guitar and t
aught herself
 
t
o p
lay i
t during t
he voyage.
 
She had, o
f course, no t
eacher she
 
d
idn't even have an i
nstruction book
 
Luckily, t

had pencilled on t

rom t
here on,
 
was a

o her. On t
he way t
c
 
Europe, she f
igured out how t
o p

t
he chords o
f G, C
, and D-seventh; on
 
t
he way home, she "invented" t
he
 
chords f
or t
he key o
f A-minor. With
 
t
hese f
ew chords, she f
ound she was
 
able t
o do quite satisfactory accom-
paniments, and d
iscovered f
or her-
self t
hat most American f
olk songs
 
are best set o
ff by s
imple accompani-
ments o
f t
his sort. Even now, when she
 
can p
lay a
ll t
he chords, she'd rather
 
rely upon s
implicity and good t
aste
 
t
han upon f
lashy modulations and o
ther
 
spectacular t
echniques. Frank Hamil-
t
on once said t
o her, wistfully, "Gee,
 
I
 wish I
 could p
lay n
ice and p
lain t
he
 
way you doll'
 
After t
he t
rip t
o Europe, Bess en-
t
ered  Bryn  Mawr,  where nobody
 
see med much i
nterested i
n her music.
 
I
n New York City, however, t
here
 
were p
lenty o
f k
indred spirits, and
 
she spent as much t
ime t
here as her
 
s
tudies  would a
llow.  The Almanac
 
S
ingers were j
ust beginning t
o get t
o-
gether, and Bess j
oined up with t
he m,
 
a
long with such other l
uminaries as
 
Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Butch
 
Hawes (who m she l
ater married), and
 
a host o
f o
thers. Woody t
aught her t
o
 
p
lay t
he mandolin, and on t
his i
nstru-
ment and t
he guitar, she soon develop-
ed a good solid "back-up" s
tyle which
 
was quite important i
n holding t
he
 
group t
ogether. She a
lso held t
he group
 
t
ogether i
n another way, her i
nfinite
 
patience, wisdo m, and t
act l

rope and t
he Near East. She l
ooks back
 
upon t
his experience as an important
 
part o
f her education, reinforcing as
 
i
t d
id her convictions t
hat art and poli-
t
ics are not necessarily very f
ar a-
part, and t
hat she could never be con-
t
ent l
iving i
n an i
vory t
ower o
f musi-
cal exclusivity.
 
Her t
eaching career began when,
 
a
fter t
he war, she and Butch moved
 
t
o Boston. A number o
f parents heard
 
her s
ing f
or a nursery school, and
 
t
hey wanted t
o l
earn how t
o s
ing and
 
accompany
 t
he mselves;  so  Bess
 
organized  an  i
nstrument c
lass. I
f
 
o
ther f

idn't know about t

she had t

a
t once, with n
ine guitars, f
our banjos,
 
and two mandolins, so she went ahead
 
and d
id I
t -
-  with great success. S
ince
 
t
hen she's been t
old about t
he d
iffi-
culties, but hasn't experienced t
he m
 
herself, and many o
f her c
lasses are
 
s
till s
tructured i
n t
his way. She says
 
t
hey make better music!
 
I
n Boston, her b
lending of social
 
n
sciousness with music prompted
 
r
 t

Bess was not much i

t
his. Her mother had d
ied shortlybe-
f
ore, and Bess had been s
ent t
o a
 
boarding school i
n Dallas.
 
Always a
 good s

tudied
 
hard a
t t
he boarding school and l
ater
 
a
t a public school; a
t t
he age o
f f
if-
t
een, she became a s
tudent a
t t
he Uni-
versity o
f Texas. Here began her as-
sociation with t
he world o
f f
olk music.
 
Through her f
ather and Alan, she met
 
several t
raditional s

ncluding
 
Leadbelly and t
he Gant f
amily, and was
 
i
nspired t

i

hat

rom t

of  t

t
hought o

After a year a

nvited
 
Bess t
o go a
long on a honeymoon
 
ocean voyage t
o Europe. Somewhat
 
d
iffident about being t
he t
hird party
 
i
n t
his s
ituation, Bess f
ound a
 way t
o
 
keep herself out of t

f

15 f
or a
 
second-hand guitar and t
aught herself
 
t
o p
lay i
t during t
he voyage.
 
She had, o
f course, no t
eacher: she
 
d
idn't even have an i
nstruction book.
 
Luckily, t
he guitar's previous owner
 
had pencilled on t
he t
op t
he l
etter-

f t
he open s
trings, so Bess
 
was able t

o
 
Europe, she f
igured out how t

lay
 
t
he chords o

t

t
hese f
ew chords, she f
ound she was

rely upon s

t
on once said t
o her, wistfully, "Gee,
 
I
 wish I

lay n

way you do!"
 
After t

rip t

seemed much i

I
n New York City, however, t
here
 
were p
lenty o

she spent as much t
ime t
here as her
 
s
tudies  would a

ust beginning t
o get t
o-
gether, and Bess j

a
long with such o
ther l
uminaries as
 
Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Butch
 
Hawes (who m she l

aught her t

his i
nstru-
ment and t
he guitar, she soon develop-
ed a good solid "back-up" s
tyle which
 
was quite important i

group t
ogether. She a
lso held t

t

hat she could never be con-

Her t

he workings o
f Bess Hawes
 
i
s t
o watch her handle a
 l
arge guitar
 
c
lass. She i
s n
ever i
n a
 hurry, never
 
d
idactic or d
ictatorial, n
ever critical
 
i
n any deotructive way. Her s
tudents
 
will a

or s

across her back, her g

op o

pencils s
tuck handily here and t
here
 
i
n her hair, she moves f

t
o s

istening t
o i
ndividual e
f-
f
orts and t
o t
he t
otal ense mble e
ffect,
 
a
ll t
he while with an a
lert eye out f
or
 
s
igns o
f unhappiness or confusion. The
 
whole setting i
s as i
nformal as can be,
 
yet t
here i
s ample evidence o
f
 a
 skill-
f
ul underlying organization. Bess pre-
sents each new concept i
n t
erms of
 
her belief t
hat s
tudents shouldn't be
 
pushed t
oo hard; t
hey should be en-
cou r
aged t
o reach continually f
or new
 
goals, but t
hey shouldn't t
oo o
ften be
 
f
aced with d
ifficulties t
hat see m, a
t
 
t
he  t
ime,  i
nsurmountable.  I
f she
 
senses t
he beginning of a t
oo-hard
 
s
truggle, she quietly l
eads t
he c
lass
 
i
nto something she knows i
t can do
 
well, and self-confidence i
s restored;
 
soon, t
hen, everyone will be ready f
or
 
a f
resh assault upon t
he proble m. Very
 
f
ew s
tudents have ever l
eft one o
f her
 
c
lasses with a f
eeling of f
rustration.
 
Bess says t
hat what she calls a
 
"flat-out" beginner can have f
unwith
 
h
is guitar r
ight f
ro m t
he f
irst l
esson,
 
but t
hat a good, solid, AUTHORITA-
TIVE  t
humb-pluck  accompaniment
 
usually can't be accomplished i
n l
ess
 
t
han a yea 
r-and 
-a 
-half. All sorts of
 
f
ancy runs and specific f
inger-styles
 
can be me morized earlier, but t
he
 
authority and t
he f
irm control j
ust
 
aren't t
here. Bess i
s quick t
o point
 
-28-
e
 
out t
hat her philosophy i
s j
ust one
 
among many equally valid ones, and
 
she l
aughingly says t
hat o
f a
ll t
he
 
scores o
f guitar t
eachers who s
tarted
 
out as her s
tudents, not one o
f t
he m
 
t
eaches by her methods: "They've
 
a
ll gone e
ither more c
lassical or more
 
e
thnic, and t
hey probably don't ap-
prove o
f me. .
.and t
hey a
ll p
lay better
 
t
han I
 do!" What Bess wants t
o do i
s
 
t
o help people t
o develop t
heir own
 
personal s
tyles, and i
n t
his she i
s
 
f
abulously successful.
 
One o
f her i
deas i
s t
hat, i
norderto
 
keep i
nterest a
live, t
he s
tudents must
 
produce some decent music a
t every
 
s
tage o
f t
he game. Partly t
o this end,
 
she has everybody l
earn t
o s
ing t
he
 
songs, o
ften i
n t
hree- or f
our-part
 
harmony, before a
tte mpting t
o add ac-
compani ments. She l
ikes t
o s
tart a
 
c
lass  session i
n t
his way, getting
 
everybody enthusiastic about a song,
 
t
hen getting down t
o work on t
he ac-
co mpaniment. Before c
losing, t
hey a
ll
 
do a r
epeat and practice o
f something
 
t
hey've  a
lready  l
earned,  so  t
hat
 
everybody goes home with good music
 
s
till r
inging i
n t
heir ears.
 
Thinking of herself mainly as a
 
scholar and t
eacher, Bess i
s s
till
 
called upon t
o do a great deal o
f per-
f
or ming. Her s
inging i
s quiet, a
lmost
 
self-effacing,  with  t
he  song i
tself
 
being f
ar more important t
han t
he
 
expression o
f her own personality.
 
Her ad miration o
f some o
f t
he songs
 
i
s obvious; even i
n f
ront o
f t
he l
argest
 
audience, she can become rapt i
n t
he
 
conte mplation of a beautiful melody
 
or a l
ine o
f poetry, and i
s not a
t a
ll
 
concerned with t
he f
act t
hat she i
s
 
t
he person who i
s doing t
he s
inging.
 
This admiration i
s contagious, and
 
countless people have f
irst appre-
c
iated f
olk music upon hearing Bess
 
s
ing. I
t i
s only when she has l
eft t
he
 
s
tage t
hat one realizes how s
ensitive
 
and skillful a performance she has
 
g
iven.
 
As a concert artist, panelist, l
ec-
t
urer, and t
eacher, Bess has t
o dash
 
about  t
o an endless succession o
f
 
campuses, schools, workshops, i
n-
s
titutes, coffeehouses, banquet halls,
 
and t
heatres. She has been f
eatured
 
i
n most o
f t
he great f
olk f
estivals,
 
i
ncluding t
hose a
t Berkeley, UCLA,
 
San Diego, Long Beach, and Newport;
 
and, f
or a number o
f sum mers, she
 
has been on t
he f
aculty o
f t
he f
olk
 
music  workshops  a
t  t
he  I
dyliwild
 
School  o
f  Music  and  t
he Arts, a
 
mountain branch o
f t
he University o
f
 
Southern California. Pete Seeger has
 
written o
f her t
hat "...she can s
ing
 
more songs, and prettier, t
han any
 
person I
 know."
 
At San Fernando Valley S
tate Col-
l
ege, Bess t
eaches several courses,
 
i
ncluding a general i
ntroduction t
o
 
f
olklore, a survey o
f American f
olk
 
music, and courses o
f special s
tudies
 
f
or advanced s
tudents. These c
lasses
 
are conducted very much l
ike her
 
"how-to" c
lasses, with t
he f
riendly
 
i
nfor mality o
f t
he a
tmosphere h
iding
 
t
he very careful organization. There
 
i
s a
 l
ot o
f back-and-forth d
iscussion,
 
and Bess has t
hat rare t
eacher's g
ift
 
o
f making every question p
lay an im-
portant part i
n t
he d
iscussion, and
 
o
f guiding t
he d
iscussion so i
t goes
 
where she wants i
t t
o go. Her courses
 
are not "Mickey Mouse" courses i
n
 
any s
ense; a great deal i
s de manded
 
of t
he s
tudents, but t
hey are not l
ed
 
t
o f
eel t
hat t
his i
s j
ust work-for-
work's-sake. And t
hey l
earn a great
 
deal about f
olklore. One o
f Bess's re-
quire ments i
s t
hat each s
tudent must
 
collect a song f
rom h
is own n
eighbor-
hood.
 
Bess a
lways has several b
ig pro-
j
ects on t
he f
ire. As o
f t
his writing,
 
f
or example, she i
s transcribing a
 l
ot
 
of Bessie Jones's songs f
rom t
ape t
o
 
print f
or her brother Alan, and she
 
i
s doing a guitar-instruction book. As
 
soon as t
hese projects are f
inished,
 
o
thers will c
lamor f
or a
ttention —  
and t
hey'll a
ll get done, eventually.
 
The Hawes l
ive i
n Santa Monica,
 
where Butch i
s a
 professional artist
 
and a good f
iddler who doesn't have
 
t
ime t
o practice. Son Nick i
s i
n h
igh
 
school, and can p
lay j
ust about any
 
k
ind o
f i
nstrument you'd l
ike t
o name.
 
The two daughters, Corey and Nao mi,
 
are  s
tudents  a
t  t
he University o
f
 
California i
n Berkcley; not only do
 
t
hey s
ing l
ike angels, but t
hey are
 
a
lmost as good guitar t
eachers as
 
t
heir mother.
 
As one l
ady put I
t duringf
le c
ourse
 
of a t
elephone conversation,  Bess
 
Hawes "...is I
n charge o
f f
olk music
 
i
n Southern California." And t

music o
f Southern California i
s I
n good

Dear Professor Hawes,
 
November 12, 1973
 
We want to thank you on behalf of our students and ourselves for the lecture
 
that you presented to our "Search For Identity" class on Identity and Style in
 
Folk Music.  Your presentation set the tone for our discussions of the relationship
 
between cultural and social patterning and individual creativity and autonomy, and
 
stimulated student interest and participation in our discussion groups.
 
i
c hope that you are aware of the enthusiasm which you generated in our
 
students.  There was much favorable comment on the interest and relevance of the
 
musical material that you presented, and on the depth and breadth of your knowledge
 
and the warmth of your presentation.  Thank you again for your generous contribution
 
to our program.

ubject:  Personnel Files
 
In accordance with the revised regulations in the Faculty Handbook regarding
 
personnel files, we have removed the attached documents from your Personnel
 
Action File and are returning them to you for your Professional Information
 
File.
 The new revision states,
 
"Each faculty member has the responsibility of establishing and
 
maintaining a record of professional information which shall be
 
submitted by the faculty member at the appropriate time for use
 
in evaluation for retention, tenure, promotion and merit salary
 
increase.
 The Department Chairman shall assist the faculty member
 
in the development of his professional file and alert him in
 
advance of the time when the file may be requested of him.
 The
 
Professional Information File should contain a current resume and
 
such forms as the College may, from time to time, prescribe.
 The
 
file shall also contain data on:
 
1
.
 Qualifications for teaching:
 degree, experience, research,
 
and publications.
 
2
.
 Teaching excellence.
 
3
.
 Professional contributions.
 
5
.
 Contributions to the College.
 
The faculty member may include, additionally, any other pertinent
 
support material."
 
Please do not hesitate to call me if this creates any problems for you, or
 
if you have any questions.
