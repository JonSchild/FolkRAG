[Letter from Harold Spivacke to Carita Doggett Corse,
August 31, 1939]
August 31, 1939
Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Director, Federal Writers Project 49 West Duval Street
Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
Thank you for your very interesting letter of August 28. I referred it to Mr. Alan Lomax
whose memorandum is enclosed. The technique he describes is an ideal one, of course,
and such things as biographies need not always be recorded on discs but are also useful
if attached in the form of a written documentation. The same applies to the recitation of the
words. It is very valuable to have a written copy of the text along with the records since this
cannot always be accurately transcribed from the discs themselves.
I have not yet received any request for an extension of this cooperative venture. Since I
have heard rumors to the effect that your project will be continued, I shall not, of course,
recall the machine. On the other hand, please see to it that we get this written request as
soon as possible for our files.
Very sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
