Dear Professor Dickison:
 
As you may know, we try to keep the
 
editorial board of Western Folklore somewhat
 
balanced in terms of the instftutional and
 
geographical location of the members.
 The
 
recent appointment of Barbara La Pan of
 
Northridge to serve on the board in the
 
capacity of editor of The Sourdough Crock
 
has resulted,  it seems to me,  in a regional
 
imbalance.
 
I should therefore ask you to accept
 
appointment to the editorial board for the
 
remainder of my term as editor.
 
Sincerely,
 
D. K. Wilgus

DearMrs. Hawes:
 
Thank you for your note of February 19.
 I would enjoy attending
 
your meeting next May.  But I fear that will not be possible, because
 
I an leaving the Press at the end of this month.
 
It would be quite possible for the Press to get you a financial
 
statement, however.  I have asked our accountant, Mr. J
. R
. Pinder,
 
to prepare something for you near the end of April.
 If matters
 
continue as they have thus far this year, there should be no
 
problems to warn about.
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Wilgus:
 
Of course what we want is the optimum subscription rate, the one that
 
will bring in the largest income.  It is not easy to determine this, especially
 
during a time of depressed academic income and inflation of everything else.
 
Including our costs.
 
As soon as we have final income and expense figures for the f
iscal
 
year just past, we shall put together a set of accounts to show you.  Our
 
preliminary figures indicate that the loss is still about 4
,000 a year.
 
The costs that you mention, "not previously charged to the journal,"
 
have always b
een there but were not brou€ht to anyone's attention s
imply
 
because I was able to absorb them in the operating account of the Press,
 
where they in effect added to the cost of publishing books and monographs.
 
This is no longer possible now that we have transferred a sum of money to
 
the Editorial Committee, which henceforth will review the journals annually
 
and make grants to those that, in its opinion, should have them.  From now
 
on, we must show complete costs.
 
I have known WES
=1 FOL nORE for a long time, long before it had its
 
present name and shortly after it was started, in effect, by the Press.  The
 
Society existed only in name until many years later.  I think you will l
earn
 
from Wayland Hand, should you ask him, that I have been a friend of the
 
journal and that I wish it well.  But if WESTERN FOLKLORE now belongs to the
 
Society and if the Press is merely an agent, publishing the journal by agree-
ment, then all of us will have to face up to the r
eal financial situation.
 
I don't -
know what this means, except that we shall not be able to live
 
the carefree life of the past, relying on state money without thinking too
 
much about it.  I wonder, for example, whether it is wise to freeze the sub-
. 
scription rate into the Society's constitution.  If Committee .
and Press s
hould
 
require an increase, how quickly could you move?

Mr. August Fruge, Director
 
University of California Press
 
2223 Fulton Street
 
Berkeley, California 94720
 
Dear Mr. Fruge
 
I am quite concerned about the proposal
 
to increase the subscription price of Western
  
Folklore to $10.
 First,  I doubt that this would
 
increase income;  I rather suspect it would result
 
in a decrease of subscriptions equal to or more
 
than the revenue.
 I doubt that we could increase
 
institutional subscription rates to $12; this we
 
could not even count on additional revenue from
 
the "hard core."
 
Let me make a comparison with the publication
 
status of the journal with which we should be
 
competitive.
 And I believe the quality of the
 
articles in the 1971 issues of Western Folklore 
match those in the Journal of American Folklore. 
But at that point the resemblance ceases.
 Member-
ship in the American Folklore Society is $10
 
annually, but JAF averages more than 100 pages
 
more per volume than does WF and in a larger format,
 
thus containing much more material.
 
Of course comparison is difficult because of
 
the larger membership of the two societies.
 But I
 
fear we will not increase our membership by raising
 
dues, rather the opposite.
 And it should be noted
 
that the total membership fee of CFS goes to the
 
U. C. Press.
 All other functions of the Society
 
are supported by registration fees and subventions
 
of time and money from various sources.
 
Mr. August Fruge
 
-2-
 July 13,  1971
 
The real answer is an increase in subscriptions, which
 
I am trying to achieve in part by a broadening and improvement
 
in the contents of the magazine.
 In the local area, the
 
Society is seeking to increase support among faculty and
 
students in various institutions.
 
I was not aware that the situation was as dire as you
 
have indicated, having been told previously that WF was in
 
good shape as compared with other Press journals.
 The last
 
estimate that I saw was dated 16 November 1970.
 While it
 
showed a deficit of $4,101,  it included a miscellany of items
 
"not previously charged to journal" of $5,811.
 It seems to
 
me that this item should be considerably reduced by recent
 
changes in the administration of the Press.
 UCLA now funds
 
the editorial assistant,  and most of the editorial duties
 
previously performed by the Press are now the responsibility
 
of the editor and his assistant.
 I would welccme more recent
 
information in order to determine just what advice I should
 
offer the membership of the Society.
 
And, of course,  I can only advise.
 A change in the
 
subscription fee will require a constitutional amendment
 
approved by two-thirds of the membership.
 
We are of course well aware of the bind of increasing
 
cost and decreasing budget.
 But we hope not to make the
 
situation worse.

You will be p
leased to l
earn, I believe, that the Editorial Committee
 
has approved our 1971/72 budget for scholarly journals, and that the budget
 
includes funds to subsidize WESTERN FOLKLORE for another year.
 
The Committee has, however, asked tra t we bring all the journals as
 
close to the break-even point as we can, and that we re-set subscription
 
rages at optimum figures, bearing in mind that scholarly books now s
ell for
 
more than 3
¢ a page.  We don't like to raise too steeply the rate for
 
WESTERN FOLKLORE since the number of pages given to subscribers is not great.
 
Nevertheless, the loss on this journal i
s greater than that on most of the
 
others, and we therefore propose to s
et the price at $10, with proportionate
 
increases to students and institutions.  Do you care to comment?
 
We are rapidly bringing the printing schedules up to date; the July issue
 
should be not more than a few weeks late.  Subscription records and the other
 
clerical work has been caught up.  Although a few loose ends remain, s
ervice
 
should be normal from now on.

TO:
 Editorial Board and Regional Editors,
 
Western Folklore
  
Having been dragged kicking and screaming into the
 
editorial chair of Western Folklore, I am announcing a few
 
changes in policy.
 
It is a
r
ty intention to remove all regional and ethnic
 
restrictions from editorial policy.
 Henceforth Western
  
Folklore will not be a regional journal, but in effect a
 
"Western Journal of Folklore."  I shall solicit articles on
 
the widest range of topics in folklore and shall publish
 
what I consider to be excellent material.
 (This means
 
particularly that the tabu against Amerind folklore no
 
longer exists.)
 
I shall need your help in obtaining the best material
 
available.
 And I shall also need your help in impressing
 
on all potential contributors the necessity of submitting
 
material in reasonable conformance with our editorial stvle
 
(
basically following the University of Chicago Manual of Style). 
Having inherited a backlog of materials unpublishable n
i  their
 
current form and having to both edit and rewrite to meet a
 
deadline, I am determined to insist on some degree of courtesy
 
from contributors.
 I hope to avoid the choler of John Greenway,
 
but I can well understand his -irascibility, if not the tone of
 
his therapy.
 
I am making no changes in the departments of the journal,
 
beyond replacing "Folklore Fillers" with the title of "Collectanea."
 
All sub-editors will remain.
 (Note that J. Barre Toelken is
 
now Book Review Editor and Norm Cohen of UCLA is in charge of
 
"Folk Music on Records. "
)
 
It is my assumption that Western Folklore is a journal
 
parallel to the Journal of American Folklore and the Journal
  
of the Folklore Institute.  But I shall need your help in
 
supporting this assumption.

For years Western Folklore has been heavily subsidized by the University
 
of 
•
 Press.  
•ling financial support from
University,
-
 
Press is being forced to limit its financing of the learned journals which it
 
• •
 
There are three ways in which members of the California Folklore Society
 
and other subscribers to T
,
,,
T
estern Folklore may help in this financial crisis.
 
The first is to try to win new subscribers.  Rates are as follows:
 
Regular Members:  $8.00 per year
 
Student Members:
• per
 
A second way is to increase the number of Institutional Patron Memberships,
 
of 
- are fewer than a dozen 
- present tim-
 u
 annual sup-
port
 
Finally, as many individual members as are able are urged to become Patron
 
Members.  The minimum annual support for this category of members is $15.  There
 
are fewer than a half a dozen Patron Members
present.
 
Please contribute in any way that you can to help Western Folklore become
 
self-supporting.  7de have a fine journal, and it deserves everyone's support.
 
I hope to see you at the Eighteenth Annual Conference, April 10-11 at
 
Santa Clara University.  Barnard Norris will be on hand to tell us more about
 
the financial plight of 
-
stern Folklore. The new editor of

Wilgus, will be there, as will Albert B

Al Friedman has resigned a
s editor of Western Folklore,
 
effective the second number of 1970, and we are thus faced
 
with the necessity of appointing a successor.
 
Alan Dundes, Al Friedman, and I
, in discussing the
 
matter, think that D. K
. Wilgus would be the best person
 
available to edit the journal.
 
Wilgus has had editorial experience, having founded
 
the Kentucky Folklore Record in 1955 and then editing it
 
for a dozen years thereafter.  He also edited the Hand Fest-
schrift.  He i
s close to the f
olklore scene nationally a
s
 
well as in California and the West and can do a lot to pep
 
up the "notes and Queries" and "Folklore and Folklorists"
 
features.
 
Another big plus is the fact that he i
s a faculty mem-
ber in the University of California system.  This i
s very
 
important these days, what with the dwindling support for
 
academic enterprises of a
ll kinds and particularly those
 
having to do with research in the strict sense.
 
The Executive Committee has full authority to act and
 
I do hope you can support us in this nomination.
 
I trust that you will be able to make the meetings at
 
Santa Clara.
 
Sincerely,
 
Wayland D. Hand, President

FROM:
 Barnard

ecretary-Treasurer
 
RE:
 Breakfast meeting of April 12, 1
968
 
The following is intended t
o serve as t
he m
inutes for t
he above meeting:
 
would you please let Hector Zee know i
f you want any corrections made
 
in t
he r
ecord.
 
I outlined t
he plight of WESTERN FOLKLORE; the journal has been losing
 
between $3,000 and $4,000 a year for t
he past s
everal years; the Press's
 
budget r
estrictions are such that we cannot continue t
o support the
 
journal at t
his level for very much longer; it s
eems that WF must either
 
cut expenses by r
educing t
he number of pages in each i
ssue or i
ncrease
 
i
nto m
a .
 
The consensus of the meeting was that every effort should be made t
o
 
increase intone.  Sam Hinton was elected--in absentia--as the m
an best
 
qualified t
o t
ry t
o obtain annual g
rants from the various University
 
campuses.
 
The officers felt t
hat t
he journal might increase its sales if:  1
) Indian
 
folklore were included within its purview; 2
) articles concerning urban
 
black culture were encouraged; and 3
) one or two i
ssues a year were s
et
 
aside t
o be used as special issues devoted t
o t
he folklore of specific
 
western states (
not including California).
 
At the business meeting on Saturday, Jan Crowley was elected as a Regional
 
Vice President f
or Northern California.  Also at t
his meeting t
he following-
m
otions were passed:  1
) "Urban black culture" i
s t
o be a theme of next
 
year's meeting; 2
) Patron subscriptions from individuals at a minimum rate
 
of A15 each are t
o be encouraged.  In discussion at t
he meeting, it was
 
suggested t
hat publicity be g
iven t
o t
he fact that patron subscriptions
 
are t
ax deductible.  It was also sug ested that a large number of reprints
 
of s
elected articles b
e as widely distributed as possible (
at t

fast meeting, it had been r
ecommended t

RE:
 ;
NESTER' FOLKLORE
 
Hector L
ee has responded to my memo of October 6 a
pproving the suggestions
 
to reduce the format of the journal somewhat and to use a slightly larger
 
type throughout.  We are therefore planning to effect these two changes
 
beginning with the January issue.
 
.
:s for the proposal to reduce the journal from 80 to 64 pages in the April
 
issue, Hector said he hoped that this could be discussed in a meeting
 
of the Vice Presidents.  Our financial situation is such that--unless
 
additional financial support can be procured--it s
eems to me the change
 
should be effected with the April issue.  Albert Friedman is scheduled to
 
have copy for this issue at the Press by December 1
5, and I therefore hope
 
that the Vice Presidents can meet before that date to discuss the matter.
 
If a meeting is impossible, might a d
ecision be reached through the mail?
