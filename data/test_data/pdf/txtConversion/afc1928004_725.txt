WhetPLena plays the Guitar  37 
Written and composed by JOS. PETTINGILL. 
Sung with wonderful success by the American 4. 
WHEN us colored folks go out a-promenading, 
We make the white trash smile ; 
Every one's attention is attracted 
With our own peculiar style. 
Oh, you should see us on a Sunday, 
Our leisure time away we do while 
By mashing all the dudes that's standing on the corners, 
And they follow us along for many a 
mile. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you should see those dandy coons 
Assemble in a line ; 
They raise their tiles to catch our smiles 
As we are passing by. 
Last night we went to a colored party, 
We knocked at the door and went in, 
1Vlien old Aunt Hannah sot her eyes upon us, 
From ear to ear she gave a 
grin. 
There was one or two couple on the floor, 
You ought to have seen their shape. 
You bet they made room when they seen us sparks 
For they knew that we'd carry off the cake. 
SECOND CHORUS. 
There were lots of dandy darkeys of great renown, 
And lots of colored wenches from miles and miles around. 
You ought to have seen Aunt Hannah, how she did laugh and 
shako, 
When we carried off the big pound cake.

FRONT DOOR BELL, 
Composed and written by HARRY C. 
T81413E/rt. 
Sung by GEORGE THATCHER. 
I 
LIVE in a 
browa-stone furnished flat, 
In the centre of the city; 
I 
feel quite satisfied at that, 
As also as my wife Kitty. 
We frequently have friends who call, 
But when we cannot tell; 
'Twould take a 
month to tell you all 
The folks who ring our bell. 
First it's uncle William, then it's cousin Nell„ 
Pulling away at our front door bell; 
The sound is so familiar, oh, how I 
hate tell 
Of the many people ringing our front door bell, 
how often after I 
get home, 
And a 
cosy nap am taking, 
You'd think iny home was not my own, 
My parlor four feet ,shaking.- 
UP overhead they kill me dead, 
With now and then a 
yell ; 
But worst of all, I've got to call. 
To answer our door bell. 
First uncle William, etc.

IT'S IRISH, 
YOU KNOW. 
SONG AND REFRAIN. 
Written and composed by J. W. W HEELER. 
Music published by CHAI1LES D. 
BLASE & Co., Boston, Mass. 
Sold at all Music Stores. 
Price 40 cents. 
W HEN you see the green flag waving over the red, 
It s 
because it is Irish, you know ; 
And each gal you will find proudly holding her head, 
Now that surely is Irish, you know. 
On St. Patrick's day we parade, 
And work every day at our trade, 
At carrying the hod, or turning the sod, 
And find it has paid. 
We like a 
sly drop now and then, 
The same as all fine Englishmen. 
There's never a 
dude among the whole brood 
Who's ever an Irishman been. 
REFRAIN. 
For don't you see, this cunning little dude 
With an eyeglass and graceful attitude, 
Would be but a 
toy for a 
bold Irish boy, 
Who dotes on such tender food. 
The wind of his stick would make them all ,sick, 
It's Irish, real Irish you know, 
There's an isle o'er the sea that is dear to us all, 
And it's Irish, quite Irish, you know ; 
And if ever perchance you should give them a 
call, 
You will tind them all Irish, you know. 
They carry their " heart on their sleeve," 
In liberty they firmly believe ; 
They're always " true blue," whatever they do, 
And friends they will never deceive.

IT'S IRISH, YOU KNOW.— Concluded., 
There's nothing. too Irish for them, 
They love all true-bon gentlemen. 
If there you should go, they'll give you a 
show, 
It's natural to all Irishmen. 
ttrimang. 
On Ireland's shore there's Emmet, O'Connell and Moore, 
Three grand true inen, like their sires in days of yore. 
In senate and song they battled the wrong. 
And dealt it full many a 
blow. 
They'd fearlessly light for Ireland and right, 
It's Irish, real Irish, you know. 
Now, we don't claim to set all the fashions or style, 
For that wouldn't be Irish, you know ; 
But when out on parade don't we all sport a 
tile, 
A 
rid that is quite Irish, you know. 
We're up to die slang of the day, 
Such as " Boys, now don't .2'iVe it away," 
And then in the fail we vote one and all, 
And that is quite Irish, you'll say. 
Yes, we know the slang of the day, 
Such as " Boys, don't you give me away." 
We'll take it sly glass, or blarney a 
lass, 
And that is quite Irish, you'll say. 
REFRAIN. 
At country's call, into line see the Irish fall, 
And hard blows strike for freedom, and home, and all. 
There's Phil Sheridan, a 
true Irishman, 
A 
braver no country can show, 
And Afeaglier and Kearney, who ne'er used blarney, 
They're Irish, real Irish, you know.

A PULLMAN SLEEPING CAR. 
Words by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
MUSIC by J. P. SKELLY. 
You all have travelled I've no doubt, in sleeping cars at 
night. 
You'll hear the gruff conductor shout, and put you in a 
fright; 
You'll meet some strange adventures there, while with a 
noisy jar, 
You try to sleep, all in a 
heap, in a 
Pullman Sleeping car. 
cnonus. 
There's sighs and cries, and blinking eyes. 
And snorers by the score, 
The rolling wheels, and baby squeals, 
Would wake your mother-in-law; 
The whistle blows, your feet are froze, 
To walk it would be cheaper, 
You pinch your toes, you smash your nose,— 
While in a 
Pullman Sleeper : 
A pug-nosed child in number TWO, whose eyes are full 
of tears, 
A drunken man in number FIVE, that everybody fears; 
A boy who's got the tooth- ache, and whose groans are 
heard afar, 
A poor old maid, who's much afraid in a 
Pullman Sleep-
ing Car. 
Cuo.—There's sighs and cries, etc. 
You lose yourself, and in dismay you find yourself at last, 
Intruding in some stranger's birth, from which you're 
roughly cast; 
You swear and tear and pull your hair, you don't know 
where you are, 
You're like a 
fish just out of sea, in a 
Pullman Sleeping 
Car. 
Cno.—There's sighs, and cries, etc. 
The car it swiftly rattles on while you seek your repose, 
Then comes the Porter with a 
lamp, and pokes it in your 
nose; 
Then some one's boot will strike your jaw and leave an 
awful scar, 
Your pants you lose, likewise your shoes, in a Pullman 
Sleeping Car. 
Cuo.—There's sighs and cries, etc,

WE ARE LADIES. 
Written andxomposed by J. PETTINGILL, for the American 4, and sung 
by them with great success in " Scenes in a 
Beanry." 
WE 
have been to a 
ball just over the way, 
And we've had such a 
pleasant time; 
Waltzes, pokas and quadrilles 
Never passed us by ; 
Two charming young men came in at about ten, 
And when they said, " Will you have a 
stew?" 
Why, this was our reply : 
CHORUS. 
We are ladies, we are ladies, 
You can tell us by our style: 
We set the boys crazy whenever we smile. 
We're the sweetest, we're the neatest— 
That's what they remark 
As we enter the ball-room. 
You should see them all start. 
LIFE IS SO GAY. 
Written by Jos. PETTINGILL for Miss GEORGIE PAREXIL 
?Pr 
LIFE, life, life is so gay, 
Think, think, think as we may; 
It flies d:iy after day, 
Not caring what you may say. (Repeat.) 
It's like the stars which shine so bright, 
Goes and comes quite out of sight; 
Like my heart, light and free, 
Waiting, lover fond; for thee. 
I'll meet you with fond words not few, 
Love tales again ril tell to you ; 
Conic quickly, dear lover so true. 
Come to the heart that's so gay. 
(Repeat Clams.)

I 
HEAT: de music playing 
As I 
come down de street, 
It reminds me of a 
colored baud 
That .used to play so sweet; 
Every member was a 
coon, 
And popular airs they played; 
You ought to hear de music, 
At a 
dance, or ou parade. 
CH011 US. 
Turn, turn, turn, the cornet went, 
Played by Jimmie Riddle. 
Zume, zume, zume, de old trombone, 
Johnson played de fiddle. 
Tute, tute, tute, the clarinet, 
Played by Jones' wife. 
Music on de fife. 
When de band begins to play, 
Then the people march away; 
Hear the foolish wenches say, 
Watch them coons, give them room, 
Dey ain't got long to stay. 
Jones' wife am tall and black, 
And seven feet she stands; 
She wants to be the leader 
Of that awful colored band. 
She plays the drum and cymbals, 
Most beautiful to see ; 
Her eyes are red, and the wig on her head 
Was built in " forty-three." 
Turn, turn, turn, etc.

THE 'COLORED BAND.—Concluded. 
One evening in de summer, 
They went out to serenade; 
They 'roused de folks for miles around 
With the discords that they made. 
The police came to stop de row, 
They thought there was a 
fight. 
That colored band marched hand in hand 
To the station- house that night. 
Turn, turn, tuna, etc.

THE TARGETEERS. 
Words by FnANKLIN W. nem 
AREN'T we the b'yes that are ready for frolickingi 
Marching along to the fife and the drum; 
Aren't we the jolly lads, jovial, rollicking, 
Shooting for prizes, and turkeys and rum, 
Lanagan, 
Branagan, 
Flanagan, 
Hannagan, 
Never a 
man but can fill up his can agaia. 
Ready to shoulder 
A 
musket, and bolder 
Than heroes of story and leaders of fame. 
Talk about Dollymount I 
'Tisn't the laste aoeount— 
We are the chaps for eclipsing that same. 
0! what a 
sight when the maidens Hibernian 
Rush up the areas to welcome " the boys 1" 
Lave to the classics your vintage Falernian, 
Whiskey's the stuff for exciting a 
noise. 
Drumming and 
Strumming, and 
Thrumming, and 
Bumming, and 
Shrieking of fifes tell the " sojers " are coming, and 
Molly and Bridget . 
All git in a 
fidget, 
Lavin' the pots and the kitties alone. 
Acushla don't mintion ! 
Don't we git attintion 
As every Novhnber has certainly shown. 
THE TARGETEERS.—Concluded. 
See how our captain— that's him wid a 
feather— 
Handles his sabre, bedad ! but it's foine; 
stepping along in a 
huddle together, 
Drawn in a 
circular sort of a 
loine; 
Bold Billy Rooney 
For sergeant, 
And Cooney, 
Coporal Mooney and leftenant Limey; 
Flags to float o'er us, 
And judges before us, 
goblets, and salvers, and big pewter castors; 
Bouquets and flowers, 
Ye'd think, by the powers, 
Aich soldier was born wid the wealth of the Astors. 
Then when at night we come back to our home again, 
Wid an uncertain step marching along; 
Whist ! as the shouts " here the bully boys 
me again,' 
Rise from the throats of the juvenile throng ; 
There's Tommy 
Radigan, 
Gone to the 
Bad again, 
Trying to hold up young Barney O'Bradigan; 
Soldiers Utopian, 
Black Ethiopian, 
Coming behind with the target we've ra4led 1 
0! but it's glorious, 
Slightly uproarious, 
Only to think of the whiskey we've baffled, 
THE DANDY COLORED MASHER S. 
As performed and sung by the Irresistible Eccentrics, the " American 
Four." 
No use talking, we are gorgeous, 
Double X and superfine; 
When we dress up in our latest, 
You can bet we cut a 
shine; 
Swallow- tail pants and stand-up collars, 
Shoes that look like cords of wood, 
We are the dandiest colored mashers 
In our high-toned neighborhood. 
CHORUS. 
Don't you see the wenches smiling 
When we take a

For we dandy colored mashers 
Throw our rivals in the shade. 
When the sun is brightly shining . 
We go strolling through the park, 
" 
They're pink rosebuds of fashion," 
The colored ladies all remark; 
With our walking canes, so 'lobby, 
We're considered quite la-de-da, 
And to all the daisy wenches 
We throw kisses---T,-ta-ta.

A 
SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene, a 
wood. 
Enter PETE, an ° lit darkey, with a 
stick and 
bundle over his shoulder. 
The music plays the first strains 
of " Old Kentucky Home.] 
PETE. — It's a 
long, long road I've trabbled; and I 
don't 
seem to get any nearer to my journey's end. 
I've been north, 
and east, and west: but I 
neliber could content myself. 
Dar's 
no place like de old plantation. 
How many happy days I've 
spent dar! Dar's where my old woman libed long years ago. 
Dar's where my children used to play 'round me, and where 
Massa and Misses used to be. 
On, de dear old home ! I 
wonder if dar's anyone 
dar yet. 
No better home on de 
face of de earth. 
I've been gone many a 
year. but I've found 
no home. 
I'm trabbling on to rest dese old bones, under de 
shade of tie trees, where I 
used to play when I 
was a 
boy. 
[Going.] 
[Enter M ASSA CHARLES. ] 
CHARLES. — Well, as I 
live, if that isn't old Uncle Pete! He 
won't know me, of course. 
PETE. — I 
heard a 
voice somewhere, sure. 
CrtitimEs.—Don't you know me, Uncle Pete ? 
PETE. —No! No! I 
doesn't remember any body in these 
parts. 
I've been gone so long. 
CHARLES. — Why don't you know young Massa Charles, 
that you used to dance on your knee. 
PETE. — You Massa Charles? Well I 
well! Why I 
shouldn't 
have known you if I 
hadn't seen you! 
CHALLEs.—FA(lieu.) I 
see the old man is a 
little confused 
in the upper story. 
Purn.—Well ! well! Don't know your face; but I 
suppose 
you's Massa Charles. 
How's de old folks ? 
CHARLES. — All well, and flourishing; but the old home is 
ours no more. 
Do you remember the old home, Uncle Pete ? 
PETE.— DO 
I 
remember it? Ab, yes! 
CHARLES. — Do you remember that old song you used to sing 
about it? 
PETE. • 
-- Do I remember it? Oh, how many a time I've 
sung it, as I've jigged along on de road, just to keep up dis 
old heart! 
Cr` RLES. — Sing it now, Uncle Pete, and it will gladden 
my heart to hear it.

KEISER'S WINDOW- SILL. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Music by J. P. SKELLY. 
In a 
tenement house on Orchard Street, 
John Keiser does reside, 
It looks just like an up-town flat, 
The xvindows are so wide; 
There is no yard behind the house, 
No garden green to till, 
And so he keeps his hot-house plants, 
Upon the window- sill. 
CHORUS. 
There's a " Pansy" in an oyster can, 
In a 
bottle there's a " Rose," 
A " Tulip " 
fl an old high hat, 
So beautifully grows ; 
A "'Violet" in a 
cuspidore, 
That frost or snow can't kill, 
A " Bleeding Heart" in an old soap- box, 
On Keiser's window- sill. 
On Sunday nights when work is done, 
John Keiser sits at ease, 
Beside the window with his pipe, 
To catch the gentle breeze; 
The blinds are open and the scent, 
Comes through the room at will, 
From Pansy, Pink and Violet, 
On Keiser's window- sill. 
Cuo.—There's a 
Pansy, etc. 
To have a 
stylish funeral, 
The neighbors all around, 
Think Keiser's flowery parlor front, 
The best that can be found; 
The undertaker wears a 
smile, 
When thinking of his bill ; 
And flowers free, can gathered be, 
From Keiser's window- sill. 
CHo.—There's a 
Pansy, etc. 
Now, John was coining home one night, 
As full as he could be, 
lie had some trouble with the door, 
The key- hole, and the key; 
,--.Z.z4g24.01:491W 
. 19 
The window through he tried to climb, 
But things turned out so ill, 
The Plants all tumbled down with him. 
From off his window-sill. 
CHORUS. 
The " Pansy" hit him on the ear, 
The " Tulip " on the nose, 
And 'mid the shower of flower-pots, 
In his eye he caught the ' Rose"; 
The soap-box fell upon his head, 
With force enough to kill; 
You'd think a 
house had tumbled down 
From Keiser's window- sill. 
NOPODY KNOWS VERE NOVERE IS.

man, a

Alit yishkers so vite like shnow;

Und his gaid vas lame und shlow. 
He'd dodder along in a

Und den he'd mumple out loud to himself: 
"Vere novere is—ah! nopody knows. .

Or borwer or fame, or anyding, 
Und noveres can dey vent to found oud 
how much (ley need to happiness pring. 
Ye live, ye drife, ve doll, ye shdrive, 
Und den ye die— dot ends our voes.

WE ARE TWO BUSTERS.

1.03C+VaSktLiVelOiti,,i4iis.A14V 
Written by Jos. PETTINGILL of the " American Four." Sung nightly. 
WE 
are two swells of the day, 
That's what the people all say; 
We live on the air at Madison square; 
We're going to get a 
fortune, 
Ten dollars on a 
share; 
Our money well spend at our ease; 
At parties we're bound to please. 
With our pivoting dance 
There's none stands a 
chance 
Like the two Ulster brothers, you see. 
CHORUS. 
Oh we are two busters, look at onr ulsters, 
We are the swells with the glass in our eye; 
We are two babies, killers of ladies, 
And as they pass by us they laugh out, ha, ha! 
THE ESTHETIC DUDE. 
Sung by the world's greatest Banjoist, E. M. HALL, with Etaverly's AMC). 
,dons. 
Also, by the great " American Four." 
I'LL sing of a 
dainty young man of fashion, 
Who just about now is the style and the rage; 
He looks like a 
donkey and acts like a 
monkey, 
The place to put him would be a 
big cage. 
His hair is done up in bangs and frizzes; 
A 
New Jersey lily he smells for food; 
His pants are so tight that it makes the head light 
Of this strange freak of fashion, the "Esthetic Dude. 
His collar's so big that it hides his big ears, 
His nose is high toned, for it points to the skies; 
The boys call hint Biddy, for he is so giddy, 
And the way he walks you'd think he could fly. 
Now to all young ladies who may want to marry, 
I 
give this advice, so don't think me rude: 
You can't tell if you're hitched to a 
male or a 
female 
you marry this toast and mulish song Dude.

W IJAT I'D DO WHEN PRESIDENT. 
An original stump speech composed for the great Irish Cartoonist 
and Comedian, PAT REILLY, by D. F. 
M ORETON. 
GENTLEMEN AND LADIES :—I 
say gentlemen before the 
ladies, because I 
find in the case of a 
good-looking man, 
like myself, the ladies are after the gentlemen. I 
intend 
to inform ye how near I 
came to being President of the 
United States. 
I 
would be President of this land of the free and home 
of the working slave but for two things :—one was, I 
went to Cincinnati and I 
did not get the nomination ; 
the other reason was, I 
wouldn't have been elected if I 
did. 
But I'm President in my mind, anyhow, and I'll tell 
ye what I'd do. 
In the first place I'd make my cabinet; 
and I'll tell ye who I'd put in it: 
I'd make Henry Ward 
Beecher Secretary of the Interior. 
He could preach to 
the Indians and make love to the squaws. 
I'd make Denis Kearney Secretary of War ; and by all 
the goats in Ireland—and that's a 
heavy oath—we'd al-
ways have war. 
I'd make Courtney, the oarsman, Secretary of the 
Navy; he knows more about rotten boats than any man 
in America. 
I'd make Bob Ingersoll Chaplain of the Senate, and 
we'd have no more hell. 
I'd build a 
railroad to Ireland, so the Irish could walk 
over instead of swimming across. 
I'd run steamboats to the comet and horse cars to the 
Mars. 
I'd give every good-looking woman a 
vote. 
I'd annex New Jersey to the United States. 
And last, but not least, I'd make Saint Patrick's day 
come in summer time, when it couldn't snow and 
wouldn't rain, because I 
never paraded a 
day yet that 
nly regalia didn't get wet.

I USED TO OWN A DONK EY. 
Words by 14E.N. Commrs. 
Sung by MANCHESTER and JEXN-
INGS. 
I 
USED to own a 
donkey, 
A 
bob- tailed stubborn cuss, 
He was born around the Spring of '40. 
His hide was full of scars 
From stopping railroad cars. 
He had blind staggers, he was ringboned, deaf and blind, 
He could kick like a 
steam engine, 
He could raise you through the roof 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs. 
But he died at half- past four, 
He has gone to that beautiful shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHOIICS. 
Davy's left the stable 
For that promised land; 
his overshoes and saddle are in pawn. 
No more he'll ever chew, 
They have turned hini into glue, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's departed. 
His hoof was like a 
sling shot, 
He could drive it through a 
wall; 
He'd come into the house and kick you out of bed, 
His feet was full of bunions, 
He could eat a 
barrel of onions, 
And go to sleep standing on his head. 
He'd go in a 
saloon, stick his foot into a 
spittoon, 
Kick the bar into the street, just for a 
joke. 
When he laid down and died, 
All the mules in Jersey Cried, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's croaked. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to be an angel 
With spit- curls on his brow; 
He died with epozoodic in the head 
He was to go to Congress, 
With all the other mules, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's dead.

IF I 
ONLY WERE A PRETTY LITTLE 
FLY. 
As sung by Gus W ILLTAms. 
While sitting at my ease, enjoying much the breeze, 
At my window the other afternoon, 
A pretty little fly, I 
saw came darting by, 
He buzzed as he flew into the room; 
He alighted here and there, devoid of ev'ry care, 
As round about he went with utmost speed, 
And with beautiful repose, he settled on my nose, 
Which I 
thought was impudence indeed. 
So between you and me, when I 
his tricks did see, 
A 
thought struck me quickly by- the- bye, 
To. what places I 
could go, and what strange things I 
would know, 
If I 
only were a 
pretty little fly. 
I'd go to Coney Isle in most fashionable style. 
And the boats could ne'er sink me in the sea; 
If travling by the train, I 
could go from here to Spain, 
No accident would ever trouble me; 
I'd 0
-o 
among the boys and share in all their joys, 
And at the " Brighton " I 
would dine each day; 
Through Central Park I'd ride, with Jennie by my side, 
And listen to whatever she might say; 
I'd know the winning horse and bet on him of course, 
And for a 
drink I 
never should be dry; 
Tho' I 
could'nt dance or sing, I'd do most ev'rything, 
If I 
only were a 
pretty little fly. 
In the politicians way, I'd wander ey'ry day, 
And know just how they run that great machine; 
To each alderman I'd say, they ought to raise your pay, 
'Tis the hardest working office ever seen ; 
In bob tail cars I'd ride, no fare I 
would provide, 
Till they came and took the money in their hand; 
I'd do just as I 
please, and the girls how I 
would teaze, 
While strolling through the moonlight on the sand; 
I'd wake up every day with a 
head so clear and gay, 
To play me for an " angel " none would try; 
With a 
smile for every one all trouble I 
would shun, 
If I 
only were a 
pretty little

A PARODY ON " BABY MINE." 
Written expressly for the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIZLDS 
by BILLY ROBINSON. 
On, my wife she is a 
slugger, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Like a 
trotting horse we rub her, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
Oh, she hit me with a 
brick, 
But my head it was too thick, 
So you see I 
broke the brick, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
But I'll hit her and knock her sick, baby mine. 
Oh, the babies on our block, 
How they bawl, how they squall 
For their fathers and, their mothers 
At the Skidmore's fancy ball. 
I'll meet you in the hall-way door, 
Something I 
never done before, 
But the villain still pursued her, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
Get thee gone, get thee gone, baby mine. 
She has chin whiskers on her hose, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Oh heavens ! how it grows, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
She was a 
pastry cook, 
Her mother and me she shook 
For to dance in the Black Crook, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
Forty dollars from me she took, baby mine. 
TWO BENJA1VIINS . 
Original with Cooir,r, and COOPER (Charles W. Cogill and Fred. A. 
Coopv), and sung with great success by the Cop11 Bro's (Chas. 
\\T and Harry P.) in their original style of specialty, entitled 
" 
Chit- Chat." 
SEE our style and dashing figures, 
We always travel with the upper ten 
Don't you think that we're extraordinary niggers? 
We're easy, careless, lively Eenjamins. 
We were raised quite young by our father and mother. 
Ever since we were two little picayunes; 
We're also twins to our other little brother, 
A.nd as lively and as smart as crickets or coons. 
CHOR CS. 
Oh, my gracious! watch us throw our feet, (
break.) 
Oh, hallelujah! us coons am hard to beat, (
break.) 
It is easy for to see we darkeys are no shams, 
We're easy, careless, lively Benjamius. 
In town, they say we are high-toned darks; 
With fashions we're bound to keep along ; 
They also say we're colored men of mark, 
And cf course you know their opinion isn't wrong. 
You can never, 'pon our word, see us niggers associate 
With any of the other colored men. 
You will find our names in the morning papers, 
Stated saucy and free, with the flourish of a 
pen. 
Oh, my gracious 1 
etc. 
Now if there are any young girls in the city, 
That would just throw themselves away, 
On us colored individuals take pity, 
For you know we have not long to stay ; 
We will do all the cooking, keep the house to rights, 
Keep the hotel as bright as a 
gem; 
You mustn't find fault if we come in late at night, 
We'll come in when you hear the cackling of the hens.

HOTEL DE VARSELY. 
By ED. HARRIGAN. 
I'm living at a 
boarding-house 
Up in Houston street, 
Where actors and musicians 
Eat their meals and sleep. 
There the hungry ballet tramp 
That come from Marceht, 
Dancing Danish polkas 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
CHORUS. 
All night I 
am uneasy, 
No sleep at all I 
get, 
Wid bones and clappers rattling 
And a 
Prussian clarionet, 
They never talk in English, 
But parley vous Francay. 
I'll lose my life, upon my soul, 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
When we sat down to breakfast, 
It's Cully, pass me that, 
Or Nixy Weedy, Nibzy, 
Stag the tad wid the dizzy hat. 
They have a 
soup called bullion, 
The butter runs away, 
The boarders holler out for dates 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
All night I 
am, etc. 
The other night I 
tried to .sleep, 
-When a 
man from Calumet 
Came down through the ceiling ? 
Turning a 
summerset. 
I 
grabbed him by his necktie, 
He " Hay Rube ! hay Rube 1" did say. 
I 
was kicked by a 
circus company 
From the Hotel Varselay. 
All night I 
am, etc,. 
I 
went up stairs to get my trunks, 
And have revenge or die, 
When a 
man they called a 
tumbler 
Said, " Shoot him—kill the guy." 
I 
drew a 
knife and grabbed my trunk, 
The French said " Allecushay." 
My trunk was nailed unto the floor 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
All night I

A SKETCH FOR THREE CHARACTERS . 
[Scene, a 
room. 
Enter HUNGRY JAKE and Jim.] 
HUNGRY JAKE.—I 
can't go any further on an empty stom-
ach. 
I 
haven't smelt of a 
square meal for the last six months. 
Free lunches on the island aint what they're cracked up to be. 
Oh, dear! I'm hollow. 
Jim.—Oh, come along. 
You're always growling. 
Why, it 
isn't three days yet since you had a 
peanut. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—.-I 
want something more nourishing.. 
I 
would like to tackle a cow or an elephant. 
Jim.—Brace up. 
We can get a good square meal here if 
you only do as I 
say. 
This is the gentleman's house who ad-
vertised in this week's Clipper for two artists in the singing 
line. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—We look more in the Sing- Sing line. 
Oh, 
dear! if I 
only had the cover of a 
herring box, or an old India 
rubber shoe. 
JIM. — There you go again. 
Brace up, now; here comes the 
gentleman. 
[Enter Mn. JOHNSON.] 
JIM.—Good morning, sir. 
HUNGRY JAKE..— Good morning. 
" 
eat." 
[Aside.] 
I 
hope he'll say 
M R. JOHNSON.— Good morning, gentlemen. 
You have 
called, I 
presume, about the advertisement. 
JIM. — Yes ; 
ny friend and myself have just left our eba, 
teaux, and wish to accept of your situation merely for amuse. 
men:. and more to pass away time than anything else. 
IfuNGRY JAKE (aside).—Just left our chateaux! 
That's the 
first time I 
ever heard the island called by that name before. 
M. JOHNSON.—Well, gentlemen, what is the style of your 
voices, bass or tenor? 
Or do you play ? 
HUNGRY JAKE (
aside).—I'd like to play with a knife and 
fork. 
JIM.—My 
friend here is just from the Conservatory at. Paris, 
ar4 is a tenor of very superior abilities. 
( 
1 ) 
Mn. JOHNSON.—Indeed! 
HUNGRY JAKE.—Yes, 
sir. 
[Aside.] 
I wish he'd say 
" 
food." 
M R. JOHNSON.—And yourself? 
JIM.—Oh, I'm a 
bass. 
ituNortv JAKE (aside).—Base enough for anything. 
Mn. JOHNSON.—Well, gentlemen, if you will just sing a 
song or an aria, merely to show me the style of your respect-
ive voices, we will adjourn to the dining- room. 
HUNGRY JAKE (leaning against hEr, aside).—Oh my, he 
said eat! 
It takes away my breath. 
Jm.—What composition shall we sing, sir ? 
M R. JOHNSON.—Oh, suit yourself. 
Something from the old 
masters. 
Beethoven, Mozart, or anything classical. 
JIM.— Humph! [Aside to HUNGRY JAKE.] 
Now, Jake, 
do your best. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—I 
can't sing on an empty stomach. 
0 
Lord! 
Mn. JOHNSON.—All attention, gentlemen. 
[HUNGRY JAKE= and JIM strike attitudes, and with a 
great 
deal of preliminary manteuvring they suddenly commence the 
song," Solid Dishes to the Front." 
Mn. JOHNSO:N is horrified, 
and endeavors to stop them. 
Failing to do so he exits, and re-
turns with a 
policeman who claps handcuff's on them, and takes 
them off.  
Thcy go, singing the chorus at the top of' their voices.]

PUG-NOSED SAL. 
Written by Jos. PETTENGILL, and sung by the " American 
PUG-NOSED SAL was a 
little daisy, 
She set all the niggers crazy, 
She was ugly, she wa2 lazy, 
Yet, somehow, I 
loved her well. 
When I 
called around to meet her, 
To a 
keg of beer I 
used to treat her; 
She looked so sweet that I 
could eat her, 
How she made me feel I 
could not tell, 
But I 
loved her, I 
know well. 
Now true love you know makes much slaughter, 
She was a 
millionaire white-washer's daughter, 
And when I 
wildly, madly sought her, 
Her cruel parient muddy sweared; 
He set his great big bull pup, Towser— 
How I 
felt I 
don't know now, sir, 
But the southeast end of my trousers, 
This cruel anindle teared. 
Now that 'ere doff must be mistaken, 
My flesh was chewed and my bones were shaken, 
He thought that I 
was some smoked bacon, 
When Sal called me a 
hog. 
My trousers seat he so dislocated 
That I 
had to get them vaccinated, 
And I 
really felt quite aggravated 
By that great big yalier dog.

I'M IN JAIL, 
MY LOVE. 
Written, and sung with great success, by the Master Banjoist, Jor. 
I 
STOOD alone at the bar, • 
And got so boiling tight, 
That a 
copper run me to the station-house, 
And there I 
slept all night. 
I 
was thrown down in a 
cell 
With a 
lot of other jays; 
Next morning I 
heard the judge sing out, 
"Ten dollars, or ten days " 
I 
was clubbed, and run, and made to dance, 
Thrown in with a 
lot of tramps. 
CHORUS. 
I've had shakes, my love. I've seen snakes, my love, 
I've had the jim-jams and the horrors. my love; 
I've drank ale, my love, fin in jail, my love— 
Bail out your sailor boy. 
'When I 
awoke next morn, 
My hat was seven sizes too small, 
Pot' my head was terribly swelled, 
I'd have given the world for a 
ball. 
I 
was sick and I 
was sore, 
I 
was bruised and I 
was jammed, 
I 
forgot ,it 
name and NvIiere I 
lived, 
If I 
didn't, I'll be hanged. 
I'm sick abed, my love, I'm nearly dead, my love, 
Oh, I've got a 
terrible head, my love, 
A whiskey sour, my love, I 
could devour, my love, 
Send gin fizzes to your sailor boy. 
I'll retire, my love, to the Maria, my love, 
And up on the Island I'll perspire, my love, 
All alone, my love, I'll break stone, my love— 
Still I 
am your sailor boy. 
WHEN LENA PLAYS ON THE GUITAR. 
Words by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Music by J. P. 
SKELLY. 
Published by POND 
Co., 25 Union Square, N. Y. 
I'm fond of sweet music and often I 
go, 
At night when its lonely and still, 
To hear my sweet Lena who sings soft and low, 
In the cottage just under the hill; 
She sits in the parlor and watches for me, 
The light in her window's my star; 
I 
soon sit beside her and happy are we, 
When Lena plays ou the guitar. 
CHORUS. — She sings and she plays, 
While fondly I 
gaze, 
Upon her my own guiding star. 
There's joy in the air, 
For nothing we care, 
When Lena plays on the guitar. 
The old folks are sleeping, the dogs are at rest, 
So I 
can do just as I 
please; 
With such a 
companion, of course I 
am blest, 
I 
listen and feel at my ease; 
But Lena is anxious at each little sound, 
She fears for her angry papa; 
I'm not in his graces, he knows I'm around, 
When Lena plays on the guitar. 
Cuo.—She sings and she plays, etc. 
I'll go there some evening and knock at the door, 
And sweet Lena I'll serenade, 
And then we will fly to return nevermore, 
With Inc she will ue'er be afraid; 
Amid when she is mine, she'll charm me each nig 
While warbling her sweet tra-la-la; 
At home by her side I 
will stay with delight, 
When Lena plays on the guitar. 
CH0.—She sings and she plays, etc,

PARODY ON 
STICK TO YOUR MOTHER, TOM. 
Words by W ILLIE wn.DwAyE. 
OH, well do I 
remember the night that I 
was born, 
I 
danced upon my sister's neck and pared my papa's corn; 
My breath was sweet with onions, nothing marred my joy, 
I 
was my mamma's darling, my papa's fair-haired boy. 
My papa was a 
whaler— a 
schoolmaster, you must know, 
Who used me as a 
hat- rack ‘vhene'er he .got a 
show. 
A bank cashier he left us and went to Can-a- tin, 
And as he skipped the town one night, tlrese words to me did 
Say : 
CHORUS. 
Stick to your mother, Toni, while she has wealth, 
Never do a 
stroke of W01 k. '
tis bad for the health ; 
Be a 
corner statue, Toni, loaf around all day, 
Oh, hit her with an axe when her hair turns gray. 
Last night I 
dined with Jay Gould, and there met Vanderbilt, 
I 
asked him for a 
million dollars, and came near twine- killed; 
John L. and I 
put on the gloves, but I 
knocked him out of 
sight, 
Then blew up Blooming Ilingland with a 
charge of dynamite. 
I 
mesmerized my mother-in-law so charming- anti so neat, 
She presented me with a 
house and lot at thirty New York St.; 
The wind blew thro' my vitskers and trilled this merry tune, 
It's very cold in winter, and the walking's good in June. 
Seogrx.--,Ah, yes, I 
can never forget the old gentleman's 
admonition, as he elevated his pedal extremities and peregrin-
ated across the cold and frosty thoroughfare, in a 
murmur that 
sounded like an angel's whisper: 
ClloRL'S. 
Stick to your mother, Toni, while yon have luck, 
She is the gilly, boy, you can easily pluck; 
Never soil your hands with work when I 
am far away, 
Oh, fan her with a 
bale- stick when hair turns gray.

DOWN BY THE RIVE R, 
Sung by the 4. 
American Four./ 
SILVER stars are shining bright, 
Softly beams the moon to-night; 
Silver breezes blowing clear, 
Tell me my love Willie is near. 
Thanks to the stars that friendly shine, 
They keep the secrets of Willie anti I; 
They are the ones that alone can tell 
How oft I'm waiting for Will. 
CHORUS. 
When in the eve birds build their nests, 
When from its labor the world is at rest, 
When the sweet hour chimes on the hell, 
Down by the river I'm waiting for Will, 
The moon shining bright, the wind blowing slight, 
No one is near when we're telling our love; 
Oh, how my heart beats when he repeats, 
"Be mine forever, my sweet turtle (love." 
One little kiss, then soon we depart; 
One lingering look of rapture and love; 
One little sigh joy does impart, 
Tells me he loves me all otiltv above. 
When in the eve, etc. 
OVER THE BARNYARD FENCE. 
Words by IKE BROWNE. 
Ant—" Over the Garden Wall. ,7 
MY 
love stood under a 
gooseberry tree, 
Over the barnyard fence; 
She whispered and said, " Will you come to me,' 
Over the barnyard fence? " 
She had ‘• Syracuse" hair and a 
turkey-red nose; 
She wasn't very tall, so she stood on her toes, 
And many a 
time to her lips I 
have froze, 
Over the barnyard fence. 
CHORUS. 
Over the barnyard fence, 
To this dear girl's residence, 
I 
went like a 
feather in windy weather, 
For there never was ever a 
slinger of leather 
Like Uncle Si, as he raised me high 
Over the barnyard fence. 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the barnyard fence; 
She bravely promised with me to slide, 
0.,-er the barnyard fence; 
But she yelled, " Mv mash, don't be too rash; 
Here conies my old man 
he'll settle your hash; 
So I 
think you'd better make a 
dash 
Over the barnyard fence." 
Over the 
fence, etc. 
The old man stood under the gooseberry tree, 
Over the barnyard fence; 
He whispered, and said he was going for me, 
Over the barnyard fence. 
He'd a 
foot like a 
pie, and his name was Si; 
He was fall of old rye—" how's that for high ?" 
And I 
jumped from the toe of his boot to the sky, 
Over the barnyard fence. 
Over the barnyard fence, etc.

THE ROLLER SKATING RINK. 
Words and Music by IKE BROWNE. 
The music of this song is published by W. A. EVANS & BRO., 50 Brom-
field et., Boston, Mass. 
Price 40 cents. 
Sensations DOW are all the rage, the latest agitating 
The public mind, is how to know'the art of roller skating. 
People forget they have a 
trade to earn their bread and butter, 
If you mention business, they of skates will only mutter. 
It is worse than epizootic, whooping cough or bilious colic, 
This academic, epidemic, roller skating dude. 
If to a 
friend upon the street you say, " Conte up my way," 
The chances are he'll turn about quite suddenly and say— 
CHORUS. 
I 
thank you, but then I 
think 
I'd prefer to go down to the rink, 
Where society belles and jolly young swells, 
Are giving each other the wink; 
Where the flirt and the '• masher king," 
And the dude, that queer little thing, 
Can be seen any tone, for the sum of a 
dime, 
At the roller skating rink. 
The other eve. I 
went to call upon a 
darling creature, 
When there I 
met, to my surprise, that roller skating teacher. 
He'd been to call upon my girl, and they were just debating 
The question of a 
little whirl that night at roller skating. 
I 
sought no-introduction, I 
was a 
trifle rude, 
For I 
hated this conceited,- brainless, roller skating dude. 
I 
asked my girl if she that night to the play would like to go, 
She blushed and smiled upon us both, but answered very loss,. 
I 
thank you, but then I 
think, etc. 
The moral of this business you can very plainly see, 
If you want to 
catch on " readily, a 
skater you must be; 
Among the girls you are N. G., and never will be trusted, 
Until you've givn ample proof that all your bones are busted; 
And if the very pinnacle of fame you'd like to reach, 
Take my advice, and quickly learn in skating how to teach. 
Like a 
magnet you will surely draw, the girls to you will fly, 
To other invitations they will offer this reply— 
I 
thank you, but then i 
think, etc. 
Written and sung by nanny EVE, the successful English Comic. 
SOME people they say that I'm curious, and tell me I 
never refuse, 
No matter from whence I 
obtain it, in getting the latest 
of news. 
Well, I 
certainly own that I 
do so, and therein is no harm, 
I 
Opine, 
Whatever I 
hear I 
keep close, for of coarse it's no business 
of mine. 
(
Repeat.) 
For instance, at Mi.3. Montgomery's, a 
gent with a big 
black mustache, 
Calls there most every evening, and for Mrs. Montgomery 
does ask. 
He stays till half-past eight o'clock ; Montgomery gets 
home about nine. 
Now I'd like to know what he does there, but of course it's 
no business of mine. 
(Repeat.) 
Now, I met young Miss Smith 'tother ev'ning, she was 
taking a 
nice country walk, 
And as soon as she spied me she did commence for to ha.va 
a 
long talk, 
All about her dear little nephew who, she says, is between 
eight and nine. 
Some say that it isn't her nephew, but of course it's no 
business of mine. 
(
Repeat.) 
At Mrs. Fitzgibbons, the baker's, the people are raising a 
din, 
They say that she won't pay her rent, so the sheriff and 
auctioneer's in. 
I 
can't tell what she does with her money, though her nose 
like a 
lighthouse does shine. 
Some say that she spends it for whiskey, but of course it's 
no business of mine. 
(
Repeat.) 
Perhaps the song you have just heard you do not think 
is worthy of praise, 
On the safe side my friends I 
have erred, for a laugh I 
have but tried to raise. 
If you're pleased I 
will sing you another if you call on me 
sonic other time, 
If not pleased, my advice to you is, of course it's no bue-i-
XleSS of mine. 
WAIT TILL THE CASH RUNS DRY. 
AIR.—' Wait till the clouds roll by.” 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
PEOPLE who laugh so loudly 
At all your jokes with glee, 
Gail you a 
splendid fellow, 
Ask you up home to tea, 
Mothers that introduce daughters, 
Tailors that smile as you pass by, 
How these will strangely alter— 
Wait till your cash runs dry ! 
C110111S. 
Wait till your cash runs dry, neighbor, 
Wait till your cash runs dry; 
If you would know your true friends, 
Wait till your cash runs dry. 
Policeman on the corner 
Will eye you very queer, 
Champagne will be a 
stranger, 
Water you'll sip for beer; 
Girls that once thought, you charming 
When heaps of caramels you'd buy, 
How they will turn their nose up— 
Wait till your cash runs dry ! 
Wait till your cash runs dry, etc. 
Mothers-in-law detest you, 
And wives oft pout and scold, 
Par- tenders look suspicious, 
Give you the shoulder cold ! 
Folks won't, have time to chatter, 
-When you approach they'll quickly fly; 
Vaybe you don't believe me— 
Wait till your cash runs dry! 
Wait till your cash runs dry, ctc.

On the street, on the horse car, 
Wide awake or in bed, 
You hear this expression— 
" 
That's what I 
said." 
When I 
go on a 
bender 
I 
think I 
can tight, 
But I 
was sadly mistaken 
Last Wednesday night; 
He made a 
football 
Out of my poor soft head; 
Says I, " Please don't kill me." 
He says, " 
That's what I 
said." 
"All, that's what I 
iiaid," etc. 
I 
once courted a 
lady, 
She callell tile her pet, 
And my lust dollar 
From me she did get; 
But vhen my cash was gone 
I 
found her love was dead. 
I 
asked her why she shook me, 
She says, " 
That's what I

AN EVERY DAY OCCURRENCE. 
By D. F. 
M ORETON, Sung by JOHN SHEEHAN, of Sheehan and Coyne , 
in their side-splitting sketch, " An Every Day Occurrence, or 
Who Owns the Alley ? " 
SINCE I 
moved to Grogan's Alley 
I 
am always in a 
mess ; 
The gang kick off my liver pad, 
And the buttons of my vest. 
I'm tough, and try to stand it, 
But really it's no use ; 
I 
must reside up town again ; 
I 
can't stand the gang's abuse. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis an every day occurrence 
For the cops my head to smash ; 
'Tis an every day occurrence 
For my wife myself to thrash ; 
'Tis an every day occurrence 
To build a 
French Flat on my head 
Faith ! only I 
am live and kicking, 
Long ago I 
would be dead. 
When I 
walk down through the alley, 
The gang call me a 
Mick; 
Here's my neighbor Mrs. Driscoll, 
'Pon my sowl she makes me sick ! 
She's an arm like a 
derrick ; 
Her look would stop a 
train ; 
Her tongue is like an earthquake, 
And gives me hydrosterics on the brain. 
'Tis an every day occurrence, etc.

MARY SIMPSON . 
Written by Jos. PETTINGILL of " American Four," and sung nightly 
by them. 
OH, there is a 
little yaller gal, 
Her name is Mary Simpson, 
She's sweet and neat, 
My brain she set all in a 
whirl; 
I 
asked her to marry, 
I 
couldn't tarry: 
"Go wa3., 
you crazy nigger, 
Don't take me fo: a 
fool." (
Break.) 
CHORUS. 
Oh my! my love she is a 
yaller gal, 
Oh my ! I 
tell you she is sweet, 
Oh my ! I 
love her to distraction, 
Pretty little darling, with her big flat feet. 
I 
took her to a 
fancy ball, 
In the dance she was the worst of all ; 
She slipped and kicked, 
And fell flat upon the floor ; 
She up with her foot 
And kicked me in the jaw; 
Then there was a 
fight 
Which busted up the ball. 
Oh my! my love, etc.

CHARMING LITTLE PEARL. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words and music by ED. C. 
SMITH. 
Sung by JOE RICHMOND and ADA CLIFTON. 
Music Published by NEWHALL & 
Co., Cincinnati, Ohio. 
I 
KNOW a 
little maiden fair to see, 
Laughing, dancing, happy, gay and free; 
She lives within a 
cottage close beside a 
brook, 
Where the flowers bud and blossom. 
Eyes dark as midnIolit, joyous little elf ; 
Her hair it bangs in golden curls, 
She knows no care or sorrow, is happy as can be, 
Is my charming little Pearl. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, she is my darling little treasure; 
My brain gets in a 
whirl. 
Not one on earth can equal 
My charming little Pearl. 
Every eve at twilight, about the hour of eight, 
I 
stroll towards that cottage garden gate; 
There I 
meet my loved one in that Cupid's bower, 
With a 
smile of welcome on her face. 
I 
know she loves me true, that no one can deny, 
And in time will be my little wife. 
In that little cottage where the morning-glory climbs, 
We're going to settle down for life. 
. Yes, she is my darling, etc.

I'm such an unfortunate fellow, 
in nothing can I 
e'er succeiA, 
I 
never can do what I 
want to, 
It seems very cruel indeed ; 
I 
go into big speculations, 
And do all the business I 
can, 
But from morning ' tilt night, there's nothing goes 
right, 
I'm such an unfortunate man. 
such an unfortunate man, 
I've tried every possible plan, 
But from morning ' till night, there's nothing 
goes right, 
I'm such an unfortunate man. 
I've tried many things in my travels, 
But nothing will come in my way, 
I'd take a 
political offer, 
Or work for ten dollars a 
day ; 
I 
married a 
lady laQt winter, 
But soon to regret I 
began, 
For her money I 
went, but she hadn't a 
cent— 
I'm such an unfortunate man. 
Cno.—I'm such, etc. 
I 
sigh for a 
good situation, 
But no luck wherever I 
go, 
I 
was born on the first day of April, 
And why I

don't know; 
Fm full of ideas and inventions, 
All languages I 
understand, 
But I 
live on .free lunch, and cold water punch— 
I'm such an unfortunate man. 
CHO. — I'm such, etc. 
In the lottery I 
have invested, 
But always a 
blank I 
would draw, 
At home I 
am always in trouble, 
I'm crushed by my mother-in-law ; 
In life for me there is no pleasure, 
To gain it I 
do all I 
can, 
But there's nothing but woe, wherever I 
go, 
I'm such an unfortunate man.

GLISTENING MOONBEAMS. 
Words and Music by W ALLY W EST. 
W HEN the silvery moonbeams glisten 
Upon the lake's calm breast, 
Will my darling nightly listen, 
As, waking from her rest, 
She hears her lover's serenade 
Ring o'er the waters blue ? 
Its melody entrancing 
Tells her he still is true. 
(Symp.) He's true (symp.) to you ; 
Oh, then my darling waken, 
Sweet girl whom I 
adore, 
And whisper that you will be true 
Unto me evermore. 
Waken thou, oh, fairest maid, (symp.) 
List unto my serenade. (
synzp.) 
Oh, waken from thy dreaming, 
Thy lover sings to thee, 
Now while the moonlight's gleaming, 
Come thou, my love, to me. 
The night stars faintly glimmer, 
The birds have sunk to rest, 
r 
Tile moonbeam's golden shimmer 
Upon the water's breast 
Fades into night beside the love 
Which lights my breast for thee ; 
So while their brightness gleams above, 
Come thou, my love, to me. 
Tie's true (symp.) to you. (symp) 
Waken, thou, oh, fairest maid, eto.

BABY'S GOT A CRAMP. 
A parody by D. F. MonErox, sung by the great Ethiopian burlesque 
singer, PAUL DnEssr.n. 
I'm the father of a 
cross-eyed kid, 
Who nearly drives me wild; 
His mother spanks the rod and spares the kid, 
And the baby now is spiled. 
He can squall like fifty torn cats; 
You can hear him in the sky ; 
And every night when I 
come home 
My wife will loudly cry: 
CHORUS. 
Paul, dear ! Paul, dear ! just think, the little scamp, 
Paul, dear! 
Paul, dear! be chewed the kitchen 
lamp! 
Don't fool 'round in that strange manner, 
Do skin after Doctor Tanner ; 
Get the stomach-pump from Hanner, 
Baby's got a 
cramp. 
On the kitchen stove last Sunday 
This kid did take a 
seat ; 
His underclothes were blistered 
By the very torrid heat. 
He keeps bawling and a 
squalling, 
And at night when I 
should_ doze, 
My darling wife will wake me up 
To wipe the baby's nose. 
Paul, dear ! Paul, etc. 
Dear Paul ! dear Paul ! my wifey will begin ; 
Dear Paul I 
dear Paul ! to sleep now is a 
sin 
Get the goose grease in the castor ; 
Run around a 
little faster ; 
Please do get a 
mustard piaster, 
And we 
off the baby's chin.

W E got a

The number on the door is one hundred and forty-four 
And the place we've not forgot, 
'Tis Master Johnson's birthday, and the nigs have got,

We'll sing and dance with hearts so light, 
While the band does sweetly play. 
When we go out to promenade we . make the white folks 
smile, 
Arm- in-arm we go along, you bet we put on style, 
Down on the green where we'll be seen, we'll make the 
leather shake, 
Hand in hand ! we lead them all a 
walking for the cake. 
Put on style, Cloey Primrose, I'll do just as I 
please, 
Put on style, Cloey Primrose, and we'll dance here on

A LOCK OF HAIR. 
Written by Gus WILLIAMS. 
IN 
the soft and falling twilight of a 
weary, weary (lay, 
I 
was in a 
garret, searching an oh l 
bureau, stored away; 
It for years had been there hidden safe away from frost and 
dew, 
And my curious nature tempted me to search it through and 
through. 
Faded pink and yellow ribbons, laces, half a 
century old, 
And I 
came across a 
package, bound up with a 
thread of gold. 
Something told me to untie it, which I 
did both then and 
there, 
And unfolded to my vision lay a 
simple lock of hair. 
Oh ! what menCries crowded o'er me as I 
gazed upon that 
curl— 
How it brought to me remembrance of a 
young and lovely girl; 
One who was my pride and pleasure— one, who tho' dead and 
gone, 
Clanged in; life from joy and gladness to a 
being old and worn. 
slowly I 
rebound the package, and the tears came down like 
rain, 
As I 
tenderly replaced it where for ages it had lain ; 
Strange how such things do atlect us, make our spirits sadly 
droop, 
But how mad that hair would make us— if we found it in our 
$oup.
