Introductions 
00:00:33 
Sarah describes her family's culture around food when she was growing up. Soon 
after getting married in Korea, her parents came to the United States around 1970. 
Sarah is the youngest of three kids. Her sister was born in 1970, her brother in 
1971, and Sarah in 1979. At that point, her parents had been in the States a 
lot 
longer than when her siblings were growing up. They had also moved up 
economically. Her dad was a 
doctor, and when they first came here, he was just 
getting started. They were living on the East Coast in New Jersey, so her brother 
and sister had some formative years there. Her mom learned to speak English by 
watching Sesame Street with them, which was a 
very different scenario than when 
Sarah came along. By then, they had moved to Michigan and were much better 
off financially. 
Sarah thinks that the culture of food in America had shifted a 
lot in the decade 
between her siblings' births and her own. There are many stories around food that 
weren't from her childhood, but that Sarah heard growing up. Many of these 
stories were from her parents' first few years in the United States when they were 
living in an apartment in Hackensack, New Jersey. She heard about there not 
being garlic at the grocery store, and about her mom acquiring coveted gochujang 
from neighbors and friends. 
Sarah's mom grew up in Korea with people cooking for her. When she and 
Sarah's dad came to the U.S., not only was the food landscape totally different, 
but she also didn't have a 
lot of cooking experience. She knew how to boil an egg 
and boil a 
potato. She would send Sarah's dad to work with a 
boiled potato and a 
boiled egg while he was doing his residency. After a 
week of the egg-and-potato

diet, he needed a 
change. Because he had been in the army and had to cook for 
himself at times, he knew more about cooking and taught Sarah's mom how to 
make certain things. 
After reaching a 
point where they couldn't beg Gerber Baby jars of gochujang off 
of the neighbor anymore, they made a 
Greyhound bus pilgrimage to New York's 
Koreatown to stock up on core supplies. Some shipments also came from family 
in Korea. Those are the vivid stories Sarah has around food. 
After her dad finished residency, they moved to Michigan where Sarah grew up in 
a 
suburb of Detroit. By the time she has memories of her childhood in the 1980s, 
she always remembers there being Korean food around. There weren't H 
Marts or 
things like that, but there were local mom and pop-run Korean grocery stores. 
They were in neighboring suburbs, but she doesn't remember a 
time where there 
wasn't access to Korean food. 
By the time she was growing up, there was a 
hybrid of American and Korean 
food. However, Korean food was the "real" food. It's not that they didn't have 
sugary American cereals and things like that around, but in terms of the main 
meals, it was always Korean food. When non-Korean people meet Sarah's family, 
they always wonder how they eat so much. As soon as her family comes home 
from eating an American lunch, everyone wants to know where the real food is. 
Sarah has many memories of growing up in Michigan. At the time, the way to 
take a 
local vacation was to "go up north," which meant to drive north to more 
rural places. That's what Sarah's family would do, but it got whiter and whiter, 
and finding even one Chinese takeout place would become hard. When they were 
in the middle of a 
place that only had a 
Dairy Queen and a 
McDonald's, Sarah's 
mom was notorious for wanting Asian food (just a 
bowl of rice!). Sarah 
remembers them driving around looking for any vaguely Asian-looking place that 
might have vaguely Asian food. They would waste an extra two hours finding it, 
and once they did, her mom would be satisfied. 
They ate dinners together, although her dad worked late hours and didn't 
necessarily make it home in time. Sarah remembers staying up a 
lot, and as a 
small kid, being weirdly fascinated by her dad eating spicy foods that were 
beyond her palate, or things that she perceived as "weird." Sarah specifically 
remembers watching and listening to him eat baby radish kimchi that has a 
really 
loud crunch. Her dad didn't eat during the day at work, so he really savored the 
food when he came home. If Sarah thinks about his relationship to it, she picked 
up on something sacred or ritualistic about it.

He was five and a 
half years older than her mom, and he remembered much more 
from the Korean War than she did. He remembered being hungry and having long 
spans of time when he only had a 
bowl of rice to eat a 
day. If Sarah thinks about it 
now, she can see how his relationship to food was shaped by having experienced 
real scarcity at a 
formative age. 
Sarah grew up in a 
very white area. Within her neighborhood, they lived next to 
an Indian family, and in her school, there was a 
smattering of Asian kids at any 
given time. There were very few, and many times no, Black or Latinx kids. There 
was also a 
sizable Chaldean population and a 
large Jewish population. 
Food culture at school was pretty standard 1980s American fare. When she was 
younger, Sarah remembers bringing a 
thermos of horicha, or roasted barley tea, to 
school. She recalls her lunches getting more and more white as time went on. 
Around first grade, she was being sent to school with leftovers, but then it 
gradually became a 
rotation of bologna, turkey, and tuna sandwiches. 
To this day, Sarah still thinks about the concept of "real" food. She mentions a 
phenomenon that mainstream white culture doesn't know about, which is that 
immigrants and their families are not necessarily longing for access to white 
culture and for white mainstream culture to be their home. There might even be a 
lot of ways in which they feel superior. 
Sarah isn't the best cook, and she would love to know how to make Korean food 
better. She shares what is likely a 
common experience: when trying to ask her 
parents how to cook something, they say, "You put a 
little of this, a 
little of that." 
When Sarah does that, it comes out disgusting. However, because it was often her 
role in the kitchen growing up, Sarah is very good at the prep duties. While she 
did a 
lot of the slicing and dicing, her mom would combine it all and get the 
flavors right. 
00:20:27 
Sarah says she was a 
hayseed early on. Growing up, she enjoyed going to her 
Mormon neighbor's hobby farm where she gardened and witnessed livestock 
slaughter. She says the suburbs where she grew up must have been agricultural 
land in the recent past. Her elementary school had old apple trees that still bore 
apples, and there were other remnants of things like that on the school sites. The 
county had a 
farm that they incorporated into the school system, and although she 
only went there two or three times throughout her elementary school years, it was 
formative.

Sarah has dreams about the school farm; it made a 
big impression on her. She 
may have milked a 
cow, and she definitely seeded in a 
dixie cup and planted 
them out later on. She was always drawn to plants. When she was growing 
up, her parents had all ornamental gardens with no food crops or herbs. In 
middle school, she watched Canadian cooking shows and Eliot Coleman and 
Barbara Damrosch's gardening show, Gardening Naturally. She was very into 
that show as a 
seventh grader, and she remembers having a 
strong crush on 
Barbara Damrosch. Sarah still refers back to some of those shows, and she 
uses them for her new farmer training program. 
Starting early in high school, Sarah began planting vegetables in her parents' 
ornamental garden. That also coincided with her coming out at age fifteen. 
Prior to that, she did a 
lot of reading. She read her way through the entire Gay 
and Lesbian and Women's Studies sections at Borders bookstore. Without any 
context, she was reading Audre Lorde, Mary Daly, and more. For a 
while, she 
was a 
vegetarian. When Sarah's mom 
talks about that time period in Sarah's 
life, she says that Sarah had "hard times" as a 
teenager. 
All of those things were very much of a 
piece: getting into gardening, 
vegetarian stuff, animal rights. She didn't have anything clearly parsed, but all 
of these things together - the gayness, the vegetarianism, the desire to garden -
led to her getting a 
job at a 
local health food store when she was sixteen. 
Sarah says this was before Whole Foods, when a 
health food store was a 
weird place. There wasn't local produce yet, but it was all organic. This is 
where Sarah was introduced to organic produce. 
Before Sarah left for college, she took some classes at the University of 
Michigan in Ann Arbor. There was more of a 
small farm scene in Ann Arbor, 
and through a 
food co-op, Sarah found and then was hired at a 
local organic 
farm the summer before she went to college. It was a 
five-acre farm, and they 
sold at a 
variety of places. Sunflower sprouts and wheatgrass were about fifty 
percent of what they grew, in addition to head lettuce and garlic. 
Sarah's explanation for being in Ann Arbor was to take a 
class to prepare for 
college, but in her mind, she was having a 
good time farming. She remembers 
her dad being both mystified and amused by her interest in farming. If Sarah's 
mom had her way, she would never touch dirt. Sarah and her dad, on the other 
hand, would do gardening stuff together, like squishing the Japanese beetles 
on their roses. It was their bonding time and something they would do 
ritually.

She recalls a 
core memory of her dad coming to visit her in Ann Arbor. He 
wanted to see the farm, so around dusk, they drove there and stood together 
admiring the garlic field. The swan-like scapes had a 
powdery sheen and 
looked beautiful in the dusky light. After that, something shifted for Sarah. 
There was something that made sense in that moment between she and her 
dad. With garlic being a 
core Korean crop, he would have seen it growing in 
Korea that way. There's not a 
lot of language around that exchange, since it 
was very sensory. 
Sarah didn't make any particular commitments to farming at that time, 
although she does remember her parents joking (but not really) about needing 
to escort her to college, because they were afraid she would run away to live 
on a 
lesbian separatist farm. Her parents didn't know exactly what kinds of 
words to use around it, but they knew she might end up somewhere other than 
where they wanted her to be. It turns out, eighteen-year-old Sarah knew what 
her interests were very strongly. 
It wasn't super conscious, but she always really liked to grow things. Since 
then, she has always consistently grown things. Some friends of hers from her 
twenties remind her about how she illegally grew in cardboard boxes on the 
roof when they were living in Brooklyn. She was always growing stuff, even 
when she lived in cities. 
00:39:28 
In college, Sarah did some farming at an urban farm in New Haven, 
Connecticut. The project was founded by another Asian undergraduate who 
was a 
few years older than Sarah. The two people Sarah knew who were 
involved with the farm were both Chinese American. The urban farm project 
partnered with a 
local homeless shelter, so there was some workforce 
development around it. Sarah helped out there for two seasons. 
After college, Sarah went to law school. She had been doing activist stuff 
around queer issues, AIDs, and reproductive justice since she could drive. She 
doesn't remember how she ended up doing a 
lot of this work, but says there 
was a 
lot of randomness in how she found these opportunities. 
When Sarah encountered lawyers in those situations, they seemed to be 
effective. Seeing that as one way to be effective in that work was part of 
Sarah's decision to go to law school. The other part was appeasing her 
parents. It was similar to Sarah going to college so her parents would feel 
good. She consolidated her classes into one day a 
week and lived in New York 
with her girlfriend for the rest of the week. There were many ways Sarah 
navigated making her parents happy while also doing her own thing.

Sarah went to law school back at the University of Michigan. Soon into it, she 
got an internship at what was then called The Lesbian and Gay Immigration 
Rights Task Force in New York. They focused on issues facing queer, trans, 
and HIV-positive immigrants. Sarah loved her co-workers and the work. 
Afterwards, she knew she would like to go there. Because they had no money 
to hire her, she found a 
fellowship that paid for her to do work there. 
At that time, Sarah's relationship to growing food was growing kale illegally 
in cardboard boxes on rooftops. After she finished law school, she lived in 
New York for three years or so before moving out of the City to the Hudson 
Valley area. She commuted to the City to work at an organization in the 
Bronx, then called Bronx Aid Services. Sarah worked there for around three 
years offering legal aid-type civil services like eviction defense. Because she 
was living in a 
semi-rural area and had the opportunity to garden again, that 
was the beginning of her return to growing. She would wake up in a 
super 
sleepy, predominantly white town and find herself in a 
busy city setting in the 
Bronx. 
Sarah and her partner moved down to Maryland for her partner's job in 
academia. Sarah figured she would find another law job down there. As she 
looked for jobs, it became clear that there weren't a 
lot of opportunities 
around asylum work. In addition, Sarah's daughter is autistic, and because 
care options for her weren't great, they decided it would be better for Sarah or 
her partner to be at home a 
significant amount of the time. It turned out that 
Sarah loves it, which led to her being the primary person at home. She also 
didn't go back into law, because she couldn't find anything that was flexible 
enough. 
To get out of the house one day a 
week, Sarah started volunteering at a 
farm 
nearby in exchange for a 
CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) bag. She 
jokes that that was the gateway drug back. She remembered how much she 
loved it, and she became a 
part-time worker there and then at other farms. She 
worked her way up to a 
farm management position, and she found herself 
back at the same place she was with law work. She knew she couldn't 
properly parent and put in eighty hours a 
week at a 
farm that's an hour away. 
That's what led her to finding the job she is in now, which is more flexible and 
allows her to work with farmers.

00:53:17 
Sarah has been working in her current position since 2014. She started super 
part-time helping them complete their website. They were a 
very small 
organization at the time, and as they started to grow, she moved into different 
positions. She managed their conference for a 
while, and then this position 
opened up. She didn't anticipate how much she would like working with 
beginning farmers. 
00:54:24 
Sarah has a 
large garden of her own. It is about a 
quarter acre in cultivation. 
She doesn't know why, but she doesn't particularly identify as a 
farmer. She 
definitely identifies more as a 
gardener, even though she's the first person to 
say, "If you want to call yourself a 
farmer, you're a 
farmer." There's literally 
no definition, and she hates the ridiculous conversation around whether urban 
farmers are really farmers. 
Sarah thinks she doesn't identify as a 
farmer because she has worked in 
positions where her salary was contingent on how much she sold, and that's 
definitely not the situation she's in now. She notes that other people who are 
in supportive roles to farmers, especially the ones she likes and admires, still 
tend to do some growing. There are many new techniques that are coming out, 
and although she isn't going to buy the latest equipment, she will experiment 
on her home-scale with stuff that's coming into use. She thinks it helps to 
have some grounding in actually continuing to grow, even at a 
small scale. 
00:56:51 
Sometimes Sarah will put stuff online from her own garden for educational 
purposes, but she wonders who is ever going to find it with the vastness of the 
internet. Mostly when she shares things, it's amongst their closed group of 
beginning farmers. Sometimes she shares things, because she knows that what 
she's seeing is notable. While at a 
local community garden site recently, she 
noticed the progressive growth of wire grass. The parks crew comes in every 
year to disc the plot with a 
tractor. Although the ground is fertile, it's full of 
wire grass. By discing, they're spreading it every year. She took pictures of its 
progressive growth after discing. She also wanted to take close-up shots of the 
Bermuda grass in different forms. 
Sarah Sohn Interview Log, April 14, 2021

Sarah has developed a 
way of approaching the question of scale and 
equipment that are big intimidation factors for a 
lot of people coming into the 
program. She says first of all, tractors and all of the implements and their 
names are not that big of a 
deal. It feels intimidating, and she still feels 
intimidated sometimes, but also, most of the people in the beginning farmers 
class have experience driving a 
car, which is way more dangerous, and if 
they've driven stick, way more complicated than driving a 
tractor. Also, things 
that you would do at the hand-scale have their analogy at the tractor-scale. If 
you can understand what the function is of a 
digging fork, a 
shovel, and a 
hoe 
that's skimming the surface, then all of those things have their tractor 
equivalents. Don't let people consciously or unconsciously try to shame you. 
Anyone can do it, and it's just not that big of a 
deal. Whatever scale you're 
farming at is just as real, but also, that stuff is for you, too, if you want to farm 
at that scale. 
It's about having enough money and having access to the many terms used 
around different tractors. For example, "hydrostatic" just means that it's the 
same as driving an automatic car. Sarah understands the intimidation factor, 
and she says there are lots of things to be proud and snooty about, but access 
to tractor terminology isn't one of them. It's easier for Sarah to do that kind of 
analogical stuff at a 
small scale, because she can tailor it to her own needs. 
Instead of fetishizing the tool, think about what you're trying to do with the 
tool. Otherwise, you're going to end up with a 
lot of expensive equipment 
that's outmoded in five years. Sarah is all for equipment and helping people's 
efficiencies, but she thinks a 
lot of it is consciously or unconsciously having 
these intimidation factors that are related to accessibility and making things 
seem more difficult than they actually are. 
When she talks to her beginning farmers, she tells them that they are all 
already doing stuff that's way more difficult. The stuff that they are all really 
adept at, like interpersonal skills, communication, understanding what would 
make people happy to continue working with them, and understanding and 
being fluent in what their customers might want, is actually hard. You can't 
just pick up a 
book or watch Youtube tutorials. Other people should be 
intimidated by that stuff, because that's only obtained through a 
lot of 
experience and relation. You can't just pick it up. Sarah tells them that they 
can do any of that, and that that stuff is all for them if they want to do it. 
They've got the real goods.

Sarah didn't think a 
ton about her Asian American identity when she was 
farming during high school. At the first farm she worked on before going off 
to college, she remembers the owner giving her Assata Shakur's book. Sarah 
has only ever worked at super small-scale organic farms with a 
lot of lefty-ish 
people. At a 
couple of farms, she was the only person of color, but she was 
definitely looking for other people of color. She's had great experiences 
working on crews with other people of color. 
At some point, Sarah very consciously decided that she wanted to work with 
other Asian farmers and sought out Potomac Vegetable Farms in northern 
Virginia. Hiu Newcomb, the founding matriarch of that farm, is a 
Chinese 
American from Hawaii. Her daughter, Hana, co-runs the farm with her now. 
They were the farm in the organic world that had visibly Asian people at the 
helm, and Sarah really wanted to work with them. 
She worked there one day a 
week for two seasons, and it was totally 
transformational. In the early days, Sarah got to work some with Hiu directly, 
and she felt some sense of home. Sarah and others just started a 
group of 
emergent AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) farmers, and Hiu and 
Hana graciously joined them. 
Knowing that Hiu and Hana are there is really important. It's an orienting 
thing for Sarah knowing that they're part of the constellation that exists. They 
were recently talking about the Grace Lee Boggs quote, 
"The most radical thing I 
ever did was to stay put." In relationship to the 
Newcomb's farm, Sarah says the impact they've had is in many ways less to 
do with particular things they said, and more to do with them being a 
fixture 
in the farming community for close to sixty years. It's interesting to think 
about the number of people who went through that farm and what the impact 
was of having Asian women running it. It feels massive to Sarah.

1:11:43 
In relation to the larger BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, people of color) 
community, Sarah's Asian American identity is very front-of-mind in her role 
as a 
service provider. The farmers she is working with are way ahead of her in 
their analysis and thinking about the fundamental changes that need to happen 
in order to move us collectively into right relationship with land. Sarah thinks 
she can be of service by recognizing that she is in a 
position of power, even as 
she is also experiencing discrimination and marginalization as an Asian 
American person. She knows there's a 
lot of impact she can have, and that has 
been important for her to recognize and take seriously. In the farming world, 
there's a 
lot of identification with powerlessness, even amongst white farmers 
and white farm service providers. Sarah thinks it's important to shift that, and 
she finds that to be a 
place where she can have solidarity with other people of 
color, particularly Black farmers in her area. 
There has always been anti-Asian sentiment, and it's always a 
threat. During 
this time, people that Sarah is supposed to be teaching (other farmers of color) 
have reached out to her to offer support. Farmers are really accustomed to 
providing mutual aid, and there are a 
lot of nonverbal ways of showing up for 
each other. 
There is something about working towards land back, land reparations, and a 
vision where more BIPOC farmers will actually be on land. Sarah feels that 
they could be those fixtures in each others' lives in the way that Potomac 
Vegetable Farms has done with its longevity. It's a 
different depth of solidarity 
that imagines we could do this over the course of our lifetimes. 
With the term "neighbor" in mind, Sarah thinks about how that can be a 
model 
for multi-racial solidarity, especially Black and Asian solidarity. Having 
grown up in Detroit where there's a 
very segregated Black/white dynamic, 
Sarah had to try to figure out where she fit into that as an Asian person. Sarah 
has a 
vision for neighborliness where Black and Asian people don't have to 
reduce and flatten their experiences as being the same, or say that one means 
more than the other. Instead, she envisions them recognizing that they're 
neighbors and bound in that way. Sarah believes the farming community can 
help us get towards that vision. 
1:20:44 
To other people of color who are trying to get into farming, Sarah says: "We 
need you." She understands it's daunting, but she advises trying to find other 
people of color. That is ever more possible, even if you're the only person of 
color where you are. For all of its downsides, Sarah thinks Instagram is great 
as a 
means for connection. Knowing there are people out there, even if you're 
only connected digitally, is significant, but Sarah still wouldn't underestimate 
the alienation you might feel. 
Sarah Sohn Interview Log, April 14, 2021

Sarah also advises trusting your gut. If you interview in a 
super rural, totally 
white area, even if you don't see any blazing red flags, trust your gut if you 
feel uncomfortable. Sarah talks about a 
story that Anita Adalja relayed about 
being the only brown person at one of her first farm jobs. Don't discount or 
dismiss the concerns you might have. There are a 
lot of farms out there, and 
even if it takes a 
while, you have the right to be in a 
learning environment that 
you feel safer in. Trust the internal wisdom you have about that. 
If capital and finances are a 
concern, take advantage to whatever degree you 
can of the free services in your area, but also, know that some of those spaces 
might feel unsafe or gross because of the cultural presumptions in them. Take 
your gut seriously and don't settle for an environment that feels gross. 
1:26:31 
Sarah believes that BIPOC farmers are going to come up with the solutions or 
new ways of thinking and being with the earth that we need. We need you, 
even if you feel like you know nothing. We need you, and we need each other. 
It seems like everyone is farming now, but it's not true. If you feel called to 
this, and it feels right to you, in whatever form that is, do it. There is no real or 
unreal farmer. Whatever way you interface with this is real and necessary, and 
we need you.
