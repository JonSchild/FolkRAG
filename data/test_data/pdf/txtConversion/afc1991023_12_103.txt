TXO1: I begin by asking about Long Point and Loveladies island. 
Joe describes where they are, or were, and says that much of the 
shoreline is washing away. 
Maybe these islands were once part of 
the mainland. 
Says doesn't follow the channel when they (the 
baymen) go down to West Creek, for example, they go through the 
island. 
Remembers three islands that have been washed away. 
Used to have to watch for them, now it doesn't matter. 
Shore has 
been washing away, moved way in. 
In 1920s started a development, 
Bay Haven, and now some of the lots are 
in the bay. 
In Cape May 
several years ago was speaking with a man who was searching the 
beach at low tide with a metal detector, and who said that there 
was development there, where the tide comes in today. 
Houses, 
etc. have had to move back inland. 
Joe mentions his sister, who 
lived in Barnegat Light. 
There was a big artesian well there, 
and as a kid, Joe used to go and draw water from it. 
It kept 
moving out further and further, and now it's probably one hundred 
and fifty yards out. 
Would swim out there and find it, water 
coming out of 
it was ice cold. 
I ask what islands, 
like Loveladies, were used for, and ask 
about hunting. 
Joe says used mainly by hunters for duck hunting, 
and they cut hay on some of the bigger ones years ago. 
Remembers 
when used to have hay barges, and horses and wagons would be put 
on barges and carried out to 
island where hay would be cut. 
Salt 
hay. 
Every spring they burned it off, and would come up every 
year. 
Nobody cuts it any more. 
Every spring, from G—Forked 
River; 49GT to G—New Gretna; 15GT would see smoke, and they'd be 
burning the whole thing off. 
They used it for packing around 
flowers, for mulch. 
Strawberry growers still use 
it for mulch

says they used it when they put the high 
to protect the freshly laid concrete, to 
because they couldn't stop for bad weath 
built Route 9.

way through in the 1920s 
keep it from freezing, 
er. 
This was when they 
make ropes out of 
it, 
er heard of that. 
Joe 
nes, for purposes Joe 
Joe mentions Herbert Hall, a real estate man, whose father 
and later himself used to hire people to go out in the fields and 
collect vines, holly, laurel, and some of the fall flowers, pine 
cones, etc. 
And they would make wreaths and decorative pieces 
from these items. 
Today this stuff 
is made out of plastic, Joe 
says. 
Remembers that during the Depression lots of people tried 
picking pine cones. 
Says he tried it once, but spent more money 
replacing clothes that he tore 
in the woods than he made picking, 
so he gave 
it up. 
I ask about his whittling when he was young, with red cedar. 
Joe says he did that when he was a teenager. 
He lived up near 
Holly Beach. 
There were only two houses up there, and the 
nearest one to his family's was a mile away. 
At night there 
wasn't much to do, but something like that (whittling). 
Says he 
still has a couple of things that he whittled. 
Used to whittle 
little boats and also made axe handles. 
Would sell them to the 
hardware store 
in Barnegat for forty cents apiece. 
I ask 
if they 
were of white oak. 
Joe says yes. 
Says he would make one a 
night, and make forty cents. 
In those days, he says, forty cents 
and hour wasn't bad pay. 
Laborers were getting about three 
dollars and twenty cents a day. 
If sold them retail, he got 
fifty cents for them. 
The hardware resold them for sixty cents. 
I ask where he got the oak, and joe says that in those days, 
nobody bothered you, you could go out and cut an oak tree, the 
bigger the better. 
You get a tree sixteen to eighteen inches 
across. 
And every two and a half inches you split it to form a 
pie—shaped piece, and each piece would form an axe handle. 
Put 
the belly toward the center, or heart, of the tree, and the 
outside of the tree was the outside of the handle. 
Chopped them 
out with a hatchet, used a spokeshave on them, and scraped with 
glass at the end, a piece of glass, the best thing 
in the world 
to scrape hardwood with. 
Just take a piece of broken glass, snap 
a piece, and one side will shave and the other side won't, 
because there's one sharp side to 
it. 
Then sandpaper it. 
Didn't 
have fancy tools in those days. 
Used glass to get the hollow in 
the handle, to shape 
it where the hand holds it. 
More glass we 
used the less sandpaper had to use, didn't have much money for 
sandpaper in those days. 
I ask where he got the glass from, and 
Joe says there was always broken glass around, broken windows 
from old houses. 
There was an old farmhouse nearby and a couple 
of kids broke all 
the windows out of it, 
so all they had to do 
Carroll--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 2 
was go over and gather it up. 
Could use window panes for 
scraping. 
I ask if thin glass like that wouldn't break. Joe says 
it would dull, but not break. 
Would take piece of glass, put it 
in a bag, and break it 
into small pieces. 
One window pane would 
last them for weeks. 
I ask about white oak, 
if 
it still grows around here. 
Joe 
says 
it would grow, but the developers took most of the land that 
oak was on, has to have a swamp. 
There's a camp for the blind 
nearby, and a family owns land there with beautiful white oak on 
it, 
but they won't sell 
it. 
A developer tried to buy 
it but 
won't sell 
it. 
The developer wants the land, and all 
they would 
do would be bulldoze the oak off and put it 
in a dump or 
something. 
Joe can see their (the landowners' point), they won't 
sell 
the land, don't need the money. 
It's a shame to destroy all 
those beautiful trees. 
I ask why use oak and not another wood. 
Joe says it's the only thing around here they could use that was 
strong, and that wouldn't twist. 
In some places, they use ash, 
and 
in some, hickory. 
But there's no ash here, and not much 
hickory. 
But white oak was prolific around here, you could 
always get it. 
I ask 
if cedar would work as an axe handle. 
Joe says no, 
it 
takes a hardwood. 
I say that I thought cedar was a hardwood, not 
as hard as, say, basswood, but still 
in that class. 
Joe says 
cedar is considered a softwood. 
Oak, maple, ash, hickory, that's 
one class. 
Then spruce, cedar, white pine, that's in another 
class. 
They're softwoods. 
Red cedar is 
in between, not as soft 
as white cedar, and holds together better, doesn't grain off, the 
grain doesn't split off like white cedar. 
Used to have a lot of 
red cedar. 
Was mostly around farms, houses, etc. 
Gradually it 
died off, nobody replanted any. 
And can't get red cedar. 
If get 
it, can't get it sawed anymore. 
Nobody will saw red cedar, 
because it's apt to have nails in 
it. 
Most red cedars were 
around houses, and people tacked clotheslines to them, etc. 
Only 
way you could get it cut would be to give them a deposit, say one 
hundred dollars, 
in case they break the saw. 
I ask if 
it's worth 
bothering with. 
Joe says no, but mentions Sammy (Sam Hunt), who 
has his own saw, and cuts red cedar, the saw is sort of a home 
made affair, not a very good rig. 
Joe says he himself has a 
planer, he buys his wood in the rough and planes it. 
The wood 
that is outside the shop seasoning is all rough. 
Planes it when 
he's ready to use it. 
But seasons better that way, and when you 
plane it 
it looks new. 
Cedar loses a lot of 
its weight when it seasons. 
A cedar 
log 
is almost as heavy as an oak log when it comes out of the 
swamp, 
it has a lot of moisture in 
it. 
But when it dries out 
it's that nice light stuff. 
Beautiful wood, cedar. 
I say yes, 
and 
it smells so nice too. 
I ask 
if Joe has a favorite wood to 
work with. 
He says yes, white cedar's the nicest wood to work 
with. 
For boat work, or anything like that. 
It's the only place 
in the world they use it. 
They use some southern cedar (they in 
Carroll--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 3 
the south, that is), and there's also some 
in New England, but 
most places they use pine and spruce, or some other wood. 
But 
here, Joe says, we think we have to have cedar here for a boat. 
I ask why, wouldn't pine do just as well? 
Joe says pine soaks a 
lot of water, 
it's heavier. 
A boat like the one 
in the shop now 
(a twenty five foot garvey), Joe says, would probably weigh twice 
as much as a cedar boat. 
Because it's heavier to start with and 
it also absorbs water. 
Some of the old boats were built out of 
pine around here, and when you pull them up on the bank, they 
would open up three eights of an 
inch. 
The seams. 
They'd 
shrink, then go back together again when put in water, 
Cedar 
will give and take some, but not nearly as much as 
Sometimes would get gravel stones in opened seams. 
knock them out, otherwise would shut on stones and 
again. 
pine. 
Would have to 
never go tight 
In the old days, just pulled boats up on bank. 
No railways 
or anythings. 
Waited for high tide to haul boat out of water, 
using rollers. 
With power boats, would find deep place with no 
slope and run the boat up. 
I ask about spruce. 
Joe says use it 
up north, but doesn't hold up well 
in warm water, and don't hold 
a nail 
like cedar will. 
Grain 
is more porous. 
Use spruce here 
for house trim, scaffold plank, because light and strong. 
Citgus 
spruce make boat masts out of 
it, 
strong and real 
light. 
Most 
masts now aluminum, but used to use citgus spruce. 
Make masts 
wedge shaped, octagon shaped, and round them off. 
Profession all 
by 
itself. 
Take a long time to make. 
Were stronger than one 
solid piece, wedged, hollow masts. 
Can make a box the size of a 
four by four, 
instead of a solid piece of wood, and won't bend as 
much as solid wood. 
Now most masts are aluminum. Ropes beat on 
them and sound like bell ringing all the time. 
I ask 
if cedar boat handles diffe

I ask about the wood used for tonging handles (a clamming 
implement). 
When Joe was kid, always used yellow pine. 
Now they 
bleed it all for turpentine. 
Only grows in Georgia, as far as he 
knows, and a little bit in North Carolina. 
What they called 
north Carolina pine was used by roofers, and as siding for 
houses. 
But it wasn't yellow pine. 
When you go through Georgia 
you see pine trees with buckets on them. 
They cut a wedge, or V, 
in the pine trees, drive a peg 
in them, and hang a bucket on 
it, 
and 
it drips the sap out of the pine and they convert it to 
turpentine. 
Since it's an evergreen tree and it's a warm 
climate, the sap probably drips all 
the time. 
Because the only 
time he was ever there was winter, and they had the buckets on 
then. 
I ask about time to out trees, that is, when sap 
is down, 
not running. 
Joe says that everyone claims that only time to cut 
is when sap is down, but everyone around here cuts trees in 
winter because that's the normal time to cut wood, 
it's too hot 
in summer. 
Some mills cut year round, but doesn't make much 
difference when it's cut. 
Yellow pine was better than ash because was very stiff, and 
could make handles small. 
Yellow pine is heavy, so couldn't make 
them as thick as mahogany handles. 
Joe had to change his style 
altogether when started using mahogany, because it wouldn't hold 
up, 
it would break if made as thin as yellow pine handles. 
Had 
to make them wider. 
And yellow pine has pitch in 
it, 
so water 
doesn't penetrate. 
Good for boats too, boats used to go outside 
on the water (outside inland or sheltered waters) were of yellow 
pine, because heavier and therefore good outside. 
Cedar can also 
be used for boats that go outside. 
Joe says he used to build 
charter boats, and one that he built in 1948 was just pulled up 
in Point Pleasant. 
He built it as a pleasure boat, but now the 
owner wants to convert it to a net boat, so 
is taking cabin, etc. 
out and he says that the hull 
is just as good today as when it 
went in the water. 
And that was cedar. 
The keel made from a 
local pine, taken from a swamp, and cut a white oak for the stem, 
and the rest was local cedar. 
Didn't dry the pine, because would 
be under water. 
Never use oak 
in a garvey. 
Too heavy, and rots quicker than 
cedar. 
Only use white oak for sprung timbers, for a round—bottom 
boat. 
Cut timbers, rather use douglas fir than oak. 
Back to 
tonging handles, used also to use ash, but can't get it anymore. 
Was good because strong, but was heavy. 
Stiffer than oak, but 
same type of grain. 
Tong handles have to be stiff. 
Have to feel 
the clam, 
it telegraphs the feel right up to you. 
If don't have 
a wood that you can feel them with, don't catch that many clams. 
Different pieces of the same wood will be different. 
In color, 
stiffness, weight. 
Some pieces of mahogany, for example, not 
good for tong handles. 
Joe buys it in the rough, and can't 
always tell 
if 
it will be good. 
Don't know until after you plane 
it. 
Lighter colored wood is best, darker not so good. 
Too light 
no good either, because often they break. 
But Joe can usually 
tell 
if a tong board will be good or not just by picking it up, 
Carroll--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 5 
because he made so many of them. 
I ask about the rakes on bottom of tonging boards. 
Most 
stainless steel, but copper—coated steel 
is better. 
Won't snap, 
stainless may be more brittle, but doesn't know much about metal. 
Some heads are thirty years old, but just put new bars on them. 
The basket is called the heads. 
Iron heads transmit feel better 
than wooden heads. 
Used to use iron, then wood, then back to 
iron. 
Wooden heads don't pick up as much mud as metal heads. 
Will slide over grass, for example, rather than dig it up. 
Used 
to use flat bars, 
instead of round. 
When started using round 
bars, found that they work better in grass than flat bars. 
Don't 
scrape up the grass as bad. 
Don't work in grass in can help it, 
but sometimes will find clams 
in grass and will work the area. 
I 
ask 
if can tell the difference, by feel through the handle, 
between a rock and a clam. 
Joe says yes. 
Don't pick up items 
that are not clams. 
Open tongs and 
let rocks go. 
But very few 
places have any stones in the bay, gravel, but no stones. 
Can 
always tell 
if have a clam. 
I ask 
if oysters in clam beds. 
Joe 
says used to be, but not anymore. 
Won't grow here, nor can they 
survive here. 
Can use tongs for oystering, but only oysters are 
on State beds. 
Oysters on Mullica River. 
Don't like high 
salinity. 
Could buy license to catch oysters down there. 
And 
could take ten percent clams from Mullica River oyster beds. 
Today, can bring up as many clams as you want, bring them up 
right in the same basket. 
With oysters, they plant shells, and 
build up a reef, just of shells, year after year. 
Used longer 
heads for oysters, and a barrel—head, like two half moons. 
And 
on boats have a culling board. 
Oysters grow together in bunches, 
and oystermen would have a little hammer and cull them off. 
Won't find many clams in there, 
in the reef. 
But as you get away 
from the reef, then find clams and single oysters that have 
broken away and gone off. 
That's where Joe mostly worked, 
because he didn't consider himself an oysterman. 
He didn't like 
to gather all 
that junk up and beat it up (cull 
it). 
So 
generally worked out on the sand, and would catch maybe five or 
six bushels of oysters, and three or four thousand clams. 
So 
made more money on clams than on oysters. 
But oystermen would 
catch twenty five or thirty bushels of oysters, 
in on the reef. 
But Joe was a clammer, and what oysters he caught were a bonus.

TXO1: (This is the continuation of the interview begun on PFP83— 
ATC001.) 
I begin by asking about garvey models. 
I ask why Joe made 
them. 
He says just for fun. 
He never used models in 
boatbuilding. 
Wanted to reproduce some of the local boats. 
He 
would like to make one of each of the boats that they use around 
here, and some no 
longer in use. 
Has a guy who will buy all 
he 
makes. 
Takes about two days to make a model garvey. 
Made one 
with cabin, sink, etc. 
But not too good at painting. 
Talk about 
type of paint to use. 
I ask about wood used. 
He says cedar. 
I 
ask will 
it float, and he says yes, has a picture of 
it 
in water. 
There are bunks and everything in this one, and brass steering 
wheel. 
1 ask 
if that is how a garvey pleasure boat would look. 
He says yes. 
Looking here at picture of model boat in water. 
Look through photograph album. 
Joe says he used to build thirty 
six foot charter boats, several of which are still around, on the 
water. 
Look at picture of eleven foot garvey he made for his 
granddaughter. 
Talks about cussom boat he made for customer. 
G—Waretown; 
53GT 
I ask for more info about why he made the models. 
Joe says 
he wanted something else to do besides work. 
When you get old, 
he says, want to go back to your childhood, play a little. 
Building models is fun. 
Same with cranberry scoops. 
Has one 
ordered, but no time to make it. 
I ask 
if 
any garveys he made are special. 
he says those he 
made for himself, to his own specifications. 
He builds to suit 
Carroll--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 7 
customers' needs. For his use, he doesn't build them as wide, 
customers want them wider for chairs, etc. 
But clammers don't 
need them that wide. 
The boat he built for Kenny Oliver is wide, 
but is built that way to accommodate a cabin. 
Also, Kenny's boat 
is o.k. with a cabin because Kenny clams by the raking method, 
which is done off the back of the boat. 
Joe says that if he 
tonged, he wouldn't have any room for a cabin, because you work 
off the sides of the boat, and would have to manipulate the tong 
handles around the cabin, which would be difficult. 
Joe says he 
only built one boat for himself with a cabin, and he took that 
off . 
I say that when clamming, I guess that you have to put up 
with rain and cold, then ask 
if any clammers still feel that way. 
Joe says that most of them have cabins now. 
I ask about number 
of clammers today. 
Joe says quite a few. 
Says it's surprising 
how many young people are clamming. 
Can make one hundred dollars 
a day clamming. 
Young people clam by the treading method. 
Said 
he counted boats along the shore between here and Barnegat, and 
counted eighty seven boats within a mile, all 
of them clamming. 
Says Kenny rakes. 
With rake, clams have to be up near surface, 
because teeth only go so far. 
With tong, 
if feel clam, can go 
back and dig 
it up. 
With rake, can't do that. 
In raking boat 
moves, drifts in the wind, 
in tonging, boat is anchored in place. 
So 
if miss a lam in raking, can't go back and get it. 
If no 
wind, some of them nudge them along with the motor. 
Can also 
push the boat away from you with the rake, then rake, then push, 
etc. Up here, no tide, only wind. 
Down in Beach Haven, have 
tides. 
I ask about garveys that are raked up 
in the back a long 
time ago. 
Joe says that was for pushing, poling, or rowing. 
So 
that when you poled, then stopped, the boat kept moving. 
Old 
sailboats always cut up 
in back to diminish suction. 
With motor, 
boats don't have to be cut up 
in back. 
Steamers are always round 
sterned to eliminate drag, because sit very low 
in water. 
I ask 
why the current boats are raised in front now. 
Joe says sea has 
to go under the bow. 
So raised up 
in front. 
Stem boats cut 
through the water, so not raised in front. 
But garveys ride on 
top, and are therefore good 
in the bay, 
in shallow water. 
I ask about cedar, 
if certain boards are good, certain not. 
Joe says yes, some are hard, and others soft. 
Hard boards can't 
be used. 
Joe says old timers used to call hard cedar boards 
"brasilie," would put them out in the sun, and if curved up, 
would say "brasilie," that board's no good. 
Joe doesn't know 
where expression came from. 
I ask what they used the hard boards 
for. 
Joe says always something could use it for, but not for 
planking. 
I ask how he could tell which boards were hard, and he 
says could tell 
as soon as pick it up. 
Soft boards are lighter, 
and hard boards have a shiny surface. 
Hard boards don't plane 
well, and they split. 
But don't get much hard boards. 
Hard 
boards grow on the uplands. 
They call 
it "junk cedar." 
Carroll--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 8 
Sometimes they get a hard board because it comes with a lot of 
cedar. 
If a guy's cutting a swamp, he won't leave one tree, so 
he'll saw it up and sell 
it to you. 
Then we'll use it for 
something, maybe in a porch floor, and "nail 
it fast so 
it don't 
get away." 
Used to get North Carolina pine roofers, and had to 
be nailed fast right away, or will twist right up 
in the sun. 
I ask about other qualities in cedar. 
Joe says it planes 
good, and holds together good, won't split off. 
In southern 
cedar, or juniper, makes big boards and 
is tough, but can't use 
it on the bottom (of a boat) because it's short—grained, and will 
break off. 
Our cedar has a long grain, and can steam it. 
Every 
night, they'd steam a board up 
in the bow, clamp it, and leave 
it 
over night. 
next morning it'd be shaped. 
If did that with 
southern cedar, next day it'd be broke right in two. 
Didn't know 
that till we started using it. 
So can't beat cedar for boats, 
best wood that grows for boats. 
Cypress not bad, but not like a 
cedar. 
Cedar won't hold nails as good as fir, but holds nails 
very well. 
(At this point a customer comes in to pick up some tong 
handles from Joe, and his voice is heard on the tape. 
I shut off 
here for five minutes or so until Joe completed his transaction 
with the customer.) 
Tape opens again, and we are talking about some of the tools 
in the shop. 
There are some large saws hanging up 
in one corner 
of the shop, and i ask about them. 
Says he doesn't use these, 
doesn't like them. 
Loaned his best saw, a ribbon saw, to a 
friend. 
these are firewood, or Iogwood saws. 
Used to saw all 
our firewood with them, the big wood. 
Small wood handle with an 
axe. 
Use these up north to cut big trees, but mainly use a 
ribbon saw, which is same width all 
the way through. 
Points to saw made with a curve, and says doesn't know why. 
Then points to scythes. 
A brush scythe, for cutting brush, and a 
grass scythe for grass. 
In old days, had a cradle on them, or 
rack, which would catch the hay. 
Talks about how to use 
different scythes, swing grass scythe in a swath, and pull with a 
brush scythe. 
A scythe 
is sharpened, but rough, not smooth like 
a knife blade, because a scythe slides, and needs a rough edge. 
Use a rough stone to sharpen, puts roughness, 
like "teeth" (but 
not teeth) on them. 
Joe says old fellow worked on railroad and 
said that when he was a kid, he was working in a field and said 
to his dad, "This scythe isn't hung right." 
And his father said, 
"Well, hang it yourself." 
So he says "I hung it 
in an apple tree 
and went to work on a railroad." 
Joe says when he was a kid, 
if 
wanted anything cut used a scythe or brush hook and cleared it 
themselves, never got anyone to do 
it for them like they do 
nowadays. 
I ask about sharpness of blades, 
if certain kind of blade 
needs certain kind of edge. 
Joe says no, not in boatbuilding.

Then goes over to hand saws and points out features of the 
blades. 
Different number of teeth per inch for different kinds 
of cuts. 
Eight teeth to an 
inch are for rough cutting, more per 
inch are for finer cuts, as ten per inch. 
(I take several 
pictures of these saws at this point.) 
A ten point is for finish 
work, he says, and an eight point for cutting two by fours. 
(Tape ends at this point. 
I shut the recorder off 
in order to 
take some photographs, and didn't turn it on again during this 
visit.)
