Jake Skeets:  Hi, I’m Jake, and I’ll be reading a poem to you called “Daybreak.” 
 
[Jake Skeets reads “Daybreak”] 
 
JS:  This poem was inspired by Boderra Joe’s poem titled “Handful of Courage.” Boderra 
described morning time as “coral mornings” and that image stuck with me. The simplicity of the 
language conveys this vast phenomena and sacred time for Diné people. My poetry is really 
interested in the idea of land, landscape, and the energy that exists within them. Energy finds 
its way from the land into the language into the poet into the poem and finally into the reader. I 
have so much faith in this energy that I wanted to write poetry where the speaker is not really 
there. Of course, it’s hard to do with the Diné language because the language itself is very 
systematic and precise. However, I came across some simple phrases in Diné that could convey 
these vast fields, landscapes, phenomena, and energies. I normally don’t use Diné in my poems 
but I felt this poem existed or exists in a specific place and space. It’s really a dailyness poem, a 
poem about the everyday, and I think it has gravity because of that.
