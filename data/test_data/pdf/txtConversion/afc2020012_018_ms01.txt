[0:00] AG: Thank you so much for participating in these interviews. Can I ask you to introduce 
yourself? 
  
NP: My name is Norma Patterson, and I am a nurse. I have been a nurse for 31 years, and I have really 
enjoyed being a nurse. I was born July 11th, and I grew up in a small town called Suttles, Alabama, 
where I grew up with a great family, Mom and Dad. I had three brothers and two sisters at the time, but 
then, about 15 years later, my youngest sister was born, which was a surprise. We did not have a whole 
lot growing up. My family, my mom and dad, worked hard to make sure we were fed and clothed and 
had a roof over our heads. But we enjoyed each other. We grew up as a close-knit family. We always 
had fun singing and dancing and just doing things that children do as growing up together. We were 
basically best friends, my sisters and brothers and I. We were all just basically best friends growing up, 
because we lived in a rural area, and so it was just us, basically. And as we got older, we began to, of 
course, branch out and start doing things separately, but mostly we grew up very, very close-knit. My 
parents, they're still living, doing well, have some health issues. They're living in Selma, Alabama now 
with my sister and her husband. And they have been married for about 61 years. And we've just had a 
great, great time, you know. Even though we grew up poor,  we just enjoyed each other's company and 
enjoyed just being a family. And it's just not just us. Well, we grew up with my grandparents. That's how 
they taught us as we were growing up, to love each other and care for each other and watch out for each 
other. And they instilled that in my parents, and that's what my parents instilled into us, to grow up 
loving each other, and taking care of each other. And that's how we just were just close. Right now, 
we're still close. We call each other. If things are going on with one or the other, we all know. One's 
gonna call the other and let them know what's going on if someone's ill, if something's going on that 
everyone needs to know about. But I really enjoyed growing up with my family, because we took a lot 
of family vacations together. We enjoyed family vacations. We'd go to the beach, we've been to the 
mountains. We just enjoy being together. But like I said, as we got older and working, we can't go on 
vacations together like we used to because someone is working and can't go, or something's going on 
where that person can't go. But we normally would take every year a family vacation. And I just can't 
say enough about how I enjoyed my family, my upbringing. Because of the love, it really, really did not 
make it seem like a-- just a bad evil poor-- being poor, because we had so much love in the family. 
  
AG: It sounds like you all are very close. 
  
NP: Very close, and we are still very close. All my brothers and sisters, we are all alive and we've had 
some health issues and things going on, but we just continue to make sure that we stay in contact and 
make sure we're close to each other. 
  
AG: When you were growing up, what kind of jobs did your mom and dad do? 
  
NP: My dad, let's see if I can remember [laughs]. I know he used to drive trucks, food service trucks. 
My mom, she worked for 30 years at what they called a lock company where they made locks for, like, 
Ford cars. She worked there 30 years until she retired. So, they worked hard. They were hard workers. 
My mom had a eighth grade education, but like I tell my sister all the time, my mom should have been a 
doctor or something, 'cause she knows stuff that really-- she can just come up with stuff that really-- if

you're sick, she knows stuff to help you, to make you feel better. If something's broken, she knows how 
to fix it [chuckles]. Same for my dad. He had 11th grade education, but still, that did not let them stop 
them from making sure that we were taken care of. And I'm just happy that I had the family that I had 
and still have family reunions. Every year we used to have a family reunion, and that was really nice 
every year. We love family reunions. As we've gotten older and a lot of the older people in our family 
have died off, we really haven't had family reunions like we used to, because our matriarchs and 
patriarchs have all basically died off. I think my dad right now is the oldest living family member. And I 
think that's what I miss a lot, the fact that the older generation has passed on, and they had so much 
wisdom to impart on us, to pass on to us about family and love and how to be a family. And I really miss 
that. 
  
AG: Norma, I'm wondering, given that strong family background, did you enjoy school growing up? 
  
NP: I excelled in school. I was the salutatorian in my class. I was second in my class. So, chapters or 
subjects, I would have already read the book. I loved school, I loved education, and I still love school. 
My parents always stressed education to us. They didn't have a formal education, but they wanted to 
make sure that each one of us, and all of us have graduated from school and have a high school diploma, 
or have, maybe, a certificate from college or a degree from college. So, they wanted to make sure we all 
finished school, if nothing else, we at least got that high school diploma. So, that's one thing that I was 
inspired by, is just going to school. That was on my mind, getting out of school. When I finished school, 
going to college, just getting a good education. And that's what I focused on. 
  
AG: Where did you attend college? 
  
NP: When I graduated from high school, I went to this small school called Livingston University in 
West Alabama. I stayed there for two years. I thought I wanted to be an occupational therapist at first 
[laughs], but I transferred from there after two years to the University of Alabama in Birmingham. And 
that's where I realized that occupational therapy wasn't what I really wanted, and it was nursing. So, 
that's when I switched my career though, from occupational therapy to nursing, and I got into their 
nursing program. Unfortunately [laughs], I was to the point where I was getting ready to graduate, I 
think I had about one or two more semesters, and I failed. I failed, and it disappointed me because it's 
something I've never done. I always had A's through high school. Even when I went to college, I was 
making A's, and so I was disappointed. So, what I did is I decided to go to the junior college back home 
after that because after you fail, well, have a D [chuckles], which I'm disappointed, because it's 
something I've never wanted. So, I went back to my two-year school and finished and got my associate's 
degree. And after that, I graduated and I worked for a little while at the local hospital, but I was dating 
this guy [laughs]. A year after I graduated, I got married. So, then we moved from Alabama to 
Tennessee. But also, I have to also not forget the fact that, going back, that we was a Christian family 
also. I grew up in the church, and I still am a Christian woman. And I can't leave that out, because that 
was really the root of our family also, as a Christian family. 
  
AG: Absolutely. Do you think that also influences your nursing? 
  
[11:37] NP: Yes, it does. It does. It influences how I talk to my patients, how I treat my patients, how I 
look at them as patients. It does. It has a lot to do with it. I could not have made it through nursing 
school without the Lord. I prayed, and I just made sure I kept God in my life during-- going through

school, because I knew that was the root of my family. And that's where I began, got my beginning, was 
knowing Jesus, knowing God, growing up in a family who stressed the importance of knowing God. 
When I was in college, away from home at UAB, mom and dad was getting ready to send me money, 
but I had already spent all my money. So, I was waiting on money, and I opened my Bible and there was 
money in my Bible. And I said, "It can't be nobody but the Lord." So, I know that God had-- knowing 
God was a big influence in my nursing career and my getting through my nursing career, my nursing 
programs. Because it's not easy. A nursing program is not easy, and I'll let anyone know that. It's hard 
work, a lot of studying, a lot of time. So, you have to be very, very busy all the time studying. So, I 
know. And once I got married, I continued to go to church and serve God. And I had three children, 
three daughters. One, now she's working. She finished high school and she's working. She decided she 
didn't want to pursue college, go to college, so she's working. That's my oldest daughter. My middle 
daughter is currently in Washington, DC. She graduated high school, went to college here at Middle 
Tennessee State University here in Murfreesboro, and got her degree in psychology. Well, she decided 
she always wanted to be a lawyer. Well, first she wanted to be a doctor, but then she decided she wanted 
to be a lawyer. So, she is currently in Washington DC. She's the daughter who's at-- she's at American 
University now pursuing her career in criminology, and she's graduating this semester with her Master's, 
and she's planning to go back. I don't know when, but she want to go back and pursue her law career. So, 
I'm proud of that. And my daughter here who is at home with me, she's currently going to school at 
Middle Tennessee State, and she already has an associate degree in business that she got through a two-
year program. So, she's pursuing her business degree and will be graduating in December. I'm very 
proud of my children. I'm proud of my granddaughter. I also have a ten-year-old granddaughter who I 
have custody of who is the joy of my life. She's constantly coming up with something to say that would 
make you laugh. So, I just feel like, right now, I'm just happy. I'm pleased and I'm happy. My husband 
died from cancer back in 2004, so I have been a widow since then, since 2004, but even with that, I've 
had to pray and get through it with the help of the Lord. So even with that, and I pray constantly for my 
children, that they would do well, and to be okay in life. I still try to keep some of the things in my life I 
was brought up in to pass on to my children, because I want them to know what it means to have a 
family, to love a family full of love. And that's what I try to impart on my children. So, basically, I was a 
single mother raising three girls, because my youngest when my husband died, she was six, and my next 
one, my oldest was 12, and my middle daughter was seven. Well, I have to say, my whole life has been 
centered around a loving family, growing up in a Christian family. Just even with the ups and downs, I 
feel like I've had a good life. I feel like I've had a good life. And even with my nursing, I love it. 31 
years, I love it. I love my patients. 
  
AG: Norma, were you working full time as a nurse while you were raising your three girls on your own? 
  
[17:43] NP: Yes, I was working full time, and I was going to school part-time. And, well I had my sister 
who moved here with me to help me, so I was blessed to have a sister who would come and live with me 
so she could be here with my children when I'm at work. But she worked also, and so we sort of got a 
schedule, routine so someone would be here with my girls. And I was blessed to have my sister to come 
in and help me with that. So, I worked and went to school. Yes [laughs]. It wasn't easy, but it was worth 
it. It was worth it, 'cause with my girls seeing me doing that, they are hard workers. So, I said, "Well," I 
said, "that's something that really has been instilled in them to be hard workers at whatever they do, to 
work hard, and be good." That's something they saw me do. They didn't see me do anything else except 
work and go to school. And I see that in my...

AG: Did you start your career as a nurse with the VA? 
  
NP: I have been in the VA 21 years. I started out in civilian hospital, the local hospital back in 
[unintelligible] Selma for a year before I moved to Tennessee, and I worked at the Middle Tennessee 
Medical Center here for four years. Then I left there and I was working-- I've worked at several nursing 
homes, but I had applied to the VA, but their process takes a while [laughs]. It's amazing how their 
process take a while before the hiring process. Before I got into the VA, was like I had put a application 
in. It was about two or three years later when I was called. So, their hiring process, it takes a while, I 
know [laughs], and I've figured that out since I've been there. It takes some time, because they keep the 
applications on file for a certain length of time, and then, a few years later, they go back and get your 
application and pull it out and say, "Wow! Let's give this person a interview." So, yeah, but they will. 
They will keep those applications and, even if it's two or three years later, they will call you for an 
interview, so I've experienced that personally [chuckles]. But I've been there 20 years, and I have to say 
it's a different, different setting. So, very different, because basically, veterans are a different population. 
And their needs, to me, are different because of the experiences they've had with wars and this post-
traumatic stress disorder, because of things that have happened to them in the war, or even just-- 'Cause 
I've heard some stories that really were not good, you know, of seeing people, your friends, blown up, 
and people next to you, corpses next to you, headless or armless. That's tough, so I really admire anyone 
who has been in the military. Because my sister, she's proud military and her husband are proud 
military, and I have cousins who have made a career and retired from the military. So, giving back to the 
VA, it's a privilege. It's a privilege, for those who have fought to make things safer for us over here in 
the United States. And to [unintelligible] people just not even appreciate that, it's disheartening. It's 
disheartening, because these people have given their lives, and now they're even giving their lives 
because they're having to deal with the stress of what has happened to them. 
  
AG: And you're still working at the VA, right? 
  
NP: Yes, I am. I am. My role is a clinical nurse leader. It's not a staffing role. I work to do process 
improvement, to make sure the staff has what they need to take care of the patients, do a lot of policy 
updates, create policies. So, my role vary. I have to be versatile [laughs], everything. So, basically, it's to 
make sure the staff on the floor is having what they need to take care of the patient. I have been in this 
role for 13 years, so over half of my career has been in this role in the VA, as a clinical nurse leader. 
  
AG: What is your typical week like for you in that job? 
  
NP: My job first starts off with me going in. I do chart audits. I have to audit the charts to make sure the 
staff is documenting properly, because we have what we call our governing body, the Joint Commission, 
who comes in and tells whether or not we are doing things right. So, I have to make sure that the 
charting is right, because they check our charting, make sure that the patients are getting what they need 
on a day-to-day basis, make sure the staff is doing what they need to do to take care of the patients and 
also make sure they are being taken care of on a day-to-day basis, make sure they're not being stressed 
out or falling apart. So, it's basically just trying to make sure everyone is taken care of and that 
everyone's doing what they are supposed to do. My position basically, we have the nurse manager-- the 
clinical nurse leader is like the clinical manager, so basically managing the clinical side of the floor. We 
have a lot of what we call congestive heart failure patients, patients who are having trouble with fluid 
balance as far as keeping their heart pumping. They might have less than 30% of their heart functioning, 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship

which causes them to have shortness of breath, causes them to swell, but we have to try to treat them. 
Basically, what I try to do with our congestive heart failure patients, I try to teach them how to manage 
themselves at home, because that's where it started, self-management. So, I try to work with them, 
which, since COVID, I haven't done a whole lot of that. But I try to work with them to manage their 
heart failure at home by making sure they're eating properly, making sure they're exercising, getting 
some type of exercise, making sure they're not drinking too much fluid, making sure, 'cause most of 
them are on fluid restrictions. So, and a lot of times, congestive heart failure patients come in because 
they're not complying with their diet, or they're not complying with their fluid intake, so, a lot of 
education to the patient is something that's very important to make sure that they're maintaining when 
they go home. Self-management is a biggie for me, 'cause that's something big for me, to teach the 
patient how to take care of themselves when they leave the hospital to go home so they won't keep 
coming back. 'Cause we have what we call 30-day readmissions. Well, if they have to come back, they 
have to come back, but there's something that we have to monitor to make sure they're not coming back 
in 30 days after they leave the hospital. So, making sure they're taking care of themselves at home is 
where is starts, making sure they're able to take care of themselves, they know how to take care of 
themselves. So, a lot of congestive heart failure patients is what we have. We have a lot of patients with 
COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A lot of patients with pulmonary problems, heart 
problems, kidney problems, liver problems. Then we see a lot of patients who come in for alcohol detox, 
which is also another disease that's really awful with veterans, some veterans, because they just can't 
maintain, because they're using alcohol to cover up any hurt or what's going on in their heads from what 
they saw when they were in the military, some things that they just cannot shake. So, they might use 
alcohol to try to cover that up. There are some who have not drank anything, but there's some that just 
can't, and I really had to get a bigger picture of why. Why is this going on? And of course, you hear 
about suicide rates in the VA, 'cause it's the same reason. These things have gone on where they've seen 
things that we haven't seen that they cannot cope with, and they just can't cope with it. Even though the 
VA is working hard to try and deal with this issue, with suicide-- We're working hard, we are. We work 
hard. I'm in there, so I know that they educate us all the time on suicide. We have to do suicide 
refreshers for suicide prevention courses to try to help recognize when a patient is suicidal or potentially 
want to hurt themselves or harm themselves. I know a lot of people out there, they say that the VA is not 
doing anything, but VA, they do. They take it serious. At least I know where I am, they take it very 
serious, because if a patient come in and just mention that, "Hey, I want to harm myself," we on it. We 
on it. That patient is made sure they get that mental health care that they need. We have a psychiatrist 
come and see that patient immediately, 'cause we have psychiatrists on call who would come and see the 
patient immediately. We make sure we put them all one-to-one, so that someone is there watching them 
at all times. We remove things from the room that they could possibly use to harm themselves. So, I 
know that the VA works hard on trying to make sure our veterans are safe when it comes to suicide. But 
there's always-- I don't know. That is something that touches me, that they've been through so much 
torment, to the point where they just can't take living anymore. Also, we have a lot of homeless veterans. 
I have to say we have social workers who work hard, work hard to find our homeless veterans a place to 
stay. We've had homeless veterans come in and the social workers, they definitely work hard. I've 
experienced that with them. Because [begins to cry] some veterans just can't find anywhere to stay, 
either because of things that have happened in their life that they can't-- people just can't tolerate when 
they're around because they can't help it. They can't help it, because of things they've seen. I know that 
our social workers work hard also to make sure they have a place to stay, trying to find them a place to 
stay, because we have a homeless program for our veterans. We have a lot of patients with cirrhosis of 
the liver, hepatitis.

AG: Norma, did you enjoy going into work every day? 
  
[32:24] NP: Yes, I love my job. I love going in and seeing the veterans, working with the veterans. I just 
enjoy my role. That I'm in a role that I can help the veterans, it's really fulfilling. It is. It is. I can't think 
of working anywhere else than at the VA. People say things about the VA, but the VA is a good place to 
work. It's a good place to work. We have a lot of people from the civilian world who are trying to get 
into the VA, and they say, "I can't get in," because there's so many applications until sometimes we can't 
get everybody in. So, yeah, it is a good place to work. Like any other place, it has its ups and downs, but 
it's a good place to work overall. I can't think of anywhere else I would want to work. 
  
AG: What do you think the most challenging part of working at the VA is? 
  
NP: The challenging part to me is when there's a veteran with no family, 'cause we've had that. I've seen 
that, experienced that. I had a veteran, he didn't have any family, but we kept him there and he stayed 
there until he passed away. We have the flag on our unit. We were given his flag, 'cause he didn't have 
any family. That's challenging when you have a veteran with no family, no one to come and see him, no 
one. Just seeing the sadness. That really touched me, just the sadness of having a veteran with no one. 
So, the other part about that is we treat our veterans like family. We treat them like family. Because 
when they come in, we have veterans who don't even want to leave because they say we treat them so 
good, at least on my unit [chuckles]. 'Cause they say we treat 'em so good and they don't want to leave. 
That's challenging to know that you have veterans who are coming in who don't want to leave, because 
somewhere, someone's not treating them right, or somewhere, something's not going right for them, to 
the point where they want to stay in a hospital, in a hospital bed in a hospital room. That's a challenge 
for me, to try and just digest their hurt and pain and what they're going through. 
  
AG: Norma, how do you take care of yourself, given the painful experiences that the veterans share with 
you and your responsibilities in caring for them, and it sounds like you care for them very, very, very 
strongly. You're like their family. How do you take care of yourself and make sure you're able to cope 
with that kind of role? 
  
NP: Well, prayer. I try and make sure I pray [chuckles], and I do my meditation, morning meditation, 
every morning. I just try and get myself prepared mentally by praying. Then I have my sister who I talk 
to. So, basically, it's prayer, prayer, and talking to my family. 
  
AG: Absolutely. And what would you say is the most rewarding part of working with the veterans? 
  
NP: The most rewarding part is just seeing them smile. Because I've [chuckles] gone in their room, and I 
walk in, because I'm a person who would normally walk in, I'm smiling, and it lights their day up. That's 
rewarding to me that I was able to bring a smile to their face and make them feel better just by smiling. 
'Cause before COVID, I would make rounds every day on every veteran and talk to them every day, 
which is something I'm trying to get back to after COVID. But every day, I would talk to them and find 
out how their night was, and to me that seemed to cheer them up, 'cause they felt like, "Well, somebody 
cares." That's very rewarding for me to know that they feel that someone care for them. Again, they feel 
that someone cared enough for them until they don't want to go home [laughs]. They don't want to leave  
our unit. So, that's very rewarding.

AG: Absolutely. I wonder if I could ask a little bit about how things changed with the COVID-19 
pandemic. How did your day-to-day experience change once COVID-19 hit? 
  
[39:01] NP: Well, we have to wear masks. Like I said, I don't make my rounds on my veterans like I 
used to. It's just became where everyone had to adjust from the PPE to just how we even interact with 
each other, 'cause it's six feet apart. That's hard to do on a unit where people are close in proximity, 
trying to stay at a distance when there's a nurse's station and there are computers right next to each other. 
So, but we do have computers on wheels, so you can go down the hall. Well, we even had to educate 
staff from other areas to come and work on our unit, because our unit was the COVID unit for the 
hospital. Our COVID patients came to our unit. We had a designated unit that they had to turn into a 
complete COVID unit with ventilation, make sure they had the negative pressure in rooms. They had to 
have a whole change, I can say that. Because those rooms were designated just for the COVID patients, 
and no one could go through that door, those doors, without the proper PPE. Then everyone has to wear 
a mask, I mean, and then wear goggles, face shields. It just changed the way you even interacted with 
the patient, because you can't go in a room with a patient now without a face shield, without a mask. The 
patients have to wear a mask when they're being transported to and from the unit. Patients have to wear a 
mask if they're going to their appointment. So, it's just trying to get used to making sure you have your 
mask on, because we didn't want to get caught without our masks with the director, 'cause she would 
reprimand us [chuckles]. Because I know, I have forgotten sometimes and I just walk out of my office, 
and I get down [unintelligible] and realize I don't have a mask on. So, I'm having to run back to my 
office to get my mask. So, it took time to really realize that, "Hey, this is serious. You have to wear your 
mask." We've had a lot of COVID patients to come to our unit. Some have done well, and going home, 
but then we have our nursing homes, where once one patient got the COVID virus, Coronavirus, then, of 
course, it would spread to the other patients. So, it was something that would easily spread, and you 
have to be very careful. We've even had some of our staff end up with COVID. So, it changed a lot, 
because here there's something you fighting it and you don't know how to fight it. Here's something here 
you can't even see, and you don't even know how you're gonna get it or where you're gonna get it. You 
just have to keep washing your hands, making sure your hands are washed, making sure you have your 
mask on, making sure you're keeping that safe distance from people. But right now it seems like it's 
trying to come back to a little normal, because we don't have that many COVID patients anymore. So, it 
seems like after the vaccine came out and we started getting the vaccinations, seem like we didn't have 
that many COVID patients anymore. So, I don't know if that means that we're headed to the end of this 
pandemic. I'm hoping it is. But it's still out there, 'cause they have new variants, strands of it. So, you 
don't know where you're going to pick it up at, where it is. So, hopefully these vaccinations, the vaccine, 
will help a lot of people because a lot of people were afraid and fearful. I know I was a little fearful 
because I was like, "How am I gonna go [unintelligible] patients and I got to be covered up with all this 
stuff? They can't even see my face to see who I am.” So, I am hoping that soon we can get back to a 
normal-- might not be a normal normal, but hopefully we can get to some type of normalcy. Because I 
don't think with these different strains, I don't know if we'll ever have a normal lifestyle, but I'm hoping 
the vaccine would make it as normal as possible. 
  
AG: I wonder, are there any lessons that you're taking away from the way that pandemic happened and 
the COVID-19 response?

NP: Well, I think we could have-- It's really hard to say if this was something that could have been 
stopped. Because there were people on ships, I mean on ships, cruise ships, who were coming from 
different places. There were people coming from the areas where this started. So, it would have been 
hard to find out whether or not we would have been able to kinda stop this. I don't know. [unintelligible] 
trying to figure it out. I'm still trying to see could this have been stopped? I don't know. Because there 
were people who were traveling a lot, so there was gonna be a chance that even if it started somewhere 
else, in another country, that eventually, it was gonna come to the United States, 'cause there are a lot of 
people traveling. 'Cause I like the travel myself, so [laughs]. My takeaway with this would be I'm hoping 
it will come to an end soon. I think that it probably could have been a little less-- could have kind of not 
been spread as easily if people would have worn their mask, because there were some people who were 
just reluctant in wearing masks. I think if we would have been wearing the masks like we were supposed 
to, I think maybe it wouldn't have been as bad. But then again, you never can tell. 'Cause I know, I lost 
my sister-in-law to COVID in December. I don't know. I just don't know if there was anything that we 
could have done to stop it. I'm trying to put my finger on it, but I don't know if we could have stopped 
this. I think it's just something that's eventually gonna happen. Even if it was in China, it was eventually 
gonna make its way here. But the rate at which it was spreading was really the concern that I had. 'Cause 
no one knew how they were getting it. There was some people said they were doing everything right, but 
yet they end up having COVID. They were washing their hands, wearing their mask, doing what they 
thought they were supposed to do. So, the take is for me is how is it spreading as rapid as it spread? I 
know coughing and sneezing and talking to people were some of the reasons they said, and even six feet. 
I don't think even if we was six feet of people that would have been a way to stop it. They tested it. If 
you sneeze, it can go farther than that six feet. So, COVID, basically just seeing people scared and afraid 
of something that they had no idea of where it's coming from or how they're gonna get it. Going to the 
store, people wearing gloves because they're afraid they're gonna get COVID from touching something 
in the store. So, it's scary when you don't know. It's very scary when people don't know what something 
is or where it's coming from or how they're gonna get it. 
  
AG: There's so much [unintelligible]. 
  
NP: Yes. Yes. And that's-- 
  
AG: Could I ask you a few questions about the way you think about your career at this point, after more 
than 20 years in nursing? 
  
NP: My career at this point, I'm looking for a happy retirement [laughs]. That's what I'm looking for at 
this point. Right now, I'm looking hopefully at five, six more years. I'm looking to retire, if not sooner, 
'cause I wanna enjoy my retirement. I've seen so many people who retire, the next day they were dead. 
I've had that experience here at the VA, where this lady she retired and the next day they say she was 
dead. I want to be able to live and enjoy, 'cause I like to travel. I like to travel, I wanna do some things. I 
want to be able to stay in bed if I want to [laughs]. I want to be able to get up when I want to. I am ready 
to retire. So, but I enjoy my career, and I think I have been an asset to the VA. Because that's my goal, 
and anything that I do I want to be an asset. I want to make sure that I have left an impression, that, 
"Hey, she did what she was supposed to do to help this facility to grow." I don't want it to be said that I 
never did anything to help make things better, because that's what I want. I want to make things better. I 
don't want to leave an impression that I made things worse than they were when I left. So, I'm looking 
forward to just retiring hopefully in a few years, and just enjoying life.

AG: It sounds like you have earned a very comfortable retirement.  
 
NP: I hope so. 
  
AG: And when you think back, what are some of the things that drew you to nursing as a young nurse, 
that sort of thing that made you choose to be a nurse and stick with it for 20 plus years? 
  
NP: I just loved helping people. I loved working with people and helping people. When I got into 
nursing, I realized, yeah, this is where I'm supposed to be. This is what I'm supposed to be doing. 'Cause 
when I was growing up people were always, "You're gonna be a teacher." I was like, "No, I don't wanna 
be a teacher," you know, 'cause we had a lot of teachers in my family, and then plus I had nurses in my 
family. But once I started working, going to my clinicals and working with patients, and saw that, "Hey, 
I can really help people here," I said, "Yes, this is where I want to be. Yes." 
  
AG: How have you seen the VA change over the thirteen years that you've been in this position, or over 
the course of your career? Have there been big changes that you've noticed, or any changes? 
  
[54:44] NP: Hmm. Well, yeah, they're changing to try and make sure the staff is more engaged, making 
sure the staff voices are heard, and making sure the patients are being heard. We have surveys that we 
send out. They want to make sure that they are trying to build a business that's gonna make sure the 
patients get what they need, and make sure the patients are cared for. I've seen a lot of changes in how 
they've tried to make sure that bullying in the VA is taken care of. No matter what job you go on, there's 
gonna be some bullies, but we're really working hard on that also. They're trying to become what they 
call a high reliability organization, making sure we're doing no harm, making sure that the patients are 
taken care of, make sure the employees are taken care of, making sure that the VA is-- is one of the 
places that people want to work. So, they have been working hard on making sure it's a high reliability 
organization. 
  
AG: Are there any services that you think could be improved or provided that [unintelligible] aren't 
available? 
  
NP: I know they try to make sure that veterans have as much as they can, 'cause they've started-- they've 
started putting community-based outpatient centers in areas to make sure. Veterans in the rural areas, 
making sure that they have access to health care, 'cause there are some veterans who are in rural areas 
who have to drive miles just to get health care. So, that's one thing I would love to see improved, that 
make sure they have access to care, quality care, and not having to go 30, 40, 50, hundreds of miles to 
get there. And that's what they're trying to do with the C-BOCs, the community-based outpatient centers, 
they're trying to do that. But yeah, patients in rural areas. I would love to see better communication, 
ways to communicate, 'cause we're also going to telemedicine, telehealth. So, these patients in rural 
areas can get better care if they had better access to care. Not saying they don't have, but they have to go 
quite a distance, some of the patients in rural areas, quite a distance to get access to care. So, that's 
something I really would like to see worked on. 
  
AG: This is the last question. I wondered, when you think about your history as a nurse or career as a 
nurse, what do you see as your role in providing patient care?

NP: My role in providing patient care. Right now, my role-- Right now in my role is to monitor and 
make sure the patients are being cared for, direct care, to make sure that the people who are doing the 
direct care are doing their job to take care of the patients, but also, I don't feel like I'm to a point where I 
can take care of the-- get out there and take care of the patients. 'Cause I don't mind putting the patient 
on a bedpan. I don't mind cleaning the patient. I don't mind bathing the patient. So, wherever-- if I need 
to get out there and help, I will. I can give them their medications. I've done that. Even in this role, I've 
done that. I've gotten out there and helped take care of the patient, help put 'em on a bedpan, help clean 
'em up. So, every hand-- 
  
AG: Norma, do you supervise other healthcare workers in your current position? 
  
NP: I really supervise, but I'm not in a supervisor-- supervisor role. But the role that I'm in, I do have to 
monitor the care, and make sure the patients are being cared for. That's part of my role, to monitor the 
direct care the patient is receiving. 
  
AG: Thank you so much for your time, Norma. Is there anything you want to add before we conclude? 
  
NP: No, no. I'm just to the point now where I just enjoy the VA. You know, it has its ups and downs like 
anywhere else, but it's a great place to work. Thank you for your time. Thank you for the interview. I've 
never done a podcast, like, a interview, but I always look for different ways to challenge myself. 
Growing up, I was never a talker. I wasn't a big talker, and I still am not, but I try to find ways to 
improve on speaking and talking. I thought this would be a good opportunity. 
  
AG: Thank you so much, Norma. I'm so surprised to hear that you're not a talker, because this has been a 
really wonderful interview and I'm so grateful to you for your time. Thank you.
