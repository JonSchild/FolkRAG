THE GIRL THAT COULDN'T CATCH ON, 
Words by CHARLES DOCKSTADER. 
Sung with great success by Tom W ARFIELD, 
I 
ONCE knew a 
young lady that was nearly crazy 
To become a 
big star on the stage ; 
lier friends thought her pretty, at times she was witty, 
And forty-seven years was her age. 
She wrote a big drama, started out on the road 
With a 
company she thonolit, was quite strong; 
But somehow or other, I 
can't tell you why, 
The poor "girl couldn't " catch on." 
At last in Chicago she met with success— 
The house was well packed every night. 
She was happy once more, as she thought o'er and o'er 
Of the money that gave her delight ; 
But early one morning her manager skipped 
With her cash and her jewelry too. 
On the last car be stood as his coat-tails she viewed, 
But the poor girl, she couldn't " catch on." 
That night the hotel where the troupe was, took fire. 
The guests all ran out in a 
fright. 
The young lady awoke, and through the thick smoke 
At the window she yelled with her might. 
They placed a 
big plank at, her window at once, 
And yelled out, " Slide down, or you're gone." 
She slid, hut alas, in that plank there were spikes. 
So at last, the poor girl, she '' caught On."

THERE was a 
bold young Brigadier, 
Maguiiin was his name ; 
Among all social characters, 
He won desarvin' fame ; 
But now the scenes he made so gay, 
Have lost their life and joy ; 
He's gone away and left us. 
Oh he was a 
dacent boy, 
CHORUS. 
He's gone far away, 
But -where I 
could not say; 
He left the politicians all in sorrow and dismay; 
There's not such a 
man from here to Dublin bay ; 
Maguffin ! Oh, Maguffin ! 
Why did you go away ? 
He wore a 
stand-up collar, 
And a 
necktie made of blue ; 
Likewise a 
handsome black mustache 
With a 
little curlicue ; 
He had an ivory handle 
On his dandy walkin' cane ; 
And a " dicer," smooth and shiny, 
Kept the weather from his brain. 
He's gone tar away, etc.

For jokin' or for fightin% 
Sure he never could be bate ; 
To see him ate roast turkey, 
'Twas a 
pleasure and a 
thrate. 
I 
hear them say he fell in love 
Wid a 
lady named McCann, 
And I 
suppose it's thrue enough, 
For he was a 
ladies' man. 
He's gone far away, etc. 
He was a 
great philosopher, 
Like the Emperor of Brazil ; 
And he never was a 
partner 
In a 
crooked whiskey still; 
He thravelled on his dignity, 
Wherever he might go ; 
And in a 
rough and tumble, 
You can bet he was not slow. 
Ho's gone far away, etc. 
Perhaps he went to Harlem 
To recruit his failing health, 
Or took a 
trip to Washington, 
Where people soon get wealth ; 
Perhaps he went to rusticate 
On some secluded shore ; 
But what's the use o'talkin', 
• 
Sure Maguffiu's here no more. 
He's gone far away, ete:

GIT! 
As sung by CHARLES and LEWIS DOCKSTARER. 
ST-TE was very smart an' she owned a 
cart, 
Her maiden name was Pat; 
Teed, she owned a 
mule an' she went to school, 
She was dumpy, short an' fat. 
Oh, her given name was Jane, 
It was a 
shame, but she was lame, 
She was a 
brakeman on a 
cattle train, 
And her parents all lived in Fort Wayne. 
Oh, I 
asked her for a 
kiss, a 
little kiss, 
And she told me this : 
She whispered like an angel, " Yon travel— 
Now—unaph—phist—you git !” 
Oh ! I 
won her heart, we sold de cart, 
An' we gave away de mule; 
Well, she hemmed and hawed, she cried an' jawed, 
And she said I 
was a 
fool; 
She owned a 
clog that was full of fleas, 
An' on my knees I 
used to tease. 
Seven long years I 
coaxed her to marry, 
But I 
ne'er could her please. 
She would laugh, but she wouldn't cry, 
Wish I 
may die ! well, I 
wouldn't lie— 
Oh! she whispered, " Skip the gutter, young fellow 
Now—unaph—phist—Y0 11 git !" 
IT'S MONEY, AFTER ALL. 
Sung by Tom W AIIFIELD. 
TIIERE are men of all professions whom we meet with every day, 
Let our lives be spent in business or in pleasure, us they may, 
Who profess a 
creed in public which they practice not at all; 
For they all are after money ; so ' tis money, after all. 
The doctor, in his office, sits among his drugs and pills, 
And deals his poison doses out to cure the people's ills ; 
He says he loves to give relief to sufferin,c_, ones who call, 
But he loves to get their money ; so ' Us money, after all. 
The lawyer hangs his shingle out, and asks the public in, 
Ile promises to right their wrongs, their cases all to win ; 
lie says he labors for the good of people, one and all, 
But he charges forty prices; so ' tis money, after all. 
The office-seeker raves about reform, from morn till night, 
And says if he'll elected be, he'll legislate for right ; 
But when he gets to Congress, he's the grandest rogue of all, 
And he gobbles up our money ; so ' tis money, after all. 
Thus in one common class they're grouped, as by my song you 
see, 
No matter what creed they profess, or what their stations he; 
Time merchants, doctors, preachers, lawyers, congressmen and 
all, 
They all are after money ; so 'tis money, after all.

BEHIND THE SCENES.—Concluded 
BEHIND THE SCENES. 
By GEORGEt 110EY. 
NED, you're going to join the profession, I 
hear 
Now, hark to a 
.word of advice, 
From one who was born in a 
theatre, 
knd has lived your short life over twice. 
Pray don't let the tinsel attract you. 
For that, you must know, is the crust, 
To make it look bright to the every-day world, 
While the apple inside is but dust. 
Here, where we stand, is the theatre's back door, 
The play is just over within,— 
What a 
pity it is that some people think 
That door is the portal to sin ; 
And that every poor actress, or actor the same, 
Who toils on the stage for her bread, 
Is an outcast from all that is holy and good, 
And had better by far to be dead. 
But follow me now to that small world within, 
And dodge round the " winos " and the " flats," 
Though i 
take care of your clothes, for it's dusty back here; 
And these stairways are hard ones on hats ; 
So look where you step, mind the numberless traps, 
And shortly I 
think you will say, 
That theatrical life is more than a 
song, 
And an actor's more than mere play. 
Now we stand on the stage, how dreary it looks, 
When stripped of its gorgeous attire ; 
And only this great giant serpent of hose 
In wait for its enemy—fire. 
Look out in the front., where a 
short time ago, 
Sat the audience joyous and gay, 
Now there is nothing but gloom, and the place 
Seems best suited for some ghostly play. 
There, at the back, are crowded the scenes, 
The " throne," you perceive, is but gilt; 
The " palace," but canvas, the exotics rare, 
Are but paper, they never can wilt. 
(I) 
The great chandeliers are let down by a 
rope, 
And the gasman alters the " moon," 
It all may look tine, I 
daresay, from the front, 
Back here the bright picture fades soon. 
Now look at the actors ; first comes the " star," 
While his servant man carries his bag ; 
Next the " Comedian," weary and sick, 
Who can scarcely his limbs with him dr: g ; 
The devil disease claims him for his own, 
As is seen by his fioure so spare, 
And yet as you laughed at him during the play, 
. 
You'd have thought he had never a 
care. 
There goes a 
poor ballet girl just from the stage, 
Though in tatters and rags is she now, 
You never would think that she is the girl 
Who a 
short time ago made a 
bow 
To an audience full of enrapture untold 
At her dancing that neer was surpassed ; 
Her tinsel is changed for that faded plaid shawl 
That protects her fair face from the blast. 
Look there at your feet, that black yawning ditch 
Where you'd think to see spirits appear, 
Is where not long ago the orchestra sat, 
While their music delighted the ear ; 
Now look up above to the "' borders " and " flies," 
Now bear how the echo rebounds ; 
The only thing moving outside of ourselves, 
Is the watchman pursuing his rounds. 
Yes, there is, as you say, a 
much brighter stde, 
For some have grown rich by their art ; 
But I 
don't think there's one who has been on the stages, 
Who would not feel sick at his heart, 
If a 
daughter or son should follow his steps ; 
So, Ned, boy, just take my advice, 
And before you determine to follow this life, 
Remember this scene, and think twice.

GRANDMOTHER'S BIG IT 
PART. 
AIR," Grandmother's Old Arm Chair," by W M. CARROLL. 
My grandmother she at the age of twenty-three 
Was found sitting on my grandfather's clock ; 
Her hair was silvery red, and she never slept in bed, 
And done washing for the babies in our block. 
She never wore the pants, but was good to all the 
tramps, 
. 
And her heart is big as any paving stone. 
When she cashed in her checks they could not find her 
Specs, 
And she left me her brother's old trombone. 
CHORUS. 
How I 
hollered, how I 
swore— 
My last winter's ulster' into rags I 
tore ; 
When the police put me in jail 
There was no one in the city who'd go my bail. 
My cousin who's away got a 
bale of salt- marsh hay, 
But he gave it to a 
man who is not born, 
And poor old Uncle Dan received a 
Cincinnati ham, 
With a 
cross-grained paralytic ear of corn ; 
And there was old Aunt Sallie who _ lives in our dark 
She got a 
yard of second-handed lace, 
And then my brother Ed got a 
loaf of home-made bread, 
Who was never known to wash his dirty face. 
C 
HOEUS. 
Oh such kicking, such a 
time, 
With my sister's husband singing " Baby mine 
Around his neck l'd like to tie a 
rock. 
And smash him in the necktie with my grand-
mother's sock.

MARIA'S YOUNG MAN:

F. 
SHAW. 
MArtix's the pride of the family, 
Her age now is just seventeen, 
Her manner is graceful and winning, 
She's as pretty as ever wi.,s seen. 
She waits on a 
fancy goods counter, 
'Tis there all her failing began, 
And of late she has made the acquaintanc.! 
Of an elegant stylish young man. 
CHORUS. 
His name is Josiah, 
He's after Maria, 
To charm her he tries all he can ; 
He's dressed with great care 
And has nice curly hair, 
Such a 
swell is Maria's young man. 
He takes her out walking on Sunday, 
He wears a 
bouquet in his breast, 
He carries a 
cane in his fingers 
And a 
heavy brass chain in his vest. 
He walks arm in arm with Maria, 
While he carries her book and fan, 
And the poor girl with love's going crazy 
Since she met with this fancy young man. 
His name is Josiah, etc. 
He says that his parents are wealthy, 
With mansions in country and town, 
Maria believes all he tells her 
And thinks him a 
gent of renown ; 
But oh ! he's an awful deceiver, 
He lives on a 
very- bad plan, 
And when she finds out she'll be sorry 
That she met with this charming young man. 
His name is Josiah, etc. 
Now I 
would advise all young ladit-s 
Of high-notioned swells to beware, 
They'll do for a 
dance in the parlor, 
Or a 
stroll in the mid-summer air ; 
They keep as their motto forever : 
Do nothing, but get all you can ; 
They think the world owes them a 
living, 
Just the same as Maria's young man. 
His name is Josiah, etc.

_I TRAMP. 
A RECITATION. 
As recited by CHARLES BURKE, of CAMPBELL & BURKE, with 
great success. 
LEMME Sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to 
you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no 
good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think 
we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
• clothes ; 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose. 
Down in Lehigh Valley me and people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too ; 
Me and my wife and Nellie—Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creature the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? Why, she had a 
dozen—had ' ern from near and 
fur, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger, young, handsome and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no ill ; 
Mother she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's 
will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll 
say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month after we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's 
side, 
with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to 
sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to 
drink. 
Gimme one glass, Camel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the 
Judgment Day.

KIND friends, if you will listen, I 
will try to amuse you; 
I 
wont keep you. long, so your attention please give. 
It's one thing and another that's happened quite lately 
In this great country in which we all live. 
For you know everybody has some sort of hobby, 
Some pet little views of their own to reveal; 
So as its the fashion I'll give you in passing 
The private opinion of Tommy Warfield. 
Politics soon will ruin our country, 
And one thing sure, between me and you, 
if the poor had the money that's spent on electing, 
That would be an act of charity that right men would do. 
It would make many a 
happy one and a 
great name for our 
Nation, 
Many a 
bleeding heart soon then would he healed, 
Politicians don't need it, the rich wouldn't miss it, 
That's the private opinion of Tommy Wartield.

How well do I 
remember, though many years ago, 
I 
journeyed down to Portsmouth, \Nan my mother, you must 
know; 
The ships were in the harbor, with flags and banners dressed, 
And weeping wives and children were waiting with the rest; 
My father was a 
sailor on hoard a 
man- o'- war, 
Who once ao-ain was goin-- to leave us by the shore; 
He kissed our lips at parting, while standing on the quay, 
And as he bade us both good-bye, these word he said to me: 
CHORUS. 
Stick to your Inothe,r, Tom, when I 
am gone, 
Don't let her worry. lad, don't let her mourn : 
Remember dirt site nursed yon when I 
was far away; 
Don't leave your mother \viten her hair turns gray. 
Our hearts were dull and heavy. returning home ae•ain; 
We scarcely spoke a 
w.hispT while riding in the train. 
The journey seeind unending, and leaden was the sky; 
Until we reached the station where home was very nigh; 
The cottage looked so de. ,olate, and vacant was the chair 
In which my father lingered \vhenever he \vas near. 
I 
came and stool by mother. so full of hope and fear; 
She fondled and carressed me, as she whispered through hut' 
tears, 
Stick to your mother, Toni, etc.' 
The time rolled slowly onward, many changes had occurred, 
But of the good ship Victor, for months we had not heard. 
My mother grew so anxious, her cheeks were sad and pale, 
And I 
was very fearful she suddenly would fail. 
One day there came a 
teleo-ram to say the ship was lost; 
She foundered many miles away, when she'd been tempest 
tossed. 
My mother fainted at the news, but when the swoon had fled, 
I 
kissed her as I 
told her of the words my father said— 
Stick to your mother, Tom, etc.

STICK TO YOUR MOTHER, TOM.— Concluded. 
She lingered thro' the summer, but when the frost and snow, 
The bitter winds of winter very quickly laid her low. 
She died in my embraces, with a 
spirit calm and brave, 
And now the weeping willow bends silently o'er her grave. 
I 
often go to see her grave, and keep the verdure green, 
And plant some spotless lilies upon the peaceful scene, 
And feel the the satisfaction of knowing. thonolt she's dead, 
ii tried to do my duty to the words my father said— 
Stick to your mother. Torn, etc.

LIST Wednesday I 
attended a 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and fam'ly of Timothy J. Cosgrove ; 
Kellys, Hogans, and O'Briens, all came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, and try and win 
the stove. 
CHORUM. 
Forward Four, Allaman Left, while the music it did play; 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay. 
I 
never laugh'd so hearty in the course of all my life, 
Looking at Plug McCarthy, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely the raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jump'd ten feet high when sixty four was 
flung; 
O'Brien yell'd out murder, with a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, while raffling for the *stove, 
Forward Four, etc. 
At six o'clock in the morning the raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk and stole away the door ; 
Clancy with a 
bottle, sure he all the windows broke; 
When Cosgrove grabb'd him by the neck, and boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

So now we are here ! we bid good cheer 
To all our new-made friends, 
And sing a 
song, it won't be long, 
And we wish your kind amends. 
We've been here but a 
day or so 
From that Emerald Isle so grand, 
We are the two McGluggens 
From dear old Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
Then sing it aloud and let the people know. 
Give us a 
hold of your hand; 
We are tbe two McGluggens 
From dear old Ireland. 
(Repeat.) 
And now, kind friends, we must away, 
For work now we must try, 
And should good luck fall in our way 
To the Green Isle we will fly. 
It's the country true and noble, 
Where they'd shake us by the hand, 
And bid welcome to the McGluggens 
Back to old Ireland.

THE DUDE. 
Sung by Toss W ARFELD. 
OF 
a 
great curiosity now I 
will Sluff., 
That has lately appeared in our land 
It has puzzled the smartest men that we have 
In naming this object so graild. 
Both lawyers and doctors, and editors too, 
have struggled for days without food, 
And it's finally decreed by men of great eminence, 
That the one proper name is " The Dude." 
citonus. 
It talks, and it walks as if blown by a 
breeze; 
Its pants are so tight it can't bend its knees ; 
If you ldew your breath on it. poor thing. it would freeze— 
Such a 
delicate thing is " The Dude." 
It's a 
brother to what's called a 
La-deldah-dah, 
With the ladies it thinks It's a 
pet ; 
It never goes out when the wind's blowing hard, 
And smokes only a 
mild cigarette. 
It sometimes talks of the dear darling girls, 
Thou711 some it thinks,' 
horribly rude; 
It's " How are you, boys it's remarkably fine," 
Is the language you hear from " The Dude."

I'LL TELL MAMA. 
An origin& song aud chorus by CHAS. H. DUNCAN. 
I 
TOOR my girl one evening out to ramble in the park, 
Just for A 
little lark, I 
kissed her in the dark, 
She pretended not to like it then, and pouted up her lips, 
Then smiled and said, Oh, Charlie, aint this fun. 
She wore her hair in curls, like other charming girls, 
And thrilled me to my very finger tips; 
With her head upon my breast. 
Well, .‘ you all know the 
It was pleasant, for the little game was even. 
CHORUS. 
But sie cautions and be careful with a 
dainty little mist. 
Don -t 
ask her for a 
kiss, but take it, she wont miss 
Fro) i 
out her store of plenty, 
Yet he loudly may scream this : 
" 
GJ 
'
way, you naughty man ; I'll tell ma'ma—I'll tell 
ma' ma. " 
Should you wish a 
girl's affections, do not evor be afraid 
To coax the little maid ; the saucy little jade 
May be angry for the moment, yet you'll win her in th9 
end, 
And laugh to think how easy it was done. 
Should she hang her head and pout 
Call you an ugly lout, don't falter, then, for fortune soon 
will send 
A 
bright, forgiving smile ; if you're patient just a 
while, 
Then you'll find the little game is won. 
But be cautious and be careful, etc.

Come up and asked me if I

And with a

And for the nearest store I 
made a

The man that owned the store he chased Rae quickly, 
And with his fist he hit me in the eye, 
Then I 
told him for to nemt, a, missamashiuna,

Now another loafer standing on the corner, 
Says there's going to be a

You better strap your business to a

And hold on or you will both get blowed away. 
He said he knew a

To carry signs for sixty cents a

And I

For so easy and so gayly she did glides

I'm enraptured, I

By a

She's an oyster pie, she' a 
chicken pie, 
And she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's a 
lemonade, 
She's the pink of perfect sweetness ; 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grapas. 
She is strawberries and cream. 
Oh, yes, she's far too sweet to live, 
Is my lollypop, is my candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I

My pretty Pollywog ; 
I've something very sweet to say, 
My slender Pollywog  
" 
You and I." 
We sat by the river, you and I, 
In the sweet summer time long ago; 
So smoothly the water glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow. 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river as it wandered on, 
And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alone. 
And oh—

When the Turks are Going to Drill." 
What means this bugle calling, 
The drums all beating loud ; 
The banners they are waving,

We cannot keep them still; 
We know it now, we hear them say, 
The Turks are going to drill.

In marching, sure, the prize we take, you bet.

THE RISING POLITICIAN. 
Written and sung by BARRE BENNETT. 
GOOD evening to ye all, 
I've come to make a 
call, 
And tell ye of my victory 
Upon election day. 
I 
ran for alderman, 
And Murphy was the man 
Who tried hard to defeat me, 
But he gave himself away ; 
He never tried repeatin', 
And that's the way I 
beat him— 
I 
voted seven times myself 
In the ould Fourth Ward so gay. 
CHORUS. 
Now I'm a 
politician, 
I 
hold a 
high position 
I 
gained by repetition 
Upon election day. 
I 
took the gang around 
Where the free lunch could be found, 
And many 's the plate of soup, my boys, 
Did they put out of sight; 
We swept the district clean, 
And the divil such a 
scene 
Was known in New York city, boys, 
Upon election night; 
Cigar signs, barrels, boards we burned 
When the victory it was earned 
It gave me satisfaction and 
It filled me wid delight. 
Now I'm a 
politician, etc. 
And now I'll tell to you 
What I 
am going to do; 
I'll not forget the workingmen, 
To them I 
will be true ; 
They shall have eight hours a 
day, 
And a 
fair amount of pay, 
And live as well as those big bugs 
Upon Fifth Avenue ; 
Sure I'll improve the city, 
For I 
think it is a 
pity 
That poor men should be starving 
When there's public work to do. 
cnoncs. 
So let ye all be merry, 
And don't ye vote contrary. 
And I 
will show ye, one and all, 
What an Irishman can do.

drive a 
coach— 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho ! Whoa, ho! 
My love to Bridget Flynn did broach— 
Whoa, ho, Mare I 
Whoa! Whoa, ho ! 
But sure she wants to wear the pants ; she likes her beer, 
And every day when I'm away she acts so queer, 
Will wink her eye at passers-by, so devilish sly, 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! 
Whoa ! Whoa, ho! 
CHORUS. 
A hackman's wife from flirting should be free 
Whoa, ho ! such games wont do for me; 
A 
hackman's wife a 
hackman's star should he— 
Her poker makes me stars to see. 
The other night an awful sight— 
Whoa, Mare ! 
Whoa ! Whoa, ho ! 
Did cause poor Dennis's heart to blight— 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! 
Whoa! Whoa, ho ! 
I 
loud did yelp for aid and help, but I 
was beat; 
I 
saw a 
man as off he ran, way down the street. 
He left his coat, the scheming bloat, on it was wrote, 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho ! 
A 
hackman's wife, etc. 
I 
couldn't stand like Gideon's Band— 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! 
Whoa ! Whoa, ho ! Whoa, ho ! 
Came all the blackguards in the land, 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! 
Whoa ! Whoa, ho! 
So I'm again a 
single man, as you can see ; 
Untied the band, no partner plan would do for me. 
I've sold my coach, and Biddy Roach. 
is in the lurch ; 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa ! Whoa, ho ! 
A 
hackman's wife, ete.

BANJO SOLO. 
Written by CHAS. DRICKWOOD. 
Sung by Tom Wentrur.Ln 
W ELL, here we are before you, 
My o!d banjo and me ; 
We're right direct from Africa, 
We come through C. 0. D. 
My name is Pompey Julius, 
My banjo's name is Sal; 
I 
love her as I 
do my life, 
You bet I 
always shall. 
Then hear the old strings rattle ; 
I 
love to hear her prattle; 
Some love one kind of music, 
Sonic would another choose, 
But there's nothing like the banjo, 
To drive away the " blues." 
The other day a 
friend came up, 
And unto me he said, 
" 
I've got the hypochondria, 
I 
wish that I 
were dead;" 
I 
just took down the banjo, 
From its accustomed place, 
I 
played him up a 
jig or two, 
He laughed all o'er his face. 
Then hear the old, etc. 
So, kind friends, do your level best . 
To di ive dull care away ; 
You only have one life to live, 
Be happy while :‘ ou may; 
Howsoinever, should you ever 
Get to feeling solemncholy, 
Just call on Pompey Julius, 
And he'll cure you up, by Golly ! 
Then hear the old, etc,

DARLING LIT PLE HARRY. 
I'm in love, I'm ashamed to confess it, 
For the wretch of a 
fellow is here ; 
My heart, if he chose to possess it, 
I 
surrender without any fear. 
But then, oh he treats me so coldly, 
And flirts, too, whenever he can. 
No matter what people have told me, 
I'm in love with the horrible man. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, darling little Harry is the man I'd like to marry, 
But make him out I 
really never can ; 
He is so fascinating I 
really almost hate him, 
For he is such a 
handsome little man. 
While others betray their devotion, 
And carry their hearts to my feet, 
He shows not the slightest emotion, 
Nor utters a 
word that is sweet. 
He knows very well that I 
like him, 
He knows he has stolen my heart. 
How happy I'd be could I 
strike him, 
That is, in the tenderest part. - 
Yes, darling little Harry, ets. 
Sometimes I 
have thought he was trying 
My love just to put to the test, 
And then it is no use denying, 
My hand he has oftentimes pressed. 
It really is very distressing, 
For my heart on the fellow is set ; 
I'm sure he will soon come confessing, 
I 
know I 
shall conquer him yet. 
- 
Yes, darling little Harry, eta.

OF 
all the pleasant ways to spend a 
charming summer 
night, 
The nicest is to take a 
sail 'neath Luna's melting light. 
The other eve I 
asked my girl, if she with me would go, 
She answered yes, and what we did I 
now will tell to 
you. 
CHORUS. 
We were sailing o'er the lake, the moon in beauty shone, 
The birds all sang with light free hearts, responsive to 
our own. 
Unheeded thus time passed away, till the waves began to 
break, 
Reminding us ' twas time to leave the charming moonlit 
lake. 
Our little bark so lightly rode the white crowned glisten-
ing waves 
Which glowed beneath the pure moonlight, like coral 
from their caves. 
We sang our love songs, and the sound the echoes dicl 
awake, 
We plighted troth that summer night, out on the moonlit 
lake. 
CHORUS. 
We were milling o'er the lake, the moon in beauty shone, 
The birds all sang with light free hearts, responsive to 
our own. 
Unheeded thus time passed away, till the waves began

Reminding us 'twas time to leave the charming moonlit

THE ODORS IN OUR ALLEY. 
Parody on the - popular song, " Sally in Our Alley." As sung 
the 
San Francisco Minstrels. 
THE sweetest spot in this 'ere town, 
N
A, here fragrant breezes rally, 
Old garbage, swill, and cholera— 
You'll find up in our alley. 
The street brigade ne'er ventures near, 
With their broom and shovel " ballet," 
The old soap- fat would knock you flat 
If you came up in our alley. 
CHORUS. 
The offal dock may scent the breeze, 
Or some old limburger jelly, 
An old bone yard or putrid lard 
Is sweet, compared with our alley. 
The Board of Health should surely come, 
And no longer dilly-dally, 
With chloride of lime and carbolic soap, 
To disinfect our alley. 
The smell would kill an old tom cat, 
And I'm sure he'd never rally, 
For in spite of " cops " they empty slops,— 
You can swim up in our alley. 
The offal dock may scent the breeze, etc.

.6rUNNY SIGHTS. 
Vrods by FRANK DUMONT. 
Sling by Tom WARFIELD. 
35 
I'VE got a 
little song to sing, so open wide your ears, 
I'll tell you of the funny sights I've seen these many 
years ; 
I 
saw a 
bullfrog on a 
fence with an elephant playing tag, 
A 
little dog with his tail so short a 
stump tail he couldn't 
wag, 
I 
saw a 
brickbat hit a 
goat with a 
piece of sour krout, 
I 
saw an egg that hatched a 
mule on a 
spittoon inside out, 
I 
saw enough to make me laugh when I 
saw a 
greenback 
dollar 
Take home a 
drunken pair of boots and a 
policeman by 
the collar. 
Perhaps you think I 
haven't seen a 
hair-pin ride a 
horse, 
Or see it steamboat go ashore to drink benzine, of course. 
I 
seen a 
camel chase a 
ilea up a 
sour apple tree, 
And play draw poker with an owl so old he couldn't see. 
I 
seen it hog whose head was bald, around his head he 
wore a 
wreath, 
I 
saw a 
bedbug dressed in red with a 
bran new set of 
teeth, 
I 
saw a 
cart wheel in a 
mince pie, and a 
man who never 
wakes, 
And when I 
drank some old benzine I 
saw a 
thousand 
snakes. 
I 
saw a 
sardine smoke a 
pipe, and a 
wash-tub go to bed, 
I 
saw a 
donkey with boxing-gloves standing on his head, 
A. dish cloth drink a 
pail of 
milk, and a 
lobster that would 
not die, 
A 
butterfly with real blonde hair, a 
rat with a 
glass eye. 
I 
seen a 
mosquito kill a 
hog by stepping on his ear, 
I 
seen a 
whale take a 
bath in a 
penny glass of beer, 
But the funniest thing I 
ever sa,w, I 
remember it to this 
day, 
Was a 
grasshopper without any teeth chewing a 
bale of 
bay.

GOD KNOWS WHAT WE'LL DO BEFORE WE 
DIE. 
Written by CHAS. A. SAVILLE. 
Dedicated to my friend BILLY TENNYSON. 
As new songs are very rare, I've a 
new one here prepared, 
I 
hope it will not fail to please you all. 
My subject it is new, as I'll quickly prove to you. 
Your attention for a 
moment I 
will call. 
How often do we meet an outcast on the street, 
And with a 
scornful glance we pass him by. 
Let us give to him a 
hand, and remember he's a 
man, 
For God knows what we'll do before we die. 
How often do we meet an outcast on the street, 
Perhaps she was the sunlight of her home, 
Perhaps a 
mother's love smiles on her from above, 
But now as a 
poor outcast she must roam, 
For, alas, the tempter came, and left on her a 
stain, 
Then left her in her sorrow for to die. 
Let's try every little plan to reclaim her if we can, 
For God knows what we'll do before we die. 
How often do we meet a 
poor drunkard on the street, 
And with a 
scornful glance we pass him by ; 
Is there not one pitying eye for this wretch as he goes 
by ? 
The public call him nothing but a 
vag; 
Perhaps he'd ground and gold ere rum had got its hold ; 
Who knows but in society he moved high. ?' 
Lets us give to him a 
hand, and remember he's a 
man, 
For God knows what we'll do before we die. 
In conclusion now I 
pray you take heed to what I 
say, 
And upon a 
poor unfortunate do not frown, 
But try every little plan to assist them if you can, 
For God knows how they suffer when they're down. 
Let us try with all our might to always do what's right, 
For we're not hid from God's all-seeing eye. 
Let's give too them a 
hand and keep them if we can, 
For God knows what we'll do before we die.

BRIGHT tresses of golden hair twining 
O'er cheeks that are crimson and whiii;\ 
With blue eyes so roguishly shining, 
Like stars of the sweet summer night , 
The dimpled white fingers are strayuy 
To gently be clasped in our own, 
While loving hearts ever are saying, 
Another sweet face in our home. 
CHORUS. 
Another sweet face in the cradle, 
One more in our sunny household, 
Whose coming we joyfully welcome— 
Another sweet face in the fold. 
From heaven a 
radiant blessing, 
Our little one to us was sent ; 
For kissing and tender caressing, 
A 
jewel from Paradise sent ; 
We call her our dear little fairy, 
None better 'neath heaven's blue dome ; 
Oh ! long in our fold may she tarry, 
This sweet little blossom of home. 
Another sweet face, etc. 
Yes, she is the daintiest lassie 
Of all that we cherish and love ; 
With laughter so gleeful and merry, 
And voice like the coo of a

1Vlierever her footsteps shall roian ; 
Our last and our best little treasure,

RACHEL, THE PRIDE OF THE BALLET. 
Written and sung by DAVE HOWARD. 
M Y 
name it is Solomon Cohn, 
I 
keep a 
large clothing store, 
And a 
daughter I've got—only one— 
And she's got my whole body sore. 
She goes to the show every night, 
No longer this I 
will stand, sir, 
If I 
say anything to her, she'll say, 
" 
I'm a 
great ballet dancer." 
On the stage her name is Schlimosky, 
Her right name is Rachel Schlivensky ; 
She comes home every night, and bully blind tight, 
With a 
pair of black eyes she's a 
terrible sight; 
She. is my only daughter, she drinks nothing but Croton 
water. 
She's got a 
big nose, you could hang on your clothes, 
And the pride of the ballet is Rachel. 
She's going to get married next week. 
To a 
handsome song-and-dance actor, 
And he says he'll make her look sweet 
When she's a 
good ballet dancer. 
He'll make her go around on her toes, 
Over in Niblo's Theater ; 
But she's got such a 
terrible nose, 
I 
don't think the managers will take her. 
On the stage her name, etc.

BEECHER'S BREAD AND WATER PLAN. 
Sowg dedicated to die workin;,r men of our country, by T. C. 
Ain.- - What the Old Cocksparrow Said." 
I 
SAT me down to rest and read the other (lay, 
And judge of my amazement and surprise, 
In glancing at the news, I 
was stricken with dismay, 
When a 
paragraph appeared before my eyes, 
In which the moral preacher, the sanctimonious Beecher, • 
Avows that each and every workingman 
Are only fit to die, because they will not try 
To live upon the bread and water plan. 
I 
hung my head with shame, a 
tear unbidden came, 
Great God! I 
cried, is this American, 
Must we toil with hand and brain, in sunshine and in rain 
To be fed upon the bread and water plan ? 
Net many years ago, in our broad and fruitful land, 
Such sentiments as Beecher's would not pass ; 
But look around you now, and you'll find on every hand 
A 
purse-proud and aristocratic class. 
Go up to Central Park, some evening just at dark, 
The stockholder sits behind his blooded span, 
Yet we must not stop to think, or a 
glass of beer to drink, 
But be fed upon the bread and water plan. 
Why don't they hang a 
bone upon a 
telephone ? 
Since feeding now by " culture" they've began, 
With a 
smell three times a 
day, I'm sure we'd feel 0. K., 
And it's cheaper than the bread and water plan. 
Now Henry Ward declares, education's thrown away, 
If bread will not sustains us in this life ; 
In short, he'd have us live on three meals of it a 
day, 
And on it feed six children and a 
wife, 
And soon ' twill come to pass, they'll feed us on blue glass, 
Since science is a 
never- failing cure, 
And true inwardness and gush, ragged edge and Ply-
mouth slush, 
Will satisfy our wants and keep us pure ; 
Hallelujah ! let us pray, give praise each night and day, 
The time has come when every workman 
May bid farewell to care, and live on sumptuous fare, 
With Brother Beecher's bread and water plan.

Mount your mustang and come with me ; Bonita, don't

Do not look distrusCul at me, believe me, I'm no knave ; 
We met beneath the flash of lights in the gay fandango.

BONITA, DON'T SAY NO.—Concluded. 
My Texan cabin is of logs and stands by flowing .stream, 
Shaded from the burning sun by branches ever green ; 
Mustangs in plenty you can ride, where'er you choose 
to go; 
Come kiss me, senorita fair ; Bonita, don't say no. 
Come kiss me, senorita fair ; Bonita, don't say no. 
CHORUS. 
I'll range no more the chapparals or the plains ' gainst the 
Indian foe ; 
Tear off my spurs with tinkling bells; Bonita, don't say 
no! 
The sweet scents from magnolias shall hover in the air, 
Mockingbird's songs and rippling streams shall drive 
away all care ; 
Then fly with me from the Rio Grande, put trust in 
" 
Texas Joe," 
Or my heart will break, my darling; Bonita, don't say 
no! 
Or my heart will break, my darling; Bonita, don't say 
no. 
CHORUS. 
I'll range no more the chapparals or the plains 'gainst the 
Indian foe ; 
Tear off my spurs with tinkling bells ; Bonita, don't say 
no! 
Bonita is the pet name addressed to any senorita you do not 
know the real name of, on the Rio Grande, and means in English 
pretty girl. 
The long rowelled Mexican spurs used by Texans 
also have little bells attached that tinkle as they ride.

DIABOLICAL STORY. 
Originally gung by BILLY CARTER 
Ir you'll listen with your ears, 
For a 
couple of million years, 
A diabolical story I 
will tell ; 
It s 
about a 
female girl 
With red teeth and curly hair, 
And I 
loved her till my head began to swell. 
Her name was Susan Glue, 
And the grub she used to chew, 
She was a 
night clerk in a 
foundry over town 
She'd an alabaster claw, 
And a 
double breasted jaw, 
And every bunion on her feet weighed a 
pound, 
One day she gave me the shake, 
And I 
thought my heart would break, 
When I 
heard she was playing Hamlet en the stage ; 
She stole eleven or twenty dollars, 
And a 
lot of paper collars, 
And eloped with a 
bummer twice her age 
As a 
singer she is vile, 
And she hasn't got no style, 
And they'll kill her if she ever tries to dance. 
Oh, she stole my summer clothes, 
And I 
was nearly froze, 
And her bummer wears my bran new Sunday pants, 
If I 
ever meet her feller, 
I 
will bust him in the smeller, 
I 
am certain he will find an early grave; 
I 
will split his ugly tongue, 
And I'll kick him in the lung, 
With an Indian club his whiskers I 
will shave. 
I 
will sling a 
bottle of ink, 
And destroy Miss Susan Glue, 
And gently drop her in the nearest sewer. 
I 
will drink a 
kidney stew, 
And I'll skip to Kalamazoo, 
For Jimmy Fresh be never went back on the poor. 
ANYTHING." 
I'VE got a 
song called " Anything," and if you'll lend your ear, 
I'll try and sing it to you ; ' tis sure your heart to cheer ; 
It's about a 
horse, a 
dog, a 
cat, a 
man, a 
boy, a 
baby, 
A 
sealskin sacque, a 
pretty girl, and other topics, maybe ; 
Always chew your own tobacco, never norrow, lend or steal, 
Always make your mush and milk, of milk and Injin-meal; 
Always treat the ladies kindly, never kiss them on the sly, 
Big pig, little pig, root, hog, or die. 
A 
horse that trots in " two-eighteen" is no mean thing to drive, 
And an English pug, led by a 
string, is just " too sweet to 
live;" 
A 
cat that sings the tenor, in a 
back-yard opera-bouffe, 
Brings a 
man out with a 
boot-jack to chuck down from the roof; 
A 
boy with a 
slender appetite would surely be a 
sight, 
And a 
baby to be a 
thing of joy must soundly sleep at night ; 
A 
sealskin sacque will never make a 
pretty girl of a 
guy, 
Big pig, little pig, root, hog, or die. 
Adam was a 
Dutchman, and so was Eve, too ; 
They sold lager beer on Sunday, and paddled their own canoe; 
Cain killed his brother Abel, but be wasn't put in jail; 
Jonah was a 
fisherman, he swallowed up a 
whale. 
Dar's a 
hop-toad in de garden, teasing bumble bees; 
A 
nigger in de wood- pile, with a 
toothpick stabbing fleas; 
De hornet's on de grindstone sharpening up his sting, 
And I'm breaking up my jaw for you, a-singing anything.

When other lips and other hearts, 
Their tales of love shall tell, 
In language whose excess imparts 
The power they feel so well. 
There may, perhaps, in such a

Some recollection be, 
Of days that have as happy been, 
Then you'll remember  
"

First she would and then she wouldn't, 
Then she could and then she couldn't, 
Then she should and then she shouldn't,

THE ROLLER SKATING RINK. 
Words and Music by IKE BROWSE. 
The music of this song is published by W. A. 
EVANS & Bno., 50 Brom-
field st., Boston, Mass. 
Price 40 cents. 
Sensations now are all the rage, the latest agitating 
The public mind, is how to know the art of roller skating. 
Peopie forget they have a 
trade to earn their bread and butter, 
If you mention business, they of skates will only flintier. 
II 
is worse than epizootic, whooping cough or bilious colic, 
This acarleinic, epidemic, roller skating dude. 
If to a 
fricnd upon the street you say, " Come up my way," 
The chances are he'll turn about quite suddenly and say— 
cnoRus. 
I 
thank you, but then I 
think 
I'd prefer to go down to the rink, 
Where society belles and jolly young swells 
Are giving each other the wink; 
Where the flirt and the 
masher king," 
And tin- dude, that queer little thing, 
Can I.)e seen any time, for the sum of a 
dime, 
At the roller skating rink. 
The other eve. I 
went to call upon it darling creature, 
When there I 
met, to my surprise, that roller skating teacher. 
He'd been to call upon my girl, and they were just, debating 
The question of a 
little whirl that night at roller skating. 
I 
sought no introduction, I 
was a 
trifle rude, 
For I 
hated tins conceited, brainless, roller skating dude. 
I 
asked my girl if she that night to the play would like to go, 
She blushed and smiled upon us both, but answered very low, 
I 
thank you, but then I 
think, etc. 
The moral of this business you can very plainly see, 
if you want to •' catch on " readily, a 
skater you must be; 
Among the girls you are N. G., and never will be trusted, 
Until you've given ample proof that all your bonus are busted; 
And if the very pinnacle of fame you'd like to reach, 
Take my advice, a 
ml quickly learn in skating how to teach. 
Like a 
magnet you will surely draw, the girls to you will fly, - 
To other invitations they will ott-r this reply— 
I 
thank you, but then 1 
think, etc.

Sung by To

I 
HEATt 
de music playing 
As I 
come down de street, 
It reminds me of a 
colored band 
That used to play so sweet; 
Every member was a 
coon, 
And popular airs they played; 
You ought to hear de music, 
At a 
dance, or on parade. 
Turn, turn, turn, the cornet went, 
Played by Jimmie Riddle. 
Zume, zume, zume, de old trombone, 
Johnson played de fiddle. 
Tute, tube, tute, the clarinet, 
Played by Jones' wife. 
Music on de fife. 
When de band begins to play, 
Then the people march away; 
Hear the foolish wenches say, 
Watch them coons, give- them room, 
Dey ain't got long to stay. 
Jones' wife am tall and black, 
And seven feet she stands; 
She wants to be the leader 
Of that awful colored band. 
She plays the drum and cymbals, 
Most beautiful to see ; 
Her eyes are red, and the wig on her head 
Was built in " forty-three." 
Turn, turn, turn, etc. 
THE COLORED BAND .— Concluded. 
One evening in de summer, 
' They went out to serenade ; 
They 'roused de folks for miles around 
With the discords that they made. 
The police came to stop de row, 
They thought there was a 
fight. 
That colored band marched hand in band 
To the station-house that night.

THE HARD-BACK FAMILY. 
Written awl, composed by EDWIN FRENCH. 
Music sent by us to any address. 
Price, 
cents. 
Copyright, 1879, by Louis P. GOULLAUD. 
As sung by Ilaverly's Georgia Minstrels. 
I WENT to see my girl one night, 
She was there when I 
arrived ; 
I'm getting along fast in love, you bet, 
It is a 
great surprise. 
I 
asked her for her coal-black hand, 
Be mine forevermore, 
I 
tell you the family flew at me, 
And chased me from de door. 
I'm going away to leave you, 
I 
can't stop on de way ; 
Clear de track and don't pester me, 
For I 
can no longer stay. 
CHORUS. 
I'll drive the gospel engine, 
I'll drive her through the land ; 
Swing on the golden chariot, 
In that far off happy land. 
(Dance.) 
I 
took my love to de engine house, 
To see de fire machine, 
Her hair flew back on de top of her head, 
She looked like a 
Dutch May queen. 
Her dress was white, and her smile was bright. 
Her figure gaunt and lean ; 
She was brigadier general of a 
market store. 
Sold hammers, turtles and cream. 
I'm going away to leave you, 
I 
can't stop on de way, 
Clear de track, and don't pester me, 
For I 
can no longer stay. 
I'll drive the gospel, etc.

BILLY'S MOTHER-IN-LAW. 
'Written by FRANK DUMONT and sung by BILLY Bincit at the San Fran-
cisco Minstrels' Opera House. 
Winn some one invent or tell of a 
plan 
To get rid of my mother-in-law— 
Some stuff that will kill her as dead as a 
nail— 
I 
won't stand her abuse any more. 
4 
I'm covered with scars and with liniment too, 
And court-plaster's all over my jaw ; 
She'll douse me in a 
tub if I 
dare to resist, 
And she takes me to scrub up the floor. 
CHORUS. 
She's n hunkey old mother-in-law--
She's a " daisy " old mother-in-law ; 
She's the crankiest old " crow " that ever you saw, 
Is the buzzard that Billy calls mother-in-law. 
If home I 
return and the hour is late 
Not a 
word of excuse she will hear, 
But gives me a 
sockdolager right in the eye, 
And bites off a 
chunk of my ear. 
I 
can't give her taffy, no matter holy sweet ; 
Her hand's like the fighter, Jem Mace ; 
Whenever she bits me on top of my nose 
She spreads it all over my face. 
She's a 
hunkey old mother-in-law, etc. 
The house is as hot and as warm as a 
stove 
Whenever she's " bossing " around ; 
She gives me a 
wink, and I 
shut up at once, 
For I 
dare not to utter a 
sound. 
Bullets won't pierce this old crocodile's skin ; 
I'd rather be living in jail ; 
I 
go around town like a 
big yellow dog 
With a 
tin kettle tied to his tail. 
She's a 
hunkey old mother-in-law, etc.

THE BICYCLE CRANK. 
Words and Music by Ii BRON NE . 
The music of this song is published by FAIRBANKS & COLE, 121 Court st., 
Boston, Mass. 
DON'T talk of rapid transit, telephones, electric lights, 
Air navigating., 
roller skating, pugilistic tights; 
He's the darling of the ladies and the envy of the beaux, 
And he calls himself " professor" and a 
terror to his foes. 
The Bicycle lie rides, only once get on his style, 
His act will " knock you silly" with the agony he'll pile. 
He's a 
gay deceiver, Latin heaver from the Harvard rank, 
And he's known to everybody as the great Bicycle Crank. 
ClIORCS. 
" 
What a 
darliw!, oh my!" the ladies they sigh, 
As he rolls round the track on his wheel mounted high. 
What wouldn't I 
he's too sweet to live," 
This dandy, the Bicycle Crank. 
He dreams of bicycles at night, would eat one if he could--
Will talk of nothing else, ' tis said, nor could he if he would. 
The girt who once did love lihn dear will never be his bride; 
Ile shook her in disgust, because she couldn't learn to ride. 
He grew so awful thin his clothes from off him dropped, 
And tho' pursued by every means, he never could be stopped. 
Such a 
dandy, and so handy, with his legs so lean and lank, 
lie's the champion of the universe, this great Bicycle Crank. 
" 
What a 
darling," etc. 
No matter whether on his toes, or balanced on his ear, 
You'll never find him " off his base," nor ever " out of gear," 
And tho' he never " tumbles," you'll always find him " fly," 
And ever ready to " catch on " and " take the cake" or die. 
Tho' his mark he may not make in Congress later on, 
A 
record surely he will leave of ninny trophies won; 
And by the hour, in " whiskey sour," his health will oft be 
drank, 
As the champion of champions, the great Bicycle Crank. 
" 
What a 
darling," etc.

THE GREEN-GABLED CABIN IN THE VALE. 
Dedicated to JAS. B. RADCLIFFE. 
Words by CHAS. R FISHER. 
On, the early part of life, with its glory and its strife. 
Has gone and slowly faded from my gaze ; 
And as I 
toddle 'long, my brain it rushes strong 
With fear and painful tremor in the maze. 
This hairless pate of mine, with rich wool once did shine, 
My sprightly figure showed a 
healthy scale ; 
It was in those times now past, when such happiness was 
cast, 
In the green-gabled cabin in the vale! 
CHORUS. 
So don't spurn this poor old nigger, who was once a 
lively 
jigger, 
Could tune the banjo on a 
cotton bale ; 
Who could sing a 
melody, to a 
young one on his knee. 
In the green-gabled cabin in the vale ! 
In the good, rich Georgia State, where the chains of bon-
dage great, 
Were put by heartless custom to our race ; 
And when the master gruff, would rather give a 
cuff, 
Than speak a 
civil sentence in its place. 
Quite often in the night, I'd shudder at the sight, 
That in my dreams of slavery cast a 
veil ; 
I 
stood whippings by the score, it was for the love I 
bore 
For the green-gabled cabin in the vale. 
So don't spurn, etc. 
But the home where I 
was reared, and the scenes that 
often cheered, 
Are now to shameful ruin without marks 
To tell the joyful spots, where Digs in happy lots, 
Would sing their plaintive ballads with the larks. 
The former days of war have left their trails of gore, 
To trace the horrid facts and tell the tale, 
How the others with myself, took the Bible from the 
shelf 
(SPOKEN. -----To 
pray) 
For the green-gabled cabin in the vale. 
So don't spurn, eta.

As sung by Haverly's Mastodon- Minstrels. 
The Music sent to any address, on receipt of 35 cents, by HEMIT 
J. 
W EHATAN, 50 Chatham street, New York. 
IN 
Scotland's fair land, o'er mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day, 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green, 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coining, but she has not come as 
yet; 
The truth seems to dawn upon me plain ; 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe her true— 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie once 
again • 
They say you are false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
She said she would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain— 
In lands far away she does roam; 
Her promise she will keep ; oh ! break it not, my Jean; • 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh ! then let me not long wait, let me meet thee soon, my 
Jean, 
And the heavens will smile on our love, 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
Oh! Jean, my bonnie Jean, etc.

Price 35 cents. 
YOUTH has gone forever, my darling, 
With its brilliant, sparkling zest ; 
And the days are fast approaching. 
When our dearest joy is rest. 
We have tasted many pleasures, 
And their fragrance lingers yet, 
But I 
mark amid your tresses 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
CHORUS. 
You have worn when life was brightest, 
Roses in your dark hair set ; 
Wear with equal grace, my darling, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have worn when life was brightest, 
Roses in your dark hair set ; 
Wear with equal grace, my darling, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
We have lived, and life was pleasant, 
We have laughed, our mirth was gay ; 
We have sung and danced and flirted, 
As our youth fled fast away. 
But the dance must end, my darling, 
Let it pass without regret ; 
Time has placed his hand upon us, 
Snowy strands among the jet. - 
You have worn, eta. 
Let us not for joys departed, 
Grieve our souls with mournful thought ; 
Truer pleasures are before us, 
If with patient faith they're sought. 
Let us win a 
happy future, 
Nor for past enjoyment fret ; 
Let us wear a 
crown of honor, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have worn, eta. 
THE BEAT/P. 
Originally sung by the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
YOUR attention now we ask for a 
couple of years, 
To a 
story we will relate, 
It's about a 
purty Irish girl we met'while we was walking, 
She was hanging on a 
slaughter-house gate. 
She was as purty and as sweet as a 
cow, 
Such clothes you never did see ; 
She had a 
darling little bonnet with a 
poodle dog upon it. 
She's the Irish girl that winked at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, wasn't she a 
beaute, 
Tra, la le, skip the gutter, the baby's got a 
tooth; 
Wrestling pots, that was her duty, 
And her sister was a 
boarding-house cook. 
My name is Patsey Marley, and the daisies call me 
Charley, 
I'm a 
double-breasted acrobatic Mick; 
My name is Patsey Marley, and the daisies call me 
Charley, 
I'm a 
double-breasted acrobatic Mick. 
The other day we thought we'd take a 
little walk, 
For to try and see the daisy ; 
While walking down the street, by chance we her did 
meet, 
With a 
man about six foot eight. 
Says I, " Excuse me, my dear, 
But isn't your name Arabella ? " 
She hit me such a 
poke that my neck she nearly broke, 
And she knocked me head and heels in a 
cellar. 
Oh, my, wasn't she, etc.
