Introduction 
The efforts of the Hungarian-Americans in transmitting
 
the many aspects of their culture to their children have
 
varied throughout the century, influenced by historical,
 
environmental and personality factors during the years,  but
 
nonetheless conscious, organized work by members of the spo-
radic Hungarian communities sustained.  This conscious trans-
mission of culture still takes on many forms within the
 
communities /festivals, programs, social events, language
 
schools, scout organizations, etc.!, and supplements the
 
pivotal work which goes on in the home, within the structure
 
of the family -
 a phenomenon not readily accessible to field-
workers.  But not only does language maintenance, transmission
 
of knowledge about Hungarian folk art, history, literature
 
and music exist within the home, the second generation's
 
lives seem to be touched on a deeper, unconscious level, to
 
the extent that they soon inadvertently live, think and par-
tially become a part of the parents' culture -
 all within
 
the framework of their lives within the United States.
 For
 
this reason it is essential to take these dynamic movements
 
of ethnic heritage maintenance into account, and view it as
 
an integral and positive force in our society.
 
The topic of this paper will be the most organized
 
form of the conscious transmission of Hungarian culture:
 
the ethnic language school.  Many levels and types of Hun-
garian language instruction exist within the United States:
 
language courses,  Saturday/Sunday schools,  summer instruction,
 
evening courses.
 Specifically, this paper will attempt to
 
outline in short the history and current status of the Hun-
-arian Alum ni Association's Hungarian Saturday Classes lo-
ed in New Brunswick, New Jersey, which is a Saturday school,
 
in its twenty-third year of existence.
 Hungarian instruc-
goes on for thirty-three Saturdays, four hours a week,
 
the Kindergarten, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced
 
'evels to the course in Hungarian as a Foreign Language for
 
English speaking students.

Pioneering Difficulties
  
To place the events preceding the establishment of
 
this Hungarian school in New Brunswick in perspective, we
 
must go back in time to the 1950's, specifically to the
 
S
 
S
 
1956 Hungarian Revolution, which brought 42,0001 Hun-
garian immigrants to the United States, many of whom
 
settled in the New Brunswick area.  During the end of
 
the decade, soon after their arrival, several young Hun-
garian students enrolled at Rutgers University in New
 
Brunswick, and formed the association named Hungarian
 
Students at Rutgers University.
 One of these students was
 
Károly Nagy who soon became one of the founding fathers
 
of the ethnic school in New Brunswick, and who plays a
 
key role in the affairs of the Hungarian-American community
 
to this very day.  Dr. Nagy recalls that "
...towards the
 
end of the decade .
.. jn '
58,  '
59,  '60, we /Hungarian Stu-
dents at Rutgers University/ be
 -  
enough youngsters in...the New E
 :
 
in American schools with sufficient knowledge about their
 
ancestry and heritage, and perhaps our organization ought
 
to do something about that as well..."  /ES82-SN-C6,  I
, 1
, 66-74/.
 
By early 1960, this group of "fifty-sixers"  who
 
"
...considered themselves to be the continuers, the main-
tainers of this revolutionary Hungarian tradition..."
 
/ES82-Sr-C6, I
, 1
, 96-98/,found a need for, and organized
 
a Hungarian school in New Brunswick through their own
 
r
i
 
efforts and through "
...support from the larger non-
university Hun,
,,arian community .
..
 /ES82-SN-C6,  I,  1p 102-104/.

Certainly the most difficult of problems which surfaced
 
at the outset were tne hardships posed by tne complete lack
 
.
 of teaching materials in the United States or elsewhere, de-
signed for t
he unique needs of week-end instruction of the
 
Hungarian language.  These pedagogical difficulties were not
 
overcome until the 1970's.  Dr. Nagy recalls the faculty's
 
experiences:
 "
...We found that nothing was available for
 
once a week teaching methodology, for Hungarian as a Second
 
Language, nor for Hungarian as a First Language, which it
 
was for many of the students who spoke fluent Hungarian,
 
because they were sons and daughters of parents who came out
 
four or five years ago from Hungary .
.. but once a week method-
ology is quite difficult..."  /ES82-SN-C6, I, 1, 153-159/.
 
"
...of course, the material available from Hungary was so
 
filled with propaganda, and was geared...for everyday teach-
ing methodology, it was useless.
 We did two things: we as
 
teachers, on one band, had to put together, search, and find...
 
and create our own teaching material,  including books which
 
were non-existent; on the other hand, we had to start a
 
larger research to see whether there is similar Hungarian
 
instruction anywhere else, outside of Hungary .
.. What we fre-
quently did, was try to purchase, ask, borrow, find, research
 
all sorts of material for Hungarian children from Hungary,
 
as well as anywhere else, and we started to select out of
 
that available pool .
.. photocopying it, writing it out .
.. I
 
remember Schmidt Panni's husband /Béla Schmidt: ES82-SN-
0
 
7
 
S
 
Appendix IX, no. 19/, who draws well .
.. he drew the first
 
S
 
0
 
sheets for teaching the youngsters the alphabet...Schrnidt
 
Panni was using those sheets .
.. she was xeroxing thern...I
 
was also trying to research available material from all
 
sorts of books from my own library, from the library of
 
others, from old textbooks, children's books .
.. I tried to
 
put it together .
.. and by the end of the year we had an aw-
ful lot of material..."  /ES82-SN-C6, I
, 1 223-260/.
 
Naturally, this was only ,a temporary solution for the
 
problem of a lack of systematic materials suited and tailored
 
for this special group of children, having a language pro-
ficiency in Hungarian as diverse as the number of students
 
enrolled in the school.  A much larger, and more comprehen-
sive effort was needed to overcome this unique pedagogical
 
situation.

I
. The School Years Between 1960 and 1967
 
As we look back over the twenty-three years of the
 
existence of the Hungarian Saturday Classes, we can classify
 
the school years into four groups according to the upward or
 
downward mobility of the number of enrolled students.  These
 
figures reflect important changes in the disposition of the
 
Hungarian-American community toward the school, and mirrors
 
the communication between the faculty, staff and the community
 
at large.  The enrollment statistics signal any num ber of
 
occurences, for example an upheaval within the structure of
 
the school board or faculty, such as personal or health
 
problems resulting in the replacement of teachers, directors,
 
or may even indicate a new "administration's" favorable or
 
unfavorable work within the school and community.
 
The first "era" in the history of the Hungarian Saturday
 
Classes is unquestionably characterized by strong upward
 
mobility in the number of registered students /1960: 44 to
 
1966: 116/.  These figures provide a basis for concluding
 
that a marked increase in enrollments suggested that this
 
Hungarian community truly realized the importance of main-
taining a Hungarian school, and the value of systematic
 
transmission of their culture to their children.  The efforts
 
and hard work of the teachers throughout these years must
 
also be taken into account, for their success is an integral
 
part of the success of the entire school.
 
Increased enrollments demanded a change in all aspects
 
9
 
of managing the school, and also modified the curriculum,
 
altered the methodology used by the teachers. Initially,
 
increased enrollments warranted the establishment of new
 
classes and the restructuring of the old ones, which was
 
dictated by the age and language proficiency of the student
 
body.
 By the second year of the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
a new class was opened.
 These accomodations were made each
 
year when a marked change formulated within the student body.
 
The location of the Hungarian school remained basically
 
the same, all the buildings which gave a home to the school
 
were located on the Rutgers campus in New Brunswick.
 The
 
two main buildings used for the longest length of time w
*
-
the Ballantine Building and Frelinghuysen Hall  /ES82-SN
 
l and 2/.
 
C
 
Initiations :
always took place each school year to im-
prove the curriculum and expand the programs offered by the
 
school.
 These initiations were always positive in nature,
 
although few of the programs did not survive along with the
 
school.
 
The first small expansion of the staff took place in
 
the second school year /1961-1962/, when  two lecturers
 
were invited to speak to the history class: Joseph Held and
 
András Kockenstein.
 An organized series of monthly lectures
 
were initiated in the 1963-1964 academic year named Széchenyi
 
Seminar for the students of the Kossuth and Ráicóczi Classes,

twenty-three Hungarian-American schools Nagy located, in one
 
of his articles published in Magyar Hirek, a daily news-
paper in Hungary on November 15, 1965.
 This was to lead to
 
the seed planted in the 1960's which was to bear bittersweet
 
fruit in the 1970's.
 
A four hundred dollar scholarship was also established
 
in the 1963-1964 school year by the Hungarian Alumni Associa-
tion for Hungarian-American students who complete the Hun-
garian Saturday Classes and pursue their university studies
 
at Rutgers or Douglass University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
 
The importance of parent-teacher meetings for the Satur-
day school was realized in the early years, and there were
 
two or three PTA meetings held during a school year.
 The
 
parents were always encouraged to take part in the class-
room instruction and the final examinations to monitor the
 
progress and quality of the material taught to their chil-
dren.
 A good relationship between the children, teachers,
 
parents and the community was always stressed.
 
In the 1964-1965 academic year a major concern surfaced
 
which would be a continuous care for the staff and adminis-
trators of the Hungarian Saturday Classes throughout its
 
history, and this was the realization that the H
inigarian
 
school, now established and flourishing, also needed to be
 
maintained.
 Thus,the problem of student attrition and re-
placements became a central concern for the school and would
 
have to be solved through conscious organizational and man-
agerial efforts.
 The key to solving this difficulty was
 
12
 
perceived to be the kindergarten.  Tnese little ones would
 
potentially become students of the Hungarian school through-
out their youth and replace tne older students who were by
 
now leaving the sciiool.
 By realizing this hardship fairly
 
early in the SChool os history, and remedying the ailment
 
with positive organizational work, the kindergarten re-
ported an increase in tne number of children attending
 
during the 1964-1965 school year.
 
Many of the pedagogical and methodological problems
 
remained as we near the end of the first era of the Hun-
garian Saturday Classes: the lack of adequate teaching
 
materials, the diverse language proficiency of the students,
 
and the lack of time to teach the children all that was con-
siderea pertinent.  Nevertneless, growth, change and positive
 
results characterized the beginning stage of this unique
 
Hu

iI. The School Years Between 1967-1974
  
The second era in the history of the Hungarian Sat-
urday Classes may be described as the crucial years, brought
 
on by the unfortunate medical problems of the members of the z
'
 I
)
t-
administration,  and consequently the number of enrolled chil-
dren dropped from 116 to only.62 'An the 1967-1968,,school
 
year.
 Later a growing opposition within the Hungarian -
 
American community toward the school dwindled the regis-
tered students to 40 by 1974.
 The strength of the school
 
was only maintained for two years during this period in 1968
 
and in 1970, when the students numbered 99 and 109 respective-

folk art in theory and practice.
 Folk motifs were taught
 
to the adult and younger students.
 The various stiches and
 
patterns of embroidery characteristic of various regions of
 
Hungary were also learned by the students.
 
The newly formed Literary Workshop, led by Dr. Károly
 
Nagy, experimented with American and Hungarian poetry trans-
lation /ES82-SN-Appendix X ,  no. 4/.
 
Meanwhile during the late sixties, after the publication
 
of the results of the above mentioned research project in the
 
Slavic Journal /1965/ and several Hungarian journals, Dr. Nagy
 
began organizing his efforts to bring about the badly needed
 
conference of these Hungarian schools.  Dr. Nagy recalls his
 
work at that time:
 "
...I have duplicated this published
 
material and sent it to them  /the other Hungarian-American
 
schools/
 to .
.. organize a get together, a conference of sorts
 
at Rutgers University.  That conference never materialized
 
because of the huge distances that these people would have to
 
travel on their own monies .
.. parallel to that, I have sent
 
this material... to Hungarian leaders...cultural leaders in
 
Hungary whom I knew,  Zoltan Kodály, Mihály Váci and to Gyula
 
Illy s, and they started to respond .
.. First of all, we start-
ed a correspondence with Mihály Váci.
 I sent him all sorts
 
of materials, he encouraged x
ne .
.. but they also started to
 
'ork on the Hungarian.. .academe and professionals.. .because
 
0
 
:5
 
S
 
I proposed to them: why don't they help us organize some
 
kind of conference? .
.. Finally, they have succeeded in push-
ing things so far, that in 1970 the first such conference was
 
organized by a body of Hungarian scholars and officials at
 
Lajos Kossuth University in Debrecen /Hungary/, and at that
 
time this loose organization received the name of "Anyanyelvi
 
Konferencia" -
 Native Language Conference -
 .
..and that or-
ganization exists ever since..."  /ESB2-SN-C6,  I
, 1,  306-330/.
 
In turn opposition within the Hungarian-American communi-
ty "...culminated in 1970 when t
ie first Native Language Con-
ference occurred..."  /ES82-SN-C6, I, 2
, 175-177/.
 In re-
sponse  '
...a counter school  /was established/ which we
 
viewed as a partly desirable state of affairs because in-
stead of having one hungarian school, it is better to have
 
two, no matter who starts  /it/  and why..."  /ES82-SN-C6,
 
2
,  201-204/, explains Nagy.
 
The Native Language Conference took place in -the summer
 
of 1970 and "
...it caught many people .
.. by surprise.  They
 
didn't know quite what to make of it .
.. the idea was new. The
 
idea originated from our school  /the Hungarian Saturday
 
Classes!..."  /ES 2-SN-C6 II, 1
, 316-319/.
 
At the week long conference Dr. Nagy proposed a pro-
gram which included the cooperative writing of Hungarian
 
language textbooks for American students.
 The proposal was
 
accepted, and the hungarian scholars proclaimed that they
 
16
 
EJ
 
ji
 
would writ  the textbooks for the hungarian schools,  '
...to
 
which  /Nagy/  vigorously protested and .
.. barraged them with
 
letters saying that we are just not going to teach those books
 
that will be written by people si tt i n g  at their desks in Buda-
pest.
 What we have to do absolutely is have the textbook
 
writers see the medium, the population .
.. survey the popula-
tion for whom they are writing the textbooks..."  /ES82-SN-C6,
 
II, 1,  377-382/.
 
Dr. .
Nagy in turn provided another proposal on a method
 
of overcoming the hardships of a program such as the one
 
which followed, and soon enough the three textbook writers
 
were here in the United States for two months.
 
They began their work immediately by visiting Hungarian-
American schools in the New Jersey area, inc a
ng the Passaic
 
Catholic S
ool which at that time had everyday Hungarian lan-
ç
 guage instruction.
 They began taping the pronunciation patterns
 
of the children, interviewing parents, teachers and collecting
 
old and current curriculum materials.  The writers also had
 
the opportunity to visit American schools, since it was
 
equally important to witness what the children were exposed
 
to during the week.
 They visited an American public and pri-
vate school interviewing teachers, taking notes and gathering
 
American textbooks to learn more about the methodologies used
 
to teach in this country.
 They went on to visit schools in
 
Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Canada and from there flew back
 
to Budapest to begin working on the Hungarian language text-
books designed for American children. /ES82-SN-C6,  II, 2
,  003-
083/

Back in Budapest the textbook writers began working
 
on the book for intermediate students.  The format had
 
been agreed upon earlier: the textbooks would be accom-
panied by workbooks, cassette tapes, along with teacher's
 
manuals.
 There would initially be  f-eu
-leve
- iat.,j
four
 
sets of teaching materials.
 It had been stressed and agreed
 
upon at the outset that the materials would not contain a
 
bit of propaganda, and in the event that a trace of it would
 
be found in the books, they would be rejected immediately.
 
The most unique and truly difficult phase of the work
 
was the monitoring of the newly written material.
 The text-
book writers sent out their manuscripts chapter by chapter
 
to the Hungarian Saturday Classes.  The material was then
 
taken into the classrooms, put to test with the Hungarian - 
American children, commented on, revised and returned to
 
Budapest through the mail.  This tedious but rewarding task
 
went on for a number of years until the books were comrlet d,
 
then published.
 
The books were put to use £mmeaiately at the Hungarian
 
Saturday Classes.
 The so called "sister school" of the Hun-
garian Saturday Classes, the Passaic Hungarian School /New
 
Jersey/  was also one of the first hungarian -
 American
 
schools to use the books prepared through the joint efforts
 
of Dr. Nagy, the Hungarian School and the Native Language
 
Conference.
 The books today are being used at more and more
 
Hungarian-American schools.

III. The Academic Years Between 1974 and 1980
 
The fifteenth anniversary of the Hungarian Saturday
 
Classes was coupled with the regeneration of the student body,
 
and a revival was sensed within the school.
 The year began
 
with the registration of fifty-four students and closed the
 
anniversary celebration with ninety-nine Hungarian-American
 
youngsters.
 
The positions of Director and Administrator were assumed
 
by Susan and Miklós Cserg6 in the summer of 1974, and they ran
 
the.school until 1980.
 Susan Cserg6 felt that the key to their
 
success during the years was the role of excellent personal re-
lationships between the Hungarian-American community /parents,
 
children and friends/ and the faculty and staff of the school.
 
"
...This is what transformed the school into a micro-community,
 
a large family where everyone felt at home, and felt welcome...
 
the children,  the parents and the teachers .
.. and the way to
 
achieve this was by systematic organizational work through-
out the year....
 /E582-SN-C12, 1, 83-114/.
 
There were new teachers added to the faculty of the
 
schoo L Magda Eszlári /ES82-SN-Cll/, Mr. and Mrs. Somogyi
 
/ES82-SN-Appendix IX, no. 63/, and Melinda Hoffmann /ES62-
SN-Appendix IX, no. 64/ to name only a few.
 The core of the
 
curriculum remained essentially the same, although the necessary
 
adjustments were made to accomodate the expanding classes.
 
Soon enough, the newly written and attractively prepared text-
books were beginning to make their way into the classrooms of
 
19
 
the Hungarian school, making instruction more systematic
 
and efficient, alleviating some of the work of the teachers,
 
and placing well-stuctured, well-written, colorful materials
 
in the hands of Hungarian-American students.
 
These years, which were marked by the cohesion of the
 
Hungarian Saturday Classes with the Hungarian ethnic commu-
nity, brought progressive initiations to the school's pro-
gram.
 The practice of PTA's and teachers' mini-conferences
 
was continued to facilitate the work of the teachers and the
 
school as a whole.  These conferences soon expanded, and in
 
1976 the Hungarian school's faculty held a Teacher Conference
 
at Rutgers University which brought together the teachers of
 
Hungarian  from the East Coast.  The instructors shared their
 
experiences and discussed the many hardships of keeping the
 
Hungarian schools alive, and maintaining the Hungarian lan-
guage.
 /ES82-SK-Appendix Iv, no. 2 and 3/
 
In 1977 the faculty and staff of the Hungarian Saturday
 
Classes visited the Passaic Hungarian School in Passaic, New
 
Jersey  /E382-SN-Appendix VIII, no. 4/ to collectively dis-
cuss pedagogical and methodological difficulties.
 Further-
more,  the third conference of the American Hungarian Educators'
 
Association paid a visit to the Hungarian Saturday Classes in
 
April,  1978.
 Hungarian language teacners from Chicago and
 
Passaic demonstrated their teacning methods to tne faculty
 
in the classrooms of the Hungarian school in New Brunswick.

Not only did the teachers and staff of the Hungarian
 
Saturaay Classes get the opportunity to participate in
 
"extra-curricular" activities, but the students as well
 
took part in field trips visiting Rutgers University's
 
Alexander Library and tne American Hungarian Studies Foun-
dation to do research for their Saturday history class /ES82-
SN-Appendix IX, no. 6 and 7/; the statue of Lajos Kossuth and
 
the grave of  éla Bartok, both in New York, were also on the
 
agenda to be visited  /ES82-SN-Appendix IX, no. 5/.
 The
 
annual PontozO, a folk dance competition held in northern
 
New Jersey, was the place to show off their talents in Hur
.-
garian folk dance.
 The large scale Hungarian Festival at
 
the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey was an
 
elaborate event for all Hungarian-Americans in the area  /ES82-
SN-Appendix IX, no. 48 through 54/.
 These colorful and en-
joyable events all made the concept of going to hungarian
 
scnool much more favorable for the students who gave up a
 
substantial amount of their free time to participate in hun-
garian language instruction.
 
By now, tne Hungarian Saturday Classes of the Hungarian
 
Alumni Association had become very well-known to interested
 
Hungarians throughout the world, bringing professional edu-
cators, poets, writers, historians and journalists into the
 
classrooms to witness ethnic history in the making here in
 
New Brunswick.
 These professionals interested in the main-
0
 
21

tenance of Hungarian heritage and the science of teaching
 
foreign languages came from many points in the United States
 
and Europe.  The impact was much more permanent than ever
 
imagined:
 these writers, poets returned to their homes and
 
homelands and recorded their impressions in novels, articles,
 
poems which some sent back to the hungarian Saturday Classes
 
as a token of their appreciation for the experience they had
 
by visiting the school, and as an expression of respect for
 
the teachers, students and their parents who sacrificed much
 
to maintain their heritage and language in tne United States
 
/ESS2-SN- Appendix V, no. 1 and 2; X, no. 2/.
 
Along with the nard work of learning Hungarian language,
 
literature, history on Saturday mornings, there was
 
room for educational entertainment: the programs put on by
 
the student body in celebration of the Christmas holiday,
 
Mother's Day and the graduation ceremonies.
 Susan Cserg6
 
recalls that this "
...method was not employed before in the
 
Hungarian Saturday Classes to this extent .
.. and was imple-
mented by her husband Miklás Csergô .
.. The students were joy-
ous about the Christmas holiday .
.. and we passed on to them
 
the hungarian spirit of Christmas .
.. This also became cul-
tural education for the whole Hungarian community .
.. Through
 
these programs and plays they  /the parents and friends/ en-
joyed seeing the development and the knowledge of their chil-
dren, and were all happy that the Christmas holiday was cele-
22
 
brated in a family spirit,  bringing back their memories of
 
chilhood.  After the program all the students received a  
little present brought by the .aby Jesus, in Hungary He is
 
the bearer of gifts,...and this concluded the ceremonies..."
 
/E582-SN--C12, 1, 117-147/.
 
One of the teachers who worked with the children for six
 
years in preparing and practicing for these programs was
 
Magda Eszlári.
 She explains the pedagogical benefits of such
 
programs:  t
t .
.. Even though t
he children have to work very hard
 
at overcoming  /linguistic/
 difficulties in preparing for a
 
program,  I feel that it is extremely useful .
.. and even though
 
it takes away much time from formal teaching, that which a
 
child learns at this time will be remenibered,...he has invested
 
more work into  /memorizing his parts!,  especially when he
 
experiences success... and because he is performing in front
 
of an audience, he will remember /the poems, etc.! to a greater
 
extent .
.. There is hungarian school every week, but there are
 
only two -
 three programs a year...
 /ES82-SN-C11, 1
, 134 -  
146/.
 
Several studies and smaller research projects have
 
attempted to survey and record aspects of the phenomenon of
 
the Hungarian ethnic school in the United States.
 A major
 
task was to maintain an active list of Hungarian schools
 
in the country, which in this area was kept up to date by
 
Dr. Károly vagy among others.  /ES82-SN-Appendix viii, no. 1
 
and 2/.
 Later, a comprehensive list was compiled by András
 
S
 
S
 
0
 
Sándor in 19d2 who served as former director of the scnool
 
for a num ber of years  /ES 2-SN-Appendix viii, no. 3/.
 Fur-
thermore, during the fifteenth anniversary year of the Hun-
garian Saturday Classes, a questionnaire  /ES 2-SN-Appendix
 
viii, no. 6/  was prepared and sent out by Dr. Károly Nagy
 
to former students of this school inquiring aoout their use
 
of the Hungarian language and maintenance of their heritage
 
since the time they left the ethnic scnool.  The goal of
 
tnis survey was to better understand the attitudes and prac-
tice of former students in maintaining their heritage, and
 
to incorporate these findings into the plans of the hungarian
 
school.
 It was not only important for the staff and faculty
 
to work within the present situation,  but it must be known
 
what becomes of their efforts and what fruit their work bears
 
in the future.
 
During the l9/ -l979 school year Susan Nagy visited the
 
Hungarian ethnic school to do her linguistic fieldwork for
 
her doctoral dissertation by taking a Hungarian vocabulary
 
survey of the hungarian-American students.
 She had the oppor-
tunity to visit the school five times during that winter to
 
complete the survey.  The following spring the students and
 
their parents filled out a comprehensive questionnaire di-
rected at the modes and intensity of the Hungarian-American
 
community's language and heritage maintenance,  The results
 
were incorporated in her dissertation entitled"Tne Teach-
ing of r
iungarian as a foreign Language in the united States
 
on the Basis of the Contrast.vity of the Englisn and x
iun-
garian Languages, " l9 O.
 
¶
rne work continuea at the scnool from Saturday to Satur-
day,  but at the closing of the 1979-1980 school year Susan
 
and Miklós Cserg6 decided to resign from their positions as
 
Director and Administrator of the Hungarian Saturday Classes.
 
Susan Csergô explains that "
...six years was a long time,
 
and we became very exhausted.
 My husband's health problems
 
were also a contributing factor.
 Furthermore, we felt that
 
someone else would have a chance to continue this rewarding
 
work.
 But from our standpoint: we became very tired -
 it
 
was just too muc h.
..
 
"
 About their future plans sne contem-
plates:  "
...We would surely continue the work if our per-
sonal situation would allow us to do so, but at this point
 
we have no positive plans..."  /ESb2-SN-C12,  2

IV. The Academic Years from 1980 to the Present
 
S
 
The third decade of the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
promises to follow the tradition set during the 1960's and
 
1970's.  Dr. Maria Tamás and Zaiginond Németh took over the
 
task of running the school in 1980.
 The fifty enrolled stu-
dents were visited by writers, actors and actresses from
 
Hungary and Transylvania.
 
The twenty-second year of instruction  /1981-1982/  was
 
dedicated to the remembrance of the one hundredth anniversary
 
of the death of the 19th century Hungarian poet, Já
.nos Arany,
 
coupled with the celebration of the one hundredth birthday
 
of Zoltan Kodály.
 
The administrative work was done by Eva Fekete and
 
Zsigmond Németh for the forty-four enrolled students last
 
year.
 The Hun €arian Saturday Classes continued to be held
 
at Frelinghuysen Hall on the Rutgers campus.
 
The maintenance and transmission of Hungarian heritage
 
demands dedication, sacrifice and a great deal of hard work.
 
Zoltá
.n Kodály reminds us that:  "Culture is not hereditary.
 
The culture of our ancestors evaporates all too quickly if
 
each generation does not acquire it for Itself."  This assures
 
us tr
iat tne work of the Hungarian Saturday Classes will go on
 
even when there remains but one child who feels the need to
 
learn about his/her Hungarian heritage and the language of
 
his/her ancestors.

The Curriculum of tne hungarian Saturday Classes 
26
 
The curriculum, levels and methods of instruction
 
' in an ethnic school such as the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
always predetermined in a sense by the composition of
 
the voluntary student body.
 The variety of students, classi-
fied
 according to their language proficiency, in turn is in-
fluenced by historical, environmental and social factors.
 
These features must also be taken into consideration when
 
speaking about the curriculum of an ethnic school.  Histori-
cally speaking for example, waves of emigration from countries
 
tend to sway the number and quality of potential participants
 
in an ethnic school program to include a larger percent of
 
people with native language proficiency.
 This was the case
 
in 1956 when the Hungarian Revolution 'recharged" the pool
 
of Hungarians living outside of Hungary.
 In New Brunswick
 
this brought on the establishment of a Hungarian school and
 
altered the composition of other Hungarian-American schools
 
already in existence.
 In comparison, only sporadic low
 
level immigration of Hungarians to the United States took
 
place since that time,  thus the level of students with a
 
native language proficiency in Hungarian decreased.
 Today
 
there are more and more Hungarian-American children enrolling
 
in the school who do not speak a word of Hungarian.
 These
 
factors must also be taken into consideration by the mem-
bers of ethnic communities who partake in the preservation
 
and transmission of their culture through an organized
 
S
 
S
 
27
 
S
 
effort such as a language school.
 U 
At the Hungarian Saturday Classes the number and variety
 
of enrolled students fluctuates annually, directly influencing
 
the levels of instruction and the material offered by the school.
 
At the beginning of the school year,  the Hungarian language
 
proficiency of each student is assessed, and on the basis of
 
his/her knowledge, age and occasionally personal considera-
tions, the student is placed into the class most advantageous
 
for his/her development.
 Susan Cserg6 elaborates: /The dill-
dren were divided according to/
 "their age and language pro-
ficiency .
.. many times there were difficulties .
.. for example
 
a six year old child had the language proficiency of a nine
 
year old .
.. but the opposite also happened.  We knew  tha
 
children do not like to be in the same class with younger
 
children .
.. but sometimes a nine year old did have to be in
 
the same class with six year olds.
 This in turn motivated
 
the child to study a bit more to be able to progress to the
 
higher class with his/her friends..."  /E582-SN-Cl2, 1, 248-
261/.
 
Usually four levels of language and literature instruc-
tion are formed: the beginner, intermediate I and II, and the
 
advanced level.  Hungarian as a Foreign Language is taught on
 
two levels: one course is designed for children, the other
 
for adults.
 The kindergarten stands as a separate entity.
 
Hungarian Folk Art  is taught to the student body as a whole,
 
28
 
not necessarily distinguishing between the stu ents accoraing
 
to age and language proficiency.
 
The subjects which were continuously taught at the Hun-
garian .aturday Classes  are the following:
 
• tne Basics of Hungarian .
t
teading and Writing
 
• Hungarian Language I and II
 
• hungarian LaL guage and Literature
 
• Hungarian Geography
 
• Hungarian history
 
• Hungarian as a Foreign Language I and II
 
•
 
song, dance, embroidery and
 
woodcarving!.
 
ue suojects are taught to ai
.i  stuaents,  but on various levels,
 
djusted to the capabilities and previous knowledge of each
 
class.
 
The teaching materials and text 000ks used at the nun-
garian Saturday Classes were created individually by the
 
teachers in the early years.  Textbooki published in the United
 
States and hungary were all used, depending upon the class,
 
the material taught and the instructor.  By the 1970's the
 
H
in'
.garian language and culture  textbooks written for foreign
 
students were implemented, and the need for supplementary
 
teaching materials was left up to the instructor.
 Presently,
 
the core of the curriculum taught at the Hungarian Saturday
 
Classes is contained in tne following textbooks:
 
• Tarka lepke
  
9 Magyar ezavak világa
 
29
 
• Hogyan mondjuk helyesen?
 
• Beszél Urik magyarul
 
• Learn Hungarian.
 
The students of Hungarian study for four hours each Sat-
urday from 9 o'clock to 1 o
'clock, and are tested t

Holidays
  
The Hungarian Saturday Classes celebrates and observes
 
traditional and national holidays during the course of the
 
academic year.
 The traditional holidays are celebrated by
 
closing the school for vacation: Thanksgiving,Christrnas and
 
the Easter holidays.
 Christmas, Mother's Day and the Hun-
garian national holidays are marked by a special program
 
prepared by the faculty and students of the school for the
 
parents and friends in the ethnic community. Pamphlets and
 
invitations are designed and distributed to inform the pub-
lie about the upcoming events  /Christmas: ES82-SN-Appendix
 
II, no. 1/, /Mother's Day: ES82-SN-Appendix V, no. 1/ and
 
/Hungarian National Holidays: E582-SN-Appendix III, no. 1
 
and 2/.
 
The two tungarian national holidays observed are October
 
23rd and March 15th.
 In autumn, the anniversary of the 1956
 
Hungarian Revolution is observed with a solemn program of
 
relevant poems and excerpts from letters and historical docu-
ments.
 The 1648 Hungarian War for Freedom is commemorated
 
in the spring with a literary and folk program.
 A large
 
portion of the Hungarian ethnic community takes part in
 
these observances.

Ethnic School Teachers
  
Volunteer teachers and instructors from an ethnic commu-
nity are tne individuals who pass on their knowledge about
 
the culture and language of their ancestors in the setting of
 
an ethnic school.  These teachers may either be trained pro-
fessionals or amateurs who speak the respective language and
 
are familiar with the heritage of the ethnic community.  The
 
trained professionals have either received their diplomas in
 
the country from which they emigrated,
, -
-Ln this case Hungary,
 
or in the ceuntry-to Wf
tiCh they immigrated
 the United States.
 
The most aavantageous situation for the students is an in-
structor who is dually trained.  The amateurs who take on
 
the mission of teaching in an ethnic school may have a na-
tive language proficiency brought from their homelands, or
 
might have acquired the knowledge to teach growing up in an
 
ethnic community.
 
At the Hungarian Saturday Classes there were examples
 
for all of the above mentioned possibilities, but the most
 
important guideline was to maintain a high quality in staff
 
as well as in teaching materials.  Dr. Nagy emphasizes that
 
"Right from the beginning .
.. We wanted to establish the fact
 
that this school was going to be a professional effort...
 
We selected teachers who had their teaching diplomas from
 
Hungary .
.. We tried to maintain it so that our teachers in-
deed would be qualified teachers.
 In the subsequent years,
 
some of these teachers had dual training,
..." /

It must be noted that the textbooks described earlier and
 
written in the 1970's for Hungarian-American students, were
 
prepared with accompanying teacher's manuals keeping the
 
issue of the professional and the dedicated novice teacher
 
in mind.  These manuals were of great assistance to the in-
structors using the new books, and will surely aid them in
 
the future as well.

Economic Considerations at the Hungarian Saturday Classes
  
The Hungarian Alumni Association, a non-profit or-
ganization, was chosen to be the sole supporter of the
 
school at the time of establishment in 1960.
 This associa-
tion continues to do so today.
 Unfortunately, as the years
 
progressed the funds were not adequate to cover the rising
 
expenses of keeping the school afloat.  Susan Cserg6 explains
 
some of the activities and methods of fund raising employed
 
during the years 1974-1980:
 "
...We did not receive finan-
cial help from anyone but the Hungarian Alumni Association.
 
Our school expanded, and we had to develop a "financial aid"
 
program of patrons.
 Our secondary source of help was from
 
the parental contributions donated for the education of their
 
children... Other sources of financial help were the dona-
tions given at the various programs, tne raffles and other
 
such activities .
.. A more organized form of aid was the /above
 
mentioned/
 patron program of the Hungarian Saturday Classes.
 
Fund raising letters  /E 8 -SN-Appendix IV, no. 5/  were sent
 
out each March to our sustaining patrons...and usually five
 
to six h
ir
ndreci families and individuals contributed regular-
ly .
.. those who felt the importance of keeping the school in
 
existence, and considered it their duty to help the school...
 
Another important source of a1d, which was indirect, was the
 
voluntary work offered by tne staff, faculty and parents.
 My
 
36
 
husband and  1 contributed six years of voluntary work..."
 
/Esb2- N-Cl2,  1
,  3u4-570/.
 
"
...if we would not have had to worry aDout the finan-
cial aspects of running the scnool it would have been alot
 
easier!
 The great amount of time put into the administrative
 
and fund raising work would all nave had been saved .
.. Many
 
sleepless hours were spent worrying about the scnool's fi-
\nancial difficulties.  A lot of time would have been saved..."
 
recalls Susan Csergó /ES82-SL-Cl2,  2
, 197-223/.

Parents and Children
 
The parents of tne students attending an ethnic school
 
S
 
S
 
come from a variety
 
cent immigrants, or
 
third generation of
 
eitner of identical
 
of backgrounds.
 They may be either re-
memoers of the first, second or even
 
an ethnic group.
 The parents  are
 
or of mixed heritage.
 The motivation
 
for sending their children to an ethnic school varies from
 
family to family.  Their reasons could either be emotional
 
and romantic, practical,  or even social in nature, some-
times a combination of goals.
 Steven Jurcsek, who sends
 
three of his children to the Hungarian Saturday Classes,
 
elaborates on their specific case:  "
...At home the language
 
is not really spoken, my wife is not Hungarian .
.. Yet, I do
 
want to have them share my belief for the Hungarian language,
 
my love for the country where I was born and which I had to
 
leave...I would like to pass something down to tnem...There-
fore, I feel that even if they will not speak the language
 
perfectly, they will learn about the language, history, and
 
some Hungarian songs .
.. I feel that the passing down of all
 
these values will make them better Americans..."  /ES82-SN-
C4, 1,  25-51/.
 
former director of the kungarian scnool, Susan Cserg6,
 
expresses similar views about transmitting knowledge aDout
 
her heritage.
 It is vital "
...because you cannot be a good
 
38
 
American if you deny that which you once were..." Secondly,
 
"
.../doing so will give the child/ two cultures .
.. The ch f
l'
 
will feel tnat he/she belongs somewhere, and will be ab1
 
to identify i
lls/her roots...it is also important in that tne
 
children will be able to understand their parents somewhat
 
better, those people wno cannot become fully American .
.. and
 
they will know a little about their heritage..."  /ES82-S.N-
C12, 1, 166-193; 148-165/.
 
The more practical aspects of learning another language
 
are expressed by Marianne Muszka:  "You are as many people
 
as the number of languages you know.
 We would like to have
 
our c
hildren study other languages later on, not only Hun-
garian..."  /ES32-SN-C9, 1
,  193-197/.  Magda Esz L
.iri, a
 
teacher at the Hungarian school, states that "My knowledge
 
is at hand, and I feel that learning only makes a person
 
more valua ble .
..
 there are many gems in Hungarian literature,
 
art and culture tnat are worth passing on...
 /ES82-SN-Cll,
 
1
, 210-224/.
 
Deneice 0roszváry, an American woman married to a Hun-
garian and learning tne language herself,  reels that " .
.. J
.t
 
is worthwhile to be connected to something .
.. we do not fit in
 
the American community anymore..."  /ES82-SN-C7, 1
, 187-200/.
 
The examples above reflect different angles and methods
 
of interpreting the importance or transmitting and maintain-
ing ethnic heritage and language, but all contribute positively
 
S
 
39
 
S
 
S
 
to the opinion that CO nSCIO US  transmission of one's heritage
 
is useful and a must.
 
There are equally varied opinions supporting the practice
 
of non-participation in an organized effort such as an ethnic
 
0
 
language school, or other forinsAethnjc activity.
 The shortage of
 
time, energy is a primary cause of a lack of participation, as
 
are personal,  social, ideological reasons 5 well as dis-
interest.
 Marianne Nuszka explains why she took her young-
est daughter out of Buzi arian school:
 "She had difficulty
 
distinguishing between the two languagezjn first grade.
 We
 
decided to take her out until she had the basics of English
 
down, and was ready to accept formal instruction in Hungarian.
 
She will be returning next year "  /E582-SN-c9, 1
, 28-39/.
 
In any event, the active participation in conscious
 
language and culture transmission requires time, dedica-
tion and financial commitments on the part of the parents
 
and children involved.
 A free Saturday morning could very
 
well be spent doing equally important activities such as
 
sports,  outings,  other hobbies, even housework or just
 
resting by young and old alike.
 
Many of the parents who do bring their children to
 
Hungarian school  manage to get some of their tasks done,
 
but others stay at the scnool and speak with the teachers,
 
directors and other paref
lts comine to the school and utilize
 
this time for social activity.  Whatever the case, a por-
tion of each Saturday is dedicated to their chilaren and
 
their Hungarian heritage.
 
Finally, a few words from the students, the children
 
who are t
ue subjects of the wnole program and issue of Hun-
garian heritage maintenance.  They do not seem to mind giving
 
up cartoons, sports activities, sleeping in on Saturday morn-
ings in lieu of learning Hungarian.
 They soon become accus-
tomed to sacrificing their leisure time during the week in
 
order to read and study Hungarian with their parents.
 They
 
also learned to make that extra effort to speak only in Hun-
garian in the home, and soon feel that "
...It sounds  '
weird'
 
if I speak to my parents in English..."  /ES82-SN-05, 1
,  118-
120/.
 This continuous surplus effort and work will surely
 
add to being a disciplined inuividual in the future.
 
Bernadette Nuszka, a former student of the Hungarian
 
school, left because she became interested in the many
 
activities offered by the weekday school she was attending.
 
She reflects on the years she did partake in Hungarian in-
struction:
 
"
...I like to say that J
. miss going there.
 It
 
is an empty space when it comes to Saturday mornings..."
 
/E582-SN-ClO,  1, 106-110/.
 
The students wno do make an effort in their lives to
 
come to an ethnic school to learn the language in a formal
 
way, enjoy the luxuries of knowing another language:  "
...we
 
can speak with our friends and no one will understand us..."
 
41
 
/ES82-SN-05,  1
,  68-92/.
 "
...I feel good about myself,...
 
and feel big that I know something my friends do not .
.. and
 
when I come home I have another life to live..."  The chil-
dren also have the valuable opportunity  to make other
 
friends, and acquire a true sense of belonging.
 
Esther Pigniczky sums up the essence of ethnic heritage
 
and language maintenance:
 "
...When I go to Hungarian Scouts,
 
rigrit away I have a million friends.
 We are all the same
 
people, and all understand each other.
 We know two worlds
 
and two languages..."  /LS82-SIc-05, 1
, 210-218/.

HUNGARIAN SATURDAY CLASSES
 
New Brunswick, New Jersey
 
Final Report by Susan Mary Nagy
 
History of the Hungarian Saturday Classes, New Brunswick, New Jersey
 
The 1
956 Hungarian Revolution brought some 42,000 Hungarian
 
immigrants to the United States, many o
f whom settled in the area of
 
New Brunswick, New Jersey. Soon after their arrival several young
 
Hungarian students enrolled at Rutgers University in New Brunswick,
 
later forming the association called Hungarian Students
 
University. One student, Karoly Nagy, b
ecame one of the
 
fathers o
f the ethnic school in New Brunswick. He plays
 
at Rutgers
 
founding
 
a key role in
 
the affairs of the Hungarian-American community to this day. Dr. Nagy
 
recalls that
 .
 .
 .
 towards the end of the decade .
 .
 .
 in 158,  '59,
 
'
60, we [Hungarian students at Rutgers University]  began to feel that
 
there are enough youngsters in .
 .
 .
 the New Brunswick area growing up
 
in American schools with sufficient knowledge about their ancestry and
 
heritage, and perhaps our organization ought to do something about that
 
as well .. . ... (ES82-SN-C6, I, 1
, 66-74)
 
By early 1960 this group of "fit ty-sixers" who considered
 
themselves to be bearers of the revolutionary Hungarian tradition
 
organized a Hungarian school in New Brunswick, with the support of the
 
larger non-university Hungarian community. Their decision was based on
 
a
 I
.
 
feasibility study to see whether it would be a good idea to
 
s
tart some kind of organized Hungarian instruction.  .
 .
 .
 This .
 .
 
2
 
study consisted of a questionnaire, which we sent out t
o the addresses
 
that we gathered by that t
ime through our cultural efforts .
 .
 .
 .
 The
 
r
esponse was overwhelming." (ESd2-SN---Ca, 1
, 1
,  1
06-118).
 
The preliminary tasks o
f locating classrooms t
o house the
 
Hungarian school and of handling a variety of administrative and
 
pedagogical work was completed in the spring and summer. On Septen:n
 
1
7,  1
960 the Hungarian Saturday Classes opened i
ts doors to f o r t y - f o
L
 
Hungarian-American students. During the course of the first academic
 
year t
he school added a Hungarian kindergarten.
 
The Hungarian Alumni Association, an organization created t
o
 
continue the work of the Hungarian Students at Rutgers University, was
 
chosen to be the sole supporter of the Hungarian Saturday Classes, and
 
continues in that role. Unfortunately, as the years progressed, the
 
funds have not been adequate to cover the rising expenses of keeping
 
the school afloat. As the school expanded its administrators had to
 
develop a "financial aid" program of patrons. The program included
 
donations from parents for the education of their children. Raffles and
 
other fund-raising activities, such as fund-raising letters, helped
 
raise money. By the period between 1
974 and 1980 some five- to
 
six-hundred families and individuals were contributing regularly t
o the
 
school. Another important source of aid, while indirect, is the
 
voluntary work offered by the staff,  faculty, and parents.
 
3
 
During the initial year of Hungarian instruction the faculty
 
consisted of only four teachers. Throughout the school years the number
 
and constitution of the faculty and staff of the Hungarian school has
 
fluctuated in response to the number of students enrolled for each
 
academic year and developments in the private lives of the voluntary
 
instructors.
 
Certainly the most difficult problem faced at the outset was the
 
complete lack of teaching materials in the United States or elsewhere
 
designed for the unique needs of weekend instruction of the Hungarian
 
language. The difficulty was not overcome until the 1970s. Dr. Nagy
 
recounts the faculty's experience of developing a curriculum as
 
follows:
 
/
 
We found that nothing was available for once-a-week
 
teaching methodology, for Hungarian as a second
 
language, nor for Hungarian as a first language, which
 
it was for many of the students who spoKe fluent
 
Hungarian because they were sons and daughters of
 
parents who came out four or five years ago from
 
Hungary .
 .
 .  but once-a-week methodology is quite
 
difficult.  (ES82-SN-C6, I,  1
,  153/159)
 
Commenting further on this aspect of the school's history, Dr. Nagy
 
relates:
 
Of course,  the material available from Hungary was so
 
filled with propaganda,  and was geared .
 .
 .  for
 
everyday teaching methodology —it was useless. We did
 
two things: we as teachers,  on one hand, had to put
 
together, search, and find  .
 .
 .
 and create our own
 
teaching material, including books, which were
 
non-existent; on the other hand, we had to start a
 
larger research to see whether there is similar
 
Hungarian instruction anywhere else, outside of
 
Hungary.  .
 .
 .  What we frequently did was to try to
 
4
 
purchase, ask, borrow, f
ind, r

, 1 223-260)
 
Naturally,  this was only a t
emporary solution t
o the problem o
f
 
lack of suitable materials for students with a language profici
 
Hungarian as varied as the number of s
tudents enrolled. A much
 
and more comprehensive effort was needed t
o develop curriculum
 
materials suited to this unique pedagogical situation.
 
The first 'era  in the history of the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
(
1960-1967) was characterized by a continuing increase in the number of
 
registered students from forty-four in 1
960 to one hundred and sixteen
 
in 1
967. The increase in enrollment suggests that the Hungarian
 
community realized the importance of maintaining a Hungarian school and
 
the -value of the systematic transmission of Hungarian culture to their
 
children.
 
Increased enrollments demanded a change in all a
spects of managing
 
the school, affected the curriculum, and altered the methodology used
 
by the teachers.  In the face of increased enrollments the school
 
administrators established new classes and restructured the old ones,
 
5
 
grouping students by age and language proficiency. Such accommodation
 
continued t
o b
e made each year when there was a significant change in
 
the s
tudent body.
 
The l
ocation of the Hungarian school r
emained b
asically the same. All
 
the buildings housing the school were located on the Rutgers campus in
 
New Brunswick;  the two main buildings u
sed for the l
ongest length o
f
 
t
ime were the Ballantine Building and Frelinghuysen Hall.
 
A r
esearch project was launched in t
he 1
9b3-1964 school year
 
through the combined efforts o
f the American Hungarian Studies
 
Foundation and the Hungarian University s
tudents in North America.  I
ts
 
purpose was t
o locate, contact, and describe other Hungarian schools in
 
the United States with the hope that the school administrators would b
e
 
able to get together later, exchange experiences, and learn from one
 
another. They completed the project in 1
965 and published the results
 
as "Hungarian Schools in the United States" in The Slavic and East  
European Journal. The study sparked the interest of many, including the
 
renowned music theoretician and composer, Zolt n Kod ly, founder of the
 
Kodaly Method. Kodaly wrote about the twenty-three Hungarian-American
 
schools Nagy located in an article published i
n Magv r Hcrek,  i  d
:
i i
 I
  
newspaper in Hungary, on November 1
5,  1
965.

A S
4u0 scholarship was also established in the 1
9b3-19b4 s
chool
 
year by the Hungarian Alumni Association. It i
s for Hungarian-American
 
s
tudents who complete t
he Hungarian Saturday Classes and pursue t
heir
 
university studies a
t Rutgers or Douglass University i
n New Brunswick,
 
New Jersey.
 
During the 1
964-1965 academic year a major c
oncern surfaced which
 
would be a continuous care for the staff and administrators of the
 
school throughout its history--the loss of students and their
 
replacement. Kindergarten was perceived as the key t
o assuring
 
continued school attendance, since the l
ittle ones were l
iable t
o
 
continue a
s students of  the Hungarian school,  replacing the older
 
s
tudents who were leaving. By realizing the problem o
f s
tudent l
oss and
 
applying positive organizational work, the kindergarten reported an
 
increase in attendance during the 1
964-1965 school year.
 
Between 1967 and 1
974 the school weathered its crucial years,
 
brought on by unfortunate medical problems experienced by members of
 
the administration. Children enrolled dropped from one hundred and
 
sixteen to sixty-two in the 1
967-1968 school year. Later, a growi
 
opposition within the Hungarian-American community towards the school
 
caused the number of registered students to dwindle t
o forty by 1
974.
 
During these years the structure of the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
remained essentially identical to that in previous years, inspite of
 
there being fewer students. The school was only maintained at full
 
strength for two years during this period —in 1
968 the enrollment
 
numbered ninety-nine and  totalled one hundred and nine in 1970.
 
7
 
The location of the kindergarten was moved t
o the Washington
 
School on French Street in New Brunswick during this period, where it
 
r
emained until the 1977-1978 school year. The school's choir,
 
consisting of twenty-one s
tudents, was formed in 1
969, under director
 
/
 
Jeno Adam.  A new class was also added between 1967 and 1974 —the
 
organized instruction of folk art in theory and practice. The class
 
instructs students on folk motifs, a
s well as the various stitches and
 
patterns of embroidery characteristic of different r
egions of Hungary.
 
The fifteenth anniversary of the Hungarian Saturday Classes in
 
1
974 coincided with the r
egeneration of the student body,  and a r
evival
 
was sensed within the school. The school began the year with fifty-four
 
registered students and completed the year with ninety-nine
 
Hungarian-American youngsters enrolled.
 
The third decade of Hungarian Saturday Classes promises to follow
 
the tradition set during the 1960s and 1970s. The twenty-second year of
 
instruction (
1981-1982) was dedicated to the remembrance of the 1
00th
 
anniversary of the death of the 1
9th-century Hungarian poet J'nos
 
Arany, coupled with the celebration of the 1
00th birthday of Zoltá
 
Kod ly.

Classes and Curriculum
 
During the 19 b 05,  a
fter t
he publication of the r
esults o
f h
is
 
research project on Hungarian schools in this country, Dr. Nagy began
 
organizing his efforts t
o bring about a badly need conference o
f
 
Hungarian schools. Recalling his work a
t that t
ime, Dr. Nagy says:
 
I have duplicated t
his published material and se nt  i
t t
o
 
them [
the other Hungarian-American schools)  to
 
organize a get-together, a conference of sorts at
 
Rutgers University. That conference never materialized
 
because of the huge distances that these people would
 
have t
o travel on their own monies
 .
 .
 .
 Parallel t
o
 
that,  I have sent this material .
 .
 to Hungarian
 
leaders .
 .
 .
 cultural leaders in Hungary whom I
 
know--Zolta'n Kodaly, Mihaly Vaci, and to Gyula
 
Illyes —and they started t
o respond .
 .
 .
 .
 First or
 
all, we started a c
orrespondence with Mihaly Vaci. I
 
sent him all sorts of materials; he encouraged me.
 
• But they also started to work on the Hungarian
 
academe and professionals .
 .  •
 because I proposed to
 
them: why don't they help us organize some kind of
 
conference? .
 .
 .  Finally, they have succeeded in
 
pushing things so far that in 1
970 the first such
 
conference was organized by a body of Hungarian
 
scholars and officials at Lajos Kossuth University in
 
Debrecen [Hungary], and at that time this loose
 
organization received the name of Anyanyelvi
 
Konferencja-.-Natjve Language Conference — .
 .
 •
 and
 
that organization exists ever since.
 
(ES82-sN-c6, I
, 1
, 306-330)
 
Opposition within the Hungarian-American community disappeared in
 
1
970, when the first Native Language Conference occurred, notes
 
A second school was established in response, "which we viewed as a
 
partly desirable state of affairs because,  instead of having one
 
Hungarian school, it is better t
o have two, no matter who starts [
it]
 
and why," says Nagy.  (ES82-SN-c6, I
, 2
, 202-204)
 
9
 
The Native Language Conference took place in the summer of
 
1
970.  It apparently caught many people unawares.  "They didn't know
 
quite  what  to  make  of  it,"  says   
 
At the week-long conference Dr. Nagy proposed a program which
 
included the cooperative writing of Hungarian-language textbooks for
 
American students. The proposal was accepted, and the Hungarian
 
scholars proclaimed that they would write the textbooks for the
 
Hungarian schools,  to which Nagy vigorously protested.  'He barraged
 
them with letters saying that we are just not going to teach those
 
books that will be written by people sitting at their desks in
 
budapest. What we have to do absolutely is have the textbook writers
 
see the medium,  the population .
 .
 .
 survey the population for whom
 
they are writing the textbooks," recalls -
-
-
.
 (ES82 SN-C6, II, 1
,
 
377-382) Dr. Nagy countered with a proposal for overcoming the lack of
 
exposure to American culture on the part of the proposed Hungarian
 
writers, and soon enough the three textbook authors  were in the United
 
f
lu t
 
ey  U
iu  Loeic  worK  immediately  by  visiting  hungarian — American
 
schools in the New Jersey area,  including the Passaic Catholic School,
 
which at that time offered Hungarian-language instruction everyday.
 
They taped the pronunciation patterns of the children,  interviewed
 
parents and teachers, and collected old and new curriculum materials.
 
The writers also visited American schools,  since it was equally
 
important to witness what the children were exposed to during the week.
 
At American public and private schools they interviewed teachers,
 
1
0
 
took notes, and gathered American t
extbooks t
o l
earn more about t
he
 
methodologies used t
o t
each i
n this country. They visited schools in
 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Canada b
efore flying back t
o
 
Budapest t
o begin working on the Hungarian-language textbooks designed
 
for American children.
 
Back in Budapest the t
extbook writers began working on the b
ooK
 
for intermediate students. The format had been agreed upon earlier —the
 
t
extbooks would be accompanied by workbooks, cassette tapes, and
 
teacher's manuals. There would b
e four l
evels or sets of teaching
 
materials initially.  I
t had b
een stressed and agreed upon at t
he outset
 
that the materials would not contain a bit of propaganda:  in the event
 
that a t
race of i
t were f
ound i
n t
he b
ooks,  they would b
e r
ejected
 
immediately.
 
The most difficult phase of the work was introducing the newly
 
written material. The textbook writers sent their manuscripts chapter
 
by chapter to the Hungarian Saturday Classes. The material was then
 
taken into the classrooms, put to the test with the Hungarian-American
 
children, commented on, revised, and returned to Budapest through the
 
mail. This tedious but rewarding task went on for a number of years,
 
until the books were completed and published.
 
The books were put to use immediately at the Hungarian Saturday
 
Classes. The Passaic Hungarian School in Passaic, New Jersey was also
 
one of the first Hungarian-American schools to use the books prepared
 
through the joint efforts of Dr. Nagy, the Hungarian school, and the
 
I
 
1
1
 
Native Language Conference. Today the books are being used at more and
 
more Hungarian-Am erica n schools.
 
The curriculum  grade l
evels, and methods o
f instruction i
n an
 
ethnic school such as the Hungarian Saturday Classes is predetermined,
 
in a sense, by the composition of the student body. The variety o
f
 
students, classified according to their language proficiency, in turn
 
i
s influenced by historical, environmental  and social factors. The
 
1
956 Hungarian Revolution  recharged'  the pool o
f Hungarians l
iving
 
outside Hungary.  In New Brunswick this brought on t
he establishment o
f
 
a Hungarian school and altered the composition o
f other
 
schools already in existence. By comparison, only a
 
l
ow level immigration of Hungarians t
o the United States has taken
 
place since that time, and the level of students with a native-language
 
proficiency in Hungarian Participating in the school program has
 
decreased. Today there are more and more Hungarian-American children
 
enrolling in the school who do not speak a word of Hungarian.
 
The number of students enrolled in the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
fluctuates annua l
ly, directly influencing the
 v I
 ut
 i
str
i
 
material offered by the school. The Hungarian-. ,
,
 
each student is assessed at the beginning of the school year. On the
 
basis of their knowledge of Hungarian, age, and other personal
 
considerations,  the students are placed into the classes most
 
advantageous for their development. As Susan Csergd' explains, the
 
children were divided according to:
 
1
2
 
their age and language proficiency .
 .
 .
 Many t
imes
 
there were difficulties .
 .
 .
 for example, a
 
six-year-old child had the language proficiency of a
 
nine-year-old .
 .
 .
 but the opposite also happened. We
 
knew that children do not like to be in the same class
 
with younger children .
 .
 .
 but sometimes a
 
nine-year-old did have to be in the same class with
 
six-year-olds. This, in turn, motivated the child to
 
s
tudy a bit more to be able to progress to the higher
 
class with his or her friends .
 .
 .
 .
 (ES82-SN-C12,  1

Usually four levels o
f language and l
iterature instruction are
 
formed:  the beginner,  intermediate I and I
I, and advanced level.
 
Hungarian i
s taught as a f
oreign language in a class for children and
 
another for adults. The kindergarten stands as a separate entity.

Saturday Classes are:
 
Basics of Hungarian reading and writing
 
Hungarian language I and II
 
Hungarian language and literature
 
Hungarian geography
 
Hungarian history
 
Hungarian as a foreign language I and II
 
Hungarian folk arts (song, dance, embroidery, and
 
woodcarving)
 
The subjects are taught t
o all students on various levels, adjusted to
 
the capabilities and previous knowledge of each class.

Presently,  the core of the curriculum taught at the Hungarian
 
Saturday Classes is contained in the following textbooks:
 
Tarka lepke
  
Magyar szavak vila'ga

Learn Hun a r
 i
nn
  
A. M.  to 1 P.M., and are tested throughout the school year. They
 
receive report cards at their graduation ceremonies. This practice
 
generally serves as motivation for the students and is symbolic in
 
nature.
 
The Hungarian Saturday Classes celebrates and observes traditional
 
and national holidays during the course of the academic year. The
 
traditional holidays are celebrated by closing the school for vacation
 
for the Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter holidays. Christmas,
 
Mother's Day, and the Hungarian national holidays are marked by a
 
special program prepared by the faculty and students for their parents
 
and friends in the ethnic community.
 
The Christmas program was instituted by Miklos Csergo. His wife
 
Susan recalls:
 
The students were joyous about the Christmas holiday
 
•
 .  and we passed on to them the Hungarian spirit of
 
Christmas  .
 •
 .
 .  This also became cultural education
 
k

for the whole Hungarian community .
 .
 .
 Through
 
these programs and plays they [
the parents and
 
friends ]
 enjoyed seeing the development and the
 
knowledge of their children, and were all happy that
 
the Christmas holiday was celebrated in a family
 
spirit,  bringing back their memories of childhood.
 
After the program all the students received a l
ittle
 
present brought by the baby Jesus. In Hungary he is
 
t
he bearer of gifts .
 .
 .
 and this concluded the
 
ceremonies. (ES82-SN-c12,  1
, 1
17-147)
 
The two Hungarian national holidays observed are October 2
3 and
 
March 1
5. The anniversary o
f the 1956 Hungarian Revolution is observed
 
in autumn with a solemn program of relevant poems and excerpts f
rom
 
letters and historical documents. The Hungarian War for Freedom in 1
846
 
i
s commemorated in the spring with a l
iterary and folk program. A large
 
portion of the Hungarian ethnic community takes part in these
 
observances. One of the t
eachers who worked with the children for s
ix
 
years in preparing and practicing for these programs i
s Magda Eszla1r
i.
 
She explains the pedagogical benefits o
f sucri programs:
 
Even though the children have t
o work very hard at
 
overcoming [
linguistic] difficulties in preparing for a
 
program, I feel that it is extremely useful .
 .
 .
 .
 And
 
even though it takes away much t

teaching, that which a child learns at this t
ime will
 
be remembered .

 he has invested more work into
 
[it], especially when he experiences success .

And because he is performing in front of an audience,
 
he will remember [
the poems, etc.] to a greater extent.

 There is Hungarian school every week, but there
 
are only two,  three programs a year.  (ESb2-SN-C11,  1

Teachers
 
Volunteer teachers and instructors from the community pass on
 
their knowledge of the culture and language of their ancestors at the
 
Hungarian Saturday Classes. Some of the teachers are trained
 
1
5
 
professionals who speak Hungarian and are familiar with the heritage,
 
of the ethnic community, and others are amateurs. The trained
 
professionals received t
heir diplomas either in Hungary or the United
 
States. The most advantageous situation for the students, of course,  is
 
an instructor who is dually t
rained.
 
School administrators have made every effort t
o maintain a high
 
quality in the staff, a
s well as in teaching materials.  "Right from the
 
beginning .
 .
 .
 we wanted t
o establish the fact that this school was
 
going  to  be a professional effort  .
 .
 ,
"
 says  Dr.  Nagy.  "We  selected
 
teachers who had their teaching diplomas from Hungary.  .
 .
 .
 We tried
 
to  maintain  it so that our teachers indeed would be qualified teachers.
 
In the subsequent years, some of the teachers had dual training

:1a Schmidt, who taught Hungarian reading and writing to the
 
lementary class. In addition, Dr. K roly Nagy taught Hungarian
 
language and literature and Dr. Be'la Gyengo' lectured on the most
 
important features of Hungarian history in the advanced class. The
 
Hungarian kindergarten was led by Mrs. Andr s Rockenstein during the
 
second semester.
 
The first small expansion of the school program took place in the
 
second school year (1961-1962), when two lecturers were invited to
 
speak to the history class: Joseph Held and Andr s Rockenstein. An
 
organized series of monthly lectures, the Sz chenyi Seminar, was
 
1
6
 
initiated f
or the s
tudents in the advanced classes during the 1
963-1964
 
school year. These university-level lectures were presented by
 
Hungarian professors t
eaching a
t North American universities: Dr.
 
Andr as Alf'ldi, Dr. lstv i Foltinyi, and Dr. Miklo  Hars nyi from
 
Princeton University; Dr. Ka"roly Henkey from Montreal University; Dr.
 
Andras Pog
y of Seton Hall University; and August J
. Molnar from
 
Rutgers University. The l
ecturers discussed Hungarian archeology,
 
history, music, and literature.
 
There were new t
eachers added to t
he faculty o
f the school in
 
1974, among them Magda Eszl rj, Mr.  and Mrs. Somogyi, and Melinda
 
Hoffmann.
 
The years between 1
974 and 1
980 were marked in general by the
 
cohesion of the Hungarian Saturday Classes with the Hungarian ethnic
 
community and brought about developments such as mini-conferences
 
between the teachers and the Parent Teachers Association (PTA). These
 
conferences soon expanded. In 1
976 the Hungarian school's faculty held
 
a teacher conference at Rutgers University which brought together the
 
teachers of Hungarian from the East Coast. The instructors shared their
 
experiences and discussed the many hardships of keeping the Hungarian
 
schools alive and maintaining the Hungarian language.
 
In 1977 the faculty and staff of the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
visited the Passaic Hungarian School in Passaic, New Jersey to discuss
 
pedagogical and methodological issues. The third conference of
 
the American Hungarian Educators' Association paid a visit to the
 
1
7
 
Hungarian Saturday Classes in April 1
978, during which Hungarian
 
language teachers from Chicago and Passaic demonstrated their teaching
 
methods to the faculty in the classrooms of the Hungarian school in New
 
Brunswick.
 
By the late 1970s the Hungarian Saturday Classes of the Hungarian
 
Alumni Association had become very well known to interested Hungarians
 
throughout the world. Professional educators, poets, writers,
 
historians, and journalists visited the classrooms to witness ethnic
 
history in the making in New Brunswick.  Professionals interested in the
 
maintenance of Hungarian heritage and the science of teaching foreign
 
languages arrived at the school from many points in the United States
 
and Europe, and their impact was much more permanent than ever
 
imagined. Some writers and poets returned to their homes and recorded
 
their impressions in novels, articles, and poems. Several sent copies
 
back to the Hungarian Saturday Classes as a token of appreciation and
 
expression of respect for the teachers, students, and parents who
 
sacrifice so much to maintain their heritage and language in the United
 
States.
 
School Administration
 
The administrative  managerial, and organizational work at the
 
Hungarian school is performed by a director and administrator. The
 
individuals selected to assume these positions are members of the
 
Hungarian Alumni Association. The positions of school director and
 
18
 
administrator were assumed by Susan and Miklc's Csergo' in the summer of
 
1974. The Czergos continued their administration of the school until the
 
end of the 1
979-1980 school year. The administrative work was done by
 
Eva Fekete and Zsigmond Nemeth for the forty-four students enrolled in
 
1
981.
 
The work of administering the school needs to be done all year
 
round and is extremely diverse. The following outline provides on
 
overview of the four areas in which thorough, consistent, and dedicated
 
work must be done to run a successful school.

 FINANCIAL:
 
Accounting and bookkeeping
 
Fund raising
 
Bank, insurance, tax, and related matters
 
Preparation of monthly financial reports t

part in all Hungarian-American social
 
functions
 
Telephone recruiting preceding all programs
 
and activities of the school
 
Locating and renting classrooms and halls
 
for the school and its various programs
 
Creating, organizing, and monitoring all
 
plays and programs put on by the students
 
Organizing all aspects of dinner-dances,

students, and teachers, along with the
 
curriculum
 
Examining, purchasing, and distributing books,
 
films,  records, and graduation gifts
 
Maintaining a list of enrolled students
 
Presiding over teacher and staff meetings, as
 
well as PTA meetings

-preparing and delivering speeches in the
 
U.S. and abroad
 
writing articles about the school for
 
newspapers and journals
 
Conducting all advisory and social work
 
undertaken by the school within the ethnic
 
community
 
Drafting,  designing,  preparing,  and printing
 
all letters, invitations, pamphlets,
 
posters, yearbooks, and report cards
 
Preparing and handling all audio-visual
 
materials,  photos, and sound recordings
 
Storing all materials belong to the school--
books,  notebooks, pamphlets,  letters,  forms
 
recorders, and projectors
 
Setting up schedules for the upcoming year
 
Maintaining an active address file of patrons,
 
parents, and participants
 
Addressing and mailing invitations,
 
fund-raising letters, and other
 
correspondence
 
Susan Csergd feels that the key to the administrative success
 
experienced by her and her husband was the excellent relationship
 
between the Hungarian-American community and the parents,  children,
 
faculty, and staff of the school.  "This is what transformed the school
 
into a micro- community, a large family where everyone felt at home, and
 
felt welcome .
 .
 .
 the childern, the parents, and the teachers,
 she
 
explains.  "And the way to achieve this was by systematic organizational
 
work throughout the year." (ES82-SN-c12,  1
, 83-114)
 
After a six years of the responsibilities outlined above
 
however, both of them found themselves nearly exhausted.  "If we would
 
not have had to worry about the financial aspects of running the school
 
it would have been a lot easier!" notes Mrs. Csergd.  '
The great amount
 
20
 
of t
ime put into the administrative and fund-raising work would all
 
have been saved .
 .
 .
 .
 Many sleepless hours were spent worrying about
 
the school's f
inancial difficulties. A lot of t
ime would have been
 
saved .
 .
 .
"
 (ES82-SN-C12, 2
,  197-223)
 
Parents
 
The importance of p
arent-teacher meetings for the Hungarian s
chool
 
was realized in the early years, and there were two or three PTA
 
meetings h
eld each school year. The parents were always encouraged t
o
 
take part in the classroom instruction and the final examinations,  t
o
 
monitor the progress o
f their children and the quality of material
 
taught. A good relationship between the children, teachers,  parents,
 
and community has always been one of the school's goals.
 
The parents of the students attending an ethnic school come from
 
a variety of backgrounds. They may be either recent immigrants or
 
members of the first, second, or, in some cases, the third generation
 
of their ethnic group. The motivation for sending their children to an
 
ethnic school varies from family to family. Steven Jurcsek, who sends
 
three of his children to the Hungarian Saturday Classes, elaborates on
 
their specific case:
 
t home the language is not really spoken. My wife is
 
not Hungarian .
 .
 .
 .  Yet, I do want to have them share
 
my belief for the Hungarian language, my love for the
 
country where I was born, and which I had to leave .
 
I would like to pass something down to them .
 .
 .

Therefore, I f
eel that even if they will n
ot speak the
 
language perfectly, they will learn about the language,
 
h
istory, and some Hungarian songs .
 .
 .
 .
 I feel that
 
the passing down of all these values will make them
 
b
etter Americans .
 .
 .
 .
 (ES82-S -C4, 1
, 25-51)
 
Susan Csergo', former director of the school, expresses similar
 
views about t
ransmitting knowledge about her heritage. I
t is vital
 
"because you cannot b
e a good American i
f you deny that which you once
 
were .. . ... She Continues,
 
The child will feel that he or she belongs s
omewhere
 
and will be able t
o identity his or her roots .
 
I
t i
s also important in that the children will b
e able
 
t
o understand their parents somewhat better,  those
 
p
eople who cannot become fully American .
 .
 .
 and they
 
will know a little about their heritage .

, 1

48-1b5)
 
The more practical aspects of learning another language are
 
expressed by Marianne Muszka. "You are as many people as the number of
 
languages you know. We would like to have our children study other
 
languages later on, not only Hungarian." (Es82-sN-c9, 1
,  193-197) Magda
 
Eszlari, a teacher at the Hungarian school, feels "My knowledge is at
 
hand, and I feel that learning only makes a person more valuabi,
 
there are many gems in Hungarian literature, art, and culture t
:
 
worth passing on." (ES82-SN-C1I,  1
, 2
10-224) Deneice Oroszv ry, an
 
American woman married t
o a Hungarian and learning the language
 
herself, feels "it is worthwhile to be connected to something .
 .
 .
 we
 
do not fit in the American community anymore .. . . .. (ES82"SN'C7,  1
,
 
1
87-200)

There are equally varied opinions regarding non-participation in
 
an organized cultural effort, such a
s an ethnic language school, o
r in
 
o
ther f
orms of e
thnic activity. The shortage of t
ime and energy i
s a
 
primary cause of non-participation; so too are personal,  social, and
 
ideological r
easons, a
s well as general disinterest. Marianne Muszka
 
she took her youngest daughter out of Hungarian school:  "She had
 
difficulty distinguishing b
etween the two l
anguages in first grade. We
 
decided t
o take her out until she had the basics of English down and
 
was ready t
o accept formal i
nstruction in Hungarian. She will b
e
 
returning next year." (ES82-SN-c9,  1
, 28-39)
 
Active participation in the Hungarian Saturday Classes r
equires
 
t
ime, dedication, and financial commitments on the part of the parents
 
and children involved. A free Saturday morning could very well be spent
 
doing other important activities. Many parents who send their children
 
to Hungarian school manage to get some of their tasks done on Saturday
 
morning, but others stay at the school and speak with the teachers,
 
directors, and other parents, utilizing this time for social activity.
 
Whatever the case, a portion of each Saturday is dedicated to their
 
chiTdren and their Hungarian heritage.
 
btudents
 
Finally, a few words from the students, the children who are the
 
subjects of the entire program directed towards Hungarian heritage
 
maintenance. Most of them do seem to mind giving up cartoons, sports
 
23
 
activities, and sleeping in on Saturday morning t
o learn Hungarian.
 
They seem t
o have become accustomed to sacrificing their leisure t
ime
 
on the weekend and during the week to l
earn Hungarian,  however.  Many
 
have also learned to make an extra effort to speak only Hungarian in
 
the home. As one youngster commented, "It sounds  'weird'  if I speak to
 
my parents in English." (ESb2-SN-c5,  1
,  1
18-1 0).
 
Bernadette Muszka, a f
ormer student at the school,  left because
 
she became interested in many of the activities offered by the weekday
 
school she was attending. Reflecting on the years she did partake in
 
Hungarian instruction she says,  "I like to say that I miss going thee.
 
[
'\
 
It is an empty space when i
t comes to Saturday mornings."  (ES82-SN-CIO,
 
1
,  106-110)
 
The students who continue to make an effort to attend the school
 
and learn the language formally enjoy the luxuries of knowing another
 
language. "We can speak with our friends and no one will understd i
i
 
us," says one.  (ES82-sN-c5,  1
, 68-92). Another comments,  "I feel good
 
about myself .
 .
 .
 and feel big that I know something my friends do
 
nbC.  .
 .
 .
 And when I come home I have another life to live."
 
Another benefit the school offers is the opportunity to make other
 
friends and acquire a true sense of belonging. As Esther Pigniczky
 
says,  "When I go to Hungarian Scouts,  right away I have a million
 
friends. We are all the same people and all understand each other. We
 
know two worlds and two languages." (ES82-SN-05,  1

Final Report by Susan Mary Nagy
 
History of the Hungarian Saturday Classes, New Brunswick, New Jersey
 
The 1956 Hungarian Revolution brought some 42,000 Hungarian
 
immigrants to the United States, many of whom settled in the area of
 
New Brunswick, New Jersey. Soon after their arrival several young
 
Hungarian s
tudents enrolled at Rutgers University in New Brunswick,
 
later forming the association called Hungarian Students at Rutgers
 
University. One student, Kroly Nagy, became one of the founding
 
fathers of the ethnic school in New Brunswick. He plays a key role in
 
the affairs of the Hungarian-American community to this day. Dr. Nagy
 
recalls that "
 .
 .
 .  toward the end of the decade .
 .
 .
 in '5 ,  '
59,
 
'
60, we [Hungarian students at Rutgers University] began to feel that
 
there are enough youngsters in .
 .
 .  the New Brunswick area growing up
 
in American schools with sufficient knowledge about their ancestry and
 
heritage, and perhaps our organization ought to do something about that
 
as well. . - .
" (ES82-SN-C6, I
, 1
, 66-74)
 
By early 1960 this group of "fifty-sixers" who considered
 
themselves to be bearers of the revolutionary Hungarian tradition
 
organized a Hungarian school in New Brunswick, with the support of the
 
larger non-university Hungarian community. Their decision was based on
 
a "
 .
 .
 .  feasibility study to see whether it would be a good idea to
 
start some kind of organized Hungarian instruction.  .
 .
 .  This .
 .
 
2
 
study consisted of a questionnaire, which we sent out to the addresses
 
that we gathered by that t
ime through our cultural efforts .
 .
 .
 .
 The
 
response was overwhelming." (ES82-SN-C6, I
,  1
,  1
06 118).
 
The preliminary tasks of locating classrooms t
o house the
 
Hungarian school and of handling a variety of administrative and
 
pedagogical work was completed in the spring and summer. On September
 
1
7, 1960 the Hungarian Saturday Classes opened i
ts doors to forty-four
 
Hungarian-American students. During the course of the first academic
 
year the school added a Hungarian kindergarten.
 
The Hungarian Alumni Association, an organization created t
o
 
continue t
tie work of the Hungarian Students at Rutgers University, was
 
chosen to be the sole supporter of the Hungarian Saturday Classes, and
 
continues in that role. Unfortunately, as the years progressed, the
 
funds have not been adequate to cover the rising expenses of keeping
 
the school afloat. As the school expanded its administrators had t
o
 
develop a "financial aid" program of patrons. The program included
 
donations from parents for the education of their children. Raffles and
 
other fund-raising activities, such as fund-raising letters, helped
 
raise money. By the period between 1
974 and 1
980 some five- to
 
six-hundred families and individuals were contributing regularly t
o the
 
school. Another important source of aid, while indirect, is the
 
voluntary work offered by the staff, faculty, and parents.
 
3
 
During the initial year of Hungarian instruction the faculty
 
consisted of only four teachers. Throughout the school years the number
 
and constitution of the faculty and staff of the Hungarian
 
fluctuated in response t
o the number of students enrolled fr
 i
ch
 
academic year and developments in the private lives of the voluntary
 
instructors.
 
Certainly the most difficult problem faced at the outset was the
 
complete lack of teaching materials in the United States or elsewhere
 
designed for the unique needs of weekend instruction of the Hungarian
 
language. The difficulty was not overcome until the 1970s. Dr. Nagy
 
recounts the faculty's experience of developing a curriculum as
 
follows:
 
We found that nothing was available for once-a-week
 
teaching methodology, for Hungarian as a second
 
language, nor for Hungarian as a first language, which
 
i
t was for many of the students who spoke fluent
 
Hungarian because they were sons and daughters of
 
parents who came out four or five years ago from
 
Hungary .
 .
 .
 but once-a-week methodology i
s quite
 
difficult.  (ES82-SN-C6, I
,  1
,  153-159)
 
Commenting further on this aspect of the school's history, Dr. Nagy
 
relates:
 
Of course, the material available from Hungary was so
 
filled with propaganda, and was geared .
 .
 .
 for
 
everyday teaching methodology —it was useless. We did
 
two things: we as teachers, on one hand, had to put
 
together, search, and find .
 .
 .
 and create our own
 
teaching material, including books, which were
 
non-existent; on the other hand, we had to  start  a
 
larger research to see whether there is similar
 
Hungarian instruction anywhere else, outside of
 
Hungary.  .
 .
 .
 What we frequently did was to try to
 
purchase, ask, borrow, find, research all sorts of
 
material for Hungarian children from Hungary, as well
 
as anywhere else, and we started to select out of that
 
available pool .
 .
 .
 photocopying it, writing it out
 
•
 .
 .
 I remember Schmidt Panni's husband, who draws
 
well,  .
 .
 .
 drew the first sheets for teaching the
 
youngsters the alphabet.  .
 .
 Schmidt Panni was using
 
those sheets .
 .
 •
 she was xeroxing them .
 .
 .
 .
 I was
 
also trying to reasearch available material from all
 
sorts of books from my own library, from the library
 
others, from old textbooks, children's books .
 
tried to put i
t together,  .
 .
 .
 and by the end of the
 
year we had an awful lot of material .
 
(Es82-sN-C6, I
, 1 223-260)
 
Naturally,  this was only a temporary solution to the problem of
 
lack of suitable materials for students with a language proficiency in
 
Hungarian as varied as the number of students enrolled. A much larger
 
and more comprehensive effort was needed to develop curriculum
 
materials suited to this unique pedagogical situation.
 
The first "era" in the history of the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
(
1960-1967) was characterized by a continuing increase in the number of
 
registered students from forty-four in 1960 to one hundred and sixteen
 
in 1
967. The increase in enrollment suggests that the Hungarian
 
community realized the importance of maintaining a Hungarian school and
 
the value of the systematic transmission of Hungarian culture to their
 
children.
 
Increased enrollments demanded a change in all aspects of managing
 
the school, affected the curriculum, and altered the methodology used
 
by the teachers. In the face of increased enrollments the school
 
administrators established new classes and restructured the old ones,
 
5
 
grouping s
tudents by age and language proficiency.  Such accommodation
 
continued to be made each year when there was a significant change in
 
the s
tudent body.
 
The location of the Hungarian school remained basically the same. All
 
the buildings housing the school were located on the Rutgers campus in
 
New Brunswick; the two main buildings u
sed for the longest length of
 
time were the Ballantine Building and Frelinghuysen Hall.
 
A research project was launched in the 1
963-1964 school year
 
through the combined efforts of the American Hungarian Studies
 
Foundation and the Hungarian University students in North America. Its
 
purpose was to locate, contact, and describe other Hungarian schools in
 
the United States with the hope that the school administrators would be
 
able to get together later, exchange experiences, and learn from one
 
another. They completed the project in 1
965 and published the results
 
as "Hungarian Schools in the United States" in The Slavic and East
  
European Journal. The study sparked the interest of many, including the
 
renowned music theoretician and composer, Zolt an Kodaly, founder of the
 
Kodaly Method. Kodaly wrote about the twenty-three Hungarian-American
 
schools Nagy located in an article published in Magyar Hrrek, a daily
 
newspaper in Hungary, on November 1
5,  1
965.
 
6
 
A $400 scholarship was also established in the 1
963-19b4 school
 
year by the Hungarian Alumni Association.  It i
s for Hungarian-American
 
students who complete the Hungarian Saturday Classes and pursue their
 
university studies at Rutgers or Douglass University in New Brunswick,
 
New Jersey.
 
During the 1964-1965 academic year a major concern surfaced which
 
would be a continuous care for the staff and administrators of the
 
school throughout its history--the loss of students and their
 
replacement. Kindergarten was perceived as the key to assuring
 
continued school attendance, since the little ones were liable t
o
 
continue as students of the Hungarian school, replacing the older
 
students who were leaving. By realizing the problem of student loss and
 
applying positive organizational work, the kindergarten reported an
 
increase in attendance during the 1
964-1965 school year.
 
Between 1967 and 1
974 the school weathered its crucial years,
 
brought on by unfortunate medical problems experienced by members of
 
the administration. Children enrolled dropped from one hundred and
 
sixteen to sixty-two in the 1
967-1968 school year. Later, a growi:
 
opposition within the Hungarian-American community toward the schoo
 
caused the number of registered students to dwindle to forty by 1
974.
 
During these years the structure of the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
remained essentially identical to that in previous years, inspite of
 
there being fewer students. The school was only maintained at full
 
strength for two years during this period--in 1
968 the enrollment
 
numbered ninety-nine and totalled one hundred and nine in 1970.
 
7
 
The location of the kindergarten was moved t
o the Washington
 
School on French S
treet in New Brunswick during this period, where it
 
remained until the 1977-1978 school year. The school's choir,
 
consisting of twenty-one students, was formed in 1
969, under director
 
Jenc Adan.  A new class was also added between 1967 and 1974 —the
 
organized instruction of folk art in theory and practice. The class
 
instructs students on folk motifs, as well as the various stitches and
 
patterns of embroidery characteristic of different regions of Hungary.
 
The fifteenth anniversary of the Hungarian Saturday Classes in
 
1
974 coincided with the regeneration of the student body, and a revival
 
was sensed within the school. The school began the year with fifty-four
 
registered students and completed the year with ninety-nine
 
Hungarian-American youngsters enrolled.
 
The third decade of Hungarian Saturday Classes promises to follow
 
the tradition set during the 1960s and 1970s. The twenty-second year of
 
instruction (
1981-1982) was dedicated to the remembrance of the 1
00th
 
anniversary of the death of the 19th-century Hungarian poet Janos
 
Arany, coupled with the celebration of the 100th birthday of Zolt1i
 
Kodaiy.

9bUs, a
fter the publication of the results of i
i
 
research project on Hungarian schools in this country, Dr. Nagy began
 
organizing his efforts to bring about a badly need conference of
 
Hungarian schools. Recalling his work at that time, Dr. Nagy says:
 
I have duplicated this published material and sent it t
o
 
them [
the other Hungarian-American schools]  to
 
organize a get-together, a conference of sorts at
 
Rutgers University. That conference never materialized
 
because of the huge distances that these people would
 
have to travel on their own monies .
 •
 .
 .
 Parallel to
 
that, I have sent this material .
 .
 .
 to Hungarian
 
leaders .
 .
 .
 cultural leaders in Hungary whom I
 
know--Zoltan Kodaly, Mihaly Vaci, and to Gyula
 
Lllyes —and they started to respond .
 .
 .
 .
 First of
 
all, we started a correspondence with Mihaly Vaci. I
 
sent him all sorts of materials; he encouraged me.
 
• But they also started to work on the Hungarian
 
academe and professionals .
 .
 .
 because I proposed to
 
them: why don't they help us organize some kind of
 
conference? .
 .
 .
 Finally, they have succeeded in
 
pushing things so far that in 1
970 the first such
 
conference was organized by a body of Hungarian
 
scholars and officials at Lajos Kossuth University in
 
Debrecen [Hungary], and at that time this loose
 
organization received the name of Anyanyelvi
 
Konferencia--Native Language Conference-- .
 .
 .
 and
 
that organization exists ever since.  .
 
(Es82-sN-c6, I
, 1
, 306-330)
 
Opposition within the Hungarian-American community disappeared in
 
1970, when the first Native Language Conference occurred, notes
 
A second school was established in response, "which we viewed as a
 
partly desirable state of affairs because, instead of having one
 
Hungarian school, it is better to have two, no matter who s
tarts [
it]
 
and why," says Nagy.  (ES82-SN-C6, I
, 2
, 202-204)

The Native Language Conference took place in the summer of
 
1970. It apparently caught many people unawares.  "They didn't know
 
quite what to make of i
t," says  
 
At the week-long conference Dr. Nagy proposed a program whicri
 
included the cooperative writing of Hungarian-language textbooks f
or
 
American students. The proposal was accepted, and the Hungarian
 
scholars proclaimed that they would write the textbooks for the
 
Hungarian schools,  to which Nagy vigorously protested.  "He barraged
 
them with letters saying that we are just not going t
o teach those
 
books that will be written by people sitting at their desks in
 
Budapest. What we have t
o do absolutely is have the textbook writers
 
see the medium, the population .
 .
 .  survey the population for whom
 
they are writing the textbooks," recalls -
-
-
.
 (ES82-SN-C6, II, 1
,
 
377-382) Dr. Nagy countered with a proposal for overcoming the lack of
 
exposure to American culture on the part of the proposed Hungarian
 
writers, and soon enough the three textbook authors  were in the United
 
States for two months.
 
They began their work immediately by visiting Hungarian-American
 
schools in the New Jersey area, including the Passaic Catholic School,
 
which at that time offered instruction everyday in Hugarian.
 
They taped the pronunciation patterns of the children, interviewed
 
parents and teachers, and collected old and new curriculum materials.
 
The writers also visited American schools, since it was equally
 
important to witness what the children were exposed to during the week.
 
At American public and private schools they interviewed teachers,
 
1
0
 
took notes, and gathered American textbooks to learn more about the
 
methodologies used to teach in this country. They visited schools in
 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Canada before flying back to
 
Budapest to begin working on the Hungarian-language textbooks designed
 
for American children.
 
Back in Budapest the t
extbook writers began working on the book
 
for intermediate students. The format had been agreed upon earlier' - the
 
textbooks would be accompanied by workbooks, cassette tapes, and
 
teacher's manuals. There would be four levels or sets of teaching
 
materials initially.  It had been stressed and agreed upon at the outset
 
that the materials would not contain a bit of propaganda:  in the event
 
that a trace of it were found in the books, they would be rejected
 
immediately.
 
The most difficult phase of the work was introducing the newly
 
written material. The textbook writers sent their manuscripts chapter
 
by chapter to the Hungarian Saturday Classes. The material was then
 
taken into the classrooms, put to the test with the Hungarian-American
 
children, commented on, revised, and returned to Budapest through the
 
mail. This tedious but rewarding task went on for a number of years,
 
until the books were completed and published.
 
The books were put t
o use immediately at the Hungarian Saturday
 
Classes. The Passaic Hungarian School in Passaic, New Jersey was also
 
one of the first Hungarian-American schools to use the books prepared
 
through the joint efforts of Dr. Nagy, the Hungarian school, and the
 
1
1
 
Native Language Conference. Today the books are being used at more and
 
more Hungarian-American schools.
 
The curriculum, grade levels, and methods of instruction in an
 
ethnic school such as the Hungarian Saturday Classes is predetermined,
 
in a sense, by the composition of the student body. The variety of
 
students, classified according to their language proficiency, in turn
 
is influenced by historical, environmental, and social factors. The
 
1956 Hungarian Revolution "recharged" the pool of Hungarians living
 
outside Hungary.  In New Brunswick this brought on the establishment of
 
a Hungarian school and altered the composition of other
 
Hungarian-American schools already in existence. By comparison, only a
 
low level immigration of Hungarians to the United States has taken
 
place since that time, and the level of students with a native-language
 
proficiency in Hungarian participating in the school program has
 
decreased. Today there are more and more Hungarian-American children
 
enrolling in the school who do not speak a word of Hungarian.
 
The number of students enrolled in the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
fluctuates annually, directly influencing the levels of instruction and
 
material offered by the school. The Hungarian proficiency of
 
each student is assessed at the beginning of the school year. On the
 
basis of their knowledge of Hungarian, age, and other personal
 
considerations, the students are placed into the classes most
 
advantageous for their development. As Susan Csergo explains, the
 
children were divided according to:
 
1
2
 
their age and language proficiency .
 .
 .
 .
 Many times
 
there were difficulties .
 .
 .
 for example, a
 
six-year-old child had the language proficiency of a
 
nine-year-old .
 .
 .
 but the opposite also happened. We
 
knew that children do not like to be in the same class
 
with younger children .
 .
 .
 but sometimes a
 
nine-year-old did have to be in the same class with
 
six-year-olds. This, in turn, motivated the child to
 
study a bit more to be able to progress to the higher
 
class with his or her friends .
 .
 .
 .
 (ES82-SN-C12,  1
,
 
248-261)
 
Usually four levels of language and literature instruction are
 
formed:  the beginner, intermediate I and II, and advanced level.
 
Hungarian is taught as a foreign language in a class for children and
 
another for adults. The kindergarten stands as a separate entity.
 
Hungarian folk art is taught to the s
tudent body as a whole.
 
The subjects which are continuously taught at the Hungarian
 
Saturday Classes are:
 
Basics of Hungarian reading and writing
 
Hungarian language I and II
 
Hungarian language and literature
 
Hungarian geography
 
Hungarian history
 
Hungarian as a foreign language I and II
 
Hungarian folk arts (song, dance, embroidery, and
 
woodcarving)
 
e subjects are taught to all students on various levels, adjusted t
o
 
capabilities and previous knowledge of each c
lass.

Presently,  the core of the curriculum t
aught a
t the Hungarian
 
Saturday Classes i
s contained in the following textbooks:
 
The students of Hungarian study for four hours each Saturday from
 
9 A.M.  to I P.M.,  and are tested throughout the school year. They
 
receive report cards at their graduation ceremonies. This practice
 
generally serves as motivation for the students and is symbolic in
 
special program prepared by the faculty and students for their parents
 
The Christmas program was instituted by Miklos Csergo. His wife
 
Susan recalls:
 
The s
tudents were joyous about the Christmas holiday
 
. . and we passed on t
o them the Hungarian spirit of
 
Christmas . . . . This also became cultural education
 
1
4
 
for the whole Hungarian community .
 .
 .
 .  Through
 
these programs and plays they [
the parents and
 
friends] enjoyed seeing the development and the
 
knowledge of their children, and were all happy that
 
the Christmas holiday was celebrated in a family
 
spirit, bringing back their memories of childhood.
 
After the program all the students received a little
 
present brought by the baby Jesus. In Hungary he is
 
the bearer of gifts .
 .
 .  and this concluded the
 
ceremonies.  (ES82-SN-C12,  1
,  1
17-147)
 
The two Hungarian national holidays observed are October 2
3 and
 
March 1
5. The anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution is observed
 
in autumn with a solemn program of relevant poems and excerpts from
 
letters and historical documents. The Hungarian War for Freedom in 1848
 
i
s commemorated in the spring with a literary and folk program. A large
 
portion of the Hungarian ethnic community takes part in these
 
observances. One of the teachers who worked with the children for six
 
years in preparing and practicing for these programs is Magda Eszlari.
 
She explains the pedagogical benefits of such programs:
 
Even though the children have to work very hard at
 
overcoming [
linguistic] difficulties in preparing for a
 
program, I feel that it is extremely useful .
 .
 .
 .  And
 
even though it takes away much time from formal
 
teaching,  that which a child learns at this time will
 
be remembered .
 .
 .  he has invested more work into
 
[
it], especially when he experiences success .
 .
 .
 
And because he is performing in front of an audienc€,
 
he will remember [
the poems, etc.]  to a greater ext
 
There is Hungarian school every week, but there
 
are only two, three programs a year.  (ES82-SN-C11,  1

Volunteer teachers and instructors from the community pass on
 
their knowledge of the culture and language of their ancestors at the
 
Hungarian Saturday Classes. Some of the teachers are trained
 
1
6
 
professionals who speak Hungarian and are familiar with the h
eritage,
 
of the ethnic community, and others are amateurs. The trained
 
professionals received their diplomas either in Hungary or the United
 
States. The most advantageous situation for the students, of course, is
 
an instructor who is dually trained.
 
School administrators have made every effort t
o maintain a h
igh
 
quality in the staff, as well as in teaching materials. "Right from t
 
beginning .
 .
 .
 we wanted to establish the fact that this school was
 
going to be a professional effort .
 .
 .
 ,
"
 says Dr. Nagy.  "We selected
 
teachers who had their teaching diplomas from Hungary.  .
 .
 .
 We tried
 
to maintain it so that our teachers indeed would be qualified teachers.
 
In the subsequent years, some of the teachers had dual training .
 
.
" (Es82-SN-c6, I,  1
,  187-221)
 
During the school's first year the teaching staff included Mrs.
 
Bela Schmidt, who taught Hungarian reading and writing to the
 
elementary class. In addition, Dr. Karoly Nagy taught Hungarian
 
language and literature and Dr. B la Gyengd' lectured on the most
 
important features of Hungarian history in the advanced class. The
 
Hungarian kindergarten was led by Mrs. Andras Rockenstein during the
 
second semester.
 
The first small expansion of the school program took place in the
 
second school year (
1961-1962), when two lecturers were invited to
 
speak to the history class: Joseph Held and Andras Rockenstein. An
 
organized series of monthly lectures, the Sz chenyi Seminar, was
 
1
7
 
initiated for the students in the advanced classes during the 1
963-1964
 
school year. These university-level lectures were presented by
 
Hungarian professors teaching at North American universities: Dr.
 
Andra
's Alf'ldi, Dr. Istvai Foltinyi, and Dr. Miklos Harsa yi from
 
Princeton University; Dr. K
oly Henkey from Montreal University; Dr.
 
Andras Pogáiy of Seton Hall University; and August J
. Moln
 from
 
Rutgers University. The lecturers discussed Hungarian archeology,
 
history, music, and literature.
 
There were new teachers added to the faculty of the school in
 
1974, among them Magda Eszl ri, Mr. and Mrs.  Somogyi, and Melinda
 
Hoffmann.
 
The years between 1
974 and 1980 were marked in general by the
 
cohesion of the Hungarian Saturday Classes with the Hungarian ethnic
 
)
mnlunity and brought about developments such as mini-conferences
 
tween the teachers and the Parent Teachers Association (PTA). These
 
nterences soon expanded. In 1976 the Hungarian school's faculty held
 
a teacher conference at Rutgers University which brought together the
 
t
eachers of Hungarian from the East Coast. The instructors shared their
 
experiences and discussed the many hardships of keeping the Hungarian
 
schools alive and maintaining the Hungarian language.
 
In 1
977 the faculty and staff of the Hungarian Saturday Classes
 
visited the Passaic Hungarian School in Passaic, New Jersey to discuss
 
pedagogical and methodological issues. The third conference of
 
the American Hungarian Educators' Association paid a visit to the
 
1
8
 
Hungarian Saturday Classes in April 1
978, during which Hungarian-
language teachers from Chicago and Passaic demonstrated their teaching
 
methods to the faculty in the classrooms of the Hungarian school in New
 
Brunswick.
 
By the late 1
970s the Hungarian Saturday Classes of the Hungarian
 
Alumni Association had become very well known to interested Hungarians
 
throughout the world. Professional educators, poets, writers,
 
historians, and journalists visited the classrooms to witness ethnic
 
history in the making in New Brunswick. Professionals interested in the
 
maintenance of Hungarian heritage and the science of teaching foreign
 
languages arrived at the school from many points in the United States
 
and Europe, and their impact was much more permanent than ever
 
imagined. Some writers and poets returned to their homes and recorded
 
their impressions in novels, articles, and poems. Several sent copies
 
back to the Hungarian Saturday Classes as a token of appreciation and
 
expression of respect for the teachers, students, and
 r
t
 
sacrifice so much to maintain their heritage and langui
 
States.
 
School Administration
 
The administrative, managerial, and organizational work at the
 
Hungarian school is performed by a director and administrator. The
 
individuals selected to assume these positions are members of the
 
Hungarian Alumni Association. The positions of school director and
 
1
9
 
administrator were assumed by Susan and Miklos Csergo in the summer of
 
1974. The Czergos continued their administration of the school until the
 
end of the 1
979-1980 school year. The administrative work was done by
 
Eva Fekete and Zsigmond Nemeth for the forty-four students enrolled in
 
1
981.
 
The work of administering the school needs to be done all year
 
round and is extremely diverse. The following outline provides on
 
overview of the four areas in which thorough, consistent, and dedicated
 
work must be done to run a successful school.

Susan Csergo' feels that the key to the administrative success
 
experienced by her and her husband was the excellent relationship
 
between the Hungarian-American community and the parents, children,
 
faculty, and staff of the school.  "This is what transformed the school
 
into a micro - community  a large family where everyone felt at home, and
 
felt welcome .
 .
 .
 the childern, the parents, and the teachers, "
 she
 
explains. "And the way to achieve this was by systematic organizational
 
work throughout the year." (ES82-SN-c12,  1
, 83 114)
 
After a six years of the responsibilities outlined above
 
however, both of them found themselves nearly exhausted. "If we would
 
not have had to worry about the financial aspects of running the school
 
it would have b
'
 
een  a lot  easier!
" notes
 Mrs.
 Csergo
 "
 
. The great amount
 
have been saved .
 .
 .
 .  Many sleepless hours were spent worrying about
 
the school's financial difficulties. A lot of time would have been
 
saved .. . ... (ES82-sN-c12, 2
,  197-223)
 
Parents
 
The importance of parent-teacher meetings for the Hungarian school
 
was realized in the early years, and there were two or three PTA
 
meetings held each school year. The parents were always encouraged to
 
take •
part in the classroom instruction and the final examinations, to
 
monitor the progress of their children and the quality of material
 
taught. A good relationship between the children, teachers, parents,
 
and community has always been one of the school's goals.
 
The parents of the students attending an ethnic school come from
 
a variety of backgrounds. They may be either recent immigrants or
 
members of the first, second, or,  in some cases, the third generation
 
of their ethnic group. The motivation for sending their children to an
 
ethnic school varies from family to family. Steven Jurcsek, who sends
 
three of his children to the Hungarian Saturday Classes, elaborates on
 
their specific case:
 
At home the language is not really spoken. My wife i
s
 
not Hungarian .
 .
 .  .  Yet, I do want to have them share
 
my belief for the Hungarian language, my love for the
 
country where I was born, and which I had to leave .
 
I would like to pass something down to them .
 .
 .
 
Therefore,  I feel that even if they will not speak the
 
language perfectly,  they will learn about the language,
 
history,  and some Hungarian songs  . . . . I feel that
 
the passing down of all these values will make them
 
views about transmitting knowledge about her heritage.  It is vital
 
"because you cannot be a good American if you deny that which you once
 
Susan Csergo 
"
 , former director of the school,  expresses similar
 
The child will feel that he or she belongs somewhere,
 
and will be able to identity his or her roots  . . . .
 
It is also important in that the children will be able
 
to understand their parents somewhat better,  those
 
people who cannot become fully American . . . and they
 
will know a little about their heritage  . . . .
 
The more practical aspects of learning another language are
 
expressed by Marianne Muszka.  "You are as many people as the number ;
)f
 
languages you know. We would like to have our children study other
 
languages later on, not only Hungarian."  (ES82-SN-C9,  1
,  193-197) Magda
 
Eszlari, a teacher at the Hungarian school,  feels "My knowledge is at
 
hand, and I feel that learning only makes a person more valuable . . .
 
there are many gems in Hungarian literature,  art,  and culture that are
 
worth passing on."  (ES82-SN-CII,  1
,  210-224) Deneice Oroszvary, an
 
American woman married to a Hunga rian and .
 learning 
1
 
herself,  feels - it is worthwhile to be connected to something .
 
-
 
do not fit in the American community anymore

There are equally varied opinions regarding non-participation in
 
an organized cultural effort, such as an ethnic language school, or in
 
other forms of ethnic activity. The shortage of time and energy is a
 
primary cause of non-participation; so too are personal, social, and
 
ideological reasons, as well as general disinterest. Marianne Muszka
 
she took her youngest daughter out of Hungarian school:  "She had
 
difficulty distinguishing between the two languages in first grade. We
 
decided to take her out until she had the basics of English down and
 
was ready to accept formal instruction in Hungarian. She will be
 
returning next year." (ES82-SN-C9,  1
, 28-39)
 
Active participation in the Hungarian Saturday Classes requires
 
time, dedication, and financial commitments on the part of the parents
 
and children involved. A free Saturday morning could very well be spent
 
doing other important activities. Many parents who send their children
 
to Hungarian school manage to get some of their tasks done on Saturday
 
morning, but others stay at the school and speak with the teachers,
 
directors, and other parents, utilizing this time for social activity.
 
Whatever the case, a portion of each Saturday is dedicated to their
 
children and their Hungarian heritage.
 
Students
 
Finally, a few words from the students, the children who are the
 
subjects of the entire program directed toward Hungarian heritage
 
maintenance. Most of them do seem to mind giving up cartoons, sports
 
24
 
activities, and sleeping in on Saturday morning to learn Hungarian.
 
They seem to have become accustomed t
o sacrificing their leisure t
ime
 
on the weekend and during the week to learn Hungarian, however.  Many
 
have also learned to make an extra effort to speak only Hungarian in
 
the home. As one youngster commented, "It sounds 'weird'  if I speak to
 
my parents in English." (ES82-SN-05,  1
,  1
18-120).
 
Bernadette Muszka, a former student at the school, left because
 
she became interested in many of the activities offered by the weekday
 
school she was attending. Reflecting on the years she did partake in
 
Hungarian instruction she says,  "I like to say that I miss going thee.
 
It is an empty space when it comes to Saturday mornings." (ES82-SN-CIO,
 
1
,  106-110)
 
The students who continue to make an effort to attend the school
 
and learn the language formally enjoy the luxuries of knowing another
 
language. "We can speak with our friends and no one will understand
 
us," says one.  (ES82-SN-c5,  1
, 68-92). Another comments,  "I feel good
 
about myself .
 .
 .  and feel big that I know something my friends do
 
not.  .
 .
 .  And when I come home I have another life to live."
 
Another benefit the school offers is the opportunity to make other
 
friends and acquire a true sense of belonging. As Esther Pigniczky
 
says,  "When I go tg Hungarian Scouts, right away I have a million
 
friends.English." (ES82-SN-05,  1
,  1
18-120).
