Oscar Wilde Fresh, 
A ClIARACTER SONG. 
Wr tten and sung by Billy Moore. in Moore and Vivian's 
I.ate$t and Greatest Success, Fresh the Artist. 
I 
am an artist and chromes I 
paint, 
in the greatest style ever you saw; 
You give me a 
handcart or a 
check on a 
bank, 
And I'll show you how well I 
can draw, 
My pictures the ladies admire very much, 
I'm immense in whatever I 
do; 
And with them I 
flirt and all do declare, 
Oscar Wilde Fresh is too, too. 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
baby, some call me a 
lady, 
But I 
honestly tell them I 
ain't; 
But I'm just like the girls with false teeth and owls, 
We both are great dealers in paint. 
Now down to the sea shore in summer I 
go, 
The ocean and beach for to sketch; 
But the ladies attention I 
sooner would draw, 
And try hard a 
mash for to catch. 
To the last exibition a 
picture I 
sent, 
Of an Indian on the war path, 
They scalped the poor red man and put him 
on the roof, 
Chorus. 
So judge of my horror and wrath,

Will You Club Me When I'm Old. 
A 
Double Song, rendered by the greot Sketch Artists, 
Moore and Vivian. 
HE. 
My own sweet Birdie darling, 
We're married and we're done, 
And when I 
think of it, 
I'm sorry that it's done. 
But then I 
cannot help it, 
Even if I 
am badly sold, 
I 
ask you but one question, 
Will you club me when 
old. 
SHE. 
Billy darling, Billy darling, 
Sad and cruel is the task, 
But I'll give a 
truthful answer, 
To the question that you ask. 
When a 
man gets old and feeble, 
Of course true love gets cold, 
Only do now what I 
tell you 
And I 
won't club you when you're old. 
11E. 
Tell me darling, tell me darling, 
I 
am anxious for to hear. 
SHE. 
You must never work free lunches, 
And come home chock full of beer. 
HE. 
But if down seven flight of stairs, 
Loading schooners I 
had rolled, 
SHE. 
Then I 
would take a 
red hot stove, 
And club you when you're old.

Sweet Young Estelle. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Performed by Belle Vivian, of Moore & 
with great euecess. 
In a 
quiet country vill9ge, 
There dwells a 
pretty maid, 
in a 
quiet little cottage, 
Where the oak trees cast their shade, 
She is sweeter, she is fairer, 
Than any city belle. 
There is no treasure rarer 
Than my rustic queen Estelle, 
The image of her pretty face, 
In my heart will ever dwell, 
My own rustic (peen, 
My sweet young Estelle. 
When the summer birds are singing, 
Their blithe and merry song, 
I 
ramble with this little maiden, 
And leave the noisy throng. 
The cuckoo to his mate is cooing, 
To her my tale of love I 
tell, 
For my heart she has captivated, 
Has my sweet young Estelle. 
In an ivy covered cottage, 
By a 
babbling brook we'll dwell, 
I'll live in peace and harmony, 
With my sweet young Estelle.

The Poor Girl cried Her Eyes Out. 
Clarence McCann. 
A DrIII.ESQUE IZECITA.TION. 
Dcliverel by the irrepressible eccentric, Billy Moore. 
Angelina Concertina Too Fresh, 
Lives on catp:t tacks; 
She asked an Italian barber, 
To cut her Lair with an ax. 
Her masher, Augustus Gum Drop, 
Tried to kiss her rosey cheeks, 
The white wash and red paint on them, 
Made hint sick for weeks, 
Yet tile por girl cried her eyes out. 
She had a 
lot of trauple, 
This poor dear a gelie soul, 
They wrapped an American flag around her, 
And used her for a 
harber's pole. 
She eloped with a 
happy Ifotentot, 
Named Wall-hoo-wun-tun-ching, 
When she got six weeks on the island, 
Instead of a 
wedding ring. 
'Twas only a 
thousand years after, 
She said she was swept sixteen, 
She married a 
s-ng and dance man, 
Gus OT,ce nag. crine. 
But he had s.x 
wives in Texas, 
And twelve IL ore ont in Kalamazoo, 
He sailed over to IIobol; en, England, 
in her little number twelve shoe, 
No wonder the poor girl cried her eyes out. 
AN IIIISIt SONG. 
Sung by the Ver6atileCimechan Billy .iNloore, 
When man is good looking, 
Just like Illy sweet self, 
It is hard h 
)

Or put him upou the shelf 
The ladies to rel&imso hint,

Well I

Down the alley or street,

And faith I

On the as

Now I 
would soon get married,

Faith if she caught me mashing. 
Jane, Susannah .,

S 
BABY DIED ONE YEAR AGO TO-DAY. 
Compliments of M. O'REARDON to NED BARRY, and sang by him with 
great success at the Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow; 
For on this day my infant died, 
This day one year ago; 
A 
tender bud so beautiful, 
So fragile, pure and fair; 
Its fragrance far too sweet to waste, 
On earth's sin- tainted air; 
Through many sad, long hours of pain, 
My precious darling lay; 
Then God in sweet compassion took, 
My little one away; 
As cold and rigid in my arms, 
His lifeless form was placed; 
Such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced. 
CHORUS: 
Baby died one year ago to-day, 
Baby died one year ago to-day; 
Baby died, Baby died, 
Baby died one year ago to-day. 
In meek submission low, 
I 
bowed to God's allwise decree ; 
He only took unto himself, 
The one he gave to me; 
And yet I 
never see a 
babe, 
But scalding tears will start; 
And longingly I 
crave to clasp, 
My 
lost one to my heart; 
If I, my future home could choose, 
In realms where glory reigns; 
I'd ask to dwell with Angel babes, 
Ever singing Heavenly strains; 
For sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow; 
For on this day my baby died. 
This day one year ago.

Oh! You Beauty, oh! You Dear.

Sheet music to this or any song in this book on receipt of 
40 cents, either in cash or postage stamps. 
You see that I'm a 
ladie's man, 
The girls get struck on my clothes, 
It costs ten thousand dollars a 
year, 
To color up my nose. 
Some people think that I 
am Vanderbilt, 
And on Fifth Avenue dwell, 
The ladies buy the photograph 
Of Paddy the dandy swell. 
Spoken.—Mysclf and lady attended the 431st. an. 
nal reception of the Dog-Catcher's Association, and it 
was six o',Iock in the morning when we parted, just as 
we were saying good-bye she threw her arms around me 
and said— 
Cnonus. 
! 
you beauty, oh 
you dear, 
Take me out somewhere and buy me some beer, 
While you have money, I'll treat you fine. 
I 
live on Mott Street, at four-forty-nine. 
I 
move in the best society. 
That's in the county jail, 
Frenoh brandy, and Champagny too, 
I 
guzzle by the pail. 
Among the Wall Street Bulls and Bears, 
My stocks and bonds I 
sell, 
I 
draw checks on a 
sand bank, boys, 
For I'm the dandy swell. 
Spoken.—Notwithstanding I've been married seven 
times in the last three years. I'm willing to get slaugh-
tered again. 
The last one I 
courted was a 
red-headed 
widow of fifty summers, and Heaven knows how many 
winters. 
She owned three lots in a 
cemetery, and if I 
married her I'd have been sure of one of them, one day 
I 
got into trouble with her brother. 
He took me up on 
the roof and dropped me off. 
1 
picked myself up and 
began te scrape the mud off my clothes, when she stuck 
her head, out of the window and said.

CARDINAL RED AND NAVY BLUE, 
sung by Miss ELOISE LINDON. 
I 
am a 
girl of style you see, 
And everywhere I 
go, 
Some fellows always follow me 
If I 
walk fast or slow. 
Perhaps they think my heart is true, 
Or I 
have lots of cash, 
Or its cardinal red or navy blue 
I 
wear with such a 
dash. 
CHORUS. (Waltz.) 
When I 
walk out at 3 
P. M., 
To take the bracing air, 
I'm sure to meet a 
score of men, 
Always at me stare. 
I 
hear them say, I 
wonder who 
That daisy there can be, 
In the cardinal red and navy blue, 
Whom we so often see. 
Some say that I'm a 
fashion plate, 
Cut from a 
magazine, 
Others, I'm a 
counterpart 
Of some young foreign queen. 
But then I 
never mind the cut, 
But go right straight ahead, 
In my cardinal red and navy blue, 
To which I'm really wed. 
When I 
walk out,

THE OLD HOMESTEAD. 
Written by ED. AUSTIN for the H AYLES. 
We dearly lope the old homestead, 
There we've passed happy hours; 
Out in the scented clover fields, 
Among the hay and flowers. 
We love the lane where daisies grow, 
And buttercups of gold; 
But more than all the dear old home, 
Moss cornered, plain and old. 
Cnonus: 
Happy and contented we will be, 
Merry as the birds that sing in the tree; 
Our love of home don't scorn, 
For here we both were born; 
And we love to hear the rustle of the golden rye 
Near the fields of waving cr‘rn. 
We think that now it's time to go, 
Our team is hitched out there; 
Our parents who have gone on ahead, 
We'll follow to the fair. 
These country fairs we understand, 
Take place but once a 
year; 
We'll go and see the sights to-day, 
And then we'll come back here.

Our Jack's come home from sea to-day, 
And brown and ly onzed is he, 
For many a

From his home his love and me. 
Yet his heart is true as it was of yore,

When he came home to-day. 
You little know the joy we felt, 
When he came home to day.

To make his Nell his bride; 
With loving faith she ne'er despaired, 
Though hope with us died. 
Yet her eyes grew dim, her cheek grew pale, 
She slowly pined away,

Her Jack's come home to-day,

Music by EDDIE FOIL 
sung with great success by Eva BENNE41. 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Tis a 
letter that I've treasured many years: 
Oh, how often I 
have read those fading lines, 
And over them there's traces of my tears; 
She sent to me her blessisg in that missive, 
To see me was her constant prayer; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
Is a 
lock of my angel mother's hair. 
I've a

A

The little lock of gray in this old letter,

letter that was written long ago, 
That was sent to me across the stormy sea; 
When 'mong strangers I 
was wandering far 4way, 
And longing home again to ever be. 
But underneath the sod my mother's sleeping, 
She's free from earthly trials and its care; 
Butever next my heart I'll keep herletterl 
And the lock of my ;-inisel mother's lin5T.

THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHILD. 
Sung by Tom DIN:ON at the San Francisco MinstreLs, and made 
Popular by JAMES O'NEIL. 
The fisherman and his child are drowned, 
Came ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around ; 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk-white sails I 
see. 
(Repeat last 2 
lineal.) 
0110RITS: 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard 
As they sank in the deep; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep, 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep. 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair: Thy will be done! 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.) 
And when the storms ceased, the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore, 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore,

As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
In death they found him there.

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
*.s sung with great success by Tow ASTOR. The greatest and 
most popular song iit gew York. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing, 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth; 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list' and I'll give you an Irishman's toast. 
CHORUS: 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
(Chorus). 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been replaced, 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host; 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest 
And his wife has dose' ted her post; 
Ring Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot. 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze, 
(Chorus),

THE LITTLE ONES AT HOME. 
da sung with great success by GEG. W . 
I 
am thinking now of home among my native hills, 
And though afar through distant lands I 
roam, 
The memories of the past my heart with longing fills, 
To see the darling little ones at home. 
Au ! now their forms I 
seem to see, 
Far o'er the rolling ocean's foam, 
And hear their voices ringing in merry childish glee, 
On! I 
long to sec the little ones at home. 
The little ones at home, the little ones at home, 
I

And hear their voices ringing in merry childish gb 
Oh! I

LAST TIME. 
Soon shall I 
hear yonr voices in merry childish glee 
Proclaim the joyous welcome welcome home. 
The moon looks mildly down the same as oft. before, 
And bathes the earth in floods of mellow light, 
But its beams are not so bright upon this lonely shore, 
As they seemed at home one year ago to night. 
Sadly my heart still turns to thee, 
Wherever I 
may chance to roam, - 
I 
hear your voices ringing in merry childish glee ; 
Oh ! 1 
long to see the little ones at home. 
The little ones at liter; ete, 
May guardian angels still their vigils o'er thee keep„ 
May heaven's choicest blessings on thee rest, 
Till 1 
am safely borne across the stormy deep, 
And meet again with those i 
love the best. 
Soon, soon your faces I 
shall see, 
Never, never more nom thee to roam, 
soon shall I 
Lear your voices in merry childish vIcI. 
Proclaim the i0VOLIS WeieQuie, welcome nome.

Many Can Help One. 
Sung with great succuss by H ARRY RIZ:11MONID, 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time. 
And some I 
believe to be true ; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you ; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world. 
And assistance you can't give him any 
Remember that many can always help one 
Where one cannot always help many, 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress. 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say. 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want ; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
his rich friends they all pass him, by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. ( Cho.) 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year 
The next one be wretched and poor ; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up 
But has sunk down to poverty's door ; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. (Cho.) 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to- night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place 
A man may be poor but still honest be 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace , 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart 
No knowing when the tide it may turn • 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And you.. 1,:indness he's sure to return. 
(Cho.?

The Contrniling Influence of Drink. 
A ILI.. ,us Recitation by E D. HARRIGAN. 
IN a 
tenement brick, 
Where the families were thick. 
Lived McMullen, a 
poor little tailor, 
Although he was small 
At a 
party or a 
ball, 
lie was nimble and light as a 
sailor., 
As a 
man, he was quiet, 
Kept out of a 
riot, 
in 
was red as a 
pink, 
And when he got full, 
He was like a 
mad bull, 
From the controlling influence of taint. 
Whin the wf..1 begun 
lie followed the drum, 
In the Sixty-ninth Regiment, a 
soldier, 
lie went to the front 
The rebels to hunt, 
The devil a 
troop more bolder. 
When he marehet in the fight 
McMullen was tight, 
lie never took time to think— 
He was shot in the heal 
And left 111 , 
re for dead, 
From the controlliLr influence of drinks 
McMullen had pluck, 
That's no use witl,ota luck, 
And whin they sea him to cook for the nagerb, 
His spirit, arose, 
He put his thumb to hi.s nose 
Saying I'd see you in h—li first, bejaberS. 
In a 
cell he was put

Whin they let him go

YOU CAN'T PLAY THAT ON ME, 
Banjo Solo by E. 0. GOODING. 
GOOD people all, you see I'm here to meet you once again, 
And I 
will try and please you all, my object I'll explain, 
To tell you of the slang remarks you'll hear where'er you 
be, 
But the one that you will hear the most is, " You can't 
play that on me." 
Cnonos. 
Oh, yes, you bet—these words you'll get, 
Where friends have met where'er you be, 
And oft you may hear some one say— 
My boy you can't play that on me. 
The other night I 
took a 
stroll and dropped in a 
saloon, 
I 
met some friends, we had a 
bowl, and didn't leave there 
soon, 
We drank our beer and smoked cigars and chatted merrily, 
And tried to stand the bar boy off. 
He says, " You can't 
play that on me." 
Oh, yes, you bet, &c. 
'Twas at a 
party some time since—I 
met a 
charming maid, 
At least I 
thought her charming then, but I 
missed it, I'm 
;afraid, 
I 
took her to the supper room, so happy then were we, 
I 
asked her could I 
see her home, she says, " You can't 
play that on Inc." 
Oh, yes, you bet, &c. 
The day was set, at last arrived, and I 
did call her wife, 
Oh, horror! such an awful sell, you ne'er saw in your life, 
When we retired and she disrobed, oh that such a thing 
could be, 
She took out her teeth—unscrewed her leg, says I, " You 
can't play that on me." 
LAST C 
rronus. 
So my pants I 
took—with rage I 
shook, 
One final took—and I 
did flee, 
For I 
had one dose and I'll watch close, 
That they don't play such g—a—m—s 
on me.

VIOLETS DIPPED IN DEW 
Words and Music by W. II. D
ELEILANTI. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The Sun had just gone dowk, 
While leisurely meandering 
A 
little way from town; 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue, 
Beneath her dark eye-lashes, 
Like Violets dipped in dew, 
CHORUS. 
A. smile was all she gave me 
But how it did enslave me, 
'Twas love, the first I 
knew ; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing 
Within her eyes so blue, 
ti dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
i 
t‘Aluwed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
Jind as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
Oa one °erne; there I 
feast 
(sYmPl‘l

CHORUS. 
She deigned to smite upon me, (Symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
My heart it pierced me through : 
There's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue ; 
A 
dreamy soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured into talk, 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk ; 
She blushing, frowning, smiling, 
Said, ‘• Oh ! I 
think you're rude ;" 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would. 
CHORUS. 
So arm in arm we wandered, ( Sympb, 
lies, side by side meandered, 
And told our love tales too. 
Ethere's some sweet- charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A 
dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
STAND BY THE POOR. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
JUST listen a 
moment I'll sing you a 
song, 
And in it some truths I'll relate, 
Just to show you how easily credit reflects 
From the poor roan as well as the great. 
Working day after day through the slow, weary hours, 
With hearts often troubled and sore, 
Would it not be kindness to give him a 
lift? 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Cuotrus. 
Whenever you're anxious to do a 
good deed, 
And one that will always endure, 
Just help out your suffering neighbor in need, 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
How often that poor man, with intellect grand, 
Must take a 
back seat every day ; 
While some gawkish fellow is lord of the land— 
His cash ' tis that makes the display. 
Some world-weary wretch, out seeking for alms, 
Is drove, with a 
curse, from the door ; 
I 
think this is both impolite and unkind— 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Whenever you're anxious, eta. 
How many unfortunate beings to- night 
Without food or shelter they go, 
Are living on what we may drop from our hand; 
Let's give them a, hiss, not a 
blow. 
'Tis only our due Is that will live when we die, 
So kindness i 
better, I'm sure; 
And if you believe me, between you and I. 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Whenever you're anxious, etc. 
The wealth of our nation is earned by the hand 
That is hardened by vigor and toil; 
There in the background they're forced to stand 
Who ought to be lords of the soil. 
It them stand back to back in the contest of life, 
Till their hardships are fewer and fewer, 
Still struggling on in the midst of the strife, 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Whenever you're anxious, ate.

While others used to stray;

They had to be half-soled and heeled, 
From sliding on the door. 
Oh! I 
would, 44. 
One day the old man fell asleep, 
Upon his cellar door; 
The boys all came to take a 
peep, 
And hear him loudly snore;

And laughed till their sides were sore, 
The old man awoke with a 
loud haw! haw! 
And slid down on his own cellar door.

A 
Leaf of Ivy from my Mother's Grave. 
Originally composed by CHARLES A. 
SATILLR, and sung with great 
success in _ v62 leAkling theatres in America. 
-- • 
I 
went to Greenwood yesterday, 
To visit my angel mother's grave; 
Gently I 
knelt besi,le the mound, 
And took a 
leaf of Ivy from the grave; 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow • 
And ' tis only in my visions, 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
CHORUS: 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow; 
And ' tis only in my visions, 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
Mother died when I 
was quite young, 
And it soon broke up my home; 
Soon I 
found I 
was not welcome, 
And like a 
stringer 1 
did roam; 
All I've got now to remember her, 
And which I 
cherish and will save 
Is this li tic le- if of Ivy, 
A leaf of Ivy from my mother's grave: 
(Chorus). 
Since mother's death I 
feel forsaken, 
And o'er the wide world I 
have roamed; 
Until, when my poor heart was breaking, 
With my brother, then, I 
found a 
home; 
From mother we'll not long be parted, 
Soon we'll meet her tip above. 
Where well nc'er again be parted, 
But will live in joy and endless love. 
(Chorus). 
TODDLING THROUGH - THE LA.NOIERS. 
As sung by the FREEMAN SISTERS, in their neIV 
act eatitted MASQUERADE. 
OF all the pleasures sweet, that serve to drive dull care away, 
I 
most enjoy to trip the light, fantastic toe so gay, 
And one I 
most enjoy of all the dances light and free, 
To trip around in quiet ease the Landers give to me. 
CHORUS. 
Toddling through the lanciers, merry happy lanciers, 
Gayest of all dances, best of all to me; 
Toddling through the hinders, merry happy lanciers, 
Gayest of all dances, best of all to me. 
Some like the Polka's jolly step, the Galop some admire. 
While others of the Deux Temps, or Afazourka never tire, 
But all of these though good enough, are not the thing you see, 
For perfect ease and pleasure sweet the lanciers give to me. 
Toddling through, Sc.c. 
What sweeter pleasure can there be than thus to freely glide, 
To music sweet and with a 
charming partner at your side, 
What conscious bliss and pleasure such sweet, happy moments 
bring, 
Contentment crowns us for the while and cares and grief take 
wing. 
Toddling through, dcc.

What makes you of me shy ? 
Meet me to-night at Taylor's, 
And sip the good old rye. 
The day is dawning fast, my love,

The evening soon is coming, love, 
In fact is almost here. 
Then pretty Jane, my pretty Jane, 
I 
beg you, don't be shy, 
But meet me in the evening, 
And sip the good old rye. 
And when you finish your flrst glass, 
I'll give the bell a 
ring; 
The waiter, in his jacket white, 
To answer it shall spring. 
The day is waning fast, my love, 
I 
whisper in your ear; 
The evening soon is coming, love, 
In fact is almost here. 
Then pretty Jane, my pretty Jame 
I 
beg you don't be shy. 
But meet me, as I 
have proposed, 
And sip the good old rye.

THE GOAT. 
NOW my dear friends, I'm going to relate, 
If you pay attention, you've not long to wait; 
My father lived in a 
place called Gramote, 
He had a 
sow, and a 
cow, and a 
fine billy goat. 
This 0-oat, sure, he had a 
queer, curious way, 
out over morning and stop out all day; 
,.11 
i 
corn, home at rihrld, like a 
bull he would roar, 
in 131111 ,1•1,0t:,. 
up tor to open the door. 
One day we sat down, and was going to ate, 
The goat leap'd on the table ana sthole all the mate, 
And without saying a 
word, share the dirty ould gommagli, 
lIe druv hi9 two horns in me poor father s 
stomach. 
Says me mother to me, " Jamse," " Yis mam," says 1, 
" 
Take that goat to the market, and sell him, now thry." 
The words she scarce spoke, when the rat, gave a 
jump, 
And sthruck me mother, oh gorra I 
such a 
murthering thump 
Then all the house bate a 
hasty retrate, 
And the goat backed away at the divil's own rate; 
lie spied my father's coat hanging, he gave a 
loud bawl, 
Made a 
charge on the " frize," and druv his head in the wail. 
Some time Other they went to look for Ulu goat, 
They searched all around. Oh they came to the co 
Ail 01 toe roat that was left on the very ...est day, 
Was only Inc stbump ot his tan, and it still bucking swig. 
SIX FE.rT OF EARTH, 
Written, composed and sung by Jolt A. 
GULICK, and sung bf 
WILEY HAMILTON W 
Rh tremendous applause. 
I'LL sing you a 
song of the world and its ways, 
And the many strange people we meet, 
From the rich man who rolls in his millions of wealth, 
To the poor starving wretch in the street; 
Now a 
man though he's poor lind in tatters and Yap, 
We should never affect to despise, 
But think of the adage, remember my friend, 
That six feet of earth makes all men of one size. 
There the rich man with thousands to spare if be choose. 
But he haughtily holds up his head, 
And thinks he's above the mechanic who toils, 
And is honestly earning his bread; 
But his gold and his jewels he can't take along, 
To the world.up above when he dies, 
For death levels, all and conclusively shows, 
That six feet of earth makes all men of one size. 
There's many a 
coat that is tattered and torn, 
That covers a 
brave manly heart, 
But because he's not dressed like his neighbor in silks, 
Society keeps them apart: 
On one fortune smiles, while the other one fails, 
No matter what venture he tries, 
Till time in the end calls them both to the gravel, 
And six feet of earth makes both men of one else. 
When e'er you see a 
poor fellow that tries 
To battle the world and its frowns, 
Let's help him along, and perchance he'll succeed, 
Don't crush him and htill push him down, 
For a 
cup of cold water in charity give; 
Is remembered with joy n 
the skies, 
We're all human beings, we've i,11 cot to die, 
And six feet of earth makes us all of Ale size,

STOP AS LONG AS YOU USED TO. 
As sang with great success by Miss JENNIE Huouss. 
I 
know a 
jolly old bachelor, 
Who lives next door to me, 
Though he is thought a 
bit of a 
bore, 
In jolly good company; 
For he is such an inquisitive man, 
That if you e'er should meet, 
He'll button- hole you if he can, 
And give you the following treat. 
0110RUS.— Does your mother take in washing? 
Has she sold her mangle ? 
What's become of the old piano, 
Your sister used to strangle? 
Has your father plenty of work 
Does he still get boozed too ? 
Tell me all the particulars, 
And stop as long as you used to. 
Now this old man has lots of wealth, 
So he's not without a 
few, 
Choice friends who'll call to drink his health, 
And borrow a 
pound or two; 
But the old man cross-exarnines them so, 
That they're glad to get away, 
As rich as they came, and as out they go, 
With a 
grin on his face be will say. 
CHORUS.—Does your mother, & e. 
This bachelor's blessed with a 
lovely niece, 
His heiress, so they say, 
So I 
thought I'd try to be in the piece, 
And told my love one day : 
"Oh! speak to my Uncle, sir," she said, 
" 
With his consent Nve'll wed," 
So I 
asked him if she could be my bride, 
When he drew me aside, and said. 
C
HORUS.—Does your mother, & c. 
The ladies give him their sweetest smiles, 
And flatter and coax him so, 
But he can see through their artful wiles, 
Though his knowledge he does not show, 
They make him presents of gloves and ties, 
And handkerchiefs white as snow, 
Which he will wave before their eyes, 
As he asks with a 
chuckle and crow. 
Cliontiliewipoes your mother, &O.

HE ISN'T AS RICH AS HE USED TO BE, 
Copyrighted 1876, awl Music published by E.

HARPING, 229 Bow-
ery, New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
He isn't as rich as he used to be, 
His friends, they are growing few ; 
When jolly and gay, in the days gone by. 
He found them a 
little too true. 
He wanders alone thro' the street so gay, 
And meets here and there a 
cool bow; 
But the friends of his pleasure in days gone by, 
Having nothing to say to him now. 
CHORUS. 
For he isn't as rich as he used to be, 
He's " down in the world," to- day • 
He knows what it is to be poor, my boys, 
And he meets not a 
friend in nis way. 
He sported himself like a 
prince around, 
And became a 
great friend of " the boys," 
Whenever his presence was known to them, 
They set up a 
flattering noise. 
The ladies all smiled as he passed them by, 
Their wishes he well could attend; 
He was loved and caressed like an angel blest, 
Because he had money to spend. 
For he isn't, ke. 
At night, in convivial joys he lived, 
And slumbered each day until noon. 
He rode in his Coach with a 
lady fair, 
And went off to the country in June; 
But now, no one knows where he lives or goes, 
Some forget him and others despise, 
Ho feels the hard times, but hell bear them well, 
Till, *ome day, in his garret he dies, 
For he isn't, kc.

Don't give up the Old Friend for the New 
A very popular Motto Song. 
Words by JOHN M HVEIGFI. 
Music by JOE A. 
GELICK. 
Sung with great success by M ISS KATE M ONTROSE at Novelty Theatre 
New York City. 
There's many a 
song with many a 
motto, 
Each containing good advice; 
Obey their teachings, too, we ought to, 
Tho' great temptations us entice; 
To sing a 
new song I'll endeavor, 
And one I 
hope will please a 
few; 
Make all the friends you can, but never 
Give up the old friend for the new. 
ClIonns: 
Then listen to the motto that I 
give you, 
You'll find a 
good one it will prove, and true; 
Make all the friends you can, 
Always lend a 
helping hand, 
But don't give up the old friend for the new. 
You may be poor in life's beginning, 
A man you meet just like yourself; 
His friendship you succeed in winning, 
lie helps you on the road to wealth; 
And when you've won it, do not sever 
The ties that bind him still to you; 
He helped you in your need, so never 
Give up the old friend for the new. 
To those who may, perhaps, be married, 
A word or two I 
have to say; 
By fairer faces be not carried, 
Completely off and led astray; 
In this, the age of quick divorces, 
Men love their wives a 
year or two; 
Then wander into other courses, 
Give up the old wife for the new.

Poor Little Joe. 
Ai sung by BILLY M AYO. 
While strolling one night through New York's gay throng. 
I 
met a 
poor boy—he was singing a 
song; 
Although he was singing, he wanted for bread, 
Although he was smiling, he wished himself dead. 
I 
spoke to this poor boy who was out on the street, 
He had no place of shelter, nor had anything to cat; 
No mother to guide him— in the cold grave lies low, 
Cast on the cold world was poor little Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Cold blew the blast, and down came the snow, 
No place of shelter, nor nowhere to go ; 
No mother to guide him—in the cold grave lies low, 
Cast on the cold world was poor little Joe. 
A 
carriage rolled by with a 
lady inside, 
She fondly caressed her own darling child; 
Joe followed the carriage—she not even smiled, 
As I 
looked on his face I 
saw that he cried. 
I 
looked at this poor boy, and thought it quite odd, 
Had this poor ragged urchin been forgotten by God? 
As I 
looked at the gaslight that fell on the snow, 
I 
saw the pale, deathly features of poor little Joe. 
Cold blew the blast, &c. 
The lights had gone out, and the clock had struck One, 
When home came a 
policeman whose duty was done, 
And you'd think by the sound of his dull, heavy tread, 
That he was a- seeking the starving and dead. 
"Oh, what's this ?" ah, then the policeman he cried, 
'Twas poor little Joe—on the steps he had died; 
With his face turned to Heaven, all covered with snow, 
Died on the cold streets, did poor little Joe. 
Cold blew the blasts, &c.

I 
am a 
hard working man that's fond of good living, 
I've a 
fair education that's to say I'm no fool; 
Some very hard problems of late I've been solving, 
But I 
can't understand that game they call Pool; 
You pick up your cue and rub it with chalk, 
And you fool around the table like an over-grown gall), 
You first make a 
scratch and that sets you crazy, 
And if you keep it up you get terrible lazy; 
how you are stuck every game you can never suspect, 
Until you get humpback from carrying checks. 
It costs a 
small fortune when you first learn the game, 
You walk round the table until you get lame; 
There's some that get cross-eyed and others humpbucked, 
And others you will see do a 
contortion act; 
Now there's some sleeps on a 
pool table, 
To play a 
good game he will never be able; 
He is played for a 
sucker always get beat, 
And from walking he is got bunions all over his feet; 
If be takes my advice he'll not be a 
fool, 
And spend all his salary to learn to play pool.

PRETTY AS PICTURE. 
As sung by MACKIN A" 
WILSON. 
On ! my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
A 
darling face has won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
I 
met down by the brook, 
She is the prettiest, and the wittiest, 
Her smile has quite undone me,
