Well this (ques.) the fantastic voyage uh there was spies this is the year of 1970 and uh
we were having another war with uh Russia and one of our top secret agents had uh
information from them very important information that we needed badly on the way to uh
when they got off the plane the United States he was brought to headquarters and uh
head on the way to headquarters he got uh they had an accident and he he was thrown
against the the car door and he he uh a blood clot in his brain and if they operated be
would be mentally retarded he wouldn't be able to uh tell them the information so they uh
they'd been working on ministuration miniaturization and uh they miniaturized uh a sea
ship that was that was made to go uh under water especially built for water deep sea travel
but they used it for this purpose to uh miniaturize it to the size of a germ and put it through
his uh blood system with uh a laser gun to uh blast the blood clot during this uh whole
thing they had to go through they got caught in the whirlpools where a vein and an artery
meets and there's a a tiny whirlpool it wouldn't be noticeable but in their size it was a giant
whirlpool and spun them in to uh the jugular vein and they had to go down through the
lungs and uh in the lungs this man had you know smokes so in the lung they got caught
in the lung and they want out to see where they were they had a chart but they didn't they
weren't too sure of it so they wont out to see where they were and they got caught inside
the lung and this man was breathing and they had to grab onto the side so they wouldn't
be blown out so he had to cut a little hole in the lung to get back to the ship with his knife
so uh after that they went through they went back up the jugular vein and through his ear

then if anybody made the slightest noise outside, it would they would be blown apart and
after an hour if they weren't out of his body in an hour the ship would
2
grow big again natural size so if they blew if they got rid of the blood clot that that wasn't
the only thing they had to worry about getting out uh about the time they got caught in the
whirlpool the laser gun broke so he had to uh break contact with the outside and use parts
from his uh receiver his set to talk to the outside uh to fix the laser gun because that's what
they needed they would've they could've done it with a knife but it would've uh probably
just made another clot so uh they fixed the laser gun they had no contact so uh they
couldn't tell them they were in the ear and if anybody made a noise they could've been
blown up so they got right past the ear they went up to the brain and a nurse dropped the
scissors and the whole ship starts bopping (ques.) No a nurse outside and you know it
goes through his ear and the ship uh starts bouncing and turning and flipping finally they
got to his uh his blood clot they did the bloodclot but on the way back they got caught in
another vein and artery and they started spinning around and they had to go all the way
around the brain again and then uh out and they had to pick a a certain member uh vein
and they had to come out through the eye when the guy they did something to make the
guy tear I think it was gas and they came out through a tear drop and they had to pick it
up with a syringe and put it back on the on the table and than they used uh the machine to
make it grow large again and the man inside there was four men and one woman she took
care of the there were four man and one lady and the lady was in charge of the laser gun
and they all thought that each other was plotting against them because if they if they had
a spy in the ship he could've uh like everybody was important if uh the man that read the
map if he read it wrong and he wanted to kill the guy be could've killed him he could've put
them on the wrong track if the lady with the laser gun uh wanted to kill the

guy she could've' broke the laser which happened and they they suspected her and then
they suspected the guy that read the map cause uh they hit this whirlpool but he said he
said he didn't have no time to know about it then uh they suspected uh the man in charge
of the the transmitter that they thought that was the reason he wanted to uh break contact
they thought him and the girl and there was only one guy they didn't sugpect that was uh
the one who was steering the ship who who had made the ship but not for that purpose
(ques.) He had made it for underground under water but not for going through a guy's
veins (ques.) three four four men and uh one girl (ques.) the lady was in charge of the
laser one to steer the ship one to map it one to uh for the transmitter and then was another
man he knew he he had made the ship and he knew every piece of it so when uh the air
supply ran out he'd know what to fix and the air supply did run out and they couldn't uh this
was before they broke contact and they couldn't breathe that air because it was cause they
were ministurized and uh the particles in the air would be too big for them to breathe so
they had a ministurising gun and they had to miniaturize the air inside (ques.) Well they
were all scared Is that what you mean? (ques.) yeah they were suspicious but at the end
those suspicions were removed you know because they they all had a right to because the
laser broke the air filter went off and uh one guy took apart the transmitter one guy uh they
thought he he brought us this way into the whirlpool so that's they all were suspicious of
each other (ques.) then they came out of the and they were all you know everybody was
glad that it was over and they had one second to go before they got out if they didn't get
out in that one second the ship would grow big again (ques.) yes and then he told them the
information (ques.) yes (ques) yes it was (ques) no I missed it (ques) she was the nurse
that dropped

the scissors was outside while this man who was laying on the stretcher she was outside
not outside she was in the room that the man was on the stretcher while they were in his
body (ques.) ah they miniaturized them to an inch they put them in water to see if it had
any leaks or anything cause this was the first time they ever tried out the boat and it looked
to them an inch high it looked like uh uh a vast sea it was a little container so uh then
a machine they called the Wildo it was a uh big arm it picked them up and put them on
another platform and then were reduced again than they were put uh I'm pretty sure they
were put on a platform and reduced to a third time to about the size of a flea and then they
were uh then they were reduced again they were reduced to the size of a flea put back in
the water picked up put on the thing reduced another ten hundredths of an inch and then
put back in the water and then they reduced the whole thing in water with them but this
had uh radar on it or some sort of radar that uh it could sense where they are in the water
so the nurse put the needle in there and pulled up and it was in there and they told her you
gotta send the needle that's how she knew so then they uh then they they squirted out but
not in the guy they put it in blood, his type of blood and they did the same thing then they
put it in his arm yeah in his arm and they went up through his arm over about here they
got caught in the whirlpool and then went up to his jugular vein and through his ear they
weren't supposed to go through his ear (ques.) the clot was in his brain (ques.) yes (ques.)
so they went through uh came here and they got caught in the whirlpool up by the neck
then went down the jugular vein into his lungs they got out of his lungs and then they took
a route uh I forget the name of the vein
5
went up uh along the bottom of the neck and up this side of the neck the left side of the
neck and then went to his brain (ques.) no there were none but they were all they all kept
an eye on each other - cassette ends here

(ques.) yeah (ques.) I got to the seventh seventh chapter I started it yesterday (ques.)
uh they're sending the the ships are out of control they're uh aircrafts with bombs on it
and uh these are radio controlled and something happened a transmitter blew out or
something and they're going straight towards Moscow and they're gonna drop the bombs
on Moscow so (ques.) Yes but uh I've read the book already I like to read it again I read
fantastic voyage once before too (ques.) cause I like it (ques.) I've read uh four books this
since Wednesday and this is going on the fifth uh they so Moscow since Moscow lost all
its people says we want you to drop a bomb an New York (ques..) yes three uh nuclear
bombs they dropped on uh Moscow and wiped it right off the map says I want you to bomb
uh New York and the president's wife was in New York at the time and she got killed when
they dropped the bomb.
