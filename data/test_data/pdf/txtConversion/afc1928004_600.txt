BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 
OF 
James Johnson first saw the light of day upon the 16th 
of December, 1848, in Liverpool, England. 
His first ap-
pearance upon any Stage was upon that of the "New 
Bowery Theatre," in 1863. 
His success was so emphatic 
that he immediately made a tour of all the principal 
Variety Theatres. 
He became a 
prominent member of 
I. H. Taylor's Minstrels, in 1868, an organization which 
contained many members of the Burnt Cork Fraternity, 
who are now numbered with the dead, or famous in Min-
strelsy. 
Mr. Johnson was next upon the list of W. W. New-
comb's Minstrel's, with whom he remained for several 
years, occupying one of the " Ends," and performing songs 
and dances. 
In the Summer of 1870 he met his present 
partner, George Powers, and the twain have since re-
mained 
together. 
Their 
first 
appearance was 
with 
"Hooley's Minstrels," September 5th, 
1870. 
These 
Artists were the first to originate the grotesque style of 
dancing so prevalent at the present time. 
They have orig-
inated and perfected almost every eccentric song and 
Dance now known to the public. 
They next appeared 
with " Arlington, Cotton 84. 
Iremble's Minstrels," in 
Chicago, joining the famous " Sanyrancisco Minstrels' , 
in 1872, where they have since remained, a 
fact which 
proves their excellence and popularity with the patrons of 
that famous place of amusement. 
Both gentlemen createg

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.— CONTINUED. 
a furore in London with IVIoore & Burgess' Minstrels, 
and the English Press was lavish in its praises. 
While 
here, they were re-engaged by the " San Francisco Min-
strels" to begin another Season at their Opera House. 
This is a 
sure sign of the value placed upon their abilities, 
and the estimation in which they are held by such Mana-
gers as Mess:s Birch & Backus, who leaves no stone un-
turned to proctue the very best talent available, for the 
critical audiences who exact the .` Very Best" at all times. 
George Powers was born in Louisville, Kentucky, 
April, 3d, 1848. 
He first appeared in public at a 
very 
tender age, and sang Ballads and performed Jigs, his first 
bow being made in Cairo, Illinois, under the auspices of 
Frank Howard, a 
Composer of some renown, and to young 
Powers' excellent voice may be attributed the popularity 
of many songs written by Howard, and first sang by the 
Boy Balladist. 
He next managed to join the fortunes of a 
Traveling Circus, and soon became the " Black" Clown of 
the concern, and performed Ethiopian Comedies. 
He 
afterwards met Johnson, and the partnership was formed . 
which has since floated them upon the topmost wave of 
prosperity and fame. 
This alliance of talent and merit 
has outlasted all partnerships formed by the many imita-
tors who spring up by the hundred when a 
new vein of 
profit has been discovered. 
That many seek to copy the 
Originals, is a 
convincing proof of the excellence, original-
ity and inexhaustible supply of novelties produced by 
JOHNSON & POWERS. 
5 
"ANTI-FAT TWINS." 
As performed by JOHNSON (4: POWERS, of the SAN FRANCISCO M IN-
STELS, with great success. 
We're full of joy and glee to-day, 
And as frisky as a 
mule; 
We heard the bell—now don't you tell— 
We ran away from school. 
Our A B 
C's we know with ease, 
And c-a-t 
spells cat; 
We are so stout we waddle about, 
And we're taking Anti- Fat. 
CHORUS: 
We float around like big balloons, 
But yet we never will complain; 
We dance and sing, and then we swing 
All day in the shady lane. 
The neighbors all do loudly bawl 
When we climb their fences no matter how tall; 
And down the apples and peaches do fall, 
When into their orchards we make a 
call. 
We never study so very hard, 
For a 
dunce we'd rather be; 
And on a 
stool we stand in school-
-No books for him and me. 
We are too fat to learn to spell, 
We never will be wise; 
We 
sit all day in the sun and play 
At baking and making mud pies. 
(Chorus), 
As performed by JOHNSON 8: POWERS. 
" Original: . 
The moon was up and the river did shine, 
We all started off for to have a 
good time; 
We sent for the girls and they all did agree 
To dance till the morning and have a 
good spree. 
First came Lize, and then came Sal, 
Hanging on the arm of big-foot Hal; 
They started up the fiddle and figures did call, 
In a 
grand double-shuffle at the flat- boat ball. 
CHORUS: 
Then it's oh, my! let me die, 
While I 
hear the music sweet; 
Oh, dear! can't you hear 
The sound of df..ncing feet. 
(Repeat. 
We danced so long the niggers did shake, 
Some hollered supper and they all made a 
break; 
They jumped on the table like a 
lot of loose 11cas, 
And the yellow gals sat on the colored men's knees. 
They eat hog meat till they couldn't eat more, 
The boat got a 
sinking, then we shoved her ashore; 
Bic,- Liza fainted and in the water did fall, 
And she floated on her bustle at the flat-boat ball. 
(Chorus). 
We all walked home as the sun did rise, 
Some got. sleepy and they shut their eyes; 
-We led them along like a 
lot of lost sheep, 
And sang 'em a 
song that rocked ' ern to sleep. 
But old Bill Carter and young Sam Glim, 
They got in a 
muss and the fight did begin; 
They pulled out razors and on the ground did fall, 
Oh, they carved each other at the flat-boat ball. 
(Chorus). 
Banjo solo by J. JOHNSON for E. 
M. 
HALL of Carneross' Minstrels 
with grsat success. 
Kind friends if you will wait, a 
story I'll relate, 
About a 
girl who is in love with me, 
She's as lovely as a 
lamb, but her head looks like a 
ham, 
Which has been boiled for one month find a 
day; 
And such a 
funny name would make a 
cat walk lame, 
To repeat it now for you I'm going to try; 
So listen without fear, and open wide your ears, 
For to lose this name would cause you all to cry. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Philopena, Concertina, Algerina, Clementina, 
Maritina, Flamitina, and sweet Matilda .Jane; 
.Tosephina, Seraphirr,„ 
Hannah Merina, Belvidina, 
Nota Berm, Big Casina, is my gal's name. 
Her form indeed is fine, from ridiculous '.(; sublime, 
She's double-jointed in the heel and nose; 
ITer appetite is grand, she ate up an apple stand, 
She's pigeoned and cross-eyed in both her toes. 
But it's to her name she charges all the blame, 
To change it now it worries her night and day; 
But a 
change to mine, I 
fear, is a 
thing that's not so 
ttear 
To her imaginative powers as they seem. 
(Chorus). 
Now, she's in love, I 
fear, from her toes up to her ear, 
But I 
hope her love for me will soon give out; 
Such a 
name I 
cannot stand, it's the longest in the land, 
So my advice to her is change her route. 
Let her Ii ye out on the plains, and then she'll get some 
names 
To add to those which she has already got; 
Mine I'll keep myself, it's better for my health, 
For with all those names with mine would make it 
hot. 
(Choms). 
" 
End Song." Sung by GEORGE POWERS. 
Oh, I 
came from New Hampshire, 
Across the Green Mountains; 
Where the sheep and the shepherds 
And the nanny goats dwell; 
I 
came here in search of 
A 
lovely young damsel; 
Where she has gone to 
I 
really can't tell. 
Cuonts: 
Yet I 
weep and I 
wander, 
O'er hills and o'er mountains, 
For the loss of my true love, 
Oh, where can she be*? 
Her parents they both 
Were highly respectable, 
Her mother milked cows 
On a 
three-legged stool; 
Her father's a 
farmer, 
That grows the green turnip-tops, 
Her sister's a 
dairy-maid, 
Her brother's a 
fool. 
She's a 
beautiful, young creature, 
Yes, fair in every feature; 
Her hair is magenta, 
And she squints with oue eye; 
She moves when she's 
She speaks when she's talking; 
And if I 
don't find her soon, 
' 
down and die. 
(Chorus). 
(Chorus). 
Written by J. 
JOHNSON, and performed by JOHNSON 4.t POWERS in 
their original sketch, " Trouble in tie Family." 
Now, Hannah, dear, what makes you 
Treat de ole man so? 
For if you doesn't want me here 
Just tell me for to go. 
Not long ago you loved me, 
Den dar was nothing wrong, 
But now -you're at me night and day, 
And wish dat I'd begone. 
ClIORITS: 
When I'm gone, 
I 
will miss you 
When I'm gone, r 
I 
will miss you, 
Dar'll be one sad heart to miss me 
when I'm gone, 
Oh, dear Rufus, how it pains me 
To hurt your feelings so; 
I 
didn't mean to do it, 
And I'll never let you go. 
My temper it was hasty, 
And you staid from home so long, 
But there's one thing I'm certain of— 
I'll miss you when you're gone. ( Chorus). 
I'm sure dey all will miss me 
From dis pleasant home;. 
Although it am quite humble, 
What's here is all Our own. 
De childun dey am growing up, 
To be quite stout and strong; 
Dey'll take good care of Hannah, 
But dey'll miss me when I'm gone. ( Chorus).

OUR PATRICK IS AN ACTOR. 
—:0:— 
By FRANK DUMONT. 
Sung by JAMES JOHNSON, and performed by JOHNSON & POWERS. 
—:0:— 
I 
have raised a 
dozen children, quite proud of them am 
And some are influential, and hold positions high; 
Oh, I 
have lovely daughters, that can't be denied, 
They wear their silks and satins and in a 
carriage ride: - 
There is Larry, Ted and Owney, with Terrence, Dan and 
Mike, 
All elegant, and scholars, you never saw the like; 
But the youngest is our Patrick, he's wort of all you see, 
For he's traveling with a 
Circus, an Actor man to be. 
Our Patrick is an Actor, he wears the finest clothes, 
The ladies all admire him no matter where he goes; 
With diamonds on his shirt- front, a 
lump the size of twtt. 
It's folly to deny it, a 
dandy is our Pat. 
When he's home upon a 
visit, the neighbors far and near , 
Extend an invitation to have cigars and beer; 
Iii cook corn beef and cabbage, to have a 
lovely meal, 
But Patsy doesn't touch it, so dainty does. he feel; 
But he'll eat ice cream and peaches, Blanc Mange and 
custard pie, 
It's the style he learnt from Actors, they're always living 
high; 
But in spite of all his manners, a 
word for him we'll speak 
lie ne'er forgets his parents with money every week.

NORTH CAROLINA ROSE. 
Written by J. JOHNSON and performed by JOHNSON and Powmts 
with SAN FRANCISCO M INSTRELS. 
Yonder is the home of the North Carolina rose, 
You can bet she's the darling of my heart; 
I 
love to hear her feet when me she comes to meet, 
in her alpaca gingham dress so smart; 
Her oval black eyes go through me like a 
lance, 
Her little laugh is merry and so clear; 
She'll join me in a 
second, you'll say that right I've 
reckoned, 
I 
can tell by the burning of my ear. 
Cnonus: 
My Rose, (Sym.) My Rose, (Sym.), 
You'll say she's the sweetest flower that blows; 
Oh how my heart does beat for my darling little sweet; 
3.ly handsome little North Carolina Rose, 
He.—When de day begins to break, dats the time I 
wake, 
And the first thing I 
think of is the one 
Who stole my heart away and made my life so gay, 
As the dew drops that sparkle in the sun. 
She.—He's as straight as a 
pine, oh, how his eyes do shine, 
When walking out wid him I 
often goes; 
For him I'd leave my mother, and never wed another 
Fo: he calls me his North Carolina rose. 
(('horus). 
ne.—So here you are at last, my heart was beating fast, 
I 
thought sure that you'd forgot to come; 
But now that, you are here, I'll whisper in your ear, 
To name the day when you and I'll be one. 
She.—I 
wish the day was here, for to me you're very dear, 
I'llbe happy when I 
hear you say she's mine; 
Now this is what we'll do, just stop at Parson Crew, 
And that will be a 
saving of the time. 
(Chorus. 
As sting by Mr. Thra.y Buten for two years with tremendoits suecesX 
Give my top and string to brother, 
Mamma, when I'm dead; 
When the sexton puts me under, 
In my little bea; 
If the job is like to throw him, 
When the string lie jerks; 
Get some little boy to show him, 
How the old thing works. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Give my chewing-gum 10 sister, 
I 
don't want it more; 
On my gums it raised a 
blister, 
They are awful sore; 
Give away my ragged jacket, 
Mamma, don't you cry; 
In the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, 
In the sweet bye-and-bye. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Tell our neighbors that his billy goat, 
Causing all my rips; 
When he bounced me, oh, dear mother, 
I 
passed in all my chips, 
Though your son forgives him, mother, 
Give him all my wealth; 
lilt him with a 
ripe tomato, 
You know how it is yourself. 
Repeat last 1 
wo lines. 
BILLY'S REQUEST—CoNTrsuED. 
Roll me up in nice light pie-crust, 
Slather me over with jam; 
Hit me with a 
hundred cream cakes, 
And bounce me with a 
ham; 
Take me to our old-time clam-bake, 
Sheepshead, lobster and gin; 
Drown me in a 
watermelon, 
Then wipe off my chin. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Let me bruise my little brother, 
Once before I 
go; 
Let me bit him on the smeller, 
Mamma, don't say no; 
Let me Gra2co-Roman wrestle, 
I'll do my 13vel best; 
Let me bust his new suspenders, 
Then pull down his vest. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Sprinkle me over with powdered sugar, 
Smear me over with tar; 
Spatter me over with nice duck-feathers, 
I'll be an angel, ilia; 
Let me bite the old cat's tail off, 
He can't catch no mice; 
Give me a 
dose of bitter water, 
It's naughty, but it's nice. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Air—Mabel Waltz. 
As sung by Jemzs JOHNSON. 
An adventure I'll relate to you, 
That happened the other day; 
As at the depot, in the cars, 
By chance I 
took my way; 
I 
scarce had set down in my seat, 
'Mong daughters, sons and ma's, 
When the door opened to admit 
A lady in the car. 
She quickly glided to her seat, 
A smile was on her face; 
The whistle blew, it was all aboard, 
We started from the place; 
Do what I 
would, look where I 
could, 
From daughters to their 'cm's; 
I 
couldn't take my eyes from off 
The lady in the cars. 
We rode along, kept passing by, 
Each station, one by one; 
When she put her hand up to the blind, 
To keep away the sun; 
I 
volunteered at once to serve, 
And thanked my lucky stars; 
It gave me a 
chance to sit and talk, 
With the lady in the cars. 
THE LADY IN THE CAR—CoNTINuED. 
I 
was dressed all in my best, 
In the fashion of the time; 
But for style I 
wore upon my face, 
A moustache that was not mine; 
I 
bought it at a 
barber's store, 
To imitate my pa; 
I 
found at once that it had won, 
The lady in the car. 
Now, as we talked, I 
really felt, 
As if n 
heavenly bliss; 
And found the idea in my head, 
To steal a 
friendly kiss; 
We neared a 
tunnel, brave I 
sat, 
Like any son of Mars; 
As darkness closed around, I 
kissed 
The lady in the cars. 
When from the tunnel we emerged, 
Right into broad daylight; 
Oh, Heavens! will I 
e'er forget, 
The thing that met my sight; 
The car was full, the passengers 
Gave vent to loud ha, has; 
For my moustache was sticking fast 
To the lady in the cars. 
HEALTHY DARLING. 
As sung by Mr. BILLY BIRCH, of SAN FRANCISCO M INSTRELS. Written 
by En. FRENCH. 
I've got a 
healthy darling 
Who weighs 300 pounds, 
She takes the cake at a 
fat clam bake 
When she goes waltzing round; 
Her appetite is numerous, 
lIcr mouth is large, of course, 
She's death on clams and western hams, 
You bet she is the boss. 
She s 
witty, and pretty, 
As a 
wild-cat or giraffe, 
No, never, hardly ever, 
Will you hear this darling laugh; 
With freckled feet and voice so sweet 
As the solid rye and rock, 
She is the belle, her ears do swell 
A 
singing on our block. 
CHORUS: 
Little Fatty Walker a-sittting in the sun, 
Crying; and weeping for hcr young man; 
Rise, Sally, rise, wipe your eyes out with your frock, 
The pet of all the neighbors a 
living on our block. 
No wonder she's so healthy, 
Because she's so well fed, 
She's the envy of our neighborhood 
With her great big bull frog head; 
She's handy with a 
boxing-glove, 
An oyster stew or pie, 
With a 
base-ball bat she killed a 
rat 
A " Coming thro' the Rye;" 
How alarming, yet so charming, 
Does her hair flow to the breeze, 
In the polka or Mazourka 
She can do with perfect ease. 
She's my sugar plum, my rum and gum, 
As solid as a 
rock; 
rootsey, chootsey, tootsey, wootsey, 
Singing on our block. ( Ctioitus). 
At early morn when the birds would sing 
You'll find my Sally there, 
Dancing round the sweet rose bush 
With flowers in her hair; 
The little chippies tootetoot, 
And bounce upon her ear, 
She joins them in their jolly songs 
When she is full of beer. 
She's a 
prancer, and a 
dancer, 
But on singing she'd go broke. 
She struck the key, it was high C, 
I 
thought she was going to choke. 
Her eyelids they've grown faded 
Tossing freckles to the moon; 
The neighborhood's gone crazy 
Listening to this dizzy coon. (Chorus).

Recitation, as delivered by FruNx (Arsumew.

Dar's a 
lone grave on de oder side of de creek 
Dat knows no Decoration Day, 
For him who over yonder sleeps 
Is only a 
Nigger, dey say! 
Dey gave him his freedom, but took away his home, 
lie died an old vagrant, entirely unknown, 
And left not a 
soul to be sad 
But an ole yaller dog—'twas all dat he had. 
Dey dug a 
rude hole and chucked him away, 
Dis poor ole colored slave; 
Not a 
prayer for his rest did anyone say, 
And dat ole yaller dog lay down on his grave, 
And dar you can see him day after day, 
At morning, at eve and at noon; 
But dar's no inducements can drive him away 
From his place beside de grave of a 
coon. 
Dar's a 
mighty fine monument close by, 
But to me dis little mound looks bigger; 
For dar's a 
monument money can't buy— 
A 
yaller dog's love for a 
nigger.

Written by J. JOHNSON, 
We're a 
jolly fat couple as you can see, 
I 
laugh with my wife, and she laughs with me; 
We laugh in the house and we laugh in the street, 
And we're laughed at by everyone whom we meet. 
CHORUS: 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, etc. 
In the morning at breakfast we have a 
good laugh, 
And all sorts of fun, we can't tell you half; 
And the neighbors all say as they pass by our door, 
They never heard laughing so hearty before. 
(Chorus). 
Kind friends, we advise you to laugh and grow fat, 
Now you certainly will pay attention to that; 
To laugh and be jolly like my wife and I, 
Is a 
pleasure I 
know that you all will enjoy.

BOYS IN OLD VIR,GINIA. 
As sung by JOHNSON & POWERS in their Sketch, 
" 
Trouble ia De Family." 
When a 
boy in old Virginia, 
With dad and mamma, too; 
Dar was lots of piccaninnies, 
And nothing much to do;

When e'er we'd get the chance; 
Den we'd keep de old folks worried, 
With our frisky, nigger dance. 
CHollus: 
When de sun rise in de morning, 
Above the yellow corn; 
Dat's the time the darks take warning, 
When Dinah blows de horn. 
Now, Pomp would get de banjo, 
And Zeke the tambourine; 
Den we'd dance to corners, 
Such fun was never seen; 
Den I 
would get a

And take her by de hand, 
You could hear de rafters creaking, 
As we shuffled in de sand.

As you can plainly see; 
We are always in for lots of fun, 
And sometimes for a

But we are here to amuse you all, 
And drive away dull care, 
No doubt you think us pleasant, 
For we're such a 
big fat pair.

For Big fat Charley that's our name, 
Big fat Charley that's our name, 
Chief engineer in a 
coffee saloon, 
And we peddle ice cream in the month of June. 
For big fat Charley that's our name, 
Big fat Charley that's our name, 
Good for any game at night me boys, 
Now who'll join us in this quiet dance. 
Now Charley here he always boasts 
About him being so stout, 
But when I 
say just look at me, 
He tells me to get out; 
I 
laugh at him and he gets mad, 
And says he'll tell my mother; 
Don't you think it very fanny, 
He should tell on his big fat bro - 
her. 
For big fat, ttc. 
One day I 
ran with my sad tale, 
Expecting to have fun, 
But the laugh instead of being on me, 
Was on Charley number one, 
For to my mother he did go, 
And told his story without scope. 
She at him flew and ran him throu: 
With a 
bar of her soft soap,

JOLLY CROSS-TOWN NIGS.

We throw our feet all out of shape, 
Mind, what we say is true; 
For you can all see at a 
glance 
We're so easy in our great big shoe. 
You have heard of dancing, dandy Ike, 
And pretty young Alabama Joe, 
Why they are so jealous of us 
That they hardly know what to do. 
But as for them, why, we don't care 
A 
bale of buttons or a 
box of figs; 
They have big feet and can't complete, 
With the jolly Cross-Town figs. 
So good- evening, etc.

Some think that life the most jolly 
Is found in a 
smoky town, 
But give me the glorious country, 
Where one can get healthy and brown. 
I 
like it now better than ever, 
I'll tell you the reason why— 
If you think I'm blind, perhaps I 
am, 
For I've got a 
sweet girl in my eye. 
CHORUS. 
Down, down by the old water mill, 
Close by the side of a 
rippling rill, 
In a 
dear little cottage just under the hill, 
That's where 1 
met with my darling. 
She showed me the ducks and the drakes, 
She showed me the cocks and the hens, 
She showed me the shovels and rakes, 
And the dear little ba's in their pens. 
She showed me the birds and the bees, 
And likewise the pigs and the sows, 
She showed me the butter and cheese, 
And also the bulls and the cows. 
Down, down, & c. 
The ducks they would waddle to greet her, 
The geese made a 
terrible row, 
The cocks and the hens raced to meet her, 
And merrily grunted the sow. 
She feeds them from out of her apron, 
Her kindness to all never fails, 
Whenever she passes a 
bull or a 
cow 
They're sure to waggle their tails.

W E'RE the double dancing darkies, 
With movements just the same; 
Our " Wonderful Clock Working Jig" 
Has gained for us great fame. 
Our steps they have a

So artistically they're done; 
We work so well together that 
They say we are one. 
When we appear and make our bow, 
A 
grand reception greets us; 
We accomplish with ease the most difficult steps, 
Which proves that none can beat us. 
Like lightning rapidity our feet do fly 
To sweet strains from the band ; 
Impossible seems the execution 
Through radiant silver sand. 
Our " Slender Mokes" is ludicrous, 
And " Quit Dat," " Let Me Be." 
Our figure stands for number eleven,

As I 
strolled out one twilight eve, 
'Twas in the glad spring time, 
I 
met a 
pretty little maid 
With fairy form divine, 
She threw at me a 
loving glance, 
I 
felt the magic spell, 
'Twas love at sight, my heart felt light, 
Down in the hazel dell. 
CHORUS. 
With her I 
chatted gay and free, 
For she was just as pretty as could be, 
And I 
see her every night at eight 
This maid I 
love so well. 
She stole my heart, we'll never part. 
Down in the hazel dell. 
As we ramble through the shady lane, 
Beneath the hawthorn tree, 
Her little hand is placed in mine, 
Her face is full of glee, 
And as she is soon to be my wife, 
I 
love her just as well 
As when we met, and ne'er forget, 
Down in the hazel dell.

DON'T CATCH A BUTTERFLY. 
Never was a 
man without a 
little boy 
Just try to put the matter in your eye 
You may not all of you believe the fact, 
But little boys grew bigger bye and bye, 
foaming in the fields or over in the park, 
Before I 
was too big I 
used to try, 
As quick as any merry lark, 
Or little dog with snappy bark, 
To catch at a 
butterfly. 
CHORUS : 
Oh now boys and girls beware 
And learn to mind your eye, 
While you are well enough 
Let well enough alone 
And don't catch a 
butterfly. 
When I 
sowed my oats I 
set up for a 
sport! 
And tho't it nice to take a 
drink and try 
"
1 To bet my money on the bobtailed nag," 
But " Mountain Girl" was quicker on the fly;. 
So I 
told my " Ma " just how I 
had been hurt, 
Said she to me" my son, oh mind your eye I 
Just every time you will resort 
To bet your money like a 
sport, 
You're alter a 
butterfly," 
Chorus. 
Then I 
did resolve to try and be a 
man--
A 
girl she shot an arrow in my eye; 
My heart went pi-ti-pi-ti-pat and so 
I 
feared, oh, dear 1 
I 
was a 
butterfly! 
"Pretty Mollie Jane," said I, " oh be my Queenr 
Said she, 
I will be yours, until I 
'Twas walking out upon the green, 
When nothing but the stars were seen, 
caught not a

Oh, I 
love you better than my life; 
Some one softly answers—in the days te be 
May I 
hope to win you for my wife? 
Many solemn vows are whispered there and thei. 
Many words are spoken soft and low; 
'Tis the same old story whispered o'er again, 
New to us as in the long ago. 
Down among the daisies, &( 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream; 
Nought shall ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the golden glimmer of our dream. 
Joys may come and go, like flowers that droop and die, 
But as long as life shall brightly gleam, 
We will cling together, darling, you and I, 
Down among the daisies by the stream.

I 
first beheld a

And we whispered and we lau lied so free, 
And of course we were as happy as could be, 
Oh her smiles they are as bright as the rays 
Of the sun that loves the dew ; 
Two hearts were moulded into one, 
Down where the pansies grew. 
The favor asked was but a 
bud, 
A 
rose t at she posessed ; 
The little flower love implied, 
And that I'd half confess'd ; 
Her cheeks were blushing ike the leaf, 
In all its rosy hue; 
That even lig I 
exchanged a 
kiss, 
Down where the pansies gr. w. 
And we whispered, .15c. 
The flowers faded, but her love 
Remains as bright and green; 
And since the day I've called her mine,

Don't Forget to be Kind to the Boys, 
Written expressly for LITTLE BOB by BEN DODGE. 
There is something which I 
wish to mention to you, 
While trying to please with my song. 
Some solid advice unto you I 
will give; 
Please listen its not very long. 
Your attention I'll call to the poor little boys 
You will meet on the street every day. 
Do not spurn them aside with a 
curse or a 
kick, 
When by chance they are thrown iu your way. 
Don't think they're too small to be noticed at atl, 
Let them share in your sorrows and joys. 
Their love will repay your kindness some day, 
Don't forget to be kind to the boys. 
If a 
poor boy accosts you while trying to earn, 
By honest means but half a 
dime, 
If you have it to spare, buy a 
paper at once, 
Or invest when he proffers a 
shine. 
He has loved ones at home who upon him depend, 
For the poor crusts of bread which they eat; 
And the brave honest boy to provide them with food, 
Has to labor each day in the street. 
Don't think they're too small, & c. 
The greatest of statesmen were once small like me, 
And no one can tell what's in store 
For a 
boy in the future if upright he proves, 
No matter if now he is poor. 
So unheeded don't pass the advice which I 
give; 
But by your applause let me see, 
That you promise to ever be kind to the boys, 
And I 
hope you'll begin here with me. 
Cnosus 
Don't think I'm too small to be noticed at all, 
But kindly give me your applause. 
My love will repay your kindness some day, 
Don't forget I 
am one of the boys.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
CHORUS: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants.

went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a

friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geogifan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Howld your tongues " then said he to the loafers 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

I

gal 
She's a 
stunner, she's a 
bouncer, 
Her given name is Sal, 
And she wears a

I

She couldn't dance at all, 
Wasn't she a 
fine gal, 
With a 
waterfall. 
CHORUS— 
Then oh, oh, I 
must find her, 
I 
must find her; 
Oh, oh, I 
wonder where she lives, 
Yonder, yonder is her father's house, 
And that's where she lives. 
I'm looking for my Pete, 
He's a 
coming, he's a 
coming, 
I 
seen him down the street, 
Oh, don't he look sweet.

And resses up so fine, 
All the gals in the town 
Thinks he cuts a

The sweetest treasure life can give 
I 
clasp unto my heart to-day, 
And childhood's golden moments live 
In dreams that soon must fade away. 
I 
see my angel mother's face, 
I 
hear her voice so true and brave, 
Her smile beams out with hallowed grace, 
From thee, my rose from mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, 
That grassy mound where willows wave ; 
Oh precious gem of countless worth, 
My rose from angel mother's grave. 
What memories cluster around it now, 
Like jewels around some holy shrine; 
Her loving hands are on my brow, 
Her eyes so fondly gaze in mine. 
I 
seem to gather to my breast 
The place and comfort life would crave. 
And dewy tears so fond and blest 
Are thine, dear rose from mother's grave. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, &c. 
it whispers that she dwells afar, 
And watches o'er her loved ones here; 
Oh, brighter than the morning star 
Each thought of thee my mother dear. 
Thy loving arms again caress me 
With all the hope and joy they gave, 
While fondly to my lips I 
press 
Thy leaves, my rose from mother's grave. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, &c,

GOLDEN SHOWER. 
Written and composed by DAN SULLY. 
As sung with immense success by EMMA DEZODA. 
'Twas a 
pleasant morn in Spring, 
When the birds began to sing, 
And the flowers with their perfume filled the air; 
Carelessly I 
went along, 
Singing snatches from a 
song, 
When I 
espied a 
maid with a 
head of golden hair. 
She bestowed on me a 
smile, 
Fascinating all the while, 
And in her hand she held a 
little flower; 
Which she pinned upon my breast, 
And you can guess the rest, 
And I 
called her then my little f.rolden shower. 
Cuoaus. 
She's the angel of my dreams, ( Sym.) 
Her eye so loving beams, ( SYm.) 
Oh. my I 
she looked so gay, 
Like a 
little sunny ray, 
And I 
called her then my little golden shower. 
She said I 
will be thine, 
Then she put her hand in mine, 
And she softly laid her head upon my breast; 
I 
was in a 
whirl of bliss, 
When I 
asked her for a 
kiss, 
And her rosy lips to mine she shyly pressed. 
I 
clasped her in my arms, 
And I 
gloried in her charms, 
Which put me in a 
heaven of delight; 
And now I 
am her beau, 
And in the little church below, 
We'll married be just a 
week to-night. 
She's the angel, etc.

Words and music by H ARRY KENNEDY, ventriloquist. 
Music copyrighted 1878, by W M. H. 
KENNEDY, 128 Duffield street, 
Brooklyn, N. V. 
Sung with great success by the German emperor, Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days, 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, &c.

POOR WHITE SLAVE. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
AIR—Slavery Days. 
TOILING slowly, day by day, 'till his life has pass'd away, 
And they give him scarcely room to lay his head; 
He drudges, morn and night, to earn his scanty bite; 
All his luxuries are water, scorn and bread. 
They never sing his praise 'cept on election days; 
And they often call him scoundrel, tramp or knave; 
All the world may keep him down with many a 
sullen frown— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
CHORUS. 
No matter where it be still he never can be free; 
.The poor will ever have to stoop and crave. 
His coat is ragged, tore, let us kick him from the door— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
tireat Beecher tells the poor they are well enough, he's sure, 
If they get but bread and water all the while. 
If ever there is a 
hell they'll chuck him in pell mell; 
He will surely get the middle of the pile. 
We never look for joy, there's none for you or I; 
Still how our suffering hearts try to be brave; 
How it makes the tear-drops fall when they tell us after all 
We are nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
No matter where it be, etc. 
Those with riches hold full sway for their millions gaineth day; 
It has been our valiant legislator's boast, 
The slaves may put me in, but I'm sure ' twill be no sin, 
To always work for those who pay thE most; 
'Yet, still we can forgive, 'tis only while we live, 
When this mortal life is passing at the grave; 
Then we'll surely bless the day we so of ten heard them say 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave.

THE OLD FASHIONED HOME. 
Sang by NED BARRY at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre Comique. 
Broadway, New York. 
There's an old fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old fashioned gate by the old country road. 
And an old fashioned man near the chair; 
An old fashioned woman is sitting there, 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old fashioned head 
And she's dressed in her old fashioned clothes. 
CHORUS: 
hear those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my soul with a 
thrill; 
'Tis the old fashioned sound from them old fashioned bells, 
In that old fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on that old whitewashed 
wall, 
With its old fashioned pendulum and hands; 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace, 
With its bright copper kettles and pans; 
An old fashioned man is sitting there, • 
Smoking his old fashioned clay; 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. 
Heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live for many 
years, 
In that dear, little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness to share 
And think of the dear, old happy days; 
The same I 
wish to you, with a 
heart of conscience true 
May you live, yes, for many, many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best of 
health, 
It is the earnest wish I 
give to you.

I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
The place I 
want to see, 
The place I 
used to wander, 
It was so dear to me; 
I 
was happy with old massa, 
When living in the lane, 
So I'se traveling back to Georgia. 
I 
will say goodbye to you. 
CHORUS: 
I'm traveling back,—Sym. 
Yes, traveling back,—Sym. 
I'm gwine back again, 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
For to see my home again. 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
The place where I 
was born; 
Where I 
used to hoe the cotton, 
The sugar cane and corn; 
I'm getting old and feeble, 
And tired of roaming, too; 
So I'm gwine back to Georgia, 
I 
will say good-bye to you. 
(Chorus.) 
Sung with great success by Barlow, Wilson, Primrose & West's Minstrels. 
Round de meadows am a 
ringing 
The darkies' mournful song, 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
Happy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a 
creeping 
O'er the grassy mound, 
There old massa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold ground. 
Down in the corn-field 
Hear that mournful sound; 
All the darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground. 
\\Then the autumn leaves were falling, 
When the days were cold, 
'Twas hard to hear old massa calling, 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, 
Now the summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
Down in the corn -.field SK; 
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning, for he leave them behind.

Copyright, 1878, by ITAmusoN MILLARD. 
Sung with tremendous success by W. FRED AYSIAR, America's 
Greatest Grotesque Clown. 
There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall; 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom. 
For no one now uses that back parlor room; 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, thy sister and I; 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would tell 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
CHORUS: 
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat hi that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neatti the stirs and the stripes he fought bravely and true 
He cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Chorus). 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one; 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by and- bye," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her c 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
(Chorus).

OH FRED, TELL THEM TO STOP. 
Written and composed by GEORGE MEEN. 
Sang by Enwnl BARRY. His latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went in you must know, and saw Barnum's show, 
Van Amburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of things 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
DIALOGUE.—Yes! when we got in the fair, my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. 
I 
said, all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, she 
lustily cried— 
Cilonus: 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
DIALOGUE.—And Maria still cried out at the top of her 
voice— ( Chorus). 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl I 
now do adore; 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round-about, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALOGUE.—And when you take a 
girl with you, make 
her promise she won't call out— 
(Chorus).

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills, 
I've wandered there many a 
happy day; 
In looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the fine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her coming, but she's not come as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain; 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean ! 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, my Jean, 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
When our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

Bonnets and ribbons she does sell; 
On the Bowery she owns a

She has " Milliner " on the door, 
And Augustine Delia Clancey that's the hell'. 
Shure it's every Sunday night,

To go up Miss Clancey for to see. 
A 
grand piano she plays so fine, 
To me she is divine, 
And all those lovely songs she sings to me.

She sings, she sings Sweet Bye and Bye, 
And go to sleep my Baby Mine. 
She sings, she sings such pretty tunes,

love I'll marry soon. 
There is Owen Smith and Grady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all so fine. 
Sure Smithy has comical talk, 
And such a 
funny walk, 
Which causes all the party for to smile. 
When Miss Clancey does appear 
Such curious things you'll hear, 
" 
Miss Clancey, dear, you're looking all serene," 
She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me.

On a

He can eat a

He makes faces at the women, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
In a

Baby mine—baby mine. 
Out of the ash-pan we do yank him; 
In his high chair we do plank him, 
Oh, heavens! how we spank him, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
His face would cave a 
bank in, 
Baby mine. 
At the table he is queer, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
Stuffs the pan cakes in his ear, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Rubs molasses on his nose, 
Spills the mustard on his clothes, 
lie jabs the hash between his toes, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
And we wash him with a 
hose. 
Baby mine.

DL1MPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by cat 
the _Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called H IIMPTY Dumr-rY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear, 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it. "—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
