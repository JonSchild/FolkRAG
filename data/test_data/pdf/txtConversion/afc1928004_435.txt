AIN'T HE A 
BABY. 
Words and music by Tut ROGERS, as sung by him with great 
success at HARRIGAN & 1LART'S Theater Comique. 
I 
AM a. swell. 
I 
lead the style: 
I'm not Champagne Charlie nor Tommy Coaloil. 
But you can see plain by my winning ways 
That I 
am a 
man that has seen better days. 
But for all that I 
don't care a 
straw, 
For I'm just as lively as ever, ha, ha I 
The pet of the girls I 
meet every day, 
And as tIwy pass by inc this is what they say.

Oh, my, ain't he a 
baby' 
Look at his walk—it's just like a 
lady 
Oh dear, I 
believe it is Grady 
Look at his nice curly hair. 
Look at me well. 
Do I 
look green ? 
I 
have an eye that can capture a 
queen. 
With my graceful walk T 
make their heads whirl; 
My great Colorados the harbors do curl. 
I 
am a 
gambler at high jack and 'ow; 
I 
can play seven out and the great casino. 
There's no use in talking, now don't I 
look sweet? 
For as the girls pass me yegi'll hear them repeat: 
Oh, my, etc.

THE DONKEY. 
Words and Music by the late JAMES BRADLEY. 
As sung with 
great success all over the country by TIM ROGERS. 
I'VE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
1'11 sell to the man that wishes to buy. 
Ile drinks Seltzer Water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
race on the turf he has never proved shy; 
Ile makes good time—about one mile a 
day. 
I'll match him again any stallion or bay. 
lie fought for his country, he's been through the war; 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope, and tar. 
CHORUS. 
I've got a 
donkey, he's not very chunky, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey, to any old flunkey, 
Now wouldn't that be hanky, if ho had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, my donkey also ? 
If he's locked in the stable he'll make a 
stiff kick; 
If he wants to get out he'll pretend he is sick ; 
I 
call out my donkey—his name it is Dick. 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick. 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up and leave none for next day. 
Last week he broke loose, and he got astray; 
He was found in a 
sower in Avenue A. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay, 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We rode to the hall, without any delay. 
Just as we were passing by Central Park, 
A 
boy fired a 
pistol off, just for a 
lark, 
The donkey loll down, which caused a 
blockade, 
Only for fifty horso-dvetors he'd spoil the parade. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc. 
MY MARY ANN, 
Words and Music by TIM ROGERS. As sung by him with great 
success, at Harrigan & Hart's, Theatre Comique. 
I'VE got a 
sweet-heart, she looks like a 
queen, 
Tier hair it is red, and her age is sixteen, 
She's from Kildare, she's not very green, 
She's one of the fairest your eyes ever seen, 
She sings " Eileen Allanna," plays on the piano, 
With a 
voice soprano, that's cozy and sweet, 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killarney" 
She frightens the children off of the street. 
CHORUS. 
You should see Mary, she's light as a 
fairy, 
Sings like a 
canary, from ould Tipperary, 
She is not airy, she attends to the dairy, 
She's never contrary, my own Mary Ann. 
I 
took lovely Mary one night to a 
ball, 
To a 
massacred hop, down to Walhalla Hall; 
She swung the side quadrille the best of them all, 
But get her to dance, faith I 
couldn't at all. 
Says I, lovely Mary, will you waltz the next quadrille? 
Says she, excuse me, Levi, I'm losing my health. 
Her corns they did ache her, she took off her shoo, 
And in two minute's time she had the ball to herself. 
You should see iSfary, etc. 
When the dancing was over, sonic man sung a 
song, 
And in popped a 
nagur, and struck a 
big gong, 
He shouted out fire, and she flow straight along. 
She fell down the steps, and I 
thought he was gone; 
I 
caught her and convinced her the gong went for supper,, 
She sat down to the table, and done it up brown, 
The fruit that she eat was onions find garlic; 
The perfume from her breath would knock a 
man down. 
You should see Mary, etc. 
THE IRISH INVITATION. 
Words and Music by Ttm ROGERS. 
Goon-Evuxtso, neighbors all, I've come to make a 
call, 
I'm going to give you all a 
little warning, 
I 
haven't been this way for a 
week or so to-day, 
And now I've come to see my little darling. 
She's the sweetest ever seen, with her flounces trimmed in 
green. 
She's the primrose of Ireland, and her age is seventeen, 
It will be on next Sunday night when I 
wed that little queen, 
And I'm going to give you all an invitation. 
CHORUS. 
We will -dance (sym.), and we will sing (sym.), 
And we will raise the very divil in the nation, 
Now, laddies, don't you fail, wo will have a 
keg of ale,

How happy I 
will be, when my Mary marries mo? 
Then I

happy as the days are long, I 
will sing a 
little song, 
And I'll bo the happiest man in all the nation; 
I 
will give a 
hearty cheer, and I'll take my glass of beer, 
I

wed my little dear.

When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation.

GO FIGHT SITTING BULL,. 
Words and music by TIM ROGERS, as sung by him with great 
success at SHELBY'S A.delphi, Buffalo. 
MY 
dacent acquaintances, I'm now going to tell 
Of a 
gang of young blackguards stands down on the street; 
'rho slang that they are using, I 
believe themselves choosing, 
A 
gang of worse boys you can't find in the State. 
The neighbors do tell me that my stepson, Phelix, 
Is the very worst one in the gang when he's full. 
I 
have told him to drop it, says he to me " cheese it! • 
Go out to the Black Hills and fight Sitting Bull." 
It was only last night that I 
went to a 
party 
With a 
friend named MeGuflin to Hibernia Hall. ' 
What was going on sure I 
can't well remember, 
But I 
think that they called it a 
massacred ball. 
Says a 
lady to me, " will you dance the Tra, in, la?" 
" 
in, loo," says I, - why you talk like your full!" 
Says she, " sherry your nobbs and drive down to your partner, 
And go out to the Black Hills and fight Sitting Bull." 
A low months ago I 
went over to Long Branch 
To take care of some horses for Mike Muldoon's aunt. 
I 
went to the beach with a 
young man a 
bathing, 
Sure who did we seo there but General Grant. 
With us he got into a 
great conversation, 
lie talked of tho times and said they were dull. 
Says he, " where will I 
go to when my Our is over 
Says I, " go to the divii and fight Sitting Bull!"

THE APPLE WOMAN',$ LAMENT, 
A SCOTCH SONG. 
Is 
sung by CLARA Moom4. 
My young mon was a 
shamus horn, 
A 
grand piano tuner, 
But he ran away from me one day. 
On board of Hecry Schooner, 
And loft me here, heart broken ; 
When I 
would rather sooner 
Have sold off my old apple stand,

had upon the corner. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, his name was Bill, a 
granite chap, 
Oh, wouldn't I 
like to find him ; 
But he's o'er the sea, t1W£11 from me, 
And the lassie left behind him. 
In his stockings he stood six foot throe, 
I've a 
likeness in a 
locket, 
And a 
little piece of curly hair 
I 
cut from his whiskers, in my pocket. 
made a 
clover policeman, 
But he's gone off like a 
rocket, 
And left me with my apple stand, 
Still standing on the corner. 
Oh, his name, etc. 
I'm scudding under bare poles now, 
My own sad fate bewailing, 
And thinking of the night, alas! 
We parted at the railing. 
And when he swore upon his ' bacca box, 
Before the ship was sailing, 
By his bulwarks, stanchions, jibs find booms, 
Ho would be true to rue 
Oh, his name, etc.

'ME BUMMER'S EXORDIUM, 
By JIMMY, the LUSH. 
The life of a 
Bummer is the life for me I 
None other so jolly nor half so free ; 
As from rumhole to rumhole I 
wend my way. 
Drinking and snoozing. night and day. 
Of greenbacks, ' tis true, I've no great share ; 
llnt little care I 
for such small ware 
When I'm out of stamps Were hard to think 
But what some other _
Bummer would stand a 
drink! 
For breakfast or dinner I 
don't much care; 
Rum is the staple of my fare ; 
Free luncheons suffice me ; and no'or should I 
think 
To waste money on food that would purchase drink 3 
I 
once had a 
wife, a 
child, a 
home; 
But I 
left them all tho streets to roam ; 
Mother and child are long since dead; 
She broke her heart when he cried for bread! 
But what care I 
for child or wife, 
Compared with the joys of a 
Bummer's life ? 
As from rumhole to rumhole I 
wend my way, 
Drinking and snoozing night and day! 
But an end must come to the Bummer's life. 
When he must follow his child and wife ; 
He won't tzouble them more, for in Heaven they'li 
dwell, 
When he is i

A 
PACK OF ALL JACKS. 
Sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL, 
AIR—Man in the Moon. 
I 
SPEAK by the card, just to tell you sonic facts, 
In life's little game we are all of us Jacks; 
Upstart-Jacks-in-ollice, sonic fellows we see, 
And Jacks-in-the-water, teatotallers on tea.. 
If the ixior got rich Jack-Puddings ah the year round, 
As fat as Jack Falstaff they'd always be found, 
All Gulliver's travelers, of course, are Jack Brags, 
And paupers in tatters, why, they are Jack Rags. 
CHORUS. 
firo all play our cards, to win money and fame, 
gis pity, but true, there are knaves la life's game, 
But no Jacks of trumps tin the Queen turn their hack, 
hold your whist while I 
deal out my pack of all Jacks. 
A 
general dealer's a 
Jack-of-all-trades, 
The gt .
Avedigger I 
may denote Jack of Spades; 
Jack of Viamonds, the jeweller, who precious stones roc. 
And John wailers at Pall Mall I 
lotels„fack of Clubs. 
A 
man of artistic attainments and parts, 
A 
painter or ocullitor is a 
Jacl,: of Arts (hearts), 
And a 
Johnny n 
emerald livery seen, 
I 
think I 
may c411 him a 
Jack-in-the- Green. 
We all play, &c. 
A 
rich grocer, in, as Jack Horner, may come, 
, Who puts in his finget and pulls out a 
plain; 
The bobby's Jack Keter, chasing fellows who rob, 
When he catches, and gives the prig one for his nob.

Old ni.sers are Screw Jacks, with hearts mad as rocks, 
Undertakers get here, British Jack- hi-the-Box; 
But the old way they bury's, so queer, and so dear, 
We really do want Jack of New-bury here. 
We all play, &c. 
John Bulls in the workhouse are all Union Jacks, 
Our sailor Jack Tars fear no despot's attacks. 
In Lancashire starving Jack Bull's don't, despair. 
Tho' too many have Jack-o-lantern jaws there. 
They are all game cards, too, and let us hope, that 
Their dinners may not be confined to Jack Sprat; 
And wish, tho' their savings and chattels they've lust, 
They Indy not feel too keenly the country Jack Frost! 
We all play, &c. 
In my pack of all Jacks, I 
could pick as I 
pass, 
On the Continent-, many a 
royal Jack (donkey), 
Who eiivics old England her commerce and tin, 
And a /a 
Jack Sheppard ‘vould like to break in; 
There's one Johnny Crappard, sometimes called Jack !Frog, 
Would very much like to steel here in a 
fog; 
But the jackanapes step it quick, would be his plan. 
And, in doi.og so, prove he's allied to Jack Ran! ( n)

THE BRIDGE, 
As Sting by JonN NY ROAGII. 
STOOD on the bridge at nmideight, 
As the clocks. were striking 1 
he how 
And the moon rose o'er the city, 
fiehind tin dark church-tower. 
And, like tbe waters rushing 
Among the wooden piers, 
A 
flood of thoughts came o'er me, 
That filled my eyes with tears— 
How often, oh ! how often, 
In the days that lit gone by, 
I 
had stood on that bridge, at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky ! 
now often, oh ! how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stook.. on that bridge, at midnight 
And gazed cm. that wave and sky ! 
How often, oh ! how often, 
I 
had wished that that ebbing tide 
Wouid bear me away on its bworrt, 
O'er the oe.nan wild and wide I 
For my heart was hot and restless, 
And my life was full of care: 
And the burthen laid upon me 
Seemed greater than I 
could lre;:' 
But now it has fallen from me, 
It les buried in the sea: 
15 
And only the sorrow of others 
Throws its shadow over me; 
Yet, whenever I 
cross the river, 
On its bridge with wooden piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the ocesA 
Commies the thought of other years: 
And for over, and for ever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passim-
1pm, 
As long as life has woes. 
The moon and its broken reflection, 
And its shadows shall appear

BACK TO THE OULD DART AGAIN. 
Written by neon J. 
GALL1N. 
Dedicated to SHEEHAN & 
Joi.rus, the great Irish wrest-
lers. 
We are two sons of Erin, 
We just came over here, 
From far across the ch:ep blue sea, 
From a 
place we love so dear ; 
With main and might, day and night, 
Our efforts have been in vain, 
We had no rest, so we think it best 
To go back to the Ould Dart again 
CIIORLTS. 
Oh, why did we ever lave it, (
sym„) 
Our hearts they now crave it (
sym) 
We are two M811111,1', 
Both with mighm and main ; 
All day we tread for work and bread, 
We'll go back to the Ould Dart again. 
When we left old Ireland, 
With spirits light and tree, 
We took a 
trip in a 
great big ship, 
And landed in America ; 
The politicians met us, 
And said to us quite plain— 
Tweed with a 
pang, gave away the gang, 
And is back to the Ould Dart again. 
Oh, why, etc. 
And now, kind friends, we'll say good bye, 
We'll sing to you no wore, 
We're going, to cross the raging sea, 
To the home We do adore ; 
And if we have not pleased you, 
We hope you won't complain, 
But with just cause give us applause, 
We're going back to the Ould Dart again. 
Oh, why, etc. 
As sung by the Monarchs, W ALTER8 & M OUTON. 
I 
SUPPOSE you have all Leen in love 
On 80111.0 occasion or other, 
So have I, with a 
turtle dove, 
And would have married her, but for her brother, 
her name is sour, but she is sweet, 
Her cognomen it is Pickles, 
And when I 
ever chance to meet, 
My heart she always tickles. 
Owns. 
Bridget Pickle, [Svmr.1 
Thou art so tickle, Lsx-mr.) 
With love's sickle, [Svmr.) 
Thou has tickled my heart away front me, 
She'd teeth like cross eyed rows of corn, 
Her countenance was vegetation; 
She's turned the heads of every swain, 
And dandelion in creation. 
Her cheek is reddish—like a 
beet, 
Her turn-up nose with talking wiggles, 
With carroty hair and double I 
XX.1 feet., 
She isn't sour, although she's pickles. 
Bridget Pickle, Le. 
I 
followed her to her parents' house, 
And saw the number on the door, 
I 
silently glided—quiet as a 
mouse, 
To catch a 
glance of her eye once more, 
he looked at me, oh, my! how sweet, 
It went through my heart like an arrow, 
I'll try some day to marry her, 
Tho' all my feelings she's harrowed. 
Bridget Pickle, .ke..

We're a 
happy Irish pair you see, 
And we lately came from dear old Tipperary ; 
Where the Irish boys are happy as can be, 
And the Coleens fair you'll never find contrary ; 
We can sing and dance the whole day long, 
Our hearts are ever gay; 
And -when you see our movements, 
I

That no other style that's in the land, 
Outrivals that of Mike arid Kate O'Leary ; 
We've lately come across the sea. 
From that dear old spot they call it Tipperary. 
[Dance, regular Irish Breakdown.] 
When we landed upon Columbia's shores, 
Among the boys we caused a 
great sensation ; 
For its we Said to you before, 
We're the happiest Irish that's in the nation ; 
Whether hero or there, it's all the same, 
No matter where we go, 
Our movements seems to pleaso you, 
When We twist our heel and toe ; 
We ask of you your hind applause, 
'Twill help to nuile our hearts fool light and airy, 
And we'll finish with a

And show you how it's done in Tipperary.

We are two Irish laborers, 
As you can plainly see ; 
From Donegal, we came when small, 
Unto Aperiky. 
We got work on the railroad, 
But sure it did'ut pay, 
So we got a 
job to carry the hod, 
At two- and-a-half a 
day. 
CHORUS. 
Pat be quick 1 
bring uo the brick ! 
The mortar too, likewise : 
Then push along, and sing a 
song, 
And up the ladder rise ; 
I 
always thought ' twas bully fun 
To be a 
mason's clerk. 
And have the man upon the 
Top of the house do all the work. 
When we go back to Ireland, 
That dear old Emerald Isle, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome, 
And is greeted with a 
smile ; 
And if you ever want a 
friend, 
You need'nt try too hard— 
You can always find one 
In the Irish Boys that carry the - hod. 
Pat be quick ! 
Then here's success to Ireland ! 
The land that gave us birth ; 
The pride of every Irish heart 
And the dearest spot on earth. 
Let every true born Irishman 
That has his feet well shod, 
Turu out in honor of the 
Irish Boys that carry the hod.

THE IRISH BOY'S LAMENT. 
Written and sung by JOHNNY Roecn, the snecossful Irish Vocalist 
FAREWELL, Ireland, I 
can no longer dwell at home, I 
must 
cross the stormy main, 
Where cruel strife may end my life, to see you ne'er again, 
It will break my heart from you to part, astore acushala machreo. 
But 1 
must go full of grief and woe, to the shores of America. 
Bo now farewell, I 
can no longer dwell 
At home, acusliala machree, 
But I 
must go, full of grief and woe, 
To the shores of America. 
On the Irish soil my fathers lived since the days of Erin Banoa, 
They paid their rent and lived content, convenient to Kilidew, 
But a 
landlord cruel gave us the shuel, my poor old mother and 
me, 
We had to leave our home, far away to roam, and come to 
America. 
So now, &c. 
No more in the old churchyard, astore, on my father's grave 
shall I 
kneel, 
Bat the tyrant knows, but little of the woes, that a 
poor boy 
has to reel; 
When 1 
look around, on that little spot of ground, where the 
cabin used to he, 
I 
could Curse the laws, that gave me cause to come to America, 
So now, ktc. 
Oh, where are the neighbois, kind and true, that was once ot; 
country's pride, 
No more they are seen, at the fair on the green, or the dance 
by the green bill side. 
"Pis a 
stranger's cow, that is grazing now, where the cabin 
used to be 
With notice they were served to be turned out and starved, or 
conic) to America. 
So now, &A; 
Oh, Erin Machree, must your children be exiled all over the 
earth, 
Must they think no more of you, astore, of the land that gave 
them birth, 
Must the Irish yield, like the beasts of the field; no, no, acush-
ala macbree, 
They are going away in ships, with veirranee on their lips, to 
return to Autet;,
ica. 
So now,. &c. 
Ile.—I'VE come far over the hills, 
My colicen for to see, 
The moon is up in the sky, 
I 
wonder where she can be ? 
Tim Rooney, the bogtrotting elf, 
To my Mary did propose, 
If I 
catch him at it again, 
I'll break his ugly nose. 
[Enter Mary L 
She.—My Pat is standing there, 
lie's waiting too for me, 
The finest lad is he, 
From the Liffey to to the ses. 
I 
love him so dearly too, 
But my brain in anger whirls, 
When I 
see him at the Pair, 
Kissing the other girls. 
He.—Ah I 
there you are my dear, 
It is yourself I 
see, 
She.—Now, plaze your distance kape, 
Go talk to Biddy McGee ; 
I 
saw you at the fair, 
With your arm around her waist. 
musn't mind that darling, 
It's only an Irishman's taste. 
She.—I'm glad you told me that, 
Your taste is mighty fine, 
Her nose it does turn up, 
And in one eye she is blind; 
He.—But the other one is good, 
With such a 
winning lurch; 
She.--Her tongue it runs as fast, 
As the clock in the village church. 
He.— But she has lots of pigs, 
Which is quite good you know, 
She.—She's got a 
hump on her back, 
And her legs bend like a 
bow ; 
He.—She's forty pounds in the bank, 
Perhaps a 
pound or two more, 
She.—Her mouth runs from ear to ear, 
As big as the chapel door. 
He.—But Mary has a 
snug cabin. 
She.—Well haven't I, you spooney. 
He.—But yours you know Mary, 
Has been axit by Tim. Rooney: 
She.—Do you think it's the likes of him, 
That could get the likes of me, 
I 
hate that spal peen as bad, as 
He.—You do poor Biddy McGee-
He.—Mary, there's one thing I 
think, 
Will surely plaze your taste. 
Just put your arm in mine, 
And let's go unto the Praste ; 
She.—Is it the truth, you're spaking now, 
Or may feelings wish to try ?— 
He.— Let's get married now, darling, 
And--
She.—[SrokENJ Well, what's the matter now, Paddy ?

was known throughout the country, 
And devil the one with me could dance; 
I 
was the first in every nation— 
And drunk when I 
had the chance; 
I 
used to drive the women crazy, 
So nimbly I 
could shake my feet; 
'I hey never found me slow or lazy, 
At jigging I 
could not be beat.

MY features they are quite familiar, 
All the ladies know me well ; 
On Broadway I

On the corners I

Good evening, in 
fri lids, you're all looking well, 
I 
came here to see you and my troubles to tell 
Whin I 
go along the street the boys at me stare, 
And they all holler out, " John, they want you -for Mayor!" 
The other day, walking down Baxter street, 
One fellow said I 
looked like a 
beat, 
I 
ran for the blackguard and pulled down his hair, 
And he shouted out " John, they want you for Mayor!" 
Their shouting at me I 
now understand, 
It's because they want my education and land. 
They'll never get nothing from me, I 
do swear, 
Unless they all say " John, we want you for Mayor 1"

We left old Ireland four weeks ago to day, 
For the City of New York in the State of America

Hurrah for the ould sod,

Where we saw the first light of day, 
But the rent and taxes and the famine, 
It drove us all away; 
Oh Judy, Oh Darby;

When old Ireland's like America, 
Shall wave the Banner of the free;

Oh when we have the stamps, 
We'll let Congress go to the divil, 
And ate oysters at Long Branch, 
But if Ireland had a

And a

Free from tyrants like America, 
Sure ' tis that we'd make our home, 
Oh Judy, oh Darby ;

I 
love an Irish boy now, Paddy that's his name, 
Laughing Paddy, jolly Paddy, he loves me the same; 
'Twas a 
fine Summer's night, 
And the morn was shining bright, 
I 
met Paddy, my darling, my true one. 
He told me that he'd be true, 
And I 
said I 
loved him too, 
Then we commenced to sparking, 
Down by the brook at the end of the lane, 
Of the future and our love we both were talking. 
(Dance.) 
About a 
year has passed, and the time is coming fast. 
When myself and Paddy shall be one at last ; 
Then we'll settle down, in a

We'll be happy and jolly, 
And in quarreling we'll not be found.

KEOCH O'LEARY. 
A recitation delivered all over the United States by Wm. 
SCANLAN, in W M. SCANLAN'S original sketch, entitled 
PREPARING FOR THE STAGE. 
As performed by ScAxLA & Cnosix, the celebrated Versatile 
Sketch Artists, Vocalists and Dancers. 
One summer day, long, long ago, 
-When I 
was a 
Ii Ale fellow, 
A piper wandered to our door, 
Grey- headed, blind and yellow. 
And ah I 
how glad was my young heart, 
Though the sky and earth looked dreary, 
When I 
saw the stranger and his dog, 
Poor Pinch and Keoch O'Leary. 
And when he stowed away his bags, 
Crossed barred, green and yellow. 
I 
thought and said in all Ireland's ground, 
There's not so fine a 
fellow— 
And Fenian Burke and Shaun McGee, 
And lily, Kate and Mary, 
Rushed in with panting heart to see, 
And Welcome Keoch O'Leary. 
Well, Keoch and Pinch slept well that night; 
And in the morning early 
lie woke me up to hear him play, 
The wind that break the barley. 
Then he stroked my flaxen hair, 
And murmured Mack you deary, 
And how I 
wept when he said farewell, 
And think of Keoch O'Leary. 
Well twenty summers have gone past, 
And June's red sun was sinking, 
When, a 
man, stood by my door, 
Of twenty sad things thinking. 
A 
little dog came up the lane, 
his steps was slow and weary, 
And at his tail a 
lame man limped : 
'Twas Pinch and Keoch O'Leary, 
53 
Ah, Keoch! 
But ah I 
how wobegone— 
Ms 
form is bowed and bending. 
His fleshless hands are thin and wan, 
And time is ever blending 
The color of his thread bare. 
bags; 
And Pinch is twice as hairy, 
And thin- spare as when last I 
saw, 
Himself and Keoch O'Leary. 
God's blessing here I 
the wanderer cried. 
Far, far! befell black viper; 
Does anybody here about, 
Remember Keoch, the Piper? 
'es, yes I 
I 
said; the old Irian wept 
As if his heart was breaking. 
And where avic maehree, he cried, 
Ts all the merry making 
.1 left here twenty years ago? 
My,
 :iale I 
sighted might weary; 
Enough to say, there's none but me, 
To welcome Keoch O'Leary. 
Woe I 
woe! the wanderer cried, 
And wrung his hands in sorrow. 
Pray lead me in, asthore machree, 
And I'll go home to- morrow; 
My peace is made I'll calmly leave, 
This world so lone and dreary, 
And you can have my pipes and dog, 
And pray for Keoch O'Leary. 
With Pinch I 
watched his bed that night, 
Next day his prayer was granted. 
fie died, and Father James was called, 
And the requiem mass was chanted. 
The neighbors came, we dug his grave 
Near lily, Kate and Mary. 
And there he sleeps his last sweet sleep. 
Ood rest you, Keoch O'Leary,

THE LAD FROM IRELAND 
Composed and sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
I'M one of them curious roving young blades,„ 
That don't care a 
snap whatever I'm at; 
I 
can handle the stick though I 
was raised to the spasi, 
In the land where the buttermilk flows. 
It's there you will find the colleens are fair, 
And the boys are as brave as can be; 
There a 
stranger is welcome, no matter trona where, 
And receives hospitality free. 
Ciionns. 
For I'm the lad from Ireland, ha, ha ! from Ireland, ha. ha ! 
from Ireland, ha, ha! 
For I'm the lad from Ireland, ha, ha! of my country I 
ne'er 
was ashamed, hurrah! 
When at home my delight was a 
fine jaunting car, 
With my lassie so dear I'd drive to the fair, 
And there on the green we'd trip light as air, 
There was none that with us could compare. 
But if a 
spalpeen would dare make too bold, 
Or my girl he'd dare to offend, 
would soon draw my eahine and then crack his pole, 
For the girl I 
was sure to deleud. 
For I'm the lad, So. 
Whenever I 
could, the girls I'd annoy, 
To my perfect joy they'd call me their boy. 
And many a 
one that dropped a 
salt tear, 
When I 
left dear old Ireland s,) 
far. 
I 
could dance e. neat jig, or sing a 
good song, 
Or at leirly for a 
wager I'd play, 
There's none that loves his native land 
That dear Emerald Isle of the Sea. 
For I'm the lad, (to. 
ONE -Mick MaeGee, from Arranafee, who once was a 
nold 
sailor oh, 
But growing old, as I've been told, he turned a 
liquor dealer 
To license Mick would not agree, or pay the excise bounty 
oh, 
But he sould away, both night and day, and beat the excise 
of the county oh. 
CHORUS. 
Arrah grammachree conic drink with me, 
The liquor law won't injure me, 
Arndt grammachree come drink with me, 
The liquor law won't injure me, 
rwo policemen bold, as I've bwn told, heard Mick was 
selling on the sly, 
So off they went, with full intent to get a 
liottle they did try, 
They went in then, dressed like rag-men, and took a 
seat 
down in the shop, 
Asked Mis, MaeGee if so kind she'd be, as to give them a 
bottle, of the real ould drop. 
Arrah grammachree, &c. 
A 
thought struck her then, that she knew the men, and a 
big black bottle she went and got, 
;e went into the room saying 
be back soon, and she fiil. 
ed it nicely up with slops, 
Il let you see, says Mrs. MacGee, the liquor I 
sell is the 
real mild stock, 
tLs she filled it right, she corked it tight, and she got two 
dollars for a 
bottle of slops. 
Arrah grammachree, & s. 
!'he police in glee an off do you see, and stated the case to 
Kennedy, 
Who opened his eyes at cheating the excise, go bring your 
prisoner at once to me, 
You say she did sell, as he took a 
smell, [Phezr] and what 
did you pay for the bottle you got ? 
rwo dollars said they, we had to pay, why you foolish men, 
its nothing but slops, 
lamb grammachree, &c. 
The police in dread hung down their heads. when they saw 
nicely they were done, 
Away they went from Kennedy, with the stinking bottk 
they thought was: rum, 
And 3liek MaeGee and his wife Mary, keep selling away, 
:it the same old spot, 
And if a 
spy, or a 
policeman comes around ishe gives then-. 
a 
bottle of the real old stock.

THE LABORING MAN FOR ME. 
Written expressly for, and sung by the MURDOCH& 
Don't talk to me of kings and earls, 
Wearing crowns and coronets, 
The men who snub our boys and girls, 
But never pay their debts; 
But give me those who work and strive.. 
To gain success at last, 
The man who labors hard to thrive, 
And never lives too fast. 
CHORUS 
Then cheer him on! cheer him on! 
The laboring man for me, 
Cheer him on! cheer him on! 
The man jf honesty ; 
Cheer him on ! help him on I 
The free- born man of toil, 
The laboring man for me, boys, 
The honor to our soil, 
Give him a 
place among the great, 
With those whose names aro stainless, 
He'd be a 
blessing to the State, 
How he'd bounce the brainless! 
Their hands are rough their hearts are pure, 
They're down on tyranny, 
The man I'd like, though he be poor, 
The laboring man for me. 
Then cheer him on, etc.

PETERS, 590 Broadway, New York City. 
Come, love, let me kiss the sweet blushes ay.-ay, 
That bloom on your cheeks like the roses of Hay : 
Those lips full 6.7 
nectar, I 
fondly would press, 
And give you a 7entle, a 
loving caress ; 
There's none that ig sweeter more blithesome and gay, 
Than you, pretty blossom, sweet Maggie McKay. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, love, let me kiss the sweet blushes away, 
That bloom on your cheeks like the roses of May: 
There's none that is sweeter, more blithesome and gay, 
Than you, pretty blossom, sweet Maggie McKay. 
Oh, come, little darling, and fly to this breast. 
And let your brown curls in tranquillity rest ; 
The spring of my life on your image is shed, 
And happiness truly shines over your head : 
There's none that is dearer, oh, list what I 
say, 
For you are a 
darling, sweet Maggie McKay. 
Oh, love, let me kiss, &c. 
Oh, love, may a 
sorrow ne'er wither thy face, 
That has not as yet felt the 1,ast HUI:. trace ; 
May days, over joyous, roll on to their close, 
Thy heart never know of this life's bittcr woes ; 
There's none that is fonder, more bright than the dar, 
None half so bewitching, as Maggie McKay.

The words of this Song are published armonymously, and from 
Chair extreme martial character many would suppose them to be 
the production of some enthusiastic Highlander ; the absence of 
the writer's name might, at Arst, be intended to favor that conclu-
sion ; but now it is generally ascribed to the accomplished Author-
ess of the " Lays from Strathern." The music is original and very 
effective. 
There's many a 
man of the Cameron Clan 
That has followed his chief to the field, 
He has sworn to support him or die by his side, 
For a 
Cameron never can yield. 
CHORUS. 
I

sounding deep o'er the mountains and glens, 
While light springing footsteps are trampling ( he heath.
