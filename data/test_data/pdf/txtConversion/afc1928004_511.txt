Good-Bye, Lovely Lou. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS, the greatest of all vocalists, with 
tremendous success. 
Copyright, 1879, by Lows P. GOULLARD. 
'Twas early in the month of May, 
said to my girl Lou; 
As I 
am going far away, 
I'm going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea, 
She bowed her lovely head. 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And I 
to her then said, 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea and I 
will thin'- of you. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
an't told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now Lou don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
Good-bye, 8:c. 
I've one thing. Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I 
am going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, &c. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore, 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
That she had gone away; 
So now, as Lou has proved untrue, 
Why I 
can only say— 
Good-bye,

A 
Flower From My Angel Mother's Grave. 
Words and music by H ARRY K ENNEDY, ventriloquist. 
Music copyrighted 1878, by W M. H . 
K ENNEDY, 128 Duffield street, 
Brooklyn, N. V. 
Sung with great success by the German emperor, Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days 
'Pis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, &c.

She Stood at the Gate Welcoming him in.

Copyrighted 1873 and published by W HITE, SMITH & CO., Boston. 
I 
,
P 
Vile dinking of my younger days, 
Vich vos some years ago, 
I 
dought of many boyhood tricks 
Vich do not happen now; 
Of games ye played, of fun ve had, 
Vich now has passed away, 
Of sentences they used to give, 
So difficult to say. 
SPOKEN—De sentences vos— 
CHORUS. 
She stood at the gate welcoming him in, 
She stood at the gate welcoming him in, 
She stood at the gate welcoming him in, 
I 
dink you'll find it difficult to say. 
" 
The-op-olis This-tie," it was hard, 
And " Peder Piper," too, 
' 
De road de ragged ruffian ran," 
• 
Time tries tricks tough and true." 
But dese I 
overcome mit ease, 
As older I 
became, 
And many harder vones I 
fought, 
But it remained de same. 
SPOKEN—Somehow or anoder, I 
never could say, " She 
stood at de gate welcoming him in ;" any oder sentence vos 
easy; und so I 
suppose I 
vill go all my lifetime trying to say— 
She stood at the gate, Sze.

Dancing round with Charlie, 
At the gay soiree, 
Ah ! so sweet, strangely sweet, 
Thus to dance the hours away. 
To a

Whirling light and free, 
Ah ! a 
pleasure dear, to have 
Charlie dance with me ; 
Round, round with nimble feet, 
Glide we to music sweet, ah !

Gliding round together, 
In a

Whispering soft words of joy, 
While in loving fond embrace. 
In a

Light and melody, 
Charm of thrilling power to have, 
Charlie dance with me. 
Round, round with nimble feet, 
Glide we to music sweet, ah !

The German Home Upon the Rhine. 
Written by DAVE ROSE. Sung by Gus WILLIAMS, 
My dear old German home dot stands upon de Rhine, 
I 
am thinking of you, and it breaks my heart; 
I 
left you long ago when I 
was a 
leedle boy, 
I 
never thought that from you I 
would part. 
My fader used to smoke his pipe und mudder used to knit, 
Side by side dot flower-covered door; 
But der wheel by de mill now has turned de oder way, 
Und dose happy days viii come to me no more. 
CHORUS. 
My dear old German home dot stands upon de Rhine, 
Oh ! vat fond recollections you bring back to me ; 
But ven I'm old und feeble, den bring me dere to die, 
In my leedle German home across de sea. 
I 
remember yen my poor old father took me on his knee, 
lie kissed me und he told me not to cry, 
Dot de place yould soon be sold, for de soldiers dey yould come, 
Und soon after dot my parents dey did die. 
Yah ! vot I 
said vos true, sure de soldiers dey did come, 
Und dey took my dear old home away from me, 
But yen I'm dead and gone, den lay me by dere side, 
In my leedle German home across the sea. 
Side by side, Sze.

The Little Old House on the Rhine. 
ALEX M CCLAFPERTY. 
Air:—" The Old Brown Cot on the Hill." 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
remember the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
- 
By the side of the mill that stands 
by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katharine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine. 
CHORUS. 
It was lonely and cold and in winter ' twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more dear, 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as before, 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask ' neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine, 
It was lonely, & c. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by side, 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye dear old home, fare you well for awhile, 
You've sheltered me many a 
time, 
Oh ! 
I'd love to return to my old fatherland, 
And that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, & c. 
Ali.

THE WATERMILL. 
9 
As recited by Gus W ILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And .he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, walk a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
1•Tever does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not alivays last--
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly tha proverb deep and yast— 
The mill win never grind with the
.. 
water that is past.

DINGELBENDER'S MULE. 
BELLE OF THE BALL. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
keep a 
stable vay up town, und I 
have horses-rare, 
De finest teams in all de vorld I'm sure you viii find dere, 
Among de many who have got deir horses in my place, 
Ts Dingelbender, und he owns a 
mule vot runs a 
race. 
CHORUS. 
Of all de droubles dot I've had since first I 
vent to school, 
I 
don't dink anyding's as bad as Dingelbender's mule. 
Of I 
go in his stall at night he knows me right avay, 
Und for his broder dree miles off he loudly den viii bray; 
Dot vakes up all de horses den, und such an awful noise 
As dey vill make, 'twould drive you mad, but I'm vone of de 
boys. 
SPOKEN.—He is vone of de nicest mules, sound und kind in 
harness—of you can ontly get id on him— dot dere is in de 
country. 
He vos an awful kicker dough; he can kick de barn 
into kindling wood in aboud two seconds. I 
took him to a 
fair 
vonce, de judge vos going to give him de firsd prize; de mule 
made a 
kick--ye found a 
collar button; ve haven't seen de 
judge dough. I 
dink he vos somevere; he'll come down afder 
a 
vile. 
He ain't much of a 
saddle mule, not dot he vould trow 
his rider, but de saddle itches his back, und he has a 
habit of 
going up alongside of a 
house, und rubbing a 
fellow's leg off, 
und dot ain't very pleasant. 
Dot's de reason I 
say— 
Of all de droubles, etc. 
TO a 
ball one night I 
was invited, 
And being so fond of the dance, 
And the prospect I 
feel quite delighted, 
And eagerly jumped at the chance, 
There were ladies dressed so stylish, 
And I 
had on a 
white vest, 
I 
was introduced to a 
lady, 
Whom I 
thought outrivaled the rest. 
CHORUS. 
You've got the belle of the ball, Charlie, 
You've got the belle of the ball, Charlie, 
You've got the belle of the ball, Charlie, 
You've got the belle of the ball. 
The envy of all the fair (lancers, 
She had such a 
fairy like grace, 
But just in the middle of the lancers, 
She turned black in the face, 
She gurgled, she gasped, and she hollered, 
Then took hold of the tails of my coat, 
The top teeth of this elegant lady. 
Had slipped down her beautiful throat. 
You've got the belle, ,Sze. 
She retired and when she recovered, 
In a 
quadrille I 
next took her hand, 
When I 
looked in her eyes I 
discovered 
Which somehow I 
could not understand; . 
Her eyes were as straight as a 
needle, 
When I 
gazed at them fondly before, 
But now one eye looked up at the ceiling, 
And the other looked down on the floor. 
You've got the belle, &c.

What Are You Up To, Jane ? 
The Wedding Day. 
Sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan & Hart's 
Theatre Comique, Broadway, N. Y. 
Mother Jones kept a 
snug little grocery store. 
Mother Jones was obnoxious and plain, 
Mother Jones had a 
daughter both pleasing and fair, 
Whose sweet appelation was Jane. 
While the old one was serving tobacco or gin, 
I'd court pretty Jane on the sly, 
And oh, what sweet, glorious moments we'd have, 
Until the old woman would cry— 
CHORUS. 
What are you up to, Jane ? 
What are you up to, Jane? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
chief again, 
What are you up to, Jane? now what you up to, Jane ? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
chief again. 
One day I 
said, Jane, would you like to be married? 
I 
fancy I 
should, said she, 
So one fine morning we bolted away, 
And got married upon the " Q. T." 
We went down to Rockaway, as Jane preferred 
The seaside for the honeymoon tour, 
Out at night we'd a 
fright as I 
pat out the light, 
A 
knock came at the bedroom door. 
SPOKEN.—And a 
voice through the key-hole said— 
What are you up to, Jane ? &c. 
Mother Jones was too late, for the bridal knot 
Was safely and securely tied, 
For ten years more from my mother-in-law, 
I 
kept at a 
distance wide. 
But she turned up again a 
few days ago, 
When we startled the old 'uns curls, 
With a 
great surprise for her dear old eyes, 
When we mustered the boys and girls. 
SPOKEN.—As 
our " blessings " came into the room two., 
by-two, like a 
healthy boarding-school, the " old ' un 
dropped 
gracefully into the nearest coal scuttle, exclaiming— 
What are you up to Jane? & c.

When I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house, 
In Cherry street below, 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
CHORUS. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a 
wreath for thee, 
All the little children, 
Sang so sweet to me; 
Ladies came in carriages, 
With presents and boquets, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gaily did turn out; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. 
(Chorus.) 
There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Ciselmyer, 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn the old clothes buyer. 
My brothers Pat and Danny, 
Wid the ladies danced the glide, 
flit the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride.

Soon I 
will leave thee, 
My dear German Home, 
In a 
new land afar off, 
A 
stranger I'll roam; 
Away from the friends 
Who have loved me so dears 
But though far away, 
In my heart ever near. 
CHORUS. 
My old German Home, 
On the banks of the Rhine, 
May the sun of prosperity 
On it brightly shine; 
I'm going to leave thee, 
Afar off to roam, 
But I'll never forget 
My old German Home, 
I 
see around me, 
Those friends kind and true, 
Who have loved me since child, 
'Tis hard to leave you; 
Soon I 
will come back 
To this good home once more, 
May prosperity attend you, 
As in days of yore.

As sung by the German Comique, Bonnie Runnels. 
Now, young gentlemen and ladies, 
Workingmen and little babies, 
Something funny I 
will say, 
Something I 
will tell to you; 
Here you see a 
poor y3ung, German, 
And my name it is Fritz-Herman, 
Here I 
have something that-1 
Would like to sell to you; 
The people all do laugh at me 
When I 
go oud on the street, 
As the people all pass by; 
You're always sure to hear me cry: 
CHORUS. 
Beets, potatoes by the dozen, 
For your uncle and your cousin, 
Oysters, clams for the jim jams, 
And other things which was immense, 
Here's a 
box of nice tomatoes; 
A 
receipt for blowing bladders, 
All the lot I'll give to you 
For only seven cents. 
When its cold, I'm always freezing, 
Selling things is very teasing, 
When it rains I'm always wet, 
I 
wish that I 
was out of debt— 
My wite, she does always grumble, 
Tells me to go take a 
tumble, 
If I 
could only sell out now 
I 
would'nt work a 
step. 
The people all do laugh at me 
When I 
go oud' on the street— 
Al the people all pass bye. 
You're always sure to hear me cry 
Beets, potatoes by the dozen. &O.

DORKINS' NIGHT, 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sung with great success by 
W ILLIAM SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Music published by Jorm PERRY, Washington St., opposite lloston 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny! why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage, 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh ' till their sides would ache 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth. 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi! 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi! 
At last be appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
" 
Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night!" 
The people said, sitting 'round me. 
A 
hiss I 
yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all 'round, 
-While his head on his breast he would bang. 
" 
Iie's drunk!" some one said, and I 
thought, so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very how, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said— 
"If I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a sob and a 
moan; 
"I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home! 
Ill tell you the reason —I 
know you won't laugh— 
/ye a 
little one dying at home I"

Po Not Leave Me, Darling. 
After Twelve O'Clock. 
Written and composed by Wm. J. Scanlon. 
You say you're going to leave me, love 
Farewell if we must part; 
To see my darling go from me, 
I 
know ' twill break my heart. 
God knows I 
loved you better than life, 
For what is life to me 
When you are gone and I'm alone, 
A poor outcast I'll be. 
CHORUS. 
'Do not leave me, darling, 
Do not leave me here, 
We've happy been, we'll happy be, 
So do not leave me here. 
(Repeat.) 
When I 
fail to see your face, 
My heart will ache with pain, 
From mine eyes the tears will drop 
Like the heavy falling rain. 
And when you cease to thing of those 
Whose love for you did burn, 
There will come a 
day that you'll repent, 
Then to me you'll returr.. 
(C'hOril8;) 
I'm thinking now of one dark night, 
I 
rambled on the street ; 
The gay saloons were lighted bright, 
The police on their beat. 
Should I 
relate just all I 
saw, 
Perchance your nerves I'd shock, 
For fearful are the sights 
see 
Each night past twelve o'clock. 
CHORUS. 
Come, roam the city round with me, 
Perhaps your nerves ' twill shock, 
For fearful are the sights you see 
Each night past twelve o'clock. 
Now first I 
saw a 
lab'ring men, 
While passing through a 
lane; 
his wages he was giving fast 
For that which crazed his brain. 
His wife at home, though she was starv'd, 
The baby she must rock, 
And yet, that wretched man was drunk, 
lust after twelve o'clock. 
Come, roam &e. 
And then there was another scene, 
I 
think it has been told, 
I 
saw a 
man escape from jail, 
The guard was bought with gold. 
He stole so much he is revered, 
And rich men round him flock; 
And who can tell where this man went 
Just after twelve o'clock ! 
Come, roam, &e, 
Now soon I 
reached the river's side, 
And paused there for a 
rest ; 
'Twas there I 
saw a 
poor young girl, 
Her babe clasped to her breast; 
Her marriage was a 
mockery— 
She jumped out from the dock— 
A 
shriek ! a 
splash I 
th waves rolled on, 
Just after twelve o'clock ! 
Come, roam, &c.

DORKINS WAS TIGHT. 
Written by BENJ. D. 
Comaxs. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
The theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
barefooted slack- wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here; 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with beats, 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah ; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah! yah 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure, 
" 
He's away off his base," says John James Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor; 
A brick—well it wa.s—I saw Dorking start, 
And carom on the dark red for two, 
And it made melfeethirsty to see how he worked, 
But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, •` I'm the king !" when a 
woman jumped up, 
Cried, " York lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." 
That knocked Dorkins cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made yon all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer, 
When me and Jim Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to- night and say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
hamlet alone; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you will treat— 
' 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead—drunk at home.

No doubt you will wcnder why I 
dress so gay, 
Always in fashion this swell of the day. 
My clothes they are cut in the latest of style, 
And the darling young ladies on me fondly smile. 
My way is so winning, full of exquisite grace, 
Why they really do laugh when we meet face to face. 
The gents they all look with derision at me, 
Because I 
am always dressed up to a 
T.

While pivoting, waltzing in the grand dance so gay, 
At sweet Saratoga or Far Rockaway. 
Oh! the darling young ladies say I 
am a

Why none's half so charming as Clarence Lavere. 
Dn a 
nice afternoon if the weather is fair, 
To. my barber's I 
go to curl up my hair, 
Brush off my clothes fix myself all serene, 
For I 
always endeavor to look bright and clean.

good hand at billiards and like my good wine, 
A card player, well I'm considered quite tine. 
I 
never borrow trouble, always feel well, 
And a 
good joke I'm always quite ready to tell. 
While pivoting, etc. 
At a 
quarter of two I 
must be on Broadway, 
To meet a 
young lady I 
saw the other day 
Her pa he is rich—so at least I've been told— 
And all I 
desire is to grab at his gold. 
Then to the sea- beach in summer I'll go, 
Cut such a 
dash, ah! what a 
show. 
There in the ball- room to promenade and dance, 
With any young lady I 
meet there by chance.

I've lain thee in yon silent tomb ; 
Yet mem'ry recalls thy sweet presence, 
To cheer me where'er I

The heart-broken friends that stood by, 
Death came and it severed that tie, love, 
Thy spirit did mount upon high.

Thou'st gone far away from me darling, 
I've lain thee in you silent tomb; 
Yet mem'ry recalls thy sweet presence, 
To cheer me where'er I

I've thought of our home in the West love, 
Of friends and kindred so dear; 
Alas! death has entered that home, love, 
And robbed it of all that can cheer. 
I 
think of thee ever, my loved one, 
How hard it was from thee to part 
And while I 
have life and have hope, love, 
I'll cherish thee to my heart.

I'll come to thee soon, my dear 4arling, 
And never again from thee part; 
The sun then will shine with that brightness, 
And pleasure return to my heart. 
Then life shall be sweet as before, love, 
And gladness re-echo with joy; 
To meet thee above in that realm love, 
Where death ne'er again can destroy.

Waiting like my love waits, Jamie,

Oh my Jamie, Oh my Jamie, 
Time goes quickly by;

THE old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And these hands refuse to do the daily toil; 
I 
never dream'd ' twould come to this, or that I'd be in need, 
After years of service in Carlina soil. 
My limbs are bending 'neath their weight, my hair is white as 
snow, 
And I 
cannot see the gentle slimmer sky ; 
My feet grow weary day by day, my step is weak and slow, 
And I'm gwine to leave my comrades by and by. 
CHORUS. 
The old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The good old days when I 
was young have flitted like a 
dream, 
And I 
hardly knew that I 
was growing old; 
I 
never stopped to think how these poor 
arms of mine 
would seem, 
If the poor old man was left out in the cold. 
But now I 
know the feeling well, it almost breaks my heart 
For to think that I 
must die away from home. 
Oh, if I 
could be young again, to-morrow I 
would start, 
And to old Carlina's shores I'd quickly roam. 
The old man ain't himself, etc. 
I 
long to see the cotton fields, the tall Palmetto trees, 
And to hear the happy darkies shout and sing; 
I 
never shall forget the good, the old plantation glees, 
Or the way we used to make the banjo ring; 
But all is nearly over now, the trumpet soon will sound. 
Then I'll have to cross the river over there; 
And when I 
set my aching feet upon the sacred ground, 
I 
shall know no mo' about this worldly care. 
;Lhe old man ain't himself, etc.

Little sweetlips, keep your kisses, 
Each and ev'ry one for me, 
Keep them all for one who misses 
Them so far away from thee. 
Mine the only right to gather 
All their sweetness full and free, 
So, while parted, I 
would rather 
Have you keep each kiss for me

Little Fweetlips, keep your kisses, 
Keep them ev'ry one for me, 
Till my heart no longer misses 
All their sweetness full and free. 
Little sweetlips, keep your kisses,

Let none steal away the blisses 
That you know to me belong. 
Do not sigh because I 
wander 
Just a 
little while from thee, 
Absence but will make me fonder 
Of the kisses kept for me. 
Little sxveetlips, &c. 
Little sweetlips, keep your kisses, 
And to me be always true,

Then how sweet to me the learning 
Ev'ry kiss is kept for me.

Sung tith great success by Miss CARRIE DUNCAN, t

WHEN eighteen years old, and just growing bold 
Of me cupid made quite a 
happy young bride 
By shooting his dart through, and sending my heart to 
A gentleman stranger, whom I 
had espied 
Reclining at leisure, enjoying his pleasure 
Beneath the light rose- bush full burdened with bloona 
io kindly he pressed me, and gently addressed me 
Remarking, look here, miss, there's plenty of room. 
CHORUS. 
Under the rose- bush, under the rose- bush, 
Picking the clover and picking the way, 
Under the rose- bush, under the rose- bush, 
He asked me to kiss him, I 
did not say nay. 
Of modesty heedless, in fact it was needless, 
We sat by the side of that May- bedecked hedge, 
heard his confession of love and depression, 
lie asked for a 
kiss in exchange for the pledge, 
I 
never denied it, but then and there tried it, 
Beneath that bright-rose bush full burdened with bloom:. 
So like the May flowers, which served as a 
bower, 
It seemed quite as sweet as the lovely perfume. 
Under the rose-bush, & c. 
At sun's early dawning, I 
went there each morning 
To meet my romantic and strangely met swain, 
All mystery was banished, all secrecy vanished 
Dear Ned vowed he'd love me again and again. 
We do not like walking, we much prefer talking 
Beneath that bright rose- bush, full burdened with bloou, 
So when to the altar I

In Scotland, France and Germany, 
Music you will hear, 
The Italian loves to play the harp, 
He plays so soft and clear. 
Sweet music always charms my ear, 
Wherever it may be, 
I 
love to hear Tom Moore's sweet songs, 
They have such harmony. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love music, I 
love singing, 
I 
love dancing—it's entrancing, 
I 
love babies, I 
love ladies, 
Yes, they're all the world to me. 
The Irish songs are soft and sweet, 
They harmonize so well, 
The Meeting of the Waters, 
Or the Emigrant's FareweL. 
There's Bobby Burns, the great Scotch poet, 
Whose memory shall reign 
In Scotland where he lived and died, 
And honored was his name. 
(Chorus.) 
In speaking of our poets great, 
There's one now whom I'll name, 
His praise is sung both far and near, 
He's well known for his fame. 
'Tis of William Cullen Bryant I 
speak, 
Who Americans will adore, 
His works are read throughout this world, 
From this to foreign shore. 
(Chorus.) 
sung with great success by Messrs. SHERIDAN & M AGIC. 
WE merrily sing from morn till night, 
And misery we defy, 
And I've a 
wife who is my life 
And just as happy as I; 
She is the comfort of my life, 
My darling and my pride, 
For sixty years together, my friends, 
We've traveled side by side. 
CHORUS. 
'Round goes the world, 
Trouble we defy, 
Jogging along together, my friends, 
My dear old wife iind 1. 
In winter, when the snow is down, 
She meets me at the door, 
With a 
come in lad and warm yourself, 
You must be cold I'm sure; 
She brings my slippers warm and bright, 
And lays them by my side, 
I 
never could find her equal, 
'rho' I 
travel this world so wide, 
'Round goes the world, ie 
And thus we pass the time away, 
Content to stay at home, 
happy as the day is long, 
Never inclined to roam; 
There's many talk of single bliss, 
And for their freedom sigh, 
But that will never be the case, 
With my old wife and I.

Ant.—" My Vife is so Awfully Thin," 
vonce did love a 
woman, dot used to be so stout', 
Und people dey vould laugh at her venever she'd valk oud ; 
But sdill 
loved her druly, I 
knew it vos no sin, 
dought dot in de future she you'd gradually grow thin. 
CHORUS. 
She vas so stoud yen she'd yalk oud, 
People You'd dink dot she vos a 
balloon 
To take demlup—just like a " scup," 
Und make a 
small call on de man in de moon. 
rine tooked just like an elephant, she had such a 
bigiear, 
But she could valk as lightly as any person here ; 
To tell you all aboud her, I 
now intend to try, 
Und vile I 
am a-speaking, I 
hope you viii not cry. 
SPOKEN.—I'll never forget ven I 
firsd got acquainted mit 
her, she vos travelling mit a 
circus, she vos de fat voinan, she 
veighed eight hundred pounds; I 
used to call her " Birdie!" 
her right name vos " Ostrich." I 
took her oud sleigh- riding 
vonce, she got in, und dere vas just room for me to " cut on 
behind." 
I 
looked like an icicle on a

Ye drove out on 
de road, und stopped in front of a

vile she stayed dere. 
I

she got in de yater, de tide vent up dree toot, she asked me to 
float her; I 
tried to, but came near drowning; I 
told her I

But she could dance like a fairy—dot is a 
fairy 
her size; I 
used, in waltzing, to put my arm around her waist 
as far as I 
could, und reach mit a 
boat- hook de rest of de dis-
tance; und she vos an awful eater, she could eat a 
water- melon 
just as easy as I

I 
took de size of her linger 
vonce to have an engagement ting made; I 
vent down to de

said, " Make me a

He said, " Bring de keg down here, und let me fit it

MY POOR HEART IS SAD WITH ITS 
DREAMING. 
As eung by the 13th Ward Glee Club. 
, 
MY poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away. 
, 
They say that young loves like the flowers, 
That needs tender care in its urn, 
" 
But minelt was snatched from the bower, 
And I 
never gained one in return. 
CHORUS. 
My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has pa.gsed all away. 
My sad heart recalls all the pleasure, 
Of thoughts that are all, all for thee, 
When dreaming of you, of its treasure, 
And you seemed to love none but me. 
Tho' we meet not as friends, yet I'll never, 
One kind word to thee give, 
For your cherished memory ever, 
Shall be my soulj oy while I 
live. 
My poor heart, &e. 
I 
Love Him all the Same. 
Sung by EhIMA ROGERS, in the sketch written for her by NED STRAIGHT, 
entitled: " Jealousy ; or, Two can Play at that Game." 
Where are all the words endearing 
That my darling used to say ? 
Where the tones that were so cheering ? 
Oh bring them back to me, I 
pray. 
They say that he is false to me, 
Has brought upon me deepest shame; 
Yet bring him back where'er he be, 
For, oh, I 
love him all the same. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' the ocean rolls between us, 
Tho' upon his name's a 
stain, 
Tho' he languish in a 
prison, 
Still I 
love him all the same. 
When we parted in the arbor, 
Sweet to me the kiss he gave, 
As his ship sail'd from the harbor 
My heart was lonely as the grave. 
Three long and weary years have fled, 
One letter only from him came, 
"I'm coming back to you," he said, 
And oh, I 
love him all the same. 
Tho' the ocean rolls, &C.

Extract from " 
DAN COLLYER'S GREAT ACT. 
One of the first prisoners under examination was a 
youth, 
who had been arrested at the instance of a 
respectable negro 
man of family, for having " rocked" his house and severely 
injured his daughter with a 
stone thrown through the window. 
At the examination Old Pompey was put upon the stand, and 
proved the charge in such undeniable terms that it would 
have gone hard with the prisoner had it not been for the -fol-
lowing cross-examination: 
LAWYER— You say one ton a 
came into the room where 
you were sitting with your family, and struck your daughter? 
PONIP—Ves, boss. 
LAWYER—Where did it strike her? 
POMP (
silent fzr awhile)---I 
don't like to tell, boss. 
LAWYER—But you must tell. 
I 
eernand again, Where did 
it strike her ? 
POMP—Dat all foolishness, boss. 
I 
tell you it hit her. I 
don't like to tell where 'fore dese people in court. 
LAWYER—But you must answer. 
Where did it hit her ? 
POMP (slowly)—On the buzzum, boss. 
LAWYER—Well, how severely did it injure her? 
POMP—Oh, quit ciis foolishness. .1 
ain't gwine to tell. 
LAwvEk—Again I 
must insist upon my question being 
answered. 
Dict it injure her? 
POMP (
in despair)--No, sah I 
It did not injure her, but it 
broke tnree.fingers of a 
gentleman that was 
ayin' ' tention 
to her. 
COMMON kerosene, Collyer says, is a 
sovereign cure for 
rheumatism. 
If the rheumatism is in your leg, all you have 
to do is to rub on the kerosene, and then light it with a 
match.

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know, 
To learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
CHORUS. 
Swint out says Pete, arrah kick your feet, 
Go over-hand says brother Jim, 
The gang, did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Oh " chaw roast- beet, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
I 
made back- dives and somersaults, 
Along with Shorty Tim ; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jams, 
ne'er forget, as long as 1 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim.

As your my own I'd carry you away. 
Buds and blossoms now are all aglow, 
Down the tide ripples glide, singing as they go. 
Naught with you, & c. 
Fair the roses, pale the daffodil, 
Droops the willow bending by the rill, 
Opening flowers blushing by the lea, 
Sweet sunlight, eyes are bright, sparkling love from me.

Will I 
always be your darling, 
As we journey down life's sea ? 
Will the wife be just as precious 
As the sweetheart seems to be? 
There may be rough waves to weather, 
Over which our bark may sail, 
Do you think our hearts together 
Will ride smoothly through the gale? 
CHORUS. 
Will I 
always be your darling? 
Tell me honest, tell me true, 
If forever and forever 
I 
will be as dear to you ? 
When the silver hair shall mingle 
With the curly locks of gold, 
And my face, careworn and wrinkled, 
Tells you I 
am getting old ; 
Will I 
be the same dear darling, 
When shall come life's harvest clays ? 
Will the love be then as ardent, 
And the lips as fondly praise ?

Where the hawthorn blossoms sweetly blow, 
I 
meet Alice Aleen. 
So flaxen were her ringlets, 
Her eyes of bonny blue, 
So laughing and bewitching, 
Like a 
dart they pierced me through and through, 
CHORUS. 
When rosy May comes in with flowers, (Sym). 
To deck her gay green spreading bowers; (Sym.) 
It's then I 
love to roam with her, my little bright sunbeam, 
She is m'y life, my guiding star, my sweet Alice Aleen. 
In a 
shady grove far down the lane, 
In love's sweet peaceful bower, 
Beside a 
falling crystal stream, 
Oh what a 
blissful hour. 
'Twas there she whispered, " I 
am thine," 
In tones so lovingly; 
Then murmered low, " When we are wed, 
How happy, dearest, we will be." 
When rosy May, Sze. 
Written and sung by JOHN McVEIGH. Dedicated to my friend Hamtit 
AlcAvoY. 
Of a 
queer young man I'm going to ten, 
And every one of you know him well; 
lie's rather a 
sort of a 
dizzy swell, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew every actor, both east and west, 
The highest, the lowest, the least, the best ; 
In fact he would never give you a 
rest, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew Frank Girard, Charles White and Pat Rooney; 
When he spoke of Add Ryman he nearly went " looney." 
He knew both the Tonys, Pastor and Hart, 
And said he gave Harrigan his very first start. 
He knew John Wild, Johnny Shay and Bill Gray; 
And he knew Bill Thompson, wrote many a 
play. 
He knew Billy Barry as well as his mother, 
And Frank Bennett to him was as dear as a 
brother; 
Watson and Ellis he knew thoroughly well, 
And he put in the business John and Henry Kernel]. 
He knew the Deveres, both Samuel and Billy, 
And he raised Cool Burgess, who knocked the " guys " silly, 
Gus Williams, he said, is a 
great friend of mine, 
" 
He eats nothing but birds, and drinks nothing but wine." 
Lew Simmonds and Richmond are two of his pards, 
And Sanford and Wilson enjoy his regards. 
'r 
Continued. 
Billy Emerson and Newcomb are two of his friends, 
And to Schoolcraft and Coes his best wishes extends; 
He knows Hughey Dougherty, and of him spoke well, 
And he lived in the same house with Senator Bell. 
Delehanty and Hengler, Harry Thompson and McKee 
Were many times out with him on a 
good " spree." 
He gave Charley Diamond his first lesson in music, 
And writes all the songs for Bill Morton and Gulick. 
He knows Backus and Wambold, and fat Billy Birch, 
They introduced him to Thatcher one day in a 
church. 
Billy Carter, Jaques, Kruger and himself are quite thick, 
He knows all the Nortons, including one they call Nick; 
Milt Barlow, George Wilson, and West and Primrose, 
Wouldn's lose his good will for a 
million of shows. 
He knows Larry Tooley, Joe Lang, and Ned West, 
And Cummings, and Harrington, his friendship attest. 
He knew Quilter and Goldrich, and old Walter Bray, 
In fact, he knows every actor in the country to- day. 
He knows people that were dead for ninety-nine years, 
And whenever he spoke of them he always shed tears. 
A Mick who was listening to him a 
couple of hours, 
Said: "Do you know a 
young man by the name of Ed Powers?" 
He said he did not—and could you suppose 
That the terrier thumped him square on the nose, 
Saying; " 1.re're a 
liar," as his ear he did eat, 
And made a 
kick at his neck as he ran in the street ; 
And now he knows no actor.

And she told me on the dance she was sound.

int; Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people-a 
want of means of 
• expressing one's sentiments in such 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
riflemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which misfit have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
