And she had such a

She was just about the girl that's all the rage; 
Sweet sixteen was just her age

She saw that I 
was looking at her, 
When a 
sweet little smile, like a 
beam. 
Just played round her face and, with such ease 
and grace, 
Why, like a 
little Angel she did seem. 
But I 
kept getting like any one in fear. • 
For, my heart felt like a

But as the ice was broken, my hat, of course, I 
raised, 
As the stage, that she required, soon came by; 
When she said in tones so sweet: Perhaps some 
time we'll meet 
As up the steps her little form did fly. 
But I 
never since have seen her: so, I 
wander in 
despair; 
For, it seems that since she left me 'twas an age; 
But I 
never shall forget that little girl I

On the Beach at' Long-Branch. 
On the Beach at Long-Branch, one fine Summer's 
day, 
I 
had a 
novel reading to pass the time away, 
And so interested was 1 
in the plot— 
A Gent stood there beside me—still I 
saw him 
not— 
Till, at last, by chance, my eyelids I 
did raise— 
I 
found him on me looking with enraptured gaze— 
Bright blue eyes so sparkling, handsome Grecian 
nose, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness—quite the pink of beaus. 
CHOIMS. 
Twas on the beach, at Long-Branch, one fine Sum-
mer day, 
I 
met this handsome man who stole my heart away; 
Now I 
feel so happy as blissful moments glide, 
The day is quickly coming when I 
shall be his 
bride ! 
As like one awaking from some happy dream, 
We glances did exchange--his eyes with love did 
beam— 
Sweet Nineteen.

Ere much time was over, we began to chat— 
And hours passed away—still he beside me sat— 
And with ways so winning he did love impart— 
My spirits rose as high as the early morning lark. 
He told me that he loved me, vowed that all his 
life 
Would be to him worthless, unless I'd be his wife. 
'Twas on the beach, &c. 
He said that if I'd marry, all troubles we would 
drown, 
And live in blissful ignorance of all the cares of 
Town, 
With soft persuasive power he told me of his love, 
Vowing to EQ 
trao, by all the Powers above ! 
He asked me if I'd marry, pressed me then to say— 
Till, to his wishes yielding, I named the happy 
day. 
He said his cup of bliss was filled quite to the brim, 
He'd live alone for me, and I 
alone for him!

give me just one penny, I

Standing where the bleak winds whistled 
Rumd her small and fragile form, 
Arms within torn garments nestled, 
Standing there at night and morn; 
Hundreds passing by unheeding, 
'Opt to jostle her aside. 
There, with bare feet cold and bleeding, 
She, in tones of anguish, cried:

For, I've not got any Pa "—

And for them to us unknown, 
We'll not forget out little " bare-foots," 
They are heathens nearer home. 
Hailing thus each passing stranger, 
As they hurriedly went by, 
Some would turn and gaze upon her, 
Pity beaming from their eye; 
Others cast a 
frown upon her, 
Heeding not the plaintive cry: 
I 
must have some bread for Mother, 
Or with hunger she will die ;

Ere the veil my vision darkens, 
And I

Soon you'll miss me from your berth,

For my limbs are getting cold, 
And thy presence seemeth dearer 
When thy arms around me fold.

Yet my hope in God is strong; 
I

Mary of the Wild Moor. 
It was on one cold winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When Mary came wandering home with her babe, 
Till she came to her father's own door. 
Oh! father, dear father! she cried. 
Came down and open the door. 
Or the child in my arms will perish and die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor! 
Oh! why did I 
leave this dear spot, 
Where once I 
was happy and free ? 
But now doomed to roam without friends or home, 
And no one to take pity on me! 
The old man was deaf to her cries; 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear; 
But the watch-dog did howl, and the village bell 
toll'd, 
And. the wind blew across the wild moor. 
But how must the old man have felt, 
When he came to the door in the morn! 
Poor Mary was dead, but the child was alive, 
Closely pressed in its dead mother's arms. 
Mlf frantic he tore his gray hair, 
And tears down his cheeks they did pour, 
Saying: this cold winter's night, she perished and 
died, 
By the wind that blew across the wild moor! 
The old man in grief pined away, 
And the child to its mother went soon; 
And no one, they say, has lived there to this day, 
And the cottage to ruin has gone. 
The villagers point out the spot. 
Where the willow droops over the door, 
Saving: there Mary died, once a

Oh! once, there lived, in Dowling-Green, 
As nice a

Her hair was red, her eyes were blue; 
Her dreadful end I'll tell to you. 
Now: once, she had a

And at them all turned up her nose; 
But, in time, growing tired of single life, 
She, at last, became a 
Dustman's wife.

And a

Oh jealousy brings both bother and strife, 
As it did to Maria, the Dustman's wife! 
Of a 
morning, the dustman went out for the 
dust, 
A crying out: Dust! as if he would bust, 
And left- his red-haired wife at home, 
With strict injunctions not to roam. 
But, of course, at times, she out would pop, 
To get same bread at the baker's shop: 
And the baker, a 
man in single life, 
He threw sheep's eyes at the Dustman's wife.

Well, the dustman stayed to see no more, 
But went to a

He stood there, drinking until night, 
And then went rolling home wards tight; 
And when Maria opened the door, 
The dustman felled her to the floor— 
Then stabbed her, twice, with the carving knife, 
And that put an end to the Dustman's wife. 
With a 
ranky twanky, & c. 
Now, when he found she was no more, 
With grief he, like a 
child, did roar— 
He sobbed and cried, but cried in vain— 
For, he could not bring her back again: 
He ran up-stairs, then, in a

And threw himself out of the third floor back, 
And the reason this poor chap lost his life— 
Was all on account of the Dustman's wife.

The gentle winds did sigh,

'Twas a

Two kings had fought, and the fight was done; 
When amidst the shout of victory swelling, 
A soldier fell on the field he had won. 
He thought of kings and toyal quarrels, 
And thought of glory without a 
smile— 
For what had he to do with laurels, 
He was only one of the rank and file, 
But drawing his little cruiskeen 
He drank to his pretty colleen, 
" 
Oh, darling," said he, " if I 
die, 
You won't be widow, for why ? 
Sure you would never have me, vourneen." 
Then a 
raven tress from his bosom hiking, 
That now was stained with his life stream shed, 
A fervent prayer on that ringlet making, 
His blessings sought on the loved (MC 'S head. 
And visions fair of his native mountains 
Arose, enchanting his fading sight ; 
Her emerald valleys and crystal fountains 
Were never shining more clear and bright, 
But grasping his little cruiskeen, 
He pledged that dear island so green— 
" 
Though far from the valleys I 
die, 
Dearest isle of my heart, thou art nigh, 
As the' absent I 
had never been." 
A tear now fell, for as life was sinking, 
The pride that guarded his manly eye 
Had weaker grown, and such tender thinking 
Brought Heaven, and home and his true love nigh.

Music by IL Russell. 
When at the social board you sit, 
And pass around the wine, 
Remember, though abuse is vile, 
That use may be divine; 
That heaven in kindness gave the grape, 
To cheer both great and small; 
That little fools will drink too much, 
But great ones not at all. 
And when in youth, to fleeting hours, 
You roam the world alone, 
And have not sought some loving heart. 
That you may call your own, 
Remember woman's priceless worth, 
And think when pleasures pall, 
That little fools will love too much, 
But great ones not at all. 
And if a 
friend deceived you once, 
Absolve poor humankind. 
Nor rail against your fellow man, 
With malice in your mind; 
But in your daily intercourse, 
Remember, lest you fall, 
That little fools confide too much, 
But great ones not at all. 
In weal or woe be trustful still, 
And in the deepest care, 
Be bold and resolute, and shun 
The coward foe, despair. 
Let work and hope go hand in hand, 
And know, whate'er befall, 
That little fools will hope too much, 
But great ones not at all.

Only true hearts comfort bring.

Scarce deserves the name of man.

Which was meant mankind to bless, 
Bids us help a 
fellow creature, 
When we find him in distress.

Of charming young creatures with innocent fea-

My wits have &Rifted, I'm nigh broken-hearted,

I 
sat by that fairy with steps light and airy, 
My first trip to Islip by excursion train, 
She looked so bewitching I 
felt quite an itching 
To kiss the sweat angel again and again. 
Her eyes sparkled brightly she smiled at me slight-
ly, 
Of course then I 
thought I 
was on the right scent; 
I 
pressed her hand slyly and though she looked 
shyly, 
I 
found that she understood well what I 
meant. 
I 
in ' vod then close to her, and fondly did woo her, 
Put my arms around her neck and she did not com-
plain, 
I 
thought myself lucky to win such a 
ducky, 
And kissed the sweet angel again and again. 
Slid I, dearest charmer, I 
am a 
young farmer, 
To see the fine sights up to New York I've been, 
If you want a 
sweetheart I 
will do my best part 
To make you quite happy and grand as a 
queen: 
She looked quite delighted and I 
was excited 
To think what a 
beauty I 
shortly might win, 
And there with emotion and fondest devotion 
I 
kissed the sweet angel again and again. 
We soon reached the station in snug conversation, 
And then made our way to the lovely seaside.

I'll tell you concerning my intended bride. 
I'd not the least notion she'd dash in the ocean, 
And flounder about as she did in the main; 
I 
stood quite confounded as over she bounded, 
Bobbing her head down and then up again. 
I 
felt horror-stricken to think I'd been smitten 
By some fairy water nymph out on a 
spree; 
I 
rushed home astounded, in fact quite dumbfounded, 
Wondering what next I 
was likely to see, 
Strange things happen daily, astonishing really, 
Only fancy, perched close by my side in a 
train, 
The Ghost ruralising that vision surprising, 
They stab every night and they shoot at in vain. 
The world's all deception with scarce an exception, 
Th?re's nothing substantial on earth I 
con find, 
humbug and vexation's the plague of the nation, 
It drives half the people slap out of their mind. 
And love's a 
vain bubble, it all ends in trouble, 
It's knocked me quite silly, I'm touched on the 
brain, 
But bless the sweet creatures with innocent features, 
I 
think I 
shall try my luck over again.

The White Hat. 
Air:--" Uncle Sam." 
Last Monday morning early, 
I 
well remember that, 
The tailor he'd brought home my clothes 
I'd a 
splendid new white hat; 
And having got a 
holiday, 
I 
resolved to show. 
So to Oxley Island by an early boat, 
I 
determined for to go. 
CHORUS.

had made up my mind 
A 
spree to have, and that 
The reason was for purchasing 
This nobby new white hat. 
At ten A. M. at Pier No. 4, 
I 
jumped into the boat, 
A sensation I 
found I'd made, 
When we were all afloat. 
I 
glanced around the crowded deck, 
My heart went pit-a-pat, 
When I 
saw a 
lovely, scrumptious girl, 
Admiring my white hat.

had made, &e. 
The gaze of all of those on board 
I 
found was fixed on me, 
When this damsel at me winked her eye, 
To my great ecstasy. 
I 
very soon made up to her, 
And blessed my fortune that 
I 
had that morning mounted 
Such a 
nobby new white hat.

She was getting rather ill,

Three Roguish Chaps. 
In good old colony times, 
When our Fathers were under the king, 
Three roguish chaps, fell into mishaps, 
Because they could not sing. 
Because they could not sing. 
Because they could not sing. 
Three roguish chaps fell into mishaps, 
Because they could not sing. 
The first he was a 
Miller, 
And the second he was a 
Weaver, 
And the third he was a 
little Tailor, 
Three roguish chaps together, 
Three roguish, &c. 
Now, the Miller he stole corn, 
And the Weaver he stole yarn, 
And the little Tailor stole broadcloth for 
To keep these three rogues warm, 
To keep, &c. 
The Miller got drown'd in his dam, 
The weaver got hung in his yarn, 
And the sheriff clappd his paw on the little 
Tailor, 
With the broadcloth under his arm, 
With the broadcloth, &c. 
Now if these three roguish chaps, 
Who flourished under the king, 
Had lived to see as much as me, 
They'd surely have learned to sing. 
They'd surely, &e. 
Then the Miller could sing to his love. 
And the Weaver comfort his wife, 
And the little Tailor make ballads for, 
To keep these three rogues right,

Katy McFerran. 
Words and Music by W. S. Hays. 
The modest May morn looked. down upon Erin, 
The land of sweet song, and the gem on the sea, 
As I 
sat on the stile with sweet Katy Mcferran, 
Who wept like a 
child while she listened, to me. 
She looked in my face with her eyes full of sorrow, 
I 
knew by her glance that her heart was in lain ; 
"Katy, darling, said I, I 
must leave you to morrow, 
Perhaps we may ne or see each other again." 
CHORUS. 
And how like an angel sweet Katy resembled 
Some beautiful creature just come Irma the skies; 
And her soft little hand in my own layand trembic 
As she pleaded, don't leave me, with , tarsiii licr 
eyes. 
Come speak to me, darling, and tell me you love me; 
She raised her blue eyes with a 
tear in each one, 
And sighed, while you live, and the heaven's aLove 
me, 
I'll love and. I'll bless you wherever you've gone. 
I 
kissed her at parting, and left her in sorrow, 
And came to this country— the land of the free; 
But I'm going back home to old. Erin to-morrow, 
I 
know that my Katy's still waiting for me. 
And how like, &c. 
I'll go to a 
neat little cottage in Erin. 
I've longed, since I 
left it, so often to see; 
And. I'll rap on the door for sweet Katy Mcrerran 
And ask her to come to this country with me, 
Where cruel oppression can ne'er overtake her, 
And the flag of God's country is ever unfurled, 
I've a 
neat little home for her, faith, and I'll make 
her 
The wife of the happiest man in the world.

Mary, Oh I 
Como Back To Me. 
Words and Music by Will. S. Hays. 
Stars of the evening shining so bright, 
Smile in thy beauty this soft summer night 
See how the moon gaily floats thro' the skies, 
Wink at her passing those heavenly eyes; 
Gentle winds sighing thro' meadow and vale, 
Bearing to flowers some marvelous tale. 
Take me a 
messago far over the sea, 
Mary, dear Mary, 0! come back to me. 
CHORUS. 
Lonely, so lonely! happy I'll be, 
If Mary, dear Mary, will come back to me 
Do you remember when we did part, 
How your eyes when weeping troubled my 
heart ? 
How your lip 4 
trembled when saying " good-bye?" 
A 
te tr for a 
tear and a 
sigh for a 
sigh. 
Where are you roving, my loved one, to-night? 
Smile on the moon in her wandering flight, 
So that your image I 
once more may see, 
And beg you, dear Mary, to come back to me. 
Lonely, so lonely! 
Como to the cottage—land of your birth, 
Come to the horn) that is dearest on earth; 
Come to the heart that is loving you still, 
I'll kiss you a 
welcome, come when you will: 
Eyes that were weeping when last we did part, 
Fondly will smile thro' the doors of my heart; 
Write me a 
letter from over the sea, 
Tell me, dear Mary, you'll hasten to me.
