(Sounds of water sloshing, boats moving through wild rice) 
JO: I don't hear anything, I don't see anything. I'm gonna head 
to the left point. Whoo ! 
FA: I think I heard one. 
JO: Maybe we can come back up to that. We can push all 
that. 
FA: Wo—oo! 
JO: Blackbirds. Yeah, haven't even seen many of that. 
JO: 
Is this boat tipsier than yours? 
FA: Aw, yeah, but yours pushes better than mine. 
JO: Does it? 
FA: Yeah, that's the reason...it pushes better; 
it's 
narrower...oh, mark, on the right, there's one running (gunshot). 
JO: Yeah, he's maybe cripple. 
FA: Yeah, I think you got him pretty good. 
I hear some bird... 
JO: Yeah, I heard one too. You got it? Bird should be right on 
the edge of the water. 
FA: Yeah, over there, to the right a little bit. Maybe about 
where the bow of the boat i 
s 
. 
JO: Yeah, I had, I had him right here, but he might have been 
further over to the 
left. 
GP: Over this way more. 
JO: Huh? 
GP: Over toward us more. 
JO: Oh, huh uh, I don't think so. He's either from here to there. 
Yeah, why don't you push on up a little bit. He might be a little 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 1 
ahead. Might be right under the boat too. It looked to me like he 
was hit right in the rear end. I didn't have time enough to shoot 
him a second time. I had him right there. That's where I had him 
marked. Here's a feather, right there. There's a feather right 
here. He might be under the boat. There's more feathers there. 
FA: Yeah, he could be under there. 
JO: Uh huh. 
FA: Well, this 
is about the right spot though. 
JO: Yep. There's more feathers here 
FA: 
I'm gonna push ahead a little bit more. Ha! 
JO: See him? 
FA: How about that? He was right down by the boat. 
JO: Yeah. (some joking) 
FA: That's an old super guide's trick. He says you need a little 
rest. And after you get rested up you push on. And then you say, 
oh, there 
it 
is! You got him? 
JO: yeah, I got him. 
FA: Ten minutes. 
JO: Oh, shoot! I lost one of your shells. Yeah I found him. 
GP: Well, I claim credit for pushing up the first bird of the 
day . 
JO: You do? 
GP: Yeah, you know right over there where you put the boat? 
I was walking in there right after you guys left, he got up. 
(laughter) So, what do you have, two? 
JO: Two, yeah. 
FA: We're two for two. 
GP: You're gonna need three more for dinner. 
JO: Yeah, right. We'll kill a few more before it's over. So, you 
only jump one, over there? 
GP: I didn't go very far, believe me, I got stuck 
in there in no 
time. 
JO: I know, I know. It's real heavy. We're gonna... 
FA: I was telling Jim, that this boat pushes better in the heavier 
stuff than that one will. 
GP: 
Is that right? 
FA: 
It's a little bit better, I think. It'll also go through 
there alright. I think this one will be a little bit better. 
GP: Well, why don't I take that one, and you guys try this one 
for awhile? 
FA & JO: Oh, no! I like this boat! (laughter) 
JO: Let's stay right down on this edge. We can go all 
the way 
around. And I think this 
is 
as productive of a place. I heard 
another bird right here when we were... 
FA: The birds are here. 
JO: We got, about another hour. We'll be getting a little better 
water as we go. These are all 
nice little spots along the edge of 
this creek early in the season. 
FA: Wo — 
oo! 
JO: 
(Whistle and clicking) Come on birds! That's nice here. 
FA: 
Isn't it? Woo! 
JO: OK. Jump one between here and that point. Come on bird. Come 
on. 
(splashing) 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 2 
FA: What we shoulda done 
is went back and got that one we heard. 
JO: Probably. That's alright. We'll find more up here. The 
further around we get the better off we are. Woo! Nothing. 
FA: We shoulda helped them guys. They'd be better off 
if they'd 
stayed ... 
JO: Yeah. How're you doing? 
GP: Well, I've gone about 50 feet! 
FA: Woo! 
JO: Shoulda jumped a bird there. Shoulda jumped a bird there. OK, 
you wanna switch again? 
FA: 
I'm alright. 
JO: See all this has opened up. All 
of this used to 
be rice. Started out as a little bitty pond 
in the middle, and 
now it's gotten bigger and bigger. 
FA: You notice any places that were open that are turning into 
wild rice on the river or not? 
JO: No. Going the wrong way. I'll 
tell you what. We may as well 
just stay — I don't think you'd jump anything out here 
in these 
lily pads. Let's go back over to that edge. Uh oh! 
(Carl fell 
into the water) 
FA: You alright? 
JO: How's your equipment? 
GP: Got good and wet! 
PJ: How many fish did you get? 
FA: We seem to be doing the wrong thing! 
PJ: So what do you think about pushing this skiff, compared to 
yours? 
FA: Ah, well, I think it's pushing a little better. I don't know. 
We haven't tried it. This 
is similar to the bottom of some of the 
ones I have at home. Because it's double ended. I push them up 
easier than the ones I have here. Although, we have to try 
it 
really. 
PJ: 
Is this type of marsh similar to the marsh in New Jersey that 
you were... 
FA: Yeah. It's pretty similar really. Yeah. You mentioned cane 
_ and he mentioned they have the wild daisies, what do we call 
them? The yellow flowers. 
JO: Yeah, the buttercup. The buttercup is what they call em down 
here. Butterweed or buttercup. 
FA: Yellow daisies. And of course sometimes, you got some 
good...usually you need a good tide to get in there. But 
basically, 
it's fairly similar. 
JO: 
It can't be too much different or the birds wouldn't be 
there, and 
in here. 
FA: I think some of the marshes we have up here, are just 
strictly wild rice. Would be too much, not a lot of open water. 
It's just variable. 
GP: Then after we get our safari world ads going...we can put 
other ads 
in other magazines for doing these body building 
things. (laughter) 
JO: 
I'll 
tell you what. I think we'll run down to that other 
marsh. Maybe we can do a little better. It should be a little bit 
lower than here, and maybe not quite as much growth. There's 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 3 
plenty of growth. 
FA: How'd you make out with your cameras? Everything ok now? 
CF: Well, we, no. I think two of them are pretty well wrecked. 
We'll have to take em in and get them fixed. 
FA: Was you standing at the time? 
CF: Uh, I can't, I must have been. Yeah. I think I was standing. 
GP: Actually, he was sort of horizontal. (laughter) 
CF: Before or after I went in? 
JO: Your cameras both got water in em? 
CF: Yea. And one of em's mostly electronic and it's pretty well 
ruined, as far as I can tell. And the motor drive on the other 
one. But they've got water in em, 
so I've gotta get something 
done about it pretty quick. 
JO: 
I've got a towel here 
in the boat. 
CF: Well, but it's innerds. 
JO: OK, what do you wanna do? You wanna run down? 
CF: Yeah, 
let's go to the other place and we'll try to snap some 
more. Those pictures I took are ruined too, probably, cause the 
film got wet. 
JO: Do you have another camera? 
CF: Yes. Four, 
in fact. 
JO: Do you want us to go on ahead of you or we all 
go down 
together? 
CF: Well, we wanna, you wanna tow down again right? 
JO: Well, what I'm thinking is Frank and I can go on and go down 
in these two and you all 
can come down in those two. Yeah, just 
above Lil's and I'll 
be to the right hand side when you come up, 
come right up the shore I'll 
be close to the shore. OK? Alright, 
why don't we transfer our stuff to this boat and we'll go on 
ahead. Put the two guns 
in. 
(Sounds of moving things into boats) 
GP: We can put something in this boat, too. 
JO: Yeah, we will when you get down there. As soon as you get 
down there. Pull a switch. 
CF: So have any birds been netted that you... 
JO: We killed three. Saw three, killed three, picked up three. 
GP: Yeah, where have you been? (laughter) 
FA: There's two people gonna be shy of me. I know that. 
JO: Let's put everything in 
FA: Everything? 
JO: Yeah, except for the shell box and the gun, and everything 
else you can leave. 
GP: Only problem with Carl 
is the sign up there by Rich 
Dolester's (sp?) landing that says "No Swimming," so you've gotta 
be kinda cool about this. (laughter) 
JO: Have you ever heard about not rubbing things in? (laughter) 
CF: Well 
listen, I ain't worried about me. I just wish I didn't 
have to... (moving things into boats) Why don't I stay 
in 
this 
one Ger, and (sound of passing boat ?) 
JO: Go straight ahead if 
you can. Can you get through? 
CF: This 
is 
in the second marsh. Now from here on 
is 
the second 
marsh. 
JO: Straight ahead. Yeah. Alright, Gerry? I'll tell you what. In 
just a minute, we're gonna, I'm gonna try to push right up the 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 4 
edge of this creek 
in here, and you should be able to follow 
right along with us. Where you can be within just a few feet of 
us just by paddling the boat. Or running your motor or whatever. 
I think we can get up that edge. It's gonna be a little rough, 
but we oughta be able to pick our way up the edge of that. Just 
go right straight on ahead. What we want to do 
is go over and try 
to work the edge of that little creek there if we can. And just 
inside the edge 
is a little bit lower than right on the edge. You 
oughta be able to get in right there. 
FA: Do you get any red rail, Virginia rail 
down here, do you? 
JO: 
I've killed one that I ever remember. 
FA: 
Isn't that right? 
JO: That's right. Alright let's try, 
if we can do 
it, we'll 
try 
right down this edge. I don't know whether we can do 
it or not. 
Ready? (boats moving through water, calling:woo—oo) They're damn 
thick. They're daggone thick. Not gonna be able to do 
it. 
FA: We're not? Any other spots that might be thinner out there or 
what? 
JO: No. Just back up, back up way back up this creek again. Just 
up at the head where that rice, 
like where we were. 
FA: Probably need another couple weeks I guess, or a good tide. 
JO: A good tide, yeah. A good tide will 
do 
it. A good tide you'll 
get another six inches. You can push this without too much 
trouble. Well, 
let's go out. Let's go out and go up the creek. 
Let's see 
if we can make a sharp turn here. (To others) We can't 
do anything. You tell them we don't have enough tide. Let's just 
go up that little edge over there. It's not, shouldn't be as bad. 
And we'll come back through where we jumped those three birds. 
There'll maybe be more back out again after we...woo—oo, woo—oo. 
This 
is my favorite marsh. 
FA: This 
is your favorite marsh. Is that right? 
J0: Yeah 
FA: This is nice marshland. 
JO: Ok, you wanna switch? 
FA: What's that? 
JO: Wanna switch? 
FA: No. No way I'm getting out of here. 
JO: Make it? Woo! Come on birds. Woo—oo! Damn! There oughts be 
birds right here. Woo! Always birds in this little piece here. 
They're just not jumping, that's all. Hmm! That's tough. Right 
here on this corner, should jump birds. I've jumped as many as 
five or six right in this one little spot at one time. I hear one 
running right there (gunshot). I got him. 
FA: He went ahead about... 
JO: To the right'' A little to the right? 
FA: Yeah, 
the bird's to the right. 
JO: Ok. He almost let us run by him. I heard him running 
before... 
FA: I heard him, but I didn't see him until he was up 
in the air. 
Did you see him running? 
JO: Yeah, I saw him running. But again, this 
is a good spot 
because you got this high stuff right there. They just run out 
and... 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 5 
F0: That's where you were headed for. 
JO: I haven't seen anything yet. Let me give you a hand. Think we 
got part of the marsh here too. Ok right here? Yeah, there are 
feathers right there. Should be right in there. 
F0: Yeah, I can see... 
JO: Oh, I see the bird. I see the bird right there. 
F0: Got your marker? 
JO: I don't see my marker. I got him. Got the bird. Now the 
marker should have been a little farther, right? 
FA: Yeah, a little bit further. I'd hate to get on top of 
it. 
JO: Look look 
look look, damn! 
FA: A little bird just got up 
JO: Yep, Yep• 
FA: To the right, mark right. 
JO: Yeah, you'll never get him up. Forget him. Alright, let's 
push straight ahead. We'll try to come up that edge, even 
if I 
have to help you push, we'll. 
FA: Yeah, ok. 
JO: Now, 
let's see 
if we see those markers 
 
Okay, we can probably push straight ahead a ways .... There goes 
one. Can you push? 
If I had my gun I coulda shot him quickly. 
Hold 
it, 
hold 
it. 
If we go any farther we're 
in big trouble. 
We may be gettin' ourselves into a mess. 
A lot of 
it's floating. 
Let's see 
if we can get around. (laughing) Watch out for the 
snakes. Come on bow! 
(exertion) Let me see 
if I can swing the bow 
around. (Chuckling) 
Let's slip along this edge, we might see one walking in the marsh. 
(a holler) That's where we shoulda jumped the bird before and we 
didn't. 
They're just not gonna jump for us. 
(Soo!) There you are 
-- it's not a good tide when you have a hard time pushing this 
marsh. 
FA: 
(something about knowing the birds are here, so it's 
frustrating) 
JO: Yeah, they're here.

(sound of a plane) 
FA: How come your boat pushes easier than mine? I like the 
feeling of your boat, I really do. 
It's such a beautiful river. 
This 
is 
really nice, I really like 
it. 
JO: Yeah it 
is. I love 
it. 
FA: This river has a marshy -- up where I live them guys still 
love to rabbit hunt up our way. 
The Rancocas, we still have a 
really nice river up our way. There's still plenty of marsh. 
But 
you need a real bad northeaster to get the extra tide to get up 
in there. 
JO: Down here, we get a heck of a northeaster, we don't get any 
tide with 
it. 
Not always. 
The best wind for us 
is southeaster. 
FA: Oh, how bout that now. 
A northeaster's good for us. You're 
guaranteed a good tide. 
That old northwester (both men go whew!) 
that's bad news here too I guess. 
JO: Oh yeah, sure 
is. 
FA: A good meadow's the one down at Bridgeport. 
Me and my boys 
--there's two occasions at least -- we went there, misjudged a 
tide, had to wait there quite a while, finally we got up 
in 
the 
marsh, we started pushin' around a bit, the tide started 
dropping, boy, I tell ya, that was too much. 
JO: Had a hard time gettin' out? 
FA: Yeah. Didn't even get a chance to push the meadows. We had a 
hard time getting out a the meadow, and I said to the boys, "Look 
the tide's dropping." 
PJ: So what's the consensus on the two boats? 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 7 
FA: He feels mine pushes easier, but I feel his pushes easier. 
JO: Must be about the same. 
FA: I feel they're about equal. 
JO: They must be about the same. 
Yours 
is a little more stable. 
FA: Stable, right. But yours isn't that rocky 
J0: No, when you're used to 
it. 
It's when you have somebody 
that's not used to 
it. 
FA: Well that can be the case even with a stable boat, really.. 
J0: What do you have on the bottom? Just plywood? 
FA: Just plywood. 
I got two little keels on the front and back, 
not that much to hurt anything. Normally most guys don't have it 
on there at all. 
It come that way, so I left 
it there. It's 
amazing how much you can wear on the wood with this grass. Sort 
of have to protect the wood on the bow from wear. You can 
actually burn that wood right off 
in a period of years. 
JO: The bottom of that boat of mine will be better towards the end 
of the season after it wears it some after that fresh fiberglass 
is 
on 
it. 
It'll wear it down. 
FA: Well this boat here, you see right in the center, 
it's worn 
every year, 
it's all 
gouged up and rough. 
PJ: You put fiberglass on the bottom of the boat? 
JO: Yeah, cause it's only quarter-inch plywood on 
it, 
and I was 
afraid, when I inherited it, 
it had been used some, I was afraid 
it would wear out, so I fiberglassed it some so 
it wouldn't. I've 
already had to replace one fiberglassing. 
FA: That boat of mine at home, that's the third bottom it's got 
on 
it. And I fiberglassed it the last time, and that's all 
that's 
holdin' 
it together. And all 
the boats that Campy has, they're 
all fiberglassed. 
JO: I think they go through the marsh easier when they're 
glassed. 
FA: 
I think so -- you get the weight, they're much smoother. 
This one fella -- a friend of mine -- he used that epoxy paint, 
then he waxed the bottom. 
He claimed it helps, but I don't know. 
JO: I used epoxy once, but you can't get it off when you go to 
repaint it. The fiberglass is the answer, I think. 
PJ: How old 
is this boat? 
FA: 
I'd say 25 years maybe. 
I think Ralph Tomlin built it. 
He 
was from Port Elizabeth, and I think he 
lives up 
in Millville 
now. 
JO: Did he build it just for railbirding? 
FA: I believe so. He's built a few skiffs before, this fella has. 
I never met him. 
I got it from a guy by the name of -- I forget. 
When I got it 
it had so many different coats of paint on 
it. Oh, 
it was thick. It was all 
checked and peeled. I sanded it down as 
best I could. 
(Albert knows how old it 
is) 
GP: This guy Albert Reeves is quite a character, Jim. 
FA: Boy, he's fun. Geez, I could listen to him all 
day. 
He's 
slippin' a lot now, but, years ago, he really had the tales and 
stories. He shoulda been an actor, that fellow. Good storyteller, 
isn't he? 
GP: Oh yeah, sort of acts out the parts of the various 
participants. 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 8 
FA: Any old timers down here you run into to talk to? 
JO: Used to bump into Ralph Sutherland once 
in a while. 
He'd 
come down and you'd see him once 
in a while pushin' his son. But 
I haven't seen him in years. 
And I see Mrs. Greenwire, I go up 
and stop 
in and say hello to her once 
in a while. 
GP: Does Franklin hunt railbirds once 
in a while? He's got a 
skiff, but he duck hunts with 
it. 
JO: No. 
GP: No other pushers down here any more -- Jim's the only one I know 
of . 
FA: Jim would get a kick outa comin' up there and seein' all 
the 
pushers and the gunners. 
JO: 
It used to be that way down here. I can remember when I was a 
kid, goin' and havin' -- we'd never have the number of boats that 
you'd have at one time -- maybe three or four together, but you 
can imagine, three or four on this marsh would hunt it 
in ten 
minutes. 
FA: That's the 
like about six 
other, early 
the tide gets 
little bit more easy 
'em, other times I'I 
Boudelier, not too h 
zagging real 
quick, 
birds up, nothing wi 
and they'll come thr 
boong! That's what a 
a storm, and I haven 
up with them. (laugh 
way they work up there. They'll go out, you know, 
boats, seven, and they'll just get alongside each 
in the tide, that really gets the birds up, and as 
higher, they'll start splittin' off, and they're a 
to flush. I mean, sometimes I'll 
push with 
I go off by myself. I seen, 
like 
in that 
eavy a cover, and I'll start in there zig— 
tryin' to get there before they do, get the 
II 
get up -- and I'll get out of their way, 
ough, and I can't believe it! 
Boong, boong, 
difference it makes, they'll be shootin' up 
't put up a single bird. 
So then I'll join 
ter) 
You can't beat 'em, join 'em. 
At one time between here and Benedict there were sometimes forty 
pushers at one time. They used to hunt a lot way up the Western 
branch. Owings says he plans to go exploring with a friend who 
really knows the marshes. The wild rice goes down to 
Whittington's and way up above Hill's Bridge. 
JO: They used to kill birds here up 
into November, but they had 
to know where to go. My dad talked about one day they -- he was 
down the river somewhere -- they went down --they had a big tide, 
and 
it was 
in November. And the two of 
'em killed over a hundred 
birds and when they came back up there was a guy 
in the river, 
had baited carp, fishin' his nets, and told 'em the wardens were 
waitin for 'em on the shore. And they had a gunny sack, and they 
put all 
the birds in the gunny sack, and stuck a pole down 
in the 
middle of the river -- just stuck a pole down 
in the mud and tied 
the sack to it and went ashore. And when they went ashore they 
said the wardens jumped all 
over 'em -- somebody had called them 
because they said they knew they were shootin' duck, cause it was 
so 
late 
in the season that they couldn't be shootin railbirds. 
So they told 'em, 
"Oh yeah, we were shootin' 
rail birds, 
look, 
got a limit right here." And when the guy came ashore that was 
baitin' the carp, they searched his boat too. 
GP: Every now and then the wardens'll get on you down here, 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 9 
that's for sure. 
FA: They patrol by boat, do they? We have the marine police up 
our way, especially on the Maurine River, oh boy. 
JO: I don't think they've ever checked my license. 
I got a 
ticket once for not having a cushion. 
FA: Little petty stuff....I remember this fella, he was the 
chairman of the ducks unlimited committee up our way, and they 
went out this one day, and they had to break ice and 
it rained, 
it took 'em two hours to get out to the Wading River, you know, 
walkin, and it was shallow, 
it was awful. They didn't get any 
ducks, and they came back, and they had to do the same thing, 
coming up the shore -- and meantime it turned to rain. And they 
got all 
the way up the shore, there was a warden waitin' for 'em. 
Didn't he write 'em up for not having their license exposed on 
their backs -- and they had put their rain gear on, you know. 
He 
watched 'em, waited for 'em to crash through the 
ice and all 
that, and he wrote 'em up! 
(chorus of disgust) 
JO: Went down to Sacks's Island not long ago, when you could 
kill one drake canvasback, and really, nobody was gunnin' the 
club at all, but this guy wanted to go down, they had a few 
ducks, and they went down, and they went through the same 
routine, that you described. 
They had, for some reason, all 
kinds of problems getting out there, and 
it took 'em a day and a 
half to get there instead of a three—hour drive, and all this 
stuff, and they had to walk 
in there or something because stuff 
was frozen and all 
that, and they got to the blind and the decoys 
were out and 
it was a shore blind, and they stepped up to the 
blind and as soon as they stepped in the blind -- one guy that 
had wanted to go had dragged this other guy with him, and this 
other guy really didn't want to go, but he had gone just to 
accompany him (laughing) and they stopped up 
in the blind, and 
the one guy that was being dragged along was just puttering with 
his gun, and the other guy looked up and said "Here they come! 
Here they come! Grabs his gun and jumps up and shoots just one 
time: 
(laughter) Five canvasbacks fell! Five fell. One shot. 
Five fell. 
And with that a voice comes out of the bushes and 
says, 
'If I hadn't a seen 
it, 
I'd never believe it.' And it was 
the game warden. 
He said, 
'Pack up, boys, 
it's time to go home.' 
And the one guy said, 
'What do you mean, I just got here! I 
haven't even unpacked my gun! What do you mean I have to go home? 
It took me a day and a half to get here!' (laughter) 
GP: Redheads'll do that a lot, you know.

GP: Okay, this 
is Gerry Parsons talking to Frank Astemborski on 
September 8, 
1984, with Peggy Parsons at the Nagra Keyboard. 
We're in the Library of Congress. 
We're talking to Frank about 
railbird hunting. Do you want to run 
? Okay. 
One of the 
things I really wanted to ask you about, Frank, was how did --
you started railbirding pretty young, didn't you? 
How did you 
get interested? 
What was 
it 
like, you know, the railbirding 
back 
in those early days? 
And how did you get interested? 
FA: Well, no one in my family hunted but the whole neighborhood 
most of the fellas were all 
rabbit hunters and duck hunters and 
I used to hang around down by the marshes down there and watch 
the fellas gun. 
GP: 
This was 
in Delanco, New Jersey? 
a 
FA: 
This was 
in Riverside, before I lived 
in Delanco. 
But of 
course, 
it was popular there, too. And just from being around 
the fellas and watching them put their duck 
(?) 
over and 
they used to wheel their carts down the street when we were kids 
and we'd hear them come down the street and we'd help push the 
boat in the car. We just thought that was neat, you know? Of 
course, being around it all 
the time, hearing the shooting, we 
used to retrieve -- they'd shoot blackbirds. We'd go down at 
low 
tide and retrieve the birds. The same with railbird hunting. 
We 
used to watch them go out in 
the marshes. 
Of course, we got 
interested. 
That was the thing to do when you were a kid 
in 
that neighborhood. 
Everything was hunting and fishing and 
that's what I wanted to do. 
That was the thing to do sort of, 
you know? 
And that's really how I sort of got my start. 
Then I 
kept, you know, asking the older fellas to take me along. 
There 
would 
be different skiffs around there and I'd go -- somebody 
would have a push—pole or a long 
limb or something, I'd go out 
there and fool around, me and other kids, we were just learning 
to push. 
GP: 
About how old were you when you first started trying to 
push? 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 11 
FA: 
Oh, geez, had to be maybe 11, 
12, 
something like that. By 
the time I was 12, a neighbor had gotten me a hunter's permit, 
which you was allowed to get, I think, at ten years old. I had 
gotten one at 12. But 
at that early age, I was always down at the marshes in that 
area. 
But what happened, we always asked the older fellas, 
"Hey, how about taking me along" and this and that. 
Some of my 
neighbors went and they'd take me along and what happened, 
they'd use me for a gunrack. 
That's the reason they took me 
along. 
I'd hold the gun on my shoulder. 
When a bird would 
jump, they'd grab the gun off my shoulder. So I was more or less 
-- that was the only way I got to go -- I was more or 
less the 
gun bearer. 
So that's how it all 
started. 
I didn't care. 
I 
just wanted to be out there. I thought it was really neat, you 
know, to be out there and see these birds and the fellas 
shooting and hollering and trying to flush them and it was just 
-- 
it was nice to see all 
the boats coming too, all the guys 
talking and razzing each other. 
GP: 
I get the sense that there were a lot of 
local people who 
were involved 
in railbirding at that time? 
FA: 
In a whole area, just anywhere on that river,(?), and 
where I lived, a lot of people went railbird shooting. 
A lot of 
them in -- 
in that section of Riverside, 
it had a nickname. 
It 
was called Swamppoodle, which was an unusual name, but that's 
what they called that section of town. 
The Snows went and the 
Alfred family and the Kupalevskis , they're all 
railbird 
shooters. There were several shooters from all over the town 
that would come down there and there was also an area called 
Wards Flats, where -- it was a big marsh area right where the 
Raincocas and Delaware meet. 
It since has been pumped in. And a 
lot of boats go out of there. Guys would come from other towns, 
like Beverly or from Riverton and so forth, and --
GP: Were there other young guys your age who were interested 
in 
it too? 
FA: That's a good question. I'm trying to think. I was really --
I'm trying to think. Not too many 
in railbird hunting I can 
think of, just a few. It seems like -- unless somebody really 
wanted to go duck hunting, but not too many railbird hunting at 
my age at that time. They all wanted to go shoot blackbirds and 
so forth. 
But that's funny, I got involved with 
it and I stuck 
with 
it, whereas no one else did. They'd go out occasionally if 
maybe somebody'd take them. But I just made sure I was 
down at that marsh as much as I could be so somebody would take 
me or maybe I could help push the boat or whatever, you know? 
There were -- let's see, down Riverside Park, there was a few 
fellas about my age that did go, and later on they just quit. 
Nobody really -- I'm trying to think -- my particular age that 
really hung in there and stuck with it. Most of them done 
it a 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 12 
while and they just went on to other things, you know, 
like 
field gunning or duck shooting. 
I mostly hung around with the 
older fellas that did it, 
and I just liked 
it from the 
beginning. 
I tell 
you, I can hardly remember missing any tides 
since I was 14 years old. 
You know, any tide I can catch on a 
day off or after school or after work, I can rarely remember 
missing any, up til 
today, up til 
now, all 
them years. 
I just 
can't believe I did that. 
I'd just go every chance I could. 
I 
really enjoyed it. 
Even if I knew it was going to be a poor 
tide 
just to get out there 
in the boat and push around, even 
though I knew I wasn't going to go 
in a marsh, a certain marsh, 
or a certain day on account of the north wind, I still went. A 
lot of times you'd get caught in a ditch and shoot backwards. 
GP: 
Who were some of these older fellows that you mentioned 
that you learned from? 
What sort of people were they? 
FA: 
Just general --
GP: 
Were they river rats or 
I 
FA: 
Yeah, river rats. 
They just liked to hunt mostly for a 
hobby and food. 
None of them were really (unintelligible). They 
were just local people that worked in the local foundry. 
They 
might have been carpenters or something like that. 
Just basic 
everyday people, you might say. 
GP: 
Well, there must have been some old—time market hunters 
around there 
FA: 
Well, there was Snoze, he 
lived up the street from me. 
He 
used to show me his hand—loading tools. 
And they used to shoot 
the reed bird, the bobolinks. And he said he used to wait til 
he 
got it real heavily on the tossles (PHONETIC). 
And they'd shoot 
this real fine shot in 
to them, that way they'd get a lot more 
birds 
I think he said he used to sell them by the bushel, up to 
the Phila— delphia market. 
He'd run up by boat or something, I 
forget But he's the only one 
in that particular area that I knew 
that, actually shot for market. 
And I guess probably other 
fellow that did 
it. 
I'm just not familiar with it 
I think Fitzpatrick, the decoy carver, he was a railbird hunter 
also. 
He lived 
in Delanka. 
Of course, I didn't know him back 
then. 
And I think I heard that he used to sell 
to the market 
also. 
I wouldn't doubt it. 
GP: 
Was he the old guy that lived 
in the houseboat? 
FA: Right, on a houseboat, right next to Hawk Island. 
Now, Hawk 
Island was a great railbird marsh. 
See, at one time 
it was all 
marsh, the whole island. Now it's been pumped in. 
There's a 
couple of big lakes out there now. And my next—door neighbor-, 
Mrs. Geraldine Wilson, she remembers Dr. Wagner. This 
is before 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 13 
he pumped it 
in, now. 
And Johnny Perkins from up Edgewater 
Park. 
And she mentioned about two other fellows, and she 
remembered them pushing railbirds onto Hawk Island. 
He pumped 
that thing 
in about -- I guess about 1930, somewheres around 
there, that was pumped in. 
But prior to that, they were hunting 
railbirds out there then. 
GP: So there was a lot of railbird hunting right around your 
part of the Delaware River there, just above Philadelphia. 
FA: 
Yes, there was proper, just anywhere. 
Up the Rancocas 
and down 
in Palmar and the Riverside area. 
There was always 
boats out 
all 
the time 
a couple of different fellows. 
And of 
course, the Biddies, they always went. 
They'd hunt Mud 
Island, they'd tow their boats and go up the Rancocas and go 
up there. The favorite meadow was Rainbow Meadow; that's where I 
hunted for years. They always liked that marsh. 
That's the one 
I was telling you about that the reed disappeared. 
And that was 
always a low marsh. 
You'd get in there on a poor tide. 
It 
always had a lot of birds. It was always a favorite place to get 
into. 
There was a lot of other good marshes up there, but that 
was a favorite one. 
GP: 
And that that the wildlife just died out there? 
FA: Yeah. 
I think might have caused it, 
that outer bank is 
washing away. 
And there's an awful 
lot of current from it 
across the outer flat there. 
And maybe that has something to do 
with it, maybe it's washing the soil away that causes it to 
grow, I don't know. 
I really 
don't know. 
I call 
it the 
(unintelligible). 
People tell me some other type of plant life 
might be choking it out or the current might be causing it. 
The 
meadow is changing. 
He really wasn't sure. 
But it was all 
of a 
sudden in one season it disappeared, like that. 
And there was 
always —had me wild rice 
in there. 
It was a nice—sized meadow. 
And 
it's gone I think three years now. 
And of course, this 
Anderson farm, 
Anderson, that's who owned the marsh, they 
were railbird hunters. 
They used to go out. 
GP: 
When did you get your first boat? 
FA: Well, a couple of fellows had skiffs and I went out with 
them. 
One of them we did use at one time was sort of 
like a 
rowboat. 
It wasn't too good to push, but we got by with it 
because (unintelligible) were pushing it wasn't too heavy 
If 
you had a half decent tie you could get through there with that 
boat. And -- I don't even remember the first boat I got. I went 
through boats like crazy, you wouldn't believe. 
I had so many 
different boats. 
I'd buy, sell, fix, put a new bottom on 
it. And I 
don't even remember the first 
I got, to be honest with you. 
I'm 
trying to remember where I got it. I remember getting one, I think 
the very first one, and the bottom was 
in such poor shape I ripped 
the bottom off. And I put a new bottom on 
it with a cross—planking 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 14 
like your Patuxent River boats. 
I remember putting tar and cotton 
between the seams and using nails. 
And 
it worked well, I was 
really surprised. 
I think I used three—quarter inch planks And 
from then on, I picked up boats here and there. I guess I went 
through boats like you wouldn't believe. 
GP: 
When you first started hunting, you were living 
in, 
let's see, 
Riverside? 
FA: 
Riverside, right. 
GP: 
So you would have been gunning around in that area some. 
How 
did you get over to Mud Island? 
FA: 
As I got older, with a car and all, I could drive over 
there. Of course, when I used to duck hunt there, I used to row all 
the way from Riverside, all 
around Hawk Island to get over to Mud 
Island, to duck hunt. 
But I never went over there railbird 
shooting until I got my driver's license. 
Put my boat on the 
trailer and drive over to Delanco and launch it and go that way. 
That was a chore, rowing that boat all 
the way over. And out the 
Rancoca where I took the boats, no matter wherever you rowed, you 
was always bucking tide, either on the Rancocas Creek or on the 
Dahl River. 
No matter which way you went you was bucking the tide, 
the tide conditions, whether it's going up or down. 
When you went 
around that point you was either going to with the tide or against 
it. But I really didn't start coming to Mud Island until I got a 
driver's license. And of course, I could go around on a bicycle and 
stuff . 
Tiny Fitzpatrick, the old decoy carver. I used to talk to him a 
lot. And I used to always hear the fellows talking about gutting 
over in Mud Island, I could hear the shooting over there. I could 
see the boats around a little bit, moving around. At that time, 
that was like your bills were hunting it then. 
GP: 
So when did you finally (inaudible)? 
FA: 
The very first time was 
in 
'59. I went there one time, the 
very first time, my very first trip. And 
it was 1960 that I really 
started to gun 
it steady I started going down almost every weekend, 
because I didn't realize at the time that any other such place 
existed where there was railbird hunting. 
And I'm trying to think 
how I -- I really don't recall how I found out about it. 
Somebody 
did tell me about it. 
I just took a ride down and just by chance, 
I found out where to go there. 
Somebody told me about Albert 
Reeve's place and I stopped in there and talked to him. 
He told me 
where to go. 
You just didn't know where to start,it was like 
coming down here. 
That river is 
so 
long, I could have started 
anywheres. 
But if you're not in the right spot, what good 
is 
it? 
So he told me, oh, you have to always go above the bridge, from the 
bridge right on north. 
Anywheres in that area 
So then later on I 
met this lawyer from Philadelphia and me and him started going down 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 15 
together all 
the time --
(?). 
I joined his skeet 
got to talking about rai 
about. And he was fascin 
shooting. 
He used to go 
a few times, and he used 
decided to go together a 
once 
in a while I'd take 
didn't go I usually went 
ever since. 
GP: 
were 
a lot 
He used to go with a commercial 
and trap club,that's where I met him. 
We 
(birds and he knew what he was talking 
ated that someone else knew about railbird 
with -- I think he went with Albert Reeves 
to go 
in the camps. 
So then me and him 
lot, which we did. 
(Unin telligible) or 
a friend down there, but whenever he 
up by myself. And I've just kept on going 
Well, 
if 
you had good railbirding right around where you 
on the Delaware, why would you go clear down to Mossberg? 
FA: 
It's so pretty down there 
different. 
Not only that, oka 
pumping 
in 
all 
the marshes,the 
Delaware River. 
Now I lost my 
hunting grounds, see. 
It was 
filling it 
in. 
It became scare 
the enjoyment out of 
it. I jus 
seeing all 
the other boats and 
just the laughter and everythi 
heard about the marsh in River 
still going on. 
All these pus 
regular guys just hunting for 
I used to go. 
So then I made 
there. 
. It's just nice to go someplace 
y, 
now, right around '59 they started 
favorite marsh disappeared on the 
good hunting grounds, railbird 
about'59 they actually started 
e, 
and everybody quit. It really took 
t enjoyed going out hunting and 
everybody hollering and shooting and 
ng. 
It just disappeared. 
When I 
dale, I went down and I seen this 
hers, the commercial pushers and 
pleasure, 
it reminded me about where 
it a habit of continuing to go down 
GP: 
But you'll still getting a mess of railbirds right off 
almost off your front yard there, aren't you? 
FA: 
Oh, yeah, but it's washing away, 
it's quite small. 
still get good shooting there. 
Last year I had very good 
shooting there, and this year I went there on Monday, I had a 
very poor tide. 
All morning I got 11 
birds. 
And we travelled 
all 
the way down the Maurice River 
on Saturday, my boy -- and I 
think we got eight. 
I got more 
at home on a poor tide 
short period of time. 
And 
I didn't 
effort, I just took my time. 
you r --
GP: 
So for you the enjoyment 
other guys, out there. 
I 
in a very 
really give 
it any extra 
is being on 
the marsh with all 
the 
FA: 
Oh, yeah, that's the main thing, really. 
The 
fun, eating the birds and all 
that. 
But just being out on that 
marsh, just being out there. 
Same 
with duck hunting. 
If 
it's 
going to be a very poor day you just go anyway. 
You probably 
understand; you've been there. 
shooting is 
GP: How, do you think the marshes over here on the Patuxent 
compare with the Maurice River? 
Do you have any sense of the 
differnces? 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 16 
FA: They're about the same. But 
then again, I guess they're a 
little different. 
The only 
way to describe it 
is, especially if 
you have like Jim come up there, and he's taught me, he's seen 
things. You can start really comparing. 
But the biggest thing I 
noticed is 
the tidal change, the difference. 
We got a very big 
drop 
in tide there. 
It's about the same I guess up 
in front of 
Delanco. 
I think Jim mentioned a two, 
two and a half foot drop. 
And another thing that fascinated me 
is that once 
it reaches its 
peak, 
it might just stay there for an hour, whereas on the Maurice 
River and the Delaware it just comes up. 
When it reaches its peak 
it might stay that way maybe ten minutes or something and that's 
about it, 
it starts coming back down. 
That's the biggest thing I 
notice. 
But basically it's about the same. 
It's different, but 
it's the same type of rice. 
I don't think there's as much areas 
as we do. There's a lot of open areas like you seen on the 
Patuxent. 
There are some, but I think there are more open water 
areas on the Patuxent than the Maurice River. 
GP: Do you think the rice -- do you call 
it rice or oats or --
FA: We call 
it wild rice or reed. 
I notice down here from the 
books and so forth that they 
mention, they call 
it wild oats. 
We 
always called it reed or 
wild rice 
GP: 
Reeves said something about calling 
it oats,too, though. 
FA: 
Oh, did he mention those? 
I guess probably some of the 
fellows call 
it oats, too. 
But 
the most frequent term I hear is 
wild rice or reed. 
GP: 
Did this stuff down here seem any C different to you from what 
you saw on the Maurine River? 
FA: 
As far as the type of growth? 
GP: 
How thick 
it was, how high it was 
or anything like that? 
FA: Well, we went to the Boudelier and that was about half thick. 
It was very similar as what 
we run 
into, except there's one half 
of the Boudelier on the Maurice River. 
It was a very thin reed, 
and 
it could get pretty nice. 
It was a big area, too. 
It was 
plenty of room. 
But that marsh has always been that way. 
In a 
couple of weeks it will 
be flat. 
It goes down fast. 
Now, I 
didn't get a chance to see the other part of the river, the 
other marshes to compare it with. 
I imagine it's heavy. 
I 
imagine it's just as heavy as the Patuxent, probably. 
GP: 
My sense, having been up there on 
the Maurice River in early 
August was that the rice up there 
was not as high as this stuff 
here. 
FA: 
Well, 
it's hard to say, because it wasn't as high 
in the 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 17 
Boudelier, when you lived 
in that area. Now the other 
section above the bridge where there's a proper area to go, I 
couldn't say because I haven't been out there yet. 
It could be, and 
then again 
it might not be. 
It varies from year to year. I've been 
a couple of seasons where, geez, 
it 
looked like bamboo. 
It was 
high and thick. My goodness, 
it was unreal. 
GP: 
If you were going to try to put together the 
ideal railshooting 
skiff, would you combine any of the features of your boat and 
Jim's? 
FA: 
That's a good question. 
Both 
them have good features. 
I 
think -- tough question. 
A good question, but it's a tough one. 
Jim's boat seemed to have better lines for pushing through heavy 
rice. 
But yet, he pushed my boat and felt that mine was easier 
than his. 
Now you're talking about a combination between the two, 
I don't know how you'd solve that, but you would think the narrower 
the boat that's more narrow would have the least resistance and 
push better. 
But that might not be the case, either. I guess 
it might sink down lower. 
I don't know. 
But the other boat I 
have home and the sister to 
it, they push better than the one I 
have right now. 
And you seen how it tapers in and it's much 
narrower. 
GP: You say they are more narrow than this boat that you have? The 
boat you have at home? 
FA: Right, 
it 
is, 
right. 
At the base of 
it, 
the bottom itself. 
It's wider up top. 
It notice how sheer it came 
in. 
And plus the 
rocker makes a difference I think the difference on that particular 
boat -- I'd love to have the sister to 
it, which was bigger, 
it's 
really a two-man boat. 
Is, you get the rocker, and it tapers in; 
you don't have much bottom. 
And then the weight seems to make a 
difference. 
Because the one I have has a heavy build with a 
fiberglass on 
it. 
And the sister to 
it was the same way. And like 
I was saying before, you get that momentum going with one push and 
the boat just carries on. Whereas, the other boat, you need two 
pushes to get it the same distance. 
I found out where pushing 
with other fellows with 
regular type double-enders down there. 
And, man, they 
couldn't get over it. One good push and I'd go, 
and they had to push two times to catch up to me. 
Most conditions, 
that is. 
GP: So you think a heavier boat is 
better, actually? 
FA: 
It seems to be, 
it does. I could 
be wrong, but it just seems 
that way with the one I had there 
And you have to experiment, 
really, to really find out. 
But 
it seems to hold true. 
GP: 
It's hard to conceive of what sort 
of experiment you could do 
to --
FA: 
I've pushed the lighter boats and 
they just seem to lunge. 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 18 
They go easy, but they just seem 
to go the length of the pole. 
A 
friend of mine has one. 
It's easy pushing but it just went, sort 
of just lunged, and that 
was 
it. 
With the heavier weight, I've 
pushed a couple of 
heavy ones like that. 
When you give them a 
push they just 
drifted right on. 
The momentum and the weight of 
the boat just seems to crash through things. 
GP: 
So you had to straddle the seat there. 
Was that uncomfortable 
or did you have a hard time getting 
used to that? 
FA: 
Yeah, at first it was. 
But then 
it wasn't so bad. 
I didn't 
like 
it at first, but I got used 
to 
it pretty quick. 
I was 
surprised. 
I figured it wasn't 
going too well, but the calf of 
your leg back there just hits up against that seat, just sort of 
gives you a lot of support 
But I'd rather have that foot -- what 
do you call 
that? 
GP: 
Toe-brace. 
FA: 
Toe-brace or whatever. 
I think 
that's the thing I like best. 
You know what I'd like to have 
on this boat, too? 
A nice little 
deck on the front, also. 
It's all open, but maybe to 
lay the birds 
or to sit. 
I think 
it would give 
it 
little better looks, too. 
Seems like there's 
a lot of wasted room there. 
But the boat has 
nice lines. I think it's a very 
nice pushing boat. 
I really like 
it. 
It handles well. 
GP: Yeah, I've tried it by myself. 
And 
I think especially 
pushing with one person, 
it seemed to me 
like 
it was-- if you've 
got just one person 
in 
it, you've 
got of course to be down 
in 
the 
boat itself rather than up 
on the stern. And I didn't try pushing 
yours just by myself so I don't know how that compares. But it sure 
made a difference when there was nobody else 
in 
(inaudible), that's 
for sure. 
FA: Yeah, 
it does. 
Like you say, 
it really just goes over the 
top and through the reeds with 
no problem. But then again, that's 
nice, too, but when you're 
pushing by yourself with nobody to 
take turns with you and give you a rest. 
If you're pushing along 
with somebody or a group, you got to keep on pushing, whereas they 
can switch off 
GP: 
Jim said he practically never pushes by himself and he doesn't 
have that exact sort of (inaudible) 
FA: 
I was under the impression that 
he did, or that every time he 
went he took somebody with him. 
I was surprised about that. 
I 
actually thought, well, maybe 
once 
in a while he'd take somebody, 
but the other times he 
used to ----. 
I was surprised when he told 
me hardly 
ever (inaudible). But it seems like that would be 
something for him 
to look into. 
You can't have somebody all 
the 
time. 
Parsons--$4 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 19 
GP: 
No, I know there have been times 
that he's wanted to go and 
he couldn't find anybody to go 
with him. 
FA: Oh, I've seen fellows go by themselves and just lay the gun 
down on the bottom of the boat or off to the side and, boy, 
if that 
isn't hard to try to do. 
Reach down, and by the time you get the 
gun to shoot the birds they've already landed. 
A lot of fellows, 
I've seen the racks where they make them crossways, just get two 
sticks and bolt them together. 
Not sticks, but pieces of 
lumber. 
And use that (inaudible) like the type I'm using right now. 
Maybe 
something to that effect. 
GP: Well, 
it's too bad we didn't get into faster shooting 
yesterday. That was pretty evenly paced. 
(Inaudible) very exciting 
flurries there, 
it's too bad. 
FA: Well, that's to be expected. You get that. 
Just like Jim said, 
he took someone out there last year and especially being a very 
poor day, and they got 50birds in no time at all. 
GP: 
Have you ever had any experience with a brown bottom? 
FA: 
Oh, yeah. 
Well, this one fellow I think his name was Wayne 
Weston. 
And he had this double ended boat, and (unintelligible) 
and everybody come back, whoever took that boat out, they came back 
soaking wet. 
Boy that was about the most (?)thing you ever did 
see. 
It pushed 
It was round, double ended, pushed very nice. 
But 
oh, 
it was so tippy.And I used 
it several different times, and I 
went overboard more times. 
But the only type of round boat I've 
seen would be more like your clinker built. 
They were more round. 
I had one of them, I pushed that once. 
That was a heavy boat and 
it pushed pretty good. 
But I understand they were more popular 
down 
in the lower Delaware River, around Gibbstown, Paulsboro, 
Salem and Bridgeton. 
That whole stretch there is where you'll find 
a lot of clinker boats. 
GP: Now, did they do any railbirding down in there? 
FA: 
Yes, they did. 
I taught the and farmers down 
in 
the Salem 
area. 
I was surprised because there's a lot of salt 
in 
(unintelligible) but years ago there was a lot of wild rice, up 
there 
in the meadow area and all 
And even today it's a mixture of 
some wild rice and salt grass. 
And the birds use that. 
But nobody 
bothers to go out there after them. But they're still using them. 
But it was popular years and years ago. 
GP: 
I've got some photographs I'll 
show you when we get back to 
the house. 
A guy took some snapshots of a boat that was supposed 
to go 
into Newcastle, and it's along those lines. 
FA: 
Oh, Newcastle, really? 
Well, I don't know anything about 
railbird shooting there. I heard something about Blackbird Creek at 
one time. Does that sound right? 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 20 
GP: Yeah, that could very well 
be, yeah Bob Litzenberg up at Elkin 
used to go railbirding over in Delaware (inaudible) Creek, 
if you 
know where that is. 
FA: Which areas 
is that, near Salem or --
GP: No, 
it's on the Delaware side. It's just above Wilmington. 
The 
 
 Creek flows into the Brandywine River. 
FA: You're talking about Oldman's Creek maybe on the Jersey side? 
You're talking about the Jersey side now? 
GP: 
Delaware. 
FA: 
On the Delaware side. 
GP: 
Yeah, just above Wilmington. 
FA: 
Just above Wilmington, okay. 
GP: 
You know where the Cherry Island marsh is? 
FA: 
Oh, Cherry Island flats. 
I've gone there. 
Is that where it's 
at, then? 
GP: The  
 Creek makes that mars--
FA: 
I can remember when I first started gunning down there, there 
was that 
Flats, at low tide you could see some of the brush or 
roots or something on the sand bar. 
I think 
it was a short time 
later they came 
in and dredged that whole area out. But do you 
remember that as being an 
island at any time or anything? 
It 
probably was at one time. 
GP: 
I grew up around the edge of 
it, 
and I never had a sense of 
it 
being ---- 
Creek flow right into the Delaware River. 
It's the 
northern edge of Cherry Island. 
FA: 
You've got that Christina River too. 
Doesn't that come 
in 
there someplace? That's further down from there 
right? 
GP: You know where the big power plant is? 
It's the (inaudible) 
and there's a power plant 
And the ---Creek is the creek just 
below that. 
But anyway, back 
in those marshes there used to be a 
lot of railbirding. 
FA: 
Okay, because (unintelligible) directly across from that power 
plant. 
It was called Helm's Cove, on the Jersey side. 
Deep water, 
right there. 
Okay, I know where you're talking about now. 
GP: 
How did you ever go down there to Cherry Island? 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 21 
FA: Oh, geez, when I first got my driver's license I drove 
everywhere on my days off. 
Sundays, just exploring places. 
I'd 
launch the boat and go 
look around then come gunning season I'd try 
these places. 
Or I'd ride down after it got light and see a raft 
of ducks or somebody gunning there. 
And I'd launch my boat, ask 
somebody for a place to 
launch a boat, and I'd just try these 
places. 
Just wanted to go someplace different all 
the time. 
GP: 
So you've gone pretty much up and down the Delaware River 
then. 
FA: 
Oh, yeah, there's probably any place I haven't gunned on both 
sides of the river. 
I've been to just about every place you can 
name. 
Same way on the coast, all 
the way up the coast up to Raritan 
Bay all 
the way down. Barnegat, down to the Great Sound, 
all 
the way down there to Wildwood and Reeve's Beach, Maurice River 
Cove, Bridgeton, Egg Island, right on up the river, Salem. Salem 
Cove,---Wash Creek. Same way on the Delaware side. 
I've gone just 
about every inch of the whole coast. 
GP: 
You've done some snapping turtle. What other sorts of things 
have you done 
in the course of 
a year? 
I'm just wondering how the 
railbirding sort of fits into 
like a yearly pattern. 
FA: Well, as you said, the railbird season comes on September 1. 
Then they go 
into duck season which comes in next, 
in early 
October. In Pennsylvania it usually comes in earlier than Jersey,as 
a rule, until 
last year. 
But it used to come 
in 
like about a week 
or two. I start that, and I always have gotten a Pennsylvania 
license, Delaware and Jersey. That way there, I had someplace to 
duck shoot from October 1 clear up to February.

And I've been out there when it's been very quiet 
(?) 
carp(?)high mark and 
I'm sitting there quiet with my 
brother, sitting there waiting, and you hear them come in, 
like a 
breeze, a bunch of them, you see. 
MR. 
What's that? 
The birds? 
MR. 
Several hundred of them. 
MR. 
At nighttime when they're flying. 
MR. 
Is that right? 
Have you ever heard them, Jim? 
AR: 
We got a 
today. 
That ought to do 
it, oughtn't 
it? 
MR. 
Well, we'll see 
if 
it will 
do 
it. 
MR. 
Hey, that last time we was here, neither one of our 
recorders worked. 
AR: 
(Unintelligible). 
MR. 
Boy, that was awful. 
AR: 
You see, you have to watch what you 
say, 
if you've got that thing going. 
Do you have a way of 
cutting it out, don't you? 
What do you call that? 
MR. 
Get the CIA --
AR: 
On TV every once in a while, somebody gets -- and I hear them 
cut them off 
like that. 
How can they do 
it so damn 
quick, I wonder? 
MR. 
We just use scissors 
(Laughter.) 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 23 
AR: 
(Unintelligible) plenty nowadays, 
these machines do, 
make a machine (unintelligible) 
does 
it instantly, before you even say 
it. 
I was going to 
tell 
you a story about -- good to put it on talk. 
But you can 
cut 
it out, can't you? 
MR. 
Oh yeah, we can cut it anytime we want. 
MR. 
After everybody's listened to 
it. 
(Laughter.) 
AR: 
Yeah, 
like some of these women, 
you're telling a 
joke a little on the risque side, and 
they'll say, "Ain't 
that awful?" 
(Uninteliigible)(Laughter.) 
MR. 
Albert, what were you saying about when you started 
railbirding? 
I heard you say something about 75 years ago, you 
were railbirding? 
AR: 
No, I said I helped tie them up for the gutters or 
for the guides, bring them up to their car, bring them up here, 
see? 
My place 
is 
as far as they got, and we kept 
times, right 
down there, right at the end of the street. 
MR. 
How did they have them cleaned? Who cleaned them for them? 
AR: 
Oh, 
that's the thing. 
(Laughter.) 
Picking them, 
we called it. Of course, those high—class society people call 
it 
plucking. 
That is a nicer word, 
isn't it? Watch out, you'll 
get your tongue twisted up there. You've got to watch that, you 
know.(Laughter.) 
MR. 
What did you call 
it? 
AR: They call 
it plucking. "Pick" doesn't sound so good, 
does 
it. 
MR. 
You called it pecking them? 
AR: Pick, 
like picking out. 
but those 
women especially used to talk about plucking. 
They'd say, 
"Well, will you pluck my bird?" and I thought, "Well, 
I'll 
pluck your bird anytime." 
(Laughter.) 
No, we plucked them for them or picked them, and (unintelligible) 
That's $2.00 a dozen. 
MR. 
$2.00 a dozen. 
AR: 
That's cheap enough. 
MR. 
Yeah, that was real cheap, a lot of work. 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 24 
AR: 
And I mean, we were good pickers. Of course, some 
were better than others, some were faster than others. 
I think 
my brother was the fastest 
He wasn't only fast, but he was 
thorough, did a wonderful 
job You sort of spit on your thumb. 
Spit does 
it better than anything else, 
like shining your shoes, 
you spit on them. You spit on your thumb, go 
like that, the thing 
goes down. 
The only thing that gets bad 
is when you get down 
around his asshole, his rectum. 
How does that sound on there? 
(Laughter.) You get down there, you've got to be careful. 
(Laughter.) It's all 
true stuff, you know? 
MR. 
Oh, yeah. 
AR: 
And I think if you take 
it away from 
some of these stories, you really ruin them. 
You've got to 
tell 
it 
like 
it 
is. 
God, he's going to blow the place up. 
MR. 
The bomb 
is 
getting rigged up. 
MR. 
they charged a dime a bird. 
MR. 
Really? 
A dime a bird? 
MR. 
A dime a bird. 
MR. 
That's quite a bit, 
isn't it? 
MR. 
No, 
it's less than what he says, $2.00 a dozen. 
Is that 
what he said? 
$2.00 a dozen? 
AR: 
Yeah. 
MR. 
They charge a dime a bird down there for years and years 
and years. 
AR: 
How much? 
MR. 
A dime a bird, ten cents a bird. 
MR. 
like --
Isn't that funny how the price won't go up, just 
AR: 
It may have been a dollar. 
But we didn't like to 
pick them anyhow, but it ought to have been, don't you sneak 
(unintelligible). 
Most of them chauffeurs. You people ain't got 
no chauffeurs. You people ain't worth a lot of money or nothing. 
(Simultaneous conversation -- unintelligible). (Laughter.) 
AR: 
They said they hated to see the real 
bird season come in, 
you know, because they expected the 
chauffeur to pick their birds for them. 
MR. 
Oh, for heaven's sake. 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 25 
AR: 
Well, chauffeur's, to begin with, don't know how to 
pick birds. 
I was brought right up picking birds, from when I 
was just a kid, a little kid, picking birds. 
If my father caught 
us skinning one, which of course, you really had to do 
if 
it was shot 
too damn bad, 
if he caught us skinning good birds, we're apt 
to get skinned. 
MR. 
Is that right? 
AR: 
Yes, sir. 
MR. 
Frank, sit over here this time, will you? 
AR: 
(Unintelligible). 
Put him right up there. 
MR. 
Oh, those are the pictures I took? 
AR: 
That's right. 
That's a damn good camera. 
MR. 
How about that? 
They turned out real 
nice 
AR: 
I read where you underlined it. I haven't read much 
about that Pollack wedding or whatever it is. 
But I will. 
I 
read some of 
it. 
But actually, I looked at the real bird thing 
first. 
I'm a little bit mad at Peterson. 
I never knew him, 
because he didn't give this place here enough -- what's the word 
I want to use? 
MR. 
: Publicity. 
AR: 
That's it. 
That would be 
it. 
I've been trying to 
think of that the whole damn morning. 
Knew I had 
it somewhere. 
(Laughter.) 
We didn't need 
it though. 
Godalmighty, we've 
had so damn many people here and turned them away. 
But we 
didn't turn away the Campbell soup man. He said, "I'm the 
Campbell soup man." 
Well, I said, "It don't make any 
difference to me 
if you're the Heinz soup man. 
We cannot 
take care of you today. 
That's all." 
They didn't like 
it, 
never called me any more. 
Darns (PHONETIC). 
He's the 
biggie, you know. 
MR. He is, 
right. 
Chairman of the Board, I believe, for Campbell's. 
AR: 
Yeah, he's a big duck. 
I had a fella here 
yesterday works for him, works 
in the plant, Cameron 
MR. 
Cameron 
AR: 
I wanted to go up there and see 
that museum, see all 
of those -- they got the 
from Spain 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 26 
I think, the king and queen and all those jewels, the crown 
jewels and the royal thing there, free. 
Not necessarily 
because it's free, but I'd just like to see them, and the 
museums are there for everybody and 
it costs nothing to do 
it. 
Go there and pick up a crown or some jewels. 
I suppose 
they've got somebody watching there with a goddamn shotgun 
and a grease -- 
(Laughter). 
MR. 
Jim was just over there 
in Spain this summer. 
AR: 
That's where they came from. 
MR. 
It's a beautiful country. 
MR. 
Said they didn't have any railbirds to speak of. 
AR: 
I never found a man yet that knows 
much about railbirding, anything hardly, when you get 
below Maryland. 
Who's the head railbird man here? 
Is that 
you? 
No, the other two go all over the country looking for 
them. 
I don't get anywhere. 
I don't get out of town. 
In 
fact, my father said, you live 
in 
(?)long enough, you get so damn 
poor, you can't get out of town. 
(Laughter.) But I don't really 
think he wanted to though. 
MR. 
Jim's from Maryland. 
AR: 
Some of these guys that I take out 
-- like Harry Green (PHONETIC), you probably met him here 
one time, he's from New Jersey, but he's got a farm down in 
Maryland. 
He's got plenty of geese and does some birding 
there, but he says they're better, and he's a damn good 
gunner. 
He's gunned here for years and years and years. 
He's the last man I ever took gunning, Harry Green, and I 
took him up Port Creek (PHONETIC) and got him his limit, 
25, a few years ago. 
He 
me. 
I had retired. 
I had stopped 
MR. 
Right. 
I remember(?) took him out. 
(Inaudible)? 
AR: 
No, he's been here quite often. 
MR. 
I said you were only pushing once 
in a while. 
AR: 
Not at all, at that time. 
I hadn't 
pushed for quite some time, and Mort was supposed to push 
him. 
(Inaudible) terrible bad day and had the water all 
over everything, you could see a real bird a mile away, 
my God, just nothing but water, and I says, "You got here 
late." 
(Unintelligible) so damn bad. 
Said he was going to 
a wedding, his wife's family, was all 
set to go to the 
wedding, and by God, here come Morton and Harry with him. 
"By God, they're after me." 
And had that goddamn boat 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 27 
Johnny built. 
She's top—heavy and --
MR. 
Have you been down there? 
MR. 
Yeah. 
AR: 
I don't know what he's doing now. He told me he's building 
four or five. 
MR. 
Yeah, on the same line. 
AR: 
I know. 
MR. 
Johnny -- well, I know, but (unintelligible) those 
oldtimers, you couldn't beat them building a boat. 
By God, 
I'm 
telling you, built some of the greatest boats you've ever heard 
tell 
of them, and that's the one I had to use, the only one 
available. 
But I never went off. 
I stuck right there on deck, 
and we went up Port Creek right up there and the tide(?) was so 
damn and fog had been so damn big you'd think maybe it was a (?). 
When we went under part of the bridge, we called it Port Creek, 
we were under there. 
The tide had fallen, probably about six 
inches. 
It was like a terrible big storm tide, been wind to the 
east here three or four days, and it's storming like hell and 
raining. 
That we had to sort of get down this way to get under 
the re . 
I said to Harry, I hear two shots up 
in there. 
Here's a couple of boys, you might say, with a damned old 
back tow pushed around there. 
I thought, my God, they're 
getting birds, and they was getting some birds. 
And we got 
into them, plenty. And he's a dead—eye dick anyhow, Hi 
is. 
We weren't up there no time before we got over 25 birds, and 
the last time I (unintelligible). 
GP: 
Jimmy has got the high boat for the year. 
AR: 
Yes, he has. 
MR. 
That isn't saying much today though. 
AR: 
How many shells did you use? 
Or don't you want to 
tell? 
MR. 
Oh, he doesn't want to talk about that. 
AR: 
Well, we always said, what we always liked, what 
(?) always liked, 
is a big tide, a small man and a good shot. 
And a tipper, too. (Simultaneous discussion-- unintelligible.) 
God, that's awful. 
That's terrible, isn't it? 
MR. 
I guess it's worth it. 
I'm tired. That's a lot of work. 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 28 
AR: Well, you done a lot of 
it yourself. 
But according to other things, well, $25 an hour, I guess 
they charge over here working on my outboard motor about 
$20 an hour. 
Of course, this 
is specialized work, pushing a 
boat 
Once a while one of these guys will say, well, 
let me 
hold that pole there and you get up here, 
let me get up 
(unintelligible) pole stuck 
in the mud and pulling and pushing 
and pulling and having a hell 
of a time. 
Colonel Biddle used to come 
in here and (unintelligible). 
Not 
Mercer Biddle, but --
MR. 
Nicholas. 
AR Yeah, Nicholas. 
He's something else. 
MR. 
He's a general. 
AR: Oh, yeah, yeah. Armchair general, 
maybe the governor of Pennsylvania, maybe a general. But he 
has been in the service, I guess. 
But how about old Mercer 
Biddle? 
He was something else, wasn't he? 
MR. 
Oh, yeah. 
(Inaudible.) 
AR: I never found out really about that. 
All 
the old timers 
is gone. 
But I understood he was shot 
out. 
MR. 
I heard that, too. 
AR: But I don't think it was done here. 
Now, he used to gun a lot up there where you are. 
MR. 
(Unintelligible.) 
AR: 
Delanco, was 
it up there? 
Delanco 
and (unintelligible), along there? 
MR. 
Right, that's where I live. 
AR: Oh, you shot it, 
did you? On his own marsh? 
He 
owned an 
island out there, didn't he? 
In the middle of the 
Delaware River? 
MR. 
Yeah. 
AR: 
I haven't been up the Delaware. 
MR. 
He's still there. 
AR: 
Yeah. 
Are there some reeds around there? 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 29 
MR. 
: Yeah, there's still some reeds. 
AR: 
Birds have been sighted this year? 
MR. 
Yeah, I've(?) some birds . Best day I had, me and my boy, 
we got 11 birds. 
AR: 
You did? 
MR. 
Yeah 
AR: 
You never tried them here. 
A week or 
so ago (unintelligible ) once 
in a while. 
Candy wasn 't there 
but his wife she's up on 
it all 
the time. 
And she said, I 
said, how 
is old Mrs. Camp? 
How are we doing now? 
About 
the same, she says. 
Not improving much. 
About the same. 
That's the worst railbirding season I've ever seen. 
And like 
I said, I remember 75 of them. 
I don't know if 
it was before 
that or not. 
MR. 
You're talking about Mercer. 
Remember you said something about a glass eye? 
Didn't you 
say he got that from France or something? 
AR: 
Yeah, I told him how good 
it 
looks. 
I said, my God, that's a wonderful eye. 
By God, that was so 
eye. 
My God, he ought to be. 
I think he said he paid $800 
for it. 
And he says, it'ain't worth a damn, I can't see a 
damn thing out of 
it. 
He said he'd (unintelligible) times 
before he finally did, out there 
in 
his garage. 
Was he 
ever married ? This was a long time ago. 
MR. 
Yeah, his wife 
is still 
living. 
AR: Well, he was a kind of sporting man, 
a dude. 
Smoking cigarettes and had emphesema the worst you 
ever heard tell 
of. 
And light one cigarette right back of 
the other and drink all 
the 
there was. 
MR. 
He 
liked his rum, didn't he? 
AR: He was a good shot, too. 
My God, 
he had two eyes. Can 't you see as good from one eye as you 
can with two? 
MR. C,9 
I had a friend who -- in my high 
school who had his eye put out and he was still quarterback 
for the high school football team. 
So he could see well 
enough to throw and everything. 
You can do 
it, 
but it seems 
like 
it would be awful -- 
r
,• 
MR.)'JYou have to compensate for it. 
MR. 
Yeah, right, you have to compensate. 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 30 
A good friend of mine who's an English soccer player has 
played sub—professional soccer all 
his life with one eye. 
MR. 
Really? 
How about that. 
AR: I just read a bit about it. That's a 
terribly rough game, 
isn't it? 
Is 
it rough as 
in football? 
MR. 
No. 
AR: 
I don't like football. 
(Simultaneous discussion -- unintelligible.) 
AR: 
Do they bounce it off their heads or am I imagining things? 
MR. 
No, you can bounce it off your head. 
AR: No, I watch 
it on TV some. But 
football, I don't understand. I suppose that's the reason. 
But I'm just like that racer come over here. He took one 
of the big shots of the game with him. And he says, 
it 
looks like whoever can run the fastest or whoever is the 
strongest can win the game. 
MR. 
Well, that's about what it amounts to, 
right. 
AR: You just run into them and knock the 
hell 
out of them, you see. 
And what I don't like 
is they 
all 
pile on top of a man when they've got him down. 
They 
all 
have to get on him; 
it looks to me 
like they're just showing 
off or something. 
A man down on the ground with a 
whole bunch of people on top of him, 
it's a wonder to me they 
don't get hurt a damn sight worse than they do. 
I don't 
like that. 
I call that cruelty to animals. 
(Laughter.) 
Yeah, pile up a whole damn pile of them, big men. I think it's all 
uncalled for. 
MR. 
You didn't play any sports 
in school? 
AR: 
No, I wasn't a sporting man. 
I'm 
more for the -- never got to be like Bill Tillerton or nothing 
like that. 
I'm talking about old timers. 
Jim Connors, 
is 
it? 
I'm not up on that too much. 
But that was my favorite, 
that can be bad, too, I guess -- tennis. 
I kind of like 
that. 
We had a tennis court here 
in town years ago, just a 
grass court, and I liked that pretty good. 
But baseball, 
I was afraid of the ball, and you never make a good ball 
player if you're afraid of the ball. 
I never heard tell 
of one man getting killed. 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 31 
Years ago, something like Rabbit Mansville or something like 
that. 
Years and years ago. 
MR. 
Got killed doing what? 
AR: Hit in the head. 
MR. 
With a baseball? 
AR: Baseball. I love that, I really go 
for baseball 
And this wrestling, I go for that. 
Not 
college wrestling, I don't see none of that damn stuff. 
I 
want to see them get in there and throw each other around. 
It really don't have nothing to do with wrestling. 
But I'm 
telling you, don't you think they can't wrestle, though. 
And I had the head man here that promoted the bouts for 
(unintelligible), known him for a long time. 
He said, 
Reeves, those guys couldn't be 
in business if 
they 
and begin to holler and raise hell with them. 
They're 
coming out there, Gorgeous George throwing roses all 
about 
to the women, coming out there with a big bunch of roses in 
his arms. 
And the damn Hindu gets out there and puts a rug 
down and goes through a ceremony and all that stuff. 
I go for all 
that show, see. They grab each 
other, they get hurt once 
in a while. 
They know how to 
jump on each other, because they know where to jump on you. 
(Unintelligible) throw you down an d jumping on you. 
I do 
go for that stuff. 
He says, 
it's a show, yes, but it's not 
all 
show. 
He says, of course often they got cops up there 
when they have these big matches. 
And he says, people want 
to get in there and get at them. 
Why, he says, they'd pick 
up an ordinary man and throw him clear out of the back door. 
Just like that. 
Why, of course he would. 
Let me at that 
bird, goddamn son of a bitch 
let me at him. 
I'd like to 
get hold of him, the dirty stinking thing, he says. 
Look 
what he's doing, busting a chair over somebody's head and 
all 
this stuff, and run him head—on into a post. And the guy 
looks up and he's going along with him, have you ever watched 
that? 
Looks up, he's letting him take him. 
Ain't that funny? 
Seems so funny, don't it? 
You think he's all 
in. 
But when 
he bounces back, he grabs that guy and turns him upside down 
I do 
love to watch it. 
MR.I Albert, did anybody ever get hurt gunning out here? 
AR: Not seriously. 
A cousin of mine did 
get shot pretty bad 
in the back. He got shot pretty bad. 
I had to take him down to the doctor's and get him to out 
them out. They made lumps on him. He had several of them. 
I got stung once right in the middle of the lower 
lip. 
(Unintelligible) very fortunate, very fortunate. 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 32 
Because the number of gunners they've had here over a period 
of so many years, nobody ever did get hurt. 
MR. 
That guy today shot two 
loads all 
around him and not a 
single pellet hit him. 
AR: 
That's right. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
AR: 
I thought I heard something go by 
that sounded like a whole bunch of bees. 
That might have been 
him 
(Simultaneous discussion-- unintelligible.) 
AR: 
I'll 
tell you, though (unintelligible) 
I jumped overboard. 
(?) 
says, what in the hell you 
doing that for? 
I says, oh, 
it was either do that or get 
shot right through the middle of the gut. 
Looked to me 
like 
I was looking right down that gun barrel. 
They get excited, you know. 
Get excited as hell 
over a railbird. 
MR.•'' That's probably why they put a seat in our skiffs down 
there. 
A gunner can't swing around 
if 
he's straddling that 
seat. 
AR: 
Well, we tried all 
kinds of things 
in them boats to keep people from falling down. 
Of course, 
there was a man had a lot of trouble standing up to get him 
down before he does fall 
down and come over backwards and his 
gun go off and shoot your head off. 
But we tried to fasten things 
in our boats, something 
you could lean against going forward. 
I made say 
like an 
iron about a half inch, anyhow. 
And sort of made 
it flat 
and then down each of the sides of the boat. 
One 
in front a 
one 
in back, sort of steady. 
Didn't seem to work out too well 
So we didn 't bother too much with that. 
But a man that's 
having a lot of trouble standing up ought to sit down. 
Then 
he's at a disadvantage. 
You can shoot better standing, and 
also you can't shoot a bird as quick before he jumps up. 
Especially when you're in that high reed, when they get as 
high as this ceiling. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
(Simultaneous discussion -- unintelligible.) 
MR.• 
I had a guy 
like that once, he went overboard four or five 
times, and about after the end or the fourth time he says, damn, 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 33 
if 
I'd known 
it was going to be 
like this, I wouldn't have come 
(Laughter .) 
I said, 
if I'd known 
it was going to be 
like this 
I wouldn't have brought you. 
AR: Had some awful funny experiences here 
with the gunners. I'd kind of 
like to see nose glasses. I had a 
pair one time I wore just (inaudible ) with a black silk 
cord to try to 
look 
like -- who was it, 
Tim Conley or somebody 
Had a little 
(?) 
in those days, and she said, 
come on and put those on, I put some papers around and looked 
kind of 
important . But it 's a hell 
of a place to wear them 
out 
in the meadow. But this guy did, some doctor from 
Philly. And had a goddamn good gum; too, he did. And 
he got through the tide, and whether he had his gun or not, 
I don't remember all 
that detail. 
When you get in around the shore there, usually 
there's a -- that's where the gnats are, along the edge. 
A 
lot of times you come ashore there are gnats and mosquitoes 
and things 
So he's going this way, George said, and he lost 
his glasses . My God, he says, I lost my glasses, I don't 
know just when. 
Well, George , he says , I don't know just 
when you lost them, but I did notice along about halfway 
through the charge you began to shoot better. 
That's when 
he 
lost them. 
(Laughter.) 
MR.(- Q 
You were telling about an admiral 
I don't remember whether he was a British admiral or an 
American admiral from the Philadelphia Navy Yard --
AR: 
(Unintelligible), sat right there. 
Admiral 
sat right there, and I had a guy, an old 
timer, a guy who would take 
it him, didn 't care whether he 
was an admiral or a king ` the way 
Ij 
was talking to him. 
I 
heard him holler to him, good God,-Zu .couldn't hit a bull 
i 
the ass with a banjo." (Uninte)ligible
)' bill, that was an 
admiral. 
I don't give a damn. r Those rough old guys -
those old 
are tough. 'I didn't give a damn 
if 
he was 
a king, '•e says . But the admiral got a great kick out of 
it 
I tried to apologize to him (inaudible) 
Well, he says, 
•I kind of got a kick out of}fi. 
days, 
I'm used to givin
CCg••o•rdwe•r 
all 
the time, and I didn't mind taking them for once. Some 
l 
thing different . I couldn't do a damn thing about it,"he sawl 
Couldn't do nothing about trim.' 
MR.• 
What did your guides used to do when you had somebody come 
down that you knew wasn 't a good shot? Which guides got the ones 
that couldn't shoot? 
AR: 
I'm telling you, I was 
in 
the middle 
Of course, my father did 
it before I got at 
it. 
my father 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 34 
has been in his grave for 40 years. 
Of course, after I was 
here and the rest of the boys I had had all 
pretty much 
married. 
And of course, I took over. 
And 
it kept getting 
bigger. 
After Pop died, more people all 
the time. 
Somebody 
told about Bob Burton,that guy will take Bob Burton down to 
Marshtown, pretty soon you've got so many damn people you 
can't handle them. 
And you ask what the guides think of them or what 
MR. 
How did you allocate as to who got the bad shooter? 
AR: Well, that was kind of the technical 
part. 
That gets kind of tricky. 
See, the good pusher was 
the good gunner. 
I would put a new gunner, after he found 
out he couldn't gun very good I'd still try to put him with 
a poor pusher. 
But he's still want a good pusher. 
You had 
a lot of goddamn complicated things. 
The pushers coming to 
me, the pushers didn't like to 
the gunners, either 
I don't want to take that old son of a bitch, I don't want to 
take him. 
He's a crabby old thing, I don't want to take him 
And a gunner would come to me, hey, I want that guy. 
He's 
already been asked for by another guy, see. 
They knew these 
guides, some better than others. 
Of course, I shouldn't brag but I was considered 
one of the best. 
Of course, they can't nobody deny it because 
there's nobody near my age to talk about it. 
(Laughter.) 
(Inaudible.) But that's the way we boys did, 
though, four or five of us. 
Push boats and -- like I say, 
I come out of high school when I was about probably 16 years 
old, 
15, 
16. And Pop says, you're going to work when you do 
So that's when I pushed professionally for five bucks. 
Five 
bucks. Christ, I thought I was rich. Got a five dollar bill 
MR. 
Well, how did you work out that kind of thing that Jim was 
asking about? 
That would be pretty awkward. I can imagine some 
of those people would get kind of stuffy. 
AR: 
Oh, they did. 
Oh, I expect they 
cussed me. 
I've been cussed so damn much I expect (inaudible) 
22 years I got a three—way cuss. 
(Unintelligible) of course 
I don't know how I got off on this, but the cussing thing. 
And I thought I'd have a little fun with her. 
She was pretty 
nice but I'd have a little fun with her I got a three—way 
CUSS. 
You've heard tell 
of them. 
Is that some kind of a 
three way stretch brassiere or something? 
They do have them 
don't they? 
Don't you know anything about brassieres? 
(Laughter.) 
Evidently she did. (Inaudible) I got a little 
kick out of that. 
I said, the guy on that side of the bridge 
is cussing, he wants to get over. 
The guy here wants to get 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 35 
over there, and the guy that's coming down river is cussing 
me because I don't turn that bridge off. 
But when they blow 
that horn three times you're supposed to turn the bridge off. 
He was bigger than a rowboat. 
These new boat owners especially are scared. But 
I knew whether to get under it or not, provided I knew how 
good a waterman they were. 
They had to do with it. 
Everything 
has got something to do with it. 
You got to figure 
all 
out how well he can handle his boat and all that sort of 
thing. 
Because when we go under that bridge and there's 
a 16 feet clearance for the boat to go through, I mean, where 
the bridge closed overhead, you get underneath that, there's 
tie rods that go this way, too. 
But I watched them go through 
there and I knew by the size of the boat and by the height 
of the tide on the pier whether they get through or not. 
They'd be afraid to tackle it, 
especially new boat owners. 
And they all thought they had the Queen Mary, 
and 
it wasn't as big as one or two of our bateaus down there 
They were scared, for one thing, and (unintelligible) for 
another, and they didn't have long before they'd begin to 
build them up. 
They had superstructure; they had them higher 
than they were long. 
I threw my guts out in the bay 
in one 
of those damn boats. 
But they would be cussing me. 
You turn the bridge 
off, and they'd be cussing me on each side of the bridge. 
MR. 
Three way cuss, huh? 
AR: Two cussing me because I turned it 
off and the fellow in the boat cussing me because I didn't 
turn 
it off. 
But I usually turned it off. 
MR. 
What do you mean, turn it off? 
AR: Oh, --
(End of Side One ) 
AR: 
About 12, 
15 people every day. 
And I would be booked up 
from the beginning of the season on, that quick. 
Because some of 
these guys had been coming for several years. 
And they'd expect 
good times. 
Of course,----was the only man I ever heard talk 
about the stars. 
He even used stars to go by the tides. 
(Unintelligible). 
MR. 
: Too much of that rum. 
You say you'd have to figure 
out -- these pushers that worked for you had jobs? 
AR: 
That's right. 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 36 
MR. 
could .... 
And you had to find their vacation time so you 
AR: 
Yeah. 
When that was, yeah. 
Course, 
they didn't all 
get their vacations at the same time, you 
know. 
Find when they had their vacation. 
That would give me 
a chance to hire an extra guy come along, see 
MR. 
Ever happen -- have 
it happen that a pusher didn't show up 
or whatever, or a couple of them? What did you do then? 
AR: 
I have one of the greatest customers 
come here. 
Nobody to push. 
I think I told you that before. 
And she 
is a biggie. 
Her man 
is and she 
is too, I guess. 
Sitting back there 
in her car like 
a hidden (?). 
Mrs. 
Josephine Pugh 
(?) 
people. 
My God, she walks in here 
-- got messed up somehow. 
The only time I ever got messed up 
with such a big shot as she was...I got her cooled down 
pretty good. 
About that time my wife had been nipping a bit. 
And she got tired of 
it. 
I got her too damned bent cause I had her pretty 
well settled away, see. 
And she was pretty worked on that — 
worked on that pretty good that she couldn't hardly -- she 
was infallible -- couldn't hardly be her. 
And -- Oh, Mrs. 
Pugh. 
And I says, what. 
Don't have no guide for you. 
Oh 
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) what. 
I say, I didn't know you was coming. 
I'll just talk with you. 
Probably the night before. 
But she 
got me confused by saying that she had been gone or supposed 
to have gone that day down to the 
with Darrence, 
the Campbell Soup man. 
He'd invite her to gone down there. 
And get something about that. 
And I sort of got mixed up. 
Got her pretty well cooled down from what come at her. 
She says, I've been laying there listening to you 
Said, I don't like the way he's doing. 
Said he's not talking 
up enough for himself 
And I'd try to say something and she 
say, Oh, shut your mouth, she .says 
to me. 
And Mr. Pugh would 
keep standing there looking; didn't say nothing. 
Shut your 
mouth, she said, you big fat 
Shut your mouth, she 
said, you big 
fat dummy you. 
And all 
this sort of thing went on. 
I'd better not 
stir things up any more. 
(INAUDIBLE) that would keep quiet 
I guess 
So -- shut up. 
You ain't got enough gumption to take 
care of yourself. 
You going to stand up (INAUDIBLE). 
These 
people don't scare me because they got a barrel 
of money. 
And 
all 
this stuff. 
And she didn't say nothing. 
Well, Albert 
make another date. 
How about tomorrow? 
Yes ma'am. 
I'll 
take you out myself. 
I'll see that you get out there. 
I will 
take you out myself 
My wife here hears what I am saying her 
I'll mark 
it right down here. 
I will take you out tomorrow 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 37 
myself; I will 
do that. 
I had never pushed it before. 
Took 
her out. 
She's a good shot. 
She goes to pay me and I said, Ms. Pugh why don't 
you -- that awful mixup.... 
She said, 
let's don't talk 
any more about that. 
Let's just forget it. 
I swear I feel 
bad about it and I said 
I could have been wrong; I could 
have got it mixed up a bit. 
Evidently somebody got mixed up 
And I said, I don't want to charge you anything...that's on 
the house; I'll 
not charge you nothing. 
Well, she says, Mr. Reeves I guess you know I am a 
well-to-do woman. 
I said, yes, I heard that. 
And I guess 
you are a poor man. 
I said, you are so right. 
She says 
you 
don't think I'd 
let you take me out there for nothing. 
I said 
I certainly didn't and that's the reason I did it. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Well, thanks for being truthful about it, she said 
And another thing, I like your wife's spunk. 
Don't go up to 
the house and tell her. 
I sure liked her spunk. 
People don 
talk up to us much and said she wasn't a damned bit afraid. 
Of course she'd had a little hooch there, you see. 
Given a 
little stimulus there. 
Said, I really enjoyed her spunk but 
don't go to the house and tell 
her. 
I never did; I never did 
tell 
her. 
But I had those kinds of things to happen. 
MR. 
Were some of the people that you had 
to deal with kind of snotty ever. 
I mean those people who are--
AR: 
Oh yeah. 
Snobs. 
And they are one of 
the worst type of people I think are snobs. 
And another 
fellow I had one time here weren't well-to-do people. 
Like 
I say, I got a few people (Unintelligible). 
I mean, he's got 
a pretty good job, I believe, with the government. 
MR. 
Oh, sure. 
AR: 
And you got a good job with the Bell Telephone Company. 
MR. 
Public service. 
AR: 
Public service and does he do anything at all, does he? 
MR. 
Real estate, are you Ken? 
AR: Real estate. 
MR. 
(Laughter) 
MR. 
(Laughter) 
Push. 
Rich like you, huh 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 38 
MR. 
He's a pusher? 
(Laughter) 
AR: Well, we had this guy called Whiz. 
Called Whiz, 
like an automobile part or something years ago 
in Camden. 
Hollingshead. 
Oh he -- boy, he was something else. 
He'd met a chick here in town down at the race track. 
He'd 
met her. 
And she said, 
If you are ever down to Morristown, 
come down and see me. 
She was a nice woman but she didn't 
work at 
it too good. 
(Laughter) 
And she was rather attractive 
So, soon after that he'd met her. 
He called me and says, I 
want to come down to your place -- wanted to see her, for 
one thing. 
Just the main thing. 
You'll find out about that 
in a minute. 
He said I want to come down and go for birds 
Said, some of my friends come down. 
I want to come down the 
So when he come here. 
In fact, he was quite a geeser . And 
he says, Do you know Mrs. Owls (PHONETIC) here in town? 
Oh, 
yes I do. 
Yes, 
indeed -- not -- around the corner; not too far 
Oh, very lovely. 
Wonderful. 
And he says, I met her 
down at the race track and she was talking to me about the 
birding. 
She didn't go but she knew about it. 
And I told her 
I must come down and try 
it sometimes. 
So he got talking 
with her and got acquainted with her -- acquaintance, I guess 
he didn't know her before until he met her at the race track 
He was the kind of guy to get acquainted with and so was she. 
So they should make out well together. 
So he said, you know Mrs. Owl -- yes, 
indeed. 
How 
about I give her a call. 
I got some time; I tried to get her 
early -- I try to get them here early enough, you know. 
The 
only thing 
is 
if you get them here too early they want you to 
go out there about half—high water and you wear yourself out 
before the tide gets here. 
You can do more in the half an 
hour at the regular time than you can 
in three hours at the 
wrong time. 
MR. 
(INAUDIBLE) 
AR: 
I'd get off. 
You see, 
I'd get off. 
I'd get off on one thing and go up on another thing. 
Had to 
get back here 
I had to give her a call. 
Go ahead 
help yourself. 
Said, You're gone quite some time? 
And these 
guys down here getting a little uneasy and I'd get uneasy too 
They sort of 
look to me to do everything, see. 
So she's got a big fancy convertible. 
She drives 
up and he's all 
spread—eagle on the back seat. 
He isn't 
seat --setting with her. 
Got the top down and he's sitting 
there all 
sprawled out like this. 
I think he's got two or 
three British tip drinks down him. 
And he's lying back' there 
And I am standing out front looking for him, walks around 
there. 
He's sprawled out on the back seat there -- her and 
her big fancy convertible. 
And her in her short shorts. 
And 
he says, Reeves, says, I got to thinking it over since I got 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 39 
to talking with Harriet .... It was Harriet by that time; when 
he 
left it was Mrs. Owls, but when he come back 
it was Harriet 
So he says, I've decided, Reeves, I won't go gunning 
Harriet is going to drive me around the countryside and --
lovely country, he says. 
Of course I thought so. 
Going to 
drive me around the bay and we may go down to Cape May and 
(Unintelligible). 
I says, It's not that easy, Mr. Hollingshead. 
There's a man standing right there waiting to take you out. 
Oh, 
he says, why I can take care of that. 
What do 
they get, Mr. Reeves. Ten dollars. Okay. And I don't think 
I can see everything I want to see 
in one day -- he stayed for 
two days. Says, Here, where's your man there 
Too bad I wasn't signed up for him, but I didn't do...I could work 
but I didn't do 
it. 
Here you are $20. 
The guy 
gets $20 two times, you see, for not doing a damned thing. 
MR.

MR. REEVES: 
And I've been out there when it's 
been very quiet 
carp 
high mark and 
I'm sitting there quiet with my brother, sitting there 
waiting, and you hear them come in, like a breeze, a bunch 
of them, you see. 
MR. 
What's that? 
The birds? 
PAR. 
Several hundred of them. 
MR. 
At nighttime when they're flying. 
MR. 
: Is that right? 
Have you ever heard 
them, Jim? 
LIR. PEEVES: 
We got a 
today. 
That 
ought to do it, oughtn't it? 
MR. 
Well, we'll see if it will do it. 
:IR. 
Hey, that last time we was here, 
neither one of our recorders worked. 
MR. REEVES: 
(Unintelligible) . 
MR. 
Boy, that was awful. 
AIR. REEVES: 
You see, you have to watch what you 
say, if you've got that thing going. 
Do you have a way of 
cutting it out, don't you? 
What do you call that? 
MR. 
Get the CIA --
MR. REEVES: 
On TV every once in a while, 
somebody gets  
 and I hear them cut them off like 
that. 
How can they do it so damn quick, I wonder? 
3 
MR. 
We just use scissors. 
(Laughter.) 
P1R. REEVES: 
(Unintelligible) plenty nowadays, 
these machines do,  
 make a machine (unintelligible), 
does it instantly, before you even say it. 
I was going to 
tell you a story about  
 good to put it on 
talk. 
But you can cut it out, can't you? 
PAIR. 
Oh yeah, we can cut it anytime 
we want. 
MR. 
After everybody's listened to it. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. REEVES: 
Yeah, like some of these women, 
you're telling a joke a little on the risque side, and 
they'll say, "Ain't that awful?" 
(Unintelligible). 
(Laughter.) 
MR. 
Albert, what were you saying about 
when you started railbirding? 
I heard you say something 
about 75 years ago, you were railbirding? 
MR. REEVES: 
No, I said I helped tie them up 
for the gutters or for the guides, bring them up to their 
car, bring them up here, see? 
My place is as far as they 
got, and we kept 
times, right down there, right 
at the end of the street. 
MR. 
How did they have them cleaned? 
Who cleaned them for them? 
4 
FORM WERI 
DIR. REEVES: 
Oh, that's the thing. 
(Laughter.) 
Picking them, we called it. 
Of course, those 
high-class society people call it plucking. 
That is a 
nicer word, isn't it? 
Watch out, you'll get your tongue 
twisted up there. 
You've got to watch that, you know. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. 
What did you call it? 
MR. REEVES: 
They call it plucking. 
"Pick" 
doesn't sound so good, does it. 
MR. 
You called it pecking them? 
24R. 
REEVES: 
Pick, like picking out. 
But those 
women especially used to talk about plucking. 
They'd say, 
"Well, will you pluck my bird?" and I thought, "Well, I'll 
pluck your bird anytime." 
(Laughter.) 
No, we plucked them for them or picked them, and 
(unintelligible). 
That's $2.00 a dozen. 
MR. 
$2.00 a dozen. 
MR. REEVES: 
That's cheap enough. 
DIR. 
Yeah, that was real cheap, a lot 
of work. 
MR. REEVES: 
And I mean, we were good pickers. 
Of course, some were better than others, some were faster 
than others. 
I think my brother 
was the fastest. 
5 
I 
He wasn't only fast, but he was thorough, did a wonderful 
job. 
You sort of spit on your thumb. 
Spit does it better 
than anything else, like shining your shoes, you spit on 
them. 
You spit on your thumb, go like that, the thing goes 
down. 
The only thing that gets bad is when you get down 
around his asshole, his rectum. 
How does that sound on 
there? 
(Laughter.) 
You get down there, you've got to be careful. 
(Laughter.) 
It's all true stuff, you know? 
MR. 
Oh, yeah. 
MR. REEVES: 
And I think if you take it away from 
some of these stories, you really ruin them.

No, it's less than what he says, 
$2.00 a dozen. 
Is that what he said? 
$2.00 a dozen? 
MR. REEVES: 
Yeah.

MR. 
They charge a dime a bird down

How much? 
MR. 
A dime a bird, ten cents a bird. 
MR. 
Isn't that funny how the price 
won't go up, just like --
MR. REEVES: 
It may have been a dollar.

MR. REEVES: 
They said they hated to see the real 
bird season come in, you know, because they expected the 
chauffeLr to pick their birds for them. 
MR. 
Oh, for heaven's sake. 
MR. REEVES: 
Well, chauffeur's, to begin with, 
don't know how to pick birds. 
I was brought right up 
picking birds, from when I was just a kid, a little kid, 
picking birds. 
If my father caught us skinning one, which 
of course, you really had to do if it was shot too damn 
bad, if he caught us skinning good birds, we're apt to get 
skinned.

I haven't read much about that Pollack wedding or whatever 
it is. 
But I will. 
I read some of it. 
But actually, I 
looked at the real bird thing first. 
I'm a little bit mad 
at Peterson . I never knew him, because he didn't give 
this place here enough -- what's the word I want to use? 
=•1R.

MR. REEVES: 
That's it. 
That would be it. 
I've 
been trying to think of that the whole damn morning. 
Knew 
I had it somewhere. 
(Laughter.) 
We didn't need it though. 
Godalmighty, we've 
had so damn many people here and turned them away. 
But we 
didn't turn away the Campbell soup man. 
Fie said, "I'm the 
8 
Campbell soup man." 
Well, I said, "It don't make any 
difference to me if you're the Heinz soup man. 
We cannot 
take care of you today. 
That's all." 
They didn't like it, 
never called me any more. 
Darns (PHONETIC). 
He's the 
biggie, you know. 
MR. 
He is, right. 
Chairman of the 
board, I believe, for Campbell's. 
MR. REEVES: 
Yeah, he's a big duck. 
I had a 
fella here yesterday works for him, works in the plant, 
Cameron --
BAYONNE. 
MR. 
Cameron  
 
MR. REEVES: 
I wanted to go up there and see 
that museum, see all of those -- they got the -- from Spain, 
I think, the king and queen and all those jewels, the crown 
jewels and the royal thing there, free. 
Not necessarily 
because it's free, but I'd just like to see them, and the 
museums are there for everybody and it costs nothing to do 
it. 
Go there and pick up a crown or some jewels. 
I suppose 
they've got somebody watching there with a goddamn shotgun 
 
 and a grease  
 
(Laughter.) 
MR. 
Jim was just over there in Spain 
this summer. 
MR. REEVES: 
That's where they came from.

It's a beautiful country.

MR. 
Said they didn't have any rail 
birds to speak of. 
MR. REEVES: 
I never found a man yet that knows 
much about railbirding, anything hardly, when you get 
below Maryland. 
Who's the head railbird man here? 
Is that 
you? 
No, the other two go all over the country looking for 
them. 
I don't get anywhere. 
I don't get out of town.

you get so damn poor, you can't get out of town. 
(Laughter.) 
But I don't really think he wanted to though. 
MR. 
Jim's from Maryland. 
MR. REEVES: 
Some of these guys that I take out 
-- like Harry Green (PHONETIC), you probably met him here 
one time, he's from New Jersey, but he's got a farm down in 
Maryland. 
He's got plenty of geese and does some birding 
there, but he says they're better, and he's a damn good 
gunner. 
He's gunned here for years and years and years. 
He's the last man I ever took gunning, Harry Green, and I 
took him up Port Creek (PHONETIC) and got him his limit, 
25, a few years ago. 
He  
 me. 
I had retired. 
I had stopped  
 
MR. 
Right. 
I remember  
 
took him out. 
(Inaudible)? 
MR. REEVES: 
No, he's been here quite often.

MR. 
I said you were only pushing once 
in a while. 
MR. REEVES: 
Not at all, at that time. 
I hadn't 
I 
pushed for quite some time, and Mort was supposed to push 
i 
him. 
(Inaudible) terrible bad day and had the water all 
over everything, you could see a real bird a mile away, 
my God, just nothing but water, and I says, "You got here 
late." 
(Unintelligible) so damn bad. 
Said he was going to 
a wedding, his wife's family, was all set to go to the 
wedding, and by God, here come Morton and Harry with him. 
"By God, they're after me." 
And had that goddamn boat 
Johnny built. 
She's top-heavy and --
MR. 
Have you been down there? 
MR. 
Yeah. 
MR. REEVES: 
I don't know what he's doing now. 
He told me he's building four or five. 
MR. 
Yeah, on the same line. 
MR. REEVES: 
I know. 
11R. 
Johnny -- well, I know, but 
(unintelligible) those oldtimers, you couldn't beat them 
building a boat. 
By God, I'm telling you, built some of the 
greatest boats you've ever heard tell of them, and that's the 
one I had to use, the only one available. 
But I never went 
off. 
I stuck right there on deck, and we went up Fort 
Creek right up there and the tide 
was so damn 
11 
FORM WERL 
m 
and fog had been so damn big you'd think maybe it was a 
 
. When we went under part of the bridge, we 
called it Port Creek, we were under there. 
The tide had 
fallen, probably about six inches. 
It was like a terrible 
big storm tide, been wind to the east here three or four 
days, and it's storming like hell and raining. 
That we had 
to sort of get down this way to get under there. 
I said to Harry, I hear two shots up in there. 
Here's a couple of boys, you might say, with a damned old 
knack tow pushed around there. 
I thought, my God, they're 
getting birds, and they was getting some birds. 
And we got 
into them, plenty. And he's a dead-eye dick anyhow, Hi is. 
We weren't up there no time before we got over 25 birds, and 
the last time I (unintelligible). 
MR. PARSONS: 
Jimmy has got the high boat for the 
year. 
1R. REEVES: 
Yes, he has. 
MR. 
That isn't saying much today 
though. 
MR. REEVES: 
How many shells did you use? 
Or 
don't you want to tell? 
MR. 
Oh, he doesn't want to talk about 
that. 
?R. PEEVES: 
Well, we always said, what we always 
liked, what 
always liked, is a big tide, a small 
12 
man and a good shot. 
And a tipper, too. 
(Simultaneous discussion-- unintelligible.) 
God, that's awful. 
That's terrible, isn't it? 
MR. 
I guess it's worth it. 
I'm tired. 
That's a lot of work. 
MR. REEVES: 
Well, you done a lot of it yourself. 
But according to other things, well, $25 an hour, I guess 
they charge over here working on my outboard motor about 
$20 an hour. 
Of course, this is specialized work, pushing a 
boat. 
Once a while one of these guys will say, well, lets me 
hold that pole there and you get up here, let me get up (unin-
telligible)-pole stuck in the mud and pulling and pushing and 
pulling and having a hell of a time. 
Colonel Biddle used to come in here and (unin-
telligible). 
Not Mercer Biddle, but --

Nicholas. 
MR. PEEVES 
Yeah, Nicholas. 
He's something 
else. 
MR. 
He's a general. 
MR. REEVES: 
Oh, yeah, yeah. 
Armchair general, 
maybe the governor of Pennsylvania, maybe a general. 
But he 
has been in the service, I guess. 
But how about old Mercer 
Biddle? 
He was something else, wasn't he? 
MR. 
Oh, yeah. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. REEVES: 
I never found out really about that.

A-11 the old timers is gone. 
But I understood he was shot 
out. 
MR. 
I heard that, too.

Now, he used to gun a lot up there where you are.

middle of the Delaware River?

About the same. 
That's the worst railbirding season I've ever seen. 
And like 
I said, I remember 75 of them. 
I don't know if it was before 
that or not. 
MR. 
You're talking about Mercer. 
Remember you said something about a glass eye? 
Didn't you 
say he got that from France or something? 
MR. REEVES: 
Yeah, I told him how good it looks. 
I said, my God, that's a wonderful eye. 
By God, that was som 
eye. 
My God, he ought to be. 
I think he said he paid $800 
for it. 
And he says, t'ain't worth a damn, I can't see a 
damn thing out of it. 
He said he'd (unintelligible) times 
before he finally did, out there in his garage. 
Was he 
ever married? 
This was a long time ago.

Yeah, his wife is still living.

Well, he was a kind of sporting man, 
a dude. 
Smoking cigarettes and had emphasema the worst you 
ever heard tell of. 
And light one cigarette right back of 
the other and drink all the 
there was.

He liked his rum, didn't he? 
MR. REEVES: 
He was a good shot, too. 
My God, 
he had two eyes. 
Can't you see as good from one eye as you 
can with two? 
15 
MR. 
I had a friend who -- in my high 
school who had his eye put out and he was still quarterback 
for the high school football team. 
So he could see well 
enough to throw and everything. 
You can do it, but it seems 
like it would be awful --
MR. 
You have to compensate for it. 
MR. 
Yeah, right, you have to compensate 
A good friend of mine who's an English soccer player has 
played sub-professional soccer all his life with one eye. 
MR. 
Really? 
How about that.

I just read a bit about it. 
That's a, 
terribly rough game, isn't it? 
Is it rough as in football? 
MR. 
No. 
MR. REEVES: 
I don't like football.

Do they bounce it off their heads or 
am I imagining things? 
I>iR. 
No, you can bounce it off your 
head. 
MR. REEVES: 
No, I watch it on TV some. 
But 
football, I don't understand. 
I suppose that's the reason. 
But I'm just like that racer come over here. 
He took one 
of the big shots of the game with him. 
And he says, it 
looks like whoever can run the fastest or whoever is the 
strongest can win the game.

MR. 
Well, that's about what it 
amounts to, right. 
MR. REEVES: 
You just run into them and knock the 
hell out of them, you see. 
And what I don't like is they 
all pile on top of a man when they've got him down. 
They 
all have to get on him; it looks to me like they're just 
showing off or something. 
A man down on the ground with a 
whole bunch of people on top of him, it's a wonder to me they 
don't get hurt a damn sight worse than they do. 
I don't 
like that. 
I call that cruelty to animals.

I think it's all uncalled for.

We had a tennis court here in town years ago, just a

But baseball, 
I was afraid of the ball, and you never make a good ball

college wrestling, I don't see none of that damn stuff. 
I 
want to see them get in there and throw each other around. 
It really don't have nothing to do with wrestling. 
But I'm 
telling you, don't you think they can't wrestle, though. 
And I had the head man here that promoted the bouts for 
(unintelligible), known him for a long time. 
He said, 
Reeves, those guys couldn't be in business if they 
and begin to holler and raise hell with them. 
They're 
coming out there, Gorgeous George throwing roses all about 
to the women, coming out there with a big bunch of roses in 
his arms. 
And the damn Hindu gets out there and puts a rug 
down and goes through a ceremony and all that stuff. 
I go for all that show, see. 
They grab each 
other, they get hurt once in a while. 
They know how to 
jump on each other, because they know where to jump on you. 
(Unintelligible) throw you down and jumping on you. 
I do 
go for that stuff. 
He says, it's a show, yes, but it's not 
all show. 
He says, of course often they got cops up there 
18 
f 
0 
when they have these big matches. 
And he says, people want 
to get in there and get at them. 
Why, he says, they'd pick 
up an ordinary man and throw him clear out of the back door. 
Just like that. 
Why, of course he would. 
Let me at that 
bird, goddamn son of a bitch, let me at him. 
I'd like to 
get hold of him, the dirty stinking thing, he says. 
Look 
what he's doing, busting a chair over somebody's head and 
all this stuff, and run him head-on into a post. 
And the guy 
looks up and he's going along with him, have you ever watched 
that? 
Looks up, he's letting him take him. 
Ain't that funny? 
Seems so funny, don't it? 
You think he's all in. 
But when 
he bounces back, he grabs that guy and turns him upside down. 
I do love to watch it. 
,SIR. 
Albert, did anybody ever get hurt 
gunning out here? 
MR. REEVES: 
Not seriously. 
A cousin of mine did 
get shot pretty bad in the back. 
He got shot pretty bad. 
I had to take him down to the doctor's and get him to cut 
them out. 
They made lumps on him. 
He had several of them. 
I got stung once right in the middle of the lower 
lip. 
(Unintelligible) very fortunate, very fortunate. 
Because the number of gunners they've had here over a period 
of so many years, nobody ever did get hurt. 
'SIR. 
That guy today shot two loads 
all around him and not a single pellet hit him. 
I 
19 
MR. REEVES: 
That's right. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
,MR. REEVES: 
I thought I heard something go by 
that sounded like a whole bunch of bees. 
That might have been 
him. 
i 
ORM YIERI 
RAYONNE. 
YENGAD CO. 
(Simultaneous discussion-- unintelligible.) 
MR. REEVES: 
I'll tell you, though (unintelligible) 
I jumped overboard. 
 
 says, what in the hell you 
doing that for? 
I says, oh, it was either do that or get 
shot right through the middle of the gut. 
Looked to me like 
I was looking right down that gun barrel. 
They get excited, you know. 
Get excited as hell 
over a railbird. 
MR. 
That's probably why they put a 
seat in our skiffs down there. 
A gunner can't swing around 
if he's straddling that seat. 
P4P.. 
REEVES: 
Well, we tried all kinds of things 
in them boats to keep people from falling down. 
Of course, 
there was a man had a lot of trouble standing up to get him 
down before he does fall down and come over backwards and his 
gun go off and shoot your head off. 
But we tried to fasten things in our boats, somethinc 
Iyou could lean against going forward. 
I made say like an 
iron about a half inch, anyhow. 
And sort of made it flat 
and then down each of the sides of the boat. 
One in front and 
20 
PEYOAD •O. 
one in back, sort of steady. 
Didn't seem to work out too well. 
So we didn't bother too much with that. 
But a man that's 
having a lot of trouble standing up ought to sit down. 
Then 
he's at a disadvantage. 
You can shoot better standing, and 
also you can't shoot a bird as quick before he jumps up. 
Especially when you're in that high reed, when they get as 
high as this ceiling. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
(Simultaneous discussion -- unintelligible.) 
I 
I had a guy like that once, he 
went overboard four or five times, and about after the end of 
the fourth time he says, damn, if I'd known it was. going to 
be like this, I wouldn't have come. 
(Laughter.) 
I said, if I'd known it was going to be like this 
I wouldn't have brought you. 
MR. REEVES: 
Had some awful funny experiences here 
with the gunners. 
I'd kind of like to see nose glasses. 
I 
had a pair one time I wore just (inaudible) with a black silk 
cord to try to look like -- who was it, Tim Conley or some-
body. 
Had a little  
 in those days, and she said, 
come on and put those on, I put some papers around and looked 
kind of important. 
But it's a hell of a place to wear them 
out in the meadow. 
But this guy did, some doctor from 
Philly. 
And had a goddamn good gun, too, he did. 
And 
21 
he got through the tide, and whether he had his gun or not, 
I don't remember all that detail. 
When you get in around the shore there, usually 
there's a -- that's where the gnats are, along the edge. 
A 
lot of times you come ashore there are gnats and mosquitoes 
and things. 
So he's going this way, George said, and he lost 
his glasses. 
My God, he says, I lost my glasses, I don't 
know just when. 
Well, George, he says, I don't know just 
when you lost them, but I did notice along about halfway 
through the charge you began to shoot better. 
That's when 
he lost them. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. 
You were telling about an admiral, 
I don't remember whether he was a British admiral or an 
American admiral from the Philadelphia Navy Yard --
10 
'I 
MR. REEVES: 
(Unintelligible), sat right there. 
Admiral  
 sat right there, and I had a guy, an old 
timer, a guy who would take it him, didn't care whether he 
was an admiral or a king,the way he was talking to him. 
I 
heard him holler to him, good God, you couldn't hit a bull in 
the ass with a banjo. 
(Unintelligible) Bill, that was an 
admiral. 
I don't give a damn. 
Those rough old guys --
those old 
are tough. 
I didn't give a damn if he was 
a king, he says. 
But the admiral got a great kick out of it. 
I tried to apologize to him (inaudible). 
Well, he says, 
22 
Ba"),I E. 
I kind of got a kick out of. 
Says, I'm used to giving orders 
all the time, and I didn't mind taking them for once. Some-
thing different. 
I couldn't do a damn thing about it, he says. 
Couldn't do nothing about him. 
MR. 
What did your guides used to do 
when you had somebody come down that you knew wasn't a good 
shot? Which guides got the ones that couldn't shoot? 
MR. REEVES: 
I'm telling you, I was in the middle. 
Of course, my father did it before I got at it. 
ely father 
has been i n 
his grave for 40 years. 
Of course, after I was 
here and the rest of the boys I had had all pretty much 
married. 
And of course, I took over. 
And it kept getting 
bigger. 
After Pop died, more people all the time. 
Somebody 
told about Bob Burton,that guy will take Bob Burton down to 
"larshtown, pretty soon you've got so many damn people you 
can't handle them. 
And you ask what the guides think of them or what -- 
T4R. 
How did you allocate as to who got; 
the bad shooter? 
1
,118. 
REEVES: 
Well, that was kind of the technical 
part. 
That gets kind of tricky. 
See, the good pusher was 
the good gunner. 
I would put a new gunner, after he found 
out he couldn't gun very good I'd still try to put him with 
a poor pusher. 
But he's still want a good pusher. 
You hid 
a lot of goddamn complicated things. 
The pushers coming to 
23 
FORM WERI 
me, the pushers didn't like to  
 the gunners, either. 
I don't want to take that old son of a bitch, I don't want to 
take him. 
lie's a crabby old thing, I don't want to take him. 
And a gunner would come to me, hey, I want that guy. 
He's 
already been asked for by another guy, see. 
They knew these 
guides, some better than others. 
Of course, I shouldn't brag but I was considered 
one of the best. 
Of course,they can't nobody deny it because 
there's nobody near my age to talk about it. 
(Laughter.) 
(Inaudible.) 
But that's the way we boys did, 
though, four or five of us. 
Push boats and -- like I say, 
I come out of high school when I was about probably 16 years 
old, 15, 16. 
And Pop says, you're going to work when you do.' 
So that's when I pushed professionally for five bucks. 
Five 
bucks. 
Christ, I thought I was rich. 
Got a five dollar bill. 
PAIR. 
Well, how did you work out that 
kind of thing that Jim was asking about? 
That would be pretty 
awkward..I can imagine some of those people would get kind of, 
stuffy. 
MR. REEVES: 
Oh, they did. 
Oh, I expect they 
cussed me. 
I've been cussed so damn much I expect (inaudible) 
22 years I got a three-way cuss. 
(Unintelligible) of course, 
I don't know how I got off on this, but the cussing thing. 
And I thought I'd have a little fun with her. 
She was pretty 
24 
FORM WERI 
nice but I'd have a little fury with her. 
I got a three-way 
CUSS. 
You've heard tell of them. 
Is that some kind of a 
three way stretch brazziere or something? 
They do have them, 
don't they? 
Don't you know anything about brazzieres? 
(Laughter.) 
Evidently she did. 
(Inaudible) I got a little 
kick out of that. 
I said, the guy on that side of the bridge 
is cussing, he wants to get over. 
The guy here wants to get 
over there, and the guy that's coming down river is cussing 
me because I don't turn that bridge off. 
But when they blow 
that horn three times you're sipposed to turn the bridge off. 
Fie was bigger than a rowboat. 
These new boat owners especially are scared. 
But 
I knew whether to get under it or not, provided I knew how 
good a waterman they were. 
They had to do with it. 
Every-
thing has got something to do with it. 
You got to figure 
all out how well he can handle his boat and all that sort of 
thing. 
Because when we go under that bridge and there's 
a 16 feet clearance for the boat to go through, I mean, where 
the bridge closed overhead, you get underneath that, there's 
tie rods that go this way, too. 
But I watched them go through 
there and I knew by the size of the boat and by the height 
of the tide on the pier whether they get through or not. 
They'd be afraid to tackle it, especially new boat owners. 
25 
And they all thought they had the Queen Mary, 
and it wasn't as big as one or two of our bateaus down there. 
They were scared, for one thing, and (unintelligible) for 
another, and they didn't have long before they'd begin to 
build them up. 
They had superstructure; they had them higher 
than they were long. 
I threw my guts out in the bay in one of 
those damn boats. 
But they would be cussing me. 
You turn the bridge 
off, and they'd be cussing me on each side of the bridge. 
MR. 
Three way cuss, huh? 
MR. REEVES: 
Two cussing me because I turned it 
off and the fellow in the boat cussing me because I didn't 
turn it off. 
But I usually turned it off. 
MR. 
What do you mean, turn it off? 
MR. REEVES: 
Oh, --
(End of Side One.) 
MR. REEVES: 
About 12, 15 people every day. 
And 
I would be booked up from the beginning of the season on, 
that quick. 
Because some of these guys had been coming for 
several years. 
And they'd expect good times. 
Of course, 
was the only man I ever heard talk about the 
stars. 
He even used stars to go by the tides. 
(Unintelli-
gible) . 
MR. 
Too much of that rum. 
You say 
you'd have to figure out -- these pushers that worked for you 
26 
had jobs? 
MR. REEVES: 
That's right. 
MR. 
And ycu had to find their vacation 
time so you could.... 
MR. REEVES: 
Yeah. 
When that was, yeah. 
Course, 
they didn't all get their vacations at the same time, you 
know. 
Find when they had their vacation. 
That would give me 
a chance to hire an extra guy come along, see. 
MR. 
Ever happen -- have it happen that 
a pusher didn't show up or whatever, or a couple of them? 
What did you do then? 
MR. REEVES: 
I have one of the greatest customers 
come here. 
Nobody to push. 
I think I told you that before. 
And she is a biggie. 
Her man is and she is too, I guess. 
Sitting back there in her car like 
a hidden 
Mrs. 
Josephine Pugh 
people. 
My God, she walks in here 
-- got messed up somehow. 
The only time I ever got messed up 
with such a big shot as she was.... 
I got her cooled down 
pretty good. 
About that time my wife had been nipping a bit. 
And she got tired of it. 
I got her too damned bent cause I had her pretty 
well settled away, see. 
And she was pretty worked on that --
worked on that pretty good that she couldn't hardly -- she 
was infallible -- couldn't hardly be her. 
And -- Oh, Ms. 
Pugh. 
And I says, what. 
Don't have no guide for you. 
Oh, 
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) what. 
I say, I didn't know you was coming. 
27 
I'll just talk with you. 
Probably the night before. 
But she 
got me confused by saying that she had been gone or supposed 
to have gone that day down to the 
with Darrence, 
the Campbell Soup man. 
He'd invite her to gone down there. 
And get something about that. 
And I sort of got mixed up. 
Got her pretty well cooled down from what come at her. 
She says, I've been laying there listening to you. 
Said, I don't like the way he's doing. 
Said he's not talking 
up enough for himself. 
And I'd try to say something and she'd 
say, Oh, shut your mouth, she says to me. 
And Mr. Pugh would 
keep standing there looking; didn-"t say nothing. 
Shut your 
mouth, she said, you big fat  
 
Shut your mouth, she 
said, you big, fat dummy you. 
And all this sort of thing went on. 
I'd better not 
stir things up any more. 
(INAUDIBLE) that would keep quiet, 
I guess. 
So -- shut up. 
You ain't got enough gumption to take 
care of yourself. 
You going to stand up (INAUDIBLE). 
These 
people don't scare me because they got a barrel of money. 
Andi, 
all this stuff. 
And she didn't say nothing. 
Well, Albert, 
make another date. 
How about tomorrow? 
Yes ma'am. 
I'll 
take you out myself. 
I'll see that you get out there. 
I will 
take you out myself. 
M-y wife here hears what I am saying here. 
I'll mark it right down here. 
I will take you out tomorrow 
,myself; I will do that. 
I had never pushed it before. 
Took 
I 
I 
her out. 
She's a good shot. 
28 
She goes to pay me and I said, Ms. Pugh why don't 
FORM WERL 
you -- that awful mixup.... 
She said, let's don't talk 
any more about that. 
Let's just forget it. 
I swar I feel 
bad about it and I said, I could have been wrong; I could 
have got it mixed up a bit. 
Evidently somebody got mixed up. 
And I said, I don't want to charge you anything... that's on 
the house; I'll not charge you nothing. 
Well, she says, Mr. Reeves I guess you know I am a 
well-to-do woman. 
I said, yes, I heard that. 
And I guess 
you are a poor man. 
I said, you are so right. 
She says, you 
don't think I'd let you take me out there for nothing. 
I say 
I certainly didn't and that's the reason I did it. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Well, thanks for being truthful about it, she said. 
And another thing, I like your wife's spunk. 
Don't go up to 
the house and tell her. 
I sure liked her spunk. 
People don't 
talk up to us much and said she wasn't a damned bit afraid. 
Of course she'd had a little hooch there, you see. 
Given a 
little stimulus there. 
Said, I really enjoyed her spunk 
but 
don't go to the house and tell her. 
I never did; I never did 
tell her. 
But I had those kinds of things to happen. 
MR. 
Were some of the people that you had 
to deal with kind of snotty ever. 
I mean those people who 
are 
MR. REEVES: 
Oh yeah. 
Snobs. 
And they are one of 
29 
f'ORM 
WERL 
0 
0 
the worst type of people I think are snobs. 
And another 
fellow I had one time here weren't well-to-do people. 
Like 
I say, I got a few people (Unintelligible). 
I mean, he's got 
a pretty good job, I believe, with the government. 
MR. 
Oh, sure. 
MR. REEVES: 
And you got a good job with the Bell 
Telephone Company. 
MR. 
Public service. 
MR. REEVES: 
Public service and does he do anything 
at all, does he? 
MR. 
Real estate, are you Ken? 
MR. REEVES: 
Real estate. 
MR. 
Push. 
(Laughter) 
MR. 
Rich like you, huh 
(Laughter) 
MR. 
He's a pusher? 
(Laughter) 
MR. REEVES: 
Well, we had this guy called Whiz. 
Called Whiz, like an automobile part or something years ago, 
in Camden. 
Hollingshea•d. 
Oh he -- boy, he was something else 
He'd met a chick here in town down at the race track. 
He'd 
met her. 
And she said, If you are ever down to Morristown, 
come down and see me. 
She was a nice woman but she didn't 
work at it too good. 
(Laughter) 
And she was rather attractive. 
So, soon after that he'd met her. 
He called me and says, I 
30 
want to come down to your place -- wanted to see her, for 
FORM WERE 
BAYONNE. N.J. 
one thing. 
Just the main thing. 
You'll find out about that 
in a minute. 
He said I want to come down and go for birds. 
Said, some of my friends come down. 
I want to come down there,. 
So when he come here. 
In fact, he was quite a geeser 
And 
he says, Do you know Mrs. Owls (PHONETIC) here in town? 
Oh, 
yes I do. 
Yes, indeed -- not -- around the corner; not too fa 
Oh, very lovely. 
Wonderful. 
And he says, I met her 
down at the race track and she was talking to me about the 
birding. 
She didn't go but she knew about it. 
And I told her 
I must come down and try it sometimes. 
So he got talking 
with her and got acquainted with her -- acquaintence, I guess 
he didn't know her before until he met her at the race track. 
He was the kind of guy to get acquainted with and so was she. 
So they should make out well together. 
So he said, you know Mrs. Owl -- yes, indeed. 
How 
about I give her a call. 
I got some time; I tried to get here 
early -- I try to get them here early enough, you know. 
The 
only thing is if you get them here too early they want you to 
go out there about half-high water and you wear yourself out 
before the tide gets here. 
You can do more in the half an 
hour at the regular time than you can in three hours at the 
wrong time. 
MR. 
(INAUDIBLE) 
MR. REEVES: 
I'd get off. 
You see, I'd get off. 
31 
I'd get off on one thing and go up on another thing. 
Had to 
FORM WERL 
get back here 
. I had to give her a call. 
Go ahead, 
help yourself. 
Said, You're gone quite some time? 
And these 
guys down here getting a little uneasy and I'd get uneasy too. 
They sort of look to me to do everything, see. 
So she's got a big fancy convertible. 
She drives 
up and he's all spread-eagle on the back seat. 
He isn't 
seat --setting with her. 
Got the top down and he's sitting 
there all sprawled out like this. 
I think he's got two or 
three British tip drinks down him. 
And he's lying back there. 
And I am standing out front looking for him, walks around 
there. 
He's sprawled out on the back seat there -- her and 
her big fancy convertible. 
And her in her Ehort shorts. 
And 
he says, Reeves, says, I got to thinking it over since I got 
to talking with Harriet .... It was Harriet by that time; when 
he left it was Mrs. Owls, but when he come back it was Harriet 
So he says, I've decided, Reeves, I won't go gunning. 
Harriet is going to drive me around the countri side and --
lovely country, he says. 
Of course I thought so. 
Going to 
drive me around the bay and we may go down to Cape May and 
(Unintelligible). 
I says, It's not that easy, Mr. Hollingshea 
There's a man standing righ there waiting to take you out. 
Oh, he says, why I can take care of that. 
[chat do 
they get, Mr. Reeves. 
Ten dollars. 
Okay. 
And I don't think 
I can see everything I want to see in one day -- he stayed for 
32 
two days. 
Says, Here, where's your man there. 
Too bad I 
wasn't signed up for him, but I didn't do ... I could work 
but I didn't do it. 
Here you are $20. 
The guy 
gets $20 two times, you see, for not doing a damned thing. 
MR. 
Right.

P: 
Uh huh. 
AR: Because some of these guys had been coming there for several 
years. And they would expect good tides. Of course, Ruland Beeger 
was the only man I ever heard talk about the stars, he even used 
the stars to go by the tide. He used the stars, too. I think he's 
seen stars too many times!

So these pushers that worked for you, they had jobs?

That's right.

And you had to find their vacation times so you could ...

her to gun down there. 
And got something about that, and 
sort of got mixed up. 
But got her pretty well cooled down, and my wife came out 
harm. 
Sh? says, 
'"I 
haen there laying down 
fist ning to you. 
I"don'+ like the way he's doing." 
What 
I'm Joing? 
She said, "He's not talking up enough for himself." 
And I tried to say something. "Oh, shut your mouth," she says 
to me. 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR: 
And Ms. Pugh, she's standing there looking and she was 
saying, "Shut your mouth, you big fat dummy you" and all 
this 
sort of thing. 
Well, I thought I better not stir things up any 
more. 
The more you stir the shit the more 
it stinks. 
So I 
figure I better keep quiet,I guess. 
So she says, "Shut up, 
you 
ain't got enough gumption to take care of yourself, you're goin 
to stand up for what's right." 
And these people don't scare me 
because they got a barrel of money, and all 
this stuff. 
She didn't say nothing. 
Well, Albert, I'll make 
you another date. 
Yes, ma'am, come back tomorrow and 
I take you out myself. 
I'll 
see that you get out there and 
I will take you out myself. 
My wife, she hears what I'm saying 
here and marks it right down there, I'll 
take you out tomorrow 
myself, I will do that, I don't break my word. 
I took- her out and she's a good shot. 
She goes 
to pay me and I s.ay, Mrs. Pugh, what about that awful mixup, 
She says, oh no, 
let's not talk any more about that, 
let's 
just forget about it. I said I sort of feel bad about it, 
and I said, I could have been wrong, I could have gotten 
mixed up, but evidently somebody got mixed up, and I said I 
didn't want to charge her anything. 
It was on the house, 
I'm not charging you nothing. 
Well, she says, Mr. Reeves, she says, I guess 
you know I'm a well-to-do woman, and, yes, I heard that, and 
I guess you're a poor man, and I said you are so right, and 
she says you don't think that I'd 
let you take me out there 
do you, for nothing? 
9 
And I said I
I
,acertainly didn't, and that's the 
reason I —t 
it. 
Ha ha. 
Well, thanks for being truthful 
about it, 
she said, and she said another thing -- I like 
your wife's spunk. 
Don't go 
in that house and tell her 
but 
I liked her spunk. 
People don't talk up to us much, because 
they're usually too damn afraid. 
But she wasn't. 
But you see, she had a little nip, you see, to give 
her a little nerve. 
But she said she liked her spunk and for 
me not to go and tell. 
And I never did, I never did tell 
her. 
But those kinds of things happened. 
GP: 
Well, 'were some of the people that you had to deal with kind 
of snotty ever? 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 42 
0. 
AR: 
Oh yeah, snobs. 
And they're one of worst types of people, I 
think, the snobs. 
And then another fellow at one time I had here, 
some well 
to do people, and like I said, 
like these people ought 
to kill me, and he says no, he's got a pretty good job with the 
government and you got a good job with the Bell Telephone Company. 
GP: 
Public service. 
AR: Public service? 
And what he --
GP: 
Real estate. 
AR: 
Real estate, push. 
GP: 
Push. 
Ha ha. 
Look like you, eh? 
AR: 
He a pusher? 
GP: 
A pusher, now. 
AR: 
Well, we had this guy named, Whiz, we called him Whiz like an 
automobile pilot years ago, or something, 
in Hollingshead. 
Boy, he 
was something else. 
He met a chick here 
in town down at the race track down 
in 
Atlantic City, he had met her, and she said 
if you re ever 
down 
in Moorestown, come around and see me. 
She was a married woman, but she didn't work at 
it too good, and she was rather attractive -- and so 
soon after he had met her, he called me and said I want to 
come down to your place, and well, I want to see her for 
one thing, I guess the main thing. 
You'll find out what 
happened in a minute. 
He said I want to come down and go for birds. 
So 
of my friends had gone down there and they liked it. 
So 
when he come here, he was quite a geefer, and he says, do 
you know Mrs. Allis here 
in town? 
Well, yes, I do, yes, 
indeed. 
She just lives down the corner not too far. 
Oh, 
well, wonderful. 
And he says he met her down at the 
race track. 
And she was talking to him about the birding, 
she didn't go but she knew about it. 
And I told her let's 
go down and try 
it some time. 
So he got to talking with her and got acquainted 
with her, and she said an acquaintance told me -- I guess 
he didn't know before until 
he met her at the racetrack. 
He was kind of an easy guy to get acquainted with and so was 
she. 
So I figure they make out well together. 
So he 
asks, do you know Mrs. Allis? 
Oh yes, 
indeed. 
I ought to 
give her a call. I got some time, I tried to get him earlier 
enough, you know, only 
if you get them too early, you go 
out and get a half high water, and the waiters go out before 
the tide gets here. You can do more 
in a half an hour at 
the right time than you can 
in three hours at the wrong 
time. 
GP: 
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. 
AR: 
I get off, you see, I get off one thing and go off on another 
thing. 
Back to this other. I him to give her a call. 
Go ahead, 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 43 
help yourself. 
So he's gone quite some time, and he's standing 
here and getting a little uneasy, and I get uneasy, too. 
And he 
sort of 
looks to me do everything, you see. 
So she got a big fancy convertible 
And so she drives up and he's all 
spread eagle on 
the back seat and he's sitting on the seat with her, got the 
top down, and he's sitting there all spread out like this, 
I think she's got two or three pretty stiff drinks down him 
and he's laying 
back there, and I'm standing out front looking 
for him, and he walks around there. 
And he's sprawled out on the back seat there, 
on this big fancy convertible, and her 
in her short shorts. 
And he says Reeves, he says, I got to thinking it over, since 
I got with Harriet, 
and 
it was Harriet at that time, when he left 
it was Mrs. Allis, but when he come back 
it was Harriet. 
So he says, I've decided Reeves, that I won't 
go gunning. Harriet is going to drive me around the countryside 
and 
it's 
lovely country he says, and of course 
I thought 
so, 
and she's going to drive me down the bay and go along 
to Cape May and all 
that stuff. 
I says, 
it's not, that easy, Mr. Hollingshead. 
There 
is a man standing right out there waiting to pick you out. 
Oh, he says, why, he says, I'll take care of that what do the 
get? Mr. Reeves, ten dollars Okay. 
And I don't think I 
can see everything I want to see 
in one day 
And he came for two days. 
Says here, where 
is 
your man there? 
Too bad I wouldn't sign up for it 
but 
I wasn't working then, I didn't do 
it. 
Here you are, twenty 
dollars. 
The guy gets twenty dollars, too tired, you see, 
for not doing a damn thing. 
GP 
Right. 
AR: 
Now he had a good time going around the countryside with his 
Harriet, and he had a good time. 
I think he took that twenty 
dollars and went up and hit a booze place, and got himself some 
drinks. 
Ha ha. 
But little things like that happened, you know? 
GP: Yeah. 
How did you work out the finances with the gunners? 
Did they pay you? 
AR: 
Yeah, they paid me. The guys paid me a buck for getting them 
a job. 
GP: They paid you a dollar? 
AR: 
They paid me a dollar. 
GP: Did the gunners, did they pay you or did they pay the pusher 
directly? 
AR: 
They paid the pusher directly. 
GP: 
I see, then the pusher paid you. 
AR: 
I didn't want them to pay me because they think I might be 
holding a tip back on them or something. 
You pay and wherever 
you're going to pay, you pay your guide. 
Then the guy gives me a 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 44 
buck. 
GP: 
All 
right. 
AR: And I did pretty good on that. Ten people, why, you can get 
yourself another ten dollar bill. And I pushed myself, too. 
I was 
always the 
last one out.And I will 
say one thing about these 
fellas that pushed for me. 
They sort of kept that piece and made 
it from me, that little piece of metal just above the Spring 
Garden Boatworks. 
GP: 
Oh yeah. 
AR: 
Right around the boatworks. 
GP: 
The first turn there 
AR: 
We called that the Legion Meadow, 
because the American Legion bought them big houses up there 
at one time called the Wallenbaka Farm. 
In fact, the guy 
that bought it 
later had a store there years ago. 
And 
they called it American Legion Meadow. 
And they sort of kept 
it for me, and I had to move right there 
in Spring Garden. 
And I wasn't long getting -- I pushed the same 
man for 20 years, that guy, Dolan from Philadelphia. 
And I see him walking back and forth now on my 
way 
in to see, I see him walking back, he reminds me of that 
fellow that walks out on television, who 
is 
he, 
they have 
a thing going up there and he walks in and gets 
in 
it. 
GP: Alfred  Hitchcock? 
AR: 
Hitchcock, yeah. 
He had a belly like Hitchcock and I'd see 
him walking back and forth and back and forth. 
He was right in 
back of him. 
Sherver was more scared than Dolan was. 
That 
Sherver, my God, what I worked that man, Jesus Christ. I'm the 
last one getting there. 
Where the hell have you been, Reeves? 
Oh, 
all 
right Gale. 
Gale, called him Gale, Gale Golden. 
I say 
all 
right Gale, there are birds up there, and we'll get our birds. 
And 
he was a damn good shot, too, a damn good shot. 
He didn't give me all his birds, he'd take two or three 
GP: 
He died, though. 
AR: 
When he died he 
left seven million dollars and didn't leave 
me a goddam thing. 
GP: 
Well, you got all 
of his birds for nothing. 
AR: 
Well, he did, but I could use some 
cash. 
His father got 
about 10 or 11 million and he spent it on whores and gunning, 
spent all 
his money on whores and gunning. 
I keep forget that 
thing 
is going--you'll have 
to edit this, what is 
it, bleeps they 
call 
it? 
They bleep 
things. 
I saw something ten minutes ago, 
they cut it out, and say quick, and you can't even tell what the 
hell 
they're going to say. 
But he was walking back and forth there. 
I see 
him on my way 
in there, you know. 
And I'm -- time to go. 
Where 
in 
the hell have you been, Reeves? 
Oh never mind, 
Gale, now you know you're getting yourself all shook up. 
Why, that Walter said something like that to him -- he 
wouldn't think of saying anything like that to him, he sure 
scared the hell 
out of him. 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 45 
He handed him the pads, the long things to put 
on his feet one day, a little bit damp, sometimes he was 
real 
low rubber, 
like the 
low kind 
GP: 
Sneakers, galoshes? 
AR: 
No, 
not galoshes, 
like a little rubbers but the real 
low 
kind, the real 
low kind of rubbers. 
GP: 
Oh yeah, the real 
low kind. 
AR: Just so he wouldn't get his feet damp or something, a little 
bit wet. 
He had all 
kind of stuff with him. 
Evidently he handed 
him the wrong thing, this Sherver did. 
Why 
in the hell don't you 
pay attention to what you're doing? 
Your mind is somewhere else, 
keep your mind on your work? 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR: He was talking, and he'd say yes sir, 
yes sir, Mr. Jones. He was scared to death. He was over 
here one time, he was on his way down to Atlantic City 
and he stopped 
in 
to see me 
in the summer. 
And he had his chauffeur with him and his house man 
and I know what they do -- a butler or whatever they call 
them. 
And his scout says, like a hen 
in the rain, did you 
ever watch a hen in the rain? 
I said watch them when there' 
a heavy rain, the hens. 
Instead of going in, 
they stay right 
there with their neck right in the air like that, with water 
running down her back, water running down. 
They stand like a hen in the rain -- that's the 
reason I use that term. 
And they were standing there, and he 
always liked to tell me, 
he 
liked to hear dirty jokes. 
And I'd try to have one for him and he'd generally have 
one for me, so we would exchange jokes the minute he'd get 
out of the car. 
They got out, too. 
His house man made me laugh more than his chauffeur because I've 
seen Walter several times, the houseman, there, and he 
looked like 
an undertaker. He didn't crack a smile, he had his hat on right 
straight. 
I suppose he didn't dare put it on an angle, or Gale 
would get after him. 
Everything was very proper. 
Exactly right. 
But he didn't crack a smile, and he told these jokes. 
Oh, Reeves, what do you say we take a walk down 
the river. 
We'd take a walk down and take a look at the river 
We take a walk down and take a look at the river 
so on the way down and look. 
So on the way down I say, 
Gale, I say those jokes, I guess they didn't, they didn't 
seem to think much of them, did they? 
Oh, 
he says, they 
wouldn't take no part in anything I'm saying. 
He's standing 
there and talking to me, 
he says they wouldn't, he was 
just blank, they didn't show no interest. 
Or not supposed to 
And he says they wouldn't do nothing. 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 46 
It was a hell 
of a thing, they didn't even laugh. 
He says oh, he says, they wouldn't do nothing like that. 
GP: Do you have a lot of women good shot you got a lot of women 
come here? 
AR: 
Oh yeah. 
GP: 
Are they mostly from the wealthy families or what? 
AR: 
Oh yeah, yep. 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR: 
But it's sort of hard to figure them out because -- doctors 
are especially bad about that. They'd have another doctor's wife 
with them, they wouldn't have their own wife, they'd have another 
doctor's wife. 
So there was a lot of that, and I couldn't tell 
who's who or I couldn't tell what was going on. But that was none 
of my business. 
GP: 
Right. 
AR: That part of 
it. 
I had a hell 
of a job one night trying to 
explain, this one fella comes here and he was pretty old, and he 
had this young woman with him. 
And she could have been his nurse 
and she could have been his secretary, but anyway, she had to be 
with him. 
But she didn't gun, she stayed here and she looked 
after him. 
So he went gunning the next day, too. 
So he wanted 
a cabin. 
Well, the funny part of 
it was that the woman who 
runs the cabin, she wasn't married to her man, either, so 
that's the funny thing. 
And she knew I knew it. 
So I 
take 
them over there at the end of the road to the cabin, and it 
was a good enough cabin, not too fancy, just around the 
corner there. 
It's still there, too, I guess. 
GP: 
Over near Baileys? 
AR: 
Yeah, just above Baileys there. 
Call The Toy Pines. 
It was 
nice and clean, nothing fancy at all but it didn't make any 
difference. 
And I said, Mrs. Allis, this man 
is going to stay 
till 
tomorrow and gun, going to stay, or wants to gun tomorrow and 
he wants a plane to stay. 
Well, she says, well, now just what kind of a place would you like 
to have? Now here's the tricky part. I get 
in 
on all 
of that, see. 
She says, because I've taken people there before and I knew what 
to expect. She didn't give a damn what, she just had that, see. 
GP: She wanted that money. 
AR: 
Yeah. 
She says, well, what do you want? 
Did you want two cabins? Oh no, don't want two cabins. Well, then, 
would you want a cabin with, say, with two single beds 
in 
it or 
one bed, what would you 
like? 
Well, he says, no. 
He says, 
I'll 
tell 
you what I'd like. 
He 
says I do have to have her near me because I might have some 
of spell 
in the middle of the night, and I know what kind of 
spell he had! 
But he says, I have to have her right near 
me. 
Well, she says, I got just what you want. 
I got 
like, two bedrooms there right next to each other in one 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 47 
cabin, and communicating rooms. 
So whether they communicate 
at night, I don't know. 
Open the door and come 
in, see. 
Probably they only used the one room after all. 
But he say 
he had to have her close to him because he might have a spell 
See. 
And she's standing there grinning at me, the woman 
is saying she knows damn well what spell he's talking about 
and she could damn well care less. 
GP: 
Tell me what kind of guys did you have pushing for you back 
in the old days? 
What sort of other jobs did they do? 
AR: 
Oh, just worked for the county and worked up 
in 
the old 
factories. 
And the youngest guy, one of the shepherd boys, 
I'd go 
get him out of high school and his teacher would let him out. 
GP: Alan Shepherd? 
AR: 
Alan? 
I never got him out of high school, but he worked at 
the prison farms over here as a guard, and I could get one type 
better than I could another because they were shift workers, see, 
and I had to get all 
that figured out, as to what shift they were 
on and all 
that stuff. 
And then Harvey, he was an uncle I think to Alan and he worked for 
the county And I 
don't know if 
he was a salaried man at the time 
or not. But I got him when he was young. See, these guys went out 
with the older people, the family, 
it was somebody else, just for 
the fun of 
it and they learned to push at an early age. 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR: 
They were good and they knew it. 
Well, he worked for the 
county a little bit 
and they were guards and they worked 
in the 
factories, the glass factory and different places, and they worked 
all 
around. 
I'd keep track of where they were working, and when 
they were working, and also I had to keep them straightened up at 
night time, 
in case they got too much booze. 
GP: Were any of them watermen? Did they fish or 
... 
AR: 
Oh yeah, they'd fish and they went on the oyster boats, they 
did different things. 
A lot of them didn't have what you'd call a 
steady job. 
They just figured, well, they'd work this job and 
when that plays out they jump on another one. 
But they were 
workers, most of them. 
They were ambitious, they were -- most of 
them, practically all 
of them I'd say. 
We had one or two that were off the beam a bit in the head, but he 
had put his strength 
in his arms. 
GP: 
Albert, what were you saying something about the male birds 
would turn on a frog, or something? 
AR: 
Oh yeah, I didn't make that up. 
That's an old one, that was 
from way back, that is. 
GP: Yeah, I heard a story like 
AR: 
I said to this Dr. Norris I had down there, your god damn 
bird landed right there out on open water, right there on the 
open, with no grass around. 
And just about where he went down, a 
little spot, I was watching for him to come up, and we went and 
grabbed him right quick and knocked him out with a police ball, 
right in 
the head. 
And right where that bird went down come a frog. 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 48 
I says, Doc, do you know what happened to that rail bird? 
No, he says. 
I say, he turned into a frog. 
I say, do you 
believe it, and he says yes. 
Ha ha. 
Because he had read 
that article, that way back 
in ancient times, those old 
elves there, some of them thought that birds turned into 
different things. 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR: 
Well, a beautiful butterfly was nothing but a worm, wasn't he 
at one time? 
Wasn't he? 
He was like a worm, and when he comes 
out of that thing, and he's 
in 
there, you know, 
in the cocoon. And 
he turns into a beautiful butterfly, doesn't it? 
GP: 
Right. 
AR: So why can't a real 
bird turn into 
a frog? But I expect what 
happened was really, right where 
that bird went down, this little 
frog might have scared him see, and he jumped out of the water. 
GP: 
Yeah. 
AR: And the bird never did come up, 
he got a hold of something 
down there and hung on. 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR: 
But Dr. Norris, 
in fact, he wrote a book about eastern upland 
gunning, but he did devote one chapter to the birding here on the 
river. 
GP: 
Oh, really? 
AR: 
Yeah. 
I lent somebody that book and never got it back. 
If 
you got a good book, don't let nobody have 
it. 
GP: 
Yeah. 
What was his first name? 
AR: 
Charles C. Norris. 
He was dead and gone for years. 
GP: Mrs. Dulla read a book called # "Life Along the Delaware", 
and she said the next door neigh 
was the doctor. 
Never brought 
it back, and the whole cover was ruined on the thing. 
AR: 
He did it on Easter 
GP: 
And she gave 
it to me personally, you know? 
She signed it as 
a gift. 
AR: Eastern upland gunning or eastern upland shooting, 
it's the 
same thing. 
GP: Did you ever do any woodcock shooting down here? 
AR: 
Yeah, but I didn't -- I didn't go 
in for that, but they had 
some of the best woodcock shooting here, but they are going to ruin 
it. 
These big sand companies are cutting all 
the woods down and 
digging it up. 
And they're 
going to ruin 
it right down here that 
is 
the headquarters for the woodcock, dig it up and there are no 
woods there no more. 
GP: 
Didn't they used to shoot spong here or something? 
AR: Spong? 
Well, Bob had a route, where 
there was a lot of 
spong. 
You don't know what a spong 
is 
do you, these fellows? Do 
you fellas know what a spong is? They got more than one kind. 
Like a wet place that 
drains like, you know, and a little 
spot, wet, where the water stays there. 
GP: 
Oh, I saw a lot of them today. 
AR: Oh, did you 
spong? 
Bob says be careful of the spong. 
That 
man 
is walking along with a gun and he's looking for it, 
you know 
and 
it might throw him or something on a soft spot. 
Brother Bob 
says be careful of that spong. 
He says, where is 
it, 
he says, 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 49 
where 
is he? 
Ha ha. Right there, there he 
is. 
GP: 
What were some of the kinds of birds that they gun here 
besides rail 
birds? 
AR: 
Oh, 
they gun quail. 
Good quail and 
pheasant, too. 
GP: Pheasant? 
Around here? 
AR: 
Oh yeah, yeah. 
And some grouse, not a whole lot, but some. 
GP: 
Oh come on, really? 
AR: 
Oh yes indeed, right over in those woods there. 
Yeah. 
You 
get a few grouse. 
I've seen now and then one sitting on a log, 
beating his wings. 
I was trying to -- he was putting on a show 
for a female, see, that's what that is. 
Now do you believe that? 
I believe it. 
GP: 
Oh, yeah, right. 
AR: 
You're not as keen on that frog story, though, are ya? 
GP: 
Nah. 
AR: 
Not so keen on the frog business. 
GP: 
I like the frog one. How late 
in the year do you kill 
rail 
birds? 
AR: We always claimed we never did much after Columbus landed, and 
when was that, 
in 
1492, wasn't it? October the 12th or the 14th? 
I'm forgetting my dates here, I need to go bark to school. 
GP: But it didn't have anything to 
do with the frost, the first 
frost? 
AR: Oh yeah, that didn't help any. They don't hang around long 
after that 
GP: Right. 
AR: 
We have killed them way along 
in October now and then 
You 
get a big tide, and these birds what's left of them, there are 
thick places out there, you know, you got enough of that. 
GP: 
Yeah, right. 
AR: 
I'm talking to this guide because I 
know him a long time and 
I know he knows about gunning a 
lot, and they go 
into these 
thick places 
GP: 
Thick places? 
AR: 
Yeah, 
like cat tails. 
Thick. 
I mean 
you can't even get a 
boat in there unless you get a hell 
of a big tide to break through 
that cat tail. 
That's how they get. 
And one of these big tides 
are coming along late 
in the season, and they're still 
in there, 
you get some. You bust in and get some. 
GP: 
I remember a few years ago we got some 
in Weatherbee, just 
like you said. 
When you get an extra high tide, you can bust 
right in and get them. 
AR: Right. One year my brother Mort, 
it was 
in the early part of 
November, 
it may have been the fifth, took Governor Walter Edge 
out there when he was the governor of New Jersey, and I think got 
him his limit. 
GP In November? 
AR: 
In November, the early part of November. 
GP: Yeah, dad talks about it a couple 
of times having real good 
rail 
bird shooting that late. 
AR: 
Right. 
Do you have birds over in England? 
GP: 
No, not 
in Maryland.

I just pick them off of the marsh. 
AR: I tell 
you, 
I've killed with a pole fork now, I didn't decide 
to, 
but I hit close to him, they're tame kind of birds, especially 
when they first come here. They're a very tame kind of bird. 
I had been gunning them in Canada, though the first place I hear 
tell 
them gunning them was up on the Connecticut River. 
GP: 
You're right, right. 
AR: 
They'd get 
them there. 
GP: 
The Housatonic River, right.

you hear about rail 
bird shooting 
you know? 
MR. OWINGS: 
Well, they shoot them down 
in Louisiana some. 
AR: 
Yeah, I would 
think 
in the woods. 
Yeah, 
in fart one guy 
told me one time, he heard about them being down 
in South America. 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel

t even need to shoot them. 
They don't do 
it any more, 
ike they do 
it on the Connecticut 
then you get down here to south 
rginia and that's it. 
That's all 
that I know of. 
Where else do 
page 51 
GP: 
Yeah, they do to South America. 
AR: 
You can't get good books on 
it 
good books. 
GP: 
I think there's probably 
some 
information on them. 
AR: 
I showed you how they ain't writing about rail birds. 
GP: 
Well, we'll see. 
AR: 
That Polack Whitting had a book, I started reading that, 
some of i 
t 
. I read some of i 
t 
. 
GP: 
That's Lithuanian. 
AR: Yeah, but that's sort of 
like Polack or Russians, 
isn't it? 
GP: 
Well, they're not too happy about the Russian part. 
AR: Well, you know, I have an old fella that comes here, an old 
priest, and he got so damn old he can't go out any more. And he's 
Ukranian, and then there are Lithuanians and Ukranians. And 
anyway, he's Ukranian, he's a priest, and they build their own 
coffins. He built a nice one, too, and I don't know when he's 
going to get 
in 
it. I said, God I don't want to get in that thing 
But they build their own coffins, and 
it's a funny shape, sort 
of 
like on an angle that way, and they come 
in a bit. They 
build them. There's a bunch of these people out there. They come 
and do a lot of fishing here. 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR: 
But he's a nice old geezer. 
And he's still 
living, he's 
about 90. 
He entertained that big Russian when he come over here 
-- who was that big guy 
over there 
in the church? 
He's the head 
man that sort of looks after him, some big man from Russia was 
here, a religious m from Russia, who was he? 
GP: 
I don't know. 
AR: 
Two years ago? 
Oh, he's a biggie, he a big one. 
And I don't 
know if 
they ran him out of Russia or 
what they done, but this 
fellow sort of 
looked after him 
while he was here. 
But he was 
quite a guy, this Constantinov. 
Yeah, that was his name, 
Constantinov. 
He was quite a guy. 
I mean, he's a religious man, 
he's kind of a priest but different from a Roman Catholic priest, 
sort of different somehow. 
But there was one thing I liked about 
him 
and I guess a lot of the priests are that way. 
They're not 
as strict about things, 
like drinking and things like that like 
the Protestant people are. 
But anyhow, this guy used to come down here and bring my wife 
cigarettes -- a nice old fella, he'd bring he a carton of 
cigarettes, and bring me a bottle of whiskey. And he was a man of 
the church, a priest. 
So I kind of 
liked that part of religion, I 
liked that part of 
it 
in him, anyway. 
Ha ha. 
I had my car up there, my tires were being re-alined, and I had a 
beautiful car there, my God, 
it was a beautiful thing, a Lincoln 
Continental. 
I said to this fellow, where's the car, and God 
knows he must be a fish 
eater because he was Italian and he got 
that shiny black hair, you know, kind of a young guy,and I figured 
he's one. 
And here's how he talked about it. 
I said, by God that's a 
beautiful 
thing, I said that must belong to a politician, don't 
it? 
A big beautiful car like that? 
Well, he says, I guess you 
can say so, he says 
it belongs to the priest. How do you like 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 52 
that,? 
And here 
I am comparing him with a politician. 
GP: 
Alfred, did you take out a pregnant woman one time? 
AR: 
Oh yeah. 
GP: 
I heard some kind of story about you taking out a pregnant 
woman once. 
AR: 
Oh yeah, well, that was all 
-- I don't know if she qot one 
duck or not, but ... 
GP: 
Duck? 
AR: 
Oh, she was going for ducks. 
GP: 
Oh? 
AR: Oh yeah, we went for ducks.

PLEASE NOTE: 
IN THIS TRANSCRIPTION, THE UNIDENTIFIED 
SPEAKER, "MR" 
IS FRANK AMSTEMBORSKI. 
AR: 
So I had 
it out myself some time ago(?)--and was just in 
the process of powdering her nose and 
had her mirror up there, 
and -- did ya hear this story before? 
GP: 
No, 
no. 
AR: But he says she was looking in the mirror, had this hand 
mirror there, she was looking 
in there, and about that time a 
bunch of people went by about an hour later and she said she went 
and picked up that gun and she went bam, bam, and got one with 
each shot. 
She just took that mirror and put it 
in back of her and just put 
that gun back over her shoulder and killed the duck with each shell 
Well, I said I'll 
take her. 
Ha ha. 
GP Right. 
AR: I had one, she was just a very ordinary shot, I'd say, 
an 
Italian woman, but I didn't know that she's 
pregnant, would you 
have thought that? 
MR. 
No 
Nope. 
AR: I didn't know about that. 
GP: 
Albert, when people came here 
in 
th old days, 
it was kind of 
hard to get down here 
wasn't it? 
AR: 
That's right. 
GP: 
I mean, you're kind of out of the way. 
AR: 
We had passenger service out here about a mile here. 
GP: 
What kind of passenger service? 
AR: 
Railroad 
GP: 
Oh? 
AR: 
And they got them. 
We had a nice 
big station down there 
and you got the train down in Philadelphia. 
GP How long a train ride was 
it? 
AR: How long a train ride? 
GP: Uh huh. 
AR: I don't know how fast they went in 
those days. 
GP: 
I don't know, either. 
AR: 
Not too damn fast. 
GP: 
Probably took them a couple of hours three hours I bet. 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 54 
AR: 
Well, they could make their schedule you know, to be there, 
and I had a guy here from town go out and get them -- 
in what was 
called a hack. 
Something like an old surrey with the fringe on 
top. 
And they'd go out there like with this little bus and pick 
them up and bring them in here. 
GP: Horse drawn? 
AR: 
Yeah, at first. 
I'm going way back. 
And they had a hotel 
here, you know, we had a license. 
You didn't have to go halfway 
to Noble to get a drink. 
You'd right there on the corner, we had 
a nice big hotel here. 
GP: 
So you say you used to keep a few boats on the porch? 
AR: Yep, there was a big high porch, and they had like a hatch, a 
big section of 
it would open up and slide the boats under there. 
And the guy right down at the end of that street there on that 
side built those boats, and I mean real 
boats, built those boats, 
and furnished the lumber for $25 apiece. That's something. That's 
the truth. 
GP: 
But the people who would come down they would stay 
in that 
hotel, 
is 
that right? 
AR: 
They'd stay there. 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR: And once 
in awhile, one would come here on the yacht and 
they'd stay for like two or three weeks. They'd stay pretty much 
the whole season; they wouldn't gun every day, but they'd stay 
aboard their boats. 
GP: 
Do the Deckers ever come here and shoot? 
The Deckers from 
Black and Decker? 
AR: 
No, we didn't have Black and Decker, we didn't have them 
here, no. 
GP: 
Because they used to come up on the Patuxent in their yacht, 
and I was wondering 
if 
they ever came up here on their yacht. 
AR: 
No. 
GP: 
What was the name of -- you told me the 
last time I was down 
here, someone from Trapp, Maryland that used to come and gun here 
a Iot? 
AR. 
I ... 
GP: 
Jim's family has a family here 
in town. 
AR: Oh, that's Green -- Howard Green, yeah 
GP: 
Right. 
AR: He was here once this year and got two birds. He got two 
birds. Funny he didn't come down and see me. He didn't. Johnny 
said he wasn't too pleased when he 
left, so I guess he just went 
on. 
GP: How about that fella from New York? Bridgeport? Has he been 
here this year? 
AR: 
No, 
and he told me he don't think he will, the way he sounds 
He called me up and talked about it. 
GP: 
Why? 
AR: 
Well, I told him the way 
it was, that it wasn't very 
encouraging. 
I said it's been bad. 
GP: 
But I thought he liked to come here though. 
AR: Oh, 
he does -- he goes somewhere all 
the time. Well, then he 
says I've already been invited out there, and I just may settle on 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 55 
that in Wyoming and gun where the animals play. Gun antelope 
Yeah. 
And they're good to eat, he said, they're better then 
venison. And so he may do that, he's going to try and do both. But 
he 
likes to kill them late because he wants to get a little ducking 
in 
on the tail 
end of 
it, 
too. 
GP 
Yeah, 
last year I ran 
into him. He was talking about that. 
AR: 
Oh yeah, he just loves to gun, that guy does. 
GP: 
He stays here? Who pushes him? 
AR: 
Morton took him. 
MR. 
Morton took him for years. 
AR: 
No, I never took him at all 
myself. 
GP: 
That's your brother, Morton? 
AR: Yeah, that died about seven years ago. 
GP: I think Bradford was taking him a lot, too, right? 
AR: 
Bradford took him out some. 
GP: 
He always tried to get me to push for years, remember? 
AR: 
Yeah. 
GP: 
He'd bug the hell 
out of me. 
AR: 
Well, he figured you went out there that you'd be a good one. 
MR. 
Yeah, but he didn't realize that I was just going for the 
pleasure, I didn't want to push some 
AR: 
How did you do that, you could have gotten the $50 a day, 
couldn't you have used that money? 
MR. 
Oh yeah, I could use it, 
but I want to do some shooting, 
too, 
instead of just pushing. 
GP: 
So what happened to the rail 
bird business back there 
in 
Prohibition, Albert? 
It sounds like there 
is a real close 
connection between the booze and the birds here. 
AR: Oh God, there was never no shortage of booze around here. Because 
they had what you called speakeasies, and you would go buy 
booze everywhere. So that didn't really interfere with 
it at all, 
because they got their booze. 
People that wanted it could get 
it. 
You could get most any damn thing you wanted if 
you got the money 
enough. 
And they got their booze, they got enough booze. 
In 
fact, they got too much of 
it, 
some of them. 
Uh huh. 
GP : Did you ever have any trouble with game wardens or with 
anybody that ever broke the 
law or anything? 
AR: 
Oh God, yes, plenty, a lot. 
Plenty. But we tried to 
look out 
for them. 
You know, after all 
--
GP: 
I was curious about that end of 
it. 
AR: 
After all, you've got to have some kind of regulation. 
But 
the argument would be they'd come so many times and wouldn't get 
their limit. 
Because the 
law don't figure like that, see. 
GP: 
Yeah. 
AR: 
They wouldn't listen to that for five minutes. 
But I saw 
nothing wrong with that, because I know they'd come here and 
they'd only get like a half a dozen. 
GP: 
Right. 
AR: 
If you get a chance to kill 35 or 40 birds, 
let them have 
them. They don't figure like that though, because they probaby 
wouldn't use them all. 
If you kill 40, you'd say well, I got a 
half dozen yesterday. 
I killed 40 the day before and you tell 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 56 
them that you only killed a half dozen. So that's the reason you 
couldn't have that kind of a law, I guess, because it wouldn't 
work. 
GP: 
Was 
it just the one hotel here? 
AR: 
That's it. 
GP: 
And that's where all 
of the rail birders stayed? 
AR: 
Well, no -- a few of the families took them in, 
two or three, 
that had big homes. 
GP: 
Uh huh, and then a few stayed on yachts, too, eh? 
AR: 
Yeah, uh huh. 
GP: 
Would they ever sort of get here at at one time, was there 
ever like any parties between them all? 
Was there any sort of 
social 
life with them? 
AR: 
Well, they had parties here. 
I had seen so damn many rum 
bottles on the table that I didn't have room to set my glass on, 
hardly. 
This 
is when they come in. 
Not before they go out, 
though, they don't take no rum out there, that's not good --
liquor and gunpowder, you know mixed up, 
no good. 
But they'd have 
it and they'd bring it 
in here when they'd come 
in; 
and they'd see each other, a lot of these people that hadn't 
seen each other since the year before when they was here, well, 
they'd see each other here. 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR: And they'd have kind of a get together here. 
GP: 
Right. 
AR: But they'd travel all 
around a lot and they'd settle all 
this 
stuff here and they'd drink all 
the time. One guy had a Methodist 
preacher with him, and they're supposed to be awful strict on this 
drinking thing, so they heard me say he was a preacher, so they 
didn't offer any to him. 
And he came with a bunch of drinkers. 
Anyhow, he came from a pretty big church up there 
in East Orange, 
New Jersey. 
And he was supposed to have a pretty big church up 
there. These little churches are real puritanical, they think if 
you take a drink of rum you going to hell. You could have all 
the 
women you wanted and all 
the men you wanted, but no rum! 
They 
figured that rum was the devil, they were real strict on that. 
GP: 
Yeah? 
AR: Anyhow, this preacher is standing here drinking and having a 
good time, I think -- and the preacher says to me, Reeves, he 
says, how about me? Well, he thought that I had a bottle. I didn't 
have any bottle. 
I told him I wasn't going to drink mine while I 
got theirs. 
So he says, how about me, Reeves, I wouldn't mind 
having a snort. It's sort of a toxin, which 
it 
is, 
but he says he 
wouldn't mind having a little nip. So I turn around and see one of 
these guys standing back there an I say the Reverend 
so and so 
would like to have a drink. They tell 
him to help himself, right? 
Help himself. 
Oh sure. Pour him a half tumbler. By God, that 
won't be 
enough. So he takes the drink and he has another one, 
and then another one. 
Then I say, have another one? 
No, that's 
fine, he says. 
I feel better already. 
Yeah, 
it's fine he says. 
And that's a Methodist preacher, and he had all 
that and never 
batted an eye. 
So I figured that was not his first drink 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 57 
GP: 
But did you have a feeling that people came here every year 
and hunted every year and then met other people who were coming 
in 
and maybe got friendly with them. 
Were their friendships that 
started from people coming from different directions and then 
meeting here? 
AR: I think some of them did, yes. 
But a lot of them knew each 
other, maybe they belonged 
to the racquet club here, and there 
was a high class joint 
there 
in Philly. And then there was 
another one there 
called, let's see, there was the racquet club 
and, I don't 
remember the name of the other one, but it was a 
very high class club for all 
rich people, I guess. I know I 
stopped there once at the Bellevue Stratford, because he hung 
there, a man by the name of Block who was a big, I guess he 
controlled the stock 
in the Soteberg store. He gunned every year. 
I stopped there to see him to 
inquire about this British 
battleship that was over here. 
And I wanted to take him up a pair of ducks 
and dammit, they 
left. 
He was quite a geezer, and I didn't get up there 
in time to 
see him. 
But he was quite a guy. He was all 
dolled up, 
he had enough 
gold braids on to 
lay on that table. But he had society 
people there all 
the time they 
like to entertain people like that 
you know. 
And they were really putting on the dog heavy. I 
thought to myself, I'm going to take him out. 
And he wouldn't 
have to pay nothing. Big shots don't have to pay, but 
if they have 
it, 
they'll pay. That's the way it works 
don't it? 
GP: That's the way 
it works. 
AR: Well, this man came from Reading, Pennsylvania, a Blackwood 
Cameron, he had wool mills up there 
in Pennsylvania, and he 
gunned here a lot and him and Dolan 
were great friends, knew each 
other. I said I got nothing 
off of Dolan, but I did get this 
here fancy gun from a high 
class store there in Philadelphia, 
Jacobs Reed and Sons on Chestnut Street, and 
it was a high class 
thing. But I 
don't wear a white gun coat much, sure as hell. But 
it was a beautiful thing, 
it was a high class coat like a silk 
poplin or something and he says, here you are, Reeves, take this 
and wear it out 
in the mud if you want to, 
it's too big for me 
anyhow. And I'll bring you down a few things, some galoshes and a 
pair of overhalls (sic)that had the crotch cut out of them, but 
anyway they were good underwear, English underwear. 
And I used to 
wear them to go ducking down on the Susquehanna flats. 
We used to 
do a lot of gunning there at one time. 
And he said I had to 
fight to get this underwear for you, he says, 
like a niece or 
something or like a cousin would be to him, young Hoppe's nephew 
and he went to her husband and said he might want to go gunning 
sometime. 
He's a big doctor and couldn't afford to buy no 
underwear. 
GP 
Uh huh 
AR: I want that for my guide 
he says, that was Mr. Gale's nephew. 
He said I want that 
he said he 
was a formidable old devil, and 
he can use 
it. And they damn 
near ruined it fighting over this 
underwear 
He actually had to hold one 
leg and me the other 
But

in the crotch anyhow, he pinched himself a lot 
I guess, and 
it was running up, see. 
But I finally got the underwear 
and made use of 
it. Well, this 
coat was with it, 
this coat was in there he hadn't worn that much. 
That was -- man 
that was a high class coat. So this guy is here 
from Reading 
you know, he went out quite often 
just about his 
size. 
We called him Blackie. Blackie, I says 
I said I got 
something for you. Very seldom can a poor man give a rich man 
something. 
I said, one reason why I'm giving it to you 
is because I can't 
wear it. So I said I knew it would just 
about fit you, and I 
think I know what you're talking about. You're talking about Yale 
Dalton's white gunning coat, aren't you? That's what I'm talking 
about. 
So I hang 
in there and put it on, and leave it on, 
he says 
I'm going to 
it wear it out today. 
And 
it fit him to a tee. 
And he says, you know something, Reeves? He says, I really 
appreciate this 
Now, he says 
you don't think because a fellow 
has got some money that he doesn't have things given to him once 
in awhile. He says people 
with money even like to have things 
given to them, too 
The same as 
poor people do. 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR 
He says they really get neglected, some of these well 
to do 
people really get neglected; people won't give us nothing because 
they think got plenty. Too damn bad he's neglected, I thought, 
if 
he's neglected then what in the hell am I? Ha ha! 
But they all 
did go years ago 
GP: 
Most of the people came down from Philadelphia, 
is that where 
they came from? 
AR: Most of them from Philly, yeah And a few from New York, 
Atlantic City. I had a fellow named Winston from Atlantic City, 
and I pushed him when he was a kid, and now he's a grandfather. 
GP Is that right? 
AR: Yeah, he'd been out once, and he got two. 
GP: Two, eh? Strawbridge, you used to take Strawbridge out, too, 
didn't you? 
AR: 
That's right, Mr. Strawbridge, and 
Mrs. Strawbridge, they 
both came. 
He was quite a guy, 
Wayland Strawbridge. 
And she was 
nice. 
I did take her,, I didn't take him but I got a good pusher 
for him. But he found fault with him. 
He come in here and bring 
me a bottle of whiskey and sat here and had two or three drink 
with me and he said I didn't like the way that pusher was talking. 
He'd get into a tight spot and he said he didn't cuss so much, 
but he had such nasty dirty talk -- on of these young guys, you 
know? 
GP: 
Yeah, right. 
AR: 
He'd get 
in a tight spot and he said he did all 
kind of talk, 
just everything, everything you could think of. 
He said, I didn't 
like that, Reeves, I did like that kind of talk too much. And not 
the cussing so much, but this other kind of talk. 
He said I just 
-- we'd get in a tight spot and he would start in again. 
He was a 
good pusher, a damn good pusher, but he says the next time he 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 59 
comes down, Reeves, see 
if you can't find me another pusher. 
GP: When you say a guy 
is a good pusher what do you mean actually? 
AR: 
Try to get the boat going. 
That means a good marker, too. 
Now you get the two together, 
a. 
good marker and a good pusher, you 
got it made. 
Sometimes you have a real 
good pusher, but he can't 
mark so good 
GP: 
Uh uh. 
AR: 
Then some guy could mark better, but 
couldn't cover as much 
territory, couldn't get around as fast. 
But you get the two 
together is what you got to do to get what you call a top pusher. 
And that's like everything else, of course. 
We push most every 
day when the season would start, 
so we got so we knew how to push 
a boat. 
GP: 
Wasn't there a trick you used to do or something, Albert, 
you'd be 
looking for a bird or something and you'd push the boat 
on top of the bird or something? 
AR: 
That's it. 
We did do that. 
GP: 
Did you get a rest out of 
it or something? 
AR: 
We went on top of that bird on purpose to get your wind. 
Once you get going, you want to keep going, they want to get those 
birds, you know, and all 
this thing. 
So 
it was getting up near a 
high tide, because like pop always said, 
if you don't get them 
while it's coming 
in 
you sure as hell ain't going to get them when 
it goes out. Because the birds are going to be gone. 
GP: 
So what did you say to him? 
AR: 
I say you can't find that damn bird. 
Oh, I knew where the 
bird was. Then he sees the head pushing up, 
and he says oh God, 
how about that? 
That bird is running the boat there. 
Keep on 
going. 
And I don't think they got hep to 
it, 
either. 
GP: 
What else did you do 
like that? 
AR: Well, hunt for a dead bird. Well, 
you can't push the boat up 
right up to them lots of times, right up to the bird. You come to 
kind of a fixed spot, and you know you're getting close to 
it and 
you get out of the boat. 
We don't mind getting wet anyhow, pretty 
much. 
GP: 
Cool 
it off. 
AR: You go 
into a bunch of high reeds, 
you stand there and you 
get your wind. And he says, Reeves 
what the hell 
are you doing 
anyhow? 
I can't find that bird. 
Well, 
let's 
let 
it go, while 
you're hunting for that bird there he says, and here 
is the bird 
there, sitting there, but dead you know -- and he says, well, the 
bird ain't jumping up 
and down or nothing. Oh,there he 
is, 
there 
he goes. 
GP: 
All 
these tricks. 
AR: 
All 
those little tricks get you out of that, you get out of 
it, 
and that's all 
there 
is 
to 
it. 
GP: What about thrashing your pole in--
AR: Well, I don't know if 
that does 
a lot of good. I've been 
banging poles and beating and whatnot and I don't know if 
that 
does any good. They're not too scary. I mean, 
it helps some I 
guess, but that'll sort of wear you out, though, beating the thing 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 60 
with the pole. 
GP: Yeah, I bet it would take energy. 
AR: You go all 
the way out there you see, about 13 feet out there, 
and you be banging and I don't think it's too scary. I mean, I may 
have killed one or two with 
a pole before, or tried to kill them. 
But I don't want to 
get them that way -- you want to shoot them. 
So I said I killed that bird accidentally, I didn't try to kill 
that 
bird. But they're not scared, you know that? 
GP: 
Right. 
AR: 
Oh, they're not a bit scary -- just like these things that 
turn them loose, they're like chickens. 
You ask, what the hell 
did they come from? 
I never had many good source except I had the 
federal game warden here at one time and he says that's the way 
they breed up 
in Canada. 
We save them once a year, around the 
first of September, have a few cool nights, and 
in fact 
we picked 
up a couple around the middle of August this year. 
GP: 
The 7th of August. 
AR: 
Yeah, 
is that when it was? 
MR. 
Didn't you pick up another once since 
that time? Or 
something. 
AR: 
You know what I picked up at 4 o'clock in the morning? 
We 
used to see plenty of rail birds going from here over to Spring 
Garden, and going to check to see 
if she's all 
right,and then come 
back home again and go over there early 
in the morning. 
I'd pick 
up between here and Spring Garden, that's not too far away, up 
past Monumescin Bridge, I'd pink up 
like six or eight rail birds. 
Some of them sitting there along side the road groggy and they hit 
the wires. 
Of course there's not near so many wires nowadays, but 
the main thing of 
it 
is there a not near so many birds. 
GP: Uh huh. 
I remember you said once you'd always know when a 
flight came in 
lots of times, right? 
AP,: 
Sure. 
GP: 
You'd ride up the road 
in 
the morning and you'd see all 
these 
dead birds along the road. 
You'd know a big flight came in that 
night. 
AR: 
That's right. 
But you only saw them once a year, on their 
way, 
like when they go back or 
if 
the go back. 
GP: 
I hadn't thought about that - you never found them under the 
wires 
in the spring, never found any? 
AR: 
No, you 
don't see them around until the latter part of 
August, usually, before you begin to pick them up. 
GP: 
So I guess they totally skip this area when they go back. 
AR. 
They may fly over the midwest or may 
fly over the 
ocean, maybe. 
AR: They fly up the west coast, they must. 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
AR. 
I don't think so. 
Just like the geese, when they come down, 
they come back 
in the spring. 
AR: 
Oh, 
the geese come back. 
MR. 
In the spring they don't, not up our way. 
AR: Well, they come by here, I always see them in the spring. 
That's a sign of winter coming. I don't like to see them go down, 
but I like to see them come back because then you know that spring 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 61 
is just around the corner. 
You see the geese coming back every 
year, got plenty of them coming back, plenty. 
GP: 
Down our way, the geese on the Potomac all 
get up at once and 
they go 
like 
in one day. You see them all of a sudden, when 
they're ready to fly they just go. 
AR: 
Is that right? 
GP: 
I've seen thousands of them in downtown Washington. 
When they 
go to move, they go. 
MR. 
: It must be some sight. 
AR: 
One thing about those rail birds, the don't fly far before 
they'll settle, especially when they first get here. 
And 
especially when they get some fat on. They don't fly too far. 
But 
when they get ready, they can go. 
GP: 
Yeah. 
AR: And you notice toward the end of the season, they make a hell 
of a long flight. 
See 
if 
you ever go 
in and settle, they get a 
chance to go up 
and freak him out again, and they get ready for 
the 
long 
flight, see. 
GP: 
The big move, right. 
AR: 
The greatest story I ever heard about 
bird being a long way 
from home -- a guy came 
in gunning and he said his father was on a 
ship coming from England,it was 400 miles, he says, out at sea 
from the New York harbor and the bird hit the deck and fell down 
and hit the riggings of the superstructure, and fell down on deck 
and the people were all 
gathering around and saying, what kind of 
a bird is that? 
And his father looked at 
it and said 
it was a 
rail 
bird, 400 miles out to sea. 
Now he was heading for the 
Azors, probably, wasn't he? 
GP: 
So maybe they do have rail birding over there, 
in Portugal 
MR. 
Maybe so. 
GP: Listen, you know, we better think about going. 
MR. 
Right, we got a long haul ahead of us here. 
GP: 
Yeah, we better. 
AR: 
Well, of course they told me about the rail birds crying --
did I tell 
you that the other day? 
GP: 
What do you mean, crying? 
AR: Crying, literally crying. I thought 
I told you that the 
other day Now I got a little bottle 
of 
liquor there, I didn't 
even touch 
it, 
see, I thought I'd 
bring me out a sample. 
But 
crying, sitting there and 
vegetating, dying, I guess, and 
teardrops were running 
right down his face, just like a person. 
And that old rail 
bird was actually crying. 
GP: 
You saw that happen once? 
AR: I saw it happen, yeah, not too many 
times, but enough times 
GP: 
You mean like a crippled bird laying there 
in the ground? 
AR: That's right, and he was crying. 
What the hell else would 
it 
be, these big drops coming down 
on 
its face, but crying. 
Don't you think that? 
Now I believe 
that. 
GP: 
Made you feel bad? 
AR: Yes, 
it did. So I hit him over the head right quick and put 
him out of 
its misery. 
Oh, I guess 
if I had gunned birds much 
longer, I expect I'd get so I wouldn't want to kill a bird. Like 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 62 
the people who likes to put things on the bone, these people that 
catch a goddam muskrat or something. 
Who was this guy, Burt Mann, 
he's real fanatic. 
Oh, you guys have heard his name. 
GP: Oh, I know who you mean. 
AR: A great bird man, he writes books 
on birds, and 
is 
big on 
birds. 
GP: 
Peterson? 
AR: 
No, not Peterson. 
MR. 
Armery, or something like that? 
GP: 
Cleveland Amory. 
That's him. 
AR: No, no. Cleveland Amory, I've heard him talk. 
No, 
it's not 
him. 
Oh gee, 
got it right on the tip of my tongue and I can't 
think of 
it. 
He's well known, for years, this guy. 
GP: 
A fellow by the name of Joseph Woods Crutch writes a lot of 
nature things like that. 
AR: 
No, not him. 
GP: 
Are you thinking about Audubon? 
AR: 
Yes, I think you hit it. 
Audubon, he created the Audubon 
Society. 
GP: 
Right. 
AR: 
He didn't want you to kill 
a. 
damn starling, even. 
GP: 
But Audubon, he was a hunter though, wasn't he? 
AR: 
Yeah, at one time. 
But he had a change of heart. 
Like I 
just said, 4
1,bird. 
•I 
gun 
long enough, I might get so where I won't want 
to ki I 
I a 
 
GP: How long did he gun? 
AR: Well, 
it must have been 50 years. 
GP: How long do you think he might have had to gun before he might 
have got to the point where he didn't want to do 
it any more? 
(LAUGHTER) Maybe another 50? 
AR: 
It seems so bad, but he seemed like a nice kind of a bird, 
tame and not a bit scary. 
GP: 
And they're good eating. 
AR: They are. 
GP: 
Well, you gotta eat something. Maybe you can eat the rail 
bird and give the chicken a break. 
MR. 
That's how I look at 
it, 
right? 
AR: Well, who the hell wants to kill a nice little pig who never 
hurt nobody? 
Who wants to kill a nice chicken? 
GP: 
Yeah, that's true. 
AR: 
Well, I did raise a few chickens at 
one time and every one 
of 
them died of 
old age. I couldn't 
kill a pet chicken. When I 
was a kid, I raised a few chickens, and every chicken had 
its 
own name. And to go 
out there and kill a chicken? 
It would seem 
like being a cannibal. 
Now a guy near me raised a few rabbits, 
and they had them as pets. 
And he'd go out there and kill one of 
those goddam things and eat 
it. 
GP: 
I wouldn't do that. 
AR: Now I couldn't hardly do that. 
GP: 
I couldn't kill anything I raised. 
AR: 
I never eat rabbit anyhow, 
it would seem to me like eating a 
cat 
GP: 
Yeah. 
Yeah, that's what they look 
like when you skin 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 63 
them. 
AR: 
But they say they're good. 
GP: 
I remember my mother wouldn't eat that for that reason, she 
said the rabbit looked just like a skinned cat. 
But she'd eat 
everything else, but no rabbits. 
AR: A lot of people won't eat muskrats, you know, a lot of people 
won't touch a muskrat. 
And my God, they're wonderful. 
MR. 
Have you ever eaten muskrat? 
GP: 
Oh yeah. 
AR: 
I was raised on them. 
MR. 
I haven't had one 
in a long time. 
GP: Do you 
like them, Frank? 
MR. 
Yeah, I'd eaten them a long time ago, but I haven't eaten 
muskrat in I guess 25 years. 
GP: 
Well, 
in Salem, they have a muskrat bake over there. 
That's 
a big bake thing over there. 
AR: Oh, they have a big time over there. 
MR. 
I never attended it, 
but I was 
supposed to go one 
time. 
AR: Oh, they have big doings' over there and they make grapes 
out of 
it over there 
in Salem. 
That's great muskrat country over 
the re 
GP: 
Yeah, 
it sure 
it, 
it's 
like somewhere like Louisiana, you can 
get some big rats down there. 
AR: 
Oh, that's right. 
GP: You don't have a lot of rats on these marshes, do you? 
AR: 
Oh yeah, we have quite 
a few. 
GP: 
Oh, you do? 
MR. 
Yeah, we do. 
AR: 
Yeah, they do pretty good here. 
GP: You know where Ken was pushing me backup there today, there 
were just --
AR: 
What part of the meadow did you guys gun 
in today? 
GP: 
We got just above the bridge, Albert. 
AR: 
Oh, 
you were down on this end. 
GP 
It's called the Mudhole, 
it's that 
low spot in there, you 
know? 
AR: 
Oh yeah, I know that. 
There 
is that one story house there, 
that big flat house that's up there. 
GP: 
Yeah, 
it was up near the house. Right. 
AR: Use this side of the house? 
GP 
This side of the house, yeah. 
AR: 
Oh, then you were pretty close to town then. 
GP: 
Yeah, there were a lot of muskrat houses up there. 
AR: 
Oh, there are a few, I know where you were. When you go out 
into the ditch, you will 
see a sunken old ... 
GP: 
I didn't see 
it today, but I know there is one up there, 
right. 
AR: 
Yeah. 
GP: 
No, we didn't get up that far, no 
I know what you're talking 
about. 
AR: 
The oyster boat. 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 64 
GP: 
That's pretty close to the bridge; we was up there a little 
bit farther than that 
AR: 
Oh, farther than that. 
I know about where you were, yeah. 
GP: 
Maybe about an eighth of a mile out. 
AR: 
I been up there. 
I remember I thought it was a car. 
Shepherd. 
GP: Oh, you're talking about Alan Shepherd standing there? 
AR: 
Yeah, see, and I heard two of these 
guys talking about how 
he was there. 
MR. 
You know, that must have been today. 
Did you hear 
shots up by the Do alier up river? 
GP: Uh huh, yeah. 
4-Q '
f  - 
MR. 
I heard shooting up that way, but 
I thought it was 
you. I said that damn Jimmy 
is up there shooting away. 
And he's 
still shooting. 
And then I looked and 
seen you at Campies. 
AR: 
Campie will go up there when he 
gets things right. 
But 
you go up there and by the time 
you get back to the river, the 
tide has fallen--Way up 
in the head of Port Crik. 
Way up there. 
GP: 
Yeah, that's a big one. 
AR: 
You been up there, have you? 
GP I never gunned there, no 
AR: 
That's where I go. 
Every time we gun up 
in there with Harry 
Greene that's where we gun. 
And we got a limit, by God, we got a 
big tide and got so much. 
GP: That's a nice big meadow up 
in there 
AR: 
It's quite a ways up there 
too. 
GP: 
It's up the marshes 
isn't it? 
MR. 
Just above Campies -- 
it goes off to the right. 
GP: 
To the right? 
MR. 
Yeah, just passed Campies a little 
ways, and the 
creek 
is called Port Cartin, just way up there 
like 
in the woods. 
There 
is a big marsh up 
in there 
GP: 
Uh huh. 
MR. 
And it's a good marsh to catch. 
AR: They got a pretty high meadow up there. 
MR. 
You got the woods all there and 
if you get into a storm, you 
just can't get out of 
it. 
AR: 
No when I talk about a high meadow, I talk about the bottom 
mostly, see. 
MR. 
Yeah 
AR: But when you get a high meadow and a high reed on, you have 
some -- usually there the reeds don get too high though. 
Boy, I 
bet it must have been wonderful at 
one time, with the low reeds 
and the big tides. 
Oh man, 
it would be easy pickings. 
GP: 
Right. 
AR: My God, 
it's nice up 
in there. 
MR. 
I had an experience about three times down here where I came 
out later 
in the season and the boutalier, you know how the 
boutalier goes down? 
AR: 
Yeah. 
MR. 
That meadow that's always thin 
in there; that damn 
grass 
is just laying t here and there are 
jumping birds all over 
the place. They have to come running 
out and hide. You won't see 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 65 
them though. 
it's all high water 
I mean, shooting like crazy. 
And you don't even see them. All 
of a sudden they come out and 
take off. The place is just loaded with them. And you wouldn't see 
them until you 
flushed them. 
GP: I had one run out under the 
boat today. 
MR. 
Oh, did you? 
GP: One, yeah. 
MR. 
Yeah? 
GP: 
Came right out from under the boat. 
MR. 
Did you get him? 
GP: 
Sure did. 
When the tide falls, they know it. 
AR: 
You got it, they know it. 
They know it. 
GP: 
I wonder why they don't jump when the tide starts to fall. 
AR: 
They know it's falling. 
GP: 
But I wonder what difference it makes to them, though. 
AR: 
It makes a difference because the 
stuff that they're running 
around on, they begin to feel 
it 
firming up. They begin to feel 
it under them. 
That's 
what I figure, they know it 
instantly. 
Now here 
is where 
the frog and the rail birds are related again 
GP: 
Yeah? 
AR: 
Because the little frogs start peeping when it's frog time --
when 
is frog time? 
MR. 
In the fall. 
AR: I mean, frogs know when the tide starts 
to fall, and 
they'll start chirping and making noise. Frogs 
will. 
AR: So you see, there is a connection 
there between the frogs and 
the rail birds. 
MR. 
The other frogs are letting the rail 
birds know that 
the tide is falling. And they warn the--
GP: The other connection there between 
frogs and rail birds was 
that 
in September when all of a sudden the rail birds appear, 
then the frogs disappear. 
AR: 
Is that right? 
GP: Right. It's 
in September when the 
frogs all disappear and 
the rail birds come. And that's why 
they figure the frogs have 
turned into rail birds. 
AR: Well, I didn't know how to explain 
it. 
All I know is we buy 
a lot of net from New York and 
Philadelphia from these big net 
companies, and they send us 
a little pamphlet once in awhile, 
called Gold Metaling , and that was the best brand of netting 
GP: 
Gold Medal? 
AR: Gold Medal, right. There's this 
little pamphlet they put out, 
and that's all 
in 
that article 
about these old timers thinking 
that these goddam rail 
birds would turn into bullfrogs, 
into 
frogs. 
GP: 
I think 
it 
is 
an old belief. 
MR. 
Yeah. 
GP: 
I didn't have 
it myself. 
AR: Well you know, I was sitting here and having a couple of 
drinks the other day, too many drinks, and the captain of one of 
the Wheaton Jet came over here, he came 
in and--(CUT)

PLEASE NOTE: ON THIS TRANSCRIPTION, UNID = UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER 
GP: This 
is Gerald Parsons with the Library of Congress American 
Folklife Center, recording rail hunting in the Maurice River near 
Port Elizabeth, New Jersey on the evening of October 2, 
1984. 
We 
begin by 
interviewing Mr. Kenneth Camp at his home. He has a number 
of railbird skiffs that we are examining. 
GP: They have a number of waterproof cameras that Nikon makes, 
but it's very restrictive. 
KC: One of the guys the other day, he 
took his camera 
out. 
When he wasn't using it, he had a -- 
it was like a plastic 
bag that sealed, and 
it would float. 
GP: Yeah, I've seen those. 
They're kind of 
like those Zip-loc 
sandwich bags. 
KC: Yeah, that's what he had. 
GP: But somebody did go over in one of your boats? 
KC:Yeah, 
last year. (?)went out last night. 
I'd never 
seen a guy do 
it before. 
My 
brother had him, Walt. 
I looked 
over, and here he was, he had just one foot overboard like that. 
He was touching bottom with it. 
He had his other foot in 
the boat. 
I don't know how he got there like that. 
GP:Do you get many people who have never been out in a 
boat before? .Never been out railbirding before at all? 
KC: Yeah. 
We got a guy 
last night. 
His brother was 
in 
here 15 years, and he brought his younger brother with him. 
He'd 
never been before 
And 
it took him pretty near quite a while to 
get used to it. 
He was the one who was missing them all for a 
while. 
GP: Well, they're easy to miss, 1 know that. 
KC: Yeah. 
Takes one or two times to get used to the 
boat, shooting and getting used to the boat. There are some guys 
that -- they're used to -- they can fall 
right into it. 
But most 
of the guys, even the guys that are experienced hunters, takes them 
years til 
they get used to the boat, a couple of times out. 
Once 
you get the rhythm of 
it and know what you're doing. 
GP: There goes a bunch of geese right in there, see them? 
KC: Yeah, they're going. What's the date, second? 
GP: Second, yeah. 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 67 
KC: From year to year, you can take 
it from the second to 
the third, fourth, 
in that area, through 
here. 
GP: I used to 
live 
in Alexandria, Virginia, over near Mt. 
Vernon. 
And there are a lot of geese that sit on the river over by 
Mt. Vernon. 
And it seems like around the 26th of October we'd see 
two flights of geese go over and we wouldn't see them again 'til 
spring when they'd go north. 
And never saw geese around the house, 
but just that time when they would come through. 
Why don't you 
tell 
us about-- I put some numbers on these boats. 
And maybe you 
can tell 
us what you know about them, sort of as a way of taking 
notes. 
KC: Well, I don't know 
My brother,Walt, he's been around longer 
than I have. 
And that -- I would say I know it's 50 years old. 
GP: Number one. 
KC: Yeah. 
And I know who built this 
one, a guy by the 
name of Walter Pfeiffer. He was a local builder. Actually a 
housebuilder but he built these boats 
for my dad. And it's been 
around, 
it's got a new bottom on 
it. 
It's all made out of cedar to 
start with, but we've remodelled them and put plywood bottoms on, 
new ribs and 
fiberglass'd them. 
GP: Now, they would be 
longitudinally planked. 
KC: Yeah, 
longways, yeah. 
The planks would always -- there's 
eight to ten inches wide, most of them. 
In fact, this boat here 
probably you would have had a narrow strip down the side here and 
probably three long planks down it and one on each side. 
GP: Were the chines built up at all? 
KC: You mean out here? 
GP: Yeah, right at the edge. 
KC: When they had the cedar on, we had a brass rail, would be a 
brass rail. 
That one has got aluminum on 
it, 
see 
it? 
GP: Oh, yeah. 
That's number three. 
KC: Yeah. 
But these ones all 
had brass rails on them. They'd 
hold up 
longer than that. 
And aluminum. 
GP: Did they always have these sort of skegs at the front? 
KC: Yeah, 
it's just something to give them a little 
steering power when you're in the water. 
You don't get much out of 
them 
but you've got to have something on there. 
If you don't they 
just go 
like this all 
the time on you. 
That helps hold them a 
little bit. 
But you can't have a deep one like a regular bateau 
has 
it. 
Sometimes they have one a foot high on 
it. 
And you 
couldn't have that on it out here in the meadow 
GP: And that looks like 
it's oak. Is it--Yeah, they're 
oak. 
KC: Yeah. 
GP: Do they have to be replaced every so often? 
KC: No. 
We don't have to -- unless you tear them off or 
something. 
You hit something once 
in a while and you might have to 
replace them. 
But these ones has been on there for ten or 15 
years, I know since he put the bottoms on them. 
GP: And when did you fiberglass them? Let's see, 
it's 
plywood actually, the bottom is plywood , huh? 
KC: Yeah, put new ribs and put plywood on them and then 
fiberglassed them over. 
This one has been done probably 15 years 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 68 
That number two was built that way. That was built with plywood and 
fiberglassed when he built it. Anybody that does it today, that's 
the way they do them now. 
GP: And what did you say about number two? 
That was built across 
the street, did you say? 
KC: Right here, right across the --
GP: Who built it? 
KC: Jack Smith. And he built this and then he sold it to my son, 
and then he built another one 
GP: Did he ever push commercially? 
KC: Yeah, he's pushed for us years. 
Different times. 
Whenever 
he -- 
if we needed somebody. 
He's a truck driver, but he's off now 
most of the time, so he can do 
it. 
GP: Meaning he's off on the road. 
KC: Yeah. 
He's not off that way. 
(Laughter.) 
GP: Well,how about number three? 
Where does that boat come from? 
KC: I don't know. 
I bought it off of my neighbor over here, and 
he got it about 15 years ago. 
And he got it from up around 
Riverside somewheres. 
That's all 
I know about it. 
I don't know 
anything else about that one. 
GP: Now, that boat seems a little bit kind of a curve on 
it. 
KC: 
It's a smaller boat. 
It's not quite as 
long as these 
ones 
I would judge it's only 
probably -- these are 16 or 
longer. 
I would think that would be 14 or between 14, 
15, 
somewheres. 
GP: Which of these 
is the best pushing boat? 
Do you have any 
sense about that? 
KC: 
: Well, I don't know. 
They stole mine last night. 
When I 
got up there, somebody had my boat so I had to use number one here. 
And it pushes about the same as mine. 
It's a pretty good boat, as 
far as pushing. 
GP: And what about the other two, thou 
How do they 
compare with the ones --
KC:WeII, the smaller boat over there number three, 
it's 
lighter, but it's trickier, right, Gar? He pushes that all 
the 
time. 
Yeah, 
it's a little trickier. It doesn't have the -- for 
some reason, I don't know. 
I guess because it's lighter, really. 
If you get a heavy boat and it's balanced out with a gunner, you 
can push 
it just as easy as you can another boat. 
The balancing it 
out 
is the main thing, 
getting them going. 
Now, I had a guy the 
other day. 
He was heavier, 
he weighted pretty near a hundred more 
pounds than I did. 
And 
it made the front -- you can't find --
don't make no difference which boat you have then; the front goes 
down more than what -- you have trouble getting it through. 
GP: Do you teligunners--Well, you can. 
really back up 
in these 
things. 
KC: Well, when we go hunting, you know how you put your foot 
underneath that thing? 
Anybody that's really experienced they 
don't have to put their foot -- we back up. 
We stand right in the 
middle of the boat to get the bow up. 
GP: I see. 
KC: But that's the reason -- it's just as easy to push a guy 
sitting down. 
You can get him back a little bit, 
if 
he can't stand 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 69 
up. 
It's best to stand 
up because he has more vision. But when 
the reed's down and everything, it's best to get him back 
in the 
boat 
if you can. 
GP: 
That would be 
like an older man who (inaudible). 
KC: 
I think it was after you was here -- I got a guy 
comes, he's got a wooden foot 
And he stands up--
GP:Is that right? 
KC: Yeah. 
And he stands up. 
He does good, too, for his age and 
stuff. 
He don't want to sit 
down. 
He wants to stand up. 
I can't 
get him to sit down. 
He wants to stand up. 
I think 
it makes his 
ego a little better and stuff. 
GP: Right. 
KC: He's got a foot now that moves. 
The first one he had was 
rigid, 
it wouldn't twist or bend when he moved it. 
But this one 
has got a little give to 
it. You want to get him on tape over 
there. He's one of the old timers. 
GP: 
I see Mark Weatherby just came up, too. He wasn't 
here last time. 
KC: This is Mark's grandaddy. Yeah, he's been around longer than 
I have. 
MW:(Milton Weatherby) TOO long! 
KC: We're going up to his place to go out from up there. 
GP: 
I'd like to slap a rule on a couple of these 
boats here and get some rough idea of what th measurements would 
be. 
KC: Well, 
if you want to measure them, 
we've got 16-foot poles. 
GP: Well, I've got a tape measure right in 
my--
Recording interrupted.) 
GP: 
(Inaudible.) 
KC: I was about 12 when they started coming up here to go 
railbirding and they 
GP: Who was that, Ken? 
I didn't hear. 
KC: Comthin Blanchard and Dahl, wasn't it? 
GP: This doesn't have a --
KC: No, I don't know why they didn't put it back on there. 
Probably when they re-fiberglassed it there. 
Oh, I know; 
it was 
done over at the shipyard over here. 
There was a boatyard here and 
Starr had them all 
-- 
had both of them done over there. 
And they didn't put it back on there. 
Mike Tomlin, he worked there 
and he done them at the time. 
GP: What did you say about Starr? 
Who's that? 
KC: He was a gunner that come from Philadelphia. 
He was 
one of the old timers who'd come for years. 
GP: Put some numbers on these. 
Which one of these 
is your boat? 
KC: This 
is mine. 
GP: Let's call that -- and 
in the microphone there. 
I 
guess 
if a microphone gets used in South Jersey it's got to get 
used to sand. 
Call your boat number four. 
Each one seems to be a 
little bit different, and yet -
KC: They're different, but all 
on the same design (inaudible). 
They look 
like a canoe to you, do they? 
GP: They look 
like a canoe to me. 
I'm not sure they look 
like 
that to the state of Maryland, though. 
Oh, state of New Jersey. 
I 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 70 
forget where we are. 
KC: We got postponed to the 16th. 
GP: 
Is that right? 
KC: Yeah. 
GP: Here we'll call number five. 
KC: What happens on the 16th? 
You 
just don't bother 
with me, or --
GP: 
(Inaudible.) (Simultaneous discussion--unintelligible.) 
GP: That's the state man when they go to ask you for the numbers? 
KC: Numbers, yeah. 
GP: When was that, Ken? 
KC: The 8th, wasn't it? 
Or wasn't it that early? 
GP: I was here the 24th. 
KC: We was -- let's see, we was scheduled to go to court that 
week, wasn't it, 23rd or something like that? 
GP: : No, I think you said it was after that. 
KC: Yeah. 
You was here on a Monday, right? 
GP: Yes, 
it was a Monday. 
GP: We was supposed to go Tuesday, I think. I'm not sure. That's 
the night we had to go, 
so 
it was the week before that, somewheres 
around the 14th, 
in 
that area. 
I don't have the particular --
(Inaudible.) 
GP: Well, tell me, what do you like about your boat? 
You seem 
I noticed you sort of have a preference for it. 
KC: Well, once you get used to one 
it don't really make too much 
difference, til 
you get used to pushing it. Each one pushes just a 
little bit different to the other one. Then you get used to pushing 
one, and like last night, they took mine, and I knowed the 
difference just as soon as I got on 
it. 
You got to get used to 
it 
again. You can push any of them, really. 
But each one of them has 
got a different feel. Now, that boat there will 
rock this way. 
GP: Number five will 
rock from side to side? 
KC: Side to side twice as much as this one will. 
It's 
narrower, and it's longer. 
It goes ahead good in the reeds, but 
when you go to turn 
it, 
it's -- turns a little harder than these 
ones. 
GP: Milt, do you have a boat that you're 
MW: Yeah, I've got one, yeah. It's up the river. 
GP: You're pretty fussy if somebody goes off with your boat? 
MW: Oh, no. 
Anybody can have her. 
I've got a notion of 
giving her away. 
GP: I notice your grandson building a boat, didn't he, 
Mark? 
Isn't he your grandson? 
MW: Uh-huh. 
GP: He was pushing with us down here on the 24th. 
MW: Yeah, uh-huh. 
That's --
GP: His 
is a little bit different design, 
it seems wider or 
something. 
MW: Well, that was a riverboat but they sawed it off, sawed the 
stern off to put a motor on 
it. 
GP: Oh, I see. 
So he didn't really build it from scratch then. 
MW: No, 
no. 
GP: Well, why don't we take some measurements of these boats and 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 71 
then we'll call 
it quits here? 
(cut) 
KC:One comes down there ahead of them. 
GP: Gosh, you need a tide to get up 
in 
here, don't you? I can see 
it, 
look at this, this 
is 
really --
KC: Yeah. 
Anywhere you see yellow flowers, you need a tide. 
Hey, 
cross the ditch, cross the ditch. No... 
GP: 
I'm shooting a high, consistently. 
KC: We'd have gone right on by him if we kept on going. 
MW: Yeah. 
GP: Do they do that sometimes with this? 
MW: Oh yeah. 
GP: Yeah. 
I pushed a boat that went back and got up 
in soaking wet 
water and take right off of 
it flying. 
MW: Huh? 
MW: We pushed it right on top of 
it.(WILD SOUND, SOUND OF SHOOTING 
GUNS) LEFT! Left! 
GP: Good goin'. 
KC: Nah, he wasn't. 
One 
leg went down, 
is all. 
GP: I was wondering, one reason I'm having a hard time staying up 
with 
it 
is I have my toe under this thing here. 
I was wondering 
what it was doing. 
KC: 
I'll move down if you guys want to come this way. 
UNID: The reeds 
is thick. 
UNID: Sure is. 
I 
N 
I 
D 
: Yeah. 
GP: You don't often get them up a second time, do you? 
Like that 
one that just popped right down in here. 
KC: Big tide, you might. 
When they 
got covered like this you can 
get them up there a lot of time 
GP: I wonder why they bother to get up and fly anyway? 
KC: 
If you get ahead of these guys and 
hear them coming, you'd get 
up and fly --
GP: Well, I guess. Does it help to sort of holler at them? 
I 
noticed sometime last week you were whistling or something like 
that, at them. What does that do? 
KC: Don't do much. (laughs) 
MW: Makes you feel you're getting them. 
The only reason we take 
the pole is to do that brush like that so it'll give us a rest. 
MR: Really? 
You don't give many of 
them up that way. 
If they're 
going to get up, they're going 
to get up. Most of the time, you 
know -- (SOUND OF SHOTS) 
KC: 
I'll wait for you. 
UNID: Bring them back the other way, will you? 
GP: See the goose up there? 
KC: Yeah, and another flock's coming down 
KC: They start hopping when they --see this water here. 
GP: Okay, I could even see that one myself. 
I have a tendency to 
shoot high for s.ome reason or 
another. 
Fortunately, that one was 
going up. 
GP: How many more we have here? 
KC: We got four of them. 
That one 
is yours right there 
GP: You got them split up 
into two parties here, don't you? 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 72 
KC: Yep.we'll catch up 
in a minute 
GP: We're coming to some open water here, and they're likely to 
jump - 
-
KC: Yeah. They're apt to be one or two here. 
Would be. 
If they 
move out. 
Sometimes they will, sometimes they won't. 
GP: We're really getting those yellow weeds in here, or whatever it 
is. 
KC: Yeah, (Laughs) No! No! Reedbird (whistles off beats reed with 
pushpole) They got some up 
in that corner. 
GP 
That was 3 boats 
in about30 yards of each other. 
KC: They got about four birds out of there, I think maybe. 
KC 
--til they stopped them, yeah. Now right on top of the tide, they 
would have moved out a little faster, I think. 
GP: 
There goes one. 
(sound of shots) 
Oh, that's going to be bird-burger. 
We're waiting for Mike to 
catch up with us, 
are we? 
KC 
Yeah, they're coming. 
He won't go 
in there. 
Theyll come around 
the edge. 
he'll beat on out of there before he gets down here, I 
expect. 
GP: Now exactly why did we move operation up here? 
KC: Haven't been anybody hunting up here for one thing. 
We wanted to 
try to get some birds. 
The meadows down there have been hunted 
pretty good, you know. 
More than these one here. 
But you need a 
little more water upp here to get them so you can get to them. 
(SOUND OF SHOTS) 
UNID: 
Oh! Oh! Behind you! 
UNID: Hold it. 
KC 
There he goes--back. 
GP: Somebody got him, anyway. 
KC: 
No, they didn't shoot at him. 
GP: Where was the shot? 
I didn't --
KC 
Over in back of us. 
That was Mike over here that shot, I think. 
Or Earl, That might have been Earl 
up 
in the back. 
GP: With these headphones on,I have no 
idea where the sound 
is 
coming from. 
KC: Well, we'll see 
if we can't beat one up here for this guy 
(nearby boat. 
Sounds of boat in 
reed, beating with pushpole.) 
Might be 
him up again there, Gar. 
(Sound of shots) 
GP: That was a little close. 
KC: That picks up the sound of them shots does it? (laughs) KC 
whistles and beats marsh with pushpole to flush birds) 
MR: Yeah. 
Yeah. (SOUND OF SHOOTING) 
KC: There he goes, down 
in the ditch. They got him in 
the 
crossfire. 
UNID: Look at those blackbirds doing there 
UNID: Over them woods, see them? 
GP: Oh yeah, mercy. 
Clouds of them. 
KC: They're diving all over the place, 
ain't they? 
UNID: 
That's wild looking. Yeah, 
look at all 
of them. 
GP: Looks like a cloud just moving around. 
MW: 
I've seen teal come 
in this m,eadow like that at dark. 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel

KC: See that one hollering? 
GP: Yeah, I was going to ask you, 
is that a--
KC: Yeah, that's a rail..

isn't it Milt?

He's still alive, Gar. 
Blowed his wing off or something, 
didn't you?

you're liable to

where he 
lit, anyway.

Maybe there was another shot there. 
KC: That him? 
I imagine that's him. 
He had his head up when he come down. 
KC: Cripple! 
You want to watch your ahead. Here is 
an open ditch. 
One might get 
across--
GP: There's a bird running there. 
KC: Hold it. 
Don't shoot. 
Them guys are up there see. 
Shot might ricochet off. Don't shoot 
unless he goes to the left.

KC: Oh, you got another one inside? 
MW: Right there's where I saw him at, Ken. 
KC: Right here, wasn't it? 
That's where I had him marked. 
I might have got the boat on him. 
KC: He looked good, but --
Let me push ahead, see 
if he's underneath the boat..yep. 
There he 
is. 
GP: We had the boat right on top of 
him, eh? 
KC: Uh huh. 
Yeah. We most generally do that when we get tired, 
but — 
— 
MW: 
(off mike) For a rest! (laughs) 
KC: Yeah. 
GP: That was real exciting, that little corner there. 
KC 
Yeah, Four--I seen three birds all 
at once there, just getting 
ready to get up. 
GP: Well, why did you tell me not to shoot that one bird when he was 
running kind of hopping just above the grass there? 
KC: The boat was over there too close. You'd have been shooting too 
close to 
'em. 
Way over on the right. 
You'd have been shooting 
down, but the shot might have ricocheted off the water. 
UNID: Whoa, Right up front of you. 
He's up and down, 
see him? 
KC: Damn. This floating (Floating marsh) thing. Back 
in here doesn't 
look quite as high, Milt. 
Last year she was really heavy. 
UNID: Maybe another one there, Fred. 
GP: Now where do you see the floating marsh? 
KC: Straight ahead of us. 
That tall thick stuff there .Oh yeah. 
I think she's still there now, but it might not 
(SOUND OF SHOOTING) 
KC: Yeah, she's still 
in there. 
I'll show you some of 
it. 
GP: That's that house isn't it--over there. 
KC: Yeah, she's still here. 
See this 
here? See how its up on top? 
GP: Oh yeah, the whole --
GP: When you put your pole in there, the whole thing undulates. 
KC: Yeah. 
GP: What causes that? 
KC: 
Ice causes it. Makes it come to the top and then it stays there, 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 76 
and 
it then the growth keeps on growing on 
it. 
UNID: Hit 'em again! 
Hit 'em again! 
GP: Do the bird like 
it back 
in this stuff? 
KC: Oh yeah. 
They'll run to 
it or stay there. 
GP Now what do you call 
this little piece of open water like 
is 
up 
ahead of us here? 
KC. Ditch. 
GP. Ditch, eh? 
Is that because it has straight sides or what? 
KC: Yeah, 
it was dug there by machine or by hand years ago to drain 
the meadow. 
GP: 
Is that the same thing as a drain, 
is that the same word? 
KC. Yeah. 
Drainage ditch 
is what they call 
them. 
GP: How about the word 'gut', do they use that word around here? 
KC. What was that? 
GP. Do they use the word 'gut' around here? 
KC: Yeah. They call a little place where 
it swings up toward the 
woods or something. 
GP: Would this be a gut? 
KC: No, 
it'd be more of a ditch here. 
KC: That "floating" there's still there. 
UNID: 
(pusher on adjacent boat) ...across this point. That's a 
bitch 
in there. 
GP: What do you call 
this, floating? 
MM: 
(Michael Monier, sportsman) Have you seen the floating meadow? 
GP: Oh yeah, yeah. 
I don't know how they get these boats through them. 
MM: You try very hard not to.(laughs) 
GP: Oh? 
MM: You try to go around it. 
GP: How you doing? 
You got a bunch of birds there, Mike, how 
many you got? 
MM: I don't know exactly. 
GP: Well, 
it got real 
lively 
in a couple of those corners, didn't 
it? 
MM: That's fun just to watch'em, push a corner like that, and 
there were four or five went out 
GP: Wow, 
look at that lens, eh?(of the professional photographer) 
KC: Best thing to do 
is to go up the ditch or then head out into the 
sun--so they'll have an excuse. 
No, 
this 
is fine. 
UNID: This picture taker is taking pictures of the picture taker. 
KC: Yeah, he got to have proof he was here. 
UNID: Go 
in here, Ken? 
KC: Yeah,we'II go up the ditch and then head out toward the river, 
I d say. 
UNID: 
There goes a wood duck. 
Coming right at us. 
KC: Don't say nothing to Make (laughs) 
UNID: 
Now he's going the other way. 
UNID: 
There's another one over there. 
GP: Mike's not too fussy about some of the officially 
approved--(laughs) 
KC: Yeah. Go out towards Earl 
there somewhere. 
(SHOOTING, SOUNDS) 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 77 
GP: Still flying. 
Mark left! 
-- whoa! 
Got any other kind of bottoms that, 
I mean, besides floating 
bottoms? 
KC: Nah. 
GP: There's a reed bird sitting up there, 
isn't there? 
KC: Yeah. 
GP: I think I'm going to try to get,Ken -- the way you guys shout to 
keep 
in touch when you can't see each other. 
KC: Well, yeah, that's the only thing we can do 
is holler now 
because this reed isn't that high here, you know. we can see, most 
of the time. 
Maybe we can get Earl to answer us, over there. 
GP:Well, why don't we try to fake that once or twice? 
KC: 
GI: 
KC: 
MR: Woo! 
GP: Now th 
KC: 
Yeah, 
GP: 
So wh 
New Jersey

KC: those reed birds 
Rich. 
KC:Still don't want to get up. 
RICH: What's that? 
KC: I say they still 
across the water. 
T 
GP: What would you s 
KC: Twenty gauge, mo 
Okay? 
Yeah, go ahead. 
W000--Give a holler there.

They want to shoot

ay was the most popular gun down here? 
st of them now. 
GP: Model 
1100 (Remington) 
KC: A lot of them use them, and a lot of them use doubles, too. 
GP: Yeah, this 
is good for doubles. 
UNID: (Gunner in next boat, joking) 
This is a pump. 
UNID: He'II agree with you, he's got one. 
GP: 
What is 
that, an Ithaca? 
I don't know, Rich we might just skit 
the outside there. 
Gonna get heavy up 
inside there until we get out 
toward the end there more. 
There goes one! 
(SOUND OF SHOOTING) 
UNID: (to GP) Good shot! Got to get 'em before Mike does. (laughs) 
GP: Okay. 
I don't know if there's any protocol 
in waiting to take a 
shot, or anything... 
UNID: 
Sure is. 
KC: The first guy gets on him, with this gang. 
GP: You got him marked, Ken? 
KC. No. 
UNID: He's right along the edges there 
UNID: Right@ Right! Get him, Mike. 
(SHOOTING SOUNDS) 
KC: I can't mark them and talk and--huh? 
He wasn't out this far, 
was he? 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 78 
GP: I thought he was still back there. See, I thought he was a pretty 
good --
UNID:Where you going, Ted? 
KC:I don't know. Anywhere. 
Pretty heavy, I imagine, or 
it used to be. 
UNID: They're going 
in 
it (railbird). 
Walt's getting the birds. 
KC: 
I'm gonna see 
if I can find this bird before I do anything. 
NOTE: 
Background high pitched whine is a jet engine being tested at 
a facility ten miles away. 
KC: He looked like he was hit good and dead. 
I just didn't keep my 
mark on him right. 
I cut out there when I should have come right 
towards him. 
GP: They are hard to find, aren't they? 
KC: 
This time of night they are worse..when you start to get 
shadows. I still think he's right here somewhere. 
GP: What's the chance of boat's on him again? 
KC: I don't think so, unless I cut 
in 
too much. 
GP: 
It wouldn't be that he's over there a little bit further, would 
it? 
KC: 
It could be.. he was right down this line, the edge of this 
stuff, this reed  
 
GP: I thought for sure we had him. 
Nothing "for sure" 
in this game 
is there? 
KC: Nah, you can't take your eye off of 
it, 
that's all. 
Once you 
take your eye off it..unless its open, you know, you're more or less 
licked. 
GP: You don't think he might be over in that one, do you? 
KC: Yeah, he could be. 
GP: You know, as thick as 
it 
is here, I thought we'd find him lying 
right on top of something. 
KC: No, they go down through it most of the time to the water. 
You only find them once 
in a while on the top. Hmmm. How about that 
There he 
is there, all 
the time. 
GP: Oh, for heavens sakes, how about that? 
How about that! 
KC: I knew, I figured he was dead, that's the reason I didn't 
want to 
loose him. 
GP: You do now some railbirding for your own enjoyment, do you? 
KC: Oh, 
if we get a chance, we will. If we don't, maybe we might 
get out once or twice a year maybe at the most. 
Rich, he got out 
the other day; we got fouled up on the number of guys that was 
coming, and 
if I don't write something down when the guy calls or 
something, I got fouled up, I had seven down and there were only 
five. 
So he went out himself, him and a local boy there. 
GP: Did they push right along with you? 
KC: No, they went in another meadow. 
GP: You had one day -- I was talking to Frank last night or the 
night before, Frank Astemborski, 
I think he told he that one day he 
was down here and you had a whole bunch of boats down here. 
KC: Yeah, we have seven down here that 
day, or eight. 
GP: Weren't there some other people out on the river, too? 
KC: Yeah. 
There were about four other boats that day. I guess 
Parsons--$4 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 79 
about 12 boats 
in the meadow. 
GP: Well, that's like old times. (laughs) How do you account for 
that? 
KC: Well, there was a big tide, and 
everybody, the local guys 
that know anything about it, 
they' wait for one of them tides to 
go, 
you know? 
GP: So which day was that? 
KC: 
It was Friday, yeah -- last Friday. 
GP: Now why was that such a big tide? 
KC: Kinda stormy. Well, 
let's see. 
It was perigee and the wind was 
around the northeast. 
KC: How's doing, Earl. 
EARL: (Off mike) Not bad. 
He's not shooting like he was the other 
day. 
MM: 
(Michael Monier) I've always been very apprehensive when people 
are around me with cameras. 
UNID: The microphone 
get me. 
GP: 
Well, 
if 
it makes you guys feel any be 
it messes up my 
shooting, too, I tell you. 
KC: 
There 
it goes! 
UNID: Take it easy now.(shot) 
KC: There's another one out here somewhere. 
Another one. Wait a 
minute. 
Head-bird, or head-shot. 
EARL: Right in front of you, Kenny, keep going. 
KC: Did he run ahead? 
The one he shot is bouncing around there like 
a chicken with its head off. 
UNID: Right off your bow. 
Right there. 
You see him still? 
KC: No. 
UNID: I see it right there. (SOUND OF CLOSE SHOOTING) 
UNID: 
Hey, Warren! 
Yeah, right over here, too, baby. 
UNID: Let's go on back, Earl, 
let's go on 
back and do our own 
shooting, we'll find our own little place 
Thanks Freddie, for 
coming down. 
UNID: Mike's following me, he wants to get 
away from you.(Laughs) 
UNID: Kenny, right there off of your left 
foot. 
KC: Yeah, that's where I seen him. 
UNID: He might have just been crippled, 
too, because 
if 
he was 
just bouncing around there --
GP: I think the bird dove. 
There were two. 
KC: Huh? 
GP: There were two birds right there. 
UNID: Yeah, there was one running. 
KC: I thought he might have been hit in 
the head, the way he was 
bouncing around. 
GP: Yeah, I didn't want to shoot him again 
because I thought we 
had him. 
KC: Well, I guess -- he had enough life to get away from there. 
UNID: Rich, why don't yuou go out in the middle of that pond over 
there to your right with Fred and just sit there and quack a little 
bit, huh? 
KC: Think we can get down through here? 
UNID: Well, 
if you're not going to go on, 
I'm not going to wait for 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 80 
him. 
UNID: That's it, Mike, just keep doing that. 
You'll get the 
Wheaties box top. 
(SHOOTING SOUND) 
KC: There's one on your left that's ready to get up, Earl. I seen 
him up there on the reed. Left! No back. 
GP: 
In grouse hunting, the thing to do 
is just stand still. 
KC: There are some in here, they're just running around here. 
UNID: Earl's going to go to Bausch and Lomb tomorrow and they're 
going to check his eyes out. 
KC: Get both of them, Earl? 
KC: He didn't show you much, did he? 
GP: 
Is that a rail bird? 
KC: Yeah, there he 
is. 
(SOUND OF SHOOTING) 
UNID: Sorry, Fred. 
I try to get him a little bit off to the 
bowside. You know. 
I don't mind taking them handily, but not 
that handily. 
KC: Hmm, Ought to have been one along that edge. 
GP: Do you never find them out in 
an open spot like this, do you? 
KC: Oh, once 
in awhile you push 'em out there. 
You wonder where you 
came from. 
I don't know, Dude. 
KC: Yeah, go ahead. 
What do you think, Dude? 
(SHOOTING SOUNDS) 
UNID: Will you tell 
him to cut the shit?

This 
is Gerald Parsons of the Library 
of Congress American 
Folklife Center, recording rail hunting in the Maurice River near 
Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, on the evening of October 2, 
1984. 
The pusher on the radio mike 
is Mr. Kenneth Camp. This 
is tape 
three of three. 
(Recording interrupted.) 
GP: 
Okay, we're back 
in business. 
It will 
be all 
right if we get 
across thi,, maybe. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
We'll get her. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Yeah, I see something there. 
I think 
it 's a piece of 
floating up there. 
MR. (Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Yeah. 
Sometimes it's easier right along the edge than 
it 
is 
out 
in the middle. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Yeah, 
it might be one of them rowing boats. 
He's got an 
orange hat on. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Yeah, the airport is out there. 
They test engines out there. 
I think they pull 
them down to the foundation and test them. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
I don't know what department he's 
in now. 
He's been 
in a couple of them. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Well, two of them are state workers, 
Jeremy Boyd and 
Gwaltney. 
Gwaltney is a foreman on the state highway, and 
Boyd, he works with Fish and Game. He's semi- retired, does a 
little farming. 
I don't know what Mark does He was a welder 
but I 
think this time of the year he takes off. 
He goes bow hunting and 
everything. 
We're going to make 
it. 
MR. 
Ken, what was that you were telling me about the reason they 
call 
these 
railbirds? 
MR. 
This was a dairy farm in here. They used to have the 
split rail fence. 
And when the meadows went out the fences went 
underwater, see, and started floating all over. 
And these rails 
would get on them and line up. They'd shoot them right down the 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 82 
rail. Yeah. That was more 
or less years ago, you'd market hunt 
them. Wouldn't be 
nothing to come out and shoot a hundred shells. 
There ought to be some birds amongst this little piece here at the 
end. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
We're about on 
it now. 
I don't know whether it's (inaudible) 
or not. 
But it 
looks about - a little on that thing there. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Yeah, that's one of the drains. It's just got wider. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Yeah, or the tide runs 
in up through the meadow. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Oh, yeah, he's still around. 
MR. 
He doesn't do the duck hunting anymore, does he? 
MR. Yeah, he still ducks. 
He did 
last winter. 
I haven't seen him 
for quite a while. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. Oh, yeah, this guy Fred White shot a hole down through the 
front of the boat. It was the first time she'd ever been. 
She was 
a little anxious, and when the bird raised, she (inaudible) gun up 
to her shoulder, she hit the trigger went right down through the 
front of 
it. 
I don't know why he won't bring her down again. 
He 
won't bring her down anymore. 
You might as well unload; we're 
going to head across. 
Be 
legal tonight anyhow, the sun just went 
down, didn't it? 
Yeah, there he 
is. 
They're hollering now. 
They know the tide has started out. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
They know it when the tide starts 
out. 
You'll find more of 
them jumping up behind you and shooting off to the side. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
You want to wait for your camera- man there and see 
if 
he wants to take any out there 
in the river? 
MR. 
Well, that's an idea, something he might want to do. 
MR. 
He'll be coming out 
here pretty 
soon. Get a picture 
of the guys going into something. We'll wait here for him. 
MR. 
Okay. 
MR. 
We'll turn around back too, 
in case the guys jump a bird 
there. They might shoot. 
MR. 
Somewhere back 
in the reeds there the antenna got knocked over, 
so we didn't get such good reception. That's too bad. 
One or two 
back 
in 
there. 
MR. 
Oh, yeah. 
If you know how many of them was left 
in 
there, 
probably a thousand of them in that whole meadow there. 
More than 
that. 
The cover they got I'd say you only get maybe one out of 
eight. 
There's one hollering right there. 
I guess Milt's coming out 
of that ditch up there, from the looks of things. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR 
They don't do much here 
in the river, ducking. 
Most 
of 
it has to be 
in the meadow. 
That's where they're used to 
feeding. 
Get froze up, maybe you might From here down to our 
place, there was only one place in the river you could kill 
any 
ducks out of the blinds along the river. 
Now, some rivers, 
they 
Parsons--84 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 83 
do good out of blinds. But here you got to get up 
in the meadow. 
They get up at the end of one of these drainage ditches and set up 
in a sneak box and put their stools out. 
If that guy comes 
tomorrow, I'm going to 
let him use my 
little double if he wants to 
use 
it. 
He's got a -- they let him use the pump gun there 
(unintelligible). 
I imagine those guys flew up and probably didn't 
bring their guns with them. 
It's getting to be a hassle, I guess 
to get anything around like that anymore. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
That's your equipment. 
You want to put your foot right there 
and put the other back there, 
see where the holes are? That's what 
I mean, that's my stance Just put her down there like that. 
MR. 
So you're facing to the starboard side of the boat, 
and you've got your left foot right up against the coaming and the 
right foot towards the back 
MR. 
They were going to get overboard before you get back there. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
It's three or four foot. 
MR. 
Okay, so what sort of arrangement 
MR. 
: Just go down the pole and bear down on her. 
Put your 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Get your pole out over there more that's it. 
Now 
try 
it. 
That should bring you around to the right. 
Every time you 
put your pole in, 
if 
you want to go somewhere, you can tell which 
way to go. 
Look at that. 
Hey, Mike. 
See that? 
You're getting 
better all 
the time. 
You put a bird up first 
MR. 
How long 
is this pole? 
MR. 
That's 
a 14—foot one there. 
Most of these guys use a 16. 
I 
need a short one. 
He should be out there in the point somewhere. 
Bring her that way, not too much at a time. 
You'll go 
if 
you go 
too far you'll go too much. 
Don't take much. 
You can use 
your right leg there up 
in here. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
You've got to get used to 
it. 
Did he die? 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
No, they seen him out there 
You better get down here and 
let me take you across. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Yeah. 
Now all 
you got to do 
is 
clear up your 
equipment, get all 
the reeds out of 
it. You 
ain't got any 
(inaudible), have you? 
MR. 
: (Inaudible.) 
MR. 
What are you shooting? 
Are you shooting the 410 tonight? 
MR. 
: Last year I started shooting the 410 
MR. 
You didn't earlier. The time you was down before --
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
You're all 
right, 
if you can shoot 
-- you better sit down 
here, 
it's too deep to have to jump in and get ahold of you. 
MR. 
Have you ever had anybody go over in deep water? 
MR. 
Not too much, out in the water. Most of the time it's 
around the edges of the ditch or something, when the boat comes out 
into 
it. 
It's just -- you got more -- it's a little tipsier out 
Parsons--84 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 84 
there 
in 
the open 
water than around the edges and the ditches we 
do once 
in a while. 
MR. 
Is there a name for that kind of paddling, where you 
just kind of --
MR. 
Nah., 
it's just something we got onto when we -- yeah, some 
of them. 
We'll 
leave one of them up here. 
I hope that wind stays 
down now. 
It might not hurt the tide as much tomorrow as we 
figured on 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. 
Yeah, that always 
is this time of night. 
MR. 
(Inaudible.) 
MR. Yeah, I don't know where I'm going really. 
I'm going between 
them, I guess. 
I'll find out. 
Do you want to push tomorrow night? 
I can use one.

late. Okey—dokey.

Fritz', too, don't we? 
I don't know. You ought to have enough seed 
in 
there so you can tell what that is 
Every once 
in a while a guy 
will 
take one of these sheep lined gun cases. 
He'll 
leave 
it 
unzipped in the boat or something. And 
it's just loaded with that 
stuff when they come back. 
We tell 
them to keep 
it ashore anymore.

we get things out of here.
