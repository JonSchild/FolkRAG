I 
AM waiting in the wildwood, Essie dear ! 
Beside the stream that murmurs sweet and low, 
In the nook we've known since childhood, Essie dear, 
-Where sunbeams on the ripples come and go ; 
Overhead the birds are singing in the trees, 
While their joyous carols echo through the dell ; 
Where the violets are smiling in the breeze, 
There our happy, happy tale of love we'll tell. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am waiting in the wildwood, Essie dear ! 
Beside the stream that murmurs sweet and low, 
In the nook we've known since childhood, Essie dear, 
Where oft we've met in happy days ago. 
Linger not, but haste to meet me, Essie dear ! 
Down where we've roamed in merry days " Lang syne." 
I 
am waiting here to greet thee, Essie dear, 
For I 
long to hear you whisper " Ever thine." 
Oh! I 
love you more than all the world beside, 
Ever true you've been in sorrow and in pain ; 
You were the star my weary heart to guide, 
How I 
long to hear your winning voice again! 
I 
am waiting in the wildwood, etc. 
STOKES' VERDICT. 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM J. 
SCANLON'. 
AIE.—" Never go Back on the Poor." 
Ti you'll listen awhile, I'll sing you a 
song 
About this " glorious land of the free," 
And the " difference " I 
II show ' twixt the rich and the poor, 
In a " trial by jury," you see. 
If you've plenty of " stamps," you can hold up —our head, 
And walk out from your own prison door, 
But they'll hang you up high if you've no friends or gold— 
Let the " rich " go, but bang up the poor ! 
CHORU S. 
In the trials for murder we've had now-a- days 
The rich ones get off swift and sure, 
While they've thousands to pay to the jury and judge, 
You can bet they'll go back on the poor! 
It me speak of a 
man who's now dead in his grave— 
A good man as ever was born— 
Jim Fisk he was called, and his money lie gave 
To the outcast, the poor and forlorn. 
We all know he loved both women and wine, 
But his heart it was ri ,
711t, I 
am sure ; 
Though he lived like a '• Prince " in a 
palace so fine, 
Yet he never went back on the poor 
C non 
L'S. 
If a 
man was in trouble, Fisk helped him along 
To drive the " grim wolf " from the door ; 
He strove to do right, though he may have done wrong, 
But he never went back on the poor 
Jim Fisk was a 
man, wore his " heart on his sleeve," 
No matter whit people would say, 
And he done all his deeds (both the eood and the bad) 
In the broad .5pen holt of the day. 
With his grand " six- in-hand" on the beach at Long Branch, 
He cut a " big dash " to be sure, 
But " Chicago's great fire " show'd the world that Jim Fisk, 
With his 
wealth," still remembered the poor ! 
(1) 
t 
STOKES' VERDICT.—Continued. 
CHORUS. 
When the telegram came that the homeless that night 
Were starving to death, slow but sure, 
His " Lightning Express," manned by noble Jim Fisk, 
Flew to feed all her hungry and poor I 
2S-
INV, what do you think of this " trial" of Stokes, 
Who murdered this friend of the pow.? 
When such men get free, is there any one safe 
If they step front outside their own door ? 
Is there one law for the poor and one for the rich '? 
It seems so, at least so I 
say ; 
If they hang up the poor, why—damn it I—the rich 
Ought to swing up the very same way ! 
CHOnus. 
Don't show any favor to friend or to foe, 
The beggar or prince at his door, 
The big millionaire you must hang up also, 
But never go back en the poor. 
Oh shame on this " land of the free and the brave,", 
When such sights as this meet our eye ! 
The poor in their prisons are treated like slaves 
Whole the rich in their cells they live high. 
A poor devil " crazy with drink," they will hang 
For a 
murder he didn't intend, 
But a 
wealthy assassin, with " pelitictl friends," 
Gets off, for he's money to snend I 
CIIORUS. 
But if things go on this way, we'll stand it no more; 
The people will rise up in bands; 
A Vigilance Committee we'll raise on our shore, 
And take the law in our own hands

OF 
all the pretty little blondes 
That ever walked the stage, 
There's one, I'll call her Nellie, 
She's the beauty of the age; 
She is petite in stature 
And as lively as a 
witch, 
And her back is ornamented 
With a 
golden swinging switch. 
CHORUS. 
The first time that 1 
met her 
She wore a 
swinging switch, 
This beautiful, this charming girl, 
This pretty little witch. 
Her smile it is angelic, and 
Her manners are serene. 
Her teeth of pearly whiteness 
Are the nicest I 
have seen ; 
Her voice at times is mellow, 
Again it's pure and rich, 
But the sweetest thing about her 
Is what golden swinging switch. 
The first time, etc. 
She skips before the footlights with 
An air of grace and ease, 
She sings like a 
canary, 
And 
always sure to please; 
Admirers, they are many, 
They applaud the little witch,. 
And when she gets an encore, then 
Oh don't she toss the switch.

SUCH A TERRIBLE TALKER IS MY MOTHER-
IN-LAW 
Words by L. 
C. 
DREWS, and sung with great success at Munn' WILLIAms' 
Academy of Music, Pittsburgh, Pa. 
My mother-in-law's a 
talker, she's always on the. jaw, 
She's talked me out of everything I 
own; 
She's a 
regular old huller, the worst I 
ever saw ; 
I 
hope she'll kick the bucket, very soon. 
She's got eyes like a 
mackerel, a mouth like a 
street 
door; 
She can look two ways, and never squint, 
Oh, she talks and chins all day, till she couldn't talk no 
more ; 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
CHORUS. 
She is luny, she is crazy, 
She can knock the stuffing out of any man, 
She would talk you blind, if you didn't mind, 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
Sometimes she makes it lively and goes for my hair, 
And pulls me all around the room. 
I 
wish she was in heaven, or where she couldn't rare, 
She ought to take a 
trip up to the moon. 
Her tongue goes like a 
clapper, it is loose at both ends, 
She has jawed and talked me nearly blind ; 
She is jawing in the morning, through the day, and 
through the night ; 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
She is luny, etc. 
And when she goes to bed, and I 
think she's gone to 
sleep, 
Then she starts again with her old mouth ; 
I'd like to see her buried, a 
tear I'd never weep ; 
She talks worse than the niggers in the South, 
A 
talking machine to her, you can't compare ; 
She's worse than thirty-seven howling bulls ; 
She would talk a 
car conductor out of his fare ; 
Such a 
terrible talker, is my mother-in-law. 
She is luny, etc.

SUNNY SMILES AND GOLDEN TRESSES.

MITCHELL. 
Music by E. 
N. 
CATLIN. 
The Music of this song is published by G. D. RUSSELL & Co., 126 Tremont 
St., Boston, Mass. Price 40 cents. 
SUNNY smiles and golden tresses, 
Eyes of tender loving blue; 
Kisses sweet and warm caresses, 
Cheeks of ruby rose's hue. 
Tripping with a 
fairy lightness, 
She was perfect ev'ry way ; 
And our path was lined with brightness 
When together day by day. 
CH ORD'S. 
Sunny smiles and golden tresses, 
She was perfect every way ; 
Kisses sweet, and warm caresses 
When together day by day. 
Cherry lips, of honeyed sweetness, 
Teeth of richest pearly white, 
Pretty form, that was completeness, 
Love like Luna's gentle light; 
Dancing like a 
summer sunbeam, 
She was happy, kind, and free, 
And our life was like a 
day dream 
When together we would be. 
Sunny Similes, Mt. 
Silver voice of softest velvet, 
Neck of alabaster fair, 
Modest as a 
little violet, 
With her flowing golden hair; 
Rising with the lark at morning, 
She would meet me ev'ry day ; 
But how lonely now the dawning, 
She, my love, has pass'd away. 
Sunny smiles, etc.

BEAUTIFUL BEWILDERING FLOWER 
Written by L. C. DnEws, and sung by LAWELL and DREWS. 
W HILE strolling on the avenue to-day, 
I 
met such a 
pretty girl, 
Her face as bright as any day in May ; 
It put my heart in quite a 
twirl. 
There is none such beauty can disclose, 
When she wakes from blissful dreams at early dawn, 
And the pride of : di flowers is the rose, 
She's my beautiful bewildering flower. 
As we walked along togetly:T going home, 
My happiness did then and there increase ; 
Our hearts from each other never roam, 
We are happy as the summer morning's breeze. 
Oh. the time when we will happy be, 
Is not far away you hot, 
For she a 
little wife will be to me. 
Oh, how I 
bless the day that e'er we met. 
I 
met her first, ' twas in it summer bower, 
And I 
shall not forgot her pldasing. smile ; 
I 
worthl have claimed her thin, had I 
the power ; 
Oh, my heart she did beguile. 
Then I 
asked her to be mine forever more, 
There came an answer, loving, kind and true, 
As we walked arm and arm through the door, 
She said to me, I 
always will he true. 
I HOPE I 
DON'T INTRUDE. * 
Written and composed by W. IL DELERANTY, and sung by DELREUNTY 
and II ENGLER. 
I'm happy as the day is long, 
My mind is never easy, 
No matter whether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude ; 
For love, it is the burden of my song, 
With joy I'm almost crazy, 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if perchance I 
sinff or dance, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude.

And if you come to see our home,

SLAVERY DAYS. 
Words by ED. H ARRIGAN. 
Music by DAVE BRALIAM. 
V IA Music of this song is published by Wm. A. POND & Co., 547 Broads 
way, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
I 
AM thinking to-day 
Of dem years da.t passed away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, 
It was day we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and wee. 
Dey took away my boy, 
He was his inother's joy ; 
From a baby in de cradle we him raise; 
Oh, dew put us far apart, 
An' it broke de ole man's heart, 
In dent agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
cnortus. 
Dey never come again, 
Let us give our praise to Hint 
Who looks down whar de little children play 
So ev'ry night and morn, 
We will pray for dew dat's gone, 
In dent agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er 
To dat dear old cabin door, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping ; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch- dog bark, 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, 
" 
You people must be free," 
For de happy time am corning, Lord be prais'd I 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not Out own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Dey never, etc. 
I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road ; 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, 
I 
have reaeli'd de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
Has always been may guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says; 
But our menfry will turn round, 
When our souls dey were tied down, 
Iu dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Dey never, etc.

KISS ME GOOD-NIGHT, LITTLE DARLING. 
As sung by GEO. GALES. 
W ON'T you kiss me good-night, little darling, 
Now the song birds have gone to rest, 
As you did in the days of childhood, 
When you leaned you; fond head on my breast ? 
The silvery moon's shining, my darling, 
The little stars twinkle so bright, 
Just give me one kiss ere we part, love; 
Little darling, come, kiss me good- night. 
CHORUS . 
Wont you kiss me good-night, little darling, 
Now the little stars twinkle so bright ? 
Just give me one kiss ere we part, love; 
Little darling, now kiss me good- night. 
Wont you kiss me good-night, little darling, 
And dream a 
sweet dream, love, for me ? 
For you, know when we played in the wild wood, 
I 
was always so loving to thee. 
You remember I 
kissed your sweet cheek, love, 
As you placed your sweet hand, dear, in mine, 
And this to me softly did whisper— 
Forever, love, I 
will be thine. 
Wont you kiss me, etc.

Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON T DE 
W IT2 
I'VE a 
daughter Julia, 
She is seventeen, 
And I'm told by all the neighbors, 
She looks like a 
queen. 
You shouli see her dancing, 
At it she's engaged, 
In the ballet she's the star, 
For she's on the stage. 
She can dance upon her toes. (Break.) 
To the music around she goes. (Break.) 
CHORUS. 
Dancing on the stage, 
Oh, but she does please, 
Around she glides with graceful form, 
And with, oh, such ease. 
She's a 
little beauty, 
And I 
will engage, 
There is not another girl, 
Like Julia on the stage. 
When the music's playing, 
flow the people shout ; 
On the stage they throw bouquets, 
When Julia does come out. 
Like a 
shadow gliding, 
Dressed sometimes as page, 
In the play to king or queen, 
My Julia's on the stage. 
She's her father's joy and pride. (Brea 
h ,) 
Like a 
fairy ylph she glides. (
Break.) 
Dancing on the stage, etc.

And sing to you a

We are going to-morrow morn, down to our good old 
home, 
Where massa hoes de sugar cane tu.u1. corn. 
When we reach dat good old inace, we will offer up a 
grace, 
While sating in our little cabin door ; 
And, kind friends, we will pray for you every night and

While working in de sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
When we reach dat good old place, we will offer up a 
grace, 
While sitting in our little cabin door; 
And, kind friends, we will pray for you, every night and 
morn, 
While working in de sugar cane and corn. 
All our friends have gone up there, with angels bright and 
fair, 
And we are left alone in this cold world; 
But when we're old and gray, then we will pass away, 
And join our friends on that celestial shore. 
We are waiting for the call, when we can join them 
lip there in that happy blessed place, 
And we'll hear their voices ringing, the same as when 
we're singing, 
While working in the sugar cane and corn. 
When we reach dat good old place, etc.

I've liver tried 
and bacon, 
And tripe, both broiled and fried; 
A 
sheepshead I 
have taken, 
And put myself outside! 
Though turtle soup is fining, 
And fish-balls joy produce; 
'Tis not the rapture or the joy. 
That appertains to— Goose !— Grio.

WHERE THE IVY GROWS SO GREEN. 
W ritten by W ILLIAM C. 
DONAHUE, and sung by the DASHINGTON 
BROTHERS 
DowN by a 
cool and shady streamlet, 
Where the water lilies grow so green, 
There dwells a 
lovely maiden 
In an ivy cot unseen ; 
She was gathering the flowers in the wildwood, 
Down by a 
little golden stream, 
Where both our hearts beat just as one, 
Where the ivy grows so green. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! darling Sue, this aching heart, (
Symph.) 
One more kiss before we part. 
(
Symph.) 
She was gathering the flowers in the wildwood, 
Down by a 
little golden stream, 
Where both our hearts spoke just as one, 
Where the ivy grows so green. 
(Dance.) 
And at night when the little stars were sleeping, 
And the leaves were falling oft the trees, 
We sat beside the brooklet, 
In the cool and shady breeze ; 
And when I 
asked her to be mine, 
Her pretty little eyes she tried to screen ; 
'Twas then I 
knew my fate was sealed, 
Where the ivy grows so green. 
Oh ! darling Sue, etc.

With the loved one by my side ?

We'll breast life's stormy tide; 
And though the current bears us on 
From all that's bright in life, 
My love will ever be as strong 
As when I 
call'd her wife, my wife, my wife.

I'VE a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly 
prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's 
days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to 
sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memory, etc.

THE COLORED SWELL. 
'Written expressly for FRANS BENNETT, by W. H. DELEHA.NTY. 
You may talk of your la de da fellows, 
Your Hilder Montrose and that kind; 
But in me see the prince of all swell-os, 
None grander than me can you find. 
I'm deucedly fond of the ladies, 
And the ladies are all fond of me ; 
Like a 
bee in a 
garden of daisies, 
I 
flatter myself I'm that bee. 
CHORUS. 
I'm swell of the belles, you bet, 
The pride of the girls, their pet ; 
Oh, dear, how they smile at my exquisite style, 
I'm the swell of all swells, you bet. 
Now, a 
rich uncle lately departed, 
He's gone to that home, bright and fair; 
But he made out his will and started, 
And I 
was his only heir. 
So the few thousand pounds that he left me, 
I'm rapidly turning to cash, 
Now, I'm doing the thing rather hefty, 
Yes, doing the grand with a 
dash. 
I'm swell, etc. 
Now, my rule is to honor propriety, 
Smoke " Vanity Fair" cigarettes, 
Drink wine in the best of society, 
Be loved and caressed by the pets. 
The darlings, they all dote upon me, 
Say that I'm too sweet to live; 
They hoax, and they coax and they chaff me, 
And they'll kill me with love, I 
believe. 
I'm swell, etc.

LITTLE MAGGIE MAY. 
The Spring had come, the flowers in loom 
The birds sung out their lay; 
Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first saw Maggie May: 
She had a 
roguish jet-black eye, 
Was singing all the day: 
4nd how I 
loved her 
none SOn 
My little Maggie May. 
CHORUS. 
My little witching Maggie. 
Maggie sinoing all the day. 
Oh! bow I 
love her 
none can Oen 
My little Maggie May. 
Nough years rolled on, yet still I 
lowed 
With heart so light and gay, 
And n.wer will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gono 
And death would take away, 
Still by my side did linger one. 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching, 4314: 
May Heaven protect me for her sake: 
I 
pray, both night and day, 
That I 
ere long may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For, she is all the world to me, 
Although I'm far away : 
I 
oftimes think of the running brook, 
hind my little Maggie May.

HE LOOKS MORE LIKE HIS PA. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
YOU'LL perceive I 
am feeling quite jovial, 
The reason you never could guess; 
It's simply because a 
bright cherub, 
My household's appeared in to bless. 
He was seven weeks old but last Sunday, 
And a 
smarter child never was born, 
And they say he looks like his papa, 
But he's crying from night until morn. 
CHORUS. 
He looks more like his pa every day, the young scamp, 
Be looks more like his pa every day; 
And the neighbors all say he has got just my way, 
And looks more like his pa every day. 
Last week was the day of his christening, 
And the people came from near and far, 
To pay their respects to the infant, 
And wish luck to his pa and his ma. 
They'd smother him quite with caresses, 
Their love for my offspring was plain, 
And as they our refreshments devoured, 
In a 
chorus they'd loudly exclaim : 
He looks more like his pa, etc, 
In my neighborhood dwells an old maiden, 
She's forty years old if a 
day; 
And one morn when I 
saw her approaching, 
A 
trick I 
concluded to play. 
(

HE LOOKS MORE LITCP. 
HIS PA.— Concluded 
The old. torn cat I 
placed in the cradle, 
With the baby's white cap on his head; 
Miss Slimkins gazed at him quite loving, 
Then turning to me, thus she said : 
He looks more like his pa, etc. 
Miss Slimkins was greatly insulted, 
In fact she seemed dreadfully riled, 
When I 
threw the tom cat out the window, 
And produced from the next room the child. 
When good humor at last she'd recovered, 
With the " kid" on her lap down she sat, 
When all of a 
sudden, oh, 
horror ! 
But the baby he couldn't help that. 
SPOKEN.—Bright colors will always attract a 
child's at-
tention. 
Miss Slimkins wore on her bonnet a 
beautiful 
artificial nosegay, 
The youthful scion of the noble house 
of Dodge suddenly observed it. 
He made a 
quick grab, a 
vigorous yank, off came the old lady's bonnet, and off 
came her wig, leaving the top of her head as bare as the 
back of my hand. 
She grabbed the " kid " by one leg, 
fired him into the corner, snatched up her wig, slapped it 
upon her naked. head, and with eyes fairly glaring, she 
turned round to me, and exclaimed: 
He looks more like his pa, etc.

DON'T CRUSH THE POOR PEOPLE, 
BUT GIVE 
THEM A SHOW. 
Written by EDWARD AUSTIN. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR, with tremendous applause. 
IN 
the great game of life 
Where all play for gold, 
We know there are many 
Whom no trumps can hold; 
For the goddess of fortune, 
Of men makes a 
choice, 
And all whom she forms, 
Have cause to rejoice. 
To those fortunate men, 
A 
word I'll now say, 
Pleading for those whom 
Life's poor cards must play. 
With gold as a 
weapon, 
Strike no cruel blow, 
To crush the poor people, 
But give them a 
show. 
CHORUS. 
Then give them a 
helping hand 
Once and a 
while, 
Remember Dame Fortune 
On them does not smile ; 
Deal them out kind words 
Instead of a 
blow; 
Don't crush the poor people, 
But give them a 
show. 
( 
1 ) 
DON'T CRUSH THE POOR PEOPLE BUT GIVE 
THEM A SHOW.—Concluded. 
How often the rich man, 
When seated at ease 
Does think of the poverty 
Of all such as these. 
Why is it, I 
ask, 
He will close tight his purse ? 
Instead of a 
blessing, 
He will give him a 
curse 
His gold keeps him safe 
From starvation's flame ; 
Yet he thinks those who have none 
Are surely to blame. 
But I 
tell you the poor man 
Feels misfortune's blow. 
Don't add to his sufferings, 
But give him a 
show. 
Then give them, eta. 
Just think of some, cold night 
When angry winds roar 
And clamors so loudly 
At every one's door. 
When the white- drifted snow 
Lies heaped on the street; 
Swept here and there 
By the cold, blinding sleet ; 
Can the rich in their parlors 
Forget those who swarm 
Around dying embers, 
Their chilled limbs to warm ? 
Let us pray that some power 
Will teach them to throw 
Some aid to the poor men, 
And give them a 
show. 
Then give them, eta.

Oh, I'll meet you dar. 
Just show me a 
yellow gal, and I

Oh, I'll meet you dar.

SEE THAT MY GRAVE'S KEPT-. 
Sung by HALEY, W EST, and SPARKS BROTHERS. 
W HEN I've passed in my cheeks, little rosebud, 
When I'm six feet under the turf, 
I'll forgive, you though you took me for a 
sucker, 
And played me for every penny I 
was worth; 
You said I 
might ' look, but I 
musn't touch," 
And " you put me in quite a 
dilemma," 
But there's one little snap which I 
wish you would fake up, 
That's to see my grave is whitewashed every summer. 
Oh, the days will come to you, poison face, 
When you'll think of how you back-capped me when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off my grave with a 
pitchfork, will you, 
darling ? 
And decorate my grave with turkey breast, Thanksgiv-
ing ? 
Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember 
How you used to give me taffy on a 
stick; 
With your dizzy jokes you nearly paralyzed me, 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked ; 
I 
will meet you in that everlasting " By and By," 
Tra la lee, skip the sofa, you're my baby. 
Plant huckleberry trees on the next lot to me, darling, 
And see that my grave is kept shady ; 
Oh, my name will soon be Dennis, sweet Aleena. 
When you had a 
dollar I 
always stuck to you, 
Get a 
host of volunteers to play some kind of music, 
And see my grave is kept red, white and blue.

An original Song and Dance, performed with immense sacess by the 
DALY BROTHERS. 
Written by THOMAS DALY. 
In the summer when the birds begin to sing, 
And the pretty notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valley and the woodland ring, 
Down by a

In a

shady dell, 
There lives a 
fairy queen; 
She is the fairest maid there is beneath the sun, 
Is my Evangeline. 
CHORUS. 
In the summer when the birds begin to sing, 
And the pretty notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valley and the woodland ring,

Now of all the sweetest creatures in the land, 
Ever the sweetest one, yes, the dearest one; 
And I'll happy be whene'er I 
gain the hand 
Of my pretty sweet Evangeline. 
For she is such a 
belle, and always looks so well, 
And mine she'll surely be; 
I'm as happy as a 
king, or a 
bird upon the wing, 
And I 
sing and dance with glee.

F4 KICKING HORSE FLY. 
Written by S. LAWELL. 
Sung by LAww. and DREWS. 
THERE'S a 
terrible story which I'm going to tell, 
And I 
want you to listen to me : 
A 
bullfrog, a 
lobster, and a 
horsefly, they fell 
In a 
mud hole, and sang tra la lee. 
The bullfrog got hungry and tackled the fly, 
The lobster got angry and started to cry, 
When a 
speckled old hen came along that way, 
And hearing the clatter said, " What d'ye say ? " 
Now when Mr. Horsefly saw speckled Miss Hen - 
Talking in such a 
rude manner to them, 
He got on his ear and started to kick, 
When the lobster and bullfrog took very sick. 
The horsefly did kick at a 
terrible rate, 
He kicked out the frog which the old hen ate ; 
Oh, he kicked at the lobster with all his might, 
Then he kicked himself clear out of sight.

Oh, I 
once was happy all the day, and never knew a 
care, 
And my good old wife she wandered by my sick; 
Our little home was humble, but happiness was there,— 
'Twas the sweetest spot in all the world so wide. 
Now 'tis sinking to decay, and all is dark and sad, 
Ann I 
hear upon the roof the falling rain; 
E'en the banjo now is silent, that once made my heart so glad, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
Cho. — Ah, yes, I'm old and feeble now, eze. 
So 
totter to my journey's end, and try to do my best, 
Though I'm sad and weary-hearted all the day; 
The angels soon will call me, I 
soon will be at rest 
In that bright and happy home so far away. 
Still I 
linger by the door, and try to sing my song 
As I 
used to do among the sugar cane; 
And I'm waiting for the summons, and it soon will come along, 
To my little old log cabin in the lane. 
Cho.—Ah, yes, I'm old and feeble now, die. •

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
TEE woman was old and ragged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of the winter's day; 
The street was wet with a 
recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
She stood at the crossing and waited long, 
Alone, uncared for, amid the throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Nor heed the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Came the boys like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow pile white and deep. 
Past the woman so old and gray 
Hastened the children on their way, 
Nor offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So meek, so timid, afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or horses' feet 
Should crowd her down in the slippery street. 
At last came one of the merry troop— 
The gayest laddie of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
" 
I'll help you across if you wish to go." 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so, without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were firm and strong. 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content. 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
For all she's aged and poor and slow; 
And I 
hope some fellow will lend a 
hand 
To help my mother, you understand, 
" 
If ever she's poor and old and gray. 
When her own dear boy is far away." 
And " somtbody's mother" bowed low her bead 
In her home that night, and the prayer she said 
Was, " God be kind to the noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy ! "

Price 40 cents. 
W EAR de balmy air is sighing, and de roses catch de dew, 
And de mocking bird am singing in de trees, 
Dar's a 
charming, lubly city, and I'll ebber hold it true ; 
I 
was brought up ' mong its butterflies and bees ; 
In de pastures and de fields I 
libed de whole day long, 
But from all ob dent I'se been obliged to roam, 
And when I 
think ob happy times, de merry dance and song, 
I 
long to see my dear Savannah home. 
ciloaus. 
I 
long to see you once again, and feel de scented breeze, 
And tiff& dose sunny streets I 
long to roam ; 
I 
long to hear de mocking- bird a-singing in de trees 
Dat grow around my dear Savannah home. 
All de sweet magnolia blossoms dat was blooming in de lanes, 
And de gardens dat were loaded with perfume, 
All am dearer to dis darkey den de long and lebel plains, 
Ar.d dat' I 
always had enough ob room; 
When de shining moon at night was looking from de skies, 
Den we pushed de flat- boat from de ribber side, 
And down de rippling waters, whar de Fort Pulaski lies, 
Oar jolly dancing parties used to glide. 
I 
long to see, etc. 
But dose happy days are ober now, de boys hab gone away, 
And de collud gals am scatter'd o'er de land ; 
Oh, de times ain't what dey used to be when massa had his say, 
And each plantation had its nigger band. 
Near dat little cabin home, de place whar I 
was born, 
Dar's a 
quiet, lubly spot I'd like to see, 
'Tis whar (ley laid my rnudder down one pleasant summer morn 
While songsters sang a 
sad and plaintive glee. 
I 
long to see, etc. 
'When the moon is shining brightest, 
And the zephyrs soft ly blow; 
When the waves are beating lightest. 
Up the Avenue I 
go, 
And at the Parson's gate I 
met. 
The prettiest girl in town, 
I 
love to kiss thy ruby lips, 
Pretty little Dewdrop Brown. 
CHORUS. 
1Elo ! my little bonnie dear, 
The loveliest girl in town. 
flo! my little bonnie dear, 
The loveliest girl up town, 
1 
love thee mote from day, to days 
Pretty little Dewdrow Brown. 
Thou'rt always standing at the gate, 
By the cottage on the hill; 
To greet me with a 
happy smile, 
Thy soldier lover will. 
! 
amid the heat of battle, 
When the shells were bursting round. 
Did I 
hear thy merry prattle, 
Mr dear little Dewdrop Brown. 
Ho I 
my littk, etc.. 
Oh! thine eyes they are the brightest 
And thy voice so full of tnirth, 
That me thinks thou art a 
fairy, 
Who has visited this earth. 
Over all tlie world I've wandered, 
Never, never have I 
found, 
A Pen i

54 
;55 
Composed by HARRf BENNETT, and sung with sneeess by Brum 
CARTER. 
Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold! 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell; 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket book as well. 
CHORUS. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead 
With bald headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
He talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
He spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
He finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is he going for to do. 
Boys keep away, etc, 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash, 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half starved kids, 
I 
tell you it's no fun, 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, etc, 
Young fellows just take ray advice, 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
You think you're in clover till the honey-moon's over, 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
plaster on her nose, 
You'll find true love don't run so very smooth, 
When you have to wear your second hand clothes. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gun, 
While you vaccinate mother-in-law.

THAR'S A HAPPY LITTLE HOME. 
Words by HARRT BENNETT. 
Music by HARRY W OODSON'. 
THAR'S a 
happy little home, 
Down in Southern Tennessee, 
Whar the ivy blossoms twine around the door; 
And forever fresh and green 
In my memory it will be, 
Though I 
know I'll never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget the home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung; 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
CHORUS. 
Now the tambo and the bones are forever laid away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung, 
But I 
often heave a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days had come, 
I 
would husk the yellow corn, 
In the field I 
was singing all the day, 
And before they made me free, 
I 
had never cause to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay, 
And many, many a 
time, when the work of day was o'er, 
With my melody the old plantation rung; 
And my heart does often long for the happy days of yore, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
Now the flambe', etc. 
THE DAY I TRAVELLED WITH BARNUM'S 
SHOW.

original Irish Comic Song.

Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON 'I. DE 
Wm.% 
Mv name is Mike O'Hallahan, 
I 
am on the tight-rope and the slack- wire ; 
I 
travelled with Barnum's for thirteen years. 
Under the name of Signor McGuire. 
I 
threw double sommersaults on my ear, 
A 
hundred flip-flaps I 
can throw; 
I 
used to eat cannon balls for my dinner, 
When I 
travelled with Barnum's Show. 
CHORUS. 
I 
done a 
Highland fling on a 
horizontal bar, 
I 
killed a 
lion with a 
blow. 
I 
used to hide from the Sheriff in the elephant's trunk, 
When I 
travelled with Barnum's Show. 
I 
done the statue clog with the fat woman, 
And I 
learned the monkey to play the cornet, 
I 
slept in the cage with the animals, 
When it rained I 
got soaking wet. 
It was me that painted the tattooed Greek, 
And I 
want ye all to know, 
I 
was the greatest curiosity out, 
When I 
travelled with Barnum's Show. 
I 
done a 
Highland fling, sto.

success at TONY PASTOR'S. 
FAB away in the South, among the cotton fields. 
Is the place I 
ever long to see; 
Oh! the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
Oh! The mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a 
home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still; 
Then I 
sigh night and day, what I 
long to see again 
Is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh ! the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh ! the old man ain't what he used to be ; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Oh ! I 
-
will go back again, back to them cotton fields. 
In that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give me, etc.

I 
SING " Hurrah for our hearts of oak," 
And " Hurrah for the open sea," 
" 
Hurrah for our gallant sailors" too, 
Wherever they may be. 
Hurrah for our army, shout hurrah! 
And our valiant volunteers, 
Hurrah for the men who thrash the foe, 
Whenever he appears. 
CHORUS. 
For they are the men for me, my boys, 
They are the men for me; 
God save our land and bless the tried and true, 
For they are the men for me. 
Hurrah for the man with a 
dollar a 
day, 
And hurrah for the man with two, 
Hurrah for the man with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And who's got no work to do. 
Hurrah for the man with five hundred thousand ukltds, 
Whoever he may be, 
And hurrah for that man, if he makes his will, 
And leaves it all to me. 
CHORUS. 
Then he is the man for me, my boys, 
He is the man for me, 
If he left me ev'ry dollar, I'd ne'er be out of collar, 
So he'd be the man for me. 
Hurrah for the coon who never feels queer 
When he goes upon the sea, 
furrah for the party with a 
heap of poor relation; 
But who never a 
one does see ; 
Hurrah for the henpeck'd husband, who 
Don't wish he'd single tarried, 
And hurrah, hurrah, for the jolly old maid, 
Who doesn't wieli she'd been married. 
" HE IS THE MAN FOR ME."—Continued. 
CHORUS. 
59 
For she's the old maid for me, my boys, 
That's the old maid for me, 
Who don't want man to cheer her, or to come a 
little nearer, 
Then, that's the old maid for me. 
Hurrah for the man who never Irkk' d 
A " poor unlucky wight" when he is down; 
Hurrah for the man with a 
cheerful heart, 
Who hasn't got " a 
cheerful 
brown,' " 
Hurrah for the man who never backs 
A 
horse but what he wins, 
And hurrah, hurrah for the " honest working man," 
Who's the father of a 
half a 
dozen twins. 
CHORUS. 
For he's the man for me, my boys, 
He's the man for me; 
The friend of emigration and a 
surplus population, 
So he's the man for we. 
Hurrah for the wife who has always a 
smile, 
And who is not always wanting a 
new bonnet; 
Hurrah for the man with a 
jovial face, 
And a 
jolly good nose upon it; 
Hurrah, hurrah! for the dear, dear girls, 
May their charms be never less, 
And hurrah for the man who lends a 
helping hand 
To another in distress. 
CHORUS. 
For he's the man for me, my boys, 
He is the man for me, 
And if you like this lay, then I 
am bound to &ILA 
That you are the men for me.

DOWN beside the crimson meadow, 
Where the gushing strearnlet flows, 
There's a 
little bush of roses 
Blooming in their sweet repose. 
'Neath the pretty tinted blossoms, 
Sleeps an angel, once so fair, 
And above is spread a 
mantle 
Of the leaflets, made with care. 
Down beside the crimson meadow, 
Where the gushing streamlet flows, 
There my darling angel's resting 
In a 
calm and sweet repose. 
Dewdrops glisten on the hillock 
At the early dawn of day, 
Robins gather there and warble . 
Now and then a 
merry lay; 
Bluebells. buttercups and daisies 
Iii profusion grow around, 
Making, where my darling's sleeping, 
Cherished and most saintly ground. 
Down beside, etc. 
Morning zephyrs sweetly murmur, 
And the gentle evening breeze 
Makes a 
melody of beauty 
Rine throughout the cypress trees; 
There the whippoorwill at evening 
Echoes forth its usual cry, 
While the little chirping crickets 
Sing a 
doleful lullaby. 
Down beside, etc. 
Starbeams cast their soft reflection 
All the lonely hours of night, 
Shedding on her grave so pretty 
Gems of clearest silver Relit; 
And the gushing little streamlet 
Babbles near the grassy mound, 
Making ; where my darling's sleeping, 
Cherished and most saintly ground. 
Down beside, etc.
