WANDER'D to-day on the sea shore, 
The winds and the waves were low, 
And I 
thought of the days that are gone, Maud, 
Many long years ago; 
Alt 
those were the happiest days of all, Maud, 
Not a 
care nor a 
sorrow did we know, 
As we played on the white pebbled sand, Maud. 
Gathering up the shells from the shore.

(lathering up the shells from the sea shore 
Oatherin 6 ap the shells from the shore; 
Ahl those were the happiest, days of au, Maud, 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Oh, don't you remember the day, Maud, 
The last time we wander'd on the shore, 
Our hearts were so joyous and gay, Maud, 
For you promised to be mine evermore; 
Then the shells they were whiter than ever, 
And the bright waves were lovelier than before, 
The hours were but moments to us, Maud, 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Gathering up the shells, etc. 
But now we are growing up in years, Maud, 
Our locks are all silver'd and gray, 
Yet, the vows that we made on the shore, Maud, 
Are fresh in our merreries to- day; 
There still is a 
charm in those bright shells 
And the sound of the deep ocean's roar, 
For they call back the days that we spent, Maud, 
gathering up the shells from the shore.

STICK TO YOUR MOTHER,

POND & CO. 
The words and music of this song published by Wm. A. POND & CO„ 39 
Union Square, New York. 
Price 35 cents. 
How well do I 
remember, though many years ago, 
I 
journeyed & Will 10 Portsmouth, with my mother, you must. 
know; 
The ships were in the harbor, with flags and banners dressed, 
And weeping wives and children were waiting with the rest; 
My father was a 
sailor on board a 
man- o'- war, 
Who once again was going to leave us by the shore; 
He kissed our lips at parting, while standing on the quay, 
And as he bade us both good-bye, these word he said to me: 
CHORUS. 
Stick to your mother, Tom, when I 
am gone, 
Don't let her worry, lad, don't let her mourn ; 
Remember that she nursed you when I 
was far away; 
Don't leave your mother when her hair turns gray. 
Our hearts were dull and heavy, returning home again; 
We scarcely spoke a 
whisper while riding in the train. 
The journey seemed unending, and leaden was the sky, 
Until we reached the station where home was very nigh; 
The cottage looked so desolate, and vacant was the chair 
In which my father lingered whenever he was near. 
I 
came and stood by mother, so full of hope and fear; 
She fondled and carressed me, as she whispered through her 
tears, 
Stick to your mother, Tom, etc. 
The time rolled slowly onward, many changes had occurred, 
But of the good ship Victor, for months we had not heard. 
My mother grew so anxious, her cheeks were sad and pale, 
Anil I 
was very fearful she suddenly would fail. 
One day there came a 
telegram to say the ship was lost; 
She foundered many miles away, when she'd been tempest 
tossed. 
My mother fainted at the news, but when the swoon had fled, 
I 
kissed her as I 
told her of the words my father said— 
Stick to your mother, Tom, etc. 
(1) 
STICK TO YOUR MOTHER, TOM.— Concluded. 
She lingered thro' the summer, but when the frost and snow, 
The bitter winds of winter very quickly laid her low. 
She died in my einbraCeS, with a 
spirit calm and brave, 
And now the weeping willow bends silently o'er her grave. 
I 
often go to see her grave, and keep the verdure green, 
And plant sonic, spotless lilies upon the peaceful scene, 
And feel the the satisfaction of knowing, thoterli she's dead, 
I 
tried to do my duty to the words my father said— 
Stick to your mother, Toni, etc.

W HILST waiting in the lane for you, darling, 
Lingering as the hours roll by, 
Attracted by the rippling of the water, 
And the fragrance where the pond lilies lie. 
To gather seine I 
quickly thought 
You'd smile if them to you I 
brought; 
So take them with my heart's best love, 
As pure as heavenly things above. 
CHORUS. 
Ah ! pretty pond lilies I've plucked for you, 
Fresh from the waters, sparkling with dew; 
Take them from me as a 
token so true, 
Pretty pond lilies, I've brought tie ni to you. 
Tie, la, oh, he ho, oh', he ho, oh. lie lio; 
Tra la, oh, he ho, oh, he ho, he ho! 
11fy love shall ever be to you, darling, 
True as the water lilies pure ; 
So take them, dear, and cherish to your heart, love, 
Don't let your thoughts of me another lure. 
Oh, promise me, oh, pledge your word, 
That when I'm gone far, far away, 
You'll not forget, when with the loved ones, 
The lilies and the vows you've made to-day. 
Aim ! pretty pond lilies, etc.

PRA= 
TORN from home, Pm sad and weary, 
Far from scenes that once were blight; 
NVand'ring ' Death the sky so dreary, 
Pity the homeless one to-night! 
Darkly dawns for me the morrow, 
Coldly now the stars look down; 
Nothing left me but sorrow— 
I'm beneath Misfortune's frown! 
CHORUS. 
Torn from home, I'm sad and weary, 
Far from scenes that once were bright, 
Wand'ring, neath the sky so dreary— 
Pity the homeless one to-night. 
Gone for me the sounds of ,c.T,lauttess, 
Gone the joys that once I 
knew; 
Help, oh, help me in my sadness, 
Kindly hearts so good and true: 
Lonely in the cheerless city, 
Storms around me fiercely blow; 
Who will on me now take pity, 
While I 
wander to and fro ? 
Torn from home, eta. 
Beam no gentle smiles to cheer me; 
Once I 
gazed in eyes so fair I 
Dear and loving ones were near me; 
Now I've naught but wild despair! 
No soft mother- hands to bless me, 
No fond kiss at close of day! 
No wee darlings to caress me— 
Homeless, helpless, now I 
stray.

THE ITALIAN MOUNTAIN MAID. 
As sung with great success by JAMES GRAY. 
THERE is a 
pretty little maiden that I 
ever dearly love, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land ; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, I 
AV ould ask for nothing more, 
If she would share my heart and hand. 
For her father was a 
brigand on a 
lonely mountain passe 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell. 
There is no titled lady in all Europe can surpass 
The dear Italian girl I 
love so well. 
CHORUS. 
Her fatlpar was a 
brigand on the mountain. 
She is as gentle as the daughter of an earl, 
And sine-e 
she set me free, my heart will ever be 
A 
captive to the dear Italian girl. 
While roaming through the village 'neath the blue and 
sunny sky, 
A 
band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, put a 
bandage on my eyes. 
A 
victim I 
was quickly led along. 
Five thousand pounds as ransom they said that I 
should 
pay, 
But that I 
was not rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleading of this little mountain maid 
They would not have permitted me to live. 
Her father was, etc. 
They put me in a 
dungeon where I 
thought that I 
should 
die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his band, 
Was plundering poor travelers, this lovely maid came 
nigh 
At gloomy night and by my side did stand. 
She tore my bLn is asunder, bade me rise and set me free, 
And from her father's coffers saved my gold, 
And while the tears of love and pity gladdened in her 
eyes, 
The secret of or hearts was plainly told. 
Her father was, etc.

SWEET DORA DARE. 
The Musia of this song is published by W M. A FOND & CO, 547 Broad-
way, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
Words by ALBERT A. 
HILL. 
Music by CHAS. D. 
Blake. 
TIUPPING down the valley, skipping o'er the lea, 
Goes a 
little maiden just as fair as maid can be; 
Like a 
plume of raven is the bright sheen of her hair; 
Happy as a 
little queen is darling Dora Dare. 
Mocking all the song birds as they sweetly sing, 
hear the voice of winsome Dora through the valley ring; 
Waking sweetest echoes thro' the wildwood far and near, 
Waking love-born echoes in the hearts of all who hear. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Dora Dare, my darling Dora Dare; 
Dora with the lilies of the valley in her hair ; 
Darling little Dora, she's the fairest of the fair ; 
My heart it will go pit- a-pat at sight of Dora Dare. 
All the lads are sighing at fair Dora's feet, 
Happy for a 
week at one bright smile of hers so sweet; 
If they think she loves them just because she drops a 
smile, 
They'll soon know that Dora Dare was fooling them the while, 
What has passed between us, Dora Dare and I, 
Must be strictly confidential between you and I; 
When the summer comes again, my Dora Dare will wear 
Orange flowers with lilies of the valley in her hair. 
Sweet Dora Dare, etc. 
THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHILD. 
Sung by Tom DIXON, at the San Francisco Minstrels. 
" 
THE fisherman and his child are drowned !" 
Came ringing through the town ; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around. 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
" 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk- white sails I 
see." 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
CHORUS. 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard, 
As they sank in the deep : 
" 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep ; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep." 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild ; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair: " Thy will be done !" 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
And when the storm ceased the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore; 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore. 
Their fac,s were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
In death they found him there. 
(Repeat last two lines.)

The sad play of life is now past ; 
One more is nearing the dark, unknown shore, 
The moments are waning so fast! 
Far from the 'burden, the tumult and strife, 
While tears dimni'd each sorrowing eye; 
Sad was the whisper, the last words of life : 
"It's no use, God bless you! Good-bye! " 
CHORUS. 
"Ring down the curtain !" Oh, sweet be the sleep 
That waits the kind-hearted on high ! 
Fondly this mem'ry the heart now will keep ; 
"It's no use, God bless you, God bless you, 
good-bye !" 
" 
Ring down the curtain ! " no more shall we see 
The sweet smile so kindly and true ; 
Dim are the eyes that once sparkled with glee, 
The hopes that were bright as the dew! 
Dear is the vision that mem'ry recalls, 
To hearts that forever must sigh ; 
Sad is the echo that lingering falls : 
" 
It's no use, God bless you! Good-bye !" 
" 
Ring down the curtain !" etc.

AIR.—" Wait till the clouds roll by.” 
As sung by T ONY PASTOR. 
PEOPLE who laugh so loudly 
At all your jokes with glee, 
Call you a 
splendid fellow, 
Ask you up home to tea, 
Mothers that introduce daughters, 
Tailors that smile as you pass by, 
how these will strangely alter— 
Wait till your cash runs dry ! 
CHORUS. 
Wait till your cash runs dry, neighbor, 
Wait till your cash runs dry; 
If you would know your true friends, 
Wait till your cash runs dry. 
Policeman on the corner 
Will eye you very queer, 
Champagne will be a 
stranger, 
Water you'll sip for beer; 
Girls that once thought you charming 
When heaps of caramels you'd buy, 
now they will turn their nose up— 
Wait till your cash runs dry! 
Wait till your cash runs dry, etc. 
Mothers -
in-law detest you, 
And wives oft pout and scold, 
Ear- tenders look suspicious, 
Give you the shoulder cold? 
Folks won't have time to chatter, 
When you approach they'll quickly fly; 
Maybe you don't believe me— 
Wait till your cash runs dry! 
Wait till your cash runs dry, etc.

HE'S SUCH A LOVELY WALTZER.

SKELLY. 
HE 
takes me gently round the waist, 
He holds his arm just so, 
I 
place my willing hand in his, 
And gayly off we go; 
He's never weary of the dance, 
And I'm about the same, 
And when the music sounds no more, 
I 
cry, Oh, what a 
shame! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, indeed, I'm quite sorry when the dance is 
over; it seems like waking from a 
sweet little sleep. 
Of course 
my Charlie is the whole cause of it—everybody is aware of 
that—because you know— 
ClIORLTS. 
He's such a 
lovely waltzer, 
So graceful he can go, 
Oh, he's such a 
lovely waltzer, 
My darling, dancing beau! 
Around the floor with many more, 
We go in wild delight; 
We think of nothing but the dance. 
While in the mazy flight; 
We seem to float upon the air, 
Like angels from above, 
And everywhere we take our share 
Of music, dance, and love. 
SPOKEN.—Under some circumstances it might not seem so 
delightful, but with him it's—well, you can guess now nice it is 
when I 
say— 
He's such, etc.

A 
15 , 
nws SUCH A LOVELY WALTZER.—Continued. 
I 
can't endure those old quadrilles, 
And reels—oh, gracious, don't, 
Don't speak of them ; if you insist, 
I 
plainly say I 
won't; 
I'm far above those worn out things, 
They're much too full of halts; 
No dance to me can ever bring 
Such pleasure as the waltz. 
SPOKEN — And he's such a 
glorious fellow I Sometimes when 
the dance is over he says," Come, love, and have some soda water. 
You like soda water, I 
suppose ?" I 
tell him I 
do like it very 
well. 
Then he says, "Soda I !" 
And if there happens to be a 
bright moon looking down from the sky, he often tells me that 
he wonders which looks the most glorious, the moon or my 
eyes. 
I 
say, " Hush ! don't talk nonsense." 
But then I 
don't 
care what he says—my admiration is all based upon the fact 
that— 
lIe's such, etc. 
With mellow strains from jolly Strauss, 
And gleaming lights around, 
Our forms entwined, our joy combined, 
We hear the gladsome sound; 
We think no more of worldly woe, 
While quickly flies the time; 
The music comes so soft and low, 
I 
think it quite sublime. 
SPOKEN.—Sublime, did I 
say 1 Yes, that's just the word. I 
may seem a 
little enthusiastic ; but I 
can't help it I It's all be-
cause— 
He's such, etc,

THERE are songs unsung in ev'ry heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded, and withered, and dead— 
Oh ! beautiful songs unsung.

There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and cherish. 
Tho' some are sombre and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clung, 
They are set in tears and never can die— 
Oh ! sorrowful songs unsung. 
Beautiful songs unsung, etc. 
There are songs unsung. there are words of love, 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad, wild dream, 
Cherished and loved, yet broken. 
And, oh ! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kissed by death— 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung.

I 
WON 
HER HEART AT BILLIARDS—Concluded. 
Our host one lovely daughter had, 
Who dearly loved the game, 
Sometimes she'd join us with the cue, 
And set our hearts a 
flame; 
She'd oft with winning grace declare, 
While watching us at play, 
That he who proved himself the best, 
Would win her heart some day. 
Cno.-Oh I 
the game, &c. 
I 
do believe that each of us, 
hind in his turn proposed, 
To wed this little maiden fair, 
Who feigned to be opposed; 
Till she at last with firm resolve, 
Gave us to understand, 
That he who at a 
game scored most, 
Might claim her heart and hand. 
Cno.-Oh! the game, &c. 
No sooner was it said than done, 
Each man was handicapped, 
To strive his best, to win the prize, 
To which his heart was wrapt; 
The time arrived, the tournament, 
Was fought with cue and ball, 
But I 
came out victorious, 
And fairly beat them all. 
Cuo.-Oh! the game, &c. 
With smiles as bright as sunshine, she 
Applauded my success, 
And fondly leaning on my arm, 
Returned my glad caress; 
And never from that very day, 
Do I 
the game regret. 
But always look on Billiards, with 
A 
love I 
can't forget. 
Cno.-Oh the game, &c.

OH! Dan Mulligan is a 
man 
Of great fame and renown, 
His name it is a 
househeld. world 
In the country and town ; 
At his breakfast last Tuesday morn 
To his fond wife he said, 
"Cordelia dear, next Monday night 
We'll have a 
masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, he ripp'd up the carpet, 
Took chromos off the wall, 
And greas'd the floor with tallow, 
Piled the beds in the hall ; 
He order'd pots of chowder, 
Washtubs of lemonade, 
Invited all the neighbors 
To ' tend the masquerade. 
At nine o'clock Dan rung a 
bell, 
They all lept in the room, 
With black masks on their pale faces, 
On their shoulders a 
broom ; 
With sweet Cordelia on his- arm 
Dan led the promenade ; 
'Twas then the fun began oh, oh, 
At Dan INIulligan's masquerade. 
Now Dan wore his short leg trousers 
And slippers on his feet, 
Cordelia in her snow white robes, 
Begorra, she look'd neat, 
And the blackbird Mrs. Allup, 
Dress'd as the Queen of May. 
Recited poor ' Shamus O'Brien," 
'lae guests did hooray.

DAN MULLIGAN'S 
MASQUERADE.—Concluded. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, Lemmons as a 
leapfrog 
Jump'd in the chowder pot, 
Dan pulled him out by the hair, 
And laid him on a 
cot; 
With a 
clothes-line they tied him 
On the tailor's humpback, 
And as he ran round the room 
All hands hit him a 
whack. 
Tommy Fain, in skin-tight pants, 
Danced the Society 
With big, fat Mrs. Lochmuller, 
How nice they dipp'd their knee ; 
The great Walsingham McSweeney, 
Beside the keg he stayed, 
Singing Tom Moore's sweet melodies 
At Dan Mulligan's masquerade. 
At two o'clock they had supper 
In the back yard below; 
Rebecca pa,ss'd the grub around, 
All hands " fill'd in," you know, 
And all at once they heard music 
Down in the alleyway ; 
'Twas the " Full 111oons " in full dress came, 
Their compliments to pay. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, Mulligan receiv'd them 
With a 
shower of red bricks ; 
The nagurs drew their razors, 
The lads fought with hay-sticks ; 
Mrs. Dublin scaled the fence, 
But a 
nail caught in her dress ; 
There she hung calling for help, 
A widdy in distress. 
Captain Primrose on a 
shutter 
Was carried home to die, 
Dan Mulligan in a 
handcart 
Bid Cordelia good-bye ; 
Some had lame legs, others black eyes, 
Troth, all hands dearly paid 
For all the pleasure that they had 
At Dan Mullig,.an's masquerade.

WHEN THE TIDE COKES IN. 
Words by H. Asirr,ANTD K EAN% 
Music by H. M ILLARD. 
HE 
sailed away at break of day, 
The skies were blue and fair, 
He kissed his bonnie hand to me, 
With heart as light as air; 
"Hark ye," he cried, " go watch the tide, 
As it cometh up to Lynn, 
For, foul or fair, I 
will be there 
When the flowing tide comes in !" 
I 
watch'd the clouds that came in crowds. 
Like flocks of evil birds, 
My heart sank low with bitter woe, 
Rememb'ring Donald's words; 
'Oh, God !" I 
cried, and none beside 
Knew the grief my heart within, 
" 
Oh ! give me back my bonnie lad, 
None else my love can win I 
Oh! give me back my bonnie lad, 
When the flowing tide comes in."

THE shoemaker sat amid wax and leather, 
With lapstone over his knee ! 
Where, snug in his shop, he defied all weather; 
Drawing his quarters and sole together, 
A 
happy old man was he. 
This happy old man was so wise and knowing, 
The worth of his time he knew ; 
He bristled his ends, and he kept them going, 
And felt to each moment a 
stitch was owing 
Until he got round the shoe. 
Of every deed that his wax was sealing 
The closing was firm and fast ; 
The prick of his awl never caused a 
feeling 
Of pain to the toe, and his skill in healing 
Was perfect and true to the last. 
Whenever you gave him a 
foot to measure, 
With gentle and skillful hand 
He took his proportions with looks of pleasure, 
As if you were giving the costliest treasure, 
Or dubbing him lord of the land, 
And many a 
one did he save from getting 
A 
fever, a 
cold, or cough, 
For many a 
foot did he save from wetting, 
When, whether in water or snow 'twas setting, 
His shoeing would keep them off. 
When he had done with his making and mending, 
With hope and a 
peaceful breast, 
Resigning his awl, and his thread was ending, 
He passed from his bench, to the grave descending, 
As high as a 
king to rest.

On ! some may sing of sweet moselle, 
Or topaz, sherry claret, port ; 
For common wines they'll do quite well, 
But as for me, they're not the sort. 
Fill me a 
bumper to the brim 
Of Piper Heidsieck, sparkling gay, 
And every care and shadow dim 
Will take the hint and fly away, 
CHORUS. 
Heidsieck, yes, Piper Hetdaiedi 
That is the wine, boys, bumper divine, boys. 
Heidsieck, yes, Piper Heidsieck ! 
That is the wine, boys, the wine for me I 
For Rhine wine some may have a 
taste, 
And some may fancy other brands; 
But as for me when on a 
spree, 
The wine I 
drink unrivalled stands. 
It softly climbs up td my brain, 
And sings for me the sweetest songs; 
While all the joys of life again 
Come flocking 'round in fairy throngs! 
Heidsieck, ete. 
(1 ) 
Oh, 'tis the wine I 
love to drink, 
It keeps me merry all the year I 
What joy to see its bubbles wink 
Like diamond eyes we love so dear. 
Take whiskey, brandy, if you choose, 
No pleasure in the draught I 
see ; 
But, oh, to drive away the blues 
It's Piper Heidsieck, boys, for me! 
Heidsioch, etc. 
It makes you every pain forget, 
It makes the darkest day so bright; 
The only draught I've seen as yet 
To tempt a 
fellow's appetite. 
Tho' cocktails are the style at morn 
When heads are dizzy, very queer, 
The drink to take when you are gone 
Is Piper Heidsieck sparkling clear I 
Heidsieck, yes, Piper Heidsieck, 
That is the wine, boys, bumper divine, boys. 
Heidsieck, yes, Piper Heidsieck, 
That is the wine, boys, the wine for me !

A ROW OF TENEMENT HOUSES. 
Originally sung by the swell comedians, N iis and Ev.ozs. 
Air—" Blue Alsatian Mountains." 
IN 
a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair ; 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and fair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day, 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing! 
Just to hear that maiden sing. 
Oh, he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurral hurra! hurra! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trousers 
For the dog to chew that day.

My sweetheart's a 
shy little fairy, 
Her age it is just seventeen, 
Her parents think"that she's too airy. 
But a 
sweeter girl never was seen. 
At night she steals out from the cottage, 
Her mother cries after her " Kate," 
She answers, " Dear Ma, I'm not going far, 
I'm just going down to the gate! 
CHOICCS. 
I'm just going down to the gate, dear Ma, 
Just down to the old garden gate. 
The moon is so bright, and its such a 
nice night, 
I'll just go as far as the gate. 
Of course at the gate I 
am waiting, 
And sweet are the words that we say, 
While inside the old folks are debating, 
As to whether they'll move first of May. 
Sometimes they call gently for Katie: 
She answers, " Dear Ma, 'tis not late, 
There's no sign of a 
storm, and the night is so warm, 
I 
love to stand here by the gate! 
I'm just going down, etc. 
They say she's too young to be married,— 
But with them we do not agree; 
Love's message to Katie I 
carried, 
And a 
kiss was the answer for me. 
We'll wander alone in the moonlight,— 
Much longer I'm sure we can't wait— 
Some night, by and by, to the preacher we'll fly, 
When Katie CODAS down to the gate! 
I 
am just going-dovrn, &e.

These were the last words of " Americus," the well-known child violinist, 
seven years of age, who expired very suddenly during the night of January 
lOtti, 1874, in Boston 
So quietly did his spirit take its flight, that his 
father, who occupied the same room, although hearing his son make the 
foregoing exclamation, thought the boy was talking in his sleep, and was 
lif.rrified to find the little child, cold in death, in the morning.

" 
Goon night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet

Like a

And a 
smile came o'er his features radiant with holy joy, 
As if angels came to whisper tidings to our little boy.

Came a 
halo soft and lustrous, streaming- o'er the window bar; 
And we heard our darling murmur, as the brightness lit his face, 
" 
Please God, make me room in Heaven, make your little boy a 
place !" 
" 
Good night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close. 
" 
Good night, father !" etc. 
iHe was weary of the struggle, discords jarred upon his soul ; 
And his gentle spirit left us, wafted to the heavenly goal ; 
He has room among the angels. he is freed from sin and care; 
God, who watched' e'en the sparrow, answered little Jimulie'e 
prayer. 
" 
Good night, father !" said our darling, as he sank to sweet re-

W HY did the angels take mamma away, 
Leaving me here in my sorrow to pine, 
Clouding my life that was once bright as May, 
Taking the love of my mother divine ? 
Weary I 
wander in search of a 
friend, 
Seeking a 
shelter to cover my head ; 
No one to help me my life to defend, 
Sometimes I 
almost could wish I 
were dead.

Clouding my life that was once bright as May, 
Leaving me here, only sorrow is mine. 
Why did the angels take mamma away ? 
Were there not angels enough in the sky ? 
Why did they leave me alone here to stay, 
Helpless and needy and ready to_ die ? 
Why don't the angels come take me there too ? 
Mother would open the beautiful gates, 
'Twas she that lov'd me so fondly and true, 
Now gone to heaven where happiness waits. 
Why did the angels, etc. 
Why did the angels take mamma away, 
Leaving her child here so helpless below ? 
Could they not spare her awhile here to stay ? 
Then naught but joy my poor heart would know. 
Will not the angels give place there for me ? 
Can I 
not go home with dear mother, too ? 
I 
am so weary and long to be free; 
Angels come take me to mother so true. 
Why did the angels, etc.

Music published by C. H .

THE songs my mother loved to sing, 
Could I 
but hear them once again ; 
To childhood's memories still they cling, 
They soothed ev'ry ache and pain ; 
Ah ! how sweet they used to seem, 
How they made my heart rejoice ; 
Years, long years, seem but a 
dream, 
Still I 
hear my mother's voice. 
CHORUS. 
Childhood's days to me so dear, 
Sweetest recollections cling ; 
How I 
often long to hear 
The songs my mother loved to sing. 
Those sweet and simple little songs, 
Songs I 
loved so well to hear ; 
How they'd heal my childish wrongs, 
How they'd seem to please and cheer. 
Songs in memory buried deep, 
Songs that oft put me to rest, 
Songs that closed my eyes in sleep, 
Lying on my mother's breast. 
Childhood's days, etc. 
Every simple little strain 
Calls to mind some happy scene, 
Brings up childhood's days again, 
Days to me yet fresh and green. 
Better far than glittering gold, 
Greater far than crown of king, 
Dearer far than wealth untold, 
The songs my mother loved to sing. 
Childhood's days, etc.

He has servants, tradesmen, carriages, and animals beside, 
From thorough-breds to coach-horses, and hacks to take a

He said it made him vewy ill, and was a

He has the very best cigars, but never takes a

He lights, and looks at them, and thinks that's quite enough; 
He seldom takes a 
glass of wine—his friends his bottles drain— 
In short, the thing's inanimate, as if it had been slain; 
When having ventured on a

If that his friends enjoy themselves, he thinks it's jolly fun; 
lle has no judgment, can't reflect, appreciate or praise, 
He was unfortunately born, and so must end his days, 
'Without one wholesome thought of joy, past, present, or in store, 
There's nothing in this lovely world, but what's a

Oho.-011, yes, a 
perfect bore, yes, a

WHAT WOULD MAMMA SAY ? 
OR, GET ALONG, JUSEPIL

st., Boston.

Now some girls are bashful, 
And others are bold; 
Now I 
knew a 
charmer 
Of nineteen years old; 
About her, like some others, 
There was much pretence, 
For, at the least thing, 
she'd be sure to commence (with her) 
cnoixs. 
Oh, my, fie, for shame, 
What would mamma say ? 
What would papa say ? 
011, my, fie, for shame, 
Get along, Joseph, do. 
I'd take her about 
To wherever she'd please; 
When we were alone 
She'd appear ill at ease; 
Now a 
kiss once a 
week 
Every fellow'd expect, 
But when I 
tried for one, 
She'd be sure to object, ( with her) 
Oh, my, ete. 
Her pa and her ma 
Out of town chanced to be, 
So I 
called on my charmer,-
And with her took tea; 
The time like a 
slow 
Quaker's meeting did pass, 
Till she somehow by accident 
Turned out the gas. 
SPOKEN.—There we were all in the dark. 
I 
was afraid to 
move for fear of breaking something, and she couldn't or 
wouldn't find the matches. 
When she found I 
didn't move, she 
said— 
She seemed oh, so awfully 
Coy and demure, 
That I 
thought her complaint 
Only marriage would cure;

Oh, my, etc.

WHAT WOULD MAMMA SAY ?—Continued. 
So I 
asked " If she'd wed 
Did she think she would die ? 
She pretended to faint, 
But her only reply was— 
Oh, my, eta. 
Now I 
found out this bashful 
And timid young lamb 
Was simply a 
con-
Glom-er-a-tion of sham; 
To two other parties 
Her kisses were free; 
Perhaps she had one of them, 
But she didn't " have me," ( with her)

And thought of the gladsome past;

have sighed to press the hand 
That lingered in mine the last ; 
Sad I 
have been at night and day, 
Far away from those I 
adore; 
But homeward affain I

ON 
a 
cold winter's evening, when bus'ness is done, 
And to your home you retire, 
What a 
pleasure it is to have a 
bright bouncing boy, 
One whom you love to admire ; 
You bug him, aid kiss him, you press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' twill bring ! 
Then you place him on the carpet, and you'll hide behind 
the chair, 
And to please him you'll commence to sing: 
CHORUS. 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! 
Come from behind the chair ; 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! 
I 
see you hiding there, 
Oh! you rascal, there. 
Oh, my hearer 
ways light when at home with my wife, 
There joy and peace ever reign ; 
With my boy on my knee I'm as happy as can be, 
I

lie's pretty, he's gentle, he's kind and he is good, 
And ev'rything nice him I

PARODY ON PEEK-A-BOO. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
ON 
a 
cold winter's morning about three o'clock, 
When you are snoozing so sound, 
What a 
pleasure it is to have a 
nice squalling brat 
Waking the neighbors around. 
You scold him, you spank him, you walk the floor in rage, 
Your wife calls you ‘• cross ugly thing," 
Then par 
one bottle and the catnip you don't spare, 
While to hush him you'll commence to sing: 
CHORUS. 
Peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo, do stop your squalling there, 
It's too bad, I'll go mad, scream again if you dare; 
Oh, you villain ! 
Peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo, shivering here's no joke; 
Shut your mouth, drat the brat, wonder he doesn't choke. 
Then lie makes you so happy when business is done; 
lip on your lap he will climb, 
And you'll have all your hair in just the prettiest way 
Filled with molasses and lime. 
Your necktie he'll chew up and put pins in your chair, 
Which makes you jump up with a 
spring; 
Then he'll dance upon your bosom, till you send him up to bed, 
And he bawls and you commence to sing: 
Peek-a-boo, etc. 
Then it's nice when your napping some nice afternoon; 
I Up to your side be will come, 
And he'll cover your nose with all the ink he can find, 
Gouge out your eye with his thumb. 
YJI1 scold him, you pet him, it isn't any good, 
Your watcl , out the window he'll flinlx: 
If you wallop him, your mother-in-law will make it hot for you, 
Then to please him you'll commence to sing: 
Peek-a-boo. etc.

A 
TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say,

The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair,

sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here!"

lie pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh;

And dried the falling tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here !"

I 
wish mamma," etc.

Until the turn of tide,

And Willie breathed his last fond sigk,

know mamma is here !"

CAN'T MAKE IT OUT, CAN YOU ?

M Y 
name is Joe Slyeove, I'm not quite a 
fool, 
Nor yet am I 
cramful of knowledge, 
I 
was not brought up at a 
grand boarding school, 
And I've never been inside a 
college; 
I'm a 
kind of philosopher tho' in my way, 
As the journey of life I 
go through, 
And the strange things we hear of and see ev'ry day. 
I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
CHORUS. 
No, I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
The queer things I 
see quite mystifies me, 
And I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
Now I 
know a 
party, some call him a 
swell, 
For his style is so heavy and grand, 
You'd think him the Marquis of Hanover Square, 
Or some other " big pot" of the land ; 
He follows the fashion, drinks " champy " and drives 
His girl down to Richmond or Kew, 
Yet he's only a 
clerk upon sixty a 
year, 
Now I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
No I 
can't make it out, etc. 
Moderation in drink is a 
thing I 
admire, 
But total abstinence—all bosh !

Now I 
know of one who won't touch beer or grog 
And tells me my small drinking I'll rue, 
While her nose is as red as the sun in a

I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
No I 
can't make it out, etc. 
And the dear darling girls 
ho go sailing along, 
(Some " impertinent " folks call them Guys) 
What with pads on their heads and humps on their backs 
They appear quite a 
glorious size; 
But when they dismantle, oh dear what a 
sell 
As soon as the truth comes to view, 
You find there's more shadow than substance, my friends, 
And. I 
don't care for that much, do you ? 
No I 
can't make it out, etc. 
There's a 
neighbor of mine sells new milk from the cow, 
And new milk from the cow's very nice ; 
His trade is but small, whilst his family's large, 
And his milk is sold at a 
low price. 
I've ne'er seen nor heard one of his cows, I 
declare, 
Tho' he represents he's got a 
few, 
And somehow his pump's always out of repair, 
Now I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
No I 
can't make it out, etc. 
Now I 
trust you're not tired and wish me away, 
For I 
am not myself in the least, 
But I 
think for the present I've gossiped enough, 
And enough is as good as a 
feast. 
Without any scandal I 
give you my thoughts 
Upon things as they seem to my view, 
And if in my song there is anything wrong, 
I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
No I 
can't make it out, etc.

THAT'S HOW YOU GET SERVED WHEN 
YOU'RE OLD, 
W ritten and composed by JoHN READ. Sung by DAN NASH.

New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
ONE day in the street, I 
just happen'd to meet 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man looked sad, tho' to meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke 
with tears. 
I 
said, " John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief 7 
To me your misfortunes unfold." 
Said he, " In poor me, you a 
sample may see 
Of how a 
man's served when he's old." 
CHORUS. 
"Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
"I began as a 
lad, and a 
hard place I 
had, 
Which I 
held for some forty-five years; 
I've worked like a 
slave, yet no money could save, 
And now I 
may starve it appears. 
What I've had to endure is hard I 
am sure, 
Now by the young master I'm told 
I 
must no longer stay, but for others make way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
Each day growing, etc. 
" 
When young I 
was praised and my wages were raised, 
No labor I'd ever then shirk, 
And master would then point me out to the men 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak, 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They sitnply make fun of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
Each day growing, etc. 
" 
My wife, poor soul ! she is near seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know, 
If I 
beg I 
intrude, by plice am pursued, 
And if to the work-house we go 
To seek for relief, they but add to our grief, 
You must come in the house,' we are told. 
Part husband from wife to be paupers for life. 
That's how you get served when you're old."

On, my love stood under the walnut tree, 
Over the garden wall. 
She whispered and said she'd be true to me, 
Over the garden wall. 
She'd beautiful eyes and beautiful hair, 
She was not very tall, so she stood on a &jail 
And many a 
time I 
have kissed her there. 
Over the garden wall. 
CHORUS. 
Over the garden wall, 
he sweetest girl of all, 
There never was yet such eyes of jet, 
And you may be I'll never forget 
The night our lips in kisses met, 
Over the garden wall. 
But her father stamp'd, and her father raved, 
Over the garden wall, 
And like an old madman he behaved, 
Over the garden wall. 
She made me a 
bouquet of roses red, 
But immediately I 
popped up my head, 
He gave me a 
bucket of water instead, 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the garden wall, 
And she bravely promised to be my bride, 
Over the garden wall. 
But she screamed in fright, " Here's father, quick! 
I 
have an impression he's bringing a 
stick ;" 
But I 
brought the impression of half a 
brick 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc. 
But where there's a 
will there's always a 
way, 
Over the garden wall. 
There's always a 
night as well as a 
day, 
Over the garden wall. 
We hadn't much money, but weddings are cheap, 
So while the old fellow was snoring asleep, 
a 
lad and a 
ladder she managed to creep 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden waD, eta.

JUST BEHIND THE SCENES. 
As sung by Gus Wmaams.

York. 
Price 10 cents. 
W HEN but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy, 
To visit the Theatre I'll admit. 
How happy I 
could be, the performances to see, 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have pass'd beyond my teens, 
I 
begin to understand, tho' in front it may look grand, 
'Tis very ditrrent just ' Behind the Scenes." 
So if you will attend for a 
moment now, my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to- night, tho' in front it may look bright, 
'Tis very diff'rent just ' Behind the Scenes." 
The comedian is one who while causing lots of fun. 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breaft 
And the man who plays the king, tho' it seems a 
curious 
thing, 
In private may be very poorly drest. 
The Ladies too—so fair, who go floating through the air, 
And look like little angels there instead, 
Sometimes have to roam unto a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed ; 
While those who play the parts of the men with stony 
hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends, 
Could you see them while away, you'd very likely say, 
They're the mildest looking men " Behind the Scenes 
'Tis just the same in life, for what lots of care and strife, 
And sc._:.ering some folks will undergo, 
Just to cat a 
shine, and to make themselves look fine, 
And think of nothing else but outside show; 
(1)

JUST BEHIND THE SCENES.—Concluded. 
They fancy and sppose that those who wear good clothes 
Always look the richest and the best; 
But an honest heart and mind is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether poor or richly drest. 
Still many one you know have caused themselves much 
woe, 
Through trying hard to live beyond their means, 
And though they wear a 
smile, yet really all the while 
They are very wretched just " Behind the Scenes." 
There's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind, 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very different state of things you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who's the cause of all the strife ; 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame, 
Let that be how it may who causes all the fray, 
Their quarrelling continues just the same. 
Yet still they try to hide, from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jam with which their household teems, 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just " Behind the Scenes." 
The wealthy and the great, who can ride about in state, 
And have a 
host of wealth at their command, 
Have, you may be sure, as many troubles to endure 
As those who are the humblest in the land ! 
For England's greatest sage says all the world's a 
stage, 
And each of us endeavor, all our might, 
Our follies to conceal, and only to reveal 
That which is most pleasing to the sight. 
No matter where you go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry right up to kings and queens, 
Whatever they enjoy there's something to annoy, 
If we could only see " Behind the Scenes,"

I'VE a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
33ut there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly 
prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's 
days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my menfry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to 
sleep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave; 
For tht last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memory, etc.

JAKE DYER loved a 
handsome girl, Maria was her name, 
-And took her once to see New York, the country was so 
tame, 
And when she saw the Brooklyn bridge, which was way 
overhead, 
She ope'd her eyes with great surprise, and this is what 
she said— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, what a 
beauty Loh, what a 
beauty ! 
This is what Maria said unto Jake Dyer ; 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty 
I 
never saw the like before, Maria she did say. 
He took her then to Central Park the different things to 
see— - 
The lake, the mall, the statues and the great menagerie, 
And when she saw the bear stand up and lean upon a 
cane 
She grabbed his arm in great alarm and to him did ex-
claim--
Oh, what a 
beauty, etc. 
He took her then to Jerome Park to see the races there, 
The grand stand it was filled with men and women, oh 
so fair, 
And when she saw the tally-ho coach it nearly turned 
her head, 
And when they jumped the hurdle gates why this is what 
she said— 
Oh, what a 
beauty, etc. 
Now Jake felt awful when he found that his girl was so 
green, 
And started ere the race was over for to catch a 
train ; 
The people saw the hayseed sticking in Maria's head, 
They laughed and stood up in their seats, and this is 
what they said— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty ! 
This is what they holleed in a 
voice so solid; 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty ! 
I 
never saw the like baWe„ the people they did say.

WHEN THE ROBINS NEST AGAIN. 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS in the " American Four.” 
Alter piece. 
I 
WILL return, he saki to me; 
I 
will come back, my love, to thee; 
When nature smiles on land and sea, 
I 
will return again to thee. 
When the robins nest again, 
And the flowers are in bloom, 
When the springtime's sunny smile 
Seems to banish all sorrow and gloom, 
Then my bonny blue-eyed lad, 
If my heart is true till then, 
Has promised he'll return to me, 
When the robins nest again. 
Life seems so bright when in thought I'm with thee 
Come, love, hasten—come back to me; 
We'll build our nest with the robins in springtime, 
Donald! return, love, to me. 
CHORUS. 
When the robins nest again, 
And the flowers are in bloom, 
When the springtime's sunny smile 
Seems to banish all sorrow and gloom; 
Then my bonny blue-eyed lad, 
If my heart is true till then, 
Has promised he'll return to me 
When the robins nest again. 
Last night in a 
dream 
I 
saw his proud ship wrecked at sea. 
And I 
felt that my heart's dear 'Jove 
Could never come back to me. 
Bi:f. the springtime and robins will come, 
And with them the bravest of men, 
For his last words were, Darling, Fit meet you 
When the robins nest again.

I'VE wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn ; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain ; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the good old days Pre pass'd and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vam ; 
I-want to see the cotton fields 
And the dear old lionie again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When ray days are very few, 
My wife and children both Are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do ; 
Old master too, he may be &alai, 
His hair was turning gray ; 
Oh, let me see that good old homo 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, eta. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was fill'd with pain ; 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
Oh, the good old days, etc. 
LOOK OUT FOR PA! 
Words and music by FRANK DUMONT, specially for H.uts* Pungeolt-
LIKE many young girls I'm troubled with beaux, 
Who often will stroll to our gate; 
But pa is so queer that he will not allow 
My charmers to linger too late; 
He threatens them all, in spite of my tears, 
I'm afraid that he'll drive them away, 
So I 
steal to the gate and a 
warning I 
give 
In a 
whisper I 
cautiously say— 
CHORUS. 
Look out for pa! Look out for pa! 
Pa may be watching from a 
room overheat; , 
Look out for pa! don't come too far, 
Wait till the old folks have gone up to bed. 
Charles is the nicest of lovers who call, 
I'm afraid he's too reckless and bold; 
He swings on the gate, and it makes such a 
noise, 
But all I 
can do is to scold. 
His arms are too free, for he holds me so tight, 
And I 
try hard to struggle away ; 
He kisses me, too ; now what can I 
do, 
But to whisper and angrily say— 
Look cut for pa, etc

I MET her at a 
ball 
As beautiful as day. 
Of graceful figure, slight and tall, 
And hair like golden spray. 
I 
said this is a 
happy chance, 
And I'm a 
happy man, 
And as I 
led her out to dance 
She laughed behind her fan. 
CHORUS. 
She laughed behind her fan, 
And said " You naughty man, 
You shouldn't do so, it's wrong, you know I" 
And laughed behind her fan. 
We danced the Lancers and Quadrille, 
Then rested for a 
while, 
But once we nearly had a 
spill, 
Through snme one's clumsy style. 
I 
clasped her waist more tightly then, 
'Twas neat and sweet to span, 
And when her eyes met mine again, 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed, eta. 
I 
saw her to the carriage door, 
When it was time to leave, 
I 
fancied, but I 
wasn't sure, 
She slightly pressed my sleeve, 
I 
squeezed her hand, the old resource, 
The good old-fashioned plan, 
And as she felt the gentle force 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed, eta 
I 
saw her in a 
month or so, 
One Christmas party night, 
And then beneath the mistletoe 
I 
claimed the season's rite. 
She said " Oh, dear ! my husband's here, 
I'm sure you never can !" 
And I 
felt queer, for much I 
fear 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed, , to.

Beside the stream that murmurs sweet and low, 
in the nook we've known since childhood, Essie dear, 
Where sunbeams on the ripples come and go; 
Overhead the birds are singing in the trees, 
While their joyous carols echo through the dell; 
Where the violets are smiling in the breeze, 
There our happy, happy tale of love we'll tell.

Beside the stream that murmurs sweet and low, 
In the nook we've known since childhood, Essie dear,

Linger not, but haste to meet me, Essie dear ! 
Down where we've roamed in merry days " Lang dyne." 
I 
am waiting here to greet thee, Essie dear, 
For I 
long to hear you whisper " Ever thine."

I 
love you more than all the world beside, 
Ever true you've been in sorrow and in pain; 
You were the star my weary heart to guide, 
How I 
long to hear your winning voice again!
