The Fair CaptiveThey took her by stealth from her cradle bed,And away like a deer through the
forest fled,To their own wild haunts 'neath the branching trees;So swiftly they hastened through
the perfumed breeze.Where the tall shadows rest on the waving grass,And the moon looks down
from a sea of glass;Where the red sun sets with a fading beam,On the willowed banks of a mountain
stream.They smiled when they saw that her eyes were blue,Her cheeks like the delicate morning
hue,They soothed with kisses her falling tears,And they blithed with trinkets her childish fears.The
old chief took her to be his child,She grew like a young fawn, fleet and wild,A creature as fleet as
the fleeing fawn,That skims through the blades of the forest brown.With a voice as sweet as her
own tame dove,Who hummed in her presence his notes of love;And a face as fair as the fairest
flower,That grew in the nook of some secret bower.She loved her father, the aged chief;Her smiles
grew sad when he spoke of grief.She loved his son as a brother dear,She loved the stars and the
fountains clear.She loved all nature, but she did not knowThat her blood was as strained through
the drifted snow,She knew not that her's was the hated race,She thought that the moonbeams had
paled her face.But times have changed and the flag of peaceWas sent through the woods by the pale
faced race,And the Indians yielded their captive band,With a sullen gloom o'er the victor's hand.Her
parents remembered their long lost child,They gazed with joy on her features mild;They placed her a
star in their spacious hall,Her brow wore the beautiful coronetal. 2 2 of 2The Fair CaptiveA great man
sought her to be his bride,She plighted her troth but inly sighed,But the chieftain had taught her to
bend her willTo her father's wish, and her lips were still.The bridal morn came and the guests were
there,They waited in vain for the lady fair.But the spring bird had flown and a search was made,From
day to day in the forest shade.It was made for naught, till one sunset eve,As some of the searchers
were taking leave,They spied down by a fountain clearThe little robes of the missing deer.A tall form
bent o'er her lifeless clay,As they beckoned their hasty steps away,For they dared not intrude on
that sacred grief,They saw it was the son of the aged chief.They turned toward home, a sorrowing
band,They loved that fair flower from the rainbow land,And 'twas said that she died of a quenchless
thirst,For a home where the lovliest thought was nursed. 2 2 of 2

A great man ©sought her to be his bride,She plighted her troth but inly sighed,But the chieftain had
taught her to bend her will,To her father's wishes, and her lipas were still.The bridal morn came and
the guests were there,They waited in vain for the lady fair.But the spring bird had flown and a search
was made,From day to day in the forest's shade.
