[00:00] Intro: Peter Heleen was bom August 1, 1960 in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He is the 
only member of his family involved in the fishing industry besides a cousin who owns a 
scalloper. He became interested in working in maritime industry while spending time at his best 
friend’s boat repair business and with his neighbor, a chief engineer for the Woods Hole 
Steamship Authority. He attended Mass Maritime Academy, worked for Sanchez Marine 
Services, C.E. Beckman Company, then became purchasing manager at the Fairhaven Shipyard 
in 2013. 
[05:20] Describes early experiences that were influential in his career choice. Discusses typical 
day, the business of the shipyard, and purchasing items locally if possible. 
[11:41] Discusses searching for parts locally and his responsibilities for purchasing tools and 
equipment for the yard. 
[14:54] Talks about needing to know a little about a lot of things. One of his strengths is the 
mechanical aspect of his job. Discusses his role in providing estimates for customers and how he 
typically encounters delays in the ordering process. 
[20:29] Discusses some of the different personnel he works with. Discusses the stressors of the 
position and the fact that he enjoys his work. 
[25:11] Describes how he keeps track of things, his dislike of computers, and his preference for 
communication directly to vendors vs using email. 
[30:10] Discusses the strength of his relationships with the vendors. Although he often is 
ordering similar equipment, there really isn’t a “typical day”. 
[36:14] Describes how inventory is managed differently by suppliers now compared to twenty 
years ago. 
[40:56] Discusses personal aspects of the job and communication with boat owners. Also, 
describes the roles of his assistants in the two hauling yards. 
[44:50] Describes the challenges and the positive aspects of his job.

Fred Calabretta: This is an interview for the New Bedford Fishing Heritage Center, funded by an 
Archie Green Fellowship from the Library of Congress. As part of this project we are 
interviewing shoreside workers in the New Bedford Fairhaven fishing industry, to record their 
stories, document their skills and knowledge, and better understand their important role in the 
fishing industry. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at 
the Library of Congress. I am Fred Calabretta. Today I am speaking with Peter Heleen. It’s 
March 13, 2017 and we are at Fairhaven Shipyard in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. Okay, so again if 
you can just maybe start with your full name and date and place of birth. 
Peter Heleen: Okay. My full name is Peter Christopher Heleen. Bom 8/1/60 and bom in New 
Bedford, Massachusetts. 
FC: And grew up around here in New Bedford? 
PH: And was brought up in New Bedford, yes. 
FC: And was your family involved in the fishing industry or part of the waterfront at all? 
PH: Not at all. My, other than a cousin that owned a scalloper, he would be the only family 
member that was involved in any maritime industry whatsoever. My Dad was a bank appraiser 
and my mother worked at the STAR store in downtown New Bedford. So, no, I was the only one 
of five children that worked in the maritime industry. 
FC: And how did you get into it or get interested in it? 
PH: Well, somewhat of a long story, kind of two-fold. Growing up my best friend that I went to 
school with, elementary school, high school, his dad owned a small boat repair business, a small 
boatyard; worked on outboards and small motors. And then growing up my next-door neighbor 
was a chief engineer for the Woods Hole Steamship Authority. A retired Coast Guard, Coast 
Guardsman and back when I was twelve, thirteen, fourteen years old, I used to, he used to take 
me for rides back and forth on the Island Steamboats and that was back in the day when you 
could get, there were no regulations, they allowed people to carry passengers. And it was back 
then I really decided what I really wanted to do for a living. So, I worked at, oh a couple of 
different jobs but I did work at my friend's boatyard until his dad actually passed away. I did go 
to Mass Maritime Academy for marine engineering. Got involved in with working on tugboats; 
tugboats right in New Bedford Harbor. There was a company back then called Sanchez Marine 
Services, owned, oh, I think there were eight boats at their high point. They also owned the 
property over on Fish Island. I worked for them on a part-time business all while going through 
school and after school. And also worked another part time job while going to college. I worked 
for C.E. Beckman Company on the other side of the river. A marine supply company. At the 
time these were just jobs to make money while going to college. Got out of school, worked on 
all sorts of areas, tugboat sites. Worked for the Steamship Authority, the Woods Hole 
Oceanographic. All within working on vessels and different tug companies and things of that 
nature. 
Peter Heleen interview, March 13, 2017

FC: And so what years were that roughly? 
PH: ‘78 to ’81 I went to Mass Maritime and then worked for my, kind of worked for my 
friend's, you know dad. For, we were twelve, thirteen year old kids. Hey, if you paint that boat 
you can take my boat out tonight. So I've been involved with boats for a real long time. Ended 
up getting involved full time in a parts industry. I'm the yards purchasing manager. Again, I 
worked on a part time basis mostly in between shipping jobs for C.E. Beckman Company, which 
was a wholesale marine supplier. Went to work for them fulltime in 1999. Managed one of their 
departments for them and came to Fairhaven Shipyard at the beginning of 2013. So I've worked 
here a little over four years as purchasing manager. 
[05:20] FC: So those experiences, those early experiences, around boats and stuff it seems like it 
kind of got in your blood. I mean, it is something you liked. 
PH: Oh, I think I knew probably at thirteen or fourteen years old what I wanted to do for a 
living. I did do commercial sword fishing. I did take a couple of trips with Lawson Fisheries 
from the Vineyard and tried that. Learned that was a self-induced prison sentence for thirty days 
or so but I did it anyway. And essentially yeah. I've worked mostly around the engineering, 
engine room or mechanical departments on vessels my whole life. So. 
FC: So, you are comfortable with sort of the technical side of things and the, like you said the 
mechanical stuff 
PH: Correct. Correct. Yeah, I've always worked engine related type products or the mechanicals 
of the vessel. 
FC: And some of the different, you know you mentioned Mass Maritime and some of the 
different jobs you had. Were there certain jobs or certain people that really, really gave you good 
experience in particular? Where you look back on and you say boy that was really valuable? 
PH: Well, I can tell you I learned more... there’s probably three or four people over my late 
teens early twenties that taught me a tremendous amount of mechanical, mechanical things. I 
worked for, with a couple of old engineers, old ex merchant marine engineers, while working for 
Beckman’s. They taught me more, working in their repair shop and their supply shop, than I 
ever could possibly learn in school. And growing up, you know my next door neighbor kind of, 
I was his little pet I guess, you know that he kind of took me under his wing and showed me 
everything. I come from a very white-collar family. I guess maybe it was the little rebel in me 
that kind of pointed toward the waterfront. But for better or worse that's what I've stayed with. 
FC: And what's, if there is a typical day, what's a typical day at work for you right now? Like 
say, from the time you walked in in the morning? 
PH: The Fairhaven Shipyard where we are right now is an incredibly busy environment. I don't 
know if you've walked out in the yard or walked around. There's about a hundred guys here 
working in the yard right now that if s my responsibility and the responsibility of the people that 
Peter Heleen interview, March 13, 2017 
6 
work for me to make sure they have all their supplies, all their tools. If they're welders they have 
to have their steel, their welding rods. If they're mechanics they have to whatever it be, if they're 
outside ship fitters they got to to have their bearings and their propeller shaft or whatever. So, I 
essentially go nonstop from, every day, from about six-thirty or seven o’clock in the morning to 
five or five thirty every night, never finish what I set out to do in any, any given day. Always go 
home with a list of things to do. If s a very fast paced environment. Whether it be a commercial 
fishing vessel, which principally that's what we do, the largest percentage of the vessels although 
you'll see small ferryboats, tugboats, things like that. Every day that they're out of the water 
could potentially be losing money for the owner of the vessel. More importantly, if there's 
delays, the yard loses profitability if the works stops. Secondly there's always another vessel 
waiting to get hauled out. I have to constantly keep that in mind. So my job is to get the stuff as 
fast as I can, move onto the next. Typically I do that Monday to Friday. This time of year, 
starting this time of year and as the weather improves we'll also be working Saturdays. It ends up 
being about a sixty-hour week, fifty-five, sixty-hour week job for myself anyway. So, very, very 
busy environment. We're constantly chasing things. We try to, one of the things in the Port of 
New Bedford here is there's a lot of supply houses. We all know each other. We try to keep 
business local. My instructions from ownership here is if it can be bought locally even if it's a 
little more money we are going to do business with local businesses. There's a lot of assets in 
New Bedford Harbor that I am in daily communication with. Whether if s buying paintbrushes or 
right before this interview started I was calling a local vendor to pick up some stainless steel 
plates. And one of my trucks are going there right now to get it. So... 
[11:41] FC: So, you can get most of what you need locally? 
PH: We certainly try to. As the fishing fleef s getting larger in the yard and the vessels are 
getting larger there's a lot of supplies that... Well, lef s just put it this way, I have to be flexible. I 
have to search all over the place for it sometimes. And having the mechanical background I'm 
kind of blessed with where I can figure out where we're going. Not that I always have the 
answers, I don't. I don't. 
FC: But you have to be resourceful. If s almost like detective work. You have to find... 
PH: Correct, correct. 
FC: Where you can get what you need. 
PH: Particularly if it's a situation where we, lef s say have a commercial fishing vessel that is 
broken down in season. The days are open, the weather's good. Whether it be a scalloper or clam 
boat or whatever and they want to go. Time is money. It's contingent on me to find those parts 
and somehow get them here. So, and I make mistakes every day but for the most part I survive. 
FC: And, I’ve got a bunch of things here, lef s see. Oh, one thing that you mentioned that was 
interesting. It sounds as though you're responsible for tools and equipment and materials. Is that 
right or... 
Peter Heleen interview, March 13, 2017 
7 
PH: Not all the tools and equipment but any of the tools or equipment that is purchased by the 
yard or needed by the yard we process purchase orders and we do find the vendors to, to get 
them. There is certain tools that the individual department foremen will go out and at least do the 
research themselves on and then turn to the purchasing department or myself and say, “Hey look, 
I looked at this tool. This is how much it cost. Will you give them a purchase order?” So, 
sometimes they are doing that on their own. But hand tools, let's say the welders need a grinder, 
yeah, I procure that. The painters need brushes, rollers, paint trays, I procure that or the guys that 
work for me do or my department does, so, yes. In addition to the supplies and we also have a 
parts counter there that customers, boat owners that, even if their vessel's not hauled out they'll 
come in and purchase supplies. So we do that as well. 
[14:54] FC: And you have to be comfortable with or knowledgeable about all sorts of different 
systems, whether if s welding or engines, or... 
PH: There's certain things that I really like to do that I think I'm very, very, strong in doing. Like 
any human being, there's certain things I hate doing and I'm not so strong in doing. I think, again, 
the mechanical stuff I'm better at some of the, in particular. I'll just use an example, high 
performance paints and things of that nature, I usually refer to or sit down with the paint foreman 
Joe, Joe McGallis, who I think was here and say, he'll say, this is what I need, this is what I need. 
It ends up falling on me to procure that product or at least process the order, so yeah, I would say 
I have to be, know a little bit about a lot of things. I cannot be just an expert in any one thing and 
I think, ITl pat myself on the back, but I think I know a little bit about a lot of things. 
FC: And whaf s your role in the, if an owner comes in and says I need to have such and such 
done to my boat, or I need to have it hauled, what's your role in sort of putting the estimate 
together or the plan together or... 
PH: When, at Fairhaven Shipyard anyway, most of that is done by Kevin McLaughlin, the 
owner or Ed DaSilva, the yard foreman, who, they will sit down initially with the owners. If it is 
a quote, if if s an estimate, if if s a new system, a new hull, something along those natures, if s 
fairly common that Kevin will send me an email or a text, I need to have pricing or availability 
on this product, on that product. I need to know what this is going to cost, what that’s going to 
cost. How fast can you get a six-inch by twenty-one-foot-long propeller shaft, for example. Well, 
I will find where there is one and how much money it will cost. I typically report to them. So, 
I'm, I rarely will sit down directly with a boat owner, except I will be kind of the guy behind the 
scenes here, getting the pricing. And even then those two gentlemen are pretty good at doing 
that. They've been doing it a long time so they'll figure it out. But if there's anything out of the 
ordinary, anything that, let's say they need to know price quotes on 6 inch piping or whatever. It's 
usually done here. They'll send me an email or a text and here's a list of things, give me an 
estimate. So, thaf s where it goes. 
FC: And how complicated, I would think the process of getting what you need would be 
complicated like, say you need to get a propeller shaft here and thaf s easy. You've got a source 
and that's going to be here on Thursday but then for some reason there's a hang up getting the 
bearings you need or something. 
Peter Heleen interview, March 13, 2017 
8 
PH: Oh that, that happens every, every single day. The, I'm smiling a little bit because it almost 
never goes according to plan. The, we're expecting a big snowstorm tomorrow and Wednesday 
or at least some type of foul weather. That affects trucking companies, it affects UPS, it affects 
everything. It affects the yard; it delays things, (phone rings) It, I wish everything could come 
off like clockwork but it pretty rarely does, to be honest with you. Either that or when it doesn't 
that overwhelms it when it does. If I can say it like that. I try to click it all together, yes, so that 
things come in the progression that the yard needs it in, whether they the propeller shaft tube 
before the propeller shaft, which is what they need, or they need bearings after the propeller shaft 
is in. I have to have in my mind whaf s got to come first but if s usually lef s just try to get stuff 
here as soon as we possibly can because there inevitably is going to be delays and there usually 
is. 
[20:29] FC: So are you, if you walk across the yard out here are you a target where somebody 
says, where's my this and where's my that? 
PH: Constantly, constantly. Some of the people I can totally ignore and some of the people I 
can't ignore. Usually the guy that signs my paycheck I cannot ignore. But I try to work with the 
individual foreman. It's the, the hauling foreman, the paint foreman, the welding foreman, the 
carpentry foreman who are bringing the requests to me. Kevin, the owner... You and I could 
walk across this yard right now and I would speculate anywhere from five or six people would 
come up to us and come up to me and say I need this I need this. Which I guess is a good thing. 
Keeps me busy. 
FC: Gives you a good reason to keep a low profile and stay out sight if you can. But I guess you 
can't. 
PH: Well, there's no avoiding it. I do have some good people that work for me, things I can 
dump on them. I have at least in the north yard here I got a couple of guys in their twenties that, 
not a lot of experience but they’re go getters, they're learning. I can dump a lot of the repetitious 
stuff right on them and I don't even need to really pay much attention to that. That kind of frees 
me up to work on difficult things or special projects and just oversee everything. So. 
FC: Do you feel a lot of pressure? I mean the, a lot of the activity or maybe all of the activity or 
most of the activity that goes on around here depends on people having what they need and that 
comes back to you. 
PH: I would say that I have an extremely stressful job. A lot of people say that I bring that upon 
myself I, typically, my personality is I can't give up. I have a hard time letting things go. I take 
a personal interest in my job. It's not, ifs not just my job; if s my career. I have a whole slew of 
customers that I consider not only customers, friends. Not just from here, but from other 
business, people I've worked with, people call my home, people have my personal cell phone 
number. That's okay, that's all okay, my wife is used it. She's used to me not being around very 
much. I like to think I have a pretty stressful job. Ninety-five percent of the time I have a great 
job. Five percent of the time ifs not so great but I think that probably applies to a lot of people in 
their careers, not just mine. If I really look back at it with a kind of impartial viewpoint. But 
Peter Heleen interview, March 13, 2017 
yeah, it's a, there's a lot going on here that, in shipyard, that I have to be aware of and what's 
going on. 
9 
FC: Can you get away from it so that if you're home and if s eight o'clock at night and, are you 
thinking about it or do you say maybe if I call this guy at home I can get that here tomorrow 
morning. 
PH: No, I probably, well if s probably bad to admit. I probably wake up three or four times every 
single night and I probably get an average of five or six hours of sleep every night and it's 
usually ril wake up in the middle of the night and, oh, I forgot to do this. Thaf s an every day, 
every night occurrence. So. 
[25:11] FC: Now how do you kind of keep track of what you're doing. You're, there are lots of 
projects going on, you're working with lots of different suppliers. How do you, do you depend on 
a laptop, or a... 
PH: I don't, I really, I think I probably should be a lot more organized than I truly am. I don't 
write down a heck of a lot during the course of the day. We do of course have computer systems 
that I have to use a formal purchase order and I also have to make sure that the product that I'm 
buying is applied to the work order for the vessel or thaf s how we get paid. But I have a million 
pieces of scrap paper with a million notes written on it but that's usually an after the fact thing. 
Oh, I need to write this down so I don't forget to do it. But during the course of the day it I 
somewhat just complete one thing and go to the next or try to complete one thing, get interrupted 
and then have to go to the next. Which is more than normal than completing one thing. I don't, 
as a rule, use a laptop. I have one. I don't even bring it to work. I, sometimes. I'll sit at home and 
type some notes in it. I hate computers; I don't like computers. Maybe I could use one to my 
advantage but I just don't like computers to be honest with you. I come from a, I like to say, I 
come from a pre-computer generation and maybe I'm soured by raising a couple of kids that you 
know, had their face and hands on a Gameboy more than they did on a, more than they should 
have and I don't like texting. I don't like cell phones but guess what? They are a necessary evil in 
these days. 
FC: I was going to ask you how do you, how does most of your communication happen with 
suppliers. Is it on the phone? Is it email messages? Is it text messages? Is it... 
PH: I would say probably about fifty or sixty percent by telephone and maybe forty to fifty 
percent by email. I typically will call a vendor. I like to hear, yeah, this is in stock or this is when 
I can get it. I get a better feeling of what's going to happen than I do in email and then I will ask 
them to confirm the order by email to try to keep a paper trail or at least an electronic trail of 
what's going on. I'm on the phone a lot and it's trying to get from that guy on the other end of the 
phone and for many years I was that guy on the other end of the phone. I was supplying. I 
worked for a supplier. And you want to hear yeah, I can have one tomorrow, one the next day. 
Sometimes you don't get that in an electronic message. I find that sometimes what you see in 
that email is really not whaf s going to happen. 
Peter Heleen interview, March 13, 2017 
10 
FC: Well there's something cold about it too because if you talk with someone you can tell by 
their voice if they're tense or if they sound like they can deliver or... 
PH: Correct. If I do not feel like talking to someone I'll send them a text or an email. Thaf s the 
beauty of an email. And sometimes if s just, oh, I'm going to dread talking to this guy so I'm 
going to send him an email. But a lot of our vendors now are requiring an electronic either 
purchase order or ordering electronically and Fm not a real big fan of that. 
[30:10] FC: And speaking of vendors, suppliers, seems like your relationships with them must be 
pretty important for what you do. 
PH: Oh I have to, I try to basically get on a first name basis with my vendors or suppliers. 
People I've been doing business with again at the various companies I've worked for, for twenty 
or thirty years I've never met them. I know their voice over the phone. I've never met them. But 
sure, you need to have the ability to pick up the phone and say, hey, I need this favor from you. I 
need this. I need to know whaf s happening with this job. And they do the same to me as well. 
It's, again I think I said it before, if s kind of a small waterfront. Gloucester’s, I'm sure, is no 
different. We do business with businesses up in Gloucester. There’s not too many places around 
like the Port of New Bedford to be honest with you. And so not just the vendors but the 
customers I try to stay on a very personable level with them. 
FC: It must be an advantage as you said, if you've got somebody on the other end of the phone 
that you've known or worked with for twenty years versus somebody who just started three 
weeks ago. 
PH: Oh sure. Of course it is. You know you're going to get that dumb kid on the other end of 
the phone but I was the dumb kid once too. I'm still a dumb kid. So, at least thaf s what I think. 
But, yeah, they, I think I have a pretty high degree of tolerance for that because they got to learn 
as well. So. 
FC: Is there a typical day? Say if you weren't stuck doing this today, what would your routine 
have been today, for example? 
PH: Well, if I wasn't sitting here right now I'd be ordering, specifically, ordering some, right 
now, right this hour ordering some circuit breakers for an electrician on a job. I'm trying to get 
some steel plate bent for a different job in the yard. I had a gentleman that owns and operates one 
of the pilot boats call me less than an hour ago, said he needs a block heater for one of his 
engines. So I would be ordering that block heater. It is almost never ordering, well, I need to 
stand corrected on that. We do use some of the same supplies, which I am responsible or the 
guys that work for me are responsible, to procure. We'll do a repeat of the same paint, the same 
brushes, the same thing over and over and over again. Typically, I assign that, as I stated earlier, 
to some of the younger guys. I will stay on... I don't think there's, there’s, there really isn't a 
typical day. There are things that we are doing similar to things that we have done before and I 
can't tell you how many steel orders I've processed. They seem to be common here. But every 
one of them is the same. It isn't like we're ordering ten of this ten of this. They're always 
different. There's something different every day. 
Peter Heleen interview, March 13, 2017 
11 
FC: So it sounds like it's, I mean for you there really isn't a set routine. It sounds like your days 
can be pretty unpredictable depending on what comes up. 
PH: They can be very unpredictable. I try to start each day with a plan. It's a rarity that I make it 
an hour into the day. And that plan is usually just catching up on what I haven't done from the 
previous few days or whatever. That happened this morning. I came to work a little before seven 
this morning. I said I'm going to sit down and do this do this do this. Those are leftover jobs. It 
wasn't eight o'clock where, in this particular case it happened to be a customer whose boat is not 
even here, saying I need these two engine parts here and I need them tomorrow. So I kind of 
stopped what I was doing and dealt with him. Then I back up and let’s go do that. And by this 
time the different foremen are coming in and out and you like to think there's a plan. And there is 
somewhat of a plan but that plan changes on a daily, hourly, weekly, whatever basis. It's 
constantly changing. So no, I can't really make a plan on what I'm going to be doing other than 
I'm going to be here for eight or nine or ten hours throughout the day and again leave with it not 
all be doing done and come back at it and do it all over again. So. 
[36:14] FC: Are there certain types of materials or whatever it may be that are sort of 
consistently a problem to get or a bigger headache to deal with than say maybe steel, maybe 
getting steel is pretty routine? 
PH: That's pretty routine, yeah. 
FC: But is there other stuff that you can say that, this is going to kill my afternoon. 
PH: Well, I think that the comment I'd like to make about that, certainly when I was working for 
C.E. Beckman Company, twenty years ago you could call up a vendor and he would almost 
always have the part. Twenty years ago warehouses made their livelihood on having it in 
inventory. It seems now that we've developed a “just in time” inventory or “lef s go on the 
intemef ’ type inventory type business. So, the not so common parts, that strange bearing I'm 
looking for, I may end up having to send three or four requests out, either electronically or by 
telephone to just try to find the person that has it. Sometimes, I'm on the phone calling six, 
seven, eight vendors looking for a part that you would think each one of the should have on the 
shelf It isn't like that anymore. It's very, very, very few companies have inventory. And a lot of 
times there's a wait for product. Of course you try to start locally and work your way out and 
that's what I try to do. It isn't. I'm not going to use the word that price that is not important, it is, 
but if s not the overall. I’ll be under the opinion that if s not the, right now it’s lef s see who can 
get it here fastest. Particularly if that commercial vessel is out of service, my job is to find it, get 
it there fastest. Things aren't like they used to be. As a matter of fact, inventory levels at 
warehouses I would say are pretty poor. There's a lot of lead time for a lot of the common things 
that people you would think, oh, thaf s going to be easy to get. It isn't. It isn't. It's not easy. 
FC: Thaf s an interesting point that these companies just don't carry the inventory that they used 
to. I guess it must save them overhead or whatever.

PH: Well, you have to remember that in this world. If you yourself are nowadays were searching 
for something. Where you going to go to first? Most people just Google it. Go to their laptop 
computers. Well, a lot of traditional warehouses and traditional businesses are reeling from that 
and in our situation here we can't rely on, let's say, the Amazons of the world to be delivered in 
one or two or three days. We don't have one or two or three days. If I was to, he might disagree 
with me if I made this statement, but I kind of have this feeling if I was to tell my boss I can get 
that route pretty quick, pretty quick means twenty, thirty minutes, send a truck. Not two or three 
days. So, no, a lot of warehouses are not carrying what they did in the past. This is a lot of what 
we work on is not really modem technology things. A lot of these vessels are twenty, thirty, forty 
years old with some old parts. You got to kind of think back a little bit. 
[40:56] FC: Is it a burden to think about, you've got somebody's fishing boat in here and he’s got 
to get out and earn a living. He's got a family at home and if you can't get that part here, I mean 
is it a burden to think about the sort of personal side that comes along with some of this? Do you 
get caught up in that? Or kind of... 
PH: Oh, there's certain jobs that bother the living, you know, whatever out of me. Yeah, that I 
can't find that and thaf s going to just dwell on me. There, I'd like to, I do take my job personally 
but there are just certain things that thaf s, that's what it is. Yup, I ordered it, ifs on the tmck. 
Tmck got lost, tmck went somewhere else. You got to kind of turn around and say yep. I'm sorry 
it didn't show up today and just kind of move on to the next thing. As far as directly 
communicating that with the owner of the boat and let's say, go face to face with him and see his 
disappointment or anger, usually I don't have to do that. It's usually one of the operating foremen 
or the owner that has to do that and so they're getting the information from me. Hey, where is 
this, why is this late? Why is this not here? I'll deal internally with that but I usually don't 
communicate directly to the boat owner. 
FC: And, lef s see, what else I have here. We've covered a lot of this stuff So, you have some 
assistants, people that work with you? 
PH: I do. At, in the north yard, and we do have two hauling yards. We have the north yard 
where you are now, and the south yard, which is down near Fort Phoenix. There is a separate 
stock room down there with two full-time individuals that do buy product and do maintain the 
stockroom down there and there's a small retail establishment down there. They, we, work very 
closely with them. Fm not going to say, I do do purchase for jobs that are down in that shipyard 
as well. I don't like using the word people that work for me, ifs people that work with me. I do 
have two guys that in the north yard that work with me. I also have kind of a full-time guy that 
mns around, drives a flatbed tmck, picking up things locally, delivering product, picking up 
product, whatever I need. So there's, right now, I guess you could say six of us in the purchasing 
procurement department of the shipyard. I just happen to be the leader of the pack. 
FC: What are the end, I think I've touched on some of this but what are the most challenging or 
toughest parts of the job? 
[44:50] PH: Probably, getting the material here in a timely fashion is seemingly getting more 
and more difficult to be honest with you. Thaf s probably the largest challenge I face on a day-

to-day basis is getting the stuff here. And secondly, just the large amount of volume that we need 
to keep the yard going. It's a lot of product. And busy, busy yard. We have a lot of work and we 
want to keep that ball rolling. 
FC: Thaf s a good problem to have. 
PH: Yep. 
FC: Whaf s the, what do you enjoy most about it? What are the best parts of the job? 
PH: Well, I, when things go well and a project comes off like clockwork and I've been able to 
really procure everything. Then I can sit back and kind of say, wow, you know what? That job 
came out really well. I like that. Thaf s a lot of enjoyment. And by and large there's a lot of very 
talented people here from different backgrounds, different nationalities, different countries, 
different talents. And I'm pretty proud to be part of that, that group where I bring my little 
portion of that talent here. So, I like that. I do like that. I do like working around boats, ships, and 
I wouldn't punish myself like I do sometimes if I didn't enjoy it for the most part. Like I said. I've 
got ninety, ninety-five percent of the time I really enjoy my job. There's always some hiccups 
with everything. 
FC: Well, I should let you get back to work but is there anything else you'd like to add here that 
we didn't cover that we should have? 
PH: No, I don't think so. It's a interesting place to work, interesting port and I wish you well in 
your interviews. 
FC: Thanks.
