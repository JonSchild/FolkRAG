QUESTIONER: Whenever you're ready to start.
RESPONDENT: Raising tobacco, early in the fall sow a coat crop on the tobacco. The
land you're going to work tobacco in.
Q: You sow a cover crop.
R: Cover crop. See we put the rye or wheat, on which you turn down some hay. But
usually you had a cover crop on the land.
Q: A "cover drop".
R: And then next we get to tobacco bed. Cleaned that off and putting on (unintelligible) to

R: Yes it is. Then round about the end of February or March, we sow the beds with a little
seed. We trump it with (unintelligible) or whatever, and then we do, we throw a little seed.
Q: You cover it fertilizer.
R: And then there's the, later we take and put on this cotton.
Q: Cotton? Cotton.
R: Or plastic. Some use cotton and some use plastic. You put that on over the seed to
stop it coming up. And the top presses it down.
Q: You top-dress it again. (unintelligible)
R: Most of them, like ours, ours was ten by twelve, twelve by twelve and ten by ten. And
lots of people have theirs eight so
C 29 page 20
they can reach over there better and the (unintelligible) doesn't keep moving on them.
Q: A little bit narrow.
R: They had them narrow and long. Some have them square, but then others have them
narrow and long. And they sprays them for different diseases.

Q: What kind of diseases? Can get in the plant then?
GAF IN TAPE
R: ... blue mold, wildflowers, ...
Q: Blue mold and wild flowers.
R: Those two get you in the back of the bed. And as the plants grow large enough to plant,
they pull off the cover and let the sun toughen them up.
Q: 0h, let the sun toughen them up.
R: So that it won't kill them. See if you got them in the hot sun, they's so (unintelligible).
Q: Yeah, they're so tender. So they pull that cotton off.
R: And preparing the land to plant your tobacco in, they usually have a cover crop on that
and you turn that in and ...
Q: You turn that in ... with what?
R: A plow. Plow it in.

Q: Plow it in.
R: Tie it in. And you give the land, break it down, give the land two or three good
(unintelligible)--cross-ways, straight up and down, and regular.
Q: Oh, oh! Crossways?
C 29 page 21
R: The top of all that stuff, you can put it on the inside there.
Q: And straight up and down, you mean in several different ways, directions.
R: That's got all that (unintelligible) up you got down in there.

R: Use to till everybody got tractors.
Q: You used to until everybody got tractors.
R: They was in the forties getting all tractors.
Q: Oh, in the forties you got yours.
R: And then what you, you'd drill in your lye or fertilizer or whatever you were going to use
on your tobacco, you drilled it in the land.
Q: You'd drill it in.
R: Before you plant it. Stop getting up them (unintelligible).
Q: They planted flat up there, yes. About those rows, you were telling me about the hill.
R: See we've cut that off. We used to make a hill with our lift'o'light mark it.
Q: Marker. Yeah, mark-it.

everything is for the fastest!

R: That's when it stopped. So they started drilling in the
C 29 page 22
the fertilizer in. And then again you'd top-dress it even after you had planted, beside your,
even after you had planted your tobacco. Fertilizer on the (unintelligible).
Q: This is after the little plants are in? Let's go back a minute to the plant bed. I think you
said you didn't steam, did you? But some ...
R: Some does steam the beds before they plant their little, before they plant the tobacco
seeds.
Q: Why did they do that?
R: I think that is for that, it makes them come faster. But that heat the land and kill the
weeds up more.
Q: Kills the weeds.
R: See? That's 'cause the (unintelligible). And you got to have that on there ninety days
before you seed. 'Cause other will kill that black seed, too.
Q: Oh, well you don't want to do that.

R: They be putting that on September, October, going on into November if you're late, and
that, why that make you later in the spring. Seeding your bed.
Q: Now, drying the plants. Out of the plant bed.
C 29 page 23
R: Yeah, when they're large enough to plant, then we draw the plant, the largest ones out,
and then we plant them. (unintelligible) Yeah, they toughen up. The sun get them out. I
didn't say this awhile ago about what, you putting the cover on them.
Q: Putting the cover on--oh, yes!

R: As soon as the plant get-up, get about the size of a dime, you put this tobacco bean
cotton, or plastic on. That forces the plant to make, it keeps it warm so that it'll grow faster.
Q: Oh yes.
R: And then they get large enought to plant, where they takes that cover off so they can
tough-up putting them out and (unintelligible).
Q: Those tender little plants! Now, when the field is prepared, and you're all ready to plant,
then you go to the tobacco beds and ...
R: Draw your plants, get you water, have your land already prepared by filling-in fertilizer,
and get your plant and your water, and get your plants together.
Q: Now, you plant with a machine.
R: With the machine.
Q: What do you call that machine?

C 29 page 24
R: One row planter. Then we cultivated-up there often to try to keep it worked-up.
Q: The land.
R: The land. The plants would have some side-dressed again. And as it growed,
sometimes it need a spraying for different diseases. Come in the field all insect.
Q: Mm-hmm. A spraying.
R: That man charge you about two hundred, I think. That come from the university.
Q: You mean that sprays with an airplane?

lacking?

R: They call it. they can't call it a drought, 'cause we ain't had a drought.
Q: Drought?
R: (unintelligible). Wouldn't have enough rain on it and it didn't grow good.
Q: But if they don't have enough rain, then it's a drought.
R: Then it's a drought for me.
0: Back to that tobacco planter--it has a barrel of water on the side. And the little waterer
comes down. And they say when it the water comes out ...
R: You can tell, 'cause you see, you see the water come out, you put your plant there.

R: Yeah.
Q: Is that the shoe?
R: That's the shoe. And they come along to cup them seeds up. Like a little disc in the

Q: And the person sitting there ...
R: Put the plant out. Yeah that thing open up a row--here's this thing dropping, you know,
pouring the water, and then back behind is the shoe cup (unintelligible) up.
Q: Covers it up. Plants that. On the plants that they miss or the worms eat, or something

It takes too much help like that. You have to .... Like now, this rain we've had, we doing
some planting out there. See the land is still in good order.
Q: The land is still in good order? This year's been good for rain, hasn't it?
