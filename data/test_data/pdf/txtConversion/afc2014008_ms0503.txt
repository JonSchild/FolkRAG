Dear Pets,
 
It was great to talk with you this morning.  I as enclosing several different
 
S
tone for your perusal and assistance!
 
a.  A f
estival brochure (
huff colored) in which see the map.  The Festival
 
grounds are right behind the M e = of American History; the concert hall
 
directly in front of i
t across Constitution Avenue.  I will probably he rotating
;
 
around the grounds most of Saturday visiting with folks and in  figuring out
 
program details, and we'll probably run into each o
ther.  The festival s
taff
 
have been notified t
hat you way want to leave your luggage in the festival
 
trailer * and you should teVe advantage of the offer.  It has been murderously
 
hot here l
ately with bad muggy air, and you don't want to carry anything around
 
all day that you don't have to.
 
b.  A tentative outline of the program for the concert.  Vo doubt i
t will
 
be different by the time you come, and I
'll have another version for you by
 
then.  The basic outline will probably not change, as this was the way •e did
 
it last year and i
t seens3 to wort; well.  I will meet you backsta
,ge at the
 
Departmental Auditorium a
t 600 p
.m. Saturday night and we can go from there.
 
c.  A pacVet of biograpbles of all t
his year's awardees.  There  i
s more
 
information in backup files in our office if needed; please cell before Saturday
 
if so
 
e
.  Copies of the two articles I wrote for the Smitbsonian program i
n 1
982
 
and 1983.  Those contain various statwments about the rationale behind the
 
Beritage Fellowship i
dea which might be helpful to you, although, since you
 
helped KI
M the entirw concept, you shouldn't need the justifications I managed
 
to get on paper.  However, p
lease use them if you'd like.
 
4
.couple of other miscellaneous points!
 
a
.  Prang Rodaoll w
ill read off a kind of one or two sentence citation about
 
eacb awardee when he gives theca the certificate.  I
'll try to have those texts
 
for you by the evening
s so you won't find yourself accidentally using
, the exact
 
same words.
 
s

b.  A few of the folks will definitely not be able to he with us.  We are
 
s
till debating about hoar to handle this -- have someone accept for t
herm or
 
simply read off their names and citations -- t
here are advantages both ways.
 
Anyway the no—shown are as follows s

During this coming August (1983) I am tentatively planning a one-week trip to
 
Hawaii on official travel.
 Sarah Richards
 (Director of the Hawaii State
 
Foundation on Culture and the Arts) and I have discussed a possible agenda in
 
some detail.
 She will by August have taken on board a brand-new and first-ever
 
folk arts coordinator, so the visit will allow me to have some useful planning
 
sessions with the new coordinator and his/her advisory committee right at the
 
outset of their important venture.  I have also been invited to address the
 
East-West Center's Learning Institute on their current Culture and the Arts project;
 
and they would like me to meet with their Micronesian study council during the
 
same visit.
 Sarah Richards
 wants me to work with the Hawaiian delegation
 
preparing for the Pacific Festival of Arts and Culture to be held in New Caledonia
 
in the summer of 1984 as well as with C-PAC, the members of which are readying
 
their own participant troupes.
 Furthermore, there are ongoing projects at the
 
Bishop Museum that could use some special attention, and I should like to discuss
 
with them the development of a tropical curatorial training program for smaller
 
island museums.  All in all, I believe the week will be well filled.
 Folk Arts
 
has sufficient funds in our summer travel budget to cover this venture, providing
 
our conservative assumptions for our fourth quarter admin budget are on target.
 
It has occurred to me that a further extension of this trip to Guam and the Northern
 
Marianas might well be a cost effective move.
 It would add somewhere around $1,500
 
to the Hawaii venture but it would enable me to spend two or three days in Guam,
 
two or three days in the northern Marianas, and even possibly a day or two in one
 
or more of the Federated States of Micronesia or in the Marshall Islands, where
 
we have, it seems to me, certain cultural and artistic responsibilities along with
 
our defense postures.
 I have discussed the possibility of this extended trip with
 
Anthony Turney, Jerry Yoshitomi, and various C-PAC members, all of whom are strongly
 
supportive.
 (Anthony even said he would give me some part of the travel funds
 
needed if I could put off the trip until 1984, but that is unfortunately impractical.
 
The reasons for going to Micronesia at this time are:
 
a.
 A new folk arts coordinator will be appointed in Guam by the end of the
 
summer.
 The entire arts council is new, and the director of the Insular Arts
 
Council, Annie Benevente Stone, though basically supportive of a folk arts program,
 
is green to the job in general.
 I really believe I could be of assistance, again
 
at a critical time, in their program development.
 
b.
 A few days on Guam would enable me to schedule some planning sessions
 
with the Center for Micronesian Studies (MARC), widely regarded as the best locus
 
for the development of historical and cultural resources in Micronesia.  The MARC
 
- 2
 
director, Dirk Ballendorf is energetic and widely trusted throughout the islands
 
but needs firm administrative direction and buckets of straight forward and
 
sympathetic advice.  MARC could be a major cultural resource for the western
 
Pacific; it boasts a first class facility inside the University of Guam but as of
 
now it is really limping along in some part because of limited administrative
 
know-how.  At the very least, with a little more experience MARC could turn into
 
a flow-through  agency for many worthy projects on the smaller islands of western
 
Micronesia where sponsors are badly needed.
 
C.
 The Commonwealth Council for Arts and Culture (Northern Marianas) has
 
not undergone the upheaval in leadership that took place in Guam.  Still, I am
 
assured by Anna Teregeyo that a visit from me would be most welcome, allowing them
 
a chance to discuss their fund raising efforts for their major cultural facility
 
with someone from the Endowment.
 Further, Folk Arts has several projects on Saipan
 
and one on Rota that I could fruitfully visit, if time allows.
 
Throughout the Pacific, the major art forms are folk and traditional.
 This state
 
of affairs must be carefully and respectfully handled, because island peoples
 
want to feel just as fancy and up-town as anybody else.
 I am sure it has not
 
escaped their notice that Folk Arts and the various Regional Reps are their usual
 
visitors.
 Still, I do believe it is worth the effort and the dollars; these
 
islands are half way around the world from Washington D.C. but much closer and
 
more visible from California and practically in the back yard when you get to
 
Honolulu.
 I think a trip such as I describe would be cost effective and a good use
 
of federal dollars.  If you can see your way clear to allocating $1500 of the
 
Chairman's Reserve to this purpose, I
'd be very happy about it in the first place
 
and in the second place would appreciate knowing as soon as possible as dates
 
must be firmed up soon.  I shall, with your approval be going to Hawaii anyway;
 
the point at issue i
s the extra trip to Micronesia, especially Guam.

Dear Danny,
 
It was a real pleasure to s
leet you last Sunday,  and I thank you again for
 
abowing us your workshop and kiln.
 
I am enclosing some guidelines for your use i
n applying for a second apprentice—
 
ship.  Please fill
. out the Individual Application forms in the back and get them
 
to Fancy Sweezey so that she can bring them to Washington with her next week.
 
You need send o
nly o
ne c
opy, but we will need also a statemeaat from the Farrells
 
that they are willing to continue having you as an apprentice, and we will need
 
an informal report frosr
. you and from them as to A
iat you have accomplishes' so
 
far in your current apprenticeship.  This can he in the form of a letter if you
 
l
 0 e
; any way you want to do i
t will he fine.
 
You have to bear in mind that the panel will have to consider and vote on your
 
application.  I think the chances are good or I wouldn't l
ot you send in a late
 
application, but there really i
s no guarantee.  We will let you know whether or
 
not you have gotten the grant '
.
,y August 1
st, wren the '

Per'laps you could wort
/ something out witl, the F
a
arrells to tide you over until then.
 
I do thing that potx and t
he Farrells and per?aaps Nancy Saeezey s
!ioul3 sit down
 
together and consider how much longer this apprenticeship should i
deally run.
 
before you fill i
n the form.  You don't have to ask for another four months, it
 
could he three mouths, or six or nine, or a whole year.  Try to give us some good
 
ressons for the amount of time you ask for.
 
Again, it was a pleasure meeting you and seeing your word
..  Please give

I truly regret this in more ways than one, but I have concluded that
 
ny reviewing Ships and Shipyards # Sailors and Fishprmv-

Subject:  Attached memo on service organizations
 
There is really only one Folk Arts group -- the National Council on the Traditional
 
Arts, headed by Joe Wilson -- that behaves in any significant way like a folk arts
 
service organization.  We have made occasional attempts to attract other existing
 
institutions into taking on service functions but have proceeded with caution, mindful
 
of the difficulties other Endowment programs have run into Vn
 en they have gone out and
 
created service organizations.  Perhaps we have been too cautious, for really nobody
 
else has responded.
 
We have therefore put quite a hit of money into YCTA during the past years, since it
 
functions in several different ways:  as an independent producing  organization, as
 
a flow-througi, and as %older of our evaluation/technical assistance contract moneys.
 
To clarify a few particulars, the panel .
;as vote<
.' to support the NCTA festival on an
 
annual basis (
the only festival to get such support) because i
t is the most venerat,le
 
and the only truly national festival in our field.  The big thrust into touring in
 
1981 was a not entirely successful experiment in which we tried to help NCTA set up as
 
a primary touring organization.  They are continuing to tour, but not on such a
 
frenetic basis, and other folk arts organizations are now sponsoring a few "ethnic"
 
tours, a healthier situation anyway.
 
I

Subject:  Folk Arts Panel Meeting 3/10-- 3/12,  Room 1422
 
A meeting agenda is attached for your in
.for
_mation.  Turing this meeting
; we
 
will be reviewing approximately 100 applications as well as making the final
 
decisions on the National Heritage Fellowships and doing a preliminary review
 
of five Challenge applications f
or which we may be secondary sponsors.
 
Thursday will be taken up with orientation for new panelists, some application
 
r
.eview, Heritage Fellowship decisions and, Burin(, the evening, media sample
 
screening.
 
Fridav we will
. make final decisions on media projects and return to ordinary
 
application review during the afternoon.  We may or may not continue working
 
Friday evening depending upon how well we have progressed
..
 
Saturday will complete application review.  T
ae anticipate no major policy
 
discussions except that the issue of t
'
ae arpropriateness of funding internships
 
v
rill surface once aeain when we qet towards the end of the book, likely
 
Saturday morning or afternoon.
 
We would, of course, welcome in-house v
isitors for any part of the three days,
 
though I believe Thursday's Fellowship discussion and media screening will be
 
of the least Renera
.l interest.  We are also thinking of wining and
, cheesing
 
our new panelists Friday afternoon about 5
:30.  We will let you know how this
 
plan for a bit
_ of sociability progresses and hope to see you there.  For a
 
taste of real Panel workings, I
'd recommend Friday afternoon and both sessions
 
Saturday.

Dear Ms. Gladden:
 
Thank you for your letter of February 16 to our Folk Arts Program. • I am
 
sending along to you the necessary application forms.
 
You are absolutely correct that our program has been funding the Kansas
 
Folklife Festival over t
he  past several years.  From the reports I have
 
seen and heard, much good work in identifyin^ unknown folk artists has
 
been done in preparing for the festival, and during the last couple of years,
 
the new state folk arts coordinator's work has fad nicely into making the
 
festival an artistic  success.
 
Apparently you are not aware that your own state has had its own state folk
 
arts coordinator for the last couple of years as well.  I am sure that the
 
North Dakota coordinator could be a great asset to your plans, as involving
 
a folk arts professional should, and I strongly suggest you contact the state
 
arts council.  Their address is North Dakota Council on the Arts, Slack Building
 
#811, Fargo, hD  5u102, 7U1/237-8959.  As I understand it, the permanent
 
coordinator is presently out on an extended sick leave, but they do have an
 
interim person in place.
 
You also should know that in 1983, there was a statewide folk festival, the
 
Festival of ethnic '
.
Musical Traditions in north Dakota, that was organized by
 
Professor Tamar Read at the University of North Dakota.  It was funded by our
 
pro7ram.  It would probably be very helpful to your planning to find out what
 
they have done.
 
One final suggestion -- you might want to give me a call before committing
 
your festival application plans to paper.  If you like, you may call me
 
person-to-person collect at 202/682-5449, leave your nacre and number, and I
 
will return your call as soon as I an able.  I will be tied up through ;
-
larch 12,
 
but anytime after then I should be relatively free to talk over your plans with
 
you.
 
Best regards,

)  One of the notable charRcteristics of folk music in the United States is
 
the frequency of the small Instrumental ensemble of three to six players,
 
most typically plaving on a variety of stringed instruments.  From
 
Appalachia there are old-timev string bands and blue grass, zydeco and
 
Cajun groups from.
 Louisiana, waf
fle (Pispanic/Indian) bards from Arizona,
 
Mariachi , jarocho and coniunto Mexican styles , and of course a host of
 
ethnic musical groups -- German, Italian, Greek , Portuguese, etc. etc.
 
A small string
y►
 ensemble concert is a regular feature night be fun, and
 
not too expensive to bring off providing we worked it out carefully.
 
2
)  Joe Nilson of the National Council on the Traditional Arts has for the
 
past three or four years programmed noon hour summertime folk music
 
concerts on the front steps of the Library of Congress.  If that series
 
is continuing , it might be a cost-effective move to have the same group
_
 
or groups appear at the Old Post Office on a different day.  There is
 
quite a t
rio er_oug'z audience to justify doing the prograr<s twice, and
 
there are good groups involved.
 
3
)  I wonder if there would not be interest In having craftspeople demonstrating
 
from time to time.  It would have to be carefully worked out, but we've
 
had excellent results from demonstrations of blacksmithin�! ,
 weaving,
 
carving and quiltinn
, among others.  Might be worth considering anyway.

ierenberg Film
 
George Nierenberg's two major films, "No Maps on My Taps" (
on three of t
he famous
 
old black tap dancers) and the current gospel music film "Say Amen, Somebody"
 
represent one of Folk Arts' attempts to crack the larger media distribution problem.
 
Most of our films get shown primarily in schools, lilibaries or over local t
.v.
 
George a
lways hits for the big time, and this particular film will be d
istributed
 
in theaters t
hrough Universal's Studios foreign and specialty film series.
 
George nicks good subjects,
 
czars and works like crazy,
 
totally ignorant or totally
 
films have essentially been
 
productions, and it
. shows.
 
Somebody" as were Polk Arts
 
aims for the top, spends monev like the old time movie
 
especially on
. production and promotion.  Fe either is
 
unskilled in private sector fund-raising.  A
ll his
 
federally or state supported.  Thev are big budget
 
I believe NF
.H and I
TYSCA

and Media.  W. funding memo attathhdO.
 
I an awfully glad you're going and I do think you'll enjoy it.  George is a talent.
 
Rv the way, my brother Alan Lomax will be at the showing and may introduce himself.
 
I
'm sure you will find you have friends in common-
, he used to work for the BBC
 
and has many ties with the theatrical world on both sides of the Atlantic.

WRSHII-ISTC]n
 
D
.C. ZDSD6
 
A
 Federal agency advised by t
he
 
National Council on t
he Arts
 
My colleagues have already expressed themselves with greater eloquence and
 
passion than I feel for this particular issue.  Folk Arts has not worried
 
much about eligibility in the past, and our guidelines are not therefore
 
specific on the point.
 
What we have worried about (
since we are essentially focussed on projects) is
 
who is involved in doing the project, what is their track record, their artistic
 
reputation, their degree of experience.  Where we find the artistic management
 
is exemplary but the fiscal management is weak, we occasionally try to help
 
find a flow-through organization that can effectively handle the management
 
responsibilities.
 
Institutions in Folk Arts have varying careers and life-spans.  There are some
 
organizations that come into existence for a specific purpose and fade away
 
once that purpose is assured.
 The Bicentennial Commissions are good examples.
 
We would not like to keep any organization alive beyond i
ts internal need;
 
it is also not especially useful to consider a "track record" when there's been
 
no time to make one.
 
Turning to the issue of when does existence begin, I agree with those colleagues
 
who say that it should be measured from the initial artistic production, not
 
from the moment when IRS guarantees a non-profit status.  Again, Folk Arts often
 
deals with relatively venerable organizations who simply have not applied for
 
official 501 C 3 status because they did not consider themselves in danger of
 
ever making any money.
 
It is becoming a truism but I would hope that the Endowment could retain a flexible
 
position on eligibility.
 I would assume t
hat in ten years the Folk Arts field
 
(
and therefore the Folk Arts Program) would be quite different, perhaps more like
 
Literature or Visual Arts.  Then we might find strict eligibility criteria useful;
 
now, we would not.

I asked Dan
. Sheehy, who has actually handled most of Folk Arts' forays into the
 
international realm, to comment on your memo of 1/7/83.
 Here is his response,
 
with which I concur:
 
The baseline issue in all of this has always been and continues
 
to be money, whether expressed in terms of staff time or outside
 
consultancies.  Money is needed to do all these perfectly laudable
 
things, to hire appropriate ad hoc panels to assist in evaluation
 
(
or to support lengthier meetings of already existing panels), and
 
to create more NEA staff time to devote to all this.
 
Robin Murphy once did an estimate of how much the cooperative
 
agreement with USIA cost us annually in staff time alone, and
 
I believe it came out to about $50,000 a year.
 If we want to
 
do things right, with peer review of USIA artistic activities,
 
rather than just staff review, even more money is needed for
 
review meetings.
 
Being something of an activist, I dislike taking a nay-saying position.
 But
 
Dan is right, we must take note of the fact that we got into our past, present
 
and continuing muddle with USIA because we wanted to do good and did not consider
 
carefully how much it would cost in dollars,  time, and nervous energy.  We are
 
stretched awfully thin just now.
 
Frankly, I think part of our problem with the international realm is that we
 
have never gotten really into it nor have we, on the other hand, stayed out.
 A
 
partial commitment to an indefinite program means that we study and restudy and
 
restudy the same thing while the nervous irritability quotient rises ever higher.
 
Can we not say that for 1983 or whatever year we select we will or won't do the
 
following three things whatever they might be in the international area?  Then
 
the Programs could plan.
 It's like the admin budget.  Until you know what the
 
bottom line is, you go on making ad hoc decisions many of which you later regret.
