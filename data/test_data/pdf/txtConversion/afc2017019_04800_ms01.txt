THRASHER, DARRELL 
Interviewed by Christopher Sims 
October 1, 2017 
 
SIMS: 
00:00:00 
So, basically, these are just backups. This is the main one here. 
So, just to make sure I have the levels right, could you tell me 
what you had for breakfast? 
THRASHER: 
00:00:14 
Strawberry danish, actually. 
SIMS: 
00:00:15 
And are you heading back there tonight? Are you here just for 
the weekend? 
THRASHER: 
00:00:24 
I'm actually heading to Leesville tonight because they're 
heading back. I'm just spending some time with the folks. 
SIMS: 
00:00:29 
Oh, okay. 
THRASHER: 
00:00:30 
Making my family rounds because I have quite a bit of people 
around here that are related. This might help. 
SIMS: 
00:00:40 
So, we could start off. If you could say and then spell your 
name? 
THRASHER: 
00:00:46 
Name is Darrell Thrasher. Spelled D-A-R-R-E-L-L T-H-R-A-S-H-E-R. 
SIMS: 
00:00:54 
Great. And, tell me what you do now. 
THRASHER: 
00:01:02 
Currently I am at school at Southern University for Nursing. I'm 
knocking out my prerequisites. And, I'm also 
ER/communications technician at Our Lady of Lake hospital. 
SIMS: 
00:01:15 
Is that in Baton Rouge? 
THRASHER: 
00:01:16 
Yes. It's the premiere, level two, trauma center for the region. 
We even get stuff from Mississippi in. 
SIMS: 
00:01:24 
Right. 
THRASHER: 
00:01:24 
So. 
SIMS: 
00:01:26 
My wife works at a hospital, so I actually know, vaguely, that 
sort of levels. 
THRASHER: 
00:01:31 
Yeah. 
SIMS: 
00:01:33 
Tell me how you first heard about role play. 
THRASHER: 
00:01:39 
Not to sound nepotic about it, but my father was in the army at 
the time. And, he was an observer-controller out there. I was 
just finishing up my senior year in high school, getting ready to 
go off to college. So, both me and my mom found out about it, 
applied, and the rest, as you see, or will soon see, is history. 
SIMS: 
00:02:04 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Did you grow up in Leesville? 
THRASHER: 
00:02:07 
No, I'm an Army brat, so I, kind of, grew up all over. Particularly, 
you know, I mean, my dad did do two tours at Fort Polk, so. 
SIMS: 
00:02:20 
Were you here, basically, in high school? 
THRASHER: 
00:02:22 
Yes. 
SIMS: 
00:02:23 
Yeah. 
THRASHER: 
00:02:23 
I started out high school in Clarksville, Tennessee, which, 
another military base, Fort Campbell, close by. 
SIMS: 
00:02:35 
Before you started to work role play, like from your dad, what 
was your impressions of what that work was like? What had you 
heard? Is it something that you would talk about around the 
dinner table? 
THRASHER: 
00:02:48 
Not particularly. It wasn't so much that it was secretive, it was 
just, I really didn't have a concept of what it was until I actually 
got into it. It's one of those, I guess you can say vagary. I mean, I 
understood what they did with regard to create training 
scenarios for units to rotate through and become more 
proficient in combat task. That's about all I understood of it. I 
didn't understand what it was from the civilian end. If that 
makes sense. 
SIMS: 
00:03:18 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). What year was it that you graduated 
and first worked there? 
THRASHER: 
00:03:23 
2008. And, I started immediately in June. 
SIMS: 
00:03:28 
Okay, great. 
THRASHER: 
00:03:29 
So, I didn't spend much transition time between high school and 
work and college. 
SIMS: 
00:03:35 
Tell me about the interview process. What are they looking for? 
THRASHER: 
00:03:41 
Actually pretty varied background. You've got folks out there 
running around with master's degrees in subjects ranging from 
theology to accounting to education to just standard Joe Blow. 
The parameters are wide, which I understand why. I mean, 
you're trying to create a realistic population with a set number 
of individuals, so you're going to need different personalities 
and backgrounds to fulfill the task. As far as selection process 
goes, that's a little above my pay grade. 
SIMS: 
00:04:15 
Right. Tell me about the training you did before you were, sort 
of, in the box. 
THRASHER: 
00:04:22 
Actually, they did about a two and a half, three week, 
orientation with regard to, a little brief overview of customs, 
courtesies. Because, when I was actually hired on, the big thing 
was, Iraq, Afghanistan. You know, localized conflicts that NATO 
would be asked to step into. So, basically, it gave you a brief 
overview of the customs, courtesies, cultures of the areas 
you're going to be portraying. And they did this briefing every 
time you would come in for a rotation. So, it's not like it was just 
one and done. It was constant reinforcement. That way, you 
don't forget because of time off, or for whatever reason. 
THRASHER: 
00:04:59 
They also gave us an extensive rundown of ROE, Rules of 
Engagement, out there, with regard to our behavior, soldier's 
behavior and O.P.F.O.R. behavior. Basically, a very long list of 
dos, don'ts and why you dos or don'ts. Safety briefings. Nothing 
standard from any other company. 
SIMS: 
00:05:19 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). What are some of the customs, the 
Afghan, Iraqi, customs that you remember learning about in 
training? 
THRASHER: 
00:05:26 
Particular is, wearing the sunglasses because it's a big thing, 
soldiers always Oakleys or some will have mirrored sunglasses. 
Don't do that because it's actually viewed as a sign of disrespect 
not to show your eyes. Also, the biggest thing for me, 
considering that I really hadn't had much exposure to the 
Middle East, was the fact that the culture's actually reliant upon 
being very close to your face when they speak. Which, of 
course, most of us Americans, we've got a three meter bubble. 
Those kind of personal boundaries spaces don't exist in those 
cultures.  
THRASHER: 
00:06:07 
The more I learned about the culture and the more in depth I 
got, I actually learned from the cultural role players we have 
there, as well, the actual Iraqi, Afghani, citizens. Basically, I 
learned a great deal. It's, kind of, hard to pinpoint one specific 
thing. Of particular interest is how Afghanis tend to settle things 
more over chai and what's called jirgas, village meetings. I was 
amazed at how, kind of, dark ages it is, to a degree. Because 
how often do you see a civilized westerner, or heck, even a 
civilized Middle Eastern country bring different villages together 
in one area to talk with a regional governor directly about 
problems? You don't really see that.  
THRASHER: 
00:06:55 
Now, Iraq, on the other hand, is more modernized. We learned 
about the parliamentary system or look past for a parliamentary 
system. And, of course, I mean, I knew about Afghanistan, prior, 
mainly because, me being a history buff. I mean, I knew all 
about Russian invasion, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but it went 
more in depth as to, how should I say? The cultural impact it left 
upon them. And, how more militant it made them. Not to 
mention, that's where Alexander the Great actually, kind of, had 
to make a stop because of malaria.  
SIMS: 
00:07:31 
It sounds like, because of your history interest, it's actually a 
pretty good fit, in terms of your job. What were the things that 
made it attractive for you, in that way? 
THRASHER: 
00:07:48 
Well, for me it's, like I said, you know, me being a history buff, 
it's a chance to actually learn about historical events from an 
alternate viewpoint. What kind of student of history would I be 
if all I did was take my own viewpoint? Not a very good one. 
SIMS: 
00:08:07 
Where does your interest in history come from? 
THRASHER: 
00:08:09 
To tell you the truth, I don't know. I've always, kind of, had ... I 
just had a passion for it, ever since I started learning about the 
Greeks and Romans in middle school. It just, kind of, spread like 
a plague, almost. But, these days, I'm more of a Far Eastern 
affairs type. You know, Japan more or less caught my eye. 
Because, Greece and Rome, I've done them to death. 
SIMS: 
00:08:36 
I guess I would say, I'm a history buff too. 
THRASHER: 
00:08:40 
Obviously. 
SIMS: 
00:08:43 
It's hard to know what started it. I can think of, even reading 
books in first grade. In a way that science was never ... You 
know, didn't have that same passion. But history was like, it 
wasn't hard at all to- 
THRASHER: 
00:08:55 
It's like it consumes you. 
SIMS: 
00:08:56 
Yeah, just, like, I would read it and I would get it and wouldn't 
have to study it. 
THRASHER: 
00:09:01 
Yeah. 
SIMS: 
00:09:02 
It feels like you can, sort of, just continually add on to it. Do you 
read a lot of history books? Is it websites? How do you engage 
with- 
THRASHER: 
00:09:14 
Books. Predominately books and attending lectures whenever I 
get a chance. Unfortunately, with my medical schedule these 
days, it's not as easy as it used to be. I used to go to classes that 
were, actually, meant for upperclassmen when I was a 
freshman, just to sit in and listen. I wasn't there for grades or 
advancement, it was just, I wanted to hear. 
SIMS: 
00:09:41 
Would you say, speaking of the other role player population, 
how would you put them on that scale of people interested in 
history? 
THRASHER: 
00:09:52 
Just like any kind of company, you've got the ones that are 
strictly there for a job, strictly there for a paycheck. You've got 
some that are actually, become interested after exposure. And 
then, you've got others that were all about it, from day one. 
Like I say, it's a standard hodgepodge like you would see in any 
other company. 
SIMS: 
00:10:11 
So, did you find a couple like-minded... 
THRASHER: 
00:10:15 
Oh, actually, quite a few. Quite a few. 
SIMS: 
00:10:18 
Can you tell me about who they are? What their background is? 
And, also, how did you find and connect with each other? 
THRASHER: 
00:10:26 
It's been so long, I cannot fully remember some of their names. I 
mean, I remember their faces. If you had pictures of them, I 
would know them.  
SIMS: 
00:10:34 
Can you describe their age and background, if you remember? 
THRASHER: 
00:10:40 
Generally speaking, I would actually get along with the elder 
population, ironically enough. Mainly because, well, they had 
something to teach me about a time that I've only read about. 
You only get so much information from a second hand source, 
I.e. textbooks.  
SIMS: 
00:10:56 
Right. 
THRASHER: 
00:10:57 
Because, as we all well know, it's all written with, whatever the 
writers frame of mind was, at the moment. Whereas, you get 
somebody who's actually a first-hand source, eyewitness, who 
lived through it, it's more intoxicating to me. It's almost like, 
basically, akin to the old archaic story tellers weaving a tale and 
passing the legends down by mouth. Of particular note, is a 
gentleman by the name of Lucky. 
SIMS: 
00:10:57 
Lucky? 
THRASHER: 
00:11:23 
That's how they addressed him, was Lucky. He was a Vietnam 
vet. Standard, salt of the earth, blue collar type guy. But, what 
amazed me was, despite those titles, how intelligent he was. 
And, of course, you know, I loved to hear his tales on 'Nam and 
growing up in that era. Of course, he always hated playing 
because it was usually over a game of dominoes. Because they 
actually encouraged us to play chess, play dominoes because 
those are actually pastimes of those cultures. Spades and 
dominoes are big. And chess, I had thought that I was a good 
player, until I met some of these cultural role players and I 
began to quickly have a diminishing opinion of my skill. 
SIMS: 
00:12:17 
Right. Wow. 
THRASHER: 
00:12:17 
But, if anything, it actually sharpened it and made me better. 
But, Lucky was one. Of course, you know, him being a fellow 
white male. At first, it kind of started off like ice, with regard to 
relationship, but we started discussing history. And how a lot of 
these kids these days don't really, fully get it. And because they 
don't get it, they're going to repeat the mistakes. 
THRASHER: 
00:12:43 
And then, he goes, "Hey, you know how to play dominoes?" 
"No." "Sit down, let me show you." Then, over dominoes, we 
started getting to know each other better. And, every time we 
saw each other, it was always going to be a discussion or 
debate. That's one. 
THRASHER: 
00:12:59 
Another one was a cultural role player by the name of Abbas. 
Very friendly man. Very kind. So, anytime I ever had a cultural 
question or just wanted to pick his brain, generally about his 
home country, he was more than happy to oblige. 
SIMS: 
00:13:18 
Was he from Iraq? 
THRASHER: 
00:13:19 
Yes. Iraqi. At first, when I first started working out there, it was 
pretty, heterozygotic with how many different Arab 
backgrounds you had. We, at one point, had Somali, Afghani, 
Oman, Yemen, Saudi, Kurdish, Iraqi, all pretty well under the 
same roof.  
SIMS: 
00:13:38 
And they were all meant to be Iraqi? I mean, in the scenario, 
basically? 
THRASHER: 
00:13:42 
Supposedly. Yes. 
SIMS: 
00:13:46 
Did that present any difficulties by, basically, having ... I assume 
these are all Arabic speakers, but not- 
THRASHER: 
00:13:53 
Different dialects. 
SIMS: 
00:13:54 
Yeah, not true Iraqis. Did that cause any- 
THRASHER: 
00:13:58 
Friction? 
SIMS: 
00:13:59 
Friction or complications in trying to represent ... I mean, it 
would be, kind of, like if we went somewhere and we were 
asked to represent Australia. 
THRASHER: 
00:13:59 
Yeah. Well. Yeah. 
SIMS: 
00:14:08 
So, there are some, like, commonalities, but- 
THRASHER: 
00:14:11 
Well, actually, from what I observed, no. They're all quite 
efficient. They all took their job pretty seriously. And, ironically 
enough, most of them have been Americanized, so they're used 
to being around different cultures. 
SIMS: 
00:14:21 
Right. 
THRASHER: 
00:14:23 
In terms of friction, if there was any, it would at a minimal. It's 
not like, there's no fist fights or stonings or anything like that 
going on. No, no, no, no, no. Actually, most of them are quite 
professional and quite friendly people. And, were actually just 
anxious to give something back to the country that accepted 
them. In which case, I actually found, kind of, endearing.  
SIMS: 
00:14:46 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So, like Abbas, what was his story? Do 
you remember how long had he been in the States?  
THRASHER: 
00:14:54 
Oh, he'd been in the States, I think, for well over a decade. He 
had come over from Iraq after the first Gulf War. I guess, seeing 
Saddam's madness was enough for him. Ran, applied asylum in 
U.S., and been living here since. 
SIMS: 
00:15:11 
Where did he live? And what type of other job did he have? Do 
you remember the story of living here? 
THRASHER: 
00:15:16 
I'd say I think he was a cab driver, but don't quote me on that, 
I'm not entirely sure, in Iraq. I mean, he's basic, general level 
education, like a standard human being is. Not everybody's 
running around with a four year master's or PhD. I guess you'd 
call him a average education level, but his intelligence level is 
actually pretty on point.  
THRASHER: 
00:15:44 
But what amazed me most is, after all the nonsense he's been 
through, is just how he retained a good bit of humanity through 
it all. Take a look at it. And, I do believe he had several cousins 
that were part of Saddam's military regime. Not, so much, that 
party members, but military. But, then again, many of them did 
have relatives that were Iraqi military. 
SIMS: 
00:16:08 
All right. 
THRASHER: 
00:16:10 
So, that's just one such example. An Afghani I met that actually, 
really was truly an interesting ... Cannot remember the 
gentleman's name, but he often played the governor for our 
region because you already know how the box is broke down. 
He was actually a fellow Poli Sci, History degree, so he and I 
would spend hours talking. And nine times out of ten, if we 
were in the same village, they always had me assigned as his 
bodyguard/driver. So, I had to carry him to all the meetings. In 
which case, he didn't play his role for real. He understood it was 
just fantasy.  
THRASHER: 
00:16:52 
If the man didn't have the standard Middle Eastern features, he 
had no accent whatsoever. None. And was very articulate. I 
could have sworn, he could have been one of my professors, at 
one point or another. He was quite brilliant. And he actually was 
the one who actually explained to me a lot of the issues with 
Afghanistan of why he believed it wasn't working, the rebuilding 
efforts.  
THRASHER: 
00:17:19 
And it's mainly because, take a look at, something like 90, 95% 
of their gross national product is foreign aid. And, geographical, 
of course, is an issue, but one's bred by another. That's, pretty 
well, what he taught me about. The whole issue, and, of course, 
I'm sitting there taking notes. Which, if anything, it made me 
more efficient at my job. 
SIMS: 
00:17:46 
Did the cultural role players, pretty much, every rotation, come 
back? I mean, like, the same folks? 
THRASHER: 
00:17:52 
For the most part. I mean, sometimes you'll get new faces, 
sometimes you won't. But, for the most part, the core ones, 
they kept coming back. Mainly because of their stellar 
performance. 
SIMS: 
00:18:01 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Would they know that you got along 
with this guy well, and that he liked you, and that's why they 
would pair you often? As like, you would be the 
bodyguard/driver? Or was there no constant to how that 
worked? 
THRASHER: 
00:18:22 
Sometimes when ... It just depends upon your assignment. For 
example, I started out as just Joe Schmo, villager. Mainly 
because, you know, I was doing it on the weekends and going to 
school during the week. When I graduated college, I was able to 
dedicate more time to it until I wanted to figure out what I was 
going to do next. They originally started me out as a, ironically 
enough, a cop. What's called a green cop.  
THRASHER: 
00:18:51 
And, I'm sure you know the rules behind that. I started off as a 
green cop, which, I guess, quickly they, kind of, noted that I 
started to arouse suspicion amongst units because, you know, 
military age male. They're like, so how can we use that to 
advantage for training? So, I didn't stay a cop very long. And 
they ended up making me a supply runner for O.P.F.O.R's IED 
cell network.  
SIMS: 
00:19:18 
So, tell me about that job. 
THRASHER: 
00:19:21 
Oh, that one was fun, actually. Because, so often, we're all 
trained to be good guys. We're always told, you're going to be a 
cop or a criminal. It allowed me to actually explore a darker 
aspect of the human nature. Basically, what it is, is I'd meet up 
with an opposing force member and be like, "Okay, here's the 
scenario. We're going to try to run IEDs here, here and here. It's 
the U.S.'s job to find them. We're not going to make it easy on 
them. You guys, you know, you're going to be carrying different 
components. You're going to have a box cell phone that we can 
call each other on. Hopefully, the Army will pick up on our cell 
phone traffic and capture us and, or eliminate us." Sometimes 
the Army was exceptionally good at catching folks. Sometimes 
not. I once went almost an entire rotation without being 
captured. Other rotations, I didn't last five minutes because 
they were already looking for me. 
SIMS: 
00:20:20 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). When you did last longer, are you, 
basically, constantly, moving around in this role? And spending 
hours sitting in the woods? 
THRASHER: 
00:20:33 
Well, it just depends upon the scenario. Like, nine times out of 
ten, I was mobile. But, of course, they, kind of, give you eye 
catching vehicles to ... I mean, for example, how many Afghanis 
are you going to see rolling around in a Land Rover? 
SIMS: 
00:20:48 
Right. 
THRASHER: 
00:20:49 
Not many. So, I mean, that was my view of, I'm like, "Sheesh, 
why don't you just give me a pair of Roman candles and have 
me just stand out in a field and say here I am?" But you'd be 
surprised sometimes they overlook the obvious. I mean, heck, I 
rolled up to a TCP once- 
SIMS: 
00:21:06 
Check point? 
THRASHER: 
00:21:07 
Yeah. Traffic Control Point. 
SIMS: 
00:21:09 
Okay. 
THRASHER: 
00:21:11 
Which, of course, you know, at this time, the region was still 
destabilizing, you'd have increased security measures to protect 
the local populace. He actually, literally, held up a Wanted, of 
me, face to face and he was like, "Oh, this ain't the guy. This guy 
is clean shaven." And I had, like, a bright red beard going on. 
SIMS: 
00:21:32 
Wow. 
THRASHER: 
00:21:32 
But, no, the bad part was, I had a stack of, like, over a billion 
afghanis on my dashboard because I wasn't expecting the TCP 
to be there. I'm just sitting there like- 
SIMS: 
00:21:43 
And then you just rolled on through? 
THRASHER: 
00:21:46 
Yeah, but, I mean, no harm, no foul. I wasn't carrying any 
components. I was just bored and wanted to go visit another 
village. So, I guess they figured I was a banker or something. 
SIMS: 
00:21:56 
Right. 
THRASHER: 
00:21:56 
But, anyways, they let me through. Not even two seconds of 
getting to the village I was going to visit, squad of soldiers was 
already around me, "Get out. Get out." I'm like, "Okay." Then, of 
course, ROE, you have to answer, when they ask you certain 
questions, a certain way. You can choose not to make it easy on 
them, but, that's just going to let them to stay in connectivity. 
But, nine times out of ten, if you're an IED cell member or 
you're counter intelligence, to the bad guys, you get caught, 
you're, what's called, face contaminated. They move you to 
another part of the box. Give you another role. So, you can 
finish out the scenario that they have set up. So, it really just- 
SIMS: 
00:21:56 
...face contaminated. 
THRASHER: 
00:22:42 
Well, no, because, I mean, they can't keep you in that area 
because all the units now know you. Because the first thing, one 
of the new systems they had out was the BATS and HIIDE 
system. 
SIMS: 
00:22:51 
What's that? 
THRASHER: 
00:22:52 
Biometrics. So, it wouldn't have mattered if they would of 
doctored me up and try to change my appearance. Bottom line 
is, they had my profile. So, face contaminated. 
SIMS: 
00:23:03 
So, when you were ...   
THRASHER: 
00:23:00 
... my profile, so fase containment did. 
SIMS: 
00:23:03 
A when you were reassigned to another part of the box, are you 
the same character or are you like-? 
THRASHER: 
00:23:07 
Somebody completely different. 
SIMS: 
00:23:10 
Right. So did that ever happen, and then you happened to come 
across the people who may be arrested you the first time, and 
then have to-? 
THRASHER: 
00:23:19 
Yes, that's actually happened before. 
SIMS: 
00:23:22 
And do they think you're the original person or how does that 
work?  
THRASHER: 
00:23:28 
The soldier is doing their job. It's like, "Wait a minute, I just 
captured this guy." They'll go to move in again. You'll see they're 
like, "Oh no, no, no, no."  It's like, "He may have been on this 
side, but he's just passing through this. He's from a different 
region altogether. Check his ID. He won't show up in the 
system." Because they scrub me from the system afterwards, 
which, I mean, it's kinda like a deja vu in The Matrix almost, to 
steal a phrase, but it makes sense.  
SIMS: 
00:23:56 
Yeah. I mean otherwise it's- 
THRASHER: 
00:23:58 
Otherwise it kind of blows the realism of the scenario. I mean, it 
does happen on occasion, but not as often as one would think. 
I'd say maybe once in a blue moon, unless of course she has got 
one that was just one role player that was carrying the role a 
little too far and made a overwhelmingly lasting impression on 
the individual, which that's happened before, too, but nine 
times out of 10 they'll probably just dismiss it, which 
understandably so.  
SIMS: 
00:24:30 
So when you're sort of playing the bad guy, like, I talked to 
someone else who was a master thief, and she said that was her 
favorite job because it was fun. I think that was like a sort of a- 
THRASHER: 
00:24:46 
It's a departure from social norm, because most of us are 
trained to be law abiding citizens, and now here you are being 
told to break the rules. Basically think like a pirate, and what's 
more fun than trying to be Johnny Depp?  
SIMS: 
00:25:03 
So when you would first meet up, like in that role with the 
509th people, they don't yet have the cell phone that you give 
them. So how does it, how do you all- 
THRASHER: 
00:25:15 
Communicate?  
SIMS: 
00:25:16 
Yeah, like how does it get started?  
THRASHER: 
00:25:18 
Well actually, here's how it works. As the civilian side of the role 
play side of the house, the operations will actually issue the 
same cell phones you guys use. So all four team members 
report in. Whoever the highest tier personality is in that team of 
suppliers, they'll get a cell phone, and then they'll distribute the 
numbers to everybody else, because theirs will be forthcoming. 
But the team leader and the, you know, Al-Qaeda, whomever 
they were at the time, they would only have the team leader's 
number, and the team leader would keep everybody close the 
first day or so and be like, "All right, hey, here's the set orders. 
So we don't give them too much of an easy time. Why don't you 
meet me at these coordinates or meet me in this village, 
considering it's friendly Dora Coss."  
THRASHER: 
00:26:07 
Okay, we'll all mount up, go. Then we'll get a operations brief in 
person. Then after that we start powering up cell phones and 
trying to leave a digital footprint.  
SIMS: 
00:26:18 
Right. So when you're with say, if it's just you and a 509th guy, 
are you all 100% in character, because there's not necessarily 
like OCs or RTU around, how does that-? 
THRASHER: 
00:26:34 
I mean, when we're there, it's not 100% in character. It's more 
relaxed, more like a standard office meeting. Now however, if 
RTU or the police force or whatever shows up, then it starts to 
get in character, and we start to pretend like we don't know 
each other. We'll make eye contact with each other, won't even 
greet each other, nothing. As a matter of fact, we try to stay as 
separate from each other as humanly possible, only until the 
scenario gets deeper, and it's like, "Okay, these guys aren't 
really picking up on the subtle hints we're leaving behind. Let's 
up the ante a little bit." 
THRASHER: 
00:27:11 
It's basically like a probing offensive. It's like, oh poke, hint, hint, 
wink, wink. Okay, they don't get it. Let's do something a little bit 
more drastic.  
SIMS: 
00:27:20 
And do you all make that sort of executive decision to...it, or is it 
kind of, nothing's happening, so OC might say-? 
THRASHER: 
00:27:31 
Yeah, it's all OC directed. Now, we do have general guidelines 
and standards that we're given from our operations side of the 
house, the civilian side of the house, which we don't go beyond, 
don't do no more, no less. However, if 509th or OC says, "Hey, 
we're carrying this a bit further." They're on the ground. They 
have executive decision over that. Just as long I don't go around 
picking up weapons or trying to become an active combatant.  
THRASHER: 
00:28:02 
Nine Times out of 10, 509th or OC is going to make that call for 
you, but they're going to rely on you to ham it up and put the 
flair on it, put a little rip flair into it. And it also depends, if we're 
operating independent, like for example, I'm at a cache point 
and I've got certain components or whatever, and I see RTU 
coming- 
SIMS: 
00:28:26 
The cache point meaning where you-?  
THRASHER: 
00:28:29 
The centralized stash, pretty much. You know, you understand 
the cache. Well, if I see RTU coming, or they're trying to get 
close to me, yeah, I make executive decisions to try to evade or 
not engage them at all.  My main point is to avoid capture up to 
a point and then eventually it's going to be, okay, we've got to 
give you up, because they're not getting it.  
THRASHER: 
00:28:55 
They, hopefully by capturing you, give them a little bit of intel 
and point them in the right direction.  
SIMS: 
00:29:02 
So, it sounds like being an IED network requires a certain skill 
and experience and thinking on your feet that not every role 
player could do. Right? I'm certain, like mobility and just 
excitement for the job. Is that like a promotion? Are you paid 
more to do that?  
THRASHER: 
00:29:34 
No, the payment isn't much different. It's just more or less the 
freedoms and more integral part of the scenario. Playing a more 
a vital role with regard to the training, in which case I was happy 
to do that, mainly because it allowed me to think on my feet 
and be a little bit more adaptive in my behavior.  
SIMS: 
00:29:55 
You would prefer that compared to sitting in the village? 
THRASHER: 
00:29:59 
Yeah, and I mean even when I was a cop, I had a level of free 
reign I was permitted. Like for example, if I was pointing a Green 
Cop and I saw somebody posting graffiti or anti-American 
posters, I could actually, technically, arrest the citizen and turn 
them over to the U.S. and let the U.S. do their thing. So that was 
a lot of fun.  
SIMS: 
00:30:19 
So is there any part of, especially when you have more freedom 
to make these executive decisions, and you're in this world that 
in your mind, that is evocative of playing video games or 
something else that you did as a child? Or does it not sort of 
connect in that way? 
THRASHER: 
00:30:40 
With regard to relating to a video game, not particularly. It's like 
... sorry, throat. 
THRASHER: 
00:30:48 
It's more like living a novel. Your character's already written. 
What isn't written is the character's journey, which you're 
pretty well painting as you go, within the constraints of what 
the author. i.e., the scenario writers want. It's sort of like 
becoming the lovable three dimensional character that you 
thought was two dimensional. 
SIMS: 
00:31:11 
Right. So what would be, for like the IED network guy, what's 
the paragraph or whatever that you're given? 
THRASHER: 
00:31:20 
I mean, it changes from team to team and effort to effort. 
Sometimes, I was the lead supplier, so I'm your money man, 
slash price negotiator, or in my case, gouger, because I was kind 
of playing both sides. Other times I've been just so low as a wire 
man or an electronics component man. It just depends, because 
it changed scenario to scenario.  
SIMS: 
00:31:49 
Were there any biographical details, like if you were an actor, 
you could sort of latch on and be like, okay this is going to fill 
out my personality side of it? Not so much the, like stretch- 
THRASHER: 
00:32:02 
The nitty gritty. Actually yes, a lot of the times, yes. They give 
you an educational level, what your personal ... particularly with 
the IED cell network, what your issue is with the American 
occupation forces or what your issue is with a new interim 
government. I mean, it gave you a pretty decent rundown. So it 
wasn't like it's a blank script.  
SIMS: 
00:32:29 
So what would be some of the issues that-? 
THRASHER: 
00:32:30 
Like for example, my guy was ... when I was usually the head, I 
was a head Bathist. I was a Bathist party member. I was a 
staunch believer in the regime and it upset the status quo, 
because my family enjoyed privileges that others didn't, 
because they were Loyalist Party.  
THRASHER: 
00:32:48 
Now with that stripped away, you might say, rich boy's a little 
mad at the world. Or at least that's the way I played it, because I 
had the air of arrogance, so I was better than you, because I was 
a Loyalist Party member. The good part was, was the U.S. was 
picking up on that, how I didn't rub shoulders with the locals. I 
don't know, usually by myself, smoking a cigar, reading the 
paper. When they tried to approach me, I pretty well just 
snubbed them or just disregarded them all together, which 
made me more interesting to them. It was like, "Well, what's 
got this guy acting so much better than everybody else?"  
SIMS: 
00:33:22 
Who is it among the RTU? Is it officers? Is there like civil affairs 
people? Whose job is it to pick up on this, like human 
intelligence, or most of it? It's supposed to be every soldier. 
THRASHER: 
00:33:36 
Well, the HUMINT teams, usually that's their main area of focus, 
and the civil affairs is mainly there to, you know, hearts and 
minds. But generally speaking, nine times out of 10, anytime 
I've ever been caught, it was actually just by a common soldier.  
THRASHER: 
00:33:54 
It's kind of like a beat cop. It is certain aspects that, when 
they're doing their standardized patrols, just kind of like a 
passive analysis of someone. Kind of like how a cop would go 
into a certain scenarios. Like, he's not doing anything yet, but 
something suspicious about .. like intuition, almost.  
SIMS: 
00:34:13 
What's the protocol? I could see it being enough that if you're a 
military age man, you're aloof, you're smoking and reading your 
newspaper- 
THRASHER: 
00:34:25 
Not caring. 
SIMS: 
00:34:26 
Right. What are they allowed to do to you? 
THRASHER: 
00:34:32 
Nothing really. I mean, so long as I'm not actively violating law 
or they don't have sufficient evidence to go through the local 
magistrate for a warrant for questioning or arrest. They really 
can't do too much of anything. Just keep an eye on, or come 
over and attempt to get to know. Just standard, "Hey, how you 
doing?" 
THRASHER: 
00:34:54 
I mean, the things I could request to me, as they could request 
my ID, and if it for some reason raised a red flag, but not 
actively pursuing, just more or less person of interest, then 
they'd actually put you in BASS and HIDE system, in which case, 
that way if you ever were suspect or something, you'd pop up 
again. It's like, "Ha ha, we got you now." 
THRASHER: 
00:35:19 
It's not exactly like they just walked around, like Britain, just 
randomly imprisoning colonists. That's not the way that worked. 
They actually had pretty strict rules of engagement with regard 
to that. It's not how video games and media portray it.  
SIMS: 
00:35:38 
So they would actually go and get warrants sometimes? 
THRASHER: 
00:35:41 
Actually, yeah, if they had a solid enough case against 
somebody that was known to be a bad guy, they'd notionally go 
through the whole chain of command of how to do it, because 
they even had law enforcement professionals out there, like 10, 
20 year cops, that would actually guide soldiers through the 
process. At that time we were trying to transition from an 
occupation force to advisors, at that point. 
THRASHER: 
00:36:10 
Let's be real. That really the U.S. military's job to go around 
handing out warrants. That's not exactly what they do. So they 
had to actually be brought up to speed on the process of that. 
And of course that's where also the Afghanis, Iraqis came in, 
because they had more firsthand knowledge of how the interim 
government was working with that. So that's actually pretty 
interesting.  
SIMS: 
00:36:30 
So times when you were caught, how would you describe that 
feeling of being caught? Is it a disappointment or a big deal, or 
is it just sort of, this happens?  
THRASHER: 
00:36:45 
Sometimes it is part of the job. Other times it was more like a 
petty annoyance. It's sort of like, "Okay, how did they get onto 
me? I know I wasn't running anything. I know I didn't take any 
cell phone. How did they catch me?" And it's more like, " Where 
did I mess up?" Other times this was sort of like, "It's about 
time." 
SIMS: 
00:37:08 
Did they tell you? Were there times when it's just like, I still 
have no idea how they caught me? 
THRASHER: 
00:37:14 
Well, I mean, usually on my way out, I'd be like, "So hey, OC, 
how did these guys catch me?"  "Oh I gave you up." Or, "One of 
your boys dimed you." Sometimes they would write scenarios 
where other bad guys would dime one of the bad guys out for a 
higher purpose. Throw them a bone, so they can get away with 
something else. Just like real life.  
SIMS: 
00:37:41 
So what are some of the, besides cop and a IED network dude, 
did you play that you remember?  
THRASHER: 
00:37:52 
I was also a homeless college student that got trapped after I 
got kicked off- 
SIMS: 
00:38:01 
Like a western college student? 
THRASHER: 
00:38:04 
No, no, no, no, no, no. An Iraqi national, who was a student in 
the state side who got caught when the war kicked off and can't 
get back. I've even been in scenarios to where I've been ... This 
one's going to make me sound really bad. I've been in scenarios 
to where I've been the gentlemen who gives false information 
to the U.S., to lead them into an ambush.  
SIMS: 
00:38:32 
What do they call that job?  
THRASHER: 
00:38:34 
Counterintelligence. I throw them a false bone. They chase it, all 
four lights him up. I've also been instigator, agitator seeking 
medical attention. The rules I played out there are various. 
Towards the end of my tenure there and my transition into the 
U.S, Navy, I spent most of my time doing live fire exercises and 
working with SF. Different scenarios there, so those were fun 
too.  
SIMS: 
00:39:09 
Are there some rotations that are just SF rotations, or are they 
augmenting-? 
THRASHER: 
00:39:16 
Actually, in a lot of cases, there are some rotations that are just 
strictly special forces, because they have different needs that 
need to be met by the contractor.  
SIMS: 
00:39:29 
And how are those different, would you say?  
THRASHER: 
00:39:29 
They're a little bit more intense. You got to be on your A game 
with those ones, because let's be real, there's a reason why 
they're special forces. They're highly intelligent, highly 
motivated and highly experienced. So if you're not really 
portraying your role the best way you know how, they're going 
to pick it apart and the training value just disintegrates from 
there.  
SIMS: 
00:39:51 
So that's something that was, I think, new to me when I started 
doing these projects, which was, I guess a variety of jobs in the 
Army and essentially the gradation of skill level. How would you 
describe, relative to a normal rotation on a unit, this SF skill 
level, being exponentially advanced or like what-? 
THRASHER: 
00:40:24 
They're definitely highly advanced, and beyond that it's their 
own experiences in the field that they're drawing on, in order to 
sharpen their skills even further. So you have guys that are 
already combat tested and combat hardened, but not only that, 
possess critical thinking skills outside of the chain of command, 
because you have to realize SF's chain of command is way 
different.  
THRASHER: 
00:40:47 
With SF, each soldier, they may be a part of a team, but they all 
have their own individual method that they go about, by 
accomplishing a mission, which makes them very unpredictable 
with regard to how they're going to react to certain scenarios. 
Not like in terms of aggression, but in terms of how they're 
going to go about solving it.  
THRASHER: 
00:41:08 
So when you're doing bad guy roles there, you need to be 
exceptionally mindful of what you're doing, because even the 
slightest little clue you leave behind to one of these gentlemen 
that is highly intelligent like this and highly trained, they can 
pretty well bust apart your sell pretty quickly. It just depends 
on, really, how you want to play it.  
THRASHER: 
00:41:32 
Oh, sorry, sorry. It's the AC. Would you mind if I grabbed some 
tea real quick?  
SIMS: 
00:41:38 
Oh, sure.  
THRASHER: 
00:41:39 
Am I giving you what you need? 
SIMS: 
00:41:41 
Yeah, it's perfect. Thank you.  
THRASHER: 
00:41:44 
Sure you want no tea or anything?  
SIMS: 
00:41:46 
I'm fine, thank you.  
THRASHER: 
00:41:55 
Now, it's like, SF didn't blink. Let's just put it that way.  
SIMS: 
00:41:55 
Yeah.  
THRASHER: 
00:41:58 
Actually, they're among my favorite units to work with, because 
you really have to bring something to the table. In my case it's 
unpredictability. I found it the best, in one sense of what it's to 
be in Iraq. You know, strategy and maybe being a huge student 
kind of Sun Tzu. Kind of made sense to be formless.  
SIMS: 
00:42:25 
Right.  
THRASHER: 
00:42:28 
Not to mention, some of the SF OCs were some of the greatest 
guys you'll ever meet.  
THRASHER: 
00:42:28 
Use the restroom? 
SIMS: 
00:42:28 
Yeah, that'd be great.  
THRASHER: 
00:42:28 
Back real soon.  
SIMS: 
00:42:28 
Hi. 
Relative: 
00:42:28 
Hi. 
SIMS: 
00:42:28 
I'm doing fine. 
Relative: 
00:42:29 
Okay.  
Relative: 
00:42:30 
We're actually going to transition over. I'll give you my cell for 
locations.  
Relative: 
00:42:30 
We're over now. We're sorry. We started with staff rotations.  
Relative: 
00:42:30 
[inaudible 00:43:38].  
Relative: 
00:42:30 
It's all about the [inaudible 00:43:48]. 
Relative: 
00:42:30 
Don't worry about it. [inaudible 00:43:52] 
Relative: 
00:42:30 
Huh? 
Relative: 
00:42:30 
[inaudible 00:43:53]. 
Relative: 
00:42:30 
The water's up here.  
THRASHER: 
00:42:30 
Oh, I'm sorry. How often am I over here? 
THRASHER: 
00:44:06 
Yeah, and I explained it. It was kind of like a weekend retreat 
area. 
Relative: 
00:44:07 
Yeah, it is, a home away from home. Excuse me.  
THRASHER: 
00:44:11 
Yeah, of course, I'm in Baton Rouge there, as usual.  
Relative: 
00:44:14 
Okay. You want some more water? 
SIMS: 
00:44:17 
I think I'm good.  
SIMS: 
00:44:22 
That's right. It's not too far away, right? If you go the weekend. 
THRASHER: 
00:44:26 
Well, Baton Rouge is about a three hour drive, but luckily, I 
bypass a lot of the areas and it makes it easier. Then it only like 
45 minutes to an hour. But when 190's not any more done- 
SIMS: 
00:44:44 
Yeah, I don't know if I came up ... It's only three hours away. 
Yeah.  
THRASHER: 
00:44:50 
Yeah, that's actually the route I used to take when I was going 
to school. Am I answering the questions adequately? 
SIMS: 
00:45:00 
Oh, yeah. It's been great. I mean, it's fun to talk about you guys. 
Everybody has- 
THRASHER: 
00:45:02 
A different take? 
SIMS: 
00:45:03 
A pretty different take, yeah. 
THRASHER: 
00:45:06 
Myself, the conventional ones? 
SIMS: 
00:45:11 
Didn't have as much passion. Mostly the older people, maybe 
exclusively. So, I think that's one of the more...things, that most 
people, they don't have the, aren't as... , you know.  
THRASHER: 
00:45:28 
Cool. Yeah, that's better. 
SIMS: 
00:45:28 
Feel better?  
THRASHER: 
00:45:29 
Yeah, a little congestion. Little roll ups, you know, the seasonal 
change. 
Crew: 
00:45:37 
That was nice to be not used for manual labor for change.  
Crew: 
00:45:48 
And we're back live. 
SIMS: 
00:45:49 
We're back. We're back live. You're all back here in the studio. 
What ways do you think the role playing-? 
SIMS: 
00:46:00 
What ways do you think the roleplaying could have been 
improved from where it was? 
THRASHER: 
00:46:11 
What you pose there is a more interesting question. I think in 
the way of scenario development, you try to be as modern as 
you can and as most current as you can with what's going on 
over there. That I get. Just certain aspects or scenarios had too 
many rigid guidelines placed on it from higher ups or 
whomever. That’s above my pay grade. Not that I'm knocking 
them. I understand why they did what they did for safety sake. 
This is probably why it would have been better to have more 
younger males out there doing this kind of stuff. However, some 
of the limitations placed on certain scenarios I feel seriously 
diminished the scenario. 
SIMS: 
00:47:02 
Like what? What type of limitations? 
THRASHER: 
00:47:04 
Well the fact that generally speaking, you weren't allowed to 
actively aid or unless we were assigned that role, and you 
couldn’t take a little bit of more liberty with regard to how the 
town is. Like for example, even in a yellow town that's 
contentious but not exactly friendly, nice, neutral, there's going 
to be elements of the city that are going to support the bad 
guys regardless of even if the town is green because I mean ... 
Town’s not going to ... Just because it's green doesn't mean 
everybody in this population is all pro-U.S. apple pie and beer 
on Sunday. I'm just saying. 
THRASHER: 
00:47:45 
A lot of times they would even tell me like ... I’m like, “Hey, 
listen, my character is a bad guy and you want me to be friendly 
towards U.S. This doesn't make sense.” He’s like, “Everybody's 
green, so you're green now.” That’s not exactly a realistic 
portrayal because I imagine if I had a beef with the U.S. or 
interim government and I was to the point to where I was 
actively aiding the enemy, I'm not just going to magically have a 
change of heart. 
SIMS: 
00:48:15 
I guess by the same token it strikes me that there’s not a lot of 
grey in peoples role, or is that accurate to say? Are people 
pretty clearly ... 
THRASHER: 
00:48:27 
Well, actually, there's neutral parties too. There's opportunistic 
individual ... I forgot to mention that there's opportunistic 
individuals that can be shifted either way. They're usually within 
your police force or your medical area or in your local 
government, which of course why everybody thinks that 
anybody who is involved in politics, policing or medicine is 
automatically neutral is beyond me, but makes sense. 
THRASHER: 
00:48:57 
Heck, and we even had religious leaders that were bribable. 
Those ones were the interesting ones. They were actually pretty 
funny, particularly see you one minute, they say, “Hey, welcome 
America. Come on in to our mosque, next day get lost.” It’s like 
... The neutral ones were the fun characters to watch how they 
developed over time. Mine ... I know a lot of times I was pretty 
cut and dry which one I was. 
SIMS: 
00:49:23 
What’s your favor story or stories from either something you 
participated in directly or something you heard about second 
hand about what happened? 
THRASHER: 
00:49:37 
This one was my first year back after getting my degrees. My 
mother was a shift leader out there and I was assigned to do a 
specialized MIMNs event, which is like a sub-story to the main 
plot. I was to take a frequency analyzer and start getting the 
Dukes and Warlock system that they used to jam radio signals 
and infrared signals to IEDs from one of the bases. My mother 
was actually giving me the briefing, and she's like, “Hon, don't 
worry. They’re not going to shoot at you. You're not going to 
die. You'll be back in time to your village to continue your IED 
cell member role.” 
THRASHER: 
00:50:21 
Of course me being a smart alec 22 year old just rolled my eyes 
because I knew full well that's not how this is going to go down. 
I linked up with my mother just outside the perimeter of the 
gate. She gave me the frequency analyzer, was like, “All right, 
you know the deal.” “Yeah, I pull right up to the front of the 
gate, start analyzing. They attempt to capture me, I book it.” 
THRASHER: 
00:50:41 
I'm just sitting there analyzing things, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
They start hollering at me. Have the translator with the bullhorn 
yelling at me, “Hey, drop what you're doing, get down, get 
down.” Of course you know me. I'm not understanding English 
or not understanding it. I turned around and I'm still analyzing 
the whole field. They don't dispatch a quick reaction force team 
to go get me. No, no. This unit in particular just started 
shooting. 
THRASHER: 
00:51:09 
I slung the frequency analyzer and I started making like 
Sebastian Coll, and my mother was on the far side of the hill, on 
the opposite side trying to ... Of course, she heard, “Hey shots 
fired,” FOB Warrior. She tries to pull up, and before she can 
even run up the hill to see whether I've been killed or not, I'm 
already halfway down the hill saying, “Won't shoot at me, huh?” 
The OC was actually trying to keep up with me, so I got back to 
her truck, tossed the frequency analyzer, got my vehicle 
cranked up trying to get out of dodge. The OC finally catches up 
to me and knocks on the window, and goes, “Dude, you can 
sure run.” 
SIMS: 
00:51:50 
You made it, and so you didn’t die. 
THRASHER: 
00:51:50 
No, no, no. I evaded them, but barely. Literally ... Well my whole 
thing was I didn’t want to give up that role. I liked being in the 
cell. Another ... 
SIMS: 
00:52:00 
Thanks mom. 
THRASHER: 
00:52:01 
Yeah, pretty much. Well I knew they were going to shoot at me 
because this unit had been pretty aggressive, so I figured they 
weren’t going to be in the talking mood. It’s not that mom fed 
me bad intel. That’s not the case. Another fun anecdote I have 
is I was actually working a SOF live fire. 
SIMS: 
00:52:25 
What does that mean? 
THRASHER: 
00:52:26 
Special operations forces’ live fire exercise where they're 
actually using live training rounds. Of course, got my vest, 
helmet, goggles, the whole nine yards. Them and O.P.F.O.R. 
actually legitimately exchanging live fire, except it's not like 
actual rounds. They're like hardened paint rounds, but they still 
hurt pretty bad. 
THRASHER: 
00:52:48 
My job was I was to be a cab driver that was in the wrong place 
at the wrong time, so I was sleeping on the roof of this 
compound. SF’s job was they were going to quick rope in, bring 
their black ops in quick rope in or make their way in from the 
wood line. They would breach the gate of the compound I was 
sleeping on the roof of, go room to room looking for me, 
mistake my identity for somebody else and out more guys 
apprehend me. Then my main job was to lead them to where 
the bad guy was because the story of the cab driver is, “Hey, I'd 
just move this guy out. He said I could stay here. He even paid 
me to stay here, but if you let me go, I can tell you where he's 
at.” This was a MARSOC, Marine Special Operations. 
THRASHER: 
00:53:34 
I'm sitting, pretending to sleep and I'm talking to SFOC, and like 
so I was like, "Hey, Sgt. Troy, you know how they're going to 
come in?” He goes, “Yeah, from what I understand, they’re just 
going to breach via just climbing over the walls.” I’m like, “Okay, 
that doesn’t sound so bad.” He goes, “Yeah, they were pretty 
insistent that they were going to be quick and quiet.” Wrong. 
No, they actually blew the compound gate off its hinges using 
det cord, detonation cord. They just like blew the hinges off the 
gate. The next thing I know, I just hear flash bangs being thrown 
on every level. I just look at the OC like, “You're going to get me 
killed, aren't you?” 
THRASHER: 
00:54:17 
Anyways, they come busting in on the roo ... They burst in 
under the roof. All I see is weapons pointing at the face. Get 
down, get down, and I’m like ... No, he hood me, they dragged 
me down. Well their team leader is waiting. He unhoods me and 
looks at me. “This ain’t him. Sorry sir, here’s a couple of 
thousand Afghans. Sorry.” Then they take off, and I'm like, “The 
OC is "Like, say something." "Excuse me, GI, I speak little 
English. I can tell you where you can find him.” Like, “Really?” 
They pull out a map to show us. I’m, “Okay, he’s right here. 
Good luck guys.” “ Where you think you're going?” They give me 
a Kevlar and actually put into their Humvees and actually drive 
me to the site, and he goes, “Are you sure this is the place?” 
THRASHER: 
00:55:11 
Then of course notional RPGs and fire starts ringing out. I’m like, 
“I think so.” Then I just started tearing rear and down the center 
of the street. Ironic. Every time I've ever been shot at, she's 
been involved. I’m beginning to resent it. 
THRASHER: 
00:55:29 
Another funny anecdote is a ... This actually happened to one of 
my buddies, a gentleman by the name of Cody Evan. He'd been 
tasked with feeding the intel on movements in a certain village 
because I was using that as a safe house, and of course he was a 
yellow character, so I can bribe him. I was looking at a few 
hundred thousand Afghans, and he's, “Hey, they're moving out 
here, here, here and here." 
THRASHER: 
00:56:02 
Well anyways, they had caught wise to what he was doing, so 
they came over to question him and he just started doing his 
head banger routine. He goes, “You don’t look very Afghani. 
Was your daddy Russian?” He goes, “Russian Metal!” The OC 
just couldn't keep a straight face and rolled out. From then on 
they knew him as metal head. Then the fact that what was 
worse was when they actually had a ... he and I working 
together because we fed off of each other's nonsensical 
behavior. 
THRASHER: 
00:56:35 
I got thousands of stories for out there. It was quite an 
experience, but sometimes it wasn't always action and improv. 
Sometimes it could just get downright boring dependent upon 
what they had you assigned to. Like me when I was a good cop, 
they usually had me assigned in a big city. I spent most of my 
day just aimlessly patrolling. 
SIMS: 
00:57:00 
Why did you give it up? 
THRASHER: 
00:57:06 
I had met a very beautiful young lady that I'm actually marrying 
this November in college, and figured the best way to support 
her was to go through the service, provide us a little stability 
until we could make our next move. Needless to say, my next 
move after the Navy was to become a medic, and now here I 
am going through nursing school, which is probably something I 
should have done from the beginning, but that's the beautiful 
part about life. It’s always a journey. 
SIMS: 
00:57:40 
You didn’t meet her in a box did you? 
THRASHER: 
00:57:42 
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. God no. Can you imagine that? 
SIMS: 
00:57:47 
I did meet a couple of ones. I’m basically thinking ... Their first 
date basically is spending 12 hour days, right, like- 
THRASHER: 
00:57:59 
You do get very close with your core group. I will say that. That 
is true, but no, I was thinking more along lines in terms of the 
comedic effect of she'd have to impress her supervisor/my 
mom if I met her on the box. God, can you imagine? That’d be 
hell, especially if a breakup were to occur. I met her in college 
and she was always fascinated by the job I did because we’d be 
living together. 
THRASHER: 
00:58:26 
I'd just be here for a week and a half, two weeks, come back 
with a full beard, no ... wearing Afghani attire or Iraqi attire and 
she’s looking at me a little suspicious, like, “What in the name of 
God are you doing?” Or what's worse is that sometimes ... See, I 
made it a habit to try to pick up as much of the language as I 
could to make it as realistic as I could. Some nights, some of the 
live-fire scenarios because they happened at night, and I’d be 
drained. After like 18-20 hours I'd come home. I'd be dead in my 
sleep, and she'd say I was carrying on a conversation in Arabic 
and it scared her. Might well it should. It’s kind of a combative 
language. 
SIMS: 
00:59:07 
Did you formally ... Did you get tapes or do you just talk to 
people and pick it up that way? 
THRASHER: 
00:59:11 
Actually talk to them via interview. I’d find one that was 
struggling with English or had a really nasty accent. I said, “You 
know what? I’ll help you with your accent if you teach me some 
phrases, teach me how language works.” Usually that’s no 
problem and they were more than happy to help. You'd be 
surprised how actually kind most Iraqi, Afghani really are. It’s 
kind of like they come into it not knowing what to expect out of 
an American sometimes. You come out of it because ... Well 
let’s be real. It's not something a lot of us have a huge amount 
of experience with. 
THRASHER: 
00:59:57 
In the end, I guess that phrase is all true. Everybody believes the 
same. I’m very similar, but what amazed me is when you usually 
made a good impression on them, they usually brought you into 
the group. Because Arabs for the most part will be pretty 
homogenous and hang out with their own crew. I get invited to 
a lot of groups and they’d all bombard me with things to learn 
and anything I wanted to learn, culture and history. They were 
more than happy to teach and I was more than happy to learn 
because how else am I going to play this particular ethnicity and 
not know because anybody with any kind of intelligence that 
they're interrogating me. 
THRASHER: 
01:00:37 
If I don't exhibit these certain traits, it's not going to have any 
value. They'll go through combat thinking it's that easy and 
probably end up either failing the mission, getting themselves 
killed or worse yet, somebody else killed. That was the whole 
bullet point of why I was so proficient and thorough in what I 
did. Did I go out of the line sometimes? Yes, but it was generally 
for a reason. It wasn't like I was just doing it on a whim. 
SIMS: 
01:01:06 
In terms of engaging with a certain flourish. 
THRASHER: 
01:01:10 
Yeah, taking a little bit more artistic license that I should have. 
SIMS: 
01:01:16 
Aside from playing John Lewis in chess, like I’ve noticed there 
were a lot of paintings and ... 
THRASHER: 
01:01:22 
Arts and crafts, hobbies. 
SIMS: 
01:01:27 
Yeah. Did you do anything along those lines? 
THRASHER: 
01:01:27 
Unfortunately, when I came back for my second go at it after I 
graduated college for full-time work, I didn't really have much 
time because they were always sending me missions. Even 
when I thought like, “No, hey, look, no, I'm no longer a cell 
leader. Hey I'm no longer a crooked cop, or, hey, I’m a good cop 
that was killed. I'm somebody else. I'm neutral. Just expect to 
just have a peaceful day in a village.” Shift leader or work group 
leader will be like, “Hey, operations is on the phone for you. 
They've got a mission for you.” It’s like, “Hey, yeah, we need 
you to come in. We got these AK-47s we need you to run. We 
got RPGs, need you to hide.” 
SIMS: 
01:02:07 
Oh you backed in. 
THRASHER: 
01:02:08 
Yeah, pretty much. The way it was and the way Al Pacino said it, 
“Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in.” To tell 
you the truth, I actually always looked forward to those calls 
because I knew it was always going to be something different 
every day, and that's what I loved about having the flexibility to 
be the bad guy is you’re pretty well free to do what you need to 
do. 
SIMS: 
01:02:28 
Is there anything we haven’t covered that you think would be 
important today to pass on that? 
THRASHER: 
01:02:39 
In the medical scenarios. No, see, the medical scenarios were a 
little bit more than a ... Going to a FOB and saying, “Oh, I got a 
tummy ache,” or, “Oh, I have a headache.” Sometimes that 
happens, but that was more of a surge. They were the nomads. 
My mother was actually a very, very talented moulage artist, 
creating realistic ... Have you seen those? 
SIMS: 
01:03:03 
Yeah, yeah. 
THRASHER: 
01:03:03 
As a matter of fact, one of the photos- 
SIMS: 
01:03:04 
That came out. 
THRASHER: 
01:03:05 
Yeah, well one of the photos they have is actually me with a arm 
severed. That one was actually probably one of my ... I should 
have got an Academy Award for that one because I was actually 
so deep into it and actually putting my mind through the whole 
concept of losing an arm that the medical staff actually said I 
was actually starting to lose color. Particularly with the 
hypothermia that’s associated with going into shock, which 
some of the medics actually took it like incredibly serious. I did 
address the whole point of like MIMNs events, correct? 
SIMS: 
01:03:43 
Yeah. 
THRASHER: 
01:03:44 
They're like side points. Others have more MIMNs  events, I 
have more long range missions. Of course, and they had DART 
missions out there as well. 
SIMS: 
01:03:56 
The DART? 
THRASHER: 
01:03:57 
DART, D-A-R-T, downed aircraft and recovery reconnaissance 
teams. They would have a scenario where there's a helicopter 
crash and then the Army would send in a quick reaction force to 
go get the pilot. A lot of times they’d have a military age male 
played, of course no pilot. 
SIMS: 
01:04:15 
That would be you. 
THRASHER: 
01:04:17 
I never actually had a chance to do DART missions. I always 
wanted to try one, but they're always like, “No, you're doing 
these soft MIMNs  events, you’re doing special operations and 
you're doing bad guy.” Mainly because no adaptability of 
thought. Doesn't take much effort to lay there, be a bloodied up 
pilot and wait for them to arrive. 
SIMS: 
01:04:37 
Overqualified. 
THRASHER: 
01:04:40 
I’m not going to say that much because there's some pretty 
gifted, pretty intelligent folks out there, particularly amongst 
the younger folks when they actually put their minds to it. They 
could have probably given me a run for my money, but myself I 
was just more or less ... I just lost myself to the fantasy to a 
degree, but still kept the focus on how can I give him them the 
best possible training to give them the highest probability of 
coming back home. That's it, that's all, and I did everything in 
my power to make sure I contributed as best as I could. 
SIMS: 
01:05:12 
Given that you’re the same age of many of the soldiers who 
went through, how did you relate to that? Did you kind of think 
that that could be me about to deploy? 
THRASHER: 
01:05:34 
It could be my brother. It could be anybody I knew in college. It 
could be friends from high school, distant family. Because my 
father was a soldier, you might say I took it personal, took it as a 
personal mission. Again, everything is personal when you're a 
person and you actually care. 
SIMS: 
01:05:59 
Yeah, sounds like you cared a lot about it. 
THRASHER: 
01:06:02 
Well, like I said, I have personal stock in this in like the more 
they hated me as a bad guy, the more they learned. Sometimes 
I guess the harder you play a bad guy as a, I guess, actor, role 
play or whatever, the harder you play the bad guy, the more in 
some weird, twisted sense the more of a good guy you are. 
Something to think about. If I didn't push these guys and make 
it as difficult as I could for them to catch me or squeeze me for 
intelligence, the outcomes otherwise may be completely 
different. 
THRASHER: 
01:06:44 
I don't really look at success as a, “Oh I tricked him,” or, “I 
fooled him,” or, “Oh I got away with it.” I look at success by 
casualty rates of the unit. I'd like to think I had a modest part 
played in that, even if it's not even modest, miniscule. The 
bottom line is it's still a difference. 
SIMS: 
01:07:09 
Thank you, Dara. I wish I had more time, but I have to run to the 
next one. It’s been really great talking with you. 
THRASHER: 
01:07:20 
It was actually great having you. It’s nice to tell the story. 
SIMS: 
01:07:23 
Yeah, and obviously I ... Uh. 
[INTERVIEW ENDS 01:07:30]
