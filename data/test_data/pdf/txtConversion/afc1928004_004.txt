TUNR.—" The girl I 
left behind me.* 
Down in de hills ob Indian, 
I 
loved a 
sylph so sable, 
Her skin war bright as black oak tan, 
An her breff like a 
sheep stable; 
Her legs war straight as grape yine limbs, 
Dat round a 
stone fence twine, sir, 
An folks cried when dey seed her shin, 
*, What a 
heel she's got behind her." 
Cuoses.—Sing, tramp it, locomotive shin, 
All creepin insects mind her, 
Or else you'll wid de earth cave in. 
By de heel she's got behind her. 
Oh, when dat heel first touched dis chest, 
How it set dig heart a 
beating, 
It made de wind walk through my breast, 
-Like a 
steam-bullgine a 
bleatin. 
At a 
Ball she wore a 
frock so tall, 
O'er heel, so none could find her, 
But dey cried out as she touched de hall, 
What a 
heel she's got behind her. 
Sing, tramp it, 84! 
And when she joined in de squadrille, 
Dat long heel fanned de hall, sir, 
An like de grindstone ob a 
mill, 
Upon all toes it fall, sir; 
Six darkies follered at her heel, 
Fast in dar arms to bind her, 
She raised dat shin, dey dropt an cried, 
"What a 
heel she has behind her." 
Sing, tramp it, &I, 
I 
took her to de masquerade, 
To hide herself complete, sat, 
She wore a 
domino dat played 
Twelve yards below her feet, sax; 
But when she tried de gallopade, 
She thought de bucks to blind, sar, 
But dey wiped dar noses an dey said, 
"'What a 
heel she's got behind her 
Sing tramp it, &a„ 
One day, while walkin down de street, 
She lit on five dogs` tails, ear, 
be canines tried for to retreat, 
But she held dem fast as nails, sar. 
Boy fit an scratched, an yelled " ki ih 1" 
Dar rudders to unbind, sar, 
An as (ley flew, dey seemed to cry,

'When she put down her shin, sar;

PURE LOVE CAN NEVER STRAY. 
To the beautiful melody of " True Love can ne'er forget"' 
A SENTIMENTAL ROMANCE. 
Pure love can never stray, 
From its first image gay, 
True, my heart's pulses play, 
To thee alone. 
Thus did true Cynthy sing, 
Down by the willow spring, 
While echo, murmuring, 
Rolled back his tone; 
Her lover wronged her heart, 
An from her vowed to part, 
An while her tears did start, 
Thus came her moan: 
Clioaus.—Pure love can never stray, 
From its first image gay, 
True, my heart's pulses play, 
To thee alone. 
Long years poor Cynthy sighed, 
Long strove her griefs to hide, 
Till her rich patron died, 
And wealth was her own; 
She sought lands far away, 
An lived in rich array, 
Courted by lovers gay, 
Yet still her heart's tone 
Cnoaus.—Sung, true lore can never stray', 
From its first image gay, 
True, my heart's pulses play, 
To thee alone. 
Hunger and dark -despair, 
Drove her lost lover there, 
He craved her alms to share, 
With mournful tongue; 
Oh, quick did his bosom swell, 
At tones he remembered well, 
Yet his joy was greater still, 
When softly she sung: 
Citonus.—Pure love can never stray, 
From its first image gay, 
True, my heart's pulses play, 
To thee alone

de French quarrelled how to feed de publican chickens, a

De Dutch king cock got shook

field, an eotch de tater rot in his face, an bein somewhat 
short ob sunshine, he throwed a 
sun-set, turned himself, 
behind his back, an dis brought his gold side to de airth, 
an de feet ob dat was, dat it gold-vanized de bowels ob de 
airth an distracted all de goold from de centre toward 
de surface daroff, 
an jis stumped his toe agin a 
lump ob 
de dust, an it turned yaller, an fell agin a

white man fell agin anudder, an everybody become goold 
struck, and 'come ' fected wid de goold yaller ganders, an 
eber since arter dat, de whole at-most-fear 'come preg-
nated wid gold. 
De sun am gold mounted, de gals wear 
gold in dar gums, de gemmen tie demselves fast to dar 
watches by gold ropes,. an de wedder rooster ob dar 
minds all point toward California, an de great metal 
physical question dat seems to us, is am wedder de gold
