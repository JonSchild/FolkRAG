We are two forsaken mokes, who are mixed up 
in our jokes, 
We came from San Francisco in a 
day; 
We traveled by balloon, and with Barnum's big baboon 
We had lots of fun while we was on our way. 
We are two acrobatic fleas, and can act on a 
trapeze, 
ti 
All night we sleep inside a 
horse's stall; 
On the Pullman palace car they wonder who we are, 
We are two red hot injun rubber cod fish balls. 
CHORUS. 
Then shout, shout, shout, shout, for the crazy eadopes, 
To a 
hot sausage we can give a 
warning, 
They say we got a 
gall, cause we live on cod-fish balls, 
And our board has got to be paid up in tlie morning. 
Our shoes is made of glass, and our nerve is 
made of brass, 
We have been around the world with General Grant, 
He tumbled in a 
sewer, whcii he found out we 
was poor, 
And fell through a 
C.ouble chested pair of pants. 
They use for a 
sign, when the Nveathir jj5 tim.‘,

'Tis strange to tell, but then I 
must, 
Behold, I'm deep in love; 
And the idol of my heart with eyes so bright, 
Like the little stars above. 
'Twits late last night at a 
grand masque ball, 
So beautiful to see; 
When her I 
met, I 
shall ne'er forget, 
Then Cupid threw his glance at me. 
CHORUS. 
Watch this motion 
go through—(Sym.) 
Here's another that I 
do;—(Sym.) 
For I'm always gay and free, 
And of all the girls I 
am so fond, 
It makes no difference to me 
Whether dark brunett's or blondes. 
(Donee.) 
I 
love to hear sweet music chime, 
I 
can listen all the while; 
It's delicious to hear how they harmonize, 
As each hour you beguile. 
It will set your brains a 
whirling, 
As you listen to the notes, 
'Twill steal your thoughts away; 
As you listen to the strain of a 
lovely tune. 
You will bless each coming day.

OH 
THOMAS COME UP ON THE 
ROOF. 
BY BEN COLLINS, FOR GALLAGHER & WEST. SUNG 
BY THEM WITH GREAT SUCCESS. 
I 
live in a 
basement upon a 
third floor, 
In a 
tenement house made of brick; 
'Wen I 
stagger home drunk and I 
go to my bunk, 
The thomas cats gather round quick. 
They howl and they fight, they scratch and 
they bite, 
Make love on the alley-way fence; 
When Maria comes up with a 
Scotch terrier pup, 
Then the trouble is sure to commence. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
Thomas come up on the roof, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
With an iron boot jack I 
near broke her back, 
And the fur flew a 
little bit higher. 
They meet every night at the rear of the house, 
To talk and to claw and make love, 
'There is Thomas's brother-in-law Henry by name, 
With a 
head like a 
big boxing glove, 
They're two old war horses and they are the bosses, 
They're covered with wounds and with scars, 
Their hide is as tough as a 
sailor's plum duff, 
Or the bumpers on a 
passenger car, 
CHORUS. 
! 
Thomas the stuffin I'll kick 
Oat of you and your partner Maria; 
'They yell on the shed till they waken the dead, 
And the key goes another note higher.

There's an old fashioned dog lives in our back yard, 
We let him out after dark; 
Get on to his nibbs with his old fashioned ribbs, 
He'd make you sick with his old fashioned bark. 
Re has an old fashioned nose, old fashioned it is, 
He descends from an old fashioned stock, 
And maybe some day in an old fashioned way, 
He will get slugged with an old fashioned rock. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! his name it was Mage, his name it was Maga, 
He's all the rage, he's all the rage, 
And his age it is just ninety-nine, 
And all of the girls they. are crazy for 
That old fashioned dog of mine. 
This old fashioned dog has an old fashioned pard, 
And they meet about three times a 
week; 
They have an, old fashioned fight but each 
other can't bite, 
For they are toothless old fashicned and weak. 
Now those old fashioned schooners give an 
old fashioned grub, 
Door-matts and old fashioned stake, 
And about once a 
week they make an 
old fashioned sneak. 
And they both take the old fashioned cake.

OUR PIGS, COWS, AND CHUN& 
137 MATT. A. GALLAGHER. 
AND SUNG WITH IMMENSE 
SUCCESS BY GALLAGHER & WEST. 
We used to keep a 
farm-yard in the year of thirty-nine, 
We had seven million pigs and six old hens --
Now pigs are nice to sleep with, you can keep 
warm all the time, 
We always roost our chickens in their pens. 
We owned one old sow that was mashed on a 
cow, 
And out of the pen the pigs would boost her, 
They seemed to pull together, yes in all kinds 
of weather, 
For they'd rather have her hitched up with a 
rooster. 
CHORUS. 
When we would put them in their stye, they 
all would seem to sigh,. 
You would wonder at the racket they would make; 
At all hours of the night, you could hear them 
snore so light, 
And for seven miles around the earth would shake. 
Now that same old sow that was mashed on the cow, 
You could see him at most any time of day, 
For now his heart was broken as he his love 
had spoken,. 
And that old cow had told him to chew hay. 
His step was very slow, as he started for to go, 
To try his luck and get a 
bride would match her, 
He is married now, and happy, he has kids to 
call him pappy,. 
For he's hitched up with a 
hen that is a 
hatcher.

AUNT JULIA AND JIM CROW, 
BY HARRY MENDEL, OF THE EMCEE MENDEL'S, 
FOR GALLAGHER & WEST. 
th 
Old aunt Julia and Jim Crow, 
They met in the garden and had quite a 
row, 
Old aunt Julia hit Jim with a 
club, 
Jim Crow yelled out I've got enough. 
Old Aunt Julia went into the kitchen, 
"To attend to the cooken and carve up de chicken; 
She looked in de soup and what do you say, 
She seen two bull frogs chasing round a 
fly. 
Old aunt Julia called for her man, 
She seen a 
pair of bed longs playing in the pan, 
She skimmed off the milk and she took it to 
the celler, 
A 
big rat seen her and she began to bellow. 
She grabbed a 
big club and at him made a 
longe, 
On the whiskey barrel she fell and knocked 
out a 
lung, 
That woke up the family, the chickens began to crow, 
In a 
very few moments there stood the boss cow. 
Aunt Julia got so mad she didn't know what to do, 
The old man tock her out to see the circus show, 
The first animal she seen it scared her most to death, 
It happened to be an elephant a 
standing on his head 
Next come de funny clown who commenced 
to dance around, 
Aunt Julia fell through the seats and fell 
upon the ground, 
The people all got rattled and then began to run, 
And the boss of the show he pulled out a 
gun.

TAIL FROM MY ANGEL BROTHER'S 
SHIFIT, 
BY CHARLEY FRYE, FOR GALLAGHER & WEST. SUNG 
BY THEM WITH GREAT SUCCESS AT THE PEOPLES 
THEATRE, ST. LOUIS, MO. 
I've a 
little piece of calico, I 
ever fondly praise, 
In the inside pockets of my yeller pants, 
And over it I 
oft have shed great big three ounce team 
Likewise my sisters, cousins, and niv aunts. 
But I 
don't want to knock you cold with the 
dizzy Pinafore, 
Were Ito do it why your feeling I 
would hurt, 
But this little piece of rag, I 
love and hold so 
dear through life, 
Is the tail from my angel brother's shirt. 
CHORUS. 
Wrapped up in my pocket in a 
yeller almanac, 
Though it's covered all o'er with grease and dirt, 
Were I 
hungry and wanted bread, I 
would not 
give up a 
thread, 
Of the tail from my angel brother's shirt. 
How oft-times he's been licked, and how often 
he's been kicked, 
On this little piece of rag I 
love so true; 
And how often for protection to my certain recollection 
It, has served him as a 
shield from mother's shoe. 
And the day I 
now recall while climbing o'er the wall, 
The wall was high and caused him to exert; 
When the threads they gave away and I 
took 
from him that day, 
This tail from my angel brother's shirt. 
Chorus.

DEDICATED TO HARRY MENDEL

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
This world we live in is a 
curious one, 
There's many a 
man goes to the wall; 
For the one who climbs up the ladder of life, 
There's many a 
thousand who fall. 
The man that works bard is worse oft in the end, 
While the drone makes a 
living with ease; 
'When a 
man has the maney, he is everyone's friend, 
Without it he no one tan please. 
Citont-s 
But the time will come yet, 
When the rich man will get 
A 
very slim kind of a 
show. 
With his prayers unspoken, 
His eloquence broken, 
Its up to a 
lamp-post he'll go. 
.They laugh at the poor man that toils all the ;In:, 
That drags the wea!th out of the earth, 
They'll sneer because he's not as well dressed as they, 
And make him a 
subject of mirth, 
With the power wealth gave them the poor they 
grind down, 
And make him through life but a 
slave; 
To supply them with all that life can enjoy, 
From infancy dowu to the grave. 
Chorus.

THIS WORLD OF OURS. 
CONTINUED, 
Nillih their preachers and church steeples 
raised to the sky, 
Their God they pretend to adore; 
They'll offer up prayers to that Being on high, 
While they drive the poor man from their door, 
They say that from Heaven He came down and died, 
That their souls to salvation might go; 
That He lived a 
poor life not to countenence pride, 
And for them sufferings did undergo. 
Chorus. 
But if man's God's image, and He too was poor, 
Why drive your poor men through the land 
Why hunt them from town, and from door to door, 
Why not extend a 
helping hand, 
Your Creator had no where to lay down his head, 
With a 
stone for His pillow He lay; 
For not having the money to pay for a 
bed, 
Your poor go to prison to-day. 
Chorus. 
You are building up prisons to hold all your poor, 
You are driving your brothers to crime;' 
Every dog has his day, and you're having yours, 
We will have a 
re-nuion in time. 
It will not be like the strike that at Pittsburgh 
did start, 
The next time we will see you right through, 
Might as well be in bondage for something worth while 
As to live just like slaves under ' you. 
Chorus.

MY DIPTHEalA JANE9

In Jersey's sunny land is a 
damsel I 
adore, 
F7ie's as sunk as the bird they call the bear, 
In the gas house where she works, chewing hash 
for Irish Turks, 
She's the first invented wearing light blonde hair, 
She's an allgator face, 
nTl shu%; zdw.; en '1113 brace, 
She's got freckles on her feet which make her Lime; 
Oh ! she causes great disasters, biteing holes in 
porous plasters, 
She's my hump-backed, pug-nosed, 
scarlet fever Jane.

You're my transmagnificandubandancialty Jane.

this bronketis looking damsel has an iron 
foundry gall, 
And her foot looks like the left lung of a 
whale; 
Oh I 
she lives on limburg cheese, and her breath 
would make you sneeze, 
And right down her back she wears a 
Chinese tail. 
Her teeth they shine like lead, she has dandruff 
in her head, 
Her ears would hold a 
barrel full of rain, 
And her mouth looks like a 
tunnel, and her 
nose looks like a

She's my hump backed pug-nosed

PAT MAY BF. FOOLISH. 
CORRECT EDITION. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear laud of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat he may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Pat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field, 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Chori& 
Remember the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as true 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Ts not fit for a 
country or queen. 
Chorus. 
MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
EVERY DAY. 
I've a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och I 
I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
Csouus. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you don't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
-There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och I 
murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
,Says I, •‘ my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A

PARODY 
MITES EZ Cw"P) B, 6CIC 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
I 
live around on Thompson street, 
Where Nigger babbies grow; 
If you happen to go round that way, 
Big rocks at you they'll throw. 
They sit around upon the steps, 
AL,' lay out on the rugs, 
And 
hen they've nothing else to do, 
They punch each others mug's. 
There', black ones, yellow ones, 
Some the coller of glue, 
And when they tackle liver, 
You ought to see them chew; 
Their e3 es stick out like onions, 
" As up the street they sail, 
They'll paralyse an organ grinder, 
And pull the monkey's tail. 
CHORUS. 
Little Nigger babies, 
Black face and shiney eyes, 
Just as good as white thrash, 
In the sweet bye and bye. 
Black because we's born that way, 
With kidneys in our feet, 
Is sung by the Nigger babies 
A 
living on our street. 
They'll make a 
black cat skip the gutter, 
As up the street they march; 
They'll sail into a 
Chinese laundry, 
And eat up all the starch. 
They'll wrestle with a 
big mince pie, 
Devour it at one bite; 
They'll make a 
chicken jump his roost, 
At twelve o'clock at night, 
There's fat ones lean ones, 
Walking for the cake; 
The fat ones take the pudding, 
And the lean ones eat the plate, 
They sit round upon the roof, 
And skate round in the gutter, 
And the biggest babie carries a 
razor, 
And calls himself a 
cutter.

THAT MAN FROM COHOES, 
WRrETEN AND STING BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
COPYRIGHT, 1881 BY WM. J. A. =DIM 
Oh! I'll sing of a 
gallent young man, 
He was born in the town of Cohoes; 
His head was fiat as a 
bedstead slat, 
He used to wear hen-skin shoes. 
His neck it was covered with scars, 
With freckles all over his tongue; 
his nose was hooked, his legs were crooked. 
He looked like a 
tramp or a 
bum. 
CHORUS. 
But he catched the croup while eating soap, 
And they thought he was a 
goner; 
lie got sore eyes from looking at pies, 
In a 
grocery round the corner. 
He had a 
face like a 
Texas steer 
Eyes like a 
soft shell crab, 
He had the glanders and yellow jandere, 
They thought he would go mad. 
His head it was big as a 
drum, 
He was tongue-tied in the feet; 
He fell through a 
hall and busted his gall, 
And landed way out in the street. 
He'd a 
big wort in his ear; 
And a 
cancer on his back; 
While shoveling fog he was bit by a 
dog, 
And they packed him home in a 
sack. 
Chorus. 
But his mouth got twisted from eating hot bison% 
And his lungs turned inside out; 
His eye-brows grew on the back of his neck, 
And his teeth they all fell out. 
When he'd walk the street his back would squeak, 
And he always had the blues; 
-
r--;re was long and thin like a 
piece of tin, 
This man that was born in Cohoes. 
Chorna.

MY DARLING ; BUT TALKATIVE WIFE. 
WORDS BY C. W. MARK. 
MUSIC BY J. SCHWENSECE. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY WM. J. A. LIEDERs 
ILL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
Some people they grumble the day in and out. 
Over very small trifles of life. 
But I 
think I've the right to tell you about 
My darling, but talkative wife 
A 
day cannot pass but I 
get a 
new name, 
You numbskull, you fool, dunce, and such, 
For me to talk thus you might say 'tis a 
shame, 
nut really, my wife talks too much. 
CHORUS. 
Now John, come and kiss me, oh! do have a 
care, 
One'd think you were kissing a 
mule; 
Why John, youv'e been drinking to-day, I 
declare! 
You're leading the life of a 
fool, 
Before we were married, you promised you know. 
We'd lead a 
most happy gay life; 
But since we are married I 
find ' tisn't so, 
I'm only your talkative wife. 
One evening while kissing she said have a 
care, 
One'd think you were kissing a 
mule, 
I 
said as a 
joke, I 
just kissed one, my dear, 
I 
know not that I 
was a 
fool. 
She scratched me, she pinched me, she wept and she said 
You're mean, you're a 
brute, so you are, 
And she cried as she tore some nice locks from my head, 
I'm going right back to my ma. 
Chorus. 
Now here at election I 
bet a 
new hat, 
Of course ' twas a 
very small cost, 
But she keeps saying why did you do that? 
Why bet on the men that have lost. 
There's Jenkins next door, whose as cute as a 
horse, 
Has several new suits while you've none; 
Now when did he get them, he won them of course, 
By betting on those that have won. 
Chorus. 
I 
thought I'd find peace in the club room at night, 
I 
went there one evening to test, 
Oh! then I 
found peace, yes, and then I 
got tight, 
And came home, I 
shant tell the rest. 
One thing I 
will say, though, to all you young men, 
When married, oh! guard against strife; 
If you don't you will wish you were single again, 
That's if you've a 
talkative wife. 
Chorus.

- A 
ROW OF TENEMENT HOUSES. 
SUNG BY NILES dc EVANS. 
AIR: BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS. 
In a 
row of ttmement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young andifair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull- dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of-tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
Oh! he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger be ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouses, 
For the dog to chew :;hat day.

I've seen the fastest horses, 
And the ones what made best time, 
But of all I

For he ain't fast 'ceptin' he am hit, 
He ain't pretty to be old; 
But he am faithful, good and kind, 
And that am more dan gold. 
He never runs away wid me, 
Nor cuts up any shines, 
For he am de best nag in dis town

They dance in Lancashire.

While strolling through the avenue, 
A 
cottage neat I 
saw; 
A 
maiden dressed in pink and blue, 
Was standing at the door. 
Her rosy cheeks they were so sweta, 
Her eyes shone bright and gay, 
And on her bosom rested neat, 
A 
rose perfumed bouquet. 
I 
raised my hat she bowed her head, 
Soon by her side I 
stood; 
And then sweet loving words were said. 
That made my heart feel good. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! she's the sweetest flower here, 
And she's the dearest of the dear; 
She's a 'illy pure and true, 
A 
fragrant mignonette, 
A 
morning-glory dipped in dew, 
A 
purple violet; 
A 
tulip white, and red rose fair, 
The gayest of the gay; 
She's all the flowers sweet and rare. 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
One day while standing by her side, 
I 
thought I 
would confess; 
I 
asked my love to be my bride, 
She softly whispered " yes," 
Her answer filled me with new life, 
It made me glad and gay, 
To know that she would be my vita. 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
Now in a 
cottage of our own, 
One painted white and gray, 
I 
dwell in peace and love alone, 
'With my rose perfumed bouquet.

There's a 
dear spot of land far out on the sea, 
And it's known as fair Erin's green isle ; 
sure it's there I 
was born on a 
bright summer's morn, 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother, 
Were pleased, to- be-sure, all the while, 
They shed tears of joy, for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle, 
You may talk about France, or England or Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and greut men ; 
But the whole world does know that fair Erin can shows 
Nobler sons, truer daughters, than them. 
Such names as O'Connell and Moore I 
will mention, 
And brave Duke of Wellington, while 
King Brian Boroghue, and our bold Emmett toe, 
Saw tha light on fair Erin's Green Isle. 
There's the Killarney lakes on Erin's Green Isle, 
They're so lovely enchanting and fine 
Sure the valley's and mountain's are secocd to nos*. 
For their beauty is really sublime. 
There grows in profusion the dear little shamrock, 
Encouragea by :::ature's sweet smile, 
Dear land of-my birth,_ garden si)t of the earth, 
You're my idol fair Erin's Green Isla.

Just look at my eye, you will see that I'm fly, 
I'm a 
man of influence and great education; 
I've studied in college, I've a 
great deal of knowledge, 
Of things as of they go every day. 
I 
never play cards, I 
smke no cigars, 
Unless they are " Henry Clay;" 
I 
never use slang like the rest of the gang, 
For it would not suit Alderman Fay. 
CHORUS. 
Alderman Fay, tral-a-lal-la, 
I 
have the ward on my back on election day., 
Alderman Fay, tral-lal-la, 
I'm one of the genuine stock, ha, ha! 
If you get into a 
fight, just keep the thing quiet, 
I 
will go see the judge and make it all right; 
For I 
have the pull, I 
am like a 
sea-gull, 
I 
am flapping my wings everywhere, 
In Albany, on the committee, 
Of course I 
take command; 
They come to me, and speak to me, 
And give me a 
shake of the hand. 
Choruk 
Sure President Grant is married to my aunt, 
I'm a 
distant relation to Henry Ward Beecheal 
I 
wear a 
pin on my breast, it is Tiffany's best, 
It was presented to me t'other day. 
By a 
committee from Tammany 
To which I 
do belong; 
The girls all say, I 
carry the sway, 
And they are mashed on Alderman Fay.

Lonely nnd weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
Wandering far away, while fears awaken. 
Dread of the fast coming sonbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleasures of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood, 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy.

Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy,

Oh ! how she peers in the face of each stranger, 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Longing and praying to shield him front danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe him in pain. 
Lone is the heart of that poor mother waiting, 
Wrinkled and gray. tor one moment of joy; 
While with his evil companions he's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy. 
Go foe-

Once he was pure as the babe in the manger, 
But friends were false, and they led him astray, 
Par from his home he has wandered a

Reckless through drink, as you see him to-day! 
But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he bas dreatne,1

With no sweet thoughts when his brain has been maddeoed

Go for my boy, ate,

Tell him 
that mother will never forget I 
Though he is fallen— oh ! bring him in pity.

The orange groves and sweet magnolia rees, 
And de mocking-bird so gay, he would sing

And their notes were wafted in the gentle breeze.

Wid happy hearts so light and free from pain,

With this mysterious shout.

Looney now they fly about, lazy feet had better Oat 
When in the chorus wild they shout, Rise it Reilly!

Oh my name is Paddy Carmer, 
From the county of Tralee; 
There's a 
little girl that wears spit curb, 
She's crazy gone on me. 
She sells butter-milk on Sundays. 
On the beach at Coney Isle; 
There's not a 
girl in all creation, 
Can compete with her for style. 
CuoRus. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
dumpling, 
She's the divil on the mash; 
She's Mary Kelly's cousin, 
And her brother juggles hash. 
Her father grinds an organ, 
The old woman drives a 
dray, 
Berdelia's on the making 
Mashes all the day. 
Oh! her hair is red, nangs down her head, 
Like the tail of an old dead mule; 
She speaks seventeen different languages, 
Though she never went to school. 
She sleeps out all night gets boiling tight, 
Ned Leary is her pard, 
And she sleeps upon a 
clothes line, 
That hangs out in our back yard

I'm a 
true-hearted boy from the green shores of Erin, 
That" Emerald " set in the sea, 
Where bounteous nature her best doth appear in; 
And choicest of gifts scatters free. 
Our mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Our rivers and lakes filled with life galorq,, 
Loveliest scenes on all sides there surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
Cuouus. 
Hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar, 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
Dear Grannuail thy daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn, 
Ever in battle thy sons they are fearless,' 
Death do they hold but in scoan. 
Our hearts ever open to welconie a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turned from the door, 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland asthore. 
Chorus. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud boys to wear it 
To it I'll ever be true, 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply indeed as I 
do. 
Distance or climate that bond cannot seven, 
Firm in our hearts all the wide world &ea 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it no never; 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore.

sing of a 
man he could stand on his head, 
He used to sell sausage with mustard and bread; 
He used to sell sausages two for a 
dime, 
In swaet Cincinnatti way over the Rhine. 
This man had a 
can that was made out of tin, 
That he used 'to put sausage and horse-radish in; 
With a 
lamp in the bottom the sausage to cook. 
For a 
nickle he'd bring you up one with a 
hook. 
When night would come on he would shoulder hiscoili, 
And he'd sail all around the great city of hams; 
He'd swell himself up like a 
big lump of yeast, 
And he'd yell hot winerwost five cents apiece. 
Of a 
sausage machine this man he was boss, 
If a 
dog went that way he always got lost; 
And the cats on the fence, oh. how they would hustle. 
When they saw old Winerworst out on his mugtle. 
One night he got full, and went to a 
show, 
And like a 
steam enginethis man he did blow, 
He got hit in the head with a 
schooner of beer, 
And died with a 
winerwost stuck in his ear.

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the bright stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
Hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
'Blithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer O
ttly is gently dawning, 
Lifting night 8 
be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure, 
May her sweetness never fade, 
slay grim sorrow ne'er seenre, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
hear the lark her praises singing. 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing, 
Little roguish eyes.

in the early hours of morning, 
O'er the waves we swiftly go, 
needless of time sailor's warning. 
Where the foam-capped billows flow; 
For this hour we long have waited, 
And the charms within our reach 
Make our hearts with joy elated, 
Off for Coney Island Beacli 
CHORD'S. 
Some may sail across the ocean, 
Which is far beyond our reaan, 
While we find enough commotion, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
Many pleasures now surround us, 
On this breezy summer day, 
And with charming friends around us, 
O'er the waves we speed away, 
Till we reach that isle of gladness, 
WhThli is just within our reach, 
Where we banish all our sadness, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
In the chilling surf we shiver, 
But o,r hearts are light and free, 
While the wavelets dance and quiver, 
Rolling in from depths of sea. 
And the breeze is softly blowing. 
All our lonely ones should teach, 
That the wise much bliss are knowing,

Of the sails white fluttering fold!
