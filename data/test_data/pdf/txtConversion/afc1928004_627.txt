HAPPY DAYS. 
NEGRO CHARACTER DUET. 
Written and composed by W ALLY W EST, and sung only by FRANK. 
HALEY and W ALLY W EST. 
DowN in sunny Carolina, when we were young and gay, 
We were happy as the birds which round us sang; 
And when our work was over, at the closing of the day, 
With merriment and fun our cabins rang. 
We were happy in those days, for we had no thought of 
care, 
Our master was indulgent, good and kind, 
We never thought of sorrow, for our hearts were light as 
air; 
Ah, those happy days are always in my mind. 
CHORUS. 
We cannot forget those happy days, 
Tho' they'll never come again. 
(S7ze.) Old Jasper thinks of them whene'er he prays, 
(He.) 
Yes, for you and I've had troubles which we 
never thought of then, 
(Both.) Down in Carolina in them happy days. 
We were happy in dem pleasant times before the war 
came on 
And drove us from old master and our home, 
(We were working in the cotton fields), but now that 
place is gone, 
'And through the cold world we are forced to roam. 
But we've not got long to tarry here, 
And every night we raise 
Our voice in prayer to him the God of praise, 
And ask him When we die to let us see a 
place 
Like that one we knew in those happy days. 
We cannot forget, etc.

I 
CAN'T MAKE IT OUT, 
CAN YOU ? 
Words and music by G. W. Hum,. 
The music of this song can be obtained of ROE STEPHENS, Detroit, 
Mich. 
Price 30 cents. 
My name is Joe Slyceve, I'm not quite a 
fool, 
Nor yet am I 
cramful of knowledge, 
I 
was not brought up at a 
grand boarding school, 
And I've never been inside a 
college ; 
I'm a 
kind of philosopher tho' in my way, 
As the journey of life I 
go through, 
And the strange things we hear of and see ev'ry day. 
I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
CHORUS. 
No, I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
The queer things I 
see quite mystifies me, 
And I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
Now I 
know n 
party, some call him a 
swell, 
For his style is so heavy and grand, 
You'd think him the Marquis of Hanover Square, 
Or some other " big pot" of the land ; 
He follows the fashion, drinks " champy " and drives 
His girl down to Richmond or Kew, 
Yet he's only a 
clerk upon sixty a 
year, 
Now I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
No I 
can't make it out, etc. 
Moderation in drink is a 
thing I 
admire, 
But total abstinence—all bosh ! 
I 
can do a 
few glasses whene'er I 
require, 
But the " Good Templar" system won't wash I 
(

5 
I 
CAN'T MAKE IT OUT, CAN YOU ?—Concluded 
Now I 
know of one who won't touch beer or grog 
And tells me my small drinking I'll rue, 
While her nose is as red as the sun in a 
fog, 
I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
No I 
can't make it out, eta. 
And the dear darling girls who go sailing along, 
(Some " impertinent " folks call them Guys) 
What with pads on their heads and humps on their backs 
They appear quite a 
glorious size; 
But when they dismantle, oh dear what a 
sell I 
As soon as the truth comes to view, 
You find there's more shadow than substance, my friends, 
And I 
don't care for that much, do you ? 
No I 
can't make it out, etc. 
There's" a 
neighbor of mine sells new milk from the cow, 
And new milk from the cow's very nice ; 
His trade is but small, whilst his family's large, 
And his milk is sold at a 
low pride. 
I've ne'er seen nor heard one of his cows, I 
declare, 
Tho' he represents he's got a 
few, 
And somehow his pump's always out of repair, 
Now I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
' No I 
can't make it out, etc. 
Now I 
trust you're not tired and wish me away, 
For I 
am not myself in the least, 
But I 
think for the present I've gossiped enough, 
And enough is as good as a 
feast. 
Without any scandal I 
give you my thoughts 
"Upon things as they seem to my view, - 
And if in my song there is anything wrong, 
I 
can't make it out, can you ? 
No I 
can't make it out, eta.

HAPPY DREAMS. 
7 
Words written and music adapted by WALLY W EST. 
W HEN the shades of night, 
With fairy footsteps light. 
Upon us steals so softly, and the whole world seems 
To us so fair and bright, 
Then in the stilly night 
My soul and heart are lightsome in their happy dreams. 
Oh, how joyous are those happy dreams, 
When the whole world's sleeping 'neath the pale moon-
beams. 
'Neath her golden sheen I'm lying, 
While the breezes o'er me sighing 
Seem to tell me of some old love that my life has seen ; 
And as I 
ponder still my thoughts do wander 
To a 
cottage fair beside a 
running stream, 
When in days gone by I 
met a 
charming little maiden, 
She whose vision ever haunts me in my happy dreams. 
From my childhood's home, 
Where'er I 
chance to roam, 
Some memory will come up and bring again those happy 
times, 
When we wandered on together, 
She and I, o'er flow'r;,- heather, 
As we, churchward-boand, would stop and listen to tho 
merry chimes ; 
Then as one day standing 'neath the vault of blue, 
We told each other of a 
love so true--
A 
love so pure and holy that the angels watched above us 
and recorded it upon the mighty Book of Truth. 
A 
love as pure and mighty 
As her vows were poor and flighty— 
As my faith was in those untaught, halcyon days of 
youth. 
GIT AWAY FROM DAT WINDOW, OR SASSY 
NIGGER. 
Sang with tremendous success by LAIVELL and D2Ews. 
Hon along, sister Mary, hop along, 
flop along, hop along. 
flop along, sister Susie, hop along, 
And we'll get dar just in time. 
See de sun set in de evening 
Up in de field ob corn; 
Oh, niggers, do take warning 
When Gabriel blows his horn. 
CHORTJS. 
Git away from dat window, my love and my bride, 
Git away from dat window now I 
say, 
Call around some oder night, 
For dere's gwine to be a 
fight, 
Dar'll be razors a

Eighteen hundred and seventy-six, 
Glory hallelujah! 
The year I 
got my jawbone fixed, 
Glory hallelujah! 
I 
hung my jawbone on de fence, 
Glory hallelujah ! 
I 
haven't seen my jawbone since, 
Glory hallelujah !

WE MUST PART AT LAST. 
Words and Music by J. P. CARROLL. 
AT 
last we must part, for your word you have broken; 
What sorrow those -words bring to me; 
I 
remember when last the sentence was spoken 
By you, that you'd be true to me. 
I've found out since that I've been too confiding— 
Love always is blind I've heard say. 
I 
doubted you, dear, when the truth you were hiding— 
We can't learn it all in a 
day. 
CHORUS. 
The bans they are severed—at last we must part; 
Friends (?) have shattered our haven of joy. 
You're false; I 
forgive, though you've nigh broke my 
heart— 
It's hard for true love to destroy. 
At last we must part; oh, those wards they are galling, 
Hot tears they do bring to my eyes. 
I 
can't cease to love you, for my heart seems calling, 
As if 'twas a 
voice from the skies, 
Nor answered or came not your fickleness proving, 
But disguised and ashamed did you seem. 
I 
can't realize why a 
heart true and loving 
Should awake and find it but a 
dream. 
The bans they are severed, etc. 
DIABOLICAL STORY. 
Originally sung by BLLLY CARTILII. 
Ir you'll listen with your ears, 
For a 
couple of million years, 
A 
diabolical story I 
will tell; 
It's about a 
female girl 
With red teeth and curly hair, 
And I 
loved her till my head began to swelL 
Her name was Susan Glue, 
And the grub she used to chew, 
She was a 
night clerk in a 
foundry over town; 
She'd an alabaster claw, 
And a 
doable breasted jaw, 
And every bunion on her feet weighed a 
pound. 
One day she gave me the shake, 
And I 
thought my heart would break, 
When I 
heard she was playing Hamlet on the stage ; 
She stole eleven or twenty dollars, 
And a 
lot of paper collars, 
And eloped with a 
bummer twice her age 
As a 
singer she is vile, 
And she hasn't got no style, 
And they'll kill her if she ever tries to dance. 
Oh, she stole my summer clothes, 
And I 
was nearly froze, 
And her bummer wears ray bran new Sunday pants. 
If I 
ever meet her feller, 
I 
will bust him in the smeller, 
I 
am certain he will find an early grave; 
I 
will split his ugly tongue, 
Arid I'll kick him in the lung, 
With an Indian club his whiskers I 
will shave. 
I 
will sling a 
bottle of ink, 
And destroy Miss Susan Glue, 
And gently drop her in the nearest sewer. 
I 
will drink a 
kidney stew, 
And I'll skip to Kalamazoo, 
For Jimmy Fresh he never went back on the poor.

"SWEETHEART," 
Words and Music by W ALLY WEsr. 
Sung by him in his Novelty 
Sketch, " Sweethearts' Serenade." 
IrSly heart with joy is la-den, 
'Tis brimming o'er with love 
For a 
charming little maiden, 
Fair as the stars above ; 
I 
know she loves me, 
And will be unto me ever true, 
She is of all most dear to me, 
This maid with eyes of blue. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, I 
love this little girl, 
She is among all other maids a 
pearl ; 
My heart she's pierced right through and thro' 
With Cupid's little dart. 
I 
love her, yes, indeed I 
do, 
She's my darling, my sweetheart. 
I 
stood upon a 
wooded ridge 
To rest beneath the shade, 
When, crossing o'er a 
rustic bridge, 
Came a 
pretty, winsome maid; 
I 
doffed my hat, she smiled on me, 
You know it now in part, 
But I've not told you she became 
My darling, my sweetheart. 
Oh, yes, I 
love this little girl, etc,

THE OLD FAMILY TABLE. 
Written and sang by Plums 1)1:ro:srr. 
t
.. Music published by CHAnizs F. 
ESCHER, Jn., 1247 Girard Av., Phil& 
THE old family table no longer in use, 
Standing silent and grim in the gloom; 
It recalls many scenes of bright happy days, 
When it stood in the old-fashioned room. 
In fancy I 
see all the loved ones again, 
Even grandma's old chair at the head ; 
While the family's assembled again as of yore, 
Seated round while a 
blessing is said. 
CHORUS. 
We joined in the pray'r that my grandmother said, 
Asking a 
blessing to descend on the bread; 
In fancy I 
see that the loved ones are nigh, 
rear the old family table and L 
The old family table was just large enough 
For the family that sat by its side ; 
I 
remember the day it was decked all in white 
To welcome my young blushing bride. 
But oh! weary years have brought changes so sad. 
I 
gaze on your form with a 
sigh ; 
'Tis a 
link of the past, for we're left all alone, 
The old family table and I. 
We joined in the pray'r) oto. 
THE DINNER BELL.—Concluded. 
THE DINNER BELL. 
Parody on " The Water Mill." 
y 
Mrs Corzrars expressly for HALEY and WEM 
TAT= to the Dinner Bell; 
At 12 o'clock etch day 
How the boarders shout " Hurrah," 
To the dining room hurry away. 
The proprie ter looks so pale and sick 
As they all sit down to eat, 
And though looking yet he cannot tell 
Which one his board will beat. 
Here, pass that " Union butter," 
One of them boarders said. 
If the mill can never grind 
We don't get any bread. 
What a 
hardened hungry lot. 
These boarders seem to be, 
How they grasp and gormandize 
Most everything they See ; 
They were never known to stop, 
Unless they had their fill, 
Often coming back again 
To that corn-beef mill ; 
Truly speaks the landlord, 
" 
My clothes are fading fast; 
I 
cannot wash my Ulster 
In the watr that has past„" 
I
t 
" 
Take this lesson to yourselves, 
But don't take anything more; 
Pay your board, leave my house, 
Or I'll fire you out the door. 
You want your trunk, I 
want my money, 
I've trusted you enough; 
I 
know you well, you can't fool me, 
And say my turkey's tough ; 
Go to the Black Hills and dig for Indians 
You may come back in silly; 
But the mill can never grind 
With the water that's in milk." 
Oh what waste in a 
boarding house, 
What bills you have to pay ; 
A 
dead-beat will come back again, 
'Cause he " couldn't stay away." 
Some will ask for a 
fire escape, 
And more an elevator, 
And want their dollar diamond rings 
Put in the refrigerator. 
Take this lesson to your hearts 
Before you bring in your trunk 
The coffee mill can never grind 
When the cook is on a 
drunk.

The girl I 
love I'll marry soon. 
There is Owen Smith and Brady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all the while ; 
Sure Smith so queer does talk, 
And has such a 
funny walk. 
Wid pleasure every one begin to smile. 
When Miss Clancy does appear, 
Such curious things you hear : 
" 
Miss Clancy dear, you're loi 'king all serene! " 
She smiles and bows. her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all these pretty songs she sings to me: 
She sings, etc.

THE IRISH PRESIDENT. 
Written by W ALLY W EST. 
AH, good people, one and all, 
I've come here to make a 
call, 
An' to sing an' dance in Tipperary style ; 
If yell keep yer eyes on me, 
Sure ye all may plainly see 
I'm a 
true descendant of ould Erin's isle. 
Many a 
happy day I've seen 
In that little isle so green, 
Till famine came and drove me from my home, 
To free America's shore, 
"Where I'll stay forevermore, 
From this land of liberty I'll never roam. 
CHORUS. 
An' I'm c.v,oin' to run for President 
On next election day, 
An' I 
hope ye'll all support me heart an' hand, 
An' if I 
win the race, 
Sure I'll give ye's all a 
place, 
Thin yell say that I'm a 
credit to the land. 
Sure, when I 
take my seat, 
With open hands I'll greet 
Every laborin' man that comes frojn Ireland ; 
I'll give him'some small place, 
If he fills that with good grace, 
I'll promote him then to be my right band man; 
I'll cut down all taxation, 
Prove a 
blessin' to the nation, 
So that all posterity shall bless my name ; 
No presents will I 
take, 
A 
trip 'round the world I'll make, 
An' return home crowned with glory and with fame. 
I'm goin' to run, etc.

THE WELCOME LETTER. 
Words by J. 
P. 
CARROLL. Music by JAS. E. 
MURRAY. 
I 
HAVE just received a 
letter from one I 
clearly love; 
It my heart with enraptured joy does fill ; 
'Tis a 
comfort when in sorrow, for reading it does prove 
That some one in this world thinks of me still. 
I 
am happy when I 
find little missives of its kind 
From my loved one far away across the sea; 
Though in distant lands doth roam, he still thinks of his 
home, 
And the one that he has left behind—poor me. 
'Tis a 
letter, a 
mere letter, though no gift could please 
me more— 
A 
token of love and respect from o'er the sea; 
For its tender lines admit that I 
may be happy yet, 
When my darling returns again to me. 
Oh, what pleasure it does give--'tis for that alone I 
live— 
To think my darling soon is to return ; 
What joy it does impart, thanks to Cupid's burning dart., 
Which causes hearts with lasting love to burn. 
How happy then I'll be, when my dear one's face I 
see 
Re-entering our humble cottage door; 
'Tis then the welcome kiss I'm sure won't be amiss, 
Which will cause two happy lives forevermore. 
'Tis a 
letter, a 
mere letter, etc.

DON'T SLAM THE GARDEN GATE. 
As sung by HARRY PiEnsoN, Burlesque Prima Donna. 
Now, Charlie, prornise not to laugh, 
The boon of you I 
pray ; 
Or treat it all as silly chair 
What I 
am about to say. 
Well, you must know that ev'ry night 
You leave so very late, 
And something do that is not right— 
You slam the garden gate. 
Please shut it gently to 
When we have said adieu; 
I 
fain would beg of you, 
This little favor do. 
For some one's sure to catch 
The clicking of the latch, 
To know who goes so late, 
Who slams the garden gate. 
The clock struck twelve of course, you know, 
When last we said good-
night; 
For while we two were talking so, 
Time flew with rapid flight. 
It was but only yesterday 
My teasing sister Kate 
Said, I 
heard some one go away 
Who slani'd the garden gate. 
CHORUS. 
Then, Charlie, please, to- night, 
Indeed, I 
think you might, 
Just pull it gently to 
When we have said adieu. 
For some one's sure to catch 
The clicking of the latch, 
To know who goes so late, 
Who slam'd the garden gate.

THE COLLEEN BAWI•T. 
Sung by “ Les Grotesques Eceentrique." 
Is the Emerald Isle across the sea, 
I 
left a 
colleen fair ; 
She's beautiful and bright to see, 
With wavy golden hair. 
Fier bright blue eyes of heaven's own hue, 
Like the sun at early dawn ; 
Sure the only girl I 
ever loved 
Was my own sweet Colleen Bawn. 
CHORUS. 
Sure I 
love her as I 
love my own life, 
An' I'll soon go back an' take her for my wife. 
Oh ! her eyes are as bright as the dew 
On the trees at early dawn ; 
Let come what will, I'll love her still, 
My own Sweet Colleen BaNVII. 
Sure many lands I've travelled o'er, 
And many beauties seen ; 
But none of them could half compare 
With my charming Irish queen. 
There's a 
spot in Erin dear to me, 
It's cherished in my heart, 
That's where she promised she'd be mine, 
And that we should never part, 
Sure I 
love her, eta.

By PERRINO: 
I

maiden fair to see,— 
Beware! beware! beware ! beware! 
She can both false and friendly be,— 
Take care! take care! take care! take care! 
She is fooling thee, she is fooling thee, 
Trust her not, trust her not! 
She is fooling lei-

NAUGHTY CLARA.—Continued. 
CLARA.—What a 
surprising degree of impudence some men 
show. 
Charles has had the audacity to send me a 
note, asking 
for an interview. 
I 
hav'nt known him more than a 
month. 
But then I've had five admirers since then, and each one of them 
Is ready to go down on his knees to me. I 
rather think I 
like 
Charley, though. 
Yes; I 
prefer him to any of the others. 
He's 
so frightfully jealous, I 
don't know what is to be done with 
him,— unless I 
marry him. 
Here he comes. 
I'll hide behind 
this tree. 
(Goes behind tree.) 
Enter CHARLES. [ R.] 
CHARLES.—I'll give it up. 
She won't be here, now. 
I'ts past 
the hour. 
Oh, what a 
fool I 
was to get caught in the meshes 
of this pretty, bewitching coquette ! 
( 
Sings 21 verse and refrain of song.) 
Her hair is as bright as the sweet sunlight, 
Her cheek as fair as the dawning, 
But to speak of love to my own little dove, 
Is sure to set her yawning. 
I 
swear by her eyes. I 
swear by the skies, 
I 
swear by the stars above me, 
But she does'nt Care, for the more I 
swear, 
The more she does'nt love me.

Tell me Clara, do you love me or 
not ?

AN ORPHAN'S PRAYER. 
Words and music by J. P. CennoLL. 
A 
CHILD I passed, one night so lonely, 
In a 
dark and dreary street, 
Who was nestled to another, 
Thinly clad to shield the sleet; 
Softly then I 
heard a 
whisper, 
Asking me if I 
could spare 
Enough to keep them both from starving— 
I 
listened to an " Orphan's Prayer." 
CHORUS. 
"Please, sir," said this little stranger, 
His face betokening grief and care, 
" 
Save us, for we are in danger, 
Listen to an orphan's prayer." 
Softly then did I 
approach, 
And found from hunger one had died, 
And the other, for alms-asking 
Loth to leave, sat by his side, 
Still not knowing God had taken 
His fond brother to His care, 
And ere morning God had listened 
To the other orphan's prayer. 
"Please, sir," said this little stranger, eta.

LOVE'S ERROR. 
-By W ALLY W EST. 
Dedicated—where most appreciated. 
LOVE knows no station, rank or place ; 
Where'er lie sends a 
dart, 
Whether at plain or beauteous face, 
At warm or chilly heart, 
'Tis sure (" they say ") to make the mark 
At which young Cupid aimed, 
And life seems either bright or dark, 
As we are made or maimed. 
One day love cast an eye on me, 
Then straightway set a 
dart, 
And swore a 
lover's oath that he 
Would pierce my wayward heart. 
He aimed, he fired : as he did 
I 
turned unto another 
Face, prettier far, and deeply bid 
In curls which seemed to smother 
The beauty flashing from her eyes, 
Which laughing gazed in mine ; 
Outwitted Cupid lost his prize, 
But gained a 
heart in thine.

Before my gaze advancing came my darling little Belle.

Serb- Comb c 
Waltz Song.

OF 
all the pleasures that I 
prize, 
There's none to me more sweet 
Than whirling in the mazy waltz, 
'Midst tinkling fairy feet ; 
With Eddie's arms about my waist, 
All earth seems bright and fair, 
While heaven's own music, charming waltz, 
Floats on the perfumed air. 
CHORUS. 
The elegant waltz, the charming waltz, 
Nothing I 
know can give me such pleasure 
As that charming waltz, the elegant waltz, 
My heart-beats keep time with the elegant waltz. 
Can aught on earth afford such joy 
Or pleasure pure as this ? 
My head reclines on Eddie's breast, 
I 
revel in the bliss 
Of perfect trust in Eddie's love, 
For sure none can be false 
Who find the pleasures hidden in 
The dreamy, charming waltz. 
The elegant waltz, etc.

GLISTENING MOONBEAMS. 
Words and Music by Wri.ii,Ly W EST. 
W HEN the silvery moonbeams glisten 
Upon the lake's calm breast, 
Will my darling nightly listen, 
As, waking from her rest, 
She hears her lover's serenade 
Ring o'er the waters blue ? 
Its melody entrancing 
Tells her he still is true. 
(Symp.) He's true (symp.) to you ; 
Oh, then my darling waken, 
Sweet girl whom I 
adore, 
And whisper that you will be true 
Unto me evermore. 
CHORUS. 
Waken thou, oh, fairest maid, (
synzp.) 
List unto my serenade. (
symp.) 
Oh, waken from thy dreaming, 
Thy lover sings to thee, 
Now while the moonlight's gleaming, 
Come thou, my love, to me. 
The night stars faintly glimmer, 
The birds have sunk to rest, 
The moonbeam's golden shimmer 
Upon the water's breast 
Fades into night beside the love 
Which lights my breast for thee ;

THERE's a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points to baby mine ; 
Nancy Lee has broke the crystal 
To the watch upon the Rhine ; 
Kitty Clyde has pinched her feet, 
To keep herself up in the style ; 
And Ben Bolt has stole the waterfall 
Of gentle Annie Lisle. 
I 
am sitting on the stile to-day, 
A 
hundred in the shade, 
With old Muldoon the solid man, 
Of Patrick's day parade. 
He tried one day tu stop a 
ball, 
With Spaulding at the bat, 
But a 
fielder caught him on the nose, 
And busted Muldooli's hat. 
Put my little shoes away, 
When the swallows homeward fly ; 
The man up in the moon -4.11 laugh, 
To see the well run dry. 
Oh Mollie dear, will you be true, 
When I 
am far at sea ? - 
And don't be flirting in the park 
With the fellow that looks like me. 
Charley Ross has been discovered, 
Where the leaves begin to fall ; 
Dennis Kearney lost his hatchet, 
But he done it for a 
stall. 
He left his dray in Frisco, 
For to elevate his means, 
And Yankee Doodle filled him up, 
With Boston pork and beans. 
Grandpa's clock has just been buried, 
ion will miss it now it's gone, 
For they'll never resurrect it, 
Till old Gabriel blolys his horn. 
The devil's dream of little Maud, 
The organ-grinders test, 
The silver threads among the gold, 
Will havu to take a 
rest.

SINCE TERRY 'S 
LEARNED TO DANCE. 
Written by W ALLY W EST. 
On, ye've all heard tell of my Terrence, 
For of him I've often sung, 
And he's always in some sort o' trouble, 
Though I 'spose that's the way with the young. 
Sure, almost every evening. 
Round the kitchen floor he'll prance, 
He wakes all the neighbors wid his noise, 
An' says he's learniu' how to dance. 
CHORUS. 
I 
know I'm going crazy; 
For I 
don't stand no sort o' chance, 
Oh, I'm going to the divil intirely, 
Since Terry learned how to dance. 
He puts on a 
pair of wooden shoes, 
That makes his foot look like a 
log ; 
He stands there shakin' them half an hour, 
An' calls it a 
Lancashire clog. 
An' then he's got another pair o' shoes, 
I 
guess they're full two feet long. 
Sure, he throws them up, and slaps them down, 
Au' calls it a 
dance an' song. 
I 
know I'm goin' crazy, etc. 
Sure the other day he took two tubs, 
An' fixed up the divil's own rig ; 
An' he stood on the top o' the twO an' danced, 
An' called it a " pedestal jig." 
At the very first step, sure, the pile fell down, 
An' giv' him the heartburn in the bosom of his pants. 
Sure, his clothes is wrecked completely, 
Since he's learnin' how to dance. 
CHORUS. 
Sure, Mary Ann's gone crazy, 
'Cause she don't stand no sort o' chance, 
Her tra-la-la-loo's gone out o' date 
Since Terry's learned to dance.

Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it c 
itches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding house hash, 
And many a 
man it lies sold! 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell; 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket book as well. 
Cnout:s. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll thid when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead 
With bald headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
to talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
lb spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
lie finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is he going for to do.

Boys keep away, ate, 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash, 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half starved kids, 
I 
tell you it's no fun, 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, ete, 
Younz fellows just take my advice, 
Don't be in it hurry for to wed. 
You think you're in clover till the honey- moon's over, 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
iVife with a 
plaster on her nose, 
You'll find true love don't run so very smooth. 
When you have to wear your second hand cloths. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to thaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gun, 
While you vaccinate mother-in-law.

SWEET MAGNOLIAS. 
Written by W ALLY W EST, and sung only by “ Les Grotesques Ee-
centrique," HALEY and W EST. 
IN 
a 
cosy little cabin down in Georgia, 
Where the cotton flowers blossom fair and white, 
There dwells a 
lovely little girl 
Who is my heart's delight, 
And at night when little stars were peeping, 
And the moon in all her glory shone aboTe, 
I've often talked in happier days 
With this one sweet girl I 
love. 
CHORUS. 
-Where the sweet magnolias bloom, (
Sym.) 
How I 
love their sweet perfume, (
Syni.) 
While walking through the scented groves of orange, 
'Neath the calm and silvery light of the moon, 
I 
told my darling of my love, 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
Now I've wandered far away from sunny Georgia, 
That dear old land I 
love to call my home, 
Yet oft my dreams will take me back, 
As through the world I 
roam. 
There I 
see the pure white blossoms of the cotton, 
As they glisten 'neath the calmly shining moon ; 
There's where I'd like to live and die, 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom, etc.

Words and Music by JOSEPH P.

Copyrighted, 1879, and published by E. H. HARDIN:G. 
The Music of this song will be sent by us to any address, post paid, on 
receipt of price, 10 cents. 
THERE'S sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside ; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves 
All pleasures we have tried, 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof, 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
CHORUS. 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together; 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo, 
The Murphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms, 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms. 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud, they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singing, etc. 
Young Rog' Flynn got up to dance, 
"With a 
lady from next door, 
" 
Come welt the tin," says Roger Flynn, 
" 
It's like a 
ball-room floor." 
Then one by one they joined the fun., 
Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was a 
sight that summer night, 
To see them on the roof. 
Singing, etc. 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pleasant breeze, 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself 
In an attitude of ease. 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And fill the air with glee, 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be. 
Singing, etc. 
Written by WALLY WEST, and sung only by HALEY and WEST. 
W E'RE a 
pair of liver-colored coons, 
As gay as gay can be; 
We're twins, and look so much alike, 
You can't tell him from me. 
Good (lancing and sweet singing 
Will please the gloomiest folks. 
We are adepts in both, you see, 
Two lively little mokes. 
For so easily we glide, 
First we jump and then we slide; 
Just watch us for awhile, 
As the music now begins, 
And note the graceful easy style 
Of the Alabama Twins. 
We figs are lively as can be, 
We sing the whole day long ; 
And as we sing, our feet keep time, 
To the music of the song. 
We're just as happy as two larks, 
The merriest little pair 
That ever tried by dancing 
To drive away dull care. 
For so pn_sily, et43. 
I'm floating along on de wings of peace, 
I 
feel just as slippery as axle grease ; 
Go tell Ulysses to fetch along Saul, 
There's lots of room for the short and tall. 
We'll pass you in, it won't cost a 
cent, 
No landlord around to collect the rent; 
It's free to all tO examine de ground, 
Don't dodge de hat when it's passed around. 
CIIORUS. 
Come, join de huckleberry picnic, 
It's going to take place to-day; 
I'se on de committee to invite you all, 
I 
ain't got long to stay. 
The wicked stands in a 
slippery place, 
A 
good man always holds an ace; 
If you cross the river put on your gown, 
Swim. like a 
fish and you'll surely drown. 
A 
policeman's like a 
wicked sin, 
If you don't look out he'll swoop you in; 
Denounce dishonesty of every sort, 
But steal like an artist, don't get caught. 
Co'. juir.

She's an angel from above, my little turtle dove, 
And with love for her my heart is heavy-laden. 
The last time that I

Oh, she's so sweet, and so complete, 
She's turned this darkey's head.

Sorrow will be over, 
Then we will so happy be, 
And this little fig will always live in eloTer. 
This maiden whom I

Is the sweetest little girl in all creation, 
With a 
rosy face so fair, and wavy golden hair, 
She possesses every art of fascination. 
She loves no one but me, and mine some day she'll be, 
I'll be happy when the wedding clay is o'er, 
Then when1 can call her wife, we shall lead a 
merry life,. 
joy and bliss, ecstatic evermore.

THE CINCINNATI HAM. 
Words and music by E. M. 
HALL. 
Sung by HARRY WoousoN, at CARNCEOSS & DIXEY'S Minstiels, 
Philadelphia. 
JOSEPHUS JOHNSON gave a 
ball, 
And invited the darkeys all, 
For miles they came in by the score, 
To flop their fat feet on the floor. 
(
Sym.) 
They had a 
fiddler from the country, 
He could only play one tune, 
The yellow clarinet was played; 
Quite gently blown by the breath of a 
big black coon. 
Sycamore Lize and E. Flat Sam, 
Can't you band me down the Cincinnati Ham. 
There was old Mrs. Simpson's sister Sue, 
Black Moorish and Duck-Foot Sue, 
And Stephen Granger when he'd swing, 
He'd clear the floor with the pigeon wing. 
You all blow about high kickers, 
Go and see Granger, then you'll talk, 
'He cleared the head of old Joe Previous, 
Then kicked the scalp from a 
six-foot gawk. 
Don't wear your feet out on the floor ; 
For when they're gone you'll get no more. 
Sycamore Lize and E. Flat Sam, 
Can't you hand me down that Cincinnati Ham ?

LONG AGO. 
Negro Character Song, by W ALLY W EST. 
IN 
a 
lowly little cabin down in dear ole Georgia State, 
Is where this nigger was bred and born ; 
And happily I 
passed away my childhood's golden hours, 
A 
hoeing of the sugar cane and corn. 
I 
used to pick the snow-white cotton, and ole massa's often 
said 
He had no better working hand than me ; 
But now I've left the dear old home, ole massa too is 
dead, 
Those happy days again no more I'll see. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
wish they'd come again, those good old days of yore, 
Us niggers never thought of care and woe ; 
We had no cruel overseer to drive us on through fear, 
In those happy times in Georgia long ago. 
Oft us little folks would gather round our dear old mother's 
knees, 
At night when all the niggers' work was done ; 
Ah, how often I 
have sat here, 'neatli the fragrant orange 
trees, 
An' watched the happy niggers in their fun. 
Then as years passed on I 
older grew, and learned to 
speak of love, 
In that k
-ame old-fashioned way we all do know, 
As we wandered arm in arm, 'neath the shining stars 
above, 
In those happy times in Georgia long ago. 
Oh, I 
wish they'd come again, etc.

THE SUFFERING SOUTH. 
Ara.— ii Remember You have Children of Yotir Own." 
Sung by Toyy PASTOR, at his own Theatre, Broadway, with great 
success. 
FROM beneath those sunny skies, 
-Where the summer never dies, 
Where Mississippi sweeps its lengths along; 
Borne North on every gale, . 
Comes a 
sad and plaintive wail, 
That does its- own sad misery prolong. 
It calls on us to hear, 
How the brethren we hold dear, 
Are battling sore with hunger and with want; 
How hope gives way to fear, 
As they see approaching near 
The spectre of the Fever grim and gaunt. 
They call on us to save, 
And the bounty that they crave, 
The North gave as it would in days of yore. 
They are brothers in distress, 
And heaven the North will bless, 
For it gave as tho' there'd never been a 
war. 
Fair Memphis droops her head, 
'Tis a 
city of the dead, 
That was once the proudest in the land. 
Her soul's with sorrow filled, 
Her nerveless arm is chilled, 
Her parched brow by the fever blast is fanned. 
Then, from the woods of Maine, 
To each distant western plain, 
Send forth your answer to her sobbing moan. 
And unto others do, 
As you'd have them do to you, 
For remember that her fate may be our own. 
- When the stake is death or life, 
Who would think of " section's " strife, 
While brothers hearts are bleeding to the core ? 
Think of those not far away. 
To whom sorrow comes each day, 
And give as the' there'd never been a 
war. 
SEE THAT MY GRAVE'S KEPT 
Sang by HALEY, W EST, and SPARES BROTHERS. 
W HEN I've passed in my checks, little rosebud, 
When I'm six feet under the turf, 
I'll forgive, you though you took me for a 
sucker, 
And played me for every penny I 
was worth; 
You said I 
might " look, but I 
musn't touch," 
And " you put me in quite a 
dilemma," 
But there's one little snap which I 
wish you would fake up, 
That's to see my grave is whitewashed every summer. 
Oh, the days will come to you, poison face, 
When you'll think of how you back-capped me when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off my grave with a 
pitchfork, will you, 
darling ? • 
Aiad decorate my grave with turkey breast, Thanksgiv-
ing ? 
Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember 
How you used to give me taffy on a 
stick; 
With your dizzy jokes you nearly paralyzed me, 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked ; 
I 
will meet you in that everlasting " By and By," 
Tra la lee, skip the sofa, you're my baby. 
Plant huckleberry trees on the next lot to me, darling, 
And see that my graye is kept shady ; 
Oh, my name will soon be Dennis, sweet Aleena. 
When you had a 
dollar I 
always stuck to you, 
Get a 
host of volunteers to play some kind of musio, 
And see my grave is kept red, white and blue. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
I'm an Irish politician, 
Yes, a 
man of integrity and fame, 
I'm your candidate for next President, 
Jerry McCormack, that's my name. 
I'm one of the laboring party, 
And its well I 
know my fate ; 
make politicians carry the hod, 
When McCormack rules the State. 
CHORUS. 
Then we'll have no Italian Congressmen, 
And the Chinese must emigrate ; 
There will be no more four- dollar cigars to smoke, 
When A.IcCormack rules the State. 
Then I'll have the White House painted green, 
Coal and wood I'll give away ; 
There be money found upon the street, 
I'll raise the laborers three dollars a 
day. 
I'll bounce Grant's friends from office, 
Then no railroad he'll elevate ; 
I'll have a 
bridge from New York to Ireland, 
When McCormack rules the State.

I 
SUPPOSE you've all heard of Mary Ann, 
. Who has the great edication ; 
. 
Well, I'm her father, Dinnis, 
And of that there's no dictation. 
I 
brought her up ; ' twas at a 
great expense 
Of a 
hundred thousand dollars, 
And now she has a 
piano, 
And forty thousand scollars ; 
,And the way she plays ' twould break your heart I'm 
sure. 
(
Break.) 
Her style and grace is something to adore; (
Break.) 
But I'll love and cherish her through life, 
As low, 
as she can earn a 
dollar : 
At the piano she'll set all day, 
fAnd this is what she'll holler ? 
CHORE'S. 
f 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
dumplin', she's a 
lamb ; 
k. You should see her play on the piano, 
Such an edicatiou has my Mary Ann. (
Repeat.) 
'There's a 
spalpeen by the name, of Billie Malone, 
-Who comes to court my daughter, 
When there all alone, at Dudley's Grove 
It's most to death hell talk her ; 
He tells her that his mother is a 
king, 
• 
And with all such talk he will stuff her ; 
But if I 
lay my hands on him, 
I'll paralyze that young duffer, 
For away they galavant, and they say tra-la-lo, 
(Break.) 
Skip the gutter, Charley, for you are very fleet. 
(Break.) 
But I'll love and cherish her through life, 
As long as she can earn a 
dollar ; 
At the piano she'll set all day, 
And this LI 
what

&Le's a 
darling; et.

WALTZING IN THE MORGUE. 
Banjo Solo. 
Written by W ALLY W EST. 
NEW subjects now are very scarce 
In this advancing age; 
If a 
man should strike a 
new idea., 
They'd have him in a 
cage. 
However, I 
shall run all risks, 
And as I 
go along, 
You'll see that I've struck something new, 
In the title of my song. 
CHORUS. 
(. c 
, 
'Tis waltzing in the morgue, in the dim and dusky twilight, 
With stiffs all around, laid out on the ground, 
A 
vision fair, which charmeth the eyesight ; 
It's pleasanter by far, than oyster canning a 
dog ; 
My chiefest delight on a 
warm summer's night, 
Is waltzing in the morgue. 
I 
called one evening on my girl, 
And asked her to a 
ball ; 
She is a 
daisy, too, you bet, 
She's just about six foot tall. 
She wears a 
number sixteen shoe, 
Her foot looks like a 
log; 
You should see her dainty slippers, when 
She's waltzing in the morgue. 
Whirling around with Charley may be very fascinating 
For young damsels fair, with bright golden hair, 
And bosom fair, with joy palpitating ; 
But pleasanter far to me, as I 
never was known as a 
hog, 
Is with my sweet girl, as madly we whirl, 
While— waltzing in the morgue.

LAST Wednesday I 
attended a 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and famly of Timothy J. Cosgrove; 
Kellys, FIogans, and O'Briens, all came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, and try and win 
the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward Four, Allaman Left, while the music it did play ; 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay. 
I 
never laugh'd so hearty in the course of all my life: 
Looking at Plug McCarthy, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely the raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jump'd ten feet high when sixty four was 
flung; 
O'Brien yell'd out murder, with a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, while raffling for the stove, 
Forward Four, etc. 
At six o'clock in the morning the raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk and stole away the door ; 
Clancy with a 
bottle, sure he all the windows broke ; 
When Cosgrove grabb'd him by the neck, and boys, I 
thought he'd choke. 
Forwari Four, etc.

W ALLY W EST) and sung only by"Lee Grotesrpros 
Eccentrique," HALEY and W EST. 
I'm always happy, gay and free, 
My heart's as light as air; 
It's brimming o'er with joy and love 
For a 
maiden fair, 
With flashing eyes and teeth like pearl, 
And lips of rosy line. 
She is, compared with other girls, 
A 
diamond, tried and true; 
I 
love her, and I've promised her 
Her name I'd never tell. 
I 
will not; still, I've christened her 
My Darling Isabel. 
CHORUS. 
My darling Isabel, 
The one I 
love so well, (Syn.) 
The fairest flower that ever grew 
In a 
shady dell 
For being sweet, could ne'er compete 
With darling Isabel. 
On Sunday eve, at half-past eight, 
I 
go my love to see, 
Down by the little rustic gate, 
She's waiting there for me ; 
I 
take her arm, we stroll along 
Where the silvery moonbeams play. 
Beneath the shade of the greenwood glade, 
My love and I 
do stray.

Her name I'd never tell.

GRANDMOTHTIR'S CHAIR. 
As sung by JACK CONAOY with immense success.

ltiv grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood side by side. 
To my brother it was found, she had left a hundred 
pounds, 
The same unto ray sister, I 
declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said, " I 
see, 
She has left to you her old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they tittered, how they chaffed, 
How my brother and sister laughed, 
When they heard the lawyer declare, 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the evening took the chair away ; 
The neighbors they me chaffed, my brother at 
laughed, 
And said it will be useful John some day.

GRANDMOTHER'S CHAIR.—Concluded. 
When you settle down in life, find some girl to be your 
-wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare ; 
On a 
cold frosty night, when the fire is burning bright, 
Thu can sit in your old arm-chair. 
And how they tittered, etc. 
What my brother said was true, for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say, I 
settled down in married life; 
I 
first a 
girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church, and when she was my wife 
The old girl and me were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over, I 
declare, 
ne'er abroad would roam, but each night would stay at 
home, 
And be seated in my old arm-chair. 
And how they tittered, etc. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
picked it up I 
found 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor; 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more. 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage, and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laughed at him, then said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm- chair ? 
And how they tittered, etc.

UNcLE SA:st he was once at a 
festive affair, 
And they call'd upon Sam for a 
strain; 
So be put out his weed and he toss'd off his glass, 
And then he commenc'd this refrain : 
I'll sing of " our boys," ‘vho have made a 
great name, 
There's Captain Borgardus, said he; 
In Europe he show'd them how %veil be could shoot, 
his equal we seldom shall see.

We're proud of *‘ our boys," we are ; 
He's honest and true, so we give him his due, 
lie's one of " our boys," hurrah ! 
We've got a 
very good rifle team, 
They crossed the wide ocean you know ; 
They defeated the D,)1Iymount marksmen with ease, 
And brought off the prizes I 
vow ; 
They've defeated :since then the Canadian team, 
And although they don't make a 
great noise, 
They are open to meet any marksmen on earth, 
Gildersleeve and his bonny brave boys. 
CHORUS. 
They belong to " our boys," they do; 
We are proud of such boys, we are! 
They're honeSt and true, so we give them their due, 
They belong to " our boys," hurrah ! 
When old Johnny Bull had Livingstone lost, 
Au(' given him tip in despair • 
It was one of " our boys," Jim 'Bennet, who still, 
" 
For the Doctor I'll DOW have a 
care " 
It was one of " our boys," and a 
plucky one, too, 
Who went out and Livingstone found ; 
All honor to Stanley, may courage like his 
Be always successfully crowned.

Is one we shall never forget, 
He founded this nation, the pride of creation, 
And astonished J. Bull, you may bet; 
George Washington's name by all is revered, 
So fill up each cup and each can, 
And we'll make the roof ring whir st we shout and we sing, 
Fer George was a 
mighty great man.

He was chief of " our boys," he was,

This tress, this tress recalls them now ; 
Again I 
see them eh:stet., 
in beauty, in beauty ' round her brow ; 
Oh, tender are the mem'ries 
That wake from out the past; 
I 
live again life's morning, 
Too beautiful, too beautiful to IhSt, oh!

In childhood s

Once more I

And all, and all the b!essings there; 
Oh, lovely tress of silver, 
Whatever cares may be, 
My heart, in all its trials, 
ls nearer beav'n, is nearer heav'n for thee, oh! 
The gray hairs, etc.

THE GOSPEL RAFT. 
Written by FRANK Dualoyr. 
Dedicated to Mn. AnoarE Warn. 
I'sE gwine to cross the river on de gospel raft, 
Like Noah in de good ole ark ; 
Keep your candles all a-burning; keep dem burning all 
de time, 
Or you'll lose yourself and tumble in de dark. 
Get your baggage on de craft, don't forget to get your 
check ; 
You've got to pay your passage right to- day ; 
Be sure de money's good, for de captain's eye is sharp, 
You can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
CHORUS. 
Hide away, hide away; dar's no use trying to hide 
away ; 
Get your baggage on de craft, 
Don't forget to have it checked, 
For you can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
Let me tell you about de army Mr. Pharaoh did command 
:When he followed ole Moses long ago ; 
They was drowned in de water wid their life preservers on, 
And de fishes had a 
jubilee below. 
Dar was Jonah was a 
fool and as stubborn as a 
mule ; 
But de whale he made him quickly disappear ; 
Jonah den pulled out a 
razor and he cut de whale in half, 
And he floated to do shore upon his ear. 
Hide away, etc. 
Now, take warning, little children, don't you fool about 
de raft, 
For de opposition boat is running too ; 
But she's liable to burst her boiler any time at all, 
And you Diggers will be cooked into a 
stew. 
rse got a 
private box and an opera glass to see 
You sinners trying to buzz in at de door ; 
But dey'll kick you down de stairs if you hasn't got de 
grace. 
If you come back dey'll slap you in de jaw. 
Hide away, etc.
