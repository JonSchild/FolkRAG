Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
I wish to thank you for your letter notifying us of execution of
 
the contract with the Media Center of the Extension Division at the
 
University of California, Berkeley for the film Pizza Pizza Daddy 0
.
 
I am of the belief that the legal intricacies probably will never
 
become entirely resolved and that your handling of the matter is
 
quite acceptable.
 It would be possible to establish an account
 
with the SFVSC Foundation for the Department of Anthropology and for
 
EOP to receive funds from the film's proceeds which you may wish
 
to assign to them.
 
Sincerely,
 
Kenneth A. Wilson
 
Associate Dean

you may know, during tne academic year
 i tni i tu
 
roject of filming traditional singing games played by black c ! .
 
in the Los Angeles area.  This project was financed through the
 
O&E budget of the Department of Anthropology, and resulted final.
"
. ,
 
in the production of a fifteen minute, black and white, 16 mr
 
t
itled PIZZA PIZZA DADDY 0.  The total cost of the film to t
 
partment was approximately $2,000.
 
L
nce the completion of the film, it has been shown to classes
 
faculty groups at SFVSC, UCLA and UC Berkeley, as well as at sever
 
public schools in ths Angeles.  The Tr -University Curriculum Prolc
.;
.
 
at Nebraska has used it twice and has repeatedly asked to buy a
 
for their library.  It has been shown at the national meetings o
 
the American Folklore S0ciety at the University of Indiana, and
 
ovember of this year it will be screened for the national meeti:
 
Anthropology Association in New Orleans.
 
L
 l96 , I was approached by the Media Center of the
 
on Division at the University of California, Berkeley; this agencj 
roposed to buy the film for distribution to educational institution .
 
Both Bob Eborlein, my co-producer, and I found that the Media Center
 
is held in high esteem in the educational film industry; their dtstr
,
 
button is first-rate and their contracts reliable.  However, in spit
 
of numerous conferences with the Foundation, Dean Maurice Dance and
 
others. tge legal problem of just who owned the film seemed in doubt
 
no one seemed to know who could s
ign the prop:
 
the royalty monies --  if any . -  could be patch
 
At the end of August of this year, since no prugruss
u L
e
 
the problem for five months, I decided myself to take reeponsibili:
 
for the future of the film and myself signed the contract with the
 
Media Center.  I am informed by the Media Center that they do not
 
pay royalties until a full year after they have been able to make a
i
 
-'stribute the first prints; in this case, then, no monies will be
 
.
ilable to be received by anybody until December of 1971 •
 My ho
 
that by then s
ome more proper determination can be made of just
 
se this film is; and, should the matter still be unsettled by
 
.e time royalties are due, I propose to put them in a spcial savi:
 
co'rnt  '
nd leave them u
,.
 toueh M until the nrohlem of their nro.
 
I
 
2.
 
y own feeling about these hypothetical royalty checks is that
 
an Fernando Valley State College
 not the Bureau of the Budc-et
 
should be reimbursed for ttse expenses in the production of t
 
film.  And personally, I should like to see any monies receiv
 
:
) to $2,000.00 split between the Department of Anthropology
 
e EOP fund, since by the latter means, especially, the chil
 
o actually "
starred" in the film might conceivably benefit.
 
realize there is probably no way to do thisl h
'
 
olution would seem to me both fair and equitabl
 
ter the expenses have been repaid, though,  (
and the
 entei
 
3  well as other people in educational films tell me that only
 
i
e really remarkable film ever earns as much as $2,000), it seem.
 
me that any monies that might conceivably accrue should really
 
elong to Bob Eberlein and myself, since we did all the work on  '
 
ilm on our own time.  I can't see that this situation is in an
 
:
ay different to the case of the faculty member who writes a bo
 
:
iile on active teaching duty.  Should he use college factlitie
 
or duplicating and so forth, he would presumably pay for these Out
 
:f his own pockets however, after expenses, the college
 or the
 
tate of California
 would not figure as financial beneficiaries,
 
owever, the above two paragraphs simply sum up my personal reaacttons
 
.
o the problems I am perfectly willing to have the matter settled by
 
he appropriate legal or administrative authorities.  And I do not
 
ant to becloud the principal issue prompting this lengthy letter,
 
o give formal notification that I have "sold" the film to the
 
adia Center and that I did so on my own responsibility alone.
 I
 
Id not consult with any members of the Department of Anthropology
 
fore taking this steps and if there are any objections raised
 
'
 n
n ,  admi
. ttedly somewhat high-handed procedure, they should be
 
•
 2
 •
.
,
 not to the Department.
 
because the film has a certain current and topical
 
.due; though 1 hope the national concern with ghetto education and
 
i
etto life-style will continue for a long time, it is quite possible
 
:hat it may not.  Therefore, if the film is to be useful •
 and
 
r
icidentally, to make any royalties
 it shosuld be made available
 
soon as possible.  And with the tremendous problems now confronting
 
i
e state educational system it seemed highly likely to me that such
 
• small and thorny issue might be kept in abeyance indefinitely#
 
hope you will keep this letter as evidence of my good faith and
 
tentions in the matters and should you wish to see a copy of the
 
ontract I signed with the Media Center, I will of course make it
 
vtlat>le to you tr
nn!odtately.

 Secondly,  I must apologize in advance for putt
 
rob1em to you so close to the start of the semester; how;
 
rh all the administrative changes at VSC I don't know whon

;
 
fact is that, with Bob Eberlein's cooperation not to say c
 
vance,  I have turned over
 I
A PI
A DADDY-u to the Univers L.
.
 
California Extension media Service and have signed  their stan
 
tract, a copy of which I will be glad to send you if you want
 
see it.
 ky intentions are (with written concurrence from Bol
 
rlein) to put any and all royalty monies received into a sepn
 
vings account where they will lie, untouched by human hand, un
 
h time as they may possibly amount to $2,00.00 at which poinc
 
the remote future I will start arguing with whoever at VSC h
l-
l
ap  
ed the bomb as to what to do with them.
 My own notion is t
 
? f jar thing would be to donate a proportion to the Department
 
a proportion to the EUF fund or whatever has by then taken L
 
i
ce.
 In the meantime,  the contract specifies that the film wi

'''itinnp1

r theatre showin is bar

t accompli method, but
 
i
 1
 was the only available
 
t of the particular impasse that I found myself in; and furthn
 
at this announcement would even be greeted with sighs of relic
 
some quarters.
 Now most of the people involved can start for
 
i
g about it, unless the State of California decides to sue we,
 
Ich case I shall simply go get a lawyer.
 For me,  the precipita
 
ctor in coming to the decision was the information from UC Ext
,
 
on that they don't pay royalties anyway until a full year has
 
sed.
 In that case, what are we arguing about?  A non-exist
 
i
n of mythical money possibly payable in the misty future -
-
ole thing reminds me of Lincoln's "
shadow of a pigeon who h
.
 
orved to death".
 And while we are all arguing happily abou:
 
ioreseaable outcome,  the film goes quietly out of date and no
 
nts to see it anyway.
 FPDC, after all, is not a breakthrough
 
a
' art of film production;  it is a slight piece of documentatin
 
a behavior pattern that is already two years old, for gOOdf

During the a
cademic year 1968-9, the Anthropology Department produced
 
on the s
ubject
 
a twenty-minute sound black and white 16 mm filin/of tr
zaf
ti
 the traditional
 
it has been titled
 
games of black children in the Watts area;  
 PIZZA PIZZA DADDY-0.  The
 
film was financed by departmental monies but involved the s
ervices of only
 
two staff members:  MmE Robert W. Eberlein who
 e ±b
xf
xz
t±ng
 
handled the cutting and d
irectorial assignment and  :
uu
 
folklorist and
 
myself as writer RysZ initiator of the project.
 
I have received an offer from Donna Lee Smith of the Nedia
 ±sicrç Center
 
University Extension, University of California at Berkeley to kax
iA distribute
 
the film; they offer a 20% royalty on both prx a s
ale of prints and rental
 
income.  I am advised that this is a good offer  ar
-dxtkatz±h
,
,R financially
 
speaking and that the t WAa  is well placed to gRtxtkOxf
t2M promote the film
 
They estimate verbally that they would charge anproximately  lOO.CO
 
per prints and  8000 per rental period of three days
 
The Anthropology Department Executive Committee has concurred with my
 
suggestion that we turn the film over to Ux
. 4zMoxkR1xX the Media Center and that
 
the funds accruing be handled as follows:  that the Foundation be asked to s
et up
 
an accountA into which all royalty monies will be paid until the total cost of
 
o film (2,O00 00) has been repaid; any subsequent fees t -  divided between
 
interest

his
 
agreement and grant to Media Center all the rights granted and agreed to be granted under this
 
agreement; that it has taken all necessary action to authorize the execution and delivery of
 
this agreement; and that this agreement does not and will not violate any contract or any other
 
agreement to which Owner is a party.
 
13.

bition or distribution of the Software or any infringement upon the rights of Owner or Media
 
Center under this agreement; and Media Center or its nominee may, as Owner's attorney-in-fact,
 
execute, acknowledge, verify and deliver all instruments pertaining thereto in the name of and
 
on behalf of Owner.
 
Media center may also take such steps as it shall deem necessary or appropriate by action, at
 
law or otherwise, to recover monies due pursuant to any agreement relating t
o the distribution
 
or exhibition of the Software.

Your annual royalty report and payment for the fiscal year 1972/73 are enclosed.
 We
 
regret that the report is so late; the explanation follows.
 Please cash your check
 
promptly since because of our delay the check's 90 day limit is now quite near.
 
You will note that the report covers only eleven months this year, for a period end-
ing April 30 instead of May 30.
 It was necessary to make this change to facilitate
 
EMC's conversion to a new accounting system and we hope it will not be inconvenient
 
for you.
 If necessary you may request a report now for the single month of May.
 If
 
you do not, your next report will include May.
 
It is our plan to report to you twice a year in January and July, beginning with a
 
report in January 1974 for the period May 1 through December 30, 1973.
 Future reports,
 
beginning with one in July covering January 1 through June 30, 1974, will cover six
 
month periods.
 
This report is late because we wanted to send you our new distribution agreement along
 
with it.
 For several years we have needed a more detailed agreement, primarily
 
because of the rapidly increasing demand for a list of our films that are cleared for
 
various types of television use and other forms of electronic distribution.
 This new
 
standard agreement has been in preparation literally for years, culminating this week
 
in final approval by the University administration which we have been expecting daily
 
since we prepared the royalty reports in early May.
 
The new agreement that we hope you will sign sounds somewhat more formidable than the
 
old one because it was prepared by attorneys.
 Its most important aspect, however, is
 
simply the "Attachment A" at the end that gives you an opportunity to grant or with-
hold a wider variety of specific rights.  We have indicated the four rights we con-
sider essential to our effective distribution and we hope you will grant us those plus
 
any or all of the others.
 For instance, in section "A.
 Types of Software," even
 
though your film is 16mm we would be interested in having other rights as well if you
 
have no objection.  We get inquiries from clients who wish to buy 16mm films in 8mm or
 
on videotape, or even wish to use the sound track on audiotape.
 
In section "B.
 Distribution systems,
 2
.  Electronic presentation," we believe it i
s
 
important that you grant us the rights for educational/instructional utilization in
 
the interest of effective distribution of your film.  To withhold it limits the film
 
to use by direct projection and this means that a growing number of EMC clients either
 
will not use the film or will make unauthorized use of it on closed circuit television
 
r other internal systems.  We are forced to regard this technology as the new direct
 
projection method and we are prepared to license and control its use,  thereby sharing
 
additional income with you in royalty.
 
-2-
We have amended the agreement's terms (
please initial clause 15)  to correspond with
 
those of your original agreement in duration and we have completed most other sections
 
where we could safely assume your preferences from the earlier agreement.
 Please com-
plete all remaining sections, sign, and return the agreement as soon as possible, or
 
contact us to work out details.
 (Our mailing address and phone number are on page 6
.)
 
We greatly prefer that you mark each specific distribution right (Attachment A) either
 
"granted" or "not granted" rather than indicating that you wish to be consulted about
 
individual instances.  Although the volume of requests for electronic use of films is
 
not yet great,  they are complicated to handle and license on an individual basis.  We
 
must prepare a list of films that are cleared and we hope that nearly all EMC Sales
 
Films can be included.  The fact that you have placed your trust in EMC by selecting
 
us as your distribution agent leads us to hope that you will want to allow us to act
 
in your behalf in authorizing proper use of your material.
 
Please let us know if you have questions.
 
Cordially,
 
EXTENSION MEDIA CENTER

Dear Bess:
 
The attempt to sell the Georgia Sea Island film came to nothing
 
because it was lost in the mail.
 I am attempting to make the
 
company involved pay for the copy.  Meantime I want to copy
 
excerpts of Pizza Pizza, the Georgia Sea Island film of Ed
 
step-dancing.
 I enclose a contract covering a
im  Pizza Pizza.
 
Can you do the following:
 1
) lend me a copy of Pizza Pizza;
 
2) tell me where the original i
s and how we can copy off parts
 
of it; 3
) tell me where the Georgia Sea Island negatives are
 
stored so we can pick the best of this material?  Perhaps you
 
have seen it all.  Would you say the best dance stretches were
 
Buzzard Lope and Down in the Mire?  As they are in the film?
 
Is it worth our trouble to try for longer shots?
 
I think things are on the mend in Houston from the conversations
 
I have had.
 Thanks for your long and helpful letter about the train-
ing tapes.
 I think that we will do the consensus testing here this
 
time where I can supervise it and get a notion myself of what's
 
wrong,  if anything.  Working hard.
 
Much love.  Write.

I write to invite your participation in a new use for the cinema and the growth of
 
a new branch of the humanistic sciences.  A team of movement analysts and anthropologists,
 
working under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Health here at Columbia University,
 
have developed a method for describing and comparing the dance styles of the world.  This
 
computerized technique i
s called Choreometrics, meaning dance as a measure of culture
 
and has led to exciting discoveries about the relation of dance to everyday movement
 
s
tyle and to human adaptation.
 
An ethnography of movement style i
s in progress, in which we are studying and cor
n-
'
 i
rig the best footage of dance from all over the world.  Many archives and individuals
 
ave contributed footage or have permitted us to copy their material at cost.  We have
 
creened some of your footage, found i
t to be of great scientific interest, and wish to
 
opy excerpts from the following film of which you are the owner:  
 
Pizza Pizza
 
T is letter, in the provisions specified below, authorizes the Choreometrics Project
 
to copy such material as we have selected and use i
t as follows:
 
a
)  To analyze it in Choreometric terms and incorporate the data in our world com-
puter map.
 
b
)  To use portions of the footage in the compilation of teaching and in educa-
tional films about Choreometrics.
 
The Choreometrics Project of Columbia University undertakes to
 
a
)  Send you the results of our analysis, so that you can place your material in
 
a context of world and regional cultural pattern in your publications or continuity.
 
b
)  List your films in our publications and bibliographies thus making your work
 
known to anthropologists and educators.
 
c
)  Pay all lab costs for duplication the selected footage including shipping
 
where applicable.
 
d
)
 If you so specify, we also agree to pay a basic royalty fee of$ 4 .
00 per foot
 
for each section of footage that we reproduce in educational films.  This fee
 
covers showing on educational TV.
 
In the event that these films receive further usage, the royalty scale shall
 
be amended as follows:
 Commercial television -
 Initial showing $6.00 per f
oot.  Any
 
subsequent showing$5.00 per foot.
 
Theatrical distribution $5.00 per foot.
 
In return for the above you agree to grant the Choreometrics Project, which i
