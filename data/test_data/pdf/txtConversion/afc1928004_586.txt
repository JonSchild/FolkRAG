THE EDITOR. 
Dedicated to our dear friend NED STRAIGHT, Musical 
Composer, 273 Elizabeth Street, New York. 
Yours, truly, 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT. MUSIC 
to suit these wards for sale at 
IVEtimAN's, 50 Chatham Street. 
Sung with great 
success by the HAYLES. 
I 
love a 
little country lass, 
A 
charming, rustic queen; 
With eyes as bright as stars at night, 
Or noonday's radiant gleam. 
I 
meet her in the valley, 
I'm sure she knows no harm; 
She'll be here soon by the light of the moon, 
We'll have fun down on the farm. 
By gosh, what a 
squash, 
With a 
big banana and a 
pineapple too, 
We'll have fun, chewing gum, 
And fun down on the farm. 
Merry bees, gentle breeze, 
Warbling birdies flying through the trees; 
Happy day, among the hay, 
It's fun down on the Farm. 
A merry lad, he loves me, 
As you can plainly see; 
I 
see him every evening, 
He's waiting now for me. 
He'll meet me in the valley, 
As he has done before; 
With roses sweet, oh! what a 
treat, 
My love, my lardy dah. 
To those who kindly volunteered. 
Written by the HAYLES.

The comedy American Four make a 
very strong team, 
They closed the show with Murphy's dream. 
Written by ED. AUSTIN for the HAYLEs. 
We dearly love the old homestead, 
There we've passed happy hours; 
Out in the scented clover fields, 
Among the hay and flowers. 
We love the lane where daisies grow, 
And buttercups of gold; 
But more than all the dear old home, 
Moss cornered, plain and old. 
Cnonus: 
Happy and contented we will be, 
Merry as the birds that sing in the tree; 
Our love of home don't scorn, 
For here we both were born; 
And we love to hear the rustle of the golden rye 
Near the fields of waving er‘ria. 
We think that now it's time to go, 
Our team is hitched out there; 
Our parents who have gone on ahead, 
We'll follow to the fair. 
These country fairs we understand, 
Take place but once a 
year; 
We'll go and see the sights to-day, 
And then we'll come back here. 
Written expressly for the HAYLES by NED STRAIGHT. 
As sung by 
the II AVLES with great success in all the principal variety 
theatres of America. 
Oh, here we are, a 
jolly pair, 
We came from Yankee soil, 
Our parents are good farmers, 
Holiest folks of daily toil; 
In milking and in churning, too, 
We are the queen and king, 
Oh, when our work is over then 
We love to dance and sing. 
We do a 
cornfield jig, 
And dance a 
hay mow reel, 
And when we hear old-fashioned tunes 
So good it makes us feel; 
Of course we country people 
Never can be upper crust, 
But we can beat them dancing 
To the tune of money musk. 
We rise up in the morning 
At the early break of day, 
We 
1( ed the chickens, pigs and sheep, 
And rake the new-mown hay; 
Then we crack our heels with joy, 
To hear the dinner horn. 
And when we're finished eating, then 
The table looks forlorn; 
And when the evening comes, 
Us boys and gals are seen 
Playing tag and fox and geese, 
And, dancing on the green. 
Although we're from the country, 
Yet we love to shake our heel, 
And we can beat the city folks 
A 
dancing oper reel. 
To my friends the Ileymcs, With compliments of the 
author, Wm. DEVERE. 
It was many years ago, when I 
used to rake and hoe 
In the Southern bottoms far away; 
And the darkeys used to sing till they made the welkin 
ring, 
And the dinner horn would summon us away. 
Those happy days of yore the old man will see no more, 
lie is waiting for his summons now to come 
Front the horn that blows up dar, 'mong the angels bright 
and fair, 
To call me from my good old Southern home. 
All my friends have gone up dar 'mong the angels bright 
and fair, 
Good old mosso is summoning poor old Sam to come; 
Don't you hear their voices dear, we are waiting for you 
here, 
They call me from my good old Southern home. 
Massa told me when he died, that if I 
only tried 
To live a 
Christian life and honest, 
T 
would be blessed with a 
mansion in the skies, where the 
Christian never dies, 
And this poor old darkey will be at rest. 
Then old missus went one day, poor old Sam could hardly 
pray, 
Young mossa went in foreign lands to roam; 
Now there's nothing left to cheer this old darkey's heart 
so drear, 
I 
must go and leave my good old Southern home. 
PAP'S BLIND MULE. 
RECITATION. 
Recited by the HAYLES in thc:r character sketch. 
Our pa is a 
little crooked man, just like a 
crooked stick, 
He owns a 
little old blind mule, and how this mule can 
kick; 
lie can kick as quick as lightning, and he has a marrow 
jaw, 
He is just the thing to have around to.efire your mother-
in-law. 
Pap's blind mule. 
fIe is a 
king high kicker and he pulverized a 
hog, 
He dissected seven Chinamen and mashed a 
yellcw dog; 
lie stopped an Erie railroad train, and kicked it off the 
track, 
He kicked the stuffing from a 
goose, and broke a 
nigger's 
back, 
Pap's blind mule. 
He stopped a 
steamboat with his head, and kicked it out of 
sight; 
He kicked a boarding house apart at twelve o'clock at 
night. 
The boarders in their baseball suits stood and held their 
breath, 
While he rammed his hind leg down his throat and kicked 
himself to death. 
Pap's blind mule.

Now we're off for the husking bee, 
husking bee, husking bee; 
Won't we have a 
jolly spree, 
A 
romping in the hay. 
Then we'll go for the pumpkin pie, 
Pumpkin pie, pumpkin pie, 
By gosh we'll make the cider fly, 
Till all of us feel gay. 
ClIORUS: 
For were the sort for fun, 
Yankee girls and Yankee boys; 
We wait until our work is done, 
And then we all kick up a 
noise. 
(Repeat). 
To spelling schools we often go. 
Often go, often go; 
They stand us up all in a 
row, 
And spell down all the class. 
We then go home and play pillows f..-nd keys, 
Pillows and keys, pillows and keys; 
We carry on just as we please, 
And steal the apple sass.

Where the balmy air was blowing and the roses cai...11 try= 
dew, 
The mocking bird was singing in the trees; 
'There's a 
lovely little city and cwill ever hold it tin , 
I 
was born among the buttf,rilirs and bees. 
Through them pastures and them fields I 
Lied the .vii.i1;? 
day long, 
From them I've been obliged to roam; 
Lsong, 
When I 
think of merry times and the good oid dance and 
I 
long to see my old Savannah home. 
Cuours: 
I 
long to see you once again and feel your scented breeze, 
Through your sunny streets I 
long 
to 
roam; 
I 
long to hear the mocking birds a 
singing in the trees, 
That bloom around my old Savannah home. 
Where the sweet magnolia blossoms that am blooming in 
the lane, 
Those gardens that am laden with perfume; 
All am dearer to this darkey than the long and level plain, 
For there we had room enough to roam. [skies, 
The shining moon at night that came peeping through the 
Our tlathoats along the beautiful river shore; 
And down the rippling water where Fort Pulaski lies, 
Our merry dancing party soon was o'er. (Chorus). 
Them good old days am past and gone, the boys they have 
gone too, 
The pretty girls are scattered o'er the land; [say, 
And times ain't like they used to was when massa had his 
And each plantation had its darkey band. 
There's a 
handsome little spot, the place where I 
was born, 
And a 
lovely little cot I 
long to see; 
'Twas there they laid my mother down one quiet, pleasant 
morn, 
The songsters sang their sad and plaintive glee 
(Chorus). 
[Parody.] 
Air.—Empty Cradle. 
Little empty pig pen smells so nice and sweet, 
how the precious burden used to squeal; 
We can have some roast pork and pickled pig's feet, 
And some fresh spare ribs every meal. 
We killed him with a 
knife at the right time of the moo 
And scrubbed him till the break of dawn; 
Now he's in the barrel, salted for evermore, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. 
Cnonus: 
Piggy's left the swill-trough to eat from it no more, 
O'er the briny water be has flown ; 
Gone to join the Boers on Africa's shore, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. 
Near the cellar door stands a 
barrel now, 
Overhead the cob-webs are thick; 
It always makes us sad when we think of him now, 
And the ninny times we scratched hint with a 
stick. 
He could play seven up, and draw poker too, 
And sing all the latest songs ; 
Now he's in a 
barrel packed forever more, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. 
(Chorus). 
FOREIGN COUSINS. 
Written by En. A 
usrm. Sung by the HAYLES. MAYO and TALBOT. 
Kind friends we're here to entertain, 
But we'll make one request; 
And ask you all to bear in mind, 
We're going to do our best. 
Our hearts are light, our voices right, 
And music all complete; 
Enjoyment always rules supreme, 
When foreign cousins meet. 
(Chorus). 
We're near the pastures and the fields, 
Where the honey-suckles grow; 
And where the little butter-cups, 
Their golden petals show. 
And while the English sparrows chirp, 
And blue birds sing so sweet; 
We'll show you how we sing and dance, 
When foreign cousins meet. 
(Chorus). 
'Tis many years since last we met, 
We'll hold reunion here; 
And pass the happy hours away, 
In friendship and good cheer. 
We'll strew each other's path through life, 
With roses bright and sweet; 
And may no dark cloud dim the sky, 
When foreign cousins meet. 
(Chorus). 
RECITATION. 
As given by the Iimas in their great sketch. 
We'll tell about a 
Chinaman, 
lie was born in the town of Cahoes; 
His head it was fiat, just like a 
bed-slat, 
lie used to wear h( n- skin shoes. 
He had freckles all over his face, 
And warts all over his tongue, 
his nose it was hooked, his legs they were crooked, 
lie looked like a 
tramp or a 
bum, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
Ile got the croup while eating soup, 
We thought lie was a 
goner; 
lie got sore eyes looking at pies 
In a 
grocery around the corner. 
He had a 
face like a 
Texas steer, 
And eyes like a 
soft shell crab; 
lie had the glanders and yellow jauders, 
We thought he would go mad, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
His head it was big as a 
drum, 
lie was tongue-tied in the feet; 
He fell through a 
hall and lit on his gall, 
And landed away out in the street. 
He had a 
big wart on his ear, 
A 
cancer on his back; 
While shoveling fog he was bit by a 
hog. 
We packed him home in a 
sack, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
His mouth was twisted from eating hot biscuit, 
He was anything but stout; 
You could hear him holler fourteen miles, 
And he never had the gout. 
When he walked the street his back would squeak, 
He always had the blues; 
He was long and thin like a 
piece of tin, 
lie was horn in the town of Cahoes, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
Air—Funny Old Gal. 
Written by Ilit.Ly HAM& Sung by the MIME% 
We live in the country, 
There's where we were born; 
On the farm we always work, 
Hoeing out the corn. 
We walked to the City, 
The sights for to see; 
With uncle Johnson and his wife, 
We never can agree. 
Now they are gone, 
Oh! ain't we glad; 
Now they are gone, 
Ohl ain't we glad. 
Now they are gone, 
We've got a 
good chance, 
We'll show our funny movement 
While at a 
country dance, 
We better be a 
going, 
No longer we can stay; 
if they come back and catch us, 
The deuce will be to play, 
Before we leave 
We're going to have some fun; 
We'll break down the floor, 
And then away we'll run.

Far away in suuny meadows, 
Where the merry sunbeams play'd

Amber tresses tied in blue. 
CHORDS. 
She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond and true, 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
Ere the summer days departed, 
We had made a 
solemn vow, 
And I 
never, never wearied 
Kissing her sweet cheek and brow; 
She was d:tarer than the dearest, 
Pure as drops of morning dew, 
And adown her neck was hanging 
Amber tres3es tied in blue. 
She was fair & Ir. 
'Twas decreed that fate should part us, 
Ere the leaves of autumn fell, 
And two loving hearts were severed 
That had loved each other well; 
She was all I 
had to cherish, 
She has bade a 
last adieu, 
And I 
see in ev'ry vision 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer, ,te.

Some time ago there was a

A 
Leaf of Ivy from my Mother's Grave. 
Originally composed by CHARLES A. SIviLLE, and sung with great 
success in all the leading theatres in America. 
I 
went to Greenwood yesterday, 
To visit my angel mother's grave; 
Gently I 
knelt beside the mound, 
And took a 
leaf of Ivy from the grave; 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow • 
And ' tis only in my visions, 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
CHORUS: 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow; 
And 'tis only in my visions, 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
Mother died when I 
was quite young, 
And it soon broke up my home; 
Soon I 
found I 
was not welcome, 
And like a 
stranger I 
did roam; 
All I've got now to remember her, 
And which I 
cherish and will save 
Is this little leaf of Ivy, 
A 
leaf of Ivy front my mother's grave. 
(Chorus). 
Since mother's death I 
feel forsaken, 
And o'er the wide world I 
have roamed; 
Until, when my poor heart was breaking. 
With my brother, then, I 
found a 
home; 
From mother we'll not long be parted, 
Soon we'll meet her up above. 
Where we'll ne'er again be parted, 
But will live in joy and endless love. 
(Chorus).

PATSY KELLY'S BEAU. 
Parody on " 
Mary Kelly's Beau," as sung by HAr.DAGAN 
HART as 
the THEATRE COMIQUE. 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT. 
Little Patsy Kelly, 
A dandy very small; 
Sells evening papers, 
On the Bowery for a 
Bail. 
The gang upon the corner, 
Not many days ago; 
Introduced me ye's can bet, 
As Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
CHORUS: 
Dandy Patsy Kelly, a 
Handy Andy lad, 
When I'm strolling with him the mashers get it bact, 
Its naughty, but .nicey, I'm still a 
friend to you, 
Go tell it to your Fairies, I 
am Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
He lives in 3.1ulligan's building, 
Just up nine flights of stairs; 
He keeps his Father and Mother, 
And Silks and Satins wears. 
He takes care of his Brother, 
His Sister to Jail did go; 
Oh swell the story all around, 
I'm Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
Down around the bloody Fourth, 
He's a 
Politician tart; 
And after Election day, 
To Congress he will start. 
I 
live upon 5th Avenue, 
Wear a 
Gold Ring on my toe; 
The speilers tells the Daisies, 
I'm Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
A Parody on Grandma's Old Arm Chair. 
Sang by FRANK LINvys 
at Comstock's Opera House, Columbus. 
My grandfather, he, at the age of eighty-three, 
One day he took a 
notion he would die; 
And after he was dead, of course the will was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all were passing by; 
Unto my brother Bill, he left an old saw mill, 
To my sister he bequeated our gray mare, Nance% 
But when it came to me, the lawyer then, said he 
Has left to you his old brown pants. 
CHORUS: 
But how they giggled, how they yelled, 
Even my sister, my dear Isabel; 
Gave me the laugh whene'er she had the chance, 
When grandpa only left to me his old brown pants. 
My brother Bill one day, just to pass the time away, 
In the river, why he thought he'd take a 
swim; 
When a 
stray goat showed his nose, and he eat up 
poor Bill's clothes, 
It was Summer, and his garments they were thin; 
Now Bill he kicked and swore, when he.eouldn't 
leave the shore, 
And I 
saw his situation at a 
glance; 
I 
give one laugh and yell, I 
said now brJtinr. Bill. 
Don't you wish you had the old brown pants. 
(Chorus).

German of great fame; Fritz McGinniss dots my 
name; 
I 
invented ice cream and doughnuts you can bet, 
Also Irish lager beer that makes you get off on your ear. 
If you take a 
bath I 
know that you'll get wet. 
I 
walked across the water with Jake Aberlee's big daughter, 
And anchored on the bottom for a 
week--; 
I 
walked seven miles in eighty-seven different styles, 
And at the Paris Exposition took the prize for cheek. 
CHORUS. 
My chest-protector I 
did break while whistling for the cake. 
I 
had corns and bunions growing on my ear. 
I 
wrote the Pinafore in 1864, 
And Julius Ctesar tried to give me the queer. 
I 
used to dance upon my nose sing also through my toes 
In Jerusalem when I 
discovered Israelites, 
I 
swallowed up a 
cafe, chewed the hinges of a 
safe, 
And danced a 
seven octave jig in iron tights. 
I 
was preserved in ink with Darwin's missing link 
That was behind a 
tea-store chromo on the wall, 
In the White House took the prize for telling political lies, 
And played poker with Romeo and Juliet for a 
ball, 
Also squeezing smoke from pure Havana coke, 
I 
discovered Coney Island in a 
gale 
When Moses used to preach to the sheenies on the beach 
I 
stabbed his sisters with my big toe-nail. 
Chorus. 
A serenade. 
Written by Imam DELMANING, and sung by " THE DELmAN.a.Ne." 
Oh, the moon is out to-night, 
Sweet Irene; 
And my heart beats with delight, 
Dear Irene; 
I 
am lingering by the well, 
And I've something sweet to tell, 
When we wander through the dell, 
Sweet Irene. 
CHORUS: 
Sweet Irene, (Symp.,) dear Irene, (Symp.), 
Gentiy whisper, tell me darling, thou art mine; 
Sweet Irene, (Symp.), dear Irene, (Symp.), 
Gently whisper, tell me dearest, thou art mine. 
Underneath the old oak tree, 
Sweet Irene; 
I 
have whispered love to thee, 
Dear Irene; 
I 
said, I'd be here at eight, 
Down by the garden gate, 
For your answer to await, 
Sweet Irene. 
I'd Like to be a 
Sunflower. 
Words and music by Edwin Talbot. 
Sung with great success by 
Fayette Welsh. 
I'd like to be a 
sunflower, 
If I 
might be a 
flower, 
My petals closing softly 
At twilight's quiet hour. 
And waking in the morning 
When falls the early dew, 
To welcome heaven's bright sunshine, 
And heaven's bright tear-drops too. 
CHORUS. 
(Chorus). 
I'd like to be a 
sunflower, 
If I 
might be a 
flower 
My petals closing softly 
At twilight's quiet hour. 
I 
love the gentle lily, 
It looks so meek and fair, 
But sunflowers I 
love better, 
For they grow every where, 
The lilies bloom so sadly 
in the sunshine or in shower, 
But sunflowers still look upward 
However dark the hour.

I've a 
neat litt le cabin that's built out of mud, 
Not far from the County Kildare; 
I've an acre or two where I 
grow my own spuds, 
I've enough and a 
little to spare; 
Sure I've not come over here seeking your jobs, 
But a 
short little visit to pay; 
SG 
be aisy and free while you're drinking with me, 
I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
I've a 
neat little colleen that dwells in my cot, 
Oh, happy, contented is she; 
I've a 
thumping big lad that will say to his dad, 
There's a 
man you don't meet every day; 
And when for my leisure I'm out for a 
walk, 
The boys they all stop and they stare; 
And they say to each other as I'm passing by, 
There's a 
man you don't meet every day.

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
As sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. The greatest and 
most popular song in New York. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing, 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth; 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list' and I'll give you an Irishman's toast. 
CHORIJS: 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds scent to warble this toast in the air. 
(Chorus). 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been replaced, 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host; 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot, 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze. 
(Chorus).

MURPHY, ANCHOR YER FEET. 
Wthten by Edwin Talbot, and sung by Murphy L% Mack 
Ari Irishman, as you can see, 
I'm known both far and wide. 
S:nce I've been in this country 
I 
have been the people's pride, 
When first I 
landed in New York 
It filled me with conceit, 
The kids say, " Murph, for digging turf, 
You have the real elegant feet. 
CHORUS— 
For the other day I 
heard them say 
That me nose looked like a 
beet, 
Then all the gang with vulgar slang. 
Roared, Murphy, anchor yer feet. 
My Delia Clancy, that's the girl I 
love, 
Sure I 
called on her the other night, 
And swore by all the clouds above. 
For there was none out that night, 
Says I, " My darling charming Delia, 
My heart is yours complete." 
Says she, " I 
won't have any funny business, 
Oh, Murphy, anchor yer feet." 
Chorus. 
Sure it's President they say I'd be, 
If it wasn't for this hullabaloo. 
If my head was only the size of my feet. 
And of course that's very true. 
You might know I'm a 
prominent man, 
For every one I 
meet as I 
stroll along, 
You'll hear the gang shout, " Holloa, 
Murphy, anchor yer feet."

Come to Casey's tin pan wedding, 
All the Irish will be there; 
Oh, such howling and such growling, 
And such cutting up so quare; 
All the Cork and Kerry people 
That resides in New York Town; 
Wearing high hats like a 
steeple, 
All the gang will sure be down. 
CEIORUS: 
All the Irish will be there, 
Bring -long your Bridget fair; 
Make her wear her Sunday hair, 
When in the set she's dancing; 
Won't there be a 
how-de-how, 
When the gang gets in a 
row; 
None but buffaloes will be there, 
At Casey's Tin Pan Wedding. 
There will be ale, stale beer and whisky, 
Goose chowder and cat pie; 
And when Casey he gets tipsy, 
He will slug Riley in the eye; 
Old Pat Shay and Tim Maloney, 
From the town of Donnegal; 
Danced a 
reel for stale bologna, 
On the top of Casey's wall.

And wherever I

You'll hear comments upon my shape, 
I'm the funniest tarrier out.

Where grows a

I 
went down to Goerck street 
To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
met there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
And the amusement of the party, 
Says I, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
CiroBus. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy. 
(Repeat.) 
We danced the polka " mazourka," 
Likewise the dizzy lanciers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy, sure I 
feel afraid 
That 
have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.) 
As I 
went home to Biddy's house 
A 
laughing, talking, chatting, 
1. met her father at the door 
All out of breath a 
panting. 
Says he, now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party, 
Oh, yes, you honor was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
am happy now, I 
have a 
cow, 
Likewise a 
pig and a 
daughter, 
I 
live in a 
cot in a 
shady spot 
Away across the water. 
My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar, 
Her husband as well is like a

But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy. ( Chorus.)

I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain; 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gi ay, 
Oh, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, eta. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
Oh the good old days,

Recited by PAT ROONEY with great success. 
McCormick had a 
Jack-ass, 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye; 
He had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
lie won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule. 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
lie wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes; 
lie broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mule. 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
He slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
He was just getting ten years' sentence, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died. 
McCormick's Mule. 
Moral on his Grave-Stone. 
Judge me as a 
Jack-ass, 
Or judge me as a 
fool; 
I 
was smarter than some politicians, 
That went to Grammar School: 
I 
had the brains of a 
mighty man, 
But for one I 
could not pass; 
So please have printed on my grave, 
McCormick's little Jack-ass.

Oh, come, my darling, 'tis just the hour, 
When moonbeams dance o'er all the happy earth and sea: 
We, too, will dance, my dove, while star beams gleam, my 
love, 
Oh, scorn not moments made for love and thee. 
Then kiss me, darling, and say you love me, 
And arm in arm together we will glide along; 
Sweet music sounding, light hearts are bounding, 
While merrily I 
sing your song. 
Sweet, my own, oh, come into my arms, 
here alone, secure from ev'ry harm; 
Not a 
care, free as air, 
Come, my love, and gaily dance around. 
Come, kiss me, darling—I 
know what love is: 
Two pretty little arms that 'round my neck entwine, 
Two ruby lips, my love, that warmly kiss, my love; 
Two pretty eyes of azure blue like thine. 
Then kiss me, darling, and say you love me, 
And arm in arm together we will glide along; 
Sweet music sounding, light hearts are bounding, 
While merrily I 
sing your song. 
Sweet, my own, oh, come into my arms,

THAT'S MORE THAN I

And hope I 
won't offend; 
I 
shoot at Folly on the wing, 
Though all mankind' my friend; 
The darling girls, the pretty dears, 
In ulsters cut a 
swell; 
how' long before their chins 
ill sprout, 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
CHORUS: 
That's more than I

How long before they'll pant for pants, 
That's more than I

I 
know a 
widow, nice and sweet, 
And so bewitching, too; 
I 
breathed my passion at her feet, 
And swore may love was true; 
But widows. they are dreadful sly, 
And oft turn out a 
sell; 
Who kissed those lips when I 
vamoosed? 
That's more than I 
can tell! 
Cnonus: 
That's more than I

31v neighbor has a 
pretty wife, 
The parson visits there; 
I 
can't see why, upon my life. 
Each day, through foul or fair; 
If duty calls him to her side,

Or comfort to her soul be brings, 
That's more than 1 
can tell. 
TAIAT'S MORE THAN I

CHORUS:

And people flock to hear; 
That many think he's very sound 
Upon the goose ' tis clear; 
Now if he takes the skyward road

Will Talmage shake his hand up there? 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
CHORUS: 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
Will each of them have wings to flop? 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
The preachers now are up in arms, 
To shut the playhouse doors; 
They preach about the awful harms, 
That wicked actors cause; 
Though black sheep dwell in every flock, 
How many parsons swell 
The ranks of scandal every year? 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
CHORUS: 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
That's mar a

Why don't they let the actors rest? 
That's more than I

Oh! It's Awfully Wrong To Be Poor. 
As sung by America's own Vocalist, TONY PASTOR, with great 
success. 
His latest hit. 
I 
am a 
dreadful character, in vice I 
go the pace, 
I'll give a 
start to any man, and win an easy race; 
I've galloped helter-skelter through the catalogue of 
crimes, 
Committed theft and perjury at least a 
dozen times; 
I've had my fling at forgery, at felony and fraud, 
And when I 
go marauding, you can bet I 
do maraud ; 
But I 
never condescended, though of crime I've made 
a 
tour, 
To the greatest crime in Christendom—the crime of 
being poor. 
CHORUS: 
And that's how I 
keep from detection, 
If you give it a 
moment's reflection 
You all will agree 
In this precept with me, 
That it's awfully wrong to be poor; 
For the rich oft may sin, 
While the poor get run in, 
Ohl it's awfull wrong to be poor. 
I've been a 
bank director, and the bank it went to 
smash, 
For we played at speculation with a 
lo f 
of poor folk's 
cash; 
I've got up little swindles in the shape of silver mines, 
And sold the juice of cabbage stalks as port and sherry 
wines; 
OH ! 
IT'S AWFULLY WRONG TO BE POOR. 
(CONTINUED). 
I've manufactured butter out of 
fat, 
But I 
go to church on Sundays, 
my hat; 
My balance at my bankers makes 
sure. 
The safest sort of roguery is to rob 
CHORUS: 
railway grease and 
and I 
always smell 
my dodges safe and 
and cheat the poor. 
And that's how I 
keep from detection, 
If you give it a 
moment's reflection 
You all will agree 
In this precept with me, 
That it's safest to swindle the poor; 
For the rich make a 
row, 
But the poor folks we cow, 
So it's safest to swindle the poor. 
If my little game were murder, still I'd keep my maw-
leys clean, 
I 
could bribe my poorer brothers—monarchs do the 
same, I 
ween ; 
When their neighbor's land kings covet, what's about 
the price they pay? 
Don't they send men out to rob him at a 
bob a 
head a 
day? 
Bother guilt upon your conscience, if you've gold 
inside your purse, 
You can be as bad as I 
am, and, in fact, a 
little worse; 
Wealth can make the wicked honored, and give beauty 
to the boor, 
But you mustn't be a 
villain if you happen to be poor. 
And that's how I 
keep, etc. 
WHIST! WHIST 
Such a 
lot of dizzy fairies every day you'll meet, 
Forty-five cent switches on their heads, no stockings 
on their feet; 
Living on free lunches and clam chowder, 
Their cheeks and faces disfigured with common paint 
and powder. 
CHORUS: 
You're a 
brick, whist, whist, 
You make me sick, whist, whist, 
Oh, pull up your skirts and run around the 
park; 
Give him a 
brace, whist, whist, 
Poison face, whist, whist, 
Is what those dizzy maidens all remark. 
While seated with a 
fairy and enjoying the breeze, 
Of the kidney stew and liver and limburger cheese, 
When in a 
bruiser came and said, young fellow, this 
looks queer, 
If you don't let my girl alone, I'll bite your ear. 
CHORUS: 
Up I 
got, whist, whist, 
Away I 
shot, whist, whist, 
And they sat down at the table with a 
whist, 
whist, whist; 
So if you're flip, whist, whist, 
Always skip, whist, whist, 
When a 
bruiser comes to claim his girl, get 
up and get. 
THE $5 
NOTE. 
A. Comic Song sung by FRANK LEWIS, Esq., with tremendous success 
everywhere through the country. 
Written by FRED SHAW. 
One night as I 
was out with the boys to have a 
spree, 
Thro' drinking whisky punches, I 
was drunk as I 
could be; 
My cash it quickly flew, I 
very soon was broke, 
-So I 
borrowed from a 
friend a $5 
note. 
Cuottus: 
If you listen to my sor.g, while the funny things I'll quote, 
tell you how I 
spent that e5 note. 
As soon as I 
was fixed, I 
asked the boys to have a 
bowl, 
Which into my note made a 
very big hole; 
We had a 
round of punches,- and then cigars to boot, 
Up went the first dollar of the $5 
note. 
The boys feeling hungry after drinking so much punch, 
We walked around the corner and we had a 
little lunch; 
They tackled oyster stews ' till I 
thought the boys would 
chokg, 
And they soon Cat up a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we went to the Theatre to see the ladies prance, 
And to bear the comic songs, and the funny song and dance; 
One of the girls says I 
feel thirsty, and brandy would suit 
my throat, 
And she soon drank a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we walked around the town called in a 
saloon or two, 
Then we went to see the ladies as the young men often do; 
One said she loved me, with her arms around my throat, 
And she soon got a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then as I 
was going home, just as drunk as I 
could be, 
A poor laboring man came slowly up to me; 
His family they were starving, and ragged was his coat, 
And he got the last dollar of the $5 
note.

With those dear arms about me, 
Ah! no, I

When you can live without me. 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me. 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rims 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
Ah ! no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day what.Lll 
forget me.

For to walk a. mile an hour, 
About half past twelve o'clock last nigh 
A

They woke me up and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took me to a 
great big field, 
And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped me clothes off to the skin, 
And it made me feel so lazy; 
It was then the gang commenced to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk, 
And they said they would hang me if I'd bank 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They sprinkled salt upon the track 
And hit me with an iron dollar. 
All the other walkers were ahoad, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread, 
0 
heavens, I 
wish that I 
was dead, 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
eatched the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
There was a 
corn upon my back; 
The judge told me it was tine to stop 
As around the track like a 
chicken I'd flop, 
For the want of a 
whiskey I 
though I'd drop, 
The day I 
walicimi afignst O'Leary.

'Twas early in the month of May, 
I 
said to my girl Lou ; 
As I 
am going far away, 
. 
I'm going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea, 
She bowed her lovely head. 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And I 
to her then said, 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good. bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
GO6d-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea and.1 will thin'- of you. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought ; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now Lou don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
I've one thing, Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I 
am going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
" 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, &c. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore, 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
That she had gone away; 
So now, as Lou has proved untrue, 
Why I 
can only say— 
Good-bye, &c.

Oho here we are two Irish Traveling Tinkers, 
We are in for fun though we're not heavy drinkergi 
We are hardy, stout and strong and tough as clinkers, 
We came from Tipperary, that's our home. 
If there's any pots or kettles that wants mending, 
Wc hope that for us you will be sending, 
Ilave no fear but what good work we will be rendering, 
We're the Irish traveling tinkers, ha, ha, ha. 
Bang! Bang! the whole day long. 
While at work we sing our song, 
The neighbors wants us moved away, Bang! Bang! 
But no attention we do pay, 
To what the neighbors have to say, 
We will pelt away and work all day, 
We are the Irish Traveling Tinkers. 
If in to a

We never make a

For fear the neighbors we would arise, 
For we are a

And our little Irish girls we're going to meet, 
And it will be ten to one that we will get beat 
Out of pots and kettles that's to mend.

JOLLY GOOD LUCIt TO ALL. 
Sang by NED BARRY at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre Comique. 
Music published at E. H. HARDINGS, 229 Bowery. 
If I 
had the power a 
gift to bestow, 
On the friends that around me I 
see, 
I'd give them the very best gift that I 
know, 
The gift that they lucky should be; 
For no matter how clever, how foolish, how wise, 
No matter how great, or how small; 
By luck more than merit, we fall or we rise, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
CHORUS: 
Here's jolly good luck to us all, my friends, 
The best of good luck to us all; 
For by luck more than merit, we rise or we fall, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
One man may be gifted with talents divine, 
But may still in obscurity live; 
While shallower mortals successfully shine, 
And take all the world has to give; 
Qne waits on in vain, for good fortune's caress, 
While the other some chance may befall; 
Which used to advantage results in success, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. (Chorus). 
So, up and be doing, deserving good luck, 
And good fortune may favor the brave; 
For some of life's prizes are won by sheer pluck, 
And are lost by the indolent slave; 
There is always one chance in the life of a 
man, 
Which, if lost, he can never recall; 
So work for it, watch for it, hope if you can, 
That there's jolly good luck for us all. (Chorus).

In our back yard there lives two bums, 
They can dance upon their gums; 
They never had no thumbs, 
And with Ben Butler they were chums. 
Cnonus: 
Oh, they are crazy and lazy, 
Garfield and Hazey; 
They are gentlemen of rank, 
Cage them up in some big tank, 
And we'll let them rob some bank, 
Then bite off their nose. 
In our back alley lives a 
cat, 
And her maiden name is Pat; 
She could sleep in an old hat, 
And in a 
butcher's she eats fat. 
In our back alley lives a 
guy, 
And he never told a 
lie; 
He is not afraid to die, 
And he makes his living stealing pie. 
Chorus.

They ain't pleasing, they are teasing, 
Like lemons they need squeezing, 
He's got warts upon his nose, 
He never wore no clothes, 
He never sleeps, he'd always doze, 
And wash himself in soup. 
Papa's Chest Protector's Faded. 
Written by DAN COLLYER, and sung with great success. 
Papa's chest protector's faded, - 
Lost the color on his chest; 
Faded now for once and ever, 
From the sweat caused by his vest; 
Oh, the many years he's worn it, 
Never has it seen a 
change; 
How our bull-pup slept upon it, 
And from it he's caught the mange. 
CHORUS: 
Papa, papa, darling papa, 
Don't spread your mug at me with wrath; 
For its true that you've grown lighter, 
Since you took that Turkish bath. 
Think of when you had the jim-jams, 
How I 
never left your bed; 
How I 
hired Tom Jones, the Cooper, 
To put a 
hoop around your head; 
Oh, my gall, how you do flutter, 
For, of chest protectors, when I 
think 
How you've oft protected papa, 
When he's braced men for a 
drink. 
CHORUS: 
Pap, you darling, old brace, papa, 
At hoisting schooners you're the boss; 
But your nose is growing briahter, 
Since you've been budging at O'Rourkes.

SHE'S UP AT MACY'S. 
 :0:  
As sung by America's own Vocalist, TONY PASTOR. 
 • 
0 :  
Her name is Flora, and I 
adore her, 
If you could see her so would you; 
She's up at Macy's—you all know Macy's— 
Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue. 
She handles lace with such a 
grace, 
has a 
face like angel fair; 
She is so charming, ' tis quite alarming, 
The way the fellows at her stare. 
CHORUS: 
I 
am her cavalier, I 
am her pretty dear, 
She loves me fondly with a 
heart so true; 
I 
take her to the car, I'm solid with her ma, 
She's up at Macy's Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue. 
She's so congenial, there's nothing menial, 
She finds a 
kindred spirit here; 
I 
find the yardstick a 
very hard stick— 
Instead of wine I 
must drink beer. 
I'm on Broadway for little pay, 
And on the ladies wait all day; 
With joy I'm greeted, when I 
am seated, 
My heart to Flora flies away. 
(Chorus). 
51 
SHE'S UP AT MACY'S— CosTisuEn. 
In fancy dances. with sister Frances, 
She Elides  as graceful as a 
fawn; 
They all admire her her, they all desire her, 
But she is mine from dusk till dawn. 
She lives on pie, she makes Inc sigh, 
Whenever we go out to dine; 
But I 
adore her, my pretty Flora, 
To me she seems a 
girl divine. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, my sweetheart is up at 
Macy's Four-
teenth Street, Sixth Avenue. 
I'm in the same business 
myself, but not at Macy's; they're all girls up there—they 
wouldn't have such a 
thing as a 
man around. 
Flora is 
such a 
sweet girl. 
She used to go round a 
great deal, but 
now we are more settled down; there was a 
time I 
used to 
think nothing of going out and spending two dollars all by 
myself in one night, just for beer. 
We used to go to Coney 
Island very often. 
I 
remember one day Flora got so sick 
on the boat I 
didn't know what to do. ' Oh," she cried, 
" 
I 
want a 
seuze of a 
lemon, just one scuze." 
But lemons 
were ten cents apiece. 
She recovered, however, and the 
next day you could hear her sweet voice up at Macy's call 
ing, " Cash here! 
Cash here! 
Cash! 
Cash!" 
Cnonus: 
She wears a 
circular, all made of silk and fur, 
And on her hat a 
bunch of violets blue; 
She smokes a 
cigarette, she sings me " Olivette," 
She's up at Macy's, Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue.

In the old home by the hillside 
The days were full of glee, 
There were kind and loving faces, 
At night to welcome me; 
The birds they sang to cheer me, 
I 
knew no care or woe, 
I 
was happy and contented, 
In the old home long ago. 
CHORUS. 
My heart was light and gay, 
And happy was each day, 
In the dear old home far away; 
I 
never can forget, 
No matter where I 
stray, 
My home by the hillside far away. 
In the old home by the hillside 
I 
used to laugh and play, 
And I 
never thought of sorrow 
Till the old folks pass'd away; 
Then I 
was left to wander 
In loneliness and pain; 
Oh my heart is ever praying, 
"May I 
see that home again." 
I‘ly heart was light, Sze. 
THE SPORTING MAN. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT expressly for JAMES O'NEIL, of O'NEIL 
& CONROY, Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch Artists. 
I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
often make a 
bet, 
I 
stand a 
chance of loosing, but I 
have not' done it yet; 
I'm something of a 
wrestler, I 
often take it in, 
But when I 
take a 
thoroughbred, my chances are but slim; 
A 
little bit of pleasantry- occurred the other night, 
I 
went to see a 
wrestling match which ended in a 
fight; 
A Dutchman, a 
Scotchman, a 
Frenchman and a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Reilly got plugged with a 
brick. 
Cuoitus: 
Nobody knows what trouble was there, 
Nobody knows I 
do declare; 
Nobody knows what fun I 
did see; 
Nobody knows indeed but me. 
Now the cause of all the trouble I 
couldn't keep it mum, 
Some one called Jerry McIntyre a 
bum; 
Jerry :jumped up, struck out with his hand, 
And swore he could whip any cripple in the land; 
Big John Monahan standing in the door, 
lie caught hold of McIntyre, and threw him on the floor; 
lie went for little Brady, and hit him such a 
whack, 
That he busted his undershirt plum off of his back. 
Oh when Brady he got up, he was a 
terrible looking sight, 
lie looked as if he slept with the pigs all night; 
lie looked at his undershirt and then he dropped a 
tear, 
And then he flew for Monahan and chewed off his ear; 
lie made one brace and landed at the bar, 
Ile called for a 
hummer, and they gave him a 
cigar; 
lie took a 
match to light it, and what do you suppose, 
It was chock full of powder, and it blew off his nose. 
Then they fought in the hallway, they fought in a 
room, 
And the things they used for boxing gloves was the bat 
room spittoons; 
They couldn't see each other they welted so hard, 
They set fire to the house and fought out in the yard. 
The police all came down in big platoons, 
And quick gathered up every fighting gossoon; 
Six months on the Island sure they all have to stay, 
For setting fire to the house on St. Patrick's Day. 
ONLY A 
FACE AT THE WINDOW. 
ks sung by W. H HAMILTON, the Premier Baritone, at the SAN FRAN-
CISCO MINSTRELS 
Only a 
face at the window, 
Only a 
face, nothing more; 
Yet the look in the eyes as they meet mine, 
Still comes to me o'er and o'er 
Only a 
word of greeting, 
Only a 
word, that was all; 
Yet all day in my heart it eeho'd 
Like the sound of an angel's call. 
Only a 
smile of welcome, 
Only a 
smile as I 
passed, 
Yet that smile will still be remembered 
As long as my life shall last. 
Only a 
woman, you tell me, 
Only a 
woman to thee, 
rah 
Yet there's naught that this wide world contain 
half so dear as this woman to me.

DONNELLY AND COOPER. 
Written by Dick Devlin and sung by Devlin and Tracy 
Come all you true-bred Irishmen, I 
hope you will draw 
near, 
And likewise pay attention to those few lines you hear; 
It's of as true a 
story as ever you did hear, 
lt's about Donnelly and Cooper, that fought all on Kildare. 
'Twas on the 3d of June, brave boys this challenge sent 
o'er. 
From Brittania to old Grauna to renew her sons once more; 
To renew her satisfaction, and her credit to recall, 
For they're all in deep distraction since Donnelly con-
quered all. 
Old Grauna read .the challenge and received and she 
smiled, 
Saying; " You'd better hasten to Kildare, my well beloved 
child, 
There you will reign victorious, which you often did before. 
And your deeds will shine so gloriously around old Erin's 
shore. -
The challenge was accepted; these heroes did prepare 
To meet brave Captain Kelly on the Curragh of Kildare; 
When these two bully champions were stripped off in the 
ring, 
They both were still determined on each other's blood to 
spill. 
59 
DONNELLY AND COOPER.— Continued. 
From 6 
to 9, parried their time, till Donnelly knocked him 
down, 
Old Grauna smiled : " Well done, my child ; that is ten 
thousand pound !" 
The second round that Cooper fought, he knocked down 
Donnelly, 
Likewise true game was Donnelly, he rose most furiously. 
Right active then was Cooper—he knocked Donnelly 
down again; 
Those Englishmen then gave three cheers, saying. " The 
battle's all in vain." 
Long life to brave Miss Kelly; she's recorded on the plain ; 
She boldly stepped into the ring, saying: " Dan, my boy, 
what do you mane ? 
"My Irish boy," said she, " my whole estate I 
have bet 
out on you, brave Donnelly." 
Donnelly rose again, and meeting with great might, 
And to stagnate those nobles all, continued to his fight, 
Cooper stood in his own defence; exertion proved in vain, 
He soon received a 
temple blow that knocked him on the 
plain. 
Now you sons of proud Brittania, your boasting now recall. 
Since Cooper, now, by Donnelly, he met a 
sad downfall, 
Out of eleven rounds gave nine knock-downs and broke 
his jaw-bone ; 
"‘Shake hands," said she. -brave Donnelly, the battle's all 
our own."

Last night I 
was dreaming of you, 
And bright happy moments gone by, 
We trod the old paths that we knew, 
Ere absence had caused us to sigh. 
Kind friends and companions were near,

And joyous each spirit did seem— 
Oh vision return once again, 
Or quickly fulfilled be the dream.

Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordex 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DUTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear, 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed' 
with the book will make anybody at . home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
