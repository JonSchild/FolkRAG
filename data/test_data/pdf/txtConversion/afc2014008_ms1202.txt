Aloha K kou
 
On behalf of the working men and women of  the
 
Plumbers and Fitters United Association Local Union 675,
 
I am pleased to present this educational booklet,
 
"No N5 Mamo: Voyage of Education."
 
We encourage you to challenge your navigational
 
skills as the Hokule'a travels home across the grand
 
Pacific Ocean.
 
Similar to the navigators of the Hokule'a,
 
skilled members of the Plumbers and Fitters Union are
 
trained to ensure safety and excellent health conditions
 
throughout Hawaii.
 
Education is the key to success in any field.
 
Over the years,  the Plumbers and Fitters Union,  chartered
 
in 1919,  has devoted millions of dollars and countless
 
hours to perpetuate our skilled trade within our
 
membership.
 
As part of the renaissance of the Hawaiian
 
culture,  we applaud the dedication of the Hokule'a crew
 
and their will to perpetuate our ancestors'  navigational
 
skills through this "Voyage of Education."
 
We join the many supporters of Hokule'a in
 
wishing the crew a safe  return home.
