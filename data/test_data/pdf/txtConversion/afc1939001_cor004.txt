Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I wish to make several trips from here over to the Rio Grande country in So uthwest,
Texas, about 150 miles away , probably following the River up as far as El Paso.
Later, when the weather is not so uncertain, I have in mind several places in Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and South Carolina where Folk Songs abound. A trip to
these places would bring me over a 2 serpentine route to Washington.

You once mentioned that you had some places to suggest. Where? I'd like to go there
also.
I can begin to use the machine as soon as you can get it down. Be sure that it is in first
class repair. Radio experts are scarce in these parts.
I sympathize with you deeply in the loss of your mother.
Sincerely always, John A. Lomax
