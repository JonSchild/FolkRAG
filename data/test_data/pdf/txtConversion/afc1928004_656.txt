LOVE OF THE SHAMROCK. 
Written and composed and permission for publication granted by 
Mr. J. K. EMMET. Sung with great success by J. K. 
EMMET. 
Three little leaves of Irish green, 
United on one stem, 
On Irish Soil are often seen— 
They form a 
magic gem. 
One leaf is truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love, 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dewdrops from above. 
CHORtis: 
Ohl the shamrock, the shamrock, 
The shamrock immortal and green, 
By every nook and every brook 
Grows shamrock so green. 
Ohl do you love, oh! say you love 
The shamrock, emblem of love, 
Oh! say you love the shamrock so green. 
When Irish soil received the plant 
The Elfin kings can tell; 
Love, Truth and Valor wandered there, 
And liked the soil so well. 
Each left an emblem in a 
leaf, 
And these together grew, 
Sustained by heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew. 
To thee I 
give the triple leaf, 
As emblem of my love; 
I 
only hope the modest gift 
May not unwelcome prove. 
A 
flower of more pretensions 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
have in thee, 
Thou shamrock of the dell,

EMMET'S CASTLE BELLS. 
Written by J. K. EMMET, and sung by him in " FRITZ IN IRELM(1)." 
Published by kind permission of Mr. J. K. 
EMMET. 
The castle clock has tolled the hour, 
The last faint gleam of parting day 
Still lights the hills and gilds the tower, 
Ere night let falls her mantle gray. 
CHORUS. 
Softly, slowly, sweetly, 
The bells are ringing 
Over the forest and lea; 
Softly, slowly, sweetly, 
Glad tones are flinging 
Far o'er the slumbering sea. 
The castle clock has tolled the hour, 
The birds fly homeward to their nest, 
And night comes on with magic power 
Hushing the world to dreamy rest. (Chorus) 
The castle clock has tolled the hour, 
And soon again morn's rosy beam, 
Will fall on tree and dew-kissed flower, 
Waking the wood, and mount, and stream. 
(chorus).

Oh, hear him calling now! 
Cuckool cuckoo! 
I 
hear you call, I 
hear you call 
Hear the cuckoo call, 
. Oh, hear him calling now! 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray, 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
Soft lilies and the rose 
Wave in the valleys green; 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost love, 
While beautiful shamrock grows. 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray, 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
The blue birds do sing with a 
merry trill; 
Their glad notes sound clear thro' the green woodlarm 
bowers, 
But the cuckoo's call is so sad and still, 
It comes in the twilight's lone hours. 
Soft lilies and the roses 
Wave in the valleys green; 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost love, 
While beautiful shamrock grows. 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I. hear him far up in the ruins so gray, 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May.

In after years when you recall 
The days of pleasure past, 
And think of joyous hours that all 
Have flown away too fast; 
If some forgotten air you hear, 
Bring back past scenes to thee. 
And sadly charms thy list'ning car, 
Keep one kind thought for me. 
In fairer scenes 'midst brighter skies, 
Perchance you still may roam; 
Then your fond heart may warmly prize, 
The dear old friends at home; 
And mid thy pleasures should a 
sigh 
Unheeded fall from thee; 
l'Ptile the bright tear-drop seals thine eyrze, 
Keep one kind thought for me

ERIN'S EMBLEMS. 
Written and Composed by W. H DELEHANTT. 
I wear two lovely emblems, 
United on my breast, 
The honored " Harp of Erin," 
That land I 
love the best. 
A 
darling treasured " Shamrock," 
So modest to be seen. 
That Harp that shines with glory, 
The Shamrock so fair and green. 
CHORUS. 
My blessings on those emblem 
Of Erin across the sea. 
May they adorn the banners 
Proclaiming Ireland free. 
The reason why I 
wear them, 
So closely to my heart, 
Those gems of priceless treasure, 
United never to part, 
Because that little Shamrock, 
Was fair and pure to see, 
The Harp was like the utterings, 
Of mother love to me. 
My blessing on those, etc. 
My mother wrought that gold harp, 
With tresses of her hair; 
Green threads of father's jacket, 
Did make a 
Shamrock fair. 
My father kissed and blessed me 
Before I 
crossed the sea, 
And bade me wear those emblems, 
"For mother dear and me."

EMMET'S NO MORE. 
By HARRY OSBORNE. 
Sung with great success by FANNY 
W ENTWORTH. 
AIR: Exile of Erin. 
Despair in her wild eye, a 
daughter of Erin 
Appeared on the chit of a 
bleak rocky shore, 
Loose in th wind flowed her dark streaming ringlets, 
As heedless she gazed on the dread surges' roar. 
Loud rang her harp in wild tones so despairing, 
The tune passed away with the present comparing, 
And in soul-thrilling strains deeper sorrow declaring, 
She sang Erin's wrongs, or my Emmet's no more. 
Oh Erin, my country, thy glory's departed, 
For tyrant's and traitors have stabbed thy heart's core, 
Thy daughter's now leave in the streams of affliction, 
Thy patriots are fled or lie stretched in their gore. 
Ruthless ruffians now prowl in thy hamlets forsaken, 
And from pale hungry orphans their moisel have taken, 
Yet the screams of thy females no pity awaken, 
Alas, my poor country, thy Emmet's no more. 
Brave was his spirit, yet mild as the brahmin, 
His heart bled in anguish at the wrongs of the poor, 
To relieve their haad sufferings he braved every danger, 
The vengeance of tyrants undauntedly bore. 
Even before him the proud titled villains in power 
Were seen, though in ermine, in terror to cower, 
But alas he is gone, he has fallen a 
young flower, 
They have murdered my Emmet, my Emmet's no nuve 
Adir , 
Erin's Isle.

PAT ROONEY'S 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by B. 
HART. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
Ilere I 
am, an Irish lad, that you can plainly see, 
I've traveled this world o'er and o'er, till I 
got to this land 
of the free. 
From Dublin Bay I 
came away, I 
never fret or sigh, 
For I'm always gay, both night and day, this son of Erin's Isl. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I 
am an Irish ranting blade, and that I 
never deny, 
And I'll give you all a 
chance for to see the way I 
dance, 
As they do in Erin's Isle. (Repeat.) 
The other day I 
went astray, I 
never shall forget, 
When a 
pretty little Irish girl oh I 
by chance had met. 
She showed me home, that I 
will own, and this was her reply: 
" 
You I 
do adore, and there is something more, you're a 
son 
of Erin's Isle." 
Yes, I 
am, &c. 
For to return home once more my mind is fully bent, 
And when I 
arrive on the shamrock shore, won't there be a 
grand event. 
My friends and my relations will greet me with all smiles, 
To welcome home one of their own, a 
son of Erin's Isle. 
Yes, I 
am, &c.

"WHICH OF THE TWO?" 
Written by JERRY CORAN for JOE BURGESS. 
Motto Singer. 
" 
Which of the two, the rich or the poor, 
Will win in this race of life? 
When fortune leaves wealth at one man's door, 
At his neighbor's bestows toil and strife; 
Yet contentment may be the rich fruit of the toil, 
While the wealth yield but grief and dismay; 
And the bubble of riches we strive so to gain, 
May be gone in a 
single day! 
There are two pathways open for all men to tread, 
By the crooked and straight we must go; 
Choose early, choose right, ere your chances are dead, 
Choose carefully which of the two?" 
The beggar was sitting one day in the street, 
The day our Redeemer was born; 
Merry Christmas bells ringing, he'd nothing to eat 
For his family since yesterday morn; 
A woman of sin, passing, emptied her purse, 
Dropped her vail to hide sympathy's tear; 
The next woman, a 
rich lady, passed into church, 
Looking scorn on the miserable pair. 
I 
could not help thinking how our Savior had died, 
To transform sinful sons bright and new; 
The Gilded and real stood exposed to me then, 
" 
Great Lord," I 
cried, " which of the two?" 
THE WATERMILL 
As recited by Gus `SVILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And ..,he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, whi a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
IsTever does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last--
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh I 
the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Ohl the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill win never grind with the water that is past

THE WHITEWASH MAN. 
Written, Composed and Sung by DAN Com.YER, at Tony Pastor's 
Theatre. A very popular song. 
Copyrighted, 1881, by A. J. FISHER. 
I'm a 
retired old whitewasher, 
And I've saved a 
little cash; 
When I 
was a 
little younger, 
I 
used to cut a 
dash; 
But now I 
am much wiser, 
I 
don't possess a 
care; 
So come and spend an evening, boys, 
At my house around the square. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, although I 
look rather old, I 
feel very 
young. 
My milk of human kindness has not turned into 
cheese yet. 
Oh, dear, no! I 
am very fond of society, too; 
I 
invite you all around to my house in the square, but— 
Chorus—Mind you come, diddle dum, 
Oh to my, diddle dum, 
Little house, diddle dum, 
If it's fair, diddle dum, 
You shall have, diddle dum, 
Oh, such nice, diddle dum, 
At my house around the corner 
In the square. 
Once I 
was a 
gay young fellow, 
I 
was fond of seeing life; 
But now I'm old and mellow, 
I 
should like to take a 
wife; 
I'm not like young men of the day, 
Who often do engage; 
To snare and catch a 
pretty bird, 
Before they've bought the cage. 
SPOKEN.—Whenever I 
do my courting, I 
do it in the 
good, old-fashioned style; not like the young men now-a-
days—falling in love in ten minutes, and wanting to get 
married in a 
quarter of an hour. 
Ha! ha! ha! ha! 
Now, 
I've got a 
very nice little cage, and should there be any 
pretty little birds here to-night that would like to come and 
see it, they are quite welcome, but— (Chorus).

success. 
A 
IR.—Slavery Days, 
FATHER. 
DEAR isle of fame and beauty, thy shores have long been trod 
With savage tyrants' footsteps! 
Oh, 'tis sad! 
Thy faithful sons, dear Erin, are banished from thy sod, 
Their homes destroyed, they are dispossessed of all ! 
We leave the dear old cottage that once we called our own; 
The cursed intruders' minds are satisfied! 
They have caused the young to exile and the old to be forloin 
On the roadside here we lay our heads to die! 
{Daughter discovers old man at work.] 
DAUGHTER. 
Oh, father, dearest father, you are growing old, I 
see, 
You cannot do that work there all alone, 
And when I 
marry Teddy, oh, father, lie will he 
A 
great help on the farm and in our home. 
His heart is stout and bold, the cares of life will not wear 
A 
haggard look upon my darling Ted. 
Can I 
be his wife now, father ? for to me he is so fair; 
Your refusal, father dear, I 
almost dread! 
FATHER. 
Oh, Norah, with a 
blessing I 
hope the sunshine's rays 
May ever shine upon you and your Ted; 
I 
hope you'll thrive and prosper like the blooming flowers in 
May; 
You'll remember this, my blessing, when I'm dead. 
Go tell the news to Teddy, that your father gave consent, 
And tell him that he is free to name the day; 
But let him seek another land, for he cannot earn the relit 1 
Sure, he'll find a 
home in dear America.

In our back yard there lives two bums, 
They can dance upon their gums; 
They never had no thumbs, 
And with Ben Butler they were chums. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, they are crazy and lazy, 
Garfield and Hazey; 
They are gentlemen of rank, 
Cage them up in some big tank, 
And we'll let them rob some bank, 
Then bite off their nose. 
In our back alley lives a 
cat, 
And her maiden name is Pat; 
She could sleep in an old hat, 
And in a 
butcher's she eats fat. 
In our back alley lives a 
guy, 
And he never told a 
lie; 
lie is not afraid to die, 
And he makes his living stealing pie.

My name is Tommy Dingelspiel, 
The reason I'll tell you; 
Once I

And have a

But now my father is gone bust, 
His business does not pay, 
And for to keep us all alive, 
My father has to say— 
CHORUS, 
Tommy take this to your uncle, 
There's a 
little dear, 
Tommy take this to your uncle, 
I 
want to get some beer. 
You know your fader's out of work, 
And the rent to- day is due; 
So run ' round the block, and put this in hock, 
Take that to your uncle, do. 
My father's clothes they're all gone up, 
Also his boots and hat; 
The tables, chairs and crockery wares, 
Also the dog and cat. 
The bed and bedstead is " gone up," 
And we sleep on the floor, 
There's only one or two things left. 
Then we'll be out of doors.

Buttercups and Daisies. 
Recited by D AISY REMINGTON. 
When a 
little boy I 
wandered, ' twas a 
pleasant summer's 
day, 
My heart was like a 
feather, as I 
journeyed on my way; 
To my eager footsteps soft the green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tiny maid. 
Playing I 
was poor man, playing she was rich, 
How her merry laughter reached the highest pitch; 
Pointing to the daisies' silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered—these, she said, were gold. 
With the time departing, soon the air was chilled, 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin thrilled; 
Once again I 
wandered, with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden, vast in wealth arrayed. 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
Had been there before us and taken all our gain ; 
With his icy fingers, and a 
grasp so cold, 
Stole our silver daisies and buttercups of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot; 
For there was a 
lesson in our strange belief— 
Summer was our banker, winter was our thief. 
So it is with friends, then, sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine, but leave us in the fall ; 
When a 
warm friend slights me, or he treats me cold, 
I 
think of silver daisies and buttercups of gold.

THE JOLLY OLD SAILOR. 
Written by JOHN W ALSH, and dedicated to and sung by NED BAHRX 
at the Theatre, Comique, N. Y. 
What curious people we meet 
As through this world we go; 
Some are full of deceit, 
While others honesty show; 
Some on mischief are bent, 
If you far from it will roam; 
And others like to interfere, 
With business that's not their own. 
Some will swear that white is blflek, 
And green is no color at all; 
And others seem to take delight 
In watching another man fall; 
But when inquisitive people 
Wish to know anything from me; 
I 
tell them to ask the sailor, 
For the sailor has been to sea. 
CHORUS: 
For the jolly, old sailor, has been to sea, 
Where the stormy winds do blow; 
And as the sailor has been to sea, 
He's the man that ought to know. 
Old Brigham Young he is dead, 
In picture shape they show 
A 
comical sketch of his bed, 
And his forty wives also; 
THE JOLLY OLD SAILOR—CONTINUED. 
With sixty babes in the front, 
his breeches you'll see hanging there; 
Now there's a 
chance for young girls, 
Who would like the breeches to wear. 
Just fancy having forty wives, 
To please and amuse every one; 
They tell me Brigham did it, 
But it's wonderful how it was done; 
For I 
have one, and upon my word, 
She's more than enough for me; 
And one's a 
dose, I've heard it said, 
By the sailor that's been to sea. (Chorus). 
There's Smikes just over the way, 
He gets so awfully wild; 
And grumbles all the day, 
Because he's not blessed with a 
child; 
Whilst Smith can boast twenty-four, 
And looks with a 
doleful phiz; 
And says that Smikes should be compelled, 
To keep a 
few of his kids. 
Now when they meet, it's quite a 
treat, 
It causes a 
deal of fun; 
For the one that's got no children, 
Asks the other one how it is done; 
One says this, and the other says that, 
But when they refer to me, 
I 
tell them to ask the sailor, 
For the sailor has been to sea. (Chorus).

HORSESHOES. 
Written by Jerry Cohan expressly for Billy Carter, and 
sung by him with great success. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Since horseshoes are in fashion why a 
horseshoe song I'll 
sing, 
Its the latest superstition, the most fashionable thing, 
▪ 
But the only ones 'cept horses who wear them as a 
rule. 
To do them any good must be the jackass or the mule. 
The ladies wear the horseshoe on their fingers,ears and hair, 
The men wear horseshoe pins and canes, it's horseshoe 
everywhere, 
They hang them on the masts at sea to keep away the gales. 
There's horseshoe clocks and bootjacks, horseshoe tracks 
and horseshoe nails. 
They put a 
horseshoe at the gate to keep the witches out, 
Thin people carry a 
horseshoe for luck to make 'em stout, 
And fat folks keep the horseshoe for luck to make them thin 
Yet the bummer sells the horseshoe to the junkman to get 
gin, 
The gambler carries the horseshoe his victim for to skin, 
And the victim carries a 
horseshoe to take the gambler in, 
The fisherman carries a 
horseshoe to help him make a 
haul, 
And if he catches only horseshoe fish he has no luck at all. 
• 
They bake the bread in horseshoe pans, and mould the 
butter, too. 
They nail the horseshoe in the trunk to make the old 
clothes new, 
• 
They hang 'em on the church door and for good luck to 
'em pray, 
And the preacher carries a 
horseshoe to keep the girls away 
The temperance man he carries it to protect him from the 
rum, 
And in hopes he may keep always drunk it's treasured by 
the bum, 
If you want to see a 
horseshoe fly just tickle a 
mule and 
get struck. 
I've sung myself quite horse shoe set, so I'll wish you all 
good luck.

MY 
name is Jeremiah Jones, and when I 
was a 
child 
I 
was up to every little trick that drove my mother wild. 
I 
would take the bellows on my knee, to blow the fire I'd try, 
And when the fire began to blaze, I 
lustily would cry. 
CHORUS. 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, puff, puff, puff, 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, puff, puff, puff; 
First you do it gently, then you do it rough. 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, puff, puff, puff. 
When I 
grew a 
little older, to a 
blacksmith I 
was bound, 
To learn the art of shoeing, which a 
bootless task I 
found. 
They cancelled my indentures, for I 
raised the boss's ire 
By shouting out the whole day long, while dancing round the 
fire. 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, etc. 
In time I 
loved a 
pretty girl, and strange though it may be, 
The lady in her younger days, lived very close to me, 
And when I 
asked her to be mine, she blushed and bowed he.

We're very happy for we've got some little household dears.

If you came into our domicile and chanced to hear them shout

About three miles from here, 
There lives a

To me she does prove dear. 
Her mother takes in washing, 
And the girl helps at the trade, 
And when I've called upon her 
These words I've often said:

Mary Ann McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Take that apron from your eye; 
Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh, 
And we'll be married by-and-by.

Of course I'll settle down; 
I'll buy a

A

Oh, then it will be joyful, 
When as cosy as a

To see the young O'Malleys 
Play tag around the house.

great success. 
Music to be had at • Hardings." 
Soft I 
sing of Mattie, dear, 
Sweetest young maiden far or near; 
Dearest yet, she's my pet, 
Warming up my heart so queer. 
On the fires of love that lie 
In the sweet corners of her eye, 
Oh, I'm gone, I'm killed with joy, 
About my Mattie, dear. 
CHORUS: 
Mattie mine, girl so fine,—Sym. 
Dearest yet, she's my pet.—Sym. 
She's the belle, the daisy grand, 
Sure she's the Queen of Ireiand; 
On my royal head I'd stand, 
For my sweet Mattie, dear. 
In a 
dry good's store below, 
Juggling silks and calico; 
All the day there she'll stay, 
Wasting her sweet life away. 
Oh, if I 
had gold in store, 
I 
would let her work no more; 
For it's in a 
birdie's cage, 
i'd put my Mattie, dear. 
Massa's in the Cold Ground. 
Sung with great success by Barlow, Wilson, Primrose & West's Minstrels, 
Round de meadows am a

The darkies' mournful song. 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
Happy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a 
creeping 
O'er the grassy mound, 
There old massa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold ground. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the corn-field 
Hear that mournful sound; 
All the darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground. 
When the autumn leaves were falling, 
When the days were cold, 
"F was hard to hear old massa calling, 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, 
Now the summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
Down in the corn-field, ctn. 
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning, for he leave them behind.

Who lift the very roof itself, 
With this mysterious shout. 
CHORUS— 
Rise it, Reilly ! all the jolly dancers sing out, 
Rise it, Reilly! show your power and motion, 
Looney now they fly about, lazy feet had better g'out, 
When in the chorus wild they shout: Rise it, Reilly! 
'Tis they who never weaken, 
They'd scorn to lave the flure, 
Their feet have vowed that never

tune they love so well, 
'Tis now the ruction bootnin' grows, 
As wildly still they yell.

And soon the shrieks of music, 
Their notes a 
warning ring, 
When up and at once again, 
They dance and wildly sing.

At our house we've got a

Such a 
brat I 
ne'er did see, 
Looks just like a

And they say it looks like me. 
One eye looks up to the ceiling, 
T'other down toward the floor; 
Nose looks like a 
chunk of putty 
Thrown against the cellar door. 
Head is like a 
squash or pumpkin, 
Or more like a 
billiard ball, 
And it has no place, by golly ! 
Where to hitch a 
waterfall. 
Lord! but .can't it squall and holler !

OUR PATRICK IS AN ACTOR. 
By FRANK DUMONT. 
Sung by JAMES JOHNSON, and performed by Jonxsox & Powtaa. 
I 
have raised a 
dozen children, quite proud of them am L 
And some are influential, and hold positions high; 
Oh, I 
have lovely daughters, that can't be denied, 
They wear their silks and satins and in a 
carriage ride; 
There is Larry, Ted and Owney, with Terrence, Dan and 
Mike, 
All elegant, and scholars, you never saw the like; 
But the youngest is our Patrick, he's worst of all you sec, 
For he's traveling with a 
Circus, an Actor man to be. 
ClIORUS: 
Our Patrick is an Actor, he wears the finest clothes, 
The ladies all admire him no matter where he goes; 
With diamonds on his shirt-front, a 
lump the size of Ilia, 
It's folly to deny it, a 
dandy is our Pat. 
When he's home upon a 
visit, the neighbors far and near, 
Extend an invitation to have cigars and beer; • 
I'll cook corn beef and cabbage, to have a 
lovely meal, 
But Patsy doesn't touch it, so dainty does he feel; 
But he'll eat ice cream and peaches, Blanc Mange and 
custard pie, 
lt's the style he learnt from Actors, they're always living 
high; 
But in spite of all his manners, a 
word for him we'll speak 
lie zie'er forgets his parents with money every week.

RECOLLECTION. 
Written by Wm. J. 
SCANLON. 
When e'er I 
think of bygone days, 
And the happy times we had 
At home in dear ould Ireland, 
It makes my heart feel glad. 
When I 
think of my poor ould mother, 
And my father, ah! how dear 
That sweet recollection is to me, 
flow I 
wish they were here. 
CIIORITS. 
But now I 
am old, my life is quickly passing, 
Soon I'll be laid away cold in my grave, 
And my mother and father's blessing I'll remembei L 
:That blessing to me which they joyfully gave. 
I 
was but a 
boy fifteen years old 
When I 
was left alone, 
To wander through this wild world 
Without a 
friend or home. 
I 
had to earn my living, 
And that I 
did quite well, 
So when I 
meet with good old friends, 
Those things I 
love to tell.

CUR AT MY REELS. 
-: 
0 :----
As sung by WILLIAMS 
SULLY to many smiles. 
I 
dislike to trust men who hang on to the truth, 
And haven't the nerve to tell lies; 
I 
like to hear a 
man say he killed fifty bears, 
When he knows in his heart they were flies. 
It may not be pleasant to have five thousand dollar? 
Given you by each tramp you meet, 
Bat it's better to find your mother-in-law drunk 
Than to judge a 
poor girl by her feet. 
CHORUS: 
For I 
do like a 
Tom cat with a 
high tenor voice, 
A. Maria that can kick, fight and steal; 
I 
like a 
spitz poodle with all kinds of fleas, 
But I 
don't like a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to see a 
chambermaid in a 
hotel 
Go through every new boarder's trunk, 
I 
like to see a 
preacher on Sunday in church, 
And on Monday in debt or on a 
drunk; 
I 
don't like a 
maiden of sweet sixty-four 
To tell me she's just seventeen, 
But give me the girl from old Boston town 
Who can wrestle with baked pork and beans. 
CHORUS: 
For I 
do like boiled eggs that have seen better days, 
can paralyze all kinds of veal; 
I 
can battle successfully with all kinds of soup, 
But I 
don't care to miss a 
square meal.

Brogue and my Blarney and Botherin' Ways, 
As sung by H ARRY RICHMOND with great success. 
It's true what I 
say, by the powers above, 
I'm getting quite fat, though I 
live upon love, 
Wid my brogue and my blarney and botherin' ways, 
Five sweethearts I've got and sure I'm inclined 
To marry her first that is first in the mind. 
I 
see them all round in the course of the day, 
And I 
do all I 
Can for to keep their hearts gay, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
The first is a 
spinster, a 
bit passed her prime, 
And I 
call every morning about breakfast time, 
Wid my brogue, &c 
I 
tell her that she can of great beauty boast, 
As I 
swallow her coffee, her eggs, and her toast ; 
I 
speak quite respectable and hope that my fate, 
Will be soon join'd to her's in a 
connubial state, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
At luncheon I 
go to a 
charmin' cook-siop— 
On the mistress, sweet Mrs. Maloney, to drop, 
Wid my brogue, &c, 
I 
kiss her, I 
press her, I 
ogle and sigh, 
She'll have me as soon as her husband does die, 
An he's now sick in bed like a 
fowl wid de croup, 
So I 
pledge her bright eyes in a—basin o' soup, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
A buxom young widow, I 
think it no crime 
Accidently drop on, about dinner time, 
Wid my, brogue, &c. 
59 
BROGUE AND MY BLARNEY AND 130THERIN' WAYS, 
Continued. 
She takes off the cover, I 
see the beef smoke, 
She cuts me a 
slice—then I 
cut her a 
joke, 
She has two little childer' an' I 
make a 
stir, 
For I 
kiss both the childer' an' then I 
kiss her, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
When with the young widow's old wine I've made free, 
I 
start off in haste, wid the fourth to take tea, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
I 
go there to supper—it's by her desire, 
I 
eat and I 
drink, and I 
sit by the fire. 
Altho' on her back she has a 
large hunch, 
I 
make her a 
judy—by drinkin' her punch, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
After drinkin' the punch, I'm inclined for a 
nap, 
So I 
tie on my handkerchief for a 
night cap, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
I 
sit there and doze, an' I 
nod while I 
woo, 
She says that she hopes that as now I'll be true, 
If I 
should prove false she forever would weep, 
So I 
swear to be constant—and stop there to sleep. 
Wid my brogue, & c. 
When first I 
began, I 
was thin as a 
rat— 
But I'm now like an alderman gettin' quite fat, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
To gammon a 
meal out of each I 
contrive, 
And faith, if I 
could I 
would marry all five, 
For they're all very rich, as I 
told you before, 
I'll bury them all—then go courting five more, 
Wid my brogue, &c.

Take me Back to Home and Mother. 
Composed by W ILLIAM A. 
H UNTLEY, and sung by JENNIE M ORGA) 
Take me back to home and mother, 
I 
am weary wand'ring here, 
There can never be another 
Spot on earth so dear to me. 
Though I 
roam 'mid scenes of splendor, 
Yet my heart is filled with pain, 
And a 
longing, sad and tender, 
Whispers take me back again. 
CHORUS. 
Take me back to home and mother, 
For my heart is filled with pain, 
Take me back to home and mother; 
Only take me back again. 
Take me back to home and n;lother, 
To the happy scenes of yore, 
Friends of childhood, sister, brOther, 
Long to welcome me once more. 
I 
can hear their voices ringing, 
In sweet memory's refrain, 
To the past my heart is clinging, 
Only take me back again. 
" 
Take me back, &c. 
Take me back to home and mother, 
Gentle words will greet me there, 
For on earth there is no other 
Kindness like a 
mother's care. 
Life is but a 
dream of pleasure, 
Sweetest hours must turn to pain, 
Home is all I 
have to treasure, 
Only take me home again. 
Take me back, &c,

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
DIMPTY, 
IT PLEASES' BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
ft is a Pae simile of a Trick practiced by (*A 
the Professors of Magic. 
ibegretaiftribihriire 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom• 
ponied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic °Ale; 
has been sent us, called TIUMPITY DUMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap • 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A 
little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at.home in the hand 
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
