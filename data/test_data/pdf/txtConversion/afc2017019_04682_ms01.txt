HUMPHRIES, STEPHEN D. 
Interviewed by Christopher Sims 
October 13, 2017 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:00:05]: See if I can get one of these ladies here. 
SIMS [0:00:22]: Alright. I guess my first question is, why do 
they call you Doc?  
HUMPHRIES [0:00:31]: I was in the army, up to 21 years but, I 
did a lot of medical work, I was air medevac, paramedic rescue, 
I did medical intelligence. 
SIMS [0:00:47]: What’s medical intelligence?  
HUMPHRIES [0:00:48]: You go into a country to see what diseases 
are endemic and what their medical conditions are, their 
facilities, working for the, combat intelligence, find out, like 
when I was in, I had to go to Egypt and find out all the various 
hospitals there, that were, you know, serviceable, you can visit 
them, and see if they can, take US casualties, or ally 
casualties, what is real and all that. But, Doc is my registered 
alias with the FBI, and, so, I do a lot of work. And, you know, 
EMS, EMT, all that good stuff, so, I did, work as a, back in the 
day, you know, when I was really working clinical and 
everything, I worked clinical for a lot of years, but this, you 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
know, when, you’re the unit medical person as Doc, so as you say 
yeah, anyway.  
SIMS [0:01:44]: So, tell me where you grew up, where you- 
HUMPHRIES [0:01:47]: I’m a service brat, father was in the 
Marine Corps, so I did a lot of living at Camp Lejeune, and when 
he, when he was in Vietnam, he, you know, we moved back to 
Tennessee and Arkansas, where the family was. But, pretty good 
time you know, Camp Lejeune, Memphis, Little Rock, those areas 
there, but-  
SIMS [0:02:12]: Yeah, I’m not too far from Lejeune, so you know- 
HUMPHRIES [0:02:14]: Oh, where you at? 
SIMS [0:02:15]: I’m in Durham.  
HUMPHRIES [0:02:16]: Oh okay, my little brother, I’ve got 
brother that’s, he lives in, what is it, Clayton? Clayton? 
SIMS [0:02:22]: Yeah. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:02:23]: Yeah, yeah, and I got another little 
brother that’s fixed to move back New York. He’s in Manhattan, 
and he’s moving back to Raleigh. 
SIMS: Oh.  
HUMPHRIES [0:02:30]: My niece is working, she’s, her first year 
law in the beltway if you (laughs) will. 
SIMS: In D.C.? 
HUMPHRIES [0:02:37]: No, in Raleigh.  
SIMS: Oh. In law school or first year lawyer? 
HUMPHRIES [0:02:41]: No, she’s, first year lawyer. 
SIMS: Okay.  
HUMPHRIES [0:02:43]: She graduated a little early and got her 
degree, she works real estate, legal- 
SIMS: Oh yeah, well it’s exploding right now. 
HUMPHRIES: Yeah, yeah, (laughs) Yeah. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: It’s unbelievable 
HUMPHRIES: Mhm. 
SIMS [0:02:55]: The last couple years, you know, houses that 
were like $80,000-  
HUMPHRIES: Now, now 200,000. 
SIMS: Now they’re even like half million. 
HUMPHRIES: Oh man. 
SIMS: It’s ridiculous. 
HUMPHRIES [0:03:05]: Yeah, my little brother lives in, right 
outside of Wilmington in, one of the little communities, he’s 
out there. But he works at Sunny Point or whatever out there on 
the coast and he’s, he’s also in security for the government. 
Anyway, stays with us. 
SIMS [0:03:22]: So, after high school, did you join the military 
right away?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:03:27]: Yup, my draft, I was in that drafty age, 
and it was like, I’m gonna join, not to be drafted you know. You 
know, cause I had my draft number and everything else so I 
joined, flat out, signed up. First duty assignment, well, after 
I went through all the training, medical training, 
reconnaissance training, and then I had to do clinicals, but, I 
went stateside, I went to Germany. I was in a nuclear missile 
unit, so it was an independent corpsman missile site. 
SIMS [0:03:58]: Which part of Germany?  
HUMPHRIES [0:03:59]: Down south, near Tübingen, I was first, my 
home base was near Scwäbisch Gmünd. 
SIMS: Okay. 
HUMPHRIES: And, know where it’s at? 
SIMS: My relatives are from near Dettenhausen, which is near, 
between Tübingen and Stuttgart. 
HUMPHRIES: Yup, oh yeah. 
SIMS: So, I lived there for a summer, then- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES: Yeah 
SIMS: I went to school in Würzburg, so yeah, my- 
HUMPHRIES: Good country. 
SIMS [0:04:24]: Yeah, my relatives worked for Americans on the 
bases. 
HUMPHRIES: Oh, that’s a good deal.  
SIMS: Yeah, it’s a real beautiful- 
HUMPHRIES [0:04:32]: Yeah, Scwäbisch Gmünd was good, you know, 
that was my first tour and second tour I was at, stationed at 
Landestuhl,so,  but I lived out, out and about. 
SIMS [0:04:42]: So did you choose the medical field within the 
army or was that assigned to you? 
HUMPHRIES [0:04:46]: No, I, I, I did medical within the army, I 
learned all my skills, before that I was first chef at Camp 
Lejeune for the officers club. So, (laughs) I can cook a mean 
gumbo now, but no, I did med, all medical army, well secondary 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was chemical intelligence so, I did a lot of work with group and 
everybody else, so, paid off. 
SIMS [0:05:09]: So did you, early in your army career, did you 
do any type of training that is at all similar to what they do 
now?  
HUMPHRIES [0:05:21]: Yeah, when, when I was in Landestuhl, I was 
with a PT, PO and T section, Plans Operation and Training. And 
my job there, was to develop training for, like medical teams 
and all that. Like, I trained medical teams that were going in 
to Beirut, Lebanon, to recover the marine blast. But, I did a 
lot of school, like I went to moulage training, I’m a certified 
moulage trainer, I, that paid off, you know, especially around 
Halloween. You know, they really like me. 
SIMS: (laughs) 
HUMPHRIES [0:05:53]: But, but, you know, I did that, and of 
course, working in the EMS field, you can see, you know, the, 
you see the actual injuries and everything else so where you can 
replicate and simulate and train people how to react. You know, 
it’s one thing for you, you, say build a protruding liver out of 
a guy, and so a medical team sees it and says “Oh, we can take 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this” but Joe the grunt sees it, then says “Buddy, that’s a 
whole different thing altogether”, so.  
SIMS [0:06:24]: So even back in the 70s, 80s- 
HUMPHRIES: 80s, yeah.  
SIMS: Like the moulage training was already well established? 
HUMPHRIES [0:06:33]: Wasn’t well established, you know, Fort Sam 
offered it and it was, you know, I had it over there in, in 
Germany. We had a, a medical illustrations element, there at 
Landestuhl, that’s where I took the training. Three weeks, and a 
lot of hands on practical, wound study, anatomy study, this that 
and the other, and then you had the appliances and different 
things, how to build things. So. 
SIMS [0:07:03]: So what are, in those earlier days, like what is 
the actual material that you use? 
HUMPHRIES [0:07:11]: Well, like I was gonna build a blister on 
you, really surprising, you’d put a big dollop of Vaseline and 
you cut a Kleenex with a half inch gap around the edge of it. 
You peel the plies apart and you tap it on there and it 
replicates skin. And you tap through a little more Vaseline, you 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sprinkle some hair on there and it looks like a big bodacious 
blister on there from a burn or a chemical injury. You do 
traumatic amputations, you know, like, we did, one of our 
favorites where we do, we’d amputate, put a fake finger that’s 
been ripped out, you know, your fingers are ripped off or 
massive lacerations, gunshot wounds. You know, we, you know we 
have some photos of them. I know I still do, I could send you 
some photos of some more injuries but, and then, you know, just 
typical things that you would see in a combat environment and 
then things that you don’t see in a combat environment. You got 
a, you have a civil affairs team, goes into a village, and also 
you look up and there’s a woman there whose got a big bruise on 
her face from being slapped, by the, by a native and everything 
else. That’s something that, you know, wait a minute, how do we 
deal with this and, I knew in roleplay I had a lady Passy that 
used to go around with me. She was my veterinarian, and we were 
in a, we portrayed in a country where the male dominated society 
and women spoke when spoken to and that kind of thing. And one 
of the most wildest ones we did was, we met with a hospital 
command staff, and the male hospital commander, but everybody, 
all his staff were female and they’re all colonels. And we’re 
sitting there and, all of a sudden, Passy spoke out of turn and 
I reach over, backhanded her right in front of them, said, 
“Woman, don’t ever speak while I’m speaking” and then, she, she 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
just, “Yes, sir, yes sir”, you know three backs slowly, and of 
course, you know, this whole hospital staff is like, you know, 
and I apologized. I said, “Look, let me apologize for the woman 
speaking out of turn” (laughs). And then, of course these nurses 
are out there ready to kill me. 
SIMS: So what happened? 
HUMPHRIES [0:09:29]: Oh, well, you know, the commander just, he 
drove on with our meeting and such as that, but you know, he 
kinda drew the line when, you know, I said, “Can you have one of 
your women get us coffee?” and (laughs) he’s like, you know, he 
kinda looked and they was like, “dare you to say something”. 
And, it was, quite entertaining. We want to put that heat on 
them, welcome to a foreign country, the customs are different 
from yours and you know, like, we, we would be in a, in a 
hospital and I had my driver light up a cigarette inside a ward, 
which is common practice in a lot of the countries we were in. 
And, you know, the hospital staff lights up, you know, they’re 
used to, you know, welcome to, welcome to the real world, you’re 
not in America anymore. So. 
SIMS [0:10:15]: So things like that, like the cigarette and 
slapping your assistant, do you come up with those things?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:10:22]: A lot of the times, I was, we’d do scenario 
development down range we have an OC, “Hey OC, I’m fixing to do 
this to this unit, and, this is what we’re gonna do”, and, you 
know, a lot of it’s based on real world times that we’re, you 
know, myself and others have spent overseas in, in environments. 
And, we develop it on the spot and we’re very good at what we 
do. You know, like I would show up, at an, at an MP unit, and 
“Hi, I’m here”, I was representing the International Red Cross, 
and a doctor from the country of Cortina, “I’m here to inspect 
your POW camp and how you’re treating our POWs”, and, oh you 
know, it’s just like, “Wait a minute, what are”, “Hey, I have 
the credentials and dadadada, let’s go”. And, you know, really 
put the heat on them, “Let’s do it now, quick on in there”, 
they’re trying to check my background, if I’m really decent to 
go and everything else, but no, and you really go in there, and 
I had, you know, we have the expertise, and I did a lot of the 
things there with them. You know, “You’re handling your POWs and 
you’re not wearing surgical gloves, why not? You know what 
diseases he has?” “No” You know, go from there, “Alright, what 
else have you done to this POW, he has bruises and such, is 
that, Is that from you? How much water and food are you giving 
him, how are you treating this guy?”, and they’re like, “Uh, we 
don’t know” so it’s a little different. But, in other things, 
you know, I did a lot of the, worked a lot of the chaplains too, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chaplains get out there, you know, they’re like, “We’re with the 
ministry, and dadadada”, you know, we’re in a country, we have 
one chaplain who was captured and he, him and his assistant, 
they just turned around and executed his assistant right there 
in front of him. He’s like, where’s the Geneva Convention, well 
you know, the country you’re in didn’t sign it, they don’t care. 
(laughs) It’s real world, real world scenarios there, “Chaplain, 
okay, you’re a man of God, good, you can go out here and polish 
all the pews in the church and you work for this priest” and 
real world, I’ve been in countries where I had a Jesuit priest 
that treated everybody Catholic like dirt. And you go to 
countries, like a Muslim or an Iman, they don’t recognize 
Christians you know, and I know in Kosovo, the Serbian Orthodox, 
were like, the Albanians—they were called them Shqiptari and, 
they were like cattle and, they, they, had the- 
SIMS [0:13:05]: Are you working mostly with like the specific 
medical or the chaplain folks versus like the rest of the 
rotations? 
HUMPHRIES [0:13:13]: I, I focused a lot on the medical but it 
depends on the scenario. There's times that I work with the 
units, the actual units cause you're, you have to know the 
structure of the units. That's where the military ties into it 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cause you have, like a brigade would come in and they have a 
Charlie med, it's a medical company. Then they would have a 
support hospital in the rear and so, you know, you'd follow 
their chain of evacuation. And you would test them, "Okay, what 
do you do for an enemy soldier that's wounded?" And you'd put an 
enemy soldier, I'd have a role player take an enemy soldier to a 
unit and say "Here, he's bleeding and what are we gonna do?" You 
know, first their instinct, "Yeah, let's kill him" you know, 
(laughs) No, can't do that, you know, wanna train them that.  
SIMS [0:14:01]: What’s the, official, what's the right way to 
handle that? 
HUMPHRIES [0:14:05]: You, you have to treat them and take care 
of triage just as you would your own. And, you know, you secure 
them but you know, again, you, you have to treat them correctly 
and do life-saving measures such as that. So, pretty good that 
way. The, other things, say I focus a lot on the medical aspects 
but then, we did a lot on the sovereignty. Like one of the 
scenarios I had is when the 82nd came in and they dropped in on 
the zone, they put the 82nd Airborne flag up on top of the tower 
and I had one of my players go take it, and, go take that, so 
when we had the meeting with the governor, you know, we're 
sitting there, and I had the governor. I was like, "Governor, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I'd like to present this flag where this organization has 
declared their country, they placed a flag on our, our property 
and I don't appreciate it". Cause I was a high official in the 
government. The governor (laughs) threw it at the brigade 
commander and you know, he like, "Uhh, uhh", you know, how do 
you react, you know. Welcome to politics. So. 
SIMS [0:15:19]: Is this in Dara Lam? 
HUMPHRIES: What's- 
SIMS: re you, this is next to that air field? 
HUMPHRIES: Yup. 
SIMS: By  
HUMPHRIES [0:15:24]: Yeah, yeah, by the, I don't know if you've 
had the chance to get out there, but, we did that, I don't, 
there's so, just so many scenarios we did on the spot, you know, 
what can we do, how, develop. We did, things like when the air 
force came in, we're at Peason Ridge, you know, I don't know if 
you know Peason Ridge- 
SIMS: Yeah. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES: Up north. 
SIMS]: Yeah. 
HUMPHRIES [0:15:45]: There are large herds of feral horses, and 
so I had one of the local farmer guys go up there and complain 
to the air force that their aircraft coming in chased off all 
their horses and they wanted help to round them all up. So, next 
thing you know, we have this entire air force unit, have little 
helicop-, little birds and everything else trying to round up 
all the wild horses. There's no way they're gonna catch them, 
you know, and, you know, it's just, a lot of they, you wanna put 
at them, you know, cause, to stress to the soldiers coming 
there, you're not in America, people think different from what 
you do and their, their needs and desires are different from 
what you do. That same village in Peason, you know, the Air 
Force coming up, dying to please, came up and asked the, the 
owner, Mr. Parry, of the, the farm there, "What do you need?" 
And he had about 35, 40 people there, a lot of women, and he 
said, "Well, we need sanitary napkins, could use a case of them" 
and they're like, "What?" And then, "We need you, those little 
plastic meals that you have, we want you to save all the 
wrappers cause we, we need them." And so, you know, Air Force 
went out, they snuck somebody out to Wal-Mart and bought a case 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of sanitary napkins. Well, when they came out, they're so proud, 
you know. "Here, these are for you" "Oh no, they're not for the 
women, we use them to insulate the well house" So, grab a staple 
gun and insulated the well house with it, and they, MRE 
wrappers, they use as roofing shingles. So, you know, these 
people are like-   
SIMS: Right. 
HUMPHRIES [0:17:16]: Okay. (laughs) "What do we do?" But then, 
you know, the other thing too, you, you wanted to teach them a 
sense of neutrality, you know. Alright, I have a red cross, so 
what's the veterinarian wear? It’s green cross. 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
HUMPHRIES [0:17:32]: And so, you know, and then, the chaplains, 
they all have their little cards, their Geneva Convention cards 
and then, we had the International Red Cross and the American 
Red Cross and they're two different affiliates. And the, 
International really doesn't care for the American Red Cross at 
the time because the American Red Cross wore uniforms  
SIMS: yeah 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:17:53]: Yeah and, a lot of times they won't talk to 
each other, so you know, we were teaching that. We did, when we 
had the prisoner exhchanges over in Bosnia, we, we had, Mr. Jack 
came from the International Red Cross and we actually, we were 
the ones that trained the soldiers to do the prisoners 
exchanges- 
SIMS [0:18:11]: This is way back in the- 
HUMPHRIES: 80s. 
SIMS: 80s? 
HUMPHRIES [0:18:15]: Yup, it was the—no, it was in the 90s, 
about '95. There's, there's, CNN was covering it when they 
actually did prisoner exchanges in Bosnia, you know, we did the, 
we're the ones that trained them how to do that, the U.S. forces 
how to do that. So, you know, we had to do our research and 
everything else and work with the, the right people. It's pretty 
interesting how you do one, you know, you had mediators, 
documents, and everything else that you had to do. And working 
with the Red Cross, the neutral, and then we had the, you know, 
Bosnia started heating up, we did the ICTY, the International 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Criminal Tribunal and we had to work, teach them how our 
investigative techniques went and what we did there.  
SIMS [0:18:59]: So how are you, like, on your own, like, 
researching, each time a different- 
HUMPHRIES [0:19:05]: I had a key character, key role because I 
did, I had staff with me that, like I had, I had in the various 
villages, I had a clinic with a nurse that was working there. 
And they were doing various things, and, you know, I would train 
and they all had some medical training, and, we were doing 
various things on that regard. They knew, so, they knew enough 
to where a, if a U.S. Forces doctor or medic would come in, they 
could talk the medical jargon. "Hey, this guy has this and 
dadada, penetrating gunshot wound, third thoracic area in this 
and the other." And we had veterinary issues, I had Passy, was a 
veterinarian, she was an actual vet tech- 
SIMS: In real life? 
HUMPHRIES [0:19:56]: In real life but she worked with us in 
roleplay but we did things like, I would send her out to harass 
the veterinarians at the local hospital, "Hey, you need to come 
out and help us out and everything". And then we had, I sent, I 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sent a farmer up one time, and he kept going up there, bitching 
at them, you know, saying, "Hey, my birds aren't laying because 
you're, you're making so much noise" you know, and he'd go there 
every day and then, finally they said, "Well bring your birds by 
here and we'll have the veterinarian look at them". Well, he 
always said "birds", he never said chickens, ducks, turkey, 
whatever. 
SIMS: Right. 
HUMPHRIES [0:20:30]: He showed up with two emus. (laughs) 
SIMS: (laughs) 
HUMPHRIES [0:20:33]: In this cage, and then, this veterinarian 
was like, "What". So he wasn't gonna, you know, downplay it so 
he laid out all his bags and everything, went out and looked, 
and like an idiot, he goes and opens the door, and the farmer 
open the cage and he gets in the- Hello youngin. He opens the 
cage, and the next thing you know, he, once he's in, farmer 
closes the cage door, puts the tailgate up, takes off with him. 
He sold him to the Opfor. Lesson learned. 
SIMS: Was there a real life emu? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:21:07]: Yeah, sure did.  
SIMS: Just ran out? 
HUMPHRIES [0:21:05]: Oh no, he didn't run out, we kept him, they 
were trained, you know, they were docile. You know, I had, I had 
emus that I brought in for play. 
SIMS [0:21:11]: Where do you get emus? 
HUMPHRIES [0:21:13]: Oh, you can buy them, around here, 
catalogs, they, you can buy them. I had, I had about half a 
dozen of them but, it was-  
SIMS [0:21:23]: Now I heard there was an emu that used to wander 
around- 
HUMPHRIES [0:21:26]: Yeah, somebody let it loose in the box.  
SIMS: Yeah. 
HUMPHRIES: Yeah, I know there was some OC that was freaking out 
cause the emu came and looked in his tent there. (laughs)  
SIMS [0:21:34]: (laughs) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:21:36]: Don't know, it just, probably somebody let 
it loose, couldn't feed it.  
SIMS: Right. 
HUMPHRIES: Yeah, so, you know, they do alright. 
SIMS [0:21:43]: What other animals do you recall being around-  
HUMPHRIES [0:21:47]: Goats, chickens, and we had, you know, 
large h-, large herds of goats. We had the horses too. Now we 
had some special horses that we got from the army laboratory. 
And what they were used for is to make horse serum and if you 
look at their flanks and such, that they had large lumps on 
there, where the injection sites were, where they were used in 
the lab. Well, of course, once the horses were done on, their 
lifestyle, they gave them to JRTC, government property. So, we 
used them in training, you know, we would take them out and say 
"Look at my horses, I mean, this didn't happen until you guys 
got here so, explain that", you know, and so everybody hits the 
books, goes back there and gets online and everything else. But- 
SIMS [0:22:34]: So like the goats and chickens, do you just, get 
petty cash from somewhere or- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:22:39]: No, they have a, an actual wrangler, Dennis 
Denseta is the wrangler, and they purchase them. And they have, 
probably well over 100 goats and every village has got X number 
of chickens and ducks and geese and such as that so they’re 
sitting out there, they have them out there. 
SIMS: Is it still going on? 
HUMPHRIES [0:23:00]: Yeah, as far as I know, yes they are, 
especially chickens and goats, cause in the Middle East, you 
know, you herd goats. But, I did a lot of high level work as UN  
officials, UN, like I trained for the UN, UNHCR. Mainly I 
focused on the medical Red Cross, International Red Cross, the 
country's Red Cross, the Red Crescent Society, I've done them 
too. But, you know, you have to be able to talk the talk, with 
the medical people, you know, like what, you know, they'll ask 
us "What are your needs?" And one of our issues, and I base it 
on a real-life situation I had. “We had a medical team, came in, 
to one of our villages and that's really nice, we appreciated 
your medical team but what I didn't appreciate, you brought 
security guards and they weren't vaccinated for measles. And 
measles is not endemic to our country, now I've got a whole 
village out there broken out with measles and the, the enemy is 
using that as a propaganda tool”, so you know, when you have 120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
people broke out with measles because you brought somebody in, 
it, it is, in real life when I was in that real world scenario, 
it was a big deal. And, but, you know, people die and you have 
to understand some of these other countries we have, their 
medical is not that great and I was a US-educated, but, I think 
we had to make do with what we had and I don't have all the nice 
supplies and everything. And, due to the hostilities, medical 
stuff was stolen from us, all our drugs were stolen. And we 
would ask them to come in, US forces come in and inventory our 
supplies, help us with this, what do we need, and we would get a 
bunch of expired drugs which is commonplace some of the other 
countries, they don't just throw them away, they sell them, and, 
you look at some ointments and, "Hey, this is expired for a 
year". I said, "Well, don't throw it away, we'll still use it". 
Wait a minute, you know, we'd offer to buy all their expired 
medications and, I don't know, we did a lot of things, you know, 
like, we'd go into a BSA and we'd offer to buy [indecipherable] 
support area and they usually have a lot of big soldiers, you 
know, brigade support, and females. And we'd go there and offer 
to buy them. And, the reaction you'd get, I mean, "Hey, I'm 
here, I'm gonna give you $20,000 to marry me to that female 
right there". And you know, you'd have, you know, you target 
people too, you, say if you have that young lieutenant female 
wandering around, all that, you'd have some little buck sergeant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
say, "I wanna buy that woman". And you offer $20,000, he can 
jokingly say sure.  
SIMS: Right. 
HUMPHRIES [0:25:55]: And then, then you'd have people show up to 
come get her. We actually did a kidnapping one time, in that 
regard. 
SIMS: So, what happened? 
HUMPHRIES [0:26:02]: Oh, then we took her, threw her on the back 
of a horse and took off. (laughs) And, you know, we took her and 
handed her over to Opfor. It was, it was interesting. (laughs)  
SIMS [0:26:13]: What was her reaction during- 
HUMPHRIES [0:26:14]: Oh, you know, she, she just, her hands were 
tied, she's ziplocked, the cowboy had her, "Woman, I'm gonna 
marry you". (laughs) 
SIMS: (laughs) 
HUMPHRIES [0:26:23]: So, you know, like, you know, what, you 
know, they're, they're in a panic mode then, like "These people 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were serious". So, you gotta be careful what you say and what 
you do. But, - 
SIMS [0:26:35]: What about, like, that acting part of like, you 
had the medical knowledge, but like, a big part of all this is 
acting right? Do you feel, is that hard or? 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:26:48]: It was, you would, rehearse, as a trainer. 
It's not acting as a trainer so we would be doing things, you 
rehearse what you're gonna say, what you're gonna do. Some of 
it, you know, helps if you're familiar with your topic but after 
you've done this for a few rotations and such that you get used 
to it. But, you do have to have that, that public, public 
speaking skill, you do have to, the people that you work with 
have to know what they're doing, you have to have a script and 
study it and, we'd have scenarios and then you embellish on 
whatever was written, based on your one, one-time scenario. So, 
you know, like right now, you would come up to me and you'd be, 
you know, we had the real world press out there and they're all 
wearing press badges so you know, I just had some woman that 
came up, she started reading and she just pushed his press badge 
and he goes, "What are you doing!". And she said, "Well, it says 
press". (laughs) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: (laughs) 
HUMPHRIES [0:27:49]: “Well, you, don't take it literally”. But, 
you know, we played, you know, I played a lot of real-world 
reporters that came out, that did our, do our stories and such, 
and, anyway, we just would rehearse and play it and a lot of us, 
reaction, you know, reaction to the, their reaction, you know, 
you're doing, if you were doing this interview, I could BS you 
all day long. You know, one, you would buy the first ten rounds 
and then I would offer you a cigarette and, I'd find out if you 
don't smoke or not, and then I'd ask. I've been in one scenario 
where I put a grenade on the table, and it's kind of unnerving 
when you're sitting there like, that's a live grenade and yeah. 
Gotta make sure we're all honest here, you know, and I, I, one 
time I was armed, you know, so you have a doctor that's armed, 
carrying with you, open up his doctor bag and it's like "Oh 
man". And then, you know, just little things, you come up to a 
checkpoint, you're wearing a red cross, everything's marked, Red 
Cross, Red Cross, Red Cross, and all of a sudden, they wanna 
search you, I would refuse. And so, what do you do young guard, 
who's your higher and that, we'd get yelling contests. "You will 
not touch me, you will not inspect my equipment, you will not go 
in my ambulance, and whatever. Another scenario we did is we 
would have and enemy soldier in the back of an ambulance that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was wounded and we were carrying him to a hospital and sometimes 
we even loaded up multiple enemy casualties, we'd take them to a 
US hospital, "Here you go, they’re soldiers, take care of them" 
and dump them. And, so, the reactions you see are quite 
different. Then we, we'd set up so many units pretty bad. I 
don't know if you're familiar with the soft operations, where 
they would, they would be in, a small compound by themselves, 
usually out in the, the remote area. We'd have a lady show up 
everyday, selling them things, you know, offering them, "Hey, 
I'll sell you a Pepsi or I'll sell you some candy" and she would 
show up everyday with this cooler, and then about day five, she 
shows up with a cooler and it's loaded with explosives, and 
she's talking with the gate guard, and then she leaves but 
leaves the cooler there and, it is what it is. Blow it, and 
there it is, took the whole gate out. 
SIMS [0:30:24]: So one time I saw, there was a suicide bomber 
inside of a Red Crescent ambulance. 
HUMPHRIES: Mhm.  
SIMS: So, what is the protocol for checking ambulances, whether 
it’s Red Cross or- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:30:36]: You can check an ambulance, alright, but 
you don't wanna, you know, and again, you can do that, you can 
check the Red Cross, you know, you can ask them but, again, what 
are your credentials, you know, what are my credentials, am I 
known to the command, am I on a clean list, but I wouldn't, I 
wouldn't let them in my area, you know, just going through, I 
would check it. And, when I was in Landestuhl we had an 
ambulance that was stolen, you know, when it was on active duty, 
and it was packed with explosives, and they were gonna try and 
blow up the emergency room with it but they got caught. But, 
again, that's what some vigilant gate guard opened the door, you 
know- 
SIMS [0:31:19]: Like Red Army? 
HUMPHRIES [0:31:20]: What’s that? No, it was about a Baader 
Meinhof. So, the, but you know, we relive those things, so, 
train on, build on, read the intel reports and everything else, 
how can you smuggle things through a checkpoint, I might be 
clean as a doctor but it’s my driver, cause you don’t know him 
from Adam, you know, some guy could have given him five bucks to 
let’s go and, it happens. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:31:51]: What’s the hardest part of the job, when you 
were doing roleplay? 
HUMPHRIES [0:31:55]: Roleplay? Long hours, you know, especially 
when we were doing takedowns at the, the Shughart-Gordon 
villages. We’d get there, you know, we come in at six o’clock in 
the morning and we’d be there 36 hours. 
SIMS [0:32:11]: The final culminating moment- 
HUMPHRIES [0:32:13]: Yeah, yeah, the big battles. And, you know, 
you lose a lot of sleep. 
SIMS: Right. 
HUMPHRIES [0:32:19]: And, things were, would be happening. And, 
you see some things that you see in real life and you have to 
sit back and take a breath. And, you know, know what you’re 
doing this for. You know, it was, good time, I left roleplay 
here and went to Kosovo on initial operations, went to Kosovo 
with the same company and, was over there with a couple of 
dudes, and then I came back and I worked, preparing them for the 
Kosovo rotations. But, you know, we did, we were told variables, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
so many variables. We did the Haitian rotation where we turned 
North Fort into Little Haiti and,- 
SIMS: [?] 
HUMPHRIES [0:33:12]: Yeah North Fort was Haiti and Port-au-
Prince And Jack Prevatt had been to Haiti, you know, he was one 
of the big guys that was directing us, you know. You know, we 
had to have stage riots and riot control and food convoys and 
everything else, and various techniques, and, you know, it was, 
you know, you put eleven strand around a deuce full of little 
food, and you have a bunch of people attack it and you’re, 
you’re a little lieutenant on a convoy lead and you’ve got 500 
people coming after you, so, it was a little different, so. But, 
we did it, and, we did, a UN NATO rotation for, I think l1, 12 
countries here with their forces and yeah, we, we did a, that 
rotation, you know, we had Lithuanians here, we had guys from 
Kazakhstan, Poland, all the NATO countries were here 
representing when they, you know, they were having to do various 
things checkpoints, and you know, doing the rotation, and we had 
to play with them, so, yeah it worked. It’s, you know, different 
having the different armies here, you know, cause the armies of 
of—you ever work for foreign armies?—a lot of them were little 
more brutal than US forces, they don’t have the ethics that we 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
had, some of them are not, some of them are pretty easy going. 
Sometimes you pay for it, depends on where you go, so.  
SIMS [0:34:46]: When did you leave roleplay- 
HUMPHRIES [0:34:50]: I left roleplay, went GS, back to 
government service, I left in 2001 and, first I went back to the 
hospital, I was working as a master beneficiary counselor and 
then from there, I’ve, I’m now the Chief of Casualties, been 
doing it for roughly ten years now and I, I have, casualty 
responsibility for Louisiana, Mississippi and nine counties of 
Texas so, any soldier gets killed, I’m the one that orchestrates 
the notifications, if they’re wounded, I notify them and get 
them back. They die here, I’m also a deputy coroner, I go and 
pronounce, I work a lot with the “decease-dants” and their 
family and, we help the families. What we do now, real life. 
(laughs)  
SIMS [0:35:47]: That’s, you must, you’re sort of on call 24/7?  
HUMPHRIES: Hm? 
SIMS: You’re sort of on call 24/7, that type of work? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:35:54]: Yup, matter of fact, we had some, I have an 
on call person that I’ll be called, just brought a young soldier 
back today, he just landed in Texas, two o’clock today, he was 
killed by an IED blast on the first of October and his sergeant 
lost both his legs from the knees down and then my other thing, 
I’m also one of the top rated Santa Claus’ in the United States. 
SIMS: (laughs) 
HUMPHRIES [0:36:26]: Serious business, Time Magazine did, I 
have, Time magazine did a story, I’m rated number three 
nationally as Santa Claus- 
SIMS: Number three with a bullet- 
HUMPHRIES: Yeah.  
SIMS: Right. So what- 
HUMPHRIES: Yeah, gets your mind off- 
SIMS [0:36:40]: So, you get to travel and go places, as Santa?  
HUMPHRIES [0:36:45]: Yeah, sure do. Last year, we went to 
Denver. I’ve got, right now, I’m working up something for 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Florida but I do, mostly here. We volunteer our services for all 
the militaries volunteer, but, we do paid events, too, but 
mostly our military stuff. I’ll show you a picture. Grandson. 
I’m getting there.  
SIMS [0:37:31]: Pretty convincing.  
HUMPHRIES: Oh yeah. 
SIMS: So do you have, you have to, you own your own suit right? 
HUMPHRIES: Oh yeah. 
SIMS: Yeah. Are there multiple suits? 
HUMPHRIES: Yeah, I have four. 
SIMS: This one’s pretty fancy, right? 
HUMPHRIES [0:37:42]: Well, I have one, even more so now, this is 
like, me and my grandson, we had a photo session last year. 
That’s the lady I have as Mrs. Claus, she’s very good too. And, 
he’s pulling my beard, little kids like the beards. There’s my 
Mrs. Claus so, and the elves I have, they’re trained, they’re, 
they have four that are special needs adults, you know, and we 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
do background checks and all that kind of stuff. But, special 
needs adults, specials needs, they really enjoy it, they’re 
elves and they talk different but that just adds to the 
portrayal. 
SIMS: Yeah. 
HUMPHRIES [0:38:22]: Yeah, and I have a Grinch, I’ve got, I’ve 
got about 14 elves, a whole troop of people. But (laughs), yeah, 
we do it, we do it quite well. Last year, I got commissioned, I 
was working for Coca-Cola, I did some traveling all around 
Louisiana, promoting Coca-Cola products, and, then came back in 
time to, you know, the BMW here, the last two years opened up 
the community, we promote a lot of community events here. We, we 
did, the VFW hired our photographer, Rotti. We gave, people came 
in for four hours, we gave one free 5x7 photo on the spot, free, 
“Here you go, VFW paid the photographer”. And so the community, 
we had a line going down the street. Photos with Santa, me and 
Mrs. Claus, all the elves and everything else, and so, and we 
have the village of Anacoco also paid, volunteered to pay the 
photographer, so, you know, pays for materials, supplies, his 
time, he’s not asking for a great portion of it but, we’ll do, 
right now we’re doing three community events like that where 
they pay the photographer and I donate my time. Works out good.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:39:40]: Yeah, you’ll probably get pretty busy soon. 
HUMPHRIES [0:39:43]: I’ve already been busy. We do, we do some 
Santa Claus events all year long. One of the things we did is, 
Santa Claus, we had reading where we, we had all the deployed 
kids, coming up in October again, all their moms or dads are 
deployed, we get them together and we, we read story books to 
them and, you know, do this in October. And, the other thing 
too, we find in September those little kids that don’t like to 
do homework or act up in school, nothing scares the hell out of 
you more than Santa Claus showing up at your doorstep with your, 
with your homework assignment. 
SIMS: (laughs) Wow, psychological warfare. 
HUMPHRIES [0:40:22]: Oh yeah, and Mrs. Claus has got a good 
event. She’ll go out, it’s a fundraiser, she’ll go out, schedule 
like pizza night Friday night with one or two families, they 
have the kids there, she’ll show up at your doorstep in full 
costume with an elf, and such that, but, they’ll invite you in, 
comes in, sits down, eats a little pizza, whatever, and she 
says, “What’s for dessert”. And, lady of the house, her husband 
says, “Mrs. Claus, we didn’t make any dessert”. She snaps her 
finger, the elf comes out, whips out this carpet bag, throws 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
each of the kids an apron, they bring a bowl down and they make 
cookies right there in their kitchen with the kids. So, you 
know, that’s a big, big event we like to do, and that’s all off 
season stuff. We go to the various, you know, summertime we go 
to the various camps. I, I go to an autistic children’s camp in, 
Alliance Camp for special needs. We visit them, you know, it’s 
always like, “Now we know who Santa Claus is” so, it’s unusual 
to show up, but you see me on a bass boat going across the lake 
sometimes (laughs) but- 
SIMS: Santa likes to fish too.  
HUMPHRIES [0:41:33]: Yeah, we do, we like boating, what, two 
years ago, I was on a tug boat, had to go down the Gulf and jump 
on a ship and, so that was interesting cause that tug boat was 
like three stories high and we’re swinging on a rope, to get on 
the boat. (laughs) We got out there. (laughs) But, we enjoy it. 
But, the guys in roleplay, roleplay was a great time, usually, 
see a lot, you know, what we do is train those soldiers and, you 
know, it’s the little guys that you’re looking at, the little 
buck sergeants and the little squad, and you want them to, teach 
them to think, don’t just shoot. One of the saddest things I saw 
in Kosovo what, a young PFC accidentally shot a kid and the 
father looked over at the PFC and he said, “Don’t worry, we can 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have more children”. But you know, that PFC was devastated, but 
that’s how foreign, that’s why they have large families, cause 
they, they anticipate losing children. So. But, that’s not our 
lifestyle, that’s not our thought pattern, but, you know, we 
want to teach our young soldiers that, hey, you’re going 
somewhere else and they don’t think like you, they don’t. . .If 
you’ve ever been in a combat situation where, you know, somebody 
shoots at you, you got a 19 year old kid out there and that 
bullet whizzes by him, he grows up real fast. “Hey, wait a 
minute, they’re really shooting bullets at me, you know, I 
didn’t think they shot at Americans”. Well, John Wayne is gone, 
so yes, they do shoot at you, and you’ll die if you’re not, not 
attentive. When I, it was interesting too, when I showed up for 
Kosovo I went to Kosovo, so, we got into our base operations and 
everything else, we sit there, and I came out of my tent, where 
I ran the linguistics program and did some MI stuff. Came out of 
my tent and I bumped into some young officers here at JRTC and 
they were, they’re, “Oh my god! We’re not gonna be doing this 
here, you know, that JRTC stuff here, are we?” I said, “No”. 
“Then you made me look like an ass”. I said, “Well, you know, 
guess what? (laughs) We, we let you show your true self, you 
know”. But, there were, I bumped into quite a few soldiers at 
the, you know, we trained through the years. I get notes from 
them. And, it’s, quite interesting, and- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:43:58]: So, is there like a role-player community, 
around here, people off work? 
HUMPHRIES [0:44:01]: A lot of role-players, and, there’s, you 
know, like I’ve been out of the roleplay for a while but you’ll 
see some of the newer ones come in and they, they, you know, a 
lot of, it’s good work, it’s good money, you know. And, a lot 
of, you’ll see a lot of retirees do it, a lot of seniors that 
are, you know, retired will do role play because, you know, one, 
it’s a good job and it’s not as demanding, if you will, their 
day to day job that they had. The military retirees, if you get 
out there and talk to some of them, you know, the guys that are 
running it, they’ve -- various people in there, they’re retired 
military, and, they’ve been there. But you know, you kinda need 
to have that military background in a lot of it, you know, 
especially when you do scenario development and you do things 
that you need to know while, how the rangers are operating, you 
need to know what the SF does, those kinds of things. And, we 
had that community, you know, Jack, Jack Prevatt, great guy, he, 
he did his comment on, you know, TD was with us for a long time, 
rangers and such as that, and, you know, so we all know that 
operation and what they’re supposed to be doing, and we know 
that doctor but you know, we had to study, you know, it’s like, 
you don’t just think you know it all. You have to read what’s 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
current and everything else, and what, you know, what does the, 
what does the unit want to get out of their visit with JRTC and, 
it, it, it’s different, so. (laughs) 
SIMS [0:45:32]: Yeah, sounds like you have amazing-  
HUMPHRIES: Yup. 
SIMS: You know, variety in the job. 
HUMPHRIES [0:45:37]: Oh yeah, we did. And, you know, it’s, I 
don’t know, we did a lot of things, you know, I could sit there 
and just think of the craziest stuff we did, you know, like, we 
had a blind man go up to a civil affairs person, and the person 
with them would say, “Oh, he’s blind”. And you know, and, “Oh, 
okay” and then he would do sign, cause he was also deaf, so he’s 
doing, you know, he’s blind and he can’t see, they ran out and 
got somebody that knew sign to talk to him, I said, “Guys, he’s 
blind”. (laughs) How’s a blind gonna see you do a sign, you 
know, duh. (laughs) You know, so, you know, you know, it’s just 
play on them, you know, they’re so eager to help and such as 
that, but you need to tell them to think. 
SIMS [0:46:26]: You have any other crazy stories? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:46:27]: Oh, yeah we did, you know, we went and had 
a lady, half the women always go up pedaling, go up to the gate 
guards and so, you know, when they get the name of somebody and 
they go up to a gate guard and “Hey, gate guard, I want you to 
go get Sergeant Major” and the gate guard would turn his back on 
them to get on his radio, as soon as he turned his back on them, 
they spray him with that deer scent, and it smells to high 
heaven you know, and they sit there, he turns around, and they’d 
do that a couple times and then leave. Of course, this guy goes 
in his bunker, he like reeks, and that stuff lasts for days, 
but, yeah, we’d do that. We, we’d set them up, you know, you’d 
have a, how to get into a US Forces BSA, you’d have a pregnant 
girl that’s gotta go to the bathroom real bad, shows up at your 
front gate, “I have to go to the bathroom, I, you know, please, 
I really need to go” and, “Can we, we’ll escort you in”. And 
she’s in, actually drawing a map of the whole place. We’ve had 
them also say they’re pregnant, smuggling a bomb, get through. 
You know, you know, there’s so many things we do. We done a, a 
C-130 landing on the air strip and they were there doing a quick 
drop-off and then, while they were waiting on it, they had the 
ramp down, we had two people, two people go up there, get on the 
aircraft and they’re strapped in, buckled in, just sitting 
there. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: (laughs) 
HUMPHRIES [0:47:56]: He’s, you know, nobody caught it, and then 
next thing you know, they’re getting ready to, go down the taxi 
way and they look back, and here’s these two civilians sitting 
there, one’s got a bag of money and, they’re flying out of the 
country. (laughs) Didn’t say anything, and they’re like “Woah! 
Wait a minute”. (laughs) It got interesting. (laughs)  
SIMS: Yeah, I bet. 
HUMPHRIES [0:48:15]: And, you had, orders to evacuate a village 
and he said, well you know, farmers refuse to go without their 
livestock and so, getting Joe out there with a, you know, a big 
truck to load livestock in, so, like “Okay, come on, help us get 
these goats” and, you know, you have a refugee walking right 
through your area, your perimeter and everything, what are you 
gonna do? Stop, search, ask for papers, and what if they don’t 
have papers, you know? And then you have the Civil Affairs, 
they’re out there trying to make nice, you have the combat 
intelligence, they’re out there looking for their stuff, then 
you had the OSCENT players, you know, looking for things, and so 
you had your radio people and, your publications people that 
were putting out open source intelligence, so we wanted to teach 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
them to pick up on that, and, all the, the back, back door 
stuff, you know, was there. And then, you know, like, one of the 
things that, you know, we’ve done is like you dropped, when they 
dropped the air drop, all their MREs, who gets there first? You 
know. You have a farmer goes out there with a truck and all of 
the role players are out there loading all their MREs, taking 
their food. (laughs) Should have had somebody there guarding it. 
(laughs) You know, you have an anticipated drop, yeah we know 
what those MREs are, (laughs) they make good roofing shingles 
(laughs).  
SIMS: (laughs) 
HUMPHRIES [0:49:41]: There, you know, it’s a lot of on the spot 
innovation, you know, take advantage of the time that you’re 
there, you know. We had the guys, you know, the air force took 
half a village prisoner, and they put them in a tent but they 
didn’t put any lights in there so, you know, they didn’t really 
search them well so one of the guys broke out a cigarette 
lighter and lit the end of the tent on fire (laughs). “What do 
we do, what do we do?” you know.  
SIMS: Was it really on fire? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HUMPHRIES [0:50:09]: Yeah. (laughs) It’s, what they did is pile 
up some pine needles and all that, just lit it right there on 
the edge of it, but holy moly, you know, what do you do? And 
then, you know, we’ve had them jump in their trucks and drive 
off, you know, hey, well it was unattended.  
SIMS [0:50:27]: Sounds like there’s less of that now, is that, I 
mean, I’m not as involved but it seems like, from what I’ve 
heard, there was more free play- 
HUMPHRIES [0:50:38]: Yeah, there was, a lot of free play. We did 
other scenarios too, I have, we went other places too, you know, 
like we did a- 
SIMS [0:50:48]: Like a  
HUMPHRIES [0:50:49]: No, we did, like I went down to south 
Louisiana one time for a SERE mission, down pilots there and 
down helicopter pilots and such, and they were out there, and, 
we were working with them out there. I did all the moulage and 
everything for a wounded pilot that couldn’t be extracted. We 
did, operations in Shelby, you know, Cortina a lot of area, so, 
it’s pretty wild, we get around, we got around, and a lot of 
times too, we were asked, “Hey, how do you do this?” The other 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bases, like NTC would call and ask, and we were, we were longest 
running. That guy that just walked in, that’s Ranger Brown, Tom 
Brown. Yeah, he worked up there, leadership program that, where 
they have the online LTPs and all that but, Tom was on that. 
He’s, he did that for a lot of years as a coach and, he worked 
with us really early on when we first started. He worked, you 
know, he was there, but we used to come play them. 
BROWN: Good to see ya, Doc. 
HUMPHRIES [0:51:54]: Hey Tom. 
BROWN: How are you doing? 
HUMPHRIES: Hey Tom, this is Chris. 
BROWN: Hey Chris, nice to meet you. 
SIMS: Nice to meet you. 
HUMPHRIES [0:52:00]: He’s talking about roleplay time. 
BROWN: Huh? 
HUMHRIES: He’s talking to us about roleplay time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BROWN: Oh, roleplay. After 21 years of JRTC, I’m done. 
HUMPHRIES: (laughs) 
BROWN: A lot of rotations. 
HUMPHRIES [0:52:16]: Yup! I did, I counted them up, I did 93 
rotations. 
SIMS: Wow. 
HUMPHRIES: So, anyway, it was different. 
SIMS [0:52:54]: Does anyone ever faint? 
HUMPHRIES: Did what now? 
SIMS: Did anybody ever faint, looking at the moulage, or like- 
HUMPHRIES [0:52:30]: Got sick? 
SIMS: Got, yeah.  
HUMPHRIES [0:52:33]: Yeah, I mean, I would t-, you go in there 
and you would buy sausage casings, hog intestines, and you fill 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
them with, like strawberry Jell-o, a gelatin base, tie them off, 
and you be like, a fake wound, on the stomach, and then you just 
have those intestines hanging out and, you know, it’s one thing 
to see the plastic, when you see some real, honest to God, guts, 
you know, they’re out there. You do, like a leg fracture where 
you have an open bone and you know, we’d actually go, I’d go and 
get bone and actually, that way, you show an open fracture and 
it was, it looked real enough.  
SIMS: So like animal bone or? 
HUMPHRIES [0:53:19]: Yeah, I’d get animal, but deer looked a lot 
like people, and, you know, like a deer’s liver is about the 
same size, around here, that’s a human liver. A protruding 
liver, abdominal wounds, you do head wounds, you know where, you 
take a head wound, just make a base incision with mortician’s 
wax and you put a little putty in there but then you break up a, 
a couple of aspirins and you put the aspirins in there and then 
you mix KY jelly with, red dye, and dab it on there like a 
thickened blood, and those aspirins look like bone, and, so you 
got a skull wound, you know, a skull fracture open, do that and 
you know, and say, that aspirin looks perfect and, put a little 
charcoal on there, you know, activated charcoal, looks real as 
hell. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:54:09]: What does the charcoal do? 
HUMPHRIES [0:54:12]: Has a blast effect, when, like if you’re, 
you know, we did like, I had a police investigation going on 
where we said that somebody executed, you know, a US forces 
soldier executed one of our guys and they did a moulage on his 
head, in the temple area, and put a blast wound in there and a 
protruding wound and, looked real, looks very real. And, you 
know, here’s this guy, we’re saying, you know, that one of your 
soldiers shot this person and they just point out to Joe out 
there and he’s like, “I didn’t shoot anybody” but you know, what 
are you gonna do, Commander? You know, you got the local police, 
they’ve got a body and they say that your soldier shot him, you 
know. Take it as it is but, the, you know, we did, moulage, you 
do, you know, you would take, like we would get a fake arm or 
fake hand, we’d put a US forces uniform on it, bloody up the 
stump and such as that, put a wedding ring on the finger, bloody 
the arm up and then take it to the gate guard and say, “We found 
parts of one of your soldiers, we don’t know where the rest of 
him is but we can show you where we found this, so here’s an arm 
from the elbow down”, you know, what do we do? Call CID by God, 
let’s do fingerprinting to find out who it is. That’s an 
exercise that you may see.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:55:43]: For something like that, they, they got to see 
he doesn’t have a real fingerprint on him, like they would do 
it, like the OC’s would say, “Oh, it’s so and so” or what? 
HUMPHRIES [0:55:54]: Well, actually, usually after about one day 
of out and exposure and everything else, no tissue. On the first 
stage of decomp, it’ll become wrinkled, you know, like you’re in 
a bathtub. Well then, after that, they start rotting, you can’t 
take a fingerprint of this, the tissue comes out so you can burn 
it, burn a fake hand, it looks just like that. Worst case you 
had to do a fingerprint, you’d put wax on the finger and then 
put your own fingers on it and it’ll have a print that you could 
actually read, but, how are they gonna do that, you know. Who 
wants to handle that? So, yeah. (laughs) And then, you know, 
there’s a, say, a biological threats, you know, when you come in 
US forces, are you, you’re in my village, and such as that, say 
we’ve had an outbreak of, plague, a pneumonic plague or we’ve 
had, a disease outbreak, you know, from the vermin and all that. 
You know, can you do a zoonotic study, what’s in, are we 
getting, you can catch tuberculosis from a goat, it’s rare but 
it does happen. So, you know, I’ve got this village, it has 
tuberculosis and all that, I’d like all your civil affairs in 
that village, testing for TB and go from there. You know, 
exposure, you know, just, just standard stuff that you would do 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
if you come into a country and you’re, you’re a supposed 
superior force and you know, sometimes you act hostile to them, 
you know. I don’t want you in my country, you know. What do you 
for, say like a Red Cross person in a village that actually 
supports the regime that’s trying to take over? We’ve had to 
take them out and execute them. (laughs) Just, shoot them, the 
US soldiers said that you were saying this, shoot her. (laughs) 
What do you do? (laughs) Yeah, anyway. And, you know, I don’t 
know, we’ve done, the lady that played my wife was a lady named 
Cece and we had her out- 
SIMS [0:58:08]: Oh, Cece Beale? 
HUMPHRIES [0:58:10]: Yeah, Cece Beale, yeah I don’t know if 
you’ve talked to her. 
SIMS [0:58:12]: I’ve sent her like a Facebook message, but I 
don’t think I’ve, I haven’t heard back from her yet.  
HUMPHRIES [0:58:16]: Yeah. And, she’s a, she was my partner, 
would ride around with me a lot and we did things, like one time 
when we did a take down, they had her out in the square, Opfor 
took her out there and had her on her hands and knees for hours, 
because we knew psych-ops was watching and, you know, eventually 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
they came out and they executed her and it was, we were trying 
to show that in torturing in the village, they’ve taken over, 
they can do a takedown and they were executing civilians, and, 
basically torturing us. So, we did what we did, you know. So, 
Cece’s a good person, you know, she rode around with me for 
years and, got a lot of experience on it too. But she can tell 
you where we trained on the, evil doctor abusing the woman, 
(laughs), shut up woman.  
SIMS [0:59:09]: She’s the one that you slapped?  
HUMPHRIES [0:59:11]: Mhm. We did that, she would, you know, do 
the boohoo, turn on the tears, her and Passy both. 
SIMS:  (laughs) 
HUMPHRIES [0:59:20]: Yeah. (laughs) “Don’t say anything to my 
husband” you know. (laughs) But, anyway, it was all good though. 
But, you shoulda been there. (laughs) 
SIMS: Yeah. 
HUMPHRIES: But. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:59:37]: Is there anything that we didn’t cover that you 
think should be included? 
HUMPHRIES [0:59:42]: The role players did a lot of studying of 
their characters, you know, the ones that are out there, and we 
did have a lot of free play but you had to be right. You just 
didn’t go off and do it unless you knew were right. And you had 
to have the OC present to watch and observe cause, the OC 
doesn’t observe it, it really didn’t happen. So, you know, you 
need to be able to AAR and be able to speak about it in an AAR, 
“Hey, this is what I felt, this is how I, you were treating me 
and this is what I, my goal was to accomplish”- 
SIMS [1:00:13]: It’s like the after action- 
HUMPHRIES [1:00:15]: Yeah, the After Action, you know, Review, I 
mean you’d actually be sitting there with those soldiers and 
say, “Here, this is, you know let’s think about that, you know. 
Chaplain, you’re showing me your little Geneva Convention card, 
I don’t care because you know, one, I didn’t sign the Geneva 
Convention, you know. You’re just a target, you’re a slave, 
you’re a captive and we’re gonna trade you, you know, it, and 
how you treat them, you know, you come into our country and how 
you treat us, it’s reflective of your government. It’s not our 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
government, it’s not our way. We have a democracy but, you know, 
just, it’s just like when communism went away, they like 
communism because they didn’t have to work. So. (laughs) If you 
ever been to a free country now, you know, you wanna teach them 
that stuff that, think, react, how, how are these people gonna 
react to what you’re doing. And then the, shock of war, if you 
will, it was, pretty bad. One of the techniques in Kosovo that I 
was at, there was a village we’re at, they would take two anti-
tank mines and they put a hand grenade in between the two 
triggers, tape it with duct tape, together, put a wire on the 
pin of the hand grenade, because it takes 400 kilos to set that 
trigger off. You run that wire out to the front door of a house 
and, go out the back door, somebody comes in and opens that 
front door and pulls that wire, triggers the grenade and blows 
up the house, with whoever’s in it. So, you need to teach them 
how to do that. Other things that we bumped into in, when I was 
in real world areas, we’d go into a house that’s infested with 
fleas and, you know, you go in there and there’s like waves of 
fleas jumping on you, you know, so you had all this biological 
stuff going on and, you know, insects and everything else could 
be, what do you do about wild dogs running all around, you know, 
you know, what’s your procedure, what’s your protocol. So you 
know, you go to a village and everything, as soldiers, I, I was 
always surprised to see soldiers, would go in our village and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
they would look around, you know, not exposed, you know, if 
you’re not a farm boy, you don’t know what a chicken is then all 
of a sudden these chickens come up to you and start pecking your 
boots and everything. You’re like, you know, “Get away” you 
know. We have some really, soldiers really, Oh my God, you know. 
SIMS: (laughs) 
HUMPHRIES [1:02:44]: And then when dignitaries , foreign 
dignitaries come, we had, matter of fact, we had Madeline 
Albright came here, and we all had to, we, we played it. 
SIMS [1:02:54]: Was she being trained or? 
HUMPHRIES [1:02:56]: No, she was here to, paying a visit to the 
command of, seeing what, you know, doing a State Department 
visit. That’s when we were doing some rotations with the State, 
various State Department officials but she was here, doing, you 
know, she was here playing it and we had to play it. And, you 
know, she came, met the village with all the commanders and 
local dignitaries and all that but you had all the role players 
all around, yelling and screaming and doing, you know, 
protesting and everything else, what they do. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [1:03:26]: What was her reaction? 
HUMPHRIES [1:03:28]: She was, oh, she kind of like, well, smiled 
a lot, like “Oh man, let’s get out of here”. (laughs) And then 
you know, I don’t know, we did so many things out here. We did, 
you know, you would talk about the CIA and you know, to the psy-
ops people we’d keep talking about CIA, CIA, and they were like, 
“There CIA around here?” “Yeah, they’re all over the place. Look 
over there, there’s a couple of them walking over there”, you 
know. “How do you know that’s a CIA?” “It’s Christians in 
Action” (laughs) Hey, different things in different countries, 
you know. And so, we had the CIA out there, press and 
photographers, you know, we had, we had people take your 
cameras, you know, and, it’s one thing to pull the film but you 
pull the lens out, you know, “I have your camera now, what are 
you gonna do about it”, you know. (laughs) “Well, I’ll give you 
bad press.” “Okay, if you live.” (laughs)  You know, welcome to 
brutality. (laughs) But it, it, it was a lot, a lot of good 
times, lot of good people but, you know, a lot of hard work, to 
make it right but it does have its rewards. Say, when I was in 
country, I saw some people that I’d trained and they were, you 
know, glad to see me but they were real leery that I was gonna 
be hassling them again, you know. (laughs) And, it is what it 
is. So, we did all kinds of crazy stuff. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Oh no. 
HUMPHRIES [1:05:02]: They’re closing down. Anyway, want another 
beer? 
SIMS [1:05:08]: I’m good, but let me, can I get the tab? 
HUMPHRIES [1:05:11]: Oh no, I got it.  
SIMS: Sure? 
HUMPHRIES: I’ve got it, I already talked to her, we already paid 
them. 
SIMS: Oh. 
HUMPHRIES [1::]: Cheapest place in town to drink. 
[VISITOR]: Hi to Santa Claus. 
HUMPHRIES: Hey buddy. 
[VISITOR]: What’s up brother? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [1:05:24]: Great, well I got just, like a form to get your 
address if I could.  
HUMPHRIES: Sure. A release? Stay for karaoke. 
SIMS: Hm? 
HUMPHRIES: You can stay for karaoke, I know you’re a karaoke 
player right? 
SIMS: (laughs) How’d you know?  
HUMPHRIES: (laughs) 
SIMS: The sound of karaoke. 
HUMPHRIES [1:05:42]: Yeah. Alright, let’s see, I don’t have my 
pen with me.
