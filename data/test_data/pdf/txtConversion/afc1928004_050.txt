WHOSE BEEN HERE 
SINCE I'VE BEEN GONE 
SONGSTER. 
Who's Been Here Since I'v Been Gone. 
Am —" 
Dandy Jim of Caroline." 
Hans Vandersplittensieglemann. 
Married Betsy Yawsplutcrakenvann, 
He kept a 
Lager Bier saloon, 
And in the band play'd the Bassoon. 
He loved his Betz and she lov'd him 
But Hans with jealousy grew thin, 
And asked whenever he came home, 
Oh who's been here since I've pen gone ? 
CHORUS. 
Oh who's been here since 
pen gone ? 
Oh who's been here since I'v pen gone ? 
Mine Got in Hietnelsplitzen vone. 
Oh who's been here since I'v pen gone. 
Hans grew quite lean, nor would allow 
A 
soul to speak mit Betz, his vrow. 
Kept both eyes open -night and day, 
For fear his Betz might go astray. 
When with his band he did parade, 
Poor Hans was dreadfully afraid, 
"Mine got I 
visit I 
hadn't come, 
Some chap sees Betz, yen I 
am gone!"

6 " Who's Been Here 
CHORUS. 
" 
Oh vy did I 
leave her all alone? 
Vy did I 
leave her all alone ? 
I 
visit I 
never out had come, 
Oh who sees Betz vile I 
am gone ?" 
The war broke out; Hans did enlist, 
And took his musket in his fist 
Bid Betz good bye and as he,press'd 
Her plump, round form unto his breast, 
He kissed her lips, so warm and red, 
And solemnly, to her, he said, 
" 
-Wen I 
am gone, now, Betz, my tear, 
, 
I 
vants no udder fellers here !" • 
CHORUS. 
" 
Not von comes here yen I 
am gone! 
Not von comes here ven I 
am gone! 
Keep all you've got for me alone. 
Let no one in vile I 
am gone .t" 
Betz promised all, and swore•shed'd be 
A p 
ittern of fidelity. 
Hans marched away, with sinking heart 
And Betz cried loud wi en she saw him start. 
" 
Good py, dear Hans!" " My Betz, good pye, 
I'll come pack soon if I 
don't die, 
And kill any chap sure as he's porn, 
Who goes mit you vile I 
am gone!" 
CHORUS: 
" 
Oh keep avay, vile I 
am gone ! 
Oh keep avay, vile I 
am gone! 
Oh splutter gutter splitzer vone! 
Don't touch my Betz vile I 
am gone!" 
Hans fought mit Siegel, side by side, 
But never once forgot his bride, 
But even in the bloodiest fight, 
He wonder'd if all things went right.

Since I've W i

Gone ?"

If Betz was true, if she went out, 
With any other chap about, 
" 
Mine got," thought Hans, " vet should I 
done. 
If some chap goes there vile I 
am gone !" 
CHORUS. 
"Oh, who goes there vile I 
am gone, 
Oh who goes in vile I 
am gone, 
Ten tousand teufils ich von done! 
Who comforts Betz vile I 
am gone!" 
For two long years Hans stay'd away, 
And wrote his wife each New Year's day, 
And when the end of his time had come, 
Brave Hans, discharged, put straight for home. 
He thought of Betz, " mien got" said he— 
" 
Vot a 
goot time I 
will have mit she, 
I'l pay her for staying all alone, 
If no chap's been there since I've pen gone I" 
CHORUS. 
" 
Oh, vots she done since I'v pen gone! 
Oh, vets she done since I'v pen gone! 
Has any von kept my place warm 1 
Oh, who's been dere since I'v pen gone?" 
Hans landed safe, and started soon, 
For his little lager bier saloon, 
And marching in, he look'd around 
But no where Betz was to be found. 
Into the bedroom there he went, 
On finding Betsy still intent, 
Betz BAz !" he cried, " oh, come here quick 
If I 
vait much longer I'll be sick I" 
CHORUS. 
"Vere is my Betz, vere is she gone ? 
Vere is my Betz, vere is She gone I 
Mien Got in Memel vere is she I 
Not to be here to velcome me!"

With tearful eyes, Hans gazed around, 
He something saw, upon the ground, 
Which made him open wide his eyes, 
And filled him with a 
sad surprise! 
There, at his feet, a 
cradle stood, 
And a 
baby in it of flesh and blood, 
It was gumming 
it on a 
pretzel hard as stone, 
Oh, who's been here since I've been gone. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Oh, who's been here since I'v p-n 
gone I 
Oh, who's been here since I'v pen gone! 
Who's baby's disk and Vere's Betz gone! 
Oh, who's been here since I'v pen gone ?" 
Here Betz came in! " Mien got I". says he! 
"Nry here is Hans !" says Betz, says she! 
"Oh B2tz," he cried, " vot have you done? 
Oh, who's been here since I'v pen gone ?" 
" 
Dere's none been here," says Betz, " you know 
You wrote to me, dear Hans, and so 
I 
slept mit de letter, instead o' you, 
Und der papy come; I 
tells you true ?' 
CHORUS. 
"Nien! whose been here since I'v pen gone, 
Nien! Who's been here since I'v pen zone ? 
You can't fool me m:t your letter none, 
Oh, who's been hero since I'v pen gone ? 
" 
De letter make, a 
paw'!" Hans, he cried, 
" 
Oh, Betz. for shame you know you'v lied!" 
Who is the feller diSh has done, 
Oh, who's been here since I'v pen gone ?" 
Pool; Betz, she smiled and looked so plump, 
Han' couldn't wait so made a 
jump, 
And caught in his arms and kissed her well, 
Forgiving all that had betel. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Oh, who's been here since I'v pen gone, 
Who was it kept my place so warm, 
Rez, never mind, about the letter, 
Now I'v come back, tings will go better.

Since I've Been Gone ?" 
ii 
You're very much safer, within your own houses; 
Now altho' la my tkno I 
have had many charges, 
Out of a 
million there none get at large is, 
And in eases of mystery I 
always find news, 
The Commissioners say I'm the pride of the blues. 
Tol de rol, Ste. 
Against drunken men, at all police stations, 
I 
have delivered some first class orations; 
Robbers I've traced and faced without dizziness, 
Which to all proves that I'm up in the business. 
If at night in dark spots I 
find people yawning, 
I 
collar them off—they're locked up till next morn-
ing, 
But if to resist they show much inclination, 
I 
half murder them before we reach the station! 
Tol de rol, &c. 
I've quell'd many broils, for that I 
am noted, 
I'm always up to tricks that get me promoted— 
Thro' strtA?ts, alleys and lanes, I 
go every day 
And disturb all the boys wliene're they're at play. 
If, when by yourself, you say I'm superficial, 
I'll prove to your cost—I'm a 
police official; 
And if at the time, you're in a 
merry key, 
Down on your back Ill send you with celerity. 
Tol de rol, &c. 
From the " force" with a 
pension I 
soon shall retire 
No matter your feelings, I 
laugh at your ire ; 
For, what your distresses, gives to me pleasure, 
Since the rest of my life wi,
11 be one of leisure. 
It never was said aught but " good information," 
E're was taken by me to any police station; 
And although I'm free now to roam where I 
chose, 
I 
shall ever be known as the " Pride of the Blues."

The Clang of War Rings in the Air. 
The clang of war rings in the air, 
The well known battle cry I 
hear, 
I'll leave my couch and join the throng, . 
The warrior shout and battle song. 
What 
joy, what joy my heart cloth feel, 
Thus fighting for my country's weal;

Then come Sams boys let us go, 
And bravely meet our cOuntry's foe; 
On history's page let this be read,— 
We came, we saw, we conquered. 
Then! grasp the sword, to war arise; 
The victory's ours, the chieftain cries; 
With deadly aim to strike the blow, 
While death's sharp arrow pierce the foe. 
The morning Still looks down on their might; 
Tile setting sun beholds their flight; 
The victor's crown let each one crave. 
Or farless meet the warrior's grave. 
Then come Sams boys let us go, 82. 
The Ship on Fire. 
The storm of the ocean flew furious and fast, 
And the waves rose in foam at the voice of the 
blast, 
And heavily laboured the gale-beaten ship, 
Like a 
stout-hearted swimmer the spray at his lip, 
And dark was the sky o'er the mariner's path, 
Except where the lightning Mimed it in wrath, 
A 
younrz• mother knelt in the cabin below, 
And pressing her babe to her bosom of snow, 
She prayed to her God 'mid the hurricane wild, 
Oh, father have mercy look down on my child.

It passed the fierce whirlwind careered on its way, 
And the ship like an arrow divided the spray, 
The sails glimmered white in the beams of the 
meon 
And the breeze up aloft seemed to whistle a 
tune, 
There was joy in the, ship as she furrowed the 
foam, 
For fond hearts within her were dreaming of home. 
The young mother press'd the fond babe to her 
'breast 
And snug a 
sweet song as she: lull'd it to rest, 
And the husband sat cheerily down by her side, 
And looked with delight on the face of his 'Wide, 
" 
Oh, happy," said he, when our roving is o'er. 
" 
We'll dwell in our cottage that stands by the 
shore, 
Already in fancy its roof I 
descry, 
And the smoke of its hearth curling up to the sky, 
Its gardens so green, and its vine covered wall, 
And kind friends awaiting to welcome us all, 
And the children that sport by the old oaken tree," 
Oh, gently the ship glided over the sea, 
Hark! What was that! Hark, hark to the shout ? 
Fire: fire! then a 
tramp, then a 
rout, 
And an uproar of voices arose in the air, 
And the mother knelt down, and the half-uttered 
prayer, 
That she off,Ted to God in her agony wild, 
Was " Father have mercy, look down on my child." 
She flew to her husband, she clung to his side, 
Oh there was her refuge, whate'er might betide, 
Fire, fire was raging above and below, 
And the cheeks of the sailor's grew pale at the 
sight, 
And their eyes glistened white in the glare of the 
light, 
'Twas vain o'er the ravage the water to dip, 
The pitiless flames was the lord of the ship, 
And the smoke in thick wreathes mounted higher 
and higher,

Be Sure You Call As You Pass By. 
It was a 
rustic cottage gate, 
And over it a 
maiden leant; 
Upon her face and youthful grace 
A 
lover's earnest eye was bent. 
"Good night," she said, " once more, good night 
The evening star is rising high; 
But early with the morning light, 
Be sure you call as you pass by." 
The spring had into summer leapt, 
Brown autumn's hand her treasures threw, 
When forth a 
merry party swept, 
In I 
ridal garments two by two. 
I 
saw it was the maid that bless'd 
The ev'ning star that rose so high ; 
For he, as I've supposed you've guess'd, 
Had often called as he pass'd by. 
Oh, b!issful lot, where all's forgot 
Save love that wreathes the heart with flowers; 
Oh. what's a

Whose only wealth is happy hours:

"Who's Been Here 
A Dollar or Two. 
With cautious steps, as we tread our way through 
Tnis troubl ,-.s.ome world, just as other folks do, 
May we still, on our jouruey, be able to view 
The benevolent face of a 
dollar or two; 
For an excellent thing is a 
dollar or two ; 
No friend sticks so close as a 
dollar or two; 
Through country or town, as you pass up or down, 
No passport as good as a 
dollar or two. 
A 
dollar or two, a 
dollar or two! 
It has a 
magical power to help a 
mdn through; 
The Pagan, the Christian, the Gentile, the Jew, 
All bow with reverence to a 
dollar or two. 
CHORUS. 
Be sure to take care of your money, my boys, 
Be sure and take care of your money; 
For you will find that your friends will be dis-
tant and few„

In last night's dream I 
saw again 
Sweet faces I 
adore, 
'Mid others was an old schoolmate, 
Dear gentle Minnie Moore; 
And glided o'er my dreaming mind, 
Not only those I 
knew,— 
But mem'ries of so many scenes, 
All link'd with Minnie too; 
A 
thousand thoughts of childhood's days, 
Of innocence and glee,— 
For I 
was all the world to her, 
And she the world to me. 
'How oft, -when on our way to school, 
We'd stray beside the brooks, 
And gath'ring wild flow'rs by their side, 
We'd quite forget our books; 
And trifle half the day away, 
In some old mossy dell ; 
And going home at night, I'd coax 
Dear Minnie not to tell. 
Such mem'ries are by far more dear 
Than wealth of classic lore— 
Unfolding thoughts of sunny hours 
Of youth and Minnie Moore.

There stood Jemima Brown.

used to take her, &e. 
She was dealing out potatoes, 
Throwing coppers in the till, 
Three lovely children by her side, 
The image of brother Bill. 
Her broken vow, I

I Am The Jemima Brown. 
(ANSWER TO JEMIMA BROWN.) 
I 
am the Jemima Brown, 
Of whom you've lately heard, 
From a 
blackguard fellow, 
The tale is quite absurd; 
I 
met him once by accident, 
Upon me did intrude, 
Walking, talking by my side, 
Ungentlemanly rude. 
CHORUS. 
He never took me anywhere, 
In or out of town, 
And that's the truth I 
do declare, 
As l'm the Jemima Brown. 
A 
machine for sewing never saw 
Where little things are made; 
With the undermining fellow, 
Never have I 
strayed. 
As to buying gloves for me, 
Yellow, black, or brown, 
Took tea and shrimps never did 
As I'm the Jemima Brown. 
He never took me, &c. 
As to money, never borrowed none, 
Or said you won't be cross, 
My father independent is, 
And never had a 
loss." 
As for my brother, it's untrue, 
lie ever was in town, 
In China nine years he has been, 
As I'm the Jemima Brown. 
He never took me, &c 
As to dealing out potatoes, 
Or marrying a 
Bill, 
Beautiful Segar Girl; or the Mysteries of Broadway' 
An entrancing tale—replete with scenes of love, mystery, murder. ,,

Such a 
person never knew, 
And I'm single still ; 
And I 
never did reside, 
Or was away up town ; 
Or dealt in greens and kidney beans, 
As I'm the Jemiwa Brown. 
He never took me, &c. 
And now the truth I 
will relate, • 
The fellow met one day, 
Trying to enact the swell 
In a 
blackguard way; 
A policeman then walked to him, 
Pointed with a 
frown, 
"This is a 
Sin ,, Sing Man I 
believe," 
As I'm Jemima Brown 
He never took me, &c. 
He then directly went away, 
Gave me a 
roguish stare, 
If gone to Boston or to Bath, 
Confess I 
do not care , 
The impuden: designing knave, 
Thought to do me brown, 
But he was sold, a

From naughty Jetnima Brown,

Will not address himself again

Oh, how could I

you I'll keep 
Why catching the, flats on railway trains to get

Her voice like theirs, was soft and low, 
With music in its tone ; 
Her eyes, like theirs, with tears could flow—

That's Heaven's best, brightest boon; 
Yet said they, lie must faithless prove

But love, when kindred hearts unite, 
Thinks not of alien race,

Where many a 
flask of his best doth go. 
Old Simon reclines in his high-backed chair,

Less rude than the foes we leave frowning behind. 
And I'll gaze on thy gold hair, as graceful it

And hang o'er thy soft harp, as wildly it breathes; 
Nor dread that the cold-hearted Saxon will tear

You and I 
together wander'd in the sunny hours of 
May; 
Softly rAng the linnet's carol, and the murmur of 
the stream 
Floated over hill and meadow, sweet as music in a 
dream. 
Nature, like a 
weird enchanter, breathed o'er all a 
magic spell ; 
Well I 
loved you,—well and fondly,—and you said 
you loved me well. 
And you said you loved me well, Sze. 
Hopes have blossom'd but to wither, joys have 
sprung but to decay, 
Since we wander'd by the lime-trees, in the sunny 
hours of May; 
Ak ! no more the linnet's carol mingles with the 
brook's sweet tone, 
Husli'd and silent are the voices once as joyous as 
our own ; 
But your words I 
still remember, still they haunt 
me like a 
spell, 
And the time seems ever present when you said 
you loved me well.

crinoline as big as old St.

She also wears, to shade her face, one of those 
handsome falls. 
Oh I

And then she wears Balmoral boots, so stylish in 
the heel, 
And when that she is dressed, she does look really 
genteel; 
She's fond of no steel jewellery, and oft says with 
a 
grin, 
her finger it is itching to enter the gold ring. 
Oh dear, oh I &c. 
Now, I 
must go and meet her, or else the bobby 
will, 
And if I

So farewell for the present, I'll take my leave of 
you, 
And the next time I 
come here I'll bring my love-

Though frequent falls the dazzling tear,

scorn to shrink from fate's decree; 
And think not, cruel maid, that e'er

Adieu, my native, &c. 
In vain, through shades of frowning night, 
Mine eyes thy rocky coast explore; 
Deep sinks the fiery orb of light,

Nor night, nor storm, nor death I'fear, 
Unfriended, bear mo hence, to find

A Parlor Blind. 
A 
short time since a 
friend of mine a 
clerk call'd 
Mister Brown, 
Resolv'd on breathing carbon pure by living out 
of town; 
For be it known, his screw was rals'd some 30 dol-
lars a 
year, 
Upon the strength of which a 
Mrs. Brown did soon 
appear. 
He each suburban district search'd week after week 
he tried 
To get a 
house that suited him within an easy 
ride, 
And Brown's ambition always was to get if he 
could find, 
A nice wide parlor window, and a 
nice white par-
lor blind. 
At length he came across a 
row of houses small 
but neat, 
Near Hampstead, likewise Kentish Town, a 
very 
snug retreat, 
Maud the Maniac; or, The Fratricide. 
A romance of overwhelming interest— full of strange incidents.

Since I've Been Gone?"

Exactly built alike they were large windows and 
three fl )ors, 
But the outsides not quite finisled and no numbers 
on the doors. 
The only one to let he took, and half a 
quarter's 
rent 
Paid down as a 
guarantee of future good intent, 
And wanting shortly to go in and not to be be-
hind, 
He took the measure for his wife to make the par-
lor blind. 
A 
fortnight saw them settled down as happy as 
could be, 
At five o'clock Brown regularly toddled home to 
tea, 
Then smoked his mild Havanna with the parlor 
window up, 
And read the news or chatted till the time arrived 
to sup. 
Now 
it happened that a 
nice young man who living 
opposite 
Enjoyed himself the same as Brown, and had a 
perfect right, 
They often met each other's gaze which rankled in 
Brown's mind 
When annoyed at being overlook'd, he'd draw the 
parlor blind. 
At length the gaze of this young man took such a 
hold on Brown, 
And worked him up to such a 
pitch, that often he 
felt down, 
His wife remarked the change in him, but could 
not understand 
That the green-eyed monster jealousy had taken 
him in hand; 
Until one morn he said before he to the office 
went, 
-J 
Temptations and Trials. 
Powerfully written by one who has sounded the depths or wee. 
Price 25 cents. Single copies sent postage free on receipt of price 
68 " Who's Been Here 
These few but simple words which convey'd well 
what he meant; 
They were, " My dear, when I 
am out, I 
hope 
you'll bear in mind 
Under no pretence whatever to draw up the parlor 
blind." 
Now we all know business can't he regulated as it 
might, 
And so thought Brown who at the office had to 
stay one night ; 
When going home and in his street he a 
horrid 
vision saw, 
A handsom cab whizzed past him, and drove up to 
his door, 
A man jumped out and entered house, says Brown, 
" 
who can it be, 
Oh borrible—suspicion, does he want my wife or 
me." 
In a 
small front garden opposite a 
bush be crept 
behind 
To watch the strangers's little game behind the 
parlor blind. 
Brown seeing him divest himself of coat, and hat, 
and gloves, 
Soliloquised, " I 
thought as much, it isn't me she 
loves, 
It's evident another one to her bath equal charms, 
What would I 
for a 
pistol give, or any fire- arms. 
Large drops of perspiration stood like peas upon 
his brow, 
If he only had the villain there, what would he 
give him now, 
While thinking how could woman be so faithless 
and unkind, 
lie saw the man embrace his wife behind the par-
lour blind. 
The more he watched, the hotter the raising was 
his warmth, 
The Mysterious Foundling: or, the Gamesters Fate. 
Shows in striking manner the terrible results of gambling.

For he saw the servant enter and spread the table 
cloth, 
Then bring up something on a 
dish all smoking 
nice and hot, 
Impulsively Brown shouted, " That's my supper, 
Sir, you've got. 
And every mouthful that he took Brown wished it 
might him choke, 
But it didn't, for lie finished it and soon com-
menced to smoke, 
Then mixed a glass of grog, says Brown, " by 
Jove, he seems inclined 
To coolly make a night of it behind the parlor 
blind. 
Brown stand it could no longer now, out in the 
road he came, 
Picked up a 
large macadum stone and hurled it at 
the pane. 
Then crept up to the private-door as quiet as a 
pin, 
The man came out to see the cause, that instant 
Brown popp'd in. 
He rushed into the parlor straight, could more be-
lieve his eyes, 
His wife was nowhere to be seen, and judge of his 
surprise 
On coming to himself a 
bit, and somewhat cool to 
find 
'Twas his next-door neighbor's house, his servant, 
wife, and parlor blind.

The Three Best Irish Romances ever Wrillen, 
PRICE TIVENTY-EIV_E CENTS .EACII 
TEE Pl\TIA.I\T CHIME' ; 
OR, TIIE MARTYR OF '65. 
This hook describes, most graphically, the bold attempt of a 
young, ardent, whole-souled Irishman io assist in freeing his native 
land. 
Mingled with the exciting incidents now progressing in the 
Green Isle, through the efforts of the powerful organization, Fenian-
ism, are some of the most pathetic love passages ever portrayed-
white they in their turn, are chequered by descriptions of rich and 
racy drollery. 
This is a 
book that would find hosts of readers at any 
time—now it will be read by almost everybody. 
SI—TAM -US O'BRIMI\T; 
OR, THE BOULD BOY OF GLENGALL. 
The very title of this hook explains its scope and nature. 
The 
young hero, O'Brien, lives and will ever live in the hearts of his 
countrymen while the green triple-leaved type of immortality and the 
trinity carpets the sod of Old Ireland. 
In this book, the author has 
contrived to give us one of the best books we have ever read in many 
years. 
It is full of stirring incident, of marked character, drawing, 
and the plot is full of rare interest. 
Ott, TIIE WICKLOW WEDDING. 
'Founded on the catch...tett play, by Dlon Boreecault, now performing In the United 
States, Great Britain, anal Australia.] 
The verdict of tens of thousands of unbiased spectators have 
pronounced this play (and consequently this story formed upon it), 
to be one of the most natural and affecting pieces ever produced. 
Never for an instant overstepping the probabilities of real life, it ex-
ceeds in the power of affecting the feelings the most labored produc-
tions of the greatest writers. 
The lovely, artless , 
heroine, Arrah 
Meelish, might stand for the embodiment of the pretty, true-hearted 
Irish ; while Shaun cf the Post. is a 
capital type if the peasant 
class : here too, we have a 
life-like picture of the infernal " informer," 
that creature who has blighted the hopes of Erin's truest sons, and 
crimsoned the scaffold with patriot blood. 
Nor are there wanting 
other and capital characters to enliven and lend interest to the pages 
of " Arrah-na-Pogue," and make every gratified reader wish they 
might be present, cud join in a 
jig at the next " Wicklow Wedding."
