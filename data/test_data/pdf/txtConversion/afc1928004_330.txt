TO THE PUBLIC, 
In again presenting a 
Volume of my Songs 
to the public, I 
desire to express my thanks for 
their very generous support; and hope that I 
may 
still continue, in the future as in the past, to 
please. 
Encouraged by the kind applause of an 
amusement loving public, I 
will put forth renewed 
efforts to please, and merit their approbation, with 
a 
constant supply of my own original productions. 
As to how they have -
pleased heretofore, has been 
well attested in all the principal Cities in the 
United States. 
As to the hereafter, I 
shall leave 
that with my friends, whom, I hope, takes in 
everybody. 
Respectfully 
Yours,

The Conductor with the Patent Bell Punch. 
(New air.) 
Written and composed by SAM DEVERE. 
Respectfully dedica-
ted to CHAS. PATTEE, of Boston. 
Music of this song to be had at Wm. A. POND'S Music store, 547 
Alad way, New York. 
He seems such a 
nice polite young man, 
He's known both near and far, 
fie carries in his hand a 
patent bell punch, 
He's conductor on a 
Flatbush car. 
Such nice curly hair, and a 
blonde mustache, 
And he's got such a 
captivating eye, 
When he helps the ladies to a 
seat in his car. 
They blush and say, oh my. 
CHORUS. 
As he goes through the car to collect his fares, 
Of stamps he carries a 
bunch, 
And he never was known to knock down a 
cent, 
For he carries a 
patent bell punch. 
He says as he waltzes through with a 
smile, 
Your fares now if you please, 
Then he plays you a 
tune on the patent bell 
mch. 
And he makes your change with ease. 
He always keeps his weather eye peeled. 
For the people that he thinks will ride, 
And he's always got that same old cry. 
There's plenty of room inside. 
As he goes throi 
Move right up, there's plenty of room 
Inside, he says with a 
yell, 
And he packs you in like an old sardine, 
Then he gives another yank on the bell. 
They say its a 
fact, and upon my word 
You hardly would believe, 
He carries a 
punch for the rail road company. 
And another for himself in his sleeve. 
As he goes through, ,tc.

The Gal with the Striped Stookinga on. 
(New (

Words and music by SAM DEVERK. 
Copyrighted. I&76, by A. J. Fisuss, Ps Nassau St.. New York. 
'Twas a 
rainy day, I'll nere' forget. 
The prettiest girl that ever I 
met, 
And aS she raised her dress from the wet, 
I 
saw she had striped stockings on. 
The stripes were red, and upon my soul, 
Her shanks were the out of a 
barber's pole. 
In the .heel of one stocking was a 
great big hole, 
The gal with the striped stockings on. 
CHORUS. 
She's always out when the wind blows high. 
If the weather is wet, she'll walk or die, 
Raises her dress as she goes by, 
This gal with the striped stockings on. 
When I 
Saw her zebra stockings there, 
I 
&mid do nothing hut stand and stare, 
But quickly she became aware, 
That I 
saw her striped stockings on. 
She blushed the color of a 
red, red rose. 
Then dropped her eyes, and then her clothes, 
Said, ain't you awful! I 
suppose 
You saw my striped stockings on. 
She's always out. &e. 
I 
liked her style, and thought I'd. tell her, 
She says well now you're a 
real nice feller, 
I 
escorted her home under my urnbrella. 
This gal with the striped stockings on. 
At last we parted in the rain, 
She,. said she hoped we'd meet again. 
She left and took my watch and chain. 
The gal with the striped stockings on. 
She's always out, & c. 
MORAL CHORUS. 
So now when you see a 
pretty charmer on the street, 
With peppermint candy stockings on her pretty little feet, 
Remember I 
was taken in and beat, 
By the gal with the striptA, stockings on.

Dedicated to 
TONY PASTOR. 
Mule or this song to be had at Wm. A. Pomo's Mustc Store, U7 
Broadway, new York. 
I'm going to tell you what I 
know 
Of a 
nice society, 
The ladies, almost every one, 
Declare they are N. G. 
But you're expected at your post 
At every dress parade, 
To stand outside the theatre door 
With the Matinee Brigade. 
CHORUS. 
There on the mesh, stuffed witty hash. 
Cheeks as hard as rocks! 
There on the street from morn ' till night. 
And never change their socks. 
All in a 
line, rain or shine, 
These rosebuds all parade! 
They stand for ladies to admire 
In tile Matinee Brigade! 
Jawdge, and Chawles and Jerome u.re there, 
Got up with wondrous skill; 
And when they wink their naughty eye 
It never falls to kill. 
With ten cent canes and dizzy suits 
By a 
sheeny tailor made, 
The choicest plums in all the land 
Are the Matinee Brigade. 
There on the mash, (to. 
They always strike an attitude 
To give themselves a 
tone, 
They live on love and Dutch free lunch, 
And smell of bad cologne! 
I'll bet two cents if the truth was known 
Their wash-bills wasn't paid: 
But nobody knows how bard they mash 
In the Matinee Brigade! 
There on the mash. ,te.

Written and composed by SAM DEVERE, and sung with im-
mense success by him. 
I 
met my gal on Fulton street 
The other afternoon, 
With her dress pinned back in a 
great big bunch— 
As big as a 
balloon! 
When I 
asked her what the trouble was 
She seemed in such distress, 
Says she—" Oh Sam! don't be a 
fool, 
That's my new pull-back dress I" 
CHORUS. 
But didn't she wear a 
pull-back! 
Oh, didn't she wear a 
pull-back! 
'Twould do you good, I 
know it would, 
To see my gal with a 
pull-back I 
Says she—" Oh Sam, for gracious' sake 
Now don't act like a 
gawk, 
A 
two inch step is all I 
take 
When I 
go out for a 
walk !" 
When I 
asked her if her bunions pained, 
She says, " I 
rather guess 
You're not much posted—that's the way 
We walk in a 
pull-back dress!" 
But didn't she wear, Ltc, 
Says she, " there's not a 
style you know 
I 
ever let escape! 
I 
like to pin my pull-back tight— 
It shows my handsome shape! 
The ,grass- hopper walk is all the rage, 
It's everywhere the go! 
You've got to wear a 
pull back dress 
If you want to make a 
show !" 
But didn't she wear, kc.

A 
friend is a 
thing that is handy, 
When he is in need, 
If always ready to help you, 
He is a 
friend indeed. 
So now remember when you're broke, 
And don't know what to do, 
Take your coat up to your uncle, 
And borrow a 
dollar or two. 
CHORUS. 
Take it right tip to your uncle, 
He will never tell 
Of the dollar or two that he loans you, 
lie will use you well. 
If you have got a 
coat or vest, 
No matter old or new, 
Take it right up to your uncle, 
He'll loan you a 
dollar or two. 
You'll see a 
young man from the country, 
Who is just getting over a 
spree, 
He's broke, he's spent all his money 
A 
regular jam ooree; 
He says you kw 
those naughty girls, 
They've cleaned me through and through, 
So I'll take my coat up to my uncle, 
And borrow a 
dollar or two. 
Take it right up. & c. 
There's the fellow who feels pretty lucky, 
To make a 
winning he'll try, 
Goes into the faro bank smiling, 
Comes out with a 
tear in his eye; 
He says that's what I 
call tough luck, 
Not enough to buy a 
stew, 
I'll take my coat up to my uncle, 
And borrow a 
dollar or two. 
Take it right up, itc.

Sweet-Scented Handsome Young Man, 
(

Written and composed by SAM DEVERE. and sung by him 
with immense success. 
Copyrighted 1s7(3, by A. J. Fist:LER. CPS Nassau St.. New York. 
There's a 
sweet-scented handsome young man in this town. 
His name is Theophilus Aristides Brown. 
With weak-minded females he's gained some renown, 
This sweet- scented handsome young man. 
He's as dainty as a 
butterfly, and in colors as gay, 
And flutters from corner to corner all day. 
He's too sweet for anything, that's what the girls say. 
Of this sweet- scented handsome young man. 
He wears a 
red neck- tie, his complextion is fair, 
Straight down from the middle he parts his blonde hair. 
He skips o'er the gutter like a 
thing made of air, 
This sweet- scented handsome young man. 
There's a 
few straggling hairs upon his upper lip. 
His legs are the size of a 
two cent tallow dip. 
He looks like a 
chicken that's just had the pip, 
This sweet- scented handsome young man. 
If caught in the rain he would surely expire, 
Gotten up expressly for girls to admire. 
He could jump through a 
sieve without touching a 
wire. 
Could this sweet-scented handsome young man. 
He wears a 
red neck 
To break the girls' hearts is his object 'twould seem, 
By day its his hobby, by night its his dream; 
His chief food is sponge cake, root beer and ice cream, 
This sweet-scented dainty young man. 
Such eftiminate young men may be all very fine, 
Their attention all clear headed girls will decline 
I'll be darn'd if he could man-y 
any sister of mine. 
No such sweet-scented handsome young man. 
He wears a 
red neck tie. ,te.

THE HYPOCHONDRIAC, 
RUDOLPH SHTINGLEBROSE, 
or the Man that could never got well, 
Written and sung by SA 
NI DEVERE. 
A 
once knew_ a 
fellow who never was well. 
He was always complaining of ills, 
For ever and ever be never was done 
Of swallowing boxes of pills. 
He'd wake in the night, and yell at his wife 
To jump out of bed and be quick. 
And make him a 
plaster, and get him some pill. 
He knew he was going to be sick. 
CHORUS, 
'Twas pills, pills from morning till night. 
What ailed him he never could tell; 
He took all the medicine ever was known. 
But still he could never get well. 
If a 
cold or a 
pain in the stomach he got, 
'Twould scare him so he could'nt speak; 
He'd jump into bed—eat nothing but pills. 
And poultice his head for a 
week. 
His wife, poor woman, was nearly wore out. 
He always kept her on the run. 
She swore sho'd go to the druggists' no more, 
So he bought in his pills by the ton. 
'Twas pills, pills, kc. 
Its ended at last, his troubles are o'er, 
There is many a 
poultice to make: 
He got up one night with a 
cramp in his heel. 
To try and find something to take. 
But that was the last of him ever was seen, 
He skirmished without any light: 
He swallowed some nitro glycerine, 
Which blowed the poor man out of sicr..ht. 
'Twas pins, pills, & e..

NEW AIR 
Its a 
hundred years ago, 
Since first we struck the blow. 
Which caused among all tyrants consternation. 
We took them by surprise, 
And it opened up their eyes, 
When we issued that famous declaration. 
We then were weak and small, 
But DOW we top them all, 
As a 
nation we are classed in first positic,n. 
With our solid common sense, 
As a 
country we'-e 
immense, 
And we'll prove it at our Centennial Exposition. 
Then give it loud and long for the greatest land on earth, 
Three cheers for this great American nation. 
Its just a 
hundred years since she gave to freedom birth. 
So we'll have a 
big Centennial celebration. 
They'll come from near and far, 
Over water and by car, 
Our industries and productions to examine. 
They'll find we have enough, 
Of the life sustaining stuff, 
And a 
little to spare for all in case of famine. 
They may think we're all ajar. 
Through our late unpleasant war, 
When some foolish men this union tried to sever. 
But they'll find its passed and o'er, 
And we're enemies no more. 
North and South just as solid now as ever. 
Then give it loud, & c. 
We've invited all the earth 
To the land of freedom's birth 
And their handywork to send along a 
sample. 
Then let them come along 
In forces good and strong 
And they'll find that the room for all is ample. 
With all we will compete 
And they'll find us hard to beat 
To all we'll show a 
friendly disposition. 
Then extend a 
welcome hand 
To those from every land 
Who may visit our Centennial Exposition. 
Then give it loud. kc

FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE, 
BANJO SOLO. 
(New air.) 
Written and composed by SAM DEVERE. 
Deception just now is the rule all around, 
Its practiced in all shades of life; 
Just mind what I 
say, and be careful my friends, 
When the time comes to pick out a 
wife. 
Her eyes may be loving, her smile may be sweet, 
When you approach her she's timid and afraid: 
Be careful look well before making the leap, 
You don't know how the dear girl is made. 
in the good days of old, in our grand-mothers' time, 
Girls did'nt enamel or paint; 
Didne wear palpitators their bosoms to swell, 
Didnt' lace themselves up till they'd faint; 
Didn't wear patent calves, or use bloom of youth, 
And the rose in their cheeks di'dnt fade: 
You must know a 
girl well now before you get stuck, 
For she's fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Girls long ago didnt' pencil their brows, 
Use lotions to make the skin fair; 
The girls long ago combed the hair on their heads, 
Now its combed on the back of a 
chair. 
I 
got more to tell when I 
see you alone, 
I 
have said too much here I'm afraid, 
But betore you get married, examine them well, 
For they're fearfully and wonderfully made.

And the two I 
set my eyes on, 
Was the great big Colonel Kane 
And the spunky Henry Tyson. 
Colonel said " let's take a

Henry said he wasn't lame, 
He thought he was able to walk 
Without the aid of " Kane." -

Kabler's drawn so many an; 
And driven so many -stakes,

Than pas: another year tryin_, 
To straighten '• Jones' Falls."

You'll never straighten " Jones' Falls

Washington, I). C. 
WE are the pluck,- 
little " Team" 
Of Yankee Shooteleers, 
Who marched ;. way t. Dollymount 
An I

We score 1 
a " bull's-eye" every pop, 
Or nine times out of ten, 
And won a 
Cup of Friendship from 
Wtsrm-heartecI Irishmen. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, we're the boys to shoot, 
And never miss the mark; 
We often have, with ease, put out 
A 
candle in the dark. 
We've shot with Lord and Duke, 
With nobleman and Prince, 
And some really do believe 
We've been " shot" ever since. 
March.— 
Mark time! left foot! 
St-ady on the right! 
We can beat creation when the target is In sight. 
Hey foot 1

From Irish hospitality 
We marched with deer, regret, 
For " Wimbledon," to try out uc 
With England; but, you bet, 
Old Johnny Bull was in no mood

chance; 
Someyears ago a Bunker Hill, 
Our " shots" made Johnny dance. 
Chorus.—Oh, we're, &a 
It seemed too bad to march away 
Without a 
sin le show, 
So Captain asked for just ote turn, 
Ad 
promised them to go. 
They picked the best men in the land 
To shoot for Cousin John, 
But next day we for Scotland marched, 
And took the Cup along. 
Chorus.-01i, we're, &c. 
In Scotland—so the peo le said— 
We'd learn a 
thing or too; 
They pro ;used, in a 
boasting way, 
To show what " Scots " could do. 
And so they did! 
With might and main 
They tr ed their very best, 
But that same night their little Cup 
We packed up with the rest. 
Chorus.-0h, we're, &c. 
And now we're safely horn again; 
No place like home to me. 
Some t 
ink we're looking better since 
We crossed the stormy sea; 
Perhaps we look a 
little dark 
From sunshine on the sand, 
Or, like the " Teams" on t'other side, 
Perhaps we're rather " tanned."

KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP. 
Written and composed by SAM DEVERE. 
THERE has something gone wrong, 
My brave boy, it appears, 
For I 
see your proud struggle 
To keep back the tears : 
That is right, when you cannot 
Give trauble the slip, 
Then bear it, still keeping 
A 
stiff upper lip! 
Though you cannot escape 
Disappointment and care 
The next best thing to do, 
Is to learn how to bear 
If when for life's prizes 
You're running, you trip, 
Get up—start again, 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip! 
Let your hands and your conscience 
Be honest and clean, 
Scorn to touch or to think of 
The thing that is mean; 
But ho 'd on to the pure 
And the right with firm grip, 
And though hard be the task, 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip! 
Thro -gh childhood, through manhood, 
Through lifc to the end. 
Struggle bravely and stand 
By your c-
olors, my friend, 
Only yield when you must, 
Never " Give up the ship," 
But fight to the last 
With a 
stiff upper lip!

A DREAM, 
Sung wit! great success by Sem DEVERE. 
I 
WAS dreaming last night, I 
was dreaming, 
Ad my dr am I 
xill now tell to you, 
I 
thought that . e 
world had been altered, 
And everything made over new ; 
I 
thought that an honest mechanic 
Was as good as a 
rich man could be, 
And thoug a 
girl worked for a 
living, 
No lady was better than she; 
I 
thought that our city was governed 
By men who belon ed to no ring, 
And when a 
man murdered another, 
If guilty he surely must swing. 
I 
dreamed that our po r 
working women, 
Were allowed by their labors to live, 
And blood-sucking, thieving employers, 
Fa r 
wages for work had to give ; 
We had ,. 0 
more heart-broken outcasts, 
Every girl led a 
good, honest life, 
And a 
you g 
man respected a 
female 
As he did his own mother or wife; 
I 
thotrht there were no brutal husbands 
To keep their wives always in fear, 
It a 
man raised his arm to a 
woman, 
Every blow sent him up for a 
year. 
VitsdAllk% 
I 
dreame1 that tyrannical England 
Was forced to set Ireland free, 
And that the star-spangled banner now floated 
O'er the Emerald Isle of the sea; 
I 
thought too that poor little Cuba, 
To America always so true, 
Was rid ot Spanish cruel oppression 
By Uncle Sam's brave boys in blue 
I 
thought the who'e wurld was rejoicing, 
And every cne happy did seem, 
I 
awoke with a 
sad disappointment 
To find that t'was only a 
dream,

She's come to town to look around, 
To sing the jubilo. 
She had a 
bonnet on her head 
That was in the revolution, 
She had to teeth to chew her bread, 
She was tough as any Russian. 
She had a 
sorrel old gray horse, 
He had the clampus vitus, 
And when she'd holler hal-le-lu, 
He'd kick up like the riteous„

And hollered welcome sister. 
'Twas joyfu', joyful, hail de news, 
When Chloe told de story, 
It melted all de rubber shoes, 
Jemima shouted dory.

My little Lizzie Bell.

it was to me a

Thinking of the fun me and Lizzie had 
When yachting in the stream ; 
I 
used to sing her my pretty song 
Of yachting in the bay, 
She used to tell me it was delightful, 
And thought it very gay,

THE BROOKLYN FERRY. 
Written and composed by SA.31 DRTZRE. Dedicated to O&M 
E. Sum, kark Theatre. 
Copyright, 1875, by A..1. FISHER. 
I'LL give you my experience now, just as it all cccurred, 
On one of the Bruoklyn terry boa: s, and what I 
saw and heard, 
The high, the low, the riclx and poor, tog ther all did ride, 
Their standing in society there was qrrickly pushed aside, 
Ladies there in costly dress and mo.e with a 
faded shawl, 
Some had bun.iles, some had babies, some had nothing at all; 
Some were there on bus ness b,nt, and more were there on 
pleasure, 
Such curious crowds you'll always find on these ferry boats to-
gether. 
CHORUS. 
From millionaire to beg at, all were represented there, 
Rushing through the ferry house, paying down the fare; 
Some with faces pa'e and sad, and others making merry, 
Such sights you'll see most every day while crossing Brooklyn 
ferry. 
Jinie goes the pilot's bell which tells the engineer 
To put the wheels in motion, that the river front is clear; 
The machinery once in motion from the slip she'll smoothly 
glide, 
It is a 
pleasant trip in summer time to cross from either 
aids. 
Chorus.—From millionaire, Scc 
There's a 
cabin set apart for gents of whcih they're- 
much in 
need, 
Fur those who are inclined to smoke to enjoy the fragrant 
w el; 
But in the ladies' cabin there the fair sex, I 
suppose, 
Enjoy themselves as ever lioking at each others clothes. 
Chorus.—From mil ionaire, &c. 
A 
Long Island farmer sat opposite me with a 
home-spun suit 
of clothes, 
Reading a ally pa, er through the specs upon his nose; 
lie seemed to enjoy the s 
randal trial and showed it with some 
Force, 
When he stamp d 
upon his neighbor's corns and laughed till 
he was hoarse. 
Passengers standing here and there, in little knots together, 
Some were talking pc) itics and more about the weather, 
Some about the Brooklyn Bridge and others making merry, 
And so the time was quickly passed crossing the Brooklyn 
terry.

OFF YOUR NUT.*

Written and composed by Si nEvEsE, 
AS bye- words now are all the go, I'm going to give you one, 
It's used by all, both large and small, you'll hear it on every 
tongue, 
An urchin hails you in the street with " Mister. shine 'em up ?" 
HJ 
wants ten cents, you offer him live, he sass, '
Cully, you're 
off your nut.' 
A 
carriage, a 
carriage, a 
hackman cries, till Ills face gets awful 
red, 
He's anxious to make a 
dollar or two before he roes to bed: 
You ask him to drive you around the town and lan you right 
side up, 
He winks his eye at his pal. so sly, saying " That roster is off 
his nut." 
There's your German tailor too, who makes such stylish 
clothes, 
What would we do without the man, why surely nobody 
knows; 
He mak s 
3 
ou a 
suit that's had to beat, the latest Parisian 
cut, 
If you te I 
him you'll pay in a 
week he'll say, " I 
don't got oil 
my nut." 
If on the street you chance to meet a 
friend who has been on a 
spree, 
His hat smashed in, his head swelled up, a 
real old " jam-
. 
boree; ' 
His clothes are soiled, he's got the shakes, perhaps he's bruised 
and cut, 
He says, " You know how it is yourself, I'm a 
little off my 
nut." 
Now friends if you'll take my advice, it may do you some 
good, 
I 
wont in% advise you wrongully, nor wouldn't if I 
could, 
Don't drink too much or stay out nights or you never will have 
any luck, 
You'll ruin your: elf in both cash and health and go clean off 
your nut.

This " Off Your Nut" has been a

A 
DAMSEL I 
met, oh! how can I 
describe her, 
She looked like an angel just shorn of her wings, 
I 
braced myself up and walked close up beside her, 
And thought her just then the most lovely of things. 
Her step was so graceful, her smile so bewitching, 
I 
was quite a: a 
loss what to say, I 
confess, 
When she dropped a 
small handkerchief and worked in silk 
stitching 
In one corner the letters " C. L A. M. S." 
But C. L. A. M. 'S. I 
couldn't understand, 
What could a 
cieature fair as she have to do with clams, 
The answer that she gave me when I 
asked her to explain. 
Was Clara Louisa Anna Maria Snifkins is my name. 
This little white handkerchief I 
quickly recovered, 
And then I 
approached her to make known her loss, 
Said I 
beg pardon, Miss, but by chance I 
discove:ed 
You drop this on the corner when going to cross. 
On, thank you, kind sir, said this model of beauty, 
And the smile that she gave I 
shall never forget,, 
I 
resolved there to vrla her and thought it my duty 
To make love right away, which I 
did, you can bet. 
Chorus.--Ent, &O. 
When I 
told her I 
loved her she declared I 
was bold, 
But smiled when I 
said it and looked very pleased, 
Then told me her husband was rich and quite old. 
And I 
drew her up closer and gave her a 
squeeze. 
I 
shall never forget though, the reception she gave me, 
When I 
called at a 
house this fair dam-sel to meet. 
She took all my cash then declared I 
was crazy, 
And a 
bouncing young man bounced me out in the street. 
Chorns.-13nt, 4ke. 
Now, some one das said it, at least so I'm told, 
Whoever it was they were wonderful wise, 
That all you see glittering is surely not gold,— 
Oh! what would I 
give if I 
had two such eyes. 
Experience, they say, is the greatest•of teachers, 
So I 
suppose I 
shall have to go clear through the mill, 
To be up to the tricks of these angelic creatures, 
Made up of paint, powder, and feathers and frill.

PATENT RUBBER _BUSTLE. 
Written and Sung by SIM. DEvEas 
AS fashions now are all the rage, 
Every day brings a 
new sensation, 
I'll sing to you of Hannah AleGlue,' 
She was a 
dressmaker by occupation; 
She had a 
big brother, Sam, who peddled fish and clams, 
And oysters, likewise muscles, 
Till a 
happy thought struck him he gave up the fish. 
And invented a, patent rubber bustle. 
Now Sam, to give his bustle a 
trial, 
Tried the first one he made on Hannah; 
The very first day she went to promenade 
She slipped on the peel of a 
banana. 
She no sooner struck the ground than she made a 
rebound, 
And landed on the back of Dicky Russell; 
Old Dicky got scared, and the boys all stared 
At the gal with the funny rubber bustle, 
Now the boys yelled loud, and then a 
great crowd 
Soon gathered around poor Hannah; 
A 
policeman flew at Hannah McGlue, 
And used her in an awful 'rough manner; 
But she made one slip and broke from his grip, 
After having with him quite a 
tussle; 
She bounced out of sight like a 
little paper kite, 
This gal with a 
funny rubber bustle. 
Now, when Sam heard Hannah had hounded out of sight, 
lie yelled and cried out loud; 
Then he made him a 
bustle twice as big as hers, 
And swore that he'd find her in a 
cloud. 
Then lw jumped from the top of a 
blacksmith shop, 
And bounced from the ground with a 
rustle, 
That was the last seen of Sam who used to peddle clams, 
And invented the patent rubber bustle.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want f. equently felt by young people—a 
want of means of

Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen iho are either too diffs 
dent or too tearful of a 
tepulse. to s 
moire u n 
esking the mom 
ntous 
question. The lady is restrained, by citetom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from deceng anything that would seem to be en un'ady-like encourage-
neut. As a 
result en this dilemma, many lives are seeut as an unloved 
tedious existence, ve hien might have been pro owe] and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being iu the shape of questions and ale wers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affection-, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players,

it to our young iady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encoarago the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how. when ancl 
whereto i/o it. ' 
nil this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting.",

of every moth n

As there 
is nothing at all objectioeable in the volume. and 'ts contents might af-
