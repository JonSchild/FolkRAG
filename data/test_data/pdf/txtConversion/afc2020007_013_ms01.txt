Just we're talking to Jim Hirsch at Air Tractor in Olney, Texas on June 15. And we are excited. Time 
10:47. You got, you and Jack were just talking about, like the technical thing. So you came at this 
from being an engineer is that…? 
JH: Yeah, so my dad taught Civil Engineering at Texas A&M. So I'm the son of an engineer, and as I 
got out of high school and worked and did some other things in Oldfield, I got interested in flying 
and started flying. Always was mechanically inclined, had to know more about what made this 
airplane work. And in the mid- to late-‘80s, got back into school, and finished an aerospace 
engineering degree at Texas A&M. And in early 1992, after I just graduated, came here. By that 
time I had owned, started in and owned and sold the business to go back to school, and was a pilot 
flying tailwheel airplanes and also had a aircraft mechanics license and a brand new engineering 
degree to go with it. 
EK: So did you grow up around here? 
JH: No, actually, I'm I was born and raised in Bryan College Station at the university. I lived within 
a mile of Caulfield, the first 32 years of my life. So from College Station. 
EK: So how did you get here? 
JH: So it's, that's an interesting flying story, actually. I'm about to graduate. I'm working on 
finishing an instrument rating. And my flight instructor was also a civil engineering professor. I 
had known the man since I was a young guy. He worked with my father and said, Doc, ya’ know, 
after we'd been flying one day, what am I gonna do? I'm back to graduate with this engineering 
degree. I've interviewed with Bell, I've got an opportunity to go to Seattle and go to Boeing. I'm not 
sure either one of those really fit what I want to do. I've sent resumes to all these little airplane 
companies, like Piper, or Cessna, or Mall or some of them. And he said, Jim, there's a fella that your 
father and I graduated with and his name is Leland Snow, and he's in Texas, buildin’ airplane 
somewhere, go find  him and I bet you'd be a perfect fit. So I went to my dad's office, got the 
directory of former students and looked him up. And sure enough, there’s Leland Snow, Rockwell 
commander, all knew Texas. So I fired a cover letter and a resume up here, and in a week or 10 
days, was able to talk to him on the phone. And he invited me up for an interview. So I climbed in 
a, oh at the time I was I helped put myself through school doing maintenance on the Aggie flying 
club airplane fleet. So I crawled into a 172 and flew up here. And before the day was over, he 
offered me a job. And that's how I got to Olney, Texas. 
EK: What year was that? 
JH: That was February of 1992. I started early March of ’92 here. As a as a quote, Project Engineer 
doing whatever Mr. Snow needed me to do from analysis to, and he wanted me to start flying these 
airplanes quickly. And did, did that. So I've been very fortunate, got to do a lot of different things 
here. from engineering work, analysis drawings, to test flyin’ airplanes to doing production test 
flight on a handful of airplanes a long time ago. And just a whole interworking, we were a little 
smaller back then, than we are now. Yeah, at that time, there was only three full-time engineers on 
staff and a draftsman. And, and I, one of those engineers was the founder and the president Mr. 
Snow, you know, he led the engineering department at that time as well. So… 
EK: How many are there now? 
[0:05:15] 
JH: Fourteen. And three draftsman. So yep, we, we keep growing. Yep. And building more 
airplanes. You talked earlier about the passion. It, I didn't know much about ag aviation. College 
Station is a place where it happens, right? There's a lot of cotton in that Brazos River Valley, down 
there. And I knew some people just through the flying community that were associated with ag 
aviation, and some, in some way or another, but I really knew nothing about the industry. Till I 
came here already had that man machine passion, and that it evolved to the ultimate machine, the 
airplane. And then, you know, working with Leland and his passion for the industry instilled it into 
me and I became active pretty quickly in NAAA. Learned immensely Leland blessed that idea of 
getting in a little airplane and going on field trips to see ag operators and understand how it 
worked. So got opportunities to do a lot of that. I'm not an ag pilot. I sprayed just a little bit one 
summer with USDA in research. It was not hard work spraying and like what our customers 
actually do. It was make a couple of passes while the ground crew collects engineering data on 
spray patterns and drift studies and things of that nature. So but, but it was just enough to, to 
understand that, yeah, you're low, you're going pretty fast across the field, and things come up out 
of the ground pretty quickly. Goin, going across… 
JK: Not a lot of time for problem solving at that altitude.  
JH: Right. Yep. So anyway, that's kind of the quick version of the story how I got here. And here we 
are still 29 and a half years later.  
EK: It goes fast doesn’t it? 
JH: It does go fast, it goes way too fast. Still have a passion. You know, Leland's passion was just 
brought out every day. But I realized after he was gone, and, and I took over that we really didn't 
have a clearly defined mission here. Everybody inherently knew what he was. But I took some 
time and started thinking about that, and went and wrote it down. We're here to do our part, 
through airplanes and services, to help feed and protect the world. That's why we come to work 
every day, do our little part to help feed and protect the world. 
EK: It's much bigger, I think, than anyone knows, don't you? 
JH: Could, could well be, you know, we get, we get pretty tied up and focused just on what we're 
doing here to get the airplanes built and serve our industry. And sometimes we don't see that 
bigger picture as clearly as maybe we should, but we keep doing it. 
JK: However, someone looking at the news, watch the news about wildfires, they see a SEAT 
[Single Engine Air Tanker]. And that SEAT came from here. 
JH: And that, and that makes us all around here really proud to see that right, on, on the evening 
news to see some guys in airplanes that we built right here, putting out some fires or helping some 
people. 
JK: A little known, I don't think many people know about the, you know, the drug interdiction 
work. 
JH: Right. 
JK: I don't, I don't think hardly anybody. I mean, even crop dusters don't know you have a 
militarized version of the 802, you know, that they use down in South America. 
JH: Right. So that that was an interesting program is that evolved. It actually dates back to the ‘80s. 
In… 
EK: Oh, the Reagan era. Wouldn't that be Ronald Reagan? 
JH: Yeah, yes, I suspect I suspect you're right. The State Department wanted to get that work 
underway, and actually put out a request for proposal. And Leland told me that he responded to it, 
his Air Tractor, and he knew the competitor, the Thrush guys, responded to it well, Leyland 
actually thought that, that Air Tractor would win that. And he actually developed a new airplane 
just for it. Which was the 503 in the mid- to late-‘80s. And it turned out in the end, the Thrush guys 
won. So there weren't very many of those airplanes built. And, it all went quiet for a while and 
they sold some airplanes and provided some support. And the US government took them to 
Columbia and sprayed narcotic crops and they also modified some old OB-19 Broncos to do spray 
work down there as well. Time passes and attrition and various other factors and come around 
2000, late ‘90s or 2000, they approached us, the State Department guys approached us again says 
you guys got this new big 802 airplane, we're really interested in it, we need to upgrade our fleet 
in Columbia. So there was another request for proposals and we submitted and, and once again 
went on a program to modify and customize an airplane to meet their specific need. And and we 
won with the 802 and over the years we built them 17,18 airplanes for planned Columbia in added 
defensive armor to protect a pilot in the cockpit from lighter arms, small arms fire and, and the 
same around the engine and for the engine compartment. So yeah, that's been, that's kind of the 
story of how that evolved. It's been quite fascinating as we've had opportunity to get to know 
some of the pilots and of course, the maintenance folks that take care of those airplanes. And we 
keep working with those folks still today. 
[00:12:13] 
EK: Who are those pilots? They're not, like the pilots are they military people or…? 
JH: Most of them. were formerly ag pilots that decided to take the adventure to go to Columbia and 
spray ag in, down there and help the Columbia National Police and US State Department fight war 
on drugs. The program now, the State Department has gotten the Colombians to take it over. So 
the Colombian National Police run it now and all the pilots are Colombian pilots now. 
EK: So when you do something like that, like how do you know what modifications to make? Do 
you ask the pilots?  
JH: Absolutely.  
EK: I mean, you're an engineer, so obviously… 
JH: We worked with the State Department guys, we worked with those pilots, we worked with the 
guys, the pilots that flew the thrushes, you got to do your homework, right, that's what it boils 
down to is getting in and doing the research. Understanding what they really need. And of course, 
the State Department did all that too, and, and sent us a specification, the list of this is what we'd 
really like. So you take that and, and refine it a little bit and read it based on knowledge that you 
gain from talking to, of course them and others to submit the proposal. And, you know, in the end, 
I don't remember what it was it was something on the order of 30 different changes to the 
airplane to help customize it specific for their mission. 
EK: I asked because it, when we talk to the pilots, it seems they, they all, they all seem to have a 
personal relationship with Air Tractor. And, you know, the ones that that are just small business 
owners. And, and like when we said we were going to do this, they're like, you know, they name 
names and they're excited and, and which is not really that common, when it comes to you know, 
my guess it's just not, it's not the usual thing for there, with the customer and the manufacturer to 
have a relationship. You know, there's so many steps in between in the rest of the world that I was, 
I was amazed. 
JH: So it's a small world that ag aviation lives in one. Two, we've always been very customer 
service focused. That's one of the huge keys to our success. And we need that feedback too from 
them. To understand what it is we need to do to the airplane to make it better. What it is that is 
there, the biggest thorn in their side every day while operating this airport, or airplane, so we can 
see if there's some change we can make, to make their life easier. And, and help them do their job 
better. Whether it's, you know, one of the things we did, when I first came here was put air 
conditioning in the airplane, before the ‘90s, these things didn't have air conditioning in them. You 
know that was a pretty significant one. But there are a lot of little ones too, from, where the little 
control for this, that or other piece of equipment is and how that operates. We're always really 
interested in their input. And of course, the association is a great venue to help facilitate that 
communication back and forth. And you know, a lot of them really enjoy coming here to pick up 
their new airplane. And that's a great opportunity to learn something from them, as well. 
[00:16:25] 
EK: So when they come to pick up their new planes, do you like, sit down and talk to them and, and 
get acquainted?  
JH: Yeah, we try to. You know, every situation is a little different, right? Whether this, that and 
another they need to get in, get in and get out or, yep, we've got a little time, let's get a tour of the 
plant and, and have a chance to go eat lunch or and visit and learn something. You know, if we can, 
if we've got that opportunity, we'll take it. And it's not just me. It's a lot of folks around here that 
that help us with that process of listening?  
EK: Yeah. 
JK: I noticed, one of the first things I noticed the first time I, I worked on an Air Tractor, because 
I've done I've done a little radio work. 
JH: Right. Okay.  
JK: I'm not certified without, of course, according to the FAA, you don't need to be certified to do 
certain things. And I noticed that every, pretty much every component, somebody thought. About 
a lot of systems I've gotten into, you can tell that, you know, there was one sub team and they 
worked on this component group and another team worked on this component group. And then 
they might have I don't know, gotten drunk and decided to slam them both together. But I noticed 
that in an Air Tractor, every component just fits, it's really well thought-out maintenances has 
been considered on every aspect. 
JH: We try to do that, we try to keep doing that. We're not always 100 percent successful, because 
there are things that are, that are a little harder than maybe they ought to be. But, but it is. It is a 
goal of ours to make it easy, these things easy to maintain, you know, I realize ag pilots have to 
have an airplane that when they get up in the morning, to provide the 911 service to the crop, 
they're going to protect from some insect or fungal or whatever pest. It's got to start, it's got to go 
and it's got to do the job. It has to be very dependable. That's one of the reasons why the turbine 
engine is been such a great success because it is so dependable compared to the recip radials. But 
yeah, we try to keep it simple, simple. And we try to design it to be maintainable as well. 
JK: Yeah, I I did notice that I will say it’s the first thing I noticed when I pull panels off instead of 
using fancy aviation, you know, wire looms and stuff you use zip ties. Well, that makes perfect 
sense to me. It just seemed like, and hadn't you know, the reliability is a huge factor. I pretty much 
every pilot we've talked to has some story about losing a jug on Pratt and Whitney… 
JH: [Laughs] Yeah, on one of the old radials. 
JK: You know, Kevin was flying a Pawnee and that was before they had the AD on the carb heat on 
that engine and so he he lost his carb because you know, flange came off and got separated in the 
venturi at So, yeah, the reliability I think is probably a huge issue. 
JH: Yes, huge. 
[00:20:01] 
EK: I was listening to you and forgot what I was thinking. 
JK: It got kind of technical there for a second.  
JH: Yeah. So, you know, the people part of the business though is is one of the favorite ones if, if we 
can figure out how to better help our customers do their job and do what they do better we’re, 
we’re, we want to be all about that. So yeah, 
EK: They are simple people. We have discovered that even the ones who are well educated or who 
you know, are some of them have flown corporate and, and you know, they've gone as far but they 
always come back to… 
JH: Yeah, it is interesting how diverse the backgrounds of a lot of these pilots, as you look around 
the community is. One of our past dealers was a integrated circuit engineer before he started 
flying and, and spraying. 
EK: So I don’t forget my questions. 
JK: Well Dusty, out of Nevada, he, he was a rodeo cowboy. I mean, he was on… 
JH: Right.  
JK: He was on a rodeo show on CMT. And then I know there's, there's a boy flying out of Central 
Oklahoma, who's PBR bullfighter. 
JH: Right. He's been here I remember meeting him.  
JK: Yeah, we haven't gotten around to him yet. I'd like to meet him. I think he's, he's pretty good 
friends with Dusty. Just did that rodeo scene, you know, right. But then of course, I don't know 
Kevin's background. I think Kevin was probably born in a cockpit. That's all he does. 
EK: Yeah. We tried to interview Matt Peed. And he's a busy, busy man. We finally got him like, 
nailed down and his internet was messing up and ours was and we had to abort it. But, but from 
what I can tell on his social media, he does a lot of training with, like the transition to turbine 
flying, 
JH: Right. Yep, I don't know, Matt. Personally, have you… 
[Undecipherable, cross talk.] 
EK: He does? I'm sorry, I'm sorry I mentioned his name then. Though we do know where the 
Thresh began. [Laughter.] 
JH: Yeah, it is. It is an industry… 
JK: Most we have talked to who have flown both the Thrush and and Air Tractor. They like the Air 
Tractor. You know, they say the Thrush is a little quicker on the ferry. But when you're actually 
down spraying, they love the Air Tractor. 
JH: Well, I have these memories from NAAA conventions with Leland for many years and there'd 
be a group of guys that kind of gathered around and you know, it was a tendency you're in front of 
the founder in the leader of Air Tractor, right? To maybe not be so kind to those Thrush guys, 
right? Maybe to offer some critical comment why you know, that Thrush doesn’t blah, blah, blah, 
or whatever it is. And I just remember this from several instances, Leland stopping him and 
saying, Ah, guys, careful. Don't forget I designed Air Tractors just to thrash out all the mistakes I 
made. [Laughter] 
JK: That is what, that is what I've said a couple times  
EK: Did he say that? 
JH: He actually said that. That's actually a quote. 
JK: Boys don't, don't forget, I designed that thing. But an Air Tractor’s just a Thrush without all the 
mistakes I made. 
EK: It really is though, isn't it? I mean… 
JH: Yeah, it's an evolution. You know, when he sold and he told me this, when he sold to Rockwell, 
he kind of didn't want to, but there were other pressures and other reasons why he did. It also 
forced him to start with a clean sheet. Which while that was very difficult, and a big job, probably 
advanced the design of the whole airplane further than it would have if it just kept evolving off 
that same frame in that same platform from before. So there's actually some merit to it like I said, I 
know it was hard a heck of a lot of work. But he was the guy that, boy he could just focus on things 
like that and, and get the task at hand done. 
EK: Did he do like adversity? Something to push against? 
[00:25:04] 
JH: He was as driven a guy as I've ever known. He was just driven. He, he’d deal with adversity and 
conflict. I don't think he really enjoyed it. He enjoyed designing and building airplanes. 
EK: But did it make him be a better designer did it? Like?  
JH: That's, that's kind of hard to say. 
EK: Maybe, maybe a better way to put it is . did he like a problem that needed to be solved? 
JH: Absolutely. Now that's, that's, that's the right way to characterize that. ‘Cause he was all about 
solving problems. Yeah. And, and just, like I said, just focused on that end goal of designing this 
airplane, of building this, you know, the obstacles, the challenges that he overcame throughout his 
career, in various stages are, are just amazing. Here's a story number a number of years ago, I 
decided it was time to give back to this industry. It’d been awful good to me for almost 20 years. 
And I kind of stumbled on to and had talked about doing a restoration project on an old Snow 
airplane. And I found one one day and said, I'm gonna go get that thing we're going to and later 
restoration project. And then we'll figure out to do what to do with it one of these days. So I made 
a deal. I contacted these people that had this S-2A, serial number 25 to 25th airplane built. So 
you're talking about the guy that was flying the seventh B. 
EK: Floyd McElwain?  
JH: Yeah. So anyway, we've still got this thing. It's still a project. We're way behind. We should 
have finished it years ago. But it's an airplane restoration project. And we get busy doing other 
things and distracted. But long story short, back to the, that adversity thing that Leland came over. 
He comes in one day, a few weeks after I had gotten that thing here and unloaded it in the hangar 
and we'd had a little start to disassembly process project couple of times and he brings this old, 
old spiral notebook in and hands it to me and says I want that back ‘fore the end of the day. He 
said, but that's the, that's my hand log of airworthiness certificates for all those early airplanes. 
And that one you bought in there. So you know, it was several pages in a spiral notebook, just one 
line, the serial number of the day, there were their certificate number, you know, that kind of just 
that basic information in airplane number one through, you know, twenty-whatever. So I took it 
back to him. And he asked me a question, he says, you see that airplane? That serial number 25? 
Yep. He says, you see all the ones next to it, 26 and 27, 28, 29. Yeah. He says, Did you notice the 
date they were licensed? Well, I didn't pay particular attention, no. He says we look there's all five 
of those airplanes were licensed on the same day. So yeah, that is kind of odd, ‘cause if you look, 
you know, one comes out every week and a half, two weeks and, and sometimes there's two of 
them on the same day. Said back in those days. We had to have the FAA guy, guy that worked for 
the FAA come here to sign off the original airworthiness certificate for the airplane. He said things 
were going along pretty good. We were building airplanes, and we had our legs under us, starting 
to get a good foundation. He said I, to simplify the process, I designed the tail around a horizontal 
in an elevator that was surplus. And this guy over in Fort Worth had this whole warehouse full of 
them. And we'd build two three airplanes and I'd type out a PO for a couple of three or maybe four 
more of those horizontal tails and send it over and generally in a week or two pickup truck come 
around the corner it was him and you'd have three or four of those horizontal tails in it. We go 
some more.  
[00:30:14] 
He said one day as we're starting to build on that bunch of airplanes right there. He says, I had sent 
the PO off. And, you know, a couple of weeks went by and nobody showed up. No horizontal tails 
for these airplanes. And this is about overcoming obstacles. He says, so you know, it's the late ‘50s, 
or yeah, it’s 1959. I pick up the phone and call over there. And nobody answers the phone, which 
really wasn't that unusual back in those days and day passed, and another day, and I picked up the 
phone. And so he said, you know it’s three or four days before I finally talked to the guy and he 
says, Oh, no, I don't have any more of those. You bought them all. And he's got airplanes in the line, 
right? Waiting on these things to come from the warehouse and they’re all gone. So he scurries 
out. And this is the problem solving thing too, this is huge problem, right? There's airplanes in the 
production line and don't have horizontal tail, and there's not one coming. He has the guys pull 
one off an airplane that’s already built, and drill all the rivets out of it. And he takes it home and 
spends all weekend drawing all those parts in an assembly and comes back with all those 
drawings early the next week, Monday or Tuesday. One of his deals on projects was to leave here 
on Thursday afternoon with everything he needed to show back up Monday, or maybe first thing 
Tuesday morning with all the drawings and reports and whatever work, engineering work done. 
Do something like an aileron or something like that, right, some some… anyway. So he takes it out, 
takes the drawings out to the shop, and they go to work. And they build a horizontal tail to match 
by the end of that next week. And he was very persuasive like that. Look, fellas, we got to have all 
these skins and the spars and all these pieces and parts and have one hammered together by 
Friday. That was probably Tuesday mornings. And so they did that. And they bolt it on this 
airplane. And Sam Cooke, the guy who actually taught me how to fly these airplanes, goes to the 
runway to go test fly it and comes back only a half hour later and says boss it doesn't work. What 
do you mean, it doesn't work? He says, you move the stick up and down going down the runway 
and the tail just stays there. It doesn't have any elevator power. And oh, wow. We've already lost 
another two weeks. So now it's been four weeks or five weeks since he's had a horizontal tail and 
can't deliver airplanes. And you know, it was the early days it was the first 25 airplanes, money's 
tight and dadadada da. What do you do? So he told me he said I thought to myself about that J-2 
Cub that I rebuilt in high school. And he said a tube and fabric, round tubes fabric tail will work. So 
he goes home that weekend, and designs the whole tubular structure horizontal and elevator to be 
fabric covered. And shows back up Monday or Tuesday with all those drawings the following 
week. And before the end of the week, they had built that and had it covered. Of course they were 
doing fabric work here at that time. Already anyway, the fuselage of the Ace was all fabric. And 
they got one built in got it on an airplane. And lo and behold, Sam goes to fly it and it works good. 
But you know what, they still got challenges, because they still got to certify this thing. They got to 
do all the static load testing and structural work, testing work and an FAA level certification flight 
test program. But they managed to, in a matter of a couple of six or eight weeks solve that 
problem. That's the problem solving in, what you think about things like that, what a huge obstacle 
is placed in front of you to claw, fight, scratch and make your way through and make it happe. 
We've had a little of that here in the past year around here. The supply chain has not been very 
reliable. We have had to scratch and claw particularly this year, this year worse than last year, we 
operated continuously through 2020 we were a little slower, not a lot. We worked every day, we 
did what we had to do to get our airplanes bill and keep COVID at bay as much as we could. And it 
worked. And we get into 2021 and everybody's so relieved, it's a new year, we're going to put this 
COVID thing behind us now. In February, we get slammed with this deep freeze event that for the 
first time that I know of ever 
[00:35:47] 
something other than management shut this place down. You know so, so we battled and 
scratched our way through that, that actually had a great effect on the supply chain as well, the 
freeze did because, you know, nothing's moving no transportation. It turns out that a lot of the Gulf 
Coast refiners suffered a lot of damage and we're still have trouble the day with some resins for 
fiberglass and epoxy. We're literally living hand to mouth for a lot of epoxies, resins and plastics-
related stuff deal due to the freeze and of course COVID’s had an effect too as some companies 
were shut down. And so you know, it may be a fuel pump, it may be a circuit breaker, it may be 
something. So far we have managed to stay focused on, on getting materials, there are still some 
issues, and there's probably still some that are going to pop up it, it feels a little more solid now. 
But you know, we, we keep working every day to overcome those obstacles. 
JK: There's a great philosophy that I was reading, sort of, I guess the memoirs of a B-17 bomber 
pilot, and he wrote that his instructor always told him, read the problem, make a checklist, run the 
checklist. And it seems like that philosophy is alive and well. And after now, it sounds like that, it 
was Leland’s philosophy. Like he looked at the problem, and you really say it, same as when you 
take a test, you read that thing. word by word, and then you read it again, and make your checklist. 
JH: Um-hm. One of those things we continue to work to train around here, Jackson, is problem 
solving step one, identify the problem. What's the real problem here? Not just the symptom of the 
problem which is what you just felt, right? What's the real problem here? Let's go back and do core 
problem solving. 
JK: And I think something like you know this, you speak about the supply chain. That system is so 
complex that a lot of people have a hard time dissecting it down into chunks, because you can't 
just look at the overall problem. Like you say the symptom, you got to break that thing down into 
break like manageable bits before you can start solving. 
EK: So as the, the guy in charge you, it's you know, your job to maintain that, that vision and that 
optimism, isn't it?  
JH: Yep. And that's what we do.  
EK: Did you learn that from Leland Snow? 
JH: A lot of those characteristics of just…, it's also about that work ethic. There’s nobody I've ever 
known that worked as hard as Leland Snow worked. 
EK: Maybe you.  
JH: No, he worked a whole lot harder and a lot more hours than I did. Focus, try to, you know, 
maintain, you know, Leland was so focused on Air Tractor and airplanes. He really didn't do 
anything else. Yeah, he had a family. He played the piano. He ran, red m (undecipherable), but 
other than that, Saturday afternoon, Sunday afternoon, Saturday morning, Friday morning, 
Thursday afternoon, Thursday evening. He was doing something for Air Tractor, whether it was 
writing a letter, correcting a drawing. Uh… 
JK: He ever take a vacation?  
JH: You'll have to ask Kristin about this. [Laughter.] Yes, his wife would make him go on vacation. 
He didn’t much want to, but yeah, he went. And did the family thing with the vacation. I'll never 
forget because boy, we heard about it around here. They get to Puerto Rico. This was ‘90s vintage,  
and he opens the suitcase and out comes the Smith Corona typewriter and an engineering report 
in the condo In Puerto Rico. I don't know that that went over real well. 
EK: Can’t drop the ball. 
JH: You'll have to ask Kristen about that. 
JK: We'll do that. 
[00:40:10] 
EK: So how do you, well, how do you keep…? How do you get the buy in from everybody else to 
maintain that attitude, because oftentimes, once that that first leader is gone, there's a slack off or, 
you know… 
JH: Right, there's a change, and there is a change, it is a little different. It's not exactly the same. 
You keep working, right? That's, that's the one thing you keep working on it. You keep doing a lot 
of those same things, you changed some things that needed to be changed. You ask those people 
for their input, and you depend on them to go do the job that they do as well. And give them the 
range to do it. The other thing Leland did do was lay a great groundwork and a great team of 
people to carry forward. He wasn't just me. It's all these other people around here that have been 
around here for a long time too that that have helped keep that moving forward in a positive way. 
So it's a team you work in to build the team. you communicate. I don't spend as much time as I 
should on the floor. But still try to make sure I'm out there talking to people every week, if not 
every day. It's, it's a, it's a constant… It's just a constant effort. 
EK: Yeah. Your pilots loves their planes. They love them.  
JH: Oh, yes, they do. And you know, this other thing. When 802 production started, and Leland 
viewed all these airplanes as his children. For the first 20 airplanes, when they were new, I knew a 
lot about each one of those airplanes, and I knew the people who had them and the people who 
bought them, and maintained some relationships. So yeah, we love each, each and every one of 
them and treat them with tender lovin’ care as we put them together and try to keep continuing to 
convey that message and pass that along as the transitions occur when people leave and new 
people step up to take on bigger roles and responsibilities. You know, try to continue to teach and 
convey that same philosophy and ethic for work and passion for the product. And, you know, try 
to get those customers when they do come here to get out there and talk to those guys. And gals.  
JK: Each plane has its own personality, it seems like. 
JH: It, it's kind of does. Yeah, it kind of does.  
JK: I've noticed that about playing more so than cars. I mean, I've I've been guilty of 
anthropomorphizing… 
JH: Remember, airplanes are still all handbuilt, each and every one of them. Everything, everything 
on there is hand fit. It's not stamped out and glued together and snapped together. You know, so 
each from that perspective, each one of them is unique. 
JK: Handles a little different, acts a little different. 
JH: You know, we've, we've had that discussion a lot. Every one of them is exactly the same. But no 
two of them are identical. They're all exactly the same. But no two of them are identical ‘cause 
they're handbuilt. 
EK: They have their little, like Dusty has his little, I think a little fuzzy things along the top. Yeah, 
their little his little safety thing, right? You know, people have they, the pilots had their little things 
in there.  
JH: Yeah. And so that's the other thing we know, when they leave here. They customize them, they 
change this, they tweak this because they're every one of them, that well, that's why we call them 
custom applicators, right? They customize that equipment to do the applications that they need to 
do be it fertilizer or, or bug spray. They tweak those airplanes and modify them for whether it's 
spraying bugs on soybeans are putting fertilizer on rice. And they all have their own little ways of 
doing that. And so that's one of the things also that, that makes the pilots and owners and 
operators of these airplanes so unique and special. 
[00:45:20] 
EK: So they do that, do you? Do you design different planes, obviously for different uses, but for 
different topography, like in northern Missouri, there arealong the river, they're like these massive 
fields, you know, in the Dakotas, they're like, huge in, in northern Missouri, and then in northern 
Missouri, around the Missouri River, they have these little tobacco patches, that are like these, you 
know, like little 10 acres. 
JH: Right. 
EK: Do you, do you consider that when you change designs? Or do you, is it just a single design? Or 
do you get what I'm going at? 
JH: Yeah. So we're we approach that from a little higher level than what I was talking about the 
individual operators customizing how many spray nozzles and where the spray nozzles are to do, 
what, that's why we have all the different models, that's why we have a 402, a 502, a 602, or an 
802. Because the guy in the area that has thousands and thousands of acres, as far as he needs an 
802. He needs to be able to cover a lot of ground. Whereas a guy that that may have some tobacco 
patches to do, or some smaller 30-acre fields to do, may be better off at a 402. So we try to give, get 
them a basic platform that fits their need from that geography, geography or topography 
standpoint, the best and, and give all the operators that, that choice. You know, we developed the 
602, kind of based on that. For some fertilizer operators, this, the 502 didn't hold quite enough. 
They they thought the 802 was a little big. And then you go look at the the circles out in West 
Texas with the cotton. If they're doing five gallons an acre on 120-acre circle, all sudden that 602 is 
one load to a circle. Instead of with a 502 you get out there you get it three quarters done, you got 
to go back, get another load to finish that one, and then maybe start on the next one and then one, 
and boy that that was a niche little thing. So that's an example of what we do from a higher order. 
And then engines, and power plants, same thing. A dash 34 and a 502-B may be just fine for most 
operators. In South Texas, it's, there it’s 300 feet or 200 feet above sea level. It's warm, but not…. 
But the guy in Kansas it 3,500 feet in 98 degrees in a real high density altitude, bigger engine 
makes a whole lot more sense. He can keep going all the way to the guy that's spraying potatoes in 
Idaho at 7,000 feet above sea level. He needs the horsepower because as you go up, as you know, 
the engine’s not able to make as much power as it does on sea level. So those, those are, that's 
where we focus. We don't spend a lot of time with that detail of which nozzles go in which hole 
kind of for example. 
EK: Yeah.  
JH: Yep, give them the right big tool, and they can customize it and put the teeth on the shovel in 
the manner that makes sense for exactly what they're gonna do. 
JK: It's readily apparent that you guys are used to that I needed a blueprint for Kevin's plane, 
because I think you'd change something.  
JH: Yep.  
JK: And I just emailed customer service and they emailed me a blueprint. Which I thought was kind 
of cool because they didn't say who are you? What are you doing on this airplane? 
JH: Yep. We, that, that's back to that customer service thing. We, I still think that's very important. 
That's a message we promote because we facilitate the guys being able to do that. That just helps 
us in the long run.  
JK: Saves him time. He doesn't have to take it to, you know, Memphis or somewhere to have it 
worked on. Or Arkansas. He can just say hey, I'll trade your flying lessons for some radio work. 
[Laughter.] 
JH: Good deals that are made every day. Right?  
JK: It is a good deal. 
[00:50:09] 
EK: Well, I'm sure we could keep talking to you, because you're really interesting.  
JH: Well thank you. [Laughs.] 
EK: You are, I'm fascinated. But we're going to cut off the formal interview. Because I know you're 
a busy man. And I think I, that the part about maintaining the vision that that was something that 
like, just kept I kept thinking about because and are there people, are you, are there people who 
believe in this to the point where they're going to maintain it for the next episode?  
JH: Absolutely. Yeah. I'll tell you the other thing that we've got that the Snows did is the employee 
ownership. That's been really powerful in helping us maintain the passion in division. Because 
they really, everybody here has a longer term vested interest in the success of this place. They get 
it now too after 11, almost 12 years of EESOP. We're, we're tuned in more to it's not just a job and 
a paycheck on Thursday afternoon, there's a future, a future for me and my family, beyond Air 
Tractor that if I give it all I've got, and really engage, and help the cause of the company to succeed, 
me and my family will be better off for it in the end. And that's just great. And it's been a great 
benefit and, and a great, you know, just from morale, and develop and drive and passion. It's 
definitely helped that. 
EK: Yeah, it sounds like Leland Snow made a really wise decision in choosing you. So, you know, 
many years ago, as well. It's not easy to find people who share a passion and a vision.  
JH: Right. Well, thank you for that.  
EK: Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for your time. 
JH: Well, you're welcome. Enjoyed doing it. This will be interesting to see the... 
EK: It'll be archived in the Library of Congress and available for anyone who wants to listen to it. 
Did you cut us off? Go ahead, cut us off.
