AG:  Hi Lindsay.  Welcome.  Thank you so much for participating in the Library of Congress 
Oral History Interviews.  Can I ask you to introduce yourself? 
 
LM:  My name is Lindsay Mason.  I am a registered nurse at the Oklahoma City VA in the 
surgical intensive care unit.  
 
[00:16] AG:  Oh wow.  Can we start by talking a little bit about where you grew up and your 
family and your education background? 
 
LM:  Absolutely.  I grew up on the southwest side of Oklahoma City.  I lived there in the same 
house from the time I was born until I moved out at 20.   I have an older brother whose four 
years older so it was just me and him growing up and then our mom and dad.  My mom is 
actually a nurse herself so that kind of influenced a lot of where my nursing background came 
from.  My aunt is also a nurse so I had the medical background kind of instilled in me since I was 
young. I started out as an Associate’s Degree nurse.  I went to Oklahoma City Community 
College, and then from there I started at the Oklahoma City VA in the surgical intensive care unit 
as a nurse.  Prior to that, I did work there as a certified nursing assistant while I was in school so 
I’ve been there for a little over five years now total, and then once I got my Associate’s, about 
six months later, I went back and I got my Bachelor’s from Southwestern Oklahoma State 
University.  I graduated there in December 2019, and I am actually currently going back to get 
my Master’s at that same college for nursing administration.   
 
AG:  Oh wow.  That’s great.  So right now you’re both working and enrolled in school like full 
time essentially? 
 
LM:  Yes. 
 
AG:  Oh my gosh. That must be a lot. 
 
LM:  It is a lot, but I have nothing else to do.  I don’t have kids so why not do it now. 
 
AG:  A good time.  So when you were growing up, did you have favorite subjects in school that 
you remember? 
 
LM:  Yes.  My favorite subjects in school were definitely had to be math and science.  I was 
definitely not an English or reading person, but math and science were my thing. 
 
AG:  Has that helped you throughout like the nursing process and nursing school? 
 
LM:  Yes, I would say so because nursing is mainly math and science related versus the English 
and reading so that definitely helps.

AG:  And were you involved in like extracurricular activities or social activities when you were 
growing up? 
 
LM:  So when I was little I started out in soccer.  That didn’t last too long.  Then after that I 
actually ended up in cheer, and I was a competitive cheerleader for, gosh, I think it was like eight 
years or something like that.  So that was my extracurricular activities. 
 
AG:  Oh wow.  That’s terrific.  That’s really physically demanding isn’t it? 
 
LM: Yes. 
 
AG:  The tumbling? 
 
LM:  And I’m feeling it now. 
 
AG:  Right.  I can imagine.  Oh wow.  You said your mom and your aunt were both nurses.  Did 
you sort of talk to them or learn about nursing as you were growing up?  Do you have any like 
early memories of their careers? 
 
LM:  I do.  So when I was little my mom was -- all I’ve ever known her to be is a nurse manager, 
but she’s always been in the ICU.  She actually started at the Oklahoma City VA in 2001, and I 
do remember going up to her unit with her frequently, and walking around. I still work with 
some of the nurses that she was their manager, and they all tell me they remember me from when 
I was yay tall, and so I do remember walking around the hospital. I volunteered up there one 
summer, and so I do have quite a few memories.  And I remember going to visit my aunt at her 
hospital as well and kinda getting all that. 
 
AG:  Wow.  That’s so cool.  So it sounds like your first and only position both as a certified 
nursing assistant and then as an RN was at the Oklahoma VA right (inaudible 0:04:10.8)? 
 
LM:  So there was one prior to that because you have to be 18 to be at the VA.  I started out as a 
nursing assistant right out of my senior year of high school at a little surgical hospital just right 
down the road from me, and I worked there for quite a while.  I say quite a while, about a year, 
almost two probably. 
 
AG:  I see.  And what do you remember, if anything, of your early experience nursing, like those 
first couple of years?  I guess either as a CNA or as an RN. 
 
LM:  As an RN it was definitely nerve racking.  My mom specifically asked one of her 
employees that she hired to precept me because the unit that I work on is [00:05:00] actually the 
one that she used to be the nurse manager on before she went up higher, and so she knew him, 
and she’s like “I know how he was trained ‘cause I know who trained him.  I want him to train 
you”.  So it was very intimidating that first little bit just kinda getting everything settled, and

2020012, Nursing America's Veterans

2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
making sure that I knew I was doing what I was supposed to be doing.  So it was definitely very 
nerve racking for the first little bit. 
 
AG:  Did you have the same role in your first job there or did it shift after you were there longer? 
 
LM:  So it shift -- yeah it shifted. 
 
[5:38] AG:  What was the first role that you had? 
 
LM:  My first role was I was kind of in like the float pool so I went all over the hospital to all the 
different inpatient units depending on who needed me that day.  I did anything from working the 
floor, taking vital signs and blood sugars and bathing patients, and stuff like that to if there was a 
patient who was on a psych eval or something, and I needed to sit with them, and be one on one. 
So it just kind of depending on what they needed. 
 
AG:  That makes sense.  How long were you in that float pool? 
 
LM:  Ooh.  I started in December 2015, and I was there through December (00:06:18.7)  so for 
about a year. 
 
AG:  Now what is your day to day role like? 
 
LM:  Now my day to day role is I work the night shift in the surgical ICU.  I typically work -- 
‘cause we have to work 80 hours in a two week pay period so I usually work -- I try to work 
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of one week, and then Sunday, Monday, Tuesday the 
next week, and I usually have anywhere from one to three patients.  It just depends on staffing.  
They can be -- sometimes we have patients who are med/surg holds that we’re caring for, and 
sometimes they could be a super sick ICU patient.  It just kinda depends.  We pretty much do 
total patient care in my ICU.  We do have a tech, but more often than not she’s not with us so 
everything pretty much falls back on us.  But we have monitors that take our vital signs for us 
however often we need ‘em so that helps, but yeah. 
 
AG:  Are those 12 hour shifts typically? 
 
LM:  Yes ma’am.  Typically 12 hours.  One of those can be an eight hour shift, but I typically 
make it a 12 so I work about four hours of overtime just ‘cause it’s easier for me to go in at 7:30 
every day versus trying to remember which one I have to go in at 11:30. 
 
AG:  I can imagine that.  That makes sense.  What are some of the primary conditions and issues 
or injuries that you see in the ICU? 
 
LM:  So in our ICU, we do see a lot of surgical patients.  We’ll see a lot of bowel surgeries or 
any time somebody’s got like a brain bleed or something we’ll see where they’ve gone in and 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
6 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
done a -- they’ve removed that brain bleed, like a subdural hematoma or something like that.  
They evacuated it.  Then we also get like medical ICU overflow so we can see things about 
people who are in diabetic ketoacidosis, some people who are super septic from some sort of 
infection or, I’m trying to think what else.  We get stroke patients, heart attacks.  We kinda get 
just about everything.  Now we’re not a trauma center so we don’t get all the trauma.  Those go 
across the street to OU, but we do get a lot of the other stuff, and sometimes we get patients 
transferred in from OU that have been there for a while and are stabilized, and then we get them.  
It just kinda depends. 
 
AG:  Is there a profile of the patients that you see?  Are they typically older or younger or could 
it be any age, that kind of thing? 
 
LM:  For the most part we see older veterans from usually like in their 60s to their 90s.  
Sometimes we will get the ones that are in like their 30s to 40s, but those are few and far 
between.  The youngest that I actually cared for was an 18-year-old, and that was a very rare 
occurrence.  It was just like special circumstances, but for the most they’re usually older. 
 
AG:  How long have you been in the ICU?  Has that (inaudible 0:09:37.3). 
 
LM:  I have been in the ICU since I graduated nursing school.  So the entire time, three years. 
 
AG:  Do you like going to work in that capacity (inaudible 0:09:47.4)? 
 
LM:  I do.  I really do enjoy it.  So initially growing up, I didn’t know if I wanted to be a 
pharmacist, a physical therapist.  I knew I wanted to be in the medical field, but with cheer I 
injured myself frequently so [00:10:00] I did go to physical therapy, and I was like “oh, maybe I 
want to be a physical therapist”, and then I got to thinking, and I was like “eh.  There’s not 
enough excitement in that for me” so that’s when I settled on nursing despite my mom’s trying to 
get me not to.  She’s like “are you sure you want to be a nurse?”  So that’s how I kinda ended up 
in the ICU.  I like the excitement, and all that kind of stuff so I do enjoy it ‘cause you never 
know what’s gonna happen, what you’re gonna run in to. 
 
AG:  That makes a lot of sense.  It’s probably pretty high stakes.  Yeah.  So your mom actually 
tried to like de-sway you from pursuing nursing? 
 
LM:  She did, didn’t work, but she did. 
 
AG:  Do you have a sense of why?  Did she think it was like too stressful or something like that? 
 
LM:  No.  I honestly don’t know why.  I think she was just trying to think of maybe like 
pharmacist or something else for me to do, but I was bred to be a nurse. 
 
AG:  Do you think that you in part wanted to work for the VA because she had experience there?

2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
 
LM:  I think so.  So she started at the VA in 2001, and I was fairly young, and so those were my 
main memories was her there.  I always remembered her talking about the veterans, and how 
much she liked caring for them.  So when I did that summer of volunteering when I was in, I 
think I was in eighth grade maybe, I got to see some of the veterans, and I really enjoyed actually 
being around them.  I started there as the tech, and so I would see any veterans from World War 
II who would tell me their stories of being like a prisoner of war and kind of stuff all the way to 
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, and so I enjoyed working with the veterans.  So that’s why I 
stayed.  I had the opportunity.  I could have gone anywhere, but I really enjoyed working with 
the veterans, and so that kept me. 
 
[12:13] AG:  Yeah.  Do you think working with the veteran population is more rewarding maybe 
than working in like the other settings?  Like the private sector? 
 
LM:  Yeah, I do.  I find it very rewarding because they fought for their country.  They served for 
me to be free, and so I feel like it’s my turn to give back to them, and care for them.  So I do find 
it extremely rewarding to be able to care for them. 
 
AG:  Yeah, absolutely.  That makes sense.  Do you remember was it sort of those early 
experiences volunteering or something else -- do you remember when you decided to pursue 
nursing rather than physical therapy or pharmacy like what age that was? 
 
LM:  Oh man.  That was probably -- so in high school, I had the opportunity to go to a vocational 
school, and I went ahead and I did the nursing assistant route, and so from there we had to do 
clinicals in the hospital and stuff like that through it, and so that really kind of solidified that I 
really wanted to be a nurse.  So that was my junior year of high school, and then my senior year 
of high school I got to go to another class at that same vocational school, and actually got to get 
in a little bit more advanced of a tech degree kind of so to speak.  I could do more things like IV 
or not IV draws, blood draws.  I could place Foley catheters.  I could do more stuff that was 
closer to like nursing skills, but it obviously wasn’t like assessments, and stuff like that.  So that 
really, I think, also helped. 
 
AG:  Absolutely.  It sounds like you had from like a very young age incredible hands on 
experience. 
 
LM:  Yeah.   
 
AG:  That’s -- 
 
LM:  -- so when I actually finished high school, I graduated with I think almost 30 credit hours 
of college credit because not only through Moore Norman the vocational school that I went too, I 
also did concurrent enrollment at the local college to gain more college credits.  I only ended up 
doing one semester of classes before getting in to the nursing program.  Everyone that I work

2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
with, they’re like “you’re only 24?”  I’m like “yeah”.  They’re like “and you’ve been a nurse for 
three years?”  I was like “well, yeah.  I passed my boards before I was even 21”.  So they’re like 
“man, are you like a child protégé?”  “No.  I just have my stuff together”. 
 
AG:  Yeah.  It sounds like it was really very accelerated. 
 
LM:  Yes. 
 
AG:  Fast.  [00:15:00] Wow.  Have you had any-- like have there been any consequences of that 
like perhaps being so young in a role that most people are older than you or you know that kind 
of thing? 
 
LM:  Not really ‘cause most people don’t realize that I’m as young as I am.  I get often that I act 
a whole lot more mature than what I really am, and people are like “you’re really only 24?  
Wow.  You seem so much more mature”, and I’m like “thank you?” 
 
[15:31] AG:  Oh wow.  That’s great.  Oh my goodness.  So I wonder if I could ask you a little bit 
as well about the past year.  So you’re fairly new like compared to -- 
 
LM:  -- yes -- 
 
AG:  -- probably many of the nurses -- 
 
LM:  -- right -- 
 
AG:  -- in your facility, and then right after that you get kind of the COVID-19 -- 
 
LM:  -- yes -- 
 
AG:  -- pandemic.  How did that -- did your day to day change considerably? 
 
LM:  Absolutely.  So I work in a 12-bed ICU, and the ICU next door to us is only 10-beds so 
initially when COVID started our first patient -- we didn’t have our first positive until probably 
late March, early April of last year.  While other hospitals were having patients pop up left and 
right we didn’t, but those first couple of patients we got were extremely sick.  I wouldn’t say that 
our ICU is the highest acuity ICU so to speak, but we very quickly became very high acuity.  We 
were caring for patients that we typically didn’t care for, and if we did it was not very often that 
we got those sick of patients so it completely changed.  And then the more patients we got, we 
ended up turning our entire ICU into -- everything was negative pressure so for the entire shift, 
we had to be in full PPE.  It wasn’t the most convenient thing for the nurses because we were in 
there for 12 hours, couldn’t eat, drink, go to the bathroom, anything like that unless we left the 
unit, but it was easier for us to care for the patients or get to the patients in a timely manner if 
something was going wrong so that’s where that came in.  Then at the height of it, I think it was 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans

2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
last August, the VA I guess purchased what they called -- it’s a (inaudible 0:17:33.2) is what it’s 
called, but it’s a whole bunch of metal like pods so to speak put together, and it makes into a -- 
we used it as a med/surg unit, but it was just a mobile unit that they set up in the parking lot.  We 
got that in August, and we had 18 med/surg patients out there.  They had to be, you know, pretty 
self-sufficient, get up and walk because it was one bed right after another with just curtains in 
between ‘em, and, you know, bathrooms were at the end or in the middle.  We had that for 
probably a month, and then things started to slow back down so they sent it off to, I think it went 
to Florida maybe after us.  I’m not entirely certain, but then December it came back to us, and so 
from Christmas Eve through probably mid-February every shift that I worked I was down there 
functioning as a charge nurse because we got deployed nurses from different VA’s so we had the 
(inaudible 0:18:43.1) nurses with us, and so they wanted a core ICU staff to be out there to help, 
you know, not only help them know what they were doing, but in case something went wrong 
they had an ICU nurse.  So that was definitely a big change.  That was the major change that 
really happened other than the whole negative pressure, and just having our patients be ten times 
sicker than what we were used to. 
 
AG:  Can I ask you just to explain what negative pressure means? 
 
LM:  Negative pressure is any time you have something that’s airborne like tuberculosis or 
COVID, the way they set it up is we had these big machines that basically just pulled the air to 
them, and filtered it out, and so it’s just how it’s filtered kind of. 
 
AG:  So that refers to like the filtration system in the unit? 
 
LM:  Right.  Yes. 
 
AG:  And then you were saying that as a result of this like high tech filtration system when 
you’re on that unit you can’t eat or drink or even leave to use the bathroom? 
 
LM:  Right.  We could leave to use the bathroom. 
 
AG:  Oh, I see. 
 
LM:  But, you know, we weren’t in the unit because, you know, we have monitors everywhere, 
and as ICU nurse [00:20:00] typically we like to be able to see that, to know what our patients 
vital signs are, their heart rate, anything like that ‘cause if somethings gonna go wrong we’ll see 
it quickly, but there was often times -- like I remember one occasion where one of my fellow 
nurses stepped out of the unit to go eat lunch, and had me watching her patient, and I remember 
calling her because while I’m watching him, his heart rhythm is starting to do some funky stuff, 
and I was like “you know, is he a full code or is he a DNR/DNI?  I should probably know this 
real quick”.  She’s like “oh, he’s a full code”.  I was like “yeah, you might want to come back on 
the unit now rather than later”, and he did end up having cardiac arrest.  That was kind of one of 
the big things was if you’re off the unit, you’re relying on others to watch your patients for you.

2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
 
AG:  Of course.  That must be very nerve racking. 
 
LM:  Right. 
 
AG:  Mm-hmm.  You were talking about the PPE. 
 
LM:  Yes. 
 
AG:  That’s like the personal gear? 
 
LM:  Yes. 
 
AG:  Can you like explain a little bit?  Yeah, like what does that entail? 
 
LM:  Yeah.  Yes.  So we would wear disposable gowns over our clothes.  We’d wear shoe 
covers.  Towards the end we kind of got away from -- I got away from the shoe covers because 
they were slick, and I didn’t really feel like falling, but some people would wear shoe covers 
other people wouldn’t.  We’d wear disposable like hair nets that went over our hair to protect it.  
We’d wear -- there were different kinds.  We could use what was called a PAPR which is, I think 
it is positive airway -- that’s a great question actually.  A positive airway respiratory protection 
or something like that, but it’s a big machine that basically just filters the air in there, and 
basically keeps any particles from getting in.  We could wear that.  We could wear something 
very similar, but it was called a CAPR so it was just like a big dome helmet with a shield, kinda 
looked like aliens or we could wear an N95 just mask, and then eye protection. 
 
AG:  And you had to keep all of that on throughout the whole shift (inaudible 0:22:24.2)? 
 
LM:  Anytime we were in the units we would had to to protect ourselves, yes ma’am. 
 
[22:29] AG:  Were your shifts during the COVID outbreak as long as normal?  They were still 
12 hours? 
 
LM:  They were still 12 hours.  Towards the end of it, we ended up having to be placed on 
mandatory overtime so what would normally be our eight hour shift where we’d come in at 
11:30, we had to do four hours of mandatory overtime so every shift we worked ended up being 
a 12. 
 
AG:  Were there any staffing shortages as a result of the increased need or was it okay because 
they brought in those other deployed nurses? 
 
LM:  They brought in the deployed nurses because our staffing needs were so short.  There were 
often times we were taking care of three patients that were super sick, you know, having to be

2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
placed on their stomach because they needed the extra lung capacity or on continuous dialysis 
‘cause their kidneys were failing from it.  I remember one of my co-workers ended up floating to 
another unit, and he had to take a patient who was super high risk on a balloon pump so it’s just 
this balloon that’s in the aorta that just kinda helps take the load off the heart while typically after 
you’ve had like a big heart attack or something like that.  So he had to take care of that, and 
another patient which was before COVID completely unheard of, but our staffing because we 
had so many increased needs for staffing in the unit, we were making beds in places that 
probably should have never had patients in them.  Like we turned storage closets into rooms 
because we just had so many patients.  Not necessarily all of them were COVID, but not only the 
COVID, but all the other patients who had been putting off coming to the hospital ‘cause they 
were afraid ended up getting super sick, and needing some sort of care. 
 
AG:  Right.  Of course.  So it was the influx of the COVID patients, and then just regular -- 
 
LM:  -- correct -- 
 
AG:  -- routine care.  When you’re taking care of very sick patients like that is your shift much 
more difficult than a shift where you’re -- like it’s a more routine case?  Do you know what I 
mean?  Did you end up working like considerably harder because of all of the very sick patients? 
 
LM:  Often times, yes.  There was less breaks to be taken.  You had very little time to sit down at 
the desk.  You were always [00:25:00] just going back and forth between room to room to room.  
So it did end up being a little bit harder so to speak, but it also made the shifts go by quicker 
because you weren’t just sitting there twiddling your thumbs with all the downtime. 
 
AG:  You were like running the whole shift. 
 
LM:  Right. 
 
AG:  Did that take a toll on you physically?  Did you get sick?  Did you have like muscle issues 
or any --? 
 
LM:  I never got sick necessarily, but I was definitely exhausted at the end of every shift, and on 
my -- since I do try and stack my days, on my days off, I would spend most of my time just 
sleeping to recover.  It was very gruesome.  There was a lot of death, and so you know we would 
get hardened to it, but then again there were also some instances where, you know, it was very 
touching.  Like I remember one where the family was on an I-Pad facetiming their loved one as 
he was in his final, you know, hours or so, and so when he was getting ready to pass, I do 
remember going in there and, you know, holding his hand along with some other nurses while he 
did pass and, you know, that is hard.  That is, you know, to know that these patients, some of 
them are dying alone, some of them loved ones who really would love to be there with them 
while they pass can’t be, and so it’s a very lonely situation for the patients.  It’s very actually 
heart breaking for those patients.

AG:  Yeah, that component I think is like the most, like you said, haunting.  Like the idea of 
being alone, and for family members, and for the patients.  That’s a very, very difficult -- did you 
feel like you were exposed to a lot more incidents of your patients dying given the pandemic? 
 
LM:  Absolutely.  Pre-COVID we probably would have maybe I’d say like one to two deaths a 
month in the ICU, and then I think there was one month where we had like 40 deaths.  So I 
mean, the patients that were in, like I said, our ICU were super sick, and the prognosis for them 
really weren’t that great. But it’s also hard for families to be at home hearing through the phone 
how their family member’s doing, and not being able to be up there with them.  I feel like a lot of 
these families might have made different decisions had they been able to see what things were 
really like for their family.  Because I know a lot of times we don’t want to be as honest as we 
should be about it because they can’t be there, and so it’s just hard to find that balance of not 
telling them too much, but also telling them enough so that they’re informed so it can definitely 
be a little tricky. 
 
[28:15] AG:  Absolutely.  That’s such a delicate needle to thread in those circumstances.  Well 
thank you again so much.  I know we (inaudible 0:28:16.0).  What is your role as a charge nurse 
like?  Do you do the same kinds of things?  Is it different? 
 
LM:  So those patients were typically med/surg patients so they weren’t my typical kinds of 
patient, and in that case I would usually take about four.  There’s often times at like other 
hospitals where charge nurses don’t take patients, but in this case I did.  I would take patients.  I 
would care for my set of patients, but I would also overlook the other nurses.  If they had 
questions, they’d come to me.  I’d help facilitate getting lab out there to draw the labs, helping 
them locate where their meds might be because a lot of these nurses, yes they come from 
different VA’s, but systems between VA’s are a little bit different, and so some of them might 
have had med/surg background, but might have been working on the palliative care unit at the 
time.  Therefore, some of the stuff we did with our med/surg patients wasn’t quite what they 
were used to so there was a little bit of, you know, adjustment period so not only was I taking 
care of my patients, I was helping them.  It was very rewarding to be able to, you know, see how 
nurses from other VA’s work, and being able to work beside them.  I actually made a couple 
friends from it. 
 
AG:  Yeah, that does -- it sounds like it did feel like a real deployment. 
 
LM:  Right. 
 
AG:  Like people coming together from around the country -- 
 
LM:  -- yeah -- 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship

13 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
AG:  -- to help.  Do you happen to know where the nurses who were deployed -- were they like 
in a volunteer capacity or was that part of their job duties because maybe their VA’s were not as 
taxed at the time so they were like relocated? 
 
LM:  Right.  So a lot of time it’s volunteer.  You can volunteer to be what they -- it’s called a 
DEMPS [00:30:00] nurse.  I’m not entirely certain what it stands for.  I think it’s like Disaster 
Emergency Medical Personnel or something like that.  But you volunteer to do that, and then 
from what I understand is they send out where the needs are, and they can volunteer to go to 
those different places.  They obviously have to get approval from their supervisor, and I think the 
director of the hospital, but for the most part it was always a volunteer. 
 
AG:  Like being sort of responsible for other nurses in that role.  Was that enjoyable?  Was it 
difficult? 
 
LM:  It was enjoyable.  I mean, I enjoyed most of them.  There was the select few that, you 
know, I watched a little closer, but for the most I trusted most of them, and I enjoyed it just 
‘cause -- and you know it’s one big long open trailer kind of so I was down there with them.  I 
was with the patients, and so I liked it personally.  There’s some people from my unit who also 
got sent down there who absolutely hated it, but I didn’t mind it so that’s why I think for the 
most part I got sent down there quite a bit was ‘cause I didn’t mind whereas other people did. 
 
[31:12] AG:  Had you already decided to go back for your Master’s before you did -- before like 
the COVID crisis?  Were you already planning on that or did sort of having -- 
 
LM:  So I started in August of last year so I mean we were kind of right in the middle of it, and 
I’m not really entirely certain why I decided “hey this is a great time.  Let’s go back to school”, 
but I did. 
 
AG:  When you’re done with your Master’s will you have a different role do you think at the VA 
or will you stay in your current job? 
 
LM:  I’ll probably stay in my current role for a little bit, but eventually I mean I would like to 
move into some sort of manager role whether it at the same unit, a different unit or what have 
you. 
 
AG:  And now you have some like real trial by fire experience. 
 
LM:  Right. 
 
[32:05] AG:  Do you have a sense of how the VA system overall handled COVID?  Like if they 
handled it well, that kind of thing based on your? 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
14 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
LM:  So at my particular VA I feel like we handled it pretty well.  We had contingency plans in 
place, and when we did start getting a whole bunch of patients, we did actually follow those 
contingency plans, and when areas like the OR and stuff like that weren’t seeing patients, they 
didn’t just let those nurses just sit around and do nothing.  They actually put them in different 
units to help out whether it be working kind of in a tech role or actually working alongside 
another nurse to take patients.  So we were resourceful whereas I know a lot of other hospitals 
when push came to shove and they, you know, all these outpatient areas quit seeing patients, they 
started furloughing their nurses.  We didn’t do that.  We repurposed our nurses, and so I feel like 
we actually handled it fairly well. 
 
AG:  Yeah, it sounds like.  Have things mostly returned to pre-pandemic conditions or is it still? 
 
LM:  For the most part, it seems like it’s starting to return back to normal.  We’re still having 
fairly high patient volumes, but they’re not the COVID patients.  Like I think when I worked 
last, we had two COVID patients for the whole hospital whereas previously we’d have 22 that 
would just be in the ICU.  We’d have 22 plus however many were out on the med/surg floor. 
 
AG:  Do you attribute the increased patient load now to what you were saying, people who 
postponed health, like seeking health care in the midst of COVID? 
 
LM:  I do feel like that still has a lot to do with it, and that a lot of the clinics, and stuff were 
closed or they were doing telehealth visits, and so I think a lot of the patients actually, as sad as 
this is, kind of fell through the cracks, and then now something else has happened, and they’re 
sicker than they should be, and they’re in the hospital because had they actually been seen in 
person maybe something would have been caught sooner.  It’s no fault of their own. It’s just kind 
of how things fell with COVID, and trying to reduce patient exposure, and stuff like that. 
 
AG:  Right, yeah.  I hadn’t even thought about all of the people who postponed care like the 
influx that the next six months might bring of -- even though I myself (inaudible 0:34:57.8) 
going to the doctor next week, you know. 
 
LM:  Right [00:35:00]. 
 
AG:  So I wonder, do you have any sense of how the pandemic affected like the health care 
sector sort of generally based on your experiences? 
 
LM:  I think it strained the healthcare system.  I wouldn’t necessarily say ours, but I think at least 
definitely in the private sector I think a lot of nurses have become burned out from it, and so not 
only are we having more patients, but we’re also losing nurses because they’re just tired of being 
at the bedside or all different kinds of things, and so I do think it has put a strain on healthcare all 
together. 
 
AG:  Did you personally experience burn out, do you think, during the height of things? 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
15 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
 
LM:  During the height of it I absolutely did.  I would think to myself “man, what did I get 
myself into?  Maybe I should have listened and gone a different route”, but now that things have 
slowed back down it’s not as bad. 
 
AG:  Do you have any like tips for self-care or any things that you did to take care of yourself in 
the middle of it?  Or even just during the course of like a very difficult ICU shift otherwise? 
 
LM:  A lot of it came down to leaning on my co-workers for support because they were in it with 
me.  I would talk to my mom because she is a nurse.  She understood, but just having a support 
system to talk to was definitely a huge help, and definitely having a support system that knows 
nursing.  I mean I could talk to my husband about it all day long, but he’d just look at me and say 
“uh-uh, yeah” ‘cause he has no idea what’s going on or if I tell him something, he’ll be like 
“now what is that?” and so it’s just easier to talk to somebody that has some sort of medical 
knowledge or something, and so having that support system really helps. 
 
AG:  Absolutely.  Are there any like lessons that you’re taking with you from the COVID-19 
period? 
 
LM:  I would say definitely just treat each day like it’s your last.  You never know what could 
happen.  You could become sick, and just live your life to the fullest, and don’t have any regrets. 
 
[37:25] AG:  That totally makes sense.  You know typically I’ll ask people who’ve been at the 
VA for longer kind of like what makes working at the VA appealing to them or what they think 
of when they think back on their career.  I’m wondering, since you’ve been there for like a 
relatively short of period. 
 
LM:  Right. 
 
AG:  Do you anticipate staying at the VA for your whole career or do you think you might move 
at some point? 
 
LM:  I plan on staying for my whole career.  You know, like I said, it’s very rewarding to take 
care of the veterans.  I like going in asking them what branch of the military were they in, what 
did they do, if they enjoyed it.  Just kind of talking to them and getting a history, and there’s 
some veterans who will open up to you, and tell you about their time.  There’s others who don’t 
want to talk about it because it could be very traumatic for ‘em.  So, you know, it’s those ones 
who open up to me, and tell me about their times when they were a prisoner of war or stuff like 
that that’s very rewarding to me.  Whereas in the private sector you don’t get that.  You know 
you just get some Joe Schmo off the street who had a car wreck or something.  Whereas at the 
VA these patients might have an illness that stems from them being in the military, and different 
stuff that they were exposed to, and so it’s just very rewarding. 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
16 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
AG:  And you know that makes me think too, do you think that the VA was better able to handle 
COVID-19 because of the like kind of high stakes of the military service, and like the fact that 
maybe there are higher acuity patients in the VA than in private sector? 
 
LM:  I do feel like the VA was able to handle it probably better than the private sector.  I mean 
like I said, I didn’t work at the private sector, but from what I heard from some of my other 
nurses who would work part time at the other hospitals, a lot of the private sector hospitals their 
nurses left, and they were stuck with a whole bunch of agency nurses who, I mean, when you’re 
functioning with all agency nurses it’s difficult because they don’t know much about the system 
or anything, and so it can definitely cause some issues for the patients. 
 
AG:  Of course.  That makes sense.  I wonder, what do you consider the most difficult part of 
your job at the VA now? 
 
LM:  Probably my most difficult part of the job at the VA now is still just trying to find as much 
normalcy as possible because I’m not really caring for COVID patients as much as I had been so 
just getting back to remembering [00:40:00] how to do nursing before a pandemic.  Because you 
know a lot of things changed with the pandemic, a lot of how we did things changed especially 
like our charting.  We went to a more condensed charting just to save time, and so now we’re 
kind of back into that old ways of charting, and it’s kinda like “woo.  I don’t remember if I know 
how to chart this anymore”, but I mean once you remember it’s like riding a bike.  It comes back 
to you. 
 
AG:  Right, yeah.  So there was an attempt to like streamline the charting -- 
 
LM:  -- right -- 
 
AG:  -- just because of how crunched you were -- 
 
LM:  -- yes -- 
 
AG:  -- for time.  How long does it typically take you to chart like pre-pandemic, and then how 
long did the COVID pandemic time (inaudible 0:40:46.6)? 
 
LM:  So pre-pandemic it probably took about, I’d say depending on how quickly you wanted to 
get through it, and how many short cuts you could find, probably about 15 minutes per hourly 
assessment or so, and in COVID probably about 5 minutes ‘cause you could just click boxes, and 
they were pretty much pre-filled out from the previous assessment that had been done whereas 
pre-COVID you actually had to click what your assessment was so it definitely took a lot longer.  
So, yeah. 
 
AG:  And so now you’re back to the other model where you’re doing -- 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
17 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
LM:  Right. 
 
AG:  And I presume it’s all like through electronic medical records at this point? 
 
LM:  Yes. 
 
AG:  No one paper codes any more right?  Right.  You probably, in your career, have never used 
paper coding right? 
 
LM:  Actually surprisingly when I first started they were still doing paper charting, and they 
were in the process of transitioning to electronic when I started so I have used paper, and then if 
we had to get ICU patients in some of those areas that weren’t designed to be an ICU, we would 
have to paper chart on them so I actually, during the pandemic, got pretty familiar with how to 
paper chart again. 
 
AG:  Is that because the computer systems have like preloaded answers, and so if it doesn’t exist 
in the system you have do a paper chart? 
 
LM:  So that’s because the way the charting system at our hospital is, is there’s a specific 
computer in the ICU room that the patient is uploaded into that allows you to do the electronic 
charting whereas those types of computers with that software weren’t in those other areas that we 
had been using so we didn’t have that option. 
 
AG:  Right because there were so many like makeshifts -- 
 
LM:  -- right. 
 
AG: -- emergency beds basically.  Got it.  That makes sense.  When, you mentioned this a little 
bit, but when you think about the job, what would you say is the most rewarding aspect of 
working at the VA? 
 
LM:  The most rewarding aspect of working at the VA has to be just being able to give back to 
the veterans, and being able to provide my service to them because, you know, they served for 
me so now it’s my turn to provide service back. 
 
AG:  Yeah.  It sounds like it’s got a lot more meaning kind of when you’re caring for someone 
who, like you said, has sacrificed for the country.  That’s awesome.  I wonder as well if we can 
shift to talk a little bit more like big picture questions in the last 15-20 minutes of that’s okay 
with you? 
 
LM:  Yeah, absolutely. 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
18 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
[43:35] AG:  Okay, perfect.  When you think about nursing, what do you see as your role in 
providing patient care? 
 
LM:  My role in providing patient care is, you know, I’m the first line for that patient.  I’m in 
there.  I’m listening to their heart, their lungs.  I’m looking at their vital signs.  I’m giving them 
their medication so I’m usually the first one to know somethings going wrong, and it’s on me to 
identify that, and give that information to the doctor who can then make changes or add 
medications or do whatever to hopefully prevent something further going wrong.  So like I’m 
that first line of defense for patients. 
 
AG:  That makes a lot of sense.  Has your perspective on that shifted at all over the course of 
your career or has it changed the more, you know, like with the pandemic or the more 
experiences you have? 
 
LM:  So with the pandemic I feel like we were, as far as nurses go, we were spending 99% of our 
time with these patients whereas the doctors would come in for maybe five minutes, just kinda 
look at ‘em, ask us about ‘em, and then leave.  So the doctors really weren’t, you know, as 
engaged as the nurses so we kinda, as nurses, felt like we were providing more care than we had 
been [00:45:00] pre-pandemic, and so we had more, I feel like, widened roles so to speak than 
we had before. 
 
AG:  That makes sense.  Do you feel like you’re kind of level of responsibility also expanded 
because of the demands of the pandemic? 
 
LM:  Yes, absolutely.  ‘Cause we had sicker patients; therefore, there was more going wrong; 
therefore, more things to be on the lookout for, and so more responsibility absolutely. 
 
AG:  Are there any services that you would like to see either expanded or provided for veterans 
that don’t exist currently? 
 
LM:  I feel like the service that I think needs expanded the most would definitely be mental 
health because yes we do have mental health services, but I feel like there’s always room for 
improvement because the majority of these patients have some sort of mental health from their 
time in the service or even sometimes it’s not their time in the service, but a lot of these patients 
suffer from all sorts of mental health illnesses, and often the wait times to get in can be lengthy; 
therefore, I feel like a lot of these patients would benefit if there were more mental health 
services for them. 
 
[46:27] AG:  Yeah.  That’s an excellent point.  I’m wondering if there’s anyone in your life that 
you think of as a professional role model or who guided you.  I know your mom and your aunt 
were both also nurses, but you know either them or someone (inaudible 0:46:42.1)? 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
19 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
LM:  I would definitely have to say my mom for sure.  She definitely has been the biggest role 
model for me ‘cause I’ve always seen how she has been as a nurse, as a manager.  I remember as 
a kid in cheer if someone got injured, I’d be like “oh, my mom’s a nurse.  Let me ask my mom” 
so I was always very proud of her, and I never thought “she’s a manager.  She’s not in” -- and 
thinking back now, and I’m like “well, maybe I got a little over zealous with that”, but I mean 
like I said I was always very proud of her, and she’s always been the biggest role model, and so I 
always have seen how she’s treated her staff as a manager, and eventually when I do go into 
management, she’s the one I’m looking at for my role model of what a good manager looks like 
to me. 
 
AG:  That makes sense.  How long do you have before you’re done with your current degree? 
 
LM:  I should be done the middle to end of October. 
 
AG:  So soon. 
 
LM:  Yes. 
 
AG:  That’s exciting.  And are you enjoying the course work that you’re doing for the MA?  
Does it relate to the work that you’ve done so far or is it completely different when you’re 
thinking about management? 
 
LM:  I enjoy it.  It is a lot different.  It’s more how to communicate effectively as a manager, 
how to be a leader versus a manager, and so it is different than what I’m doing.  It’s not skills 
based like what I’ve been doing. It’s more how to be a leader, how to be a manager, and that 
kind of stuff so I am enjoying it.  It’s definitely different. 
 
[48:26] AG:  Wonderful.  So I just have a couple more questions.  I don’t know if this is 
something you can speak to.  I know it sounds like there have been some changes particularly 
like with the shift from paper to electronic charting, and that kind of stuff, but has the VA 
changed since you’ve been working there that you’ve seen? 
 
LM:  So my particular VA has changed quite a bit.  We’re in a like 1970s building, 1960s 
building so since I’ve been there, there’s definitely been some face lifts happening so we don’t 
look like we’re stuck in the 70s anymore.  Our Director has been working on changing where 
certain clinics are to make it more easily accessible for the patients where they’re not having to 
go all the way up to the seventh floor for a surgery clinic.  So now they can just go down to like 
the first floor or something.  So there has been some changes as far as that.  There’s been, I’d say 
more -- there’s been a bigger turnover -- I wouldn’t say turnover, change in leadership roles and 
different leaders coming in, and trying to fix things or change things so there has been some 
change.  Absolutely. 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
20 
2020012, Nursing America’s Veterans 
AG:  Have some of the like leadership changes and improvements, have they helped or like 
improved the services in your opinion? 
 
LM:  I would say some of the manager change has improved services, yes. 
 
AG:  What about your job or your role in particular?  Has that changed since you started? 
 
LM:  My [00:50:00] particular role hasn’t really changed too much.  I mean when I first started I 
was low man on the totem pole, but now that I’ve been there for a little bit longer more often 
than not I am functioning in the charge nurse role on the night shift which there’s really not 
much extra to that besides just preparing paper that just talks about all the different patients so 
that the next shift knows, and also making, you know, if a patient comes deciding which nurse is 
going to get it or whatever.  So that’s probably been the only real change is that I’ve added that 
in, but other than that. 
 
AG:  And this is the last question which is just is there anything else that you’d like to add before 
we conclude? 
 
LM:  I can’t think of anything. 
 
AG:  Well this has been wonderful.  Thank you so much -- 
 
LM:  -- yes -- 
 
AG:  -- for your time, and for sharing all of your experience. 
 
LM:  Absolutely.  Thank you.
