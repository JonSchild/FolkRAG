                of ethnic art traditions in more than twenty ethnic communities in Chicago, and was
                jointly sponsored by both organizations.

                                performances are appreciated more by American audiences than ethnic

                                rather than as ethnic organizations; social organizations will be
                                continued through children; singing clubs are traditional among

                                Chicago, consisting of an interview with Karl Laschet, a key figure
                                in the Chicago German American community; a fragment of the

                                Chicago and America, there are 650,000 American od German descent in

                                background and life, on German togetherness; chief characteristics
                                of German ethnics are hard-working, the desire for personal
                                achievement is important, they tend to avoid politics to attain
                                goals, personal and family discipline should be the first concern,
                                then community, freedom does not mean by-passing personal effort; on
                                government assistance for the German ethnic community, Laschet would
                                support government assistance in the establishment of a German
                                cultural center, but community involvement is important, if money is
                                to be given for cultural purposes, it should be given to (folk)
                                cultural purposes as well as to forms of high culture. Part 3 of a
                                3-part recording made at Laschet's Inn at 2119 W. Irving Park Rd.,
                                Chicago, consisting of an interview with Karl Laschet, a key figure
                                in the Chicago German American community; a fragment of the
                                interview is transcribed in the additional related object cited in
                                this record; topics include Mayor Bilandic and his concerns for
                                continental European ethnic groups in Chicago; how few city
                                employees are German ethnics; Germans are hardworkers, not
                                protesters for their cause; German Americans support Venetian night
                                in Chicago, a city-sponsored, lakeside festival; the togetherness of
                                German Americans in Chicago today is achieved through the numerous
                                German clubs in this area, not every German ethnic is a member of a
                                club, but they frequently support club efforts and activities, this
                                variation in the participation of German-Americans in ethnic
                                activities is an expression of American freedom; on neo-Nazi
                                activities in Chicago and its effects on the German-American
                                community; on German Americans in politics and support for Mayor
                                Bilandic; comments in support of Chicago.

                                of 5-part interview with Mary O'Reilly about her work in the Folk

                                Fair exhibit, Irish Americans lack knowledge about Irish culture,

                                different value systems, heavily tied in with the church, Irish
                                Americans used to be the police but not any more; children born here
                                become American through peer association and schools, and only have
                                St. Patrick's Day Irishness; about the Irish Fellowship Club in

                                Irish Americans; Mary O'Reilly's own biases, she is proud to be
                                Irish if successful; about the persistence (or lack) of patterns of
                                behavior around Irish rites of passage and festivals in Chicago;
                                Mary O'Reilly thinks not, theses died out 40 years ago; Roman
                                Catholicism is more standardized now and today Irish Americans are
                                no different in religious observance than other ethnic groups, no
                                particular devotion to Irish saints, but novenas are still popular,
                                and First Friday Devotions. Part 4 of 5-part interview with Mary

                                according to the Chancery Office; how there is a drop off in
                                religious vocations among Irish Americans, which is also a
                                world-wide phenomenon, today there are more liberal attitudes to
                                religion; Mary O'Reilly has several friends who financially support
                                priests abroad; she notes a large gap between the generations,
                                children today have more than their parents had, know more, are more
                                materially minded, and more cynical; about the Council of Irish
                                Arts, Mary O'Reilly is negatively disposed towards it, an
                                organization in name only, essentially a theatre group that "never
                                got off the ground," but it has an Illinois State Charter, factions
                                developed and the organization split; Mary O'Reilly would like to
                                see an Irish center with appropriate facilities; Irish Americans
                                donate a lot of money to charity, mainly the Catholic Church; Irish
                                organizations currently active in Chicago include the Irish
                                Musicians Association, Gaelic Athletic Association, schools of
                                dancing, the Gaelic League, O'Neill School of Irish Music (run by
                                Noel Rice), the American Committee for Irish Studies with members in
                                Chicago universities; about Emmet Larkin's work on the Catholic
                                Church in Ireland; Mary O'Reilly is not knowledgeable about the
                                Ancient Order of Hibernians activities in Chicago, or the Knights of
                                Columbus; there are very few Irish County organizations, the ones
                                she knows are for Clare, Kerry, Mayo, Cork, and Down; there is a
                                Shamrock American Club, a very old organization with a strong
                                religious orientation; big festivals include Rose of Tralee, Mary
                                from Dungloe, and St. Patrick's; these have influenced the
                                development of festivals in Ireland; about St. Patrick's Day, then
                                there is lots of employment for performers; what Mary O'Reilly
                                thinks needs to be done to improve the state of the ethnic arts
                                among the Irish Community, more on the history of Ireland in the
                                schools, this must precede involvement in the arts; Irish arts are
                                not appreciated by most Irish Americans, Ireland is seen as a second
                                rate nation in America; perhaps music needs to be encouraged, or an
                                Irish library, or theatre; funding can have negative effects if used
                                badly, about the problems sometimes associated with funding; about
                                Noel Rice's Irish Music School. Part 5 of 5-part interview with Mary
                                O'Reilly about her work in the Folk Fair with Irish Exhibition, and
                                other topics, including thoughts about Irish music (harp playing),
                                community dynamics among the Irish Americans, stores, and
                                neighborhoods; topic sequence includes how Mary O'Reilly feels a
                                school of traditional music should be organized; about harp playing;
                                about organizational splits and factionalism in Irish American
                                communities and organizations; husband Tom Reilly joins the
                                conversation; says that he feels the problem of factions has carried
                                over from home, he feels the Irish are more divided than other
                                groups but doesn't know for sure, Mary disagrees, saying that some
                                other groups are worse; Tom on the topic of community needs, says
                                there is a need for an Irish center, potential problems discussed,
                                musicians deserve support, Mary sees need for publications and says
                                she doesn't know if an Irish center is really all that necessary;
                                about how Irish American neighborhoods in the city are now gone, the
                                community is brought together through Irish radio hours (6 in all);
                                Irish Northern Aid activities; the Gaelic Athletic Association,
                                etc., and the Irish American News; about how Ireland very accessible
                                today through travel; about import stores, advertised in the Irish
                                American News; Mary and Tom disagree about the Irish image in
                                America, Tom feels the average American is generally ill-informed
                                about Europe.

        Part 1 of 2-part interview with Noel Rice about teaching Irish music
                                and dance in Chicago, about groups and competition; the fieldworker
                                reports that this interview was conducted late at night in a
                                restaurant, with music, the clattering of cutlery, and occasional
                                rumbles of digestion in the background; the recorded part of the
                                interview followed a candid conversation about Chicago's Irish
                                American community that was not appropriate to record; topics
                                include Rice's own involvement in Irish music in Chicago; about the
                                Comhaltas Irish music preservation organization; about teaching
                                children to play music, and the instruments selected, problems in
                                obtaining music and getting teachers; about the club Rice has
                                started; how much the young people pay, which children they are
                                aiming at, how he advertised the school, problems in finding a place
                                to teach, what Irish generation the children come from, necessity
                                for parental approval; about competitions, dancing, the quickest and
                                most tangible results in teaching dancing, there is a need for
                                competent older children to provide models; about Noel Rice's own
                                background, how he learned music, when came to America (1956) and
                                why, where he has worked, came to Chicago (1960), involvement in
                                music club and why he resigned, relates to a faction that started
                                their own club on Chicago's north side, 1973; about the effects of
                                tours by Irish musicians; how a group established affiliation with
                                Comhaltas and why that is important. Part 2 of 2-part interview with
                                Noel Rice about teaching Irish music and dance in Chicago; the
                                fieldworker reports that this interview was conducted late at night
                                in a restaurant, with music, the clattering of cutlery, and
                                occasional rumbles of digestion in the background; the recorded part
                                of the interview followed a candid conversation about Chicago's
                                Irish American community that was not appropriate to record; topics
                                include teaching in Chicago; about various ways of publicly
                                expressing Irish identity among Chicago Irish Americans; about
                                crafts, there is a a little painting but Noel Rice felt it was "not
                                ethnic"; not much in the Celtic fine arts either, there is one
                                uilleann pipe maker, now getting very old; about Noel Rice's own
                                occupations since coming to Chicago, how his music ties in with his
                                general life style, there are Ceilidhes on the north side; about his
                                children and their involvement in Irish music; the need for social
                                contact ; about the areas where Irish culture in Chicago needs
                                assistance, areas of priority, and why; Rice feels that music keeps
                                the culture together, without dance and music, no singing; music "is
                                the mortar that holds them all together"; most of the great
                                musicians in Chicago are getting old and their skill not being
                                passed on; about the dancing scene, Rice feels it is well taken care
                                of, there are perhaps 5,000 children learning Irish dance in
                                Chicago, and only 50 children learning music from him; about the
                                traditional singing scene, it is in a desperate state, there is one
                                teacher; about the learning process; about sean-nos (old style)
                                singing, and Rice's determination to keep it alive.

                                between musicians and dancers, for example, the jig; the rift is not
                                as wide in Chicago as in other areas; set dancing is not taught,
                                limited figure dancing is taught but more stylized than folk
                                dancing, Denis Dennehy thinks Irish step dancing is not really a
                                folk form, it requires too much training, it is more of an art form,
                                nevertheless it is seen as Irish folk dancing by other ethnic
                                groups, and the roots of these dances are traditionally Irish
                                traditions; about Ceili dancing, the Commission handbook offers
                                dances that are more "folk," and this is obligatory for teachers to
                                know, the contexts for this also can be found outside competitions;
                                about the Dennehy's own school, gifted pupils, many competition
                                winners; about Chicago competitions and problems in running them,
                                financial breakdown, entrance fees, admission fees, costuming
                                standards, what's an appropriate costume for boys or girls; how
                                competitions have positive and negative aspects, parents and
                                teachers can be more upset than pupils, however, competition raises
                                standards; about the attitude of parents to competitions; what
                                pupils do when they finish taking dancing lessons and entering
                                competitions, often they stop dancing, there are no opportunities to
                                get together for dancing because the Irish community is so
                                dispersed, what might be done to recreate contexts, there is a lack
                                of facilities, like an Irish cultural center, there are no Irish
                                halls.

                                hundred coming up."

                                American dancing standards are governed by attitudes among top
                                dancers in Ireland; teachers are forced to enter their kids for
                                competitions, they have "winning complexes"; the next segment is a
                                conversation with Peggy Roche Boyle's husband, Jimmy Boyle, how he
                                developed interest in his Irish background, how he started to dance,
                                how he and Peggy met, his attitude to performing in pubs, when he
                                learns, about his singing and his songs, where he gets them, the
                                influence of the Clancy Brothers.

                                for commercial recordings. Part 2 of 2-part interview with Pat Roche
                                about Irish dance in Chicago, Roche born in Ireland in 1905, came to
                                America 1930, founded Harp and Shamrock Club, topics include
                                development of Irish dancing style (tempo, steps, etc.) over the
                                years; Pat Roche sees a constant progression; how he took his star
                                pupils and taught them how to teach, "Most of the best teachers
                                today are my pupils"; competitions are an important instrument for
                                improvement in standards; why Pat Roche sees dancing as building
                                character; discussion of his occupations since coming to America, in
                                the Depression, he had his own business, peddled eggs, tea, coffee;
                                then a fireman, then engineer, retired 1976; how Pat Roche found
                                room for dancing, hard times, where he has lived in Chicago; how his
                                children do and do not keep up Irish traditions; Pat Roche still
                                dances, and thinks that the current state of dancing in Chicago is
                                good, he sees dancing as keeping Irish Americans united; about step
                                dancing and how Roche tried to get parents to learn set dancing, he
                                feels Irish ceili dancing could be as popular in informal settings
                                as square dancing; why dancing teachers don't teach the old sets,
                                Pat Roche is dubious about the authenticity of the old country sets,
                                adds comments on British exploitation of Ireland; more description

        Part 1 of a 2-part interview with astrologer James Black, 6319 Drexel
                                Ave, Chicago; Black's interest in astrology from childhood; in 1907
                                in Alabama he was taught Egyptian astronomy by a 115-year-old
                                African, a free man, not enslaved; the man appeared under the oak
                                tree where Black would view the stars; this man was purposely sent;
                                lived in an abandoned mine, and gave Black 18 months of teaching;
                                the man was steeped in African lore, mentioned Nigeria; Black says
                                West African astronomy is basically Egyptian astronomy; stars move
                                by God-power, perpetual motion, "all is flux;" the best astrologers
                                had to withstand sun, black skin protects from sun; stars are God's
                                living bible; shepherds as astrologers, may have been taught by
                                beings not of Earth; astrology is the means by which God talks to
                                men; Black said "I have been blessed with this understanding and
                                speak with authority"; this is knowledge that all need; in astrology
                                time is of the essence; about first slaves in 1616 and 1619, at 15
                                degrees under certain signs; blacks will ultimately be the salvation
                                of America; karma; Lincoln wrote the Emancipation Proclamation when
                                Libra was rising, Aries setting, and Neptune was in the first house;
                                Declaration of Independence with Pisces at midheaven, Gemini rising,
                                Sagittarius setting; Jupiter rules blacks, Mercury ruled whites;
                                Jupiter is stronger than Mercury; Black has studied for 69 years,
                                knows 144 ways to cast a chart; about Harry Truman's campaign as
                                turning point; Jack Kennedy's assassination; astrology is a science
                                for blacks but they are the last to recognize it; about Roland J.
                                Sidney (naprapathic healing), African mysticism. Part 2 of a 2-part
                                interview with astrologer James Black, 6319 Drexel Ave, Chicago;
                                Black states that astrology reveals nature of artistic gifts, if
                                taught in grammar school, divorce and criminal behavior would be
                                reduced; children would find their own true value; about the future
                                for blacks, awakening to something they don't understand, connect to
                                the past, heritage and pride.

                                eating, fighting on weekends; Mississippi and Chicago are much
                                alike, but more rights up North; in the St. Louis branch of his
                                family, 300 members; Montgomery was raised by his grandfather, his
                                mother was 12 when he was born; started working at age 12; at one
                                point went to a reform school, and graduated; final schooling in

                                joints, including Theresa's Lounge; Philip Guy was playing there,

                                Theresa's in 1972; death of family members interrupted this, still
                                performs there but not on regular basis; Theresa's is the best blues
                                club; about the audience, many blacks don't like blues or just
                                pretend; the blues are for real, you can't fool the blues audience,
                                blues are a feeling.

        Part 1 of a 2-part interview with M.C. Barrett, astrologer, at his
                                home at 5326 S. Cornell, apartment 214; topics include biograhpy,
                                Barrett was born in Chicago in 1946, his mother was sick and he was
                                raised by an aunt until he was about 6 years old, then foster home
                                to age 11, went to Catholic Church and was baptized a second time,
                                then Marigold Academy, then another foster home, then Parker High
                                School and Our Lady of Mercy High School (Chicago Mercy High
                                School?), began studying astrology at age 16, but at college had
                                difficulties with faculty, in the U.S. Army in 1967, also difficult,
                                Ft. Polk LA; about Barrett's mother Gloria Barrett, had MS when M.C.
                                was age 4; the Army difficulties continued, Barrett did not want to
                                go to Vietnam, went AWOL, received help from Congressman Ralph
                                Metcalfe Sr to move on, started work as interior and architectural
                                designer, still not a good fit and Barrett continued to pursue
                                astrology, "I live my life partially by astrology but not totally by
                                astrology," about the need for astrologers to work with clients in
                                careful way, astrology teaches people how to take their destiny
                                intheir own hands, touches everything in human nature, about the
                                practice, and how astrology is "ingrained" for African Americans,
                                about relation to organized religion, this is a foggy period between
                                Acquarius and Pisces, about the level of consciousness in Chicago's
                                African American community, stifled, need jobs and income. Part 2 of
                                a 2-part interview with M.C. Barrett, astrologer, at his home at
                                5326 S. Cornell, apartment 214; discussion of astrology as an art,
                                it is both art and human expression, it is an art based on science,
                                art is a projection of deepest feelings, uses intuition, beautiful
                                rapport with clients, about the origins of astrology, persecution by
                                the Vatican but also revered there, where you find the biggest
                                astrological library in the world, looking to a new path, great
                                mental strides have been made in recent years.

                                to spread the word; 20 years in blues, blues is not written but
                                felt, about the music industry and exposure; about lack of support
                                from funding organizations; desireable to have more cultural
                                exchange via outdoor performances, to reach teenagers and children
                                who cannot come into clubs, these are tomorrow's musicians and fans;
                                Dizz enjoys Blue Monday, blues is more legitimate than rock; issues
                                in reaching young black listeners; airplay and live concerts would
                                provide an alternative to industry methods.

                                the performers are unidentified; it is possible that the featured
                                performer is Muddy Waters Jr. (as on the preceding two reels); the
                                audio quality is challenging because the recording was made by
                                capturing sound from the bar's public address system loudspeakers;
                                this recording features four unnamed blues numbers, the first of
                                which segues to "Sunshine of Your Love."

                                3-part recording of blues music at Theresa's Lounge, 4801 South
                                Indiana Ave; musicians include John [surname unknown], guitar,
                                Ernest Johnson, drums, Nate Applewhite, may also include vocals by
                                Roger Johnson and guitar by Samuel [Lawhorn]; the audio quality is
                                challenging because the recording was made by capturing sound from
                                the bar's public address system loudspeakers; selections include
                                "The Power of Love"; the singer introduces Junior Wells from the
                                audience and then continues with the song; banter and remarks by
                                Junior Wells, introduction to the song, banter with the audience;
                                "Love Her With a Feeling" featuring Junior Wells's singing and
                                harmonica playing; "Keys to the Highway"; "Help Me" with harmonica,
                                seems to continue to feature Junior Wells (audio levels low);
                                impromptu tribute by to Sonny Boy Williamson by Wells, one of his
                                mentors.

                                knowing how to read music, all by ear; plays the accordion, a
                                mazurka, then a polka, then a tarantella; discussion of the dance
                                and of the accordion as an instrument of the farmlands in southern
                                Italy; how playing now makes him remember the beauties of Calabria;

                                microphone placement means that the accordion drowns out his voice.

        Morra is a traditional Italian multi-player hand game in which each
                                player extends fingers and calls out a number that is the likely
                                total number of fingers for all players; correct calls score
                                points.

                                Taller, recorded at the El Taller office at 1039 W. Grace St.,

                                outline of Board, collective, and members; members of the
                                collective, Ramirez is one of five; reason for starting was to
                                channel creativity, involve the community, develop alternatives to
                                gang membership for street youth; at first members were younger
                                people, later picked up adults and academics; the building funded
                                through the Lutheran Church, the first big boost; about the building
                                as place to meet, work, and exchange ideas; El Taller formalized as
                                an organization after trips to New York to view other similar groups
                                there; the group has held workshops on poetry, murals,
                                silk-screening, photography, guitar, and congas; about the
                                collective organization; the special issue of the Revista
                                Chicano-Riquena on poetry and art from El Taller as one workshop
                                project, partially funded by Illinois Arts Council, involving kids
                                in murals and poetry; El Tallerâ€˜s philosophy is to promote and
                                develop artists and their skills; performing arts workshops on
                                guitar and conga, recitals or shows of products and skills at the
                                end of workshops; need to develop workshops, darkroom, coffee house,
                                and gallery in their new storefront location; funds for three
                                congueros (congresos?), other work is volunteer; moving toward more
                                community involvement, want a concentration on Latino artists and
                                themes but also to deal with the whole neighborhood in which a
                                project takes place; will emphasize Puerto Rican activities but also
                                work with parallel Mexican American organizations like ALBA, MARCH

                                discussion of theater group "Circulo Teatral de Chicago" founded in
                                1970; they are preparing a bilingual brochure; not a purely Cuban
                                performing group, most actors are Mexicans, performances have been
                                in Spanish, with sources in Latin America, Europe, and North
                                America; discussion of Mexican Independence Day for TV last year,
                                about TV as an outlet for their work; complains about changes in the
                                policy of the Museum of Science and Industry concerning theater;
                                about past performances, some dramas they have written; about money
                                matters; plays about Viet Nam and illegal immigration, comments
                                about the writers and past performances; about the Channel 44
                                program with Jimmy Payne where they have performed; about folk
                                dancing with Cuban themes; funding from Castillo and friends, large
                                losses, the museum gave little to help except the place to perform;
                                now seek TV exposure hoping to reach a larger audience; plans for
                                Mexican Independence Day celebration and performance; more
                                productions aimed at Mexicans, for now none for Puerto Ricans, few
                                for Cubans, this due to size of population; about difficulties in
                                work with museum, de Castillo has severed contact with them; the
                                scenery for plays was built and the plays were rehearsed in his
                                basemen; expresses need for a permanent theater for rehearsal and
                                building of sets; reaction of the community to their dramatic
                                presentations, comments on problems due to lack of central location,
                                climate, and publicity; the community response to TV performances
                                has been good in spite of poor promotion; members of the troupe do
                                it because they like it, have studied it, want to share it with
                                Chicago's large Spanish-speaking community. Part 2 of a 3-part
                                interview in Spanish with Efren de Castillo, recorded in the offices
                                of OMAR, 5525 N. Broadway; topics pertain to theater group "Circulo
                                Teatral de Chicago" and continues (from part 1) on the nature of
                                their work and goals; actors and audience work through a performance
                                together, goal to contribute something, to offer works of quality;
                                de Castillo started making scenery in Cuba but there were problems
                                with Castro's regime; today he plans scenes and directs now, started
                                with beginners but didn't want to teach drama but rather promote,
                                design, and direct; laments lack of good instruction in drama in
                                Chicago in Spanish; de Castillo started in Cuba as a scene painter
                                and was elevated to head of production at the drama school of the
                                university and the National Theater; about mixing contemporary and
                                classical styles, mentions works in Cuba and in Europe; came to
                                Chicago in 1965 but no work, then to Los Angeles for a few years and
                                then returned to Chicago, there had been problems with the union in
                                California, so returned to Chicago; started with OMAR in Chicago
                                designing ads for TV, radio, and press, uses his theater skills in
                                design and directing; why de Castillo left Cuba, where he had
                                respect, good jobs, good pay, etc., but was insecure since he was
                                never a revolutionary, he was always watched and had no freedom; his
                                brother was jailed for taking pictures for 7 months, friends
                                disappeared, fear led to his departure; de Castillo saw a community
                                play and didn't like it as art, had a line on disposing of old guard
                                technicians when they are no longer needed that struck home; about
                                the Cubans of Chicago, they came after the revolution as refugees or
                                to study, most went to New York or Miami, but there are a few here,
                                friends and family follow; some are professionals and
                                semi-professionals and business men, few rural folk; about other
                                Cuban groups in Chicago, the community tends to argue and they are
                                separate from other Latino groups; about Cuban rhythms in music and
                                dance and their difficult nature; the Cuban Lions Club promotes
                                local talent but has no performing group of its own; mentions Cruz
                                and Sociedad Hispanoamericana pro Arte y Cultura; pure Cuban groups
                                don't really exist; about cultural diversity of Cubans and lack of
                                unity; there are no Cuban music groups, there had been one but it
                                moved to Los Angeles; about salsa, asserts that it is of Cuban
                                origin, in terms of rhythm, not Puerto Rican. Part 3 of a 3-part
                                interview in Spanish with Efren de Castillo, recorded in the offices
                                of OMAR, 5525 N. Broadway; topics pertain to music; de Castillo has
                                a friend who defines salsa as "Ritmo cubano a la cual se le ha
                                retirado la ciudania" (a Cuban rhythm whose citizenship has been
                                removed); there is not much difference between Cuban and Puerto
                                Rican traditiona1 music but de Castillo is not sure if this is due
                                to shared heritage or mutual influences, maybe both; similar
                                instrumentation in both, the Puerto Rican cuatro is called a tiple
                                or tres in Cuba; about the use of bandurria, being replaced by
                                guitar; more comments on tiple, tres, and cuatro; the danza of
                                Puerto Rico is the contradanza of Cuba; de Castillo has videotapes
                                of some of his TV programs but nothing of the stage performances;
                                following the interview the fieldworker and de Castillo view parts
                                of some videotapes of some programs, with comment added.

                                church, Sparks had been frightened by the experience; about writing
                                and taking a writing class, the role of the teacher, taking
                                criticism in this context; biographical notes, Sparks had had
                                tuberculosis, lived for a while in the Southwest, then in a

                                people she met via this venue; musings on the future, what if she

        Part 1 of a 2-part recording of preaching and singing by Northside
                                Pentecostal Church (1527 E. Edgewater) on the street near Harry S.
                                Truman College, at W. Wilson and Racine Avenues in the Uptown
                                neighborhood; the preaching and witnessing is largely directed at
                                alcoholics and transients who habituate bars and a hotel in the
                                neighborhood; the targets for evangelism included whites, Indians,
                                and Spanish-speakers, but few African American (most who walked by
                                seemed not in need of intervention); the leader and pastor was Bobby
                                Goddard, as was Junior Zornes (Lawrence Edward Zornes Jr.) and his
                                wife, Dolly, and their son Jerry, who helped hold the microphones;
                                the lead singer and guitar player was Joann Bolen (from Beckley WV),
                                with her 15-year-old son Charles, both had come to Chicago 9Â½ years
                                ago; recorded on a stereo Nagra IV with a Sennheiser 802 hand-held
                                microphone and a Sennheiser 402 on a stand; due to an error in
                                tracing the cables, the fieldworker confused the inputs and much of
                                these two recordings has the volume up on the hand-held mike while
                                it is lying on the ground some distance from the action, and thus
                                the recording is of inferior fidelity; the first segment of this
                                recording is monaural and includes Bobby Goddard with a short
                                introduction; the hymn: "When the Roll is Called up Yonder";
                                discussion by Goddard (whose public address system microphone is
                                producing feedback); hvmn "We'll be Called to Meet Him in the Air";
                                Goddard remarks on meeting the Lord; hymn "Soon Comes the Judgement
                                Day," also audible is the sound of a sinner being prayed over,
                                kneeling in front of the singers; the second segment of this
                                recording is in stereo, with the left channel silent or at very low
                                levels; right channel carries the voice of an older man preaching,
                                with the hymn "In that Beautiful Citv of Gold" in the background;
                                hymn "I searched for Him . . . He filled that longing in my soul,"
                                during this hymn, the left channel (?) is heard at high volume; next
                                segment, on the left is the sound of a sinner being prayed over
                                while on the right there is testimony from a man from West Virginia
                                and a woman, about family problems, while in the background an
                                inebriated man complains that the service has woken him up; hymn " .
                                . . to be sanctified" begins on left and right channels but the
                                level on the rights drops off; on the next segment, there is
                                preaching on the left channel, may be Junior Zornes, then the hymn
                                "I can't help what others do . . ."; then Goddard's main sermon with
                                the text from Proverbs 16:25; recording continues with better audio
                                on the left and poor audio on the right; the sermon continues on
                                part 2. Part 2 of a 2-part recording of preaching and singing by
                                Northside Pentecostal Church (1527 E. Edgewater) on the street near
                                Harry S. Truman College, at W. Wilson and Racine Avenues in the
                                Uptown neighborhood; the preaching and witnessing is largely
                                directed at alcoholics and transients who habituate bars and a hotel
                                in the neighborhood; the targets for evangelism included whites,
                                Indians, and Spanish-speakers, but few African American (most who
                                walked by seemed not in need of intervention); the leader and pastor
                                was Bobby Goddard, as was Junior Zornes (Lawrence Edward Zornes Jr.)
                                and his wife, Dolly, and their son Jerry, who helped hold the
                                microphones; the lead singer and guitar player was Joann Bolen (from
                                Beckley WV), with her 15-year-old son Charles, both had come to
                                Chicago 9Â½ years ago; recorded on a stereo Nagra IV with a
                                Sennheiser 802 hand-held microphone and a Sennheiser 402 on a stand;
                                due to an error in tracing the cables, the fieldworker confused the
                                inputs and much of these two recordings has the volume up on the
                                hand-held mike while it is lying on the ground some distance from
                                the action, and thus the recording is of inferior fidelity; the
                                first segment of this recording is a continuation of Bobby Goddard's
                                sermon from part 1, mostly on the left channel with some on the
                                right; a man interrupts with a request to "praise the man in the
                                yellow shirt" (across the street); hymn "Please let me walk with you
                                Jesus . . . " led by Joann Bolen; closing remarks by Goddard, with
                                some audible heckling; final segment, left channel has mixed
                                post-service conversation in which a woman named Huffman (Hoffman?)
                                talks to Goddard about a sermon, right channel also has mixed
                                post-service conversation; duration of part 2 is about 14
                                minutes.

                                the congregational response on the right, with delay at the start as
                                the right microphone is repositioned and its module is switched from
                                402 to 802. The tape runs out during the sermon, recording continues

                                to his proximity to the microphone; then an ending announcement, and
                                for a bit, the tape continues to roll.

                                Northside church, Dean had been in the Assemblies of God
                                denomination for thirty years prior to joining Northside; about
                                Joann Bolen and her husband, from Beckley WV; other members of the

                                fieldworker moves the microphone, clips to Goddard's shirt; Goddard
                                explains that he has been the Northside pastor for seven years, he
                                and another man started with a storefront; the current building had
                                been Lutheran, the Church of God, now Pentecostal; Goddard's
                                storefront church had been in the 2300 block of Lincoln Ave near

                                Goddard's home is on the western side of Lake View; Goddard says
                                that the Northside members come from every part of Chicago, more
                                from Lake View, Uptown, and Rogers Park; Goddard has a bus he uses
                                to bring people to church, its route includes Albany Park, Lake
                                View, Uptown, sometime he stops as specific homes, sometimes at

                                children; Goddard is working on getting a larger bus into operation;
                                Goddard was 28 when he came to Chicago in 1959, married no children;
                                had been truck driver at coal mines but they were shutting down;
                                Goddard arrived in a Sunday and met his brother the next day, then
                                got a job in a gasket factory in Skokie, four and half miles away;
                                about people going back to the South, Goddard said, "Oh yes, that's
                                why we have such a small church, our people all head back South";
                                there is also a great movement to the suburbs, suburban Pentecostal
                                churches are the only ones growing today; about the "sections" of
                                Goddard's branch of Pentecostalism, Illinois has 12 sections; 17
                                churches in Chicago and near suburbs with average of from 50-70
                                members, although one has 350; about Uptown, as a neighborhood from
                                migrants from the South over time, Goddard remembers arriving and
                                hopes to move before long; about his feelings about Raleigh County,
                                "my heart is set on the work of God, I feel Chicago is the greatest
                                mission field in the entire world"; Goddard's mother and wife's
                                parents still in WV; how Goddard hopes the church will grow and he
                                will be able to quit his job; about the call the be preacher,
                                Goddard felt it strongly, "the Bible became real to me, as if I'm
                                living with the Apostles"; Goddard says that he outlines his
                                sermons, he sits by himself and thoughts come to him, inspired by
                                God, he jots notes on paper, the starting point is always a Bible
                                verse; Goddard studies the Bible, and a concordance, late at night,
                                certain verses become real to him; how the Lord used material things
                                to bring about the spiritual; Goddard had been raised as a Baptist;
                                when preaching now, sometimes he gets in the spirit and the notes
                                are set aside; how members get anointed and words come fast; about
                                mastering the skill to preach, role of experience.

        Part 1 of a 4-part interview with sister and brother Jania Sajewski
                                (Jeanette Sajewski Terley or Jeannette Sajewski Terlikowski) and
                                Alvin Sajewski in their music store, 1227 Milwaukee Ave; about
                                contacts to visit, Jeanette recommends Fr. Donald Bilinski (Polish
                                Museum of America), the Daily Zgoda, and Dr. Bzienski; then
                                discussion of how local musicians come to the store, mostly polka
                                orchestra members, long tradition of Polish music in the Chicago
                                area and polka is at its height, even with young people; polka has
                                been here from the time of the first settlers; the old timers played
                                by ear, violin, clarinet, coronet, button accordions; music was an
                                important part of leisure time, songs were passed on through the
                                generations; how groups were formed to play at weddings and other
                                functions, first informal, later with more training, some were
                                composers; Polish and English translations were used; Jeanette and
                                Alvin know most of musicians in the Polish tradition in the area;
                                Alvin describes how they [including his father Wladyslaw] helped
                                musicians get their start, how they helped the recording companies
                                with advice; we grew up with the cylinder records, folks wanted
                                Polish music if they were to purchase phonographs, the Sajewskis
                                agreed to stock and sell phonographs if Polish records were made,
                                then they helped the musicians produce the records, also published
                                sheet music, what the people wanted generated the demand; Frank
                                Przybylski worked with their father; he would transcribe a tune from
                                the person who knew it and then it would be printed, also songs were
                                composed for special events; this all started around 1910 or 1911;
                                Alvin describes immigration to Chicago, how people lived when they
                                arrived, churches were formed, there was a need for a gathering
                                place such as a church hall, life centered around the parish, music
                                including hymns were common; St. Joseph's day was important;
                                Sajewski published hymns too, and songs in Polish for Mother's Day;
                                music would be used by the parochial schools, for example, in
                                programs for the mothers, or the pastor's name day or mother
                                superior's name day; Alvin says "It all starts with that little
                                church first"; then comes the need for schools, English and Polish
                                in them, children participated; how the Sajewski's music business
                                was involved because of the needs generated by the schools, Polish
                                songs for the first graders; this was 25 years ago, all in Polish,
                                not so much now; but today Polish is offered in some schools, as
                                well as in ethnic community Saturday schools; there are important
                                Polish fraternal organizations such as the Polish National Alliance
                                (PNA), the Polish Roman Catholic Union (PRCU), the Polish Wornen's
                                Alliance, all wish to teach children Polish; Polonia (Polish
                                Chicago) is on the south side, around 47th and Ashland, and in
                                Sajewski's neighborhood; the music store also published Polish plays
                                from 1910-15 to about 1930-34, performances in parishes, fundraiser
                                like carnivals, ways for the young people to get money for the
                                parish; before WWII there was not much outside entertainment,
                                comments about the kinds of entertainment in Polonia before the war;
                                about young people's activities, their social life, the ways boys
                                met girls; there were masses for the children daily, also various
                                societies in the parishes, e.g., the St. Ann's Society for women,
                                others for young people; there were plays in Polish for 6th grade
                                and up, and graduation songs, and there were "mock" Polish weddings,
                                a staged event with invitations to parishioners so they could
                                participate, discussion of mock weddings continues in part 2. Part 2
                                of a 4-part interview with sister and brother Jania Sajewski
                                (Jeanette Sajewski Terley or Jeannette Sajewski Terlikowski) and
                                Alvin Sajewski in their music store, 1227 Milwaukee Ave; about mock
                                weddings, continued from part 1was a great money maker; folks paid
                                for the food, there would be a traditional bride dance and folks
                                would try to break plates by throwing silver dollars at them;
                                another activity was the Polish minstrel show where people would
                                dress in oriental costumes but speak Polish; these were run by
                                parishes and not by professional entertainers, people could get
                                their start this way, later some might become professional actors
                                and actresses; song fests were big and Sajewski's published sheet
                                music and books for these; today, Sajewski publishes polka music and
                                books, most for popular dancing; Alvin says nowadays, "If they play
                                an oberek [dance genre], they dance a polka to it"; piano became
                                popular around 1905 or so, and very popular around 1910-15, families
                                bought them, everybody wanted sewing machines too, sold door to door
                                from carts, then sheet music was wanted, Sajewski published same;
                                player piano rolls came out about 1919 or earlier and were
                                desirable; Poles and other ethnic groups wanted piano rolls and
                                created the demand; most worked at International Harvester or
                                Pullman, the store carried the pianos but needed rolls in other
                                languages; Alvin's father Wladyslaw approached the U.S. Music Roll
                                Company about to making Polish piano rolls, they wouldn't, so he
                                paid in advance and, in time, there were 140 Sajewski Specials;
                                another company was QRS Piano Rolls and they began printing the
                                words on the rolls; funeral homes wanted music to play in the
                                background during funerals, and they approached Sajewski the record
                                companies to produce these in Polish but could not offer large
                                enough sales, some funeral homes did experiment with Polish records
                                but it was not a success, the songs upset the Polish patrons, people
                                would associate the songs with the death of loved ones and get upset
                                whenever they'd hear that song; Jeanette shows instruction books
                                Sajewski did for piano players in Polish and English, there were
                                also used by teachers; some books are for choirs; these have Easter
                                and Christmas hymns in them, sold to Churches and to people who used
                                them at home; there is a sing-along book with popular old time
                                Polish songs called the Radio Songbook because a radio show
                                advertised the book, first published around 1943; Sajewski's
                                advertised on Polish radio shows; Jeanette says doctors recommended
                                during WWII that depressed persons listen to music, and songs from
                                previous wars were recycled; Jeanette shows the latest polka books,
                                musicians used to need music for each instrument but now music is
                                mostly read, so just need two, C and B-flat; Sajewski is very proud
                                of their dance instruction book for national Polish dances, with
                                charts for dances, music, and information about each dance, used in
                                dance schools in the U.S. and other nations; there are records with
                                the book, music played by the man who created the book, he was born
                                in Poland; Jeanette shows a record that was a great hit with the
                                American public, recorded by many artists including Bobby Vinton,
                                every daddy sang it to his daughter; Stephen J. Zielinski composed
                                the lyrics and Frank Przybylski the music; about immigrants after
                                WWII, Jeanette says they had their culture started and were not
                                lonesome for the home country like the folks who came in the 1910s
                                who clung together and whose hearts were linked to those left
                                behind; post-WWII the immigrants were already displaced from camps
                                and other places, simply alive and glad to be so, they wanted to fit
                                themselves into this country or any they came to live in, they have
                                more "international desire" and adapted more; some do come to the
                                store for modern music imported from Poland, and classical music,
                                and for folk songs done by choirs with ballet companies; Jeanette
                                appreciates these forms of music for the beauty but it does not have
                                the strength the country music did; Sajewskis have obtained records
                                from Poland since 1914-18, and through WWII. and now they get it in
                                greater volume, classical, rock and roll, jazz, folk songs, ballads,
                                all modern and in Polish, but Americans don't buy the jazz or rock
                                and roll since they have their own; some young people do buy it out
                                of curiosity, and some buy it for their relatives in Poland. Part 3
                                of a 4-part interview with sister and brother Jania Sajewski
                                (Jeanette Sajewski Terley or Jeannette Sajewski Terlikowski) and
                                Alvin Sajewski in their music store, 1227 Milwaukee Ave; about the
                                recent banquet honoring Sajewski, and about its program, which
                                includes a list of people Sajewski family helped to record; Jeanette
                                compiled the book; about the 9 children, 5 boys and 4 girls, and how
                                they all worked in the store as children; they lived over the store,
                                their dad Wladyslaw built a store at 1017 Milwaukee Ave. for the
                                family, with a 12 room apartment that offered 5 bedrooms, 2 living
                                rooms, a laundry room, kitchen, dining room; the store had custom
                                built oak cabinets and they were moved to the current store,
                                Jeanette says, "And we cherish these memories, it's been a whole
                                lifetime, two lifetimes, dad's and ours"; why and how they talked
                                Alvin into the testimonial dinner to celebrate the 80 years of
                                Sajewski's store; Alvin talks about his trip to Washington, DC [to
                                the American Folklife Center's 1977 Ethnic Recordings in America
                                conference], one of the happiest days of his life; about forgetting
                                his heart medicine, about meeting Myron Surmach and their long
                                acquaintance by mail; about a book of speeches also published by
                                Sajewski for name days or other occasions; a model to teach public
                                speaking; more about the Polish dance book (discussed in part 2),
                                how Wladyslaw had gone to Poland to find such a book but could not,
                                he returned and told his two colleagues they would have to write
                                one, so one got the music ready and the other took little dolls in
                                costume and set up a stage and moved them through the dances, in
                                order to work out the figures of the dance, charts of which are
                                drawn by hand; Alvin discusses how his father organized the first
                                travel excursion to Poland after WWI in 1927, when Lindbergh was f
                                lying across the ocean, they went by the ship Ile de France from
                                Chicago, Wladyslaw had organized the Polish Businessman's
                                Association and they sponsored the trip, which cost about $300, the
                                wine on the ship was special because it was prohibition in the U.S.;
                                their mother went on the second excursion; Alvin has never been to
                                Poland and has no desire to go, he has no relatives there, and has
                                little time for travel; Christmas is a rush time in the store and
                                family members come to help out, otherwise he and Jeanette manage
                                well; each of the other brothers grew out of the store, two became
                                pharmacists; Alvin went to high school and business college but
                                worked with his father all the time; the other siblings wanted to do
                                other things; by 1919-1920, he was his father's right hand man;
                                Wladyslaw died in 1948 but was active until the end; he remembers
                                that on a Saturday they finished in the store and were joking with
                                each other, Alvin went home and his father went upstairs, then on
                                Sunday they went to a Polish play at Holy Trinity school, and his
                                dad died in his seat there, his head fell onto their mother's
                                shoulder, it was April 14, he was waiting for the curtain to go up,
                                everyone there was a friend, a Polish radio announcer carried him
                                out, he never regained consciousness; they had worked as a team and
                                many times since, Alvin has felt his father's presence in the store;
                                especially when he has to make difficult decisions, mention the
                                Polish National Alliance (PNA) building dedication on the coming
                                weekend; Jeanette and Alvin show things from the testimonial dinner,
                                one from the Polish Disc Jockey's Association; Jeanette tells how
                                important it was to her to have this event; there are certificates
                                from the International Polka Association, from the Polish American
                                Press, document from the Pope, in Polish, an electric clock with the

                                hall with photos and records, catalogs from the early days,
                                assembled by a brother and brother-in-law; discussion of the
                                displays continues in part 4. Part 4 of a 4-part interview with
                                sister and brother Jania Sajewski (Jeanette Sajewski Terley or
                                Jeannette Sajewski Terlikowski) and Alvin Sajewski in their music

                                for records but the style changed, the "Beer Barrel Polka" had just
                                come out, young people wanted something new, Frankie Yankovic was
                                part of the new trend, the person who was recording him was
                                uncertain about the quality and asked Alvin about him, Alvin
                                reassured him.

        Part 1 of a 2-part interview with Wanda Krozel about her craft work,
                                biography, and her collection of Polish craft items; topics on this
                                recording include discussion of her parents, born in Poland as was
                                Krozel's husband [Josef], who is the president of the Highlanders
                                [probably the Polish Highlanders Alliance, a Chicago-based
                                organization for the Goral ethnic group of Poland] in his second 3
                                year term; Wanda Krozel has been in the group since she was a child,
                                her father was in it; about her collection of craft items, "I
                                appreciate anything that's hand done, where these people see it all
                                the time and think nothing of it"; Krozel picks up anything that
                                interests her, her first trip to Poland was in 1970 for her 25th
                                anniversary; her husband worked in Poland for a while and got things
                                for her during that period too; she has been to Poland every year
                                since that time; how she travels, 4 of her 6 children have gone too,
                                she. has 3 at home now; describes a trip made in the winter; not a
                                good time to go for her, she stays with her father's family in the
                                Podhale region; if she meets someone or sees something they have
                                that she likes, she asks them to get it for her or finds out where
                                it came from and gets it herself; she describes carving or engraving
                                on glass; work done by someone she met in Poland, also comments on a
                                man who paints on glass now in the U.S.; she likes any kind of
                                craft; Krozel shows her eggs, which she painted herself, she paints
                                eggs with watercolors, after penciling in the design; she uses
                                designs from postcards, towels, postage stamps, anywhere she can get
                                ideas; Krozel uses "double 0" brushes, the work is very fine; she
                                has a collection of things from which she can get ideas; the Polish
                                eggs are her favorites; because no one else does them, some have
                                Christmas themes, the Stations of the Cross; Krozel gives her eggs
                                away; she started doing eggs when a nun in the 8th grade gave her
                                class eggs to decorate for a priest, without suggestions, they were
                                to design on their own; she experiments with different kinds of eggs
                                to see if she can work with them, will create an egg for a friend on
                                a special occasion; Krozel's largest is a goose egg with a church
                                design, the smallest is a finch egg; she is full of ideas but has no
                                time to do them and is looking forward to being alone for 3 weeks on
                                her son's farm in Indiana; Krozel has never taken an art lesson and
                                is afraid to do things on her own, why she copies designs; a
                                neighbor who saw her eggs after she moved to present house about 15
                                years ago encouraged her to let others see them, she took them to a
                                PTA competition with other schools and has subsequently been showing
                                them in public; regarding her collection of craft items, Krozel
                                likes unusual things, comments on a few, most she has are modern and
                                made for the tourist trade like the inlaid straw pictures; about
                                painting on glass; about a doll maker whom she visited in Poland,

                                instructed Krozel in this craft; Krozel also does leather work and
                                carving; about a man who made inlaid boxes, he is back in Poland

                                (Krozel's role in the Highlanders is/was to arrange for public
                                displays of crafts and so on.); the collection includes items that
                                belong to her family, e.g., a box brought to her by her mother 40 or
                                so years ago, when Krozel was 4 years old, her mother had been
                                visiting in Poland and the box was from a cousin, the names are
                                marked on the bottom; as a child she treasured such things and
                                wanted to see who made them; she has made Polish costumes for her
                                children's dolls; about weaving and rug making, she knows a woman in
                                the U.S. whose husband made her a little hand loom to demonstrate
                                Polish weaving for Krozel's events; the woman has been in the U.S.
                                for 1 or 2 years, her husband came first and brought her over, they
                                meet at her house for the lessons in painting on glass; Krozel makes

                                organization, he was not interested in history; the group is now
                                made up of lots of second generations folks, and they have circles

        Part 1 of a 5-part interview with Collette and Konstanty (Konstanti)
                                Siemaczko in their home; Konstanty Siemaczko is a well-known
                                choreographer for several Polish American youth dance groups;
                                mention of Henryk Oskar Kolberg's multi-volume documentation of
                                Polish folklore; Konstanty has most of the set and uses it often;
                                Konstanty Siemaczko's biography, born December 1918, in Warsaw,
                                lived in Poland until 1940, in the naval academy and when WWII broke
                                out, he was in his senior year, was in the last unit to surrender to
                                the Germans, Oct. 6, 1939; he was a prisoner of war and escaped and
                                returned to Warsaw where he joined the underground, in 1940 he was
                                assigned to arrange a route from Warsaw to Hungary, but en route he
                                was caught with a sick friend whom he refused to leave alone in a
                                snow storm; the Germans gave him a field court and he was sentenced
                                to die as a guerilla fighter, execution set for the same day that
                                Paris fell to the Germans and they gave clemency to his group in
                                honor of this, and he was sent to a concentration camp near Berlin
                                and spent 5 years and 6 days there; Konstanty Siemaczko describes
                                the jobs he did in the camp; at the end of March the whole camp was
                                evacuated and they were marched from Berlin to another location
                                where 75,000 were evacuated and 15,000 arrived at the new
                                destination, many died of exhaustion and many were shot; the U.S.
                                6th Army was just across the boundary; he crossed and was free;
                                Konstanty Siemaczko then went to Paris and England, followed by a
                                return to Poland where he rejoined the Navy; subsequently he lived
                                in England for a while but wanted to go to the U.S.; his father was
                                in prison for about 10 years and he lost a lot of family during the
                                war; biographical account is continued in part 2. Part 2 of a 5-part
                                interview with Collette and Konstanty (Konstanti) Siemaczko in their
                                home; Konstanty Siemaczko is a well-known choreographer for several
                                Polish American youth dance groups; continuation of biographical
                                account from part 1; Konstanty Siemaczko wanted to come to America
                                because the philosophy of the American government is very similar to
                                that of the Polish government that existed between the wars, the
                                Polish constitution was based on the American model and was very
                                similar; Konstanty Siemaczko always felt like a foreigner in England
                                no matter what and, although he liked England, he had had enough of
                                this attitude; he asks rhetorically, "Who is American?" and says
                                that Americans are everybody who are in America, "I want to be there
                                where I am not foreigner"; Konstanty Siemaczko spent 10 years in
                                London and met his wife Colette (Collette Elsie McAllister, born in
                                UK) there, about the time they were married a lost cousin was found
                                to be in Chicago, this cousin met a friend of Siemaczko at a ball
                                and found out that he was in London, they wrote and the Siemaczkos
                                came to the U.S. in 1959 under the British quota which meant they
                                had no problems getting in; there is additional content in this part
                                of the recording, not summarized here. Part 3 of a 5-part interview
                                with Collette and Konstanty (Konstanti) Siemaczko in their home;
                                Konstanty Siemaczko is a well-known choreographer for several Polish
                                American youth dance groups; discussion of teaching dance as part of
                                Polish ethnic Saturday school activities, to Polish Scouts, and to
                                prepare any group that asks for their help; the couple also teach a
                                class in a school; segment of the recording made as the Siemaczkos
                                show the fieldworker photographs and costumes; Silesian costume
                                described, Collette Siemaczko is interested in the costumes and also
                                in the music, how costuming has changed since they arrived in
                                Chicago, they used to copy from costumes on display in a museum but
                                this is not a good model because those examples had been prepared
                                for stage plays; three vests they acquired; dance tradition is
                                strong in Chicago, they could see at a parade this year how costumes
                                had improved, more variety and representation of all areas of
                                Poland, whereas earlier Chicago Polish Americans did not know much
                                about regional differences because so many were from the Krakow
                                area, as well as having lived in U.S. a long time and forgotten, a
                                grandmother would remember what she had seen her grandmother wear in
                                Poland and the costume would be reconstructed from this; beginning
                                in about 1959, Polish dance troupes came to Chicago and people
                                understood Konstanty Siemaczko had been telling them and they began
                                to work on costuming, for the first time, Collette is working on a
                                costume from the Krakow region because there are so many from that
                                region in Chicago; most people like the sequins better than beading
                                on the vests but the beading is older and more authentic; Collette
                                shows a vest she acquired at a sale held by Polish veterans that she
                                got cheaply because it was beaded; in the dance groups, the kids
                                wear different costumes, most parents don't care about the
                                regionality of the costumes so long as the children look good; the
                                Siemaczkos take dance students from 3 years of age up, Collette hand
                                makes parts of costumes; discusses costume making and beading, about
                                Polish motifs, i.e. the rose, the poppy, oats; it was once very
                                difficult to get the correct types of fabric but now easier;
                                Collette Siemaczko shows a bolt of fabric that she calls "the
                                genuine thing"; one of the couple's daughters now teaches dancing
                                too; the family works on the "Christmas Around the World Show" at
                                the Museum of Science and Industry that many ethnic groups
                                participate in; working on costumes is a continuous job as kids
                                change size or drop out or are added, and new programs must be
                                prepared for; story told about Konstanty's costume being worn by a
                                member of the Royal Ballet in 1957; Collette also sings and she was
                                in the Polish mass for the Millenium Celebration (celebrating the
                                Christianization of Poland, said to have occurred in 966); mention
                                of the Polish Constitution Day Parade in Chicago (celebrates the
                                1791 ratification of the Polish Constitution); the Siemaczkos have a
                                closet full of costumes, Collette shows another, handmade, from
                                Poland, 50 years old, "the genuine article;" the Siemaczkos have a
                                friend who looks for fabrics and other materials in Poland and found
                                this costume, their older daughter wears it; one trick is to remove
                                beading or embroidery from a worn costume and put it on new example;
                                Collette shows and discusses appliqued beaded parts on a vest;
                                Collette is going to college this fall and will work with folk
                                materials. she has a National College of Education scholarship; the
                                Siemaczkos show some photos of their Christmas production from last
                                year; Collette uses the expression "reproduction" to refer to copies
                                of costumes, not made in Poland; Konstanty describes Christmas
                                traditions and the play done by the Polish Scouts (under the Polish
                                Youth Association), King Herod's speech is adlibbed each year and
                                usually gets a big laugh; the wigilia (traditional Christmas Eve
                                vigil supper) is also part of the production, they do two
                                performances in one day, each one and half hours long, Konstanty
                                directs the dancing; their youngest daughter goes to Walt Disney
                                Magnet School, a multi-ethnic school, and the Siemaczkos volunteered
                                to teach Polish dances there, where Collette is a volunteer; the
                                family practices the Easter basket blessing and have it done at St.
                                Wenceslaus church, which is "supposed to be a Polish parish;" their
                                7-year-old daughter Nina is experienced enough to teach the dances;
                                Konstanty has a large repertoire of dances but never gets to teach
                                them all because each group goes at its own pace. He aims to have
                                students learn at least 6 or 7 and be able to perform 3, his
                                teaching routine starts with exercises adapted from ballet. Part 4
                                of a 5-part interview with Collette and Konstanty (Konstanti)
                                Siemaczko in their home; Konstanty Siemaczko is a well-known
                                choreographer for several Polish American youth dance groups; about
                                how Christmas and the end of the year are their busy times, they
                                were especially busy during the Bicenntennial year and were always
                                asked for dance demonstrations; fieldworker notes an interruption in
                                the tape at this point; about how recent immigration from Poland has
                                helped bring in new interest in Polish dancing, Chicago Polish
                                Americans do want to teach their children; Collette notes how and
                                what is taught affects the children's interest, she wanted her
                                children to know two languages as she did not, she reads Polish but
                                is not confident of her speaking ability, while her children are
                                bilingual; Collette was made member of the Legion of Young Polish
                                Women recently, this is an unusual honor as they only take women of
                                Polish descent (Collette is Irish and Czech); the women in the group
                                take political positions, they once protested the television series
                                on six American families that featured a Polish American stereotype;
                                Collette says she was in a Polish intellectual community in England
                                and also is familiar with the folk arts of Poles, whe cannot
                                understand the stereotype of the dumb Pole; the Legion runs a big
                                debutantes ball where the Polanaise and Mazur dances are performed;
                                a man showed Collette the basics of beading but she is mainly
                                self-taught, she has books with patterns for costumes and designs
                                for the motifs; the Siemaczkos. have a extensive library on folk
                                arts with the emphasis on Polish arts, and friends are always
                                looking for additional books; the woman who lives next door does
                                Polish crocheting and lace, she is from an area of Poland where lace
                                is work, Konstanty describes Polish lace as "baroque;" Collette also
                                makes Easter eggs; she is interested in all folk arts, and she shows
                                the fieldworker some eggs into which she has painted, scratched, or
                                etched designs; Collette took up eggs when she couldn't sleep at
                                night, she gets designs from Easter cards and books; it is customary
                                to trade eggs with friends; the Siemaczko children are all in Polish
                                Scouts and carry on traditions; Collette shows the fieldworker an
                                egg made from yarn, evolved from the making of egg shapes from
                                rushes; about Polish shops along Milwaukee Ave.; Konstanty likes to
                                teach dance to piano music as one can slow down, repeat, etc., he
                                uses a book with 300 steps and positions; Collette shows the
                                fieldworker her amber collection; Konstanty has been back to Poland
                                once in 1968 on a visit, it used to be a problem to travel there but
                                not anymore, while there, he saw some dancing and describes one
                                program, also describes helping a man who wanted to learn dances and
                                then went on to form his own group; Konstanty happy to teach, his
                                purpose is to promote traditions not to hold on to them, he has
                                trained many others who became teachers in turn, his younger son and
                                older daughter teach dancing; the Siemaczkos describe their own
                                Christmas traditions, Collette cooks Polish food, saying that it is
                                like French in many ways; in 1931, when Collette was born, Konstanty
                                was at a Polish Scout jamboree in Prague, he was 12 years old and
                                marching at the end of the line, on the route, he saw many Czech
                                scouts and thought the women were very beautiful so decided that
                                when he wanted to marry, he would return and marry a Czech girl, he
                                did finally marry a Czech girl although "it took a war to do it;" he
                                knew two Czech presidents, one he met in the concentration camp; the
                                couple discuss some of the organizations they belong to and the
                                Polish newspapers they get; they show the fieldworker some
                                embroidery and the axes used in the Polish Highlander dances, a
                                cabinet maker who lives on their street made the handles while

        Recording of performances at the Polonia Grove and Ballroom, 4604
                                South Archer Ave.; the fieldworker's project report states that the
                                park is run by Casey (Casimir) Homel, also a polka bandleader, and
                                that the park caters to families and older couples; this recording

                                performances; the bands include accordions, concertinas, drums, and
                                electric bass; some announcements by a woman (seems to be a live
                                radio broadcast from the park, includes sausage and meat
                                advertisement); mention of the Concertina All-Stars (may have
                                played); one selection was the "Jig Saw Polka"; also a male
                                announcer is heard, and presents a more or less political plug for
                                city authorities.

                                time had little education, no study habits, wanted to group
                                together, and wanted to go on speaking Polish; the spot where
                                Ashland, Milwaukee, and Division Streets meet formed a triangle
                                (there is a Polish expression for this) that was at the heart of
                                Polonia (the name for Chicago's Polish community and their place in
                                the city); there are about five Polish churches in the immediate
                                area; in recent years, the neighborhood has clanged and has been
                                changed by urban renewal and expressways; in the old days the Poles
                                wanted to keep their ways and there was discrimination against them
                                if they went out of the area; Polish Roman Catholic Union and other
                                fraternal organizations were formed to help Polish Americans meet
                                their needs, originally for things like money to bury family
                                members; other organizations like the Polish National Alliance
                                followed; their activities now are quite different; these
                                organizations had cultural activities too, which is how this
                                museum-library-archives complex grew, the library was founded in
                                1912 to give the neighborhood a recreation center and a chance for
                                people to educate themselves, and it featured books in Polish on
                                literature for enjoyment se well as self-help manuals to teach Poles
                                skills; at that time, Polish immigrants hesitated to go to public
                                libraries and most didn't speak English well; this service was the
                                main function of the library for years, but its purpose has changed
                                now, the immigrants who came after WWII are different, they want to
                                learn English and become Americanized; Polish was taught in local
                                schools until about 10 years ago; the Polonia neighborhood grew on a
                                pattern like what was left behind in Poland; the church was the
                                center, built first and then a school started, and social life
                                revolved around these; the first schools taught in Polish; the
                                second generation learned Polish in the schools as a second
                                language, "the whole purpose behind these parochial schools was to
                                retain the spirit and the customs . . . ."; interruption in the
                                recording; the library has a large selection of children's books in
                                Polish and is very proud of it, although they are not used much now;
                                they are in very fragile condition and Bilinski discourages handling
                                them; today, the library is mainly a research facility; they seek to
                                acquire works on Poland in English; the holdings are about 80
                                percent in Polish and few people today can use them: "The third
                                generation doesn't speak Polish"; many non-Poles who don't speak the
                                language also do research in the library; they have 20, 000 volumes;
                                Polish American students do use the library, high school and college
                                age, if they get an assignment about ethnicity or whatever, then
                                they favor their own background, there were many such projects
                                during the Bicentennial; scholars from Poland use the library; here
                                they get the true story unlike in communist Poland where things are
                                slanted; the main, really the only, way that Polish is taught today
                                is in the Saturday schools; there are 700 classes (or schools ?) in
                                Chicago but since only meet once a week, they can't teach much
                                language; for the most part, they introduce students to the culture
                                and customs of Poland; the library doesn't work with the Saturday
                                schools; Polish American young people in public schools may start a
                                Polish club, there are several in colleges in area, e.g, one at the
                                University of Illinois at Chicago Circle campus and one at Lane
                                Tech; the Museum will cooperate with these if they ask for a
                                display; the library is non-circulating except for fiction and
                                literature, on for these categories, they lose many volumes; one
                                goal is to acquire more music books, partly to put in the Paderewski
                                room of the museum; the library collection had been cataloged up to
                                1950; then for about 20 years nothing was done to catalog
                                acquisitions; recently they have been working on cataloging new
                                acquisitions, now using Dewey Decimal system (the library had its
                                own system through 1950), all books need to be re-cataloged. Part 2
                                of a 4-part interview with Franciscan Father Donald Bilinski,
                                curator of the library at the Polish Museum of America, 984 N
                                Milwaukee Ave.; no detailed summary of this part of the recording
                                exists. Part 3 of a 4-part interview with Franciscan Father Donald
                                Bilinski, curator of the library at the Polish Museum of America,
                                984 N Milwaukee Ave.; how lack of space is a big problem for the
                                library; discusses periodicals, with a focus on American titles,
                                they have 22 but none are complete runs; they are working to
                                organize their prints, there is much demand for these from the
                                press, artwork and photos, this serves the non-Polish community;
                                many Chicago Polish Americans are not aware of the museum; there is
                                not enough publicity; they were given a big batch of stuff from a
                                world's fair held in New York before WWII, and they were swamped,
                                able only to concentrate on housing and preserving it, not putting
                                it in order; this happened in about 1941; now some of the materials
                                that were in that fair are being claimed by people who lent them,
                                they want money for them, this has resulted in many court cases for
                                the museum; the library does have control of their clippings files,
                                this is work done by volunteers; the museum hours are form 1-4, and
                                they have a good guide (docent) Monday through Friday but the guide
                                for the weekends does not have good command of English; the museum
                                includes an art gallery with 400 original pieces, done by Poles and
                                Polish Americans; they acquire works on Polish subjects or by Polish
                                artists, if they get something else, they trade it for if they can;
                                the museum's gallery is not for Polish American artists since there
                                is a Polish Arts Club in Chicago that concentrates on this category;
                                the museum and library has a [fund-raising] affair once a year, in
                                different places, the event used to be at the gallery but many in
                                their public do not like to come to this neighborhood in the evening
                                anymore; the library is only open on one evening a week, Monday;
                                since the museum does not sell paintings, Polish American artists
                                are not so interested in showing there; they have 30 pieces from the
                                Warsaw museum that came with the World's Fair lot, all classical;
                                Father Bilinski prefers this to modern art; he was trained as an
                                archivist but didn't use the training for a long time; he grew up in
                                Chicago, though was not born here; he came to the museum 5-6 years
                                ago, at that time, no one was doing much, the original director, Mr.
                                Heiman, died in 1949 and things were left in the hands of a man who
                                preferred other activities; he arranged for cultural events like
                                concerts and the Polish dance troupes, in order to raise money, and
                                tended to let the museum and archives go; they are currently
                                publishing letters written by Kosciusko during the American
                                Revolution; the museum is now supported by members; there is a four
                                year old ladies auxiliary that runs the gift shop and an annual
                                fund-raising affair, a dinner and theater party; the auxiliary also
                                helps out when there is a temporary show in the gallery; they have
                                had one man shows by various artists, e.g., the exhibit "Poles in
                                Detroit," a display of Polish medals and medallions from Krakow, an
                                exhibition of work by an artist named Zabrowski (Leszek Zebrowski ?)
                                who did sketches of Polish scenes in America; one miniature painter,
                                a woman who worked in flaming wax; each artist must leave a piece
                                behind in exchange for the opportunity to show works in the gallery,
                                this gives them a chance to be seen as most are unknown; in
                                addition, the museum hosted a Smithsonian traveling exhibit on folk
                                art, and invited artists to display and demonstrate reverse glass
                                painting and wicynanki (paper cutting), these weren't from the
                                Chicago area, the museum does not feature local artists but do
                                feature work from Poland or other parts of the U.S.; the woman who
                                did the wicynanki is from Connecticut, keeping up the tradition by
                                publishing books on this, her books are sold in the gift shop;
                                interruption in the recording; Bilinski shows books on crafts which
                                are very popular, people use them or buy from gift shop, the shop is
                                a convenience for people, a place where they can find such books,
                                more of a service than a money maker; the museum had 7,000 visitors
                                last year, tour groups come, especially consisting of senior
                                citizens; there are five areas in the museum complex, the main hall
                                is what was once a social hall, with an auditorium and stage, the
                                choir loft is now used as the art gallery; there are two
                                biographical rooms, the Kosciusko and the Paderewski, which are
                                museum rooms; Mr. Heiman had been a friend of Paderewski so they
                                have much memorabilia connected to him; interruption in the
                                recording; discussion of books that sell. Part 4 of a 4-part
                                interview with Franciscan Father Donald Bili?ski, curator of the
                                library at the Polish Museum of America, 984 N Milwaukee Ave.; this
                                part contains a fragment of sentence, duration less than one
                                minute.

        Part 1 of a 3-part interview with sister and brother Jania Sajewski
                                (Jeanette Sajewski Terley or Jeannette Sajewski Terlikowski) and
                                Alvin Sajewski in their music store, 1227 Milwaukee Ave; topics
                                include earlier version's of the family's store in Chicago, the
                                current iteration is the sixth; the basement has special features to
                                control dampness; their family includes 3 girls and 5 boys, father
                                died in 1948; about the demolition of one store because of urban
                                renewal; in youth, Alvin Sajewski spent the most time in the store
                                with his father, learned the business; Polish was spoken at home,
                                there was pride in being Polish; Jeannette explains that her
                                husband's name Terlikowski was shortened to Terley for ease in
                                spelling; Poles and Polish Americans always stopped at Sajewski
                                store, "if we didn't stay here no one could find us"; musical
                                trends, earlier favored accordions and concertinas, today guitars;
                                Alvin grew up with the record business; we give credit to buyers;
                                about how proud ethnic Americans were to own a phonograph; in 1914,
                                Columbia started recording polkas and waltzes, how the Sajewskis
                                suggested to the big companies that they start recording what people
                                wanted, which the Sajewskis knew about; Alvin's first chore in the
                                store had been to wind up the photographs and play records for
                                customers, his older brother taught him to tantalize customers by
                                only playing part of the record, this task made Alvin very aware of
                                customers' tastes, psychology of selling, play a few good ones, a
                                few bad ones; joke about Halley's comet, at about the time of the
                                passing in 1910. Part 2 of a 3-part interview with sister and
                                brother Jania Sajewski (Jeanette Sajewski Terley or Jeannette
                                Sajewski Terlikowski) and Alvin Sajewski in their music store, 1227
                                Milwaukee Ave; the recorded level (volume) on this part is too low
                                to hear.

        Part 1-6 of a 6-part interview together with performances of song,
                                primarily in Lithuanian, with and by 90-year-old Paulina Barauskas
                                (Barauskiene), recorded at her home 732 W, 19th St.; the
                                fieldworker's notes describe Mrs. Barauskas as a long-time resident
                                of the Bridgeport neighborhood, although this address is in the
                                Lower West Side, just north of Bridgeport; Mrs. Barauskas's daughter
                                is present for part of the interview; during the six parts of this
                                series, Mrs. Barauskas sings old Lithuanian folk songs, reminisces
                                about community activities among the Lithuanian immigrants who came
                                to Chicago before World War I, and especially about drama clubs; the
                                fieldworker's notes leaves some confusion about sequence and
                                recording dates; parts 5 and 6 may have been the first recorded on 7
                                June 1977, with parts 1 through 4 recorded on 9 June 1977.

                                and Bronislava Variakojis, recorded at their home at 6919 South
                                California, adjacent to Marquette Park; he is a woodcarver and model
                                maker, including the creation of miniature models of Lithuanian
                                farmsteads; she is a fabric artist, whose work includes embroidering
                                textiles with Lithuanian folk motifs; the basement of their home is
                                a personal museum in which they display their work; part 1 is with

                                patterns and the development of her interest in the craft, some
                                patterns were drawn by her husband, she makes place mats, "only in
                                America," for a craft fair (Kazuiko Muge, English Kaziukas fair),

                                patterns; Bronislava Variakojis's aesthetic has changed, new
                                appreciation for folk patterns, "they are uniquely our own"; about
                                Girl Scouts and their interest in crafts, they seem to prefer
                                non-Lithuanian expression, e.g., clowndolls; in general most craft

                                about DP (Displaced Persons) camps, then to the U.S. via New
                                Orleans, met by nuns and an orchestra; first impressions of America,
                                dirty, depressing; in Chicago, Marquette Park seemed rural; husband
                                Vilius Variakojis got a job with [Behardt's ?] construction, carried
                                bricks, exploited as a DP, no overtime, cheated, later got a job at
                                the Campbell Soup Co., Bronislava Variakojis worked in a shoe
                                factory, paid as piece work, low pay; "without the language, what
                                can you do"; she also taught piano to Lithuanian children in
                                Bridgeport, about 50 students over time; "I was always shy and
                                afraid to look for other jobs"; retired in the 1960s; recap Vilius

                                mechanic, maintenance man at Wilson's; about Vilius Variakojis's
                                woodcarving, symbolic value of folk art, if everyone had remained in
                                Lithuania, the same appreciation would not have developed; lack of
                                interest in these crafts among young people, adults ready to pass on
                                to apprentices but few come forward; Bronislava Variakojis notes
                                that some recent publications from Lithuania offer images of
                                excellent textile patterns; at this point, Vilius Variakojis arrives
                                and joins the conversation; he talks about carving in Lithuania,
                                decorated rakes, given to girls; he learned how to make carved
                                wooden chains from his grandfather;, in Lithuanial, he lived in an
                                old homestead with linden and oak trees, but has heard from
                                relatives recently who report that where the lindens grew, now only
                                wheatfields sway and pigs graze; Vilius Variakojis wrote down his
                                family history as dictated by his illiterate grandfather; comments
                                on the family surname, surgery, copper (varis) pin in foot gave rise
                                to the name of a veteran ancestor; his grandfather fought in the
                                czar's army in the Russo-Japanese War; Vilius Variakojis has some
                                knowledge of Latvian, Russian, Ukrainian, German, and Polish; he
                                knew no English when he came to the U.S., learned numbers by
                                listening to the bus driver call out street names; studied English
                                at night at Englewood High School for 3 years, prepared him to pass
                                his U.S. citizenship test; he has been called Willie, Bill, and
                                William in English. Part 3 of a 4-part interview in Lithuanian with
                                Mr. and Mrs. Vilius and Bronislava Variakojis, recorded at their
                                home at 6919 South California, adjacent to Marquette Park; he is a
                                woodcarver and model maker, including the creation of miniature
                                models of Lithuanian farmsteads; she is a fabric artist, whose work
                                includes embroidering textiles with Lithuanian folk motifs; the
                                basement of their home is a personal museum in which they display
                                their work; topics include discussion of Vilius and Variakojis's
                                models of Lithuanian building and farmsteads, says "I make them for
                                young people, to show them what the Lithuanian countryside looked
                                like"; scouts in Lithuania are different from those in the U.S.,
                                there, they rough camped, hiked, unlike the pampered scouts in the
                                U.S.; U.S. scouts do woodcraft and textiles, not done in Lithuania;
                                carving wooden chain links came from his grandfather; when Vilius
                                Variakojis got to Germany as a DP (Displaced Person) there was no
                                time to carve, he has taken this up in his retirement, there is
                                nothing else to do, he does not drink and does not got to taverns,
                                his wife wants him to stay out of the kitchen; discusses trees, the
                                Paradise Tree, the Golden Apple tree, had thought this a folktale
                                but recently learned it is known in Greek mythology; then discussion
                                of carved wooden objects; towel racks, in the museum, made in
                                Lithuania by others, may hang near doorways with water, may be used
                                for decoration; black trees, priest's hell, motif related to tar
                                kettles in hell; world tree with stars; about other items, something
                                with form of a cube, spoons, utensils, he is looking for horns the
                                convert into drinking horns; Vilius Variakojis discusses why he does
                                this craftwork, "I want to leave something behind"; he has written a
                                will, to bring things back to Lithuania, he hopes "free" Lithuania,
                                no longer oppressed; about the Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture
                                in Chicago but Vilius Variakojis demurs, it is too possessive, wants
                                to donate in a way that gives to all Lithuanians; discussion of
                                exhibiting his work, one attempt had not worked, hence the museum in
                                his home; some of his farmstead models were made from memory, some
                                from photographs; grandchildren do not show any special
                                appreciation; additional comments on Balzekas museum, includes some
                                inauthentic items; about windmills, very prominent in Lithuania'a
                                Birzai region; Vilius Variakojis plans to do some writing later,
                                after his hands can no longer work wood; about Lithuanian coins,
                                books; about assembling his museum, what might its future be;
                                comment about real estate taxes, their house has higher tax because
                                across the street from Marquette Park. Part 4 of a 4-part interview
                                in Lithuanian with Mr. and Mrs. Vilius and Bronislava Variakojis,
                                recorded at their home at 6919 South California, adjacent to

                                Lithuanian folk motifs; the basement of their home is a personal
                                museum in which they display their work; topics include comment by
                                fieldworker Jonas Dovydenas, offering a black walnut carving for the
                                museum; Vilius Variakojis discusses carving of Christ in a boat with
                                the apostles, he is interested in both themes, those that relate to
                                hell and the devil and those that feature positive aspects of
                                relgion; comment, "Sun and beauty, one cannot hide"; about how he
                                remembers tales told by his father and grandfather, both are
                                Protestants; his wife belongs to another Lithuanian Protestant
                                denomination; Protestantism in Lithuania goes back to the

         Film negative frame numbers, descriptions: 2-13, first large
                                    chapel pole made by Antanas Poskocimas, commissioned by the
                                    owner of the house, Dr. Jonas Adomavicius, at 55th and S.
                                    Claremont; the house also has a gabled doorway extension, a very
                                    common characteristic of Lithuanian folk architecture; folk
                                    design is also represented by the carved fence that surrounds
                                    the property; Dr. Adomavicius clearly wished to have the house
                                    look like a typical Lithuanian home; to enhance the effect he
                                    planted birch trees, typical of the Lithuanian countryside; even
                                    the birdhouse is typically Lithuanian; 14-18, Lithuanian co-op
                                    apartment complex at 66th and So. Carolina. for senior citizens
                                    cared for by Dr. Jonas Adomavicius who also administers the
                                    housing complex, which is called "Sodyba" meaning homestead;
                                    articles about the residents and their photographs appear
                                    regularly in the Lithuanian press; on Sunday afternoon they have
                                    an open house in a large gathering room and the residents
                                    perform for guests; the chapel pole in the middle of the complex
                                    is made from metal and was designed by architect Jonas Mulokas,
                                    who also designed the Lithuanian parish church, Nativity of the
                                    Blessed Virgin Mary on Washtenaw and 69th Streets; the rounded
                                    flower bed seen here is quite common in traditional Lithuanian
                                    landscaping; note birdhouse in frame 14; frames 19-36, examples

                                    Adomavicius, 55th and S. Claremont, a chapel pole, bird house,
                                    carved fence and birch trees, all are typical elements to be
                                    found in or near homes in Lithuania; 9-20, Close-up of chapel
                                    pole. The chapel pole was the first large example made by
                                    Antanas Poskocimas, commissioned by Dr. Jonas Adomavicius. The
                                    house also has a gabled doorway extension, a very common
                                    characteristic of Lithuanian folk architecture. The same applies
                                    to the carved fence which surrounds the property. Dr.
                                    Adomavicius clearly wished to have the house look like a typical
                                    Lithuanian home in Lithuania. To enhance the effect he planted
                                    birch trees, typical of the Lithuanian countryside. Even the
                                    birdhouse is typically Lithuanian.

                                    Lithuanian American co-op apartment complex for senior citizens
                                    at 66th and S. Carolina, flanked by American and Lithuanian
                                    flags; the senior citizens who live there are cared for by Dr.
                                    Jonas Adomavicius who also administers the housing complex; the
                                    place is called "Sodyba" meaning homestead, and articles about
                                    the residents and their photographs appear regularly in the
                                    Lithuanian American press; on Sunday afternoon they have an open
                                    house in a large gathering room and the residents perform for
                                    guests; the chapel pole in the middle of the complex is made
                                    from metal and was designed by architect Jonas Mulokas, who also
                                    designed the Lithuanian parish church (Nativity of Blessed
                                    Virgin Mary on Washtenaw and 69th Streets); the rounded flower
                                    bed is quite common in traditional Lithuanian landscaping.

         Film negative frame numbers, descriptions: 2-13, first large
                                    chapel pole made by Antanas Poskocimas, commissioned by the
                                    owner of the house, Dr. Jonas Adomavicius, at 55th and S.
                                    Claremont; the house also has a gabled doorway extension, a very
                                    common characteristic of Lithuanian folk architecture; folk
                                    design is also represented by the carved fence that surrounds
                                    the property; Dr. Adomavicius clearly wished to have the house
                                    look like a typical Lithuanian home; to enhance the effect he
                                    planted birch trees, typical of the Lithuanian countryside; even
                                    the birdhouse is typically Lithuanian; 14-18, Lithuanian co-op
                                    apartment complex at 66th and So. Carolina. for senior citizens
                                    cared for by Dr. Jonas Adomavicius who also administers the
                                    housing complex, which is called "Sodyba" meaning homestead;
                                    articles about the residents and their photographs appear
                                    regularly in the Lithuanian press; on Sunday afternoon they have
                                    an open house in a large gathering room and the residents
                                    perform for guests; the chapel pole in the middle of the complex
                                    is made from metal and was designed by architect Jonas Mulokas,
                                    who also designed the Lithuanian parish church, Nativity of the
                                    Blessed Virgin Mary on Washtenaw and 69th Streets; the rounded
                                    flower bed seen here is quite common in traditional Lithuanian
                                    landscaping; note birdhouse in frame 14; frames 19-36, examples

                                    church of Kraziai in Lithuania in 1893 when Russian soldiers
                                    raided the village and slaughtered a great number of villagers

                                    chapel pole made by Antanas Poskocimas, commissioned by the
                                    owner of the house, Dr. Jonas Adomavicius, at 55th and S.
                                    Claremont; the house also has a gabled doorway extension, a very
                                    common characteristic of Lithuanian folk architecture; folk
                                    design is also represented by the carved fence that surrounds
                                    the property; Dr. Adomavicius clearly wished to have the house
                                    look like a typical Lithuanian home; to enhance the effect he
                                    planted birch trees, typical of the Lithuanian countryside; even
                                    the birdhouse is typically Lithuanian; 14-18, Lithuanian co-op

                                    cared for by Dr. Jonas Adomavicius who also administers the
                                    housing complex, which is called "Sodyba" meaning homestead;
                                    articles about the residents and their photographs appear
                                    regularly in the Lithuanian press; on Sunday afternoon they have
                                    an open house in a large gathering room and the residents
                                    perform for guests; the chapel pole in the middle of the complex
                                    is made from metal and was designed by architect Jonas Mulokas,
                                    who also designed the Lithuanian parish church, Nativity of the
                                    Blessed Virgin Mary on Washtenaw and 69th Streets; the rounded
                                    flower bed seen here is quite common in traditional Lithuanian
                                    landscaping; note birdhouse in frame 14; frames 19-36, examples
