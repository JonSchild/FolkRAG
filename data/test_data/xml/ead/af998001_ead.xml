    Twenty autograph albums, dated from 1843 through 1923, represent the
		  German-American and Anglo-American autograph album tradition. Duncan Emrich,
		  head of the Archive of Folk Song, appeared on the "NBC Weekend" radio program
		  and apparently asked interested listeners to send such materials to the
		  Library. In response to his radio talk, the albums, mostly from Iowa, arrived
		  at the Archive between 1955 and 1956. Examination of the Music Division
		  administrative files might lead to further information on the original owners,
		  donors, and the history of these albums.

    Scope and Content Note
   </head>
   <p>
    The collection consists of twenty autograph albums and ephemera from
		  the states of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, and New York dating
		  from 1843 through 1923, collected by Duncan Emrich, head of the Archive of Folk
		  Song, 1945-1956. Emrich's collection is comprised of eight albums from the
		  Habel, Steinmetz, Hale, and Wehls families, donated by Mrs. Orville B. Craig of
		  Independence, Iowa, in 1955; three albums apparently donated by Neva Ruth Dye
		  of Independence, Iowa, in 1956; plus seven albums, one set of loose pages from
		  an album, and one greeting card, donated by various individuals.
   </p>
   <p>
    The collection represents German-American and Anglo-American autograph
		  album customs. Autograph albums are thought to have become a tradition among
		  German students in the fifteenth century. The tradition came to the United
		  States about 1820 and changed as it was adopted by American album-writers
		  (McNeil, 1968).
   </p>
   <p>
    These albums, the earliest from 1843, provide examples of variations
		  of the tradition as it emerged. Several albums kept as a student pastime
		  (college men and women and school boys and girls) are found in this collection.
		  Another album custom of the time was for women of marriageable age to keep
		  "friendship books" to collect signatures and verses from suitors and advice
		  (often on marriage) from visitors, friends, and relatives (Randolph and McCord,
		  1948). Many women continued adding to their albums after marriage. Several
		  albums in this collection provide examples of this version of the tradition.
		  Sometimes the same album contains examples of both the student and the
		  pre-marriage tradition. The verse used in American autograph albums of this
		  period varied from serious to light-hearted and humorous texts (Stern, 1973).
		  The albums may include verses of somber advice from their elders alongside
		  light-hearted verses from friends. The inscriptions include simple signatures,
		  poetry, sayings, personal messages, quotations, calligraphy, and drawings. The
		  language of the inscriptions is predominantly in English, with few in German or
		  Greek.
   </p>
   <p>
    Little information accompanies these albums. Sometimes the name of the
		  original owner can be determined from the album, but in some cases only the
		  first name is evident. Entries are often dated, so the period the album was in
		  use can usually be determined. Donors did not always provide information about
		  the original owner or the history of the album.
   </p>
   <p>
    The albums are grouped by the principal donors, then arranged
		  chronologically by the date of the first inscription. Mrs. Craig's donation of
		  eight albums is followed by Mrs. Nye's donation of three albums. These are
		  followed by the individually donated albums, album pages, and the greeting
		  card, all arranged chronologically.
   </p>
   <p>
    Further research might be done on this collection. Examination of the
		  Music Division files might lead to further correspondence related to the albums
		  under donor's names. The radio script was not found among the Duncan Emrich
		  papers held by the Archive.

      SERIES III: DONATIONS OF MRS. DYE

     <p>
      The following three albums were apparently donated by Neva Ruth
				Dye (Mrs. L. M. Dye) of Independence, Iowa. In a letter found with the
				collection, Mrs. Dye says she is donating "these albums" (more than one), but
				no albums are marked as having been donated by her. All the other albums, with
				the exception of the loose album pages, either have known donors or were marked
				as having been donated anonymously. So, it is likely that these three unmarked
				albums, all German-American and all with entries from Independence, Iowa, were
				donated by Mrs. Dye.
     </p>
    </odd>
    <scopecontent>
     <p>
      These albums are from the same location and period as the albums
				donated by Mrs. Craig and have many signatures in common with them.
