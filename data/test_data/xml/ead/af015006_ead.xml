   <abstract encodinganalog="520$a" label="Summary">
    An ethnographic field collection of
            manuscript materials, graphic images, sound recordings, and moving images that document,
            for the most part, Romanian folk dance and music as well as costume, ritual, and
            customs. Music arrangements, choreographic diagrams, photographs, and programs document
            activities of the state dance companies, the Cioc√Ærlia and Perinitza Ensembles. Oral
            history interviews with the donor recorded in 1995 complement the materials. Manuscript
            material includes music arrangements, music transcriptions, dance notation, field notes,
            choreographic diagrams, ethnographies, dance indexes, analyses of meter and rhythm, and
            maps of dance distribution. Collection includes more than 2,000 notated folk dance
            variants, more than 3,200 audio-recorded melodies and approximately 4,000 notated dance
            melodies. The dance notation in this collection is a unique form developed by Gheorghe
            Popescu-Judetz to record Romanian folk dance.

   <p>
    After the initial donation in 1990, the collection materials went largely unprocessed
               until 1995. From 1995 to 1996, Michelle Forner processed both the 1990 and 1995
               donations, and also conducted an oral history interview with Eugenia Popescu-Judetz.
               In 1997, a third batch of materials was donated by Eugenia Popescu-Judetz to
               accompany those belonging to Series I. These items were processed in 1998 by Steven
               Pape and were labeled as Series III. Series IV materials were processed by Kate
               Stewart.

    Biographical Notes
   </head>
   <p>
    Gheorghe Popescu-Judetz (1911-1972) was born in the village of Beleti-Negre≈üti, Muscel
            district, in the Muntenia region of Romania. He became interested in traditional folk
            dancing as a teenager and began performing as principal dancer with amateur ensembles in
            Bucharest. He obtained degrees from several universities and entered the teaching
            profession. In the 1930s and 1940s, he was leader of and dancer with a number of
            organizations, including Asocia≈£ia Alunelul, the Dance Group of Liga CulturalƒÉ
            Association, and the soldier dancers from the 30th Dorobantzi Army Unit. Gheorghe toured
            with some of these groups nationally and abroad. From 1949 to 1966, he was the
            choreographer and director of the Cioc√Ærlia Ensemble dance group and made a number of
            foreign tours with them. Throughout the years, he also served as a guest choreographer
            for other dance groups, as a professor of folk dance at various schools and seminars,
            and as a jury member at national folk arts competitions. In 1948 he married Eugenia
            Marisescu, who became his dance partner and research associate. In 1950 they won first
            prize in the International Folk Dance Competition in Prague for excellence in character
            dance performance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Early in his career, Gheorghe became fascinated with his country's abundance of
            traditional folk dances. Consequently, he dedicated his life to compiling a complete
            catalog and ethnographic description of all Romanian dances and variations. With no
            formal ethnographic training, he nonetheless conducted extensive fieldwork throughout
            Romania between 1949 and 1972, often accompanied by a music transcriber, costume
            designer, ensemble dancers, and Eugenia. He published some of his research in ten books
            on folk dance (see "Related Publications") as well as in many journal and magazine
            articles. Gheorghe received numerous artistic awards throughout his life and was honored
            in 1957 with the title ‚ÄúArtist Emeritus of Romania‚Äù for his work in the field of folk
            dance.

   <p>
    Eugenia Popescu-Judetz (1925-2011) was born in Giurgiu, a town on the Danube river in
            the Muntenia region of Romania. Although she trained in classical ballet as a child,
            Eugenia always had an interest in traditional folk dance, which increased after she
            married. In her early career, she was a professional dancer and folk dance teacher with
            the National Theatre Ballet of Bucharest. She also performed with the Opera Theater and
            taught dance in the High School of the Arts and in the Folk Ensemble of Bucharest. For a
            time she conducted research with the Romanian Folk Lore Institute, which gave her
            valuable training for future fieldwork. From 1954 to 1970, she was ballet master and
            choreographer of the Perinitza Folk Ensemble and toured internationally with them.
            Throughout these years, she taught workshops for folk dance instructors and amateur
            choreographers, created many choreographies for film and television, conducted field
            research, and lectured in Europe.
   </p>
   <p>
    As part of a cultural exchange program, Eugenia traveled to the United States in the
            late 1960s to teach Romanian folk dance workshops. In 1973, she returned to the United
            States on an invitation from the Duquesne University Tamburitzans in Pittsburgh, PA. She
            became an adjunct professor at Duquesne and continued to teach and choreograph for the
            Tamburitzans. Eugenia received a master of arts degree in theology from Duquesne
            University and a doctorate in theatre criticism from the University of Pittsburgh.

    Scope and Content
   </head>
   <p>
    Materials in the Gheorghe and Eugenia Popescu-Judetz Collection span the years 1938 to
            1974 and 1995, with the largest portion dating from 1950 to 1972. The collection is
            arranged into two major groups or series, with a third series which serves as donated
            supplementary material. Series I, the bulk of the collection, consists of the
            documentary materials donated by Eugenia Popescu-Judetz in 1990 and 1995, and includes
            manuscripts, sound recordings, graphic materials, and moving images. Series II consists
            of material about the collection, primarily generated by the American Folklife Center at
            the Library of Congress, such as manuscript material, sound recordings, graphic
            materials, and moving images. Series III contains additional manuscripts, photographs,
            and ephemera that were donated by Eugenia Popescu-Judetz in 1997.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Popescu-Judetzes were Romanian dancers who worked primarily as choreographers and
            teachers. Series I contains the accumulation of decades of Gheorghe's notes, research,
            and choreographic work as well as examples of Eugenia's dance work and research. It
            includes at least several thousand notated folk dance variants, more than 3,200
            audio-recorded melodies, and approximately 4,000 notated dance melodies. The bulk of the
            recordings resulted from fieldwork Gheorghe and his team conducted to collect Romanian
            folk dance and music in all regions of the country. Gheorghe and Eugenia used these
            materials primarily to create choreographic works for their government-sponsored
            performance ensembles. They were also used to develop curricula for dance workshops; to
            publish dance instruction books, to provide methods to teach Romanian character dance,
            and to record an endangered traditional dance culture. In addition to documenting both
            traditional Romanian folk dance, and the work of the Cioc√Ærlia and Perinitza Ensembles,
            this collection also includes theoretical research, ethnographic descriptions, and a
            unique dance notation system developed by the Popescu-Judetzs.
   </p>
   <p>
    All the fieldwork materials are interrelated, though these relationships are not always
            readily apparent. For example, for each dance variant notated, there probably exists a
            music of transcription for the accompanying dance tune. There also may be a sound
            recording of the dance tune or descriptive notes about it in the field notebooks.
            Furthermore, the dance is probably described on an index card or found on a list created
            by the Popescu-Judetzs. Although the majority of the dance tunes and dance variants are
            inventoried, no concordance exists that links them together.
   </p>
   <p>
    The breadth of materials in this collection demonstrates a progression of scholarly
            research and performance development and provides insight into dance research and
            performance in communist Romania. The manuscript materials range from rough field notes
            describing folk dance variants in various villages to colored diagrams of choreographic
            works staged for professional performance. Since the dance notations included progress
            from early field sketches to publication-ready drawings of fully-notated dances, the
            development of the dance notation system itself is also documented.
   </p>
   <p>
    Series I
   </p>
   <p>
    The original collection was donated to the Library of Congress first in 1990, with later
            donations in 1995 and 2002, in batches that included parts of each subseries of
            material. Hence, one shipment might contain some music arrangements and notebooks, while
            another shipment included the rest of the arrangements and notebooks. The inventories
            for the sound recordings and manuscript materials (such as the dance and music
            notations) were prepared by Eugenia Popescu-Judetz to accompany each shipment. Since she
            was able to spend more time on the initial inventories (which included written
            introductions), the first parts of these documents are more detailed than later
            addendums.
   </p>
   <p>
    The field transcriptions of music in this collection are contained in notebooks and on
            pages of sheet music. The 113 music notebooks are bound, paper volumes that contain
            holographic scores and sketches of more than 3,000 Romanian dance tunes and songs
            transcribed in the field between 1949 and 1972. The 40 sets of sheet music (referred to
            by the donor as "music sheets") are bound and unbound sets of pages that contain more
            than 250 melodies transcribed between 1950 and 1970. The notebooks and music sheets were
            used to document songs performed on request in the villages and during on-going events
            such as festivals. They record the work of the fieldwork team's music transcriber,
            usually Grigore Suchici (fiddler) but also Constantin Arvinte (composer/music arranger
            for the Cioc√Ærlia Ensemble). The transcriber notated the melody played with the dance
            under study, either on the spot or later by listening to a field recording. Each book
            and music sheet set contains a number of melodies. Later, under Gheorghe
            Popescu-Judetz's direction, Arvinte and others used these materials to write
            arrangements and scores for their ensemble stage performances. In fact, many pages
            contain notes and references that were added later by Gheorghe.
   </p>
   <p>
    The 50 musical arrangements in the collection represent compositions that were prepared
            for performing purposes. They consist of harmonizations, scores, and compositions
            created by various composers for dance performances of the Cioc√Ærlia and Perinitza
            Ensembles, primarily based on fieldwork conducted by the Popescu-Judetzes. Some of the
            arrangements were used for rehearsals and to teach Romanian folk dances and suites to
            other dance ensembles.
   </p>
   <p>
    The notation that documents the Romanian folk dance in this collection is found in the
            field notebooks and notation files. Gheorghe created this unique system of notation out
            of his need to record the dances in the field accurately and quickly, at villages,
            festivals, and competitions. From 1949 to 1955, Gheorghe worked on a system that focused
            on footwork, including the positions and movements of the passive (non-weight-bearing)
            foot. The system could be used to make quick notes in the field or notate complete
            dances. Gheorghe refined the system and used it in his choreography work for the
            ensemble, published books, and teaching. Eugenia also used the notation for the same
            purposes and continued to draw on it when teaching and choreographing Romanian folk
            dance in the United States. After further developing the system, she published Judetz
            Folk Dance Notation in 1979 (see folder 32).
   </p>
   <p>
    Gheorghe Popescu-Judetz's 46 field notebooks are rich in dance notation and other
            information. He used the notebooks, which date between 1950 and 1970, to document his
            dance research and professional activities. They serve as the primary source of field
            documentation and provide an insight into his life and creative process. Arranged in
            random order (some volumes contain multiple years), the notebooks contain a variety of
            information such as names and addresses of informants; quick sketches of dance notation
            accompanied by written descriptions; notes from his participation on dance competition
            juries; notes describing performance groups and dances at folk festivals; sketches of
            costumes, textile patterns, and motifs; and descriptions of informants documented in
            photographs. The notebooks also contain information relating to professional ensemble
            activities, such as dance rehearsal schedules, casting lists, and production notes.
   </p>
   <p>
    The 33 dance notation "files" (the donor's groupings) contain hundreds of leaves
            primarily of notation and written descriptions of at least several thousand Romanian
            folk dance variants, from rough drafts to final forms. They were created by Gheorghe
            Popescu-Judetz between 1949 and 1972, either in the field or transcribed later, and
            include camera-ready versions prepared by a cartographer for publication. The dances are
            grouped mainly by region, and represent field work choreographed for the stage. Of
            special note are seven files of calu≈ü dance variants, and the staging diagrams for
            choreographic works Gheorghe created for performing ensembles, predominantly
            Cioc√Ærlia.
   </p>
   <p>
    The dance notation files include materials other than notation. "Nunta la Bele≈£i," a
            26-page, handwritten manuscript, describes a wedding ritual in Bele≈£i village
            (Gheorghe's birthplace), Muscel district, as it was performed between 1900 and 1940.
            Gheorghe formally researched this event between 1960 and 1964. The ethnographic
            documentation includes descriptions of the participants, costuming, orations, dance,
            music lyrics, and explanations of the rituals involved. "Mic Dictionar al Jocurilor
            Populare din Zonele Folclorice Neamt si Bacau" (trans., Small Dictionary of Folk Dances
            from Neamt in Bacau District) is a 421-page handwritten manuscript. Gheorghe wrote it as
            part of a larger ethnographic work on the folk arts of the Bicaz-Neamt area, Moldavia,
            that was never published. Drawn from his 17 years of research, it contains an
            alphabetically-arranged description of almost 800 dance variants from the area,
            including type of dance, posture, place, dance name synonyms, accompanying lyrics or
            chants, etc. The collection also includes graphs, maps, and indexes intended to
            accompany these dance variants. The last nine files in the series are devoted to
            Gheorghe's work on the metric and rhythmic analysis of Romanian traditional dance. He
            theorized that the roots of Romanian dance rhythms share a common origin with classical
            Greek poetic meters. The files contain classifications of dance rhythms; taxonomic,
            rhythmic, and metric diagrams; and specific dance examples.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of Gheorghe Popescu-Judetz's goals was to make a general catalog of all Romanian
            folk dances and their variants. To that end, with Eugenia's assistance, he drew on the
            research described above to compile iterations of lists of dances on index cards and
            paper sheets. Dances listed individually on index cards often include descriptive
            information. At least 4,000 dances are listed. Some of this material appeared in the
            glossaries and indexes of his published books.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sound recordings in Series I were made in the field by Gheorghe and Eugenia
            Popescu-Judetz between 1950 and 1972. They contain more than 3,200 melodies of Romanian,
            Turkish, and East Indian folk and traditional music, with some informant interviews. The
            bulk of the recordings are Romanian dance tunes, songs, and ballads performed by folk
            musicians, singers, and ensembles from all regions of Romania and Yugoslavian Banat. The
            collection also includes recordings made by Eugenia of Turkish folk music in Dobrudja,
            Dervish ceremonies in Anatolia, and samples of folk and classical music in India.
   </p>
   <p>
    The 118 graphic images in this series are primarily black-and-white photo prints of
            various sizes and include some collages made of photo prints, drawings, postcards, and
            text. They are arranged in five groups: fieldwork, Gheorghe Popescu-Judetz and the
            Cioc√Ærlia Ensemble, portraits of the Popescu-Judetzes, sketches of the Doiul dance from
            Banat, and Eugenia Popescu-Judetz. The images span the years 1938 to 1974, with the bulk
            dating between 1950 and 1970. The collage pages, created by Gheorghe, were taken from
            scrapbooks he kept to document fieldwork projects, dance competitions, and world dance
            tours.
   </p>
   <p>
    The moving images in the collection consist of three short, silent, black-and-white
            films (two 8 mm and one 16 mm). They provide a glimpse of several dance styles and
            costuming as well as views of the Romanian countryside.
   </p>
   <p>
    Series II
   </p>
   <p>
    Series II consists of materials about the collection generated by the Library of
            Congress. It contains manuscript material, sound recordings, graphic materials, and
            video recordings of the March 1995 interviews conducted by Michelle Forner with donor
            Eugenia Popescu-Judetz. The interviews provide background information on the collection,
            biographical information about the Popescu-Judetzes, and further insight into the
            relationships between the materials in the collection.
   </p>
   <p>
    Series III
   </p>
   <p>
    Series III consists of additions donated in 1997 to complete the original collection in
            Series I. Eugenia Popesu-Judetz submitted the remainder of the dance notations collected
            by her and her husband. The series also contains fieldnotes organized into dance
            indexes. There are also some materials such as postcards, photographs, publicity
            pamphlets, and sheet music organized by Eugenia Popescu-Judetz into the category of
            ephemera.
   </p>
   <p>
    Series IV
   </p>
   <p>
    Series IV contains materials donated by Eugenia Popescu-Judetz in 2004 and 2011, and
            includes field notebooks with dance notation, writings by Eugenia Popescu-Judetz,
            postcards, index cards with ethnographic notes by the linguist Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu
            from 1885, and a plaque presented to Eugenia Popescu-Judetz in 1989 in memory of
            Gheorghe Popescu-Judetz from the Duquesne University Tamburitzans.

       Contains analyses of dances from the Bicaz area (originals and photocopies).
                     Prepared by Gheorghe Popescu-Judetz to accompany the manuscript on folk dances
                     from this area (see folders 113-136, 167-168). The graphs depict
                     characteristics of 213 dances (such as formation, positions, function,
                     location) and the frequency by location of 90 dances, respectively. The maps
                     portray 1) the "interference and circulation" of dances (transmission and
                     dissemination), 2) the transmission of one dance type (ardelesc), and 3) zones
                     of "interpenetration" (influences from other regions).

       These dance notation files were added to the collection to complement the files
                     in folders 33-156. The new files contain dance descriptions, dance typologies,
                     field notes, and costume documentation. There is a folder on chants and lyrics
                     from Strigaturi and an ethnography on the folk dances of Oltenia. New Years
                     customs are documented here as well as folk theater from Moldavia. Included are
                     monographic descriptions from the Bicaz, Muntenia, Moldavia, and Dobrdja
                     region.
