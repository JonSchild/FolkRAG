APPENDIX C 

Interview with Ola Perkins 

Ola Perkins, age thirty-five, Negro sharecropper on the King 
and Anderson plantation, is quite a pathetic looking creature - all 
blind in one eye and barely squinting out of the other. She is 
brown skin in color, weighs about one hundred twenty five pounds, 
and is almost sixty-tree inches tall. At the time of the interview 
she was dressed like "Joseph's Coat" in the sense that her 
attire was made up of many colors. On her head, and pulled down 
all around her ears, was a yellow, blue, and green cap with a yellow 
tassel on top. Her legs were clothed by some reddish purple stockings. 
Her skirt was black and her vest jacket was tan. Her mouth     
had only a few snuff colored teeth which were quite in keeping with 
her general appearance of unkemptness. 

The Perkin's home is located about a mile and a half back off 
the highway that runs through the King and Anderson plantation, and 
is mainly surrounded by acres and acres of dying cotton and corn 
stalks. The house, painted grass green and trimmed in a cream 
colored white, is of the two room "shot'gun" house style. One can 
stand in the muddy dirt road in the front of the house, when the 
door is opened, and see the adjoining cotton field in the back. 
The house has no windows. 

The Perkins family is a plantation family. Ola Perkins is the 
contractual head of the family. The crop and all the business
