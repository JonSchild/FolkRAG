CAJUN   -11

we take for granted a lot of the, a lot of the foods we eat.
Many people take it for granted that they, they, they're
French.  French descendants or French recipes.  But they're
not.  And what I also, who I failed to mention is the
peoples from Spain that also, all of these different
nationalities became the, if you're not a, you're not a
[UNCLEAR] anymore.  You become a Cajun because the culture
has, has, as the word corrupted from a Cajun, Cajun, well
the original, the original French, the original Spanish, the
original Italian, German, we all got together and we're
Cajuns, all of us are Cajuns.
 AL  Yeah.  Well let's go onto the question
of the Cajun language.  It's a, it's  language all of its
own now.  And it, it, but it wasn't, it wasn't allowed to be
spoken 'till fairly recently.  It was, it was against, let's
talk about that.
     :  It, it bothers me when people say it's a 
language or some say it's not a language.  It is a 
language.  It's a language, it's an old language from the
old country.  It's the language of Louis XIV.  And naturally
if you haven't, if we, if you and I hadn't seen each other
for 300 years we could both speak French or both speak
English or both speak Spanish or, but, but then you are so
isolated, no communication, that, that we speak the old
Cajun, the old French.
