   On the train August 7 I was talking to a dentist from Cleveland
and he said that he had been out to Glacier National Park and Yellowstone
Park and that he had not read a paper for a week, nor had he listened
to the radio, because he was thoroughly disgusted with the war effort.
He said that many of his patients worked at the defense plants in Cleveland
and that one of them had told him at these plants an assembled part, he
called it a gadget, came into this factory ready to be put on an airplane,
but that this part had been assembled by CIO labor and as the factory was
controlled by the AF of L unions, they completely dismantled this part
to the last screw and reassembled it before putting it on the airplane,
which meant a loss of anywhere from an hour to two hours per part.  It
is things like this he said that make you wonder if we have the right
people running this Government, and he stated further "I have been a
Democrat all my life."
