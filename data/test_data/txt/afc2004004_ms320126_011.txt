And then they had what was called a "crybaby place" for the
babies.  You see the mothers wanted to dance, so they had a 
room up there with all babies in it.  That's the reason I
understand a lot of these people come out with somebody
else's baby.  Made a mistake and took him home!
A. LOMAX
Is that where the name "fais do-do" comes from?
LUDERIN
That's right, that's where it comes from.
A. LOMAX
Explain that to the public.
EDWIN
Fais do-do, they call it fais do-do, in those days they'd go
out to these dances.  The mothers would bring their
babies. . . .
A. LOMAX

EDWIN 
The folks going to the dance, a fais do-do, or a house party
was a fais do-do.  But they'd bring the babies with 'em.
See most of these people had big families, and the babies
was on bottles or the mother would go in there and "fais do-do",
see that the babies had to go to sleep, maybe have to
go rock 'em and nurse 'em to put 'em to sleep.  And you call
it a fais do-do.
LUDERIN
That's what it means.
EDWIN
They'd rock em, "fais do-do"
