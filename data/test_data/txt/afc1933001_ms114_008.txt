   You may also tell Deanie that mother said you and
Pat might have new shoes for Easter.  I have a charge account
at Volk's shoe store if you want to get them there.  You remember
that last year you thought this time you would like to
have white shoes and that will be alright if you want them.
If you will send me your size I will get your socks to match
your dresses and hairribbons too.  And if you want the white
dresses I will find you a white slip.  Of course I may find
something that is prettier in another store and if I do I
well tell you in my next letter.
   Be mother's sweet girl and help Deanie and Tommy
and Mike all you can.
Mother
