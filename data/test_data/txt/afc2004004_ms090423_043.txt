as already noted in Chapter III, these more spontaneous and natural 
expressions are being affected far more dramatically as plantation 
Negroes participate widely in the way of the city. How may this 
change be best explained? 

Professor R..Dixon offers a useful framework for the understanding 
of what has and is occurring to the folk life. He says, "diffusion 
...depends primarily, on the triad of opportunity, need, and appreciation; 
if one of these is lacking, the diffusion is unlikely to take 
place." 53. He is speaking basically of secondary diffusion: culture 
traits are diffused by other means than primary contacts. In modern 
society, much of the diffusion is of this type. To-day the radio, 
newspapers, telegraph, movies, highways, automobiles, railroads - make      
the opportunity for diffusion greater than ever before. The needs are 
also expanding with alteration in group life. The needs are further 
augmented as Negroes come to town to buy or to work, or just come with 
the interest in "seeing". The movies bring ideas of world events and 
also awareness of the fads and fashion of the outer-world. The radio, 
the juke box, and other city things become to be more and more daily 
necessities of the plantation Negro in so far as "having a good time"
is concerned. And even more important is the fact that plantation 
Negroes come in greater numbers to Clarksdale and with this their needs
increase. With the increase in needs and the resulting satisfaction 
of these needs, there is a concomitant phenomenon of appreciation.
