Later, I heard the details of the story. When my letter came the
warden had referred it to an assistant, he to a junior and he to a trusty.
Instead of posting it on a bulletin board, this trusty had read and interpreted
it to the group of trusties. By the time the mass of convicts heard
of the letter its import had been completely lost. A letter far different
had taken its place. Like wildfire, the news spread that a man from Washington
was coming to investigate the prison system of South Carolina. Any prisoner
who had a complaint against the food, brutalities of the guards or thought he
should be pardoned would be given a hearing. The New Deal was going to be expanded
to the convicts. For days the prisoners had talked of nothing but my
coming. Violent altercations had occurred in the prison yard about who was to
see me first, who was to be the official spokesman, what each should tell, etc.,
etc.. Desperate for freedom, hungry for an opportunity to talk out with an
officer of Uncle Sam, the excited men were ready to revolt against the authority
of the state of South Carolina.

I have always wished I might have heard the story direct from the convicts.
That was impossible. Better for me and Leadbelly to head north.
