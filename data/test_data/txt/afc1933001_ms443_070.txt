Mr. Alan Lomax
400 East 34th Street
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Please excuse my delay in answering your letter, but I 
have been so very, very busy.  However, I am working on 
an idea, and I'm having my secretary take down little 
by little and probably by the time I see you again I
will have quite a bit of stuff compiled. 

I am enclosing a copy of 'I NEVER KNEW WHAT THE BLUES
WERE".  Regarding its history, quite naturally i would 
say that a girl was at the bottom of it.  I was trouping
through Texas with a pal of mine in 1915 and 1916.
My friend decided to stay in Texas, and when I returned
to my home in New Orleans I saw his girl. She told me 
she loved him so much and missed him so and said she 
never knew what the blues were until he went away. That
inspired me to write the tune. 

I NEVER KNEW WHAT THE BLUES WERE" was copyrighted May 
4, 1917, #404921.

Always glad to hear from you and to hear of the progress
of your book. 

Very truly yours, 
Clarence Williams
President.
