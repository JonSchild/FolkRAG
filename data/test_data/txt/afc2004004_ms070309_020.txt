Why not
the blues. Anything that doesn't [pertain] contain
[to] righteousness is wrong. (Why not right
When you singing the blues, you
not singing [the] a church song?
Christ didn't sing them.
I sung 'em when I were a young
man.  I was a sinner. Thirty-three
years ago. I've done wrong since,
But I've never sung the blues.
A continued sin is like an eatin' 
cancer - you can't pray to god and 
remove the burden of sin in your
heart & then go back and sin, that's like
Just like a fellow goin' down the 
road & get out in the field, he's 
in the field

Never tells
tales either -
not contain in 
righteousness -
when I was a sinner , I
used to.
