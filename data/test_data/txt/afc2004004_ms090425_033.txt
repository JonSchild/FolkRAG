I know the Lord; He heard my Cry
Mmmmmmmmmm. Have mercy Lord; Have Mercy on me. Mmmmmmmmmm. 
Mmmmmmmmmm.  Mmmmmmmmmm.  All right.  Have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, My Father (Have mercy, Father), this evening (crying) (Have mercy), once more
(Have mercy, Lord) thank You for having the privilege of assembling ourselves [getting us] together (Have mercy), one more time (We pray [are] good now; [we are] pray good now) [and making here] in the missionary (will! [where?] will! [where?]) a Baptist church (all right, all right; we don't care).  Holy Father, we thank thee for being here (Yes, we do).  We thank thee for the knowledge (Have mercy, Lord), and we thank Thee for our [the] wisdom.
