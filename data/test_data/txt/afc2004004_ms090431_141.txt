Fisk, 22. 9.

A: Did you know this too?
R: Yessir. All them old songs, you know, that works in violins and
all that sort.
A: Did you ever call square dances, Alec?
R: Oh yessir, many times.
A: Give me a little idea of how that went.
R: All to your places like hogs to the traces, you know. All to your
places like hogs to the traces. All to your partner. Meet your
partner. Swing your partner. How many more -- All like that. They
call the reel. First lady to the right.
A: Give me some of it right, will you?
R: Well, the first thing all bounce -- that's the first part of it. 
All to your partners -- all to your partners. Swing corners -- swing
corners. Salute on to your partner. Salute on to your corner. March
around. Then salute to your partner again. And they go then-- the
first couple pass to the right -- that's square dance -- pass to the
right. I dance to my partner and it go that-away. Then the next
couple go the other way around. Then they swing corners and then
promenade. Then that bar's over and they start going the same way.
Well, sometimes when you have a good dance, you get out there and
gentlemen pass to the right. Pass -- I couldn't buck to the right
(laughter).

A: What were some of the steps? Name some.
R: Oh well, some of em was -- Jump crow, heel and toe and all like-a
that. Then they had the step shufflin and all like-a that. Then they'd
have a kind of a play called where you goin, Buzzard? Where you goin,
Crow? Goin knock the gate and move just so. First to the heel and
then to the toe, go on, turn around, and you knock Jump Crow. That was
the back wing dance, you know -- I used to be at that all the time, 
daytime.
