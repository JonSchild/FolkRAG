BJ:  Oh, Lawd, I don't know.  Around in 1920, I think it was, I
remember seein' it -- diffrunt peoples cuttin' their --
womens, ya know, cuttin' off their pretty, long hair.  Some of 'em
had such a long hair, they had to sell it.
TL:  They sold their hair?

TL:  Did a lot of people sell their hair?
BJ:  They sell it to the hairdressin' places.  They still doin'
it.
TL:  What for?
BJ:  To make false hair.
TL:  Really?
BJ:  Tha's why some of the false hair they say is natural.  See, it's natchul hair  White
and colored sell it to 'em.  They cut their hair.  You cut yours
off noq, you can sell it.  You wouldn't throw it away..  You can
get big money outa your hair.  An' you see it hangin' up somewhere
or other an' somebody'll buy it.  An' all these, uh, places what
they [call] put on these, uh, different costumes an' all like that, it's
good for.  Buyin' plenty of it in there.  Old hair.  They sell it.
          This lady what I was talkin' to on the 'phone the other day?
An' she sold her hair right here.  An' she wore it long, long,
long all the time so some of the folks told her to cut it an'
make 'er look young an' nicely, ya know.  An' she, she cut it.  [Jus',]
She [jus' do it] looks good, too.  She says it different in 'er altogether.  Tha's
why she cut it. I said to myse'f, I'll never cut it, you know.
You know what I mean, on account of it's a sin, ya know.  Ya know
to cut it...A sin for womens to cut their hair.
TL:  It is, really?
