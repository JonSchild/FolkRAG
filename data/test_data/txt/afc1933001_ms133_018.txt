Mr. Ralph S. Boggs,
Box No. 625
Chapel Hill
University of North Carolina.

Dear Mr. Boggs:

John A . Lomax is in Europe and I am holding the bulk of his material for him until he returns. In the meantime, let me thank you for him for the re-print of your bibliographical article.

I should, on my own account, like to know how long your bibliography has been in publication. If there have been any issues previous to that of 1937, can you tell me where I can get my hands on them? Would it be possible for you to put the Archive of American Folk Song on your re-print mailing list? It would be most convenient to keep this bibliography bound in a separate volume for reference purposes.

With best wishes, I am

Sincerely yours,

Alam Lomax
In Charge of
Archive of American
Folk Songs
