along with the tinker girls.  In them days it wasn't wrong for
her to go and put her hands round his back and rob him.  They
were two distinct classes then -- the ploughmen and the
tinkers - and if she'd marry him she'd always have the inclination 
to be away on the road like...The ploughboys were afraid 
that is they got a child with a farm-girl, they'd have to pay 
for it. But the tinker girl would be away. There was a lot of 
carry-on between the two of them all over Scotland and Ireland, 
and I suppose England, too.... This man was out for a good time,
and he had a lot of money with him, and he met the tinkerwoman 
and tried her, but he rued the day he did.

Jockie Bruce o' the Fornet:

1) At mairket's time ( the half-yearly feeing time ) I gaed to 
the fair,
To view the young lassies and to get the fresh air,
I feed with a mannie to work his third pair,
It was auld Jockie Bruce of the Fornet.

2) On a Sunday morning he tanted ( fussed ) and teased,
He come oot o' he stable wi' a flagon of grease.
"Rub the horse well doon from the cuits to the knees,
For they're a' crippled nags at the Fornit."

3) The sun it came oot, it melted the grease,
And oot frae the hive came a hail swarm o' bees,
And says I to mysel'. "It's a plague o' the fleas,
Come doon, noo, ye lads o' the Fornit."

4) Our foreman chiel, he comes frae Braewhine,
He aince was a navvy and he wrocht on the line, ( railroad)
He feeds his horse weel, but he hauds on the twine,
For the work is aye ahin at the Fornit.

5) Here's to our second, he's a strapping young chiel,
To do his work it suits him richt weel,
But he wasna lang haem, he thocht he would heil, ( get out )
And never look back to the Fornit.

6) Our loddie was fed, he vanced and retired, ( went to the farm, and left again
And between the neap ( turnips) park and the auld coo byre,
But he wasna lang haem when he soon seemed to tire,
O auld Jocky Bruce and the Fornit.

7) Here's to our third, to rant and to reel,
Here's a bit of a poem, the half of a feel. ( a poetic 1/2-wit)
And the lassiesall round, they like him so weel,
That they'll sin gin awa' wi' the Fornit.
