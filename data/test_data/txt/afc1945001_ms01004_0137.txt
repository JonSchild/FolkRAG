[*Letter out to Panelies (Librarian) asking
for collection of Rumors.*]

August 5, 1942

Dear Mr. Brown:

We wish to call upon you for assistance in an important
study that we are making of war-time rumor. Naturally,
the first essential to such a study is the collection of
rumors. We feel that, with the assistance of your staff, you
are in a particularly advantageous position to carry out such
a collection. If you are willing to perform this important
task, the following will furnish you with necessary instructions.
          
We want to know:

1. What rumors people are telling.
          
2. Which rumors are being told most often.

We plan to study the rumors current during the period
from August 10 until noon, August 15. To help us in learning
the part that rumors play in war information, will you please
give us a word-for-word report of each rumor each time you
hear it. This will mean that you will write out some rumors
several times in exactly the same way, or maybe the story will
be told a little bit differently each time. It doesn't matter
whether the rumor is told to you or you hear it being told to
someone else-write it out just as you hear it.

Next to each rumor that you write out, put down the
city in which you heard it and the date. Keep all of your
rumor reports till the collection is complete Saturday noon,
at which time they should be mailed to:

Special Services Division
Bureau of Intelligence
Office of War Information
Room 300, Library of Congress Annex
Washington, D. C.
