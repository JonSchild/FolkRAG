Dear Mr. Seeger:

I've been hoping  to see you for some
weeks now. Nick Ray I think phoned you, and then
on successive dates expected to meet you here. He
assumes that the meetings for which you planned to
come were called off.

We are both very anxious to see you at
your earliest convenience to talk about motion pictures
in connection with your Pan American Union program.

Sincerely yours,

Joseph Losey
