INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM
OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT REPORTS [*Indiana*]
TO: Chief, Area Study Section                            DATE: Oct. 14, 1942
FROM: Associate Field Representative -- LFH [*LFH*]
SUBJECT: Rumor Report.

Enclosed is my belated collection of rumors.

My Labor contact, who is president of the Allison union, is still out
of the city, and his returns will not reach me until tomorrow at which time I
will immediately forward them to you.

I am also including a letter received from the Secretary of Salvage
Program in Indiana regarding the burial of Government equipment. In this
connection, similar rumors are slowing up the salvage collection campaign in
Indiana. State Salvage officials inform me that a number of their County
Chairmen refuse to push the drive in the face of similar rumors at Camp Atterbury,
Ft. Benjamin Harrison and CCC camps over the state.

Also, I am enclosing a clipping from the Indianapolis Star for October
fourth which describes the meeting of the Republican Editorial Association at
French Lick. The statement I have marked is being used right along by GOP
orators in these parts. It is a serious detriment to War Bond sales.

In addition, I am enclosing the latest literary effort of Carl H. Mote,
millionaire Indiana telephone executive. I know you are busy but I wish you
would take a few minutes to read it. Mote has been called to testify before
Congressional Committees on a number of occasions regarding his writings.
