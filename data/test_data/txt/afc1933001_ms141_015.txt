Mrs. Nonie Collett
Roark, Kentucky
Dear Mrs. Collett:
      I regret that my reply to your letter has been 
delayed so long, but I have been in Washington very 
little in the last month.
      I am sorry to hear of Farmer Collett's death
and, of course, I want to help you get copies of 
his records if I can.  At the time he sang for me, 
he also accompanied the singing of a number of 
other people, but the list of songs quoted below 
were sung and played entirely by Mr. Collett:
   Jackson Jail Blues (1420 A-2, B-1;  1421 A-1)
   The Butcher's Boy (1422 A-1)
   Knoxville Girl (1423 A-1)
   I'm Gonna Cross That White Oak Mountain 
      (1426 B-2;  1427 A-1)
   I Would Pawn You My Watch (1427 B-2)
   Buck Creek Girls Won't Go to Somerset 
        (1428 B-1)
   John Henry (1429 A-2, B-1)
     The type of record I suggest you have made 
is an aluminum one.  While these are not entirely 
satisfactory, they are at least fairly durable if 
they are played with the proper needles.  Twelve-inch 
duplicate aluminum disks of Farmer Collett's 
songs will cost seventy-five cents each, and it 
will take five twelve-inch records to include all
of his songs.  This would make the entire cost 
$3.75, [which must] to be paid in advance since 
the work is done outside the building by a private 
concern.
Very sincerely yours,
 AL a         Assistant in Charge,
