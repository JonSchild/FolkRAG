Dear Archie:
Losey and I saw Marshall Tuesday morning. Acting on your 
advice we underplayed our conversation with you. We said that 
you had indicated a definite willingness to discuss the matter 
if it were more concrete and that we thought you would be receptive. 
Marshall said that he could not and would initiate it, but 
that perhaps it could come in as a Library of Congress project 
and that he'd be very glad to discuss it with you next week when 
he sees you. The next move seemed to be for us to write you 
formally asking if you would take the proposal up with Marshall 
for financing. Will you?

This is the situation as we see it. Marshall did not offer much 
encouragement. Nevertheless, we believe that he would like to 
have the project go, as it is a good one and he is not unfriendly 
toward this sort of thing,  provided he doesn't have to take too 
much personal responsibility for it.

Here are the arguments that occur to us. 1) They are against 
("as a mater of policy") putting money into film production 
because it is a business. Obviously the set-up we propose is not 
a business. 2) They like self-liquidating projects. This one could 
be that through earnings on theatrical release which would go into 
a revolving fund for future productions. 3)  They profess to wish to 
help the documentary film. Here is a very concrete possibility 
which promises to guarantee a certain amount of yearly production 
and production in other fields. 4) They profess to wish to bring 
American culture to Americans. How better than this. 5) In 
addition, of course, it could work admirably for the purpose of 
the Library of Congress by making the general public more aware of 
its existence and services, and for the Fold Music Archive along the 
lines indicated by Mr. Spivak. Marshall is inclined to consider 
folk song studies as "arty" and "special" and says that perhaps the 
Foundation would not be sympathetic to helping to get more material 
for the archive until such material as was already there was more
