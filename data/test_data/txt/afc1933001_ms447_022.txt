TRAVEL.
The road got littler and littler until it just nachully run up a tree.
COMPARISONS.
So Dutch that he has sauerkraut hanging out of his ears.
Fascinating as a loose tooth.
Green as Kelly's necktie.
Handy as a cow with a musket, handy as a hog with a fiddle.
Independent as a hog on ice.
Long as a country block, longer than an Irishman's dream, longer than a
moral law, longer than a yard of pumpwater.
Out and gone like Riley's eye.
So slow you can watch the snails whiz by. Slow as a buck maggot.
A bag full of flour and a purse full of money are the best relations in the
world.
He put a lot of church work into it.
It's a poor job that can't afford one boss.
THRIFT.
Pare the cheese pretty close to the rind.
There are men who would skin a louse for its tallow.
A woman can throw out on a spoon more than her man can bring in on a shovel.
Reach for the high apples first, you can get the low ones any timel
IGNORANCE.
He doesn't know twice around a broomstick.
He doesn't know enough to pull in his head when he shuts the window.
He doesn't know enough to suck alum and drool.
Let not your tongue cut your throat.
