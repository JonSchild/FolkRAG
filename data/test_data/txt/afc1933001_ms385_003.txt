more perfect emotional accord, one in soul and in unity of 
worship, than those seas of black faces.
  Our first visit was to the Women's Camp, eighty blacks, 
five whites, the latter all convicted murderers, as were indeed 
the majority of the Negroes. A big mulatto woman, weight 250 
pounds or more, "histed" the untes [tunes]. The peculiar "long metre" 
rhythm which they give to the old standard hymns is most beautiful. 
Slow moving waves of sound rise and fall, sometimes almost 
fading out and then speeding suddenly to life in cascades of 
melody. Again low moaning voices hold a long note to breathless 
length, when, as the tone seems about to fade entirely away, 
a sharp falsetto voice breaks in and grabs the melody, carrying 
it to new life.
If evil has left its mark on these bright faces, then 
no trace appeared as they sang about a "Motherless Child" or 
found comfort in the hope of hearing "My Mother Pray Again". 
"So soon, so soon, I'll be at home", was the theme of another song
- no heavenly home, but some cabin on the Mississippi shore with 
a dirt floor and no windows, perhaps, [but] the home they had left 
behind when hard luck came knocking at the door.
 Another song with a lovely lilting tune [called] calling on 
Gabriel to hand down a silver trumpet, its office to be, probably, 
to blow in a new order, to bring confusion to the guards, 
again with home in view.
