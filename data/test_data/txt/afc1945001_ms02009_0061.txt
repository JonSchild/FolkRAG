authority with long, technical titles and date. This

curiosity about the rumor-denial.

16.  if an authority supplies an answer which [the director
considers] is weak or ineffective (or which falls into one
of the errors cited above), [the director is entitled to]
 it is wise to suggest a re-wording before printing the rumor-denial.
[It is the project which lends its name and influence
to the rumor column; the project director has the right
to reject unsatisfactory materials or badly worded
denials.]

17.  Some rumors probably should not be denied. Rumors *start here   p.17 and plan* which
are harmless, or which fall into the category of folklore,
serve a positive psychological function to certain types
of people. Most supernatural stories, fantastic predictions,
"tall stories", miracle stories, etc. have a perennial
appeal. If specific stories in this category are
denied, then other fantastic stories may be expected to
replace them--and the new crop, unfortunately, may be
more dangerous than the rumor than the rumor which was denied. It
seems wiser to allow harmless rumors to gratify the
curiosity or mysticism of certain kinds of people.

18.  Rumor columns ought to guard against printing rumors
designed to force the release of information which has
been withheld for military security reasons.
