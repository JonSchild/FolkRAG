Mr. Mason Palmer
Box No. 436
Newberry, Mich.

Dear Mr. Palmer:

I remember with pleasure the evening I
spent in your home and as soon as I can get to it
I will mail you a copy of one of your records. As
I will recall you recorded 12 songs on the 3 or 4
records and a number of them were quite good.
I would have sent you a duplicate long ago except
that I only returned to Washington four days ago.

With best regards, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
