EFFICIENCY RATINGS

Every employee in the Library will received an efficiency rating on March 31, 1943.  The Efficiency Rating Committee believes it is desirable for each employee to understand the system by which he is rated. This system requires that the immediate supervisor, the person who daily checks, reviews, and oversees the work of the employee, shall be the rating officer. This rating is then checked by a reviewing officer who shall be the supervisor highest in line of authority above the rating officer who has personal knowledge of the general performance of the employee. After rating and review, the ratings are referred to the Efficiency Rating Committee for further review with the purpose of insuring uniform rating standards, and for final determination. After all ratings are finally determined by the Committee, individual notices will be sent to each employee of the rating received by him.

The employee may received any one of the following ratings: "Excellent 1", "Very good 2", "Very good 3", "Good 4", "Good 5", "Good 6", "Fair 7", "Fair 8", and "Unsatisfactory 9. In addition, there will be a separate rating of the employee's conduct, indicating whether it is or is not satisfactory. Conduct refers to that type of action on the part of the employee that may be the basis for disciplinary action.

The Committee feels that there should be a clearer understanding on the part of employees and supervisors of the meaning of the various adjective ratings. Broadly speaking, each rating adequately defines itself. It means what it says. An employee receiving a rating "Good" is just that -- a good employee who has performed his duties in a fully competent manner and has done all that is to be expected from a fully competent employee. An employee receiving a rating of "Good" has reason to be justly pound of having completed a year of fully satisfactory service. This point is emphasized in order to dispel misunderstandings and misinterpretations on the part of both employees and supervisors of the meaning of the term.

Civil Service Departmental Circular No. 302 has defined the adjective ratings in the following way:

Excellent - The degree of efficiency represented by outstanding performance in all important phases of an employee's work assignments with no deficiencies in any phase.

Very good - The degree of efficiency represented by outstanding performance with respect to most of the important phases of an employee's work assignments with no deficiencies in any phase.

Good - The degree of efficiency represented by adequate performance in all phases of an employee's work assignments, or by adequate performance in most phases with all deficiencies outweighed by outstanding performance in other phases.

Fair - The degree of efficiency represented by adequate performance in most phases of an employee's work assignments with deficiencies not out-weighed by outstanding performance in other phases.
