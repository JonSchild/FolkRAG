BJ TAPE 7A, p. 57

         Miz Carter? They had ah 13 head a chirrun. An' ah, of co'se, 
ya know, some was grown, ya know at that rate. But the little 
one -- we all played together --we we'd stay...year after
year. You know, like that. An' never had a fight. Never. An'
I was the on'y one, ya see? Never had a fight. 
         An' we'd deal with the Thomas' an' never had a fight. We
didn't like fightin an' [never] we didn't have to fight. [We sure] 'Cause sure as we fight,
we git a whippin', see? [I...we] An' so, we jus' nev'...we, we ain' never had a fight.
Jes', see, me bein' one bird by myself, ya know. Never had no
trouble. 
          The Wesses (Wests) there, ah, ah, they had two girls, an'
I would like, liked to play with them. But they had a brother
an' he would take slingshots an' shoot at the girls. So just
one trip was enough for me. I didn' like that 'cause I never
liked boys that play rough with me. Nossuh, I stopped, stopped
stayin' with them. I'd go there an' play some day; when I, I ah,
see him comin', I [would] was ready to leave.
TL: Didn't the Thomases have any sons?
BJ: Yeah. But, but they didn't do that.
TL: They were better?
BJ: They were nice boys. They never take no slingshots an' be
doin' it. 
Ya see, there was one boy in that house with them
girls, an' boy!, he was (nambyish?). You know, he was kinda
that way; they let him have his way, like, see? And ah, jus'
diffrunt peoples, ya know? Furthermore, they didn't have no
father in that house, at all. An' brother! That boy was a 
mess! He, he would like to sling-slingshot an'...
TL: Well, who does the disciplining? The father and the
mother, or just the father?
