Stories concerning the dictators of Europe are all
of similar plot, but in each country they circulate
about the dictator of that country. The distortion 
of numbers, i.e., exaggeration, is a similar commonplace 
in rumor transmission.

d.  Rationalization.  Incongruous happenings or
fragmentary facts are rendered more plausible by
"filling in" with inferences.  Casual links are
manufactured to make a story more logical.  The 
rumors which developed about the Hess episode were
typical. Only meager fact was available, hence
satisfactory stories could only be developed by
conjecturing from related events.

e.   Concretization.  Rumors in their final form 
tend to be concrete rather than abstract in character.
Original abstractions are either deleted
or transformed into more vivid concrete references.
As such they are more easily remembered and reproduced.

 f.  Attribution to authoritative source.  Whatever
the actual origins of a rumor, it soon comes to be
attributed to some high and authoritative source.
Such gives the rumor a quality of prestige and an 
appearance of veracity which make it more readily
accepted.

Cultural determinants are our second class.  These
refer to the distortion forces exercised by the traditions,
social usuages, and customs of a people as 
as well as their immediate condition and circumstances.
We may note the following:

a.  Rumor plots tend to be stereotyped  according 
to the traditions of a people, and according to 
established precedents. 

Example:  Several weeks ago it was reported that
a German plane had landed in Ireland.  Immediately 
the rumor appeared that it was the Nazi General,
Von Brauchitch, who, like Hess before him,
had taken this means of escaping Germany.

b.  Rumors are invariably a function of the immediate
circumstances of the group.  They reflect momentary
swings in public opinion and interest.  We 
may note this tendency on two distinct levels.

1.  Of the possible range of subjects for rumors, 
few are taken, and those are determined by the 
momentary interests of the public.

Example:  During the fall of 1914, when anxiety
