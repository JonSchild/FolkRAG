T. N. T.
Tune: Barney Google.

Farmers' Union with a load of dynamite,
Farmers' Union already for a fight.
We've got courage--fortitude,
Vision, faith and seasoned wood.
Farmers' Union will soon be sitting good.

Farmers' Union will win a victory.
Farmers' Union is made of T. N. T.
When the T. N. T. goes off
Grain gamblers will know our stuff,
Farmers' Union will call the Eastern bluff.

Farmers' Union is ready for the war.
Farmers' Union, no truce will she declare.
She went out to save the soil,
And the backs of those that toil,
Farmers' Union will never know recoil.

Farmers' Union has started out to win,
Fired a broadside upon the fort of sin,
Now she'll have to fight or die
Too late to sit down and cry.
Farmers' Union, her cause will ne'er deny.

Farmers' Union will bring the bacon home,
Make her impress upon the Capitol dome.
Now her steam is running high
Shout a victory to the sky.
Farmers' Union never will say die!

NOTHING DOING
Tune--I Went to the Animal Fair.

Oh, I joined a Union band, to save our glorious land,
We met at night, in the bright moon light,
To save our homes so dear.
There was nothing there to do, except to smoke and chew,
We all went home to scratch our dome,
And that was the end of our dream--by heck.

We tried to meet again, of course it had to rain,
We put it off a week or two,
To try to see it through.
The ladies brought some cake, to keep the men awake,
We jawed and talked and danced all night,
And that was the end of the fight--by heck.
