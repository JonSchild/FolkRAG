In the Dog-House

     I heard just this morning, on the radio,
a program that has music and little funny
stories. This story was about a soldier who
was in a Canteen writing his girl a letter
when the black-out started. He shoved what
he thought was the letter in an envelope and
mailed it on his way out of the Canteen. To
his surprise he had put the letter just received
from the girl, plus one from another
girl. He's surely in the dog-house now.
