living, peculiar to the young generation. For instance, John Jones,
age 22, says:

These tales I'm about to tell you now, the old folks
very seldom tells. To hear this kind you got to go around
where there's a lot of young folks. They get to gambling
and going on, and everybody be drinking. We don't tell
these stories to everybody, cause we wouldn't let them in
to hear. They only let them in that they wants. They 
gets in a room, start to drinking. One fellow tells one
that he done heard and somebody else tells about another one.
It'll go on that way all night long, then maybe the next night
instead of going to the same place, go over to the "Gator" and
have different fellows there, and I tells the ones I heard;
then they do the same and you can learn a lot of them that way.
I guess I know around seventy or eighty. Here's one of the

Give me your tention good people, and I'll tell you about

18th of May was a hell of a day. I received a letter from
the old home town, that the big mother fucker was sinking down.
The Captain and the Judge were up on the deck having a few

you will surely drown. Shine, you will surely drown." Shine
said, "I'd rather jump overboard than going round and round
and to be on this big mother fucker and she's sinking down."
Just then Shine jumped overboard and began to swim. The devil
in hell turned over and grinned, said, "Shine old boy, you a 
long time coming but you welcome here." Shine looked over his
shoulder and laughed and said, "Mr. Devil, you got to do some
swimming to catch my black ass."

Just then a thousand white folks plopped up on the deck,
and said, "Shine old boy, come to save me. I'll make you
