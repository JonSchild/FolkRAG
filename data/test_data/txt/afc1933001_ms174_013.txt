Mr. Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
The Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Alan:

After the summer hiatus, I turn to your letter of July 19.
Your plan for recording folksong in New York City interests
me very much. I think one set of people to talk it over
with would be the Common Council for American Unity, 222
Fourth Avenue, New York City. They are in touch with all
the racial groups here, and are keen on preserving immigrant
cultures. Reed Lewis is the director; Louis Adamic edits
their magazine, Common Ground. They might have suggestions
for finding some money, or getting volunteer service. Perhaps
the Burchenal sisters could help also.

I have showed your letter to Allen Eaton, who is also interested
in your project. I do not think it likely that this
Foundation could be induced to put up the money, though we
who are in its departmental set-up have nothing at all to do
with requests for specific grants.

Would there be any possibility of getting it done as a New
York City WPA project, perhaps sponsored jointly by the
Library of Congress and WNYC? I understand that Howard
Hunter feels the program has swung as far in the direction
of defense projects as is safe, and that WPA can now take on
projects of other types.

Sincerely yours,
Joanna C. Colcord
