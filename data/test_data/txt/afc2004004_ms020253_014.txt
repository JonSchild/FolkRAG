to the, to the floor, but you're not on your back; you're on your
hands an' feet, see?  Like a crab, see?  Jus' like a crab.  Do 
the crab walk:
                        Walk, walk
                        Do the crab walk.
[*"Hop Like a Frog"*]
It's a exercise an' then it's a pretty play, you know, for the
chirren to play.  That's all.
TL:  Hop like a froggis, ah?
BJ:  Well, jus' any game.  [An'] In that same pawn game.
TL:  It's a pawn?
BJ:  Yeah, tha's all, jus' a pawn.
TL:  All you do is get down and hop.
BJ:  Yeah, hop like a frog.  Tha's all.
TL:  I see.  "Horse and buggy," what's that?
[*Pawns*]
BJ:  Tha's just stand together and lock your hands that way an'
jus' hold one another to see who can go 'round the fastest without 
gittin' dropped.  You say:
                     Horse and buggy,
                     Sail away,  (etc., faster and faster)
Just as fas' as you can go.  Around, around, an' hold.  Long as you
can hold one another's hands, one of them get drunk an' fall, why 
he's all right.  Jus' to see who can las' the longest.  That's all
it is.  Um-hum.  An' then you can say:
                      Limber rocker,
                      Stimble-stocker,  (repeat, faster and faster)
[*Horse & Buggy"*]
It's the same thing.
TL:  And you say that over and over again.
BJ:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Yeah, you doin' the same thing.  Around and
'round; see who can go around.  I can't do it 'cause I can't
stand to go around, too long.  I'd be drunk and sick, sho' 'nuf.
