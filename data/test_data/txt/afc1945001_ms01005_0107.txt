Mr. Eugene Horowitz

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Horowitz:

            I feel relatively certain that these rumors, which
I am enclosing, are much too late to be of any service to you;
nevertheless, since they were sent in to us I am passing them
on to you for whatever value they might have.

                                                                    Very truly yours

                                                                    Jean Elvins, Assistant
                                                                    Public Opinion Research
                                                                    Technician
