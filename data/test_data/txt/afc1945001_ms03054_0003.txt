SUBJECT: Rumors of Race Friction - Virginia
I have been advised by one of my assistants that while on
annual leave he contacted several residents of Richmond, Virginia.
One of these, a former Commissioner of Public Welfare in Virginia,
stated that many citizens of Richmond feared a race riot in Richmond [*5*]
before Christmas. This fear was expressed by other residents of
Richmond with whom he talked. The persons contacted felt that the
present administration was attempting to place Negroes on a basis
of equality with whites with respect to all forms of employment [*5*]
and this was premature at the present stage of development of the
Negro race. The opinion was expressed that this attitude of the
administration encouraged Negroes to demand equality before deserving [*5*]
it and that such a demand would inevitably lead to difficulties
between the races.
Several natives of the Northern Neck stated that the Negroes
in that section were holding "meetings" and organizing, in a sense, [*5*]
for the purpose of demanding higher wages and a closer approach to
equality with whites. The fear was expressed that this might result
in acute friction between the races in the near future.
One such native is an oyster packer in Baltimore and operates
two oyster shucking houses in Virginia, employing approximately 250
Negro oyster shuckers. This person stated that he is reliably
informed that as a result of such "meetings" the Negro shuckers are [*5*]
going to demand an increase of 33 1/3% in their piece-rate wage for
shucking oysters. He anticipated that if this wage increase became
effective it might increase the retail sales price of oysters to
the point where the demand would be so greatly reduced as to seriously
curtail the number of shuckers employed. The "Government's" policy [*5*]
against racial discrimination during the war was given as the principal
factor tending to foment this expected friction.
