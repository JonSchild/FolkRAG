-21- MICHIGAN

Vaguely, we recall something along this order appearing in a
book review in a recent issue of Time magazine--a book on camp life by
some Southern newspaper man--and possibly this may be only a book publisher's
way of advertising. However, here it is for what it's worth.
Dear Fred:
I am very enthusiastic about army camp life. We
lie around in bed every morning until 5:00 o'clock. This, [*1*]
of course, gives us plenty of time to get washed, shaved,
dressed, and make our bunks, etc. by 5:10 A.M. We stand
outside and shiver while some one blows the hell out of a 
bugle. After we are reasonably chilled, we stumble our way
through the darkness to the mess hall. Here we have plenty
of breakfast, consisting of an unidentified liquid and a
choice of white or rye crusts; after gorging ourselves with
the delicious repast, we waddle our way back to the barracks.
We have nothing to do until 7:30 so we just sit
around and scrub toilets, mop floors, wash windows, and pick
up all the cigarette butts and match sticks within a radius
of 150 feet of our barracks.
Soon the Sergeant comes in and says: "Come on out
in the sun, kids," so we get out and bask in the wonderful
sunshine. Of course, we stand six inches in mud. To limber
up, we do a few simple calisthenics like touching our toes
with both feet off the ground and grabbing ourself by the hair
and holding ourself out at arm's length.
