A young sailor who had ran away from home
to enlist wrote home to his parents this two line phrase.
It's hard but its fair
I had a good home but wouldn't stay there

II a young fellow was just stepping up to
the doctor for his examination.
 He passed all of his test with flying colors but
just when the doctor was getting ready to
announce that he was physically fit, the
young men began to complain that he
had the awfullest back ache. He kept
on complaining. However the doctor shouted
out "Passed" next!
The young man step out and said "I have
backaches that at times almost kills me."
The doctor interrupted the fellow and said
"See that man out there getting that bucket
of water. Well you run out there and tell
him when its full, he is blind.
