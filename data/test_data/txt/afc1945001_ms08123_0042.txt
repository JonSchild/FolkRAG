Rumors Of The War

I've heard people talking, people
that work in defense plants. They
had to give up their previous jobs to
get into essential work. They didn't
mind this but what is to become of them 
after the war. After we win the final 
Victory what will these people do. 
They can't go back to war plants, and 
while they are waiting for their old 
civilian jobs to become civilian again. 
What will they do?
Another person wants to know why does
the service men have to pay "Income 
Taxes."
