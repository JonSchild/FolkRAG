Know whether or not
my blood is good?
Well, said the Doc, 
I pricked your arm
and blood came out
didn't it-  you've got
blood haven't you- 1A!
The Doc looked at
his eyes and said "lA"!
Joe said, But Doc, you
didn't examine my eyes--
the Doc replied -- "I counted 
them -- you've got two
eyes -- 1A!

Joe Jones then said --
I [ha] only have one leg --
well, said the Doc -- see
that man over there
filling those buckets --
well, he's blind --
All you have to do is
to sit there on the 
ground & tell him 
when they're full!

And men were
talking about the
War. One said -- those
Japs are getting pretty
smart these days --
I hear they attacked
Pearl Harbor.

The other replied --
she sure must 
have been a fine
"lookin'" woman -- that
Pearl Harbor.

The Captain gave orders
to count off by fours.
Each time there was
a high-woman-like 
voice saying "one."
Finally the Captain
approached a soldier and
said in angry tones --
"Are you one?" The soldier
replied -- "yes," Are you?
