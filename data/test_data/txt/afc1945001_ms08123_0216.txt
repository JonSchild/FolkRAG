The Black Market

The Black Market operator is one who
sells meat, sugar, coffee, tires, and 
other foods illegally to dishonest merchants.
Many people are willing to patronize
the Black Market and pay illegal
prices in order to get scarce products.
The customers [report] are urged to report
this or to boy cut dishonest merchants
Sometimes the black market meat is
unsanitary, There have been cases of
illness and one death from it.  The black
market is [carried] operating quite openly
in many of our [???], over retail stores.
It is the patriotic duty of every American
to take his fair share of scarce goods 
and to help the O. P. A. fight the
Black Market.
