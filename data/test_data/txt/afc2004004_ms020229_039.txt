BJ: Yeah, ol' Blind Ida. Hah!
AL: Do you know how it got that name, Bessie? How it got to 
be called Blind Ida.
BH: I don' know how it got to be called Blind Ida. I can't think
now, but I know that what they call it. "I'm gonna git Blind Ida."
I know one thing: She ain't, she ain't, she cain't see; her eye
shut up. The eye of it is shut up. I reckon that's why they
say it's Blind Ida.
AL: What do you mean, "The eye is shut up"?
BJ: That -- Ain't got but one eye; that where the handle go down
in the hoe. Huh! An' the rest of it's whole. Don't know what it 
doin', ha, ha. Ol' Blind Ida. Ha, ha! I pull that devil. An'
go on -- I liked -- I used to love to hoe cotton. Yeah, I used
to love to hear it ring. But I, I never was crazy about pickin'
it. At all. I, I could...I learnt to pick it but I never...
But when it come to hoin' cott[i]en, I --
     But I never hoe cotton by
the day. You know, on, 'cause, see, Mama an' I -- comin' up,
Mama an' them had their own farm. See? You jus' work in the 
farm; tha's all. Not by the day. Jus' work 'till we git this
piece done, or that over yonder. Then he'p somebody else, or
sumpin' like that, see? Swap days an' things. But my
lil' he'p was jus' a he'p. Wasn' nothin' to it. You know what
I mean. All right. When I got up big enough to go out to work for
myse'f? I worked by the acre...See, aw, in, in that way.
'Cause I -- I mean, of, ah, hoin' [I'm talkin' about.] cotton. See?
AL: When did you start doing that?
BJ: Well, jus', ah, af-- when, when I was about, ah, I guess...
I guess I was aroun', ah, 15, 'cause I didn' work that -- See,
see my baby was bo'n 1914 an' I stayed home two years. You
