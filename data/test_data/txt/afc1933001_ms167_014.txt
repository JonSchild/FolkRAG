Mrs. Harold
Merryville, La.

Dear Mrs. Harold:

Elizabeth, after quite a violent but short
siege of strepto-infection, is now very much improved
and up and around again. She's taking thyroid, 
iron and liver extract and probably by Spring
will have her long delayed operation. I think by
then the medicine she's taking will have her feeling
a lot better. We have moved in town in an apartment
and the address is 912-19th Street, N.W. We'll 
both be getting a lot more sleep.

I never met Margaret Johnson but I understand
from Nick that she looks better than she sings folk
songs. Thanks for all the encouragement about Back
Where I Come From. I will forward the clipping on to
Nick. He needs this encouragement.

Much love always,

Alan
