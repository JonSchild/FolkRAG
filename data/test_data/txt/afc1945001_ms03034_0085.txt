Dear Dr. Allport:

Thanks for your letter of September 8th. Knapp has already communicated with us about the "Readers' Digest" article and the several hundred letters which resulted from it.

I agree with you that our collective experience (to date mostly representing yours and Knapp's) on the rumor subject should be pooled and no effort duplicated. I am afraid, however, that directing a national study for the Office of War Information out of Boston would present innumerable administrative and budgetary problems. When our current pilot study is completed and we know with some degree of finality to what extent and how often we are going to engage  in an intensive study of rumors -- then we will be able to decide this matter of where the study shall be conducted.

One thing is certain, however. We are not going to do anything conclusive about it without discussing the matter with you.

Sincerely yours,

Eugene Watz
Chief, Special Services Division
