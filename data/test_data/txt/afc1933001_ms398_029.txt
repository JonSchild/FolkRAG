fiddler stops his swinging bow in between measures, and sings a stanza.
While holding on to the last note he again plunges into the melody with

sightless, with nimble fingers and lonely voice, amid the flowers
that surrounded his cabin door, added to the collection of records I
was making for the library of Congress.
