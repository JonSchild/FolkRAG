State: Oklahoma       
City: Oklahoma City    
Reported by: Geo. E. Roland, Dentist

Description of the person: Maintains an office in the downtown Medical Arts Building and caters to upper class dental trade.

Rumor: There were no rumors collected from this source which had the three qualities set forth in your directive. While the dentist appeared congenial and interested in cooperating, showed an eager interest to report further on the subject if necessary, in my own opinion, this contact would not be the best possible source in future activity.

State: Oklahoma

Reported by: Dan Hollingsworth Policeman

Place or circumstances in which rumor passed; On police beat

Description of the person: Did not have a regular beat but in the course of his visits over the city, gave especial attention to listening for rumors.

Rumor: Circumstances were that a person working on a defense project had told the following story to a man who in turn told it to the policeman: The man said that he was working on the Oklahoma City Air Depot at a salary of $175 a month and was fairly well satisfied with his work. The C.I.O. Union came along and urged him to join the union so he could get $100 a week. Things like that are going on all over the United States and this C.I.O. racketeering has got the country in one hell of a shape. (For your information, the A.F. of L. is the only union working on this job as yet in the field of construction work.)
