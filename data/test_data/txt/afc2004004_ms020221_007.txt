BJ TAPE 7B, p. 5

BJ: I don't -- Never have, never knowed. 'Co'se, Moses was
stammerin' (to 'em guys ??) An' so, so I don't know [what] why, however;
I jes' don't know. [But]Whats the caus[e]in' of a child's a-stammerin', I
never have learnt that. But I know that a lot of 'em stammer.
They to go...an' ya know...they call it stammerin'; we call it
stuttering'. You, you, you know.
TL: Stuttering?
BJ: Uh-hu. Ya know, when, when they go to say something. I
been that way many times. I been to people's house an' Mama 
would tell me to go get something and she has to come -- The 
peoples come outside an' called 'er and asked [']her what'd they 
send me for. I be jus' tryin' hard as I can...Jus', jus', jus'
buttin' and' jumpin' an' down, an' tryin' to say it, ya know. Ye[s]ah, 
I...So I thank God that I ah, I got over this far. Ya know?
Yeah, uh-huh. Sure do
[So doin' that --] Ya has to speak an' go on. Ya see, ya
ain't gon'...gonna git it out, jus' go o[n]ver it. An' I tell
anyone that. It's a real good cure for stammerin'. Yes sir. 
You go to say a word an' you stammerin' on it, an' you know you're
stammerin' on that word, don't try to git it out. Jes' stop.
An' go back over it again. If you start again, stop again. Go 
right back over it 'till you jump over it an' bring that word out. 
An' you find yourself -- You can s[e]oon find yourself can talk.
(PROBABLY LOOKING AT LIST OF SONGS NOW.) It says [y]here, it
sa[d]ys here, "Goodbye An' Fare Ye Well." He already got that on 
a record. "Roll On, Sweet Moment, Roll On." "Come by Here," um...
This [hyeah] here'n here is [the one I] think he got this [hyeah] here'n here, but I'm gonna,
I'm gonna try it an' see.
