John Henry walked up on the mountin
An' the mountin was so big & broad,
Say "[Shine come] Run back & bring me my big broad
axe
Gonna hew this ol' mountin' small
Oh Lawd
"  "  "  "  "  "
John Henry he went out in Brooklyn, oh yeah
An' the people heard a rumblin' in the 
[b?? Ben??]
Said "Go ahead, young ladies, 
you must not be afraid
"That's nothin' but my hammer in
the mine
Oh lawd
"  "  "  "  "  "

John Henry he had a lil woman, uh-huh
An' the dress she was worin' was red
blood red
She went wallsin' down the tracks
& she never look back
Gwine whar John Henry fell dead
oh lawd
