My dear Miss Marryat:

In answer to your letter of October the first, I beg to say that my recordings for the Library of Congress have been limited to folk-songs. Many of these recordings have been made from the singing of negroes, which singing discloses, naturally, many dialect expressions. However, the Library is not yet in a position to make copies of these records, as they hope to do in the future.

Very truly yours,

A
