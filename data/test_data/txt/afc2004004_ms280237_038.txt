Lomax: Or she prepared herself.

Cox: Yeah, if you like.  "Pretuned".  I suppose they put that in
a little different.  Yes, that's the same thing, I should think.
Prepare.  I mean, there was no musicin to it.  That's prepare,
really...but...

Lomax: I see.  But it's like tuning an instrument.

Cox: Yeah.  I mean, you...that' how...

Lomax: How would the woman [prepare] pretune herself anyway?

Cox: I don't know.  She might damn well...pull her gear out of
the way.  Nothin' else to do.

Lomax: You haven't got another little funny one like that
comin' up have you?  It's smashing that one.  (pause)

Cox: No, I just been thinkin' o' that.  Oh, I've heard all sorts
of funny songs.  I - I never learnt all I heard, though I
heard some different ones to them, really.  I never been
troubled about all of them.  (pause)

Lomax: Did you ever hear one about the boy who was married
too young and died? [of [???]?] (pause) (cut)

Lomax: Go ahead, will you.

Cox:
It's of a old miser, in London did dwell,
He had one only daughter, such a beautiful girl.
Five hundred bright guineas was her portion in gold,
Until she fell in love with a young sailor bold.

Soon as these sad tidings the old miser did hear,
All on this young sailor he would curse and would swear.
Saying, "No more will that young man go and plough the salt sea,
And before tomorrow morning his butcher I'll be."

Soon as this pretty fair maid heard her father say so,
It filled her [heart] eyes full of tears and her heart full of woe.
"I wish you were near me, my own Wille dear,
Oh how quickly I would warn you of the danger that's near."
