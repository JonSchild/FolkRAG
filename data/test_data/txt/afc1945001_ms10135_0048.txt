1. I heard some people discussing
the war a few weeks ago and
they were asking back other who, in
their opinion would win the war. 
One of them spoke up and said
that he didn't have if the Germans 
won because we couldn't be treated 
any worse by them than we are
by the White man. 
2. I heard two men talking one day
and one said to the other: I am
not even worrying about this war
because I am too old to fight
anyway.
