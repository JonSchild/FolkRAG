RALLINDERY
(Ireland)

It's pretty to be in Ballindery
It's pretty to be in Aghalee
It's prettier to be in bonny Ram's Island
Sitting under an ivy och
Hone och hone och hone.

Oh! that I was in little Ram's Island
Oh! that I was with Pheli my Diamond
He would whistle and I would sing
Till we would make the whole island ring
Hone och hone och hone.


SAINT LUCIA
(Italy)

(Page 49 - One Hundred Folk Songs of all Nationa)

Now 'neath the silver moon ocean is glowing,
O'er the calm billow soft winds are blowing,
Here balmy beaches bow, pure joys invite us
And as we gently row all things delight us.
Hark, how the sailor's cry, joyously echoes nigh
Santa Lucia!  Santa Lucia!

When o'er the waters light winds are playing,
Thy spell can soothe us, all care allaying,
To thee, sweet Napoli, what charms are given,
Where smiles creation, toil blest by heaven.
Home of fair Poesy, Realm of fair harmony,
Santa Lucia!  Santa Lucia!


CHERRY BLOOM
(Japan)

(Page 466 - Folk Songs of Many Peoples, Vol. II.)

Cherry bloom; Cherry bloom;
Is it cloud within the sky
Frail white mist-wreaths floating by?

My! for gragrance faints in air
Wand'ring wafted everywhere.
Come with me! Come with me!
Far has fled winter's gloom.
