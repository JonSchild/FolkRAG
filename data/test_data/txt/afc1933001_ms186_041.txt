Dear Madame Comhaire:

Allow me to thank you once again for your 
great kindness in revising out catalog of
Hataiin folk-songs. I have been considerably
disturbed for a long time about this catalog
and now that you have given it a thorough
going-over I feel much better about allowing
the general public access to it. 

The Library is very busy with the Army at
present so the estimate for your records will be
somewhat delayed. Let  me know how soon you want
them. As soon as there have been any developments
on the Rosenwald project, I shall communicate with
you. In the meanwhile let me know what you think
about Southern Louisiana.

Very sincerely yours,
