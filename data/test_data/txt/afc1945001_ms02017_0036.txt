ALABAMA
August 15, 1942
RUMORS, AUGUST 8 THROUGH AUGUST 15, 1942
(Seventh Report for Bureau of Intelligence, Office of War Information)
Summary; Launching of an offensive in the Solomon Islands, apparently with success, rocketed the war far ahead of domestic subjects in the public interest. Increased public confidence and good spirits were made noticeable, since the Pacific offensive followed on the heels of some of the most discouraging news of the war.
Although racial relations and rationing were still of some concern, domestic issues were pushed far into the background.
