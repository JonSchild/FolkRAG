RE:  Rumor Clinics Project

The Rumor Project started in the Civilian Morale Service
of the Office of Education, was taken to COI, and finally brought
to us. Mr. DuBois sat in on the drafting of the plan as it now 
stands.

The Office of Education will organize in about 25 universities 
a series of Rumor Clinics, an advanced study project, consisting 
of teachers and advanced students. These Rumor Clinics will 
collect all war stories, true and false, which are being circulated
by word of mouth within their own communities. These stories
will be sent to the Office of Education, which will pass them on
to the COI and ourselves for analysis and debunking.

COI will analyze the origin of stories in the Axis countries and
in Europe generally. We will analyze circulation of them or of
their stimuli through the press, radio, subversive press, etc.
Some, but not all, of this material will be sent back to the
Clinics so that the stories may be counteracted in the locality. [***]

From this operation we expect valuable clues as to the circulation
of the rumors in this country, their extent, and their effects.
Following up leads developed from this Rumor Project,
we can guide our public opinion activities along lines that 
might not have been suggested by other sources.

As a preliminary to setting up this operation, COI is making 
a very valuable contribution, studying the circulation in Europe
of several rumors of the past two years.

Suggested letter attached.

subject to specific clearance

arises.*]
