and hogs to market at the lighter weights just as they did this Spring, rather
than take a chance on keeping them and feeding them with the future market prices
so uncertain.  Cattle feeders, especially, have been sending their stock to
market at much lighter weight than usual, thus not only reducing the supply of
beef, but producing a much inferior grade because grass fattened beef cannot be
compared with corn-fed beef.  Agricultural leaders and many other interested
in the question, feel there is enough cattle, hogs, and sheep to prevent a meat
shortage and rationing as a result, if feeders could be assured they would not
lose in keeping the stock and feeding it up to good market weights.

In a conversation August 7th with a lumberman of Lincoln, who is also
a landowner in the State, he said: "The businessman wants his profit and is
refusing to take a risk, the corporations want their profits and refuse to take
as risk, why shouldn't the farmer be smart and insist, at least, on his own protection?  
He is willing to take a small profit, if he can be assured he won't
have to take a loss after keeping them and feeding them for a period of time."

If this condition continues to prevail, it will work a hardship all
along the line in the meat industry.  Because beef is so difficult to obtain,
one large local packing company that has been employing in the neighborhood of
forty salesmen in one department, soon will be forced to lay off many of these
men would who have been contacting and selling to the small retailers, and there is
much anxiety over the loss of positions, not to mention future repercussions,
especially after the expiration of present Army and Navy contracts, when they
will  be on the basis of ceiling prices.
