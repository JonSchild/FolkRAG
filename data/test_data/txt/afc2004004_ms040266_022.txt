Dear Alan, 

I am surprised I haven't heard from
you before now. I have already wrote to you
twice and I fear I may have got your address
mixed up somehow. 
I very much enjoyed you, your friends,
and your very satisfying lunch, and I had
hoped to continue the talks we had. I feel I 
must have unintentionally said or written
something that offended you. I sincerely hope
not. 
A gentleman I know here seemed to know
you and told me, that both he and you work
for the DECCA Recording Co. His name is very
prominent in jazz promotions;- MERVYN SOLOMON.
Do you know him?
I had signed with him for 5 years, but
on being told that you couldn't use the tape you
have of me, without written permission, I had the 
contract torn up. I gave you the songs, to do as
you wish with them, and if you find use for them
with "Decca," you are welcome, and to the royalties.
I gave you my word on that before I left your house
