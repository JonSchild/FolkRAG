TAPE ' ) 80A - MICHAEL GORMAN.
My name is Michale Gorman from a place in Sligo called
Macandry. And I was taught the violin by a man named James Yennin.
Well, his father, he was the only man in the Parish that haf
a horse at this time - that's about a 100 years ago now. The
only market town was Sligo, which was about twenty miles from
Yennin's place, and he used to bring a bag of oats for each
farmer in his horse and cart. But this night he struck off about
twelve o'clock at night with his horse. He was going along the
road down to Sligo till he came to a place called Templehouse.
Well, when he left Templehouse gates he heard an awful
mournful hum in the air. So he kept going anyway till he went
as far as Ballinakarra, and the mourners caught up to him at
Ballinakarra and they stopped him on the road. All he could
hear when they were coming him on the road. All he could
hear when they were coming in the distance was, "Who'll make
the coffin?"
And another voice would say, ""Who but Mickey Yannin." And they
came out on the road and stopped him and said, "We have one of
our people is dead, and we want you to make a coffin."
"Well," he says, "I'm sorry," he says, "But I cannot leave
because I have my horse and cart and I have to be at the marjet
at Sligo. I cannot leave tonight."
"Never mind about your horse and your cart and your loads - 
that'll be looked after."
     So he came down off the cart - he didn't want to refuse, and
he tied his horse to a bush on the side of the road and he went
away with them. He went on this lovely coach and the next thing
he knew it was the Templehouse Lake, which is there still, and
this lovely road opened as he came toward the lake and they
went right down under the lake. The lake opened up and they
went this lovely passage down under the lake. So when he got so
far down, he came to his destination to make the coffin, and he
set to work andhe made the coffin.
     When he had finished they brought him back again. He thought
he was going back to the horse and cart he'd left at Ballinakarra,
but he found out when they landed him at his destination he was
outisde the market gate at Sligo. It was the first cart that was
at Sligo gate going into the market. So anyhow, he went in and 
sold his load, and struck for home.
     He told the tale when he came home what had happened. He
got the highest praise for whatever he had on his load, and
every other man was well pleased. He paid them all out. So
they had a bit of a celebration that night in the house, which
was a great place for music. Up till the time his son James
Yennin died it was one of the finest houses in Ireland. I was
only a young lad at the time. Michael Gorman, James Morrison,
Peter James, McDermott, Scanlon, Thomas Kilmannon, were all
there, and they were all taught by an old fiddler from Grayforth,
and he was attached to the fairies if ever there was one, because
