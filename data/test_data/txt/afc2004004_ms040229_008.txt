Humorous line.  About change of minister
                Sheep aye like a change of 
pasture, whether t' tae  better or tae 
worse. Our grass is gae bare

time.  "   __
      O piano player  --   It's heavenly
Just like the bagpipes.
     Funeral's not worth going to nowaday
Why not a Wall around graveyard
    There's no occasion nobody can 
come out of it & few want to go in
     Never build anything till Durant [?]

    What's the corpse today
Diligent in attending funerals
    When I drank whiskey I was
drunk before I was done & when I drank
  beer I was done before I was drunk,
but when I drink both, I'm drunk &
    done at the same time ---
