Out of this grew the typical Irish type of
dancing with the arms very stiff to the side
and the body held very rigid this way, and
the legs moving only in the vertical, and all
sorts of kicking movements, just a little to
the side. Occasionally there's a very high
kick to the vertical, and ah, this is the sort
of thing that happens in ah Norway and
Scandinavia, where they may kick 3 feet above
their heads.

When I was in Dublin on my first Irish ah
trip, I was late one night in the house of a
friend, we'd had plenty of whisky, and something 
suddenly whizzed past my nose, and my
host, who was then 73, had just kicked
something off the mantlepiece right next to
where I was standing, just to show what he
could do. Nobody said anything, nobody
smiled. Everybody looked at me to see what I
would do. (LAUGHING) But if he'd moved just a
little bit to the left, he'd have kicked my
head off.
