of folk items come clear.  That's fine.  Here
again, however, you  are likely to cut
yourself off from the process of development.  In the first
place your interest in the key items, already
mapped in other regions, distract one
from the realities of the present region.  In
the second place, you may forget that
the real object of interest of folklore study is man -
the people may disappear behind the map-pins.
   All three types of collectors forget the primary
questions of how and why.  How does folklore
grow and change?  Why is it found
growing here and not another place?  If
answers to these questions & others like them are to be forthcoming,
we must depend on the collector for them.
