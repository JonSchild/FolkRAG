Anecdote

    There were two comedians on the stage telling
 some jokes about the war.  One said to the other 
I heard that you were going to the army.  Yes, said 
the other, I  have to go down to the local board 
tomorrow.  I don't know why they want me, I am
 blind in one eye and can't see out of the other. 
 The other man said, what Class are you in.  Well, I
 am in class B.  Class B said the other?  Yes, Class
 B. Be here when they go, Be here when they 
come back.  That no way to feel said the other. No 
but why should I go to fight, I didn't tell the
 Japs to start a fight, so why should I fight. 
 The other man said you are just afraid to fight.
 Yes, that is the trouble, I am afraid to fight.
