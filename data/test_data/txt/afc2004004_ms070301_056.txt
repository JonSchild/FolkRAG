And now I hear the pig weary in its music
But wether you know they say that pigs can
                             see in the wind
That's true enough by day
But I think you may remark
That pigs no more than we can see
                             anything in the dark.

I'm not such a fool as you think
I know very well it is Pat
Go home you whistling thief
And get away out  o that
And you go in to bed
And don't play upon me your jeers
For altho I've lost my sight, I haven't
                               lost my ears

And you lads when courtin go and for your
                               youn sweethearts want
Take care not to whistle too loud
In case the old woman might wake
For the days when I was young
Forget I never can
I know the difference between
A fiddle a dog & a man
