may be some advantages in this sort of system, the administrative 
problems involved, the general attitude towards reporters which develops 
when they are not individually selected, the wasted effort in training 
people who are not originally good material, all would suggest that 
staffs be developed slowly and carefully.
The good rumor reporter is one who has many social contacts. 
He should, however, be the sort of person who, either through occupation 
or temperament, is on the periphery rather than in the center of the
group. A taxi driver represents an illustration of a person who is professionally 
in a good position. He can hear conversations without being 
expected to participate. He has opportunity for contact with many 
different people. The barber, however, is in a slightly different position 
since ordinarily he is engaged in the conversation and it is rather 
difficult for him to perform the reporter's function of noting rumors as 
they are passed. It should be understood that these generalizations do 
not necessarily describe all the members of each occupation. Dentists, 
who in many ways are similar to barbers in their relationships to their 
customers, prove to be good sources of rumor reports. This may be a function 
of the more intimate contacts between dentist and patient, than 
between barber and client. Personal qualities are also important in the 
selection of rumor reporters. The socially active, exuberant person is 
not necessarily a good rumor reporter because such a person is too often 
in the focus of a conversation and would therefore have difficulty in preparing 
a careful record of what passes. (As part of a counteraction program, 
one must not overlook the possibilities of recruiting a rumor monger into the 
project in order to be in a position to bridle his tongue.) Reliability,
