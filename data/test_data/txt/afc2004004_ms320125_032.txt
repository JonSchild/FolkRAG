CAJUN   -31
     :  Well it's, it's my pretty blonde, you've
gone and left me.  You left me all alone and I can't live
without you, and this, this sort of stuff.  And he's saying
like to be away from you is hard.  Or he says like dying is
nothing but it's the knowing that I'll be six feet under and
will never ever see you again.  Jolie Blong, come back to
your daddy.  [LAUGHTER] It's, it's really touching.
AL  I wonder that, that the Cajun men are
always in the position of, of mourning over women.  And none
of the women seem to be mourning over the men.
     :  Well, the, the women do.  But the women
was, in the olden days wasn't, was almost like forbidden, it
was forbidden for a woman to, to say play music in a group.
She would have been thought as of a no good woman.  But in,
at home some of the women, like my aunts and some of my
sisters, and I'm sure many, many other ladies were some of
the best singers.  And if you do get a, a woman to play an
instrument a man has a hard time to, if she decides she's
going to do it a man has a hard time standing by her.
AL  But in the old days the women sang but
in their homes.
     :  At home.
AL  And did they play. . .
     :  They played instruments toom, but at
home.  They did not go in, well in bars.
