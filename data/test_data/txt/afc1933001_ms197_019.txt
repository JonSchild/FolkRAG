to this matter, I would be delighted to pay you for that
time. But I do need a full text of Shoo Fly, with as many
stanzas as would make an interesting text---several from
the Civil War period and any other more recent stanzas
which will show how the song has been used for other purposes.

Yours very sincerely
Alan
