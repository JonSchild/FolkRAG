   A second role is that of a local antiquarian.
Here one accepts the fact that a culture is
going to die soon.  One records for preservation
and study as much of this culture as
possible.  There is a danger here, of course,
that because of the attribution of the
quality of preciousness to the oldest and therefore
never to dead phases of the
culture, we may begin to fight for its
preservation.  The tendency is to begin to regard
the culture as static -- to leave out of consideration
its living quality (present and past) --
   A third role is to collect material for the
interest of its distribution.  So many child
ballads in Oklahoma!  So many riddles in
Kansas, etc.!  Good!  The map gets full of
pins, the lives of the movement
