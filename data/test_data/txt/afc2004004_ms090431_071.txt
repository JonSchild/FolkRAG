COCAINE SONG
My old girl think she's just a card,
But Eliza has two heart.
Hey, honey, take a wifff on me.

The olf girl go my way,
If you ging her,
I won't let you stay.
Hey, hey, Honey, take a whiff on me.

Now I know, boy,
Yo better line up right.
I'm gonna whip your thing (?)
In the cows tonight.
Ho, ho, honey, take a whiff on me.

If that old gal
Dont't treat me right,
I'm gonna put in a dozen
Next Saturday night.
Ho, honey, take a whiff on me.

Coke I love;
Coke I crave.
I think it's gonna
Carry me to my grave.
Hey, hey, honey, take a whiff on me.
