talked over the song and he was pleased to 
know of the many books & articles that 
are being published about it all. We bought 
the book "[Corn Country]" by Herbert Covey 
of which he had givin one chapter over to 
Home on the Range and one of my sisters
the oldest one at Liberal Kane Lue received magazine
the "Cattlemen" and a very interesting chapter
[of] about the song, is in that really he has a good 
article & map description of how the song went
from out here in S. C. to Texas and how it
happened to be claimed to be written by a Texas
man. This is written by J. W. Williams
                                         2220 Piedmont
                                         Wichita Falls.
so my being curious
got the best of me so
that I would write you.
We have had it very hot & dry here
in Kansas for over a month now.
Guess it has been general and I know
it must have been hot in Texas.
Respectfully
Mrs E Womer, Bellaire Kans
