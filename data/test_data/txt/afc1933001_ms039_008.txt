Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your telegram received. The shipment was
made in two boxes, one the recorder and the other a wood
box with mike, tubes, etc. and also 50 then inch records.

Enclosed please find invoice for all the records
and needles, as well as for the sapphire enclosed.

We get Alan off and believe he should get
some very nice records with the improved outfit.

I am going to be at the Richmond Modern
Languages convention with a machine. I don't suppose you
will be there.

Sincerely yours,
L[?] Thompson

P.S. I can't give you any specific instruction on
the Fairchild. If it gets weak, tip the mike
upside down & right side up a number of times for the
carbon granules are opt to pack & this loosens them up.
Keep mike dry. You will have always to use the
mike close for it has inherent mushing noise which
must be covered up
