Anyway Tony was a great favorite in the City of Chicago, 2also. He was
no doubt the outstanding favorite in the city of Chicago, until
he enticed me to go to the City of Chicago one several trips. I
got the blues and went back to New Orleans. I finally stayed for
awhile until a contest came up once. And successfully I won a contest over Tony
Jackson. That threw me in first line. I never believed that the [cont]

Q. Tell us something about what used to happen at those funerals

s we had Alfred Wilson and Albert Carroll. They were both great
pianists. Both of those boys were colored. And we had the Kid Ross, a [wh]
white boy. Kid Ross was one the outstanding hot piano players
in the country, there was no question about it In fact all these men I mentioned , they was hard
to beat. Kid Ross, he was a steady player at Lulu White's, one of
the big mansion[a]s in New Orleans , and one of the big sporting
houses there. To[ ]ny Jackson, he used to play at Gypsy Schaffer's,
one of the most notoriety women I've ever seen in [j]high class way. She was 
the no[r]toriety kind that every[ ]body liked. She spent her money
and she didn't hesitate about spending it[.] and her main drink was
[?] champagne and, if you couldn't buy it, she'd buy it in
abundance. Alfred Wilson
