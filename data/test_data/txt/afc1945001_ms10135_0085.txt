Here's to Hiller who wants to rule the world
The poor fellow had some bright ideas
But the Americans wasn't in the mood to accept them
So they're gradually being piled in the trash 
can in back door.

Negro boy - Mom, why should Old Uncle Sam take my brother away from home.
Mother: Well, to fight for his country so we'll be safe forever if we win
Boy: Well, he might just as well come home, mom, cause I heard already - The white is winnig and Bro' anit nothing like white.

 Negroes are just little fools - sweet & just don't care 
Every time they hear the war cry, they jump
in the mists of the fight without one thought 
Of "What am I getting out of this" & they 
don't get anything either
