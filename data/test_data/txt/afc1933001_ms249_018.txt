Dear Alan: The nicest thing Mr.
Spivacke ever said about me
was that I lacked the dog-in-the-
manger attitude he otherwise found
universal among folk song people.
(He also included you in my class).
That was before the advent of Gertrude
Knott, the He Four-flusher of the
Twentieth Century: whose artistic sex appeal
I see has now won an appearance
at Madison Square Garden -
God save the mark!!

So, I hesitate, even to you,
to pass judgment on the appearance,
last night in Dallas of Seigmeister
(see enclosed program)
