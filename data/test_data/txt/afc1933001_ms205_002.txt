Mr. Alan James Lomax
2809 Rio Grand St.
Austin, Texas

Dear Alan:
Mother has said that we all should send you a birthday letter. I
don't know what to add to what she had said to you except that I agree
with her at a 100% ratio. Your happiness and success is one of the
very dear wishes of my life, and nothing gives me more pleasure than
to know that you are happily busy and making progress in the growing to
be a man.
Yesterday I spent the day in Fort Worth on business and went to pay
a friend of mine who is a Regent of the University. His name is Wilmot
Odell. He is a very splendid gentleman, somewhat of the calibre and
character of Edward Crane. Just before we separated he asked me if
Alan Lomax was related to me. He then said that he read your column in
the Texan with the greatest pleasure, that it was the best writing in
the Texan, and that he is already missing it. I swelled up like a proud
turkey at his unstinted praise of you.
Now that you are almost through your first University examinations, I
want you to know that I know clearly that grades have sometimes very
little relation to success in life, and that they are not a true measure
of what one accomplishes in college. I do think, however, that you
are smart enough to get good grades and at the same time make progress
in other directions that give you more pleasure than in following a
set course of studies. I shall not worry at any grade you make. My
chief concern always is that you stay happy and contented.
Don't be too hard on your companies who are not appreciating their
opportunities. The world is full of all sorts of people and you have 
no [object] recourse but to live in the same world with them. In other words, 
I want to see you popular with your school-mates. Of course, you can
have a critical attitude but you must be careful about always saying all
you think. Moreover, it isn't necessary.
With a heart full of affection for you and every good wish for your
16th birthday, I am 
Yours affectionately,

JAL:B
