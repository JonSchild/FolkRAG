TAPE 39...JOHN STRACHAN:

I've had meals ad ale here I should think for very near thirty
years running, and I never enjoyed anything like it. Lord - it
would take me two hours to tell ye. I couldna tell ye in two
or three minutes. You've no idea the things that would happen.
There was a chap, Meldrum - a good-looking chap, but ye know, I
willna be through tomorrow, if I start to tell ye. Well, this
chap there -- there was a girl called Jeannie Stewart - you never
saw a bonnier queen in your life. She was well-made and pretty
and just a simple kind of a lass. She had the bonniest crimpy
dark-brown nearly black hair, great big open bonny grey eyes. My
God, she was a fizzer. Well, this chap Meldrum, he was terrible
on for this lass and she was one of the -- real nice-looking, - but
he was fearful on for this girl - but he never made anything of
her. And I met him and I was pleased to see him, and he just
immediately begun about this girl. Lord - if I would put in a
word for him. And what I could do would help him a wee bit, and
I said to him, "James" - his name - "Master James, there's nothing
I would like better. Man, I would fairly do the courting for ye.
But I dinna think it would help ye much." Well, and thenmeal and
ale come on about the middle of September, after the harvest was
finsihed. Well, this chap - I wrote him and said that we were
having meat and ale, and that he should come across and look
after his goods for himself, you see. I had plenty of other things
to do and I wouldna----Well, it was tremendous good. He came across
and the first thing that happened was there was a chap, Leslie
Mearns, - I could tell you a whole history about his breed - it
would take me a half day to tell you all about him -- this Leslie
Mearns was a good-looking chap, and he come from a good family o'
blacksmiths - great singers and great dancers; and Leslie Mearns, 
he'd been a bartender in Glasgow, and he'd a wee bit o' tone
about him - a nice blue suit and a choker. Well, well, Leslie he
was dancing with Jeannie, and Meldrum's face - the lad I'm speaking
about - grew grimmer every minute of the day. He was growing grimmer
and giving the queerest look to Leslie Merans; and my God, I saw
that and I thought there'll be bloodshed before long. I could see
Meldrum grimmer and grimmer every time, you see. In the beginning
I was real bad at him. "Mackie," I said, "If you start this thing,
I can't get you to do anything and before the finish you'll be lying
all the women and behaving half as ye shouldna be." Well, well, but
the thing finished up and I was putting out the lights, and soon
the place was in darkness. And you know, they always put on their
bonnets at the last reel at that time; that's a bit that nobody
knows or ever takes any notice of but mesel'. They put on their
bonnets at the last reel because if they let go of the girl they
would maybe no get her again ! There was always more men than
