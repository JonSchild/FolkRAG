            There have been a marked increase, and a steady persistence, in anti-Semitic rumors revolving around Selective Service, military service, etc.
Our rumor analysis indicates that in different parts of the country rumors
are being circulated about "The Jews Evading the Draft".

           We have obtained a special statement from General Hershey designed to
cover these allegations, and have sent extracts to those newspapers and rumor
clinics who have asked for an authoritative statement to meet these rumors.

           There now comes to our attention (both from our rumor analysis and the
correspondence panels of the Bureau of Intelligence) evidence of a systematic
anti-Semitic campaign along a new and more clever line. In the past weeks we
have received material from

                          Chester, Pa.                                         Chicago, Illinois
                          Minneapolis, Minn.                             Springfield, Ill.
                          Duluth, Wisconsin                               Missoula, Montana
                          Boston, Mass.                                      Rutland, Vermont
                          Long Island, N.Y.                                  Washington, D. C.

pertaining to circulation of either mimeographed, printed, or "ditto
sheets" material which says:

  "The First American soldier to kill a Jap was MIKE MURPHY
   The First American bomber to sink a Jap battleship was COLIN KELLY
   The First American flyer to bag a Jap plane was EDWARD O'HARE
   The First American Coastguardsman to detect German spies
                     was JOHN CULLEN
     The First American to be eulogized by the President for bravery
                     was JOHN PAT POWER
     The First American to get FOUR NEW TIRES was NATHAN GOLDSTEIN."

      We have evidence that this material is getting mass distribution in a
systematic manner; the distribution began in September, 1942, and has been
spreading to date.

      Some of our informants point out that this material is being circulated
around Army Camps or National Guard Centers.

      It is my feeling that this material should be brought to the attention
of the Public Relations officers of the Army and Navy. (In one instance, our
