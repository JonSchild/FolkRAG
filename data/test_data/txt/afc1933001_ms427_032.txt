BY FIENDS YOU WERE TORTURED AND MARTYRED  [[title underlined]]

By fiends you were tortured and martyred
For daring to herald the truth;
Your message brought hope to the toilers
And kindled the fervour of youth, of youth
And kindled the fervour of youth.

The patient, long-suffering rasses
Were stirred by your clarion call
Demanding the land for the people;
Equality, freedom for  all, for all.
Equality, freedom for all.

Your spirit gigantic and lofty
The enemy could not subdue;
No prison could mar your horizon,
The bredth and sweep pf your view, your view
The breadth and the sweep of your view.

In Russia unlettered and gloomy
And strangled by tyranny's rule,
Your eagle-eyed boldly envisaged
The  life that is happy and full, and full
The life that is happy and full.

The foe could but crush what was mortal -
The clay of your bodily frame;
The country will always remember
And sacredly cherish your name, your name,
And sacredly cherish your name.

The seeds of your teachings have fallen
On fertile and nourishing soil
The triumph of justice is coming,
The rule of the rasses who toil, who toil
The rule of rasses who toil.

SONG OF THE VOLGA BOATMEN   [[title underlined]]

Row, boys, row, row, boys, row
Toil, tho' weary, row, boys, row!
Row, boys, row, row, boys, row
Toil, tho' weary, row, boys, row!
Heav'n may help the poor man's need
Soon the end may crown the deed.
Row, brothers, row, for yon is the shore
Man shall labor evermore.
