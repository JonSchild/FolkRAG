Reel of 9/26/61, Side 2, Song 25 [*30*]

WON'T IT BE GRAND
A shout that was a favorite in the cornfields and at cornshuckings

CHORUS: Won't it be grand,
Won't it be grand,
Oh won't it be grand,
Won't it be grand,
Since I know I got a seat in the Kingdom,
Won't it be grand!

If my sister asks for me,
Tell her death has done something with me,
Once I know I've got a seat in the Kingdon,
Won't it be grand! (CHORUS)

When I get through toilin' here,
Out in the sunshine, out in the rain,
Since I know I got a seat in the Kingdom,
Won't it be grand! (CHORUS)

You can talk about me as much as you please,
The more you talk, the more I bend my knees,
Lord, I know I got a seat in the Kingdom,
Won't it be grand! (CHORUS)

When I get through toiling here,
Out in the sunshine and out in the rain,
Lord I know I got a seat in the Kingdom,
Won't it be grand! (CHORUS)

I got a mother, dead and gone,
Left me here to weep and moan,
But once I know I got a seat in the Kingdom,
Won't it be grand! (CHORUS)
