[*LOVING HUSBANDS*]
TL:       How old were you then?
BJ:       Umm, I was about twenty-four, five.  Maybe.
TL:       About 24?
BJ:       Reckon I was about twenty-four, twenty-fi -- it wasn't long 
before I went to Florida.
TL:       Just before, huh?
[*lone*]
BJ:       Um-hum.  Well, tha's funny when you think about it.  
I cain't flip with nobody . . . I said I ain't never got that flippin' 
stuff with nobody.
TL:       That was the only flip you every had, huh?
BJ:       What I mean I ain' never liked that puttin' off with 'em, 
you know?
TL:       Oh, I see what you mean.  That was the only guy you ever 
felt that way about?
BJ:       Um-hum.  Well, I mean, that much, ya know?
TL:       Even more than your husbands, huh?
BJ:       Oh, goodness, I [didn' know about] never liked them!  Hum, hum, hum, 
hum, hum!    I loved 'em after I got 'em; I never liked them before-
hand.  Not at all.
TL:       After you were married you [liked 'em hu] liked 'em, huh?
BJ:       Even before I married.  [I liked 'em before I see 'em.]  
But I didn' like 'em [before I see 'em ?? - yawn here.] when I firs' seen 'em.
TL:       BEssie, tell me your love stories, okay?
BJ:       Umm, I don' know much about love stories.
TL:       You said you liked your husbands but you didn't have that 
same strong feeling that you had for this one guy.
BJ:       When I first seen 'em, ya mean? . . . I would say I had a much 
stronger feelin' when I come to know 'em; I love 'em.   But I jus' -- 
that's the first [person] somebody I see that I liked jus' drivin' along an' saw.  
See?  Wa'n' no sense in that.  Back when somebody [I] was crazy - - like 
somebody I didn' know nothin' about . . . An' so . . . There's not much 
sense in that. . .But I hear people say they be that way, jus' like 
'em, jus' -- An' then they like this one, like that one, like 
the other one; I can't understand it.   I mean for themself I'm 
talkin' about.   I like 'em all.  I like about everybody.   But I mean,  
jus' to like 'em for myself.   Wish one -- desires one for myself --
wish that was my husban' or sumpin' like that!   I don't like that.  
That's they husban' out there, somebody else's man.   Might be someone'll
