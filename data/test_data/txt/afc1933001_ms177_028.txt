Dear Mr. Lomax:

   Thanks for your note about your possible trip to
Virginia.  I'd very  much appreciate your getting in touch with
us if you plan any trips in the near future.  You can wire collect
or make a collect call to ELdorado 5-5200, New York and we can
complete the arrangements then.

Sincerely yours,
Eleanor Stierhem
