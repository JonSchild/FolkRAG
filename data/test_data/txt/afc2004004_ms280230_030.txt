Tape 4: ISLA CAMERON. . .EWAN MCCOLL:
Pullin' Bracken: Isla
1) Why do I sit and sigh, pullin bracken, pullin bracken?
Why do I sit and sigh all alone and weary?
When I see the plover rising or the curlew wheeling,
When I trow my mortal lover back to me come stealing.
2) Why do I sit and sigh, pullin' bracken, pullin' bracken,
Why do I sit and sigh on the hillside dreary?
O but there is something lacking, ah but I am weary,
Come by bright and bonny lad, come hame again and cheer me.

Dowie Dens of Yarrow: - Ewan.
1) There was a lady in the North
I ne'er could find her marrow,
She was courted by nine gentlemen
And a ploughboy lad frae Yarrow.
2) These nine gentlemen sat drinking wine,
Sat drinking wine in Yarrow.
They hae made a vow among themselves
To fecht for her in Yarrow.
3) She's washed his face, she's combed his hair,
As oft she's done it afore -
And made him like a knight sae bright
Tae fecht for her in Yarrow.
4) As he walked up yon high, high hill
And doon the big hills of Yarrow,
There he saw nine armed men
Come to fecht wi' him in Yarrow.
5)"There's nine of you, there's one of me,
It's an unequal marrow.
But I'll fecht ye all one by one,
In the Dowie dens of Yarrow.
6) And there they flew, and there he slew,
And there he wounded sorely,
Till her brother John came in beyont,
And wounded him most foully.
7) "O father dear I dreamed a dream,
I think it will mean sorrow,
I dreamt I was pullin the heather bed
in the dowie dens of Yarrow.
