Mr. Alan Lomax
General Delivery
West Liberty, Kentucky

Dear Alan,

I was really pleased to hear from you at last because in your previous letter you spoke of being ill. Your father and I were really worried. I thought that my admonition to take care of your health was sufficient but you seem to be taking too many risks. I am not the one to tell you to take things easier because I have been driving myself unmercifully. But do watch your health!

You seem to forget that our estimate of 250 records included about 100 from Fuson. You seem to forget also that I am not a slave driver. I am satisfied that you are trying your best. If I seem dissatisfied with the way you do things occasionally, it is usually because I feel that you are expending an awful lot of energy in the wrong direction - never yet because I feel that you are not doing something or other. So do not ruin your health.

Father and I have been discussing the possibility of sending you on to Akron, Ohio to record the singing of Captain Nye. The venerable captain has been sending his songs on sheets of paper over 15 feet long! Do you feel up to it and would you be willing to go if I arrange it? Let me hear from you soon about this.

My invitation to speak before the Cosmos Club came through the Librarian himself and I suggest that you accept it irrespective of financial considerations.

I am sending the records and playback needles. If you want cutting needles notify me immediately! Please be very careful in giving us your address. We have been sending everything to Hyden, Kentucky, according to your instructions. Now you write on Sunday and tell us that you will be somewhere until Monday. Which Monday? I shall have to send copies of this letter to both Hazard and West Liberty.

Sincerely,

HS
mr
