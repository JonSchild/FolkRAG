Mrs. Magny
Port-au-Prince
Haiti

Dear Mrs. Magny:

The longer I live it the less I regret the dreadful mistake 
you tried to save me from. Perhaps things were a little more difficult 
because of it, but what of that. You'll have to excuse us for 
not calling again in Port-au-Prince, but our lives were too full of 
work and food-getting and illness to allow for any calls. What little 
time we spent in Port-au-Prince afterwards was mostly sick abed 
with dysentery.

I do wish there was some thing I could do to repay you for the 
favor you did me and to somewhat blot out the memory of my hysteria. 
If you can think of anything that the Archive of American Folk-Song - 
of which I am at present in charge - can do for you, let me know.

In the meantime, I send you my wife's and my own best wishes 
for the further success of your successful self and the future success 
of your book. When is it to appear?

Sincerely yours,

AL:ep
Haiti
