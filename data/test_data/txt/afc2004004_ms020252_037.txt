Look-a Yonder

BJ: I can just imagin seein' 'em when he's goin' across the
heavens -- the street -- come walkin' down with his travelin'
shoes on. Ready to travel. Um-hum.

TL: Where did you learn that?

BJ: On, I heard that years -- way back got it in Miami side, though...
That come from across the sea. We jus' can't sing it like them peoples
sing it over there -- the same way ya know, but I meant that all them double up
things. 'Cause you see, we two, three singin' it, you
know. It's just like I said:
Travelin' shoes, (Makes you travel)
Yes, the shoes, (Yes you travel in the)
Shoes, (Yes, you travel)
Somebody catches it an' goes right on wich ya. Y'know, like, like
that.

TL: Oh, I'll bet that's an old one.

BJ: Yes, it is.
