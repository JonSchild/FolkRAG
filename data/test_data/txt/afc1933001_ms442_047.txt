Lafayette, Louisiana, Friday Nov.

Dear Alan,
I'm all apologies for having neglected 
your comprehensive outline of folk songs
so long - I'm terrifically busy. First
I joined an art class in order not to have
only my thesis on my poor little brain
and thought I should only be entertained
and lo and behold there is some work to it. 

Later I became substitute in
the school near me, and my present sick
teacher promises to be out a long time
and I am working for a terrifically
low salary, but feel honor bound to continue.
I study colonial history, American inventions,
Europe, and Africa several hours a day.

My thesis is progressing along though
and by next week, I should be able to send
 it for corrections in its entirety. If I
were not afraid to lose part en route
to Baton Rouge, I should send you
pages copied, as conditions I'm keeping
