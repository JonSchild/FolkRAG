Russia's Youth

In a small peaceful village
in Russian there was once peace and
quiet until the Nazis's took over.
There was one young Russian boy
who's parents had been shot down
like dogs before his very eyes. The
young Russian boy loved his country
and vowed to himself to help his 
country as much as possible in order
to drive the Nazis's to there doom.

The people in this town had to all
move out and go live in the near by
forest. The countryfolk had to have
someone to stay in the town and
warn them if the Naziss were coming 
in to the forest to get them. The
young Russian Boy was only to
glad to do his part. He woould
warn the people in the forest by
whistling like a bird.

One day a group of Nazis will
handed, where going to go into
forest, but they didn't know the way 
in to find the people they were after,
