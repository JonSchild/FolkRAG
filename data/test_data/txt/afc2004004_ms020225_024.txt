Bessie Jones Reel #10 of 10/6/61, Side I, song 3

LAY AROUND TOWN

Lay around town
With all sorts of class,
And you had me bound in jail, oh babe,
If I hada known
Was gonna be this way
I never woulda left my home.

CHORUS: Oh me,                   (
                                                 (
Oh, my,                                    ( (2)
                                                 (
Never would I left my home. (

Your great big legs
And your pretty red shoes
Have really turned me a fool, oh babe,
Your pretty big legs
And your red shoes
Have really turned me a fool.

CHORUS: Oh, babe,               (
                                                  (
And, oh, my,                             ( (2)
                                                  (
They really turned me a fool. (

You're layin' around town
With all all sorts of class
And you got me bound in jail, oh babe,
You layin' around town
With all sorts of class
And you got me bound in jail.
