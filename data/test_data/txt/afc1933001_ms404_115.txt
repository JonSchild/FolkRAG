day of our stay he came to me
and said, "Boss,["] them other niggers
you been foolin' with don' know
nothin'. I understan's what 
you want. Lemme [?] drain
your car and I'll take you
to some real guitar picker. He 
did. Lucius Curtis and William 
Ford were two of them.
To get Lucius started
I had to buy a new 75 cent set 
of strings for his guitar. He 
[?] proud of them until I 
mentioned the expense when dividing
the tip between him and Willie.
But his guitar picking was good. "I
could do better 'cepting for my 
back. I hurt it lifting in 
a logging camp," he told me.
