John Store 
(?) 


A lady had heard that
at a certain store in the country
you could buy all the meat you
wanted. The very day she caught
a street can and went to the store. 
Sure enough the story was true. So
she went in the store an asked for 
a sixteen point ham. 
The clerk said "here you are." 
Then she asked for a twenty 
pound stewing beef. The clerk 
loudly gave it to her. Then she asked
for thirty pounds of bacon. 
The clerk said "here you are
madam." 
When she had all she wanted. 
She asked the clerk if she would
deliver it. 
He said "I am sorry madam."
She said, "But you have a wagon
outside." 
He said, "I know it, but you
have the horse in your bundle."
