Rumors

All around us, we hear people saying "I heard
that Stalin is going to break off relations with
the Allies", "I heard that they are going to ration
milk", and all sort's of foolish and unfounded
rumors. If only people here in America would
realize that, that's just what Hitler and all the
rest of the axis "maniac's" want them to do, repeat
rumors that may start a revolutionary war
within America.
When you hear a rumor, tear it apart
before you pass it on to someone else. Make
sure that you know what you'er talking about,
not just guessing.
On all the fighting front's of the world
our brothers, cousins, fathers, uncles, and sweet-
heart's may be fighting. Fighting, so that
"the government of the people, by the people, and
for the people, shall not perish from the
earth"
One careless word, which we, at the 
time, may thing insignificant, may mean the
life of someone who holds a treasured place
in our heart's.
