If the Japs or Germans fight in Europe or over here.
We’ll run them off of the hemisphere. When the war is over we’ll send Hitler’s corpse with a “C. O. D.”, and the all the other Germans in boxes, marked “free”
And all the Japs, who incidentally look like saps, we’ll leave them behind, because judging from the books they act very “unkind”
When we come back from across the “lake”, Hitler will surely know this was for him has been one big mistake.
But if Hitler comes over here, he’ll find out we don’t have anything to fear.
When this war is over, that seems like an eternal game, Here’s hoping everything will be the same.
“And the lights go on “agin”, then we’ll wash our hands of this great big sin.
