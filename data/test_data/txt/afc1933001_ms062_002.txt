Dear Mr. Lomax:

We are very sorry in deed that there has been so much delay in 
replying to your letter of July 25 referring to two songs in
"King's Book of Chanties".

Your letter was addressed to Oliver Ditson Company at Boston,
Massachusetts. The Oliver Ditson Company has been affiliated
with the Theodore Presser Company since 1931, and early in 1937
the Boston offices were closed and the records and organization
were brought to Philadelphia. The fact that the letter first
went on to Boston and was delayed there for a while partly accounts
for this very late acknowledgement. 

Now, we will be very glad indeed to give you permission to use
the Ditson version of "Roll the Cotton Down" and also the tune
of "The High Barbaree", and we do not feel that there will be
any question or doubt about granting this permission. However,
the book, "King's Book of Chanties", is published under a contract
or royalty agreement with Stanton H. King the compiler,
and we do not feel that we are justified, in view of the terms 
of this royalty agreement, to grant permission for the use of 
any of these chanties as they appear in King's book without
obtaining Mr. King's approval and consent. We do not believe
he will raise any objection, and just as soon as we have his 
consent we will write you a formal letter granting permission
for the sue of the two chanties above named. 

Of course, you will insert the usual credit and copyright acknowledgement
line stating that the songs are taken from the "King's
Book of Chanties" as copyrighted and published by the Oliver Ditson
Company.

Yours very truly,
THEODORE PRESSER CO.
