Joke

A Betty Gableish young beauty 
was watching drill one day. Suddenly 
a rifle volley rang out. With 
a surprised scream, the young lady 
shrank back directly into the arms 
of a young pvt. who was standing 
behind her. "Oh," she stammered 
with a blush "I was so frightened 
by the rifles." Won't you please forgive 
me?"

"Not at all, not at all," spoke up 
the quick-witted private. "Let's go 
over and watch the artillery."
