[*MARRIAGE TO 1ST HUSBAND 13*]

[*Cassius marriage*]
BJ:  I was jus' a lil' chile, y'know?
AL:  I know, but you got pregnant how long after you...
BJ:  I reckon I got pregnant about...I don't know...She was
born in September, so you can guess about nine months back.  Like
I tell about, what it was.  I did have it - I had it all down on a piece of
paper, somewhere.
AL:  January, February, March, April, May, June, July,
August...So it was February.
BJ:  FEbrurary, um-hum.
AL:  How long had you known him then?
BJ:  I was jus' tellin' you now, he comin' there befo'
Christmas.  Along in October, somewhere back in there, along the
firs' September.
AL:  Your baby was born, and then four months later, you
all got married.
BJ:  Thas' right.  We got married through it this way.  I wil tell
ya, I don't know how they took that, but you see that war was
goin' on, you know, fixin' to come on -- Firs' Worl' War, yeah.
[y'know.]    An' ah, so, this man said it bes' to marry, y'know,
on account a that bein' my chile.  An' [he figure (fixin' )] in case of
it had to be drafted, it had to be have it named right, y'know.
An' so we went down to the place -- the place down there --
I had never seen the place to see it.  An' our boss man was a grand
[(grangerman ?)] juryman an' uh, Mr. Pitman (lightman ?) but he was sumpin'
else, too.  An' they had Mr. Pitman to date, the papers back, he
tol' me. He said--he had 'em in a envelope, our boss man did.
An' he say he gonna have Mr. Pitman to date 'em back, you know,
befo' the time for the baby to be born.  I'm jus' tellin' you
this, you unnerstan'.  An' Mr. Pitman dated 'em back befo' the
time for the baby so they can say I married befo' the baby was born, y'see,.  An' ah,
tha's the way it was.  Tha's (the on'y way [we] ya see ?) the papers.
An' they stood there an' jus' give us the questions; you know,
the marriage ceremony questions, theyselves.  Y'see?  In the
place.  In Fitzgerald.  An' so tha's the way it was.

AL:  You musta been just crazy about Cassius.
BJ:  Ah...I liketed 'im.  I loved 'im...I loveded Cassius.
Very good.  He was a good man.
