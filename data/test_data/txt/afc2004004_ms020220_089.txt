     He gits his mule an' his [wag] hoss an' his buggy an' --
On the back of the buggy was fixed a long screen thing about
half as long as this -- oh, little more than half as long as
this -- table? An' had a 'vidin' (dividing) place here an' a
'vidin' place there. You know, to put diffrunt snakes. He'd
ketch 'em. An' they tol' him about it an' that man was out there
a little while. An' so Miss Susie told 'im to tell 'em not to
worry 'cause this man was comin'. [He,] An' he'd git 'im. An' see,
that was her, her money, ya know, 'cause it was her place.
Quite natchully. Nobody care about that.
