folk-music. The newly formed Indiana State Folk-Lore Society 
and, especially, the Indiana office of the W.P.A.
Writers' Project cooperated with me and made the trip a
delightful one. Most of the songs were English folk-songs
from S. Indiana, with French songs from Vincennes and Amish
hymns from Goshen to add an exotic flavor. I must say that
I was surprised to find the state such a rich field for the
folk-lorist, but I am anxious to go back and do a more thorough 
job of collecting there. 

Sincerely yours,
