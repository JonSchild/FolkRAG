Chorus:
They had spurkles (for chopping tatties) they had tattie choppers,
Faith they were not joking.
They said they'd barred the pig claw that he was never yoking,
By the stane, the pig was fu' and did not care a dokin' (hedge-leaf)
At McGinty's. etc. . .

Lomax: Jean Robertson's habit of holding on to her notes -- did
she invent that?
Davie: All the class of travellers does that. It's just among
them - they can't help it. I've told her, says I? "It's a good
song, but don't make it tool long."
     "Well, that's the way," says she. "My father teached me and 
my mother." I told her two or three times that.
Lomax: Give me an idea of how that long way goes.
Davie sings"
Bonny Udney, Bonny Udney, ye stand where ye shine,
And the more I think of you it makes my heart warm. . .
See what I mean? Did you ever hear anybody do that but Jeannie?
I've heard other travellersdo that. The older class used to sing
it the same way. And the younger man I suppose have got teached
off their father and mother.
Lomax: Do bothy people sing that way?
Davis: Well, no. Unless a ploughman might sing it with a long
droll. I've heard it in Ireland, too. Most of the Irish travellers
do that. I wouldn't say thepeople of the country. Only
travelling about people do that.
