Dear Madame Comhaire: 

We regret, exceedingly, the delay in 
getting the records to you. As you know, Mr. Lomax left the 
Archive on October 15th, and in the ten days I have been here, 
I have had my hands full. 

In order to make up for lost time, we have 
gone ahead with the duplicating of the records, hoping that 
the estimate will be satisfactory to you. Shall we ship them 
to you at the above address? The cost of the ten records, including 
a fifty cent charge for packing, is $18. 

I hope that your work is going well and that 
the delay of the records has not seriously inconvenienced you. 

Sincerely yours, 

B. A. Botkin 
Assistant in Charge 
Archive of American Folk Song
