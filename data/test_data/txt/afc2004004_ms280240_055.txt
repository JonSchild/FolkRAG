wages then they were or not.  Then He'd give them back-handers
too - for that.  It was a terrible time, that time.  It was done all
over in there right enough there.  It was happened away back
50...65 years ago.  And years before that it was common.  And
then up to about 50 to 40 years back it died away then and they
started punishing them.  They were sued - a lot of farmers were
sued, they were.

(Of course a woman would naturally prefer a young strong man to
an older man, wouldn't she?)
Yes, and a lot of the farmers committed suicide over the heads
of that.  A lot of them committed suicide.  There was one just
in (Banffshire?) about a year ago did that.  He drowned himself in
the pond - in his own pond.  He was carrying on with another
girl and that and he and she had a child till him and he took the child
and buried it in the garden and then he come and drowned himself
in the damx - in his own dam - and they got him there about 18
month ago I reckon, or 2 year ago.  That's truth that.  That happened
in Bamffshire not far from a place called Abersharder.
A place called [Rosy Burn Foggylawn?]  There two roads.. there's two farms
with the same name, and they're not far away from one another
from one you see, from one another.

(Have you ever heard the girls talking about this themselves,
I mean these farmer girls)
Oh yes.  I've heard them talk about it, I've heard them.  There was
a Laird, there was a Laird up in used to carry on with the nurses
too.  I've heard em...some of the Lairds doing that.
