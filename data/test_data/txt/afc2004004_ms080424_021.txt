TAPE:  Roll 43 B
Ray and 'Stan Hicks    7

(Ray):  If you got caught left that road, you had it!
AL:  What do they do to you?
Ray:  They fine you!  So much money to pay, 50-60 dollars, along there.
Stan:  Charge that boy $50 for getting one of them red laurels.
Ray:  Next time, forcible trespass  On to 75 or 100...
AL:  Do you think that's just?  Do you feel that's good?
Ray:  Well, it wouldn't be good in the way I was raised, but with people
now, probably it'd good with them.
Stan:  Well, myself, I'd think it'd be cruel, myself
Ray:  Yeah, the way I was raised..
Stan:  Yeah, they just (tore?) a playhouse up this part, like it is, it's
like I told 'em.  We tried to get somethin' done about it, but we
never did, never have got anything done...
Ray:  But you see now people that don't know to gather herbs, that don't
bother them.
Stan:  No, the ones that come in and bought it, what they do, they come
in here and they buy it and then sell off enough to get their money
back, and they'll build a house on it, and then they post it.
Then you can't dig a shrub of no kind, you can't break a bush...
Ray:  That's why I got mine right up there now, here!
AL:  You wouldn't sell...
Ray:  No, count of that!  'Cause I don't feel good to go up there on my
other land and get run off if I happened to go unthoughted and get
over the line.  I want to say I feel the best to say it's mine,
I paid the property tax, I've never missed a tax since I've took over
the property here.
AL:  How do you feel about people buyin' up the land and then sellin' it
