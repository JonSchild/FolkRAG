crazy bout my father anyhow, but I loved mama. But just
seemed like I loved him better. But my sister, Bessie,
she's just wild.
A:  Do you think it's natural for a girl to love her mama
better or her dady better? Most in generally.
V:  Most ingenerally all girl children love their father better
than they do their mother. Cause I know I did. I loved my father
better than I did [my mother]--
A:  What about the boys?
V:  The boys would love their mother, better than they do their
father.
(A explains about Vera's little brother)
V:  Only brother that I had. Mama just owned four--three girls
and one boy. And he was just above me and he died. Something
was wrong with his head. He want sick but he was just born
with a big head. Great big head. He lived to set lonely.
Everytime he would sit down, his head would just tumble
him over. Just throw him over. He had plenty life mama say.
He'd eat well and he'd play the way babies should do, but
he just had a big head.
A:  Vera, were you natured up like your mama or like your. . .?
V:  I'm like my mother eve ybody said.
A:  And Estelle, what was she like?
V:  She was like my father's sister, Alouvinia, the one that
sing so. They say she was just exactly like her in the
look at her. But I'm got all the ways and evy'thing
like her. But evybody say I look like my mother.
