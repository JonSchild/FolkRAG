Anecdote

A group of h[?] were 
huddled together in a shelter 
during an air raid. The bombs 
were falling at an alarming rate 
but one lady, blessed with a 
fatalistic philosophy, turned to 
a little man beside her, 
shrugged.

Its no use worrying - if my 
name's on a bomb, I'll get it.

The little man wasn't impressed. 
Thats all very well for 
you. But my name's Smith.
