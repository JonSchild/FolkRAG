"Got some money for the professor?"
No money, they was told to get out.  This is a high
class place.  Collected about a dollar a piece.
Everybody had to give something.  That kept you in 
money and lots of times girls were jealous of the
professors.  Girls made from $20 to $100 a night.
Took them for $5 for a short while

I wanted to be the champion pool player in the world.
Wanted to combine this with piano playing.  Played
for $500 a game.  Went to Galveston and Houston.
There were no musicians around.

[1906] Returned to Mobile and wrote "King Porter Stomp."
Partially wrote before.  This was a combination of
three or four tunes.  These tunes were private material
that I kept to shoot at a guy.

Question:  Do you still play pool?

Morton:  Between playing piano, shooting pool, playing
poker under strong lights, looking for marks on 
the cards, my eyes is shot.
