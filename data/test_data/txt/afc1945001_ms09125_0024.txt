Anecdote on the war.

Hittler called up the divel on the
telephone one day the girl at centrial
lessented to all they had to say. hello
was Hittler speaking is old man Satin
home.  Just tell him it's the King/Hittler
who want him on the phone.  Hello Satin
answered and what do you want.  well 
said Hittler thinking I have called you 
for advice.  You know I want to
see who is going to win this war.  you
know uncle Sam is getting pretty
tough, and if I don't watch my
step I will be all messed up. I
once though I could bluff U.S.A. but
things turned out different when they
all most had me hanging from a 
tray.  Well said Satin I think
you have been doing harm enough, 
and about the U.S.A. who do you
think you that you could bluff, so
I think U.S.A. will win, and your
work is just about finished.  So hang 
up your phone put on your hat
and come on down here. (-----).
