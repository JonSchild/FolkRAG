the first of October I sent an account
of expenses asking Miss Rogers to put
it into such shape that I could
hope for payment. I have not
heard from her about this and
I do not know that she received my letter.

You have herewith a duplicate
of the original report I made on my
first trip to the Rio Grande River and
incident points, and as you request,
I enclose a brief, formal report
of my second trip to the Panhandle
and to Arkansas.  I shall be
deeply grateful if you can get
these accounts settled and paid.
I have submitted two separate accounts.
Sincerely yours
John A. Lomax

You paid the account of my first
trip which must be in your files.
