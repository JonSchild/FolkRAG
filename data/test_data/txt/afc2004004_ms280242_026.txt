Bogie's Bonny Belle
1) As I gaed doon to Huntley's toon a morning for to fee,
I met Bogheid O' Carnie, wi' him I did agree.
To work his twa best horses, cairt or harry or ploo,
Or anything aboot fairm work, I very weel could do.
2) Aul' Bogie had a daughter, her name was Isabelle,
The lily of the valley and the primrose of the dell.
When she went a-walking she choosed me for her guide,
Doon by theburn o' Carnie to watch the fishes glide.
3) The first three months was scarcely o'er, the lassie lost her bloom,
The red fell from her bonny cheeks and her eyes begin to swoom.
The neist nine months was passed and gone, she brought forth to me a son,
And I was quickly sent for to see what could be done.
4) They said I should marry her, but o' that wouldna dee,
Said, "You're nae match for my bonny belle and she's nae match for thee."
But noo she's married a tinker lad, he comes frae Huntley toon,
He mends pots and pans and paraffin lamps and he scours the country round.
5) Maybe she's gotten a better match; old Bogie canna tell.
Fare-ye-weel, ye lads o' Huntley, and Bogie's bonny belle.
"I couldna tell you whether it's true. Just an old bothy song
I heard goin' about. I went around the markets and heard Jimmy
Mcbeth -- I used to sing along with him. I have not seen Jimmy
for years now, but when I was along with him he was good. Jimmy
kinda killed himself with getting drunk and lying out nights
and getting cold.

McGinty's Meat and Ale:
1) This is nae a song of love or it's not a song o' money,
There's nothing very pitiful and there's a nothing very funny,
There were Hieland Scotch and Lowland Scotch and Butterscotch and Honey,
But there's nane of them ava, there's a mixture through the three
There's nae a word of beef brose, sowans or sa'ty bannocks,
Wi' pancakes or pace eggs for them wi' dainty stomachs.
It's aboot a meal and ale, it happened in Glen Monnicks,
At McGinty's Meal and Ale, where the pig went on the spree.
