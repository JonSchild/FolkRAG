Then fail this earth, let stars decline,
The sun and moon refuse to shine;
All nature sink and cease to be,
That heavenly mansions stands for me.

I HAVE A CALL FOR YOU

I have a call for you my friend,
And you will come and see,
But there's a call for me that's first
And soon this call shall be.

Oh, brother, come and preach two days,
Tell all to come and see,
And sisters will you come with them,
And weep two days for me.

And when you come and see my grave,
A lonesome place it will be,
You will see a widow weeping there,
She is weeping now for me.

The Baptist Church has been my home,
And this you all do see,
And now you know these are the ones,
To come and preach for me.

There are many preachers I could name,
But seldom do I see,
And you that feel a freedom come,
And preach two days for me.

As for the text which you select,
There are plenty you can see,
As for the one that lies on your mind,
That is the one for me.

I want good order on the ground,
