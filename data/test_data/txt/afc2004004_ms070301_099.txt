3.
The first month is the worst of all
Your feelings they will try
There's nothing but great lumps of wood
On which you have to lie.
Then after that you get a bed
But its' as hard as stone
At night you dare not make a turn
For fear you break a bone
4
An' if you be thin when you go in
Oh! They can make you thinner,
For if your oakum be not teezed
They are sure to stop your dinner
And when you go to Durham gate
They'll bind you with employ.
And dress you up so stylish,
With a suit of corduroy.
