Dear Mr. Spinacke: Not one 
time have I said to hurry
on the machine to me. Truly
March 1 or March 15 or even 
April 1 would be ample time 
to disturb these peaceful 
days of soft, springtime weather, 
the nightly singing of the fiddler
 crabs, the cheering fragrance
of blooming rosebuds.
Take your time, look properly 
after Mrs Coolidge and don't 
worry about your friend, 
JohnA. Lomax
