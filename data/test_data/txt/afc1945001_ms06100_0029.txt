Heard in a Denver restaurant, August 7: 

"Do you understand what is meant by a "cost-plus" contract 
with the federal government?" "Yes, it means that the contractor 
can charge the Government whatever his records show is necessary 
to complete a particular piece of work or the contract which he 
has. He then adds 10 percent for his personal profit." "Well, 
that would certainly lead to waste and extravagance because the 
more the job costs the more the contractor would be able to make." 
"Yes, that's just the size of it. The Government has tried it 
both ways and seems to feel that the cost-plus basis is the most 
economical; I can't see it that way myself." [*24*]
