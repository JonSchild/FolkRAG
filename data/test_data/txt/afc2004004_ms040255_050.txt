Dear Alan, 
The cold weather 
gave Willie a bad bout of 
neuralgitis in the right eye 
- he is to undergo a difficult 
operation for it in Aberdeen 
Infirmary next month - so I 
haven't recorded every much from 
him in the last week or two. 
He remains in very good spirits,  
though, and his comments on life
