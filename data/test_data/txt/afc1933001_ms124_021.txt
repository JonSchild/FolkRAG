Dear Miss Wheeler,

During the months of September and Octo[v]ber this fall I shall
be in the Eastern part of Kentucky, making records of folk-songs for
the Archive of American Folk-Song [of]in the Library of Congress. I am anxious to meet[x],[and] [cooperate and as] and
work cooperatively with the collectors who have worked in the region of the region, [since in that]
[fashion] in order that the Library may feel doubly sure that its
Kentucky collection will be truly representative of the [best that]
[can be found] quality and variety of Kentucky folk-song.

I feel sure that (through your work in the Hindman Settlement
School) you have established contacts with interesting singers and communities
that should be represented in the Archive (and I feel equally
certain that you [would be]  will be able to offer me valuable [advice and]
suggestions in regard to collecting in your [area] neighborhood. I should like to
know whether or not you will be [at] in Hindman during the two months
I plan to spend in [the neighborhood] the mountains and whether you would be willing
to help me in the Archive's work there.) I would greatly appreciate
a letter from you, as detailed as you care to make it, about your
work in Kentucky folk-song, about the region or[xx] regions in Eastern
Kentucky you are well acquainetd with and about the singers [in] that
you know. I plan to leave Washington about Septem[e]ber the first.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-Song
