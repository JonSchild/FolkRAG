His draft board ask him, What Class, he wished 
to be in, he answer in reply, I want to be 
in class B.  Be heah the day they leave 
and be heah when dey come back. 

Buck private Pete was in charge of the 
cooking once. So there was a German 
prison so Pete told him to peel potatoes 
and when the German finish he had 
peel them so thick so Pete said go look 
over and peel them peeling again you 
understand you are not in Germany. 

When you buy stamps buy at least four
We’ll have enough bomb's to finish Tokjo

Buy a stamp buy a bond to skin that skunk
Across the pond. “Hitler”. 

Let’s get down to business and brass taxes 
I think all us women to join the
wack

 They are rationing coffee, they are rationing 
meat and now they are rationing 
them things that go on your feet 
(shoes)
