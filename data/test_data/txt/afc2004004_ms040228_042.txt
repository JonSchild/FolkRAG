(Skew Ball - 2)

If the saddle maintains me I'll warrant you there
You ne'er shall be beat on the plains of Kildare.
But as they were running by the distant chair
The gentlemen cried out skew ball never fear
Altho' in this country thou wast ne'er seen before
Thou hast beaten Miss Sportly and broke sir Ralph Gore.
