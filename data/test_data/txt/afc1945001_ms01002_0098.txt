Dear Mr. DuBois:

In reply to your letter of January 30, let me say that 
it is our understanding that material distributed to the Rumor 
Clinics through this Office would in all cases be released by 
the Office of Facts and Figures.

I am getting up a definitive list of the places where the 
Rumor Clinics are developing. Our problem at the moment is to get a 
competent person to follow through on this project.  and is about to be 
met this week.
Cordially,
Chester S. Williams
