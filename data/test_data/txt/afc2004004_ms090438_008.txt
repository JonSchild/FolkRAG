1 Jesus is coming shortly to judge the hearts of men
Receive, change and glorify the church.
The wicked He'll destroy, rid the world of sin.
And then set up His kingdom on this earth.

--CHORUS--
I'll be glad to see the Son when He comes,
I'll be glad to see the Son when He comes,
Glad to see the Lord, then I'll get my sure reward,
I'll be glad to see the Son when He come.

2  He went unto a far country, to prepare for us a home,
To receive for Himself a kingdom and return
The righteous will be gathered with Him around the throne;
While the wicked will be bound in bundles to burn

3  He'll bind up the broken hearted, satisfy the poor,
Open the prison house to them that's bound
Abase him that's high; exalt him that's low
And all the haughty, proud, shall be brought down.

4  He'll plead the cause of the needy, hear the widow's cry.
And God Himself shall wipe away their tears,
And in the first resurrection, the dead in Christ shall rise,
And live and reign with Him a thousand years.

5  He will regard the prayer of the destitute,
The poor He won't despise, but give to every man his just reward.
Heal all our diseases, open blinded eyes,
And declare the day of vengeance of our God.

6  The gospel of the kingdom must be preached at God's command
And the message be declared from door to door,
His chosen people gathered and placed in their own land
And they never will be plucked up, any more.
