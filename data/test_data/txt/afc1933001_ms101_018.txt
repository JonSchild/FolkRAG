I should suggest that you do 
not wait too long. 

If you should come, 
we - my husband and I - should 
be glad to have you stay with 
us. Mr. David Cohn, who 
frequently contributes to the Atlantic,
is a friend of ours, has visited 
us, and will assure you your 
watch will be safe! And we 
are sure that a man who 
writes as interestingly as you 
do, must surely be a sound 
risk! 

If you do come, 
simply let us know in advance 
and unless there is 

some hindering circumstance, 
we shall be happy to have 
you. 

Sincerely yours, 
Mrs. Phil Stone.
