Winston-Salem, North Carolina     August 3, 1942

In talking with a fellow he stated that some time ago he heard that at some
Southern Air Base a pilot was sent out in a bomber to patrol the coast and search
for a certain submarine and that the Commanding Officer of the Base would not
permit the pilot to carry any bombs on his plane and that the pilot spotted the
submarine but could do nothing about it since he had no ammunition and that the
pilot returned to his Base and reported seeing the submarine and then the Commanding 
Officer sent out a squadron of planes loaded with bombs and the submarine
was sunk. This statement was made by a party who travels a great deal and he
appeared to be a rather intelligent type of person.   [*14*]
