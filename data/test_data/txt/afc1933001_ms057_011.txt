Chief of Music Division

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

We got from the Presto Recording Corporation
three sapphire cutting needles. They are giving us an 
improved quality of records. An accident happened to
one, which I re-enclose to you. I suggest that you
send it back to Presto for repointing, and at the same
time ask them to send me two additional needles. I 
need to have that many, I think, in reserve. You can 
address me, until further notice, University Station,
Austin, Texas.

Recently, we are making good progress in getting
records--Spanish, English, and negro. Sunday we had 
four engagements, forty or fifty miles apart, and filled
them all in about sixteen hours of work. Here in Brownsville,
I think I could stay profitably for the Music 
Division throughout a month, and turn up something worth
while every day. Before I leave this section, I will
have, I think, fair samples of the stuff that can be
got here, including cowboy songs--a type that you have
asked me more than once to get on the library records.

We have been slow getting out of Texas because 
I was held up much longer in Houston, Texas, on a private
enterprise which had nothing to do with my library work. 
Going out of Texas, we will first strike Arkansas, then
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and South
Carolina. I shall keep you informed, now and then, as
to our progress.

I do not believe that I have reported to you
that the batteries finally reached us safely. Upon
attempting to use them, I found them stone dry, and without
any juice whatever. I have since had them filled,
