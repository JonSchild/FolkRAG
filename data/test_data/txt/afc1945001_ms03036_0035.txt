The Government does not give us the truth about what is happening
in the war. They are telling us only what they want us to know. [*3*]

he doesn't want to because he is afraid we would run into a depression if
the war stopped too quick.
Clerk, St. Paul, 8/13

Prices are still rising. The merchants are not paying any attention
to the OPA.
Housewife, St. Paul, 8/13

his neck out and they had to save his neck.

The employers are the only ones that are being compelled to make
sacrifices. The farmer and the laborer have not made any sacrifices at all.
Member of the Employer's Association, St. Paul, 8/13

They tell us that we out here don't know we are in a war. I say
it is in Washington that they don't know they are in a war, because the
Administration and Congress have put politics above winning the war.
Head of an Employer's Association, St. Paul, 8/13

People are not conserving on their tires or other things because 
they don't think the Government is telling them the truth about shortages. [*3*]
They have lost confidence in their Government's spokesmen.
Head of an Employer's Association, St. Paul, 8/13
