"Hell, Blake, he'd know who you were.
Alan: ______________________________
[*Leroy Carr*]
Bill: Well-uh I don' know, he was-uh livin' out in Joilet.
(engine trouble?)
...linin' up his blues, you know what I mean, better than the average guy, you
know, that could sing, sure-nough.  An'-uh Leroy an' Scrappy Blackwell played
together, Scrappy was a good guitar player too, he was really good.  But he
wasn' no good by himself, without Leroy he wasn' anything. An'-uh, co'se Leroy
could play with anybody playin' with him an' he would mix with people but
Scrappy he wouldn', he wasn' a mixer, he couldn', you know what I mean, there
very few people he could get along with because he always-uh figgered that
nobody was as good as he as.  An'-uh he's cranky too, he'd-any little thing
he'd bly off the han'le, you know?  But they all was alright with me.  I got
along with 'em all. I unerstood him an' I knowed the kinda fella he was
an' I never would-uh try to force nothin' up on him.
Alan: One good time right after another, hunh?
Bill: Un-hunh.
Alan: Tell me about women of those parties?  What folks did and what they said...
Bill: Well, I'd went to-I'd had a little experience in-uh ba'el-house an' honky-tonks 
an' things.  An' I've been aroun' in parties with Blake, Blin' Blake,
an' aroun' at parties with Blin' Lemon an'-uh parties with Leroy Carr(?),
Tampa Red, Georgia Tom, an'-uh diffent guys like that. An'-uh this guy
they call-uh-uh, what that guy name'
