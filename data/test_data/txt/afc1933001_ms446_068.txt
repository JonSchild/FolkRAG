'Twas there the ancient Baptist stood,
Whose name was John, a man of God,
To do his Master's will.

The holy Jesus did demand
His right to be baptized then;
The Baptist gave consent.
On Jordan's banks they did appear,
The Baptist and his Master dear, 
Then down the bank they went.

Down in old Jordan's rolling stream 
The Baptist led the Holy Lamb,
And there did Him baptize.
Jehovah saw His darling Son,
And was well pleased with what He'd done,
And owned Him from the skies.

Believing children, gather round,
And let your joyful songs abound,
With cheerful hearts arise.
See, here is water, here is room,
A loving Savior calling, come,
O, children, be baptized.

Behold His servant waiting stands,
With willing heart and ready hands;
To wait upon the Bride.
While candidates are waiting there,
Come let us join in solemn prayer,
Down by the water side.

No. 54

Sister, thou wast mild and lovely,
Gentle as the summer breeze,
Pleasant as the air of evening
As it floats among the trees.

Peaceful be thy silent slumber,
Peaceful in the grave so low;
