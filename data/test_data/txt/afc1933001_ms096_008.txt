then return the review blanks to me
for my signature? I shall
be eternally grateful. I am
writing to you, with apologies,
since I understand that
the Curator in charge of
Folk Songs is not now in
Washington.

Always sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax

P.S. Tomorrow I am
shipping to the Archive
another batch of com-
plete records.
