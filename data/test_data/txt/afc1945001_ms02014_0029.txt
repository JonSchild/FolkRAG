Mr. William H. Webber, #4

our arrangement was made, he was transferred to the
night shift in an outlying residential area.  He had
no telephone at  home and it was almost impossible to 
contact him daily.  He failed to turn in a single 
rumor because of this difficulty, a death in the family 
and other distractions.  He said the work was 
interesting and under ordinary circumstances would 
not be too burdensome if it did not  interfere with 
his duties. He said he was willing to help whenever 
called upon if his situation on  his own job would 
permit.

                                           Sincerely,

                                          Kenneth P. Middleton
                                          Field Representative,
                                          Bureau of Public Inquiries.
