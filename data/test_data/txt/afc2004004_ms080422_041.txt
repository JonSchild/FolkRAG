You can put your fingers in the holes if you don't believe.
He was a doubter. He took his fingers, put them in the holes,
and said, my lord and My God....(he sings)

"Now, I am your man, Thomas,
I am your man.
Look at these nail scars here in my hand.

Well they drove me up that hill, Tom,
I am your man.
Drove me up that hill, Tom, I am your man.
Drove me up that hill, Tom , I am your man
look at these nail scars here in my hand.

Well the thorns crowned my head, Thomas,
I am your man
Thornscrowned my head, Tom, I am your man.
Thorns crowned my head, Tom I am your man
Look at these nail scars here in my hand.

Well they laid me in the tomb, then, I am your man
Laid me in the tomb Thomas, I am that man.
Laid me in the tomb, then, I am that man.
Look at all these nail scars here in my hand.

AL: That's a very different kind of song than the one you
sang before. That's more like a shouting song, do you get
people shouting on that one?

Nimrod: Yeah, they do that. You could get to singing like
that...going along the road...like some old woman with a
bonnet on her head, and dresses way down here to her shoes,
apron with pockets in it....we travel along the road you know,
and had no knives to split the pine torches..........have
about two to bring 'em back from church. You get singing
them songs you know, the old woman lifts up her dress and
start shouting right in the road you know. Instead of hoding
up that light, you put 'em all down, and you have to light
a new torch........Torches were made out of black pine.
