LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING
(Negro National Anthem)

(Sheet Music Published by G. Schirmer)

Lift every voice and sing,
Till earth and heaving ring,
Right with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the list-ning skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea,
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won,

Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chast'ning rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,
W e have come, treading our path thro' the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast,

God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears,
Thou who has broought us thus far on the way;
Thou who has by Thy might,
Led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the paht, we pray,
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, should forget Thee
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,
May we forever stand,
True to our God, true to our native land.
