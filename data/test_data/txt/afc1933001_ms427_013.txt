THE INTERNATIONAL
(Sheet Music - Published by Rand School)

Arise, ye prisoners of starvation!
Arise, ye wretched of the earth,
For justice thunders condemnation,
A better world's in birth.
No more tradition's chains shall bind us,
Arise, ye slaves! No more in thrall!
The earth shall rise on new foundations
We have been naught, we shall be all.

Refrain:    'Tis the final conflict,
    Let each stand in his place
   The international party
   Shall be the human race.
   'Tis the final conflict
   Let each stand in his place
   The international party
   Shall be the human race.

Wewant no condescending saviors,
To rule us from a judgment hall,
We workers ask not for their favors;
Let us consult for all.
To make the thief disgorge his booty,
To free the spirit from its cell,
We must ourselves decide our duty,
We must decide and do it well.

Refrain:    'Tis the final conflict
    Let each stand in his place
   The international party
   Shall be the human race.
   'Tis the final conflict
   Let each stand in his place
   The international party
   Shall be the human race.

MASSA DEAR
(Negro)
(Page 128 - Laurel Song Book)

Massa dear, massa dear, O look down a-while!
Winds am still, heav'n am clear, you can hear dis chile,
All the home folks is gone, and I'm lonesome here
Work is o'er, day is done, take me, massa dear,
Take me home, for Delight went away with you
Call me home from thenight, As you used to do,
As you used to do, as you used to do.
