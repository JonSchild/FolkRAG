money for what they was gittin' an' doin' an' learnin', an'
doin'.  An' they all on Sea -- Sea Island; they rich s-- buggers; I
ain't jokin'.  An' they got it.  You sure talk about everybody
don't use just their hands.  Some folks use their head.  An' but
they got sense to use it, see?  But, but we say nothin' about
them use it 'cause we seen 'em there.  I seem 'em outa my
own eyes, an' know 'em, too;  I seen 'em.  An'
you'd be surprised at the polices come there.  Befo' day in the
mo'nin's.  An' they w-- some gittin' off, come by; some goin' on,

But, I'm tellin' you, she was out this world.  An' she was a
colored woman, too.  Now, I was there an' I seed that.  I see
it; I say, "Uh-huh.  Nothin' they ______ tell me from now on, an,
'You're superstitious; you're this-that-an'-the-other. . .' "  They
was there, ta he'p theyse'f.  They wasn't there to hurt nobody,
to keep no nigger down or nothin'; they's there to he'p theyse'f
an' with they business, whatever they was doin'.  An' they hope
(helped), too.  An' so that folks ain't like. . .
AL:  This woman was good?
BJ:  Yeah, she was good.  No doubt a that.  She, the last I heard

But I don't know whether. . .if she there right now.  But I -- She
may be.  But they'll know.  She's good!  She's out this world!
She's some woman!  But she had a thing to read, too.  She read
palms an' all like that, too.  But she had a thing on 'er table
where she would read. . .she. . .At the same time when Elsie was in
this bad fix, ya know          an' ah, she had things. . .An'
she the one that told them that she couldn't cure Elsie.  See?
