BJ TAPE 20, p. 34

had a husband or a boyfriend or anything, an' I do something,
really bad, you know, with another man an' he fin' it out, I jus'
figure that right then the check is over -- with me .   Hit is over.
He can say, "Oh, I'll forgive you."    I say I, I'll never feel it.
Within me I don't feel like you gonna forgive me 'cause I would
always remember it with him.   An' I jus' said, "No, I didn'..."
Tha's all right.   Jus' let it go.  
TL:      You never did anything like that?
BJ:       No, no.   But I would do it.    Like I [say] see the young folks go back
together an' they done been caught with womens an' caught with
mens.   I don't see how they can make it.  You see?   There -- But
they can make it.   They done good; an' they is makin' it.   But I,
I don't tell 'em nothin' 'bout me, ya know?, about what I wouldn't
do.  But I know what I wouldn't do.   Hum, see, ha, ha, ha, I
jus' wouldn't do it.
            An' I would say to myself an I tells anybody:   I believe -- I dunno; I
[dunno] might be wrong -- I believe if I had a husban' or sumpin' like that an'
would git caught with another man, I don't think I'd wanna live.
Just look like maybe he gonna kill me.  An' so that why I never
would do nothin' like that.   Never had in my mind to do it!
            I want to treat a person like I want them to treat me.   Tha's
all.   I mean every where; goin' along anywhere, I want to treat
a person like I want them to treat me.   An' that was jus'...Tha's
why I tells peoples, don't go no further with me than I go with
them an' we make it.   'Cause I'm gonna treat them nice.   An' if
they do these things, an' had to do it, why, jus' go 'head on an'
don't let -- don't dis-disrecognize me.   Ya see?   So I ain't
never had that to [h?app] happen to me.
