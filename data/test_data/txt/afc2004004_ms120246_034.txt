she kisses the younger ones - 
same woman
Bon soin (r) mes dames de cette
socièté, moin même çé Aida Wêdo - 

they begin to sing Dumb songs,
& put D'o egg on the floor again - 
she stands and pats various people on
the breast - she came & went after
one or two minutes she went again - 

the chicken's throat was cut - the feathers 
pasted libation of water poured on
body as it lay in its blood & grace & 
misericorde asked for Fl & wife - 

Baron S. doesn't come often - he usually
sends Guêdê, if he comes he comes by
himself.

(8A2) song for Guêdê
vêrvê for Guêdê
