Dear Dr. English:

This is a follow-up of my letter to you
under date of March 5 replying to yours of February 26
touching certain data that is being sought by a Federal 
Agency.  You will find, along with this letter, 
a number of reactions.  These reactions were secured
in accord with the suggestions attached to your letter.

My procedure was to mimeograph the suggestions,
call a faculty meeting, discuss and distribute them --
so that we would be uniform in our approaches to get the
desired data.  What these suggestions cover, I am not
in position to say and I am not certain that the directions
 were followed in totol

With kindest personal regards to you, I am
Very truly yours, 
[Signature]

I am impressed once more 
with the institutional and geographical (?)
differences.  Without any tabulations I think
there is less filth & less bitterness in the 
South (Tuskegee).  Bluefield is intermediate
-there is more overt objection to Negro
status - an objection not glossed over by "humor".
