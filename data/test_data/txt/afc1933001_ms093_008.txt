Dear Sir:
I represent Mr. Elie Seigmeister who, in conjunction with Olin Downes, music critic of the New York Times, is preparing a new "Treasury of American Song." This book is to be published by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. in the fall. I understand that your publisher, the Macmillan Co., wrote to you on Mr. Seigmister's behalf for permission to use some of your songs in this new volume. This work is intended to be comprehensive and Mr. Seigmeister would be very pleased to receive your permission to include your songs.
Should you desire a credit line, and if you will include the form in which you wish it to be in in your answer, I can assure you that your wishes will be followed carefully.
Yours very truly,
Hefed Solol
