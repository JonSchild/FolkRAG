6. Instructor in a vocational training school - "I have a friend in Class
4F who has been sent to the induction center seven times, which means two or three
days each time, because his draft board has a quota to fill and he can count against
the quota whether he is accepted or not."
7. Young college professor - "One fellow I know in his endeavor to enlist
went through the physical examination several times. He passed a civilian physical
examination without any difficulty and went out to the induction center and was
examined, and because of the failure to observe sanitation in medical instruments
used, he acquired an ear infection which he now must wait to heal before he can 
enter the service."
8. Young professional man - "I just have been out at the induction center 
for my physical and they make no apparent effort to disinfect the medical instruments
they use, between examinations."
9. Head of WPA Information Center Project - "The librarian in ___________
is in my office very much disturbed because the local chairman of the USO has told
her that it is illegal to accumulate any information concerning the war effort, even
though the material is made up of official publications, and demanding that the
library destroy the material in its war information center."
10. A prominent Des Moines lawyer, once active in the Lindberg organization, 
is reported to have been circulating mimeographed copies of a letter from a relative
in an Army camp, who was apparently very homesick and at least intensely critical of
what he thought was mal-treatment he was receiving. We have been unable to obtain
a copy of the letter.
