Dear Mr. Lomax:

     As the deadline for Rosenwald Fellowship applications
passed (and since I had decided not to apply directly myself
but rather to depend upon your project), I did wonder whether
or not you had recommended me and if I had not "slept" somewhat 
in not having also applied myself. But please be assured
that I shall not blame you if our plans do not materialize; I 
am aware of certain "red tape."

     If the plan to have each fellow confine his work to one
county is accepted, I should think that a very thorough job can
be done in that way. I like the idea. There are still horses
and buggies (my earliest means of getting around in Mississippi).
A county could be covered in this manner -- and perhaps with better
effect than by means of the automobile. We can, of course,
decided very easily upon the particular county for my project.

     Please let me know the results as soon as you hear
from the Rosenwald people. With my thesis on Negro preaching
nearing completion and my degree forthcoming, indications are
that I shall soon want to make definite plans for work.

     Thank you for all of your kindness.

     Sincerely yours,
     W. H. Pipes
