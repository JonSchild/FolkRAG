Rationing
1.  People not in war work are getting tires.  I know a man who was first
     told by a local tire dealer that he could not get tires, then was
     called back a few days later, and told that there were now tires
     available and if he was willing to pay the price he could have 
     them.  (Real estate man.  10/7/42
2.  I know a man who accepted a temporary job in a State office just
     just long enough to get tires for his car.  (Clerk in private industry.

3.  A fellow I know who is in the insect control business, and who is
     not eligible to obtain tires.  However, he did obtain a set of used
     tires for the price of $150.  (Attorney.  10/8/42)
