that you can and will come.
If you will please address the desired information to 
Johana Harris c/o Richard Hocking - 68 South St Williamstown Mass
we shall be ever so grateful and I shall ask Doctor
Hocking to hold your letter until my next concert - 

There is only one man Prof. Roy Larison - who knows 
anything about your work, I mean the Folk idea - 
altho many know of you & your father & some of the many fine 
things you have done & are doing.
"Pride goeth before - etc - but I planned to fall anyhow - so here 
I go - I beamed inwardly last night when I learned inadvertantly 
that Leadbelly and the Golden Gaters have all found New Homes 
in His town where they'd been unknown - until brought by 
your faithful admirer and well-wisher - in Sincerety.
Johana Harris
P. S. Until word is received from you I shall allow any ones hopes to rise.
