(Mr. R): note here and one note here, and you tie'em together.
That's a slur. You slur up with your words. If you
tie them, you divide them in half of the length. For
instance, if I was to tie these two, I'd have two 1/2 notes
instead of two whole notes; or, they where 1/2 notes, and 
I tied 'em, ...if they were 1/4 notes and I tied 'em, I'd 
have two eighths. A tie is when two notes are tied together
on the same degree. Sometimes they'll be tied for two
measures. Well, then you sound your first syllable, and 
hold it through however many beats that you have.
Yes sir?

Man in Congregation: On a tie, when we were tieing say three
1/4 notes...they were 1/4 notes when we wrote 'em
but we tied 'em that 'come (?) eighths, do we have to
finish fillin' the measure then with some additional note
or a dot by one of the other notes. 

Mr. R.: That's right. Because all the measures are full of
whatever time it is.

Man: When we slur it we don't have to do that, but we we tie it
together, then we'll have to finish fillin' the measure...

Mr. R: If you're going to tie two quarters in four four time --
you tie two quarters, you have to tie two more quarters,
because they'd be all eighths then, see. Because you're
gonna keep the measures full. And then a triplet. When
you see a little figure 3 over three notes that are not
tied together, those three notes should be sung in the 
same length of time that it would take two. If it was
a triplet over three half notes, you'd sing the length of
two; three 1/4 notes, you'd sing the length of two. And in
