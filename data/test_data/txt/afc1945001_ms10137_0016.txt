1. There was a scene of battle on some foreign front. The battle
was very hot and every one was shooting and fighting but
one soldier, he was crawling along the ground. As he
was crawling a sargeant spotted him. He asked the
soldier what he was doing. He answered I'm going
to get in the thicket of the fight. The sargeant asked
why are you going that way. The soldier replied I just
trying to find a thicket to get in.
2. It was stated that a German correspondent reported to
the German people that the Americans had butchers
who had horse meat hanging in their shops but he
said we have them some we have butchers hanging
in ours.
3. I was in a store yesterday when a customer came in
and he told me he had a suspicion the butcher was
slipping him horse meat instead of his roast beef 
because when the butcher weighed it a jockey jumped
on the scale too.
4. I know how you can tell if a baby is going to be a soldier,
sailor, or marine. You place a boat and a army tank by
his side. If he grabs the boat he'll be a sailor if he grabs a 
army tank he'll be a soldier if he grabs the nurse
he'll be a marine. (over)
