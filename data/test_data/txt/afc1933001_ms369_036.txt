specially endowed person or persons, when the musical
giant of the nineteenth century could not write such melodies.
Therefore, we must conclude that the oral transmission,
perhaps the process of communal composition, at any rate
whichever one of these is the folk method ,
makes a positive artistic contribution
here---- even if it does nothing more than select/
out of the limbo of the past satisfying such/ tunes
that the great Brahms is jealous.

The same argument applies with equal force to the poetry of the
ballad. It is inimitable, as witnessed by the complete inability
of English poets from Shakespear on to write a good
ballad. This can be explained only in terms of the dichotomy we
have mentioned in connection with music--- the folk poet is
out for satisfaction, the self-conscious poet for
new effect,new ornament, downright imitation, originality, anything
so long as it be surely his. Let us
drop all arguments about the origin of folk ballads and songs;
let us admit the extremest position of the anit-communalist;
let us say that the illiterates have only picked up the crumbs
from the table of a tradition of art ballads. Even so ,
we must admit that their editorship has been so good that the
ballads resultant are better than Coleridge or any after
has been able to write.
