A Chicago Hero 

This is just one of the stories 
that Barney Ross told to the
Herald-American Newspaper about his
stay on Guadalcanal.  It was headed, 
"How I felt When I Killed My First Jap." 
There were four soldiers 
hunting one Jap.  Among them was 
Barney Ross.  He told how they all
surrounded him and gradually closed 
in on him.  It seemed that Ross was 
the closest to the Jap and could see
all of the Jap's actions.  Ross was 
carrying a Tommy Gun and slowly
ranged it to get range.  He fired ten
shots and the Jap went down. All four 
soldiers came out to examine him and
they found that eight of the ten shots 
got him.  When they asked Ross how he
felt he said, "I didn't even think 
about it, I just fired."
