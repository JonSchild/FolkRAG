Dear Alan,
     Well, the UCLA Festival has come and gone and I believe it
was as much of a success as could have been hoped for, assuming reason-
able expectations.  The crowds were large, orderly and enthusiastic
(we filled Royce, which seats 2200 four times); the lunatic fringe
did not picket or harrass us for having Pete (his first appearance at
UCLA) and the concerts, though invariably over-long, went with rea-
sonable smoothness.  Every old-timer there scored a personal triumph,
which was what pleased me most.  Bill Munroe led the very best work-
shop discussion.  Mance Lipscomb endeared himself to 
every blues picker in town by playing steadily from Friday night
to Sunday evening to anybody who wanted to hear him, sometimes back-
stage but mostly out on the University lawns where he was invariably
surrounded by fifty or more students.  I asked him if he wasn't get-
ting too tired and he told me he had come two thousand miles to see
these people and he didn't know if he'd ever see them again, so if
they wanted to hear him, he wanted to play for them -- that's what
he'd come for.  Then the Ashley group completely capped the whole
festival at the last concert by making Amazing Grace their last
number.  They sang it unaccompanied, quartet style, with that 
beautiful-ugly Doc Watson singing out the lead, standing there
looking far away into nothing with
Fred Price holding tight onto his arm and Clarence forgetting to take
his hat off till half way through; the whole of Royce sang with them
on the Amazing Grace verse, which they used as a chorus, and it was com-
pletely solemn and enormously moving.  I saw our brilliant 15 year
old neighbor boy who is already one of the great guitar pickers
technically, coming out with tears rolling down his face.  He told
a friend of ours that he just didn't want to hear any more music
after that.
     The intellectuals fared least well; Charley, Dr. Hand
and Archie Green all led discussions or read papers.  They did not
"tune in" well to the audience (which was a tough one for them)
and also were perhaps not properly presented.  There should
have been more meat to their menu, but it was difficult for anyone
to judge ahead of time.  Archie perhaps came off best but lack
of time kept him from developing his points properly.  Next time,
I think the folk-lorists should be presented in
a full-scale two or three hour discussion and encouraged to let loose
intellectually.  If half the crowd walks out, the half that stays
will have gotten something to chew over.
     Well, this is all by the way.  Concerning the Georgia
Sea Island group, in the first place, Bessie slipped in the snow
in Detroit and injured her knee.  She saw a doctor briefly who
bandaged it up; when she mentioned it very casually to me during the
Festival, it had swollen to double size and Emma told me Bessie was
sitting up all night rubbing liniment on it and taking a bottle of
aspirin a day.  My physical therapist friend, Boots Jones, swung into
action, got her to a physician Saturday who shot her full of codeine
so she could go on the show and bandaged her properly (she had an
elastic bandage shw was rolling up and down like a garter over this
horrible mess).  The doctor located the head of UCLA radiology in
