Rumor will come to be an accepted mode of communication
as certain condition prevail in the group.  We 
shall note the following.

a.  High degree of social interaction.  The greater
the amount of intercommunication in a group, the
greater will be the possibility of transmitting rumors.  
This alone, however, will not assure a widespread
rumor.

b. Intensity and homogeneity of wishes and fears.
The greater the intensity and commonality of emotions
in the group, the greater the homogeneity of
interests, and hence the greater the possibility of 
rumor serving to express common sentiments.

c.  Unsatisfied need for information.  This condition 
will prevail when the formal system of communication
fails to satisfy the group's need for information.
This may be due to (1) the inefficiency of
the formal system, (2) inaccessibility of fact, 
(3) distrust of formal communications, (4) censorship,
(5) heightened expectation of happenings, i.e., 
expectation of news or victories or defeats.

d.  Monotony, enforced inactivity, idleness.  Whenever
a group or any appreciable segment or it is
prevented from constructive activity and forced into
a monotonous drab way of life, rumors will become
rife.  Thus army camps, prisons, etc. are particularly
fertile breeding grounds for rumor.

VIII.  Under what condition will a rumor be widely disseminated?

A rumor will tend to be disseminated widely as it fulfills 
the following conditions.

a. As it assumes an optimal perceptual form.

b. As it is optimally fitting to the cultural standards 
of the group.

c. As it expresses sentiments common to the group,
and as these sentiments are intense.

d. As it supplies a pressing need for information.

e. As the formal system of communication aids in 
disseminating it.

f. As the social interaction of the group is maximal.
