Fisk, 17. 3.

Here Comes Two Gents from Holly Spring.

Here come two gents from Holly Sprin,
Has come to court your daughter, Jane,

My daughter, Jane, she is too young
To be controlled by anyone.

Let her be old,
Let her be young,
It is her duty,
And it must be done.

Go away, go away,
You sassy men,
And choose the fairest in the land.

The farest one that I can see
Will be Miss Millie.
Come walk with me.

Goodbye, Willie, goodbye.
Look in your pocket,
You'll find a locket,
Goodbye.

(Repeat, but this time Miss Rosie). 

My name is Ruby Harris. I learned this song in Gregory School about
25 years ago. The children were between 12 and 16. It is a courtship
game.

My name is Ruby Brown Hughes. I learned this song in Junior School 
about 20 years ago. The children were between 10 and 16.
