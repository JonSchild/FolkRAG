BJ TAPE 14,  p.  18

I cried up sumpin'!  I wanted the Lawd to let the child's eyes
grow back. An' when I looked at 'im, he just lookin' an' --
Eyes white, all in there, jus' as white.  He ain't hurtin' an'
he ain't cryin' an' he ain't flinch, ya know?  An' den I was
lookin'; I say, "He [  ] never will see."  I felt so sorry.
     I turnt my hand that way an' he wouldn't even pay it no
mind.  He couldn't see it. An' that's jus' hurt me. I cried an'. . .
So finally, when I was cryin' an' prayin',  I said, "God, do
sumpin' for 'im.  Please let 'im see."  I say, "He never will
see."
     Then my mind say, "He's young; he may grow out a it, ya know."
     An', Lawd, I looked back; his lil' eyes was changing'. The
color was comin' back.  An' I was so glad, I woke up!  Hah!  I
shouted an' woke up glad!
     Oow, boy, that was miserable, though.  I tuk them eyeballs
out!  I must see that. . .Oh, God. . .I won't be satisfied 'till I
hear from home, see if somebody got hurt or sumpin', you know?
Cut or sumpin'.
TL:  What does that mean?
BJ:  I don' know what it is.  I sure don't. [l] But I feel.  . .
TL:  You have a dream like that, you feel somebody somewhere
got hurt?
BJ:  Um.  Somewhere.  Um-hum, or sumpin'. I'm gonna see.
   Something, though. . .I'm tellin' ya. That thing got me. . .
           An' that ripe fruit, I believe that it's someone is, ah, is
goin' out.
TL:  What?
BJ:  I believe it's someone is goin' out.  You know, ripe fruit --
They say the Lawd pulls the fruit when it's ripe.
