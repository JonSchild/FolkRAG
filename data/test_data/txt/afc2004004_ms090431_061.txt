Fisk, 13.  9. STARK
'Twas noble brave, indeed."
Back lies there is the captain;
He's sinkin very fast
And turned away to hide his fear.
The gneral in that moment fell down by his side,
Then gave a cry that catched all hearts that day -- 
"You my son, my brave young heart."
I saw him say that moan.
"Give me, father, before you run away
And break the news to Mother.
She knows how 'tis: Ilove her.
And tell her not to wait for me;
I'm not going home.
She knows there is no ther
Can take the place of Mother.
And kiss her dear sweet lips for me
And break the news to Mother."

That was about 1914.  That was the song back from the Spanish-American 
War, too.
A:  What kind of a song would yu call it?
S:  I don't know; the subjest is Break the News to Mother.
A:  Was that a favor[t]ite song of yours?
S:  Yes.
A:  Why did you like it so much?
S:  Well, I liked it on on one account of a soldier --he run away from home.  His father thought he was at home; h[s]is father was 
a general and he had slippedoff in the war and he was the bravest one 
[o]in there after the flag was shot down and the captain asked who would 
save it.  And he went and saved it[, ???] but he got killed.  Then when the 
general come to see who it was, he found out 'twas his son and all he 
asked him to do was to break the news to Mother.
A:  Was he a Negro or a white man?
S:  I don' know (laughter).
