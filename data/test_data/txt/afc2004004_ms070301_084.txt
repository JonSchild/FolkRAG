Wake for drowned man 
Isn't it a great danger and
sorrow is over every one on this island

The wind has gone up now
+ there will come no curragh for
two or 3 days - [went]

There are strange things, say what
they will -

Beating coffin as they been -
been for a young man lost in the
first flush of his manhood -

We don't like it when we hear
a dog up on top of the rocks
looking up into the heavens +
they crying -

Its a great loneliness and sorrow
there is in the house now

Curaghs  going out to ghost ships
+ being lost
