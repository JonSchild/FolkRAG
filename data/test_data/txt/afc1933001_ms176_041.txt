Dear Mr. Lomax:

We have been in touch with Alan Lomax regarding an experiment we
are initiating for the production of one-reel short films based on American
Folk Songs.  He advises that you have copy-written "Grey Goose" in your
book, American Ballads and Folk Songs. 

The first film we are trying, deals with Tall Tales and is a
cooperative endeavor on the part of the production crew and ourselves in an
effort to stimulate interest in American folk songs, and in an attempt to 
find out whether there is a market to justify further production.  The first 
film, TALL TALES, present Joshua White singing "John Henry"; Winston O'Keefe
singing "Strawberry Roan", and Burl Ives singing "Grey Goose".

We haven't the slightest idea, as to whether the initial costs will
ever be retrieved.  We have all had fun making the first film which is ready
now, and which will be shown in one or two theaters perhaps, and will then be 
offered to schools, clubs, etc. 

The meagre budget did not include any figuring on royalties for 
use of songs because in our inexperience it was felt that the folk songs
chosen were in public domain. We don't know whether the version sung by
Burl is the same as your copy-written version of "Grey Goose".  But whether
it is or not, we appeal to you for permission to use the song "Grey Goose" in
our little firm.  In return we would like to present you with a 16mm sound file
copy of TALL TALES for your collection. 

It has been a month now that we have been trying to get reaction
from theatre owners in New York as to their interest in using the film.  We 
find it hard and difficult toad because the theatre owners have not developed
any appreciation of the nature and meaning of American folk music.  Our group
feels that if there is enough interest to help us defray costs we may make an
additional number of similar films.  But we also feel that even if the film
does not pay its way, at least we have made a worthy attempt to call attention
generally to our rich tradition of American folk songs.
