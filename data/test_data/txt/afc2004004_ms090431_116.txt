Fisk, 19.  5.

And he loves me.

Ask my Momma
For fifteen cents,
To see the elephant
Jump the fence.

Jump so high,
Touch the sky.
Never got back
Till the fourth of July.

Do I walk?
Do I talk?
Do I eat
With a knife and fork?

Comb my hair,
Break my comb.
I'm gonna come home
When I go home.

Corn bread rough,
Mealy bread rough.
B'live my Mommy
Gonna love that stuff.

Pease porridge hot,
Pease porridge cold
Pease porridge in the pot,
Nine days old.

Some like it hot,
Some like it cold,
Some like it in the pot,
Nine days old.

(Whole things repeats all over again).

Pullin' The Skiff.

Went downtown
To get my griff.
Come on home
Pulling that skiff.

I got you.
Don't keep it.
Um, Um, um, um.

My Momma, my Momma,
Don't like it
To pull that skiff.
I got the roll,
Ride that skiff.

I got you.
Don't keep it.
Um, um, um, um.

Oh, lady, oh, lady,
