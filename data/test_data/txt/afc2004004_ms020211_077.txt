Dear Mr. Lomax:

Enjoyed talking to you last week about our projected three week tour
for the Georgia Sea Island Singers.  As I understand our conversation,
the package would include Bessie Jones, five of the group and the
accompanist you mentioned, for a total of seven at a fee of $2,250.
per week.  I would need an option through June 15th covering a three-week
[playing] period beginning October 19th for this year.

We are principally interested in the area west from Chicago to Denver,
and south from Canada to Missouri.  We will probably confine our bookings
at this time to colleges and universities, five days a week and
up to seven concerts weekly.  Travel will be minimal as to mileage and
we will furnish transportation from Minneapolis throughout the tour and
return to Minneapolis.  However, at this fee we cannot possibly furnish
food or lodging, though we will help arrange both as someone from our
organization would travel with the group.

As soon as possible would you send us samples of your brochures, flyers,
photos, press releases, etc.? 

We are certainly interested in talking to you about bookings on a
national scale for a later time.  Is it possible that you might be in
this area in the near future?  Is so, we would like to arrange to get
together with you.

Sincerely,
[* Jim Lombard *] 
James S. Lombard, Jr.
