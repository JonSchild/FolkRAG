Little Jack Horner
Stood on a corner
Watching the pickets go by.
He thought, "I've been dumb,
To the union I'll come,
No more scabbing for me till I die."

See Saw, Majorie Daw
Madame's workers have asked her
"An increase in pay of a dollar a day
Without doing work any faster."

Jack and Jill 
Have had their fill
Of the company union fable.
On every gown
Made in their town
There's now a union label.
