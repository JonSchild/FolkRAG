Tape: Sacred Harp Interviews    11

app. 35 years and have been in the supervision ranks for,
I guess, 30 years. I really enjoy working for Seule,
they give me a lot of liberty where I can go around the country
and work in the Sacred Harp, which I love so much.

AL:   That's the way you get time to run this whole movement, 

Hugh:   That's right. I ship books from the office, Sacred
Harp books, all over the world, foreign countries as well as
all over the United States.   We also ship records, this is
the Social Harp record, made by a grant from the NEA, a 
book that had died out.   We print this book and we made a 
record of this book and sold a number of copies. This is a
directory of minutes of our singings each year.   We have.
We have over 700 days of scheduled singing in the south
each year.   And this is the proceeding of our singings.
It's what songs they led,

AL:   Read us a paragraph out of that,

Hugh:   For instance, it says here, the annual singing was
held at Fellowship Primitive Baptist Church and was called
to order by Lonnie Beard, leading #32.   After that, the morning
prayer was led by Ted Botchett.   And in the front of the book,
it tells you where the singings are, like the first Sunday
in August, Calvary Immortal nearRhine Creek Baptist Church, 
20 miles SW of Cullen, AL and 5 miles north of Highway 69 at
Bremen, AL.
