BJ TAPE 43, p. 31

'em about the peoples, said whatever that she, he did -- He
did just what she [told 'im] said.  Said, "Let every one a these
peoples here go free; if they wanta leave you,"  said, "Let 'em
leave you. [Cause] They they don't owe you nothin'."  An' every han' on
that place, every year set off with two, three hundred
dollars.  I don't care how much they farmed, or how much cotton
they made.  I tol' ya about I met Boise down in, in Fladah?
That wa' same man he wa' with.  Boise wit' 'im for 20 years.
Never got out a debt.  An' Boise left the same time.  That the
same time Boise walked away.  "Every one of 'em."  Said, "None
of 'em owe ya nothin'.  If they wanna stay, let 'em stay; if
they wanna leave, let 'em go."  She told her father that.
AL:  And he did it?
BJ:  And he did it.  He didn' tell 'em; just left it up, up to
them.  An' _________ was out.  See, white an' colored.  'Cause
Abe, he, he was the cook.  An' the colored womens, you know, what
was maids -- Oh, he had everything to the house, they needed.
Butler; cook; they could hitch up, drive, whatcha call the thing?
chauffeur?; anything, he wanted; everything he wanted.
     An' den, den, den they go in that house an' dey, an' they
eat.  He feed everyone on that place!  Don't care what they
doin'.  Don't, don't be hongry.  They jus' don't have no money;
don't have nothin' to buy with when they go away (?), see?  He
feed ya; sho' did.  Never, never did find nobody's parents,
ya know, when, on, on the Dickson Place.  His name was Marion
Dickson.  An' that girl so well.  (?)  I guess he been dead for
years, I reckon, now.
     But that, I'm sure -- His, his daughter was, was rich an'
she sho' tol' 'im ta meet her in sweet Beulah Land.  Wherever
that is; don't know where it's at, but that what she tol' 'em.
