"I get more sugar now than I ever had before and the grocers say they
have plenty of it. I don't think rationing is necessary. I got 16
pounds of sugar at one time, using our rationing cards, and that is
more sugar than I ever bought before in my life. I got it just because
I could." (Housewife, Birmingham, 8/6.42.) [*1*]
