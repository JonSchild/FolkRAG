Role 45, Hicks p.3

chestnut tree in the yard, knocked it up into stove wood, and then
knocked the stove wood into the fireplace and knocked it right
into the fire! Great goodness, Jack is standin' there watchin' and 
said, "Yeah, it works, I could see! That beats anything I ever see
Thank you old man! I'm goin' home and..." said "Jack, now don't
stop at those fellers, those bad boy's house...don't you stop there
Jack said "I won't this time, I'll sneak around their house, thru
the woods." Jack got down there, and the boys saw him, and started
pestering him again, about why he was carrying that old dumb lookin
club under his arm.
