Strayhorn Mob

One of the men that was in it, writ it all down 
& told me to make up a song.  One of the white
men, Mr. Sam House. I played it for him a
many a time. He liked it too good.

You know Mr. Norman Clayton. He was in 
it. He pitched me 50 cents & walk off [& tell]
[me to play it & walk] off & by the time I play
 4 or 5 verses, he gone - He'd laugh & go on 
& leave us & his daughter's the same way.

A: Who was the man they got?
H: Lemme see, now, I forgot. ? [[same tune]] 
Them boys around [town] Strayhorn, they didn't have a job,
went to Senatoby & had a big mob,
Laid him low, laid him low
--
They went around to the jailhouse
"Jailer, we want the key,"
Say, "O boys, if you get the key,
Well, you have to murder me."
We'll lay you low.
--
Some walked around the jailhouse
[They] Stopped in at the gate
Some of um made a shot
Wid a thirty eight 
they laid him low
