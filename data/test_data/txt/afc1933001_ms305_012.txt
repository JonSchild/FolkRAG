[?ADE] OLD RECORDING
[?any] a man and woman in the
[?United States] knows the old Irish
[?Band] of "Barney McCoy" and his
[?hing] farewell to his sweetheart
[?e] left Ireland for the new country.

[?Most] of them know it, however,
[?] Uncle Alec Dunford's own version,
minus "that thar classic
[?ng]" it has acquired in the New
[?York] music halls before it came to
[?Uncle] Alec.

Dr. W. P. Davis, Galax physician, (pictured above with his wife and his auto-harp) sets as sort of
manager for the "Bog Trotters." Though he loves the mountain music of the section in which he was
raised, Dr. Davis says he doesn't play music with the "Bog Trotters" - just goes along to keep 'em on key.
He has been playing the auto-harp for a long time, and when he struck up a friendship with Uncle Alec
Dunford a number of years ago, the two began to play the old tunes together.

Uncle Davy Crockett Ward
(seated above) has many a night
played his fiddle while his wife
(standing beside him) sang the
old ballads of the mountains
Uncle Crockett is a huge man
broad of shoulder, but his big
hands and blunt fingers can bring
fine music out of the fiddle. He
plays second fiddle with the "Bog
Trotters." Mrs. Ward doesn't sing
with the group now-a-days quite
so often as she used to, but she
knows scores of the old songs with
which many a family frolic has
been regaled.

LOCALE AND TIME
BASIS FOR NAME

Ballard Creek Bog Trotters
Just Got Together

The wall of a pair of fiddle[?]
scraping together on "Sugar Hil[?]
and "Fall on Your Knees," with[?]
a woman's voice singing clear the[?]
words of the old songs, comes from
the little board house on the banks
of Ballard creek in the mountains
of Southwestern Virginia.
The fiddlers are Uncle Alec Dunford
from up the road half a mile
and Davey Crockett Ward, and the
time was 15 years or more ag[?]
Next Tuesday the pair of old
timers will put their "Bog Trotters"
on the air for thousands of listeners
to Columbia's American
SChool of the Air (WDBJ-CBS[?]
9:15-9:45 a. m., eastern standard
time).
Just Got Together
That evening was just like many
another winter evening of those
years, not long after Uncle Alec
had moved down on Ballard creek
Uncle Alec was a fiddler and
Crockett Ward was a fiddler, and
when the new neighbors got together
they found they had learned
a good many of the same old tunes.
Crockett Ward's wife was one of
the best ballad singers in the
country, and his brother, Wad[?]
could strum a banjo, and his so[?]
Fields, was learning a new-fangled
guitar.
Everybody could play or sing [?]
tell some of the old tales, for whe[?]
the family gathered around the
stove on those winter evening[?]
everybody contributed something
