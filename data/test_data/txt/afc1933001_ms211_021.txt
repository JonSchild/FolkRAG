recordings were made in all cases. The disks and needles you will be
using this time are going to make a lot of difference in the quality
of the records you can make.

I have one town in Kentucky which I suggest you visit - Salyersville,
about a hundred miles south of Ashland. The best banjo player
I ever heard and one of the best mountain singers lives there. His
name is Walter Williams. Another singer there of great interest is
Clay Walters. I can give you other names if you decide to go. It
seems a great shame not to keep closely in touch with such a remarkable
person as Roscoe MacLean, and not to make some additional recordings
of his voice. On your way through Louisiana, if you come
that way, why not try to run down the story of the Batson affair. It
is one of the most interesting of American ballads and about which
even Gordon has practically no information. I can give you some good
names in N w Orleans, too, of early jazz musicians who know folksongs
and jazz tunes which were not written down. Elizabeth's uncle lives
in a little town in the no-man's-land on the Texas edge of Louisiana.
Elizabeth says that he has a natural amateur's interest in folksongs
and knows all the fiddlers and singers of that section, and he could
probably lead you to very good material. All of which, in addition to
contacts you have, sounds like a good month and a half of work. I
hope you can arrange this trip to stay in prison camps longer than you
have hitherto been able, and don't forget Bowlegs, for Heaven's sake,
he is one of the great and when he gets out of Parchman will be lost
to us forever.

About the great Lake songs, I know Mr. Walton quite well and last
summer recorded a number of his songs in Michigan. I think I can get
permission for us to use four or five of them and I shall pick these
out in the process of looking at the records.

Mrs. Seeger and I are going to spend all this afternoon and as
much time as we can get to in the next few days on the ballad book.

Please let me know as soon as you can about the loan.

Love,


AL a

P. S.  I shall get copyright on the two cowboy songs looked up this
afternoon.
