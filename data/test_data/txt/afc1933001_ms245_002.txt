Dear Alan:  Thank you for your suggestion
about the Dallas News radio
engineers. I'll [?] 'em before tryi
any more recordings. I'm going
over to the stock yards in Ft Worth
to record the calls the men use in
handling cattle. Also I have a
dance caller and fiddler located
near Dallas who I will try and
before I go journeying. I had a
good many unfinished plans on
the fire before Mr. Spivacke's
authorization finally came. Now
I am waiting to hear from Mrs.
Tartt before descending on her.
She was sick when she wrote
the last letter.
