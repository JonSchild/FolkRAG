Letter to Mr. Engel from
Prof. John A. Lomax

Mr. Lomax, under date of June 7, has written to me from Crowley,
La. After an account of his latest trips and trials, he says:

"On July 5 I am to be married . . . Having a home once 
more for my dear little daughter and Alan raises the question 
of where it would be best to live. In case support
can be continued for the collection of folk songs and in
case you are satisfied with my work, would you prefer that
I live in Washington or say in Austin, Texas, at the University? 
Wherever this home is, I as a field worker must stay
in the field. So long as I am in the field Texas is nearer
to more folk songs than is Washington. In this connection I
should also like for you to consider my appointment as Archivist 
rather than merely as an Honorary. If this is not the
proper time to bring up such matters or should you prefer for
any other reason not to discuss them, please pass up this section 
of my letter."

There would seem to be good reason why the question raised by Mr.
Lomax should now be brought to your attention rather than at some later
time. Proper arrangements, looking toward to the future of our folk song
archive, should be made at as early a time as possible.

Mr. Lomax stresses the point that he is primarily a "field worker."
As such his work unquestionably is of value. But we need someone, resident 
in Washington, to administer the archive. If Mr. Lomax (whose heart
is evidently with the University of Austin) should not care to live here,
he might still be considered for the position of Archivist, provided an
able assistant, permanently in residence here, would attend to the administrative 
details.

There is one consideration, however, which we should bear in mind:
with Mr. Lomax's avowed preference for field work and with his obvious
inclination to restrict his work to the Southern states, he would not be
in a position to direct the work of the Archive such as we have conceived
it. There should be someone in charge of the whole enterprise who will
not only attend to the necessary correspondence from here, but who will
be able to direct other workers in other regions than those covered by
Mr. Lomax, so that the entire country may eventually be canvassed.

Only with some such comprehensive plan should we go gunning for more
and larger funds.
