Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thanks for your January 12 note.

First, the things we can't do: Columbia can't give us
an open wire, and wants only two switches, which means
you will go on at 2:10-2:15 and again at 2:20-2:25. You
can break up your material as you think best in terms of 
the questions in my letter of December 24.

Frederick will not be in town until Friday, so at this
writing, I can't give you what he will say, but we want you
to plan your show in terms of your own material, and he will
bring his material into line. 

In general, the program will follow this pattern: Frederick
will introduce you; you will talk from 2:10-15; he will comment
on yours and the other song books mentioned in my previous letter;
you will talk from 2:20-25; and he will then tie up the whole
business, including the "significance." Does this explain
his second appearance?

Since there will be only two switches, naturally you won't
open with theme, although I'd like to have had it that way.
We will headline you, however, at the very first, and would
like to have you tell us exactly what to say --- or finish this 
sentence: "Of Men and Books, with John T. Frederick of Northwestern
University, and his guest, Alan Lomax___________________"

Yours sincerely,

Parker Wheatley
Radio Director
