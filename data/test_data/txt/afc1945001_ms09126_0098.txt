Is Hitler Dead?

I Every one has some thing 
on his mind about this 
war, and it is about Hitler
We want to know whether 
he is dead or alive.
In Germany the people claim
they have not seen him in 
months.
A news commentator said
the other day that he does
not believe that he is dead,
but just hiding away in the
home he has built
in the hills.
He also said he hoped
that he wasn't because
the people there may just
give in this want for
peace, and strike again
later, and that it's not what
the allied nations want;
they want this to be the
end of war between countries
for ever.
And if Hitler is still alive
and running  his people he
may never give up until
defeated.

Rumors

II The Germans have claimed 
that Americans are fools, and
are very slow about doing every
thing
