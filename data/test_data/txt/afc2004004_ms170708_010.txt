Harry farming
I was bred & born at Barton Tower. That's where I
served all my young days. Then we moved about
to different parts. I grew up, big enough to do a little.
Then I began my line o' life, ... followed my father's
footsteps, got so I could do anything at all.
In particular, I went in for stock-feeding. I took
delight in feeding the cattle. I fed for thirty years
or more. Sometimes I done seven months at a stretch,
Sundays & all. No rest, never had a holiday.
Nowhere to go. All I used to do then of a night
when I got home, I used to git around the old
fire & music the time away, have a song or two to
pass the time away & cheer yourself up. [*Then the next job would come along, the hoeing to do.*] We were
happy enough. Get into a gang, gallon or two o' beer,
& so we used to go on, happy as the birds in the woods.
[When you got through, then you know] We'd jog along
through that part of the year, & then you'd know the
next job was coming. You'd want to get your scythe
ready. There'd be the hay & the corn, moving all day
long from half past five in the morning and eight
of night. Used to be all the wheat by hand. I used
to take a delight in it, that I did. Got 'bout 16
shillings the acre, more if you tied it & stood it up.
Anyway, I kept knocking along one way & another. 
I took delight in the job; so I do now. I like
mowing. I like an old scythe, I'm as happy as
anything when I get an old scythe. Or tying
up faggots. I take delight in anything where a
hook is concerned, an' choppin' & cuttin'.
