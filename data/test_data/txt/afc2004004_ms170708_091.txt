Cox: Oh. . .
Lomax: I'd love to record that, Peter.
Kennedy: Oh, I've got lots of that.
Lomax: From this part?
Kennedy: No. Dorset.
Lomax: Well, let's hear it from here. Don't you think we should?
Cox: I don't know whether I know all o' it.
Kennedy: Beat the drums slowly. . .
Cox: I don't think - I don't believe I know it all really proper.
Lomax: How does the tune of that go?
Cox: 
As I was a-walking down by the Royal Albert,
Dark was the night and cold was the day.
Who should I meet but one of my shipmates,
Wrapped in a blanket far colder than clay.
Like that.
Lomax: Yeah. Peter, let's just take down the tune. Do you mind?
Kennedy: No.
Lomax: I don't know - do you have this tune?
Kennedy: Yes, I do. . .
Lomax: I've never heard this tune.
Kennedy: It's a grand song, Alan.
Lomax: Just give as much as you can remember.
Cox: I dare say I know all of it.
As I was a-walking down by the Royal Albert,
Dark was the night and cold was the day.
