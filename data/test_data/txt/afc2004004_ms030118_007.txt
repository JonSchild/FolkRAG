I'm not sayin cause I'm colored, but if any
white woman gits a colored man, I'm tellin you right now, a white
man don't have a possible chance.
(why is that, Reverend Davis?)
Well, it's natchul that a colored man can do a
white woman mo good than a white man can.
(why is that?)
Well. . . It's jes that way, I reckon.
(You think that colored men are more powerful sexually
than white men are?)
(Matter-of-factly) Yeah. They is. . . You see, a colored
man an a white man ain't natured up alike. See, it don't take a
white man but jes a few minutes of anything. An it take a colored
man mo than that . . . You can't turn a colored man off. You got to 
carry him some. Least they do me. I don't know what about nobody
else.
(Well, you told me that there are differences among
woman; you know that because you've made love to many women.)
Yeah. They're different, but you nevah heah me say so 
much about it, cause as long as a man got to go to a woman fur
sumpin he got to keep his mouth shut. (he laughs) If I git holt of
a woman, an she don't satisfy me, you still don't heah me say nothin.
If I git a-holt of sumpin that satisfy me, I still ain't gon say
nothin. (he laughts) No, heah the thing about it. If you put yo'sef
wid me, you understan, I can't talk about you widout talkin bout mysef.
Thass got to be closely kep. You know it? Lot of men gits out on the
corner jes from the habit of talk. "Man, I had sumpin good las night. 
Boy, I enjoyed mysef. You oughta been wid me las night." . . . I don't
play no kind of game like that. Don't play no kind of stuff like that.
