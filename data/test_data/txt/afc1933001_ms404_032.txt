Next [he] the leader prayed this prayer: 
See insert A2

"you know whether you are to eat the 
body and drink the [body] blood of the Christ 
If you eat and drink the Lord's truth unworthily you
eat and drink to your damnation 
Somebody sitting in  
a pew will never sit 
here again"
continues  the leader as he distributed small 
crumbs of the bread such as the man had eaten
 for supper. The "wine" was grapefruit
juice from the prison commissary. 

When the sacrament was concluded
for the first time Reverend
Sin Killer stepped forward impressively dignified and solemn, and began
"My dear brothers and sisters, [and] sinner 
friends" (only one woman, the Captains
wife,[)] was present). He spoke in 
blank verse: 
The ear hears  the voice
and notify the eye where to look 
One day as I was walking along 
I heard a little whisper but I saw no one.
Something was bringin' about a disturbment 
What was the wind.
