The Present War has caused a
great deal of suffering, pain, & famine.
Why & What are the main great causes 
of this War? First of all there is lack
of clothing, shoes, foods and patriotism.
Clothing is lacking because so many
people hoarded them. Shoes are also
lacking for the same reasons. Foods
are ration because of "Need for Feeding
Hungry Soldiers," and last of all patriotism
is lacking because of so many rumors.
Rumors should be kept to oneself, not
spread around so to cause confusions.
Why has this War caused pain? Because
of the great ordeal of seeing our, sons, 
fathers, Uncles, Cousins, brothers, 
husbands & sweethearts taken away
for the first time. Faminine, I should
not have mention, because there is not
so much faminine here in our country.
"America". Let us all pray for peace, 
happiness & security, and I'm sure we
will get it. Don't You?????
