1640  B (Cont.)

I was then placed under a teacher at the St. Joseph University, 
a Catholic university in the city of New Orleans, and I become 
to learn under the Catholic tutleage, which was quite efficient, and then later taken lessons 
from a known professor, colored [called] professor, named Professor 
Nickenson [Nicholson}, which was considered very good.
I tell you, things was driving along [on] then. Then, one day at 
the French opera house, going there with my folks, I happened 
to notice a pianist there that didn't wear long hair. That 
was the first time I decided that the instrument was good for a 
gentleman [the] same as it was for a lady. I don't remember 
his name, but undoubtedly I must have been ten years old. I 
don't remember his name. That was no doubt about the year of 1895.
Question:  Was he from France?
Morton:  Well, he supposed to be. All the French 
opera players was supposed to be from France. I remember the 
old building very well on Royal St.
Question:  Do you remember any of the stuff the pianists 
used to play in the French opera houses.
Morton:  Well, they used to play numbers like "Faust", and 
tunes like that, you know, the French numbers, and for instance, 
they used to play this number and sing it.   (Piano)
Question:  Did they play any Debussy?
Morton:  Well, I don't remember.
