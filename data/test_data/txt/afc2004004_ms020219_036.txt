[it].  I don't like it, period.  An' so, if I can't make it --
You can't make it in peace, you can't make it in convusion.
Tha's what I always thought.   An' so I know cussin' will bring
on confusion.   A whole lot a cussin'.   "Oh, you kiss...Oh, you
this-that-and-the other," you know.   Don' all them nasty things.
I think it's so sloppy, you know, that you cain't enjoy yourself.
You can git with a crowd and enjoy, laugh an' talk an' sing an'
tell big jokes, [an'] stories, an' one git too knocked out let 'im
go to sleep.   Tha's all.   An' then, if he can't stand to get
knocked out an' go to sleep, put 'im, jus' put 'im a car or
sumpin' or other an' git 'im home quietly.  An', an', you
know, don't, don't throw 'em away.
         An' so that's the way I liketed when I was havin' a good
time.   But I really did have one.   I'm tellin' ya, I sho' did.
Never been in jail since Christ made Adam.   Ya see?   Hah, God
made Adam, however.   Never have.   I'd done enough to been on the
chain gang.   Because I sold moonshine, ha, ha, ha, ha!
         But I realized this:  You don't get 'rested for what you
do.   You know that, dontcha?   You don', you don't get arrested
for what ya do.   There'd a-many folks be in jail now, I suppose,
I daresay.   You get 'rested for what you caught doing.   See?
An' the same thing is by your sins.   You git forgiven for your
sins when Jesus come for you an' you are forgiven; all the things
ya done done, you don' get punished for that, see?   Hit what he
find ya doin', ya see?    At, at that time.   You cleaned up from
them, ya see?   You don't get 'rested fer bein' nasty, ah, a 
while back.   You done bathed when I got here an' cleaned.  [An'] You done
cleaned up.   You ready for me, I, I, I'm able to take it.   Ya
see?   But you're filthy, why tha's it.   Tha's another thing.
