Dear Alan:

Thanks no end for the exciting outline you sent of
the folk elements in the proposed School of the Air
programs for this fall and winter.  We are having
the outlines read by the proper persons as fast as
possible, and I am sure we will proceed to engage
you on a formal basis within the next few days.
Your duties will be to prepare the material in the
manual, to consult with the continuity writer and
to provide him with material, to appear as commentator
on the broadcasts and to sing on such
occasions as we shall agree on.

Best regards.  You will be hearing again soon.

Yours very truly,
Dave
Davidson Taylor
