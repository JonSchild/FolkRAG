Who Build The Ark

Chorus:

Tell me, who build the ark?
Norah, Norah.
Who build the ark?
Norah, Norah. 
Who build the ark?
Norah build it, 
He cut his timber down. 

1. 
Well, the first thing Brother Norah done, 
He cut his timber down, 
And the second thing Brother Norah done, 
He hewed his timber around.    (Chorus)

2. 
Well, the folks called Norah a foolish man;
He build his ark on a high, dry land.    (Chorus)

3. 
Well, God told Norah what to do:
"Ya cut your timber down;"
And God told Norah how to do, 
And he hewed his timber around.    (Chorus)

4.
God spoke to Norah; Norah understand:
"Put your ark on a high, dry land."     (Chorus)

5. 
When God spoke to Norah what to do:
Lord, "Just carry in the animals two by two."
Norah obeyed every thing God say
And all of his family was saved that day.    (Chorus)
