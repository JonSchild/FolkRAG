Dear Bill:

I hope you heard the afternoon show which was one of the best
out of the forty we have produced so far. I am afraid that the morning
show suffered from my not having ever rehearsed it with the cast before
we went on the air. Clint did not get much of a performance out of his
work with the boys and we were all very sleepy. The White House show came
off well.

Just to clear our slates:- The Golden Gate and Joshua White
were on CBS expense accounts on Tuesday and I have told them that was our
understanding. Joshua White has all along been scheduled for an appearance
on this spiritual show and he did a very nice job. Reimbursement expected.

I think that Pete Seegar of the Burl Ives, the Golden Gate, and
myself could, with one fiddler, put on a very respectable show for the Latin
Americans on March 1. I should also very much like to have Pete Johnson
and a thirty piece combination to include Sidney Bechet, to be located through
RCA Victor, perhaps.

I am in process of composing a long letter to you and Dave
about BWICF, somewhat of a diatribe and jeremiad. Until then

All hail,

Alan Lomax
