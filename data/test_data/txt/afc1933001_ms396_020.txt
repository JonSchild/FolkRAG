[When I was a small boy living on the Old Chisholm Cattle
Trail which ran through Bosque Country in Texas, my hero was a
singing cowboy named Bob Hanna.] Early in the spring of the year
Bob would drift to the Abilene country farther west to help through the breeding season
and in the big round-ups; then he would follow a herd of [several
cows and] longhorn steers from Texas to Dodge City, Kansas,

inch or so taller than those of his companions, the tops more
elaborately decorated with colored thread sewn into graceful
figures in front of and on the side just below his boot straps. He wore bells
on his spurs which he rarely took off, jingling to the time of
some cowboy song he usually was whistling or singing. All his
clothing was new -- heavy light-colored trousers, a figured flannel
shirt, around his neck a bright colored silk handkerchief. [As
a crown] [o]On his head rested a broad-brimmed "John B." white h[o]at,
so heavy that it would not blow off as he dashed about on his
pony. His saddle, bridle and martingale always were the finest
that money could buy, silver-mounted, stamped with intricate
designs and kept beautifully polished. He made a gay figure of
a man, youthful, athletic, always ready with a story or a song,
a knight of the golden west in its golden cattle days.
