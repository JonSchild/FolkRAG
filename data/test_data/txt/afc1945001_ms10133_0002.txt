My dear Dr. English:

Today I am sending you approximately 100 papers written by students in response to our call for stories about the war. I conducted the experiment in exact accord with the instructions that you sent me. I had hope to get many more for you, but I have been working under heavy pressure of committee duties along with regular teaching assignments and, therefore, could not devote the necessary time to the additional gathering of the responses.

I hope that our contribution will be of value to the research project. We will be glad to help in any other project whenever we can.

Sincerely,
Leonora Carrington Lane
