Richmond, Va.

Dear Mrs. Buchanan:

The proper acknowledgments have been made and are now in
our new book. I've never been to one of the White Top Festivals
and I should like to come for my own edification and
for the purpose of recording the whole festival for the Library
of Congress. As you doubtless know, material recorded at such
a time under your sponsorship can be restricted. I should like
to know how you and your committee would feel about this before
I apply to the library for permission to come.
  
With sincerest best wishes, I am,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
