1. "A slip of the lip will sink a ship."
2. A husband, on his wedding night, stood and
watched his beautiful new wife gradually
turn to beat-up old hag right in front of
his eyes, for everything she had was bought
at a 5 and 10 cent store, false hair, teeth,
fingernails, makeup, and everything else.
He was so disappointed, he went over and
got in bed without saying a word to her.
Later, she climbed in beside him and waited
for something to happen, but nothing did.
Finally she asked, "Honey, what's wrong?
Why aren't you doing anything?" He turned
to face her and said, "Baby, you don't have
anything on me. I got it shot off at Pearl Harbor."
3. A book written at the beginning of the
war was named "The Ruptured Chinaman" and
was written by Two Balls Hang Low.
4. Another book was The Chinese Mystery-
Spot on the Wall by Who Slung Shit.
