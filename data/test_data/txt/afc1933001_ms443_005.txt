Himes goes and tells Warden
Long the 'rangements him and Governor O.K. Allen done made----- 

And the Honorable Mr. Himes says to Honorable Warden / Long,

When I looked in the Shreveport Times - was our paper
out of Shreveport, Lou'siana---- the first number I saw was
three hundred and twenty-five----- 

I looked in the paper[*.*] then I was surprised
When I saw the number three hundred and twenty-five.
I begin to think bout the woman I had left behind in Shreveport,
Lou'siana---- 
I know my wife gonna jump and shout, 
When the train rolls up an' I come steppin' out. 
I begin to praise Governor O.K. Allen for the kindness he had done--
He hadn't turned me loose--- but I b'lieve when he heard this song
he gonna turn me loose-----
Governor O.K. Allen, 'member(you) the rest of my life,
He studied up a plan to send so many men to they wives.
