Dear Jay:

Your letter of June 29th is quite correct. Ertegun insisted that
they have the copyrights on all those songs in the Atlantic albums
I did.

I wish to God you people had them because they never accounted for
the royalties to the singers/authors. Many things have gone wrong.

Is there anything you can do to get these valuable copyrights from
Hill & Range Songs, Inc.?

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
