Praise to God and I'll preach with you.  Lord if I go, tell me
what to say, for they won't believe on me./   When I started out

I am the way,'  so I contented in trying to pray./   Jesus says if
you'll go (etc.). . . ./   My hands were tied and my feet were bound,
(unint.) the Lord come down/   Voice I heard it sound so sweet, the
blood run down to the sole of my feet/   Jesus says if you'll (etc.). ./

me/  'I am He you seek to find, I am He turned the water to wine!'
/  Jesus says if you'll (etc.). . ./   'Go tell the people what I have
done, spared their life with the sake of my Son.  Get their feet
out from (unint) clay, place them on the King's Highway/  (refrain)/
The King's Highway is high and straight, the gang's(?) all a waitin'
at the Pearly Gate/   They will come and carry you home, (unint)/
(refrain)/   Holiness is the King's command, whole to God's unchanging

sin-sick soul/   (refrain)/   I want my people be wise and bold, be
like a Me (?) at 12 years old/   I was in the temple with the great
wise men, makin' known (unint) heavenly yen(?)/  (refrain)"
