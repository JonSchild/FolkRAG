Dear Alan:

I have been in touch with Miss Barnicle and find
that she has something over eighty double-sided,
ten-inch records of Kentucky material, about a
dozen of which are at present unsatisfactory because 
of variations in speed of the recording motor.
Some of this dozen, however, represent the sort of
thing which is hardest of all to come by, and I
hope to be able to make good dubbings by using a
motor which can be slowed up to compensate for
the original variations - though this is not certain.

Inasmuch as the record should be played through before
dubbing, in order to make a check in variations in
volume, etc., I estimate about twenty minutes to the
disc. I am willing to do this at seventy-five cents
a record, the blanks to be supplied by The Library.

It makes no difference to me whether this is done at
slow speed on seventeen inch blanks, or at standard
speed on ten inch blanks. On the larger discs, the
cost would, of course, be thirty-seven and a half cents
for each ten inch side dubbed. I think, though, it
would be wiser to stick to 78 RPM, because the loss of
highs after repeated playings would be accentuated by
slow speed.

I believe we can deliver a minimum of twenty discs a
week, assuming there are no hitches about getting the
originals fast enough, and Barnicle is sure there would
not be. I could begin at any time, thought I should
like a week to study the records in order to find
out whether any sort of equalization is advisable.

    Sincerely yours,
    Charles G. Rith
