   The first results of my travels (up till today I estimate
a total of 250,000 miles) was embodied in a volume of 400 pages, 
published in 1910 and under the title of Cowboy Songs and Other
Frontier Ballads.  No leading publisher wanted the book.  It was 
finally brought out by a small publishing house long since defunct.  
The book immediately attracted some attention in the cultural centers 
of the East, in England, and in France.  At home and throughout 
the Southwest I was only laughed at because of my attempts to preserve this crude literary product of the West.  The candidate for 
governor of Texas attacked the University of Texas in speeches 
throughout the state for keeping on its rolls a man who was so silly 
as to sponsor a book as valueless as a collection of cowboy songs.
   Some years ago the Macmillan Company secured the publishing 
rights on Cowboy Songs.  The book has had a steady though small sale
for twenty-five years.  It happened to be the first collection of 
native American folk songs, except perhaps some local pamphlets, and 
the first edition has therefore acquired value for collectors.  In 
1919 I published a second collection entitled Songs of the Cow Camp
and Cattle Trail.  In addition to being fond of singing songs about 
their lives the cowboys also found pleasure in memorizing and reciting 
rough verses describing the adventurous side of the cattle business. 
Sometimes such songs were set to a simple tune.  I was able to find 
authors for about half of the examples presented in the Songs of the 
Cattle Trail.
