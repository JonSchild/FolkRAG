3rd R. of 10/12/61, P. 23, Song 1, Cont. 

'Cause my life was very bad, 
My heart was very sad
But now I'm so glad
That the the Lawd has followed me. 
You know, I cannot hide from God, 
You see, the Lawd followed me, 
And there's no need to try
'Cause the Lawd has followed me. 
Now I'm livin' this holy life, 
Free from sinnin' and strife
And I'm walkin' in the light
'Cause the Lawd has followed me. 
I'm glad He followed me, 
Lawd, so glad He followed me, 
I'm glad he 
And he follows me. 
'Cause my life was very bad, 
My heart was very sad
But now I'm so glad
'Cause the Lawd has followed me.
