6) It's Birnei's toon's a cold black hole,
It's nae like my father's home ava,
They'll work and work at double strength,
And that does grieve me worst of all.
7) Its Birnie's milk it's by the pint,
And Burnie's meal, it is bit raw,
And if ye dinna boil the bread
For brose ye willna sup at all!
8) When I have broke the steed in hand,
To work my wark for pennr fee,
I'll takethe gate and the road that I have come
And a better bairnie I will be.

The Moss O' Borrowdale: Jimmy McBeath.
1) Have ye ever seen a tinkers' camp upon a summer's night,
And                              a market when all things going right?
When all the tramps and hawkers they come frae hill and dale
Tae gather in the gloaming in the moss o' Borrowdale.
Chorus:
2 And the ale was only tuppence and                    bob a gill,
And we all forgot our troubles over a pottie o'small ale,
When we gathered in the gloaming in the moss o' Borrowdale.
2) Noo Jock Shaw would hae a fecht, and tore his jacket up,
Mixt squeaking and squawking we all go sick o' that,
Owre and among the filly pans or a wee bit iron pail,
And escaped him like a squad in the Moss O' Borrowdale.
3) Noo little Jimmy Dogherty, a horseman great was he,
He jumped on a Shelty's back, some tricks to let uss see,
A gallant shoved some prickly quins beneath the shelty's tail,
He cast a shot in a mossy pot in the Moss O' Borrowdale.
4) Boy asked him sure take off his head
And kick it off, an awful sound, enough to wake the dead,
When Andy said, "Come on, McDuff, though I should gang to jail

5) Bed time was no longer here when muckle Jock McQueen,
He started tuning up his pipes he brought in Aberdeen,
He blewed so hard, the skin was thin, the bag began to swell,
And aw' flew Jock in a sheepskin smock in the moss o' Borrowdale.
6) For the dogs they started barking and the cutty roared "hee-haw."
The tramps and hawkers all come round and sich a sight they saw,
