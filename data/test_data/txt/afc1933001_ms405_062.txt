THE TEN-DOLLAR HOSS

One of the first stanzas of the endless ballad of the "Old Chisholm
Trail" runs as follows:

Oh, a ten-dollar hoss
And a forty-dollar saddle,
And I'm goin' to punching
Them longhorn cattle.

In the early cattle days of Texas it is true that a good saddle cost
more than a sound pony. Many mustangs, the descendants of Spanish horses,
ran wild, unbranded, acknowledged no owner. Though hard to catch, and
harder to ride when caught, these horses, excellent for cow ponies, could
be bought in droves for ten dollars each, sometimes even for less.
Saddles might cost even more than the "forty dollars" of the song if
the cowboy cared for silver mountings.
General Santa Anna's saddle, captured after the battle of San Jacinto,
carried several pounds of silver in its make-up. The dressy Texas cowboy
was always partial to the taste in saddles of his neighboring cattle
raisers across the Rio Grande.
Both his horse and his saddle were very close to the heart of a 
cowboy, no matter what they cost. His horse is the theme of many of the
songs the cowboy made up and sang; sometimes, too, he sings of his
saddle as when they buried a comrade-

We laid him down to rest
With his saddle for his pillow,
His rope across his breast.

His saddle was a familiar friend as a pillow. Another popular song
begins: 

At midnight when the cattle lie sleeping
On my saddle I pillow my head.
