A 
HYMN,
Composed by the Reverend
Mr. Whitefield,
To be sung over his own Corps.
Taken from the Original, May 1, 1764.

Ah! Lovely appearance of death,
No fight upon earth is so fair;
Not all the gay pageants that breathe,
Can with a dead body compare.
With solemn delight I survey
The corps when the spirit is fled'
In love with the beautiful clay,
And longing to lay in his stead.

How blest is our brother bereft
Of all that could burthen his mind;
How easy the foul that has left
This wearisome body behind.
Of evil incapable thou,
Whole relicks with envy I see,
No longer in misery now,
No longer a sinner like me.

This Earth is afflicted no more
Eith sickness-or shaken with pain;
The war in the members is o'er,
And never will vex him again.
No anger henceforward of shame,
Shall redden his innocent clay;
Extinct is the animal flame,
And passion is vanish'd away.

This languishing head is at rest,
Its thinking and aching are o'er;
This quiet immoveable breast,
Is heav'd by affliction no more.
This heart is no longer the feat
Of trouble and torturing pain;
It ceases to flutter and beat,
It never shall flutter again.

The lids he so seldom could close,
By sorrow forbidden to sleep,
Seal'd up in eternal repose,
Have strangely forgotten to weep.
The fountains can yield no supplies,
These hollows from waters are tree;
The tears are ail wip'd from these eyes,
And evil they never shall see.

To mourn and to suffer is mine,
While bound in this prison I breathe,
And still for deliverance pine,
And press to the issues of death.
What now with my tears I bedew,
O might I this moment become;
My spirit created anew,
My flesh be confign'd to the tomb.

Mr. Whitefield,
