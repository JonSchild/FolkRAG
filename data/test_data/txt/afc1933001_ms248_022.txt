Dear Father:

I presume by now that you have received the letter to the
Tire Priorities Board and I will wait to hear what they decide
before I get you the train travel money.  I have sent in
a memorandum asking for $700 additional funds for your recording
trip across the West and assume I will get approval on it very
soon.

Last week-end I interviewed the head of Thomas Crowell and Sons
who have asked me to write a book on American folk music, the
history of the whole field.  He was willing to make me an advance
of $1,000 which will carry me very comfortable through the next
six or eight months and I m prone to accept it.  What do you
think?  I plan an appendix in which we will print 25 to 50 songs.
Would you be willing to let part of those come out of our books
without charge or would you want some sort of blanket sum for them?
Let me know.

My love to Deanie.

Yours,

P. S. I think you ought to pay the bills yourself as we have always
done in regard to repairs to the machine and send them in
with your vouchers at the end of your trips.  I don't see why we
shall ever have such trouble with any of your accounts as you have
had with your last one.  There were some special accounting problems
there which ought never to arise again unless you have exceeded the
sum which has been apportioned for the expedition which, as I said
before, is $700 for the next trip.

Since there is money left over out of the $300 for the work you have
just completed, I would suggest that you pay the two bills and send
them in to Gerry for clearance.  I'll tell him they're coming.
