             Assistant Director

SUBJECT: Archibald MacLeish Inquiry

     The letter from Archibald MacLeish, Librarian of Congress,
is returned to you with the following observations:

     1. The idea of a film based on folkways and folk music
is excellent. In fact, the idea has been advanced before by numerous
persons. I have mentioned it at various times, most comprehensively
in a paper presented before the Society of Motion Picture
Engineers last spring. Moreover, the tremendous wealth of material 
by Writers' Project people is too important not to translate, in 
part at least, into motion picture form.

     2. As for the director of the film, I have some doubts
as to Joris Ivens. I agree with Mr. MacLeish that Ivens is human
and earthy, but I have doubts that he is familiar enough with the
American idiom and American folkways to do the job justice. I am
afraid that there might be a bit of a hangover from Old World conditioning. Moreover, I do know that Lorentz is extremely interested
in American folkways. Whether or not he is the man to do the job
should be a matter of decision for the sponsors of the picture.
It is quite likely that he might do a non-stylistic treatment in 
a film of this sort.

     3. If you are interested in exploring other possibilities
for direction, I would suggest that a division of labor be tried.
For example, Robert Flaherty, who is quite as earthy as Ivens and 
is much more familiar with the American idiom than Ivens, might be
a candidate. Flaherty is extraordinarily human and has been able
to get the best out of people of many types including our native
Americans. I would like to see consideration given to a collaborative
effort between Flaherty, Lorentz, and a couple of others who
know the native set-up. I would suggest that Ben Botkin, University
of Oklahoma folklorist and Mr. Spivacke be teamed up with Flaherty
and Lorentz and see what can be distilled out of the joint exploration.
I do not know Mr. Harris, but I feel that the efforts of the 
people indicated could result in a fine contribution.
