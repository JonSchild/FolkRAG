Track Lining

"When steel gets tight with the sun shinin' right warm on    the track
buck and it looks just something like an old slavery-time fence row, in and
out. Well, this day the sun was shinin', the track was buckin', and I was
walkin' an' talkin'. The passenger train's due now, and I got to git out
down there and line that track up straight. It's just like a knittin' needle
before the passenger train gets there. I holler and call six of my best men
by name. Chances are I'll call Hank Stevens, Sonny Watkin, Sam Justis, 
Jim Williams, to get their linin' bars and go down there. I have to tell 'em
where to get it."
