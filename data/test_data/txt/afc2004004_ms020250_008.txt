UNCLE TOM
"Uncle Tom" is a play. A crowd of children sits around in a 
place and one -- Uncle Tom -- goes out. he comes back and
knocks on the floor or hair of one of the group:
Uncle Tom: (Knocking) Knock, knock.
1st child: Who is that?
Uncle Tom: Uncle Tom.
1st Child: What you want?
Uncle Tom: I wanna sell some nails. How many pounds you want?
1st Child: Two. (Or any other number.)
Uncle Tom: (Gives 1st child two snall sticks, or whatever else
he may have gathered up to represent nails. Then
the process is repeated until all the children in 
the group have bought nails. Then he goes out again.
He may change while he is out, dress all kind of
funny ways, put on old, crazy, raggedy clothes of
smut his face or put on an old, funny hat, to make
himself look real ugly and ragged. Then he comes
back and knocks again.)
Knock, knock.
1st Child: Who is that?
Uncle Tom: Uncle Tom.
1st Child: What you want?
UNCLE Tom: I want pay for my nails, please. (He says it in 
a funny way as if he were hungry and tired.)
1st Child: I can't pay.
Uncle Tom: (On the verge of tears) You can't pay?
1st Child: I can't pay.
(In tears) You can't pay ol' Uncle Tom?
Uncle Tom: (None of the children in the group are supposed to
laugh, or even smile. If they do -- because Uncle
Tom has been doing outlandish things all this time --
they must return the "nails. Then Uncle Tom goes
to the second child and tries to get him to laugh.
The child who will not laugh is Uncle Tom the next time.)
