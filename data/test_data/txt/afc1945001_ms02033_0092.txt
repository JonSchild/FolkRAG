From Margery C. Quiqley Montclair NJ.
Heard in Springfield Mass Aug 14 1942
Subject:  Waste

"Imagine! A real estate
man I know says the payroll
alone in the Springfield Rent Control Office is $30,000.
There have to be three blanks
filled out and on every blank is
an expensive sheet of carbon
used once and then thrown away
Why, each sheet is five or six cents apiece!
"They don't get down to economical management,
and so it's poor little Milquetoasts like us who
have to suffer."

LANDLORDS!

TOMORROW
IS THE LAST DAY . . .
-- to file registration
blanks with the OPA
Rent Control Office.
