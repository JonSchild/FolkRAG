Mrs. Fannie C. Cotrell, 89, Friars Pt., Miss. .
Owns own home, pleasant 3 room wooden
shack. When asked for old songs of her
youth she wrote down the following.
Get on Board, Old Ship of Zion
Steal Away Home To Jesus
I Couldn't Hear Nobody Pray
Swing Low, Sweet Chariot
Oh! My God Rocks Daniel

Play songs
   Chicken McCrane
   Little Sally Walker

P.L. Dunbar
   When the Corn Pone's Hot
   What Yo doin' Sweepin', Honey

Chariot Comin', Jubelle Chariot Comin'.
My Jesus Love Me, Yes.
Look Away in the Kingdom.

Rock Daniel is a ring play. A
bunch of women would gather up in 
a home about Christmas time and
ring up and sing this song. I 
always sat off to one side, never
was allowed to go with a crowd
