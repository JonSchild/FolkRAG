And, some were a bit disgruntled

There is no finer recreational 
spot in Mississippi, and everyone
seems to be taking advantage
of the sport offered there.
The coveted post of coach of
what may be the greatest football
aggregation of World War
Number Two has been filled.
And to Lieutenant Paul D.
(Tony) Hunkle, former Butler
University Athletic Director, has
gone the Navy's Department's
appointment of head mentor of
the Great Lakes Naval Training
Station aggregation.
Meanwhile, Cliff Battles, assistant
gridiron pilot at Columbia,
has obtained leave of absence 
to assist Major Wallace
Wade in coaching the all-army
football team's western squad.
The army team, coached by 
Wade-former Duke mentor-
and Lieutenant Bob Nyland-
late of Tennessee-will play an
eight-game schedule against National 
Professional league teams.
Battles played with the Boston 
and Washington pro teams
before going to Columbia in 
1938 as assistant to Coach Lou
Little.
Hinkle is stationed at Great
Lakes and has served as assistant
to Lieutenant Mickey Cochran
and Lieutenant Commander
J. Russell Cook, Athletic Officer,
in directing the station's 
physical education program.
The Navy credits Hinkle with 
aiding the development of a vast
intramural program to toughen
that has served as a model for
thousands of recruits and one
college and other branches of
the service.
Hinkle became head coach at
Butler in 1934. His bulldogs won
seven consecutive Indiana inter-
collegiate conference championships.
His 1936 and 1939 elevens 
were undefeated. Hinkle also had
an outstanding record as a basketball
coach.
