     Ah, why did you men go into those places?
That's what we want to know.
B. Gordon:
     You didn't know no better!
W.B. :
     You couldn't do no better!  You couldn't
do no better.  You was tryin to leave the farm, for fifty and
seventy-five cents a day, and go someplace where you could
earn a little bit mo money.  But when you get in those places,
well then you would earn their money but you didn't get paid
for it.
B.G. :
     Yeah!  You'd get out there, and they would, ah,
they  say they gonna give you fifteen dollars a week.  That's
two and a half a day.  And payday, he may pay you off and then
may not pay you off.  He used to work you out there,
sometimes, two and three months and just give you a drag,
like ten or fifteen dollars -sumpin to gamble around there in
the camp with.  Could go down. . go to the, the ah, commissary,
and get anything you want like clothes or stuff like that. . .
to wear.  But no money.  They'd give you a little drag or
somethin.  They work you, probably, three or four months
before they can give you nothin.
A.L. :
    What about this table walkin?  Did you ever
hear of anybody who'd walked a table?  A table walker?
B.G. :
     Yeah!  They walked a table.
Whole group:
     Yeah.  Yeah they walked the table.
W.S. Hart:
     They'd walk 'em.  Long table.  Put that food on
that table there and you'd better not get too much of that
food off there before you get some of em try dippin in your
plate!  I love it, though!  Them boys! (laughs)  And I said,
"Pass me them so-and-so!, pass me them beans down there",
shuck!
B. Gordon:
     And, you see, you'd go to grab. . .
W.S. Hart:
     Then (the dude chuck that out there?)  and. . . 
jumpin' in his plate. .
