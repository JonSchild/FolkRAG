In order to discuss constructively plans for a Brazilian field 
trip with Doctor Herskovits, I suggest that it would be wise for 
me to go to Northwestern where I can hear some of his recordings 
and see him in his own surroundings.

The documentary field trip is scheduled to begin the 25th of this 
month, so that this week-end will be the most convenient time for 
me to go. Exact date can wait for a reply to my letter to 
Herskovits mailed on Saturday, but I suggest that you put in a 
travel order for a round trip plane fare to Northwestern as soon 
as possible.
