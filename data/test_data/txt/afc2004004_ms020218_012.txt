[ROCKING BABIES GEN.*]

BJ: I suppose it does. 'Cause /Mama said one time, they come home,
I just have had whoopin' cough, I think, or sumpin'. Well, said,
tongue was all, jus' all blood up, you know. I musta been tryin'
to cough or sumpin', you know, had whoopin' cough. An' then, Miss
Susie find it out an' tol' her about it; she wouldn't let Mama go
back to the field no more until I got well. That's the owner of
the place.
   So I about...A lot of times children do suffer many things,
that way, see?
AL: What about your own child when you were working?
BJ: Well, I never know anything like that. 'Cause she was a 
big size and I always be right back of the f_____ orth (back and forth?).
If I got to work 'way off, I put her in a box and carry her onto
the fiel' with me, you see? An' leave her under a tree. An' then 
come back and pick her up...
AL: When you were raising your child, did you pick her up every
time she complained, or did you let her cry?
BJ: No. I didn't never pick up no child every time they complain
lessen you know what's ailin' 'em. You know, a mother has to 
kind of be a mother in understandin'. A whole lot...you can tell
when a chile is in distress and mean a thing. You can tell, sometime,
when it's jus' cryin'. You know. If you learn to know 'em, see?
There's a time to pick 'em up and a time not to. Time to let 'em
cry. 'Cause you put 'em down to sleep, they want you to hold 'em
to put 'em to sleep, you spoil them to hand. Some chilrun are hand
spoiled.
[*hand spoiled*]
AL: What does that mean?
BJ: Han' spoiled wants you to rock 'em to sleep, you see.
AL: You won't rock them?
BJ: No, no. It's not right to rock a baby to sleep. I has to
rock a lot of peoples' babies to sleep because they got 'em spoiled.
But it's not right to raise one that way. Train 'em that way, I
mean. Train 'im when he's tryin' to sleep, you lay him down and let
'im go to sleep. Well, he'll cry a lil' while. He'll get used to
that. I got those on the Island right now, what I'm tellin' ya
now, that's they way they are; I got them that way. An' they's
some well-to-do white people, I said, "you let 'em alone now, 
they go asleep. So they liked it. Tell me afore I lef' home, said,
