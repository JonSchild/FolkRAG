A     My - ah, this was sung by ah - to me by a 
little girl way back in the ah 30s in - near 
Harlen.  [SINGS]

Made to the old English tune of:  [SINGS]
[*WHICH SIDE ART YOU ON?*]
[*17. 04.22*]

A real Burnsian ah use of an old tune to make
a new - ah, to fit a new situation.

[*STRIP MINING
(Pictures!)*] 
Ah . . . The event - final event is truly
dreadful, with the ah small truck mines that
have come, tearing away at small veins and
turning the whole population into exploiters
of their own terrain, and finally the big
companies with the strip mining that's simply
destroying this whole area of the world.
Ah, it's, it's - the truth has been suppressed,
we don't- we never look at it, we never see it
on television.  They're - they've made laws to
try to stop strip mining, but, ah, it's not
ah been restrained, it's going on more
vigorously than ever before, and the reason 
is that the local legislators - 'latures - 
will not back their own people in defence of
their own land.
