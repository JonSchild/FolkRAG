W.B.:
     Yeah, but you couldn't stop.  Now, when they
come out --he'll tell ya (to B. Gordon), they all wore white,
(unintelligible) boots. . . come up to here.  Lace and white.
B.G.:
      Yeah.
W.B.:  
     . . .And they wore khaki-color pants with
button legs --ah, zip legs.  And they would have on heavy
underwear, T-shirts and heavy wool turtleneck sweaters.
They'd had a pistol on this side (left) and a stick hangin on
that side (right), of theyself (this outfit?).  And you was
gonna do what they said, or you was gonna get a whippin next.
B.G.:
     You wasn't allowed to stop at the fire.
W.B. :
     No, you wasn't allowed to. . .
A.L. :
     How would they talk to you?  What would they
say?
(unintelligible).
W.B. :
     Ah, you know, like they. . --now they didn't
never talk to no one man, when they get ready to make a 
talk. . --like this was the pit, from here to the top of the
levee, back out to the river bank and over to that building
and over to this building -- they'd ride right in the middle
of the pit.
A.L. :
     Yeah?
W.B. :
     And, Ol' Man Ryan used to take his hat off his
head.  He wore a big, white Stetson -great big one.  And he'd
throw it up and he'd shoot six holes in it!.. 'fore it hit
the ground!  Then he'd tell somebody down there, "Hand me my
hat!".  And they would hand it to him and he'd say, "Now
listen, I'm gon whip you if you stand and I'm gonna kill ya
if you run.  I want you all to do so and so and so.  I want you
to get me some dirt.  I got to finish such and such a station
by such and such a time.  Is there any questions?"
-when he asked you that, he'd have his hand on that pistol.
"Is there any questions?"  Ain't nobody sayin nothin, he'd
say, "Well just carry on".
