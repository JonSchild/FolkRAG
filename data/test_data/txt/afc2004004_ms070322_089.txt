down or tumbled down, the
square stones are solid today.

In the camp - the latrine
carved in stone reminded me
of the pink soft lines of Roman
penises fountaining yellow &
white foam there. The
paymaster counter worn by the brass
coins. The small low rooms
where the men squatted polishing
their helmets, spitting, telling
stories, waiting to go to the
women at night. And the
young recruits  coming in, thinking
of home, needing mama, hoping
the Lucy at home would be
waiting - no different [now] then
than now. The same sorrow
repeated, the same waste.

I imagine the gleaming
helmets in the sunlight
