unto myself, until ah, ah, the year -- I mean when the ah, ah,
what's that called, thing? Ahm, "Hesitatin' Blues," you know?
And, and, the um, um...

BJ: The...ah, I don't know who sanged it now. I think Bessie
had it, though. And -- Bessie Smith -- and the ah, "Draftin'
Blues," you know, when mens was goin' to war. That was in the
First World War, that thing. That was the first time I heard the
blues, was "Draftin' Blues." Next was the "Hesitatin'." All other
time, I heard the song sung, said they call it rags; jus', you
know, an' bl-- an', ah, an' reels. I never heard a blues until 1914.
