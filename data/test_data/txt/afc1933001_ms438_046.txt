Frankie And Albert (2)

In this version Lead Belly lets his knife on the strings of
a six-string guitar do the "talking" for him. The [text] words
of the ballad are the same as in "Frankie and Albert," number
1, except that there are no "Lawd, Lawd,"s or "Farewell"s.

Frankie was a woman,
An' ev'rybody know[s]
Spent a hundred dollars
Buy her man (a) suit o' clo's
Was her man, Lawdy, 'cause he doin' her wrong.
