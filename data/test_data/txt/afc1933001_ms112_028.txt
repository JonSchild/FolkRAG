that mighty few are 
passing that, too.

Margaret just had 
a ludicrous experience tussling 
with the  kitchen faucet,
which has been dripping. It 
got clear out of hand, as 
she unscrewed the valve, 
and drenched her, the 
ceiling and the shelves!
Thus, after I tightened it 
back successfully, I am 
appointed plumber for this family.

Our garden does 
mighty well for the amount 
of time we are able to devote 
to it.

We hope you and 
all the rest are well. Please 
write and send us family 
letters. 

Your son,
John.
