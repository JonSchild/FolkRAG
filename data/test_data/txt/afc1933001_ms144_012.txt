to Washington---first, to poke my nose into the field of cowboy 
singers and to see what there is to be done in the Mexican 
field in New Mexico.  Do you think it would be possible for me 
to spend, say, September in New Mexico or perhaps return there 
during the winter, provided we do not decide that another year 
of college work might not be amiss.  These are some of the matters 
I should like to discuss with you soon.  Perhaps it would be a 
good thing for me to come down to Washington for the folk festival 
for three days and see you at that time.
In the meantime, in lieu of a list of the Bloomfield 
records-- I enclose my rough notations of the numbers.  Please 
let me hear from you in this regard shortly.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
