BJ TAPE 7A, p. 114

TL:  You mean the spirits...
BJ:  Tha's right.
TL:  ..would come after her, an'...?
BJ:  No, they would jus', well, she see 'em.  Ya know.
TL:  Oh, she'll see them?
BJ:  Uh-huh.  All the time.  See, there's a way you can use that
veil, see?  Jus' take the veil off of 'em -- so I say it 'cause
you may have some some day an' I won't be around! -- but jus'
let 'em take the veil.  Don't let 'em throw it away, [when they] jus' let 'em
take the veil off.  And put it into a, a little, a bottle or
either a jar.  Anything clear.  An' put some alcohol on it.
Jus', jus' straight out alcohol.  'Cause Mama an' them years back would go
-- I heard them say they used to put gin whiskey on it.
TL:  Oh really?
BJ:  Yeah.  Not, not, not other whiskey, but gin.  'Cause gin is
a medicine.  You know, and gin is not whiskey.  An' so they used to put
gin whiskey on, on, on those things.  So I used to hear 'em talk
about it years ago, but now we put alcohol on it.  [See,] Jus' wood
alcohol.  An' turn it, you know, while the baby is very young, you jus'
turn it up, turn the bottle, tight it tight an' turn the bottle
upside down, ya know.  An' so, she jus' put it to a certain place
to the house an' turn it upside down.  Kep' it 'till she was a 
year old, see.  An' whoever, an' after that, then she jus' keep
it.  She, she, she say she still got it in her trunk upside down.
'Cause every time say she turn it up, say the gal be tellin'
'er Mama, "I seen the man; I seed so-an-so."  An' she -- See,
it scare her to death.  Hah, an' so she jus' turn it back down.
[It] She's a sight!  The child, when she talk funny, "Ya better not
turn it!  I don't like that, Mama!  I don' wanna see nothin'
