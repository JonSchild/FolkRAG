Probably Washingtonians know something 
of the effects of alcohoics since
they, think of using same in that way.
I would think that if this little Fish
canning Factory girl went to Washington,
for information of any kind, she would 
not need a guide to gather her 
information, as she would know both
English and French (their patoi) remaining
close to the French language.
I hope to be among the group representing 
Louisiana at the National Folk 
Festival in Washington, in May  and if 
you are in the audience, I would be 
very much interested, (after performance) in 
having you pointed out to me, as I 
would to look at the face (in our 
quiet sweet Louisiana way) of the 
man who expresses himself in that 
manner in speaking of our Cajuns.
We are fond of our country folk 
and do appreciate and conserve 
this mine of music and folk lore.
Yours truly,
Mrs. Rodolph Roy
