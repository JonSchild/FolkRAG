Dear Mr. Lomax:

As you know, we must omit from AMERICAN BALLADS AND FOLK SONGS,
in any future printings, "The Strawberry Roan," which now appears on page
392; also, from the new edition of COWBOY SONGS, we must omit in any future
printings "The Strawberry Roan," which now appears on page 99, and "I'd
Like To Be In Texas When They Round-up In The Spring" on page 321.

So that we may not be delayed in the event of a reprinting of
these books, could you send me material from which new plates may be made
to substitute for the material on these pages? We will set up whatever
material you send along, and hold it in readiness for the reprinting. It
sometimes takes a little time, however, to take care of work of this nature,
and it has seemed to me well to get the substitutions through now.
Of course you will make certain that whatever you send is free and clear
for use, so that you and we will not be embarrassed by any claims that
may be put in in behalf of any possible owner.

You will observe, of course, that "The Strawberry Roan" in
AMERICAN BALLADS AND FOLK SONGS covers part of page 392, all of 393 and
394, and part of 395.
