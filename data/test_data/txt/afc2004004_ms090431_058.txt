Fisk, 13. 6.
WILL STARK.
I got my color.
I'm feelin mighty blue.
I'm havin lots of trouble
Tellin all to you.
I certainly claim the justuce
With rights and
Cause my Aunt Willie and
My own gal is black.
My own girl has take a notion
Against the colored race.
Say that if I had to win her,
I'd have to change my face.
Say [that] if she had me,
That hse'd regret it soon.
Now I am sure that's very bad
Because I am a coon.

Coon, coon, coon,
I wish my color would change.
Coon, coon, coon,
I'd like a different shade.
Coon, coon, coon,
for mo'nin, night and noon,
I wish I was a white man insteady of a coon.

I hae my face anointed,
I had my hair made straight.
Just look like a white man
Then I'll get the grad.

Just as I was thinkin
I had things fixed up all right,

Coon, coon, coon,
I wish my color'd change.
Coon, coon, coon,
I'd like a different shade.
Coon, coon, coon,
For mo'nin, night and noon,
I wish I was a white man
Insteady of a coon.

A: What kind of a song would you call that, Will?
