March 17, 1942

Dear Bess, 
The version of John Henry that we're going to use in Milwaukee is the one
that Pete knows rather than myself.  I'm so tired these days that I can't 
sing worth a damn anyway so that the choice is obviously Pete's and, besides, 
I don't want to appear on Carleton's show.  Somewhat surprised that 
you asked me. 

About Latin America - there's one pamphlet which is quite pleasant about 
Latin American dance forms done by Gustavo Duren.  It's called "Recordings
of Latin American Songs and Dances An annotated Selected List of Popular
and Folk Music".It's published by the Music Division of the Pan American
Union, Music Series No. 3, January, 1942, and sells for thirty cents.  You
might also look at items 1, 2 and 3 on page 49 of the attached bibliography;
I hope it will be use to you.  It sells for 25Â¢, I thin,, from the Progressive
Education Association and was designed for the layman. 
I'm awfully sorry that your's having commercial constipation.  It it's 
any consolation, remember that everybody connected with  radio has it.  I 
hope you can get your foot in the door at DBS, however, because once it's 
in, you're one of the boys and you can do a hell of a lot of good there. 
My suggestion would be that you look around for a place where an original 
script by yourself would get a hearing. The boys, while they have their
bad points, are always  on the lookout for anybody who can make a pleasant
noise over the microphones and there's no reason why you shouldn't compete
with Mill and        , et al, if his first script is nay sample of what he
can do. 

It doesn't look as if I can get to New York or you come to Washington
but it does look as if we'll meet in Milwaukee and we can talk everything
over out there. 

You're a darn fool for not getting your application  in to Rosenwald. 

Love,

an:mdr
