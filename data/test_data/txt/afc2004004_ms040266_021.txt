Dear Alan, 
John McDonald, a mole and rat catcher from Pitgaveny,
Elgin, has written to say the he has broadcast once in
the Scottish Home Service, and that he has learnt a lot of
old bothy ballads from tramps, as well as composing some himself.

He mentions that he includes his repertoire:

Haughs O' Cromdale
Rovin Ploughboy
Jamie Rose
Lord Ronald
Dying Ploughboy
The Mains O' Foggieloun
Nickytams, ect.

I have written to him and told him that unfortunately the
series has come to an end, but if the occasion arises when
we can use him again we will get in touch with him.

I merely thought you would like to know of his 
existence.

Yours,
David
