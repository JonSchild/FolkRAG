While cruisin' round Yarmouth one day for a spree
I met a fair damsel, the wind blowing free;
"I'm a fast goin' clipper, my kind sir," said she,
"I'm ready for cargo, my hold it is free."
Singin' fall the ral laddy, right fal the ral day,
Fal the ral laddy, right fal the lal day.

What country, she came from I could not tell which;
By her appearance I thought she was Dutch.
Her flag wore its colours, her masthead was low;
She was roundat the quarter, an' bluff at the bow. (refrain)

I gave her the rope an' took her in tow,
From yardarm to yardarm a-towin' we go,
We towed on together till we came to the
We both towed together through to                      Bay. (refrain)

We towed till we came to the house of
We gave her
I lift up her hatches, found plenty of room,
And into her cabin I stuck my jib boom. (refrain)

She took me upstairs an' her topsail she
In a neat little parlour she soon had me moored.
She laid in her foresails, her staysails an' all,
With a lily white hand on my reef tackle fall. (refrain)

I said, "Pretty fair maid, it's time to give o'er;
Betwixt wind and water you've ran me ashore.
My shot locker's empty an' powder's all spent;
I can't fire a shot for it's choked at the vent. (refrain)

Here's luck to the girl with the black curly locks;
Here's luck to the girl who ran jack on the rocks;
Here's luck to the doctor who eased all his pain;
He's squared his mainyards, he's crusin' again. (refrain)

Lomax: Marvellous. Best one you've sung almost, Harry. What, "Here's
luck to the doctor. . .?"
Cox: Here's luck to the doctor that eased all his pain."
Lomax: Oh, I see.
Cox: He's squared his mainyards, he's a-cruisin' again.
Lomax: He had the pox, eh?
Cox: Yes. (pause)
Lomax: Now what about this Rising Sun song?
Cox: What, that old bad song?
Lomax: Yes.
Cox: That one ain't worth doin', is it?
Lomax: Mm For me. . . .I have it from the United States, see
(pause)
Cox:     ?
