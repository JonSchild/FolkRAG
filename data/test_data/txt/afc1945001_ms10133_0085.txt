F.N.M

A civilian was called to the army, and he took 
his week furlough.  When he arrived at the camp he was 
always looking for something, but he was always saying, 
"that's not it," "that's not it."  Finally the various 
officials and the commanding officer decided that 
the soilder was crazy.  The commanding officer called the 
soilder to his office and gave him his papers, and 
told him that he was released from the service, and the 
soilder replied, "that is it."

Buy a bond, a bond will buy a bomb and a 
bomb will sink an enemy battleship.
