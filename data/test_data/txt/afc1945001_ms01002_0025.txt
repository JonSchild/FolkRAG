special purposes, it may be to the advantage of the educational program
to call for the help of the reporters in certain types of campaign, but
in general, their energies and attention should be focused upon the
important task of rumor reporting.
In maintaining such a staff, the morale of the individual
reporter is very important. He should understand that his work is being
appreciated and also understand that any sort of public recognition of
the contribution he is making to the community would immediately impair
his effectiveness. He may be given some special designation and perhaps
identification or participation card, but he should not be publicly
acknowledged until after the project has been dissolved or until he leaves
the service. Special pains, therefore, should be taken to arrange for
meetings of the staff, so that they can be directly informed of their contributions 
and be given some special private information to help them get
better perspective on how their individual contributions are being used in
the total project.
Care must be taken to prevent the community from feeling that a
Gestapo is being organized. It should be made clear that reporters merely
monitor conversation. There should be no rebuking, no personal reporting,
no tracking down and assigning "guilt" to individuals.
