1.  Did you hear about the accident in the Albee theater
last night?  The balcony fell down.  They [was] were
showing a picture about Hitler and all of the 
"Poles" walked out.

2.  Hitler making a speech to his people.  "Did I
not march 400 miles in Russia, 200 miles in
and 200 miles out."

3.  One time a guy went to a hoarhouse and [I] asked the
head lady the price of the "meat."  The head lady replies, 
we have got some for $5, $10, $15, $20 and $50.  The man
says, I have only got $.50, do you suppose you could
help me out.  Well you might be able to get that
one for $5.  The man goes over and starts talking
to this girl and she says, I will piss in
your hat for $.50.  She pisses in his hat and he
takes it out side and takes out his dick and says
come on bastard [l] eat soup, meats to high.
