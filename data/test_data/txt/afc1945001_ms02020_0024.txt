Report written August 5, 1942
Southern California

In considering rumors in Southern California, it should 
be borne in mind that the state was primarily of isolationist view
point before the war and this view point has not been changed as 
far as consideration of post-war participation in world affairs. 
There is no lack of loyalty to the United States, and people are
anxious to win the war, but they are not as concerned with Hitler
as they are with Japan.  Consequently, stories and rumors are in
circulation concerning the book Japanese while little interest is shown
in England and the British Empire.
