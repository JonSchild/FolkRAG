Roll 58 Frank Proffitt 1

Frank: This is an old North Carolina murder ballad, which is very important
in my family. It figures,...my father sung this in 1938 to Frank Warner,
a folk song collector. About 20 years later, a group called the
Kingston Trio got ahold of it and sang it on the Ed Sullivan show and
it changed our lives after that more than I can get into -- don't have time
to get into all of it -- but just to try to express, it would be impossible,
my feelings about it all. But I will try to sing it as near as the 
way my father did if I can, on this old home-made fretless banjo. And
maybe close to the way a that Tom Dooley sang it, himself, if he actually
did, which a lot of people say he did. The story was passed down that he
made this up while hew as in jail in Iredell(?) County; and hunt in
Statesville on May 1, 1868 singin' in the hangin' car on his way to the
gallows. Okay,.....Tom Dooley (plays)
...This is called "Lord Nevell"(Lovell?) , old English-Scottish ballad
passed down in my family. ("say that again") This old mountain balled
called "Lord Lovell". I'll try to sing this as near a way as my father
did as I can. It's part of my tradition, my heritage...and this an old
one, I'll tell you....(plays)
