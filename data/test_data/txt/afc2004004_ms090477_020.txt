what I'd wrote on my own. An'-uh, 'co'se some of 'em was better musicians than I [was]
were, back in those days, an' fact of the business, I'm not so good now but 
back in those days-uh-uh [it] there was better guitar players than I was an' better
singers an' ev'ything else. So they take my numbers an' give 'em to guys that 
could sing better than me an'...
ALAN: Did you get anything out of it?
BILL: I got nothing, not a dime..from...
ALAN: Why not?
BILL: Well I don' know why not. I didn'-I...
ALAN: Why'd you let them do you like that?
BILL: Well I didn' know-I didn' know nothin' 'bout tryin' to-to demand for no money
or nothin'. Jus'-uh whatsonever they said it went on, see? Some of 'em-some
time they tell me that a number of mine it didn' sell good, it jus' was aroun'
in the neighborhood wha' I was at an' [in] there were other places it wasn' hear', see?
An'-uh sometime they'd tell me that they-that they put the numbers aroun' wha'
I could get a-could hear 'em because they figgered it was right that I should 
hear my own numbers but other places wouldn' nobody else buy none of 'em an'
they jus' put 'em out 'roun' there just'-uh so that I could-[uh] could-uh, enjoy
listenin' to 'em, tha's all. So that's the way-that's the way those things
happen. Wasn' no-wasn' no money in the-in-uh records untol after I got with
Melrose I got a little money from him. But them other guys-uh..there-uh-lotta-
lot-lotta numbers that I've made, I haven't got anything out of 'em at all.
