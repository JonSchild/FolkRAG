[*(GETTING AWAY FROM UNHAPPY SITUATIONS)*]

BJ:     So she found out, ah, [her] father found out, that that
wasn't the way.   Ah, ta move the switches, an' maybe she'll work
better.   So that's was the way.   Something. . .What I mean by
that, drivin' [an' knockin'] is not for everybody, you know.   Jus' like I
tell you a while ago about that love.   You got to treat some
folks some way an' some another way an' they be satisfied.   But
drivin' ain't for everybody.   Some folks. . .But drivin' is just
right for some folks.   Ya see?  "If I don't do so-an'-so, he'll
beat me."   Well, ah, it's. . .sumpin' crawls all through me. . .
I don't know what about it, when I hear a woman say, "Chile, if
I don't do that, that man'll be on my haid."   Ow!   That makes
me mad as don' know what, in my mind.   See, because if he get
on my haid, he ain't gonna care what I do for him, you know?    At,
you know, at the run.   I know he [gonna] can whip me then.   But I know
he can't live around me, in peace, not no more.   'Cause I --
As you say, I'll be there an' not there.   If I see where I, I
don't wanna hurt 'im real bad and sumpin' like that, I just pick
up an' leave.   'Cause I put many miles between me an', an' my
enemies if I know it, ya see.   Yeah, I'd rather put the miles
between there 'cause [where] why I never did mind goin'.   I don't
mind goin', brother!   I sure leavin'.   Leave the house just like
it is,  right there wich you.   If I wanted to, ya know?   That's
just my mind, an' I would do it.   It's -- I'd rather do it.   What
use a stayin' there with you an' you mad wit' me all the time?   Ya
see?   Because that you did to me for nothing [was] will always be
in me, ya see?   'Cause that in. . .So, therefore, I. . .
TL:      Inbetween husbands, [you] did you ever get around any guys that
treated you mean         ?
