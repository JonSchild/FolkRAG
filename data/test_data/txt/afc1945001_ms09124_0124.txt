Rumors
One day in the month of April, I heard of 
a rumor about Japan. It was told by a women 
who didn't know what she was talking about. She 
also so said that it was stated that little men 
shall  rule the earth. Then to top it she said that 
Japan hadn't turned out it's big warships. A man 
from the crowd told her to be quiet and every thing 
was agian calm.
