I'll buy me a fol-de-roldy-tildy-toldy, seek-a-double,
use-a-cause-a-roll-the-find-me.
Roll, Jennie Jenkins, roll.

Will you wear red, my dear, O my dear?
Oh, will you wear red, Jennie Jenkins?
I won't wear red,
It's the color of my head,
I'll buy me a fol-de-roldy-tildy-toldy, seek-a-double,
Use-a-cause-a-roll-the-find-me.
Roll, Jennie Jenkins, roll.

[Mrs. Louise Henson of San Antonio, Texas, gave us a
cowboy's song about his horse. He called it Doney Gal.
Doney is the Texas's way of pronouncing the Spanish word for
sweetheart -- dona.

"One time my uncle came to see us folks on our ranch
in Oklahoma. When he got ready to go the rain was pouring
down; but the weather didn't stop him.
"We watched him ride over the hill headed for the roundup,
singing his favorite cowboy song

"It's rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal are bound to go.]
