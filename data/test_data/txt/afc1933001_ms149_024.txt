Sept. 18, 1939.
Nelson Sprackling,
141 East 40th St.,
New York City.
Dear Mr. Sprackling,
My father is in Texas. I am forwarding your letter to
him, but in the meantime I am sending you the answer that I am sure
he will agree with me on. "Whiskey Johnny" in our book is quoted from
Carl Sandburg's "American Songbag" and we cannot, therefore, give 
you permission to reproduce it. This permission will have to be
obtained from Mr. Sandburg, himself. I quite understand your situation
and wish that I could help.
Captain Dick mentioned you to me when I saw him in New York
in May. He was amazed at your ability to get the old tunes down correctly.
I look forward to seeing your book. In the meantime, if you locate
other authentic shantey singers, I would appreciate your letting
me know about them. The Archive of American Folk Song which we are
building here in the Library of Congress is attempting to accumulate
recordings of all American folk-songs, authentically sung.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge, Archive of
American Folk Song
