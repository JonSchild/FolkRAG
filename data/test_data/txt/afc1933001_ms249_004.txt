If the Library will advance me payment
of $100 in advance, then afterward
promptly as I turn in mileage and
per diem. At the present time I have
no money in the bank and I do
not think that either you or Mr.
Spivacke will think that I should
borrow money to make possible 
the trip.

The use of my automobile
will simplify the entire situation,
and of course I shall need an
automobile to get the best results.
You can plan the trip (including
Alpine) in accordance with my
other letters and these late suggestions
of yours, and I'll follow it as nearly
as possible. The rest is now up
to you and Mr. Spivacke. I can start
any day. But please follow up
the Mark McGee matter.
Father
