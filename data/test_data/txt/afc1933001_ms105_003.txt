THE CHOATE SCHOOL

I do thank you, more cordially than I
can say, for your lovely letter. We certainly are
grateful for your faith in what we are doing, for your
own son and for other people's.

With warm regards, and the promise that
I will keep a special eye on Alan, believe me

Faithfully yours,
Clara Seymour St. John
