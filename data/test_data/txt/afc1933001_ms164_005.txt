Dear Alan Lomax,
The thing that interests me about this song is the borrowed idiom.
Wards like purtiest, awalked, afixin', are reminiscent of Cumberland
Mountain songs and I wouldn't have expected to find them in East
Arkansas on the lips of an almost illiterate woman. But I had
heard her sing the thing a jillion times and that's an exact
transcription.
It's a blues song in intent, without the formal blues pattern, and
every damned line is sung to the same tune; it doesn't seem to make
much difference, though.
You may have it if you can use it.
