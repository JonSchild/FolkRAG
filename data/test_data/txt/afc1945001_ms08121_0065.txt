                             I heard of a rumor that led of a catastrophy about the war. It started out like this, a preacher was giving a sermon, when it was over he said a prayer for the boys that were going over seas or who were. Well, 2 busy ladys were sitting in the peaus + took it all in. On the bus riding home the ladys discussed the matter, one of them said that the preacher never said a prayer for the boys over seas unless they were just going. The man in front of the lady overheard this + told his friends at a dinner party. The rumor which was just an innocent prayer turn out to be like this "A ship with a convoy of soldiers are going to be shipped on.
