it to find some [excuse] rationalization to allow him to live
up to the strict rules of the Methodist and Baptist churches,
which forbid dancing, and still to dance. The jubilee ring-
dances solve the problem perfectly. At church suppers and at
respectable parties throughout the country-side about Lake Arthur,
La., Washington and Samson Brown furnish the music for the ring-
dances. Some simple jubilee hymn with a single verse followed
by a refrain repeated once they accelerate, Washington shouting
the verses, Samson the refrains. All the time they are stamping
their feet on the floor to produce a fast, steady two-three rhythm
that set heels to knocking and toes to rocking. Their chant is
the most primitive, the most African music we have yet recorded.
[La] Day before yesterday in Jennings, La., we recorded [five] such
chants along with 6 Negro-Acadian ringdances, which, if any-
are more primitive than those in English, since the rhythms are more various.

Ballads:

Twenty years ago in Lake Charles Batson murdered a farmer and his
whole family. The Negroes in this part of Louisiana know a ballad
that tells of the trials and tribulations of 'po' Batson'. We
have recorded two versions. From the same singer a long account
of the World War.

Iron Head we both agree is the greatest folk-singer we have yet
found. On our last visit to him he sang for us exquisitely four
English ballads or fragments of English Ballads: The Maid Freed
from the Gallows, St. James Infirmary ( in its ancient, vulgar
version), a vulgar seduction ballad common among the Negroes for
which we do not know the title, The Rich Old Lady,  In addition
we recorded from his singing a long and detailed description
of sexual intercourse with one of the lovliest folk-tunes we have
ever heard.

Pete, guitarist extraordinary of Richmond, 
version of the vulgar seduction ballad me
the famous English Ram of Darby in a much
Lyrics, blues, fiddle tunes, rags and etc:

From Pete's singing and playing we recorded six lyrics, ranging
all the way from "Place a Rose at My Head and a Rose at My Feet"
to "Alabama Bound", one blues, one old time square dance with
the calls, one cowboy song.

Iron Head sang for us again four lyric-blues-work songs, which
we had already recorded on the Dictaphone: Shorty George, Little
John Henry, Ain' It Hard to Be a Right Black Nigger? Jack O'
Diamonds.

Stave, a guitarist of Lafayette, La., sang for us Stavin' Chain
Liza Jane and a blues after his own manner.

A white fiddler in Crowley, La., played us a Negro-French fiddle
tune.
