Library of Congress
Washington, D. C. 

My dear Mr. Strunk:
The only address that we have for
Mr. Lomax is University Station, Austin,Texas.
I believe he is traveling around the country 
and that letters and communications are forwarded 
to him.
if I receive another address from him 
within the next week or ten days, I shall be glad 
to let you know.

Very truly yours,
Susan S. [Pruit?]
