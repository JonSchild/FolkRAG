come to the North that I don't know whether I can tell you or no. But I 
can tell you some of it. I'm studyin bout what I can tell you. 
     It may be a time when you an I an others will be wiped off the globe. 
     One time there was a man, he went an hired himself to a man to split 
railins fur a pasture fence. Sent him down to de pasture wid a axe an a 
maul. He run onto a stack of human bones in the woods. He commenced to 
stirrin em up. "How come you bones heah?" "Tongue brought us heah!
"Tongue brought us heah!" the bones answered. The man run to the house. 
"Boss man! Boss man! I seen a pile o bones in the woods." White man knowed 
those bones were theah. He knew why they were theah. He said, "Nigger, 
you're a liar." "I swear on a stack of Bibles it's the troof. I seen 
those bones an they tole me, 'Tongue brought us heah." White man went with 
him to the bones, stirred em up an said. "Why are you heah? Speak!" Bones 
said nothin. "Why are you heah?" Bones said nothin. "Ill give you one mo 
chance, nigger." "Bones, answer me. Why is you heah?" Bones said nothin. 
Wham! Pow! White man killed nigger wid the axe. Soon as he fell among 
the bones, bones said, "I tole you tongue brought us heah. Now tongue done

     Ever seen a bundle of clothes tied up? Overhalls, dirty drawers (I'm 
talkin plain) ole stinkin socks, underwear, shirts, and ef you got a baby, 
soiled diapers. Don't ast nobody what's in it. Jes untie that bundle yosef. 
You'll find out what's in it. You don't have to speak but one word. Untie 
that word. Everything is in it. One word will be enough to kill you. 
     It's pitiful we don't learn enough to live by. If you know enough
