It was hidden, afraid it
would cause too much harm.
No one now knows where it is.
But [people] people still
make the [tru] turas [a journey]

Proverbs -
Putting a [goo] fox to mind the
geese -

Apples will [may] grow again.
If the trees baint cut!

God often pays debts without
money!

After a gathering, comes a
scattering.

When a man is down, down with
him!

You must take the little potatoes
with the big potato.
