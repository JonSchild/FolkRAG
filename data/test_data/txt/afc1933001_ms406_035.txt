   ["Ain't men got sharp though?  Sing these songs and go
right over and listen to 'em.  A man can't stutter none talkin'
into one of these things; if he do it'll tell on him]

We asked Abner Boggs out in [K????] if he would like to hear his voice again.  "No,
I believe not; about once is about all I can stand. I don't like
to hear myself sing.  The only time I kin sing very good is when I'm
out in the hills somewhere, drivin' an ole mule or something where
I know there ain't no one fer at least five mile.  Sometimes
I'm singin' these songs, the high notes don't bother and the low
notes galls me.  But I'll tell you, my lungs used to was clear; I
could holler and you could hear me nearly a mile.  Looks like now
I need a little something to clear my throat."
