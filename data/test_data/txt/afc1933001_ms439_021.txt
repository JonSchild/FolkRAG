De Kalb Blues (Cont'd)

Notes:

Long time man, and etc..

Lemme be you biscuit roller, until your batter -cake come,
I can do more rollin' than your batter cake ever done.

Curly headed woman I can't get nigh,
Nappy headed woman I do dispise.

Goin' get drunk, fall in the barroom do',
Tell the porter I ain' gonna get drunk no mo[."]'.

My man is gone an' he's got a great long time,
?

Wonder who gonna take me home,
I ain' got nobody to go on my bond.

Wasn' for powder and the straightenin' comb,
De Kalb womens wouldn' have no home.

De Kalb womens make me feel so bad,
?
