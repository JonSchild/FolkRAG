MARGARET BARRY. TAPE 70. LONDON NOVEMBER 3, 1953.
Lomax: Did you ever wear lipstick, Margaret ?
Barry: Never.
Lomax: Never in your life when you were a young slip of
a thing ?
Barry: No - I never used lipstick because I don't approve of it.
Lomax: You don't approve of it ? Now you're the first woman
I ever met who said she didn't approve of lipstick. Why ?
Barry: I'll tell you why. It's just that - well, I suppose
nowadays everyone uses it, every girl and woman from young up to
fifty years. I never used it because my mother before me never
used it. But that wouldn t be the reason, you know. But I just
think that when you have that on you, you know, I mean when you
want to sing - that's it; when you're singing your lips get stuck
together; you can't open your mouth wide enough when you want to
sing. That's why I'm up against that. For appearance and all that
it might look nice and all that king of thing, but I still don't likw
it. Because it might get in your insides, you know. And it tastes
very bad, anyway. I don't care about it, you know. There's nothing
wrong with make-up, you know. It looks very glamorous looking
and all that kind of thing, but I just don't use it. Because I
don't feel very happy; I don't feel happy when I have make-up on.
I just like to be ordinary, like, so that I can sing and play to
my own liking and to other people's liking as well, you know.
Lomax: Don't you feel at a disadvantage with other women - I mean,
after all, all women are out to get men, as many men as they can -
or to get their intereste -- don't you feel at a disadvantage with
other women when you don't have makeup on and they all have make-
up on ? I should think you'd feel a little funny about that, Marg.
Barry: Well, I wouldn't because I'll tell you the reason why.
You see, everybody to their own taste, you know. You see, theres'
women who can intereste themselves in making their faces up, and
looking in the mirrow, you know, and it might be nice and all that
sort of thing, but I don't take any interest in myself.
Lomax: That's very peculiar. I don't think I ever met a woman
who didn't take an interest in herself.
Barry: That's it you see. I take interest in my singing, in my
music, and that's the most important part of my life. I like
music and singing and singing and music, and then I don't interest
myself in makeup or anything like that. I like to be right and
upright, dressed you know, I like to be nice, you know; have a
nice dress on me and have my hair nice and made up and all that
kind of thing - and I'd like to have my teeth in, too, for
apearance, you know.
