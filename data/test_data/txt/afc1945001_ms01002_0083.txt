Draft cover letter to be adapted according to previous correspondence.
(Addressed to college president with a copy to psychologist or sociologist heading Clinic)

Dear........

This office is now ready to proceed with the organization of the Rumor Clinics in the field. The Office of Facts and Figures and the Office of Coordinator of Information have developed the program jointly with the Office of Education.

It should be stressed that the regional Rumor Clinics, of which there will only be about 25 in the beginning, will serve in two capacities. First, they will serve as field offices for collecting and reporting rumors on a sampling basis for the information and study if the Office of Facts and Figures and the Office of Coordinator of Information. Second, they will function as demonstration centers in program development for public education on rumor analysis and psychological warfare.

More detailed description of the Clinics is given in the attached material which has been developed to assist the directors or chairman of Rumor Clinics in the organization of their units.

The orientation course provided in the attached syllabus constitutes a prerequisite for actual work on Rumor analysis. Only after the President of a University has certified that 25 students and faculty members have completed the orientation course and passed the examination, will the Office of Education designate the local group as an official Rumor Clinic.

Please let this Office know whether or not the university wishes to develop a Rumor Clinic along the lines suggested. On the receipt of this information a supply of material will be sent for the use of the members of the group in the orientation course.

Cordially,

Chester S. Williams

Assistant to the Commissioner of Education
