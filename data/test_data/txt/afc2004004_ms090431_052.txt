Jack of diamonds a hard card to play.

Every mo'nin when I see
Jack of diamonds with the queen,
Jack of diamonds a hard card to play.

That old Jack Bart went at it;
He can't never see so good.
He will fall and make you lead.
Jack of diamonds a hard card to play.

Take that ace, etc.

A: Is that song when you find the jack of diamonds?
B: No sir. You be sigin that sometime when there be gamblin or somethin
like that. You take a man, the biggest portion of the time when
he be singin, that's a broke man. When a man git broke, he get hongry.
Every one he see pretty near look good to him, you know. He just sittin
around thinkin anything, of the money, what he could of done with the
money when he did have some. But while long as he got money still,
he's thinkin about nothin but bettin, a whole lot of money.
Why, you take a man, bettin a quarter or fifty cents, or somethin like
that, why, worse to him -- he can't do much on it. Now you take a
man what has very smart of money, like hehave trhee or four hundred
dollars in the game, he could winn good; then when he happen to git
busted, why, then, why, he start to singin. He can crack low the
retail? man; he gonna want everything he see in the house, somebody
got money. If anybody come by sellin a pie, he wants it. He wants to
drink; he wants to talk to the women. He'll go to singin and hollerin;
everythin goin wrong with him. But the man that's winnin, he
ain't doin nothin but just layin there gamblin.
The broke man, sometie he get lucky, too. Now take a nickleor dime
somebody may gamble (end of section).
