This is the central idea into the spiritual --- longing for freedom out of slavery, other-worldly freedom, too.  Out of slavery of the flesh---- because the African coming to this country was religious and we deeply religious -- And so we listen to these three fragments out of these days of slavery, sung by the Golden Gate---

Paul and Silas bound in jail,
All night, all night,
One for to sing and the other for to pray
All night, all night,

But see what the Lord done done,
then
O weepin' Mary who's on the Lord's side.
then---
You better run...

In the recent past of the spiritual, for it is still growing and unfolding all over the United States with Daddy Grace, Father Divine, and down in the country too--- in the recent past of the spiritual is the guitar, the guitar plays by the blind man.  Down the streets and back alleys, he shuffles, shouting out the song in his twelve hour a day voice, reminding saints and sinners that the blind must eat.  Companion of his dark slow journeys is his battered guitar.  It provides his accompaniment, comes in strong on the chorus, and when his breath is gone--- Talk for me, says the blind singer and his old box sings the words of the chorus, plaintively and high on little E.
