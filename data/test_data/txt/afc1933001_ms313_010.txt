JUSTIFICATION
"The people who live in rural communities today constitute
a disproportionately large share of our whole future population.
According to one expert, at least two-thirds of our total
population, one hundred years hence, will be the progeny
of those now living on farms."
     "... facilities for reading and study are meager in rural 
areas. Only 15% of the rural population live within easy distance
of public libraries...."
     "Many farms dwellers still remain cut off from the world
about them. They tend to cling tenaciously to old attitudes
and work habits." 
     In the general advancement of New Deal objectives there
stand out two distinct types of areas. The one which may be
classified as "urban" covers the industrial areas. In these
areas people readily organize and follow up by organized demand
such New Deal objectives as housing, labor's right to bargain
collectively, etc. The other areas, largely rural, are
more static and do not have proportionally the same share in
progress.
     Thus, the rural areas of the country at large present
little attraction, and are culturally deficient. Organized demand
does not exist and as a whole those of the nation's third
who have enough initiative prefer to migrate into or in the
neighborhood of urban communities. Many prefer to be slum dwellers
in the large cities rather than small-crop farmers because
in the city they at least hope to have their children benefit
