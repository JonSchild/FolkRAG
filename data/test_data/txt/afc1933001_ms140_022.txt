Dear Miss McDonald:
Your need for specifically occupational songs, is, as John
A. Lomax suggested, a somewhat difficult one to supply, especially
in regard to certain occupations. I can, however, suggest a few
additional references.
For New England:
1) Farming - Vermont Songs and Ballads, Flanders
and Brown
Springfield Mountain, a valuable discussion
of which can be found in the
Bulletin of the FolkSong Society of
the North East, edited by Phillips
Barry. This reference is generally
useful.
2) Lumbering - Folk Songs, Barry.
3) Fishing - Roll and Go, Joanna Colcord
Songs and Ballads from Nova Scotia,
Greenleaf & Mansfield.
Ballads & Folk Songs from Nova Scotia,
Mackenzie.
For the Middle Atlantic:
1) Farming - Mountain Minstrelsy of Pennsylvania,
Col. Henry Sholmaker
2) Mining - Songs and Ballads of the Anthracite Miner
Korson.
For the South:
1) Farming - Hampton Series of Negro Folk Songs,
Natalie Curtis Burlin, (cotton and peanut
