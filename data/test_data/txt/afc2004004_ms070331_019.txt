And her knees a knockin', and her face like a beet,
A scared of her shadder, and a shakin' like a sheet;
And she's pumped that churn since along about noon,
As steady as a hound a diggin'out a coon!
I don't know what in the nation to do.
I'm a lookin' every minute that they'll witch me too."

Which is all very well if the facts don't hinder.
I'd noticed Pheemy sneakin'out the milkhouse winder,
To meet some feller pretty early in the day.
And they spent till sundown in a stack of hay.
If she done any churnin' in that old haystack,
It was done without a churn and a layin' on her back.

She said,
"When I was little in East Tennessee,
The witches come and witched a young sugar-maple tree.
All of its leaves turned bloodish red
And hung all winter when the other trees shed.
Long about spring, when the buds broke shell,
We hired a witch doctor to kill the spell.
He took green locust, and he whittled out a stake
And marked it with a thing that looked like a snake;
And he set the stake ont he maple tree's side
And drove it with an axe. And the maple tree cried.
The tree screamed and whimpered like a full-grown woman.
Then it tried to say somethin', and its breath died, hummin'.
The witch doctor said, 'Well. There's your witch!
I reckon I fixed that son of a bitch!'
And there ain't been a witch on the place since then."

Well. That sounds pretty good for witch doctor men.
Still, I know a lot of things I'd rather do.
I'd rather punch header on a threshing crew,
And live between harvests on the bum, then dream
Of spikin' a live tree and hearin' it scream.
