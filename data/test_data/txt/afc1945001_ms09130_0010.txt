11A      Boy      (White)

1.  I have heard that some people at Curtiss
   Wright have driven only 7 rivets in
   the some odd weeks that they have
   worked there.
2.  That after we whip the Japs, and
   the Russians have whipped the Germans,
   America is going to have to fight Russia.
3.  That we are sending too many
   supplies to our Allies on the lend-lease
   program.
4.  That America's freedom is fading
   because of the war.
5.  That the British take all the credit
   for victories.  In the last war
   after we helped win, they said
   they didn't need us, and we shouldn't
   have come over.
