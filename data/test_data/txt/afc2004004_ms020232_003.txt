[*STORY: NEGRO MAN AND WHITE BEGGAR   1934   JACKSONVILLE*]

BJ:   The time, about this man in Jacksonville?  Well, that was
in, that was in 1934.  That was the year when, ah, Junior was
born, 1934.
AL:  The year when who?
BJ:   My grandson was born, 1934.  That's real.  We was downtown, 
buyin' little things, ya know, for him, at the 10 cent store.
Anyway, as we was down there -- it's in '34.  I cain't remember
[the] this date, ah, the month, but I know it was in '34, 'cause 's 
the same year Junior was a baby.  An' we was downtown, where we
shoppin'.  An' so we seed this man standin' on the corner. this
colored man.  He was tall an', nice lookin' man; brown-skinned;
standin' up on the corner there.  With his arms fold', lookin'
so straight at this crippled man that was on the street, beggin'
you know, as peoples does do in the city.  An' so he was um standin'
lookin' so hard, [at] me an' my daughter....I, I noticed 'im an' said,
"What he lookin' at so?"
An' she say, "Wonder why he lookin' at that man?"  So we
thought he might want to try to stick 'im up or what was he 
meant by lookin' at 'im, jus' standin' up there jus' lookin' at him,
[ya know.] with [H]is arms folded, deadly, jus' lookin' at 'im.
So finally he did, walked right on over to 'im.
We said, "What he gonna do?"
He come up to him.  He had a dollar, paper dollar.  The man
didn't have any change.  So he didn't say anything; went right on
away from the man.  So, left.  He soon come right back.  An' he 
looked at 'im that hard then looked a lil' bit an' looked at 'im an' then handed him a quarter.
The man thanked him very much.
He went right back off from the man.  Just off from 'im, off
