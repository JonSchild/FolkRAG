Natchez:  Well, that's the point we're gittin' to, now.  You take a 
mule, now: they sell him.  Al. right, and there was [x] times
they sold the Negro, too, see?  And a black man, to what they
looked at, was just the face of a black man!

The Kid:  That's just precisely it! 

Natchez:  Now I knew a man, they call him Mister White.  Well, he had a
plantation there was about fifty or sixty miles square. 
All them fences around his place was white. The trees, he
painted 'em white up as far as he could git.  An' all his
cattle, his sheeps, goats, hogs, cows, mules, hosses an'
ever'thing on his place was white. Anytime that his cow or goat
or whatsonever is is[x] have a black calf or a black coat---anything
like that, he give it to the niggers.  Even down to the
chickens.  He had all [xxxxx] white chickens, you know.  A chicken
would hatch off some black chickens, why he'd find some nigger
and give 'em to him.  [xx] Get rid of 'em.  He didn't want nothin' 
on his plantation black, see?

The Kid:  I've seed all that ,too.

Natchez:  An' this Mister White didn't even want to Negro to come
through his place, see.  The government highway come through
his [xxx] planation and he bought land all around there and 
built a [highway] road so Negroes couldn't come through his
planation at all. Had to go all the way round, you know. 
Everybody had to go long there, because it was a main highway...
a pike..a state highway, see, but when you get there and
come to that sign where is said, "NEGRO TURN", well, you
naturally turn off and go all the way round his plantation. 
That was Mister White.
