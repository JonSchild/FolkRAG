I soon shall hear the awful sound,
Awake, ye nations underground,
Arise and drop your dying shrouds,
And meet King Jesus in the clouds.

Then I shall see my blessed God,
And Praise Him in His bright abode,
My theme in blest eternity,
Shall glory, glory, glory be!

BRETHREN, WE HAVE MET AGAIN

Brethren, we have met again,
Let us join to pray and sing,
Jesus as the Savior reigns,
Praise Him in the highest strain.

Many days and weeks are past,
Since we met together last,
Yet our lives do still remain,
Here on earth we meet again.

Brethren, tell us how you do,
Does your love continue true?
Are you waiting for your King?
When He shall return again?

Gracious is the Lord indeed,
To my soul in time of need,
Surely He hath won my heart,
May I choose Him for my part?

Jesus is my glorious King.
