ADVENTURES
BLOOMINGTON AND LOS ANGELES

him to such a degree that he added:
"If you will stay up to remind me, I'll wire the dispatcher at
every stop we make throughout the night. Maybe I'll impress him with
your importance."
It was then past midnight. I was tired and needed rest. But
there was no sleep for me. As the conductor swung off at every stop,
I was at his elbow to remind him of his promise. Two or three hours
passed and he came to me smiling.
"I've found another passenger who also wishes to go to Bloomington,
so my wire now mentions the two of you. Don't worry, for your
chances look better."
But no reply came from the Chicago dispatcher. I hunted up the
other man going my way. He was a drummer hurrying home to spend Thanksgiving
with his family. We talked the night through, as we wondered about
our train. Dawn was just breaking as the train rolled into the big
Indianapolis station. Our friend, the conductor, directed that we stand
on the steps, bags in hand, to be ready to jump off and make a run for
it. Amidst the clanging of bells and the cheerful early morning roar
of the station I heard, coming from a group of men swinging lanterns, a
cheerful and happy call. "This way! Hurry up, you Bloomington passengers.
The train can wait no longer."
I ran and ran with two heavy suitcases, up one flight of stairs,
down another - ran until I reached the blessed refuge of a day-coach
headed south, and, breathless, fell exhausted into a seat. The telegrams
had done their work. I had made my Bloomington train.
