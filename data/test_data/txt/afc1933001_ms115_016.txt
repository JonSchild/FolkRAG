playing, in which the drum rhythm is predominant, that was forerunner o
of the more highly developed and sophisticated
"blues" accompaniments so popular over the South today.
6) A miscellaneous set of spirituals, ragtime songs, ballads,
and a few stories completed this group of records.
We felt when left St. Simons island that we had turned back
time forty or fifty years and heard and recorded
some genuine Afro-American folk-music of the middle of the nineteenth
century.
Our next stop was in Eatonville, Florida, where Miss Hurston was
born and brought up.  [Eatonville was the first incorporated Negro town in American and for the reason, has a different sort of life 
than any other community Negro community I have so far visited.]
Miss Hurston introduced us there to the finest Negro guitarist I have heard so far, better even than Lead Belly although of a slightly
different breed.  His records along with a more usual group
of spiritual, and work-songs, and childrens games were made up and we
moved on to Belle Glade on Lake Okeechobee in the Everglades.

About ten or fifteen years ago the Government drained this section
of the everglades and opened it up for farming.  The soil is
rick, black muck, so acid that it burns a sensitive skin, and
out of this soil you can almost see the plants as
they grow. In the bean-picking season, for let it be known
that this section of the world furnishes most of the beans and
cabbages for the Northern markets in the winter, Bella Glade, a town
of two or three thousand inhabitants, swarms with from ten to fifteen
thousand workers from all over the South.  Most of these are Negroes.
And folk-songs are as thick as marsh mosquitoes.  For the first 
three or four days we recorded work-songs, ballads, spirituals of the
usual sort, them Miss Hurston introduced us into a 
small community of Bahaman Negroes.  We then heard our
first fire-dances and for the first time, although we and
other collectors and searched the South, and the heavy, exciting rhythm
of a drum.  The dances and the songs were the closest to African I
had ever heard in America.  These, along with a set of spirituals and
chanties new to me, we recorded and then moved on to Miami for a 
little rest.

Up to this time we had mad about ninety records, [of the most interesting
and valuable sort] In Miami [after discussing] we decided [to]
that the only thing for us to do was to make a visit, however, 
brief, to the Bahamas where we could hear the fire
dances in their own country.  Here we came and here
we have remained ever since [charmed] bewitched by 
these fairy islands and busy recording the livest and 
most varied folk-culture we had yet run into. Miss
