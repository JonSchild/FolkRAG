April 12  1934

My dear Dr. Lomax:

Your note of April 3rd reached me duly, and Mr. Engel has
told me of one to him.

The letters, identical in form with that to the Lieutenant
Governor of Texas, were sent off a couple of days ago addressed to
the Governors of the four states you mentioned, that is, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.  As I did not know your precise
itinerary, I fear that they will reach the recipients considerably
ahead of your visits to them.  However, as you did not suggest that
they be delayed or sent to you for later transmittal, we did not 
hold them back.

As to Representative Kleberg, Mr. Engel understood that you
had already been in touch with his brother in direct charge of the
ranch and were getting all the facilities that you needed, so that
in talking with the Representative he thought it necessary to no
more than express our sense of the importance of the field, and 
appreciation of the courtesies granted.

Very sincerely yours,

Librarian
