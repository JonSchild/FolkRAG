July 1, 1938.

Mr. Paul Brewster,
c/o Dr. Stith Thompson,
University of Indiana,
Bloomington, Indiana.

Dear Paul:

Would it be possible for you to send me the
words to the Ballad of Stone River and the
other songs that the Parkses sent in to you?
Besides these, I would appreciate the texts
of Mrs. Bryant's, Mr. Kirk's, Mr. Swallow's
and Mrs. Hopkins' songs.

If you are not able to have them copied yourself
in the department, I could have this done
here in the Library; and of course the songs
will be restricted until you have published
your thesis.

I saw Bob Allen the other day and he told me
about your new job in the University of
Missouri.

This summer I am to work in the Lake States,
with the possibility, perhaps, of coming by
Bloomington for a short visit. I hope to see
you then. With my best regards, I am

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
