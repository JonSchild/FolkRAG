Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

When I wired you some time ago about your
proposed trip to Washington, I did so in good
faith. I am writing now to tell you that we are
as enthusiastic as ever about the idea. It is
being held up because it is quite unusual and
there seems to be some difficulty in finding the
funds with which to finance it. I do not believe
that this can take much longer to settle and I must
beg your indulgence for a little while longer.

I suppose that you have heard by now that we
at last received the grant from the Carnegie Corporation.
This grant is for equipment and engineering
staff only. Since it includes funds for portable
equipment, I expect to be able to furnish you with
a brand new machine.

I realize that this delay must be irksome to
you but believe me when I say that I have done and
am doing everything I can to hasten matters along.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
