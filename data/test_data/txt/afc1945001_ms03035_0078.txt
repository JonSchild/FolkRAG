Rumor: A member of a club at a luncheon in the Fisher Building stated that he
had been given good information that there was absolutely no tire 
shortage necessary; that we have plenty of tires and rubber to last
five years if the Government would quit playing politics with the large
rubber companies and allow the synthetic rubber to be produced.  He
stated that one could buy all the tires if the right parties were 
contacted and the gas rationing was merely a bluff and would never be
put into effect in Michigan, and he said that one had to but look at
the traffic which is just as heavy now as it had ever been and no one
even the officials themselves were paying any attention to the
Government's request to conserve on tires and rubber.  This man was a
small manufacturer and failed after war was declared due to the fact
that he could not get materials.  He seemed to be a good citizen with
possibly a little bitterness thru his recent experience.

Rumor: On Saturday, October 10, at approximately 1 p.m., a customer of a 
small establishment remarked to a sales clerk that America was losing
this war fast; that all the talk about our cooperation with England
was unfounded; that the English and Americans were not cooperating; that
the public was not given half the facts regarding our defeats.  He stated
that thru letters from friends and relatives who went overseas and in
positions in Washington claim that this was mostly due to the difference
between our higher civil officials and Army officers.  These officers who
were approximately 10,000 strong in Washington and about 70% of them arm-chair
pencil-pushers who never saw any actual service knew little or 
nothing regarding how the war should be won or otherwise.  These 70% being
in position to dictate to industry and higher ranking Army officers has 
created an ill will and lack of morale between these two all-important
bodies.  Therefore hampering the old combat men from performing their
duties as they should be in time of war.  The claim is that this 70% is 
past clothing clerks, grocery store managers, etc., who merely got their
Army rating thru their college degree only.
