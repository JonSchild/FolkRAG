Mr. Moady Boatright, 
c/o J. Frank Dobie, 
University of Texas, 
Austin, Texas. 

Dear Mr. Boatright:

A few days ago I learned from Dr Rainey that a 
student in the University had done a thesis on the Czech 
Folk-Lore in Texas. I have written him asking his co-sponsorship 
of a nation-wide survey of Czech Folk-Lore music to be 
carried out by a Czech Folk-Lore Music Specialist, Mrs. Jakobson. 
She is a brilliant and extremely competent woman, from all 
accounts one of the best young people in the whole field of 
Folk-Lore.

Before I proceed to push her project further, however, 
I should like to know what your student has done in this 
field. Therefore, I wonder if you could send me a copy of the 
thesis for a few days so I can decide whether Mrs. Jakobson's
work would be duplicating anything that has already been done 
by your student. I have an idea that her special interest, 
which is the study of American Czech community from the point 
of view of Folk Music, would in any way conflict with the work 
that has already been done.

Naturally, this thesis would not leave my hands if 
you will send it to me.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax,
Information Specialist.
