Frank Duffy, exchange student to 
Colombia, is using an [A] Library 
machine to [record his] assist him 
in his study of the survival of the traditional 
Spanish Ballad in the uplands of that country.

Dr. Luis Hector de Acovedo, 
professor of folk lore at the Univ. 
of Rio de Janeiro, has been 
at work for some months with 
an Archive machine in Brazil.

On the side of exchange of materials 
with Latin American institutions 
leaving the Archive has been most 
active. The [Distoc] Discoteca of the 
city of Sao Paulo has made copies 
of two hundred folk song records in 
their files [for] in exchange for a 
similar set of materials from 
our collections. This exchange sets 
a precedent which we hope will 
be continued.
