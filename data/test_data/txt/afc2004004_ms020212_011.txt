Dear Ed:
I hope by the time you come East you can have a fairly definite 
list of things I can discuss with Bessie and the group.
This is mostly my fault, because I haven't had time to work
for them.

About the television show, I am a little bit peeved at the
naivity you and Charlie both exhibited in calling me before
you had done any checking with the networks. It's no news
that any network would buy any show with Joan Baez.

By all means let's meet when you come but let's confine our
conversations to a couple of practical proposals like putting
a proper, small company on the road next spring because this is
the package that will build into something real. The trouble
with American amusement enterprise is that most of the work
goes on in smoke-filled rooms without thinking out the basic
artistic problems. This bad American habit is now having its
normal bad effects on folk music.

I'll look forward to our meeting next month.
Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
