their bodies backward and forwards till they were in
perfect rhythm. Then the leader began a slow
waulking song, singing a verse line, the rest taking
up the chorus, each moving her handful of cloth to
her neighbour, her neighbour doing likewise, thus
keeping the cloth moving slowly round the table in
perfect time with the song. The song might be a 
love-song or one describing heroic deeds, or exploits
at sea, but the music of them all is old and the verses
full of poetic expressions.

After the first slow song, a livelier song followed
and then a third, when the women of the house measured
the cloth across its width in finger-lengths to find
out how much it had shrunk.

When it was think [n crossed out] enough, the web was rolled up
and clapped to a merry song and the waulking was
finished.

This is a slow waulking song:
  "On Saturday I was mournful
   On Monday I made my lamentation
   Closing the eye which was beautiful
   Composing the mouth which was shapely
   Raising the sails on the galley
   Sailing from the land of the best-grass
   Where could be heard the sound of the sand
        on the window pane.

WAULKING SONG [underlined, indented]

And here is a livelier waulking song:
  "I will not go, not I
   With the son of the Steward
   He is a foolish lad.
   Give me the lad of the brown ringlets,
   Who would lie in the heather
   And kill the plover and the grouse
   And the slender-necked wild duck"  "CHA TEID MISE" [underlined]
