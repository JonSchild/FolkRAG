I HATE THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM

"Well, what killed your mother?"
I hear some capitalist say,
'Twas the debt of hard work and starvation
My mother had to pay.

"Oh, what killed your mother?
Oh, tell us if you please."
"Excuse me, it was pellegra
That starvation did breed."

They call this a land of plenty,
To them I guess it's true;
But that's to the rich old capitalists,
Not workers like me and you.

Oh, what can you do about it,
To these men of power and might?
I tell you, Mr. Capitalist,
I'm going to fight, fight, fight.
