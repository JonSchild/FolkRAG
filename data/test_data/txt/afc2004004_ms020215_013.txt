BJ TAPE 2, p. 11

BJ:     (Cont.) "Well, he, he sent word for you to do it," an' they
asked Naman to do it.  And so Naman obeyed and said, well, he'd 
go an' do it, ya know, but he still wanted him to come an' talk
to him 'cause he was as big as he was; he wanted to talk to him.
     He went on out, down to the Jordan, an' he dipped seven
times.  An' he come out, an' he dipped on the seventh [thim] time,
all the spots was off 'im.  See?  He didn't have anymore white
spots on 'im.
     So he come back in to Elisha to pay 'im.  All this fine stuff
he had brought with him, ya know -- jewelry and fragments -- we
call it fringes (frankinsense?) -- an' diffrunt things, an' gold
an' silver.  He wanted to pay 'im.  An Elisha sent a word out
an' he didn't charge 'im anything.  Ya see.  Sent word again, to
his maid, by his servant, that he didn't charge 'im anything.
     An' then, um, so he, he wouldn't pay him. So he drove on.
Him an' his men drove on back, started on back to their country, an'
one of Elijah's men, ya see, tha's why somebody always, sometimes,
they got a diffrunt heart -- out of a crowd, all a ya ain' gonna
have the same mind, ideas an' , an' ah, the devil pricked him jus'
like he did with Judas.
     The devil pricked him to go an' tell a story on his master,
on Elisha. Went all the way around, got on his camel an' went on
around an' overtaken Naman, an' told Naman that Elisha decided that
he would take the price of the, of, for the healin', ya see?
An' Naman was willin' to give it.  He said, "All right," he give
it to the servant.  Give him a lot of stuff, ya know. An' costly
stuff. 
     He carried it back to Elisha and tol' Elisha that that was.
