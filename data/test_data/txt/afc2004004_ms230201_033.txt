man, they don't call him bad, see, they say he's
gone nuts.  And his own people say he's crazy because
he fight the white man.
The Kid:  But we did have bad Negroes among us. . .
Natchez:  Yeah, but I'm talkin' 'bout the one that white man call
bad, a bad seed among the Negroes, a seed that would
ruin the rest of the Negroes.  You understand my point
now?  He would open the eyes of a lot of Negroes
and tell 'em things they didn't know.
The Kid    Otherwise he was a smart Negro.
Natchez:  Yeah, he would go around and git the Chicago Defender
and bring it down there, you know what I mena?  Git
it down there and read it to the Negroes. . .
The Kid:  Speakin' of the Chicago Defender, I were in a place
once called Marigold, Mississippi.  They had a restaurant
there and in the back they had a peephole.  I
thought they were gamblin' back there or something
and I went back there to see.  Fact, I was kind of
 stranded.  I wanted to go back there and shoot a little
craps and make me a little stake.
Natchez:  Unh-hunh.
The Kid:  An' you can imagine what they were doin' back there.
They were readin' the Chicago Defender and had a man
on the door!  A lookout man!  A lookout man at that
peephole an' if a white man come in the restaurant,
they'd stick the Defender in the stove.
Natchez:  Yeah.
The Kid:  Burn it up.
