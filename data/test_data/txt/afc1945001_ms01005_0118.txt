Attached letter from Major Mann

  The study referred to in Mannâ€™s letter attached is a Surveys
Division study which will be released on September 14th.

  My suggestion is that this not be released in the War Department
until the Bureau survey on rumors is completed (approximately
September 29th), at which time it can be supplied to them in a proper
context.
