THE NEW MARTINS AND COYS

O, the Martins and the Coys have quit their feuding:
They don't live in West Virginia any more.
You won't never find them in 'cause they're headed for Berling
And they're fighting in a different kind of war.

Chorus: O, the Martins and the Coys, they were reckless mountain boys,
And they'd take up fam'ly feuding when they'd meet.
But now for the duration they have changed their occupation
And they're fighting side by side till Hitler's beat.

Mister Coy shook hands with Mister Martin, 
He said, "We won't be safe till Hitler's through, 
So suppose we call a truce until we cook his good
'Cause I hate him even worse than I hate you." Chorus:

And then up spoke old Grandpappy Martin
His whiskers waving proudly in the breeze, 
"If I have to capture Tokio, I guess that's Okey-dokeyo.
I'm just waiting till they send me overseas."  Chorus:

Then up spoke little cousin Abner
He's been drunk since eighteen ninety-eight,
He said, "Boys, I'm staying sober until the shooting's over,
So if you don't mind, I'll take my water straight."  Chorus:

Uncle Charlie Coy was sleeping in the henhouse
But he jumped up when he heard the bugle call;
Now he's over in the Alps and he's hunting Hitler's scalp,
'Cause he wants that mustache hanging on the wall.  Chorus:

Now good people, this all points a lesson,
What the Martins and the Coys agreed to do;
They've given up their feuding for another kind of shooting
And if they can do it, I guess that we can too.  Chorus:
