Git Along, Little Dogies - 3
From "This Singing Country"
By John and Alan Lomax.

a fashion that astonished and fascinated me. And here close by sat
this pearl of a woman, dressed like a princess, strumming her guitar
and singing the songs of gypsy life.

She despised the clumsy horn fastened to my recording machine,
and I caught few of the tunes. I remember that she sang me the first
blues that I had ever heard, moving me almost to tears; and a pathetic
ballad of a factory girl, who got splinters in her toes. Many and many 
another she sang that, unhappily, are gone with the Texas wind.

Whoopee ti yi yo, git along, little dogies,
It's your misfortune and none of my own.

I had never before heard it.

"To me", she said, "that's the loveliest of all cowboy songs.
Like others, its rhythm comes from the movement of a horse. It is not
the roisterous, hell-for-leather, wild gallop of 'The Old Chisholm
Trail,' nor the slow easy canter of 'Goodby Old Paint'. You mustn't
frighten the dogies. They get nervous in crowds. Lope around them
gnetly in the darkness as you sing about punching them along to their
new home in Wyoming. They'll sleep the night through and never have
a bad dream."

This is the story of the first recording of this now famous
cowboy tune. The gypsy woman's song has been sung over the air thousands
of times, and we wonder whether she chuckled somewhere in a gypsy
tent when Billy Hill's almost notorious "The Last Roundup" was on the
air every day and night.

In the meantime we have recorded two tunes which show that
"Whoopee-ti-yi-yo" has wandered as far afield and disguised itself as
subtly as any gypsy.
