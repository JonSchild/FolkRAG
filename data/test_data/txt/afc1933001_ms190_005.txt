Dear Mr. Pipes:

     I have been much delayed in preparing the fellowship
application for Rosenwald because I had first to find out whether
gas and tires could be had for your work except by approach to 
local boards. It appears that I will not be able to arrange for
anyone to apply from Washington in behalf of these fellowships
and so I have had to revise my plans considerably. It may be
that this necessary delay will bring my letter to Rosenwald too
late. If that is so, please understand that I have been pushing
this whole matter just as hard as I could, but the wheels of 
government sometimes grind slowly.

     I am, by the way, suggesting to Rosenwald that in view
of the gas and tire situation, each fellow confine his work to a
complete study of the folklore of one county against the background
of the social history of the county. From what I have
heard from you, that sort of project would interest you a good
deal. I figured that you could get around in a rural area without
needing to use a car very much, somewhere in Mississippi, 
Alabama, or Louisiana. What's your reaction?

     I hope to hear from you soon.

     Sincerely yours,

     Alan Lomax
