It was a midnight on the sea,
Band playin' "Nearer My God to Thee." * 
Cryin' fare thee Titanic, fare thee well.

When the women got out on the land, 
Cryin', "Lawd have mercy on my man." 
Cryin' fare thee Titanic fare thee well.

Never lost a girl or either a boy, 
Cryin' fare thee, Titanic fare thee well.
