Business matters - I tried to register Miss Dunham's
dissertation or to insure it, they refused to accept
it at the Post Office, saying that in the absence of "special
packing" which they could not explain clearly to me it had to
go by regular mail. Do you want me to risk it that way ?

When shall I get the records ?  How much do they
charge me ?  I have tried to suggest something about buying
some Hatian records to the Secretary of the Ecole des Hautes
Etudes, as he has not answered immediately I will put them to
my account, you know that I am not very good at begging.
Speaking of records, will you please erase the check marks I
had made in pencil to the file cards of the Marassa and the
Erzulie songs of the Cay Florvil ceremony : they are personal
marks I forgot to take out, I wanted those songs on a record
to write them down and may be harmonize them later on. 
I will probably some day, when the War is over, if I am alive.

Always sincerely yours,
Suzanne Comhaire-Sylvain
