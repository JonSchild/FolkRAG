and Jews pushed out of control of the Army. The Catholic chaplains are

Buffalo 8-8 (Italian-American): "The Jews got us into this war. 
They've been scheming for twenty years for all kinds of ways to make money 
on a World War like this."
Jamaica 8-5: "Want to know why New York doesn't get more war contracts? 
Because the War Department knows Jews control so much New York 
business, and the Generals hate the Jews."

Buffalo 8-6 (German-American): "The Jews are to blame for this war, 
and Roosevelt loves them. Look who he's got surrounding him-- Henderson, 
Perkins, Morgenthau, Ickes-- they're all Jews. So is Senator Wagner."

Yonkers 8-7 (German-American grocer): "Henderson is a Jew. He
fixes it so decent businessmen have to close up and their businesses can
be bought up cheap by rich Jews."

Buffalo 8-4 (German-American): "It's not nice to say, but the 
sooner we get rid of the Jews in this country, the better off we will be. 
Did you ever hear of a Jew willing to fight? They make the money, and we 
do all the fighting?"

New York 8-5 (In Yorkville section, predominantly German-American): 
"All the big men who control the money in Washington are Jews. Yes, Jesse 
Jones is half Jewish and besides he has a million dollars of his own money
invested in businesses in Palestine."

New York 8-7: "In Australia the Army is putting Negro soldiers 
up front to shield the whites. The Japanese wouldn't do that."
