Dear Mr. Lomax:

   Thanks for your letter and your expressions
of interest.  I feel quite happy about the tone of
your words.  You are right.  My work does not
belong to this period.  I am always either too early
or too late.  My compositions grow out of my
experience, and my wheels grind slowly.
   Still, I want to circumscribe your final sentence
with a query.  It said:  "It seems to me
that for the moment we need songs which are
simple and direct and courageous, rather than
subtly exploratory."
   To me there is nothing contradictory in "simplicity"
and "subtlety."  I also feel that the number
of tones used int he octave has nothing to do
with these terms -- that it is quite as possible to be
simple, direct and courageous in 43 tones as 12.
If we wake up tomorrow morning very poor we
can only blame ourselves for entertaining only
what we feel we need at the moment.
   I am happy in my octave, not awkward,
and the fact that I have not created a stir
in eighteen years of using it dispels the suspicion
that I use it for any possible sensationalism
