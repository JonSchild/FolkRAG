MARCHING SONG
Tune: Tramp, tramp, tramp

In our poverty and toil
Looking out upon the world
We can see the gathering armies of the Cause:
And we feel ourselves a part
Of the new resistless power,
That shall sweep away oppression and its laws.

Chrous:

Tramp, tramp, tramp, you hear us marching,
Millions now are on the way
And our army ne'er shall pause
Till the right to live is ours
And the sun has risen on a fairer day.

In the days that are to be,
When the Cuase we love iswon
We shall labor for ourselves and for our own
Each for all, and all for each;
And through many joyful years
We shall pluck the fruit that brothers brave have sown.

THE HOPE OF THE WORLD
Tune Red, White, and Blue

Whether leading the van of the fighters
In the bitterest stress of the strife,
Or patiently beari[g]ng the burden
of changelessly commonplace life,
One hope we have ever before us,
One aim to attain and fulfill
One watchword we cherish to mark us,
One kindred and brotherhood still.

Chorus:

For our banner is raised and unfurled
And our message before [i]us is hurled;
And our cry is the cry of the agew--
Our hope is hope of the world.

What matter if failure on failure
Crwod closely upon us and press
When a hundred have bravely been beaten,
The hundred and first wins success.
Our watchword is freedom: new soldie[4]rs
Flock each day where her flag is unfurled
Our cry i[w]s the [v]cry of the ages
Our hope is the hope of the world.
