Dear Mr. Lomax,

Many thanks for
your nice letter which I received
and I am very pleased that our
songs and conversation have been
so well appreciated and I hope that
it won't be long till you will be 
back again to Barra. We did not hear
any of the songs that we recorded in
the B. B. C. so far I hope you will let me
know when it will be on as I would like
very much to hear what we were saying
that night we had the belidh, for they all
enjoyed it. Kindest regards from us both.

Thanking you again
Yours Sincerely
Mary Gillies
