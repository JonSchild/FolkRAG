if in any way possible, and hope
even to see Henry Trevellian. Also
will take the notes and exercise
every care to get good recordings
of the cream.  Tell me more
about Isum and Charlie Lorentz
I'll be in arkansas. Will make
Galax, too.
   Mr. Halpart's criticisms of us
wont get him no folk songs. Rather
than worry, rejoice that we seem
to be shining targets. That shows we
are in the map, doesn't it. Perhaps
that's  what worries. Any back talk 
weakens your case. When you
get faint-hearted read our Felix
Green's letter.
   I think I am permanently
sensitive about our correspondence.
If my letters are not worth answering
I have no heart to multiply them. I
will not become a bother.
Lovingly,
Father.
