Professor J. A. Rickard
Texas College of Arts and Industries
Kingsville, Texas

Dear Professor Rickard:

     We sincerely regret the delay in getting your
duplicates of the recordings which you helped Mr.
Lomax get. As you probably know, we recently
received a grant from the Carnegie Corporation for
recording equipment which is now in the process of
installation. For this reason I feel quite sure
that we shall be able to send you duplicates of the
recordings in about two or three weeks. The new
equipment being installed, when complete, will be
rather elaborate. For this reason, I am sure there 
will be no such delays in the future so let me
thank you now for your past cooperation and express
the hope that we will have many more opportunities
of working with you.
Your truly,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
