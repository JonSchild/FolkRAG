There is cheese che ese, that brings you to your knees
In the store, in the store
There is cheese, cheese , that brings you to your knees
In the Quarter-master's store.

There is tea, tea, but not for you and me....

There are beans, beans, that make you feel your jeans....

There are rats, rats, in bowler hats and spats

(There is gin, gin, that makes you want to sin...)

Who's been there since I've been gone
Pretty little girl with the red dress on //

Pretty little girl with the red dress on - //
Left me to here to sing this song.

Oh Howard's dead and gone
Left me here to sing this song
//
Left me here to sing this song //

(Pretty little girl with the blue dress on ....)

There is a house in this old town
And that's where my true love lays around
And he takes other women right down on his knee
And he tells them a little tale he won't tell me
        It's hard, ain't it hard, ain't it hard
        To move one that never did love you // that never will be true.
