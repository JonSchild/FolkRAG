Reverend Roe   Reel 2  p.1
R: I began--well, I asked for license topreach and they wouldn't allow
me to speak in the church but there was a woman, very sick, and she wanted
to hear service.  They sent me out there, and one of the deacons
carried me.  I rode a mule bareback.  I went out and there was a
few people around her.  So I had a song and prayer.  The old deacon prayed,
I don't remember the verse, and I [had] taken [as] for my text, I think, it's the second
chapter of James--"If there is any sick among you, call for the [help] elders
of the church.  Let them pray for you, [all of them] anointing you with oil, and [they shall] the prayers of faith shall
save the sick."  I spoke from that text; I don't remember anything I
said, it seemed like something else had holt to me, but when I kinda come to myself, I just talked.  The people was
all shedding tears all around me, and I couldn't say what I['d] had done.  The
old deacon then got ready and we went back and he told them that [priest] I preached
[that is was] just about [the finest service he ever done] as fine a sermon as he's want to hear. And then they
had me [the preacher] to preach it in the church. So[me] men came in to make fun --
it was in the Territory, Indian Territory, and [it] the people was awful wild
up there. They taken seat in front of the pulpit -- "We're gonna have
some fun out of him." And I taken one of them [out of the pulpit] in the church that night.
A:  [They} These were some white men or were these all colored.
R: Oh those, they were colored, Indian, 1/2 Indian [they been there a long time]. 
Well then they tried to call me to [their] that church but I wouldn't accept
it because the man that was pastoring [there], you know, he [likes for] license
 me to preach and I wouldn't accept the church. Then I returned back home
because I was said to be the best preacher up in that part of the
country and I knew that was no place for me. I had to be where
there was something for me to [preach about] reach up after. I come on back to Texas but
let me tell you this story...
There was something happened [there] just before I left there that I have never
been able to understand. Now you have to make a monthly report the
