Dear Alan Lomax:

Enclosed are two cassettes containing copies of portions of your Haitian
collection.  These cassettes were made from our reference copies of the
preservation tapes of your discs, i.e., three removes from your originals.
Each cassette side includes one or more of the items for which you have
requested the best possible phonoduplication work by the Library's Recording
Laboratory.  These cassettes should, therefore, help you assess how much
improvement is possible.  (The phonoduplication order is now with the
Recording Lab staff;  they will be contacting you for prepayment, etc.)

I wasn't able to listen to all of the material on the enclosed
cassettes, but what I did hear certainly sounds like it has potential for a
commercial release.  Exciting material!

I am concerned, however, about the discrepancy between the numberings on
your list and the AFS numbers we have.  For example, you listed "Sobagi Solo
garde" as AFS 1095:A1.  That number, however, goes with "M'ce toro m'ape
gronde."  I found "Sobagi . . ." at AFS 1913:A1.  Likewise, the "Miserere/Gloria 
Patri" and "Diploye dropeaux" are on AFS 1932:B1-B2, rather than on AFS 1114.
And "Erzulie-o" and "Ala un belle" are on AFS 1078 rather than on AFS 1134.
So we're definitely working from different sequences which will need to be
cross-listed.  There's not a one-to-one concordance, alas.   (I located the
numbers here by looking through all the item-level cards in a catalog-card
drawer and checked them against the actual tapes.)  Do you, by chance, have a
list that shows both number sequences?

Also enclosed, in response to your request, is a copy of the issue of
CRM (Cultural Resources Management, published by the Park Service) that 
includes my article about some of the realities of the Federal Cylinder
Project dissemination process.

Best wishes,
