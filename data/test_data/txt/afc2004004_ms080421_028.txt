Fr: Let's hear your story on it.

RH: Well, uh, that was a, they was, was close on it,
the way I now it. All 'at was that was left out--that there, Ann
Milton, had wrote a letter to Laurie like which they'd knowed it and
didn't think it probably, like Tom Dooley wrote it. She hid there
and it killed her, the way I heared it now. Like Tom Dooley had
wrote the letter to meet him there.

FP: Wrote it to Laura.

FH: Yeah, wrote it to Laura, and she thought she's meetin'
Tom..

Fr: To marry 'im?

RH: Yeah, just to be together, know he hadn't been back long,
the side of an old pine field. And she stobbed her and killed her,
and Tom took the blame, said her neck was too purty to stretch,
Ann Milton's was.

EP: Didn't Ann Milton say that instead--

RH: Maybe /it was Ann Milton said that, yeah--

EP: ... her neck was too pretty to put a rope around.

RH: Yeah, her ... maybe that's the way it was now.

EP: The way it always is.

RH: And they a--

EP: I don't know how it was, it could have been ...

RH: And so, uh, in helpin' her now, now this, now this
come up in the, in tryin' to find her body. They hid it you know.
And so they'd give it up. And there's an old, was a woman 'at told
fortunes with a teacup with coffee grounds in it, and they figured
to go get her to put a, a plot on it, and she put the grounds in it
