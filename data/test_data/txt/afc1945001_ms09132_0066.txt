F. N. F.

1. A lady after waiting an hour in line to get her
sugar with her ration stamps was very much sur-
prised to learn that she had to pay for the sugar.

2. When asked how much sugar she had on hand
a lady at the sugar ration board said "About
two or three pounds." The clerk was very much
amused as the lady had been the first to
admit that she had any at all on hand.
