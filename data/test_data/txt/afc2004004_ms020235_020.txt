wanted...I ain' took care a him!" (??)
     He's a piana player, too, an' a dancer an' a fisherman.
He could go out, carry white folks out to fish. That's all he
did do like work. Except piano playin'. He played the piano
for anybody, ya know. An' like parties, anything. He could
leave the piano up, I'm tellin' ya.
TL: He was good at it, huh?
BJ: Oh, boy! he was.
TL: Did you like to watch him play?
BJ: Um-hum.
TL: Did you sing with him, Bessie?
BJ: Oh, yeah.
TL: Did you?
BJ: Um-hum.
TL: At the parties?
BJ: At some parties, um-hum. An' so, but anyway, ah, [um,] he
still was sendin' me messages. I didn' know 'im. I'd tell the
girls, "I don't know nothin' 'bout him." Said, "I don't believe
I never seen 'im."
     "Oh, I heard you, ah, you gonna work with him." You know,
kinda had me all like that. So I didn't know 'im.
     So that one Thursday, I comin' in home from work on Thursday
evenin' an' he was sittin' at our house. 'Cause he, he knew, he knewed,
ah, the boy that went with my friend. He knewed him. That's why
he would send the message by. An' so...An' he, he was sittin' at 
our house. An' sittin' there, sittin' there talkin'. And ah, I
walked in and my mind said, "That's that -- that's him." Right
there when I walked in the house. It's just in my mind, "That
must be him sittin' there."
