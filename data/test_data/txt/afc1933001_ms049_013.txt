Dear Mrs. Wilson:

I enclose a letter concerning your program which I trust may be helpful to you in securing a hearing of your interesting group of Negroes. I hope you won't mind a few suggestions from me:

1. The tune used in the crap shooting beginning does not seem to me Negro music.

2. Some of your spirituals are widely sung. Why not include only those peculiar to your section?

3. Your audiences will generally be far more interested in the primitive elements of the singing than in the beauty and finish of the program.

4. Omit all "white folks" music except the old long meter tunes.

5. Probably too much clapping is employed. and it begins too early in the program to be most dramatically effective.

6. Somewhere in your program you should include some of the beautiful work songs sung in the fields; also some of the "hollers".

It is easy, I know, to criticize. You will know best if my suggestions are feasible

Sincerely yours,

JAL:ep
