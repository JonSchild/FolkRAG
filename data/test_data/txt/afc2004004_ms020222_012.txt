BJ:  Yeah!  Go over to the Hard-Shelled an' all churches.  I, I
like to go to all churches anyway.  Those what'll allow ya in.
Some churches don't 'low ya in.  You know?
TL:  Oh no.  What about that?
BJ:  Oh, yeah!  Some...Even if ya ain't...Like I tol' ya about

ain't already theirs'n or either come, come, come to be
theirs'n.  They figure you jus' comin' there.  You's a fault
person in they, in' they [(shut ya out ?)] church.  So that's
