A  You know, Mark, I've been looking in the last
few years at, at musical patterns from the 
whole world, and ah, learning ho - just how
distinctive the one that I carry - because
I'm of Scots-Irish descent too, and I'm 
Southern - ah, how distinctive it, it, it
really is.  Cos no other part of the world in
which people have cultivated to such an extent
the art of singing in solo long narrative
songs of extremely comples um, ah, um,
structure, and ah playing ah, ah, solo
instruments.  That's about what the Scots-Irish
had, a solo singing tradition, focused
on ah, ah, clear tunes and subtle ah narrative
texts.  Ah, they had used that to develop the
- a great ballad tradition and a great
tradition of love songs, and nonsense songs,
and dance songs, and their dance tradition
was, was largely solo, ah, with a late
intrusion of um. of group dancing that came
from Europe which they had preceded to
develop into their, their main form of ah
courting and socialising and celebrating on
ah Saturday nigth, on occasions of leisure.
This is what they had.
