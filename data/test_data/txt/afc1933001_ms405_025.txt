was twelve and knew all the old tunes especially the "funny" ones; the three 
boys, who mostly sang the blues, the cowboy songs, and the jailhouse ballads; 
Mr. Gant, who had one song, "Bangus and the Boar," over which his rights were

"The singing kept us so happy, we just couldn't go to sleep,"

Gant songs in this book: "Tee Roo," "Adieu to the Stone Walls," 
"Black Jack Davy," "When First to This Country a Stranger I Came."
