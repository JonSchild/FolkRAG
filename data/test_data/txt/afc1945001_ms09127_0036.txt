1.  Their has been a great rumor about
the rationing of clothes, last week my mothers
best friend was shopping in one of the
loop stores and said she saw a woman
buy about fifty house dresses none of which
were her size. 
2.  Before the rationing of canned goods took
affect my mother was in the neighborhood
A + P and saw a man buy $125.00 worth
of assorted canned goods telling the clerk 
that he would bet her that he would be 
caught with the rationing of which wouldn't 
then bother him. 
3.  One of the girls in our History Class this
morning was telling us of how a doctor
who lives a block away from her home,
bought many gallons of gasoline before 
the rationing came on and saying that 
he wanted to be a step ahead of the
government, last week his house caught
on fire while he was on a call and
before the fireman could get their the
house which was a two story flat was 
turned into ashes and found only the 
empty gallons existing,     [*Folder 127*]
