[*FIle*] [* pers*]

Dear Alan -
This time I've delayed in writing to be able to tell you 
in the same letter that the money has come - it hasn't [*it has*] and 
I hope to god nothing has gone amiss.

I've just arranged for Huddie to go up to the country for a 
week or two, where he won't be asked to sing, except by the 
trees, adn I think he'll have a good time, and, I hope, finish 
off the cure [*too bad -, he can't go anyway - has to go 
to doctor's for check up.*]

I suppose that by now you've received my letter telling
of Jelly Roll's death. I'm enclosing a few clippings -
I know I'm a sentimentalist of a pretty bad
sort but I felt awfully bad about it.

Also enclosed is the prospectus of the Dollar Top Theater.
Briefly, the story is this - Kazan and Lewis aren't satisfied
with Metz's job, to date. Kazan still thinks BWICF the best
program he's ever heard on the air. He wants us to work on
their radio project together and see if we can't find a frame
that will be more commercial than ours was - for ultimately
they want to sell it, of course, and utilize radio income to
tide the theatre over bad spots should there be any - which
of course there will. However you may think about it - there
is this - it is an indication of the thoroughness with which
these guys have gone ahead in starting this theater and I
think it's going to work. Ifit does, besides the radio, it
may be a way to do a good stage musical with them some day.
I couldn't make any committment for you, naturally - but they
know how I feel about you being part of the radio set-up
should they give us the go ahead sign. I haven't committed myself,
either - except I'm playing records for them tomorrow night -
because if there's a chance of our going on a field trip together,
that's what I want to do more than anything else in the world.

My need for getting out of New York for a while has become almost
as important to me as the need to quit drinking was - except I
had to do the letter before I could realize the importance of
gettingout of here. I don't suppose it's a thoroughly accomplished
fact, even yet - but the analyst feels pretty good about it. Or
maybe he just wants me to get a job so I can start giving him
some money for a change. Enough of that- but believe me - I
honest to god think I'vebegun to grow up.

How long will you be in Clarksdale, or away from Washington?
I've an outline of an idea for theprogram and I'd like to work
on it for a couple days before sending it to you. Briefly it
involves a European refugee - a Woodrow Davy Wilson Crockett
Guthrie - a gal who can sing I Know Where I'm Goin', & Darlin'
Corey - a city Partnowish character - and others - in a metropolitan
night school. The European bunks with Davy and is
a nice guy and very funny because hetells the truth and asks
unsophisticated questions, such as "This is a democracy, no?----
Then why's this officer beating me over the head?"
