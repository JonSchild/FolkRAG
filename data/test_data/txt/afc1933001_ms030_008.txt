Mr. John A. Lomax
400 East 34th Street
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This is simply to let you know that I received a visit yesterday
from Mr. E. P. Jennings, of North Bennington, Vermont, who has just
been doing some field work among the Negroes in Central Western Alabama and
and in the neighborhood of Meridian, Mississippi. Mr. Jennings plans to
return to the South about September 1 to do a motion picture of Negro
life and expects to record some spirituals for eventual transfer to the
sound track of this picture. Since he proposed to turn these records
over to the Archive later on, I have put his in touch with Garwick and
Thompson and have suggested that he send you some account of his plans
and, if possible, look forward to seeing you here on his way South. I
should add that Mr. Jennings is anxious to take someone with him on this
trip to assist. If Alan does not care to go, perhaps you will suggest
someone else.
The Dallas News has just sent me, at your request, an account of
the Cowboy Reunion earlier this month.
Faithfully yours,
Chief Division of Music
