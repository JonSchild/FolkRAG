TO LABOR

(Tune: Old Maryland,
Page 176- Old Favorite Songs - Wanamaker)


Shall you complain who feed the world?
Who clothe the world, who house the world?
Shall you complain who are the world
Of what the world, the world may do?

As from this hour you use your power
The world must follow, follow you.
As from this hour you use your power
The world must follow, follow you.

The world's life hangs on your right hand
Your strong right hand, your skilled right hand,
You hold the whole world in your hand,
See to it what you do.

Or dark or light, or wrong or right,
The world is made, is made by you
Or dark or light, or wrong or right
The world is made, is made by you.

The rise as you ne'er rose before,
Nor hoped before, nor dared before;
And show as ne'er was shown before
The power that lies, that lies in you.

Stand all as one till right is won,
Believe and dare, and dare and do;
Stand all as one, see justice done,
Believe and dare, and dare and do.
