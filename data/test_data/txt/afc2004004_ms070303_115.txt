The ruined stronghold of the MacNeils of Barra
which stands in the landlocked bay in Barra's 
surely one of the must picturesque ruins
in Europe.  About 15th century -
grey stone, plain - Now a hollow
shell surrounding the ruins of [the] old
dwellings & stables - it commands the
principal harbor of the island and
certainly must have made a perfect
hideout for the pirates of the MacNeil
family.

Castlebay it's named.  The hills 
slope down steeply on each side -
and the two stores & the hotel stand
in the crotch of the burn - Back
on the hillsides are scattering of 
houses - perhaps a hundred and
out of them the road winds back
over the hills toward Eriscay
three miles away.
