1/5/1939.
Dear Alan: 
     The holidays have 
brought me one factor of 
rejoicing : my wounded 
leg has taken a sudden
turn for the better and will 
soon be well - so the Doctor
says;
Several mild disappointments, 
among them
1. Non-arrival of Christmas
letters voluntarily promised 
by Bess to come from you 
and from her.
