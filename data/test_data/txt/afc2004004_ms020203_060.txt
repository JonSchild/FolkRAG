got religion and didn have nothin like that(400) So I
just sit there and cry. And so my mother told me, if you
feel the Lord--"If you feel in your heart, sad and sorry and
you've got enough confidence in the Lord that you'll get in
the church and just live for him, Say, Lord I don't know
how to come to you, I don't know whichaway to get there, say,
but there's one thing I can do, I can do all that I'm told
to do here on the face of this earth in your name, that
the Bible leads me to do, and that's all that I can do is
live and be true." So that's what I did. She said, "Be in
earnes about what you do. Don't tell stories. Do everything
the best you can and be--whatever you is, be that and whatever
you do, do that. And for God sakes, be truthful and live right."
Say, "Live the best like that you can live in the world, "say,
"When you do all you can, why the Lord will take care of you--"
That's what my mother told me. Say, "He knows when you're
in earnes about a thing and he knows when you ain't. "say "if
you're in earnestly and go to him, tell him about yourself, he'll
take care of you [and so I]."
   And so I does that until this very day, I really does.
A: Well, honey you say[,] this was a revival when you began to
sit up on the mourner's bench?
V: It was. We called it a tractable meetin at that time. Say
we're carryin on tractable meetin, but uh I noticed[, a] later, since
then, the people all call it revival meeting, but our mother
and father always called it tractable meeting.
A: How long did the meeting last, honey?
V: It would last two weeks.
