dark edge of which the flat waves break
in ripples of moonlight - out across the
dim mirror the humps of mountains - 
a melancholy town, a lot of fine decaying
houses, a malarial population, but in
the moonlight this passes all the world for 
romance - the grey age of the houses
turns to silver - the blacks stand out
in the flat green wash of color like gods
or demons - view, the wind from
the sea, mountains, the noise of [wind]
waves, small waves, all one wants is

Jan 24th - In the black morning Revoli called me
gently for a half-hour when I was dreaming on
the gallery {wet with moonlight} and [I] at last
hearing the gentle call of his hands I staggered out,
dressed, heard of the infinite regrets of the gentle
brown hint & rode away [into] out of the ancient
town through the locust thickets, [the] toward
the black mountains. My nag, yellow and old, 
had her own way until the white dawn found
the little kids struggling at their mothers [feet]
shanks and I dropped from side to side
