(1) I am glad that finally declared war. There will
more jobs and higher wages for colored people.
I sure need some money

(2) There are no fools in the world. The majority
of the people commit the same mistake over
and over. Look at war. We have had them, we
are having them and we always will have them.

(3) War is nothing but a burden for the next
generation to carry. Bonds are a method
of shifting some of the finance needed to the
next generation, and of course they will be
expected to replace what has been destroyed.

(4) We don't have a thing to fight about. Hitler
isn't interested in colored people. If we lose
the white people will suffer more than we
will because colored people are used to subordination
any way. If we win the white people
have and will keep everything worthwhile.
Therefore  it doesn't make any difference to
me whether we win or lose.
