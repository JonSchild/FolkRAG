Her ever sing any before.
She tried to stand up to sing, "The Cat Pie,"
She fell down with such a clatter,
She smashed both the chairs - When the landlord come in
He says, " What the deuce is the matter."

5) O the landlord says  "Is this your wife ? Where do you belong ?"
I said,  "It is, She taken a fit with trying to sing a bit song.
He flung his arms around her waist, trailed her across the floor,
Nan, poor soul, like an old used cat was turned outside of the door.

Now there she was lying, blowing and crying, declaring she really thought shame,
I tried for to lift her, but I couldn't shift her,
I wish hat we hadna left hame.
The paperman said he would give her a ride
So we lifted her into the truck,
Now Nan was so drunk she wadna sit up,
So we fastened her down with the strap.
She wouldn't lie down and she wouldn't sit up,
She kicked and she broke the conveyance,
She lost her new basket, her hat and her shawl,
That day through losing the train.

The Gresford Disaster.

1) You've heard of the Gresford disaster,
Of the terrible price that was paid,
Two hundred and forty-two miners were lost
And three men of a rescue brigade.

2) It occured in the month of September,
At three in the morning that pit
Was wrecked by a violent explosion
In a dennis where gas lay as thick.

3) Now the gas in the dennis deep section
Was heaped there like snow in a drift,
And many a man had to leave the coal face
Before  he had worked out his shift.

4) Now a fortnight before the explosion
To the shot-firer Tomolinson cried,
"If you fire that shot we'll be all blown to hell,"
And no one can say that he lied.

5) Now the firemen's reports they are missing,
The records of forty-two days,
The colliery manager had them destroyed 
To cover his criminal ways.
