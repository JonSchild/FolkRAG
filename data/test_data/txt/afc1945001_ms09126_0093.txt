That's What I Have Been Looking For
A colored chap in Ackerdemas, Georgia, received a greeting card form the draft board.
Well, the very first day in camp the soldier boy started picking up every piece of paper he saw. He looked at it and said, "That's not it" and threw it away. His sergeant though he was crazy. But he said to himself, "He is excited; he will come around okay."
But it didn't stop. It went on for weeks and weeks. Every day the boy would pick up paper and say "That's not it." By this time every body in camp had heard about him. So the officers had a conference, and decided to give him an honorary discharge. They made it out, called him in, and gave it to him. He looked at it for a minute then yelled, "that's what I have been looking for."
