Dear Alan:  You misunderstand 
me completely when I mentioned
Bess Brown and a Guggenheim
Fellowship. I never meant to imply
that she could do Duncan Emerichs
job. She couldn't, but she could 
shine among the best of the Guggenheimers
on some other project
in which she [had] felt a genuine
interest.  But a Rosenwald would suit
me too. You'll have to push her
along.  Sometimes she puts things
off. 
As for Emerichs project i doubt
if there are enough actual 
miners' ballads to justify an award. Far
better, I think, to have included 
a study of the folklore
