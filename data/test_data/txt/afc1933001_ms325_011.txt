Kit and kaboodle I am for "Body, Boots and Britches." Of all books devoted exclusively to the folklore of an American region I find it the most satisfying. With a patience lightened by the fun he was getting out of it Professor Thompson has been collecting the materials of this volume for several years. Now he has woven them into a sparking homespun tapestry that every lover of Americana will want to have around the house.

"York State" has been the field of the author's research, but, as he points out, much of the folk stuff he found there belongs to other sections of the nation as well. His book is quite as general in interest as, say, Bellamy Partridge's "Country Lawyer," which concentrates on one  man of an up-State county and makes him somebody most Americans enjoy reading about. The first four chapters after the personal foreword are devoted to Pirates, Injun-Fighters, Outlaws and Uncanny Critters and certainly none of these are limited in appeal. Here are little known anecdotes of Captain Kidd and many a ballad of the buccaneers; stories of Tom Quick and Tim Murphy that deserve ranking beside Injun-fighting records of Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett; Robin Hood narratives of the Cowboy of the Ramapos and the ever-fascinating Loomis gang of Nine-Mile Swamp; and as gruesome a lot of tales of witches and ghosts as lovers of the weird may 4-year-old steers. And he has marshaled so pretty a regiment of long-bow archers that Munchausen must be whirling in his grave in an anguish of envy.

The chapter I like best in the whole book is the one entitled "Tricksters and Retorts." Thundered the Judge, "Sit down, sir! You are drunk." "That," retorted the lawyer, "is the only correct decision Your Honor has made the whole term." Here is a whole bagful of the kind of stuff that has made "David Harum" and "Eben Holden" classics of the American scene. Quotation of Hugh Houghtailing's famous outburst may serve as a tester: "Before I married Louisa I loved 'er so much I used to tell 'er I could eat 'er, and now, b'God, I wisht I had!"

With almost incredible generosity Professor Thompson adds chapter after chapter of rich lore. Whalers, plain sailors, "canawlers," lumberjacks, mountaineers, soldiers and murderers march in picturesque parade across these pages. Their songs and tales and sayings give ample evidence of the wealth of fancy that rural and frontier living stimulates in average folk. Out of this volume comes a history of which America has had to little, a record of the imaginative quality of its people.

One of the happier devices used to keep the book on its highly entertaining level is that of larding it with folksongs at those places where the songs fit the subject matter. Had all the songs in the book been printed in one chapter I doubt if many readers would have waded through them. But when war songs intersperse the chronicles of war, and crime ballads the tales of murders, the mixture maxes exciting reading. The number of songs included will be astonishing to many who have assumed that New York is so thickly settled a State as to have no hill songs, sea chantles or surviving remnants of the old English and Scotch ballads like "Barbara Allen," "Lord Lovell" and "Twa Sisters." City dwellers and the owners of the country estates may be surprised a bit to read native song narratives including "The Ballad of Grace Brown and Chester Gillette" and "The Murdered Wife, or The Case of Henry G. Green of Berlin, Rensselaer County, N.Y." The latter includes among its stanzas such pleasantries as

An inquest on her body held according to the law,
And soon it was proclaimed by them that arsenic was the cause.
Green was apprehended, lodged down in Troy jail,
There to await his trial- the courts would not give bail.

Professor Thompson has solved the usually insoluble problem of being both scholarly and entertaining at the same time. "Body, Boots and Britches" is by far the most comprehensive survey of New York State folklore. It is well documented and the bibliography for each chapter is extensive. A tremendous amount of research has been intelligently accomplished and the results have been sifted and edited with taste and feeling. The only error the author makes is in not giving the readers more of himself. He should not have let his years of academic scholarship lead him into the apology that ends his first chapter: "I have [?] shifting my own that of a fat person [?] a pointer- to the speech and narrative of [?]. If you don't like the [?] a chapter, skip three [?] see what happens." The three pages of his chapter contain a deal of charming writing that is important [?] whole work because it [?] both the charm of the [?] personality and his attitude toward the work he is doing [?] an objective and scholarly [?] of folklore- in essence an entertaining subject- has proven reading indeed because [?]
