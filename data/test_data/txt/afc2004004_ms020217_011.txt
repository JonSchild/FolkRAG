BJ   R. 2,  P. 10

man came up there ['bout] after the cow in a big ol' truck -- a wagon,
however, a two-horse wagon -- an' the man told, he said, "That's my 
cow."  He said, [it's yours more than] "Well, Jim mortgaged to me."  "Who?  Jim Samson?" 
"Yeah."  So Well,  that's all [there] that was to it.  [Right] Went out there and asked [(for the?)] Papa 'bout it 
[the white fella.] he said, "Yeah Morgan."   Said, "[Just] You have to take it out of
[offa] the farm."  Said, "I goin needed some money.   Not do[ing] a thing."  Never
been in jail______(?)  Go over to a man -- Joe Smith's --
sow with four pigs, four big [shauts] sholts ([no?]), you know?  [Sign} the sow and the four
pigs [over] all.  The [?] great, big, black sow.  One time the man go out there
[with] after the hawg (hoe?)...
AL:    So the fathers were pretty severe?
B:      So the what?
A:      Fathers
BJ:     Oh, yes they were.  But Papa was nice to me.  He was severe all right but didn't have to be.  Everybody raised me around the neighborhood
[you know]  All them old folks, you know that.
Caused they raised all the children, like I [*BACK*]
AL:    No I didn't know that.
BJ:     Oh, yes you do.  It ain' like it is now.  'Cause folk would anybody,
see you doin' somethin' wrong, they could call you in and whip you or
whatnot about it, y'see, but they can't do it now to peoples' chulren,
y'know.  But [in] those days, everybody -- ooo.  I see that gal goin', say
"You know better."  That's right; that's my habit of stoppin' chulren,
I reckon.  I stop 'em, I con't care where I'm at, white or colored.
"Huh-uh.  Don't do that."  Before I know, I done tell em.  "Um-um, don't
do it.  "When [I got] their parents right with 'em, I [say] "Don't do it."
Ha, ha.  But I [say habits got me,] just can't help it, look like to me they shouldn't do it.  I raised that
way.  and they would stop me anything I be doin...I be at somebody's house, we playin or anything... [I just] happen
there...and we do sompin we shouldn't do and the lady [just] spank me or whup
me or sompin like that, [I say there's] that's nothin to it.  [And] Ain't nothin' for
me to run and tell Mama.  'Cause if I tell, I get another one, you see.
So that isn't bright.  Bessie let that one do.
[*stop edit*]
AL:    You got some whippings like that from your neighbors, did you?
BJ:     Oh....Oh....yes, sir.  I stayed with 'em.  Every Christmas, you
know, before Christmas time?  I stayed with a family at (Piece-a-mosa?)
[*Christmas*]
about a week, you know, all through that Christmas hour, so they
can get the toys heaped back (?).   I didn't know it then, but I know
it now.  So they could hide my things, ya know, an' put 'em away.
And then sometimes they come over and stay with me two, three nights
and days like that, you see?  Certain chulren that didn't have too big
a fam'ly. Folks got a large family, they got grown up chulren, you know,
