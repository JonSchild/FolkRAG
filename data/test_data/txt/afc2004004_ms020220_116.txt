BJ:  Um-hum.  An' you can look all in there an', an' see that

was jus', oh, oh, that was the cutest thing.  She even tol' me,
said, "I was born with a veil."  Yeah, she was born in the veil.

TL:  You knew how to take it off, though?
BJ:  Yeah, I knew how to keep her from being worried by the spirits,
