Dear Alan:

You must have misunderstood my letter because I had not yet 
obtained the Librarian's approval for your trip to Akron. How-
ever, that has been settled satisfactorily and a two weeks ex-
tension of your trip granted. Your Father has already sent you
Captain Nye's address and you will probably have it by the time
you receive this.

Your salary check had already been sent to Pikeville by the
time your wire arrived. I hope you have left forwarding addresses
at all points on your itinerary.

I suggest that you return to Washington by way of Pennsylvania
and visit Bucknell College, which I hear has long been a center of
Pennsylvania folk songs. If there are any other interesting points
in Pennsylvania which you should care to visit on the way back, do
not hesitate to do so. The total count for Kentucky is indeed
marvelous. I can tell you now that I did not expect you to exceed
200 discs. Please write me soon and let me know if there is any-
thing I can do for you in the way of preparation for any Pennsyl-
vania visits which you may be contemplating.

Very sincerely yours,

Acting Chief,
Division of Music
