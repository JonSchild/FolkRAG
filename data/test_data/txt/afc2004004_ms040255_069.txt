Alfie -
had to drive little fellowes off the street
well I think that's wrong. Because every body's got 
to learn & they all enjoy it. And I think that 
you should know as youre growing up that you
should learn something about the hobby horse
Now in this hobby horse there's an old 
tradition that's been carried on for years
& years, in fact hundreds of years. One says
it's to drive away the evil spirits &
from the harbors & the say 'twas the [?]
of the danes that drove the Danes out of the 
town  That's what we were told to believe-
from our forefathers down, generations back, 
that's oh. hundreds of years ago in our own 
family.  And the whole thing is carried on 
which we wish it be carried on the same 
for you young fellows coming on, And if 
you would take the spirit into heart with 
(old) all these old traditions which is going 
on today, which is very few & you chaps- my 
one wish is for you (young) to continue (carry) on the 
job not to drive & off the streets (cause) As 
everybody has got to learn.  It doesn't 
matter what time of life its (your) in or where 
you've too, never think of the prejudiced 
because the simple reason for why in this 
there's always somebody got to take on when 
we're gone & we dont want to see the old 
tradition go down & if you boys continue to carry on like you is keep up 
the old tradition, I shall be more than 
pleased, instead of being ready to see you out.  
And I'm pleased to see you out as long as 
you does your bit, keep to yourselves, does 
your own work, & that's all that's required & 
anything I can do anytime towards e
