Negro Tunes

Tunes to help with work:

One Sunday in June on the Darrington State Prison Farm in 
Texas we recorded twenty of these tunes. The singing was done
by our long time friend, Lightning, by Dave Tippin and three
other chosen singers. While they sing, they chopped with their
axes or their hoes, depending on the sort of a work tune they
happened to be singing. The titles of some of these tunes:
Long John, Stewball (the racehorse), Great Godamighty, Black
Gal, Go Down Hannah, John Henry, All Night Long, and etc..
The manner of their singing is typical of work songs as we
have heard them sung in prisons throughout the deep South.
One spiritual and one jazz tune turned work-songs among them,
"Ef you don' git to singin', boy, you sho git worried."

Tunes to help religion:

Oh, Mount Zion-- A jubilee from the Darrington Farm which tells
of Brother Norah's building of the ark.
Reverend Sin Killer Griffin came to the Darrington Farm the
Sunday we were there and while he preached and led his convict
congregation in singing we recorded. It is hard to say where
in a Negro service singing stops and speaking begins. The
congregation moans and groans while someone is praying or making
his 'termination known. The preacher, if he is moved, chants
his sermon. The earnest worshipper chants his improvised prayer.
We recorded enough of each part of the service to make a legitimate 
record of the whole. The whole service, of course, took
place inside the barred prison dormitory. The microphone went
in with the minister behind the great black black bars,

Some months ago we came across E.A. McIlhenny's book "Befo' De
War Spirituals" and resolved to go to Avery Island where
he lived and record th slave-time spirituals from the singing
of the two old women, former slaves, from whom he had collected 
his material. This we have just done, and, although we
were a little disappointed in the singing of Becky and Berta,
we believe we have got a valuable record of the way spirituals
were sung "before de war." Ten of their most typical tunes were
recorded.

Tunes to help those who want to dance, but belong to the church
or ring-dances:

The Negro, with his love of the dance, has been hard put to
