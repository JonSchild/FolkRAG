Mr. Lomax

TO THE STAFF:

        The work of deck attendance, messenger
service and related activities in the Music
Division has become so complicated that it
has become essential that an employee be 
empowered to a act as a stack inspector and be 
placed in charge of these services.   With the
Librarian's approval,  I have designated Mr. 
Oliver A. Dudley to this position.   Since the
various space rearrangements will necessitate
changes in routine, it is suggested that 
members of the staff discuss their problems
with Mr.  Dudley so that he may be aided in 
improving the efficiency of this branch
our services.

                                   Harold Apivacke
                                    Chief,  Division of Music
