As for Lead Belly, to repeat (and for the
last time), you continue to deal
with a man, who, except for a
turn of fate, would have murdered
me. I am as happy about
it as if you insisted on
playing with a rattlesnake. He
wants something of us through your
money. I only pray that when
you can supply his demands
no longer you will not be a
victim of his "ferocious passions."

Miss Terrill will write to you
about the "question". Mrs. Roosevelt
tells her that the telegram came from
some one who claimed to be
your "aunt". Could it have been
"Aunt" Molly Jackson? I recall her
bitter letter to you of about that
date.

I'd like much to know if you have
sent the Introduction to Macmillan.
