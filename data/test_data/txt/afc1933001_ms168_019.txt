Dear Mr. Levine:

I herewith return to you a check which purpors to cover
my expenses in connection with the International Conference
of the American School of the Air, but does not
tally even approximately with the expense account I submitted.

I feel this should be brought to your attention.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
