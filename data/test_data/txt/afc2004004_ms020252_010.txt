2nd R. of 10/12/61 Song 18, p. 3
Livin Humble
He stayed in the whale
Three long days and nights,
God a-whispered to the whale
Very low,
Said, "I wantcha take ol' Jonah
"To the Nineveh sho',"
The sun shine hot in Jonah's face,
An' Jonah, he prayed to the Lord for shade,
A go'd (gourd) vine growed
Over Jonah's head,
Along came an earthworm
An' cut it down,
An' that left a mark
On Jonah's crown.

Livin' humble,
Humble,
Humble yourself, the bell done ring.
