Tape:  Sacred Harp-- Exteriors     19

these people that you see here, that I've been in contact
with, been to singings with so many times, well they just
become to be like kinpeople to me.  They're just like- kin
to me.  I'm just as proud to meet them as if I was meeting
one of my brothers or one of my sisters, something
like that, I'm just as proud to meet them.  There's a
close tie in this group of singers, in singing of this
nature, you know.  Why, sometimes they just get to feeling
good, and rejoicing, and I have seen them just yell out.
Just overjoyed, you know what I mean.  I said I've seen it,
not too much of late.  And it's been a good life, it's been
a life. . .  don't misunderstand me now, . . . .  when I've been
talking about life, I been talking about the life of
Christ, that spirit that he prayed to his father to send
back to us.  And he told us to sing spriituals, hymns,
and make a melody in our hearts unto the Lord.  And when
you get thataway, it's something sweet, its something sweet.
Unfortunaltely, a lot of people don't understand that, but
I get a lot of joy out of that.

AL:   And that's what Sacred Harp means, really, doesn't it?

Wooten:   To me, to me.  It's all the voices, all voices,
you see, in together.  Harmonizing, all parts, and it
brings a. . . .  I don't know how to explain it. . . .  it brings
a closeness and it brings a spirit that feeds the inward
