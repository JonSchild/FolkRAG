Dear Keith:
Earlier in the week when I was down, I mentioned 
to Neil Dubois that I had received a letter from Mr. George 
A. Nelson, in the Office of Education, about a "Rumor Clinic".  
I told Neil this seemed to me extremely dangerous and he 
said you people had had your eye on this and were hoping
to keep it under control.  Neil suggested your Office might 
be interested in the approach the Office of Education had 
made to me and I am therefore enclosing Nelson's correspondence 
to me and my reply.  Perhaps this should all be 
passed on to Neil, but at any rate you might care to keep 
it in your files.

Sincerely  yours,
Hadley
