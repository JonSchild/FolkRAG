Joe: Well, his wife has gone away. He hasn't got nobody left there.
No. His wife went away. Course, she wasn't no woman for singing. No,
no. A quiet woman.

The Light Dragoon:
1) O the light dragoon came over the hill; the moon was shining brightly
    There was a young lady, o she knew him by his horse, because she
                                                                              loved him dearly.
2) She took him by the milk white reins, she led him to the stable,
    There's hay and corn for your horse, young man, let him eat while he is able.
3) O she took him by the lily white hand, she led him to the table,
    Here's cakes and wines for you, my dear, eat and drink while you are able.
4) O she ran upstairs to make the bed, oh to make it soft and easy,
    How nimble she jumped into bed for to see if it was easy.
5) O the light dragoon, he ran upstairs, he put off his army trousers,
    How nimble he jumped into bed for to do what he was able.
6) They lay abed till the clock struck ten; the trumpets they were sounding,
    For her spirits high and her bely low, and she ran into her mummy.
7) O where have you been all this long night, enquired her anxious parent,
    O I've been along wiht the light dragoon because I loved him dearly.

Lomax: Do you think that's a true song?
Joe: Yes. Oh, I don't know. Some folks don't like to hear 'em.
Lomax: There's nothing wrong with that one.

Hares on the Mountain:
If maidens were sheep and they would lie on the mountains,
    Look how the young men they could go and lay with them.
    O sing fal the ral doodle Jack fal the ral day.
2) O if maidens were blackbirds, they would build in the bushes,
    Look how the young men they could spoil their young nestlings.
3) O if maidens were moorhens they would build in the rushes,
    Look how the young men they could use their short bushes.
