Mr. Alan Lomax
Division of Music
The Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

     Thank you for your letter of December 5th. Although we
had not anticipated paying for the use of "Grey Goose", we are perfectly
willing to do so under the circumstances. We trust, however, that
no difficulties will arise should we be able to get some theatre bookings,
something I had mentioned in previous correspondence.
     Over a week ago we had sent a copy of TALL TALES (16mm) to
Paul. L. Brand, 816 Connecticut Ave., telephone--Republic 1802, on receipt
of his letter saying he would phone you when the film arrived.
     We are wiring him immediately to reach you.
     Many thanks for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,
BRANDON FILMS, Inc.

P.S. In the promotional folder we would like to print the lyrics and
to give prominent credit to the source. Would you please advise as to
how it should be listed? Likewise we shall be pleased to list a brief
bibliography of books, pamphlets and other material you might recommend
and even a note on the work of your section of the Division of Music.
