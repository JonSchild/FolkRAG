A

Peggy on the banks o' Spey
   She's aye sae blythe an' cheerie O,
An' a country chiel she likes sae weel
   Tae rowe her in his plaidie O.

Bye an' bye some night I'll try
   Tae wile her fae her daddie O,
An' I'll kiss her ower and ower again
   An' rowe her in my plaidie O.

The plooman lads are rovin' lads--
   Ye aye ken fit they're seeking' O.
They pawn their kist, an' syne they 'list
   An' they leave their lassies greetin' O.

He's pitten me fae jumpin' dykes,
   Fae dancin' and fae fiddlin' O.
He's gien me laces tae my stays --
   They're o' the latest fashion O.

Gin I had back fit I ainst had
   (But that's fit I will never O)
I'd tak guid care, an' be aware
   O' the young men in the gloamin 'O.

Allegro Modto
Peggy on the banks o' Speys she's aye sae blythe an' 
cheerie O, an' a country chiel she likes sae weel Tae 
rowe her in his plaidie O.   Bye an' bye 
some night I'll try Tae wile her fae her daddie O, an' I'll 
kiss her ower an. ower again and rowe her in my plaidie O.
