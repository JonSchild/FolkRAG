"It would hurt like the devil to get in the Army and be bossed around
by a bunch twenty-year-old lieutenants. And it would be just as 
bad to get an officer who had never made over fifteen dollars a week
running a hamburger stand. I know a lot of them like that who have
good soft berths in the Army. They are doing better than they ever
did before in their lives." [*Topeka, Kan 8-5 58*]
