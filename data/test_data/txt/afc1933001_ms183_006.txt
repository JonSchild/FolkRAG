Mr Alan Lomax:-

Dear Sir,

The reason off my long delay
in answering your letter was
that I received the first one
offering $4.00 for the copy of the record
I've composed. Which I didn't agree
so well in selling it for only $4.00.

Then the man came over & informed
me of another letter you sent
me agreeing to pay me $10.00, But
When I went to the post office to
find out the post master said there
was no such letter there. But wanted
me to sign for $4.00 & to my opinion
it's worth more than $4.00

So please inform me imediately
explaining the matter

Yours trully  ans. to

Cleveland Benoit, 523 S. Main St.
