"Dying, dear, what do you mean?
One kiss from you will cure me."
"One kiss from me you never shall have
Though you're dying, dying, dying."

He turned his face back to the wall
And his back to Barbie Allen.
"Adieu, adieu my kind friends all,
But be kind to Barbie Allen."

O mother, dear, you'll make my bed,
And make it long and narrow,
Since my true love has died for me,
I will die for him tomorrow."

Johnny o'Breadislee... John Strachan:

1)
Johnny rose on a May morning,
Called for water to wash his hands,
And he called for his twa grey hounds
To be bound in iron chains, chains,
To be bound in iron chains.

2)
Now Johnny shot the dun deer lap,
She was wounded in the side,
And between the waters and the woods
They greyhounds laid her pride.

3)
Now Johnny ate o' the venison
And the dogs drank o' the bleed,
And they lay down and fell asleep
Asleep as thought they'd been dead.n (2)

4) 
AND BY there came a silly auld man
And a silly auld man was he
And he's awa' to the king's foresters
For to tell on young Johnny. (2)

5)
Johnny shot six of them
And the seventh he wounded sair,
And he swung his hook o'er his horse back
And he swore that he would hunt mair.. (2)

The Brown Girl has got houses and land
Fair Ellen she hasn't got none
And if you take your mother's advice,
You would bring the brown girl home.
