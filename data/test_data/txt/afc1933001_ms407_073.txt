In Chicago

     Back in 1917, just as the United States entered the World War, a local political
explosion on the University of Texas campus catapulted me from the State. James E. Ferguson, 
the new Governor, didn't like me. I landed in Chicago with my family and household goods,
an exile from all that I hold dear, - the hills and prairies I loved, my half-paid-for
home in Austin, Texas, the University of Texas that I had served since the day after [I graduated]  my
graduation in 1897.
     I had come to Chicago to work for the rich investment banking house of
Lee, Higginson & Company, many of whose employees had recently joined the United States
Army or Navy. Barrett Wendell, Jr., of that firm, whose father had taught me in Harvard,
had offered me a salary almost twice as large as I had earned at the University of Texas,
"as much as the Governor of Texas gets", chortled my children, Shirley and John and Alan. I 
I knew nothing of high finance[s]. I know even less today. At that time I don't think I could
have defined accurately the difference between a stock and a bond. My ignorance made me [terribly]
painfully self-conscious and unhappy. I didn't want money that I had not earned, and I 
soon discovered that I possessed no immediate earning capacity. Just before Christmas,
after I had begun work September 1, 1917, I found on my desk one morning an envelope containing
four one hundred dollar bills, crisp and brand new, together with a letter from
the partners thanking me for my services, saying the money was my part of the year's
bonus to employees. Up to that time I had probably not earned for the firm half that
amount. Such generosity humiliated and shamed me. I laid the money on the desk of 
Charley Schweppe, the senior Chicago partner, and told him I couldn't accept a bonus, that I didn't deserve it. He listened
patiently to my halting, embarrassed explanation and then said:
     "John Lomax, Lee, Higginson and Company think they know how to run their own
business. You take that money and go back to work." A few days afterwards he brought his 
wife from their Gold Coast home in Lake Forest to visit us in our rented cottage in Highland
Park. There are some other types of millionaires.
