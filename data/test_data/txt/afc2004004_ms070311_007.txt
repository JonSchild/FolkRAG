dollars - it was a thawy day -

stopped to put on chains was 
a sharp up-turned hill.  There 
was a hell of a bank - [of] on account
of a sharp curve to [a] the left.
On a thawy day a sled won't
stand. He got throe & he couldn't
quite stop. When he see that
he wouldn't, he proceeded on
with a 1000 ft behind him.
When he got to the turn, he 
was yellow enough to drop
the lines and run back
