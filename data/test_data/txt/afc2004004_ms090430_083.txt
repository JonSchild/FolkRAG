The Church

A second institution that has an exerting influence over the lives
of the rural people of this County is the church. The Negro membership is
predominantly Baptist, although there are also many Methodist churches in the
County. The churches are served by ministers who have two, three or even four
charges in their circuits. Because of this, preaching services are held only
once or twice a month. But as Methodist and Baptist churches have preaching
on alternate Sundays, many members of one denomination attend services at some
other church when their pastor is at one of his other charges.

Since there are numerous churches in each community, with small
memberships, it is inevitable that the church buildings and their equipment
are inadequate. The buildings, although for the most part crude structures
with broken windows and rough benches, provide some opportunity for developing
a community fellow-feeling. A call from the preacher will bring the
members out to chop wood for the fire or perform special duties necessary
for the up-keep of the church -- even to painting the buildings.

The small incomes of the ministers make it necessary frequently
for the pastor to engage in farming or in some other occupation to support
his family. Although the members are pledged to contribute twenty-five or
thirty cents a month toward the support of the pastor, few are able to make
these payments with regularity. One Baptist church has attempted to increase
its collection by calling the roll of its membership at every preaching
service. Each member responds aloud with the amount of his offering, as
the clerk records it.
