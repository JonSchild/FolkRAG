These poems by Edward N. Horn are from a projected volume to be
called POEMS FOR SMALL APARTMENTS. The bathing beauty in
the longer poem represents a modern "tutelary genius" of the sea,
functioning as Poseidon might in a classical setting, to introduce some
drama of the deep.

BRITISH ADMIRALTY SUPPRESSES
NEWS BECAUSE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL
EFFECT ON THE ENEMY

A bathing beauty whitely bleached,
The sea is green the sun is strong,
Her toe nails red and her hair bleached,
She pencils her eyes and sings this song;

An ill wind blows
To no one knows
Where . . .
Light the funeral pyre;
There's a chill in my bones
That yields, that goes
With funeral fire.
There's a wind that groans
With the cold of death
From over the watery heath.

And now the heart of a submarine,
Sunken on the ocean's bed,
Five dead sailors hands on head,
Speak the parts in the following scene.

It's cold brothers, it's cold.
And now we have become, as it is told,
Heroes, manual 4, paragraph 3.
Even a dead fish rises from the sea
For a bit of sun . . .
But we stay drowned like a murder gun,
Sunken, hidden from the eye
Of justice and the sky.

There'll be no flowers on my grave,
There'll be no mound but a sliding wave,
No widow shall weep for me
Under the sea-storm's tree.

We are no honest dead, they die
Who are shrived by a beloved's cry,
Or doctor's stethoscope, our death's denied
By newspapers, we have not died.

Dead at the bottom of the sea,
Not by any word above,
We have not died officially,
Not in the hearts we loved that love.

Slow salt water all around,
But not a tear for us the drowned.

WINTER OF 1939

To the Autumn of our hopes
Comes Winter, deadly, slow;
Brown leaves will fall like poison drops,
Oh, gather near,
Our hearth is a radio
Of glowing tubes where nations burn,
Warsaw is an ember here
And coal dark cities wait their turn.

THE SUCCESSFUL BOMBER

He dropped his bomb,
The small Earth shattered wide,
A brilliant hit and there
He was in a tomb
Of space and he died
Flying nowhere.
