Postmaster
Church Point, Louisiana

Dear Sir:

The enclosed letter is addressed to Ogdel Carrier, white
who is a singer of your county. As it concerns a matter
of government business I urgently hope that it can be
delivered to this party. Have him sign the enclosed
release and return the material to us.

I have endeavored to obtain this man's address from several
sources and I have been unsuccessful, therefore, I am
completely dependent upon your good offices in this regard.
I hope that you can let me know within the next two or three
days whether it is possible to reach him and if not please
let me hear from you to that effect.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
