LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS

Alan Lomax

REFERRING TO
For the purpose of [immediate] present and pressing work in the
Archive, I [have transferred] request the immediate transfer of the singer file of cards and the
geographical file of cards into the Archive office from the
W.P.A. pavilion. As I understand it, neither of these two files
are being used at the moment nor are they needed for constant 
reference in preparation of the check-list. They are necessary
for constant reference in this office if the work of the Radio
Project, the Archive of American Folk Song and John A. Lomax's 
work is to proceed. I shall be delighted for the project to use 
these files whenever they want to, but, they must remain in the
Archive until other complete files can be made from them. Eventually,
of course, the entire catalog will reside in the same
case in this office.  [I hope this may be as soon as possible.]
