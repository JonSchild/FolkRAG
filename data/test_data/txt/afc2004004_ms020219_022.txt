         Hah, so ol', ol' Buzzard shet (shut) his eyes.   Say,
         "Engine rus'.
         Pinion (penguine ?) puss,
         I'll eat my meat
         Befo' it git any wuss (worse)."
So, hah, hah, when he did, hah, hah, the ol' rabbit was gone for good!
He was gone [from] that time! He never did...
         An' so ever since, from dat day to dis, he, he eats his meat
fresh, an' then he asks his blessin'.
AL:    He says, "Angel...?"
BJ:     "Engine rus'; pinion puss; I'll eat my meat before it get 
any worse."
AL:     Angel...?"
BJ:     "Engine." (SHE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE "ANE-GIN") [,engine]
AL:     Oh, "Engine rust."
BJ:     Yeah, tha's right. "Penion puss; I'll eat my meat before
it git any wuss."   Ah' so he went to eat his meat -- was nice,
fresh meat -- an' gone, ha, ha!   Rabbit, rabbit knowed that from
dat day to dis he didn' nev--he don't never ask his blessin' before he eat.  He
just dive right in to eatin'.   Heh, if he git any blessin' it'll ha' to
be afterwards.   They don't take no chance on no more blessin'.
