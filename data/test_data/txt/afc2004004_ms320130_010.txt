LOMAX  
Yeah.  You, you've got a, been
specializing in singing ballads with, with some, some of the
ballads with the, with the violin or just solo, whatever.
You know we've got very few unaccompanies songs or
accompanied, we've got very few ballads.  That would be good
to have a couple.
DOUCET

LOMAX  Your favorite, huh?

DOUCET  [FRENCH] is a story of a

LOMAX  
Mike, the thing to do now, I think
you just have time for probably one more thing.  Let us, one
of the new, new more porfit, you know, kind of composed song
that you're always doing.  And tell us about what you think
is happening now in the new music.

DOUCET  
Thanks to Alan Lomax and John
Lomax, and the work that they've done in, did in the '30s
here, we're able to, to hear again the sounds that were here
and not commercialized as far as the songs that were on the
back porch.  They're [continued that way].  And one such
song that I heard from then and through Miss Irene Whitfield
Holmes, who did her dissertation on some of those songs, a
song she wrote down is called [Blues on Marsh, Louisiana].
