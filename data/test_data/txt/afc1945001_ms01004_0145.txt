Dear Dr. Redfield:

Since writing my letter to you of August 26th, I have talked
with Dr. Waples and would like to revise my remarks, as follows:-

1. We are, of course, very eager to do all we can to further
the systematic studies In communication and public opinion which
the groups at Chicago, Harvard and Princeton, at least, have now
underway. Such studies, reinforcing as they do the periodic studies
by the Bureau of Intelligence of rumors, of basic attitudes toward
the war effort, and of other fundamental problems, will inevitably
deepen official comprehension of such problems and should enrich
the reports in Chicago which our field staff provides.

2. As to the amount of financial support we might render,
the only answer possible at this time is that we cannot say. The 
budget for the next fiscal year contains an Item relating to contracts 
with research organizations of the sort your letter suggests.
Whether this Item will survive the scrutiny by the Bureau of the
Budget and the later scrutiny by a congressional appropriations
committee we simply do not know. Until we do know what funds we
may have for this item, it is impossible to consider the Chicago
request realistically.

When the budget has cleared - possibly by October first - I
shall hope to write you again.

Sincerely yours,


Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
