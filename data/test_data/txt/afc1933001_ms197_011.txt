Dear Alan:

I must admit that the Recording Laboratory
has been slow but not slow enough in terms of your last
letter. The material has been copied and the check
cashed in the amount of $31.00  The records were sent
to the woman in England and the tape is ready to be 
shipped anywhere you wish. I would send it to the Musee
in Paris but am not certain how long you will be there.
We shall send it anywhere you indicate.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Duncan Emrich
Chief, Folklore Section

Mr. Alan Lomax
Musee des ATP
Trocodero, Paris
