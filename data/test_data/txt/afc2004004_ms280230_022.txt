Johnny of Breadislee.
1) Johnny rose on a May morning,
Called for water to wash his hands,
And he called for his twa grey hounds
To be bound in iron chains, chains,
To be bound in iron chains.

2) Johnny shot
She was wounded in the side,
And between the waters and the woods
The greyhounds laid her pride.

3) Now Johnny ate of the venison
And the dogs drank o' the bleed,
And they all lay doon and fell asleep,
Asleep as though they'd been dead.

4) And by there came a silly auld man,
And a silly auld man was he,
And he's awa to the king's forester
For to tell on young Johnny.

5) Johnny shot six of them
And the seventh he wounded sair,
And he swung his hook o'er his horse's back,
And he swore that he would hunt mair.

6) Now Johnny's great ben bow is broke,
And his twa grey hounds are slain,
His body lies in Monnymusk
And his hunting days are daen.
