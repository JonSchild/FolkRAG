MRS. DAVIS:
your thought in buying but we cherish that guitar. And I'll never sell it.  You heard him say you can sell anything except that guitar and his wife.  You remember he said that. And so I knowed I'd have a hard time, so I know where it is and I don't. Its put up. I donâ€™t know when; the time comes, I may take the notion to give it to somebody, Somebody whose been real good to Rev. Davis, I might give it to somebody, I'm not to

It depends on how the meets me about the guitar. I have somebody in mind, he's been so good to Rev. Davis, I mean I would give to I mean I wouldn't sell it to anybody, I would give it, that would be no better person than Larry. You've been very good to Rev. Davis, Come right away when he found out Rev. Davis was in the hospital, Travelled with him, he's been very good to Rev. Davis thats why I give it to him because he wanted to come before he did, funny thing he would start screaming to get off of his legs, he wanted to come right away 6 weeks vacation, No this is the boy you see.
