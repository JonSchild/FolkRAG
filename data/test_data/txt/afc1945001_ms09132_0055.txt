1. What are we fighting for?  Democracy
What is democracy? something we don't have.

2. wear the khaki uniform 
and death will be yours not in 
Europe or Africa but Southern 
United States.

3. Lose time on your job and you
are aiding Hitler, Hirohito &
Mussulini

4. Feed the Lion ( England) who is waiting
for the kill while the Bear ( Russia) 
starves because of the American
Clergy.

5. Fight for your rights whatever
they may be.
