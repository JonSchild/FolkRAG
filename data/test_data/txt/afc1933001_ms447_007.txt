GALLEY FORTY-THREE
DODGE CITY, THE END OF THE TRAIL
The lions on the mountains I've drove them to their lairs;
The wildcats are my playmates and I've wrestled grizzly bears;
I'm wild and woolly and full of fleas,
And I've never been curried above the knees.
Whoopee! It's my night to h-o-w-l
* * * * * * * * * * 
I want to be a cowboy and with the cowboy stand, *
Big spurs on my boot heals and a lasso in my hand;
My had broad-brimmed and belted upon my head I'll place
And wear my chaparajos with elegance and grace.
The first bright beam of sunlight that paints the east with red
Would call me forth to breakfast on bacon beans and bread;
And then upon my bronco so festive and so bold
I'd rope the frisky heifer and chase the three-year-old.
And when my work is over, To Cheyenne then I'll head,
Fill up on beer and whiskey and paint the dam town red.
I'll gallop through the front streets with many a frightful yell;
I'll rope the slant old heathen and then yank them straight to hell.
  *    *   *   *   *  *   *   *  
Oh, bury me beside my knife and six-shooter,
My spurs on my heals, my rifle at my side;
And place on my coffin a bottle of brandy,
that the cowboys may drink as they carry me along.
Then roll the drum slowly and play the fife lowly,
Beat out the death march as you carry me on;
Take me to the prairie and fire a volley o'er me,
For I'm a young cowboy that knows he's done wrong.
  *    *    *   *   *   *   *   *  
The sheriff followed hard and fast,  a muy hombre he,
He had a posse at his back, a rifle at his knee;
But when he turned his sixes loose, we let him know
It took a Jim Dandy to bring us back from New Mexico.
