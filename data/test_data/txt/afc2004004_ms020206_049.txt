Reverend Roe. Reel 4. P. 6
When I look out on His Creation, I see white deers, black deers, and
all different colors: I see the same in cows, I see the same in hogs.
[*God made us all*]
Then I look out at the earth, and I see the earth that He made [flowers He made], and I
see flowers coming-- some red, some blue, some white--all coming up on the same ground.
It's a mystery to me, but it's God; And He must meant for us to live
together. He must have meant so. And that was God's way in beautifying
our world. And I believe it would be so beautiful if all of us--I
don't know as we have any need for you to marry [have] a white woman [Momma] and me
a black woman [Momma], -- I don't mean that because there is the [they is a] white flower and there is the [a]
blue flower and they keeps their seed apart and every one produces theri's
own kind, donZt it, and that could be the same with us.
