Dear Ms. Jones:
The many friends of folk music in the Twin Cities are looking
forward to your concert and to accomodating you during your
stay here.  Please let us know when you will arrive, so that we 
can make specific arrangements.

We are most anxious to give you the best publicity possible.
Any photographs, biographical information, and publicity for
 your recent engagements which you could send us would be most
helpful in our advertising.  Please mail them to us at your 
earliest convenience.

The Committee arranging your concert has planned a workshop
for the afternoon of the performance and would like to know
if you might be willing to participate in it.  Donations of $1
will be requested and all proceeds turned over to the performers.
Please let us know your thoughts on this matter.

In preparing your contracts it is necessary for us to know 
whether or not you are a member of the American Federation of
Musicians.  Can you please send this information along with the
above requests?

Thank you very much.

Most sincerely,
Georgia Beaverson
