Mr. Alan Lomax, Assistant in Charge, 
Archive of American Folk-song, 
Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thank you for your kind note of October 27 concerning the work
of the National Park Service in folklore collecting.

Almost all of our work has been done by one man, Dr. Joseph S.
Hall of Columbia University, who has been a collaborator with the 
National Park Service for the past several years.  His accomplishments
are fairly well summarized in several reports which he had prepared
form time to time, and will be more comprehensively stated in 
a forthcoming publication -- his Doctor's thesis.  Unfortunately  additional 
copies of these reports are not at present available for 
presentation to the Library of Congress, but we should be very glad
to make them available to you at any time you care to consult them
over here. 

the National Park Service is greatly interested in folklore
collecting although its own resources are exceedingly limited.  I 
should be delighted to have the opportunity at some time in the future
to talk over matters of mutual interest at your convenience.
If you care to phone me and suggest a day for lunch some time before 
long, I would be very happy to get together with you. 

Sincerely yours, 

Ronald F. Lee,
Supervisor of Historic Sites.
