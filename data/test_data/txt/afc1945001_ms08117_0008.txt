Conversation on a Street Car

1st passenger: Have you heard the latest
2nd passenger: No, what!
1st passenger: Child those floks in Congress has just
about made Mr. Rossevelt a dictator
2nd passenger: Where did you get that dope from?
1st passenger: They said it in the paper
2nd passenger: Now you just stop that junk right where
you picked it up from. Why do you think we are fighting
Ratso, Fatso, and Japso for if we want dictatorship.
Why that's absurd.
