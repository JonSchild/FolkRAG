What the spectator sees in the exhibition at this
Swenson Ranch sponsored Cowboy
Reunion, is the daily work of
a cowranch - with one exception.
A cowboys job never
depends on his [ap] ability to
to ride bareback a wild steer
Yet steer riding is almost
a necessary part of the
training for young boys who
live on the ranch. Almost
before they quit wearing diapers
you can find the younger
generations in the milking
pens [stragg] straddling the
astonished and rebellious
[steers] young colors. And yearling boys
ride yearling steers.
