5 

He asked not a stone to be sculptured with verse, 
He asked not that fame should his merits rehearse. 
He asked as a boon when he gave up the ghost,
His brethren might know he died at his post. 

Victorious was the fall, for he rose as he fell, 
With Jesus his Master in glory to dwell, 
He has passed o'er the stream and has reached the
bright coast, 
For he fell like a martyr, he died at his post. 

And can we the words of his exit forget ? 
O, no, they are fresh in my memory yet. 
An example so bright shall never be lost, 
We will fall in the work, we will die at our post. 

No. 75 
I think when I read that sweet story of old, 
When Jesus was here among men, 
How he called little children as lambs to his fold, 
I should like to have been with him then. 
I wish that his hand had been placed on my head, 
That his arms had been thrown around me, 
And that I might have seen his kind look when
he said, 
Le the little ones come unto me. 

Yet still to his footstool in prayer I may go 
And ask for a share in his love, 
And if I thus earnestly seek him below, 
I shall see him and hear him above, 
In that beautiful world he has gone to prepare
For all who are washed and forgiven, 
And many dear children are gathering there, 
For of such is the kingdom of heaven. 

But thousand and thousands who wander and fall
Never heard of that heavenly home, 
I should like them to know there is room for them
all, 
And that Jesus has bid them to come.
