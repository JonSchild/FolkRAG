The Spiritual-Railroad record finally
came in response to "a telephone
request from Alan Lomax." I'd
like to apologize to you for all
time for the stilted ex cathedra
tone I used in all those records.
I'll engage to travel to Washington
and to '[?] all and with no
reward whatsoever if the powers in
charge will give me a shove.
Through all the experience I was
impossibly and hopelessly microphone
conscious.
Bess seems to be having a very
hard time account swollen glands, etc.
Send her a cheering note if youo
can find the time. I am the man
to work with Goodwyn. More
later
Lovingly,
Father
