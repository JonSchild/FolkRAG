Mr. Richard Chase
Glade Springs, Va.

Dear Mr. Chase:

Mr. Lomax is in the field and has
therefore been unable to answer your
letter of July 14. He has asked me to
let you know that since he last communicated
with you a policy has been adopted
which makes it necessary to withdraw
that offer. During the present fiscal
year expenditures will be made for recording
projects only if they contribute
directly to the war effort.
[*end here*]

[The loan of a machine might be possible
if you could yourself find means
to cover the expense of such a loss.

Your comment on Horton Barker has
been referred to Dr. Harold Spivacke,
who may be able to offer some suggestion.]
[*No
Tell him 
to write me
and tell me
about Horton Barker - I don't know
anything about him.*]
Sincerely yours,
