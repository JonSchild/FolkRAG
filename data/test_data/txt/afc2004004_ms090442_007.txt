Fisk, 8. 11. BUSH ASA.
"Lord, John ain't here." Say, "Well, you'll do; I'll take you
along." Say, "Come out from the bed, John." Say, "Come out out from
that bed."
So John come out from under the bed and lit out the back door running,
bare feet, you know. She said, "Lord, yonder goes John out across
that field, backof the house." So the Lord got behind--right across
the field him and his old marse went, you know.  The old lady set in
the back door akimbo and watched John gettingnear back of the woods.
Left the Lord, as she called, way behind.  She called him, she say,
Oh, Lord, Lord, Oh, Lord." Say, “you can’t catch John cause John barfooted."
