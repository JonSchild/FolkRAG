Midnight Special

From Texas prisons June and July, 1933.

Well, you wake up in the mornin'
Hear the ding-dong ring;
Go marchin' to the table,
See the same damn thing.
Well, it's on one table,
Knife-a, fark an' a pan,
And if you say anything about it, 
You're in trouble with the man.

Chorus:

Let the Midnight Special
Shine it's light on you
Let the Midnight Special
Shine it's ever-lovin' light on you.

"Yonder comes li'l Rosie."
"How in the worl' do you know?"
"I can tell her by her apron
"An' the dress she wo'.
"Umbreller on her shoulder,
"Piece a paper in her han'
"Well I heard her tell the cap'n,
"I want my man."

Chorus.

Well the biscuits on the table
Jes' as hard as any rock.
Well, if you try to swallow them,
Break a convicts heart.

"Well, [it's] yonder comes Dr. Melton"
"How in the worl' do you know?"
"Well, they give me a tablet
"The day befo'"

"Well, they never was a doctor,
"Travel through by lan'
"That could cure the fever
"On the convict man."

Ef you go to Houston,
You better walk right;
You better not stagger
An' you better not fight.

Sherriff ******** will arres' you
He will carry you down.
Ef the juris fin' you guilty,
You'll be penetentiary boun'.
