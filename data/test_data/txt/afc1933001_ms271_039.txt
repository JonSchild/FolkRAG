THE THUNDERBOLT SONG

The THUNDERBOLT SONG is performed with a LEADER and a GROUP. the LEADER points t o 
the first picture and sings the first question. the GROUP sings the answer. He 
points to the next picture and sings another question. they sing the answer back 
and all join in singing the titles of the pictures they have just named, starting 
with the latter one. Then they sing the CHORUS, and the LEADER goes on to point 
out the next two pictures asking the questions for each one. The GROUP answers 
as before. He points to the ones they have called, starting with the last one 
again, until they have named them , and they sing the CHORUS again. This procedures
is followed to the end of the song, as indicated on the page listing the words 
and music. The LEADER should be very enthusiastic, for the success of the song 
depends on the energy he gives his questions. Large cards with the above pictures 
painted on them strung across the stage behind the LEADER will insure the best 
presentation of THE THUNDERBOLT SONG.
