Well, you talk about some runnin den, boys,
All of um run jes like wheels,
I'd a been there to seed um run
Seen Mr. Will Springfield
--
Well, talkin about the mob
Hasn't been nar' one since
Talkin' 'bout Mister Hunter 
When he jumped the courtyard fence
They laid him low
---
Mr. Norman Clayton told the  boys,
"[Now] boys, now if y'all'll wait,
We'll [soon]get back to Strayhorn
If we can follow a trottin' gait."
--
Sentobey boys was really mad
But they didn't play so bad,
Scared to fool with the Strayhorn boys
Mr. Sam House was s' bad
      He'll lay you low
--
Mr. Strayhorn told the boys
"Tell y'll a certain fact
The hounds got on the [boys] track
They brought the boys back
 But they laid him low.
--
When they tried the Strayhorn boys
They did not try um here
Tried the boys most anywhere
But they all sho come clear
They laid him low
