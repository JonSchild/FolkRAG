Walter Brown  Tape 2, Side 1 

WB: .  .  .  She was beautiful and Ely Mae saw her.  I wouldn't give her
_____ but Gertrude     cause she was naturally beautiful.
She looked [t] li[l]ke they had made a form that they was gonna pour
and set the form, like the concrete they run.  Looked like there was
a form made and she was poured in it, and then taken out [o]of it.
That's the way [d]she was built.  She was the prettiest little woman
I ever saw in my life  She was naturally pretty. 

AL:And so this Nathan was after her.
WB:I believe that he had been going out with her because he went for bad, 
and after me and her started going out together he kind of ___up a little bit. 

AL:He didn't like it too well, huh? 
WB:No I didn't mind it because I was to ignorant to think that anyone
was bad.  I thought I was just as bad as any man was.  So he went along 
with that too.  Because he knew that I was a pretty good marksman and 
that I didn't care nothing about nobody.  I didn't have
And he knew that.  And the boss knew it.
So we had a little run in one night playing pitty-pat.  He was
gonna try and get his revenge and I asked him , I said, "I tell you
what you do," I said, "If you don't like the way this game is going, you
just go home. " 
And he said, "You putting me out?" 
I asked him, I said, "Did you hear what I said?  Now if you don't
like the way I'm running this game, you go home."  I said, "I'm boss here." 
He said, "Well I guess you're right.  You just     I'll go along
with you being boss.  I'm somewhat littler."
