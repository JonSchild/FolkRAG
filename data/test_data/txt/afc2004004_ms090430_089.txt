Negro Family Organization
     Interesting differences begin to emerge in the pattern of the Negro
family in this type of area. The Negro family is smaller than in most other
areas. Of the population 65 years of age and over, 75.9 per cent, in 1935,
had been married at some time. The number of widowed was 11.6 per cent, the
separated 6.0 per cent, and the divorced 2.0 per cent. There are more one-person
families than in most rural areas. In fact, they constitute 25.3
per cent of the total families. The families with children were only 23.7
per cent of the total listed as families.
