smart girl.  She's eleven years younger than me.  Mary's her name.
We call her Molly for short. She'd go around all the farm-
servants collecting the coppers for me, and we come home at
night and had a nice little camp and we'd do very well, and we
went away and were married in Belfast.  And ever since that we
lived happy ever after.
Lomas: What did you think when you first saw her? Was she
a pretty girl?
Davy: O she was a smasher.  O dear, o dear. She was a good-looking
wife.  Good-looking family, too. I've a little wee one at home;
she'll be five noo, in October.
Lomax: Did your wife like the travelling life,?
Davy: Oh yes. She liked the travelling life very well.  But these
few years back now, I've been settled in a house.  I wouldn't
approve it now, lying in a camp on the damp ground, because it
gives you cold and rheumatism in your bones.  Travel life's a hard
life.
Lomax: Who was the person who first wanted to settle down? Was
it your wife, or was it you?
Davy: Well, it was the wife mostly.  She come across from Ireland
to Peterhead to see a brother of mine - he was very bad.  He's
dead now, God rest him,. But the wife was expecting a child -
the little girl that's no ten years old, little Mary.  She was
born in Peterhead in my brother's house - he'd four room,s you
see, and there was just him and his wife and two daughters and
a boy.  And we lived there for a while and my brother died.  So
after he died, we thought we'd like to go away.  So we went away
back to Ireland and was there in County Down playing and singing
across the boats, crossing the Free State.  I made a good
living crossing from the County Down to County Luce, and we used
to play thirty or fourty boats on Saturday - they used to take
the six counties people across to the Free State because
things are cheaper in the Free State than they are innthe 6
counties.  So I played these big motor boats all day - they'd hold
about forty passengers each.  So I'd go from one boat to another
and make a good few shillings.  But we come back again to VBlairgowrie,
Scotland, for the berries, and I says to the wife, I
says, 'We'll have to try and settle down.  It's no use running
about like this".  So she say's "Yes, we're getting older now,
and it doesn't do to be running about rearing a family.  Get
proper schooling. "So we went away to Dundee and got a house
in Dundee: Been there every since.
Lomax: Are you better satisfied now that you've settled down?
