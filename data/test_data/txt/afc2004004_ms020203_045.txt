to come over to our house every Sunday evening, late in the
evening. . . 
A: How old were you then?
V: I was about--- around thirteen -- thirteen or fourteen,
something like that. And he was, too. He was round the same
age. We call ourselves cotein for a long time. But I didn
marry him. I went off; I went from round him; I got from round
him and didn't see him when I got up really to where I was
supposed to be cotein. I wasn where he was.
A: How would he cote you exactly?
V: He'd sit down by me when he wasn playin and just all
sittin around, sittin about, he'd always sit by me. And so 
we'd talk and sometime we'd go pick berries, bout three
or four or six couples of us would go down cross the paster and
pick berries. Well, I wouldn have to pick berries-- anybody that
had a boy friend wouldn have to pick any berries-- anybody that
have a boy friend didn have to pick any berries cause he'd go
out and pick em all, leave us sittin down on the roadside--they'd 
take our buckets and go pick berries and then bring um back to
us-- Then hed tote my books and anything. We go to tie up the
cows and he see us, well, he'd come and let me stand in
the road and he'd go down through the weeds and tie the cow
fur me. He'd that for me. Everything he could do outside, he
would do it.
A: Would you all have any love songs that you sung in those
days? You were already a singer, I guess.
