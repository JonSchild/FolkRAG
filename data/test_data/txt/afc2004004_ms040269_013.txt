The other day I was strolling
on the Banks of the [?ness].
I met an old miner
that was in some distress
I spoke to him kindly and
was coming away
When he got hold of my arm
And these words he did say.

[?ch}
I am an old miner
Aged filthy and  [?]
If I could get lots I would
Raffle my picks
I'd raffle them, sell them or
give them away
For I cannot get work
because my hair is [?thinnest] [?grey]
My God, [?] I wish
you'd hear a him
