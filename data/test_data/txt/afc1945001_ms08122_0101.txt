Jokes and Rumors

One day Hitler and his aid were out 
driving.  When all of the sudden there car
ran over a farmers dog.  Hitler told his aid 
to go tell the lady that they ran over her
dog.  Hitler waited and waited and waited and
finally it got dark and still his aid didn't
return.  The next morning his aid returned
with fruits and vegetables and sweets.  Hitler
asked "how did you get all these thing."
His aid said I went up to the farmer and
said "Heil Hitler the dog is dead."

The people brag about how many
sons they have in the Army, Navy, Marines,
and Air Corp.  They also tell where they 
are headed for.  This helps the enemy
figure out how many men are in a 
certain place.
