                                           12.
Dere was yaupon an' hollyberry stuck behind de window curtain an' picture. An' de coffee pot have de right smell. In come de Cap'n. An' before he quit with me I sho' git a decent scoldin'. He tell me,
     "Mike, dese lyin', schemin' plan put you in trouble. Keep away from de duck business, an' watch yo' own color. Yo' color an' my color dig pit for you. Now, dem two little  pair of duck ain't so valuable. I got 'thority from de law. My lawyer say you been a good nigger, I can believe you and set you free."
     An' he gone on to tell me how lots more people in favor of relieve me. Take me! I know how to give honor where honor belong. Good friend help. Good friend sho' help. But as de good song say,
     "Don't take ever'body for your friend!
     Don't take ever'body for your friend!
     Dey will make you weep an' moan,
     Dey will cause you to leave your home!
     Don't take ever'body for your friend!"

     An' you know what de magister done? He ain't stop till he put me down to my very boat. Den he stand an' watch while I packs all de Christmas in de bow. Den he say,
     "Can I help, ole man?" Glad de stars in shinin'. Moon'll rise soon. Ain't too cold. Paddlin' will warm you up. Merry Christmas, Mike!"
     An' I too full. I bust out,
     "Thank  Gawd for de white friend, Cap'n! Thank Gawd!"
     An' when I take up my paddle, missus((strikethrough)) good Lawd, I find I hab de wind an' de tide!
