multiply." You can't multiply.  [Of course] 'Cause, you multiply other things.
in [countin'] coming [like] but you can't multiply peoples unless you -- uh, multiply,
an' that's all.  That's all. Ha, ha.  An' that's all, anyway the Lord have you do
it.  An' so that's the way you have to do it.  And that, you see, that
shows that there's nothin' to it. Only what God intend to do.  You
can plant flowers; you can go get a tree; I [go] gets different flowers
and put[s] in my yard and, therefore, the Lord and I can [can] put all kind of
stuff around it.  If the Lord don't intend for it to grow, it [ain't]
just ain' gonna grow there.  Sometime if you said, "That flower just not
goin' live; I don't see how in the world, 'cause you got it in such and such
a place, it just ain't gonna life here. And 
I [got 'em] put it down here now and I got it bloomin' see that's all.  Now that flower not a bastard because
I brought it from another place and put it in that yard, y'see?
[*(take away from one place put in another)*]
It's [g]drafted, that's all. And it's ([g]drafted?) into where [I] it's suppose[d to]
[the ? flower is] multiply at, that's what it is.  That's what it is; it's
[drafted] (drafted?)  from man to woman, and from woman to man.  I don't
find -- I don't see no fault in it at all.  But I'm glad that I see
it that way.  If I'd a-listened to the people and hear folks say,
"You got that chile without, outta wedlock."  [Well,] Now you think that -- course  I don't prefer -- I don't
tell nobody not to do anything, you see. 'Cause it's right to do
it 'cause you got to obey by the [Lord and you] law and the rules and Jesus say have a, you must obey those who
have rule over you, y'see an' specially -- [an'] in  the Lord [*('cause some are not in the Lord. They try to be mean to you.)*] [is] and the law
is the thing you gotta obey, too.  You see 'Cause if you go over that red light,
you gonna pay for it, see?, [cause] if they ketch ya', [an’] as they see ya'.
[*Marriage theory*]
An' that red light is a warnin' for you to stop for danger of
different things. There's so many things that there's danger in now
'cause the world is so fast and so peculiar. It would be better for
a woman to marry a man in the way they are marryin' 'em -- in the
way I married and many more[. Now] -- now, than to not to 'cause they do --
'cause the (east [?]) side is so wicked They throw out threats and say now No, you don't belong to me;
I don't belong to you." [Well,] Here, you belong to them if you love [me] um, see?
But you don't, you ain' loving nobody; that's the whole thing of it. That's why
you sayin' that; you ain' lovin' them. They ain' lovin' you. And
then you done change altogether; that's what stop that. [But] An' the
right way of doin' it if you got chulren by 'em, an' throwin’ the
chulren away, and [no doubt they] won't he'p take care of 'em, and
