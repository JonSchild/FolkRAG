-12-  Rumors, 8-3 to 8-8  New York  8-14-42 

Yonkers 8-7:  "An Army officer shot an Admiral in Alaska." 
New York 8-5:  "The Government has abandoned the soldiers who were captured
on Bataan and Corregidor.  Nothing is being done for them even by the Red
Cross.  The Japanese are starving them to death." 
New York 8-7 (Social worker):  "LaGuardia has money invested in a hotel
where soldiers and sailors meet prostitutes.  That's why he and other big city
officials won't let the police clean up vice." 
Brooklyn 8-6 (Catholic Priest, follower of Father Coughlin):  "The
President ordered establishment of the WAAC to get more control over the women 
of this country.  He wants to see the home broken up, as it has been in atheistic
Russia." 
New York 8-6:  "Those WAAC's were hired so as to give the men in the Army
women they wouldn't have to pay for.  Each squad of men will get one woman." 
New York 8-8:  "The President is plenty sick and that Admiral is running
the country." 
New York 8-7:  "Right after election, every man 18 to 35 will be called
into the Army." 
Staten Island 8-8:  "The Army really doesn't want to see vice cleaned 
up, and is hampering police in towns that try to control it." 
Staten Island 8-5:  "One of my sons in the Army says all the men at the
post are being run ragged with parties, dances and other entertainments.  They're 
getting soft.  My other son in the Army says the nearest town to his post has only
six stores.  There is nothing to do but to drink, and liquor is easy to buy --- 
to easy." 
New York 8-8:  "There is going to be a tremendous food shortage.  I know
one farmer down in Suffolk County that just plowed up forty acres of string beans
because he couldn't get pickers.  Why don't they send those boys over from Camp
Upton to pick them -- they aren't doing anything."
