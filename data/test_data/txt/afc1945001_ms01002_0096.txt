January 22, 1942

Mr. Keith Kane
Office of Facts and Figures
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Kane:

Barnet Nover's column in yesterday morning's 
Post is the first thoroughgoing statement that we have
seen of a point of view which has been held for some 
time in this Office. We prepared a statement of this
viewpoint some time ago and forwarded it through
channels by which we hoped that it would ultimately
arrive in your Office. The matter of warning the
American public against taking Nazi rumors seriously
is a purely domestic one, and so we attempted nothing
more than a statement of fact for your Office.

We continue to feel that there is not enough
stress being laid on the importance of discounting
most of the rumors about Germany, regardless of their
origin. There are, for instance, a few radio commentators
who,  while not explicitly saying so, nevertheless
give the impression to their listeners that there
is considerable factual basis in these rumors. Literally
hundreds of thousands of American people are ready and
eager to believe any news which even hints at the 
internal disintegration of the enemy. Once such a belief
becomes fixed, the individual makes his plans on a
short-term basis and will tend to slacken his effort
in the defense program. This, of course, is exactly
what the rumors are intended to do, and we feel very
strongly that the American public should be warned.
We can easily see how it may happen that the Federal
Government can encounter a good deal of obstinacy and
resistance among the public to war plans of a long-term 
nature, if the public is convinced that it is
only a matter of weeks or months before the enemy effort
will collapse from the withdrawal of internal support.
