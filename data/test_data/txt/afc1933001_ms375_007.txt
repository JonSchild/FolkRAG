and he'd turn it up and drink [it]  like pouring' it down a god damn
craw fish hole or sumpen.  Well, kep' on, you know, and we messed around
(you know,) until 
we drink that god damn jar of whiskey.  Well, me an' Earl Lee, we started---
I got on a damn big brush, you know*, and I run in and [I knock around the] I'd whang the ol' brush
[path] with a sourwood walking stick, you know, walin' stick I had, I'd cut in the woods -
you know, sourwood walkin' stick, "Whang, whang," around that god-damn big
brush fer a mule.  you know and I run him away on down the holler an' go
Peanut jumped on one & come on behind me
and I jest rared right back and turned [mine] my mule just like I was turnin' her on a dime

laid the pole up in a damn fork, you know, like I was hitching him so he
wouldn' fall plumb down, you know.  And I rid them damn brushes plumb out of the

a-walkin' and I was behind on a mule . . . . .

You know god damn well they're watchin' for us, damn it, don't be too bold around
here."  And then another one will say, "God damn old red eyes, we don't give a damn
about them."
