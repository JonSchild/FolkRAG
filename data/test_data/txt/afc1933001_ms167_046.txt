Mr. Crim
The White House
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Crim:

It turns out that I gave you the complete 
list of the persons who participated on the program 
at The White House last Monday night. Will 
you be so kind as to send me a copy so that I can 
write letters to these performers.
 
May I take this opportunity to tell you 
how much I appreciate your personal kindness and 
consideration of a very nervous performer, one who 
must have appeared to you as occupied in a strange 
musical business.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
