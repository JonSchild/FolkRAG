way God had planned that thing that you think you have an give it
to somebody else. An I in my conclusion let us see to it that we never
lose anything that we have. If you got anything that God [have] ever give you,
be sure that yo u stay with God [?] long enough t o be able t o port to him
that you've been able to keep the thing that you have, that when it come
round the question of dyin that you'll be able to meet him. As Paul has
said, on the last go-round, he tole Timothy to preach the word to all
n ations but keep they hand in God's hand[?]. [In the] An at last, on your
last go-round, [you'll be all] in the moment when God shall come in his unfailin [?]
glory you can look death in the face an say, "Death, I am g lad to
go with you." In the moment when God shall open up the way for angels
to write down your name, an call in your nam e, an hear the welcome bells
say "Come in." You'll be able to tell the world how you come in.
'Sometimes you were toss-ed an driven,
H as no where to go,
I heard of a city called heaven,
I've started to make it my home."
I let em sing a song -- that we have had such a hard time -- came through
trials an tribulations -- to be able to say,
'Amazin grace, how sweet [the] it sound
It saved the rest like me."
Maybe somebody git up an say, [?] "Less don't sing that [is]. We sang that back in yonder
world. Less [ing this] sing this song '. (He is jerky and almost inc[h]oherent
now) 'How happy are the saints above,
Who once knew sorrow here,
But now we taste the mingled love
Now enjoy without a tear."
Then after we sing this song we can always tell the world how we got
over. Reach up an make ourself joyful with the things that God places
in our hand, look back an say, "We have fought a good fight. Now We'll have 
run the race with patience, wear the crown of righteousness, lean up
in glory for it, you'll be able to say, [?]"Thank God, we have
fought an run well. An we're near the end." God bless you.
