for their continuation is forthcoming.

Accordingly, the minimum request for contractual funds which is 
hereby asked for is for the sum of $4,000 to enable these studies to continue
for a three-month period, beginning September 1, 1942.  This figure
of $4,000 may be broken down as follows:

$900 for the study of rumor
$1900 "   "   "                attitudes in the general population
$400   "   "   "                attitudes in the school population
$400   "   "   "           content analysis of the Tribune
$400 unappropriated, to be used for special spot studies that
          might be requested of us by your organization 

                                     PLAN II

The second alternative, as suggested above, envisages a much 
more comprehensive program.  the sum asked for in this instance is $6500
for the three-month period beginning September 1, 1942.  The additional 
$2500 would be employed as follows:

$1000 for an intensive study of certain minority and ethnic
groups on whom the war impinges with particular stress.   These groups
would be the Italians, Negroes, and the Germans.  The thought would be
to include in addition "friendly" minority groups such as the Poles for
purposes of comparison.

Another $1000 would be used for the study of disaffected economic
groups, particularly small merchants and displaced workers.

The remaining $500 would be added to the $400 mentioned above
for the making of spot studies desired by your organization

Perhaps from the standpoint of your organization, your interest
in utilizing our personnel and facilities might suggest a different emphasis
