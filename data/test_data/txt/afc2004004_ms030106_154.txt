She got in the jail-house. They asked her -- What you
there for,
Her inmates in the jail-house: What're you here for?
She said: I killed that bitch, that's what I'm here for.

You're a murderer, that's why you're in jail,
You're a murderer, that's why you're in jail,
They had you pretty soon, they was on your trail.

Oh, that's good whiskey, makes me moan.)

Her trial came up, she was in front of the judge,
Her trial came up, she went in front of the judge,
Her attorney tried to give the judge a nudge.

The jury said: That girl is here,
The jury said: That girl is here,
The jury said: That murderin' girl is here.

The prosecutor said: Today we're dishin' out years,
Prosecutor said: Today, gal, we dishin' out years,
So be careful, don't have your fears.

She said: Judge, I killed her because she had my man,
She said: I killed him because she had my man,
I killed that bitch because she had my man.

I'd rather be dead and in my grave than see that bitch havin' my man,
I'd rather be dead in grave hearin' of her havin' my sweet man,
I'd rather be dead in grave; let her have my sweet man.

Jury found her guilty, she must go to jail,
Jury found her guilty, she must go to jail,
Up the river to Baton Rouge is her trail.

Judge said: Fifty years for killin' the woman that loved your man,
Judge said: Fifty years for the woman you killed lovin' your man,
I wish I could help you but I'm sorry that I can't.
So the poor gal was took away to that mournful jail.
