LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
WASHINGTON
DIVISION OF MUSIC

here until then and finish up a couple of recording jobs and
try to complete arrangements with American Record Company or
do you wish me to appear on June the First. I suggest the former
course.
What have you heard from Mister Frank Walker of Victor?
Will it be possible for you to send me franks to cover shipment
of Library records back to Washington or do you want me to send
them express collect? Shall I get a bargain price on a new re-
cording machine or shall I arrange to have a new cutter and 
a new microphone installed on our presto? I think, if you can
afford it, it might be a good idea to invest in a sixteen inch
recorder which would serve all sorts of purposes for us later
on and would cut masters for us from the beginning... I shall
consult you, of course, before I enter into any contracts with
Columbia Phonograph Company.. I hope you can get something done about
that grant. I still have one course to pay for at New York University.
I have one new Ford contracted for on which the sucess of my 
summer's trip depends. Thanks for your continual encouragement.
Best regards,
Alan.
