Here is a saboteur story from the Italian area:
       They tell me that at Fort Custer, Michigan five or
six hundred soldiers are quarantined with yellow jaundice.
They get if from the serum that is injected in them in
the vaccinations. On the West Coast there's a lot of
yellow jaundice among the sailors and soldiers. Something's
wrong somewhere with all those soldiers and sailors
in quarantine.

5.   Rumors concerning reasons for the events of war are also
frequent.
      An example from an upper class area follows:

              Have you heard that a lot of the British soldiers
in Libya are blind?  The reason the British had to retreat
was because so many of their men had desert blindness.

              Various other stories, that plants canning food for the Army
are using spoiled meat, that soldiers who take advantage of the ten days furloughs after induction will be kept in the Army for two years after the war ends, that the tire administrator is connected with the big rubber companies, etc. all seem to be current.

             The purposes of this investigation of rumor are (1) to get a
picture of the kind of rumors which are present; (2) to see how they vary
among cultural groups, among social classes, and among occupations; (3)
how they are related to passing events; (4) what light they throw on the
tensions, anxieties, complaints, and hopes of people; and (5) how they
originate and spread.  As mentioned, the volunteer informants are
carefully chosen in terms of willingness to cooperate, of ability to observe,
and of strategic accessibility to a significant group in the community.
