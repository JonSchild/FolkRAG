Dear John:

Thanks for your letter. How nice about Jan Struther. Was
I right, the pleasure was not all on your side.

As to my children, my daughter Barbara was married seven years
ago this month. The man she married was thoroughly nice but
why she saw any charm in him was beyond me. Well, after three
years you could not mix them any more than water and oil and
they were divorced. Since that time she has kept her chin up,
she worked first for the Republican Women's Committee for the
Republican Party in Boston, then had a year's work for the
Massachusetts Taxpayers Association on tax records. She got
to know a great many politicians then became interested in
politics. She then got a job in the fall of 1940 on Time magazine, 
and strictly confidential, she made some suggestion to
Mr. Wilkie during his campaign which he liked and she has seen
something of him since. She was working away with Time when
one day in the morning her immediate boss called her and told
her she had done well and that she was going to get a raise, and
in the afternoon the head woman fired her. It created quite a
little excitement. She then went to work for Russell Davenport
for a few weeks and now is in Washington working for Mr. MacLeish.
She has a boy six years old.

My oldest boy, Barrett Wendell, has been working in Winthrop
Mitchell and Company and I feel has been stagnating, but he is
a curious fellow and you can not make him do anything he does not
want to do. I think he should teach school but we can't quite
get him off. He married Mr. Mitchell's daughter, who is a nice
girl but rather shy and undeveloped. They have a baby who is ten
months old, which is a great pleasure as it seemed as if they
would not get one.

The third one, Francis Lee Higginson Wendell, married the adopted
daughter of a man named Alsop. They were married in 1937 - he
left college to do so. He worked for a year with McKinsey Wellington,
which was a business advisory firm making studies of
