Jokes about the war

From a Soldier

We land in Australia and were 
immediately sent to the trenches.
After a few night in the trenches
the cannons started roaring.  I
started shaking with patriotism.
I tried to hide behind a tree
but there weren't enough
trees for the officers.  The captain
came around and said, "Five
o clock we go over the top".  I
said I'd like a furlough, he 
said, "haven't you any red blood
in you. I said "Yes but I
don't want to see it he said
"where would you like to go"
I said, anywhere it's warm
he told me where to go.
