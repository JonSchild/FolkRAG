My Brother is in the Army

My brother, who has been in
the army almost one year, came in
the barracks one after noon and
lay down on his bed.

One of the fellows came up to
him and said "Why don't you sweep
under your bed once in a while?"
"I do" was the reply my brother
gave.

So he went and got a big bucket
of hot water, some soap, and a
scrub brush, and got down on his
hands and knees and scrubed under
and around his own bed. When
he got through, there was one big
white spot in the barracks.

Then the sergeant came along
and said he shouldn't have done
that. The next day the sergeant
had every one of the men down
on his hands and knees scrubing
the floor
