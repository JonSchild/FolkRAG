three successive trips or months' 
duration. With quiet sympathetic
tact he has collected the words of 
approximately 185 folksongs and 
now sets them down in their original
Creole and in English, with 
126 of their melodies in an appendix.
   This exotic Creole dialect dates
back over 400 years to the time
when Padre Las Casas, horrified 
by the callous brutality of the 
Spaniards toward the Indians,
suggested that African slaves,
better able to stand hardship, be 
brought to replace the fast disappearing
Caribs. The first Negroes 
arrived in 1510 and proved
so satisfactory that thousands
were imported in succeeding
years.
   The traders in this "black 
ivory" packed the hold of their 
slave ships with Africans from
different tribes who could not 
understand one another's dialects,
for fear of a concerted revolt, so
when these unfortunates were
landed they had to contrive some 
jury lingo by which to communicate
not only with their masters
but with their fellow-serfs as 
well. Their primitive minds
could not grasp the intricacies of
French, so they simplified it to 
suit their necessities, worked out
a rudimentary grammar, lopped
off first and last syllables, and,
where sounds were difficult for
their thick lips and unaccustomed
tongues, they slurred
them. The soft and liquid Creole
dialect was the result, and so
drastic were its differences from 
standard French that philologists
have classified it as separate 
tongue - the first and only language
born on the North American 
continent since Columbus.

other in the minds of the Haitians
until, in the course of years, a 
strange nature-spirit worship - a
composite of African religions - 
was evolved that included the
Virgin and some of the Catholic
saints. This animism with its
many gods, its rituals, incantations,
music and dances, Mr.
Courlander explains fully with no
touch of spurious dramatics. It is
called Vodoun (Voodoo), an African 
Fon word that designates the
whole conception of the supernatural,
and he says it is many

singing means to them. It is the
story of Haiti, which is the child
of Dahomey in Africa." THis is
not an overstatement by the author,
for he has accomplished just 
that, and done it in an interesting,
accurate way so that the integrity
of his telling puts his
book among the small group of
truthful understanding accouts
of the black republic like (to
mention but a few) Blair Niles's
"Black Haiti" (Grosset & Dunlap),
M. J. Herskovits's "Life in 
a Haitian Valley," Percy Waxman's 
"Black Napoleon" and

verse of Louisiana, where the 
music of the Creole Negroes reflects
much more of the French 
influence. We can easily prove
this by comparing the melodies
in "Haiti Singing" with those
given in the chapter on Creole
"ballets" in Miss Whitfield's
"Louisiana French Folk Songs."
Their gayety and lightness are
reminiscent of the eighteenth 
century French chansons the
Louisiana slaves heard in their
masters' households.
   Some of Miss Whitfield's Creole
songs were collected from white
persons who had learned them.

came from Canada in the middle
of the eighteenth century,
and the French spoken by the
educated Creoles, which is a 
close approximation to standard
French. Over a hundred songs 
of these three groups are included
in Miss Whitfield's book.
Those in Louisiana-French were
for the most part, brought over 
by the early  colonists and in the 
course of centuries have become
more or less modified. The peculiarities
in pronunciation have
been preserved by transcribing 
them in the usual manner and
then in the symbols of the International
Phonetic Alphabet. In
some cases she has indicated the
European French originals, but
more research along these lines 
would have been welcome. No attempt
is made to trace any of 
the songs to Germanic sources,
yet there must have been a very
strong German influence because 
of the large body of immigrants
that settled around the Bayou 
des Allemands. Las Valse des
Creoles, given on Page 84, has a
strong Germanic flavor.
   Little has been written on the 
Cajun songs, so that chapter 
is particularly valuable. Cajun
speech shows innumerable variations
from standard French and,
in this respect, lies between the 
French of the Creoles and the 
Creole dialect, which some believe
should be called Negro-
French to prevent misunderstanding.
The English of some 
of the "back-parish" Cajans is at 
times as peculiar as their French.
The classic examples is the farmer
whose cow had strayed away.
Seeing his neighbor coming up
the levee, he called, "He la bas
Valsin! you see ma cow, you 
poosh 'eem 'ome."

The Outline of a Modern Philosophy

NATURALISM. By James Bissett
Pratt. Powell Lectures on
Philosophy at Indiana University,
Daniel S. Robinson, Editor,
Third Series. 180 pp. New
Haven: Yale University Press. 
$2,
IN four very readable lectures
Professor Pratt sketches the
outlines of a modern naturalistic
philosophy and, perhaps
more important still, exhibits in
his comments and homely, direct,
man-to-man style the attitude of
a contemporary philosopher toward
life and the world in which 
he lives.
   He defines the characteristic
features of naturalism as (1) a
search for the truth, (2) an empirical
method and (3) a picture 
of the universe. He contrasts
naturalism with any positivistic
philosophy that fears speculation
about the nature of the world as
a whole, with any rationalistic
philosophy that puts reason 
ahead of facts, and with any romantic

{{column break}}

philosophy which puts 
emotion or salvation ahead of 
truth.
   He then takes up the problems
of the relation between life and 
matter, between mind and matter,
nd between values in ethics 
or religion and matter. He criticizes 
the hard materialisms and
mechanisms of previous centuries,
repeating frequently that 
such naturalisms have been the
chief enemies to genuine critical
naturalism such as his by putting 
a fixed picture of the universe 
ahead of empirical method
and truth.
   His own world picture is of a 
genial and much softened type.
He conceives causality as "lines
of continuous influence and tendency,
binding together all parts
of the universe; every single
thing in it sensitive to and influenced
by everything else ***
so that the Cosmos as a whole 
has a kind of unity, in its bewildering

variety, which almost deserves
the name organic" (page 
92). There is effective purpose in
the universe, nd mind interacts 
with matter, and there is value
wherever there is desire, liking
or appreciation, and there is God
in the sense of the "Real as such.
When religious though reaches
its ultimate meaning it will always 
find that nothing short of
the totality of the Real can satisfy
it" (page 177).
   Naturalism in his hands takes
over so much that was formerly
idealism that the name he so
tenaciously holds for his view will
seem to many somewhat strained.
The great value of the book is 
Professor Pratt's own honesty in 
accepting what he finds as facts
in spite of theory, and is symptomatic 
of the strain that all theories
are under at the present
time.
