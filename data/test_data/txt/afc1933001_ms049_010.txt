My dear Mrs. Wilson:

My wife and I both very much enjoyed your program of
"Plantation Echoes" staged for us in Hibernian Hall in
Charleston, S. C., July 15, 1937. At that time, we made
records of the program for permanent preservation in the
Archive of American Folk-Song of the Library of Congress,
and also took moving pictures of the more dramatic moments
of the action.

I think any American audience will be interested and
moved by your singers, particularly if you confine your
program to the more primitive songs, both words and music,
and let the Negroes show they come direct from the farm
through the style of their dress.

The inclusion of all ages from children to very old
people produces a happy effect, the picture of a Negro
service in the plantation accurate and complete. The
chorus singing and clapping were both especially natural
and effective. I recommend the performance heartily.

Sincerely yours,

Honorary Curator and Consultant
Archives of American Folk-Song
