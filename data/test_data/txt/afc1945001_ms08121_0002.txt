War Stories

You have probably heard
about men trying to get out of
the draft. Well one little boy at the
age of thirty made a awful lot of
trouble with the govement. I heard
him say, "Oh please don't," + all of 
sudden there came a rush of tears.
Then he added, "My mother will
never forgive, she will die if you do."
What's all the secret about, all there
is, is that a thirty year old boy didn't 
want to have his long blonde curls
cut for he had them since a 
baby.
