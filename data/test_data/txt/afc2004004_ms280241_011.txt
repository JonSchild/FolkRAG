TAPE 86. . .JEANNIE ROBERTSON.
Lomax: Do you think that things are foretold in dreams?
Jean: Yes.
Lomax: Have you ever had any things like that in your own life?
Jean: Oh yes. I've dreamed true. I've always had the feeling
that I've a bit of the foresight about people that passed out
before they did that. Just one little incident was my own son,
- but that wasn't my first one. When my son was just developing
his illness - my husband was in hospital at the time - and my
child was lying beside me, and I lived in a top flat, myself
with my  two children. And I was just about 27. One night I
dreamt the door opened. A man opened the door and came in. And
I thought I was lying - as I often did at these times - face
down on a pillow. And I thought this man waked me up and he said,
"Jeannie, Jeannie, there's something terrible going to happen
in your life. Something terrible." It was the way he said it.
All of a sudden I jumped up and said, "O nae, nae to me. I've
plenty trouble. Wi' him in the hospital giving up. Surely no
more trouble to me." And I thought the man disappeared. And
when I woked up - at least, I WAS UP! He did waken me because I
looked all around. Good God, I said, surely no more trouble. The
next night I dreamt that there wasa man I'd known long, long ago
cme to a funeral. And I was sitting in the front of a hearse
with this man and we was going to a funeral. And I hadn't seen
that man for years and years. He was living about a hundred
miles from us. I was going to a funeral. I saw the grave and
everything. I told my brother-in-law the next day, I said,
"There's something going to ha ppen in my house. Something
terrible going to happen." He laughed at me and made fun of me.
He says, "You're only suffering from imagination." That's the 
words he said. I said, "I'm not." I told him about the funeral
and everything. I says, "Wait till you see. Before very long is
over a terrible disaster is going to hit me. Wait till ye see."
My son was dead and buried within three weeks, and he was a big
boy going nine years of age.
Lomax: Nothing more terrible could have happened to you.
Jean: Suppsoing I had a large fortune it couldna have given
me a sorer heart if they took awa' my fortune. I'd have gotten
over that. But when they took my son, I couldna.
Lomax: What kind of a boy was he?
