7 JOHN A. LOMAX ROUTE 4 BOX 341 FOREST HILLS DALLAS TEXAS

especial mention should also be made of Professor C.P. Boner,
of the Physics Department of the University of Texas. When our
recording machine broke down and refused to go further, Professor
Boner rebuilt it on a new principle so that it worked
better than ever, and then refused to accept any compensation
whatever. To him and another who have speeded Alan and
me on our ways, I offer grateful thanks.

Respectfully submitted,
John A. Lomax
