Dear Sir:

Got quite a kick out of the way you addressed your
envelope "Down Beat, A Negro Journal". It isn't
of course, you know, although we write-up colored
musicians who are deserving as well as whites.
Will send you a sample copy in case you haven't seen
one.

The article about Bessie Smith appeared in the
November, 1937 issue but that issue is no longer
available, sorry to say. They're all sold out.

Thanks for your interest, and best regards,

DOWN BEAT  Chicago
