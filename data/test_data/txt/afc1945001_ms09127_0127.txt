The Army
     One of the fellows in my block came
home on leave. I asked him how he
liked army life. He said; "You do a
lot of work, but you have a lot
of fun."
     He said; "You go to bed at ten; and
get up at five or six. You eat a nice
big breakfeast, and then get in your
morning exercise."
     "If you like to peal potatoes just
ask for K. P. . You'll peal potatoes
all day, and at night you'll still
see potatoes in your sleep."
     One of the fellows in his unit
is six foot ten inches tall. He is
called Tiny. I wonder how tall you
would have to be to be called tall.
     I asked him about the sergeants
in the camp; How many different
kinds of sergeants there are. He said;
"there is only one kind of sergeant they
are all the same.
