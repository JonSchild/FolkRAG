NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR 1939
INCORPORATED

WORLD'S FAIR, NEW YORK

November 14, 1938

Mr. Alan Lomax
c/o Mack Evans
University of Chicago
Chicago, Ill.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have not been able to answer the questions in your
recent letter, and we are nearer than six months to the time
of the Fair, because we are expected to have everything in
readiness by April 1 for our program.

I do not see a six-months job, and I cannot gurarantee
you any emolument at this moment, but I would like to keep in
touch with you, because I still have hopes that we can assemble
some folk things in which you assistance would be valuable.

I seem to remember that you had certain arrangements
under way with Mr. Krimsky, or have they given out? If you
will recollect, it was my thought that you would prove a sort
of liason in the folk field between our two departments.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,
Olin Downes
