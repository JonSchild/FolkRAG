Ballads. Having a home once
more for my dear little daughter 
and Alan raises the question 
of where it would be
best to live. In case support
can be continued for the collection 
of Folk Songs and in case
you are satisfied with my
work would you prefer that
I live in Washington or say
in Austin, Texas, at the University?
wherever this home is I as a 
Field worker must stay in 
the field. So long as I am
in the field Texas is nearer
to more Folk Songs than is Washington. 
In this connection I
should also like for you to consider 
my appointment as regular
