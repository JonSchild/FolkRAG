i. THE GODS OF THE VODUN PANTHEON
[*Cape + l.e.*]
One of the most impressive facts about studies of Haitian
peasant belief is the absence of any attempt at systematic treatment of
the deities of the vodun cult, either as concerns their attributes, their
functions, or their relationship to one another. Indeed, there are but
two exceptions to this statement; Dorsainvil (I, pp. 174-175) has published
a list of the names of gods, placing them in categories according
to their African derivations, and Parsons (I, passim) has made available
her notes on the characteristics of the deities of which she was
told while working in the island. Otherwise, one reads merely of "The serpent-
god Damballa", or of "Papa Ogun", or some other isolated designation.
It therefore seemed of capital importance in making this study to obtain
both names of deities and as much information concerning these gods as
possible, and the resulting data are presented here.
One reason why perhaps not more of such "systematic theology"
of vodun as exists has been made available is because of the great degree
of individual variation which confronts the student seeking this kind of 
information, since differences of opinion are invariable encountered. Even
priests do not by any means agree, for these men and women are supreme individualists,
each being the worshipper of particular deities, and exploiting
special skills, with the result that the frame of reference within
which a given priest operates differs from that of his colleagues,--
though, of course, always within the limitations set by the general pattern
of the cult.
This range of opinion cannot be better illustrated than by
