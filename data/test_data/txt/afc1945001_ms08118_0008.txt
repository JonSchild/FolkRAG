Joke

A soldier a sailor and a marine 
were standing on a corner one day. 
They were looking for dates. They 
see a civilan walking past with 
the girls. They begin to wonder: 
The soldier says how did he get 
so many girls? The sailor says 
I don't know. The marine says 
I know He's the new milk man.
