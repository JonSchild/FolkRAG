Dear Alan,
   Thanks for letting me know about Bill Doerflinger. I had
just gotten hold of Dutton Co.'s address to write him when he
came across with a letter to me, which pleased me highly.
   I owe you plenty of apologies for not answering sooner your
letter of July 9 -- fully a month ago, I now note. The old faithful
excuse of "very busy" is all I can offer, tho' it's offered
with its full amount of sincerity and meaning, so help me. The
other week I met up with a friend and fellow-anthropologist of
yours who was on a flying visit here: a Mr. Duran, with whom I 
sent regards to you -- hope they got there.
   Well, regarding the possibility of recording songs in Pennsylvania
this summer: providing you haven't gotten someone else
to do it by this time, I can report nothing but frustration on
my side. Am busy now as every, and do not see how I can possibly
get away for any part of the summer. Wish it were possible, as I
feel a great need of getting back into the field again -- a folklorist 
needs the experience, the refreshment, and the
confirmation of his previous discoveries & impressions that an
occasional field trip alone can give him. Do you know where Geo.
Korson is now? I wonder if he could be rounded up for the work?
He has specialized in collecting miners' songs, of course, but
that's nothing: and if he could, I'll bet he would be delighted
to collect all and sundry types of folksongs in northern Penna.
which is a country he apparently knows well. Whether Harvard
would be interested in cooperating in any such project I do not 
know; at any rate, I am no longer in any connection with the university,
so think it unlikely they would be interested in it as
it concerned me.
   I have you to thank, I take it, for the fine copy of the
Archive's checklist to Apr. 1940 which came to me lately. It is
impressive, and makes me thankful that there's someone in the 
country who is at once interested and empowered to gather our
folksongs in such numbers and so thoroughly and representatively
as you & your colleagues have been doing. Keep up the good work:
I see from the list (tho' haven't found times to look all through
it) how much the archive needs data from Pennsylvania -- and fr. 
W.Va. also, methinks. Hope some way of collecting in those territories
will open up t you shortly. -- Needless to say, I am
deeply gratified by what you have to say concerning my paper
which Mrs. Voegelin showed you. Hope I shall be able to go on 
with folksong work and add something worthwhile to the knowledge
of our great tradition. Best of luck to you in your fieldwork and
studies, and may the present world calamity not cut them short.

Sincerely yours, 
S. P. Bayard
