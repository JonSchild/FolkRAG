Are We Doing Our Part to Win
This War.

The Children around my block are
doing their parts. One day we 
decided to give a public show. We
made a sign and placed it in
front of the show: "Bring books
that are good enough for the
service men to read, and you 
can get in free, if you haven't
any books then bring 5¢ to the shows."
After the show was over we
collected $1.00, and 5¢ & 10 Books. We then took money
and books to the block captain who
gave them to the Red Cross.
