are not the original rural Southerners who kept the book
alive all these years.   They meet once a month and sing.
They don't do the tradition, they just meet and sing.   And
to us, the tradition is more important than the singing.   The
tradition I'm talking about is the prayer before we begin,
the prayer after we end, the dinner on the ground, and the 
fellowship we enjoy, singing in the square, and those things,
that's our tradition.   If you leave some of them out, you're
really not doing it like it was done 150 years ago.    We
want to seek the old path and walk therein.

AL:   And the emotion is gone, a lot of it, the excitement, 
the heat, the passion is not there so much.

Hugh:   You'll see a lot of that this week, you'll see tears, 
hear shouting, see emotion -- you'll see that this week.

AL:   But it makes you happy, you're one of the happiest 
people I ever saw.

Hugh:   Singing makes everybody happy-- you can't be depressed
and sing.   You gotta be happy to sing.   And you can't be 
troublesome, because when you sing, that's just awful.

AL:   This is the first time I've ever found folk music in a 
clothing factory.   I've found them in zoos, on the beach, in
the jungle, kitchens, mines, clipper ships, everything, and 
now we've got them in a pants factory.
