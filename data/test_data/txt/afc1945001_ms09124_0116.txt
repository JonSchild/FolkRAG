A Soldiers Prayer
This is [???????] a poem of a soldier
who is in the arm force, and he has
a little pray.
"Dear Lord today I am in war,
To fight, to die.  Tell me what for?
Dear Lord, I'll fight.  I do not fear
Germans or Japanese - my fears are here.

America!...Land of the free:
This is the place that troubles me.
So while I fight wrongs over there
See that my folks are treated fair.

       92nd QM Co.
