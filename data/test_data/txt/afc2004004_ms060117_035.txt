Dear Mr. Weber:
Lord help me, my West Indian voyage put your article out
of my mind, and frankly, I wish I had not promised it
now because I am just snowed under with work.  I cer-
tainly can't do anything for spring.  I will just have to 
put it in my growing file of unfulfilled committments.
About lectures, I have an agent -- the Keedick Lecture
Bureau, Inc., 475 Fifth Avenue, New York City -- who is
instructed to keep my fees high so I don't get many 
dates.
The research done around the enclosed reprint has re-
cently won me a two-year National Institute of Mental
Health Grant, under which I am going to try to make a
formal and scientific approach to the field of folk
song.  After that I am not sure what I am doing.  What
I would like to do is to spend two or three years devel-
oping some American serious musicals out of the material
I have always been chiefly concerned with.  Maybe a col-
lege campus would be the best setting for this; I don't 
know.  Anyway, I sure appreciated your letter.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Lomax
