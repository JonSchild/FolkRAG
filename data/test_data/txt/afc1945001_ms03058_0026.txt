Why don't you get together? I don't mean you out here in the field - I mean
all of the government agencies in Washington. Why, it seems like I have
another federal man asking me for more reports or information every day. And, 
there are lots of 'em asking for the same dope. Talk about being inefficient. -
- Wholesale Grocer - Milwaukee - Aug 14. 

IV. Things will start happening after the election. 
Washington is waiting for the election before finishing the tax bill. 
- Merchant - Milwaukee - August 11. 

After the election we'll get the bad news about our taxes. 
- Wholesale Grocer Assn. Sec. -
Milwaukee - August 13. 

We'll see lots of things happen -- after the election. The tax bill won't be
ready until then. Gas rationing won't come to the middle west. Just wait
till after the election. - Salesman - Milwaukee - August 14. 

Our whole future hinges on the election. We'll see many radical things go
into effect after November - things they don't dare put into effect until after
the votes are counted.  - Housewife - Milwaukee - August 14. 

V. Production is being slowed down through production and poor management. 
Our production is being slowed down by labor. 
- Chamber of Commerce member - 
Milwaukee - August 10. 

Management is slowing down production. 
- Union Member - Milwaukee - August 11. 

Production is being slowed down, and Washington isn't doing anthing about it.
- Landlord - Milwaukee - August 12.

Those strikes are being motivated by American Firsters and other anti-New
Dealers to make the government look bad right before election.
- Attorney - Milwaukee - August 12. 

Labor is just trying to see how far it can go in this strike business. 
- Trucker - Milwaukee - August 14. 

What can you expect; the government has cow-towed to labor so much that labor
is running things its way. - Housewife - Madison - August 9. 

If those strikes aren't stopped our whole production is going to pieces. Why,
it's treason, that's what it is. - Housewife - Milwaukee - August 14.

Labor has the government eating out of its hands. 
- Salesman - Milwaukee - August 12. 

Labor is doing all it can to push itself forward, regardless of the war effort. 
Those strikers are typical. And, they can be expected to continue and increase
until the government decides the U.S. is bigger than labor. 
- Gov't official - Milwaukee - August 13.
