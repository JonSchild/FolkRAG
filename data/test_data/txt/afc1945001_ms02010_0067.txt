17. Some rumors probably should not be denied. Rumors
      which are harmless, or which fall into the category
      of folklore, serve a positive psychological function
      to certain types of people. Most supernatural stories,
      fantastic predictions, "tell stories", miracle
      stories, etc. have a perennial appeal. If specific 
      stories in this category are denied, then other fantastic
      stories may be expected to replace them -- and 
      the new crop, unfortunately, may be more dangerous
      than the rumor which was denied.
18. Rumors columns ought to guard against printing rumors
      designed to force the release of information which has
      been withheld for military security reasons.
19. As has been previously pointed out, the most dangerous
      rumors to handle are hate rumors. The technique recommended
      by the Office of War Information is as follows:
      print hate rumors about any group only as part of a 
      long list of similar rumors about other groups. For
      example:
