To Win this War

Slap the Japs, Slap the Japs.
With our scraps, with our 
scraps.
If we don't we will lose
So come you one come you all
Slap the Japs Slap the Japs

Dig them out, Dig them out
With our scraps, with our 
scraps
I am sure if we do, we will
win this war
III
Haven't you heard about those
rats
Yes those dirt little Japs
