branded in your mind by Miss
Barnicle Heels, you have [fro] here
in this book an excellent
picture. You ought to read
it, if only for the reason that
I was born on the edge
of the Delta in Holmes County,
Mississippi. (You can't escape
this fact, you know. I'm
sorry, but you can't.)
Read this book. Mr. Percy
faces the truth unflinchingly
and he can write
too. And I'd like to hear
your reactions.

Butâ€” unless you enjoy
matching with me,
