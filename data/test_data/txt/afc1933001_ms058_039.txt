Dear Mr. Spivacke:

1. I am writing today asking the Washington Express office
to release the records. It must have looked to you like an
attempted hold-up.
2. My blank records are here waiting for me having been
forwarded from Merrivale, La. My brain got skittery from too
much fast travelling and I had to get a check-up from you. May
apologies to you for both slips.
3. From Drew, Miss., on yesterday, I Expresed you a second
batch of records. Please find enclosed receipt.
We are finding some new stuff and re-recording some of the
last of the old. The gang work songs, sung in wild abandon, seem
definitely gone. I can't find 'em anymore after only 2 years.
And the old spirituals are following: Chief causes, I think, the
radio and education. Thank you again for your helpful promptness
and unfailing kindness.
Always sincerely, John Lomax
