After Charlie Banks went to Mound Bayou we used to go down there to 
play for their founders day.  Charlie used to have the town in his yard and 
Mrs. Green was against him, and she would have the band from Vicksburg in her 
yard, with a few friends of hers from Vicksburg and Natchez.  Mound Bayou has
always had its troubles around factions.  After Mrs. Green married Francis 
she got on Charlie's side, and Booze went in, became the opposition.  Mound 
Bayou wasn't much until Charlie Banks went there from here.  Roscoe Simmons

much before Charlie Banks went there, it began going down when he left.  Carnegie 
gave them the library building, but the town was supposed to furnish
it and put books in it.  The Rosenwald Fund was supposed to help them.  It

when he was Secretary of the Masons.  He had fifteen or twenty girls working

in business here.  I believe that the first brick building this side of the 
railroad tracks was the store Charlie Banks put up for Booze.  He and Banks 
fell out before Banks left here.  Eugene went into bad health and had to go to
