get away you dirty dog.
you make my courage rise
There is only one man in this town
can make my courage sweet big ties
(6)
Forty dollars I shoot
And a mike I pass.
Who dont like this toast of mine,
Can kindly kiss my ass.

She promise to meet me. freckle face
When the clock strike twentythree.
Down by stockyard so many miles away.
Where pigfeet and onions.
Sells twenty cent a pounds.
She is my freckleface consumption Sarah Jane
Chorus
Oh she is my lady.
She is my baby.
She is cockie and she is crazy.
She got a banjo belly parrot toe.
Her grandman make her sleep altho.
Some say her breath was sweet.
But I will rather smell her feet.
She is my freckle face consumption Sarah Jane
