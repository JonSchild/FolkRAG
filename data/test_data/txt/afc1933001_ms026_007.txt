Letter of Mr. Lomax dated March
10, 1935; part of this letter is
quoted below.
In a letter dated March 10, 1935, Mr. Lomax writes:
"Will it be possible for the Library to refund me for the expensed of 30
records at 35 cents each, $10.50, paid for from my funds?"
Even if there were funds with which this charge could properly be paid,
I should be inclined to question the advisability of paying it.
With your approval, I shall suggest to Mr. Lomax that he look forward
to adjusting this matter with the Carnegie Corporation if and when his application
for a second grant has been approved.
