Falls. They were going to blow up all the railroad bridges from here to Canada."

how secret."

Price Control and Rationing
Brooklyn 8-3: "That OPA price control is supposed to put all the 
independent stores out of business so that the A. & P. and other big chains 
can take over. 

Staten Island 8-4 (Standard Oil of N.J. employee): "The forced 
conversion from oil heat to coal heat is being pushed by the Government to 
retaliate for the oil companies' part in international cartels."

New York 8-7: The Government is down on the oil companies and is 
getting people to change over to coal heat just to hurt the companies."

New York 8-5: "Fuel oil sales allow less profit that any other types 
of oils, so the oil companies have persuaded the Government to 'make' them 
cut down on fuel oil shipments."

Buffalo 8-8: "This gasoline business is a political trick. At the 
last minute, Senator Mead or some other politician will fix it up so that we 
won't begin rationing here on the 22nd. When he does that, he will get all 
the credit. It's all politics."
