Dear Mr. Spivacke:
Please get from Mr. Putnam a general letter explaining and
commending my purpose in asking favors of Governorand others as I
travel through the South. I need these character testimonials to
save my face with people who do not think highly of folk song
collectors. With high regards always.
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
