Like Mary and like Martha, you'll always use
Him Well ; 
He'll comfort and redeem you, and take you to
the skies,
And bid you live forever, where pleasure never
dies.

No. 57 

There is a fountain filled with blood, 
     Drawn from Immanuel's veins,
And sinners plunged beneath that flood,
     Lose all their guilty stains. 

The dying thief rejoiced to see
     That fountain in his day ; 
And there may I, though vile as he,
     Wash all my sins away. 

Dear dying Lamb !  Thy precious blood
     Shall never lose its power, 
Till all the ransomed church of God
     Be saved to sin no more.  

E'er since by faith I saw the stream,
     Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
     And shall be till I die. 

And when this lisping, faltering tongue,
     Lies silent in the grave, 
Then in a nobler, sweeter song, 
     I'll sing Thy power to save. 

In heavenly strains, from every tongue,
     In heaven, our sweet abode, 
Thy praises shall, in purest song
     Honor Thy name, O, Lord.
