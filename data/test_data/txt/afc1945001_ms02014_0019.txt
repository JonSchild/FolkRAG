Mr. William H. Webber

Very possibly a dozen sample reports strictly in the category 
rumor should be prepared for distribution to participants.  
Persons seeing the picture most clearly were Comer Syprett and 
Bert M. Grim, beauty parlor operators.  The job done by the 
police, to whith the Police Commissioner assigned five patrolmen, 
was poorly done because of the confusion in the men's minds as to 
what constituted a rumor and what an opinion.

As you may say, we had very little time to work on this.  We acknowledge, 
too, that some of the sources from which we expected a great deal 
yielded very little.  In future rumor operations we possibly should 
try other locations.

The original notes handed in by participants are being sent under 
separate cover.

Sincerely yours
