ta do.   See, Cawzins's overseer, an' everything.   He'd jus' git
out with a (?) stick an' he walkin' through this patch an' th'
other patch.   He comin' ta. . . !   He walk [right through] around
to ya door, ya know anything, he up to ya door an' done walked

door an' that door fastened, he won' knock on it.   He'll go
around an' see if the other'n fastened.   Act like the police or
