woman to appeal to a Catholic priest, who then intervenes
and is rebuffed by the draft board.

"Its inexhaustible variations alone show how fantastic the
rumor is.  According to one, received recently by the [*paper*],
[World Telegram] 110 inductees in the Fordham section of 
the Bronx staged a two-day sitdown strike until they 
forced their board to call a larger percentage of Jews.
No such incident could be traced.

"In an Italian section of Brooklyn, Draft Board 202 was
supposed to have been closed after the priest from the
Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe complained of favoritism.
The Rev. Joseph McCormack, pastor of the Church, repudiated
the story as a complete falsehood.  The fact is that 80 
percent of that particular board's registrant's are 
Italians, so its percentage of Italian inductees is naturally 
high.

"Another common version, involving the alleged fist 
fight between a priest and draft board member, centers in
Washington Heights.  Here the church is invariably mentioned 
as the Church of the Good Shepherd.  This last week
it was retold in a postcard addressed to Mayor La Guardia
at City Hall, and in a letter received by this paper from a 
shop foreman who said that 300 workers in the shop are 
talking about it.  Both referred to the Church of the 
Good Shepherd.

"Inquiry at the Church of the Good Shepherd brought a reply
from the secretary to the pastor, the Rev. John H. Sullivan,
that 'there is no truth whatsoever to the story."  The
rumor has been going around the neighborhood for weeks, she 
added.

"The (name of paper) also inquired about these rumors at the
Chancery of the Archdiocese of New York. Msgr. Edward R. 
Gaffney, vice chancellor, told this paper, that the chancery 
has heard of them and stated that 'there has been absolutely 
no verification or confirmation of any of them.'

"It is understood the chancery made its own investigation
whenever the rumor appeared.

"Col. Arthur V. McDermott, director of Selective Service, 
denounces the rumor as 'an outright lie from start to
finish.'  There never has been a dispute over a religious
incident, he says; no priest ever has been involved in an
altercation with a draft board and no draft board has ever
been closed."
