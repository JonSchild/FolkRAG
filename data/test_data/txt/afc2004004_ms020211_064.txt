Dear Peter: 

Enclosed is original and copy of recording contract
for MY GOD IS A ROCK IN THE WEARY LAND.  This is
between you, as the lead singer, and Vanguard Records,
who is putting the song on the Newport Folk Festival
record.  Ryerson Music is the publishing company owned
by Vanguard.

I have read the contract over and it looks all right.
Just sign your name on the third page of both copies
on the line right above your typed name (next to the X). 
Then return the contract to Vanguard in the enclosed
envelope. 

I hope you received the tape which I sent of this
song to you.

Hope to see you all soon.

All the best,

Alan Lomax
