My dear Mr. Lomax:
     Your letter to Helen Dziadik has been brought to 
my attention.
     We have what might be considered an old time
fiddler who has on various occasions played some of the
old time dances; he also has a lady who accompanies him.
We also have a man in our community who has called dances
for quite a number of years.
     We are not sure that these people play the type of
old time music you are interested in obtaining. However,
in checking over, there seems to be some noticeable 
differences.
     We would be glad to have you come to our school and
make a recording, if you consider it worthwhile.

Very truly yours,
