go be directly & intensely into the 
microphone, really telling it the 
story with friendliness, [confidence]
confidentially, [mall] smiling & 
chuckling from time to time. Mainly 
though one watched the bright 
eyes, twinkling & shining like a 
child's - but the face, a little 
satanic,  full of mischief, full 
of light - Tolstoyian charm 
& authority there.
His wife in red sweater & 
checked skirt is a big a woman 
too.  Still handsome, but now 
wide & soft in the body.  Must 
have been pretty one time, for her 
nose is shapely & her mouth quiet 
with satisfaction.
His son is slim & spare; big bony 
nosed inteligent - like the father in 
the deep sunk bright eyes.
