DIRECTOR
COLUMBIA MASTERWORKS  June 6, 1940
Dear Alan:
I have received from Mr. Roos in Bridgeport a note
from which I quote:
"We regret to say that we do not have any record 
of a Columbia master #15565-D either in the shape
of the master number or a work sheet to cover that
number. This number given being the only identification 
to work from, we have exhausted our efforts, 
with no results."
Since Mr. Roos is the soul of accuracy and conscientiousness
and knows more about the subject
of work sheets, etc. than anybody in the plant,
I don't know what more I can do about the subject,
unless you can furnish me with some more information
Sincerely,
[Moe?]
Mr. Alan Lomax
