Connecticut, but it will be 
for only two months, which 
is a comforting thought to 
me, also.

With warm regards to 
both of you, and best wishes 
always,
yours sincerely,
Ade S. Benedict.

P.S.
If you don't want this
letter back, I should like 
to keep it for my Choate
files. 
Yondell Benedict 
is a Choate.
