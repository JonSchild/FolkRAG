AL:    That's what dogs are for, to keep us company, make us
feel better.

Man:   He won't leave, he'll lay on the door, I can go in
the door and stay for, I guess, all day and night, and
he'll still be laying there when I come out.

AL:   Listen, let's go over to the [pet] fence (?). . .

Technical interruption).   (Plane noises, dog barking,
shouting.)

Man:   There, come here, now.   Come here! . . . .I never have had
him do that, there ain't no telling where he'll take me to.
Not that way.

Crew:   Well you usually have him come in, right?

Man:   Yeah, he brings 'em to me.   I never have had him
(unintelligible). . .He's a pretty good dog. . .(Technical
talk). . .come on, boy, come on, that's good.

ROLL 7 INTERVIEW WITH APPALACHIAN CLOGGERS
AL:    We're here on the front steps of Carol Nelson's house
on the outskirts of Canton, on the edge of the Smoky Mountains,
and its' the town of champion paper, and champion square dance
teams, I guess there's probably more square dancing and
clogging centered in Canton than in anywhere else in the
world, isn't there?   I mean this is the real capital of the
whole thing, this is Maggie Valley and we have champion dancers
here on the steps.   Why doesn't everybody sort of introduce
themselves.   (Technical talk).   Just say your name and whatever.

Man:   My name is Carroll Anderson and I dance with the
Rough Creek Cloggers.   (He repeats this at request of cameraman)
