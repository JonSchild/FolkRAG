Tape:  Roll 40,  Hicks        p.9

"Honey, the next time you see it, you just don't say nothin' and
leave the door open, come and tell me and I'll go see."   Well,
when I went in the house, there was a black snake, and its head
had come down thru the loft (?) and down thru this.   Its head was
stickin' thru a knot hole in the closet you know.   I rushed and
got my automatic rifle.   There wasn't nobody in there but just
us three  (unint.)  out of the room (unint.) when I fired, cut
him right thru the throat and the head and the bullet went on
thru (unint. . . .) and then it went on and put a hole thru my
roof, so I had to patch it.
