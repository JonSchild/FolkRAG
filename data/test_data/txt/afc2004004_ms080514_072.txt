[*[*] We went to see Lois Short at her home, way
back up in the hills near Harland County.
Her father's been a coalminer all his life,
had taught ah Lois many songs, and how to
play the banjo, and ah she devoted her leisure
time to this, as so many mountain women have. [*]*]

[*[*] You, you must remember that ah it's [*]*] down- 
it's [*[*] through the women that ah ballads and
songs in a great part [*]*] have been handed - 
have been, [*[*] have been passed on. [*]*]  The women
were the songer [?] members and they sang the
songs to comfort their - and console their
and teach their children at night, and during 
the long periods when their husbands were 
away at the hunt, or to town to get - to sell
the little grain that  they might have to sell.

[*[*] And so Lois' songs go back far into the lives
of women in the mountains.  It was a hard
harsh existence, ah, in a little house all
cut off in some mountain cove, with a man who
was over burdened with work, and, and might,
and, and had to be a tyrant to make things go. [*]*]
