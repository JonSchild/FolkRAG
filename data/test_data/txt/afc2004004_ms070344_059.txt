inspector of schools - a squarish
nearly bald gent of 45.  The teacher
of Gaelic, younger & more romantic
a former sailor is still around.

many of which comes from
books.  [Marian?] has a notebook
of songs she wrote down when
she was going to Gaelic school.

Abby's much more of a country girl - small
dark, shy intense - false teeth at the age of
24 or 25 - she lives at home on a small
farm with her family, goes to the local
[caeli?] on Sat. night, attends Gaellic school,
finds recognition by singing in concert
and going to the yearly Gaellic Language
Festival in Dublin.
