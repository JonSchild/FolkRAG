Dear Sir:

Under date of August 10, 1942, Mr. Heber R. Harper, Regional Di-rector, Social Security Board, Region XI, Denver, Colorado instructed me to continue the study of rumors which came to my attention during the period August 10 to 15 inclusive.

I am glad to advise as follows: During the period August 10 to 15 I visited a number of retail stores, listened to the conversations of pedestrians, visited newspaper offices where news bulletins are posted daily, conversed with a number of business men and performed the normal duties of my office.

During this time I heard of but one rumor. In Denver on August 11th a lady told me she had heard that all of the better grades of meat now available in the west would be sent to the eastern states because the ceiling prices for meat were higher in the east than in the west, there-fore the people in the west would have to expect poorer grades of meat but still have to pay the same prices as at present.

No other items which could be considered as rumors came to my attention. I did hear the following conversation between two men who were talking to each other; one man made the following statement, "Russia seems to be going down very fast, if Russia is knocked out completely, we will never be able to win the war."

Very truly yours,
