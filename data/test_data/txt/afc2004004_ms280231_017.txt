11)  They hadna been afloat, afloat,
A league but barely half,
When the lift grew laicht and the wind blew high
And the ship it was a wreck.

12)  "O wha will I get a bonny boy
To take my steer in hand,
While I climb up the high topmast
And see if I can spy land?"

13)  He hadna climbed a step, a step
A step but barely ane,
When the bows of our goodly ship did break
And the salt sea it come in.

14)  O laith, o laith were our guid Scots lairds
To wet their cork-heeled shoon,
But lang ere all the ploy was done
They wet their hats aboon.

15)  O lang, lang will our ladies sit
With their fans into their hand,
Before they see young Patrick Spens
Come sailing tae the land.

16)  Half ower, half ower by Aberdower
Where the sea'd sae wide and deep.
It's there it lies young Patrick Spens
Wi' the Scots Lairds at his feet.
