Dear Alan,
The Center Arts Council of the Minneapolis Walker Art
Museum is sponsoring a series of three folk music concerts 
to be held on the stage of the Tyrone Guthrie
Theater in January and February of 1964.  The Council
has asked me to contact performers whom I feel would
be of primary interest in a serious concert series.
We would like to have Bessie Jones and her group of
singers for our February 8th date, to appear with (tentatively) 
Sleepy John Estes and Mississippi John Hurt.
Could you tell me where to get in contact with Bessie
or whoever arranges her appearances for her?  We need to
know whether she will be available on this date and
her terms for the engagement.
The first concert, on January 28th, will feature the
New Lost City Ramblers, Roscoe Holcomb, and Doc Boggs;
the third, on February 22, will have Ashley and group,
Jean Ritchie, and Jimmie Tarlton (all hopefully, at
this writing).
Hope to hear from you as soon as possible.
Best wishes,
Jon Pankake
