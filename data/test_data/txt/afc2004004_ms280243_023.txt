TAPE 97: JEANNIE ROBERTSON.

The Old Beggarman:
1)  There was an auld beggarman
And he was dressed ing green,
And he was asking lodgings
At a place near Aberdeen.
Chorus:
Nae mair I'll gang a-rovin',
A-roving in the nicht;
Nae mair I'll gang a-rovin',
Though the moon shines e'er so bright.

2)  He wadna lie in the barnie,
Nor yet intae the byre,
He wouldna lie nae other place
But at the kitchen fire.

3)  He put his hand into his pouch,
He gied her gunieas three,
O tak' ye this, my bonny lass,
For to pay the nurse's fee.

4)  For if ye had been a decent lass,
As I took you to be,
I would hae made you the Queen
O' all the counteree.

5)  He took a horn frae his side,
He blew it liud and shrill.
And five and twenty noblemen
Came tripping o'er the hill.

6)  He took a pen-knife frae his pouch
And let all his tatters fall.
And he was the brawest hieland man
That stood amansgt them all.

The Laird of Drum:
1)  The Laird of drum a hunting's gane,
All in the morning early-o,
And it was there that he spied a weel fair maid,
She was a-shearing her father barley-o.

2)  "O lassie would you fancy me
And let your shearing be-o?
If ye'll gang wi' me tae the Castle o' Drum,
And could ye fancy me-o?"
