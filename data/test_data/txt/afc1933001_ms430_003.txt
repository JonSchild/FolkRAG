Campaign Song from St. Cloud, Minn.
Sing a song of Unions ever growing stronger,
Workers all uniting in a common cause, 
Everyone is equal, we are slaves no longer;
Let our cry be "Onward, on without a pause."

The Boss is in his office counting up his 
profit.
The Worker toiling very hard to earn his 
daily bread.
The Union here is helping him to put some
butter on it.
Why not join the Union? Why not use your head?
Organizer - Olga Sword
