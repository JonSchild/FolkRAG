The streets is full of women prostitutin round. Callin men to come to em. Some of em don't even want money. Jes give em a pint of wine. A woman is a woman, long as she look all right an ain't been batted round. A man can git a woman. I ain't got no business grabbin you if you say no. It's my place to ast, yo place to grant or deny. If you say no I got to go on about my business. If I grab you, I got to die. I got it gainst yo will. I should pay for it. I overpower you. I should die. 
(I deny that the punishment fits the crime. He shouts) You talk Miss Lizybeth, cause it ain't happened to you. A body git you in that kinda place, an you won't keer what they done with him. 

A white man in Greenville, N.C., called a twelve-year-old colored girl to wash out some dirty clothes for him. He put his gun in her face an
split huh wide open. The white folks knowed he did it. They got that boy away from there. It never come to no conclusion that I knowed about. (high falsetto scream) What could huh people do? Nothin.
If your dog bites somebody else, you'll try to compromise it some way. If he bites you, you'll kill yo own dog. See what I'm talkin bout? Thass a parable.
We b'long to the white people. If we fool wid a white woman, they'll
kill us. We ain't got no law. We b'long to them.

A woman ought not to milk a man an then not give him what he's after. Some of these hearses'll do that. Hearses. Yeah. Less than a lady. Some of em'll mess round an raise de law on a man.
It was a long time fore I got mysef tamed to white women. If I jes
brush up against one I was lookin for somebody to lynch me.
