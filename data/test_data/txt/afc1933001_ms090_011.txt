Mr. John A. Lomax, Dallas, Tex.

Dear Sir: Yours of 1-5-42 recd.

I can't say that I expect to be in Dallas or Ft. Worth soon, if I would be
I would sure drop around to see you. Your idea of recording the shouts or hollers
you spoke of is a brand new thought to me, but a good one, and I am interested in it.
All such as that is fastly going, but I have just realized it lately, these days
will soon be history only. I don't suppose you would be interested in coming away
out here just to hear me holler but if you should I will do all I can. Another
thing to be considered is after you get here I might not be able to give you what
you are hunting for. It seems to me that it is a little hard to understand just
what would be best, as it might be that cowboys had different ways of hollowing
for different purposes. I have thought a great deal about it since I read your
request, and more I think further I get into it.

Do you make the way I would hollow to hurry, start, turn, pivot, stop close
or at a distance, of do you mean how it should be done (if at all), or how others
did it? In case there was a difference. Would you like to know just whate effect
sounds had on cattle, if any? I would think that we should have to consider the
wildness and the gentleness of the cattle, the direction the wind is from, also if
 a bluff near to cause an echo and many other things too numerous to mention.
At any rate it's a great idea and should be recorded. Walt Cousins there in Dallas
might be able to help you. I believe you overlooked one hollow; it is the meaningless,
wild, senseless, excites scream, given by the boy or man in his first stampede. I have
heard sever l scream like a woman the first time a herd came towards them, and afterwards
did not know they had opened their mouth. If I can help you any I will be glad
to do so. If The Cattleman would like to have this letter it is O.K. with me.
With best wishes
Sloan Matthews
