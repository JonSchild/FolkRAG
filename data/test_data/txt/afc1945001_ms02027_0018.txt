JOHNSON DENIES
[*JOHNSON*]
SUGAR SHORTAGE

Congressman Also Says There
Is No Serious Lack
of Rubber

CRAWFORDSVILLE, Ind., Aug.
13 (Spl.) -- "There is actually no serious
shortage of rubber and there is
no shortage of sugar in this country,"
asserted Noble Johnson, Sixth
district congressman, addressing 40
Republican workers attending a 
Montgomery county rally last night
at Sportsman's park near here. Dr.
Thomas L. Cooksey, Crawfordsville
mayor, and O. Bruce Lane, joint
senator from Montgomery and Putnam
counties, also spoke briefly.
  Asserting that the government
had paid large sugar companies
huge sums not to produce sugar
within the last year, Johnson added
that such large quantities of sugar
have been stored that there may 
be no place to store the coming
year's production. He indicated
that one purpose of the sugar rationing
card was to compile accurate 
information with regard to
every man, woman and child in the
nation.
  Johnson criticised the President's
veto of a bill that would have established
a separate agency beyond the
control of WPB to govern production
of synthetic rubber. This action,
the speaker said, was a blow to 
plans to encourage use of farm products
to produce butyl rubber.
  He predicted American way of
life will vanish if the two-party system
is ever destroyed. "And," he
said, "the New Deal wishes to destroy
the minority party and have 
a congress composed entirely of its
followers."
