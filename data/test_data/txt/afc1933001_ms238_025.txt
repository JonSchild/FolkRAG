transpires I'll be ready to welcome
you, to apologize for you (if
necessary [Its nice, or isn't it? to 
have a father about], so that
the program may go forward
with or without 
you.  

Anyhow I thank you 
for your two letters.  Here,
underneath these oak trees, at
any time, are rooms for 
you and Elizabeth to stay
as long as you like, with 
the [?] of Miss Terrill and 
myself, a whole section 
of the Lomax menage. 
Affectionately, 
Father.
