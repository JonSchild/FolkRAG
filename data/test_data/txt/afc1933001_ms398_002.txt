The Sheldon Fellowship

When the check for $500.00 came from Harvard University for my
first year as a Sheldon Fellow, I was the happiest person in the
world. Never before at one time had I owed so much money, money that
brought me both honor and responsibility. Behind that check and two
others for equal amounts that followed were George Lyman Kittridge,
Barrett Wendell, Fred N. Robinson and dear Dean Briggs. The Harvard
gift said somewhat formally that it was to be used "for the investigation
of American ballads," and I was entirely free to spend it all 
in running down the words and music of cowboy songs. In a glow of
anticipation I made plans to travel the entire summer following throughout
the cattle country. Shyly I told a few of my friends about my 
good fortunes. I sensed an unexpected reaction. Some were frankly
sceptical of the value of the job; others wondered that Harvard University
should volunteer to help. Nearly all were frankly indifferent.
From then onward I hid my enthusiasm. For an untrained novice the
opinion of the home-folks is a discouraging barrier. But I steeled
my determination. It proved a long and hard road that I started on
that summer as I made my way walking, on horsebac, by buggy, train
and automobile. Altogether my journeyings have carried me possibly
half a million miles. Very few of my associates in the University
of Texas expressed sympathy or took the project seriously. For them
the raw crude product of the West had no interest, no value, no charm
whatever. A Governor of Texas quoted stanzas of my cowboy songs and 
sneered at the University of Texas through me to cheering crowds, just 
as he sneered at a teacher of zoology, asserting repeatedly that this 
professor was trying to make wool grow on the back of armadillos.
