Jean Evans will hand to you, next week,
Miss Corse's latest letter about the Florida
folk-song work. Her only additional
request was for the loan of our BC-AC genemotor
for use in recording the songs of the fishing fleet
en scene.

The Rickard records are to be found in
boxes numbered 2589 to 2728. They were made in
Kingsville, Texas, and I think they will be found
at the beginning of the series. It might be a wise
idea to stall a little bit and find out from father
what records were promised Mr. Rickard, although
there may be so few as to make this not of great
importance. [*(Father will write airmail)*]

I have had great trouble in locating a
person to sing shanties for my next CBS program.
I think, however, that I shall be able to put
together an annual report tomorrow and have it on
your desk by Saturday morning. I can be reached 
here until next Wednesday morning, after which time
my mail should be addressed c/o Helen Harkness-
Flanders, Smiley Manse, Springfield, Vermont.

Yours,
Alan Lomax

p.s. Sidney Robertson has made a set of copies
of her Gold-Rush records which were expressed to
me some days ago, care of the library. Please rush
them along, express-collect, care of the Hotel Albert
assoon as they arrive ,because they will contribute
greatly to the success of my next performance.
