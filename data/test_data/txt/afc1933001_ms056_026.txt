Port Aransas, Texas

Dear Harold: Notice of the shipment of the machine came this
morning. Thank you sincerely.
    Also a special air mail from Dornbush asking that a decision
be made this week. I've done my best, as the enclosed copies of
correspondence till show. His letter raises several new points
which may be impossible to solve in so short a time. I am
sending to Dornbush the original letter to me from Broome of San
Angelo.
    Yours in great haste,
    Lomax
