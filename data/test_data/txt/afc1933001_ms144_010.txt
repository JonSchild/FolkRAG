Mr. Alan Lomax
124 West 12th Street
New York City

Dear Alan,

This morning a Mr. William A. Logan (of Alabama) dropped in on me and introduced himself as a collector of Negro spirituals.  His enthusiasm seemed very genuine and he had with him a little notebook containing tunes picked up here and there.  Two of these sounded right attractive.  Unlike most people, he had no special axe to grind or project to further, but he expressed a great desire to meet one of the Lomaxes.  So I am writing to you to know when you will be in Washington and if you can see him for a few minutes.  Mr. Logan will be very glad to arrange to meet you anywhere at any time.  He will be here in the city for approximately three weeks, staying at the Portland Hotel, 14th Street & Vermont Avenue, N.W.

Best regards to you and Elizabeth.
Sincerely yours,

ENW
