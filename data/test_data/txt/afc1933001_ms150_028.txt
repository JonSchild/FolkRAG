Dear Alan:

I tried to reach you when you were in New York for the Musiological Society convention but somehow missed each time I thought I had tracked you down.

This last July I won a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation to study sound and music in motion pictures, and have just come up here to help with music on several productions:  one of these productions is to be a picture about Minnesota, its history, its people, and its present condition. The score for this picture we believe should be based on music indigenous to Minnesota, which means of course that this music should be taken from Minnesota Indian lore and the various types of Scandinavian music. Could you help me in my hour of need by sending me a bibliography of all the stuff published by the library which deals with Minnesota music. The library here at the University of course has a great deal of material but I know that the Congressional Library has access to reams of stuff. That is why I am asking you for this help. Will you send it up as soon as it possible as I can only remain here for five weeks.

I expect to be back in New York by December 1 and would like to see you when you come to New York. I know also that Hanns would like very much to hear from you. His address is 49 West 74th St., New York City. My best to Elizabeth.

Yours,

Harry Robin
