THAT OLD PICKET LINE

The following excellent new words for the fighting old sone, "The Picket Line," were written by Sark of Chrysler, Highland Park

The time has come to recognize The workingman's just rights. No decent man should be denied The things for which he fights. A living wage to help him through While makers change design, Is one complaint that forces him To walk the picket line!

Chorus:
On the line, on the line,
On the picket, picket line,
We'll shout and yell
And fight like hell!
On the picket, picket line. 

Who paid a quarter million bucks
For doublecrossing spies
To crawl like rats into our homes
'Neath friendship's fair disguise?
If men must lose their souls to work
In such shops we decline!
So now we voice our protest
In a moving picket line!

For two long years the law has said
Majorities shall rule,
Yet auto makers everywhere
Just laugh in ridicule!
When such disdain for justice
Meets no reprimands or fines, 
No wonder men star[5] seizing plants,
[And] start forming picket lines!

Our fight is not for us alone
But for workmen everywhere,
The rights we ask are not unjust
But sensible, and fair
To wear a Union button now
Your duty is, and mine-
We'll win this strike when all of us
Get in that picket line!

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN OUR SHOPS

Collective Bargaining in our shops
C I C I O
And in our shops it makes us strone
C I C I O

Chorus
With a union here,  a union there,
Here a union, there union, everywhere a 
union
Collective bargaining in our shops
C I C I O

When the strike is done and we have won,
C I C I O
We'll hang the scabe one by one
C I C I  O

Chorus
With a scab scab here, and a scab scab
there, here a scab, there a scab,
everywhere a scab scab
A union here, a union there, etc.

Our boys are sitting in the shops
C I C I O
And they won't come out till the
speedup stops
C I C I O

Chorus 
With a sit down here, and a sit down there,
Here a sit, there a sit
Everywhere a sit sit,
A scab scab here, etc. etc.

And as the years go drifting by
C I C I O
The Auto Union will not die
C I C I O

With a union here a union there
Here a union, etc.
A sit down, here, etc.
