Cox: It is.
Lomax: What do you think folks gave up sing those for?
Cox: Buggered if I know. 'Cause they didn't know 'em.
Lomax: Think they'd have learned them by. . .?
Cox: I should give up if I got nowhere to go. I mean, I would, nobody
not knowin' what I do know; they don't - they don't have any interest
in what I know. (pause) Well, what they know I don't want to hear. I
know - I could set an' sing - I do, there's plenty o' times o'
nights I set - I set an' sing. I go into the other old inn there
an' set an' sing five or six songs. Plenty o' times I done it - to
amuse myself. I like to hear them old songs. I don't want to listen
to these other things. I wouldn't listen to them.
Lomax: Young people don't want to hear any of these songs?
Cox: Lot o' them don't hear, an' the other one do. An' then, there's
half o' 'em don't, so you don't get on. (pause) Now you're goin' to
get this other one, aren't you?
Lomax: The Captain's Apprentice, yeah.
Cox: Yeah. You have heard that?
Lomax: No.
Cox: (laughs) (long pause) All right. I'll have a go.
Come all you men, throughout this nation,
I will have you warning take by me.
Don't be like, ill treat your servant
When you sail on the raging sea.
