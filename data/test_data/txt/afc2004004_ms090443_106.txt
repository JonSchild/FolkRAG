AL:  You were working for free? 
WB:Yes and Gertrude's Mother and daddy run the kitchen.

AL:They weren't scared of their 12 year old daughter shacking up with
a man permanently?
WB:They were the ones that fixed it.

AL:Why did they want to do that?  Did they feel you were going to
do it anyway?
WB:They were raising her up in the levee camp.  AS soon as she gets
large enough she's gonna be with some woman's husband.  So after I
went out there they were trying to prevent that.  They were gonna
let her get somebody all her own when she was old enough.

She'd go in the kitchen and help her mother.  She used to get
up in the morning before I got up there and go in.  They had that 
old salt meat with the ribs in it.  You know they used to cure that 
salt meat but they wouldn't take the ribs out if it.  They'd leave
it with th[v]e ribs in it.  She'd cut the ribs o[?]ut of it and she'd 
she'd save that for to go in gravy, beans, or whatever her mother
was fixing for dinner.
