Dear Miss Densmore,

Your [letter which] inquiry about the naming of Haitian
drums has been referred to me for an answer. Since I have
just returned from a four months recording trip to Haiti, I
am able to supply a certain amount of information on the subject.

[First for the references, however Page 272-277] 
The best reference I can supply - and this will probably 
answer your question satisfactorily -
is pp. 272-7, "Life in a Haitian Valley," by Melville Herskovitz, published
by Alfred Knopf, 1937. [This is the only reliable reference I
know of, for there have been very few books or articles
written]

[As you will notice Herskovitz uses the baptism 
the vaudou drums as an example of a culture trait that runs
through the entire religious life of the Haitian peasant. The People
are baptized, therefore the cult objects of vaudou are baptized and even the food given the gods is baptized before it is offered.
Herskovitzs material speaks for Mirebalais. Since the drums
are important in calling the gods and since they each one has
its voice, each vaudou drum has its name. And until it is baptized,
it cannot serve effectively in a vaudou ceremony.]

Herskovitz speaks for the region of the Central plain
about Mirebalais. I can confirm his observations in regard to the
baptism of drums and other cult objects from experience in the
Plain of the Cul-de-Sac
