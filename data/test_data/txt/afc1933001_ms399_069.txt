of a man, youthful, athletic, always ready with a story or a 
song, a knight of the Golden West in its golden cattle days.

There were girls in Bosque County. Some belonged to the
church, and, under church rules, could not dance where the
music was made by the fiddle. So, to avoid trouble, at gatherings
the young folks sang songs set to fiddle music. Bob was
the favorite leader, singing to keep time and giving the square 
dance calls in between the lines of the songs.

A commotion on the long gallery outside! "Here comes Bob,"
someone shouted.  Into the big front room, where the girls were seated on
chairs around the walls, would stride Bob, hat off, spurs
jingling merrily.  A swing of the hat, a sweeping bow. "Hello everybody!
Come on girls and cowboys! Git partners for 'Weevily Wheat,'"
and the fun was on.

As in the regular square dance, either four couples, or
eight couples when the crowd was large, danced the figures as
Bob called them, and the crowd joined him in singing:

Weevily Wheat

Oh Charley, he's a nice young man,
Charley, he's a dandy;
Every time he goes to town,
He brings them girls some candy.

Chorus

Oh I won't have none of your weevily wheat,
I won't have none of your barely,
It'll take some flour and half an hour
To bake a cake for Charley.
