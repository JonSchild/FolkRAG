The Sheldon Fellowship

When the check for $500.00 came from Harvard University for my first year as 
a Sheldon Fellow, I was the happiest person in the world. Never before at one time had
I owned.so much money,- money that brought me both[e] honor and responsibility. ^[Behind that check ???? equal ??? Briggs.] The Harvard
gift said somewhat formally that it was to be used "for the investigation of American
ballads," and I was entirely free to spend it all in running down the words and music
of cowboy songs. In a glow of anticipation I made plans to travel the entire summer following
throughout the cattle country. Shyly I told a few friends about my good fortune.
I sensed an unexpected reaction. Some were frankly sceptical of the value of the job;
others womdered that Harvard University should volunteer to help. Nearly all were frankly
indifferent. From then onward I [have] hid my enthusiasm. For an untrained novice the
opinion of the home-folks is a discouraging barrier. But I steeled my determination.
It proved a long and hard road ^ I started on that summer as I made my way walking, on horseback, by buggy, train and 
automobile. Altogether my journeyings have carried me possibly half a million miles.
Very few of my associates in the University of Texas expressed sympathy or took the 
project seriously. For them the raw crude product of the West had no inter4st, ^no value, no charm
whatever. A Governor of Texas qu[a]oted stanzas of my cowboy songs and sneered at the 
University of Texas through me to cheering crowds, just as he sneered at a[n] [associate in biology] teacher 
of zoology, asserting repeatedly that th[a]is professor was trying to make wool grow on
the backs of armadillos. Both of us were sorry fools.

Such early experiences added to my self-consciousness and restrained any disposition
to egotism. Perhaps also through them I ^afterwards found ^extra pleasure in the two following incidents:

Charlie Cason and I had planned a foolish undertaking. We were walking from
the rim of the Grand Canyon to the Colorado River and back by way of Bright Angel Trail.
Perpendicularly, when we started, the river was said to be a mile below us.
The winding, dusty trail we adventured meandered, as I recall, eight miles to the river with 
the same distance,-only farther,- back up the steep way. The clouds of dust from the
shuffling feet of mule trains traveling the same route added at least another fifty per cent
