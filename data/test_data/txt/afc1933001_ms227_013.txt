headed in my direction. Owen
is to be the man. In any case
an insurmountable difficulty
would be Lutcher Stark, who
is still an influential Regent
(a multi-millionaire, also)
Lutcher would never agree for
my name to be connected with
the University in any manner.

But I sent your letter
on to Dobie for him to
mull over, and, I thank you
for your flattering opinion of
my ability to do the job.

I'm glad you like your
own book. You need not refer anything
else about the book to me.
You and Ruth are fine. I have
written again to Thompson telling
him to send his copy direct to you. Also I wrote
to Dr. Davies a month ago. I think it is safe to
go ahead. He's a dilatory letter writer.

Lovingly,
Father
