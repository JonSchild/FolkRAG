Dear Alan Lomax--
We caught your article in the New York 
Times magazine for Jan 26th -- very good.
Also your father's last snatch from his
Adventures in the Atlantic (or was it Harpers)
whets our appetite for the complete books.
Frances Gilmor writes that she saw a copy
of Stith Thompson's Folktale study -- but it
must have been an advance edition because I 
have not been able to locate one.
Can you tell me what is wrong with
the record sales division of the Library of 
Congress? I wrote some time ago about ordering
some of the recordings you told me about last
summer, but perhaps they cannot read -- at 
least no one replies to my inquiries re prices
and availability. Do you have any influence?
Niles sings for us at Stanford in
March -- We shall serenade him with a 
carillon recital of American folk music.
When are you to visit California again?
