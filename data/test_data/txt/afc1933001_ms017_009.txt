June 13 1934

Dear Mr. Engel:

I have your memorandum of the 11th, referring to
certain suggestions in the letter from Dr. Lomax dated June 7th.

I quite concur with your comments. On the other
hand, it is quite  clear that no appropriation for the coming
year will be available for service in connection with the Folk
Song Project. I shall of course repeat in the estimates for the 
following year the request for the subordinate position. I see
no prospect, however, that I could expect to secure a more substantial 
salary requisite for the position of Director of the
Archive, which is, I suppose, what Dr. Lomax would have in mind.

Until the conclusion of the grant to him for the
service in the field, I do not, therefore, see any way of assigning 
to him a place upon our regular roll, or a compensation.
There would seem no propriety in dropping the honorary.

Faithfully yours,
Herbert Putnam
