BJ TAPE 20, p.23

they would say:  "That's my girl an' I's responsible for her. 
Man, don't you walk with her.   Man,..."   See, I don't like that. 
I would get, how, mad; I walk with who I please; don't            me. 
So I would say... !   What I mean, I didn't like it! (??) So, 
therefore, I ain't never had that kinda mind, an' I'm glad I 
didn't.   I'm glad I cut in there where I did [come] cut in, now, 
an' had no trouble with no boys, hum-um.
            But that's the way, that's what I called, that they 
called co'tin'. 
TL:        How did you ever get with your husband, then?  What do you 
call that stuff?
BJ:         I was goin' with him. 
TL:        You were goin' with him?
BJ:         Um-hum...
TL:         But that's not courting?
BJ:         That's not the way I call courting.   See?
TL:        Oh!   Well, what is that, then?
BJ:         Well, that just goin' with him.   That's all.   I taken -- 
He, he, he was just a man an' I jus' went on with him;  that was 
all.  That's not courting.
TL:         Well, did he come up and ask?  (SOUND FADES OUT HERE BADLY)
BJ:         Oh, oh, yes, he asked, of course 
Whatsoever was done, was done.  But yet an' still, I didn't call
it co'tin', 'cause I ain't never had my mind on co'tin'.   Huh, 
huh, huh!
TL:        Oh, no?
