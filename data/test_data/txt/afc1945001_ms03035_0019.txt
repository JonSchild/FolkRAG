Mr. William H. Webber  -2-  October 13, 1942

The Detroit Board of Commerce, of which much was expected, heard a
single rumor although seven of its key people listened. They
heard numerous opinions but only a single item which might be in
the category of rumors. Its secretary is Mr. Harvey Campbell,
Lafayette Blvd., Detroit.

Our union-man-in-war-industry, correspondent was Frank Davis,
employe of the Lincoln Motor Car Company, and president of
Lincoln Local No. 900, 7335 Livernois Avenue.

Our dentists were only fairly productive. We used Dr. Robert S.
Gregory, 22010 Michigan Avenue, Dearborn, with a mixed clientele
made up of 50 per cent Ford workers, rest local grocers, shopkeepers 
and what-not. We also watched through four staff dentists
of a local hospital, but all four turned in but a single rumor and
that came from a staff doctor rather than any patient.

Two other likely sources were asked to participate although not on
the list. These were the owner of a well patronized cafe and
restaurant and the owner of a downtown barbershop. Neither turned
up a single rumor. We are not sure, in their cases, however, that
cooperation was whole-hearted.

Very truly yours
W. C. Richards
Senior Field Representative
