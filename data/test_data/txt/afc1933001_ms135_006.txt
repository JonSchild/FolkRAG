Miss Marjorie Edgar,
Marine-on-St.-Croix,
Minnesota,

Dear Miss Edgar:

             The Archives of American Folk Song in the 
Library is planning for this summer a rapid recording
survey of folk music of Wisconsin, Michigan and
Minnesota. This work is to be done by a modern
field recording machine, with the idea in mind of
getting down in the most accurate fashion the folk
tunes and folk styles of the region, for preservation
and scholarly study.

              We naturally look forward to collaboration
with scholars in the regions in which we carry on
our work and Mrs. Sidney Robertson has written me
about your extensive work in the fields of Finnish
and Gaelic songs. She has further indicated that
you  might be willing to offer me some assistance
in my field work, especially in regard to suggesting
reliable and fertile informants.

           The Library will greatly appreciate whatever
you will be able to do and we can, I believe,
work out without any difficulty a plan which would
completely protect any material you wish to publish
until such time as you are ready for it to be made
public.

                 Do you plan to do field work, yourself, this
summer? Do you have any suggestions to make in regard
to interesting regions and informants? I should
appreciate an early reply to this inquiry, since I
plan to leave Washington on the fifteenth.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
