drunk - his business gone 
to Hell and him indifferent - 
Mrs. Larsen is a perennial 
invalid - unseen - she hopes 
to die - 
The bar is dreary - the hang 
out for the bums and the Finns 
- Kali Kalio - the Ape-man - 
lank straw colored hair - stubby
 hands - thick low body - a 
tree trunk neck - hard pale blue 
eyes -
