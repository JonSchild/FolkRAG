A female negro called a white lady who had run an advertisement 
for a colored servant. The negro was asked what she expected in 
the way of payment. Her reply was " $12.50 per week." The white 
lady protested, saying that the current wage scale for colored 
domestic help did not exceed one dollar per day and car fare. 
The negress replied to the effect that when Mr. Hitler won the 
war, the whites would be working for the negroes and at less 
wages than $12.50 per week. According to the conversation, 
the negress further amplified her statement by saying that the 
colored folk knew which side their bread was buttered on in the 
present world situation.  [*40*]
