percent of the rumors were believed.

Have you heard that the government is going to take all
the private automobiles from 1939 on?  I guess they'll
pay you something for them, but we might as well get
what pleasure we can from ours now.  We haven't stopped
driving a bit, and we're not going to.  We're driving
more if anything."  (Housewife, Birmingham, Ala. 8-15-42)

The Axis program on Radio DEBUNK seem to be designed to plant and promulgate
rumors.  There seems to be evidence of rumor campaigns among some
of the foreign language groups, and at least one of the domestic groups
that were isolationist pre-Pearl Harbor and still actively engaged in
the development of rumor campaigns.  Rumors can be effective weapons.
Rumors may arouse fears which tend to prevent the full contribution
to the war effort.  In Canada, for example, a very widely spread rumor
was the following:

"A girl employee in a shell-filling plant went to a
hair-dresser for a permanent wave.  As soon as the
power was turned on there was an explosion that blew
the girl's head off.  The explosion was caused by
explosive powder in her hair."

Such a rumor is not very helpful in securing a large supply of labor for
shell-filling plants.  Along the same lines we have New England rumors
of very high accident rates at the shipyards.  These stories have served
to prevent parents from giving permission to their children to go to the
shipbuilding centers to work in the yards.

During a recent rain storm a worker was injured and
became unconscious.  He was taken to a hospital in
an ambulance and was still unconscious at the time of
arrival at the hospital.  The guard who had escorted
him there came back and said that the man had not regained
consciousness.  Then the rumor spread about the
yard that the man was dead.  This rumor spread throughout
the yard and by 6:30 many of the workers had dropped
their work for the day and left the yard."  (Maine, Shipbuilding 
Yards)
