Dear Father:

     I am enthusiastic about the recording
of the cattle calls and hollers, especial-
ly after reading Mr. Matthews' catalog of
them.  But I don't see why you don't com-
bine the holler trip with a visit to
Woody's friends and with the recording
of Peter Hurd's Mexicans, which last pro-
posal appeals to me more than the others,
perhaps.  I'd suggest waiting until
warm weather and using what money you
have to make a combination trip.  How-
ever, it's up to you.  I wish I could
go along, and not stay here in this
office.  Do you need more needles?

     Elizabeth and I have just come back
from a superb and restful vacation at
Key West, which is as you have always
described it.  We are both brown and
healthy, and I will write you more
news as soon as I have caught up.  The
Men and Books broadcast is scheduled
for my birthday, Saturday, January 31.

                  Much love,

                       Alan
