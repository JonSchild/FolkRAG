My Dear Spivacke:

1. I approve of a restriction of 
three years on the records of Mr.
Alton C. Morris.

2. I can send you the machine
by fast express at any time.
Suppose you [wire?] so as to give me
every possible day. Address Lubbock,
Texas, 1618 Ave Y for a week; afterwards
c/o Republic Bank, Dallas, Texas.

3. I'll set out later my express
in ballad collecting for submission
to Mr. Putnam when he comes back.
Please understand that you have
promised nothing and that you will 
not be involved, though you did
say that you thought the matter 
of tips could be arranged.
