6. A program entitled "Tearin' Out the Wilderness". This
program should have to do with growth in this country and
should be a melange of material dealing with industrial
growth, with the development of regions,of trails through
the wilderness and with the people who had to do with this
development.

7. A program to be entitled " American Forum". ( This is an
idea of Nicholas Ray only reported by me here.) A round
table of Washington experts held weekly in the Library of
Congress to talk over the most important issue of the hour.
The program should be one hour long and should somewhat resemble
Fred Allen's forum except for a good deal more formality
and a good deal more newsworthiness. We shall have in
Washington the best minds in the country to discuss issues of
national import and give all sides a platform for self-expression.
The political issues behind the questions will add to the 
excitement of the program. The program should be broken in the
middle by a ten minute dramatization of the issue, using a 
group of folk characters to comment on and criticize informally
the formal presentation of the experts. Mr. Ray suggested
as a moderator a sort of Will Rogers, Artemus B. Ward, Mr. Dooley
sort of person who would take the edge off the argument and
point the questions for a mass audience.

8. A program to be entitled " Ask the Librarian". This program
should be a plug for the building. It should dramatize the
research activities of the Library. The MC sits in front of
his mike andntears open his letters, reading the questions as
he comes to them. The program should dramatize the process of
search and investigation necessary to properly answer a question,
should dramatize the particular problems of policy that affect 
our ability to answer questions. By proper documentation of
the machinery of the Library all of the fascination in the operation
of the building could be exemplified. The Library itself,
is a monument to democracy and the program could, I think, be
the most interesting quiz program on the air.

9. We must, of course, do a number of programs for Latin American
consumption and for inter-American consumption. Mr. Weisner
has suggested the possibility of the great short-wave station
in Boston and Schenectady taking transcribed programs from
the Library, particularly, if these have Spanish scripts. It
seems to me that with the number of persons in the Library who
handle Spanish and Portuguese, added to the Embassy staffs from
the various Latin American countries, we should be able to
supply this need easily.
