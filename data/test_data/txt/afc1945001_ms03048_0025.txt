13. All this stuff about British production being all out, is [*7f*]
all bull. I know, for a fact, that over half of what we produce is [*2*]
being sent over to England. If we don't have enough steel, where in
the H----do you think England is getting it from, on that little island?
Philadelphia--8/7/42. character - ?. Intelligence- below average.
Class- laboring.
14. The English don't allow their girls to go out with American [*2*]
soldiers.
Philadelphia--8/5/42. Character-good. Intelligence-below 
average. Class-laboring.
15. I hope my boy don't get sent to Ireland or England. I
understand that, over there, the Irish and English girls are capitalizing [*2*]
on our American soldiers' loneliness, and are over-zealous in
trying to get an American husband.
Harrisburg--8/5/42. Character -- excellent. Intelligence -- above 
average. Class -- middle.

Germany within the next thirty days, if the Allies don't open a second 
front? 
Philadelphia--8/5/42. Character -- above reproach. Intelligence --
above average. Firm supporter of Administration and war effort.
19. There is no doubt about it. Russia is licked. I heard
that Stalin has moved the Government from Moscow to Siberia, and he
is broadcasting to the people from Moscow, by electrical transcription.
Philadelphia--8/7/42. Not much is known about the person making
