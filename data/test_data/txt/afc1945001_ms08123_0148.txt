Rumors

There are Rumors that Hilter is very
sick or dead.  I also heard the War
would be over in 1943.  I hear
people are horting shoes, sugar, and
gasoline.  There are also rumors that 
we have plenty of sugar and meat 
in this country.  There were rumors that 
Hilter would eat his breakfast in 
New York in 1942.  I hear that we
are now eating horse meat.
