Barefoot Boy's Soliliquy

It matters not to me that they ration
shoes.
I was happy when I heard the news.
I can't be sorry; I must be glad
I'll get more shoes than I ever
had.

Going Home for the Duration

They say that the government is going
to send people back to the farms to
produce food for the United Nations -
Well I guess I'd better bundle
up and get on back home, cause that's
where I'm from.

Waac And Wave

Mr. Jones: We had so much trouble in trying to get
our War Ration Book II so we just let
the whole thing alone
Mr. Brown: Well what are you and your wife going
to do about canned foods.
Mr. Jones: Well, her idea was that soldiers,
and the waves could get all they
want. So I asked her what did she
mean.
Mr. Brown: What did she say?
Mr. Jones: She said you join the army and
I'll join the waves.
Mr. Brown: It's kind of put you in the hole
didn't it?
Mr. Jones: No. I said you join the Waves & I'll
visit you often.
