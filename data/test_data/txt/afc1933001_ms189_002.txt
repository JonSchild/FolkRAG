Dear Mr. Lomax:
You wrote me Sept. 15 about the possibility of 
my getting a Rosenwald fellowship to carry on with my
folksong collecting. Do you still think there is any
chance of this working out?
If there is any possible way for me to continue 
working with folksongs I shall do it, and there isn't
money enough in this country to get me into any other
job.
But if there is no chance for me to get a
fellowship or something of the kind, then I must
let folksongs go to hell and work at something else.
Would you mind telling me what the prospects
are?
Sincerely,
Vance Randolph
