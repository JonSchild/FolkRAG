Well, colored people, they, they , they put the rhythm in there. They
have, they got wonderful tones, too, they got good tonality, the majority
of them. They, they, whenever they make a chord, it chords, it sounds,
you know. And, uh,  I think it's pretty well equal now. At the national
convention  in Birmingham we had about two colored people come from
… Alabama... Now they can sing it like we do,
some of 'em can. But lots of 'em, lots of 'em, uh, at their regular

around in their way of singin'..
Did you ever go to hear old-time colored services out in the
country...
Yeah, I used to go to their meetin'. Oh, they'd have some meetin's--

I like it. I like to hear that spiritual music, I really like to

Well, yeah, I used to play with a man up here. And we used to
play on the stage and theaters and things, used to play square
dances.
I thought you religious people down here in the South disapproved

dancin', now there ain't no more wrong in square dancin' than there
is in goin' fishin'. As far as the Bible's concerned--the Bible
