Dear Doctor Goodchild:
     Attached is a tentative budget for Mrs. 
Jakobson's fellowship. I should appreciate
your comment ont it. I have asked her to
send me material on the exact communities 
she plans to work in along with a slightly 
more detailed plan for the fellowship. This
should be in your hands early next week.
     It is a matter of great satisfaction to 
me that you are interested in this project.
Mrs. Jakobson is to me one of the most capable
people I have met in the field of folk-lore.
Her point of view is that of a real scientist
in her field.
     Thank you for your interest, I am 
again
Sincerely yours,
AL s Alan Lomax
T Assistant in Charge of the 
Archive of American Folk-Song
