Psychology 150 
[*3/11*]
1. Three R.A.F. flyers were sent out to drop
pamplets of propaganda over German and were 
told to return to the air field as soon as
they had finished. Five hours passed and
only two men returned. Hours passed and 
they waited for the three man to return, but
there was no trace of him. Finally at the
end of the eighth hours he returned. The
commander in charge sent for him and
asked what happened since he only had 
to drop pamplets. The flyer seemed quite
surprised by saying, oh! I slid them up under the doors.

2. Can good ration wouldn't be so bad, said
a friend one day, if I could only get gas
to go south. At home my mother 
cans enough food to give me enough to
last until the war is over, but it just 
goes to show they have you from every
possible angle, however, I am sure some
people are able to think through this
thing.
