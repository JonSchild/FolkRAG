was about twelve years old when Burns was 28, you see, but Scott
was behind Burns, a great piece in years too, you see when Burns
was a man about 28 years old, Sir Walter Scott was 12 year old, you
see, he was a year behind Burns, and I believe, and believe yet
that, that Sir Walter Scott borrowed a lot of the poems or pieces
out of Burn's work. There was no doubt about that, he did that.
He was a good poet, Sir Walter Scott, but I think he borrowed a
lot. . .to fit in with his own works.
(This must have been a wonderful evening, at Fergusons house)
Oh it was a great evening, aye, oh aye ho, it was a great
it was a great night. They were all there, you know, and
(What happened)
Well, Sir Walter Scott was the first to stand up and speak about
the twa dogs, and of course Burns, know'd about the two dogs, he
head them in pictures. Sir Walter Scott thought he forgot about
them, and Dr. Ferguson, had them, had them on his wall there in
the, in the picture, about the twa dogs and Sir Walter Scott
                         about the twa dogs and he told Burns that he forgot
about the twa dogs and Burns put him mind that he did'nt forget
the twa dogs, he'd read all about the twa dogs before and 
Lady Nairn she tried to. . .she was first to. . .next to start off
with her, and off whe went to the door, and she cried, "Cock a 
doodle-doo," and she come back again and Burns he started to
laugh and, and so did Scott too and Dr. Ferguson laughed, and
he was poking the fire up, and he said to Burns, he said
"Man, that was a wonderful piece of work," he says, "I don't know
if you could say anything about that," he says "Robbie," he says,
