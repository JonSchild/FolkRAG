In the afternoon about 3 P.M. the Roda room filled
with hounsis [and] before the table loaded with
Damballa's food.  We were excluded from the service that
followed, but cd see the same woman (who seems to
be head hounsi) possessed again.  She was given the two
chickens (r for P Damballa, p for Aida Wedo) to inspect
and she passed them about the necks of
several women (part. the 2 fat women from PaP who
[were supposed] seemed to be paying for the service &
who were given the first place in everything).  Then
the chickens were killed and their bodies and
a platter of their blood carried to the cook-house.
All this was accompied by Damballa
songs.
In the evening the foregoing vêuvê was made
and pure sirop was poured as a libation
First of all however, three splashes of water before
the drums and a cinch about the [mitaur?].
