THE AULD BEGGARMAN (Child 279 Appendix)
sung by Maggie Chambers (with her sister Sarah joining in
the chorus), Tempo, Co. Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.
(Recorded by Peter Kennedy and Sean O'Boyle)
1.  As I went 'linkin' o'er the lee
The finest weel that I did see
Lookin' for his charity
"Would you lodge a lame poor man?"
For the night being wet and it being cold
She took pity on the poor old soul
She took pity on the poor old soul
And she bad' him for to sit down

With his tooran nooran nonton nee
Right ton nooran fol the doo-a-dee
Right ton nooran nooran nee
With his tooran nooran-i-do

2.  For he gat himself in the chimbley neuk
Within all his bags behind the crook
All his bags behind the crook
Right merrily he did sing

3.  For all the doors being locked quite tight
The old woman rose in the middle of the night
The old woman rose in the middle of the night
To find the old man gone
For she ran to the cupboard, likewise to the chest
All things there and nothing missed
Clapping her hands and "the dear be blessed"
"Wasn't he the honest old man?"

4.  When the breakfast was ready and the table laid
The old woman went to waken the maid
The bed was there and the maid was gone
She'd away with a lame poor man

5.  Seven years past and gone
And this old beggar came back again
Lookin' for his charity
"Would you lodge a lame poor man?"
For I never lodged any but the one
And with him my one daughter did gang
I'd choose you to be the very one
I'll have you to be gone

6.  If it's your one daughter you want to see
She has two bairns on her knee
She has two bairns on her knee
And a third one's comin' round
For thonder she sits and thonder she stands
The fairest lady in all Scotland
She has servants at her command
Since she went with a lame poor man
