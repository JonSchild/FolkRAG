Tape:   Sacred Harp--Interviews    31

Raymond:   You mean sweeping?   That's entirely up to the
individual.

AL:   You think it adds to the music a lot?

Raymond:   Well yeah, in some respects.   I think it 
gives you a good bit of dissonance in some of your chords
sometimes.   But if theyre singing it as an individual, as
a solo, its beautiful.   But I don't like to hear too much
sliding in the harmony parts.   Bass and treble and alto
should be, I think, right where they're supposed to be
and then let the melody slide if they will.   They're going
to anyway, you might just as well adjust to it.

AL:   This is old style Western European singing .

Raymond:   Yes it is.  Its traditional and in the old days,
of course, they learned it by ear from the old people
and each person that it was transmitted to put his own
imprint on it.

AL:   All over Ireland, they call it the  [blost] bladh, if you put
all those decorations on it.   Very elaborate.

Raymond:   And its lovely, it really is.   And you hear a lot
of that here.  I wasn't really so much aware of it until
I listened to a recording made at the first Sacred Harp
 singing over in Birmingham 2 years ago and they had a lady
sing a song by herself just to show how she sings, and it
was like listening to an old English minstrel, it was
beautiful.           (ENd of tape)
