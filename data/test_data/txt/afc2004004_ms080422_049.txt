Oh Daddy, what is that one about the babies . . . (singing)
Their little bones lay on the ground . . . . . . here I am a little
baby and he's singing me those songs . . . 
Nimrod: That's an old song . . . . . I'd sing that to her, she liked
it. She was always my baby.
AL: You never did sing any actual rockabye songs?
Phyllies: No, they were always the old ballads, like Lady
Gay . . . . 
Nimrod: About old baby Buntin', daddy's gon a'huntin,
catch a little . . . .skin, to wrap the bayby in,, stuff like that 
anything I could think of that would pacify her.
AL: Wouldyoulike to sing Lady Gay?. . . . . . 
Nimrod: Yeah, that's an old one too. That's on e I sang,
that Lady Gay . . . . I rode over to my wife's. Seemed like 
she was trying to get away. She had a boyfriend, he played
the guitar. He'd sing the Great Titanic. I'd sit there and 
wait for him to leave. She then told me she was going to
quit him. She come out of the kitchen and he's sitting ther
playing on that guitar, just right there singing, you know.
She comes through and I reckon got him by the hand Go on there (
And I started singing that song, I knowed it all, and so did
her and her mother and all. And her mother happened to know
it and I started playing the organ and looked out the window
and he was going down the road and I said goodbye old boy.
AL: That's the way you got your wife to quit her meanness?
