For this study, enlist the cooperation of six persons as follows:
1.  A dentist
2.  A policeman who walks a beat
3.  Proprietor or manager of a neighborhood drug store
4.  Local Chamber of Commerce, Kiwanis or other business 
club secretary
5. A local labor union official preferably in an industrial 
war plant
6.  A beauty parlor operator

Explain to them precisely what is meant by rumor for the purposes of this project 
and the information we want.  Be sure to let them know that they 
are to report each repetition of a rumor by a separate entry.  Secure 
their promised cooperation for the five days, October 5 through October 9.  
Check with them daily on the progress of their collection and send the 
whole collection in to us on Saturday, October 10.  While we prefer to 
have all rumor collections cover the period October 5 through October 9, 
we recognize that it may be impossible for some of you to make the necessary 
arrangements for October 5.  Where that is the case, begin it October 6 
and run it through October 10.  Do not recopy their reports, if they are 
legible.  Do not put more than one rumor report on a page.

We want a description of each person collecting the rumors, e.g., the 
type of practice which a dentist has, the neighborhood in which his 
office is located, whether a single racial group predominates in that 
district, etc.  The same applies to the policeman, the beauty parlor 
operator, etc.  If the person who is collecting the rumor lists comments 
regarding the individual who transmitted the rumor, that will be satisfactory.

In reporting, it would help if each rumor were written (or typed) on a 
5 x 8 filing slip, one to a slip.  If the stock 5 x 8's are not available, 
half of an ordinary letter sheet (backs of old mimeographed forms, 
etc.) should be used.  On each slip there should be the rumor, the city 
and State in which it was heard, the place or circumstances and the date.  
If reported by another person, indicate the source of the report.  
A sample rumor report follows:

      State: Nevada                 City: Reno            Reported by: J. K. Dentist
      
      Place or circumstances in which rumor passed: In dentist office.

Rumor: My aunt in Weehawken, New Jersey, said in one of her 
               letters that she had heard from a friend of hers that 
               the President of the ________ Aircraft Company 
               was hiring only __________ in the plant; that large 
               supplies of material were being brought into the 
               plant, but so far nothing had been turned out.
