I remember one night when I lay watching the flickering cowboy camp fire across the creek I saw a sudden flash of flame followed quickly by the Brook of a pistol. I covered my head in fright. Early [the]  next morning the cattle and the cowboys moved on over the brushy hills, Montana bound.

Later in the day my brothers and I visited the deserted camp. Near by under a cluster of live oaks were found a [freshly dug] mound of fresh earth [marking a grave]. A rough pine board had been stuck into [the earth] one end of the mound. On it was scrawled with lead pencil:  "Slim Critchlow cowboy done his damdest."  Later, the story of the tragedy sifted back [through the years] while [?] at supper one of the cowboys had [?-----?]
to one of the cowboys [called] another, [a fool ???]  His mates dashed a cup of hot coffee into his face and ran. He moved too slowly. The shot I had heard ended the life of another rough rider of the plain. 

"In a narrow grave just six by three they buried him there on the lone prairie" And that was the end. No investigation, no identification, no coroner's inquest. Slim had one sincere mourner. A barefoot boy would often stand by his shallow grave and wonder.
