AL TO JAL

charming, timid, self-controlled talker. At Mr. Embree's and my suggestion he is to
get together a Negro audience for me later in the week. That will be an exciting
and very revealing adventure.

Calendar:
Tonite   -- Dinner with the Crosses
Chapel service with Ellen
Sofa with Ellen

Tomorrow  -- Singing lessons with Evans
Museums
Letters
Saturday:  Singing to Negroes
Sunday:  Singing with Evans group

In the meantime there are as many visits to be made, as much talking to be done 
as I have strength and time.  The mail has not come.  Nothing. Hope our are strong 
and well.  If you need me, holler..  Alan
