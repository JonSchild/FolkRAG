he didn't want to make the ride to Anse-a-Veau 
with us. After considerable stalling he [lost] walked ahead 
through the dark to put us under the cave of the 
chef de section and it was from behind his broad back 
we saw the red roof of Anse A. Veau's cathedral 
looking out to sea. It shadows a little 
unlit where the French [be a] brought their caravels 
three centuries ago. The kind capt. of the gendarmes 
gave us the guard's truck for the ride into [Vi wagoane?] 
I didn't see the country in between, my head 
was leaping up and down on my guitar case 
and [I was] my mind was vaguely through 
shattered dreams trying to explain the bounding
leaping and moving of the camion. We picked 
up a ride in a freight truck to [Canyon?]
[Dejors?] where Moscosso was born and from
there to Port-au-Prince we rode a commercial
camion.  With visits to the chauffeur's
mistress, wife & friends by the way we made
PaP by 8 PM, making us 16 hours on 
the road without food and with little
sleep  Even R. was tired.  The first sip of
soup at the hotel was like ambrosia, the 
fourth was like vegetable soup.
