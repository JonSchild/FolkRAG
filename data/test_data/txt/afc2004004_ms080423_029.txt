other two.   Who you gonna listen to?  If you tried to listen to
all of them, you'd be an alcoholic again.  So, religion is in 
here, the way I look at it, it's right here.   And a man has got
to make up his own. . .he's got to figure out what's right and wrong
hisself.   That's the way I look at it.   I know right from wrong
like anybody else does.  It's the humans got a mind, they know
right from wrong.  I know it's wrong to get out here and still
and I know it's wrong to get out here and covet what somebody
else has got, you know. . . . .There's something just built inside
you that tells you when you're doing wrong, don't you agree
with that?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

AL:   How'd you get started with music?  Have you always been a 
musician?

Ray:   I've always loved music. . . . . . I've always picked music, but
I haven't always picked a 5 string banjo. . . . .I never could
afford one.   And another thing, way back then, the people sort
of condemned the banjo.   It was alright to pick a guitar, a piano,
but a banjo, you picked a banjo, you was held down, that's all
there was to it.  That's just the way they played.

AL:   Why did they think that?

Ray:   Well, they used banjos at corn shuckings, and people would
get pretty drunk, and they just got an idea that the banjo was
the devil's instrument.   But man, I love the sound of the banjo
since I can remember.
