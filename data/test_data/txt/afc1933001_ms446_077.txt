To join a league of angels in that morning ! 

See the stars begin to fall, 
And to hear the Savior call-- 
Arise ! and come to judgment in that morning ! 
Crying, O Lord ! how I want to go
To join the holy angels in that morning. 

See the moon turn to blood, 
And the saints a-praising God-- 
See the world all on fire, and the saints arising
higher, 
Crying, O Lord !  how I want to go
To join the holy angels in the morning ! 

See our parents, in that day,
Take wings and flay away-- 
Glad to hear the trumpet sounding in the morning, 
Crying, O Lord !  how I want to go
To join the holy angels in that morning ! 

See our children in that day,
Take wings and flay away-- 
Glad to hear the trumpet sounding in that morning, 
Crying, O Lord ! how I want to go
To join the holy angels in that morning ! 

See the earth melt away,
In that great and awful day-- 
And you'll hear the trumpet sound, in that morning
Crying O Lord !  how I want to go
To join a league of angels in that morning. 

See poor sinners, in that day,
Quite willing now to pray-- 
But alas!  it's too late in that morning,
Crying, O Lord !  how I want to go
To join all the righteous in that morning !
