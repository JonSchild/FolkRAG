decent months of the year , whiskey is so
strong that according to Boswell, one 
little noggin of it would keep a man
absolutely warm all day as he finished on teh 
frigid waters of the Mynch between Scotland
and the HEbrides.  The whosle background
was whiskey making and that is what kept 
everybody going.

Well in the mountains the Scotch/Irish and
other frontiersmen continue this tradition
and the Federal Government already in
Pennsylvania have interfered and there was
a war called th4e Whiskey Rebellion and 
George Washington had to step in and
adjudicate and a negotiated solution was
made with the Scotch/Irish men on the 
frontier who were ready to take on the 
newly established continental army , the
new Republic and so for a while the
moutaineers continued to prosper with
their stills.  [*/*] [There were stills with every
family , the the Federal Government tried 
prohibition and abolish whiskey making and 
so on and guerilla warfare really took
place that lasted until prohibition was
repealed, but the things that happened were
really gruesome.

In some counties, the county officials took
it very seriously and they went in with
guns and tried to tell them and to kill
whomever they found and the mountaineeres
were armed and they fought bakc in no
uncertain terms. [*\*]
