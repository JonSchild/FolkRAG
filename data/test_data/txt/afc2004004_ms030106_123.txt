1663 A (Cont.)

horse was small. I thought I should have a small horse, since
I was nothing but a kid--and the funny part of it, the horse
that I rented why, they didn't shear him and he had long hair
on and everybody's horse was slick and shiny, and the kids
that was around that was jealous of me was calling my horse
a goat and would take my horse up by the front knees and say,
"We can truck this horse on our back. You shouldn't be riding
the horse--don't let the horse ride--don't you ride on the 
horse-- you ride the horse." And of course I went along. I
got angry two or three times and I nearly beat the horse to
death because I wanted to show them that I had a good horse
and he could run fast. I'm telling you the truth--up until
the day, that is one of the things I feel most sorry for is
the way I beat that horse that day to try to make him prove
he was a good horse. Of course, I shouldn't have had such an
ambition to try to prove to the boys, but I did.
     Well, anyway, we went along and, of course, every member
in the organization that can afford, they always have at their
home, they have maybe a barrel of beer - never a half a barrel,
a real barrel. Of course, I mean the 1/2
barrel of today. They would have that and plenty sandwiches
and a lot of whiskey and gin and so forth. Well, everybody
in the neighborhoods of whichever these beers would be--oh,
we'll say Grand Salute--why, they would have women on top of
women- children and everybody and second lines just following
