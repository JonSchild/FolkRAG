beautiful melody produced a tranquility in the animal
which was conducive to a large milk yield.  In any
case the Highland dairymaid always had her milking-song, 
the words of which invariably praised the cow.
Here it is:
"Dearest cow, darling cow
Sweet little cow thou art mine
Though other cows might stray away
My little brown heifer would aye come home".

SONG  "bard a cluith"

When the cream was ready for churning, there was the
churning song to accompany the process.  The old-fashioned 
plunge churn with the froth-stick was the 
one in common use in the islands.  This is a churning
song:
"The churning which Mary had
on the floor of the Glen
To augment the butter
And decrease the milk
Come, butter, come
Buttermilk to the wrist
Butter to the elbow
Come, butter, come."

CHURNING SONG

And that's it.  Many of these songs were attributed
to the fairies.  The following one, which is a waulking
song, has this story:
A little girl was stolen by the fairies.  Years
afterwards her younger sister, one day herding cattle 
on the hillside, heard a voice coming from a knoll near
which she was sitting.  It was the voice of her sister,
and the knoll inside which she was singing was a fairy
hill, and this is the song she sang:
"O sisterling!  O little sister!
