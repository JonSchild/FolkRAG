lines at the Rouge plant and a lot of fellows think that certain Russian
workmen are responsible, though it's hard to trace. Most of those [*7b*]

Social Worker--"A girl on probation who reports to me and who
has a relative working at Timken-Detroit Axle said that two men ran toward
the switchboard at the plant recently in one department shouting 'We're pulling
the plant! ' She says a big Italian who always worked at a machine near
the switchboard intercepted the first man and knocked him halfway across [*7b*]
the room. the Italian then fled, as did the first man's partner. When

Italian and he had admitted striking the blow, the company gave him a 
raise of $10 a week." August 10.
