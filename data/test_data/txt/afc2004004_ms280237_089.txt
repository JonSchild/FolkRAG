4) So she dressed herself up all in her best,
And her pockets had been well lined with gold.
You should see her trudge the streets with a tear all in her eye,
She was searching for her jolly sailor bold.
5) So the first that she met was a pretty sailor bold,
"Have you seen my pretty ploughing boy?" she cried.
"He's just across the deep, and he's sailing for the fleet,
Andhe said, mypretty maid, will you ride?"
6) So she sailed till she came to the ship her love was in,
And unto the captain did complain,
She said, "I've come in search for my pretty plouging boy,
Who was sent unto the wars to be slain."
7) So five hundred bright guineas she then did lay down,
And so freely she told them all o'er,
Until she got her pretty plougboy all in her arms,
And she hugged him till she got him safe on shore.
She set those bells to ring, and so sweetly she did sing,
Just because she'd saved the lad that she adored.
PeterKennedy adds:
Happy is the day when all true levers meet
And their sorrows and their cares are all o'er,
But cursed are the wars that send many a lad to sea,
And their true loves never see them any more.
Cox: I have heard that.
Lomax: Harry, what war is it they're referring to in this song?
Cox: That's er. . . .I don't know what war. They used to press people
away years gone by, hundred o' years ago, I have been told.
Lomax: We don't have that, we never did have that in America; what
exactly was that anyway?
Cox: The pressgang. They used to have people what were well-off,
you see, they'd press you away. They'd come and take you. Like the back
streets in Dundee. The press-gang came to William, he was all alone.
He boldly fought for liberty and there was six to one. Blood did flow
in torrents. "Pray kill me now," says he. "I would rather die for Mary
on the Banks of sweet Dundee." They come an' they -- they'd come an'
take them away, force them away, rather than have 'em fall in love with
servant people. Press you away; they didn't care what become of you.
I don't know about what wars they were.
Lomax: I mean, whether you wanted to go or not, they'd take you ? You
wouldn't volunteer for the army or anything? They'd just take you
on anyway, huh?
