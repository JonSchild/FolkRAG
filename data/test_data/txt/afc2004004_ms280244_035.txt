14/IV

the captain passedfirst and he let bang. . .he thought it was the
captain and he shot his colonel. . .he shot the colonel dead. And
then the song starts you see

"Come all you soldiers, come listen to my song tell
It's here I live in Carrickslie jail
Its my                    no one can tell
I'se here I lie way in my condemned cell.

I was scarcely eighteen years of age
And to the army I did engage
I left my pantry with good content
To join the 47th regiment.

Two full whole pikes I there did grow
To serve your days in that depot
As I was placed on guard one day
When some children, children, come there to play.

From the officer's quarters my captain came
And ordered me to take their parents' name,
As I took one instead o' three,
For neglect of duty captain ham and charged me.

Into the guard room I did go,
Vowing vengeance with my heart overflo'
With a loaded rifle I did prepare
To shoot my captain on the barrack square.

I took my sim, it was deadly rare
When Captain Hammond passed the gor          square
I shot my colonel against my will
And that was how I was tried in Walthan jail.

Oh, I have no father to take my part
Nor yet a mother to break her heart
When the judge he did'n say, "McCapperty
Prepare yourself for the gallows tree.

Come all you soldiers, O come this way,
And raise your hats on McCafferty
And all you soldiers who pass this way
Say "The Lord have mercy on McCafferty."

(That's a beautiful song Jimmy. Who composed it anyway?)
