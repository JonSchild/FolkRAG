4. Shreveport, La., August 7, 1942.

The following rumor was reported to me, when in the course of a conference 
I asked a gentleman if he had heard any rumors of late. This is the statement 
or talk which is going around: "Hitler's agents are doing a good job of 
sabotaging the White House by stimulating actions of various Negro organizations 
to demand what they think is right and to obtain recognition. The CIO sent organizers
into the Shreveport area over one year ago to urge Negroes to get together 
in order to assert their rights. The indirect object being to play the Negro 
against the white. Behind this is some clever work on the part of the Nazi 
organization to stir up trouble among the southern white people. One northern 
worker told a Negro woman "If Hitler does win the war the Negroes will not be 
worse off than they are now."" [*79*]
