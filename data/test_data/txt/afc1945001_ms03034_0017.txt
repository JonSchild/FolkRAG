OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION 

July 15, 1942 

Mr. Robert H. Knapp 
Chairman, Division of Propaganda Research
Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety
18 Tremont Street,
Boston, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Knapp:

First let me acknowledge your July 13th
note to Mr. Keith Kane, enclosing rumors in Massachusetts
picked up from June 23rd to June 30th.

This is a very timely note from you since
we are beginning to plan work for a more detailed
analysis of the rumor question than we have ever undertaken
before, a project for which, in fact, we would
very much like to have your assistance.

Would it be possible for us to send a man
from our Division to see you in Boston and to spend
a day or two with you, absorbing all of the things
that you have done in connection with rumor detection
and analysis? If so, we would enormously appreciate it.

Sincerely yours,

Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division

P.S. I suggest that for further simplification and
acceleration of our communications you address letters
concerning activities of the Massachusetts Committee on
Public Safety directly to me, since our Division is responsible
for keeping in touch with such organizations
as yours.
