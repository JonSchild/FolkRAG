Question: Well, what about some more scat songs that you used to sing way back there?
Morton: Oh, I'll sing some scat songs. That was way before Louie Armstrong's time. By the way, scat is something that a lot of people don't understand and they begin to believe that the first scat number was ever done was done by one of my home town boys, Louie Armstrong, but I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian, and from that Tony Jackson and myself and several more grabbed it in New Orleans and found it was pretty good for an introduction of a song.
Question: What does "scat" mean?
Morton: "Scat" doesn't mean anything, but just something to give a song a flavor. For an instance, we'll say: (Piano)
Skat, skeet, skeet, too-doodle-oo,
Skeet, skull, skoot, too-doodle-oo, etc.
