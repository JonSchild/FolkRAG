Dear Allen,
Was surprised and pleased to get
your letter and contract. I am returning
it and we have agreed to claim
the arrangements of the numbers
you have as a group. I think
it would be less trouble for
all concerned. I have a written
agreement from the group so
every thing is O.K. Go ahead
and I hope you make us all
a million. Let us know what
is going on as you go along.

All the musicians are interested
in you and ask if I've heard
from you every time I see them.
The best of luck to you and
Shirley. Hope to see you soon.

All the boys said tell you hello.

Sincerely,
James Lindsey
