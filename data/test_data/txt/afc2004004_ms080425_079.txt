MRS:
We like antiques. Antiques fit our house. that's what
started us on it.

MR:
You can take a look at the wall and see some of the
items we picked up through the years.
(Technical. . .)

MR:
These are some items (?), this is a gourd, that you
drink water from a spring with here; this is a used
horseshoe; this is a cowbell where you could tell where
the cow was in the pasture; this is a framin' square,
a small tri-square; this is part of a gear, that's the
doorknob, this is gear that worked on steers, oxen,
this would be the hangs (?) that worked with 'em;
this is a lantern, the type of light we had when I was
growin' up; this right here is a yoke. . . .
The pastures back in those days wasn't very good, they
didn't soak (??) pasture, so they would put a yoke on
to keep 'em from gettin' out of the wire fence. It had
a hook on each end, and it would hook the wire, and they
couldn't get through it; this right here is a shovel to
get ashes out of the fireplace, . . . I always heard this
called a 'railroad liner (?)'. Other people used them,
but they were the type used on the railroads. This is
a strainer, to keep a cow on the farm, that's what you
strain 'em up with. This is the way we drew water from
the well, old picker (??). When automobiles started, they
didn't have air compressors. This is part of an old hand
pump . . . I've pumped up many a tire with one of those
things.
