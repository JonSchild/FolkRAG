Anything you like. I had all socks, everything knitted, all
done; no trouble at all. No, there was three of my family. One
boy, three girls. One layin' in                       churchyard an'
one in                      (pause)
Lomax: So you have a daughter and a son living, is
that it?
Cox: Eh?
Lomax: You have a daughter and a son living?
Cox: No, he died. The boy died; that's the one I wanted to live.
I should ha' learnt him everything I knew. The boy died; that's
what I wanted, a boy. I should ha' learnt him all I knew. - if
he'd a lived. I'd a given him all my knowledge, so he could have
kept everything, and gone on. There ain't nobody to take my
place now. Our family's dyin' out. My sisters, they've see. . .
there's nobody got. . .they're all gone now, like that. The Coxes;
there ain't no more Coxes. I got hold of my brother's boy,
what'll keep the family up when he get married, if he do get
married. That's the only hope - that's the last one of the
family, the lot. Our family's out then, if he don't have no
boys. Coxes'll have ran out. The whole race. (pause) That's
how the families die out. I mean there's - daughters, you see,
they don't count, they change their name. They get different
names, they never. . .So we are gone then.
Lomax: You feel that keeping the family name is important?
Cox: I do. That's what I like to see. I'd like to see some on
'em, you know, still keep joggin' along. These here - the old
race have been goin' now for a good many year. Several year. Our
class o' Coxes. Then they are gradually dyin' out. (pause)
