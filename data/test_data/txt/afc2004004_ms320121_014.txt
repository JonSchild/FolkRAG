They had to sing their own-- they'd beg for chicken to make a 
gumbo for them at night.  Then they had a dance at night.

About the second day, a lot of men drop out already, but the
third day they had a few left and they was so hoarse they
couldn't hardly make the people understand wanted.   So then
they got together and they decided they was gonna quit. 
They quit and they had a meeting and decided they was gonna
run just one day out of the year, you know.  Run Mardi Gras
just one day.   So they been running since then.   And I been
running Mardi Gras since I was six years old.   They had
little Mardi Gras and big Mardi Gras, they called, the kids
you know.   We'd walk.   Old man, taking us with a flag, you
know.   We'd go from house to house, beg for chicken and 
they'd make us some donuts and kind of things.  And when I
was twelve years old, and I had my own horse then, so I'd
run with the kids and then I'd run with the big Mardi Gras
with the men also.   And I done that until the war, World War
II.   Then I started driving a bus and I had to let out on
the Mardi Gras there a bit.   But I was always involved in
all the Mard Gras'.   Like the gumbo, I got all the pots
right there, the burners, and everything.

What is the tune that you're--what are the words to the
song?

          FOUGET
Oh, they got all kinds, you make up your own words.  I can't
sing it.

          A. LOMAX
Mumble it.

          FRUGE
