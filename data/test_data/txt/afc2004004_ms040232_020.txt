Apart from this there are, of course, a number of
individual items which we have already got and there may
be some which are of considerably less value than others, 
but unless you were able to do any more specific sorting
with Mr. Lomax on the spot, I propose that for the first
stage we should dub the rest as they stand.
I am writing this memo in case I fail to get you on
the telephone this afternoon. When I asked hopefully for
your assistance the other day I certainly had no idea of the
amount of material involved. I am sure you will agree with
us that it is quite impossible to deal straight away with all
this in the detail which it deserves.
