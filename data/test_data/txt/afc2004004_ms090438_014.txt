 (1)
We are sometimes tossed and driven
Wandering from land to land;
And when my days are ended I will join the angel band.
I will lay my burden down and get my starry crown,
All my troubles will be over after while. 
              [2]               CHORUS
All [my] our troubles will be over after while, after while,
All [my] our troubles will be over after while.
When our work on earth is done and this mortal race
                  is run, 
All our troubles will be over after while. 
 (2)
God has taken my dear father, my darling mother too, 
He has taken my brother and my sister,
I know He will take me too. 
Now death is only a dream to those who have been redeemed
All our troubles will be over after while. 
(3)
 We must bear each other's burden and feel each other's care
 We must take our troubles to Jesus, I know He is able to cheer,
 We will be happy when we meet our love ones at my Jesus'
          feet.
 All our troubles will be over after while.
