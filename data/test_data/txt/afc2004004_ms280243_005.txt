walk down, and I met this girl on Princes Street. Then we'd
get chatting, and Big Tom, he was older than me, but a nice-looking
man, well over six feet. Course, me being young the
girls took a fancy to me. I was always laughing and joking.
So we went away to a restaurant and had a cup of tea, and 
we went to a picture hall - course, they were cheaper at that
time, the picture halls, and I went with that girl for about -----
I sent her letters to Musselborough for about six months. But
she shifted away after that and I couldn't get her address.
And it ended then.
Lomax: Did you actually make love to her ?
Davy: In a sort of way! But never really did put my mind to it.
To be in love with any girl then -- just friends. I was
frightened to say anything out of place in case I got a 
telling off. I could stick away and tella story and laughing ---
but for trying to make love, I had no hand in that, at all.
Lomax: How young were you when you first went to a woman in
a real way ?
Davy: About 16.
Lomax: Was that a professional or just one of the girl s in. . . .
Davy: No, just a girl in Aberdeen. But this girl, she used to 
put her hands round my neck, and in the picture hall she'd
always come and sit aside me. But I wouldn't have much to do
with her at all. But I was always frightened of saying something
out of place. So I used to keep my mouth shut, and 
she got fed up and went away. Three or four times. The girl
got fed up, I suppose, me not proposing or anything to her.
I've a very bad hand at that. I can't do much proposing to
a  girl. I wouldn't know the first thing to say.
Lomax: But she finally went to bed with you, did she ?
Davy: Well, no -- no. No. We'd make fun and have a bit of
wrestling about, but that's as far as -- that's all.
Lomax: When's the first time you ever went all the way with
a girl ? How old were you ?
Davy: Well I'd be about fourteen. Course, it was a very warm
summer's day, and I was sitting at the water-side, and this
girl was playing about - she'd be a girl of 16 or thereabouts,
same age as myself. And I spoke to her and she sat down beside
me. Begod ! I didn't know where I was till she put her two
hands round me - started kissing me. And then I got a very
queer feeling. Course then I -- she didn't object at all !
Begod ! I was twice with the girl; and afterwards I though to
myself, - did I do wrong ? But I promised to see the girl
again, but I never saw her no more.
