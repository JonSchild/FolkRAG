Subject: War Rumors

In compliance with instructions received from Mr. Fred M. Wilcox,
Regional Director, Federal Security Agency, Minneapolis Minnesota,
I herewith submit war rumors which I have heard during the week of
August 9-15. The rumors I heard during the week 2-8 were submitted to
your office on August 8, before we received instructions to continue
the study for an additional week. 

Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 10. --Miss A told me about all the
time which was being wasted in army camps. Her brother and his buddy [*1*]
had told her that all the work they had accomplished during the last
year (in the army) could have been done in two weeks of concentrated efforts.

St. Paul, Minnesota, August 10. --Mr. B. told me he knew of several
unmarried young men holding administrative positions in the Regional NYA
who had been granted occupational deferment from the draft. He added [*1*]
that this was causing considerable gossip among those who were in a 
position to know of this situation.

Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 11. --Mr. C has heard that the
number of casualties in the Solomon Islands battles is likely to be [*3*]
staggeringly high, but that as usual this information will not be made
public for sometime.

Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 13, --Mr. D said the steel shortage
is not actual but is due to the fact that small quantities of steel can
be sold by dealers at above ceiling prices, and this has lead to an
accumulation of large stock piles. He blamed this situation on the
dollar-a-year men in Washington, and said that if they were all "shot
at sunrise" it would be much better for our war effort.
