For this game, the children stand in one long line. After the 
first two spoken lines, the children weave in and out under the 
arms of the others in the line until their positions are reversed.
This is Threading the Needle. After the second pair of spoken
lines, the children "wind it up," "shake it down," and finally
"unwind it." For further reference, see tape dated October 12
and yet another tape containing the same song in greater detail.
