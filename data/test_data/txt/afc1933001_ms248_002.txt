Dear Father:

It seems to me that you could add a per diem voucher to the
mileage vouchers you have already sent in.  Jerry is holding those
until this voucher is received.  I would still like to have a
detailed statement about your planned trip into west Texas, although
it seems to me it would be better to wait until it gets a little
warmer before you start.  In the matter of priorities on tires, we
can write you a bang-up letter when you go to the local board with
your request.  In the meantime, I am sure you could dig up valuable
stuff in and around Dallas, although it's always harder to hunt on
your own home grounds, I know.

Captain Thompson called up, and I told him that you had gone
back to Texas.  We agreed to meet later on, however.

Yours,
Alan
