THAT OLD FEELING = Hungry

    That Old Feeling ... I had it all my born days. So have
you, dont try to say you haven't.

   And what is that Old Feeling?

    Tha Old Feeling is this ---- the feeling of Union -- the
feeling of 'getting together' --- the feeling of 'all becoming 
as one' -- like the bible says.

    [*Change all this*]   Shake hands, farmers and working folks, shake hands, and
go entirely by that ' Old Feeling' you've always had. It's
the rich against the poor in this old world, and Jesus tells
us the 'poor will inherit the earth --- after a terrible battle,
with the forces of dark and greed on one side, and the forces 
of Light and Love on the other -------

    I've a feeling He was right. It's an 'Old Feeling with me'. 
Don't start to say it aint, 'cause you know you --- you've always
felt, and known the same dam thing ..... so have I.

    After losing her family to the coal miners death, Sara Ogan
knows that that ' Old Feeling' is the biggest thing in her life.
She'd live for it, fight for it, die for it.

    So would I.   So would you.
