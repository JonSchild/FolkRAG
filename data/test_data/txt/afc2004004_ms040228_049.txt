The Green mossy banks of the Lea - 2.
So its all pretty maidens attention.
No matter how poor you may be,
There is many a poor girl as handsome
As those with a large property.
By flattery let no one deceive you,
Who knows but your fortune may be,
Like that young gentle Matilda,
On the green mossy Banks of the Lea.
