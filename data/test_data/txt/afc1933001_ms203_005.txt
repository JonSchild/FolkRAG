Dear Harold,   (over)
My address for the present
is 46 W. 96th St., Apt. 3-W.
Elizabeth and I are very comfortable
there but we will undoubtedly
move once more before we finally
settle down. Under seperate [cover?]
I'm mailing [Nina?] Rogers some
letters for typing. You might
take a look at some of them
so they won't have to be done over
twice. We had a Hell of a trip up here
in the fog with plenty of car trouble.
[Both] I am a little groggy from the
experience, especially after such a crush
of work the last two weeks I spent in
Washington. Yours, Alan
