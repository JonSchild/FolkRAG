Well a man once told me that whenever he heard
Barbara Allen when he was a young man, it
made the hars stand right up on my head and 
goose pimples come all over me.  Ah, he - ah
Samuel Pepys - is it Samuel Peeps? [Peeps]
Samuel Pepys ah made the same kind of remark
and so did ah Oliver Goldschmit.  It's
impressed everybody, this song.  Ah, it's
impressed men across time.  It's certainly the
most impor - ah, most popular of all American
folk ballads.  It's a story of a, - it's a
rather mysterious story, sweet Willy is ah
lying in bed thinking he's going to die.  He
calls his, his enamorata Barbara to come
to him, and ah, save him.  And she's very 
scornful when she gets there, and, and
rejects him, saying that ah, when you were in
tavern, you courted all - toasted all the
ladies fair and slighted Barbara Allen.
