Tape:  Roll 49 Stanley and Ed   3
(Ed)  the other side will run it the other way. . . .no, they can't
figure it out.  I had a sitologist (Psychologist?) asked for it
back a few years ago, he said he was prescribing it for some of
his patients, I don't know what good it would do!  I was sittin'
there, playin' with it and he said "I prescribe them for some of
my patients."
AL:  You have to be relaxed, though, to do it, don't you?
Ed:  Yeah you gotta be relaxed, that was what was wrong with that man
in Hickory.  He got to his motel room, got relaxed in the room for
it, he got back in front of us, he just stand stiff -- it was dead
as it could be.  Now, I picked the things up a lot of times couldnt
run 'em myself.  They make 'em smaller, that's just an oversized
one there. . .you can take a smaller one, and it'll. . .

Roll 49 -- Stanley in the woods            (technical)
Stan:  I started huntin' things in the woods like this, you know, and 
I make whistles and I make about everything.  And you could make a 
whistle out of this, and if there are any crows around, they'll
really come in.  Now some pines, they all don't work out good.
But I'll try to make one here, and see if we're gonna get some
crows in.  They all don't come in now when you want 'em to, but you
can get em in, if they been around very close.  And you have to
know pretty well what you're doin' to get this stuff, you know.
Sometimes it don't work out real good.  You get the stick somethin'
'bout that long, and you shoe(?) him down like that, there you go. . .
and you got to get this that(?).  And then it's split open. . .
sometimes you'll grain(?) your finger, but you got to be awful
careful.  When you do this, you can't just do it real quick.
