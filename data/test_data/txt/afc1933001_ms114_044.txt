Dearest Father and Deanie,

First before I forget it, Shirley and I saw in a
Neiman Marcus advertisement about some dress and coat ensembles
reduced from $69.95 to $25.00. Since I don't have
and need some sort of a spring coat, this seemed to us a
good chance to get a good dress and coat for the price of
one. We wondered if Deanie could go down and look the situation
over in size 18; it's in the Women's Shop and ask for
Miss Lemmon who knows what I look like. She's the one who
sold me that black and white suit Christmas. This is all
if the finances are OK, but I do need something of this
sort badly, especially a long Srping coat.

School goes well; Mrs. DIngus is tough but efficient.
So far I've made As on everything, but we have an
hour quiz tomorrow, and I don't know what then. I'm doing
extra reading for vocabulary on the outside, and I think
I'll know enough by the end of this six weeks to be able
to go on by myself.

Shirley and I took Patsy to a terrible movie last
night; don't waste your money on it if you're tempted. It
is called "Florian"; the story's by Felix Satlen and it's
about these Rizzian (?) horses that we saw in Vienna, so
I thought it would be fun; but it certainly was the feeblest
excuse for entertainment I ever saw. Patsy enjoyed the
horses though, I think; and they were lovely.

Fanny left us by request day before yesterday,
and we're trying out a new girl now-- Elnora by name. She
