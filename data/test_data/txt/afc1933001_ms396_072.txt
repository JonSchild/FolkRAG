The Old Chisholm Trail

which part of the trail ran.

No one person composed all of the thousand or more stanzas
of "The Old Chisholm Trail,". I think at least one hundred persons
have contributed to my collection. No one knows who sang the first
stanza or where the unknown got the tune. In fact, there are several
tunes. A book dealer in Washington Square, New York City, is making a
collection. Usually the song goes in time to the rapid beat of a pony's
hoofs as he chases a steer back into the herd.

Another tune fits the loneliness and quiet of the big, open
plains over which lie sleeping a large herd of cattle, while around it
ride two sentinel cowboys, singing softly "The Old Chisholm Trail."
They sing a cattle lullaby to keep them quiet.

If all the stanzas of "The Old Chisholm Trail" were brought together,
the reader would have spread before him various trail customs
and incidents that might grow out of the experiences of a bunch of cowboys
going from Texas to Montana. For example:

It's cloudy in the west and a-lookin' like rain
An' my damned old slicker's in the wagon again.

This is the story back of these two lines: Each morning, the cook
was out of bed first. He boiled the coffee, fried the sowbelly, baked
the biscuits and then yelled to the cowboys, sleeping rolled up in their
blankets around the chuck wagon: "Come an' git it!"

As soon as breakfast was done, the cook harnessed his team and
drove ahead of the trailing herd. Before he left the camp, the boss of
the outfit had told him where to stop, make camp, and have the noon meal
