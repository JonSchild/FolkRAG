A    War Estimations 

I have often heard of the estimations
of people on how long the war will last 
Some say five years, others seven and still
others ten or more.  Now some people can
not afford to estimate on how short or
how long this war will be unless every
one of them are in there pitching ready to
do their part, in making it short, and 
I think they are. 

A Rhymn 

Will slap that Jap
With rubber scrap, and fat, 
And he'll wish he'd got those buck- teeth in 
And wiped his face of that ugly grin.
