Draft cover letter to be adapted according to previous correspondence. (Addressed to college president with a copy to psychologist or sociologist heading Clinic.)

Dear ..................

This office is now ready to proceed with the organization of the Rumor Clinics in the field. The Office of Facts and Figures and the Office of the Coordinator of Information are [ready to assist] participating jointly with the Office of Education in this program.

It should be stressed that the Rumor Clinics, of which there will only be about 25 in the beginning, will serve in two capacities. First, they will serve as field offices for collecting and reporting rumors on a sampling basis. Second, they will function as demonstration centers in program development for public education on rumor analysis and psychological warfare.

More detailed description of the Clinics is given in the attached material. Additional suggestions will be forwarded to the heads of the Clinics when they have been officially designated.

An orientation course as provided in a forthcoming syllabus will constitute a prerequisite for participation in Rumor Clinic work. Only after the President of a University has certified that 25 students and faculty members have completed the orientation course and passed an  examination, will the Office of Education designate the local group as an official Rumor Clinic.

Please let this Office know whether or not the university wished to develop a Rumor Clinic along the lines suggestion. On the receipt of this information a supply of materials will be sent for the use of the members of the group in the orientation course.

Cordially,

Chester S. Williams
Assistant to the Commissioner of Education
