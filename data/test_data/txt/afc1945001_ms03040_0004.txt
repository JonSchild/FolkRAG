From Margery C. Quigley, Montclair, New Jersey
Heard in Montclair, New Jersey, August 10, 1942
Subject: EMBARKATION OF SOLDIERS

"Soldiers are often topped off over the week end that a
few men from their division will be sent over-seas. Permits and
even encouragement are given to certain men to take week end leave
and thus avoid being sent over-seas."
