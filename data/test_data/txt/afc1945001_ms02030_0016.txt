SECOND PORTION OF REPORT ON RUMORS

Each rumor included in this report was heard in Louisville, 
Kentucky. As a check on the rumors reported last week, eleven of 
the same people were contacted this week. Eight of these contacts 
had either lost their fears about Russia and England or were so absorbed 
with the fighting near Australia that they expressed no 
rumors as in the previous week. Discussions have turned from 
England and Russia and second front commanders to India, the 
Solomon Islands, and general features of the war effort.

trust England because promises were not kept after the last war". 

8-13-42 Louisville, Ky. A barber said, "America will be forced 
to help control India to keep supplies moving to China"

8-13-42 Louisville, Ky. A manufacturer said, "Gandhi is like
