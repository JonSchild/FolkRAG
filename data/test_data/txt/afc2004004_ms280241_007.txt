Never Wed an Old Man:
1) For an old man come courting me,
Hi-doo-a-darritty,
For an old man come courting me,
Hi-doo-a-dee.
For an old man come courting me,
Hi-doo-a-darritty,
But maids, when you're young, never wed an old man

2) For when we went to the church I left him in the lurch,
When we went to the church, me being young.
When we went to the church I left him in the lurvh,
Maids, when you're young never wed an old man.

3) But when we got to our tea he starts a teasing me, . . . . .

4) When we got to our bed, he lay as he was dead. . . .

Lomax: Where did you get that, Jeannie?
Jean: Oh, I heard it away about thirty years ago. Heard a young
man singing it - but he'd several verses of it.
Lomax: And everybody laughs?
Jean: O, everybody liked it. It got bluer as it went on. . . . . .

The Boy I Left Behind:
1) For the moon shined on my bed last night,
No rest I could not find.
For thinking of the bonny boy,
The boy I left behind.
If ye were here that I love dear,
I'd go to my bed and sleep,
But instead of sleep, all night I weep,
And there's many a tear I shed.

2) Young men so full of jealousy,
Young girls so frank and free.
But if it was my will, I would be still in my love's company,
If he were here that I love dear, I'd go to my bed and sleep,
But instead of sleep, all night I weep, and there's many a tear I shed.

3) For an old man came a-courting me, and he asked me to be his bride,
My parents they advised me to give up my own true love.
He had a little money - it was all they did endure,
But I'm bound to live in poverty and wed the lad I adore.
