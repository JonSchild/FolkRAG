"EACH FOR ALL AND ALL FOR EACH"
Tune: Auld Lang Syne.

"Each for all and all for each
Is a way of life worth while,
It gives to all the joys of life
And gives them with a smile. 
To every man his brother gives
The right to live his best;
To love and help his fellow man
As he would help himself.

Yes, every man has in his mind
The desire for the day to come,
When security is enjoyed by all,
And all, their freedom won.
Then, "Each for all and all for each"
Through service will create
An economic brotherhood,
When all cooperate.

A NEW WAY
Two verses, two tunes, sing each seperately
Then divide singers into two sections and
sing together to first accompaniment.

Tune: Long, Long Trail.

There's a New Way of life a building 
In the land of happy dreams,
Where every consumer is singing
And Co-operatives gleam.
It's a New Way of life most pleasing
Where in the Golden Rule
Is made the way of living
For the good of me and you.

Tune: Keep the Home Fires Burning.

Keep the good work growing
With that idea inspiring,
That cooperation is the way
For man to build.
Build a grand new order
Where every man is brother,
With abundance, enough for all,
In this co-operative Way.
