Reverend Roe.  Reel 8.  P. 5
[* There's bad influence.*]
stay away from it (laughter).  You see, we learned a lot of bad things 
[while] by looking at things.  When you begin to watch a thing, some of that get 
in you.  Pastoring a church I've always had peace and harmony generally.  
Some friction, of course, comes up in a church, but yet I've always 
used God's words to settle the differences.
A:  What friction?  Give me an example of what you mean by that.
R:  Oh well, there is someone that will oppose the things the pastor 
wants to do.  They don't see no need of it.  And they begin to talk it 
around amongst the members, and they get others to see like they see, 
you know, and bring about trouble.
A:  Can you remember an incident of that kind?
[*Friction in the church*]
R:  I remember right here.  When we began here, of course, the church 
was very small, and we had to use fuel here - we didn't have gas - we had 
to use fuel.  And when we began, we wasn't able to prepare a place to 
keep it, and I used one of the little rooms back there to put our fuel in.  
Well, as the church began to grow, I said we needed a house out there 
for the fuel.  And they said we didn't need it.  They said, "No, we didn't 
need it.  That place was good enough."  But we had, you know, a little 
[preaching over when] friction on it but I had the house built.
A:  Did the other person get mad and leave the church?
R:  No, no, he's here now.  That's one in there, one of them (laughter).  
And I had the house built and the stuff put in, and it pleased every-
body so well after it was done until he [ordered] wanted some[one to] of the praise 
for it [(dead?)] doing it. (laughter)
There are so many things, you know.  Some men just wants to rule, 
wants everybody to sit down, as the head of everything, you know.
A:  But the preacher has got to be the --
R:  Has got to be the head.  Yes sir, he [has] have to be or there'll be no 
success.  A layman can't lead a church.  You've never seed one do it.
