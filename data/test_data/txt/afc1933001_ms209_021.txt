We are 22 1/2 miles from 
a railroad, surrounded by 6000
feet snow-clad mountains with 
many streams pouring down 
their sides.  The hotel stands 
on a point made by two 
torrents which [drown] drop down 
1000 feet into the valley
below.  A month of this quiet 
and peace would bring 
me back to life.  Johnny
climbs mountains and 
dives into ice cold waterfalls.
On July 2 we sail from Bergen, 
Norway, for Newcastle, England.
Lovingly, Father.
