Mr John A. Lomax
Curator of Folk-Songs,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

    The New York Times of August 20,
carries an article about Negro folk songs, in which
it is stated that you have made a tour of the South
and recorded these songs for the Library of Congress.

    I am wondering if your work has
been published and is it available to the public. Would
you be good enough to advise me where I might secure a
copy of this work. If it is only available through the
Library of Congress, I could of course obtain a copy
there.

    Thanking you for any information you
can give me, I am,
    Very truly yours,

Miss Genevieve S. Burk
