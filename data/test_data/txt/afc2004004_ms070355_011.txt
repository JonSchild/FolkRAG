Fisk 24 .[?] 3             Levee Holler - Wm Henderson

TP running,  [?] smoke stacks drag the ground
The gal I'm loving, boys, she can't be found.

I told my boss man I can't make it to that old drag line
My right mules crippled and my left one's blind

O--------, my boss [ask] ax me how come I leave?
Tell him I got tired of his old rice & black eyed peas.

O--------, this old donkey won't drink water, won't eat no corn
Gonna, knock him in the collar till he goes stone blind

O--------, fare you well, partner, I ain't got no more to say,
but if you get down yonder under Captain C. gonna throw that
                           lever 3 or 4 times a day

Um-----, just a few mornings to get up so---- on,
You long time here, pardner, you can have my room.

O-----, I wish somebody standing in the window to hear po'
                                                     Billy groan,
