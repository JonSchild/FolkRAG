mother, too.  I mean they done the very best they could with
us.  And I've got more respect for them I guess than any man
should have for his mother and father on account of that.

was good.  I believe a person is a better person when
they're raised, when they know what heartaches and ways and 
things are about.
     I love to hunt, fish.  I ain't worth nothing
but hunt and fish, ballgames and make music.  That's my,
that's my life desire right there.

Music, I tell you what, I believe with all my
heart that a person who loves music, he's a better person
than one that don't.  Because music gets in, it gets into my
blood.  It goes into me just, just all.  And I get the
biggest thrill out, a smile on a face when I'm trying to
entertain anybody or singing to them, money can't buy.  They
say when you die, leave this world say you don't take
nothing with you.  But they are so wrong there.  They,
that's the worst mistake yet.  I told them, I said when you
dig my little hole right there, I said add three foot to it.
I said good memories, it'll take that much to hold my
memories.  And I said I'm taking my memories with me.
