"We are losing as many ships from out convoys as the Germans claim.  I was on two ships that were sunk and know of several convoys where over half the ships went down.  The Navy ought to tell the people because Germany already knows the facts."

Government Sources:  This is a complicated rumor involving shipping questions and information policy.  Factors which may contribute to this criticism of information policy: (1) The Navy announces shipping losses individually, and does not release periodical statements of total losses.  The Axis issues reports of numbers of ships lost and the amount of tonnage involved.  (2) Announcements of losses are frequently held up several weeks.  (3) It is not always clear in general references to our shipping losses whether the United Nations losses are also included.
There have been official statement comparing the general progress of shipbuilding with shipping losses.  For example, a War Shipping Administration release of July 21 declared:  "Shipping losses during the week of July 21st reached their highest level since the beginning of the war. While construction in American shipyards is breaking all records, sinking of United Nations' ships through enemy action and marine casualties have greatly exceeded new construction."
Information policies which have been publicly announced follow these lines:  (1) Facts will be given when information has been definitely and officially confirmed, and will be released at a time that will not prove valuable to the enemy (President Roosevelt, Dec. 9);  (2)  Bad news must be held until it does not affect military operations (Pres. Roosevelt, Press Conference, May 22);  (3)  Navy will not announce names and types of merchant ships suck by Axis (Knox, March 11);  (4)  News of sinking will be released as soon as possible but sometimes it must be withheld weeks in order to permit other ships in some areas and on similar mission to return home (Admiral Hepburn, April 16).
