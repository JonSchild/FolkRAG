[*CORNWALL
(DOODLES)*]

A I didn't know until - when I went to England 
that ah, ah - I didn't know until I went to 
Great Britain to live awhile, that um the 
southern part of Britain was not touched with 
this ah melancholy Puritanism that I'd grown 
up with in this country. There was lots going 
for you everywhere in the bars [ ?] and you 
could really have a good time and nobody 
actually disapproved. In fact they were very 
encouraging, even when you were a stranger. 
I found this particularly true in Cornwall. 
This is old old Celtic country and I went 
there to the ah hobby horse dance and found a, 
a real pagan ceremony continuing from long 
before Christian times. And ah, all sorts of 
wonderful, all sorts of wonderful pagan 
[ONE] . And the Cornish of course sing 
in harmony, and they're ab - able to laugh 
and ah in a very lusty and ah free way that 
- difficult for an awful lot of, of these 
uptight north west Europeans. They kept the 
joie de vivre from, from the Arthurian past 
somehow going there.

[*DOODLES*]
And, and as soon as I met ah, ah, and heard 
Doodles for the first time at a festival, 
I walked up to him and said: You're from 
Cornwall.
