Sae the Hollander warlock, he was there,
He had the second sicht,
He said " Gin ye seek in the hauntit kirk
Ye'll find the Stane a' richt."
Fowr and twenty sextons
Wi fowr and twenty shools,
They werena owre anxious
To be shiftan Grannie's mools.
Brass-handles, coffin-lids and urns,
Were scattered aa about,
The deid sat up, they thocht it was
The resurrection toot.
There was howkin in the cloisters,
Howkin in the crypt,
They coudna see the Stane for aa
The bogles around them skipt.
They dug and delved the yerdin-grund,
And plouter't amang the banes,
And sure enuff it was nae bluff-
They fand a feck o stanes!
And ilka " humourless " Scot i the land
Lauchs loud in ilka town, 
And bides the time whan the Stane comes hame
Til its richtfu seat at Scone.
My skeelie Scots that did this deed,
Ye've mirrilie earned your fame!
Sae gie's your haund and raise a gless
Til the Reivers o the Stane !
Tak aff your dram til the bestest ploy
This monie and monie a year-
While geordie's " maist distresst," and the
Dean
Owre the yerth seeks faur and near.
This is the blythest Hogmanay
That Guidsir eer did see,
Sae let the glasses birl around 
For the sake o Scotland Free!
For it's fa took it this time?
And fa's got it nou?
The yane that took it las time
Canna find it nou!
