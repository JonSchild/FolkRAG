County, and she's spent most of her life here now.

AL:
Then this is your old family place here.

MR:
My father built this house in about 1921, and there
were 14 in the family: 9 boys and 5 girls -- the family
I grew up in. The table was about 9 foot long, and I
knew where my place was, it was on the bench, second
from the end. There wasn't any argument at the table --
when you sat down at the table, you sat down to eat!
If we got out of line, our father corrected that right
quick!

AL:
What happened if you stayed out of line?

MR:
He knew how to handle that, right quick. He had a hand
and he had a belt, and his hickory switches grew all
around this place. (MRS laughs) From then on, just a
good hard look controled that part of it. I've often
wondered how he made a livin' in those depression years
with that large a family, but we lived well through the
years. I was about middle of the family, so I shared
some of the ordeals of the family with all of the family.
The older ones were getting married when I was growing
up and some of the younger ones coming along.
My father enjoyed Sacred Harp very much. He was taught. . . 
his daddy out under his shade tree. . . a singin' song. . . 
he never got to attend any singin' school, but he was
a great singer and he had a real strong voice.

AL:
And he left you with a fine place here.

MR:
Yessir. We have done some remodeling since we been here.
We enjoy. . . because we like country life.
