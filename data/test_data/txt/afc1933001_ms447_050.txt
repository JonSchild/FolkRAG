IF I GOT MY TICKET, CAN I RIDE?

Chorus:
Lawd, if I got my ticket, can I ride?
Lawd, if I got my ticket, can I ride?
Lawd, if I got my ticket, can I ride?
Ride away to the heaven that mornin'.

1  Tell you one thing, it certainly is sho',               27
The judgment's comin' an' I don't know;
Want to be ready when I'm called to go,
If anything lackin', Lawd, let me know. (Chorus.)

2  Hear a great talk of the Judgment Day,
Got no time to projick away:
Away by and by, without a doubt,
Jehovah will order his angels out,
Clean out the world and leave no sin.*
*The fifth and sixth lines are sung to the same air as the preceding two in each case.
"Tell me, please, where have you been?"  (Chorus.)

3  Hear big talk of the gospel train,
"You want to get on it?"  "Yes, that's my aim."
Stand at the station and patiently wait,
The train is coming and it's never late.
So long coming that it worried my mind,*
*The fifth and sixth lines are sung to the same air as the preceding two in each case.
Thought it wa'n't coming, but was just one time. (Chorus.)

An ex-slave, an old Negro [An old Negro slave] woman, talked to us of her life and her songs:

"I been drug about and put through the shackles, till I done forgot
some my children's names. My husband died and left me with nine children,
and none of 'em could pull the others out of the fire iffen they fell in.
I had mo'n that, but some come here dead and some didn't. Dey ain't a
graveyard in this here settlement where I ain't got children buried, and I
got children dead in Birmingham and Bessemer.
"I mos' blind now and I can't hear good and I ain't never read no verse
in no Bible in my life, 'cause I can't read. I sets 'cross the road here from
the church and can't go 'cause I'm cripple and blin', but I hear 'em singin'."
