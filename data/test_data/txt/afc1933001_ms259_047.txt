Announcement

Group Hospitalization, Incorporated, was
organized in 1933 for the sole purpose of
serving the people of Washington.
Without cost to the subscriber, the time,
ability, experience and judgment of outstanding
citizens have been devoted to the
development and administration of this civic
non-profit organization.
Serving without pay, these citizens have
assumed the responsibility of giving to Washington,
in Group Hospitalization, Incorporated,
and institution of serviceâ€”sound in its
principles, honest in its dealings, fair in its
practices, efficient and economical in its
administration, and unquestioned in its stability.
Because it promotes the perpetuation of
these ideals of service to the community, it is
a sincere pleasure for the Board of Trustees
to announce that the activities of Group Hospitalization,
Incorporated, are now being carried
on under a charter from the Congress of
the United States.
