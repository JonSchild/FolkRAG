muck out there.  Lil' ol' houses, lil' ol' shacks built out, you

The water jus' was -- See, the water was risin' and fallin'.  Ya

swimmin' an' dey could, an' far as dey could, ah, hear they
husbands, you know, callin' 'em, an' hollerin' to let 'em know

Well, snakes an' everything an' eels an' everything else was 
tryin' ta run for they lives.  They was wroppin' all around they
laigs?  An' anywhere they could wrop.  They wa' grabbin' anything
they could grab.
     An' so, an' Monica said that they lost the voice of their
husban', ya know, but yet they swam, alone.  An' they didn' know
where one another was.  Just lost the voice of everybody, ya
know.  Everybody was t'self (to himself).
     An' the next mornin', ah, but Monica came to this house
that was near the road.  An' ah, she said that she bammed on
that house an' bammed on it 'cause she could hear peoples in
there an' ah, 'way up you could see there's a -- it's a two
