Dear Mr. Engel:

I met Mr. Lorax last week in New York, and we talked over many things, he asked
me to have the recording instrument returned here for checking over etc.  This
morning I received a letter from him, written in West Virginia, confirming this.
I have asked the Return Loads Bureau to pick up the instrument complete as follows:
1 case recording unit                                          [*1 Dictaphone No 14744 O*]
1 case amplifier unit                                           [*24 Records*]
1 case 3 cells of Edison Batteries
1 case 3 cells of Edison Batteries
1 microphone suspended on stand
1 50 feet lenghth of cable.

A copy of this letter goes to the Return Loads Bureau. They will have a truck leaving Washington for New York on Monday and another later in the week. They will handle everything very carefully, especially the microphone. I trust this action meets with your approval.

I have not been able to get to Washington to give your organization a demonstration, but will do this sometime with one of my regular instruments.

I have not been able to find the metal record you made at the studio, but have found the one made on celluloid. I am going to make another search for it however, and if it  is found, I will deliver it to your New York office.

Very truly yours,
W.C. Garwick
