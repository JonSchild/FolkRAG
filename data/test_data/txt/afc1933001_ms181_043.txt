Dear Mr. Rael:

Sometime ago I wrote to Ricardo Archuleta, Cerro New Mexico
asking for his permission to release in the form of pressings
three of his songs. For this privilege we are able to pay him
our standard fee and in his case it came to $18.00. These 
records will be mostly used as you can understand for educational
purposes. Their first destination will be the libraries and
universitites of Latin America. Of course all credit will be
given to singers and collectors. Would you be kind enough to
help me get in touch with Senor Archuleta. I have so far received
no reply from him and I wonder whether the address of Cerro, New
Mexico is enough. Please send me word by return Air Mail if it 
is at all possible.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
