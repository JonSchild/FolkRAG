Shirley's address is Battery Inn,
Charleston, S.C. It would be
fine for you to stop and see
her as you travel to Mississippi
Hit in to the coast so you
can stop and see Mrs. Chandler
at Murrell's Inlet. She is
worth a visit, and she lives
and works right on the Highway
to Charleston.

send. We don't know where
Bess is at. Johnny is to be here
this week, and en route to
Norfolk, Va. 
Lovingly,
Father.
