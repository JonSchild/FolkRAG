PROSPECTUS ON RUMOR CLINICS

The following points outline briefly the plan for organization of Rumor Clinics:

1. Approximately 25 universities and colleges in all section of the country will be designated in the Spring of 1942 to operate official Rumor Clinics.

2. Each Rumor Clinic shall be headed by a qualified professor selected by the president of the university.

3. The head of the Rumor Clinic shall recruit for his unit approximately 25 professors and advanced students as participants. Each participant must sign up for not less than 4 hours per week of volunteer work, plus 2 hours for participation in a weekly conference.

4. Each professor and student shall devote the first two weeks to a concentrated study of the nature of psychological warfare and of the procedures to be used in the Rumor Clinics as set forth in the forthcoming Rumor Clinic syllabus. It is urged that at least four meetings of the group be held during this period for lectures by the head of the Clinic and discussion of subject matter outlined in the syllabus. At the end of this period the head of the Clinic will examine the volunteers. Examination suggestions will be forwarded later. The head of the Rumor Clinic will certify to the president of the university the names of the volunteers who passed.

5. The president of the university will certify to the U. S. Office of Education that a minimum of 25 students and professors have qualified for participation in the Rumor Clinic work. The Office of Education will then designate the group as an official Rumor Clinic. This preparatory work and final designation should take place prior to April 9th.
