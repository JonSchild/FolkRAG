Dr. Homer P. Rainey, President 
The University of Texas, 
Austin, Texas. 

Dear Dr. Rainey: 

I am writing to Mr. Boatright asking him to let me 
see a copy of the thesis on Czech Folk-Lore so that I can
 make up my mind whether or not it is important for Mrs. Jakobson
to come to Texas. 

In the meantime, I hope you will keep the project in 
mind. If the University is not able to provide any sort of 
financial sponsorship, perhaps you would consider giving Mrs. 
Jakobson your moral support in allowing her to make the 
University her center of operations while she is in Texas. 

Thanking you for your kind letter, I am 
Sincerely yours, 

Alan Lomax, 
Information Specialist.
