1. Did you hear the joke- A german , an Italian and
a Frenchman were in a plane, There was motor
trouble and they were forced to bail out. But they
had no parachute. After a while the Italian decided
to jump so he jumped and said "Bravo Mussolini"
The next to jump was the Frenchman. He said "Viva La
France"
The third to jump was the german but instead of
jumping he pushed out the pilot + said "Long
live Germany." - The dirty rat-
