Fisk, 13.  8.  STARK.

They have got help from the white people here -- The Government sent 
in here for the po' people, they got to go to the white people to 
get it.
I remember here in '31 I think, they sent a carload of meat here to 
give the people but they had no work to do, no place,to go -- they kept it here until it spoiled, until it was no good, before they gave 
it to them.  And the Government furnished flour and things here ; right 
on the side Not to be Sold, To be Given Out.  They wouldn't give it to em; they sold it to em.
And our people, us colored people, we try to do what satisfy them, we 
get along better, if you're that type.  Some fellows say, "I wouldn't 
do such-and-such athing."  I say, "I wouldn't [d]either if Ididn't have 
a family."  "I wouldn't work forwhat you work for."  I say, "I wouldn't 
[work] either but, â€œ I said, "I [gut] cold do without something but them 
little children can't do it.."  I can't see no man walk off and leave 
that woman and them little children.

While the shot and shell was screamin,
Upon the battle scene,
The boys in blue was fighting
Noble flags to shield.
Came a cry from our captain,
"Look, boys, our [g]flag is down.
Move on to and seize it from disgrace."
"[H] I will," allowed Boys Grace ?).
"Ill bring it back or die,
And put it in the thi[n]ckets.
-- Oh disgrace!"
To put the [g]flag, they killed his young life,
All for his country's sake.
They brought him back and softly heard him say --
"Just bring the news to mother;
You know how 'tis, I love her.
And tell her not to wait for me --
I'm not comin home.
She knows there is no other,
Can take the place of mother.
And kiss her [?] on the sweet lips for me,
And bring the news to her."
From afar a noted general
Had witnessed this brave deed.
"Who saved our flag, pick up, lads
