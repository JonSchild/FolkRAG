On a Monday eveing in March, between four and five oclock,
Great buildings like play-toys began to leave their blocks.
A fierce storm was raging, which passed through six states,
Leaving a train of death and destruction in its wake.
CHORUS
What a storm that evening,
In different parts of the land
What a storm that evening
Men died on every hand.
 (2)
Two clouds commence rising, in the east and in the west,
They rose higher, and higher until they finally met.
They clashed against each other, as it were a ball of fire,
There came a terrible roaring, like a hundred fourth of Julys.
 (3)
The people started running, screaming and falling everywhere,
Water Valley, Grenada, Greenwood, Itta Bena and Berclair.
The rains commence falling, thundering and lighting, too,
The wind started blowing, as it never blew before.
(4)
You talk about your '27 water, many of our friends were drowned,
And about the storm in Tupelo, where so many people went down,
The Natchez fire disaster, which happen some years ago,
But the storm that happened that Monday, was the worst that ever happened
before.
 (5)
The train was at Itta Bena, but by the time it got to Moorehead,
The storm was practically over and many a soul was dead.
The wind, somehow, got angry, and it did just as it pleased,
Blew churches and schools in the river, set automobiles in trees.
(6)
A man and his wife were frightened, and gave themselves up to die,
Put their arms around each other, together they wanted to die.
Their house was blown to pieces, goods scattered everywhere,
But when it was all over, they were left standing there.
 (7)
There was a woman with a baby, she was carrying it in her arms,
The stor mdestroyed the woman, but the babe was left unharmed.
God works in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform,
He hears his children when they pray and makes the storm be calm.
(8)
Satan is the God of this world, the prince and power of the air,
By him all nations disturbed, and troubled everywhere.
He tried to tempt our Saviour when he was hungered and weak,
Then sent a storm on the ocean. to destroy him while he was sleep.
(9)
Now Christians let's be careful, and don't forget to pray,
Lest he sends a storm without warning, and take us all away.
The The sun that rose this morning was shining in our face,
Maybe this time ,tomorrow's sun may shine upon our grave.
