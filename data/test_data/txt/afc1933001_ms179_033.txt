Mr. Arthur Becker
Star Record Company
17 West 60 Street
New York, N. Y.

Dear Becker:
     Neither Jerry nor I has any ideas 
about a job. I am sure, however, that it will be 
easily possible for a trained person like yourself
to find employment in the Navy or Army as a technician
if you will make application to those departments.
I know they are looking for people.
Best wishes and best regards.

Sincerely,

Alan
