I want you to just barely touch it,
Touch it just a little bit,
Just something another like a fraction.
Singing leader:
What did the old lady say when who come to die?
Hand on her hip and de odder on 'er thigh,

Gang:
O Lord, have mercy,
O Lord, have mercy.
My wife had a fever, 
So bad, hate to leaver her.
Mobile, Alabama,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Track Caller:
Now, run on down yonder to the third johnny-head
And throw it North,
Get your back-breakin' holts an' chunk it off the right-of-way; boys.
Singing Leader:
All right now, boys,
Let me tell you bout tampin ties this time.

Gang: 
Have to tamp em up solid
Have to tamp em kinda slow.
Jack the Rabbit, Jack the Bear,
Caincha move it, just a hair.
Sis Joe, don't you hear me now?
Sis Joe, don't you hear me now?

Track Caller:
Now, you'll have to put your guns on your shoulders? come by me,
An come in a hurry,
Come trottin
Come laughin
Come like you gonna get paid for it,
Get a move on you,
An go by the water tank and get you some water,
Git your linin' bars an' git your back breakin' holts,
Throw it North.

Gang and Singing Leader:
Yea
In the mornin when you rise
Pick and shevil by your side.
In the mornin when you rise,
Got a pain in your side.
