10

She bursted all asunder then,
And the flames rolled over their heads,
She cried alas! how sad they sleep
Wrapped up in a red hot flame.

Their little bones lay on the ground,
They both lay face to face,
Each other did entwine,
Each other did embrace.

No. 9

JOHN THE BAPTIST
In those days came John, the Baptist,
Preaching in the Wilderness;
John commanded repentance
At the hand of every man.

Now poor sinners will you hearken
To the voice of the Lord,
As it's spoken through the Prophet,
To the ears of every one.

Will you now accept the offer,
That your Savior sent to you,
And to keep the whole commandments
As He laid them down to you?

Brother, awake, the light is shining,
Christ is with us here below;
He will be our light in darkness
If we the Gospel Trumpet blow.

We must bear with persecution,
Matters not how great they be,
We must pray to God our Father
He will give us victory.

Now dear sisters will you listen
