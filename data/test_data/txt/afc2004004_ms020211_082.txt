Dear Mr. Lombard:
      Next week I will send you what publicity material I
have.  The proposal you mentioned including the fee seems
satisfactory for the three-week period beginning October 19.
I will consider the group booked for this period when I have
received a letter of contract from you that the group manager
can sign.
     The option through June 15 is agreeable to me provided
that between now and the first of June, or some other feasible
date, you can assure me that the group will obtain a reasonable
number of bookings.  Can you now suggest a minimum guarantee
or do you first need a trial exploratory period?  I should also
like to arrange a sliding scale for the weekly fee that would
be related to the price you can obtain for the group.  In other
words, at sometime in the future, we must agree on what your
gross commission will be.
     One thing more, I feel it would be a very good idea
if I could give the group about three days of rehearsal before
they go on the road.  Perhaps the least expensive thing to do
would be for me to go to Georgia and to bring the guitar player
across from Mississippi to Georgia for that period before they
start out.  I think you would get a far better show out of this,
better programmed, etc., and it would cost no more than my
round trip plane fare to Brunswick.
     May I have your reaction to this letter?
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
