Dear Sir:

     This letter has two or three objects.  First, I wonder if
you are on the lecture platform any of this year.  I heard so many students
speak favorably of your other lecture here that I believe it
could be arranged for you to return some time, if you are available.
I am not the chairman of the Public Programs Committee, but I am a 
member of it.  In view of the increased interest in folk lore in
this state I believe also that some other institutions might be 
interested, if approached on the subject.
      I do not know whether you received the enclosed sheets or 
not, but I believe not.  They will tell you about the new Society up
here.  We would be very glad to have you become a member of it, if
you feel that it is worth while.  We hope to publish something worth
while the very first year.  The outlook is very encouraging, and
the personnel of the Society is of a high class.
     I am still collecting folk lore.  While I have quite a 
few songs--more than twice as many as the list I sent you --- I have
been emphasizing folk tales of late.  In regard to the songs, I wonder
what you would charge me for an expert opinion as to the value
of some songs that I have.  I had thought of publishing some of the 
best ones as an early publication of the Folk Lore Society.  As I
am one of the editors, it would not be quite ethical for me to pass
judgment on the value of my own collection.  You could certainly do
this, and I am willing to pay you for it.  If this is agreeable, I 
can send you my list of song titles, with brief descriptions where
necessary.  You could select those that you want to examine and I
could send them to you.
     I lost my father last month.  He left me copies of some of
his old songs and wrote a diary of his experiences in Colorado, on
the cow trails, on ranches, etc.  Some time when I feel like it I
am going to look them over.  We still have a mountain girl with us,
but not the one who was with us before.  You might tell Alan that
she is married--the first one.

I am
Cordially yours,
J.A. Rickard
