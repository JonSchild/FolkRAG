I thought you were a teetotaler
Faith & I am, but I'm not a
bigoted man.
--
May your undertaker never
live through his teething -
Bad luck to you
Well, then good luck to you &
may neither of our prayers ever
happen
Six eggs to you & a half dozen
of them rotten
--
Take your court of me - may
it fall on your bull pup.
He's a melted rogue
I'm the heart's blood of an honest
man!
Whistle jigs to a milestone!
-vain effort
