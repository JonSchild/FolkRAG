[sounding] singing voice had a wonderful influence over the restless and [nervous] frightened 
animals traveling in a region that was strange to them. So long 
as the cattle could hear some [human] voice crooning [to them] a little lullaby they
had no fear of the howl of the wolves or the scream of [the] a Mexican 
lion or any of the [other noises] sudden noises of the night. So they were soothed to sleep and 
soothed after they were asleep by what the cowboys sometimes called dogie 
songs. Never a rain storm at night but that the cowboys 
were rousted from their beds to "talk" to the cattle

   [As a child] I used to lie awake at night and hear the cowboys,
only a short distance away on the prairie, singing to the cattle.
Many a [night] time I have gone to sleep with this music, soft and lonely,

English professor, a Johns Hopkins doctor of philosophy, in the hope 
that he might find merit in them. He was kind enough to read them 
through, but told me firmly that I had best do my research in some 
other [direction] realm of study. 
   Later in Harvard University I [took a course in] studied contemporary 
American literature under Professor Barrett Wendell. Being required 
to write a term theme on some phase of literature, preferably about
some local author, I selected with some trepidation the subject of 
cowboy songs. Professor Wendell had his conferences in Gray's Hall 
in Harvard Square. I shall always remember [perfectly] vividly my first
