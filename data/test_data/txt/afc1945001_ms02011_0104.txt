such rumors require long, involved answers; it is
best to break them up into separate, short rumors
which can be denied effectively.

13. If long rumors are printed, they should be denied in
full. To deny only one part of a rumor permits other
parts to go unchallenged.

14. Where a rumor is denied by an authority, quoted in 
the column, it is worth considering whether the authority
will be believed by most readers--or whether 
readers may not think, "What other answer would you
expect him to give?" A rumor about bankers, for example,
may be denied more effectively by someone who
is not a banker than by someone known to express the
official viewpoint of bankers. Similarly, a rumor
about labor may better be denied by someone not identified
with labor.

15. Where an authority is used to deny the rumor, it is 
best to avoid cluttering up the identification of the
authority with long, technical titles and data. This
may reduce the readers' interest and cool off his
curiosity about the rumor-denial.

16. If an authority supplies an answer which is weak or
ineffective (or which falls into one of the errors 
cited above), it is wise to suggest a re-wording
before printing the rumor denial.

17. Some rumors probably should not be denied. Rumors
