Mr. John A. Lomax
General Delivery
Raiford, Florida

Dear Mr. Lomax:

1. I know very well that you can think up a better way
of holding us up for $500. when you want to. Anyway, I should
not have suspected you because the method employed was not 
traditional. The wild and wooly west always employed more
direct methods! (The records have been released - probably
the result of your letter.)

2. I am so glad to hear that the records were forwarded to
you. We sent a package of records to Florida on receiving
your wire.

3. I am sorry to hear about the disappearance of the gang
work-songs but in a country as vital as ours, something must be
forming to take its place.

With regard to the letter you enclosed, I must warn you
that the result is apt to embarrass you with your eager Texas
friends for they have invited Alan to sing for them.

I hope that you are enjoying your trip.

With best regards to Mrs. Lomax,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
