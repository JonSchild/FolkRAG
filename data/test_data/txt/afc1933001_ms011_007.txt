your direction

Mr Leland, by the way, 
approved of the idea of
having a Committee of the
Modern Language Association
designated to consider plans
for a unified movement
to collect Folk-Songs.  I
shall try, of course, to
make the collections center
in the Music Division,
and I shall report to 
you later. Kindest regards,
Yours,
John A. Lomax.
