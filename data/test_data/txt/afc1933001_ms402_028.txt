NEGRO SPIRITUALS
Once while speaking before the students of Oberlin College in
referring to Negro humor, even in his spirituals, I quoted a couple
of stanzas I had heard sung in a small wayside church among the big
cotton plantations of the Brazos bottoms in Texas:
"Methodist preacher, you are dead,
You poured water on the baby's head;
Baptist preacher, you are right,
Case you take them candidates out o' sight.
I went to the river to be baptised,
I stepped on a rock and I got capsized.
The water was deep and the preacher was weak,
So the nigger went to heaven from the bottom of the creek.
Up until the time I made this quotation the audience had followed sympathetically
the illustrations I had given of the picturesque imagery
and poetic phrasing found among the humblest congregation of the backwoods.
Now this vigorous defense of the Baptist doctrine of immersion
and the story of an accident in a creek water-hole sent the crowd into
gales of laughter. The last resistance between speaker and audience
broke down, leaving me happy. Joining uproariously in the laughter
was a portly young instructor of modern languages seated near the stage.
As I attempted to go on, suddenly he again exploded, taking the audience
with him. He threw up his arms, tilted back his head and shouted his
guffaws. Again before I had spoken half a sentence his merriment again
erupted, this time louder than ever; and once more the audience followed
him. Repeatedly the same thing happened until the play was out
of my hands. Thereafter, it must have been a full five minutes that
the audience, forgetting me entirely, laughed at the antioe of the
hysterical young man. He even stuffed a handkerchief into his mouth.
A blast from within would blow it out as he and the sympathetic audience
howled in unison. They had forgotten the lecturer and were laughing
