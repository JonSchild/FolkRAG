m Today: Only Saigon's Poor Seem

which emblazons the lifelike
picture of the late North Vietnamese 
leader, Ho Chi Minh,
which hangs from Independence
Palace where President 
Nguyen Van Thieu once held 
sway. Thieu now lives in exile 
on Taiwan. 

  The fancy French restaurants with the fine wines are virtually empty.
   There is scarcely an American in sight. And middle-class Vietnamese no longer want to be seen in public with the few Americans who remained behind after the United States evacuation April 29. 

   While there has been no evidence of a bloodbath or mass reprisals as so freely predicted abroad, the spirit of many of the 3 1/2 million Saigonese appears to have been killed, the heartbeat of the city cut out. But for the first time in 30 years, the fund have fallen silent, refugees are returning to their ancestral villages, fields are being plowed instead of bombed and shelled, and homes are being rebuilt. 
   It is the fear of austerity and regimentation by the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) which has broken the spirit of many of the middle class, upper class and rich Saigonese. The banks have been closed for a month, a move that appears deliberately designed by the PRG to control money circulation and make rice a key item to barter. The rich have been hard hit but the poor are unaffected. 
   Movie houses that once featured the top American and French films now show only the life of Ho Chi Minh. The bars and the nightclubs are closed, some of them turned into barracks for the PRG soldiers. 
  There is still an aura of apprehension, and a fear of reprisals but some  awesome predictions have never materialized. The orphans that some predicted would be killed  by the PRG or made Communists appear to he well taken care of. Children still play in the parks as they always did, but I have seen some youngsters, with arms folded or manacled,  marched up the streets by PRG soldiers in shame and  disgrace for thievery.

Some of the same children who made a business of begging under the former regime are doing the same under the new government. And as before women still borrow

what their roles might be. It  is not known for its coffee or pastries, but for its rumors. Crime is rampant in Saigon but it always has been. The PRG seems to be taking the crime situation much more seriously than the previous regime did.
  There is no police force because there is no civilian government.

  The city is governed by the PRG's Military Management Committee, headed by Lt. Gen. Tran Van Tra who directed the 1968 Tet and 1972 Easter offensives in the Saigon region. 

People are stealing now because they are desperate for money and food and those let loose from the more than one million man Saigon army and police force have swelled the ranks of the more than one million that already had been unemployed under the Thieu regime.

The United States pullout also left thousands more unemployed.

The PRG is dealing more harshly with crime than the previous regime and publicizing it as a warning they do not intend to let things get out of hand. Thieves  are being tried by “people's tribunals.”

The PRG blames the crime wave like everything else, on the Americans and have published cartoons depicting Uncle Sam embracing Thieu with a family of gangsters and hippies surrounding them, while in the next caption a large crowd is yelling: "Long live the revolutionary government which is determined to eliminate thieves and robbers."
A PRG-sponsored campaign against what is called “depraved” culture also has been under way for a week with daily student demonstrations. The

considered decadent and thousands of comic books with Vietnamese translations have been turned in, according to PRG officials.

Despite the campaign against American consumer products, many are still visible in sidewalk supermarkets, including a new one at the entrance to Tan Son Nhut air base.

You can buy everything from Scotch whiskey to toilet paper. Most of these items were looted from American homes, offices and U.S. Government  leased buildings following the flight of the Americans on April 29, the day before the Saigon government surrendered, and before the PRG could establish security.

The PRG are reopening private schools, business and hospitals, trying to return a city the size of Boston to normal like. Civil servants under the Thieu regime are being called back to work, generally at half the salaries they received before, but they are also being given rations of rice for their wives and children.

The PRG says its main efforts now are being devoted to eliminating crime and hunger, stabilizing the economy, normalizing production, rebuilding the country, and raising the currently reduced standard of living. 

The PRG has not spelled out its full economic program but it is trying to eliminate unemployment by returning refugees from Saigon to their home villages in the first phase of a program which is continuing. The return to the countryside, the PRG says, is "aimed at eliminating economic difficulties left behind by the Americans and their puppet government while at the same time helping to normalize production, rebuild the country, and raise the standards of living of the population."

Many of the policies of the new government remain to be defined including its relations with North Vietnam, its domestic policies, and its foreign policy. 

The PRG says it wants to establish relations all over the world including diplomatic ties with the United States, but at a small mission level, if Washington will
