My dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter followed me to several addresses and
finally reached me here. It interests me tremendously,
but I do not plan to be in Berea this year. I spent
the past two years there doing part time teaching for
subsistence and studying music. This year I must get
back into full time work.

I myself, sing folk-songs learned in the tradi[*ti*]onal
manner. Some of these I learned in Berea, but most of
them I took there with me. These songs are native to
Virginia mountains, who "thinks up" a veritable treasurehouse
of ballads. I sang The Pretty Fair Miss, which
she taught me, in a Breathitt county (Ky.) contest
when I was a sophomore--"Bloody Breathitt". Last spring,
a year ago, I participated in the Southeastern Folklore
Society meeting which was held in Cloumbia, South Carolina.
I have a small collection of folk-songs which are among
the oldest and the best.

Could you extend your plan enough to include
Western Carolina and Virginia and use me as a helper?
I can type, if that would help. I do not know a great
deal of music, but I do know ballads as well as how
and where to find them.

Nothing would please me more than to be able to
aid in unearthing folk-songs for at least one, shallI
say, school term? It would be more interesting than
teaching and I am not yet located.

My address is Elk Park, North Caroline; I
shall leave here Sunday, August 29. I intend to
go to Draper, N. C. where the ballad singer lives
for a few days when I leave here; then to Elk Park.

Very sincerely yours
