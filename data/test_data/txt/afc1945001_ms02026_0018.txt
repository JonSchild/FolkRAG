PROPOSAL FOR RESEARCH ON WAR ATTITUDES IN CHICAGO

Directed by
Arthur.  W. Kornhauser

Two major questions indicate the direction of the project:

1.  What information concerning people's personal aims, societal orientation,
and systems of values is most useful in interpreting and dealing
with their behavior and specific attitudes in relation to the war? The response
of typical groups to the government's various means of controlling
inflation, will be conspicuous among the behavior and attitudes to be 
continuously observed and analyzed.
2.  In what respects can procedures for ascertaining such "deeper"
attitudes relating to the war best be improved?

1.  The first question implies that a distinctive contribution can
be made to the analysis of war opinion by searching for deeper lying attitudes
than those which deal directly with specific issues. The ordinary
opinion surveys, valuable and necessary as they are in describing the current
complexion and shifts of opinion, neglect the longer run and deeper
personal meanings of the war. It appears probable, however, that the most
effective measures to improve morale will be those directed toward these
personal aims and meanings. Hence, it is proposed that our research efforts
focus at this point.

More specifically, for example, we shall seek to describe the characteristic
personal aims, values, and expectations  of negroes as compared
with whites, of war industry employees compared with management representatives,
of dislocated small business men, of ex-isolationists, of Germans
still loyal to the fatherland, of low income group "Americans," etc. The
