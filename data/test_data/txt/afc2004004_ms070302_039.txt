no one goes there at night.
He is a yg countryman bailiff
of big estate lives over garage
of huge grey mossy house end
of lane miles of grey mossy
fences  Used to have step
dance contests in all the towns
Dancing in wagons - but that's
died out.  Once there was
nothing else to do but dance
& play the melodeon.  Now
Bob is trying a one man
revival.  Very genuine guy.
