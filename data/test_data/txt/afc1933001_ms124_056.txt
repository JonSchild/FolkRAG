Mr. Roy Cornette - Page 2.
August 27, 1937

I should like to know at the same time whether or not you think 
you could help me, or would be interested in doing so, when I visit 
your county this fall with the Library's recording machine.

I leave Washington for Kentucky on September the first and I 
hope to hear from you before that time. If it happens that your letter
reaches the Library after September first, it will be forwarded 
to me in Kentucky.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge,
Archive of American Folk-Song.

Compliance with the above request will be a service to the Library
