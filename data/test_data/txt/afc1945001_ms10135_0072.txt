College-Junior-Negro-Male 

1. A radio program came over The National Broadcasting System Sunday, March 14. The Program was in the form of a debate. One of the gentlemen taking part mentioned the fact that America Should consider the fact that the Negroes and other minority groups should be assured some sort of economic and Social equality. They are fighting for this "so called" Democracy as much as they are allowed to do so. 
   Another participant stated that he didn't think such minor issues as individual well fare should be discussed during the time of such a world Conflict. 
   A few minutes later a different Program came over the air discussing the problems of economical stability and the restoration after the war. -Why not discuss The Negro Problem? 
(2) Negro Boy - Father why are all of my brothers going away?
Father, To fight for Democracy son. 
Boy- What is a Democracy?
Father-  A government of the people, by the people and for the people, All men are equal in a democracy.
Boy to himself - That's funny, Dad's voice grew weak as he defined a democracy. 
(3) I just can't understand why Colourd and white kids can grow up together, and in some cases eat and sleep together, but when they are matured the White man is almost invariably better than the negro man. Although they have experienced much the same thing the white man's ability, although inferior, is greater than that of the Negro. Will an airplane flown by a "rednecked" leatherneck destroy any more japs or Germans than one flown by a "brown, yellow, red, black (Negro) necked" leatherneck.
(4) A white man once told me "I believe all men are created equal but I don't believe in inter-racial marriages because God made the colour distinction. The day before a newspaper carried this article. White man held for raping Native girl. I wonder if there is any similarity in the thoughts or opinions of these two men.
