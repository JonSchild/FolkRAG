Mr. William A. Myers
Federal Writers Project
Indianapolis, Ind.

Dear Mr. Myers:

I wrote you on August 18 and the letter
never got into the mails. Perhaps it was just as
well since I did not have time to stop by Indianapolis
on my way back to Washington. The foreign
groups you speak of there interest me very much and
I hope that in the course of your work you will be
able to develope a series of contacts for a future
visit of a recording machine.

Perhaps this will be next spring or early
summer. I would suggest that if there are any
large and interesting segments in the population
that your field works be of that group or at least
able to speak the language in question.

I want to take this opportunity to thank
you and the Indiana Writer's Project for the very
real assistance you rendered the archive on it's
Indiana field trip.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
