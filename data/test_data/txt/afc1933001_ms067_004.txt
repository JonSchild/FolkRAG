11. Stops in North Carolina
12. In Virginia I plan 
to spend a week or two 
travelling with Dr. Davis, 
head of the "Bog Trotters"
at Galax, [who l] where Virginia
meets Tennesse and North Carolina
amid high mountains.
Fin[e]ally, we ought to give 
Milwaukee an answer (you 
have the letter), and you must 
not feel that any pressure whatever 
is being brought on you by
me. Your friend, 
JohnA. Lomax
