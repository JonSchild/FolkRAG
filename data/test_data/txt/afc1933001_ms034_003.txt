Mr. John A. Lomax
400 East 34th Street
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Mr. Stunk has asked me to forward
the enclosed copy of a letter from the
Carnegie Corporation, which is self-explanatory.
May I ask, if it is convenient
to you, that you send us a copy of your
report to Carnegie, in order that we may
have it for our files.

Mr. Stunk has also asked me to acknowledge
the receipt of 79 records, which
makes the total records received from you,
379.

With best wishes to Mrs. Lomax, Alan,
and you, I am

Cordially,

Secretary, Division of
Music
