IV. Suggestions

Most of the problems of personnel and procedure will
have to be handled by individual correspondence and conference.
The purpose of this manual is simply to set up certain forms
and standards of materials and methods. Obviously the manual
will have to be carefully explained and fully interpreted to
the workers, and directors and supervisors are expected to
hold staff meeting for that purpose.

The immediate objectives are (1) the selection and training
of one or two members of each State staff to supervise the
folklore work, preferably one for each part of the state; and
(2) the working out of a flexible and efficient technique of
collecting and recording data.

The collection involves two steps: (1) the locating of
sources and informants; and (2) the recording of the folklore
material known to each informant, together with the necessary
biographical and historical data.

Workers should be assigned to their own communities, where
they have the advantage of first-hand acquaintance with materials
and persons. Those unsuited for general interviewing may be employed
in preliminary surveys (see "Method of Locating Sources
and Making Contacts with Informants") and for collecting personal
histories.
