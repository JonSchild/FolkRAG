dropped out of a window - out of one of the top stories, and they
show it to me to catch it. So I catched this paper and in it was
a threepenny bit, bit. That was the first piece of silver. He
says, "Man" he says, "Spit on it Jock," he says, "It will bring

Oh they give me a bed and I was near eaten to death with flys. There
