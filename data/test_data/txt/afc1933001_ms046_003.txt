Honorary Consultant and Curator
Folk-Song Archive
Library of Congress
Washington,D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This is to express my cordial thanks for the two copies of  "Provisional Check-List of Disks ... in the Archive of Folk-Song," sent to me recently, on your order, I am sure, by the Library of Congress.

The number of folksong recordings is impressive, and the variety and the nature of the titles are most interesting. I look forward to the time when I may have leisure, while in Washington, to visit the Folk-Song Archive and listen to some of the songs recorded.

I hope that folksong scholars and students may look forward, also, to an early realization of your plans for making duplicates of records available. It is, as you know, very difficult to get satisfactory records of folksongs from the commercial companies.

To this word of thanks permit me to add my good wishes for the success of your enterprises and my hope that your may visit these parts again. I remember with pleasure your former visits.

Yours very sincerely,
A. B. Hudson

P. S.- You may be interested to learn that the tunes to forty-odd of my Folksongs from Mississippi are in process of publication by the Federal Theatre Project, music to be edited by Herzog.
