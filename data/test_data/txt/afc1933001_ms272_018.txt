The Filipino Hombre. 
I. 
There once was a Filipine hombre, 
Who ate rice, Pescado y Legumbre. 
His trousers were wide, and his shirt hung outside
And the I may say , was costumbre.
2
He live in a nipa bahay,
Which served as a stable and sty;
He slept on a mat with the dog and the cat
And the rest of the family nearby.
3. 
His daddy un buen' Filipino,
Who never mixed tibing with bino,
Said, "I am no insurrecto, no got gun or bolo".
Yet used both to kill a vecino.
4
His mujer once kept a tienda,
Underneath a large stone hacienda.
She chewed buye, and sold jaw-bone and gold
To soldados, who said "no entienda".
5.
Of ninas she had dos or tres,
Good types of the tagala race,
In dry or wet weather, in the all-together,
They'd romp and they'd race and they'd chase.
8
He once owed a bulic manoc,
With a haughty and valorous look,
Which lost him a name, y mil pesos tambien,
So he changed to Monte for luck.
9
When his pueblo last held a fiesta,
His familia tried to digest a
Mule that had died of glanders inside,
And now his familia no esta.

O'Reilly's gone to hell
O'Reilly was a soldier the pride of Battery "C".
In all the blooming reg'ment no better man than he.
The ranking duty non Com he knew his business well
But since he tumbled down the pole.
O'Reilly's gone to Hell.
CHORUS
O'Reilly's gone to hell, since down the pole he fell
He drank up all the bug juice , The whiskey man would sell
They ran him in the mill, they've got him in there still.
His bob-tail's coming back by mail, O'Reilly's gone to hell.
2
O'Reilly hit the bottle after six years up the pole;
He blow himself at Casy's place and then went in the hole;
He drank with all the rookies and shoved his face as well.
The whole outfit is on the bum. O'Reilly's gone to hell.
Chorus.
O'Reilly swiped a blanket and shoved it up I hear;
He shoved it for a dollar and invested that in beer.
He licked a coffe cooler because he said he'd tell.
He's ten days absent without leave. O'Reilly's gone to hell.
Chorus
They'll try him by courtmartial; He'll never get a chance
To tell them how his mother died or some such song and dance
He'll soon be down in Battery "Q" a-sleeping in a cell,
A big red "P" stamped on his back. O'Reilly's gone to hell.

Old King Cole
Old King Cole was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul was he.
He called for his pipe
And he called for his bowl,
And he called for his privates three.

Chorus
"Beer, beer, beeer" said the privates
Merry men are we.
There's none so fair as can compare
With the Field Ar - til - ler - y.

Old King Cole was a merry etc --
* * * *
And he called for his corporals three
Chorus
"Beer, Beer, beer"said the privates
"One-two, one-two, one said the corporals
Merry men are we etc.

And he called for his Sergeants three
"Squads right, right by fours,"
said the Sergeants.
---------
And he called for his Shavetails three
"We do all the work" said the Shavetail
-----------
And he called his Captains three.
"W[e]here are my boots and spurs" said
the Majors
And he called his Colonels three
"What's my next command?"said the
Colonels.

"The Army's gone to hell" said the 
Generals.

Round. March along.
I.Your dreadnoughts soon will be
2. At the bottom of the sea
3 For there is mine in the Army line
4. That'll sink the whole Navy.
When Army puts on steam.
To the middies it will seem
That the kay-det grey
Has the right of way
O'er ev'ry Navy team.
