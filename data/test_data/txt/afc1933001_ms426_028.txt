END OF A FARMER'S DAY
Tune--End of A Perfect Day.
When you come to the end of a day of toil,
And you sit alone with your task,
And the evening fades with a sad recoil,
With a danger you cannot mask,
Can you think how it hurts to give up your home,
With labor and savings gone,
When you've done your best, but will have to roam
Toward the west with a setting sun.

Well, this is the end of a farmer's day,
As he sits alone with his thought.
While he sees his farm drift from him away,
With the joy he so dearly bought.
For memory recalls how he dreamed and worked,
To build for is own a home.
Now it's gone just as if he had always shirked,
And lost is his goal--his crown.

Now the Union will fight for a perfect day,
When the farmer can smile and be glad,
When you home will be safe ad our farming pay,
And our hearts will be seldom sad.
For justice will win if we'll all be true,
God lives in His heaven high.
And the flag still waves red and white and blue.
For a better bye and bye.

WHEN THE UNION GETS A HOLD
Tune--There's Music in the Air.
There's music in the air, when the Union gets a hold,
There's vision all a-stir, when the Union nears a goal.
Many a farmer lifts his head, finds that he is not yet dead,
Takes a smile on big and bold, when the Union gets hold.

There's courage in the air, when the boys begin to join,
There's laughter in the hearts, when a brighter hope is born.
Many a soul in sad defeat, found itself upon it's feet,
Many a mind an anchor found, when the Union took the ground.
