"The draft board in Murray is taking married men and leaving single 
men at home with deferments for no good reason. The married men who work 
with my husband are constantly worried and upset because cases come to their 
attention of married men being taken and single fellows, of their acquaintance, 
being allowed to escape service when they have no dependents. There's a man 
and his wife in charge of that draft board out there and they're disliked 
thoroughly. When my husband went in there to check on his status they made
him feel like a draft-dodger. The married men, with and without children,
feel like the Selective Service doesn't mean a thing -- that it's politics 
that counts." [*Salt Lake City 8-6   21*]
