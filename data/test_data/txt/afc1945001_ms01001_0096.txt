tendency to save one's self time and to skip the reading of the counteraction.
Since most reading is of spotty sort, quick, casual review of
material, rather than a careful analysis of the precise implications of
the content, the reader who recognizes a "this is not so" counteraction,
would be inclined to skip the full statement and go on to the next juicy
tidbit.
                 Items that are particularly true are difficult to counteract since
it is always necessary, if one chooses to be honest, to acknowledge the
truthful part.  While the occasional inclusion of this sort of item lends variety
and greater acceptance of the column as a whole, care is needed.  Any statement
that presents a rumor first and then a counteraction where one says,
"it is true--but," loses the effectiveness needed for the elimination of
the rumor.  Most rumors do have some kernel of truth but if this becomes
emphasized, readers will end up with greater confidence in rumors than
before.  The rumor must be described as false tremendous exaggeration, a
distorted picture--emphasis on the errors, with a minor passing gesture
toward the true parts.

                 A rumor that has two parts, or is relatively lengthy, should not
be included in direct counteraction program.  If the rumor is complex in
form, then the response to it will have to be relatively complex and it
becomes difficult for the untrained reader to keep the various parts separate.
He loses the nub of what is being denied.  The whole sequence becomes a reading
exercise without the sharp lining up of the "False" and "True" which is implied
in the sort of program designed.
