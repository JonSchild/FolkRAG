Mr. Harold Spivacke          -2-          April 25, 1939

tried them out, and they are working again. I believe
this is an account of all my troubles. 

Meanwhile, when you write, if you have any lively
news about Alan, please pass it on. He seems so submerged
in a cataclysm of activities that I seldom hear from him.

Kindest regards, in which Miss Terrill joins me,
especially to Mrs. Spivacke.

Sincerely yours
John A. Lomax
