Spokane, Washington; Bess
has just been released from

just plugging away at my 
desk.  I'd like to stay here 
and go fishing with Cap'n
"Florida" Roberts (the fishing 
season is just opening), but

period of rest; and I 
must get out and "strike
the sounding furrows."

check if you'll locate that passage).
