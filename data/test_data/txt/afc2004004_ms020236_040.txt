on over there some time."   I said, "Me and Catherine belong to 
the same church, at home," I said.   An' she know.  I said, then.  
An' she me taught;         [what kinda] churches she not goin' 
[an'] ou' there to dancin' an things.   An' I didn' know she didn' like Catherine.  
An' all at once she flew up right then,  "Who is Catherine; she 
ain' anybody!"   That loud, Catherine could hear.   "Who is her?  
She ain't this an ' she ain't that!"   Oh, she jus' went on, but 
bad.   "She ain't no better than anybody else; she do soandso an' 
I do it, too."   You know, they's jus' nasty words, y'know.   An ' 
I just looked at her; I didn' know what t'say. . .I was jus' [xxxx]
kinda...I was out done.   So I could see Catherine was lookin' 
at her too, from the window.   So I turn [on from her] around from 
her.   I said, "Well, as I see it," I says, "Don' let her --"  
She says, "Goddam her!   Let her hear it; [wanna] wan' 'er to hear."  
[its] She's a big, rough woman.  They whup mens, her an' her mama.  
They was tough.   An' she, she [had] pat herse'f, ya know, an' she, 
"Tell 'er I say so; she don' hear me, tell 'er I say so.  She 
ain' no better than nobody else.  You ain' got [the] (to do as ?) 
Catherine."   An' so Catherine jus' didn' look at her.  Catherine 
couldn' catch on to it there.  There musta been sumpin' that I 
said, y'know.   Ya know.   So I went on to Catherine's house an' 
I told her what it was.   An' Catherine laughed.  Catherine said, 
"She just don' like me."  Said, "They [jus'] don' like me; I don' 
go to their place."   Said, "They ain't been there almost two 
years."   Said, "I don' mind; I don't go there."  Said, "They
jus' don't like me 'cause I don't go there."   Said, "Tha's all."  
Said, "I ain' never done nothing to 'em, but they jus' don' like 
me. . .They don' like me for that part."   That was all.   So I 
said, "Well, they won't like me.  Let 'em go away from (?) me!"  
I was jus' -- I was outdone.   I had heard about how bad her an' 
her mother was; they was men whuppers; they tough and they rough!  
An' they big and strong; they wasn't jokin'.  They was jus' 
natchully rough women, her and her mother both.  So anyway, her 
name was Eva and her mother's name was Stell.   ['Cause] Called 'er Bad Stell, and 
she was, too.
