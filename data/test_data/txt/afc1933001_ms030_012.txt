Mr. E. P. Jennings
North Bennington, Vt.

My dear Mr. Jennings:

I quote from a letter received today from Mr. Lomax:

"I think it will be possible for
Alan or for me to be with Mr. Jennings
when he visits Meridian, Miss.
That section has interesting folk song
possibilities. I shall await his letter
before deciding."

Faithfully yours,
Chief, Division of Music
