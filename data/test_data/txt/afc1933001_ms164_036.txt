The Hundred Pipers (Scottish Border Ballad) . . 
 Kenneth Murchison
     In November, 1745, two thousand clansmen, led by "Bonnie Prince Charlie" 
on a white charger, marched upon Carlisle, to the sound of a hundred bagpipes, 
to claim the crown for their prince. At Longtown they forded the swollen Esk, 
then the border between Scotland and England, with only their heads and 
shoulders visible above the water. But they clung to each other and not a man 
was lost. Safely landed, the pipers struck up, and all danced reels and strathspeys 
until they were dry.

Cantate Domino .  .  .  .  .  .   Hans Leo von Hassler
     "Sing unto the Lord a new song. Sing unto the Lord all ye lands, and bless 
His holy name. Declare His salvation from day to day. Make known His glory 
among all nations. His wonders among all peoples." Hassler (1564-1612) was one 
of the Venetian school of contrapuntal composers, among whom Palestrina is the 
best known. 

On Great Lone Hills .  .  .  .  .  Jan Sibelius--Matthews
     The symphonic tone-poem, "Finlandia," because of its typically national spirit, 
has been immensely popular with the Finnish people since its composition in 1894. 
This theme--peaceful, exalted and prophetic of ultimate rest and happiness--occurs 
midway in the tone-poem, scored first for woodwinds, joined in the repetition by 
the strings. But it has won great favor in the choral setting, which is faithful to the 
original part-writing.

Chants d'automne .  .  .  .  .  .  Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns
    "Songs of Autumn" consists of three different poems or moods inspired by the 
autumn season. The first is descriptive of the fall of the year--the harvest, the 
bee winging home to the hive, the lark hymning of the morning sun. The second is a 
love-song, urging the love-lorn maid to wait patiently for the spring to reawaken her 
lover's ardor. The third is a stirring paean of patriotic fervor, in strong military rhythm, 
enjoining the young soldier to emulate his country's legendary heroes.

Hey Robin, Jolly Robin  .  .  .  .  .  .  Geoffrey Shaw
     A second all-British group opens with two Shakespeare settings. The words of 
this one appear in "Twelfth Night" (Act IV), sung by the clown.

Orpheus with His Lute .  .  .  .  .  .  Augustus Barratt
     Act III of "Henry the Eighth" is the source of this poem.

One More River  .  .  .  .  .  .  Peter Warlock
     The late Peter Warlock, British writer, editor and composer, whose real name 
was Philip Heseltine, was well-known for his songs and his imaginative settings of 
folk-music. "One More River" appears to be a combination of a negro song with 
the French refrain of an old college ditty. 

What Shall We Do with a Drunken Sailor . Marshall Bartholomew
     The role of chanteys in the sailor's daily work routine has become more or less 
familiar. They not only provide the rhythm which at once lightens individual effort 
and makes concerted action possible, but also inspire an uplifted mental attitude 
which effaces the drudgery of toil. The present example is one of the more amusing 
sea chanteys.

Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring .  .  Johann Sebastian Bach
     One of the most beautiful melodies to be found anywhere in music is this 
chorale from Bach's Cantata No. 147. The piano arrangement was made by the 
distinguished pianist, Myra Hess.
