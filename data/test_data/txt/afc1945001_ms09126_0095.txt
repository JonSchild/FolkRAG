1) I want ad quoted by radio commentator:
"Educated man with can of beans,
would like to meet cultured
lady with bottle of catsup."
(the effects of food rationing)

2) Signs of the Times (since the war)
"The store will be closed on Sunday
for the duration."
Revised:
"This store will be closed for the duration 
of the meat ration and the sugar ration 
and the coffee ration plus the can-
foods and dried fruit ration."

3. When you haven't long finger nails you can buy some, the same goes for hair, teeth and it used to go for clothes.
Last year you couldn't buy stockings as you painted them on. This year you can't buy shoes without a stamp. What
will you do if you lose your stamp?
This person will be thankful for an answer.
