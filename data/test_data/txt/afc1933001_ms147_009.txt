Dear Mr. Spaziani:
Thank you for your postal.
It is a great pleasure to know 
that there are people interested 
in cowboy songs at Hartford, and 
I certainly think that someday 
there will be such a society as 
you suggest. In fact, it sounds 
like a very good idea.

With very best regards, I am

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge of the Archive of American Folksong
