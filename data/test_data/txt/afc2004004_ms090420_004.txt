B: Well Slim, I tell you--I tell you another one, it's about
a fella was settin' down one day--now it was you brought up
about the preacher-- we'll tell one about the preacher. You
know, they was an old preacher in the pulpit, see, and he 
had a couple deacons settin' around and they all had--faith
in this old preacher, you know, and anything he said , why,
they--all tried to do what he--ask them to do, you know?

So this preacher got up in the pulpit and he was preachin'
you know, and he says, "AaaAAHH, ladies and gentlemans," says,

Says, "I--I've had money-yah, and I've own car-rah, and I've
got my own buildin-nah, and I got everything I need-dah, but
I never found nothin' yit, on earth, to me, as good as a 
good old-time religion-nah." And he says, "Now if anybody
in here, in the church, anywhere around-dah, can get up now
and tell me anything is better to them than a good old-time

when he got to his feet, stood up, this preacher looked
down there and seed him, he says, "Listen, John, if you git
up here and name pussy in this church tonight I'll kill you!"
