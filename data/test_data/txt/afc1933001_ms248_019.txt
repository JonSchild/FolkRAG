7456 SAN BENITO WAY
DALLAS, TEXAS
2/17/1942

Dear Alan: If your plans for
tires wont work, send me
authority for this railroad trip

1. Dallas to Abilene, Pecos, Toyah
on the [Southern] Texas and Pacific
2. Toyah to Alpine via Texas and Pacific
and Southern Pacific (much cheaper
by bus)
3. Alpine to Dallas via San Antonio
and Austin, by Southern Pacific
and Katy

Then another trip from Dallas to
Pampa, via Denver R.R.; then from 
Pampa to Henryetta, Okla., by
I don't know what railroad
and back to Dallas.
