THE STUDY OF THE CHICAGO PRESS

Directed By

Ithiel Pool

 The Chicago press invites continuing research in war-time because
the Chicago newspapers serve as type models of all the major newspaper
approaches to the war. The Chicago Tribune is the outstanding isolationist
paper in the country, and a paper of great power. The Herald-American is
a typical Hearst paper. The Chicago Sun and the Chicago Times are liberal
Democratic papers supporting the administration. Finally, the Daily News
is an example of a conservative and Republican paper, which is, however,
all out for the war.
 As its first subject of study this project is taking the headlines,
editorials, and special dispatches to the paper by its own correspondents.
The press service stories are much alike in the different papers. By excluding
them we focus our attention on those parts of the paper which are
most sharply slanted toward the publishers' point of view. We are content
analyzing this material with three primary problems in mind: optimism and
pessimism, criticism and unity, and the effect of the paper on public opinion.
 1. Optimism is not a simple phenomenon. In a previous study of the 
press in a war situation (the French press during the battle of France) we
found an elaborate mechanism of compensation for bad events in one sphere
by an increase of optimism in another less relevant sphere. Overoptimism
does not consist simply in predictions of victory in 1942 nor in the proportion
of good and bad battle news headlines. The purpose of this is to trace
the confidence leval continuously in all the major spheres of war news,
observing the shifts in complacency and realism under the impact of events.
