We're along, Doney Gal, in the wind and hail,
Got to drive these dogies down the trail.
We'll ride the range from sun to sun, 
For a cowboy's work is never done;
He's up and gone at the break of day,
Drivin' the dogies on their weary way.
It's rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal are on the go. 
Yes, rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal are bound to go.
A cowboy's life is a weary thing,
For it's rope and brand and ride and sing;
Yes, day or night in the rain or hail,
He'll stay with his dogies out on the trail.
Rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal are on the go;
We travel down that lonesome trail
Where a man and his horse seldom ever fail.
We whoop at the sun and yell through the hail,
But we drive the poor dogies down the trail;
And we'll laugh at the storms, the sleet and snow,
When we reach the little town of San Antonio.
