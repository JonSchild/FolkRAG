Dear Dr. Spivake:

I understand that the Library of Congress has a very
fine collection of phonograph recordings of native folk music. Is this
material ever loaned out? Or is there any other way in which the records
may be had?

We are giving a course on Primitive Music and Dance this
year and it is necessary to have illustrations of Indian music, American
folk music, and primitive music of other nations. Naturally, I thought of 
the collection of the Library of Congress.

Any information that you may give me will be very much
appreciated.

Very truly yours,
Dorothea N. Bestor
