Kennedy: I don't know. Everybody calls it something different.
D. Kennedy: Something different. Some people call it Sweet William,

Cox: Well. . . Father, father build me a boat.
D. Kennedy: Father, father build me a boat. The first line.
Cox: Yeah. They know all them old songs by the first line. (pause)
Some songs go by the chorus, some go by the first line. (pause)
Kennedy: Is there a respectable version of The Crabfish? (pause)
Cox: I don't know nothin' about. . . What crab?
Kennedy: The Crab; The Crabfish.
Cox: I never did hear one about. . . 
Kennedy: Oh, Harry, come.
Cox: What?
Kennedy: Don't you know one about a crab.
Cox: No. (pause) I don't know one about a crab. At least, if I do I
forget.
Kennedy: I thought that was one that they sang at the pub, at
Eelsfoot.
Cox: Why - I know one about the stormy old weather, windy old
weather.
Kennedy: It's in that, Harry.
Cox: Was it? Was it that?

Up jumped the crab with his great long claw,
He sang out, "Old skpper, you'll run her ashore,
In this windy old weather. . ."
