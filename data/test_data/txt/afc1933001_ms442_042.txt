Era. Was in de kitchen, cookin' my breakfas' an' I'd been
out all night long. An' I was so shamed of mysef' to see her
standin there cryin'[.an' when she] ['gin to cry] she 'gin to cry an' I go an' pat
her on de shoulder an' here was de word she said:

Lead Belly Sings:
Nyah—ah, ["Ah-------], hey, hey, hey, hey,
Nyah—ah, ["Ah-------], daddy, you on my min'.
I ain' got but dis minute, dat's [why] when I am cryin'.

An' I would not[-a] been here, had not been for you[-ooo,]
An' I would not[-a] been here, had not been for you,
[You] Treat me low-down an' dirty, [adady] daddy ,that's de way you
do."

begin to think about what I had done an' she [g] 'gin cryin' an'

[* "*Monkey-man," usually means a West-Indian Negro, but
for [For] L. B. it signifies a man who makes a fool
of himself about a woman who cares nothing for him.
"Money-woman" has the same meaning applied to the opposite sex.*]
