course of the procedure described, unfit drinking water may not have
been discovered and labelled such. The casual reader is very likely
to stop with the feeling that the only counter-action is that this ort
of thing is hard for [a great many] one man to imagine[,] (but apparently the civilian
public has a better imagination.)
                "RUMOR--Several soldiers at a camp near Philadelphia
                have died recently as the result of poisonous insecticide
                being mixed with their bread. At a lare
                replacement centre, poison has been found in the
                drinking water of soldiers.
                "FACT--Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Schoenfeld, commanding
                officer of induction [at] in Eastern Pennsylvania says:
                "'This, too, is one of the oldest rumors of this war,
                or of any other war. It seems obvious such rumors are
                being circulated by Axis sympathizers.
                "'In my 37 years' experience in the Regular Army, I
                cannot imagine either of these things happening. Rigid
                regulations are in force in the inspection of food and
                water for American soldiers. So stringent are these 
                regulations, that the soldier is given much more protection
                than the average civilian gets. Army laboratories,
                manned by trained scientists, are giving the
                soldier the best protection that can be had. These
                rumors are absolutely ridiculous."

        The next pair does not even try to answer the rumor. It starts
an argument that offers no fact and finishes it with what seems to be a
very low level of argument.
                "RUMOR--The country will be so upset by all this conversion
                to war industry that we'll never get back to normal."
                Intent: To make Americans dread the aftermath of war so
                much that they'll not fight well.
                "ANSWER--What would the rumormonger suggest? That we're
                so incapable of meeting domestic problems that it would
                be better right now to turn America over to the Japs and
                Germans?"

        Where would we stand if the reader were inclined to say "yes"
in answer to the last question, or if the reader believed that there might
be some minor advantage to certain types of change?
