Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am very sorry that my delay in answering your letter should have
caused you any anxiety. As you know, any order for crating and shipping
must go through several departments thereby causing a delay. The machine
has been crated and is being shipped to you today, express prepaid. It
should be in Texas in a few days.

We sent Dr. Miller the requested information in August. He should 
have received it long ago. In case the list went astray, will you please
notify us so that we may send him a copy.

Regarding the song "The Man on the Flying Trapeze" the earliest edition
seems to be the first one listed below*. There seems to be some 
confusion as to the composer, as can be seen by comparing the cover title
and caption title of the second one on the list. Furthermore, Edward B.
Marks, in his book, "They All Sang" (New York, 1934, p. 232), refers to 
the song as an English one by "Lee" but gives no date. The year 1868, 
however, seems to be the year in which the song was first published.

Kindest regards to Mrs. Lomax, Allen and yourself,

Sincerely,
