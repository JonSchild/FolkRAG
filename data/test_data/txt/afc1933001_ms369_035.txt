When Brahms, the musical sophisticate of his day, the man whom his contemporaries 
called "cold and intellectual," could write a melody
as like some of the best of the German folk
tunes, he was more pleased than if he had just completed a new
symphony. He worshipped Schubert, who could toss of melodies almost
as fast as he could write. Now, surely no one will maintain that
Brahms' compositions are not full of good melodies, but his feeling
about his own compositions as against the simple national airs of Germany
indicates that there is an intrinsic difference here between
composed and folk music. That difference lies, I believe, mainly
in the different motivations that lie back of the two sorts of
creation; it can best be expressed in terms like these -- desire
for originality as against desire for satisfaction. The melody
is the meat of a piece of music and the variations of it and the 
harmonizations are its sauce. The folk-singer is mainly interested
in a good bellyful of melody, not in newness or in tricks or clever
inventions. He doesn't mind repititions of the same melody
without cease in the course of a long ballad. He has no objections 
to using a tune for several different songs or ballads,
so long as it is a good tune, that sounds as good in the morning 
when he starts work as in the evening when he knocks off. This 
characteristic of folk-melody -- that it is full of substance and
satisfying and easy to remember -- marks it off from
thoughtfully composed music. We cannot suppose that
Brahms, who was a musical genius, was much less talented
than his predecessors in musical composition. And thus we cannot 
supposed that folk-tunes were written at an early date by some
