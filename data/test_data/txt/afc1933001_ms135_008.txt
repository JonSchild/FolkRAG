Dear Dr. Brown:

The Archive of American Folk Song is planning
for this summer a rapid recording survey of folk music
in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. This work
is to be done by a modern field recording machine,
with the idea in mind of getting down in the most
accurate fashion the folk tunes and the folk styles
of the region, for preservation and scholarly study.

We naturally look forward to collaboration
with the folk song scholars in the fields where our
work is being carried out. Mrs. Sidney Robertson
has told me of your interest in the field of Wisconsin
folk music and I feel sure that you have valuable
suggestions to give me in regard to interesting regions
and informants.

I would greatly appreciate whatever advice
you will be able to give me and if that amounts to
actually recording songs already collected by you,
a plan of restriction on the material can easily be
worked out until such time as you have published the
results of your research. I look forward to hearing
from you.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
