The [?Muckin] o Geordie's Byre       Hamish H. 11, 1

1. In lyrical craft ayout the hill
Just round the [?riodls] by Strathey's mill
Tryin a his life the time to kill
Was Georgie Mc Intyre
He had a wife as sweet as himself
And a daughter as blads as old Nick in Hell
There was plenty o' fun awa' at this mill
At the [?muckin] o' Geordie's byre

There grape was fruit the berom was tall
The barrow it would na Rowe its lane
An nich an a nicht there never [*me*] was seen
At the [*the*] [muckin] o Geordie's byre

3)  The boar he lept the midden dyke
And o' er the wa' wi Geordie's tyke
The baith fell into the bumbie's byke
At the [?nuichin] o Geordie's byre
Two cocks + hens began to crow
When Biddy astride the sow they saw
The paty [*shat*] he ran awa
At the [muckin] o Geordie's byre.

Already in collection when [?] wa Born -
from the highlands of Kinhard[?]
Hamish H's note on this + on Bothey is good.
