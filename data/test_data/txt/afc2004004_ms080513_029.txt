There - some rough boys came in over the
mountains one weekend, and, and cussed and
tore the place up and made trouble, and so
her son said:  Don't come back next weekend.
So they did and he was ready for them, and
he shot them, and he was not tried, because 
everybody knew that they'd come asking for
trouble and they got it.  But the dance had
died. 

Well, um . . . what happens socially was really
fascinating.  The dance . . . was moribund for a 
time, and then it began to take place at dance - 
at festivals, at folk festivals, and there
was a big crowd, maybe several hundred people,
and naturally there was a, there was an
officer of the law, the local sherrif, came 
just to mak - make sure that, thatnothing
untoward took place, that ah, nobody got drunk
and made un - unpleasantness.  So there was
- there was the law walking around.  So they
could have all the dancing they wanted. 

But it wasn't quite the old social dance, you
see.  There's somebody up on the stage doing
it.  [*[*] So exhibition dancing became the thing.
