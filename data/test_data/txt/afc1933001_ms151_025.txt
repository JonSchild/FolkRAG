Mr. W. V. Braley
Medina, Texas

Dear Mr. Braley:
     We have no means of making
duplicates in the Library of Congress.
If your record is copied,
it will have to be done by a commercial
recording company outside 
the Library building. This costs
between $1.25 and $1.50 per twelve-
inch record.
     If you are interested in
having this done at this cost, 
let me know and I shall try to 
arrange a cut-out as soon as possible.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
