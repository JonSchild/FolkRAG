Air Raid Warden:  "For incendiary
bombs you should have two buckets
of sand and a long-handled
shovel."
Housewife:  "But what if it
happens to be a high explosive
bomb?"
Warden:  "You won't need the
sand then."

When the Sergeant asked the 
Private why he always took a
bicycle to bed with him.  The 
Private told him that he didn't
like to walk in his sleep.

The Private's friend asked
him why he always went to
bed with socks on.  He looked
up and replied, "I don't 
like to smell defeat."
