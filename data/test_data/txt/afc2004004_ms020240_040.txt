maids, this, ah, ah, same child I heard from today, her sister,
Louise, he told them, the two to go up there.  He didn' tell none
of the white folks, jus told them, Said, "I'm jus' gonna [tell] show ya -- I'm gonna show
ya how she act."
An' have them right there an' she (limped ?) an' all herself
out.  She was wusser that day than she had ever been.  An' all
kinda things.  He goes to put the, the meal right by the thing.
Act like, like, just like he always act, an' all.  An' she called
'im an' pulled on 'is coat.  He said, "I told you about pullin'
on me."  Said, "Don't you pull on me."  An' so, said, "How many
times mus' I tell you -- Do you wanna git me killed?"
"You's a fool.  You ain't got no sense...you don't know this..."  You know, wh-what
she could do for 'im.  All kinda things.  "My home ain't here.  I
ain' no need for them crackers."  An' all like that, you know.

you know, or sumpin' like that.  Yessir.
An' she left.  She checked out. Yessir.  She checked out on
her own self.  Nobody ain' never had no more to say about it.
None of the white folks in the hotel.  We didn' say nothin' about
it t-ta none of 'em.  After she left, was no need, ya know.  Yessir,
she gone.  But Frank said if she hadn't left, he was gonna leave.
That whole habit:  "Why Frank couldn't bring it?  When's Frank 
bringin' it?"  Ya see, that's pickin' at somebody.  [Well, ya know,]
