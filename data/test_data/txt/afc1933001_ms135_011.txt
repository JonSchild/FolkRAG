Mr. Doyle Joyce,
WPA Writers Project,
Vincennes, Indiana.

Dear Mr. Joyce:

I have recently written to Mr. Myers, asking for a
complete copy of the Vincennes material for deposit
in the Archives. In the meantime, I am having copied
certain of the songs that Mrs. Caney sang and I have
found that I have no French text for Mon Amour, sung
by Mrs. Caney, also by the WPA group.

If it is not too late, I would like to make one suggestion
about the Vincennes book; that is, use Mrs.
Caney's songs just a she sings them and print in
their entirety the texts that you have dug up in the
Vincennes files, for the purposes of comparison. In
that way you will show that Mrs. Caney's songs are
genuine folk songs in a process of change, and at the
same time lose nothing of the freshness of her very
interesting French dialect.

It is extremely important that her dialect be transcribed
accurately because it is the nearest thing to
Vincennes French that we have any specimen of today,
and as such stands as an important historical document.
I think I can interest the central office here in having
that done by a really competent scholar if you have
not already found one.

May I take this occasion to thank you for your efforts
in behalf of the Archive last spring. Mrs. Caney's
songs have proved a valuable contribution to American
folk-lore and you are to be thanked for endeavoring to
have them preserved.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
