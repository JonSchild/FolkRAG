Rumor: One of our operators eported to me a story told her by one of her
patrons, age 45.  The patron's son was home on leave from the Navy
and was surprised to find his home noticing a scarcity of meat and 
he repeated how the Navy that week had thrown overboard seven tons
of meat spoiled because not needed.

Rumor: One of our regular patrons, 45, told me that the tire shortage
was just government politics as Firestone was making 5000 tires 
a day -- and not half were the size for Army use.  The rest went 
to Government officials' friends.
