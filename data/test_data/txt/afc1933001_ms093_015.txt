Dear Mr. Lomax:

At the Music Educators Conference in Milwaukee I was very glad to have a chance
to talk with your son, Alan.  I also appreciated the fact that he said that you
had expected to hear from us concerning the list of songs you called to our
attention.  I certainly would have acknowledged the receipt of your letter, but
I had expected to combine the acknowledgement with some indications as to what
cowboy songs we had found useful.

We are collecting materials from many sources and are studying your list in the
cowboy field along with other American folk songs.  No final choice has been
made, and this accounts for the fact that I have not written you.  I wanted,
however, to let you know that we are studying this material and will come to a
decision as soon as possible.

Thanking you for your cooperation, I am

Sincerely yours,
Charles E. Griffith
Music Editor
