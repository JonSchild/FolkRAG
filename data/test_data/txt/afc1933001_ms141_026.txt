Gentlemen:

     There has been some delay in arranging
for the payment of the bill you sent me
some time ago covering equipment for the
Library of Congress recording machine.  The
matter has, however, been approved recently
and you should receive payment within a 
month at the most.  I regret that the delay
has been so long.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
