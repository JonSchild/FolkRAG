Fisk, 22. 3.

That's the way we rock.

Shouting.

A: And waht does it mean, to shout? Does that mean to yell and make
a lot of noise?
W: Yessir. It's the way the Spirit moves you. If the Spirit moves
you to holler, you holler. And if the Spirit moves you to tap your
feet or pat your hands, you do that. A Spirit just comes to you now
and then and get fired up and talking with the Lord, and the Spirit
comes. . just now and then. Lot of them got to do something. You've
got to tap your feet and pat your hands or rock your hands or cry. If
you don't, you've either got to holler. Because they say you can't
hold it.
A: Did you ever see anybody walk the benches, Arnie?
W: Walk the benches? I seen folks fall over the benches (laughter).
They'd just fall across, they're so happy. They happy.
A: Do you think folks put it on about being happy?
W: Oh well now, I couldn't say. I know some folks shout from their
hearts, but I couldn't say they put it on. I couldn't say they give
up. See, they could say the same thing about me when I get that-a-way,
see. They could say I was fooling, but I don't never get
foolish. Everybody that stand on the other leg would say everybody
stand on the lecture leg. I'm talking about the old folks. I don't 
have any truck with the young folks (laughter). I know the old folks
come here talking about the other folks. You be talking about us,
and we ain't old (laughter).
A: Well, let's go back and sing some ring songs.
You all come back and sing some ring things-- do you know any
ring songs?
