In New York, a Porto Rican woman told me that sombody done me
some harm in New York and they done it all right.  She told me I
would lose everything I had and I did.  She told me I would lose
my Lincoln and it was stolen in three weeks.  Didn't even put
the thief in jail after they found him.

Porto Rican woman said she wasn't a fortune teller--had a translator
speak for her.  If you wanted somebody killed, you deposited
your money in the bank and in ten days, she would collect the
money.  You get the finest meat money can buy--embalm it.  Wrap
it up and tie it with a lot of strings.  Throw it in a desolated
section.  In nine or ten days, this meat decays and as meat decays,
enemy would be dying.  If the person is not dead, you don't owe
her anything.  I really never had no belief in this thing.
