Fisk, 9. 3.
(laughter) So the preacher, he jumped out the window, jumped out the
back window (laughter).

Sweet Peter (Werewolf)
Buch Asa.
That's a wolf -- that really is -- a wolf or something. That's as
far as I can go.
A: Is Fustin' Tom a wolf?
B: Uh-uh. Supposed to be something like a dog. You see, they go around
the country and kill dog, kill dog, a bunch of dogs here and a
bunch of dogs a few hours up there. Well, he come here and before
I could get outdoors, he done kill mine and set on [ours] yours. They
call him Sweet Peter. Nobody could never catch him.
A: Did you know of any case of Sweet Peters actually appearing in the
country?
B: Not yet. I heard about it.
A: Did you ever hear about axe-men or such things as that?
B: Axe-men?
A: I think there are a lot of stoires about the axe-men. What's that,
Louie? I never heard about that?

The Preacher Fooled.
Buch Asa.
He'd always put up with. He had a right young wife. Naturally he had
praise about her, the preacher would, you know. And every time this
boy would go out, you know, every time the preacher was there, you
know, the boy would go out to cut wood or catch a chicken or something,
well, this preacher would beat this girl's door and he'd beg for her to
come in. "Come in, honey, come in." "Get a down, Reverend," Say, Get
a down." Say, "I'm gonna set my husband on ou." "Oh, no, don't
do that; don't do that. You should be ahsamed of yourself."
So the preacher kept aworryin her, aworryin, aworryin, aworryin, you
know. He didn't tell her he wanted her.
