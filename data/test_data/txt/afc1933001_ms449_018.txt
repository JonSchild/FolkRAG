1st verse
Well, you ask for a story, here's one that I know,
Of a horse that I owed out in New Mexico.
Of the scouts that were sent out we never could hear,
The Indians on the warpath were something to fear.
Till the captain sadd,  "Boys, someone must go,
For help from the borders of New Mexico."
Sixteen brave cowboys straightway answered xxxxz, "Here,"
But the captain saw me I was comin' quite near. 
My pony beside me, his nose in my hand,
The captain said you've the best horse in the land. 
He's swift as an antelope and as fleet as a deer, 
On the back of that mustang you've nothing to fear.
They all shook my hand and wished me god speed,
As I rode from the fort on the back of my steedx.
Plattonio struck a trot and kept it all night,
Till out in the East it was beginning to light.
Then out of the distance there rose a wild yell,
The Indians on the warpath were hot on my tzzil.
I rose in my stirrups and stroked his dark main,
I jingled the bridle and called him by name.
*****
And after a few days Plattonio was well,
And of his death long after you'll neve r hear tell.
(He didn't like to hear about his horse's death, didn't like
to talk about it.)
