Man:   Because you got a large variety. .  you got sweets, you
got salads, cakes. . . . Is this your grand boy?  He's a
fine looking grand boy.

Woman:   It sure is, it's my great-grandson.

Man?   Great grandson? . . . Who cooked that cake he's making
a picture of?  Gladys?  You see there's about 6 sisters
of the W.E. Wallace family that are big supporters of this
singing plus the McGraw girls and the Aikens and the
Reddings. See, its not just one family that brings it--
several of them participate.

AL:   I think it would be good if one of the ladies named
every single dish. . . not too fast.

Woman:   This is chicken pot pie, egg pie, sweet potato
souffle, red babbit cake, corn, biscuit, baked chicken,
deviled eggs, potato salad, green peas, fried chicken
livers, and pound cake.  Baked beans.  Angel food cake.
Chicken pot pie.  This is French coconut pie, chocolate cake,
meat loaf, rolls, potato salad, that's some kind of
casserole. . . . this is French salad, and this is corn
casserole.  That looks like steak.  That's green bean
casserole, tht's macaroni and cheese.

Man:   We gotta sample some of all this. . . if we don't finish
will you bring it back tomorrow?   I don't blame you-- the
cost of groceries today. . . . . . . .Her and her family, yeah.
