Leadbelly 128-147

400 East 34th St.,
Austin, Texas,
April 20, 1935.

Mr. Oliver Strunk,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Strunk,
I have written to Frank Megill asking him to send three or four
of Lead Belly's records to Dr. Herzog. Dr. Herzog has not yet
heard these records, which were made on the prison camp before
Lead Belly's rise to fame. I felt when I listened to them at the
Library that they represented a very different Lead Belly, both
as to manner of singing and voice techniques.  I feel that Dr. Herzog
should hear them before he gives his final word about Lead Belly
and his songs in his musical preface. I hope that you will see fit t
to allow these records, which I have described carefully to Mr.
Megill, to be sent to Dr. Herzog at Yale. He will. of course, take t
the best care of them and return them at once as he is done with
them.
I am sorry I was not able to stay in Washington and get the  x diminutive
archive in somewhat better shape. I hope I shall be able
to get around to that job at the end of the summer. Will a [?] stenographer
be provided me?
With best regards to yourself and Mrs. Strunk, I am,
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
