For any man who weds my girl, for he'll get gold quite free,
For although she's lost her maidenhead, o whit the whaur is she.

Lomax: Do you think that's as good a way as any to begin a love affair.
Jean: Well, they did in olden days apparently, because the Laird
od the Dentidoonbye - when he passed this girl, he had his eye
on her, he was in love with her, of course. And well, the actual
thing - if they took advantage of the girl, she'd. . . .
Lomax: But have you heard of actual cases like this, in our times,
when women were laid by a man and fell in love with him after?
Jean: No, I don't think it happens so much now.

Lord Lovett:
1) Lord Lovett he stands at his stable door,
He was brushing his milk steed down,
When who passed by but Lady Nancy Belle,
She was wishing her lover God speed,
She was wishing her lover God speed.

2) "O where are you going, Lord Lovatt?" she said,
"Come promise tell me true."
"Over the sea strange countries to see,
But Lady Nancy Belle, I'll come and see you. (2)

3) He had been away a year or two,
But he scarcely had been three,
When a mightiful dream come into his head,
"Lady Nancy Belle, I'll come and see you." (2)

4) But he passed down through the village town,
And down toMary's Hall.
And the ladies were all weeping sore,
And the ladies were all weeping sore.

5) "Who is dead?" Lord Lovatt he said,
"Come promise tell me true."
"Lady Nancy Brlle died for her true lover's sake,
And Lord Lovat, there was his name" (2)

6) He ordered thecoffin to be opened up,
And the white sheets rolled down.
He kissed her on the cold clay lips,
Andthe tears came trinkling down. (2)
