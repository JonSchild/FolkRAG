Gentlemen:
"I have seen several articles in your paper dealing
on various phases of the Army mess. In a great many instances
about 'enlisted men's mess.'' but my experience
serves to confirm the above rumor. 
"I feel that I am better qualified to judge mess
condition than an officer who eats with us possibly
twice a week. The food is probably all right before it
falls into the hands of the cooks, but from that point
on things start to happen. Most of the cooks could not 
qualify for a hamburg stand in the vicinity of the Barbary 
Coast (Phila.). Filth predominates. Brushes are
used to scrub floors one moment and dishes the next. 
Pitchers are used for many purposes for which they were
not originally intended. 
"I have seen dishes and cups cracked and nicked - 
yet we still use them. Last night for a beverage - a 
can of tomato juice was dumped into a barrel of water.
"There have been times when the amount of food
wanted would feel 50 people - if they could eat it. 
Frankly I eat in the mess hall less than 50% of my meals"
Yours very truly, 

This is the way it was dealt with in the rumor-combatting
column of the paper:
"RUMOR - - Several soldiers at a camp near Philadelphia
have died recently as the result of poisons insecticide 
being mixed with their bread. At a large
replacement centre, poison has been found in the 
drinking water of soldiers.
