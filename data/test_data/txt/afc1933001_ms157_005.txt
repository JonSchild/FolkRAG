Letter dated April 29 from
E. O. Holland, President
The State College of Washington
Pullman, Washington

   President Holland's expression of interest is very
encouraging indeed.  Our present plans do not call for
state depositories and before we designate any institution,
we must investigate local conditions very carefully.
It might be a good idea to ask Mr. Holland if he
has any suggestions as to the type of recordings which
we should issue at the start.  I believe that our first
products should be planned to fill existing gaps in the
material now available.
