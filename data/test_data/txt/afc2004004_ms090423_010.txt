Is this general statement also true of the Delta? In the following 
pages answers are given to this question on the basis of 
empirical investigation.

In the past, the church in the Delta was irrefutably the center 
of Negro life and there was a unified attitude toward the church. 
Religious emotions, whatever form they assumed, were part of the 
Negro's life and personality. So compelling was the desire to express 
their religious emotion, the people came together wherever they could: 
they assembled in the seed house, in the barns, on the levees, and in 
any other available buildings on the plantation. Recalling the past, 
one informant says:

Way back yonder, the atmosphere of things was very low, and 
churches for Negroes was very few. I remembers when we used to 
have church. Folks didn't call it church, most everybody 
called it a "meeting". We used to have meetings in the seed 
house, and the women really did shout. 5.

At present there is a duality of attitudes toward the church and 
minister on the plantation and they are coming more and more to the 
surface. There is a growing "pervasive skepticism of the pretensiveness 
of the church" 6. among the Negroes on the plantation. All of 
these changes are clearly manifested in the declining authority of the 
church and the minister and, in the growing disinterested attitudes 
of the plantation youth toward things religious and sacred.

Statistical evidences bear this point out: Twenty out of the one 
hundred families reported that they belonged to no church and not all
