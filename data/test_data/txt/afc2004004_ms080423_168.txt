Time Code Tape: 38   R Hicks & Friends
Two boys went afishin'
One bright sunny day,
They saw . . . body
Go floatin' away.
They threw the net around her
And . . . to the bank,
Her clothes all wet and muddy,
They laid her on a plank.
They sent for John . . .
To come to that place,
They turned her over
So he could see her face.
But no confession
Would he make.
They picked him up
And they put him in jail,
No friends or relations
Could go on his bail.
AL:  That's a true story isn't it?
HP:  I think all of them songs, everyone--I know, I believe, every
one is true stories . . . My Daddy sang 'em, and all the
old people . . . they just see'd that or heared it, then
they just, didn't have no other writin', nobody . . .
back then and they just made a song--
