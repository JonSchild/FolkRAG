Tape:  1311 cont.  Octa Clarke and Dion
that barber, I'll give him a shave.  And he got a razor. . .
you know they had those long razors. . . . .he took off with the
apron on his back, but he left out of here.  And we have never
seen him around here.  They'd a killed him.  Those days, what
you call revenge, was to kill him.  A man knows a family,
what you said, they'll kill you.  That's the way it goes. . . .
and he'd have got killed so he moved away from here.
AL:  I understand they used to take the end of a handkerchief
and have a real fight. . .
Octa:  Yeah, it happened sometimes.  Give the handkerchief,
both catch it and they fight.
Dion:  That was years and years ago.
Octa:  The best man keep the handkerchief.
AL:  Have you ever seen anything like that?
Octa:  No, not me.  I don't want to see something like that.
AL:  I talked to a man up in Eunice who said he did that. . . . 
Killed a man. . . . I don't know.
Dion:  Well, I know in Eunice and those places, they really 
had tough fights like that.  Just like you said, Marie Bouleur
what do they call it down there, Bosco (?) That's they way they
played.
AL:  That's where the Bosco stomp happened huh?
Octa:  Maybe.
AL:  Is that what Bosco means, just the name of a place/?
