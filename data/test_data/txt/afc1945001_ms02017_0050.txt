Rumor Report Due October 10

Attached is our report on rumors due in your office
October 10th.

This office was being moved to new quarters in another
building on October 5th and 6th. The report on Obstacles to
the War Effort was delayed and, in addition hindered work on
the collection of rumors, consequently we were not able to

2. Clearer understanding of what
constitutes a rumor,

3. More practice at collecting rumors.

We believe these hindrances can be remedied through
additional explanation and work by this office. The results
were we must admit disappointing.

The Chamber of Commerce Secretary, after accepting the
assignment, went out of the city without advising us. The policeman
selected simply reported he "hadn't heard any rumors". The labor
union official said he "had not had time to write down the rumors
and could not recall any that satisfied the definition".

All of the contacts expressed interest and wished to
continue collecting rumors.

The majority believed they could be more effective by
gathering the rumors during a specified week from time to time
rather than for one day at a time. None made the complaint,
but we feel continuous collection may prove burdensome to the
