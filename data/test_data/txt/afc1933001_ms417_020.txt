CONCERNING JOHN HANDCOX

Who is John Handcox?  Where is he now?

Back five and six years ago, when the Southern
Tenant Farmers' Union was sweeping the south, John
was sharecropping in Arkansas.  He was a Negro, and
also a preacher, and when the union came his way he realized
here was something that was fighting for heaven on earth,
and fighting for unity of black and white.

So he became an organizer for the STFU, and went up
and down the countrysides, preaching to his people.  He
turned churches into meeting halls, and they used
to make the old boards shake with old time spirituals,
and the new words he put to them.

Finally the landlords got together and told
him if he didn't leave Arkansas they'd kill him.  So
he had to leave his wife and kids behind, and he went
Missouri.  Then pretty soon he left there for Oklahoma.
Now he can't be located.  Where is John Handcox?
