husband had had his 44 in his pocket. He had pure neglected to 
bring it. Again, no longer than two nights ago, I had to offer 
to fight ten young bullies one after another if they would not 
stop their racket. The racket was making recording in the hotel 
impossible and the proprietor would do nothing about it. For some 
reason, perhaps because they did not know what weapons agents 
of the Library of Congress carried, they wandered away before my 
boastful threat and left me uneasy victor in an empty hotel lobby.

Do not suppose, however, that all my adventures are like 
this. Most of one's encounters here 
in Kentucky are as pleasant as one could well imagine. Everywhere 
you go you are invited to spend the night and forced to eat a 
meal. Indeed, on account of the fact that one cannot establish any 
sort of impersonal relationship with these people, it is difficult 
to collect songs quickly.  . . . Count Oct. 16, 1937, 156..

I do not quite understand the letter about the Cosmos club. 
What is this metaphysical organization? Do they want a lecture on 
the influence of the dichotomy on European philosophy or what? Are 
they above the mention of money? And was your letter intended to 
show me that the Library wanted me very much to make a talk to the 
Cosmos Club or were you merely enthusiastic?

Today is the first day in some time that I have felt able to 
write anything. I shall work on the report and get it off to you 
either today or tomorrow by airmail.

Please send fifty records and three dozen needles to 
West Liberty, Ky., General Delivery. I am sorry if I have caused you 
anxiety, but I have had more on my shoulders this last week than 
I was designed to carry.
