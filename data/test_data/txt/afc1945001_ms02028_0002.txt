REPORT ON RUMORS
(Requested August 5, 1942)

(1) The British. "The British won't fight." "The English [*2*]
did not put on even a good show in Greece, in Crete, in Malay."
"We hear of New Zealanders and South Africans fighting in Libya. 
What are the British doing?" "Where is the British army?" 
These statements are heard both in Ames and in Des Moines with
more or less variation. They were repeated by members of the 
lower middle class, such as bank clerks, etc.

(2) The treatment of Japanese and German prisoners. "The
Japanese are cutting off ears and tongues of prisoners; so are 
the Germans." "Messages have come from prisoners written under 
postage stamps." These were heard in a beauty parlor in Ames. 
It seems to me that I recall the same rumor in 1918. This was 
heard only a couple of times.

(3) Congress and the Administration. "Congress and the 
Administration are concerned more with politics than in winning 
the war." "They tell us to wake up, but they really need more 
understanding themselves." "What is the matter with the government 
anyway?" "Why don't they give up politics and get busy on 
the war." "The country is way ahead of Washington." "The President 
is more concerned with social reform than with winning the 
war."

Rumors along this line were heard both in Des Moines and 
in Ames over and over again, far more so than all other rumors. 
Great dissatisfaction was expressed. There was reaction to [*3*]
the announcement from OWI last week. "We people know there is
a war. Why doesn't OWI tell it to Washington?"

These rumors - I don't know whether they could be classified 
as rumors - were undoubtedly inspired by cartoons of 
"Ding" in the Des Moines Register. I am enclosing two of them. 
This topic was a quite general subject of conversation among
individuals I met both in Ames and Des Moines. Some of these 
people came from over the state and do not live in these two 
cities.

(4) Politics. See (3) above.

In addition: "The army is full of politics." "Officers 
who receive unwelcome assignments telephone their senators."  [*1-*]
"The Administration is interferring with the work of the army 
by making promotions not recommended."
