Dear Dr. Botkin:

Elizabeth Lomax tells me that she thinks
the Folk Song Archive is releasing some more records for
public consumption. Is this the case? And if so, will
you send us whatever publicity folders you may have gotten
out on the subject? I am particularly interested in the
rumour that you are pressing some Sacred Harp songs. 

Will you let me know about this at your
convenience? I am sorry to be bothering you so much
these days. 

Sincerely,
Bess Lomax
Music Division
