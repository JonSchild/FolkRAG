Vera Hall,  reel  10,  page 3 . . . 

[*Doctor stopped
her from
singing out
of books.*]

sing about-"I Know the Lord Will Make a Way"- I don't know it
all, but they heps me out.  See, I haven't been readin in two
years.  The doctor stopped me from readin.  Told me not to read
on account of this catarac over my eye , not to look at nothin
deathless(definite?) -- nothin really deathless that I'll have
to really see what it was so I won't never strain my eyes up---
and he would just ruther for me to not read-- said"Just you 
don't read at all, says, because you gon try to see what it 
is and that's gainst you ." An-uh, so  she does the readin for
me and she does the bigges of the readin for all of um.  And then
when I start if off sumpin about how the Lord will make a way
for us, yes he will, and nuther song-- sumpin bout the Woodden 
Church on the Hill--It go kinda like this--- 

It was in my childhood, it was many years ago
And the spirit of thee I was filled
There was no forms or fashions
just thee with spirit filled
In that little wooden church upon the hill . . . 

There was no well dressed people,
Just plain folks everywhere,
They wore just plain old ruffles and frocks and frills
There was no forms nor fashions
Just plain old spirit filled
In that little  wooden church upon the hill . . . 

I want to learn all that so bad  that I don't know what to
do.A:  That's pretty.  V:  It is pretty and I like it. (390)
