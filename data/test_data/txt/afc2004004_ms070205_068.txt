Here's to the made that's dressed
in black
Always neat and never slack
When she kisses kisses sweet
And make things stand that
have no feet.
-----
Here's to our Amer eagle, our high
& lofty bird
That flies all over all the U.S
And in Can drops a turd
Here's to good old Canada
With her soil so fertile & rich
We need no turd from your
Amer bird
You bald headed son of a
bitch.
