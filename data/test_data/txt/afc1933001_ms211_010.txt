"The Strawberry Roan" is in a collection
edited by Curley W. Fletcher, who
claims to have written "The Strawberry
Roan." The copyrights are
claimed by some Chicago publishers
(I sent you MacMillans 
letter giving the names), and the
same outfit, after exacting
money damages, now demand
that the songs be excluded
from both books. I
have written to Fletcher who gave
me special permission to reprint
"The Strawberry Roan." Read my
story about both songs as
printed in the revised "Cowboy
Songs" and you will see
that I have not been careless.
