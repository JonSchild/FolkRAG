Food is going up. A dress I bought seems to be out of line;
the storekeepers are "snitching" on price ceilings. They will get around
them somehow.

England is letting us all down because she does not want to do
anything. She does not want to start a second front nor give India her [*2*]
independence.

Defense workers are given too much money. Some are making as
high as $90 a week; they don't deserve that kind of money. [*7a*]
Grocer, Osseo, 8/11

Why should defense workers get so much money. They are the ones
that would not take a job before the war; they would rather set home and [*7a*]
let the town support them.
Farmer, Osseo, 8/11

I know a man and wife who both have defense jobs and who have a [*7a*]
child and they spend their money in beer parlors. They don't pay their bills 
nor take care of their child. Defense workers are not entitled to the high
wages they are getting.
Farmer's Wife, Osseo, 8/11

We are going to get rationing of all kinds after the election.
Farm Hand, Osseo, 8/11

The Government is taking farm help away from us through the draft [*1*]
and we cannot produce the Food for Victory that the Government wants.
