Clyde L. Barr Article
Boosts "Home On The
Range" For State Song
---
The following communication
from Clyde L. Barr of the University
of Arkansas and former
Gaylord resident will be of interest
to all Pioneer readers, particularly
at this time when there
is a move, sponsored by the Commonwealth
Club of Wichita, to
make "Home On The Range" the
official state song of Kansas. The
Pioneer is grateful to Mr. Barr
for his contribution and hopes
that the article will recall pleasant
memories to its many pioneer 
readers, wherever they may
be.
Fayetteville, Ark., March 10,
1946.--My Dear Editor: I desire
to send in--to my good old Gaylord
friends and relatives and to
all Smith County pioneers, an
interesting report of a very rare
and unusual gathering at Mr. and
Mrs. Rosh Hagadorn's ranch in
the Ozarks near Bentonville, Ark.,
March 3, 1946. It has been over
fifty years since Rosh and I have
seen or heard tell of each other.

I include an open letter to all
Smith County pioneers wherever
they may be. I believe hundreds
of Smith County Pioneer readers
will enjoy reading and having
this interesting report (document)
of pioneer events that is so close
to their very hearts and souls.

I hope you can find time and
space to publish it. I am sure our
old friends will proclaim it as 
very pleasant and happy news
indeed.

"Give my regards to [illegible]-
ley, it has been over fifty years
since I have seen him.

Respectfully yours.--Clyde L.
Barr, University of Arkansas Experiment
Farm, Route 6, Fayetteville,
Arkansas.

An open letter to my old time 
Gaylord friends and to all Smith 
County pioneers wherever they 
may be.

"Ye Old Time Memories
FIfty years ago in old Gaylord
The sacred home of the 
"Home On The Range."

(Note: Lest there should be
some misunderstanding concerning
the above question, the song, 
"Home On The Range" was written
by Dr. Brewster Higley when he
lived on his homestead on the 
banks of the Beaver about 8 1/2 
miles north and 3/4 west of the
town of Athol. He later took the
words to Dan Kelley, who lived
down on the Solomon, and there
the music was composed by Mr. 
Kelley and was first played by 
the Harlan Brothers' Orchestra.
A portion of the Higley cabin still
stands on the banks of the Beaver 
and a number of distant relatives 
of Dr. Higley still live in the 
county.)

My Dear Gaylord Friends: On
March 3, 1946 a small group of
Arkansas hill-billies down in the
beautiful Ozarks near Bentonville, 
Ark. met for the first time
in fifty years and talke dover old
times in Gaylord. It was a day of
joy and happiness. We desire to
share it with you.

If Bert Headley is in town call
him in and ask him to put on his
specks and read this one.

A short time ago an article appeared
in the Smith County Pioneer
that read something like 
this. Going to Arkansas eleven
years ago because he could make
a living without work, Rosh Hagadorn
came back last week to the
haunts of his boyhood days in the
Solomon valley for a short visit
with relatives and friends. This
reporter and Rosh were kids together
some fifty years ago, and 
when the two old codgers got together
in this shop last press day
there was really an old fashioned 
gabfest with many interesting 
events recalled. Rosh now makes
his home on a small ranch near
Bentonville and thinks Arkansas
is an ideal place for a person who
has only a speaking acquaintance
with work. Mars. Hagadorn, who


in the car and hit out for Hagadorn's.
It was not long until we
had our feet on the small ranch
near Bentonville where ROsh
makes his living without work.
This was the first time we had
seen or heard tell of each other
for over fifty years. No! we weren't
mad at each other. No! it wasn't 
that, that caused us to be, not on
speaking terms for over fifty 
years. My friends, you all know
that Old Mother Nature has a
peculiar way of shuffling us human
beings around and scattering 
us out all over this great land
of the brave and the free. So,
somehow Rosh and I got lost in
the shuffle. Through the law of
cycles, fate and destiny we were
brought back into the family circle.
Well, we soon made up for 
lost time. We set the old clock
back fifty years and started in to 
visit the old pioneer way. Rosh
pulled out several ancient photographs
and boxes and with what
[illegible] along with me I believe we
found a picture of almost every 
person that lived in Gaylord at
that time (1896). Most of these
photographs were over fifty years
old.

We laughed and talked about 
our boyhood days with "Shelbark'
Headley, 'Shirttail' DIckey, them
old Hagadorn boys, Bill McNary,
and all the gang. We were proud
of our school day degrees in 'reading,
writing and arithmetic, taught
to the tune of a hickory stick,' 
wielded by the hand of Laura 
Lenau (hello, Laura, best wishes
to you).

We gathered at the old skating 
rink, took in the old medicine
show, looked over the old stuffed
birds and animals in the old Lewellen
Drug store, and stood for 
hours listening to Webb McNall
orate some political question down
in Gilman grove. In our memory
roving we attended a mind reading
and table-moving demonstration
in the home of Mr. and Mrs. A. J. 
Ream, and as near as I can remember
the old dining table 
leaped six feet in the air, turned 
around three and one-half times,
came down and lit on one leg and 
stood in that position for 27 minutes
--believe it or not.

We talked about politics, that 
took us back fifty years (1886), 
when William McKinley came out
with his full dinner pail and
William J. Bryan was running on 
some 16 to 1 scheme. Most of the
people living in Gaylord at that
time hadn't seen a silver dollar
for so long--they had forgotten
what it looked like. It was at this 
time my old dad, George D. Barr, 
set my brother, Vern, now living
in Orlando, Fla., and myself on
the front gate posts and told us
to holla for Bryan and Sewell--
and did ewe shout. On every corner
in town came howls for McKinley 
and Holbert. I guess we were the 
only democrats in town. McKinley 
was elected. Soon after this
happened, my dad figured that
with four kids to feed he better 
set out in search for McKinley's 
full dinner pail. So we, Barrs, left 
old Gaylord just fifty years ago. 
I never have been back to this
day. I hope you will enjoy my
letter. 

Yes, friends, we are still looking
for this full dinner pail. It
has been a happy and interesting


journey. We, like the old Smith
County pioneers, have learned to
take the bitter with the sweet. We
have had many beautiful experiences
and made many friends
everywhere in the land.

By this time Rosh and I heard
quite a bit of commotion in the 
dining room. Five times Mrs. Hagadorn
called to us to come to 
dinner. We just kept on talking.
When we entered the dining
room, Mrs. Hagadorn said to me,
"Clyde, don't you think this old
dining table was in your father's 
furniture store back in Gaylord
fifty years ago?"  I told her I was 
not quite sure about it, but I 
would hae some FBI agents make an investigation to see if
George D. Barr didn't sell this old
table to Nate [?] fifty years
ago. I told Mrs. Hagerdorn I was 
more interested in what was on
the table that in the history of it,
at the moment: my two sons and
daughter thought much the same
way about it, so we all settled 
down to a [illegible] feast. No one 
would ever believe that there had
been a space of fifty long years
since he had seen each other.

After dinner we all went into 
the living room and in a few minutes
the curtain went up on one 
of the sweetest and most beautiful
western Kansas dramas ever 
acted in real life. This drama was 
an imaginary reproduction of
pioneer life and events that really 
took place in Smith County 75 
years ago.

The time--1871-85.
The place--"Home On The Range"
The girl--Virginia Harlan Barr
The leading leading lady of this beautiful
imaginary drama was none
other than my dear old mother, 
Virginia Harlan Barr. The name
of this grand old drama was the
"Home On The Range." Other
outstanding members of this
imaginary cast were my uncle 
Dan Kelley, my aunt Lulu Harlan
Kelley, my uncles, Cal and Eugene
Harlan and Brewster Higley,
author of "Home On The Range."

I took along with me a very 
precious little document entitled
"Reminiscences of Early Days in
Kansas," written by my dear old 
mother, Virginia Harlan Barr, in 
December, 1938, now living with 
her daughter, Fayle Lulu Barr, in
San Francisco, Calif. My mother, 
now 81 years old is the only living
member of the John C. Harlan
family. In this old Harlan home--
my mother's home--the music for
this grand old pioneer song "Home
On the Range," was composed by
Dan Kelley. This precious little
document is the very heart and 
soul of the grand old song "Home
on the Range." I have been instructed
to pass this important document 
on to my children (Beverley, age 
15, Vera June, 13, and William,
11), after I pass over the great 
divide. Their grandmother Barr
has told them this grand and exciting
story over and over again.
They will never forget it. The
history of "Home on the Range"
will remain in the Barr family 
many years to come. It is a sacred
part of our lives. That is why we
love it so.

Now we will go on with this
beautiful imaginary drama of the
early pioneer days in Kansas and


the old Smith County pioneers
that made history. My dear old
mother now brings these beautiful 
memories and pioneer events to 
all who love the history, the words 
and the music of the grand old
song, "Home on the Range". Mrs
Rosh Hagadorn and Mrs. Clyde L.
Barr took turns in reading this
beautiful, thrilling and interesting
story. They really put their heart
and soul into the task given them
and made every character and
event so vivid, so real, it was a 
beautiful picture to behold. Our
imaginations were so illuminated
with this marvelous picture passing
before our very eyes that for
the moment Rosh and I thought
that we were really setting in the
old John C. Harlan home back
in 1873, listening to my Uncle Dan
Kelley and my aunt Lulu, his
sweetheart, singing this grand old
song, "Home on the Range," accompanied
by Uncle Cal and
Eugene Harlan on the violin and
guitar. My dear old mother (nine
year old at the time) joined in on
the chorus, and what a chorus it
was.

"A home, a home,
Where the deer and the
antelope play;
Where never is heard
A discouraging word,
And the sky is not cloudy
all day.

This beautiful scene we just
passed through reminds me of a
very consoling statement in the
Bible. In my Father's house are
many mansions." Yes, mansions
of love, peace, harmony, friendship,
companionship, brotherly
love, genius, talent, music, art,
and romance. Yes, indeed, the
old John C. Harlan home was a
heavenly home with many mansions, 
blessings divine, a kingdom
of heaven on earth.

I will now give you a few lines
taken from "Reminiscences of
Early Days in Kansas," by Virginia
Harlan Barr.

"In the fall of 1871, my grandfather,
John C. Harlan, and family,
consisting of his wife, two sons,
Clarence and Eugene, his daughter,
Lulu, and myself, landed in
Smith County, Kansas. He and
his sons homesteaded a quarter
section of land, consisting of 480 
acres, about six miles from the 
little town of Gaylord (at Harlan).

"They first built a barn, and 
we lived in it until we got our
house built. Then our experiences
of what, at that time, was the far
west, began. Some of them were
very pleasant, and some of them
very bad. If people think they
are having a depression at the 
present time (1930's) they should
have seen what the homesteaders
of those times experienced through
floods, prairie fires, cyclones, dust
storms, drouths, grasshoppers and
poverty.

"Some people lost heart and returned
east, but the majority of
them remained. Time has taken
most of them anyway now, and in 
my own family, I am all that is
left. Some of the pleasant memories 
I have of those early days
are the good times we used to 
have.

"Our home was the largest in 
that part of the country--two large
rooms--and it was the only one
with a board floor, which was
made of wide cottonwood boards.

Because of this, and due to the
fact that my uncles were the only
musicians for miles around--they
played the violin and guitar--most
of the parties and dances and
taffy pulls and church services
were held at our house. It was
the center of attraction.

"My grandfather was probate
judge for eight years, and young 
people used to come from all over
the county to secure their marriage 
licenses, and get married.
I remember when my Uncle Dan
Kelley came courting my Aunt 
Lulu, she used to make a big 
dishpan full of popcorn balls, and
we would all sit around the fireplace
and eat popcorn, and talk, 
and sing.

"Uncle Dan used to sing the
song, called "The Western Home"
--lately changed to "Home on the
Range." He composed the music
way back in 1873.

"The main traveled road was
near our house. Often travelers
would stop, and if too cold, they 
would ask permission to bring
their bedding in and sleep on the
floor.

"One time, a man and his wife
came to our house, and after talking 
for a while, the lady walked
over to the corner where the 
guitar stood. Picking it up, she
asked if it didn't belong to Virgie
Harlan (my mother). We were 
dumfounded, and told her that 
it did. After explanations, it 
turned out that she was a schoolmate
of my mother's when they 
both lived in Indiana.

"When I was born, my mother 
died, and I was adopted by my
mother's parents (Judge John C.
Harlan) and I didn't seem to
thrive very well. When we moved
to Kansas, I was six years old, and
I was turned loose to get all the
sunshine and fresh air I could 
absorb. I guess I succeeded, for 
a am now 73 years old, and still 
going strong. (Today my mother 
is 81 years old, and still going 
strong).

Friends, I will give you the secret 
of my mother's long and
happy life taken from the grand
old song, "Home on the Range."

"The air is so clear,
The breeze so pure, 
The zephyr so balmy and light;
I would not exchange
My home here to range
Forever in azure so bright.

"I have a pleasant memory of
a friendship between a little girl
about my own age and myself.
She lived in Gaylord, about six
miles away. Her father, W. M.
Skinner, was one of the first county
officers, and if I remember
correctly her mother taught the
first school in Gaylord. Cora (Mrs 
A. J. Ream now living in Mt.
Washington, Mo., now a suburb of
Kansas City) and I were the only 
little girls in our community at 
that time. Cora's mother had a 
small organ, the only one for miles around, so when they
brought Cora down to our house
they brought the organ along.
And what a good time we would
have. Lulu would play the organ,
Eugene the violin and Clarence
would join in on the triangle.

"That friendship between Cora
and me started 67 years ago, and
is still going strong. (Today I am
happy to report, that friendship

is 75 years old and is still strong.)
Cora still has her little organ--
upstairs in a spare room. Sometimes
we go up there and play it,
just for old times sake, even
though the tones are not very musical,
and the bellows are rather 
wheezy. (One of the happiest moments
of my life was spent in this
little spare room listening to Cora
Ream and my mother sing and 
play the grand old song "Home
on the Range" on this little old
organ. This little old organ has
been reconditioned, refinished and 
is good for another hundred years.
It is a beautiful symbol of the 
beautiful pioneer life interlaced
with the history of the grand old
song, "Home on the Range.") It
was on that organ that I began 
my musical education-- such as 
it is.

"Christmas in those days wasn't 
like the present day holiday, when
children get more toys than they 
know what to do with. I remember
one Christmas, when the snow
was so deep, my people couldnt' 
get to Gaylord, six miles away to 
get me a stick of candy. My Aunt 
Lulu made me a rag doll, painted
a face on it with ink, put some 
buffalo hair on it, and I got as
much of a thrill out of it as if it
had been a real doll.

The settling up of Kansas was 
a great experience, and I have
always been glad that I had it. As
a fitting close to my story, and because
it definitely belogned to
those early days in Kansas, I am
going to conclude with the words 
of the song now know as "Home 
on the Range," but when written
originally was titled 'The Western 
Home"--words by Dr. Higley 
and music by Daniel Kelley, both
of Gaylord, Smith County, Kansas,
in 1873.

Oh, give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
Where the deer and the antelope
Play;
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word,
And the sky is not cloudy all
day.

Oh, give me the land
Where the bright diamond sand
Throws its light on the glittering
stream
Where glideth along
The graceful white swan
Like a maid in her heavenly 
dream.

How often at night 
When the heavens were bright
By the light of the twinkling stars;
Have I stood here amazed
And asked as I gazed
If their glory exceeds that of 
ours.

How sweet, how grand, how
beautiful, how divine.
'Twas a kingdom of heaven on 
earth.
Dr. Higley asked himself as
gazed into the heavens--
"If their glory exceeds that of 
ours."

Friends, this is only a part of 
the marvelous little story on the 
Early Days in Kansas and the
"Home on the Range," written by
my dear old mother, Virginia Harlan
Barr. I wish you all could have 
the opportunity to read and
possess this precious little jewel,
so you could keep this old pioneer 
record among your choice keepsakes.

Thirty typewritten pages of
exciting and interesting pioneer
events when the deer and the
antelope played, and about Smith
County pioneer men and women
who made Early Kansas History,
where the buffalo roam-ed, and
the sky was not cloudy all day.

Hair-raising experiences with
horseback riding.

Old 'Mike' the Harlan family 
horse, and 'Dime' (our dog) the
rattlesnake killer.

Thrilling buffalo chases.

Fourth of July picnics.

School days in my neighbor's
kitchen.

The old sod school house.

The Harlan family orchestra
and many other thrilling events 
are clearly outlined in the little
booklet.
