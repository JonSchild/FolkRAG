Dear Father:

     The Fisk recording job is going to be done, I believe,
more thoroughly and objectively than any that has yet
been done in the United States in any field by any recordist
At least if our outline is followed it will be.
Naturally, the Negro looks at the South with different eyes
than the white man, but it seems to me that while neither
point of view is exactly right, before a decision can be 
reached in a democracy both sides must be allowed to have
their say; and before the Negro will do the job right he
perhaps has to get things off his chest. However, this
recording project will not be a propaganda means for
anyone, but it is complete and well planned. I will send
you a copy of the outline sometime soon.
     Your suggestion about the book of children's songs
is perfectly  true, and if I had time for anything else
I'd take it. I am forwarding all of your enclosures to 
Bess, who, I hear by third hand, is having a good time in
New York. I'd like very much to hear the story of the
trial. The Tartt trip is still nearly pending. Harold is
almost impossible to see these days, and so on. I certainly
enjoy your eloquent letters.
My love to both you and Deanie,
Alan
