water, bowed over against the 
hills of Rasay the full auriole 
from violet to green, descending 
then again into the green water -- 
Charley saw this--
He also traveled the road with Flora Makeel - looking 
back over his shoulder to the 
jagged, old teeth of the mountains 
far North, looking back to 
the pines -- a needle of stone -- 
walking forward up the green 
Loch side with the hills rising 
steeply at his right hand -- and 
the road turning sharp back at
the end of the gorge, with a 
whitening torrent leping downhill 
over the black rocks-- and here 
the narrow brown roads winding 
South over the hills --
