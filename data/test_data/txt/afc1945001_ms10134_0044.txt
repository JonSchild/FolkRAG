There is an interesting tale told concerning
an unidentified woman and man
in California. Upon investigation it was
found that the former had about
nine hundred cans of canned vegetables
and such. When questioned on this
action she stated that she was on a special
diet, and had therefore collected these
so that they would be sufficient for her
to maintain her diet.
The man, however, having a number
also, claimed that he had been expecting
this rationing for years and had therefore
well stocked himself with these necessary
canned goods.
This was taken from the Evening Star.
Also taken from the Star was the
following saying -
Save a Life with a Knife.
