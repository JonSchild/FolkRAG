Some rumors contain verifiable facts and cannot be denied
without revealing facts which must remain unpublished [temporarily?] for reasons of military security. [For 
example,
the presence
of a
warship
in an
American
territory.]
[When a warship
is in an American harbor, for example, that fact cannot be published
without aiding the enemy—even though the ship and its sailors are visible
to many people in the port area. Extravagant rumors—about the
ship, crew, or cargo—may spring up in such a situation. It is an unavoidable
situation.] Rumor-control groups [Projects] can urge newspapers which print the information,
after enough time has elapsed, to emphasize why the facts had
to remain [be kept] unpublished and why the rumors had to remain unchallenged.
Rumor-control groups [Projects] can impress their communities with the fact that something known
to hundreds of people is not necessarily known to thousands of people;
and that the repetition of rumors—even those based upon a fact known to
the rumor-teller—makes it easier for the enemy to obtain military information. [to find out what he may
not know, or may simply suspect.]
DIRECT [REFUTATION] DENIAL OF RUMORS
While the major responsibility of a rumor-control project is
to fill information gaps and to conduct an educational campaign in [critical]
careful thinking, it [may] sometimes becomes necessary to [try direct counter-action, that is, refuting] refute specific rumors with specific information. This [particular device in rumor control has] involves many dangers, since it means [involves] giving
publicity to the rumor in an attempt to eliminate it. Unless the rumor
and its denial are [skillfully] presented with great care, much more harm [is done]
than good may result.
[Because direct counter-action is a new field,] The experience and surveys of the
Office of War Information [is here presented in the form of positive] lead to the following recommendations.
[Double

items]
1. [Rumor denial should only be done] The stating of a rumor and its denial should only be attempted in print; never over the
radio.
2. In general, deny only those rumors which can be denied
flatly and conclusively.
