and began writing -- wrote a long song over that, told about John Jacob Astor, you know, and how women refused to leave their husbands

A: It would be tome. Had you heard any other Titanicsongs before you wrote that one?
H: No sir, but after I wrote that one. other people began to write on 
the same thing, but they wrote different.
A  How did yours go? Sing me as much as you can remember of your 
Titanic song.
H: Well, I just can't remember it now.
A: You sang me a verse or two the other night.
H: Yes, but what I mean to say was if I ever came across one verse 
and think of that tune, you can make that.

Wasn't that might tume?
Wasn't that might time on the ocean,
When the T tanic vessel went down?

If you'll stop and l isten,
I'll sing you a song,
About the Mighty time on the ocean
When the Titanic vessel went down.

Wasn't that a might time, etc.

I'll tell you about John Jacob Astor
With his handsome bride;
Refused to get in the li[g]feboat
And they remained on the vessel and died.

Wasn't that a mighty time, etc.
That way that went,

What other disastors have you written?
H: Well, I wrote about the Wrold War in '18.
A: Oh, you did?
