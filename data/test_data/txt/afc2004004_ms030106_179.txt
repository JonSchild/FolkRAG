New Orleans Blues

(Piano)  This was one of the early tunes.  That is
the type of tunes was no doubt one of the earliest blues
that was created as a composition, a playable composition,
in the city of New Orleans.  This tune was wrote about 1902.
All the bands in the city of New Orleans played these tunes,
that is, this tune I mean.  Of course, you may notice the
Spanish tinge in it.  This has so much to do with the
typical jazz idea.  If one can't manage a way to put the
tinges of Spanish in these tunes, they will never be able
to get the right season, I may call it, for jazz music.
