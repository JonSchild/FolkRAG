have promoted [a] another type of Cowboys Reunion
Professionals are barred. A prize
winner one year may not
again compete for the same
prize. Explicitly only men who
earn their bread by handling
cattle may be contestants. Even

onlooker who wishes to see
the dramatics and picturesque
[view] scenes of life on a cattle ranch,
[whatever] the contests are strictly
limited to what may happen
any day on a ranch. So 
the bulldogger disappears.
The boss does not require
any cowboy to run alongside
