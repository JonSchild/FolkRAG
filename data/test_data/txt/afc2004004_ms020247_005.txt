                     Still drink 'shine,
                      We got members
                      From nine to ten,
                      Some of these members
                      Still in sin,
                      We got members
                      From ten to 'leven,
                      Some of these members
                      Won't get to heaven,
                      We got members
                      From eleven to twelve,
                      Some of these members
                      Are doomed for hell.                          (CHORUS)
