Mr. Harold Krimsky
The New York World's Fair, Inc.
Queens, Long Island, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Krimsky:

On the second anniversary of your promised letter, I
feel like the third year bride whose husband is calmly
eating his baked beans and talking about the boss and has
forgotten orange blossoms and sweet romance. What has
happened, if anything, in regard to the program we discussed
for the World's Fair? Since the matter is semi-official
at least, and rather affects all my plans for the
next year, I should like as definite an answer as you can
give me. I realize, of course, that at the moment perhaps
things are very much up in the air, but let me hear from
you.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
