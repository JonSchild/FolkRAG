PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

RUMORS -- VOLUME, NATURE, SOURCE

SUMMARY

While many rumors are current in 19 states, in none is the situation
critical, and in most the flood of rumors has abated in the last six
weeks:

Alabama
Arkansas
California
Florida
Georgia
Indiana

Iowa
Kansas
Massachusetts
Michigan
Minnesota
Missouri
New Jersey

New York
Ohio

In only three States, Colorado, Connecticut and Illinois, the volume of
rumors is extensive or growing.  The North Central section of the
country is most beset with rumors while the Southeast is freest.

Exaggeration of losses at Pearl Harbor is still prevalent in 10 States,
in all of which, however, speculation on this subject has markedly
decreased:

Idaho
Michigan
Montana

New Jersey
New York
Pennsylvania
South Carolina

Texas
Virginia
West Virginia
