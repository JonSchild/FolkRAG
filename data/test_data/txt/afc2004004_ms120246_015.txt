The ceremony of Friday Apr. 2, 1937
Port-au. Prince - around the 
corner from St. Anne's. The family 
is from Grand Goave. The man's 
father was obligated to give a manger
loi, but he died before he fulfilled it. 
The loi then seized his son. He has been 
trying for          to get the money 
for the ceremony, I supplied $5 of which 
he bambocked one away - and this morning
I had to give another $1 for Erz. She
appeared last night in a mighty rage and
said wasn't satisfied, she won't come, wdn't 
let anyone else come either. They were very
frightened. Dumb said he wd be pleased to see
a blanc.
