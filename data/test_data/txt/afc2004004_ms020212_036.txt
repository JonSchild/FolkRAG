Dear Peter,
Mr. Morris of the American Folk Festival in Asheville,
North Carolina says he is going to write you in the
next few days.  I asked him to send you and Alberta
tickets and a little change to feed you on the road.
You are to be there first thing in the morning on the
27th of this month so that we can have a day of practice
with Bessie and Ed Young.  Practice up on your drumming
because you probably will be playing snare drum with
Ed Young's drummer.
Tell Alberta I am dying to hear that great soprano of
hers.  I'll be seeing you if everything goes well on
the morning of the 27th.
All best,
Alan Lomax
