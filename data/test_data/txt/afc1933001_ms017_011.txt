JOHN A. LOMAX  ROUTE 4 BOX 341 FOREST HILLS  DALLAS TEXAS

New Iberia La.,
June 21, 1934.

Dear Mr. Engel:

Last night Alan typed
some general comments on
our present trip. In less
than a month we have made
records of 163 tunes, some 
of which are specifically mentioned
in Alan's remarks. All
of this music, as I think 
you will agree, is intelligible,
and without the defects of some
which were hard on your
musical sensibilities [not] among
our first batch.

Please return
