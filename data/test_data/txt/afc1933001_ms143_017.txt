Dear Dr. Spivacke,

This past week I have had several conferences with
Mr. Wise and Hammond. They are both greatly interested in the
bibliography, but there remains one difficulty in beginning
serious work-- space and facilities for auditioning records.
It has been agreed by everyone that this must be done at the 
factory in Bridgeport, but the O.K. of Mr. Wallerstein, himself,
must be obtained before this can be done. In the meantime I have
called on the Decca people, who claim they sell more records
than any other company in the world, and have found a very swell
guy called Capps in charge of their hill-billy department. He
thinks he can arrange for me to go through their material and
besides he is going to introduce me properly to Ink Williams, the
Negro who grandfathered the so-called race-business. The
Musicraft people are interested in our having
their material but for the moment they plead poverty. They strike
me as a little ignorant, but otherwise good guys, very earnest
and sincere, and I think I will do them a couple of favors that
the Columbia Company doesn't want anyhow -- A Lead Belly album
with texts and some Aunt Molly Jackson and bring them around.
There is one person in the Victor business who can be a lot of help
to me. His name is Frank Walker and it seems that he started
the early Gennett hill billy lists. I want to come down to
Washington and go over our Victor material before I see him,
however.
Eric Clark seems to be not quite sure of me or
else not ready to offer me a traveling lectureship. I urged him
to urge you to take one, however, and whether you like it or not,
I think it's a good idea.
Davidson Taylor has got a big program on American
music up his sleeve, in which he wants a couple of spots of folk
music a week. He says if the plan goes through he wants me to
scout the material up and bring it into local stations once a 
week. That's a hundred a week and expenses and if it starts at
all- he's not sure-- it means right away. I'm four hundred dollars
in debt waiting for my scholarship and I do like Columbia and
as much studying as I have time to do. What do you think? Would
the Library give me leave?
Poor father seems to be fading away with impatience in
Texas. Can't the machine be rushed on to him? Please let me know
when you do send it so I can forward a letter of instructions.

Yours,
Alan
