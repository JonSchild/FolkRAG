Tape 84. Recorded by Alan Lomax at Blaxhall Ship Tavern. Suffolk

The Bonny Bunch of Roses. Here the tap is double track and the
song is not audible.

Barman: Order please, ladies and gentlemen. I will now call on
our friend Jack French to oblige with a small ditty.
1)  It was the 14th of July in Liverpool we did lie,
Lie waiting for fresh orders and our anchor for to weigh,
Bound out to the coast of Africa when our orders they run so,
We're bound to sink or destroy, my boys, whenever we may go.
(Repeat last 4 lines.)
2)  We had not been a-sailing scarce 40 leagues from shore,
Before we saw a big French ship, right up to us she bore,
She hailed us in our French colours, "From whence and where did 
you came?"
"We are just come down from Liverpool town, and the Dolphin is
our name." (Repeat 4.)
3) "Are you a man-of-war, sir, or pray what may you be?"
"I am no man-of-war, sir, but a pirate you'll quickly see."
Come haul down your French colours, come hoist the red, white and blue,
Or else the contents of the broadside fire we will instantlye sink you.
4) Now the captain he'd been asked, my boys, and quickly answered nigh,
Cheer, up, cheer up, my bonny lads, we'll show them Liverpool ply,
If it had not been for my own brother the battle would never been tried,
Let everyman stand true to his guns and we'll give them a broadside.
5) Now our broadside it was given, which made all hands to wonder,
To see our gallant topyard gallant sheets come rattling down like thunder,
We shot him from our quarter deck till they could no longer stay,
Our guns was smart and we played our part and we showed them Liverpool play.
6) Now this French ship was taken, to Liverpool, docks they moored,
The Come haul down those French colours, & hoist up the red, white & blue,
We'll drink success to the bosun and all the saucy crew,
