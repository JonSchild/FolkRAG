Did you ever hear...you never did hear Betsy, the servant maid.
That's a long song.  Would you like me to sing that? That's a good
song.  Well - they've taken that down, ain't they -tryin' to.  It's
a long song. (Pause). All right.
(pause) What's the beginning of it?
you've talked me out of that now.

Cox: Oh, I know.
A thresher's daughter living near
When shocking news you soon shall hear,
When up to London she did go
To seek for service as you shall know.

She went till she came to a squire's hall,
And there she did both knock and call;
"I hear you want a servant," she said,
"And I am Betsy, the servant maid."

The squire had one only son,
And Betsy's heart so soon he won,
And Betsy, being so blithe and fair,
Soon drew his heart into a snare.

On Sunday evenings he took his time,
Unto sweet Betsy he told his mind;
He swore by oaths and powers above,
"It is you, sweet Betsy, it is you I love."
