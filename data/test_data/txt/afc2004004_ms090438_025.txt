1  I've read the Bible prayerfully, searched it very close,
But there is one big question I've always wanted to know.
Visited many countries, going from land to land
To find somebody that can tell me, what is the soul of man?

-CHORUS-
I want somebody to tell me
Somebody that knows and will tell me right,
Speak the truth and don't lie
I want somebody to tell me, what is the soul of man?

2 The world's is in doubt about it, scholars disagree
Some say the soul is conscience, others say its memory
Some say its reason or intellect, spiritual and out of sight
while others declare the soul of man is nothing but his life.

3 I heard some people talking, just walked up in time
To hear one say. the soul of man is nothing but his mind
Then an argument started, and all began to guess
Some of them claimed, the soul of amn is nothing but his breath.

4 Now all these different opininns no one of them seem right
The soul of man is not his breath, his conscience nor his life,
The views are unscriptorial, and therefore not correct
Its not his mind nor memory, reason nor intellect.

5 One day while I was searching, this is what I found
That the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground.
And here we have the story as in the Bible told.
He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a
living soul

6 From these two ingredients, it can be clearly seen.
That man was by nature created a compound being
And here is where the mystery begins to unfold
How the dust of the earth with the breath of life forms a living
soul.
