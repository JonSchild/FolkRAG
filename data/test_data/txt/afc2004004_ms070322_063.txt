simply wants out.
Monday.
Yesterday morning I wrote a letter to 
Robin, explaining my temporary impotence
and telling her that tenderness would
dispell the trouble. This morning we
still were not together although she
was much [most] more tender. She said again
that I always push her too much, 
never give her a chance to come
to me on her own, always do
the talking, make the advances,
hurry her.

Hamish Henderson came at 3 & we
took a lot of fine Scots songs. He's fine & mostly serious.
