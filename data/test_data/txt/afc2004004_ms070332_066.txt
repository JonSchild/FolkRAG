Baptist Association of colored churches in Michigan, is the oldest
of Calvin township's fine churches. The Mount Zion Church, A.M.E.
and the Bethel Church of the same denomination, the Seventh Day
Adventist Church, and the new Community Center church, undenominational,
are well attended. It is around these churches that the
social activities of the community center and it is to their meetings
that the former residents return, sometimes from great distances,
to renew their acquaintance with old friends and relatives.

In harmony with the racial nature, religious services testify
to the spiritual growth of the people. During the summer they hold
their so-called "Bush Meetings," one of which, that of the Chain
Lakes Baptist Church, is known as the Annual Home-coming. At all
of these meetings, music is a large part of the services. Prominent
soloists, as well as renowned choirs and choral societies, come from
as far as Chicago and other large cities to participate. Orthodox
sacred music is sung, as well as the beautiful spirituals, for
which the race is noted. Fortunate, indeed, is the Caucasian who
has the opportunity to witness one of these meetings.
