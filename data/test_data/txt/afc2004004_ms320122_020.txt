CAJUN/MR. FOUGET   -19
probably run over his vocal chord here or something.  He
could hardly talk anymore.  Then he died, I believe he died
in Crowley in a hospital somewhere.  Oh, in, in the old
shack they had.  I've got to find out more about Almadee.
But he's got a aunt that lives somewhere in [Urahl] over
there.  And there's an old fellow there, he says I'm, I'll
go with you.  Most probably got pictures also.  But I never
did, never got to go.
     But him and my uncle, they played a lot of
times.  And then Douglas, Douglas was another black man.  He
played with my uncle and Almadee also.  [Dennis has] got a 
different story.  He say Douglas wanted to play with
Almadee, that's why they killed him.  And Almadee wanted him
to play with him because he was white and the other one was
black, you know, they couldn't go into white places.  But
[Dennis] could, you see, with him.  But I don't believe
that's quite, quite right.  But Douglas, he made the [flam
la fair].  He was a good violin player.
A. LOMAX  Want to give us another tune?
MR. FOUGET  The [flam la fair].  I'm going
to play that, talking about black people, that, Douglas. . .

MR. FOUGET  By the way he got drunk, the
man had a store.  He said you got some hot ketchup?
