Gentlemen:

Mr. Heber R. Harper, Regional Director
Social Security Board, Denver, Colorado requested
that I report to you rumors related in any way to
the war effort during the period of August 8th to
16th.  The following rumors were heard:

Cheyenne, Wyoming, August 10th
"They are building a hangar to house 150 big
bombers.  Part of it is underground.  They say they
are probably going to build another one.  People
work a week or two and then sit because they can't
find places to live in Cheyenne.  They are talking
of running a bus line to Fort Collins."

Cheyenne, Wyoming, August 11th.
"No one knows for sure, but it is rumored that
there are thirty thousand soldiers stationed at
Fort Francis E. Warren now."

Sun Valley, Idaho, August 13th.
"Sun Valley is to be taken over by the Government
as a convalescent home for the Navy."

Very truly yours,
[signature]
Mrs. Agnes English Vaughn
Regional Nutrition Representative
