Mr. Thomas D. Mabry
Office of Facts and Figures
Room 806, 515 22nd Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Mabry:

                             Perhaps someone at the Office of Facts and Figures would like to deny such rumors as this.

                              I was formerly publisher of Printers' Ink until my resignation and when something like this happens they naturally come to me for advice.

                                Meade is one of our salesman who got this from some authoritative source.

                                                                                    Sincerely yours,
                                                                                     C.R. DICKINSON
                                                                                    Lt. Colonel, Specialist
