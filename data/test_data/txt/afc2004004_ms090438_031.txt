1. At the rail road station one day when the soldiers were going away,
The crowd stood around and began to moan.
I heard a soldier say: mother don't forget to pray;
Keep your lamp burning in the window till I come home.

CHORUS
Keep your lamp burning in the window till I come home,
Keep your lamp burning in the window till I come home,
If the light holds out to burn, some day I shall return;
Keep your lamp burning in the window till I come home.

2. We are going to the training camps and from there across the sea
To fight a foe we have not known;
We belong to Uncle Sam and must fight for liberty.
Keep your lamp burning in the window till we come home.

3. When the boys began to leave, wives and mothers grieved,
And prayers went up to God upon His throne,
It almost breaks their heart, but the best of friends must part;
Keep your lamp burning in the window till we come home.

4. On the Atlantic, and Pacific and in the Mediteranean Sea,
The nations all must reap what they have sown,
All these years they must pay in blood and tears
Keep your lamp burning in the window till we come home.

5. On a hundred battlefields, we are giving our lives away
Leaving our wives and family all alone,
While some of you on the home front striking for higher pay;
Keep your lamp burning in the window till we come home.

6. Taking all kinds of exposure in the cold, snow and rain,
The trouble we are going through cannot be known,
Fighting day night until victory is gained;
Keep your light burning in the window till we come home.

7. In the Solomon Islands, in the midst of shots and shells,
The Lord will protect and care for His own,
Fighting with the enemy and actually passing through hell; 
Keep your lamp burning in the window till we come home.

8. When we come back from the battlefield we will have a lot to tell.
Of the battles fought in Tokio and Rome,
How we chased the enemy and made him run like (---l)
Keep your lamp burning in the window till we come home.

CHORUS
Keep your lamp burning in the window till we come home,
Keep your lamp burning in the window till we come home;
When we are through dropping bombs, fighting with bayonets and shooting guns;
Keep your lamp burning in the window till we come home.
