Where I work [at], [about] a few weeks ago a
girl from the office whispered something to
another girl, and finally all the girls and
ladies knew about it â€“ that clothes
were going to be rationed that week. One
of the girls got so excited, that she immediately
called up her mother and told her to hurry
up and go downtown and buy her a coat; she
would buy another one as soon as she
finished working.
