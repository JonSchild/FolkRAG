Dear Dr. Spivacke:

We recently shipped you, after some delay, two
recording stylii for aluminum. I would like to offer some explanation
both of the delay and of the type of stylus sent.

Up to a year ago, we had our own lapidary man
and equipment but the demand was so specialized and limited tht
we decided it would be better to have the work done outside.
We did have a supply of aluminum cutting stylii which we believe
to have been superior to anything else. When this supply was
exhausted we started supplying our customers with an improved
diamond cutting stylus whose life is practically permanent, but
giving not quite as good results as our sapphires. The ruggedness
and permanence of the diamond made up for the quality, the diamond
being far better than those currently used a few years ago. On receipt
of your order we endeavored to get some stylii made up for
you exactly like those we previously made ourselves but after
some delay were unable to get them, and on receipt of your telegram
sent the standard sapphire we were able to get.

In the future I think it would be wise for you to
invest in a diamond and be able to forget about replacements. The
cost is $7.50 for the one we supply.

The writer has been intending to get to Washington
again for the last few months since we wanted to show you our
Junior machine, which by the way, has proven very popular.

Very truly yours,
Lincoln Thompson
Lincoln Thomson
