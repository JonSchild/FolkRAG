Must be terrible misery (to drop 9 feet from a gallows)

Scraping Cotton

I'm gwine in de country, an' it [aint] wont be 
long.   Gwine on dat cotton farm
An' work dat cotton & corm 
plant
An' make dat my native home

When I plant dat cotton, twas early in 
de spring
He was born in de country
Way over in dat country on dat sugah
farm

Plant dat [country]
While I scrape my cotton 
In de country where I was born
gwine to make it my native home
