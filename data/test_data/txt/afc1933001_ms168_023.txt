films go, would not be exorbitantly expensive.  We think 
it would be possible to do three excellent films (each ten 
to fifteen minutes long) for a total of $20,000.

I hope that you will understand the reasons why 
I am giving you these figures and facts in such unadorned 
fashion.  I do hope that this letter will make you want to 
discuss our problem and the possibilities of this kind of 
film.  At the same time I don't wish to burden you with a 
lengthy presentation.  Full discussion of the possibilities 
should come only after you have seen some of the existing 
documentary films on other subjects which we would be very 
glad to arrange at your convenience.

Very sincerely yours,
