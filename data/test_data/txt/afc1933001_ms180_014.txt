Dear Mr. Spivacke:

   Thank you for your letter of March 7th. It came just as we 
were clearing the debris away from the last o four Music Festival.
It was a considerable success. We had a small detachment of men
from Fort Benning, Georgia, in the male chorus there to participate
in the Festival. *
     Regarding records, Mr. John Work of Fisk University was here
with a Recorder, and made several records. It was my understanding
that he would send these records to Mr. Lomax.
     I hope that the project may further be developed and that success
may crown your efforts in pursuing further avenues for such
further developments. You may be interested to know that there
may be an account of our Festival in the next TIME magazine.
     With best wishes, I am

Sincerely yous,
