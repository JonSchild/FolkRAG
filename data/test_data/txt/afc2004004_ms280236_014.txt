1) And finding that no one could harm her,
SHe'd often been that way before,
And thinking that no one could harm her,
She'd oftimes been that way before.
2) One day she met with a highwayman,
His pistol he drew to her breast,
Saying, "Deliver your money or clothing,
Or you will shout high in distress." (repeat last 2 lines.)
3) He stripped this fair damsel stark naked,
And gave her the reins for to hold,
And there she stood shivering and shaking,
All starving to death with the cold. (Repeat last 2 lines.)
4) She put her left foot in the stirrup,
And saddled the horse like a man,
Over hedges and ditches she galloped,
Crying, "Catch me, you rogue, if you can!) (repeat last 2 lines.)
5) The rogue he quickly followed after,
Which caused him to puff and to blow,
And finding that he could not overtake her,
She rode to her father's own door. (Repeat last 2 lines.)
6) O daughter, o daughter, oh where has thou been?
Tou've been to the market so long.
O father I've been in great danger,
But truly has done me no harm.
7) She put the grey horse in the stable,
SHe gave him some corn and some hay,
And there she sat counting her money,
From midnight till daylight next day!
She had the money in her saddlebags!
Lomax: She was a smart girl!
