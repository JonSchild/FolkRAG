LARRY:
Well that guitar becomes, it becomes everything after a while. If I, I often asked myself If I hadn't met Brother Davis and met my wife and then broke up how I would have took that because I wouldn't have had nothing, I wouldn't have had any music to rely on, I mean I wouldn't have been able to play. And with that frame of mind I wouldn't have been able to learn.
MARS. DAVIS:
I know what you mean.
LARRY:
I often wonder what I would have done. But by me already met him early in life and he started me, so to take that space up and since then I prospered more than I ever did.
MRS. DAVIS:
I know you have and it means a lot.
LARRY:
It sure do----------(?)
MRS. DAVIS:
And you won't forget the things that he told you.
LARRY:
I can't Mrs. Davis. I don't want to, and just the other night a fellow come to my house and telling me had left his wife. And do you know what I caught myself talking to him just like Brother Davis was talking to me and I was telling him I say, You know man my wife broke up but its not nothing I'm proud of, you know. I mean just the other day I went out and I made some money for playing my guitar and there was nobody for me to say
