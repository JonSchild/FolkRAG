]1683] B 1682 17 A

I personally didn't believe that the Spanish tunes
were really perfected in the tempos. The fact -- that the tempos
wasn't always correct. And I heard a lot of Spanish tunes
and I tried to play them in correct tempo, myself, and I 
didn't possibly play them very correct in tempo, but I
wasn't altogether satisfied with some of the melodies. I
decided to write some of them, myself. I will now try to
play one for your approval. This [one] number is "Creepy Feeling."
(Piano)

(One ? J.R.'s finest things -
really Spanish in its atmosphere -
4 beautiful strains? -- lovely ?
