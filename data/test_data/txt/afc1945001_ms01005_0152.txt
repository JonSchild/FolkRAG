THE SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY RUMOR CLINIC
Maxwell Hall
Syracuse University
Syracuse, N.Y.

3 October, 1942.

Mr. Elmer Davis
Office of War Information
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

THE SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY RUMOR CLINIC has been organized by some of
the members of the university faculty to perform the following services:

1. To improve morale and further the war effort by choking off
false rumors through the publication of the truth
2. To educate the people of the City of Syracuse and the County
of Onondaga in the necessity for and the use of a practical,
critical standard of judgement
3. To inform all public agencies of rumors circulating about
them so that they may take whatever action they deem appropriate
4. To co-operate with other organizations for the study and promotion
of morale
5. To investigate the sources of rumors and to turn this information
over to the proper public authorities.

The methods we propose to employ are similar to those tried and
tested by the Massachusetts Division of Propaganda Research. The publicity
will be handled by the Syracuse POST-STANDARD. The Clinic will be financed,
at least at the beginning, by voluntary contributions from citizens.

If the Clinic is to be at all effective it is vital that we arrange
connections with the CWI. May we regularly refer rumors to you for     [*no*]
information and refutation ? May we cite your office as authority for the
refutation when it is published ? We shall publish no items of that sort
unless properly authorized to do so and we will hold in confidence any "off-
the-record" information you might send us. We shall also take every precaution
to avoid the inadvertent release of information which might aid
the enemy. Our files will always be open for your inspection and use.

May I ask the favor of an immediate reply so that we can begin our
work at once ? I am enclosing a list of the names and addresses of the
Executive Committee of the Clinic so that you may check our personnel if you
so desire. And I shall be glad to furnish you with any further information
that you want.

Yours truly,
Warren B. Walsh
