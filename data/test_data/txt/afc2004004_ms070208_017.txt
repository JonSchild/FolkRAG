[*Interview with Charley Idaho*]
Handled niggers all my life and never crippled
 one yet - a good record - some of these foremen
 would beat 'em up just to act smart - I didn't 
whip a nigger until it was necessary and then
 I made a good job of it - I'd take him out
 behind the house and wear him out with a 
belly band off the harness - and make him like it - 
he'd know he was wrong and he'd take it - 
Fired a foreman once for hittin' a nigger - 
he hit him once and then stepped back to see
 how he'd take it - just made the nigger mad - 
that was the wrong thing to do - if you whip
 a nigger, you want to scare him, not make
 him mad, just scare him good - make
 him work better - I called that foreman
 up and give him his time - 
On the job I've whipped a many a one
 when they needed it - gone after 'em with a
 club or a whip - never with my bare hands
 a man'd be a fool to do that - 
When they'd get to fightin' I'd separate
 'em and sometimes I'd disarm 'em and 
strip 'em & make 'em fight it out - when
 they'd get tired I'd wear 'em out and 
make 'e fight till they had enough - and
 then make 'em fight til they had more
 than enough - till they could just about wiggle
