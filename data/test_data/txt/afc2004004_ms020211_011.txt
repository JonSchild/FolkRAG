Slave Spirituals On the Mall
By Judith Martin

The thwanging and the stomping
and the shouting went on
through the heat yesterday at the
Smithsonian's Festival of American
Folklife. Fiddlers and country dancers
beat their rhythms on wooden
platforms scattered on the Mall,
and sneakered and sandaled feet
tapped it on the bare ground.
It was the third day of the five-day
festival and crowds bordering
on 100,000 again filled Washington's
version of the village green.
Yesterday fold music--from blues
to ballad, from country to
spiritual--was the festival feature.
Names of groups, like The Happy
Valley Boys, the Pennywhistlers,
the Sacred Harp Singing School,
were as bright as the tunes themselves.
For Bessie Jones, it was her
third festival.  She brought four
adults and four children (three
from among her own vast collection 
of grandchildren and great-grandchildren 
and one a cousin) selected
from her Georgia Sea Island
Singers from St. Simon's Island, Ga.
They're performing in a segment
called "Black and Proud."  At home,
there are 30 of them, playing and
singing slave music for the tourists
in the hotels.
They sing at home at night, with
"big old high poles and fires and the
moss on the trees, and the smoke
keeps the dew from falling." Here,
it's in the mid-day heat, and the
children run for soft drinks and
fried chicken during the breaks.
Bessie Jones learned to sing 

from her grandparents, who were
slaves in Virginia and who were 
married in the old slave ceremony
of jumping over a high broom together,
which they practiced and
practiced beforehand because you
only got two chances, and if you
missed you had to go back to courting
again for a while.  Her grandmother
was a big woman who lived
to be 100, and her grandfather was
small and lived to 105, and Bessie
Jones learned to sing by listening at
the fireside as the old people sang
while the women quilted.
And now she composes music
"when the Lord gives me song" and 
makes medicine for her
descendents--"I'm 68 years old,
and I haven't had headache since
1924"--and teaches children. Some
people won't talk about their music,
she said, but she's made records
and written a book called "Step It
Down" about "my history, songs,
stories, and how I come up and
medicine and women--I done
made myself three women: a baby
one, a girl one, a woman--and now
an old woman.
"I want my music to go on. I'm
going to die one day, and folks are
going to need it."

A NOVEL CONCERT
BY BESSIE JONES
__________
A Spirit of Georgia Islands
Permeates Oval Room
__________
By JOHN S. WILSON

Bessie Jones, a leader of the
Georgia Sea Island Singers, came 


north this weekend with just one
Georgia voice, Bessie Burk, to support
her in her traditional songs, 
ring games, shouts and spirituals. 
But at a concert sponsored by the
New York Pinewoods Folk Music
Club on Friday night at the Oval
Room, 13 Astor Place, that was all
the support she needed. 
Miss Jones, a vital, garrulous,
68-year-old with an amazing store
of energy, fired up her audience
through a few songs with Miss
Burk's help and then pulled her listeners
more and more into her activities
both as singers and dancers.
Wearing a stunning gold and
black robe and beating time on a
tambourine (a new one that, she
said, was not quite tuned to her yet),
Miss Jones moved through some
old-time religious songs with the
sure, developmental skill of a gospel
preacher, shouting out the lines
with a great swinging beat that Miss
Burk re-emphasized as she sang
back her responses.
And then, interspersed with tall
tales, Miss Jones got members of
her audience up on the stage with
her to play out the roles of courting
dances while she and Miss Burk
kept the beat and the lyrics going.
Miss Jones had a jovial but
commanding way of presenting her
songs and leading the dances. Yet
Miss Burk, working in the shadow 
of her friend, gradually revealed a
marvelously strong, resilient voice
that shot lines out like a whiplash,
nicking up the vocal energy as Miss
Jones turned her attention to calling
the dances.
Even with a singing and dancing
company made up of willing and
breathless New Yorkers, Miss Jones
and Miss Burk managed to bring a
great deal of the musical spirit of
the Georgia Islands to chilly Manhattan.

Bessie Jones Sings
And Tells Stories
Of Georgia Coast 
__________
By JOHN S. WILSON

Despite three broken ribs and a 
broken nose suffered in an automobile
accident last fall, 70-year-old 
Bessie Jones is still traveling north
from the Georgia Sea Islands with 
her programs of gospel songs,
games, ring shouts, work songs and
dances.
On Friday evening, in the auditorium
of the Church of Our
Lady of Peace, 237 East 62nd 
Street, where she was presented by
the New York Pinewood Folk Music
Club, Miss Jones also had a cold to
contend with ("Wish I wasn't so
awful hoarse," she said. "It's awful,
just awful.")
But, as usual, she was otherwise
unflinchingly thankful for everything
the Lord had sent her way,
and she carried on as though nothing
the least untoward had happened
to her.
She was supported by a predominantly
family group, made up of
her daughter, her grand-daughter
and her great-grandson (a toddler
who strummed lustily on a ukulele
all through the program) along
with Douglas Quimby and Miss
Jones's colleague of long standing,
Bessie Burkes.
Miss Jones's voice, enthusiasm
and stamina were as unflagging as
ever.  She sand with the big, broad,
seemingly effortless projection of
the great gospel singers, and she
got her audience involved in her
performance almost from the
start--singing, clapping and, eventually,
calling some of them up on
the stage to take part in party
games, dances and ring shouts.
