BJ Tape 40, p.3

BJ: That's all to that. 

TL: Let's put "Down to the Mire" on now. 

BJ: All right.  Yeah, we have "Down to the Mire."  That's all the
old people teachin' the young folks how to pray.  And what they 
mean by "down to the mire" is go down low on your knees;  go 
somewhere an' hide somewhere in a secret place and pray.  But they
would have an' show 'em, go how what they meant by all of 'em
gettin' around in a ring and one catch over to the other/one's
you know, catch over to his head.  Touch his head, you know, 
with the hand, and pat on there.  Just hold the head on the hand. 
They go down to the mire, slow, slow, slow and low, low, low, 
clean down to the floor.  An' den they tell 'em when they go down
to the mire, that mean they get on down low for Jesus.  An' den, 
when they rise from the mire, that their soul is converted an' 
they is saved an' then they can should free, because they are 
saved. 

So dat's what, that's what "Down to the Mire" mean.  An' so
they said go like this, to start out singin':
