Dear Professor Lomax:

I am writing to ask if it will be possible, and if you will be kind
enough, to give me some rather detailed information regarding the number
of variants of a particular ballad in the Archive.
For several months I have been engaged in assembling American, British,
Scandinavian, Faroic, Icelandic, and other texts and tunes of "The Two
Sisters" (Child, No. 10) in preparation for a historical-geographical
study of this ballad. I might explain that this is the subject of my
doctoral dissertation, being written under the direction of Prof. Stith
Thompson. At present, I have something over 300 variant texts and 125
tunes --- American, English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Danish, Norwegian,
Swedish, Faroic, and Icelandic. I believe that I have practically all
the published American versions, and also copies from most of the unpublished
collections in private hands. However, there may be some variants in the
Archive of American Folkson which differ from American texts in my possession,
although it seems to me not very likely, since all my American
texts show a very marked similarity. Still, I don't want to overlook anything
that should be considered.
Would it be possible for you (1) to give me the approximate number
of Child, No. 10 texts in the Archive, with some data regarding the collector
and the region from which collected (this to avoid possible
duplication) and (2) to furnish me some estimate as to the cost of having
copies made of them? Unfortunately I find myself unable to come to
Washington at present.
If you can do me this favor, I shall appreciate it greatly; if not,
please notify me so that I shall not be expecting the information and
perhaps I can arrange to spend some time in the Archive later.
With all good wishes, I am

Sincerely yours,
Paul G. Brewster
