HOW MUCH I OWE

CHORUS:
How much I owe
For love devine,
How much I owe
Since Christ is mine,
And what He is
To me I know,
I cannot tell
How much I owe.  (REPEART CHORUS)

King Jesus died
On Calvary,
Oh, yes, he died
For you and me,
I've often wondered,
If I try,
I cannot tell
How much I owe.  (CHORUS)

And when we reach
That other sho',
There we will dwell
For ever mo',
Ten thousand years
May come and go,
But I cannot tell
Lawd, how much I owe.  (CHORUS)
