SIT-DOWN:
1.
When they tie a can to a union
man
Sit down! Sit down!
When they give 'im the sack,
they'll take him back,
Sit down! Sit down!
Chorus:
Sit down, just take a seat,
Sit down, and rest your feet,
Sit down, you've got 'em beat,
Sit down! Sit down!

2. When they smile and say, no
raise in pay,
Sit down! Sit down!
When you want the boss to come
across,
Sit down! Sit down! (Chorus)

3. When the speed up comes, just
twiddle your thumbs,
Sit down! Sit down!
When you want them to know
they'd better go slow
Sit down! Sit down! (Chorus)

4. When the boss won't talk, don't
take a walk,
Sit down! Sit down!
When the boss sees that, he'll 
want a little chat,
Sit down! Sit down! (Chorus)

WHEN A SCAB DIES

When a scab dies he goes to hell
Par-le-voo
When a scab dies he goes to hell
Par-le-voo
When a scab dies he goes to hell
The rats and skunks are ringing
the bell,
Hinky dinky par-le-voo.

The boss is shaking at the knees
Par-le-voo
Tue boss is shaking at the knees
Par-le-voo
The boss is shaking at the knees
He's shivering in his B-V-Ds,
Hinky dinky parle-voo.

We'll strike and fight for our
rights,
Par-le-voo
We'll strike and fight for our 
rights,
Par-le-voo
We'll strike and fight for our
rights,
Our Picket line will be kept 
tight,
Hinky dinky par-le-voo.

The boss is having a hell of a
time, Par-le-voo
The boss is having a hell of a 
time, Par-le-voo
The boss is having a hell of a
time
To keep us off the picket linie
Hinky dinky par-le-voo.

ON THE PICKET LINE

The union is the place for me
A place for working men
Who want some time to sing & play
And money we can spend.

Chorus:
On the line, on the line,
On the picket, picket line,
We'll win our fight, our fight
for the right,
On the picket, picket line.

I am a union man because
I want a living wage.
We'll stick together
We'll fight together
We'll get that living wage.

The man who scabs is the man
who's yellow
And he is a sight to see,
We'll kick him out,
We'll kick him out,
With the picket, picket line.
