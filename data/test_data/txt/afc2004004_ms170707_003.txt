PS
I have how finished my work on
Festival committee [?] so I'll 
probably be able to tackle
your questions soon. - However,
as I pointed out in my last letter,
it really does seem to me that
taking on the job of amplifying and
clarifying the notes on Alan's
Scottish LP should entitle me
to a much larger fee than
one hundred dollars!
