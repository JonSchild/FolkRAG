Christmas, ah, it was jus' before, uh, you know, time, befo' 
Christmas 'bout -- It was about Christmas Eve [dere] den -- lil' befo'.  Ah, 
ah, he had went out in the ocean, somewhere out there, or somebody, 
an' got some whiskey from a sea-bottom boat they found.   They had
got a sea-bottom boat up?  A boat that been down for years an'
years.   An' that -- An' boy, that thing had whiskey, he said; the 
deck of it was loaded, with whiskey.
TL:     Who went after it?
BJ:      Some, ah, white mens.   An' colored, too.  A whole lot, you 
know, in Miami, what, what search for the sea-bottom boat.  It 
had the mud, ol' stick-sticky stuff, all on the side a the, the 
bottle.   Under the bottleneck.   I had to wipe it all off.  An' 
he tol' me, said, at Christmas he [hev] give it to me.  Said, "Bessie," 
he said, "Here's a..."  Said, he call that, "Ol Sumonion."  I 
don' know what that is.   But, he said, "Don't worry about it.  Now, 
don't don't drink much or it'll tip up behin' ya an' touch ya in 
the back."   It taste mild, wery (very) mild, ya know.   I didn', 
I didn' open it then.
         But I jus' so happy to go home.  I know I had plenty homebrew 
at the house.  Ta, ta give friends.  An' I was gonna let 
them know I had this, this new whiskey, this good whiskey.   So I 
went over an' got there.  Carried all my big Christmas dinner.  Had 
to have he'p, ya know, ta carry it in, 'cause, ya know, they cooks 
a big dinner for me, too, after I cook my own dinner at they house.  
So when I git home, I won' have nothin' ta do.
         So?   I got in there an' ah, it's a boy -- I had two, two 
rooms rented out, both of 'em.  An' one of these boys was sick.  
An' he stayed there 'most all the time.  You know, at the house.  
He seed sumpin' happen.   An' he said to me, "I got --"  I said,
