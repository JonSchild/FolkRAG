WOMENS' AUXILIARY SONG

Tune: Let's All Sing Like the Birdies Sing
1. Auxiliary women are in the
fight
In the fight to stay
They will battle with all their
might
Onward every day
For their homes and their kiddies
too
For their Union men
You can bet your last dime
They'll be there every time
Fighting to the end.

2. When the workers "sit-in" the
plant
Who stands on the line?
When the workers must get their
food
Who gets it there on time?
When the spirit is runing low
Who will make it rise?
It's the woman, you know
Who make everything go, 
They are Union-Wise.

3. Every woman should have a
house
She can call her own
Decent living for every child
In a decent home
Food and shelter and clothing too
For the family
So she joins in the fight
For a cause that is right
Sharing Victory!

PUT ON YOUR OLD UNION BUTTON

Tune: Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet

1. Put on your old Union button
It won't be forgotten
When we win
A Workers' Victory
It is the mark of knowledge
In the workers' college
It means Solidarity.

2. Don't be afraid to show it
Let your friends all know it
By its sign
All workers will be free
And when the struggle's over
We'll be in the clover
Bargaining Collectively.

3. And everywhere you wear it
You will always share it
With the Brotherhood
From sea to sea
And we will keep on preaching
Of our Union teaching
Keep the fight for Unity.

A UNION MAN

Tune: When Johnny Comes
Marching Home

1. A union man is a fighting man
He never stops
He's not afraid of the company
threats
Or company cops.
The spies and sluggers can try
their tricks
They'll always find him as hard
as bricks

2. A union man is a thinking man
Nobody's fool. 
He's smart enough to call the
bluff
Of the company's stool.
When company offers are brought
to light
He sees a bargain and sees it
right.
Anyone can see
A loyal man is he.

3. A Union man is a loyal man
He's tried and true.
No matter how tough the going
gets
He sees it through
He's always ready to hear the
call
It's all for one and one for all.
Anyone can see
A loyal man is he.

4. A union man is a working man
He tells his friends
That Labor's might will win the
fight
For Labor's ends.
He keeps on plugging from day to
day
To build the Union in every way.
Anyone can see
A working man is he.
