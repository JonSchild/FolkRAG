Miss Louise Lynne
Director of Recreation

Dear Colonel Somervell:

Plans for the participation of the Recreation Division
in the exhibit at the New York World's Fair have been submitted to
the governing committee of the Works Progress Administration. I
am writing you now to keep you apprised of our plans for the fiar
exhibit and those portions which you will be asked to carry out if
they are approved by the committee.

Although the plans submitted to the committee have not
yet been passed on for approval, I think it reasonable that you
make at least tentative arrangements for carrying them out. In the
case of models or charts or dioramas that will have to be built, it
would be advisable to begin now to work out the designs. These
paper plans will then be ready to go into effect in case construction
is called for. If they are not used for this exhibit they will undoubtedly
be of value at some later date. I should like to keep
closely in touch with whatever plans and designs are drawn up and
I hope you will let me see these drafts as they are completed. Perhaps
I will be able to give you some assistance and suggestions on
some of them. If necessary, I can meet with you in New York after
the first of the year.

The plans submitted to the fair committee include the
following:

I. Plans for the operation of the bandshell.
II. Plans for the operation of the auditorium.
III. Plans for the operation of the court.
IV. Plans for live exhibits, i.e., demonstrators.
V. Plans for arrested-action or steps-in-construction
exhibits, which may be used individually or may
supplement the live exhibits.
VI. Plans for models, graphs, charts and dioramas in
the stationary panel exhibit.
