"I talked to a woman in Indiana, last month. They drafted her 
husband right out of his service station. Left her with two little kids on 
her hands and another on one the way. Didn't even give him time to straighten 
up his business, by gosh. But there are still plenty of young, single fellows 
who haven't been called in the same town. This poor woman was stranded - 
didn't have any income except what he would send her from his pay."
