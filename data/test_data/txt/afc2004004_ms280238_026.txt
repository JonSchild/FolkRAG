Lomax: Do the people still make their own clothes here?
Mary Gillis: Oh, no, dear. It's very different.
Annie Johnson: There's very little weaving done here.
Mary Gillis: They're too lazy now. All that is done away, see.
Lomax: What's happened to replace all these old arts?
Mary Gillis: The mills! And all these new things!
Lomax: Do you think it's too bad?
Mary Gillis: I think it's -- no, no. I think it's a very good idea,
because 'twas far too much for the women here.
Mary Johnson: Oh yes, it was too hard - and taking up a family
besides that.
Annie Johnson: They lived longer than this generation.
Mary McLoud: My mother was 92, and she had a loom and all that -- and
a family to bring up and two cows, and peats to carry from back of
the hill -- on her back, mind you. It wasn't an easy thing; they wouldn't
do it today though.
Mary Gillis: But we mind our mother there; she had Stornaway girls;
they were here at the fishing, and six of them were
                   , and she sent over for the six of them, and they came
over -- I mind that, all right. And oh, they were very nice with their
white blouses, and their sleeves turned up (THE WOMEN ARE ASSENTING
THROUGHOUT THIS) and lovely aprons, - print aprons with white tapes --
they were very nice -- and their hair done up in a roll - coifs at
the back of the head. They were very nice. And I mind 5 of them, and 
when Roderick came in she began to do the song for Roderick. And she
asked mother what was the name of him - the boy. It was just a young
boy, he would be just fifteen or something like that. And my mother
told them it was Roderick, and he had to wear -- carry on. . . . The
Stornaway girls -- they were fine; and there were some of ourselves.
Lomax: And was there any money paid at the. . . .
                                             PAUSE. . . .
Mary Gillis: I mind fine when you were born. Your mother used to lull
you to sleep. (SHE SINGS AND ALL JOIN IN.) I used to sing it for
you then! (Laughter.)
Annie Johnson: Did you?
