Dear Dr. Spivacke:

It has been a devilish long time since you've heard from me,
I'm afraid; certainly far longer than I have wished. But constant
movement about this burgeoning sector is perhaps partial explanation.
Just two days ago I returned from a 5600 mile tour of the interior
and southeastern parts of the Territory and I shall soon be off again,
this time to the westward.

Before I leave, however, I do want to report, at least in part,
on the six weekly programs over WXLC, Dutch Harbor, based on the folk
music albums provided through your generosity. Regretably, I could
not supervise this closely myself as I have been on the Sector staff
since shortly after the programs began. The arrangement and commentaries
were handled by one A. F. Robinson, Y2c, a competently trained student
of music and a proficient musician himself.

Robinson's inclinations and preferences are all in the field of
religious music and his general approach was, I'm afraid, entirely too
ethereal for guts-in-the-belly music such as the albums contain.
His written summary of the series sent me has as its keynote, for
instance, the need for "refining these selections by having them carefully
arranged by great living composers." Mention of this background
is, you'll agree, an essential preliminary to understanding
the series' reception.

I had a spot check made of 100 men at Dutch harbor and found
that 72 of these recalled hearing at least half of one program. (The
sample was about equally taken from Navy and Army, comparable to their
proportionate strengths at that base.) Of these 72, 23 disliked what
they had heard, 31 were indifferent, and 18 said they liked it. Only 
5 men were found who had heard all of the six programs; 4 of these
liked them, and had made special efforts to hear the entire series.

All of the praise was for sole singers and banjo instrumental solos;
the severest criticism was directed at inferior reproduction, group
singing ("you can't understand what the hell they're saying"), and general
distaste for an apparently unfamiliar and peculiar type of music. It
cannot be claimed that the body of favorable comment was well informed;
scarcely any of this group remembered a single selection or performer by
name. The appreciative section seemed to be composed of two groups:
