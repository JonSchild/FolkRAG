TAPE: 
R-79- ELLER BROS CONT.      [*1*]
APPALACHIA

AL: . . . .Last joy for you, Mrs. Eller, will be for you to turn to
those boys and ask them to play something. We'll be talking a 
liittle bit and you just turn to them and say "Play something,
fellas, so we can have some music for dancing."
Mrs. Eller: Let them pick something.
AL: How many verses does that "little brown jug" of yours have in it anyway?
Mrs. Eller: Oh, it had about 25 or 30, something like that.
AL: And you used to play that for dances in here?
Mrs. E: Oh yeah, used to pick that on the banjo, we'd get out 
there and dance. We'd never get tired though, we'd just dance
til daylight and not have no tiredness at all.
AL: You think you could get those lazy boys of yours to play us
a tune so we could dance--- what about getting some music out of 
those boys of yours.
MRs. E: Why don't you get up there and play some. . . . . .yeah, we
had some good times back then.
AL: You weren't so mean and wicked. You just sort of flirted
with the boys, you couldn't go walking with them in the woods and 
things like that, could you?
MRs. E: No sirree. You go to school and back to the house. And
daddy and mother went with us, too.
AL: And what would they do if you misbehaved?
Mrs. E: Oh, they'd beat you to death.
Mrs. E: Never got a whipping at all, no.
