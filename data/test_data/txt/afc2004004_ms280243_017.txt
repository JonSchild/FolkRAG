15)  Then he's lowpit up to the ingle then
Where the burgesses drink at the wine,
And he's ta'en oot a handul of siller,
To free the lands of Lynne.

16)  "Come here, come here, my ain nourice,
And I'll pay ye your bread and wine,
And the seas as water as ever it was,
And I am the heir of Lynne.

Van Dieman's Land:
1)  You rambling boys of Liverpool I'd have you to beware,
When you go a hunting with your dogs, your gun, your snare.
Beware of the gamekeepers and have them at your command,
And think on all the hardships going to Van Diemans Land.

2)  We had on board two Irish lads, Jimmy Murphy and Paul Jones,
As true and loyal comrades two as they were well known,
The gamekeeper he caught them, and from old England's strand,
They were seven years transported to plough Van Dieman's Land.

3)  We had on board a lady fair, Mary Johnson was her name,
And she was sent from Liverpool for a playing of the game.
The captain fell in love with her and married her out of hand,
And she gave us all good usage going to Van Dieman's land.

4)  As I lay in my bunk one nigh a-dreaming all alone,
I dreamt I was in Liverpool way back in Mary-le-bone,
With my true love beside me, and a jug of ale in hand,
When I woke, quite broken-hearted, lying off Van Dieman's Land.
