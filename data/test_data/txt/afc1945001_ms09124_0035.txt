Wouldn't it be nice if all Englewood
could participate in a play, titles "What
Its going to be like after we Win The War."
Since this is almost impossible, we can
imagine what its going to be like.

First of all, there will be no rationed
foods (we hope!.)  Jobs won't be so hard
to find no air raids, I could go on and on
telling of all the pleasures we'd have.

There! Now we have just about covered
all the important factors, but wait!
What is it we American find if the hardest
to fight for? What is the thing the symbolic
our flag. Yes that's it!  Fradorn-Liberty.
Maybe after the war is ended we will
have that [forlorn?], maybe then there won't 
be any segrigation and prejudice. Well,
all we can do is hope. Now, do you think
you can imagine what its going to be
like? I can! I [th] know that after
America wins this war we'll have a
big job on our hands we'll have to build
a greater, stranger America that has never
before excited.!
