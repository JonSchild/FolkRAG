"Whatcha say?" Say, "I was tellin' the girls, don't go in
there. [I believe] You see they see her with that baby an' that make
them wanna do the same thing." Mama say, "Get every one of
them damn [nurses] messes outa here right now, naked as like they is! If they
can't look at that baby without puttin' out with men, git outa
here!" Ha, ha, ha, ha! "Git out!" Ha, ha! Mama said, "Git

messes outa here." Ho, ha. I laugh! Mama was mad! She (hit?)
me. An' so, [(it made)] it made her mad! An' so she saw 'em
lookin' at my chile -- ow, that made Mama so mad. But they
begged her pardon and went on, y'know, an' for what they had
said, y'know, that they didn' want the girls to see [my baby] me;
that make them wanna have a baby. Heh, heh, heh! Mama say,
[*seeing babies*]
"Get outa here. If they can't stand to see her -- can't stand to 
see the baby there --[well] "Said, "all of ya done somethin' or other
wrong". Said, "Get outa here. You can jump on your feet, jus'
like you is. Get outa here." But they begged her pardon an '
she let 'em put their, ha, ha, clo's on. Ha, ha. That was
funny that Sunday! I declare, I [can't] had -- it was funny.
And Emma, she jus' didn't like it a bit, the way that they had
talked. Emma said, "They oughta be ashamed of themselves, talkin'
like that." Emma come [on] round to the winda and peep on in

winda for the baby.

to do with it at all [go on].  "She got it; she ain't done more than 
sumpin' else had done." Said, "All of ya had done sumpin' wrong."
