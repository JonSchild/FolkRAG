and Joe Dean time, the people had got on to it so bad.  Ol' Man
Koston, now he didn' care about it, you know, in a way of speakin',
but he didn't want it to be so -- Louella come down there jus' so,
you know, jus' it, ya know.  She was dressed, too.  An' Ol' Man
Koston an' Ol' Lady Koston, too, they talked to 'im, to Rob, but
they couldn't do nothin' with Rob about this thing.   He was crazy
'bout that girl.  
             She [was gettin'] got off the train one day an' they
said that they was gonna kill 'er, when she come off the train
that day.  An' so she got off the train that day an' walked up
where Louella was, stopped her.    An' he (Rob) had heard about it.  An'
he was there.   He went right on there.  He come around that depot
so quick it was pitiful.   An' he told them peoples, said, "Befo'
you hurt Louella's toes, you kill me."  That was his own peoples.
He was a white man, ya know.   Say, "Befo' you hurt her toes." [you] Say,
"Kill me."  That thing struck them crackers, I'm tellin' you they
didn't know what to do.
TL:         Joe Dean said this?
BJ:         No, no, that was another Kostons, that was about this
other girl, Louella, an' this other boy.   Right there at the
same place.  An' he said, "Befo' you hurt Louella's toes," say,
"Kill me."  An' then they told Louella to be missin' from there
in an hour's time an' not come up there no more.  They didn'
bother her.  An' so he goes an' get a plane somewhere.  Up around
Macon they had a plane that come out -- you know, not come out,
but be ready for him; they called for a reservation, ya know? --
an' he got a colored boy named James to take [her]them to Macon an' he
got her out on that plane; they flew up here, him an' Louella.
He [got the] lef' daddy an' everybody else.  Brought
Louella up here.  That's true.  An' that was from right there, in
Wes' Green.  That there happen between, tha's the same time these
peoples bring me this news about this man, see?  Yeah.  An' I
knowed somebody had to go or sumpin' happen around there, see?  Somebody had to go. An'
he lef' there, lef' the papa an' the mama an' everybody.  'Cause Mr.
Korson an' Miz Korson was not together.  They had parted but they --
he run a dry goods store, there; tha's where I got all my stuff
at.   An' she run the fish market.  An' they was already parted.
But them two Koston boys -- an' they parted 'bout a colored woman.
You know?   An' Mrs. Koston didn' have nothin' to say about her boy
messin' with that at all.  An' Mr. Koston didn't either, at that
