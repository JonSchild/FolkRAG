Miss Terrill is sick abed - the second
time recently. This morning
Shirley phoned for us to come to
Lubbock to attend the funeral of
Bess Richards, the oldest daughter of
the very small "Aunt Mattie".
But we can't go.

Bess writes cheerfully and satisfactorily.
She could win a European
scholarship if she would really
put her mind to the task. I would
rejoice in her success and help to
any extent to keep her in funds.

Lately I have sent you a lot
of letters, representing my thinking
at the moment. You don't need
to reply to any or all of them. At no
time, since you are on your own,
have I meant to interfere with your
plans. But I can't help being always
your loving  Father
