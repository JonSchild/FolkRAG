Gentlemen--
Am expecting to make a 
trip soon to Haiti, to record the
native music.
Understand you are
interested in recordings such as these
and wonder if you could give me
any information about Haiti or
can direct me where to write
for such information.
Hoping to hear from you.
very truly yours
John Reynolds.
