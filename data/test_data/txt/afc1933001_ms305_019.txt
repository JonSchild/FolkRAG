Blitzkrieg
Among the Intellectuals
George Seldes

HISTORY is moving too swiftly
for many persons. In Poland there
has been a real Blitzkrieg, a lightning
stroke, from a technical military
viewpoint one of the most brilliant
campaigns in all recorded time. But
it has also been a war of diplomacy,
bloodless victories, pacts, new alignments, 
new creations, new overthrows,
which have come so suddenly they
have caused a tremendous confusion
throughout the world.

Confused people do many things,
they jump from the trains of history
when they round their first sharp

bably many reason-
would be to test the
nations now engaged in the wars of
arms, propaganda and diplomatic
manoeuvring, to compare the ideas
or ideologies (sometimes defined as
"idle theorizing"), which are their
driving force, to judge their contributions
to culture, to the progress of
people's betterment which we call
civilization, and to adjust one's relationship
accordingly. The evidence
is overwhelming that all the national
ideologies such as Fascism and Naziism,
the Japanese form which provides
a god-emperor, and the Spanish
variant with a caudillo who goes
to Mass between mass executions, are
all fundamentally reactionary, that
is, they intend going backward not

forward, they plan a retreat from the
battlefields which civilization has
won after many centuries and many
defeats, the most notable one being
called the Dark Ages. This is logical.
The proponent of the ideology of reaction
for our time, the originator of
Fascism, himself, declared (in Gerarchia,
March 1923) that Fascism is
not afraid to call itself reaction as
well as anti-democratic and anti-
libertarian.

As for the German form, or Naziism,
we know it too well by its deeds
to need any declarations, nevertheless
there are instances where words speak
louder than actions; thus, when Hans
Johst, the president of the Poets
Academy, says that "when I hear the
word culture, I pick up my revolver,"
he tells us all we need to know about
the New Germany. 

New Spain has become the oldest
Spain, the Spain of the burning of
books, of the Index Expurgatorius
(which existed only there and never
in Rome), the Spain of the complete
elimination of intellectuals, by imprisonment
and murder. Nor is
Portugal, or Japan, or any other reactionary
nation, at war or at peace,
any more interested in spreading culture 
than it is in improving the living
standard of its masses.

The question of the position of 
Soviet Russia vis a vis the Fascist
powers in relations to culture, was
becoming acute just before the Second
European War started: there was
a manifesto by one committee of
"cultural freedom," a counterblast
by a similar league, and finally a
protest against both by 400 unaffiliated
liberals, progressives, trade
unionists etc., who declared that 
"from the viewpoint of cultural freedom,
the difference between the
Soviet Union and the Fascist countries
is most striking. The Soviet
Union has effected one of the most
far-reaching cultural and educational
advances in all history."

In all there were "ten basic points
in which Soviet Socialism differs
from totalitarian Fascism," and because
the first was given as "The
Soviet Union continues always to be
a bulwark against war and aggression,"

the Russian trade pact with
the abominable German Fascism became
a bombshell in the intellectual
dovecotes. It blew several of the birds
right out into the raw, where they
now sing alone, friendless, their song
of self-pity; others have dropped into
more friendly nests, one or two have
joined the merchants of "confessions,"
and all, without exception,
have been "attacked" by friend and
foe, who demand a clarification of
position. The 400 who signed the
statement that Russia was different
from Germany have now been asked
to repudiate it; and even a greater
uproar prevails in political circles.

In all this hysteria and confusion
the most formidable weapon against
errors of every kind, Reason, has
found little employment. There has
been a leaping from trains and ships
and dovecotes, and a retirement to
naval affairs, but no great recourse
to reason, since reasoning takes considerable
time. Admitting that history
moves onward with a greater
tempo every century, and that today
it is at its fastest, many of our confused
intellectuals have done their
leaping before their looking, they
have not waited for the express trains
of world destiny to arrive at any stations
in the long and difficult road
between reactions and progress.

Nevertheless, reason still requires
us to continue to apply the tests of
culture, of civilization, to the philosophies
or ideologies of all the nations
now engaged in the war, and not to
engage in mental Blitzkrieg, just because
history itself moves like lightning.
In a few weeks or a few months
something tremendous may come out
of the struggle in Europe: the destruction
of many anti-cultural ideologies,
the liberations of peoples, a
great upsurge in civilization. History
will move relentlessly, unaffected by
our mental jitterbugs.
