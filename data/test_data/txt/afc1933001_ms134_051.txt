Dear Mrs. Petersen: 

                 I am sorry to trouble you with my folk
songs when you are so busy, but I discovered
twenty miles down the road that I had left some
recordings in your office. Would you be so kind
as to forward them to me here as soon as it is
convenient? You will find a frank enclosed.

                 Let me take this occasion to thank you
and your whole school for a most delightful
weekend. With very best regards, I am

                                                          Sincerely yours,

                                                          ________________
