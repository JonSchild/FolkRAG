Roll 53 In the house of Stan Hicks 1

(greetings)

Stan: Good to see you again! I guess it was the day I told you about my
catfish dinner one time. Didn't? Well, I'll tell you about that. When
I went to school, back in those days dad didn't want us to go fishin' much,
but I slipped off. I went to the river, you probably crossed it comin' on,
and I caught these fish throwin' them out on the bank. And I caught this
catfish, about that long. And layed him on the bank, he go "kuku, kuku"
layin' there you know. So I got him and took him on home, put it in water
for a little while and then took it out. Got him where it didn't want to
stay in water! And I put a little 'strainer 'round its neck, and it would
follow me to school, you know, goin "kuku, kuku", late at school...

AL: Talkin' catfish...

Stan: Yeah, there had broke a boulder out on the bridge where the road went
across the old (unint.) and stuff, and I went across this bridge goin' to
school and my 'strainer got loose. And I went back to see what happened to
my catfish, and you know what had happened? It fell right down thru that
hole where the boulder broke off and got drownded! (laughter)

AL: You've just met Stanley Hicks, He's from the Hicks family, who have
given us so many folk tales, lived here in these Smokey Mountains for about
two hundred years.

Stan: Yeah, I'd say something' like that.

AL: And he's the very essence of the home-made hand-me-down make-do culture
that has made these mountains into a home for people for a long time, and
which has created the mountain culture which is so important to America
today, the Appalachia culture, it's been called "hillbilly" sometimes...

Stan: Yeah, been called hillbillies

AL: Been called a lot of different things, but now your travelin' all over
