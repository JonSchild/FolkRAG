       uncle, and he started playing the fiddle.  I remember we
       was talking about Dio[Dayou] Langley, and Dewey his brother.
       They was staying around Basile in the wood.  They always

       or, but they all the time had some violins.  My uncle got
       one, they had a bunch of violins.  Nobody had any money so
       my grandpa and my uncle, they went down there.  So my grandpa
       told Dio [Dayou] (?), he want a violin, but he had no money until

      black men playing the accordion they would charge two and a half
      to dance, $2.50, and whenever I'd play with my daddy he'd give
      me 50c, which was a lot of money to me!  It's just like I told
      my children, when I first started working, I remember I worked for
