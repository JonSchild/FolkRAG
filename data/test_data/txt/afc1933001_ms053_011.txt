Mr. John A. Lomax
1618 Avenue Y
Lubbock, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was sorry to find that you had to leave Washington before
my return. I hope that you had a pleasant trip back to Texas.

We received a "marvellous" letter from Mr. Greene and I expect
to make good use of it soon. The Librarian saw it and was very
pleased with it. I believe that further cooperation with the
B. B. C. should be encouraged in every way possible. My only suggestion
for you would be that in the future, when you make any
arrangements in my absence, please do so through Mr. Waters. He
serves as acting-chief when I'm away and has full authority to
take charge. I mention this, not as a criticism, but only because
I find no list of the records which were sent. The messenger who
sent the records says that he has the list at home "in his other
suit."

I heard from Alan the other day. He seems to be straightening
his affairs after all and rounding out a very successful trip.

My hope of being able to coordinate the various WPA folk-song
projects is slowly taking shape. In case something turns up, would
you be willing to put on the old harness and do a couple of short
trips for us?

Regards to all!

Sincerely,

Chief, Division of Music
