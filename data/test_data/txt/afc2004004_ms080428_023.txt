                                      livelihood. He knows all the 
                                      herbalism of the mountains, when I 
                                      first went to see him, his whole 
                                      yard was filled with orange 
                                      Sassaphras bark, it was almost knee

                                      hunted what they call Seng or Gin 
                                      Seng which is the root that the

                                      Southern mountains since the early

INTERVIEWER                The other thing about the Hicks's, 
                                      or particularly about Ray, but about 
                                      all of them is that, and mountain
                                      people in general is that 
                                      extraordinary capacity for 
                                      imagination and fantasy they have. 
                                      Do you want to talk about that a

                                      brought with them this rich heritage 
                                      from the whole of Britain and put it
                                      together into one living changing 
                                      tradition with streaks and stripes
