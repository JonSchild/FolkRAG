New York 12, New York

Dear Mr. Lomax:
     Thank you for informing me of the present address of
Mrs. Bessie Jones.  You are right in your thought that we would
not wish to pay the round-trip travel expenses of this lady from
the west coast.
     Therefore, and with regret, I think we should cancel this
engagement.  If she is again in the eastern half of the U.S.A. it
may be that we can arrange a time for her another school year.
     I appreciate greatly your interest in Mrs. Jone's career
and I wish we might have had this singer with us this year.
Sincerely yours,
Louis Smith
Dean of the College
