Mr. Alan Lomax,

Dear Alan:

I have before me your check dated December 6, 1941 payable to
our Lecture Bureau. This check is in the sum of $25. and has 
been returned from the bank with the notation "Exceeds drawer's
balance".

This check covers our comission on your Newark, New Jersey
engagement of October 6, 1941.

I would appreciate your mailing me another check immediately to 
cover this one, and I will return this one to you.

I should also like to call your attention to the fact that you
owe us the sum of $20. for publicity. I would also appreciate
your sending this amount on to me as quickly as possible.

Cordially,

Merritt H. Coleman.
