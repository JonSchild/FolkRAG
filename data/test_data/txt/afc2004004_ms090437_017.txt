That farmer went back to the merchant
Merchant, I'll tell you a certainly fact
Best way to kill a boll weevil
Well, gimme a cotton sack
                               -------I'll have a time
Then the farmer went to the merchant,
"Merchant, I won't have no mo
Done et up all my cotton, 
[And] Done started on my cotton.
That Farmer says "now boll weevil,
You are doing him wrong,
Eatin [up] all of his cotton
And startin on his corn."
                ---------------
"The farmer went to the boll weevil
Says "B w, where in the world yo home"
"I stays over in Texas,
won't be here very long
                  ------ Got to have a time
That farmer went out in the field one mornin'
That boll weevil's flyin in the air,
Went out there this evenin'
Done moved his fam'ly there
                  -------- Havin a time.
