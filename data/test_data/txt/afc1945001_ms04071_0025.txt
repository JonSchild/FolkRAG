[Rumor heard in a factory in Denver during the conversation
of two of the workers:] 
"Just how much money is Uncle Sam getting on these war 
bonds from people who are pledging a certain percent of their 
salary, etc.? People are quitting this company so fast that it 
seems if you have worked here only a short time you are considered 
an old timer. When they leave they go to the cashier and say, "I 
have a certain amount coming to me; I was going to buy a war bond 
with it but I am leaving so give me my money", and the cashier 
gives them the money that was intended to purchase a bond."
