THE WOMAN'S FIGHT
(Melody - Juniata)

Soft may she slumber on the breast of Mother Earth,
One who worked nobly for the world's rebirth.
In the heart of woman, dwells a wish to heal all pain,
Let her learn to help man to cast off each chain.

CHORUS: Woman, oh, woman, leave your fetters in the past;
Rise and claim your birthright and be free at last.

Mother, wife and maiden, in your hands great power lies;
Give it all to freedom, strength and sacrifice.
Far across the hilltop breaks the light of coming day,
Still the fight is waiting, then be up and away.


ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT

Comrades, though so dark and dreary, all through the night,
Hope of day inspires the weary, all through the night,
Though the hours be full of sorrow, doubts and fears we shall not borrow,
Fix our hopes upon the morrow, all through the night.

Comrades, brave are aye beside us, all through the night,
Freedom's star shall ever guide us, all through the night,
Dark the clouds may linger o'er us,
Yet the future's bright before us,
Let us swell the Worker's Chorus, all through the night.

Slav'ry's chains will all be broken, after the night,
Brotherhood the sign and token, after the night,
Freedom shall our bonds dissever,
From the tyrant's yoke deliver,
Peace on earth shall reign forever, after the night.
