ya know.  Anything I had to have, anything, she could have, see?
But not knowin' that she was jealous a her an' her -- She had
one daughter an' Melton had a bunch of 'em.  I stayed with 'em
ya know, with they children.  An' hope (helped), hope 'em take
care of 'em, in an' out.  On the farm I hope an' in the towns
I hope.  An' so. . .I have worked for 'em, weeks at a time.  You
know, jus' to he'p 'em 'cause they good peoples an' dey needed
he'p.  (SEE MUCH EARLIER TAPE GIVING FULL STORY OF HOW MAMA AND CASSIUS &
BESSIE DISCOVERED AND ADOPTED THE LARGE AND IMPOVERISHED MELTON FAMILY)
     But anyway, when I got back there this  time, - I hadn't seen 'em in a long time - an' there
Pinkey was.  She had -- didn' -- she knowed me but she didn't act
like it.  You didn't. . .Tony said, "Pinkey," said, "Don't you
know Bess?"
     "Yeah. . . heee. . .yeah.  I seee Bess."  You know, that jus' be,
she was jus' crazy!  She was steppin' in it, oh boy!  Her hair,
used to have long hair; jus' all gummy up an' jus'. . .you know,
don't let nobody comb it, you know.  Her han's was jus' turrible.
When she go to eat, she'd buck up in a corner, turn up in the corner, 
buck up in it, ya know.  Take 'er food an' eat like that, ya
know.  Oh, it's sinful to see the chil' in that condition!  An' knowin',
know, it, it's jus' all foolishness.
      An' they sit an' tol' me the matters an' the things that
had happened.  They had been to these seven sisters in, in Columbius,
(sic), Georgia, ya know.  Them seven sisters there, they call 'em?
Them white women?  An' they cold 'er definitely who done it.  Tol'
'em to (?) for 'er, for 'em not to know it was her, see?  An'
all like that.  An' they yet but they didn' know nothin' ta do,
ya see?  An' on an' on, so?  They jus', jus' worked an' worked.
