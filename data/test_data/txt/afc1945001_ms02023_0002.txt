Bureau of Intelligence Report No. 6
8/8/42

Owing to the presence of Mr. Hamblet, Mr. 
Seacrest, and Mr. Carey very little could be done 
upon this report Friday and Saturday.  However, your
attention is directed to the Supplement which follows 
the material reported, which will indicate that rumors 
are relatively rare in Florida, and that in all probability 
very little was missed.
