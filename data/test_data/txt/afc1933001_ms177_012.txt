Dear Sir:
     We are interested in obtaining a photograph of Alan Lomax
making a recording in a mountain cabin and we understand that he is
at present working in the Great Smokies, and in the country around
Asheville, North Carolina. Will you give us his address at present, 
and also tell us where he will be for the next few weeks, so that we
may put a photographer in touch with him? Also, do you know if Mrs. 
Lomax or his father is assisting him on this trip?

Sincerely yours,
