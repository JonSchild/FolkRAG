For the gathering of data, a feasible division of labor
between the cooperative agencies would be:

(1) The Research and Analysis Branch of the Office of the 
Coordinator of Information to note the genesis and
spread of Axis-inspired rumors in foreign countries;
abstracting foreign newspapers and periodicals, and
making use of available radio monitoring reports,
and of such oral and ephemeral data as can be acquired.
These materials to be noted, in the course
of their work for other purposes, by the several
sections of the Division of Special Information;
and the file of abstracts collated by the Research
Section of the Division of Psychology.

(2) The Bureau of Intelligence of the Office of Facts 
and Figures to make and collate abstracts from selected 
United States newspapers and radio transcriptions, 
relating to the same selection of rumors.

Note: For the study of current rumors the same procedure
would be followed as in the case of
past ones, with the addition that the Office of the
Coordinator of Information would supply the Office
of Facts and Figures whenever possible with tips on
the appearance of embryonic rumors, together with
comment as to their possible motivation; machinery
to be set up in the Office of Facts and Figures to
watch for these rumors as they appear in this country.
An efficient division of function must be worked out
between the two agencies for studying the actual
process of transmission into the United States.

(3) The Civilian Morale Service of the Office of Education
to collect data on rumors currently in circulation,
from Rumor Clinics organized in colleges
and universities in all regions of the United States;
to maintain the central file for the correlation of
its own data with materials transmitted to it by the
Office of Facts and Figures and the Office of the 
Coordinator of Information; and in turn to pass on
to these agencies information received from Rumor
Clinics.
