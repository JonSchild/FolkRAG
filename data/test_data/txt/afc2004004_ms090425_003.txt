Rock Daniel
(Rev. C. H. Savage & congregation.  Mt. Ararat Baptist Church,
Clarksdale, Mississippi.  1941)
[Now, first I'm] Christian friends, we're gonna sing one of the old [specials] spirituals, one of the old-time 
songs that my grandmother taught me to sing long time ago.  And I
would like for ev rybody to sing with uplifted voice.  We are now in 
Cornwall County in the Mt. Ararat Baptist Church of Reverend Law.
I am quite sure Reverend Law would enjoy this number.
I'm gonna tell my Lord, Daniel.
I'm gonna tell my Lord, Daniel.
I'm gonna tell my Lord, Daniel.
I'm gonna tell my Lord, Daniel.

How you do me here, Daniel.
How you do me here, Daniel.
How you do me here, Daniel.
How you do me here, Daniel.

Put on your [Wabash] warfare shoes, Daniel.
Put on your warfare shoes, Daniel.
Put on your warfare shoes, Daniel.
Put on your warfare shoes, Daniel.

Slip and slide [to see] street, Daniel.
Slip and slide street, Daniel.
Slip and slide street, Daniel.

[Slip in on the Mount] This ain none of my home, Daniel.
This ain none of my home, Daniel.
