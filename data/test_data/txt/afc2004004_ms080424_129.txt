have gotten tired and the rabbits have hidden out, but we're here
telling stories,  One of the things I think is interesting here
is that this is. . .I'm here with my cronies from the region around
Kansas. .  . and Tallapoosa, the famous Tallapoosa Georgia, the
gold mining town, the home of the legendary S Lovergood, the
fathers of American humor, is just a little bit away from us.
That's where Doodle Thrower comes from.  And this is Ernest
Ingram,. . . .what do you do for a living, Mr. Ingram?
Mr. Ingram:  I'm retired. Rabbit hunt and fish is about all I
do.
AL:  This is Rev. Lawler. . . . .The gentlemen here is Rev. Lawler,
he's been a preacher for 31 years, isn't that right?  Well, you
know, my daddy was raised out here in country like this, in
Texas, and he told me when he was a boy that it was considered
kind of sinful even to go fishing on a Sunday, much less hunt.
Was that ever true here in Georgia?
Rev:  Well, that was true here, too. I don't run my dogs on Sun.
AL:  But it was considered that people shouldn't have tha t kind
of fun. . . .Maybe even on Sat-- the real strict folks.  When
did those rules begin to relax here?
Rev:  Well, I guess since WWII.
AL:  Did you ever consider it was sinful to hunt rabbits?
Rev:  No, I raise 'em.  My father was a preacher.  He didn't go
rabbit hunting.   . . . . . . .After WWII I started out with beagle hounds,
got me some beagle hounds, really, all the things that we do
