More than thirty years before
that moment Dirk had sung
that song, unforgettably, to me in
the Brazos Bottom in Texas.
I had never heard it since though
Professor George Lyman Kittredge had told
me that same student from the South
had given him the words: (Quote them
entire from Am. Ballads & Folk Songs). On
enquiry I found that Vera Hall
had never [stopped] understood
their real significance. She
had been carried away by the lyrical
beauty of the lines and by the
mournful sweetness of the music.
