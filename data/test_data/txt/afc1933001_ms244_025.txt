with these modern machines the records should not be practically
perfect.

The stuff about Bessie Smith is interesting, and it looks
like you won the argument, although I can't be sure whether or
not Bessie was refused admission to the white hospital before
she was admitted to the Negro one. I am sending the documents
to Sterling Brown and from there will return them to you.

These days are full of hard driving work, and you must
forgive me for writing so infrequently. Give my love to
Deanie and send my love to John, Shirley and the children.

Devotedly,

Alan
