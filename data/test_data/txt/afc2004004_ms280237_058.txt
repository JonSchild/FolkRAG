7.
used to fly to the pubs at night. I never have got mixed in
with none of 'em at all. No more, just for. . .not for years.
An' I wish I'd kept away from 'em then. I think I ha' felt so.
I agree with the old man. He say, "You keep same as yourself - 
same as you are now, you'll be better off." "Look how," he used
to say, "I ha' been muddled throughout life." (laughs)
Lomax: Tell me, when did you get married, Harry?
Cox: Oh, I ha' been married about twenty - twenty six year since
I got married. They've all got married very young.
Lomax: How did you meet your wife.
Cox: Well, I knew her afore. I had some fruit there. She used
to come an' pick it. Gather the fruit. That's how we sort of 
got more - in line. (pause)
Lomax: What was her single name, Harry?
Cox: Her name was Elsie Ames.
Lomax: Elsie Amos. Was she a blonde?
Cox: The only girl in the family.
Lomax: Was she a good looking girl?
Cox: Oh, she wasn't too bad.
Lomax: Blonde? Blue eyed?
Cox: Oh, I don't know. I ha' seen her eyes many times. I don't
take much count o' eyes. What colour they are.
Lomax: What do you look at in a person's face when you look at
them?
Cox: Well, you know, I just see. . .well, just how they look, an'
that's all. Whether they're good lookin' or bad lookin',
thin or sharp, or anything else like that. That's all I - I
study.
