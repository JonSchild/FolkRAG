BJ: I walked [in] the woods, when I was lil', an' I walk 'em, since --
I'd [I] walk 'em now, [but] if I could; but 'round them places like
where I live at now, I don't care where you go, somebody in the
woods, you know [an all] that kinda thing. An' peoples'll 'cuse you a all
kinda things now, but I love the woods. I like to go out an'
sit out an' dig herbs. If not just sit an' talk to myself an'

I don't worry much.
