I were both disappointed by the coal camps. Her contacts on 
Straight Creek, near Paintsville and around Middlesborough 
did produce the best material I have so far collected but one 
had the feeling about it that it was somewhat forced and artificial. 
Since then all the singers and fiddlers I have talked to have been 
sick or had a death in the family or there has been some other 
good and obvious reason why they couldn't sing or perform. I have 
before had such streaks of bad luck and for that reason I'm certain 
that things can't go on forever like this. I feel sure 
that up and down Beech Fork and Red Bird, under the aegis of 
Miss Breckenridge whose Frontier Nursing Service covers the same 
territory, that I shall at last find the people I have been looking 
for.

My mailing address until I advise you to the contrary 
will be General Delivery, Hyden Ky. . I would greatly appreciate 
your advising the Disbursement Office of this fact so that my 
salary check and my vouchers reach me without delay. I will 
send you another letter in a week's time and let you know what 
my progress in Leslie County has been.

Thanking you for your promptness in regard to the parts 
for the recording machine, I am,

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
