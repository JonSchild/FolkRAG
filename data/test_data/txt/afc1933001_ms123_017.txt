Dr. John Baer Stoudt
1054 Tilchman Street
Allentown, Pennsylvania

Dear Dr. Stoudt:

Mr. Strunk resigned on June 30, so I am taking the liberty 
of answering your letter addressed to him. Inquiry at
the Government Printing Office reveals that the plates used for
illustrations in the report are not retained for such a long
period of time. I suggest, therefore, that you reproduce the
illustration from the report itself or from the original. If
you do not have a copy of the 1927 report, I shall be glad to
send you one.

Your suggestion that we record the songs of the Pennsylvania-
Dutch is a very good one. The collection in our Archive 
of American Folk Song is growing very rapidly, and we should
very much like to include the songs of Pennsylvania. Mr. Alan
Lomax is now a regular member of our staff and he hopes to be
able to make a systematic series of trips. His present plans
will keep him busy until late in the fall, but a trip to Pennsylvania
might be arranged as soon thereafter as possible. I
shall recommend this to Mr. Lomax, who, I am sure, will be glad
to take advantage of your kind offer to cooperate with us.

With kindest regards,

Very sincerely yours,

Acting Chief, Division of Music
