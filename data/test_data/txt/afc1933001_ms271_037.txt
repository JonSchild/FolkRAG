RUN HITLER RUN

Hitler run, Hitler flew;
Run by intuition, and horse sense too.

Chorus: Run Hitler, run, the Allies will get you;
Run Hitler, run, you'd better get away.

Hitler and Goebbels jumped the creek,
Ain't nobody seen 'em since a way last week.

Mussolini and Hitler playing cards,
Hitler won the pot, Mussolini took it hard.

Yonder goes Hitler hard as he can tear,
One jump ahead of a big red bear.

Hitler boy, you really better jump;
Allies are coming from the back and the front.

Hitler got drunk and stayed out all night.
'Cause the Soviet women didn't treat him right.

One thing sure and this I know,
It's come Mister Hitler's time to go.

The Fascist boys are double tough,
But they just ain't quite tough enough.

Gonna get me a machine gun ten foot long,
Play to little Adolph all night long.
