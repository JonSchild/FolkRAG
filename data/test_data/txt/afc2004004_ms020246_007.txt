AIN'T IT HARD TO BE A FARMER
"Just a song"

REFRAIN:    Ain't it hard, hard, hard to be a farmer,
A farmer, farmer, farmer, 
Ain't It hard, hard, hard,
You can't get our money when it's due.

You know. a farmer an' a white man was workin'
by the day, 
They goes out soon but they gets in late,
The white man takes up the farmer's time, 
Always leave po' farmer behind.          (REFRAIN)

You know, a farmer an' a white man was walkin'
'cross the field, 
The farmer stumbled up on the white man's heels,
The white man cussed an' the farmer grinned, 
He knocked the po' farmer und his chin.          (REFRAIN)

You know a farmer an' a white man was workin'
on the freight,
They goes out soon but they gets in late,
The white man takes up the farmer's time, 
Always leaves po' farmer behind.          (REFRAIN   2)
