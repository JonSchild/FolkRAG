ROLL 2    13

And the lark with its nest in the 
ganders beard. 
And the waterhen crooning and
playing the Jews Harp.
And the church, leaping and dancing
all over the valley.

So, what of our first song?

Yankee doodle came to town, 
Riding on a pony,
Stuck a feather in his cap, 
And called it Macaroni.

[*Old Zip Coon*]
[*Frontier Surrealism*]
A typical piece of Celtic nonsense
and another one:

Oh there once as a man with a double
chin.
For one was skilled on a violin,
He played in time and he played in
tune.
And he couldn't play anything but 
"Old Zip Coon".
"Old Zip Coon" he played all day,
till the ladies ran away, he played
and he played by the light of the
moon and the only tune was "Old Zip
Coon".

And so on, there was thousands of 
these and so on, this was what 
happened on the frontier and I think
it is because really on the frontier
