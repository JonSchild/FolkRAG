LOVES FOLK TUNES
Wife of Uncle Davey Once 
Sang Ballads Herself
By VIRGINIA DICKENS
"Jaybird up the 'simmon tree,
 'Possum on the ground . . ."
    Five pairs of feet beat out the 
rhythm, the light from the oil 
lamp flickered cheerfully on the 
Farmer's Almanac hanging on the 
sealed pine wall by the bureau, and 
Mrs. Davey Crockett Ward, ample 
and motherly in the starched green 
and white-checked apron she had 
made herself, rocked and nodded 
in time to the beats of the banjo. 
     Mrs. Ward is the wife of "Uncle 
Crockett," who plays second fiddle 
with the Bog Trotters, the Galax, 
Va., five-piece string band which 
will be heard Tuesday throughout 
the nation in a programs of "The 
American School of the Air," a 
Columbia Broadcasting System feature, 
originating for that day in 
the studious of WDBJ at Roanoke. 
Play for Visitors
    The Bog Trotters had tuned up 
their instruments in the W a r d 
home and were giving their visitors 
a sample of the square dance 
tunes they will play for the nation
over the Columbia network 
Tuesday.
     Mrs. Ward was something of a 
vocalist herself in her younger days, 
she confided to us when we questioned 
her; her father was a fiddler, 
in the days when corn huskings 
and quilting bees were community 
frolics, and the young folks 
really enjoyed themselves. S h e 
used to take quite a hand in the 
fun then, but now, with five grown
children and several grandchildren, 
she lets the men folks do the playing 
and singing, and she watches 
and listens, with a pride she cannot 
quite hide, to the voice of her 
tall young son. There's one little 
dark-eyed granddaughter who can 
sing, too, and who can hardly keep 
her baby feet still when the music's 
a going . 
        It had been a long cold ride over 
the snow-covered country roads, but 
any discomfort we might have felt 
was quickly dispelled by the sincerity 
of the hospitality and the 
warmth of the greeting with which 
we were received by out hosts, who 
not only made us welcome to their 
fireside, but were concerned over 
whether we had had out suppers, 
and urged us to stay the night instead 
of taking the long drive home 
over the mountain. And we, who
have lived so long among city 
streets and office buildings that 
we had almost forgotten how to 
be neighborly, were completely
charmed with the simplicity and 
friendliness of these good folk, and 
settled down to make friends in 
good truth.
Music Hath Charms
We admired a lovely piece of
crocheting which served as a tidy
for the chair on which sat Uncle
Alec, another member of the band,
and were rewarded by a lamplighted
peek into a side room where the
two grandchildren slept through
all the music and laughter outside.
"They're as much at home here as
with their own mother,: said Mrs.
Ward, leaning over to tuck the covering

Fields Ward (above) guitarist in the "Bog Trotters," is the youngest
member of the group.  He is the son of Uncle Crockett Ward, and he calls
figures for the dance tunes and sings many of the old ballads as the
group plays for entertainments or for their own pleasure.  All these
pictures were taken in the front room at Uncle Crockett's home.
Hill Folk Learn to Sing 
and Play as Youngsters
 The music which the "Bog Trotters" will play on Columbia's American
School of the air from the studios of Roanoke radio station WDBJ
Tuesday is not something those mountain folk have learned as city
people learn music.
Though most of, it not all, the members of the "Bog Trotters"" can
read music and play their instruments from sight, they all took up
playing and singing as youngsters.  It is as much a part of their life
as breathing and eating, as natural a form of expression as talking.
Learn as Children
They learned to play and to sing
in the family and neighborhood
"infairs," when, as children, they
would sit on the floor and listen to
the older folks as they sang a ballad
and reminisced about the big
affair at Cousin Joe's house when
Uncle George sang that song.  At
those intimate gatherings, when
the little houses seemed full to
bursting, yet always there was
room for more and yet room left
for a turn or two of dancing in
the middle of the floor, the music
of the mountain  people is in its
native setting.  Through such gatherings
it is preserved, handed down
from generation to generation.
Every Town Has Fiddler
Every community must have
a fiddler.  It has been so from the
days of the earliest settlements-
not only in the Appalachian mountains 
of the East, but all over the
continent.  As the years pass, other
fiddlers come along, and the banjo
and guitar and various forms of
the dulcimer, such as the auto-harp 
in the "Bog Trotters," are
added and you have a little band.
So the "Bog Trotters," grew, and so
have grown up in almost every
community of Southwest Virginia
one or more similar groups-more 
recently referred to, unfortunately,
as "string bands."
Along with the music at these
"infairs" of the mountain folk goes
the telling of tales, and the members
of the "Bog Trotters" are
adept at that, too.
Particularly so is Uncle Alec
Dunford, whose inimitably slow
drawl, and Scotch dialect mixed
with the accent peculiar to the


people of that section makes his
story telling particularly delightful.
He tells Some Tales
Uncle Alec will tell some of his
best stories-retold many times but
improved by every telling-with a
little encouragement.  There's the
one about the thriftless fiddler,
one of the best because the mountain 
folk hold no virtue in higher
regard than that of thrift.
"Dowahn the river," Uncle Alec
starts slowly, "thar was a man and
his son that didn't do anything
but set an' play the fiddle an' the
banjo all day long, when they
oughta been tendin' their place.
Just above them live a feller who
was thrifty; he always liked to 
see his cattle well fed and his
children well clothed.  One day he
went down to the neighbor place,
and he saw the folks a-playin,'
and when he come back he said:
"'Thar they sets all day, a-goin'
k'jadiper, k'jadiper, k'jadiper, k'jadiper
on the fiddle and ping-a-tung 
ping-a-tung, ping-a-tung on
the banjo, an' never a sign of a 
tune nor a morsel o'bread in the
house'."
Made Old Recording
Many a man and woman in the 
United States knows the old Irish
ballad of "Barney McCoy' and his
touching farewell to his sweetheart
as he left Ireland for the new country.
Most of them know it, however,
in Uncle Alec Dunford's own version,
minus "that thar classic
whandg" it has acquired in the New
York music halls before it came to
Uncle Alec.
