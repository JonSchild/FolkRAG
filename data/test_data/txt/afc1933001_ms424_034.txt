SANTA LUCIA
(Italy)

(Page 49 - One Hundred Folk Songs of All Nations)

Now 'neath the silver moon ocean is glowing,
O'er the calm billow soft winds are blowing,
Here balmy breezes blow, pure joys invite us
And as we gently row all things delight us.
Hark, how the sailor's cry, joyously echoes nigh
Santa Lucia! Santa Lucia!



O, SOLE MIO!
(Italy)

(Sheet Music - Jack Mills, Inc.N.Y.C.)

How lovely is the sun in all its radiance.
How sweet the morning air the storm departing
How fresh the breezes, fast the storm pursuing.
O, lovely sun, thy glorious warmth imparting!

Chorus: I know a sun bright laughing at me,
Dear heart, now hear me, that sun is thee
Thine eyes so dear to me,
Ah! shall my bright sun forever be!

Soft comes the twilight, love, the sun is setting.
A sadness comes to me, my heart o'erflowing,
Under thy window while the darkness deepens,
O, bid the sun once more a fond good-night!

Chorus:
