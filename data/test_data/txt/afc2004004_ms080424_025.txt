Tape:  Roll 44 Stan and Ray Hicks   2

(Ray) little women that they had hired(?). . . . Now, he got caught in
the rain, and got lost in the woods, and hit dark.  And he was a
feelin' his way, tryin' to find some way to save his life in that
rain. . .And he got down, and finally seed a little light, way down
in a hollow. . . .and he crawled and pulled, with no light and got 
there and hollered. .  And a little woman came out and said, "Oh
my God!  Son, you'll be killed, this is a highway robber's house.
They kill everyone that comes here and dead peoples tells no tales!"
Well, he said, "This rain, but dang, a runnin' don't the back of
my neck!  And oh my God I'd just assume they kill me than drown
out here!"  Well, she says "Come on in, then, come on in."
Well that's theway it started off now.
Stan:  Well I heared it the way my grandpa it. . .it was about the
same as that you know. . .
AL:  Tell us, start off with another one. . .go ahead, . . .Stanley.
Stan:  Well, you told it the way that one started off, and then, Jack,
he was a pretty much smart in a way.  He was a smart character in
a way, and in a way he was dumb, like myself. . .
Ray:  Yeah. . .
Stan:  But he was always goin' out these things, you know, and he'd go
out here, and get into this, .  So Jack, he was goin' along the
road one day, and he was starvin', he didn't have nothin' to eat
and he was goin' along the road huntin' for somethin' to eat.
. . . .so, he got to lookin', and came a paddle(??) you know, and 
he (unint.) and he come up with this butterfly, you know, a great
big bunch in the mud.  And he go out and killed a bunch of 'em.
Ray:  Yeah, that's in a different tale than I started.
Stan:  Yeah, that's a different one, but that's the way you start that
