looked at me.  Jus' looked me up an' down.  An' he start from
my feet, an' he didn't stop until he got to the top of my 
head, I believe.  An' he found out.  Yes, suh.  That was sumpin'.
I didn't never -- I'd never had that kind of treatment before
in my life.  The desire to wanta do sumpin' like that.  It was such
[thought, he cares for ] a curious feelin' to me then.  Sure was funny.  I'll never
forget; Mama was gone fishin' -- they fish at night
               ? Willis caught two turtle [called us two] & an' a fish,
[turtles ?)] -- catfish, ha!  Well, that night.  Yes, suh.  See,

Mama'd go off                      they'd be tired, t'me;

an' so, tha's the way I raised mine at, you see.  After my
husband died an' everything, I raised my chilrun up.  An' my
chilrun cain' tell you today they ever see a man pull his shoe
off in my house.  Never.  An' they aint neither, not when they['re]
there.  I tell 'em, the guy -- I had but one guy -- well, two,
however, but one [never with] of them stay with [the] an-other, I say, "You
have to treat my chilrun just like as if they was my own."
"[If you don't do] Without that, I can't go."  An' I meant that.
Because, one day, them boys comin' up, an' they tell me,
"Mr. Soanso was after you bed; Mr. Soanso done soanso to you."
You see?  I don't 'ppreciate that.  An' you know, I got along 
that way.  I did.   I had -- you know, this guy I went with -- [Melvin?]
[*Maryland lover-- after George died.  last lover "in a way of speaking" last one liked*]
[Miller] Nichols -- he had a big poultry farm, you know, he had much

sold milk.  I didn't want the milk in the bottle.  He had,
hawgs you know, by the oodles, this wide, [having so much fat] have em be
so fat he have to cut all the meat off it to get to it.  The 
Lord have bless me to comin' with that type of person, you
know.  An' so, I jus' have what I want.  An' my chilrun
would work for him.  In the fiel', you know, for him.  An'
he pay them.  They figure they helpin' take care of me, you
see?  An' he pay them, for the work.  I worked in factories
an' different things of that type, too.  But he gave me a great,
big stove.  An' I tol' th e chilrun Joe & George [to go out] to work it out,
you see.  So he said that stove was ten dollars.  An' he paid
them -- he'd take out the money, ya know, like he takin' it
outa their work, ya see.  He'd get the men; I'd [get the  ?]
