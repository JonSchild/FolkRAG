" I'll be ready for your coming, and I'll keep the fires all 
bright,
And I'll have your room all ready when Sam begins to fight.
For I can see your days are numbered, and there's nothing 
left to tell,
So hang up your phone, get your hat, and meet me here in 
Hell." 32

Some of the literature of the present day plantation Negro exists 
in the form of ballads. These ballads recount a tragic event relative 
to the lives of individuals in the community or may be a re-interpretation 
of an outside occurrence in terms of the local experience.

Examples of these ballads are as follows:
Have you ever heard the song of Mary Steward?
On Saturday evening about two o'clock
Had to go to the ball to see that man
Buck Bliss throwed up
Will People knowed
He jumped behind Mary Steward
And she caught the load. 33.

The next ballad "Frankie and Albert" or "Frankie and Johnny" has been of national fame. However the particular account provided in this 
area may represent a departure from the original version.

Frankie went down to the corner store
She called for a glass of beer
She asked the bar room tender, has he seen old Albert here
He is my man.

I ain't going tell you no story
And I ain't going to tell you no lie
Albert left here just an hour a go
With a woman called Alice Brice
He is your man, but he done you wrong

Frankie went down to the dancing hall
Found old Albert there
He was setting down in some cheap girl's lap
He show was buying some beer
He is my man, but he done me wrong
