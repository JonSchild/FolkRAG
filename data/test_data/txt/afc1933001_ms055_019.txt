Mr. Harold Spivacke, Chief
Division of Music
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

    You will remember that the Library of Congress was good
enough to collaborate with us in an important series of programs
on the Negro folk music of this country. You kindly gave us
permission to use many of your recordings for this series, and
the programs were compiled by myself and recorded in New York
for shipment to England. The records which you lent us,
belonging to the Library of Congress, have now been returned.
This series was a most interesting and valuable contribution,
and was only made possible by the collaboration of the Library
of Congress.

    I have this week received a request from my people in
London, wanting to know whether certain of your recordings can
be repeated from the recordings I made and shipped to England,
in connection with a program entitled "Foundations of Jazz."
In this program they are tracing back the development of jazz
to the early days of Negro ballad music, and they naturally
wish to make this program as authentic as possible, and there-
fore would be very grateful indeed if you would allow them to
use again some of the recordings used in the earlier series.

    I need hardly tell you how grateful this Corporation feels
to the Library of Congress for its past cooperation, and hope
that in this instance, too, it will be possible for you to give
us the permission for which we ask.

    Yours sincerely,
    Felix Greene.
    Felix Greene
