MOSES

Moses, Moses, don't you let King Pharoah take you,
Moses, Moses, don't you let King Pharoah take you,
Moses, Moses, don't you let King Pharoah take you,
In some lonesome grave-yard.

Hurrah, hurrah, I hear the chariot comin',
Hurrah, hurrah, I hear the chariot comin',
Hurrah, hurrah, I hear the chariot comin',
In some lonesome grave-yard.

Moses, Moses, I hear the horses runnin',
Moses, Moses, I hear the horses runnin',
Moses, Moses, I hear the horses runnin',
In some lonesome grave-yard.

Hmmmh, hmmh, I hear the chariot rollin'......
Mother, Mother, don't let your daughter condemn you.....
Hmmmh, hmmh, I hear the angles moonin'.....
Jordan, Jordan, let the children over.....
