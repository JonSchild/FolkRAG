Alice Richardson, "Judge".
Our hotel main suggested
that Mrs. Julie Harrison, [wife of]
[Dr. R.W. Harrison, prominent]
[dentist,] could help us find old
singers. Mrs. Harrison is the
wife of a prominent Natchez negro
dentist. Though Mrs. Harrison's 
own church choir sings in
modern style, she understood
what we wanted and referred 
us to several old-time singers,
among them to "Judge", [whos]
An ex-slave, [who] "Judge's" name
is Alice Richardson. She is engaged
every spring to sing old
songs for "pilgrimage" guests.
