PROPOSAL FOR A RURAL COMMUNITY CENTER PROGRAM

Plan        To construct in the South ten rural community centers in the 
fiscal year 1937-38, under the sponsorship of the Department 
of Agriculture, as an experiment and demonstration. If results 
warrant it, and if experience provides a basis for modification, 
it is suggested that the plan be extended each year
for two successive years. 
      These centers will be constructed and operated by a Federal 
agency through an endowment over a period of five years,
at which time the locality will assume responsibility for 
their conduct.
   The direction and planning of such program to provide
for maximum national benefits demands Federal sponsorship.  The 
community centers will be so planned and operated as to represent 
and to continue to demonstrate the educational and
cultural interests of the rural section in which they are placed.
      These community centers are needed in rural areas as public 
facilities of any adequate nature and design are completely 
lacking. They are often needed most in sections where both the 
awareness of the need and the financial resources are almost
negligible.  

Location      The first ten centers will be constructed in locations of
varying conditions and sections of the country, so that a
maximum of experience will result and be the basis for extending 
the plan in the future.
