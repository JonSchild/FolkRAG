Stan:  This is "Chicken a Crowin' in the Sourwood Mountain"(??)  (PLAYS) (sings)
I'll play you the "Bob's Chase"(?) first and then the "Ground Hog."
Now I made this song up, you don't hear it nowheres on the record and hear me
play it.  I used to fox hunt a lot, and I had three dogs, and I took this
(unint.) and stuff and everything got, you know, kinda, . . .work couldn't
(unint.) so I quit, and got rid of my dogs.  One is named "Old Buth", ome
"Crip"(?), one "Old Blue."
AL:  (in background). . . . .Bob chasing. . . . .ride horses. . . . .
Stan:  Yeah, I din't ride horses, they used to, but I had to walk when I hunted. . .
you know, in the mountains.  But down in the low part of the country they
hunted with horses.  I run it here in the mountains, so this year I'll see if
I could get my dogs in. . , they'll go up over thesee Stow(?) Mountains here. . . .
(plays and sings)
AL:  Now listen, you've got to tell me what was happening, you were just sitting
around the fire listening with the boys, weren't ya?. . . .when all that was going
on?
Stan:  No, it's by myself this time!  But we did get out, all of us together and 
hunt, you know, and build up big fires and roast (unint.) and take this marshmallow
candy, and get it hot. . . . . . And the dogs run close to the fire one night
till the fox run right almost in it you know.  We run 'em all around this
mountain, all over in here (unintelligible)
AL:  Did you just sit around the fire and listen to the foxes run?
STan:  Yeah, we just listened to em run, we didn't follow 'em, we just built up
a fire.  And I had a little house that we stayed in for a good long while, you
know, when it was raining.  It come up rainin' and stuff, . . . roast 'taters and
boil turkey eggs and stuff. . . had a good time.
AL:  There weren't any woman with ya, was there?
