Gentlemen: 
Complying with your request to write down songs which had been passed around by "word of mouth" among our girls, I am enclosing herewith some copies.
If such a collection is ever printed, we shall appreciate very much you making it available to us.
Very sincerely yours,
Nell Farrar
Superintendent
