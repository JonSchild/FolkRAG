She did this for a purpose.
     Now, they were searching for the factor, and they thought
this factor ran away with the money - he'd skedaddled away
with the money -- and they were looking for him. So the police
comes to them, and she didn't happen to be in at the time. So
the police asks John if he saw the factor.
He says, "Oh aye. I saw the factor," --- and the poor creature
tells the truth.
And he says, "Are ye sure?"
And he says, "Yes, I saw the factor."
So he says, "What time was this John?" And he tried to tell
him to the best of his ability. And he says, "O but God, man,
I killed the factor." (He kenned he killed the factor, you see.)
So he says, "O ye did? You killed the factor?"
"Oh are. Come on out and I'll let ye see where I buried him."
    But his mother knew he would tell them where he buried him.
That's why she put the goat in the grave where the man was, you
see. So up they goes and the police digs and digs up this goat,
nd the poor, silly lad, he looks down and when he saw it was
the billy goat in the grave the men was put into, he said,
"Good God almighty! He's growed horns and whsikers since I
buried him here last!"
     So of course, when the police saw that, they thought they
were being a bigger fool than the silly laddie. So just then
his mother comes in. . ..
