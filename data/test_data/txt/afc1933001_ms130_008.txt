Dear Barnicle:

    I have just written Chick for an estimate on the
dubbing of your 100 Holiness records and I would like
to have, officially, your confirmation of this project.
Perhaps, in the course of the dubbing job, Chick might
discover that he could improve on the originals in his
duplications for your purposes, which I presume are for
demonstration mainly. In that case, if you like, you can
keep the duplications and we will be only too happy to
gobble up the originals.

    I was beginning work the first of next week on the
duplications that I promised you last winter. The machine
seems to be in good condition at last! I would like to
know what records you need at the moment in your class
work, or whether you will trust me to pick out the most
exciting things from the whole collection. Do you want
complete renditions of folk songs or would you prefer to
have more material in slightly abbreviated form? Please
write me your notions about these matters.

    I have started my class at the Federal Workers' School
and it seems to be a success. The first evening, the class
learned eight songs that were new to them and roared them
out very lustily. I wish we had had a chance to talk more
about your classes, because I need all the good advice that a
anybody can give me. The one thing that I do very much need at
at the moment are your Georgia and Bahama notes, and if you
are not using them soon, would you lend them to me for six
weeks so that I can have them typed and put where they belong
- with the records.

    Give my best regards to your Kentucky tribe and to Mar-
garet. Yours with much love,
