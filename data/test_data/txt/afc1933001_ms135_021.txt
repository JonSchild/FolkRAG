Music                     Office of the Librarian
                                [*July 8/38*]

Louise Caton,
Secretary.

I append copies of Music Division reports for 1933-1938 wherein 
the recent activities of the Archive of American Folk Song are 
discussed.  You will find, besides, a mimeographed check-list 
of the recorded items brought into the Archive before November, 
1937.  You will note that there is a great deal of Southern White 
folk song material in the body of the collection and recently 
this type has been greatly augmented through extensive collections 
from Eastern Kentucky, Western Virginia, Southern Ohio and Southern 
Indiana.  Part of this material has been deposited with restrictions 
of between 2 to 5 years, but the large mass of it is open.

If any further and more detailed information is desired, I shall 
be delighted to furnish it.
