Dear Mr. Lomax:
Attached is a letter received from Dr. Max Krone of the
Idyllwild Arts Foundation extending an invitation to Bessie
Jones and the group.  This invitation was extended at the
suggestion of Bess Hawes.
It seemed to us that this offer might well fit in with the
Newport Festival, although somewhat more money might be
available from Idyllwild.  We would, however, prefer that
you communicate directly with Dr. Krone.
With best wishes,
Allan Hjerpe
