Dear Mr. Lomax -

In writing Mr. Oliver
Strunk of my plan to be in Washington,
D.C. during July, Mr. Malcom Wyer
(our Librarian in Denver) received word from
him that you will be working at the
Library of Congress during July and
will be so kind as to give me some
help in seeing what is there of American
folk song. If this isn't asking too much
of you I shall indeed be deeply grateful,
and most humble, certainly.

At Mr. Strunk's suggestion I have
written Mr. Robert Gordon for his written
permission to see copies of songs he
collected and left at the Library.

You may, if you try very hard,
