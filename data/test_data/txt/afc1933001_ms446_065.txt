To that haven of rest where tears never flow;
I fear not to enter that dark lonely ward;
For soon shall I rise from the old church-yard.
Yes, soon shall I join that heavenly band,
Of glorified souls at my Savior's right hand;
Forever to dwell in bright mansions prepared
For the saints, who shall rise form the old church-yard

No. 50

O, land of rest, for thee I sigh,
     When will the moment come
When I shall lay my armor by
     And dwell with Christ at home.

No tranquil joys on earth I know,
     No peaceful, sheltering dome;
This world's a wilderness of woe,
     This world is not my home.

I should at once have quit the field
     Where foes and fury roam;
But ah! my passport was not sealed,
     I could not yet go home.

To Jesus Christ I sought for rest,
     He bade me cease to roam,
And fly for succor to His breast,
     And He'd conduct me home.

When by affliction sharply tried,
     I view the gaping tomb,
Although I dread death's chilling tide,
     Yet still I sigh for home.

Weary of wandering round and round,
     This vale of sin and gloom,
I long to leave the unhallowed ground
     And dwell with Christ at home.
