(MEN & WOMEN - DIFFERENCE)

an', an' ah, told him about this fruit.  You see?  It wasn't just
because that she was Eve an' she was wo -- ah, ah, just there, a
company to him.  But it's somethin' with, ah, ah, the spirit
within her, you know, went into his mind an' jus' took possession
of it, you see?  An' ah, also, God let that be, because that
was God's man.  An' God let that be.  An' He controlleded his mind,
you see, for an entry (?).  An' then, he obeyed her, ya see.  An'
ah, an' then he found it out that he had obeyed her an' then, when
God spoke to 'im, he said, he put if off on her.  You see.  Say,
"That woman you give me beguided me."  See?  A woman been beguidin'
mens all, all the time.  An' she can beguide him if she understand
herself, ya see?  An still a man beguided her.  She can beguided him.
Beguide -- you know what I mean?
TL:  No, I don't.
BJ:  Yeah, yeah.  She beguided him.
TL:  What's beguiding do?
BJ:  Beguidin' is controllin' the mind.  See?  But you got to
know the spirit of it.  See?  Ah, of it, ya see, to control it.
That's why I say if I was to hurry or anything like that, an'
git wit' a person an' he's of so much of sin an' Satan that he
gone to the other fella, we can't agree together because, I, I, ah
I ain't gonna let him beguide me, to go out an' drink an' gamble
an' cuss an' swear.  An' he, ah an', an' if he was of Christ, we can
beguide one another, you see?  We be able to agree together, you
see, in that way.  But, as I former (ly) about mens,
when a man's. . .A man is a curious, very curious thing.  Very
indifferent.  He ain't got but one thing to carry 'im.  One thing
to carry him.  See.
TL:  What's that?
