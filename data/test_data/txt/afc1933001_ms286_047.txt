The Gypsy Davy  Sung with guitar by Woody Guthrie, Okeemah, 
Oklahoma, 1940.  Recorded in Washington, D.C. by Alan Lomax.

Reed Smith says that the best American version of this romantic 
ballad was collected in Ohio from a Russian Jew who learned it in 
Salt Lake City, Utah, from the Mormons.  The tale has an enormous 
appeal to the common people, since it depicts the defeat of the 
aristocrat; for women it meant romantic escape from the slavery of 
frontier marriage.

The original ballad comes out of 17th century England where it 
was called "Johnny Fa" or "The Raggle Taggle Gypsies."  In America 
in the early part of the 19th century it was sufficiently well known 
to everyone to be parodied on the stage.  Woody Guthrie, our best contemporary 
ballad composer, has edited this version to fit his Oklahoma 
upbringing.  The "milk white steed of the earlier ballad has become the 
"buckskin pony"; the "lily white gloves" have turned "buckskin", too.  
Then Woody has put in a stanza of his own, number three, which makes 
the story over into a Western ballad, "big guitar" and all.  The 
melody has been completely Americanized and the guitar accompaniment 
is a recent development.  Woody learned his guitar style from listening 
to records of the famous Carter Family of "hill-billy" fame.
