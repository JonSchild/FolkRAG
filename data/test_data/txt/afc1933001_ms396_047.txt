To secure the music of these songs I took with me an old-fashioned Edison phonograph with a simple recording apparatus and a large horn for picking up the voices of my singers. I often had great difficulty in getting men to sing into it. Occasionally a liberal use of stimulants helped with a group of cowboys, I carried the heavy cumbersome machine sometimes on horseback, sometimes afoot. I visited local ranches, round-ups. I attended frontier celebrations, frequented saloons, interviewed wandering gypsy singers. A folk song is elusive; always the best version is known by another singer far away over the hills,in the next county, in the next state,perhaps hundred of miles distant.
