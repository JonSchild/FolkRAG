Mr. Lomax  
I did receive your letter; sorry 
I did not answer it sooner.
My sister and I have agreed
it is just fine to send it 
to me.  We will divide
whatever comes equally.

Thanks, for considering Peters
opinion as correct.

                        Respectively yours,
                        Sis Eva L. Powell
