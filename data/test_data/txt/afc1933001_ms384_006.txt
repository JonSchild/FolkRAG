White Religion

[Cowboy Songs]
[Best verses from Spirituals etc.]

Cowboy
"I'll tell St. Peter that I know
A Cowboy's soul ain't white as snow,
But in that far-off cattle land
He sometimes acted like a man."

[The Hell Bound Train  CS p236]
[use Cowboy's Dream to introduce either the Hell Bound]
[Train or Silver Jack.]

"My suffering time will soon be o'er
Thus I shall weep & sigh no more."
----
"Amazing Grace! thou save a wretch like
me. I once was lost, but now I'm found,
was blind but now I see."
----
Judgement Day:
I see the Judge descending.
I see the dead arising
I see the world assembled.
I hear the sentence uttered.
I hear the wicked wailing (over)
