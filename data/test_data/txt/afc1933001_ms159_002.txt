LIBRARY OF CONGRESS

Washington

Division of Music

July 15, 1940

Mr. David Kirby
Secretary, State Board of Education
Charleston, West Virginia

Dear Mr. Kirby:

Your letter of July 8 to the Library of Congress has been referred to the Music Division. Needless to say, your proposal is of great interest to us, but it may take several weeks before we can reply definitely. Meanwhile, let me assure you that we shall give the matter very careful consideration and cooperate with you as much as possible.

I feel that little aid can be promised as early as you suggest, for August is only two weeks off. Nevertheless, you will hear from us again as soon as we have anything to report or propose.  

Sincerely yours,
