Mr. Alan Lomax
The Library of Congress
Division of Music
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I thank you for your letter of July 27.
I enclose my check for $4.60 for records which you
state that you are now prepared to send to me.

You misunderstood my use of the word "sample".
I should not regard that my library had a satisfactory 
sample unless it had all of your recordings of each of
these ballads. I should be grateful therefore if you
should take up the questions of providing me with
copies of the other six records.

The Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial Library,
at Mount Allison University, Sackville, New Brunswick,
is the best place in Canada for study of songs and
Ballads in the English Language. All records are for 
the purposes of study and research. I am now arranging
for installation in this Library of turntables whereby
one may listen to records without disturbing anyone else
in the room. I assure you that there will never be any
other use of records than what I have indicated above.

Yes indeed I am very familiar with Mr. Barbeau's 
work. It is referred to in the Chapter I sent you. I am
glad indeed to learn that the Mary Mellish Archibald
Memorial Library may hope soon to receive a copy of your 
Check-List.

Very sincerely yours,
R. C. Archibald
