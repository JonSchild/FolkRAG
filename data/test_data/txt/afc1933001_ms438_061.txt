Billy in the Lowlands

Lead Belly's favorite work-song after Julie Ann Johnson( [both]
[of which are similar] similar and both typical of the simple, rhythmic worksong melodies
of the Texas prison farms), is "Billy in the Lowlands." The
leader, as usual, gives out the verse, at the end of which all
the axes, or picks, fall together. The gang comes in with the
"O Lawd, Lawd, Lawd," just as the force of the stroke is exhausted
and the axes fall again with the last syllable. The leader begins
the repetition of the verse, finishes it with the help of the gang
and the axes fall again. The gang completes the stanza with an
"O Lawd", and the axes drop again. With each axe-stroke there
is a violent exhalation of breath.
