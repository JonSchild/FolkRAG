Dear Sirs:

Mr. Gail Kubik has submitted to us an orchestral
work in which he has incorporated the folk-song "Stewball",
printed on p. 68ff of "American Ballads and Folk Songs" by
John A. and Alan Lomax. We are interested in Mr. Kubik's 
composition and may wish to acquire it from him. Before
entering into negotiations with him, however, we should
appreciate a letter from you signifying that you would have
no objection to the publication of his work. The text of
the song, of course, is not used.

We note that the Lomaxes state concerning the song
in question: "It is the most widely know of the chain-
gang songs in the states we visited". Under the circumstances,
our requesting this assent on your part may be gratuitous, 
but we should like to have it just the same.

Faithfully yours,
Gustave Reese
Publication Department

Dear Alan: I have asked for cash or
royalty. Please watch 'em.
For some time, I've been going
blind in my right eye. Maybe I cannot
write again.
Father.
