Idle gossip sinks a ship.

                               The Enemy

Listen the enemy may be talking.

Don't talk the enemy may be listening.

                              Pearl Harbor
(I didn't like the way) the enemy sneaked upon our boys.

Remember Pearl Harbor where our
boys were on guard.

The enemy struck and really struck 
hard.

The guards were on duty to keep the
coast clear.

The soldiers were ready those
brave dears.

To fight and to die for their
country and old glory

That we might live and tell
the story.
