It'll tear you all to pieces.  If he jes go head an let
you lone after while you'll be all right.  So many people
separated.  Sometimes a man walks off from the best woman
in the world.  H e ain't got no sense when he got huh.

mistake at:  I didn't have the sense.  I had sense enough to
know what I wanted to do but I didn't have sense enough --
