LOMAX  We ought to do something about the toys
here, this is where they do the big toy
scene here.
INT.  Do you want to break for lunch,
LOMAX [*03:0422.06*]  I think one of the things that people are
going to like by the way and maybe I am
just prejudiced .  I think they are going
to like to see how nice the relationship
between me and those people is, they are
not put off by me at all and we are talking
to each other as peers, not down at all.
They hear what I say about them, they like
that. I think that is nice, I am very
pleased about that.
[*03:05:09;19*]  There is a mountain fantasy at work for
you. That is a mountain toy named a whammy
diddle, that somebody right in this
neighbourhood invented and Stanley's sister
really knows how to work. If you run your

scraping on the ridge there, the propeller
turns in one direction and change the side
and angle of the finger, it goes the other
way.
We had a mighty good lecture on that by
somebody who said .  Stanley said something
remarkable about this.  He ,are you hooked

hand carved with the pocket knife, right
out of the available woods, with a father's
desire to make his children happy and to an
extent to make up to them for the severity
