the underskirts they used to make with jus' the strops, with
big whole strops on it.  You know, jus' you know have. . . They,
they makes 'em now, th--, too.  They don't have on lil' strop;
had a wide strop.  Jus' cut out the neck here, ya know?  Ta make
a, aroun' that way?  An' they don't wear out so quickly, ya know. 
They make 'em out of white homespun. . . 
TL:  Is it a whole, long, down here?
BJ:  Yeah, whole,long slip; you can make it a whole, long slip.
But jus' don't -- See, the strops be wide.  The call 'em
"Shimmeys" 'stead a "slip."  So I looked for that thing an' I
looked for it.  So I couldn't fin' it.
She said, "Well, it must be somewhere." Said, "I don' know
where." Said, "I, I know I had one nother one."  She had made
so many. She makes me -- Make 'em for me, too, ya know, an' all.
An' so. . . 
An' I know I didn' fin' it.  I looked an' I looked.  That
was, oh , [oh,] my Lord, that was 'way up in, up in the first of the
year, like, ya know. An' [was] 'way up, I reckon, around almost
August, up in the year, I was a-cleanin' up in the house an' cleanin' out the trunks
an' things an' I [fin'] foun' that woman's shimmey in there.  An' I liked
to fainted!
I said, "Great God, here is that shimmey.  Sho' 'nough here."
'Cause we done give it up.  Everybody [done] give it up, myse'f an'
all.  It was in the box ironed, just like I'd ironed it, lay, layin'
in the, in the trunk [that way] there.  Somehow or other I'd put it at
mine, some way or other.
So I didn't know what to do.  Now, I didn't know whether to
carry it back an' tell 'er I'd foun' it there. Or give it
to 'er.  She would think I'd stole it?  I didn' know what to say.
