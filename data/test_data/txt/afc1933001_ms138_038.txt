Dear Alan:

Your letter of October 23 just came in and I have called it to the attention of Dr. Spivacke, who is not here today. Evidently you never received the letter that he sent you to Madison. Since it was short, I quote it in its entirety.

"It is essential that I receive a definite statement of your plans immediately. I had to argue the Disbursing Office into accepting your last voucher because I have not as yet recommended any extension of time. Furthermore, some very interesting things have been growing with relief agencies and it will help me if I know just when I may expect you."

I think you can see now just how matters stand. Please let us know at once the date you will be back. It is of the utmost importance for us to have this date and it is equally important for you to declare any time extension in order to receive additional money. You should realize by this time that it frequently takes time and effort to secure any extra financial aid and don't forget this is Dr. Spivacke's urgent desire that you follow these instructions. In cidentally, when you write again you might tell us if you have used any annual leave.

I am glad the trip has been successful as it has; it certainly has been a productive one.

Sincerely yours,

ENW
mr
