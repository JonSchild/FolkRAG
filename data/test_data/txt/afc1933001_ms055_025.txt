half of March. I will be ready to hit the trail by March 15 at the latest.

When you write again send me Alan's latest address. My last letter to him has been returned marked "Gone. Left no address."

I trust that everything goes well with you in your work and that you take time to enjoy your pretty home and also your lovely lady.

Sincerely your friend,
John A. Lomax

I am yet looking for suggestions from you.
