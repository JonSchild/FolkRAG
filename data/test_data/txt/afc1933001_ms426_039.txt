front,
For better men or soldiers you'd have a long, long hunt.

They sing about old Georgia and Florida you bet,
And now and then you hear a word about Connecticut,
But when your language fails you and words wont tell the tale,
Just holler, "North Dakota," and make the grafters wail.

THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE FARMERS UNION!
Tune: Battle Hymn of the Republic.
Down in Texas 'mid the cotton
Was conceived the plan so great
Of our present Farmers' Union,
And it's spread from state to state.
Small it was in its beginning,
But it's gained tremendous weight
As it goes marching on.

If it helped the cotton grower,
To withhold his crop a while,
Thought the northern farmer wisely,
"I will give this plan a trial."
So his corn and wheat he's holding
And it's good to see him smile
As he keeps holding on.

We will break the powers against us
Who are gambling with out grain,
Who move he prices up and down
That they the more may gain.
We will use our own grain markets,
And they'll feel an awful pain
As we go marching on.

We will keep our hogs and cattle,
From the concentrator's scale,
Where they sort out all the prime ones
To be sent for special sale--
Where they ship to open market.
Scrubs and seconds without fail
And we go struggling on.
We, the good old Farmers' Union,
Mean to break the strangle hold,
