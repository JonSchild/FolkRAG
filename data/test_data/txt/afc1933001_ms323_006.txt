Dear Mr. Street - 

Some weeks ago we broadcast
on this page James Street's request
for the endings of two American
folk rhymes. The following
letter from Mr. Street will tell you
what happened:
     "I have received more than five 
hundred letters about that jingle

business. I just finished reading
one from two patients in a psychopathic
hospital in San Antonio and 
hasten to write this before I go
join them.
     "It's going to take me a week
to answer these letters. Strangely
enough, not more than five or six
agree on the exact words of the
jingles. However, it's been a lot of
fund and I've learned something
about America; also hundreds of
jingles. Most of the persons who
wrote learned the jingles from their
grandmothers. The letters also
prove how Americans get around.
Seven out of ten letters say, 'I
learned this jingle from my grandmother
when we lived in such and
such a state.'

     "In case 
you're interested,
there
are two distinct
versions
of each jingle,
just as I 
thought. For
lack of a better
definition I 
will call them
the Northern
and Southern
versions On
the Pud'n-
and-Tame
thing most
Southerners or migrated Southerners
say the old thing is:
"What's your name?
Pud'n tame.
And if you ask me again, I'll tell
     you the same.
"The Northern version is:
     "What's your name?
       Pud'n Tame.
       Where do you live?
       Up the lane. 
       What's your number?
       Cucumber.
     "The thing is supposed to have
had some political significance
about three hundred years ago in
Europe, either England, Scotland
or Ireland. Possibly it referred to 
a census.
     "The Southern version of the 
Tremble-Toe thing is:
"William a'Tremble-Toe is a good
     fisherman.
Catches hens, puts them in pens; 
Some lay eggs, some lay none;
Wire, briar, limberlock, three geese
     in a flock -
One flew east, one flew west,
One flew over the cuckoo's nest.

"The Northern version is
   "Inter, Minter, CuterCorn,
    Apple seed and Apple thorn,
    Wire, Briar, Limberlock, three
       geese in a flock - etc., etc.

     "Some persons suggest that 
William a'Tremble-Toe possibly
was William of Orange and that 
the poem was satire."
     We're glad Mr. Street wrote us.
We had a nice fat batch of letters
addressed to him, here in the office. 
His note reminded us to send them 
along.
