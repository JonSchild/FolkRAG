Food?
Where will the people of the
United States get food?  Will
everybody in American starve 
before this war is over?
These are a few of the crazy questions 
that the population of America
are asking nowadays.  Some
 people aren't worrying at all,
because down in their cellar or
way back in the closet sits
dozens of cans of food stuffs.
Meat is another problem so
I've heard.  How will meat be
distributed to every family in the 
United States, and what kind of meat
will it be?  Horse?  It came to my
ears not so long ago, that
some of our better resta[u]rants
down town have horse steak
on the menu.  People say that
this meat is pretty good; but 
tough.
