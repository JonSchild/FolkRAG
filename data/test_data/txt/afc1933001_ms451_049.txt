Jay-bird pull a two ox [load] load
Sparrow, why not you?
[Why not pull [?] 2]
My legs so long & slender, love
I'm [fraid] feared I'll ['?] into [* in two?*]
                   'Feared I'll pull into, my love

[Cho. II with Sugar Hill in last]
Snowbird died with whooping cough
Crawfish      "        "    colic,
Jaybird died with a sick headache,
Inquiring the day to the frolic.

Cho I & II
When I git one [?]
Then I want two
When I get on a high lonesome 
I don't care what I do
