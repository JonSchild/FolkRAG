OPA

3 Woman worker, 8-12-42: "There is something funny about the Iowa OPA. In Texas there are 50 girls already on the payroll of doing the kind of consumer education work I am applying for, and the Des Moines there isn't one yet." 

3 Woman worker, good education, 8-12-42: "Apparently the intention is that all administrative people in the CPA must be college people. One man high in the regional office told me he was being demoted and a college man appointed in his place, because CPA didn't figure anyone except college professors could run the progress."
