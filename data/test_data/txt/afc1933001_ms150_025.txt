Dear Alan:

First of all, please let me know when you will be
back here. I am terribly rushed on folk-song work and
need every bit of help I can get.

Will you please get after the annual report
immediately as Mr. Slade is bringing great pressure to
bear. It need not be terribly long and might consist 
only of a summary of the various reports handed to you.
If you are short of time you can fill up space by liberal
quotations from the reports of Father and Halpert. In
fact, this might be a wise thing to do anyway.

It may prove inadvisable to recommend the purchase
of a new recording machine so please send me by return
mail the cost of rental per week.

I cannot recommend either reimbursement for your
trip because of the sketchy information you have left
me. Please tell me where you are going, how you are
traveling, how long you will be gone, etc., etc., etc.

Sincerely yours,


Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
