Cox: You mustn't have a beer after that, must you?
Lomax: What?
Cox: You mustn't have a beer after two, must you?
Lomax: I didn't understand.
Cox: I mustn't. . .I mean the beer should be all - pots gone away at
two, shouldn't they?
Lomax: Oh, I don't think - they won't bother us in here. We're
working, we're not amusing ourselves in a tavern. I suppose it's all
right. (cut)
I'd like to hear that one.
Cox: Well, that is really a kind of American song, isn't it?
Lomax: I don't know.
Cox: From that way somewhere.
Lomax: I don't know, I don't know anything about this song, I've
just heard Peter talk about it. What's this background of it, that
you. . .
Cox: Well. . . .he was hung, you see, for stealin' a deer. She was
in love with this here chap, which you'll soon find out, how it go.
Lomax: Where did it originate, do you think?
Cox: I don't know. (pause) I never did know that. I don't know who
made 'em up. (pause)
Lomax: But you think it happened in America somewhere?
Cox: Oh well, they sing it in America. 'Cause there was a woman
come here when I was there one time - she - she took the same song
down there as  - tune as they got here. (pause)
