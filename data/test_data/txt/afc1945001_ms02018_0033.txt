Price Control
1.  Landlords are not observing rent ceilings and are in numerous 
instances conniving to make tenants move so that the rent can be 
increased to new tenants.  (Veteran of World War I.  10/2/42)
2.  Grocery stores are not paying attention to price ceilings as 
all prices appear to be gradually going up.  (Housewife.  10/7/42)
