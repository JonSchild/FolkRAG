"Have you heard very much about fifth column work around here? I just 
was talking to a neighbor of mine last night. A man and woman moved into our 
neighborhood a few months ago who are mean to the children in the neighborhood, 
keep a big dog, won't have anything to do with their neighbors, are big, heavy 
set people who look like Germans. I don't know anything about them except that 
it just seems funny."  Aug. 8 - Elevator operator   Iowa 8
