General Remarks

We have, of course, spent a great deal of our time, in fact
the most of it, in other pursuits than making records. In the
first place it is a slow job to locate an informant who [sin]
sings well and at the same time knows what we want. Most of
our trips are thus fruitless. Then we have, as well as
recorded mechanically, written out the texts of many songs
and noted down the reccurence of tunes we had before recorded.
Lastly, we make rather feeble attempts to set down
on paper what neither the camera nor the recording machine
can catch, that is: the environment out of which the songs
grew and the people who sing the. This last is an endless
task, of course.

Just how successful our photographs of singers in action [wil]
are, we do not yet know. We have taken thus far eighty pictures,
but none have been returned from Austin where they [e]
are being given a fine-grain development. They should, however
be a valuable ajunct to our collection. We plan shortly
to begin using a movie camera, which one of our friends
has kindly lent us.
