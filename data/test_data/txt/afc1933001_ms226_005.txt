[*File*] Tuesday morning
Dear Alan:  I think it a most 
fitting and complimentary close
to your series of broadcasts
to have the Librarian join you 
in the final show. 
Recently I have sent you 
a lot of scrappy letters, many
with enclosures, few of which 
you have acknowledged. If 
you continue as helplessly 
busy perhaps I shant write
you so frequently hereafter 
so that you will not feel 
the pressure of unfulfilled
duties in my direction. Shirley 
went home yesterday.
Lovingly, Father,
