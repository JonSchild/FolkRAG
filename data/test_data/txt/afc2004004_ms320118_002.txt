AL: ....around the world, you run into magical places and
magical people. And southwestern Louisiana is one of those
places. Here in that long prarie, that stretches from the 
Miss. River on out to Houston, the people of Africa, and 
France and Spain...and France, met and from it came jazz, 
the international music of the world. And now, in the last
few years, has come a new music, it's called Cajun, it's called
fais do do, it's called Zydeco, but it's the music that really
results from Indians teaching things to French people and 
French people learning things from black people, and all three
making a new kind of America, a new language, and I think it's
going to be the music of the future, because it's the only
place on the continent where all these culture get togehter
and shared their things. There was injustice and cruelty
in the past, there was horror, but basically it's always been 
a land of peace. In the end, the violence faded away, and 
neighbors were neighbors, and blacks listened to whites and 
whites listened to blacks and the Indians had their say, and
those days, along with the highways that ribbon this place
that old Huey P. Long put up here to tie people together, you
have a renaissance, a cultural renaissance. And perhaps the
most important musician in the whole picture, is the man we're 
sitting with right now. Canray Fontenot . . . .You're about in your

speaker . . . . you know the country, you've been a farmer, you
travelled, you've taught people and when you were young you
