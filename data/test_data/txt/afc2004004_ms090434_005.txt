colored news--3

"Yes she id dead and buried." I know that we are all born to 
die but what hurt me so was that I nevee got a chance to
see[xxx] her.
From there I went to the Centennial M.B. C. pastored by Rev.  
J.V. West. Public collection [was] raised   was $48.15 and [two] 
ladies sure sung sweet. The Rev. West text 24th chapter St. 
Luke 29th verse. I forget his subject but he sure preached a 
soul reviving sermon. Now that being the last sermon I heard [?] 
this year and I was satisfied for I seen so many of my friends 
after service.
Then I went to Sister Jackson's home for dinner and she gave me
BROWN*SKIN service. I ate until I want no more, them Clarksdale 
peoplesure will treat you nice and feed you if they live. Then 
I went to see Bro. and Sister Hawkins and they wanted me to eat; 
I spent a while there and then I went to see Bro. and Sister
Skelton; they were as fat as they could be. 
Now let me tell you all one thing it sure is prayer time.
I can't understand the people; some of them ain't regarding 
anything the Lord had sent his storm through here once. Please
don't forget it. If the [??? ?????] Lord say so I will be  at 
my own church Sunday to hear the first sermon. I hope I won't
be disappointed like I was at Locust Grove. I sure to get joy
out of a Good Service.
Mr. and Mrs J.B. Snider sure is nice to me since I started 
writing in their paper. They sure have caused me to get a 
many present from different people. All you got to do is do
the right thing. So pray for peace.
