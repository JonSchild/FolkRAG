Anecdotes
meat is soon to be rationed. Along with that will go, butter and cheese. Many people say that soon all the meat will be horsemeat. I don't like the idea of having an animal, almost human, being cut up and eaten. A lot of people seem to have the same idea. On the other hand, there are some who say that horse meat is just as good as any other animals meat. Maybe the horse is just as clean as any other animal.
