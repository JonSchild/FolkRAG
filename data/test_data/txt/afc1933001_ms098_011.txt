Dear Mr. Lomax,

          I am a little sprawled out by the heaped-up goodness of
your piece in the Saturday Review of Literature, which I have
just read. Ever since Alan wrote me that you were doing a 
review, I have been looking for it impatiently. I know that 
the people who care about folklore will pay a great deal of 
attention to what you say.

          To me, perhaps the most interesting of your comments is 
that on the Federal Writers Project. Knowing all you have 
done for the Project and remembering the encounter with the 
American Folklore Society, I should say that you have had the 
last word.

            As to Negro superstitions, I originally had a generous 
sampling, but, as I point out in ay introduction, customs and 
beliefs are represented only as they enter into song and story.

            Again, thanks for your careful and stimulating review.

            With best wishes,

                                                    Faithfully,


                                                    B. A. Botkin 
                                                    Assistant in Charge,
                                                    Archive of American Folk Song
