nina gordani
was born in New York City where she received the greater part of
her musical and academic education. Her debut was made in England,
where the critics acclaimed her unusual and artistic interpretations with great enthusiasm. After
a command performance before English Royalty, Nina Gordani left for an extended concert tour
of the continent, where she also had the opportunity of studying the folk music and mannerisms
of the natives. Upon her return to America, she was starred in various operettas, also presenting 
her own recitals with great success in New York and other principal cities in the United 
States. Nina Gordani's programmes are composed of groups of folk songs in Italian, French,
German, English, Russian, Spanish and various dialects of the provinces. All these are presented
in native costumes, and interpreted by the gestures and intonations of the characters depicted.

Press Comments

"Nina Gordani is a gifted interpreter and a linguist. She gave
added attraction to an entertainment of exceptionally broad scope
by several changes of picturesque character costumes. She posed,
gesticulated, grimaced and even introduced dance steps." 
- New York American

"She displayed a voice full of color and richness. Her interpretations 
of the various moods of the song were very good..."
- New York Evening Post

"Miss Gordani...falls into the school of Raquel Meller. She has
a pleasant vivacity and voice that is a good deal more than adequate. 
Her gestures are pleasing and intelligent, always an important 
part of the performance of a diseuse." - New York Sun

"The unusually wide range of Miss Gordani's linguistic accomplishments 
were revealed and extended even to the dialects in
some of these languages. The diseuse sang well and caught the
spirit of the texts with much success." - New York Times

"With a voice of likeabile quality the singer gave vivacious and
effective interpretations with the aid of vocal inflection, expression 
and gesture." - New York Herald Tribune

"Madam Gordani has a good voice and a lovely set of songs,
which she delivers with vim and humor of sentiment and melody
as her song requires." - Chicago Daily News

"Vocally enjoyable, this artist is not only a singer but also an
actress, sounding words musically and making the story they tell
clearer by gesture and expression." - Boston Globe

"To an exceedingly effective voice she adds the tricks of hands
and face and gesture that point every song. Pretension is not her
pitfall. She sticks to songs of the people and whatever their tongue
puts them home." - Boston Transcript
