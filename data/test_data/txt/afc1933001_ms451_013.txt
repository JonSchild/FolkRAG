The Lady of Carlisle

Down in Carlisle there lived a lady,
Being most beautiful and gay;
She was determined to live a lady,
No man on earth could her betray

Unless it was a man of honor,
A man of honor and high degree,
Then approached two loving soldiers,
This fair lady for to see.

One being a brave lieutenant,
A brave lieutenant and a man of war;
The other being a brave sea captain,
A captain on a ship that was Kavy Kavy Car.

Up spoke this fair young lady,
Saying, "I can't be but one man's bride,
If you come back tomorrow morning,
and on this case we will decide."

She ordered her a span of horses,
A span of horses at her command;
Down the road the three did travel,
Till they came to the lions' den.
