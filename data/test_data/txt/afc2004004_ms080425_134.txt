I'm very fond of minor music, I don't know why, but a lotta people, most
people like major music. I like . . .
     What about Poor Wayfaring Stranger?
     That's a good song, yeah.
     Could you sing that for us now
     I think I might could sing part of it. (Sings)
     What does the whole Sacred Harp thing amount to as far as you're
concerned? What is this whole business about? Have you been all your
life--you go nearly every weekend, don't you?
     Yes, sir. I think it's just as much heaven as you can get on
earth, that's what I think it is. If there's any heaven on earth, I
think you can give some of it away. That's the way I feel about it. I
think it's just as good a place to go to feel the spirit of the Lord
as any place you can get. Church is a good place to go, too. You
can get it out of church . . .                     what you get out of it.
     I think you kind of prefer Sacred Harp.
     I do. It's just as a religious as a preacher, if you get the meanin'
of it. It sure is, it's just--it's right from the Bible, and that's
where he's supposed to preach from, and that's where the most of them do
. . .
     How many weekends of the year do you go, do you suppose?
     Well, we don't miss many. Very few, we miss very few.
     Where do you go?
     Well, all the way from Orlando, Florida to, uh, I'd say, Dallas,
Texas.
     Tell the people, you didn't quite tell--we go to Sacred Harp
meetings--tell 'em. No, tell 'em--we go to Sacred Harp meetings--
