Further Investigation

in his spare time, music in which
Nietzsche expressed sentiments
never revealed in his philosophical
writings.

Last year the school turned its
attention exclusively to our own art
in a semester devoted to "Music of
America." This traced the subject
from American Indian music
through that of Colonial New England,
Revolutionary times and later
periods to modern dance music,
grand opera and symphony, culminating
in original compositions 
submitted by students in American
high schools.

In the spring term of the same 
year a new approach was undertaken
in showing the close alliance
between music and other arts, such
as painting, architecture, poetry
and writing. A distinguished spokesman
in each related art was invited
to express his views as music describing
his own subject was played.

Adult Education
With eleven regular educational
series already on its schedules, Columbia
carried its adult educational
program one step farther in 1938 by 
deciding to correlate all radio education
under the supervision of an
advisory "faculty."

On January 17, 1938, this faculty 
was called together by William S.
Paley, president of CBS. It was a 
highly distinguished group, including
several university presidents,
foundation directors, a publisher, a
newspaper editor, and a former
minister to Denmark. Its chairman
was Professor Lyman Bryson of
Teachers college.

Its job was to draw up a series of 
suggestions for additions to Columbia's
formal, systematic radio adult
education. These suggestions, CBS 
was prepared to carry out with adequate 
funds and the best literary 
and technical talent available.

Among The Suggestions
Outstanding among the suggestions
made by the board were the 
following three points: 1. The establishment
of a series of half hour
evening programs dramatizing the
processes of learning. 2. The establishment of a series of dramatic

Wanted To Be Philosopher
Alan Lomax, who will direct the Columbia Broadcasting System's 
presentation of "The American School of the Air," originating in the
studios of WDBJ at Roanoke Tuesday, is the son of John A. Lomax,
curator of folk songs at the Library of Congress. Alan sings American
folk songs to his own accompaniment on the School of the Air every
Tuesday. But, curiously enough, Alan never wanted to collect folk
songs. He wanted to be a philosopher.
