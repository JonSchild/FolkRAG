Friar's Point Victory Song.

Hail to our Friar's Point.
That be will win.
Right, boy; you're right, boy.
Never give in.
Rah, rah,
You do your best, boy.
We do the rest, boy.
Right, boy, Your big (career?)

What about Friar's Point?
All right.
Who's all right?
Friar's Point's all right.
Who says so?
Everybody says so.
And who's everybody?
One zip, a two zip, a three zip, a four.
Rah, rah, rah.
Don't get a ho[t]p hip.
Zip boom bah.
If somebody ask you
Who we are,
Tell um, tell um.
25, 25, rah ,rah rah.

Hide and spy, 
Chick and tie,
Oh,..he holler,
"Blackbird pie."

Rip town a bong bong.
Ship come a-sailin, sailin.
Hoowaw hee.

This is Florell Stanford.  A Poem.

Here, little tea-ball.
Don't you cry.
You'll be a tariff-man
By and by.
