Information can, however, be used effectively to combat "hate-rumors"
insofar as they may be thoughtlessly believed or repeated by persons
who would otherwise feel no violent or urgent hatred. Adequate information
can serve to make repetition and progress of "hate-rumors"
more difficult.

The other types of rumors - "anxiety rumors," "escape rumors,"
"supernatural rumors," and "curiosity rumors" - appear to grow out of
the public tensions which exist during wartime; they spread because of
the virtual impossibility of completely eliminating such tensions through
information. Adequate and accurate information about the war - plus the
confidence among the American people that they are receiving adequate
and accurate information about the war - will tend to allay these tensions,
and thus to reduce the volume of rumors. But it is clear that as long
as war continues to produce a succession of situations about which there
is bound to be apprehension and anxiety, even the most complete information
will not be able to destroy rumors entirely.
