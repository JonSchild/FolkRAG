His friend was [stirring?] there.
To rose splint Poker from his swoom
Oh who would now Despair.

Peg has seen a distant hoe.
Her name was Florie M.
Say Florie Florie Florie Flor.
Oh say Florie when.

Save Save oh that blessed hoe.
That hoe and comeless boy.
Companion once in suffering 
Companion once in Joy.
