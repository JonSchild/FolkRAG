O beloved little sister
Do you not pity my plight tonight
As I sit in this little hut,
Low end narrow,
Without a wisp of thatch
Or thatch rope
With cold hill torrents
Running o'er it".
SONG
Another fairy song is the lament of a fairy for her
mortal love, killed by his brothers when they
discovered that he was keeping tryst with a beanshithe, 
or fairy woman. The fairy afterwards came
on the body and sang this lament:
"It is I who am sorrowful
About the hunger of the woodcock
I heard your cry on the hillside
But paid no heed,
Until I heard the raven's call;
A thousand curses on the brothers
Who have wounded you to death, etc".
ORAN SITHE
In the midst of all these activities the children were
not forgotten. Running about all day, in and out of
mischief, tired little bodies had to be soothed and
comforted and rested.  Who could do that better than
granny and the little one soon forgot her tiredness
being dandled on granny's knee to this little dandling
tune:
"I would give this to Mary
I would give this to Mary
I would give this to Mary
For the mending of her gown.

I would give to my love
