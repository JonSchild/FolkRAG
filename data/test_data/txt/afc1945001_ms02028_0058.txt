Before a survey of this kind could be really reliable, I believe it would be necessary to have the same persons make a similar survey on two or three different occasions. Unquestionably, these persons are more definitely aware of the existence of rumors now than they were a week ago and a second or third survey at a later date to include the same persons and a few additional ones would appear to be valuable.
