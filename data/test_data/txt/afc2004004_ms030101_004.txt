Dear Alan:
Mr. "Sunrise Course" Webb I find
comes from Emmanuel County Georgia. He lives 
near the town of Swainsboro. But at the moment
he is still in Florida: Bennet Lester Webb,
Sebastian, Florida.
From notes: uses "holpen" for
helped. Remark to Frank, "I'll just step out
into the orchard so I won't have to call for
a vessel"; "earned four dollars one day gone - 
sweat a dollar, fought skeeters a dollar, worked
two - earned four. "Why don't you stay in
Georgie?" "I got the dust of Floridy in my shoes."
"Will you work tomorrow? "Subjectively". And so
forth.
