IN PRAISE OF LEARNING, continued
Don't be per-suad-ed, but prove for your-self. What you don't learn your-self you don't know. 
Check up the bill, for it's you who must pay it. Point with your fin-ger to ev-ery i-tem; 
Say that you want it explained. You must be read-y to take o-ver, You must be read-y to take o-ver.

WE AIN'T GONNA SLAVE NO MORE
(Tune: "It Ain't Gonna Rain No More")

I.
The bosses tried to cheat us,
They robbed us left and right;
But now we know our power,
We'll organize and fight.

Refrain
Oh, we ain't gonna slave no more, no more
We ain't gonna slave no more.
We are fighting for a living wage,
We ain't gonna slave no more.

II.
Oh, join a fighting union,
It is the only way
You'll ever get a living wage;
Come and join today.

(Refrain)
