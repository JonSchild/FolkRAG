   The advertisement given my project by Harvard University 
brought to me a large batch of miscellaneous material.  Not until 
1934 did I have time to go through it and put the best of it together.  
During that year Macmillans published  for me a book, American Ballads
and Folk Songs, in which I have included what seems to me to be the
best of the material produced in the United States.  A lot of it of

repeated because of their universal popularity in this country. 
However, the bulk of the material, in my judgment, is native in origin. 
Before finally submitting the copy to the printer, my young son, Alan,
and I traveled throughout the South visiting Negroes in the penitentiaries,
in lumber camps far back in the woods, negro communities 
where there were very few whites and the Negro himself owns all the 
land.  Our object was to find the Negro who has least contact with 
the white man, with the radio and jazz, to secure from him songs
as free as possible from the idiom and tunes of the white man as

secure the words and music of the negro secular songs, his "reels"
or "sinful" songs, the songs of black labor working in groups.  For many negroes every song is

songs are of tremendous interest because in them the Negro is inclined 
to express his ideas with great freedom.  They vividly
record his contact with life, his hopes, fears, ambitions, motives,
jealousies, his philosophy, even sometimes his opinion of his white 
neighbors.  As the sweat pours from his body, the melodies throbbing
