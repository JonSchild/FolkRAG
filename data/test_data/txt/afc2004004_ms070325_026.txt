   I was left very much wounded
& weakened by E's sudden departure
I think of her with regret, I treated
her abominably throwing her alone on
Paris.  I am thinking seriously of sending
for Pip.  [And] Of course the great reason
for weakness is that I asked R to 
come back & since then she has answered
no letters.  Every day my mailbox leaves
an open wound.  I know she won't
come & I fear I have finally estranged
her by taking her tentative gestures
of friendship as serious.
   So here in Paris in Spring I
watch the streams of beautiful &
passionate & eager women go
by -- the best women ever probably --
and I am really going mad.
I'm almost beyond the point of
control.  Should I go home?
