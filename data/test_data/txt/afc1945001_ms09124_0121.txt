While riding home on the streetcar
 from work, I hard a man tell his
companion that America was planning
 to send over one-half her harvested
 crops to England.
I've also heard there is a possibility 
of Chicago and other chief industry cities
 being gased as soon as warmer
 weather arrives.
I heard too that Japan had a 2nd 
and 3rd army in training, preparing 
to attack the United States.
