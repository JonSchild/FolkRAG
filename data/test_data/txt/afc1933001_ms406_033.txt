      THE ROMISH LADY
Mrs. Minnie Floyd of

   "We don't know how the girl got in touch with the
Protestants.  I used to have a book of it (read a great mess);
it told pretty much about it,  but I don't remember all there
was about it.  But her handmaiden was the one that stole the
Bible and brought it and give it to her, and she got to reading
it, and pulled out away from 'em, and then her mother found it
out, how she had the Bible.  There was a whole book told about
it, so I reckon it was true.  The girl's name was Merle.  I
don't know just where it happened,  - it's been so long back
I don't remember.
   "My mother taught me the tune to the 'Romish Lady' long
before I knew all the words. I caught up the tunes easy when I
was a little thing.  But I couldn't find anybody could tell me
all the words straight through until I was a big girl, about
grown.
   "Way years ago, a lady got bad burnt.  She lived in
the woods way up the road from us.  She was burnt awful bad, the
worst I ever saw.  And her husband, he was so old and so bad
cripppled that he wasn't any good to help her; in fact, he was
laid up in bed most of the time himself.  Mother said one day
we ought to go up there and Pappy said we ought to go up there, too.
We didn't have no money, nor nothing much to eat, except just
enough to keep skin and bones together for all of us children.
Well-l, mother looked around, and said she guessed anybody that
was bad burnt could use some clean rags.  So she got a big
bundle of clean rags together and I took 'em up there.
