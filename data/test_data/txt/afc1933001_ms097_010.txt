Dear Mr. Spivacke,

Mea cupla! mea cup!
Your most recent letter came a few days ago and Dr. Rotkin's
this morning. I am sure that you have been more irked by our delay in
returning records and equipment than you have shown in your letters.
As for the records and the report (field notes) I take the blame; for
I offered to prepare th labels and notes and pack the records, and the
job still lacks a day or two of work. I have no excuse except that
Mr. Lomax has been ill much of the time since the latter part of October
and I have filled the roles of nurse, housekeeper, cook, companion, etc.,
most of which are unaccustomed rules for an ex-school mar'm. Mr. Lomax
has just returned home from a stay in a hospital and will require a good
rest for several weeks. He is not able to do much about the report, but I
promise that I shall resume work on it at once.
Mr. Botkin asks that we send the machine. The matter of packing
requires the arm of a strong man. We have no "help" as the place now, but
we have the promise of a man to do some gardening for us Saturday, whose
aid in packing the machine I shall solicit. Then I shall try to get it
to the express office on Monday. Since we reside outside the city limits
we do not have express pick-up privileges.
You and your families, the Spivackes and the Botkins, have my best
wishes. How I should like to see how much the children have grown.

Sincerely yours,
[* Ruby Terrill Lomax *]

Please forgive me, Mr, Botkin, for using the carbon, but I wished to get this
off in the afternoon mail. RTL

Boley, Oklahoma is an all-new turn. I came never being amateur for making a turn in the midst of the block. *]
