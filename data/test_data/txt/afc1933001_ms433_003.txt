ALL STAND TOGETHER

As we go along every day
Storms cloud gather to dark our way
Old "Big Bizz" is rapping us strong
But don't you forget it he will find us "long"
He will try the open shop game
If we let him go --
But we'll surprise him and tantalize him
By members we can show.

Chorus:

All stand together
Under the stormy sky
"Stand pat", "hold tight" to the right
There will be dawn after "night"
All stand together
This is our battle cry
Get in the game and we'll keep up our name
Till the clouds roll by

Tenm more million men is our goal
Trainmen farmers, men mining coal
All "craft" lab' ring with head or hand
Shoul get right in with our "A. F. of L b[r]and
Then we can stand firm as a rock
Let the wild wind blow,
Then we'll surprise him and tantalize him
By members we can show.

The Union Label

There's a precious little emblem that's familiar to you all
It's a tried and true protector, come what may.
And where labor is united in response to duty's call
There this brilliant little star lights up the way.
For its mission is to bring about the brotherhood of man
There is nothing can your rights so well defend.
So help it n with deed and word in every was you can
Don't forget the union label, its your friend.

Chorus:
It will make improved conditions, better homes, a better wage,
And your aid to its advancement you should lend
It will make your country better,
It will brighten historys page
Don't forget the union label, Its your friend.

Though apparently so silent, yet it speaks throughout the land,
For the noble cause its striving to uphold
And to free the sweatshop slaves the union label takes a stand
From their wretchedness and miseries untold,
It will educate the people to the evils that exist,
And success will crown it efforts in the end
Help it on its mission it will win if you persist
[*Don't forget the union label, it's your friend*]
