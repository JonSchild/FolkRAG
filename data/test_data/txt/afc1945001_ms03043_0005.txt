RUMORS IN NORTH CAROLINA

A survey of the Eastern part of North Carolina discloses that there are very
few rumors going around in that section of the State, however, I heard the following rumors while traveling over the eastern part of the State.

Wilson, North Carolina     August 13, 1942

In talking with a party in the City who was formerly Secretary of the Merchants
Association he disclosed that there was a rumor going around in the City to
the effect that there were some merchants not complying with the price control regulations
and that there were some merchants who were not complying with the credit 
regulations. This party stated that as a result of the merchants not complying 
with the regulations it was causing a great deal of dissatisfaction among the merchants 
who were trying to carry out the price control to the letter of the law, 
however, he stated that some of the merchants who were complying with the law had 
stated that they did not particularly feel like complying with the law if others 
were going to be permitted to do as they please about putting the price ceiling
regulations and credit regulations into effect.

Wilson, North Carolina     August 13, 1942

In talking with a fellow whose duty it is to enforce the law in this City
and County he stated to me that there had been some pamphlets given out among the
colored people in his County and surrounding Counties and that these pamphlets
were causing unrest among the colored people in that locality.
