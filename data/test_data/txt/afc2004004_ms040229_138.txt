p. 755 The deer in the park of the great are [?]
domestic cattle, fat as [?] & aldermen. Scotland is
the last refuge for the noble passion. In the highlands
new forests are springing up like mushrooms - 
from Aberdeen to Oban a continuous line of forests

p 848 - Now deer supplant sheep - best pastures
in Scotland turned into deer parks - [?]
tenants driven to even courser land - the huntsman
Who wants a deer forest limits his offer by no
other calculation than the extent of his
purse - Deer receive extended ranges, while
men have been hunted within a narrowing
circle - the clearance + dispersion of
people is pursued by the proprietors on a 
settled principle, as an agricultural
necessity, just as trees + brushwood are cleared
from the wastes of America or Australia
