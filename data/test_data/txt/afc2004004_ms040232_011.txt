Dear Alasdair and Rena

The two days in Barra under Annie Johnston's wing were 
memorable, almost equal to the week in South Uist, and 
here I am in Glasgow with a remarkable collection of 
Gaelic songs on which I have almost nothing. I am 
counting on you springing to my aid once more.

Would it be possible to get from you and your allies there 
the texts of the enclosed songs which I can then have 
translated and explained? That would be half the job. 
If I had the texts from you, rather than tediously trying 
to transcribe from the records, I would then be half-way 
towards the finishing mark of preparing the documentary 
broadcast scheduled now for 1st August (to be recorded 
before then). I am going to London first and shall try 
to arrange for you to get your records from that end.

Again thanks for an unforgettable week and I shall be 
coming back once life will permit.

All kind regards
Yours sincerely
Alan Lomax

P.S. If my request is difficult or impossible for you to 
accomplish in the next week or so let me know and I shall 
understand that you are too busy.
