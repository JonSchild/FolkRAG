This here's the las' verse.  If anybody should ask you 
who compose this song, â€” you know what to tell 'em when I'm 
gone....

If anybody should ask you compose this song - you'll know 
what to tell 'em when I'm gone...

If anybody should ask you,
Who compose this song,
Tell 'em Huddie Ledbetter done been here an' gone.
