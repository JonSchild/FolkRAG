Henry Ford Blues

When the Model A Ford first came out, Lead Belly, who is a firm believer in Fords and in Mr. Ford, -- as he says, "Dey'll do de work en dey'll take you where you want to go," -- heard everybody talking about them."  I listened to one man say one workd there an' I head somebody else say another word over yonder an' I put 'em all together an' made me a song."

Her is Mr. Ford, then a great capitalist, masterfully doing business, instructing his friends and henchmen with pithy words and talking the language of a barrel-house Negro.

This blues shows how little Lead Belly cars for meaning and consistency in our sense of these words, the last stanza illustrates the penetrating power of a good publicity campaign.

Lead Belly hopes that he will have a chance to sing this song to Mr. Henry Ford some day and believes, when that day comes, Mr. Ford will give him a brand new, shiny Ford car, "late model".
