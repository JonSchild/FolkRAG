BARRY ANCELET  -13
ANCELET It's the north, it's the north,
the north western corner of Plateu bordering on Britanny.
LOMAX  And this is the place where most
of the Cajuns came from.  And their stamp is, you feel is
still here in, in Louisiana.
ANCELET  About, about 85% of the people who
became the Arcadians eventually came from a, right around a
little town called La Dunne, the same one that Alvis Huxley
wrote the, about the devils.  And I, it physically,
linguistically, and I feel culturally the stories of, of,
I've talked with people who've collected oral literature in
those, those areas, and very many of the stories that we
tell here are, are told there.  I didn't have enough, enough
of an opportunity to talk about music, but to hear the
music, but everything else was  marvelously the same.  It was
stunning.
LOMAX  I think it's amazing how America
has been settled in terms of similar landscapes.  People
have always looked for their landscape.  The Spanish for
their somewhat arid landscape, and now it turns out that
the, the French are from this part of France have looked for
their landscape, farm land and then. . . .
ANCELET  Flat.
LOMAX  Flat farm land with marsh on the 
edge where you could fish.
