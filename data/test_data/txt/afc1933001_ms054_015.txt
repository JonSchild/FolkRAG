Dear Mr. Waters:
    Please reply to the enclosed letter, or, as it is efficient,
hand it over to Mr. Spivacke.
    The Cowboy Songs must be selling some or else there would be
no special circular. I thought you would be interested in some
of the comments on the music. Not an unfavorable line yet.
    Did the children get my Christmas _______? I pictured
you reading them aloud on Christmas morning.
    Maybe I'll be looking in on you in a few months or so.
    In the next edition of Cowboy Songs (to come soon) I am
insisting that your name come on the title page as music editor.
You might send to Miss Susan R________ at Macmillan just
the form you wish printed.
    Fishing here is the best 9in the world. My average for an
afternoon - 40 pounds.
    With my very kindest regards to the Waters' Clan, in Toto,
_________ me always.
    Sincerely yours,
    John A. Lomax
