Lomax: Do they pitch their voices different from the Scots?
Davy: Oh yes. A lot different altogether. (He demonstrates.)
A real Irishman puts a different style.
Lomax: A Scotsman will sing in a different tone of voice.
Davy: A different tone of voice altogether.
Lomax: How would you describe that? What is the man difference
between the Scots and the Irish style of singing ballads.
Davy: You can tell an Irish brogue. When it comes to a Scotch singer
he sings the words different altogether. Maybe the same song, but
he doesn't put the lovely old-fashioned air in like the Irish.
For example now, if you get an Irishman playing the violin, he
doesn't play it the same as the Scotch. If you get an Irish
fiddler to play a Scotch tune - as far as I've heard - they put
different turns in all the time. (He diddles a demonstration).
Different bits in it altogether.
Lomax: Davy, you were telling me, - do you know any diddling tunes
or songs?
Davy: Oh, I can diddle a lot of songs. (He diddles on but uses
sounds not words.)
Lomax: Do you know any with words? Like "Tail Toddle?" Or any
like that that have words. You were singing one, "I'm drunk and 
seldom sober." Any more that you know?
Davy: Let's see now. Here's an old-fashioned Scottish air.
(He diddles again, still no words.) Tune The Lovely Shepherd's
Daugther. There's a brother of mine in Aberdeen sings it, but he
has all the words and I haven't. But it's a very old-fashioned
thing. There's lots of Scots songs that i want to get back that I've
forgotten after being in Ireland so long. But there's one man,
a brother-in-law in Fetterangus, Donald Stewart, he's very good
at them old songs, too, and when I get back to Dundee, I'll take
a bit of time to Fetterangus and get back in the proper old songs
again. Because he's a lot older than me, he knows all the real old ones.
Lomax: You were telling me the story of this song, "I'm 
drunk and seldom sober. Do you remember?
Davy: Oh yes. It was a cattle-drover in Ireland. They drove the
cattle mostly all night, going to fairs in the morning, and this
drover - it was back in the year - it was cold weather - driving
cattle along the road and he got - he come to a cottage at night
and he was trying to get his sweetheart to listen to him, and she
was in bed and he sings, "--
I'm often drunk and I'm seldom sober,
I'm a cattle drover from town to town,
And when I'm dead and my days are over,
Sure, lay me down, my Molly Bawn.
