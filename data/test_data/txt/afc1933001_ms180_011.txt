Dear Dr. Spivacke:

I think that in view of the uncertainty at the moment 
of our appropriations, we ought to drop from our list of 
recording trips the expedition planned in collaboration with 
Mrs. Tartt in Livingston, Alabama, and disencumber the amount 
which is still set aside for this purpose.

Respectfully yours,

Alan Lomax
