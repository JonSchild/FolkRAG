T. K. Ervin went to Austin,
With a paper in his hands
To get the intermediate sentence
Passed on the convict man.
He han' de papers to de gov rnor
And there it stood
I know she gonna sign it
'Cause she said she would.

"Yonder comes Bud Russell."
"How in de worl' do you know?"
"Tell him by his big hat
"An' his 44."
He walked into the jailhouse
With the gang of chains in his hands
I heard him tell the captain,
"I'm the transfer man."
