September 24, 1941

Attached are various document prepared by Alan Lomax for your
attention.  The "Recording Plans of the Archive of American Folk-Song" 
has my tentative approval even though Mr. Lomax made some
serious omissions and confuses his personal wishes with the Library's
commitments.  This document, as least, may give you some idea of the
basic aims of the Archive of American Folk-Song.

The "Budget Summary," however, presents a more serious problem.
Of the $15,000 appropriated by Congress for recordings, 80 per cent,
or $12,000, was set aside for the work of the Archive.  As you will
notice, Mr. Lomax's budget may with item C4 exceed that amount.
Furthermore, he has omitted under C the duplication of Herskovitz's
collection at Northwestern University which has already been approved
and which will cost $800.  Finally, he has made no provision for next
Spring, the season when most expeditions start.  For these reasons,
I am not prepared to recommend your approval of any more Archive
undertakings until we have had a chance to examine this budget with
the greatest of care.  I shall attempt to make an appointment with you
later this week.

Respectfully,
Harold Spivacke
