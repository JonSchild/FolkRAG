BESSIE JONES OF THE GEORGIA SEA ISLANDS

The voice of Bessie Jones of St. Simons Island, Georgia, is a pure 
expression of the power of African song style still alive and fructive 
in the rural South. Bessie was born in the red cotton land o f 
North Georgia into a large family of singers, dancers, guitar players 
and leaders of the church. Her grandparents on both sides of the family
had been slaves and they taught her their songs and their singing styl[e ]
style while she was young and impressionable. She forgot none of their 
lessons. In her travels up and down the east coast she added to her 
childhood repertoire, and when whe settled down on St. Simons Island 
she quickly learned the rich tradition of early song forms remembered 
by her friends there. Her repertoire is perhaps the largest and most 
interesting of any Negro informant recorded.

Mrs. Jones presents her material to any audience in a weave of melody 
and anecdote that gives a stirring and memorable picture of the way 
Negro folkways have grown. She is a fine speaker. She has a big, powerful 
and thrilling voice, and she is a person of tremendous dignity 
and charm.
