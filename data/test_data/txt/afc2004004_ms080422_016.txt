shotgun with that thing. I could hit a bird, if he got within
50 foot of me, he gone. I was deadly with a flip. And we
didn't have money to buy shells with, we hunted rabbits with
a flip.
AL: What other kind of meat would you bring into the house with hunting?
Man: They had a lot of back end of a... lot of people never eat
ground hog or coon. They had ground hog in here and they would
go out and get ground hog and the coons, and eat those, too.
But we didn't have no deer or nothing in here, til the government come in here
and stocked it here for us. I was proper grown before I ever
seen a wild deer. There wasn't no deer turned loose in here.
Like I say, ground hogs, coons, and possum- used to be just
crazy about possum. Now you can't hardly eat 'em because they
found out what kinds of animals they actually are and they won't
eat them... they're rodents, they'll eat anything that they can
run across in the woods. They'll take a dead animal there or
anything, if he runs up on it, he'll eat it. But back then
it was hard enough, we'd eat anything we could get our hands on-
whether it was a rodent or what it was. We survived, and that's
all we was thinking about.
AL: Your folks moved from the country to the town- you started
out in the country, right?
Man: well, back then, times was all together different from what
they are today. Everybody then... us boys, we didn't go to town
