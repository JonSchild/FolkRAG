Mr. Max Miller
Office of Civilian Defense
17 Court Street
New York, New York

Dear Mr. Miller:
  
          I have just been informed that you are undertaking 
a program for the collection, analysis, and interpretation 
of rumors in your region. This office has
considerable interest in rumor study, and would like to
keep in touch with what you are doing.
 
           A number of projects of ours are under way, and
we feel that It would be important to have as close
coordination as can be arranged. We have already started
a study emphasizing the two week period ending August 15.
I feel sure that integration of our effort would be to
our mutual advantage.

                                                             Yours very truly,
                      
                                                             Eugene Katz
                                                             Chief, Special Services Division
