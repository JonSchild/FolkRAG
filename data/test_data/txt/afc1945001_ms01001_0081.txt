RUMOR-COMBATTING PROJECTS

The analysis of wartime rumors, and the creation and
development of agencies calculated to combat effectively these rumors,
is a task requiring the most expert direction and execution.  Wartime
rumor, sometimes an obstructive force, can be made a more harmful one
by bungling, but well-meant, attempts at stemming it.  Inexpert efforts
at "rumor-busting" can cause much harm by giving the rumor publicity
which it might not have had otherwise.  Ineffective replies to rumors
can result in fixing the rumor more firmly and more powerfully in the
mind of the person exposed to it.  Injudicious campaigns against rumor
may increase anxieties to the point where rumors are generated on all
sides.
It is the duty of every loyal American to enlist in the 
campaign to prevent the development of virulent rumors.  The Office of War 
Information has been working constantly along these lines and is prepared 
to give the benefit of its experience to this responsible community
agencies engaged in such a campaign.  Although this office cannot undertake
to answer specific rumors submitted, except in rare instances, it can
through its constant preparation of informational materials help eliminate
the more prevalent ones by striking at their root-ignorance-and make available to qualified groups information
which will help silence local rumors.
Essentially, community rumor-combatting projects have two main
branches:  one is the program of analysis, and the other is the program of
education.  These two branches must work closely together, for the rumor
analyses must be coordinated with the sort of educational facilities to be
developed, and the educational programs must be based upon a careful analysis
and thorough understanding of the implications of the rumors reported.
