Dear Alan:

I enjoyed our recent telephone conversation and hope that 
you had a pleasant week-end. Upon returning to the office, I 
found your letter. I phoned the Pentagon but have not been able 
to discover anything for you as yet. You may rest assured that 
I shall bear the matter in mind and if anything turns up let you
know at once. 

I am sorry that you did not like the new records issued and 
am rather surprised to hear it since I thought that they were on 
the whole pretty good. Were you referring to the Anglo-American 
material or the other stuff? As a matter of fact, I thought that 
Ben had uncovered some of your own records which you should have 
included in the first albums. I liked them that much. However,
take either side, the point of view is still flattering. 

This brings to mind the possibility that you may remember still 
other records which should be issued and which both you and Ben have
neglected to include so far. If so, what about preparing an album 
for us right now? If you would send me a list of numbers (or titles)
I could prepare working duplicates for you and send them to  you 
while you are in camp. You could then get the whole album ready in 
short order. As a matter of fact, you probably have more spare time
now than you would in New York. Please let me know at once what you
think of this suggestion. 

With kindest regards, 
Sincerely, 

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Music Division
