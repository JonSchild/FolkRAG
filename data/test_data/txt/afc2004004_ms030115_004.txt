1. I will do my last singing in this land — if a good version of it can be found. Gary wrote the song — it was "a reveal [revival?] song" and it was his favorite
2. Destruction in This Land — a duet with Annie — I have the only version of it recorded 1953 — a great tune.
3. I heard The Angels Singing — The Angels message to me
4. Hesitation Blues — on Pure Faith & Blind Religion.
[Note wrapped around items #5– thru 8 — I think you've neglected these early recordings — all are quite good]
5. Oh Lord Search my heart Yazoo 
6. I am the True Vine                         
7. Have a little more faith in Jesus     
8. Great Change in Me
9. There was a time that I was Blind — Riverside —
10. You got to go Down — Riverside

I don't think any of the sloppy instrumentals should be used.
There is no reason for it since the best are on the banjo album and others. There is reason to use songs of Gary's where the guitar work is off if the song is good and not available on another record.
