With a blare of brazen trumpets came a gorgeous tandem rig
And a lace gown full of lady in a jaunty little gig. 
Swift they swept around the tanbark, while -- 

Edward Adams, a cowpuncher from southwest Colorado, by appointment met me in 
St. Louis and gave me several valuable songs. In addition he sang these three 
fragments which gave the swing of the best examples of cowboy literature. 

Out on the round-up, boys, tell you what you get, 
Little chunk o' bread an' a little chunk o' meat, 
Little black coffee, boys, plumb full o' alkali, 
Dust in your throat, boys, an' gravel in your eye, 
So it's doctor up your cinches, oil your slicker an' your gun, 
For it's out upon the round-up when the green grass comes.

The sheriff followed hard and fast, a merry hombre he, 
He had a posse at his back, a rifle at his knee; 
But when we turned our sixes loose we let the sheriff know 
It took a Jim Dandy to bring us from New Mexico.

There was Hap an' Texas Broncho Jack,
Jiggers an' me an' Bean,
An' we loved a gal by the name o' Sal,
A regular rancho queen.

Oh, it's treat the cook with a pleasant look,
It's sleep in the prickly pear,
It's all day, oh, on the ro-de-o
An' you bet you we'll be there.

E. Goughnor of Livingston, Montana, found these two stanzas of a Texas Mexican
War song floating about in his state. Until now I have not been able to 
discover the other stanzas.

The Maid of Monterey

The moon was shining brightly
All o'er the battle plain
The winds were fanning slightly
The faces of the slain.

The guns had hushed their thunder
The drums in silence lay
Then came the senorita
The maid of Monterey.
