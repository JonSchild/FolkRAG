to it like now.
MRS. DAVIS:
No.
LARRY:
I mean, because it probably was in me, but it took Brother Davis to bring it out.
MRS. DAVIS:
Thats true.
LARRY:
To bring it out.
LIONEL:
If we're getting a lot of noise let me know will you.
LARRY:
It took Brother Davis to bring me out. But you see with me and Brother Davis, what some people might not understand is, I didn't go to him for my music, I just went to him as a friend you know, he was some consolation to me, more so then music you know and I hung around there a long time. I didn't even have a guitar, you know, I just was coming around.
MRS. DAVIS:
Thats true, till he found one.
LARRY:
Till I found one. When I found one I had a guitar.
