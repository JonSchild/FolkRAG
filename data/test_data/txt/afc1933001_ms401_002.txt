IRON HEAD [*alias James Baker*]

Convict No. 3610
Age sixty-three

I first saw Iron Head, late one afternoon when I was recording 
Negro folk tunes in the hospital of the Central Farm
of the Texas Penitentiary System near Sugarland, Texas. Captain 
Gotch had told me that Mexico, a Negro convict and steward 
of the hospital was the best singer on the farm. Only two or 
three convalescents were [in the hospital] patient at the time, so the recording machine 
was set up on the quiet of their large bedroom. Among 
the curious faces pressed against the window bars on the outside, 
while Mexico was singing, I saw a low solidly built Negro 
listening intently. This man beckoned to me. "I'se Iron Head,
a trusty," he said. "I knows lots of 'jumped up sinful' songs,
more than does any of these niggers."
That night and throughout the long day following, Iron 
Head proved that he did know the secular songs the work songs, the gang songs, of the black man. He and his "partner," Clear-Rock, turn and turn about,
sang rhythmic, surging songs of labor; songs of the jailbird;
songs of the "bleed hounds" tracking the fleeing Negro through 
river bottoms; songs of angry "Cap'n"; songs of the loneliness
and dismal monotony of life in the penitentiary; songs of the 
pathetic longing for his "doney"; songs of the bold black desperado, 
with his trusty "forty-fo" in his hand and with his 
enemy lying dead in the smoke pouring from its blue barrel;
songs of his woman "dressed in green, lavender and red," who 
waited hopefully outside the prison walls for his long deferred 
coming, and many others, including several English ballads.
