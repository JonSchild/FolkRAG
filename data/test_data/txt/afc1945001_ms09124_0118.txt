A SOLDIER'S PRAYER
[photo of black soldier]

Dear Lord, today I am in war,
To fight, to die. Tell me what for?
Dear Lord, I'll fight. I do not fear
Germans or Japanese - my fears are
here.

America! . . . Land of the Free:
This is the place that troubles me.
So while I fight wrongs over there,
See that my folks are treated fair.

92nd QM Co.,
Fort McClellan, Ala.
