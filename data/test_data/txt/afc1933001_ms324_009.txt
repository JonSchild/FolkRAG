(NOTE: SKIPPING step for verse 6 only. To skip the Reel will tire 
one out!)

Repeat all these figures as many times as there are couples.

On the very last round, when the last couple finishes the Reel, instead of
"We'll all run away..," sing for verse 6: "Last time around in the old brass
wagon..," etc., and each couple makes an arch in turn as they pass through
the arch at the bottom: -- 1st under the arch makes a 2nd one next to it,
next couple go through 2 arches and make the 3rd, next go under 3 arches and 
make the 4th, etc., etc.

This game is the "Reel part of the"Virginia Reel."  Sometimes the reel is
done cornerwise; the reeling couple swinging each other in the center of
the set and then the boy swinging the last girl while the girl swings the
top boy and so on, the boy moving up the line of girls, the girl going down
the line of boys; then when all have been reeled, 1st couple swing in the
middle and move to bottom place where they make the arch.
