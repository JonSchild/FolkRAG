Fisk, 14.  3. WILL STARK.

Befo' the war,
The late war.

Reason he called for single men
That wasn't afraid to die,
He didn't want to send
Any married men,
And leave his wife to cry.
To the war, 
The late war.

I went over to Cuby.
I went over against my will.
I thought one thing a thousand times,
Hopin' I wouldn't git killed.
In the war, the late war.

The soldiers, the went arunnin;
I went a-runnin, too
Givemy feet a little exercise.
I had nothn else to do.
In the war, the late war.

McKinly asked me why did I run,
[You canâ€™t] Were you afraid to die?
I told him, no, that wasn't why I run,
But because I couldn't fly.
In the war, the late war.

S:  No sir.
A:  Did you think that song was made up by a colored man or a white man?
S:  COlored.  I know it was.
A:  Why?
S:  I don't know for certain, but it was just like a colored man would 
have done anyway.
A:  You mean the way a colored man would act that way in the war?
S:  Well, that was what they think about him, anyhow.
