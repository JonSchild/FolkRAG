It is a fact that Roosevelt is a very
good president.  I have heard that he is
the cause of the United States being in
this war, that if he had not been so
willing to send war material to
all the countries fighting against, Germany,
Italy and later Japan, we would
not be doing without so much.  
People have said that the only reason
we are having rationing in any form
is because Great Britain is having it.
They talk of Great Britain as a allie
that will cause lots of trouble for
the United States.
