Uncle Billy Macree claimed to the 
117 years old. Assuredly he was
more than ninety. My friend the
banker at Jasper, Texas, John Dale, took me
to see Uncle Billy.  First we
opened a gate at the end of a
lane, went down a path with

on either side, then through another

and a chestnut tree.  We found him
seated in a split-bottomed chair
in the front of his cabin
