Natchez:  You know, Kid, the only difference between a prison
                 farm and one of these old-time levee camps is that
                 on a levee camp you can go from one to another when
                 you get ready.  A prison farm, you's on there until
                 maybe you can make a prison break or somethin'.  But
                 [onza] if you're on Charlie Loran's levee camp, you 
                 can quit when you wanna...
The Kid:    (Interrupting)  Well, Natchez, I disagree with you
                 about quittin' the Loran brothers...
Natchez:   What about the Loran brothers?
The Kid:    You [x] couldn' quit the Loran brothers, because it's
                 just the same as a prison farm...
[Sibx]
Natchez:   I understand what you mean...You could run off, but---
Sib:           Why couldn't you quit, Natchez:
Natchez:   Some of those people that worked on those levee camps,
                 they didn't have no pay-day.  You go an' draw , what
                 they call your 'llowance, an' you git so much a week.
                 After that 'llowance was up, that's all you get, an' 
                 maybe sometime you didn' git no pay at all. 
The Kid:    Yeah, an' most of of us didn' know how to read an' write 
                 an' figger.
Natchez:   That's right. That's true.
The Kid:     So they charge us what they wanna.-- twenty-five dollars
                  for a side of side meat. 
Natchez:    That's right.
The Kid:     An' we'd have to stay there until we paid for that.
