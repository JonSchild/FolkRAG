E. E. Tucker,
Great Falls, Montana

Dear Mr. Tucker,

   Allow me to thank you for the most friendly and interesting
letter sent in by anybody during the year.  When my program reaches
people like yourself, who've had troubles and fought against them
and know something about life in this country, that makes me feel
pretty good.  But all these darn school teachers - - - - -
   You couldn't do anything that would please me more than
to send me that "Eleven Center Gorton" record, if you wouldn't mind.
I'd like to make a copy of it for preservation in the folk song collection
in the Library.  Besides it's a song I'm particularly interested in
myself.  Also I'd like to know what other old songs you know, either
good or bad, pure or impure, rough or smooth, sweet or bitter -- that
you have heard about, picked up, sung, hummed or heard hummed anywhere
between South Carolina and Montana.  I'd like to hear about the songs
you've heard and liked and why and I'd like to hear about them all at
one time or in installments as you happen to think about one or remember
it.  If you lived in town, I'd drop in to see you, but Montana
as the feller says is  Hell of a way off for a
visit unless you're going to stay for supper anyhow.  So
let's do it by mail and on the installment plan.  And send me that
record.  Airmail express collect.

Yours sincerely,

Alan Lomax
