Nightengale of the green woods
Oh beautiful
Go bring this letter for me
For my beautiful mistress
On her bed covered with flowers
He took his flight
And went to the chateau of love
On the white breast
Of the beautiful girl
He sang a new song
The beautiful girl woke up

[Ros the nightengale took his flight
to the chateau of love]
"Who are these lying tongues that are singing songs about me."
"They are your lovers who make these songs about you."
"Let them do, [the] let them say, let them speak as they wish"
In spite of jealousy, I love whoever loves me --
And I will love them all of my life.
But I must to go Sunday 
I don't bring nothing from you (of you with me)
So [But] for assurance, give me a kiss on your lips
This is to remind me of you, my love, to remind me of you.
What do you [want I] me to give you, since I've given you so much.
I give you a rose.
The most pretty rose that I have on my rosia (rose-tree)
Rose, oh Rose, oh beautiful rose
You that cost me so dear
