Dear Mr Lomax: 
Thank you for your letter of November 13 in connection with 
the December 10 School of the Air broadcast from Chicago.

As I wrote Mr. Fineshriber, we had some difficulty in checking 
on the Mainer Mountaineers, but we are informed that they 
are in Birmingham, Alabama.

I have checked around for the list of hill billies now broadcasting 
in Chicago, or available in Chicago and enclose a 
partial list. I will undoubtedly have more within the next 
few days and will send the names on to you immediately. Bill 
Ellsworth has helped me in locating these people, and guarantees 
their ability for your purpose. I understand that he knows more 
about hill billies than almost anyone around Chicago.

One of the determining factors in this question is whether you 
must have a union group or whether the budget will provide 
for standbys if the group is not union. As you know, many of 
these groups are non-union and cannot play over the network 
unless we pay union standbys in addition to paying them for 
their services. I'll appreciate having an answer to this as 
soon as possible. All of these people are available in Chicago 
for December 10.

Oklahoma Drifters (The Evans Family) - Ozark Mountain Fiddle
 Band - Union
Fred Kirby - Mountain solo singer with guitar - Union
Christine Campbell - Girl singer with guitar - Union
Red and Ike - The Carolina Mountain Boys - Hill billy harmony 
team with guitar - Union
Randy Barnett - Mountain five-string banjo player and fiddler 
from North Carolina - Non-union

I doubt if you will be able to audition many of these people 
from Washington because they are on local stations only,
