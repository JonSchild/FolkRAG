November 21, 1967

Dear Alan,
Mr. Waters has referred your letter of November 16
to our office, and the quest for a source of your song turned 
out to be an easy matter once we decided that the title was
"That Railroad Rag," instead of "Railroad Rag." 

"That Railroad Rag" was published in 1911 by the
Head Music Publishing Co., New York, with words by Nat. Vincent
and music by Ed. Bimberg. 

We all look forward to your visit to the Library
in connection with the American Anthropological Association
meetings. 

Sincerely yours,
 
( Mrs. ) Rae Korson
Head, Archive of Folk Song
