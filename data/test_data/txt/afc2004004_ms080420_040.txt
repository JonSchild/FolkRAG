Tape: R-6   APPALACHIA   p.9

Man (continued):   I traded it next day for a .22.
Anyway, I knocked the coon out and he finally killed him.

AL:   You were more nervous than the dog was.
(Technical talk).   That hill up there is awful pretty,
Jim, and the cattle on it.   (Technical talk).
(Unintelligible talking).

Man:   (Unintelligible). . . .going to the doctor one day last
week and I didn't want to put him in the garage, and he
followed me.   So he stakes down the truck and watches
me where I'm going (Interruption, the car noise)
and he comes down the stree (car noises interfere with
talk) I'm going in the door and he's on the track and
he comes on up, and I closed the door and looked back out,
and he lay down. . .and Bud Marshall's daughter, she was
working (unintelligible, rumbling) and she said, 'There's
a dog out here, . . .'  and I said, yeah, mines' out there.
So she opens the door and he's sitting out there and
I'm sitting over there on the couch.   Bud Marshall comes
out and he says, that your dog? and I say yeah, and he
said, boy, he must be good, and I said, yeah, he'll do
anything I tell him to.   I said why not come in here and
lay down and he came in and lay down. . .(unintelligible)
. . .how did you train him to be like that?   And I says
I can't train dogs, that dog was like that when I got him.

AL:   That's a beautiful story.

Man:   That's all I got against him, he likes to go with me
everywhere I go, he don't like to stay in the truck.
