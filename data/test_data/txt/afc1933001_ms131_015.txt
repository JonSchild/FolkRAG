Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Ball
Rugby, Virginia

Dear Sir and Madam:

    My father, John A. Lomax, has gone to
Europe for the summer and I am, therefore, answering 
in his place. I am sorry to have to inform 
you that as yet we have no machine for making 
duplicates of the records here in the Archive,
and I cannot say definitely when we will acquire
one. I will, however, put your application near
the top of the list so that, when we do get the
facilities for making them, you can have your records 
at once.

    I have heard your records and have listened 
to story after story about you both from Bess
and my father, and I certainly feel cheated that I
wasn't able to come to Galax and meet you all. I
hope it will be possible for to come to Galax for
the next Old Fiddler's Contest.

    Sincerely yours,

    Assistant in Charge.

AL/mh
