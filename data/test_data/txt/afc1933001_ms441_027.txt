Julie Ann Johnson 

When L.B. was in the Texas penx , he used to think [about] 
[?] a lot about a woman of his, named Julie Ann 
Johnson. He began to sing about her when his "axe was 
walkin' an' de chipses was a-talkin' " and The song became his 
[own] personal work-song 

At night, entertaining [the] guards and visitors 
with his guitar, L.B. sang "Julie Ann Johnson" 
in fast time so that anybody could dance to it. The song 
fitted his voice and it became a favorite, 
with him, especially when he was playing for white folks. 
When we visited him in 1933 on the Louisiana 
State Penal farm at Angola, he sang us "Julie Ann Johnson." 
We recorded it and put it in "American Ballads and Folk-Songs" #
x In that version there is no mention of Martha, his present 
wife. 

But 1935 is, as L.B. says, "a bran' new year an' we oughta 
say,' Looky here.'" In January, 1935, with Martha coming from 
Shreveport to New York to marry him, L.B. sang the following 
version: 

Miss Julie Ann Johnson, 
O Lawd; 
Miss Julie Ann Johnson, 
Oh-ho

I'm gonna leave you, 
O Lawd; 
I'm gonna leave you, 
Oh--ho. 

Gonna marry Marthy, 
[Oh Lawd,] Po' girl, 
Gonna marry Marthy, 
[Oh Lawd] Po' girl. 

Um--umm-um
Um--um
Um--um--um, 
Um--um. 

And [in] by March, married to Martha, he was singing: 

Done got Married, 
Oh Lawd; 
Done got married, 
Oh--ho. 

L*A moon.

ballads L.B. is merely conforming 
to a ballad convention. 

**Not intended to be funny, this refrain 
has a significance for L.B. It is part 
of the American ballad tradition in which 
"Po'Boy' is one of the most important [ballad]
