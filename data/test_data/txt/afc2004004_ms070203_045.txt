out sleep - sends 
or gives her money 
away - has a head 
full of sweetness & memories 
& a beautiful 
garden - she feeds me 
gingerale & cookies 
& wants to do my washing 
free - she is the maid 
of all work of the old 
regime in Hungary 
& she is beautiful 
& sad & dead - I 
hope she goes to Heaven
