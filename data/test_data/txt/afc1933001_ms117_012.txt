Washington, D. C.

Dear Dr. Spivacke:

    Referring to your letter of Jan .22nd, we will
be glad to exchange the ten inch records mentioned at full credit
for twelve inch.

    Incidentally these were invoiced to Mr. John
Lomax some time ago and I understand that the Library was to
pay us for them. No payment has been received therefore if you
will merely return them, we will consider the invoice for them
as cancelled and invoice out fifty twelves when we get word
from you to ship them.

    Enclosed please find folder on our equipment
together with price list. We build a university model of machine
and professional model in addition to the field machine. The
first two operate from alternating current and the latter from
a single storage battery.

    I am planning a trip to Washington some time
in the near future and would like very much to demonstrate our
machine to you as well as to any other departments you might
suggest.

    In addition to the machines described in the
folder we also build special equipment for specialized recording,
such as conference recording and telephone recording. For the
letter purposes it has been necessary to develop a disc 
transcriber which transcribes disc records with the same convenient
devices as used for Dictaphones, namely, a stop and start foot
control as well as a stepback foot control. We have also built
equipment designed for the rerecording of cylinders to discs
and also have furnished a rerecording service for cylinders. In
this manner cylinder collections can be transferred to more
permanent media and transcription undertaken as well without
harm to the originals. For this purpose we use a special electric
pickup which absolutely does not wear the cylinder noticably
even if it is played over as many as fifty times.

    Very truly yours
    Lincoln Thompson
    President
