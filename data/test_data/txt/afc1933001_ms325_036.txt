sociated with the economic progress of a 
nation or region, is a conditioning factor 
of the physical and mental well-being of 
its inhabitants, and is fundamental in de- 
terming the place of living. 
For the purpose of ascertaining the 
relative position of the South in the na- 
tion with respect to the factor of income, 
an analysis of the most recent pertinent
data supplied by income studies of the 
National Bureau of Economic Research, 
the Brookings Institution, and the Na- 
tional Industrial Conference Board was 
mae. It must be realized that income 
differentials to be pointed out are not 
necessarily representative of similar dif- 
ferences in economic welfare. And "per 
capita" figures, which will be used to 
measure these differentials, reveal nothing 
concerning the distribution of the income. 
They do not approximate reality but are 
useful in providing a theoretical basis 
of comparison, either among different 
years or different areas. Furthermore, 
the income figures of these three studies 
are not strictly comparable because of 
slight variation in their coverage of items 
comprising the income estimates. 
In this article the South, which is more
strictly the Southeast, is delimited to in- 
clude the following twelve states: Vir- 
ginia, West Virginia, North and South 
Caroline, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, 
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, 
and Arkansas. 

National Bureau of Economic 
Research Data 

In the year 1919, according to figures 
obtained from the study by Maurice Leven 
of the National Bureau of Economic Re- 
search, Income in the Various States, 
the twelve states comprising the South 
were among the fifteen lowest ranking 
states in per capita income. With a per 
capita figure of $378 they had little mor e
than half as much income as the people 
outside the South. The average income 
per person throughout the nation was 
$630, but the rest of the country, that is, 
the United States with the exclusion of 
the SOuth, has a per capita income of 
$706. 
In 1920 the per capita income of the 
South declined to $362, while that of the 
rest of the country was increased to $775. 
With about one-fourth of the nation's 
population the South was able to command 
only one-eighth its income. The South 
attracted nothing of the 6 billion dollar 
rise in national income, two-thirds of 
which went to the Middle Atlantic and 
East North Central States. In short, the 
relative position of the South as to in- 
come was unchanged in 1920, but a little 
more accentuated or sharply defined. 
In 1921, largely because of the great 
advance between the beginning and the 
end of the year in the value of securities 
and real estate as measured in terms of 
consumption goods, the national income 
showed an increase of 12 billion dollars. 
However, the South, being predominant- 
ly agricultural, experienced only a slight 
gain in per capita income. Its figure 

capita income of $1,093. The South 
was lowest with a figure of $368, which 
was about one-third as great. The aver- 
age per capita income of the balance of 
the country, that is, excluding the South, 
was $860. The figure of the South was 
only 43 per cent as great, In other 
words, Southern income per person wa s
roughly two-fifths that of the rest 
of the nation. 
Differentials existing in 1929 among 
individual states were naturally more strik- 
ing than those among geographic divi- 
sions. The per capita income of Florida, 
with its citrus fruit industry and large 
tourist trade, and West Virginia, with its 
bituminous coal mines and steel and iron 
mills, served to hold up the average figure
of the South. That figure does not fully 
indicate the meagerness of incomes in 
several Southern states. While the South 
as a whole received 49 cents for every 
dollar received on the average throughout 
the nation, South Carolina's correspond- 
ing portion was only 35 cents. For ever 
35 cents received by South Carolinians, 
the people of New York State received
$1.82 and those of Delaware, $1.75. 
Mississippi fared almost as poorly. It at- 
tracted only 38 cents of the national dol- 
lar. Every state of the Middle Atlantic 
region had a per capita income three to 
five times larger than either South Caro- 
lina's or Mississippi's. 
Arkansas received only 41 cents to every 
dollar received on the average by the na- 
tion's inhabitants. North Carolina receiv- 
ed 42 cents of the national dollar; Ala- 
bama, 44 cents; Georgia and Tennessee, 
46 cents; Kentucky, 53 cents; Virginia, 
57 cents; and Louisiana, 58 cents. The 
income of any Middle Atlantic state was 
at least twice that of the above mentioned 
states, and in some cases more than four 
times greater. 
In the twelve states of the South, the 
income of the farm population, that is, 
all persons actually living on farms, was 
below $200 per capita in every state 
except Florida, the average for the group 
of states being $163. The farm income 
of the rest of the country in 1929 was 
$345 per capita, or more than twice that 
of the South. This is particularly dis- 
astrous when one realizes that approxi- 
mately half the South's population is de- 
pendent directly upon agriculture as a 
source of income. It is also a serious in- 
dictment against national economic wel- 
fare in general and agricultural welfare 
in particular for nearly one half the na- 
tion's farm population is in the Southeast- 
ern quarter of the United States. 
The non-farm population of the South, 
which includes all those not actually living 
on farms, was only 14 per cent greater 
than the farm population, but it com- 
manded almost four times as much of the 
total income of the region as did the lat- 
ter. Its per capita income of $546, how-
ever, ranked lowest of the various sections 
of the country. It was little more than 
half that of the non-farm population of 
the rest of the country, which received 
a money income of $975 per capita. 

Significance of the Condition 

The analysis of Southern income based 
on these three independent, authoritative 
estimates has necessarily been somewhat 
superficial, but has evolved at least one 
indisputable fact, namely, that Southern 
income with respect  o population is about 
half that of the rest of the country. The
real significance of the lowness of the 
South's income lies essentially in the fact 
that costs of living between the South and 
other parts of the country are comparable, 
if not virtually equal. Differences in 
money income therefore serve largely to 
measure similar differences in living 
standards. The South's low income is not 
compensated by reduced living costs, and 
the region must necessarily enjoy a less 
adequate living and experience less eco- 
nomic well-being. This condition is re- 
flected in poor health conditions and fa- 
cilities, the dire need of re-housing for 
millions of Southern families, little pur- 
chasing power, the lack of necessary food 
and clothing, inadequate credit facilities, 
and insufficient capital with which to de- 
velop the region's abundant natural re- 
sources and industrial potentialities. The 
South is living close to poverty. 
The South has the reputation of being 
the part of the country where living costs 
are the lowest. The general assumption 
is that Southerners need less income to 
experience economic well-being. But this 
is a popular belief, not a scientific conclu- 
sion. Drs. Wilson Gee and William F. 
Ogburn, in different and independent 
studies comparing costs in representative 
cities in the South and outside of it, have 
both shown that the prevailing impression 
that living is cheaper in the South is a 
questionable one. Total subsistence costs 
of living to the same standard are much 
the same in Southern cities as in those of 
other parts of the nation. Lower incomes 
in the South necessitate lower standards 
of living, which are usually confused with 
lower costs of living. It costs the South- 
erner as much to live as the person outside
the South, but he naturally cannot afford 
to spend as much. This fact makes for 
a lower standard and less adequacy of 
living. 
The data advanced by Drs. Gee and 
Ogburn apply only to wage earners in 
cities, although it may rather safely be 
argued that they apply in much the same 
manner to all urban classes. They can- 
not with any degree of validity however, 
be extended to the rural population. A 
study by Dr. E. L. Kirkpatrick, The 
Farmer's Standard of Living, on the com- 
parative cost of living in the various rural 
areas of the United States indicates that 
the annual cost of living was less by ap-
proximately $100 in the Southern States 
considered than in those of the New Eng- 
land and North Central States. On the 
other hand, indication based on the dis- 
tribution of the total value of goods used 
are that the Southern families considered 
in the study enjoyed a somewhat less 
adequate living.
