She burnt her coal & didn't 
warm herself -

I knew hims since his boots
cost fourpence

There is hope from the sea
but no hope from the graveyard

He that loses the game let him
talk away

No matter what age you are,
you don't look it.

How's the piano - Sure, it's
all right, we're towing it behind us

Dying Irishman told to renounce
the devil said - O no I'm
going to a strange country & I
don't want to make enemies.
