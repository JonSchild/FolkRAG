Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am very glad to hear from you, and glad to know that your
cut in the royalties of the book was large enough to be useful. From what
I have heard the book continues to sell well and should make us a nice little piece of money before it drops.

The publishers seem satisfied with it and have asked me to
prepare material for another like it. It seems also to have been well liked
by a number of educational boards who have asked permission to quote parts of it, and it has brought me a lot of material from people, may of them school teachers who have been collecting similar stuff.

Yes, I fancy I was in a rather low state when I last met you in
Washington. Though I didn't know it then, I had used up my last resources
of nervous energy, and [???] just before Christmas I crashed.  Went to pieces completely, and had to come home. I've been here ever since early in January "farming" two acres of ground with a [???] hand plow and a hoe.  I've had enough and more vegetables for our use and some really lovely flowers which I have greatly enjoyed. Aside from weeding out the best of the items I have of the Mother Goose type, answering absolutely necessary correspondence and sketching (I've gotten to where I do rather [???] good pictures), I haven't done much of anything, and except for a trip to Fort Worth and once to Austin I haven't stirred from home, and feel little inclined to do so.

I was really ill and for a long time.  I don't think I ever want
to get so deeply wrapped up in anything as I was in that book and I'll never work as hard again [??] on anything as I did to assure a good break for it. I Had some plans by which I hoped to cash in some extra money on it while it was hot but I had to shelve all these when I fell ill but [???] it doesn't seem to matter nearly so much as it did.

I really believe there is a good market for another such book and
perhaps still another if there is sufficient choice material for it and that
there will be a definite place for a complete [???] and conscientious study
of the child lore with melodies and interesting notes of origin or variants
and several of the teachers among my correspondents have suggested the preparation of a sort of folk-lore course, a kind of text book which might be suitable for use in primary grades and a book of traditional child games with good illustrations also for use in primary grades. [???] These are very interesting to comtemplate, but I don't know enough about teaching, or kid psychology to even visualize such a book.

Thanks again for your letter. I am truly glad to hear from you
and I should particularly like to know [??] when "The Singing Country" is
likely to be on the market.  I've very anxious to see it.

Best of luck to you and best wishes for your health. Give my
regards to Miss Terrell, Alan, and others.

Sincerely,
Roy Ward
