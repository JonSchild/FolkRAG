ROSELILLI
(Denmark)

(Page 182 - Folk Songs of Many Peoples, Vol.II.)


Rosalillie and her mother together they sat
And told many jokes which they gaily laughed at.

Ho ho ho, so so so so!
Ho ho ho, so so so so!
And told many jokes which they gaily laughed at.


Said the maiden, "To my love I will ne'er faithful be
Till blossoms of gold grow on each garden tree."


Mr. Peter by the door listened quite carefully:
"He laughs best who laughs last," to himself said he.


When they came to the garden what did they behold,
On each garden tree hung a bright ring of gold.


Roselillie blushed as red, bright as red blood could be,
And down in the grass at her feet gazed she.


Then her lover, Mr. Peter, her lips kissed with glee.
"He laughs best who laughs last, ha, ha, ha." said he."
