Mrs. Ruby Terrill Lomax
400 East 34th Street
Austin, Texas

My dear Mrs. Lomax:

Mr. Lomax has asked that Mr. Strunk
send him half a dozen Library franks to
be used in forwarding to us the package
of records which he and Alan have made.

Our mailing division informs us that
it would be better for you to forward
these records by express collect, addressing
them to the Archive of American Folk
Song, Music Division, Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.

Hoping that this arrangement will be
satisfactory to you, I am

Very truly yours,

Secretary, Division of Music
