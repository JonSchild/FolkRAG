A     (continued) 
In an anecdote you don't tell the facts, but
you tell what you're really thinking about,
and what you really want.  It gives the value,
instead of running through the situation, and
it's a much better way to settle a point than
to actually have us all in conference about
it.  Just tell a story that has the point in
it.  And that's the way Lincoln ran the
country, and apparently it's the way that
it's still being run, right there in the Halls
of Congress - the American style, to tell a
funny tale.  And Tommy was the master at that.
