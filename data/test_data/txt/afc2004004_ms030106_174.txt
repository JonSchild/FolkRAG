Now there would be from time to time, if they didn't
meet a friendly tribe towards them, which I thought when 
I was a child they was really Indians -- I thought they had 
the paints and everything else on them, just like the
Indians would and some with the blankets [on], and so forth
and so on. Women never was in these masquerades at all. 
They'd meet a real[ly] enemy. The enemy would walk up to --
what you'd call the spyin' boys -- they would use them about
two blocks ahead. I had a little experience in it myself.
I happened to be a spy boy -- they was always kids [we] that did the 
spyin'. These were real men that did this Indian dance and 
played the Indians, and their main object was to make the 
enemy bow. And they would use this word when a spy boy would
meet another spy boy, they'd say:

Bow-wow
Bow-wow
Ah noe
Bow-wow

I don't remember all the words they used to use, and they'd
point their fingers to the ground, "Bow-wow," and if they 
wouldn't bow, they would use the Indian call:

Woo-woo-woo-woo
