Dear Spivacke:
Dick Devall, Route 2, Reed, Oklahoma, came here Monday and the Sellers Co. Recording Studios made recordings of 18 of his cowboy songs for $4 for each of the nine records, & left the library to settle with him. I also told Mr. Devall that you would furnish him with copies (recorded) of all his songs.
I was disappointed with the quality of his singing but he did, as I think, give the peculiar cowboy twang, a sort of lonely appeal, to his singing. I think you should send him a check to cover expenses. 
Yours sincerely,
John A. Lomax
