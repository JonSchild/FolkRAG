My dear Mr. Lomax:
The enclosed letter covers our discussion 
concerning Program advertising. Please sign all copies of 
this agreement and retain the second copy for your files and 
return the remaining copies to us. These ads, as you know, 
have been running since the February issue of Program and I 
appreciate greatly your willingness to cooperate with us on 
this. 

It was certainly grand to have a real talk 
with you yesterday and I hope you can get the material for your 
circular to Mr Erstein immediately so that we can get your circular 
made up as soon as possible as I am sure this will help a 
great deal in securing dates for you.

These costs are to be deducted at the rate 
of $10 per engagement from your fees next season. 

Sincerely yours,
Isabel R. Scott w
