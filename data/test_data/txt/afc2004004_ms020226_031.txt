BJ TAPE 11, p. 29

But that day she went to talkin' 'bout the stockin's.  I didn' know what in the worl' she wa' talkin' about no stockin's.  I couldn't understand it.  So she went to cussin' me an' raisin' san'.  It was funny to me.  I, in a way, I couldn'...

AL:  What did she call you, Bessie?

BJ:  All kinda black things.  Black barrels an' bulls an' everything else.  An' so, but I was, ah, much stout, you know?  An' I had good much muscles an' everything, an' so... An' she, I think she thought I could whip 'er.  An' so, but, anyway, when she cuss an' went on an' she damn me out the house, wa'n' nothin' for me to do but come on out.  'Cause so many peoples jus' stan' there lookin' with their haids out the windas an' some comin' down, walkin', to see what it all about.  An' I didnn' know what it was all about.  I still asked to know what it was.

An' she, "You know what it is, you know..."

Then I... When she see me comin' on out there, then, she standin' in the do'.  Look like she thought I gonna go back.  So I kept on walkin'.  I tol' her to meet me half, half-way at the yard.  The yard, ya know.  Our yards divided, ya know, meet, met together.  Jus' a pass between the yards, ya know?

So that was a point.  She meet me there, it be all right.  I said... So, Miss Ross, she hollered to me.  Said, "No, nothin' like that."  She come on down there.  That was my aunt, in a way, you know?  She was one of my step-father's, ah, sisters, or sumpin'.  But anyhow, I call her Aunt... my aunt.  An' she come on down there 'cause she knowd me.  I was the on'iest one that she -- She's the on'iest one -- longest person there knowed me.  You know, or know anything about me.  Ah, that was... 'cause Mama's in Millen (Milan) then another in place I was at when I went back to Fitzgerald, out, I was out from Fitzgerald, Abbeyville (Abbottville?).
