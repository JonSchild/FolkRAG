Gentlemen:

I have been in Austin, Center, Fort Worth, Paris, 
Texarkana, Orange, Beaumont, and Houston, Texas and in
Leesville, Alexandria, and Marksville, Louisiana during
the past two weeks and I have not heard a "rumour" of any
kind.  Most people express their personal opinion about 
various activities, but none of them are "rumours."
Very truly yours,

Curtis O. Booher
