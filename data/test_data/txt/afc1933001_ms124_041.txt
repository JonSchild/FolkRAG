Dear Mr. Lomax:-

I must offer my apologies for keeping you waiting so long, 
but affairs of this kind never seem to move as quickly as we expect.  Only 
yesterday I heard the results of the dubbing done up at the Columbia Studios, 
and I still want Mr. Clarke to hear them before anything more can be done.  
Meanwhile I am sailing for Europe tomorrow night. However, I can assure you 
your records are in good hands.  It will interest you to know that the Hayti 
record has been taken off for you on Instantite, and sounds quite well.

I will ask Mr. Clarke to hold the discs for you until I return 
unless he hears from you to the contrary.  You can address him at the Association 
of American Colleges, 19 West 44th Street, New York (Eric Clarke).

Yours sincerely,
Philip L. Miller
