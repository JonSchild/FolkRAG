times we used to laugh!  Ha, a-ha!  'Cause all of 'em call 'im
"Mister Reese," every devilish one of 'em!  Yessir, every one I
know about.
AL:  He didn't let them call him . . .?
BJ:  I don't know about the "let," but they called him that.
Hum, I don't know whe' (whether) he just told them or not, but
that what he be sayin'.  He say, I, he'd say, 'cause he know,
he'd tease Mama an' them, an' . . . Mama, Mama was his sister's
chile, ya know.  He's say, "Jack, I, I don' wan' 'em to tell
me, um, 'Mister Reece git off mah haid!"  I wan' 'em to say,
'Mister Reece, git offa my hai-ar . . .' " Hah!  He could say it 
in that po' so (?) way!  Ha, ha, ha, he used to say . . .
He got enough of that stuff!
He married 'em dead!  They was already dead when he married 
'em.  You know, 'bout these half-dead women.  Oow, they was
so . . . He married 'em when they was  . . .
AL:  How is it to be half-dead?  I don't quite understand this.
BJ:  Jus' ol, 'ol' sickly womens.  I say they done half-dead
when they marry him.  They think they gonna git a doctor an' git
'em cured up, I guess!  But anyway, he sho'  . . . He had fi' --
He had, ah seven, but the last one he died an' left, hisse'f.
He had done come through then; he's holy sanctified.  [When} Befo'
he died!  Wa 'n' that sumpin'!  You know what my Grandmama told
me? Ah, she said that, ah, when I went back up home an' told
her that I was, I was, that I was sanctified.  Bless her heart.  'Cause
she changed, too; she didn' understan' it.   She said, "Miss Bessie?
You got holy sanctified?"
I said, "Yes, ma'am."  An' I was readin' the Bible to her.
She said, "Honey," she say, "You know what?"  Said, "Gene
got that thing an' he didn't live but two years."
