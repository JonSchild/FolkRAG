[*Mother part Indian -was a granny.*]
[I understand] Just saying my mother, you know, she was  part Indian, and she learnt 
a lot of remedies from her, from the Indian Folks, you know, and she
cured the woman of all female troubles.  And she was a granny, you know, too.
Yeah, and she [did all those little things]  'tended to all those things
when I was just a boy.  And she used to have me go out, [you know,] and
dig different herbs for her, you know.  She used witch hazel [in] root a lot of [the] it
[brewings] grew in Louisiana you know.  Down there you can get most any kind of a herb,
you know.  She would send me and show me what kind [of herb] to dig, and
I would dig em and she would make the medicine and cure the women and
some of those things I larned, and when I left home and came to
Texas here, of course a lot of the remedies that she used [came] I kept um in

got most of the remedies from the Indians because she [was left] reared up with 
the Indians, and her father - she was taken from her father, and he
was sold when she was quite young, and she didn't get to associate
you know, with her father, you know, very much.  And there were 7 [some] 
of em, of the children, and they was sold and scattered .  Her youngest
brother and her oldest brother is the only two that she could give
much account of.  [From her] They hung her older brother because the white
man bought him and wanted to give him 50 lashes before he started in to
work and he hadn't did anything, and he attempted to do it and he killed
