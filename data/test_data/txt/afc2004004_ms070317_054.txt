I hope you walk down the streets
The sun be so hot it burn yo'
m-fing feet
And then I even wish you have the
m-fing bloody piles
And wants to take a trap
I hope you go to the s-house
To take a trap
You and the sh have a [?]
And you break yo' m-fing [?]

The Dozens
I saw yo' mama floatin' down the
stream
Eating cow-chips and cold ice
cream
Stand by yo' house & picked up an
old rusty nail
Looked up at yo' door &
see pussy for sale.
