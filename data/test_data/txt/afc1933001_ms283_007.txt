I was born in a canebrake and suckled by a lion, 
Head like a bombshell and teeth made out of iron
Forty rows of jawteeth and holes punched for more
I come from ourangutang where the bullfrogs jump from north to 
south.

Gimme one hundred yards start and I'll run plumb to Honululu 
without getting my feet wet
Shoulder five hundred bushels of shot and wade through solid 
rock up to my shoulder blad s
Any darn man don't believe it 
I'll snatch him bald headed and spit on the place where the hair 
come off
Take a leg off him and beat him in the face with the bloody end
of it.
Slap his head up to a peak and knock the peak off
Take his eye out and eat it for a grape

Thirty two inches between the eyes and they feed me with a shovel
Mount the wild ass and leap from crag to crag
Raised on six shooters till I was old enough to eat ground shot-guns
When I'm cool I warm the gulf of Mexico and bathe therein 
When i'm hot there's an equinixial breeze that fans me fevered brow
The moans of widows and orphans is music to my melancholy soul.
I'M the boy that chewed the wad the goat et that butted the bull off  
the bridge....
Somnaturally the people got to loving their outlaws, bandits and gunfighters.....
These were the men who had always taken from 
the rich to give to the poor.. a factor in their favor since Americans 
all knew what poverty was and shared their likings in songs 
....take the ballad of Sam Bass the great Texas trainrobber...
It's nearly as long as the Buffalo Skinners so I won't sing it all...
just give you the last couple of verses to show you what the people 
thought about the man who turned Sam in... the (Jim) Murphy mentioned 
is the man who acted as stool pigeon on Sam....

Sam met his fate at Round Rock, July the 21st
They pierced poor Sam with rifle balls and emptied out his
purse
Poor Sam he is a corpse and six feet in the clay
And Jackson's in the bushes trying to get away.

Jim had borrowed Sam's good gold and didn't want to pay
The only shot he saw was to give poor Sam away
He sold out Sam and Barnes and left their friends to mourn
O what a scortching Jim will get when Gabriel blows his horn.
