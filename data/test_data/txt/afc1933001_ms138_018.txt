Dear Mr. Spivacke: 
I was so glad to have had the chance of meeting you the 
other day, even though it was for a few minutes only. I 
promised at that time to send  you a letter regarding the use 
we made of the Library of Congress records in connection with 
Mr. Alistair Cooke's series on American folk songs.  I now
enclose this letter, with apologies for its delay.  Please 
feel free to use this letter in any way you wish.  
Mr. Lomax has been of invaluable help to us in this series
on Negro songs, and I must thank you most warmly for allowing
us to make use of the Library's recordings. 
With kindest regards, 
Yours sincerely, 
Felix Greene
