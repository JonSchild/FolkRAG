My dear Mr. Lomax:
Your inquiry regarding the article in the
Kansas City Star about "Home on the Range" at hand.   I turn to
my files and find the article, written by A. B. Macdonald of the
Star's staff, and published in the Sunday edition, October 25,
1936.   I called the Star and asked if I might secure the article,
but they informed me they do not keep papers that far back.   I then
called Mr. Macdonald - and he says he has no copy.   So the only
thing I can do is copy the one I have send you, since I do not
want to part with my own. 
So, enclosed herewith is copy of the history
of "Home on the Range", which appeared in The Kansas City Star,
October 25, 1936, page 4 D.
With all good wishes, I am,
Cordially yours,
(Mrs. A. B. Hoover)    Gene Boardman Hoover
