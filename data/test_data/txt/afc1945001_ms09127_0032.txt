C. P. A. 
Izzy Cohen was drafted.  When he 
got in the army he signed his name
Izzy Cohen C.P.A.  The camp where he was
stationed books were in a mess
and the Commanding officer called 
Izzy in and gave him an office and
said he would give him a month to
straighten the books outs.  Izzy had
a very enjoyable month because he
had no duties to preform. At the end 
of the month the books were not touched
and the Com. Officer called Izzy in. 
He asked Izzy why a C.P.A. like him
couldn't alter the books.  Izzy replied, 
this CPA stands for Cleaning, Pressing and
Alterations.
