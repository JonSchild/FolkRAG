said the word.
I am leaving the twenty
records in the Music Division, those
that Mr. Putnam might be amused by.
If he is commercial in Hollywood,
however, I am at the moment opposed
to handing them over to him without
further discussion. 
Tell father, when he comes, 
that I worked my head off on the ballad
book the last three weeks I was
in town and the only reason I didn't
finish was because there was too
much to do.
I spent all day yesterday 
I spent with Miss Meyer. She seduced 
me off to play records for
Pare Lorentz at 7:30 at night. He
was very tired, very cross and rude
as hell, the big executive from
Hollywood, I suppose. I don't think
he liked the records much and, of
course they are not particular good. 
Miss Meyer tried to get me to say
that they were from Mexico instead of
from San Antonio and thereabouts and
I think Pare couldn't see Mexican
records from Texas somehow. I felt
like writing him an insulting letter,
but restrained myself. You'd better
patch things up.
