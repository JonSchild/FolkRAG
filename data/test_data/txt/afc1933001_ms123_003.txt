M. Dartigue
Department of Rural Education
Port-au-Price, Haiti

Dear M. Dartigue:

I have been afraid that perhaps the record I made for you was 
not satisfactory. You can expect, therefore, under separate cover, 
a substitute with Leogane rara on one side and the singing on your
Chatar drum quartet on the other. Later on, I hope to be able to 
send you some duplicates of better quality but at present I am not
equipped to do better work.

I have accepted a place here in the folk-song archive for the 
next year, and if this puts me in the position to do you and your 
rural education movement any favors, I shall be delighted. In the 
meantime, I am 

Sincerely yours,

AL:rep

P. S.
Please give M. Sylvain my best regards and tell him that I am 
very sorry not to have seen him again before my departure from
Haiti.
