     And there was a hawg pen right down below that.  This was
on a knoll, a lil' hill.  A lil' -- Right on the edge of the field,
[there] was a hawg pen down there, which was the [end] edge of the woods
and the field.  An' this man's hawgs was dyin'. . .I don't care how
fine they be.  Couldn't never see nothin' that ailed them hawgs.
An' that's what it was.
     After those snakes was killed, he raised hawgs.
TL:  I'll be darned.
BJ:  Tha's, tha's right.  The man was named Mr. Ace Fla (SOMEONE
LIKE AMOS FLEMENT IS REFERRED TO IN A PREVIOUS TAPE; THE SAME
ONE?)
     But, [but] he got, he got 48 rattlesnakes out there.  An' we don't
know the number of black snakes an' cordswhips (?).  He was
puttin' 'em -- Ya know how they do when they come up?  I seen
those snakes, I                       you, for years.  You know, as I lay
down.  Especially I, the one that struck at me.  Then he was
ketchin' them things. . .Jus' ketchin' 'em an' he had, he had this
gig an' he catch 'em an' when he do it he jus' hold 'em like
that an' put sumpin', an' do sumpin' [wi'] in their mouth.  [Say] He said
he's pullin' out poison teeth.  That's with rattlesnakes.  An'
then, they jus' [droppin'] wroppin' all around [us] his -- oh, [jus'] everywhere.  An'
they put 'em in that, in [the] that thing.  He had separated places for
'em an' them things was cuttin' crazy in there, in that cage.
     Brother, I had a time.  Me[n], not only me, an' many more
chilren, ya know?  Jus' see them snakes!  I guess the grown
folks, too.  An' you see, an' you see 'em every time you shut
your eyes.  An' so they said not to worry 'em no more, but --
I didn't pick no more huckleberries.  Regardless of what, I
didn't pick no more.
