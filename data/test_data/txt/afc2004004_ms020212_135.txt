Dear Miss Kemper:
     I have a small collection of portraits of singers of
St. Simon's Island, which you may look at in my office.
The film was made by Ted Carpenter, Head of Anthropology,
Valley State College, Valley State, California.
     It portrays the same people I have photographed, taken
against a neutral black background.  I have a copy that
you could look at in my office, or you could write Mr. Carpenter
for a copy.
Yellin's pictures are by far the best I know of.
Sincerely,
Alan Lomax
