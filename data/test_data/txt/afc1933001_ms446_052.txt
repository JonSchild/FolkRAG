CHORUS:
I'm a going thru, yes, I'm a going thru,
I've paid the price whatever others do,
I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few, 
For I've started to Jesus, and I'm a going thru,

Oh, brethen, now will you take up the cross,
And give up this world and count it as dross?
Go sell what thou hast and give it to the poor,
And go thru with Jesus and those who endure,
(Chorus repeated.)

Many there are who have started in the race,
But with the light they refuse to keep pace,
Others excepted because it is new,
And there's not very many expect to go thru.
(Chorus repeated).

I'd rather walk with Jesus alone,
And have for my pillow, like Jacob, a stone,
Living each moment with His face in view,
Than to shrink from my pathway and fall to 
go thru.

THE ROMISH LADY

There was a Romish lady brought up in popery,
Her mother always taught her the priest she must
obey;
O, pardon me, dear mother, I humbly pray thee
now,
For unto these false idols I can no longer bow.

Assisted by her handmaid, A Bible she conceal'd
And there she gained instruction, till God his love
