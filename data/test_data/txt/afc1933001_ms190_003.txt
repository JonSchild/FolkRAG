Dear John:

     I've been trying to arrange to get a gas and tire
rationing ruling in connection with my application for you to
Rosenwald. I was not successful in this. Therefore, I have
written Rosenwald Foundation, saying that it looked like my
plan in this connection was not a practical one. If, however,
I could back up an application you wish to make on your own,
you know I would be fully behind you. This hurts me at least
as much as it does you, since I had set my heart on having some
sort of folklore collecting to go on during the war, and since I 
felt that the people in the field could be of great use to the
Office of War Information.

     If you bump into any local songs or other folklore
that has wartime significance, such material would be very useful
to me. I hope you're east some time, or I'm west, and we
can get together again for a good talk-fest. I've seen Jo and
she seems to be right peart. 

     My regards to you and yours.

     Sincerely yours,

     Alan Lomax
     Division of Educational Services
