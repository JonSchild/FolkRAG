Charlie Wells
Derby Ram
We used to sing that in public houses, that's all.
We used to have songs pretty near every Saturday
night in the pub. 
What was your favorite pub?
Oh dear. Where I was born & bided till I was 19
years old was the Half Moon & The New Inn. Then when
I got big enough to run after skirts - "The Volunteer"
& The Crish Hand. 3 miles there & 3 miles back. 
There was singing every Saturday night, and accordion, 
somebody or other had a 'cordion there, &
another a tambourine.

All very good
