7.
HOLD THE FORT

British Transport Workers'
Strike Song

English Gospel Hymn
(Rebel Song Book, p.8; Songs of the People,22)

We meet-day in free-dom's cause And raise our voi-ces high; We'll join our hands in

un-ion strong to bat-tle or to die. CHORUS: Hold the fort, for we are com-ing,

Union-men be strong! Side by side we bat-tle on-ward, Vic-to-ry will come.

2.
Look, my comrades, see the union
Banners waving high;
Reenforcements now appearing;
Victory is nigh.
(CHORUS)

3.
See our numbers still increasing,
Hear the bugles blow.
By our union we shall triumph
Over every foe.
(CHORUS)

ON THE PICKET LINE
(Tune: "Polly Wolly Doodle")

1.
To win our strike and our demands
Come and picket on the picket line.
In one strong union we'll join hands;
Come and picket on the picket line.

REFRAIN
On the line, on the line,
Come and picket on the picket line.
We will shout and yell and fight
as well,
Come and picket on the picket line.

2.
If you've never spent a night in jail
Come and picket on the picket line;
You will be invited without fail,
come and picket on the picket line.
(REFRAIN)

3.
If you don't like scabs and thugs and
stools,
Come and picket on the picket line;
For you show your boss that the worker
rules,
When you picket on the picket line.
(REFRAIN)
