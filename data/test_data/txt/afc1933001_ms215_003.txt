at Clemson College, 
S. C., for white spirituals 
via Roscoe McLean 
in Florida we'll see 
Mrs. Chandler at Murrells 
Inlet, S. C., thence
in to Washington - I hope 
before June 15, though 
it begins to look 
doubtful. In case 
you wish to reach 
me, address letters c/o 
General Delivery at any 
of the places I have mentioned.
