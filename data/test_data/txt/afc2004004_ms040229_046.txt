Animals (Carmichael)

There was never a yellow
butterfly till Christ cam forth
from death & rose up from the tomb
Yellow butterfly came forth from
the tomb & spread throughout the
world.  He is always seen near
or above the corpses of unjust &
other good people & that is a 
good sign

The (big) [?] is called the watcher
of night, he who blesses them
morning, the wals[?] of Saints
the remembrance of Peter
