Dear Dr. Studebaker:

A short time ago, you will remember we had some correspondence 
about the Rumor Clinics which were being set up in your 
Civilian Morale Service. At that time, I indicated to you my 
approval of the part which the Office of Facts and Figures 
would play in this project.

Since then, it has come to my attention that the Rumor Clinics 
idea differs to a large extent from my original understanding 
of it.    I was not aware until now that these Clinics in the 
colleges would be making and publicizing their own analyses 
of some of the rumors they come upon.

This raises in my mind and in the minds of the members of the 
Board of the Office of Facts and Figures a grave question as 
to the advisability of proceeding with the Rumor Clinic project. 
There is great danger in the plan as now set up that 
public discussion without centralized control would tend to
spread rumors rather than kill them; and on the other hand, 
there is the possibility that some Clinics will try to kill 
as rumor something that is actual and official fact, thus 
serving to undermine the confidence of the public in informa-
tion sources of the Government.

I believe, therefore, that before this project goes any further, 
it should be discussed with Mr. McNutt, and it should perhaps 
be examined by the Committee on War Information.

Faithfully yours,

Archibald MacLeish
Director, Office of Facts and Figures
