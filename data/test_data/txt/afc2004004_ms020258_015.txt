Reel 7, Apr, 1960, St. Simons Island, Ga.

[*Chorus sounds weird-
a real "field" sound.
Recording good except
for last line of verse.*]

LET ME FLY

I has a sister in the promised land,
I never expect to stop until I shake her hand,
I'm not so particular about shaking her hand,
I just want to meet her in the promised land.

CHORUS:   Lord, let me fly,
Let me fly,
Oh, let me fly to Mount Zion,
Lord, Lord.

I has a mother in the promised land,
I never expect to stop until I shake her hand,
I'm not so particular about shaking her hand,
I just want to meet her in the promised land.  (CHORUS)

Just let me tell you what a liar do,
He won't serve God and he won't let you.  (CHORUS)

He'll talk about Sally, he'll talk about Jane,
Say, when you gonna tell him, "Don't you call my name"?
(CHORUS)

Just let me tell you what a liar do,
He won't serve God and he won't let you,
Just let me tell you what a drunkard do,
He won't do right, he won't let you.  (CHORUS)

Now, oh, my sister, you oughta just know
What a certain somebody told me about you,
He told me such a lie it would astonish your mind,
It takes a little truth just to make it shine.  (CHORUS)
