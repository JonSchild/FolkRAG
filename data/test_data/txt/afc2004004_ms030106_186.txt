I hate a man like you, 
Don't like the things you do.
When you married me, I knew you wasn't right,
When you stayed out from me the first night, 
Do you think that is treating your little wifie
right?
Lawd, I hate a man like you.

I hate a man like you,
Can't get used to the (way) things (that) you try(in) to do.
I knew you wasn't the one for me,
When you took your fist and knocked me down to [on] my
knee, 
If I could get a divorce I know I would be free,
From a dog-gone man like you.

Yes, I hate a man like you,
Can't gettin' used to the things that you do, No.
When you took your man [front] from out of my home
He told me all about the places that you did roam, 
I looked in your pocket and found a sweet woman's
comb,
Yes, I hate a man like you.
(Um, Um, Um, etc.)

I hate a man like you,
Don't like the things you do,
My people told me that I was goin' wrong, 
And I had a yen for you, I thought I'd like you
strong,
But you so dumb you don't know right from wrong,
Lawd, I hate a man [mad] man like you.

Then I hit the blues and then on she just moaned. It
was a shame, [a] the way that man treated that woman, and this 
happened to be a even true song. The music was wrote on account 
of this happening. Of course, I played some blues to kind of
pacify the young lady. She was a beautiful thing, too. I
played some rolling stuff, like this -- (piano).
