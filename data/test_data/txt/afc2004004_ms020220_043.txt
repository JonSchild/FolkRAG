BJ TAPE 7A, p. 39

BJ: Well I was -- I done outgrown it; I was leavin' the country,
hum, hum!
TL: For Heaven's sake.
BJ: Hah, hah, tha's right. I got to really pick it, ya know.
Sure, I could git up as high as 400.
TL: What's the difference between picking it the way you picked
it in the beginning and the way you picked it in the end? How
did you become better?
BJ:  Same way...Oh, I jus' become  better by jes' -- Well, I'll
tell 'ya, jis', jis' make up your mind ya gonna do it, tha's all.
An' go ahead on an' do it. Just git a vim 'till you got -- You gotta
have your mind to it. I never did like it when I was lil' - Tha's
the thing of it, ya know?
TL: Why didn't you like it?
BJ: Oh, I didn't like it. Jus' ah...Oh, a big ol' fiel' with
a (white color? wide cut?) I couldn't see where I could pick
at all. Hah, jus' that! I jus' wasn't a farmer, that's all.
That's all to it. I jus' wasn't a farmer. An' I jus' didn'
like it.
So, long years after I got up a large girl, then ah, I
followed other peoples, tryin' not to let them beat me pickin'.
An' that's the way...
TL: Oh!
BJ: ...an' that's the way you can learn to pick. Tha's all.
Don't let them know you racin' at 'em. Jus' race at em for
yourself, an' you anything -- First time I picked a hundred,
picked a hundred and two. And I was so glad, my! I, I was so
glad. [An' ah,] I, I, I was around 12, 14 years old then.
