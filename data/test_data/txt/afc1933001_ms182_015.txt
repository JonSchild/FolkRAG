Mr. Al[l]an Lomax
Assistant in Charge,
Archives of American Folk Song,
Library of Congress,
Washington,  D.C.,

Sir:

I have your letter of May 7th, regarding the
letters sent by you to Cleveland Benoit, Darby Hicks,
Joe Washington Brown, and Austin Coleman.

The Mail Clerks advise em that they did not
see any mail received here for Darby Hicks or Austin
Coleman,    And I understand that Darby Hicks is now
in Liberty Texas;   although we have no such forwarding
order.    Austin Coleman does not seem to be known here.
I understand that Joe Washington Brown is living in
Lake Arthur, Louisiana,   but we do not have any such
forwarding order.

Cleveland Benoit letter was delivered to him;
and subsequent to your letter I sent for him;    and asked him
to prepare and mail the letter to you. This he promises to
do on Saturday last.

I am respectfully

Leo J. Nohe
Leo J. Nohe Postmaster
