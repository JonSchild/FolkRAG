Dear Mr. Lomax:
     TOPIC, the US Information Agency's magazine for
Africa, is planning to produce a story about the Gullah
people, particularly emphasizing the folkways they
have carried over from Africa.  I am trying to find
photographs to illustrate it.
     Although there is a wealth of material about Gullah
songs, words and stories, photographs seem to be scarce.
At this point, we don't know exactly what vestiges of
the African heritage might be visual, although baskets,
nets and dances have been suggested.  Would you be
so kind as to lend us your film on the Georgia Sea
Islands?  I'd like to see it in the hope that it might
give me ideas for still photographs.
     We'd also appreciate a chance to see Miss Halifax's
pictures--preferably in contact form.  I am following
up several leads to still photographers--Robert Yellin,
Moses Asche and Peter Siegal--and I'd be glad to know
about any other existing photographs of the Gullah
people.
Sincerely,
(Miss) Ellen Kemper
Picture Editor
