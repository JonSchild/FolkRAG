Dear Alan:

1. Please forward the Swigmaster 
letter to the correct address 
using the enclosed stamp. 
2. If in any any way possible, 
I wish you would see what is 
holding up my expenses record
and report to me. 
3. Yesterday I received from 
you the "Funds of Music Album" 
Thank you. The work seems dignified
and adequate. Perhaps I should 
say scholarly. Will Mr. Spivacke
expect my personal acknowledgment
to him?
+  I'd like my much

over
