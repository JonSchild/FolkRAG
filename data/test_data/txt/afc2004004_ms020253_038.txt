an' fly off -- you know, some folks will get that much devil in 
'em, they won't -- "It's my business, I'l do what I please!" An'
all that kinda stuff; you know, like that, you know? "Ain't none of 
'em'll rule me," an' all kinda stuff. Well, you that way, you 
kinda in bad shape, see?
     Well, that person supposed to back an' get another person an'
to come to you an' talk wich ya. An' they, an' then, you don't 
hear them bof, an' they get another one. Three people supposed
to come to you together. Witness. That's Bible. An' talk to you.
An' then, if you don't hear them, then you are put up before the
boa'd, an' you don't hear the boa'd, you goin' out.
TL: Well, the council and the board are all the people. . .?
BJ: Tha's it; all the same.
TL: They're the people that were seeking and they found, huh? 
BJ: No, no. It just the members of the church. . .They don' matter. . .
You know what I mean, (they have seeketh ?)
TL:                      found or not, huh? 
BJ: Well, I'm talkin' about. . .No, well you don't worry about it.
In our church it's a-different. See, if you ain't found, why
you're not in, you're a, a, you're already lost. You see what I 
mean? But I meant, uh, I'm talkin' about this, all churches
have council that way. In our church, we wouldn't have a council
with a person that jus' shook their hand an' said, said they
want to be a -- they is gonna get saved. We don't have no council
with them; we jus; if they doin' wrong, they expect 'em to do 
wrong 'cause they ain't got no power, nothin' to keep 'em, ya see?
[All this] Holiness is a whole lot diffrunt from other folks where ya jus'
shake your hand an', an' say, "I want be a member of the church."
