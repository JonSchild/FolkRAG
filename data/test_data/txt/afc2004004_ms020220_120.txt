TL:    What do you do when you deliver a child?  What kind of
process do you go through when you get in the house?  What are
the things that you do, like if you went to deliver someone's
child right now, what would you do the minute you came in the house?
BJ:      Oh, I has to zamin (examine) 'em.
TL:     What?
BJ:      Examine her.  Um-hum.  An' then, 'cordin' to how the bed is,
get the bed ready.  Ya see?
TL:      What do you do to get the bed ready?
BJ:      Well, ah, puts paper -- I does -- put paper, either oilcloth,
you know, sumpin' to keep the sheets an' the things from gittin'
soiled.  [Jus'...] Ya see,  An' then let it, let it come down an' tilt, like
that corner there?  On the floor an' have a bucket or pan or

See, used to jus' mess up the whole beds an' things, ya see?  Quite
natchully, sometimes ya git an attack, ya can't he'p it, but if
you got a chance, you fix it.  See?  Yeah, fix the bed with papers,
or if ya ain't got no oilcloth, why put a paper.   But you got
time, from 9 months time, to git ya piece of oilcloth.  Ya see?
An' sumpin' like this here, an' put it under that, then put the
paper on it, ya see.  An' then let it have a place to go to the
side an' you be the, the edge, edge of the bed as near as you
can.  Because sometimes you can't get to the edge of the bed to
fix it.
     Then, you git your warm water.  Co'se I does.  Everybody
don't do it, but I know to do it, ya know?  [They] To help out.

look like it's kinda ah, havin' a hard way to come through, take
