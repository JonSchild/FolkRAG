From Africa, too, came a rich vein of animal hero tales which flowered in
America under the Br'er Rabbit stories (14), the Boll Weevil (15) and the
Gray Goose (16).  In all this material, it is evident that the animal heroes
represent the Negro slave.  In the case of the Br'er Rabbit who always tripped
Lean-faced the Fox (the white master), the motif is that of survival in spite
of everything.
The story of the Gray Goose is the yarn of a monster bird who was plucked,
boiled, carved, thrown in a hog pen, run through a saw mill and, still, the
last time they see him he was flying across the ocean with a long string of
goslings!
Later when the Negro came into conflict with the hard business of competition
in an industrial society, his heroes shed their animal disguise and emerged as
real men, desperate men in most cases, men who had decided it was better to die
in a gun fight than to live shamefully.  Such city folk are Stagolee (17),
Railroad Bill (18), Brady (19) and Dupree (20).
John Henry (21), however, with his nine-pound silver hammer, is the tall tale
par excellence of all American folklore.  His is the story of the worker dispossessed
by the Industrial Revolution.  John Henry was driving steel, it is
said, on the Big Bend tunnel of the C. and O. Railroad in West Virginia some 
time in the 1870s, when the first automatic steam drill was brought into the
mountains.  John Henry was the best steel driver in the tunnel and so, in order
to discover whether man or machine was most efficient, John Henry was pitted
against the machine.  He beat the steam drill down but he broke his poor heart
and died in the end just as craftsmen and hand workers all over the world were
breaking their hearts in the hopeless attempt to beat the machine. Although
John Henry died in the smoky bowels of the West Virginia hills in 1870, he 
still stands for all Negro workers in the South as a symbol of their courage.
The flair for the big dimension which motivated the pens of Mark Twain and Tom
Wolfe and Herman Melville as well as the teller of Arkansas bear stories and Paul
Bunyan lumber woods yarns is native to the American way of thinking and doing
things.  It has produced the Empire State Building, the Flying Fortress, war-time
appropriations of hundreds of billions of dollars and it will some day exaggerate
itself right smack into a new kind of society.
