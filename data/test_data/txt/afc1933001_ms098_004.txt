Dear Dr. Botkin: In my Adventures I
plan to include a brief History of the
Fox Song Archive. Please send me
the latest report showing particularly
the present activities of the Archive
and statistics brought up to date.
[If] I'll not quote you. So please
do not wait to get everything
checked and double-checked.
Time is just now my chief
concern, not the leisurelyness
of Uncle Sam.
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax.
