IN REPLY REFER TO

July 14, 1938.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I had to stay in New York this week but will
probably be down next week. I gather you are planning
to leave shortly and wonder whether it will be possible
to get your North Mexican records supposing you are away?
If possible, I wish you'd leave word with Dr. Spivak as
to how these records are to be got at and how played (I
mean being your own recordings will they come through on
an ordinary phonograph?. Are they marked in any way so
that the uninitiate (everyone except yourself) can tell
what he's playing?

If you come through New York, I wish you'd give me a ring
at Murryhill 6-4676 (the exchange is no longer the one
I gave you) in case I don't get to Washington before you
leave.

Sincerely,
Elizabeth Meyer
