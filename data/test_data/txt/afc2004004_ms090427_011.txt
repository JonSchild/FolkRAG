The Folk Culture Study in Coahoma County, Mississippi -- 10

A.M.E. Churches in this area were Dr. Stinger and Reverend Dixon.  Dr.
Stinger also organized Masonic lodges.  Reverend Moses Dixon founded
the Order of Tabor, which flourished.  Other lodges came -- the
Pythians, the Odd Fellows, and the Woodmen of Union.  "Race" consciousness
expressed itself in the development of Negro businesses, in the
"colored sections" in the towns.  World War prices of cotton caused
the area to boom.
Class differences among Negroes appeared pronounced in this
era.  On the river Negro owners were men who had been smart enough to
advance from the status of tenants.  They were friendly and associated
with their friends who remained tenants.  In the new railroad town a
Negro leadership developed to exploit economically the race consciousness
and mutual helpfulness notion of the earlier period.  The commercial
economy presented a Negro middle class to supplant the earlier
"race leadership."  The division between the wicked and the respectable
became more formal in the towns.  The red light district was a formally
organized pleasure area in the town.
The railroad era witnessed a more formal and less spontaneous
expression of attitudes and feelings.  Men were singing their
thoughts and fancies on the levee, on the railroad, and in the field,
but these expressions were confined to the spot of their making.  The
social song was no longer the traditional ring play and dance.  These
songs were divided into the respectable and the wicked.  The respectable
were the popular written music, while in the brothels in the red light
district the blues were taking form and identification.  The spirituals 
were sung less and less, while the "Dr. Watt" song, with its standardized
form became increasingly popular.  The "gospel" songs were begining
to appear in the churches.
