Dear Alan:

Your prompt reply of September 15 to my letter was awaiting me upon 
my return from the West.

I have not received any letter from your father since some time before
his visit in Camden on his way to Canada. Very shortly, I am going
to send him a contract covering an album containing five records of 
folk recordings selected from our available recordings. In this
contract, we shall offer him one-cent a side for his work in connection
with selecting the recordings to be used and preparing the
booklet to go with the album.

The Company wished to try out one album and if the does well enough,
they will be very glad to extend the contract with your father, to cover
one or more additional albums.

If your father is agreeable to the contract as outlined, I will then 
arrange to send to you what we have of the additional recordings
you have requested for the Archives.

At some later time, I shall try to get the matter settled in connection 
with the possibility of your doing some folk song recordings for
 us. Apparently, there is no need for hurry here as you say you will 
be extremely busy for at least six weeks. 

With best wishes.

Sincerely yours,
R. P. Wetherald
