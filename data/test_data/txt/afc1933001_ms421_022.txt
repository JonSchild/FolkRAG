COOPERATIVE YOUTH SONGS

HOME ON THE RANGE

1. Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam,
Where the deer and the antelope play,
Where seldom is hears a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

Chorus: Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play;
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

2. Where the air is so pure, the zephyrs so free,
And the breezes so balmy and light;
I would not exchange my home on the range
For all of your cities so bright.

3. The Red Man was pressed from this part of the West;
'Tis unlikely he'll ever return
To the banks of Red River where seldom if ever
Their flickering campfires burn.

4. Oh, I love the wild flowers in this dear land of ours,
The curlew I love to hear scream,
I love the white rocks and the antelope flocks
That graze on the mountain tops green.

5. Oh, give me a land where the bright diamond sand
Goes liesurely down the clear stream;
And the graceful white swan goes gliding along
Like a main in a heavenly dream.

6. How often at night the heavens are bright
With the light of the glittering stars,
Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed
If their glory exceeds that of ours.

7. Then I would not exchange my home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play,
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day.
