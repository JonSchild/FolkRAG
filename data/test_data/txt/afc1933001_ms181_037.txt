Ricardo Archuleta
Cerro, New Mexico

Dear Mr. Archuleta:

Some time ago you were kind enough to record for Mr. Juan
B. Rael some ancient Spanish folk songs. Among them a song
entitled "Atencion Senado Ilustre"which occupies less than
1/5 of one side of a 12" record. Also two other songs
entitled "El Major Hombre Del Mondo" which occupies one side
of a 12" record, and "O Dulcisiomo Jesus"El Telcolotito"
which occupies 1/3 of a 12" record. For the privilege of
using these three songs we are able to pay you $20.00 and
send you two copies of each record for your own use.

The Library of Congress is preparing to send some selctions
from its Archive to various countries in Latin America and
it is for this purpose that we wish to use your songs.

I hope you will give us your permission to use these songs
by signing and returning the enclosed form as soon as possible.
All the records will carry the legend, "For non-commercial use
only" and of course you name will appear on every record.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
