To the Director of _______Hall:

    Corn huskin' time has again come around and that means an
excuse to have a party and that's just what we're havin' on
October 28th from 7:00 to 9:30 P.M._____a Corn Husker's Bee.
At this party we want to have a singin' contest and we want
your dormitory to be represented and confidentally we hope
that ______Hall wins the prize.

    There are just a few rules that we think we'd better
stick to.

    1. We reckin that more 'on twenty a singin' at
    once would be too many.
    2. And we reckin as how since that week is sorta
    folk lore-emphasis week that the selection
    should be a sur nuf Texas folk song.
    3. And we reckon no group orta sing longer'an
    3 minutes.

    The judges will decide the best rendition by just what-
ever appeals to them, I guess. It seems that's th' way most
judgin's done. But they'll be supposed to recognize a real
Texas folk song when they hear it, and they'll be supposed
to consider costumin and all of that.    

    Anyway have everyone of your group present on the Con-
cret Slab at the south end of court # 3 promptly at 7 P.M.,
cause the preliminary singin' starts then and the finals
will be at 9P.M. Just sign the blank below and return it
immediately to Mary Hess or Mary K. Boone so that we'll know
you mean to s-i-n-g.

__________ Hall will enter the Corn Husker's Bee
singing Contest.
