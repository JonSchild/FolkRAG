John A. Lomax, page 2                         Feb. 5, 1935


     Your friend John Martin called on me this morning and tells me that
I may expect to see you soon. We can discuss the problems of arrangement,
classification, cataloguing, and transcribing when you arrive.

     In the meantime, greetings, both t you and to Alan, who will, I hope,
have fully recovered by this time!

                                                              Faithfully yours,

                                                                Chief, Division of Music
