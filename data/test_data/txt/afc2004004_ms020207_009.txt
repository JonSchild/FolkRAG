remember any?
R: I remember one of the [lyrics] late songs that I composed - "The Sinners Come and

them a small salary,  you know.
A: Like, what would it be?
R: Oh, we pay them by the month, four, five dollars a month, you know.

A: That means she has to be pretty good.
R: O yeah.
A: And what's the normal salary for a minister? 
R: Well, it depends upon the church. My salary, here, [oh] is, oh,  just my 
salary is fifty dollars a week, but I have a pastor's aid.
A: What's that?
R: A pastor's aid -- whatever they raise is for the pastor.
