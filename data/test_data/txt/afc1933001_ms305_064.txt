damage their own prestige.

Now Europe is no longer in a
position to interest itself in the
musical market of the Americas
and the managers are distressed.
In their distress they have blundered.
Releases from the great
radio chains—which are the
managers of the musical talent
controlling conductors, soloists,
composers, even educators — announce
programs of American
folk song. Interest in folk song
has been accumulating for many
years. The text books used to
teach music in our public schools
are filled, in fact, based on folk
song. To be sure it's European
folk song that fills their pages,

thanks to the prevailing propaganda.
For our children the
crude songs of this land are not
supposed to be sufficiently elevating.

Folk Songs to Front

Nevertheless it focused the attention
of millions on folk song
and when our great librariers and
our learned institutions, our foundations
of fabulous wealth, and
even the alien composer within
our gates, began to spend great
sums and much time collecting
the folk music of this land, the
managers sought to capitalize this
new interest. Now Allan Lomax,
serving the Columbia Broadcasting
Company and the Library of
Congress, offers weekly programs
of native folk music.

What do these programs prove
about the art?

That question can be answered
most satisfactorily by illustration.

Scattered through this page are

or Slavic songs as he may know—
for example, "Holy Night" (German),
"O sole mio" (Italian), the
theme from the finale of Tschaikowsky's
fourth symphony, "The
Habanera" from "Carmen," a tune
which Bizet borrowed from Spain.
If in melody, rhythm, structure,
variety and sentiment these tunes
are just as good, then how
does it happen that the races that
created them have not created
famous operas or symphonies? The
answer is that men of these races,
and women, too, have written
songs, symphonies, operas, and
chamber works that are great music,
but the world has not heard
them, because our alien conductors
pretend that they don't know where to find them,

Hostility Is Shown

They will be told in the course of
this article, and so plainly that
no doubt as to their hostility
toward the music of England and
the Americas will remain. Meanwhile
one asks: If the folk song of
all races is relatively equal in
artistic value how does it happen
that Germany, Italy and Russia are
the musically dominant nations
and Britain and the Americas their
vassals?

To answer that question one
cites an entertaining and quite
accurate thesis to the effect that
national achievement in the art
of music stands in inverse ratio
to sea power. This has ample basis
in fact. The nations that have produced
operas have built few ships.
The nations that have planted
colonies all over the world have
few symphonies to their credit.
Consider the Dutch. They built an
empire while Bach was laying the
foundations of German music. The
Dutch folk songs are more varied,
less mechanical, more imaginative
than the German, sturdier than
the Italian. That implies greater
native talent for the Dutch.

to the music  Wagner, which
many feel has ong since lost its
power to sway   e emotions of the
listener pleasa tly. During the
past century it has been publicized
as has no other music. It became
a cult. Outside of Germany it is
bow less beloved, largely beacuse
of its redundant and overstressed
emotionalism. This is both bombastic
and erotic. No idiom has
worn so thin. No music is more
restricted in its emotional implications.

Observing the reactions of an
audience in Berlin, Bayreuth, of
Meunchen, as these self-confident
people share the repetitious
ecstasies of Tristan and Isolde or
weep for joy at Hans Sachs' long
hymn to the superiority of German
virtue and courage, one
cannot doubt the influence of
Wagner on the German people,
and vice versa. Wagner, as poet
and composer, set out to persuade
the Germans that they are a race
of supermen, a conviction which
now, as in the past, has proved
inconvenient for the rest of the
world. It is no exaggeration to
say that the spirit which has set
the German people on the bloody
path of conquest so often during
the past century is also the spirit
of Wagner from "Tannhauser"
and "Lohengrin" to "Die Meistersinger,"
with the obvious exception
of "Tristan" and "Parsifal."

Of course, Wagner's music is
consistently militant, which would
not be a fault were it not also
monotonous. The public is the
victim but the conductors continue
to play it to the exclusion
of music that is expressive of our
outlook and of our spirit, that
would be new and might well be
refreshing. For this reason, I,

choose, does his local duty first
and then goes farther afield, often
with good results.

Radio believes its duty done
when it chooses one or two native
symphonic works in the smaller
forms. No one wants to do a full-length
native symphony. For some
reason the larger forms are
frowned upon by our imported
conductors, so don't assume that
they are doing their duty. Far
from it.

These being grave times, I take
this occasion to recommend some
gay native works for symphony orchestra
which I know and which
I ams sure the public would like
to know. Some of them have been
played. But it seems a cardinal
principle with our imported conductors
to avoid all repetitions of
native music. Play it once, as a
sop to the patriots and then turn
back to Wagner.

Recommends Deems Taylor

If we are looking for cheer in
these gloomy times why not play
again the two suites by Deems
Taylor, "Through the Looking
Glass" and Circus Day." He's a

UNUSUAL RHYTHM

New Yorker and his opera "Peter
Ibbetson" once opened a Metropolitan
season and held its place in
the repertoire longer than most
new operas. How often have you
heard the Taylor suites? They
are better than Tschaikowsky's
"Nut Cracker," which is not saying
enough. Of course it costs no
royalties to play Wagner, and Taylor
insists on performance fees. So
do most of the natives, which is
one of the factors against them.

"Perambulator" suite should be
heard here again. And, of course,
there's Roy Harris, whose admirers
are fanatical and whose opponents
are bitter. He needs no
aid from me and I don't admire
him.

Library Ready to Aid

When the alien conductor happens
to bethink himself of the
native composer he usually writes
the music division of the Library
of Congress. Thus is revealed
what Dr. Harold Spivacke, director
of that division, in an unguarded
moment called "a shameful situation."
For there is one printed
guide to contemporary American
music by Claire Reis who is an
authority, and there is a vast compilation
by the WPA which lists
the names of 1,500 native composers
and the 5,000 compositions
that have been played by the relief
orchestras.

Then, at the New York Public
Library, Dr. Carleton Sprague
Smith, a greatly respected musicologist,
has a list of 300 North
American masterpieces and 50
from South America." Mrs. Reis'
guide is on sale. The national
office of WPA can provide its
guide. Dr. Smith is eager to help.

Why don't the alien conductors
and chamber groups communicate
with them?
