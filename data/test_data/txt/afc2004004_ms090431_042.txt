whiskey, you catch a man what don't never drink no whiskey, and 
be out in exposure,, well, why, he always be out hurtin or achin., 
or he can't halfway pick up or somethin allthe time. But if he 
drank him a little whiskey along, that help him. That [help] gives 
him pep to keep his nerve, you see. A man always, when they used 
to, you know, sell whiskey, Iwould k[k]eep me a pint of whi skey all 
the time for the rock (canteen?). And I never would have much as 
much as a bad cold. Didn't care how it went out, and it rained

and stuff right on.

B: Wel, you can set in the house and overdo that, you know. You have

S: I tell you what best, [. The old way] You take a man nowadays, if he want to 
awake to three, he's too [hungry] hot. Then he don't know he's too
