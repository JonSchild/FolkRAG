1. A slip of the lip might sink a ship.

2. Taken from a song I heard from my fellow assosociates
"Why Don't You Do Right"
We were granted some freedom, in the Bill of Rights, 
But you poor white people, just won't do right
Why don't you do right, like the other people do
Let us out of here, and, Grant us freemod to.....

3. What are we to fight for. This isnt our
country. We just live here. It belong to the
white man. Maybe. . .If the japs do win
the war, we negroes will be better off. (I
personally dont believe in this. I have heard the statement 
made many, many times.]

4. A Collored Lt. upon asking a Bus Driver
from the South where he could find a collored 
hotel. was hit. the Bus Driver claim that he
was insulted. A couple of Privates saw the Bus
Driver hit the Lt. when he called them to
Attention they lied saying they didn't see it all
happen. The Lt. didnt hit the Driver because
he was afraid of being busted. There was 
a great deal of predijuce on the Driver part.
Especially against one of our our men who are helping
to make this world a better place to live.

5. Buy war bonds, lick a stamp and beat a Jap.
