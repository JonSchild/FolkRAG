Re: Mr. John Davis -3-

He was seen for the last time on June 24, 1963 at which time he appeared entirely
well. The ENT and heart and lung examinations were unchanged.

Final impression: 1) Healed, acute respiratory infection.
2) Pre-existing stable asymptomatic heart disease with
cardiomegaly and aortic insufficiency.

Comment: Since this patient probably had a pre-existing lesion of the heart,
and since he is suffering from no symptoms with it at this time, and since the
patient has no knowledge of this, I felt it unwise to discuss the problem with
him. It was my impression that if Mr. Davis were informed that he had heart
disease with these particular findings as mentioned above, it would cause an
acute depression and disable him much more that the actual heart involvement
disabled him. It is my philosophy apart from the actual findings in the case
that a patient like Mr. Davis should be restricted and limited only to the extent
that he developes symptoms which are in themselves restricting and limiting.
Since he is perfectly able to continue with his work and enjoys it without
any untoward affects, it is my feeling that he should be allowed to so continue,
realizing that he is ageing and that in the future his cardiac condition may
become more intense than it is at the present time. I therefore returned him to
full activity which he has been able to undertake without any compromise of his
effort tolerance either for work or recreation.
