Why the house-wife yell about food
she can't get; when every one should
know the Army and Navy is geting
all the best foods
The man in the grocery stores
takes what is left and sometimes
he can't get that. Many house-wifes
don't know this and when they come
into a store and ask for articles
and the grocery replied that he
doesn't have what they want.
Some become angry and blame the 
grocery for the things she can't not 
get.
There precis are high and the
house-wife also blame the grocery.
The Government had to raise food
prices because pepple hoard. In
order that every one may be able
to buy food and eat.
