[who  whom  whom  the them them move whem]

Otherwise we shall be indulging in a very obvious form of
conspicuous consumption of time.  There are many motives
for folk lore collection.  I know one
folks lorist who has worked for fifteen
years to prove that one of his colleagues
was a damn fool and a damn charlatan.
I know another the object of whose work
was to show that Haitian culture was Parisian
rather than African - Creole.  Many of our
earlier collectors went to the people to
revel in the echoes of a past they felt was
more acceptable and more romantic than
the present.  There are others who have the
collecting bug -- who would do as well
as stamp collectors or first edition
