A college professor repeats the rumor that at a meeting
recently of army officers and educators, the military attaches
told the educators that they should look ahead ten years and not
just one year because the war would last for at least ten years
and that next year the only boys who will be in the colleges will
be those who are unfit for military service or those who are
following the Army-Navy educational plans.   [*Denver, Colo 8-7 24*]
