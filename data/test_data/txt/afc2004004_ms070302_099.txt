publicly suffering in a chair to come and
see something What. Nothing. I got up. A
demon he said, was walking round + round
the house- a tall black man without
a head and without feet who walked and
cried "Cree-Cree-" like a bird. Every
little while there was a burst of voices behind
the house- "demons". A blue car with blue 
lights had stopped before the house and started
away again, no driver was to be seen.
Chavela thinks all this was to get attention
the attention that he hadn't been getting from
me lately. One says a [thing] fiction - a child or a 
childlike person - that is lonely + wants attention -
and immediately thereafter begins
to believe it, begins to weep over the sadness
and terror of this fiction. I don't know
but I waited on the porch for thirty minutes
and during that time no demons appeared.
This morning I asked him if any demons
had appeared. Yes a lot more, all night
long he couldn't sleep with them.
This morning he left for PaP without cleaning
up the house at all, leaving all the food
