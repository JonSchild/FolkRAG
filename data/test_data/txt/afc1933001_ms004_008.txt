May 29, 1933.

Prof. John A. Lomax
University of Texas Station
Austin, Texas

My dear Mr. Lomax:

My note of May 27 was not in reply to yours of May 24, which I received
only this morning. The letter of May 19, from Mr. Garwick - of which you sent
me a copy - confirms what I understood him to say when I last saw him in New
York.

As I wrote to you, I expect to have a talk with him in about a week. I have
yet to learn how long it will take him to complete the machine for the Library.

If you have settled on a definite date for the beginning of your tour,
your letter does not reveal it. Other important information is where to ship
the machine when it is ready, whether to Austin or to some place near the spot
where you propose to begin your recording. It would seem wiser, however, to
send the machine to you where you can test it before you go on the road, and
have any possible fault corrected before you are in the field.

Do I understand you to say that you would be motoring all the way to Washington
and deliver the machine to us on your arrival?

What about records? Will you provide them? Shall we provide them? What
kind do you propose to use? Aluminum or celluloid?

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music
