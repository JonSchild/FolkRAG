Key  1  (My honey babe,
                (Why don't you come home.

The Rougish Man 

1) I went down to Baptis
West come a-runnin' back 
I'm gonna tell you Bill Armstrong 
Done put the ball to Jack                              
                         -
2) Old Jack walked in the house, boys, 
With his pistol in his hand 
He's cussin Bill Armstrong
Like he warn't any man                                 
                   -
3) Bill Armstrong shot Jack in the head
Shot once on the floor
"Tell you now, Jack 
You aren't bullin' me no mo'.                       
                          -                                                                    
4) Sent for Dr. Parnell
 He didn't even try - 
Said "It wa'n't no use to work on Jack 
For he will sholy die."                                       

5) Brought Jack at to his sister's 
Told all his friends - 
"He's been bullin' round Ballantine's 
Better not bully again. 

6) Sent for Dr. [Blair] Daniel
Dr. Blair Come mighty quick -
"I'm gon tell you Jack's
In a mighty bad fix"

7) Dr. Daniel worked on Jack,
As much as we could tell -
Help of Dr. Daniel,
Jack, he got well.

8) Old Jack got well that time
An Jackie warn't sore
Next trouble Jack got in
Broke in Mr. Lawrence store

9) They laid old Jack in jail that time,
He was layin on his bunk
Studyin bout that money
In Mr. Castle's trunk.

10) --------------        house
Mr. Castle hadn't come back
Jack pushed his hand in Mr. Castle's
trunk
Got his money sack.
