A Program of American Music

American music today is made up of three distinct
living idioms--a folk, a popular, and an art music.

The traditions of all these three derive from Europe:
The bulk of our folk music from the British Isles, that
of our art music from the great composers of the continent.
As in the case of the American language, the folk music
has undergone sea change in its migrations across the 
Atlantic.

In addition, certain other national and racial minorities
have created new hybrids, the French in the Southeast, 
the Spanish in the Southwest, the Germans and the
Scandinavians in the North. Above all, the Negro has made
the most distinctive contribution.

The people sang as they built a country, recalling the
old and celebrating the new. The voices of miners, farmers,
lumberjacks, workers of all kinds, their wives and children,
swelled into the tide of music rich and strange but vital
and undeniably American.

Our popular music, the music of the cities, draws from 
the sources of both of the other and older idioms. Today,
like the motion picture, it is an export commodity to all
ports of the world.

The selections on this program are drawn from these
three musical currents and sung by persons and groups--
professional and amateur--who know and sing them best.
