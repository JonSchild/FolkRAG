ROCKING THE CRADLE
As I roved out on a fine summer morning
Down by a clear river I walked all alone
I heard a man making a most sad lamentation,
And thus he began to make his sad moan.
Chorus: - Crying ochone that I ever was married,
Leaves me in sorrow alas to bemoan,
Weeping, wealing, and rocking the cradle,
Pleasing the child that is none of my own.

I listened awhile to his sad lamentation,
Perhaps that his story it might be own,
So fondly he hugged and dandled the baby,
And thus he began to make a sad moan.

When first I met with your inconstant mother,
I thought myself happy and blessed with a wife,
But to my relexation, sure I soon was mistaken,
She was a torture and pleague to my life.

My wife comes in, in the heel of the evening,
She says to her consert the kettle put down,
For she sits to her table and to the tea drinking,
Saying you old cuckold rock the cradle round.

Every evening 'tis true she walks with her bullies,
And leaves me the cradle to rock all alone,
This innocent baby it calls me its dady,
But little it knows its none of my own.

If I was single once more to my glory
No element of pleasure would e'er me invoke,
I'd rather be a slave in wild Guinea.
Than to any drunkard or deceit be a cloak.

So now to conclude and to finish my story,
All men that are single ne'er take a wife,
For if you do they will surely torment you,
Likewise be a torture all the days of your life.

Crying ochone that I ever was married
Leaves me in sorrow alas to bemoan,
Hush-a-by baby be still and be easy,
I fear that your father will never be known.
