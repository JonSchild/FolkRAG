BJ TAPE 28, p. 12

Did he keep the cutest noises ya ever heard in your life! Den
it seemed like there two mens talkin', mumblin'.
Why, I got out that bed an' ah... I just knew Mama an' them
knewed I was there. I got out of bed an' I got my bible. 
An' I just stooed there to that door. An' I jus' read an' I read,
to myself. And looked like to me that thing got that bugger on
fire, whatever it was in there. Great goo'ness, they went on 
turrible in there!, in that room. Looked like they two mens was 
yabber-yabber. "Yah, yah, hah!" One talkin' to one another or 
sumpin' or other. Sound like the one, one was heavier than the 
other'n.
I said, "That must be some wild animals that got in the
room." So I quit, I quit reedin' an' wen' on an' sat
down, by the stove. An' got me some sulphur, an' I boint (burned)
the sulphur. So I -- I thought about the sulphur after I had
sat down. I forgot that I had sulphur in there. I burnt some
sulphur an' I had some powder. I cut the shells? An' let the 
gunpower blow, you know, all through that, smoke all through
the place, you know. They cain't -- They say they cain't stand
that. 
An' so, anyway, that -- noise carried on in that house an' 
in that room an' up on that house an' in that room
'till daylight. But I went there in, an' the devilish thing, the
windows an' things was nailed up there just like I had 'em an'
the do's shut... everything. But they... but he stayed in there.
TL: Did you leave?
BJ: Huh?
TL: Did you keep on staying there?
