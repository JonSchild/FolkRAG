And when we had safely reached Greenland,
And the good luck ship took more,
And so soon we shall wish ourselves back again
All along with the girls on the shore, brave boys,
All along with the girls on the shore.

For Greenland is a barren place,
It's a place that you seldom see,
For there's ice an' snow where the whalefish blow
And daylight's seldom see, brave boys,
And daylight's seldom see.

So our boatswain up aloft he did go,
With his spyin' glass in his hand,
"Here's a whale, here's a whale, here's a whale, brave boys,
And he blows ond every swell, brave boys,
And he blows ond every swell.

So the boat bein' launched and the hands go in,
And the whalefish laid in view;
But none would resolve of the whole ship's crew
To steer where the whalefish blow, brave boys,
To steer where the whalefish blow.

So the whale bein' struck an' the line paid out,
An' - he gone -
