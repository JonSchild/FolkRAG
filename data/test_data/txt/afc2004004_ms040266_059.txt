Dear Mr Lomax,
Sorry to crop up again. I realise that
you're still pretty busy, & that my letter of last
month was of no import in any case. However, as a
Northumberland-born & Durham-bred person I was
keenly interested in your programme of last Friday,
& surprised at the amount of time given to the former
county when Durham was hardly illustrated (Blaydon,
of Races renown, though just in Durham, is surely
not typical of the county?).
I appreciate that on the surface Northumbrian
music must appear more interesting, due no doubt
to the county's proximity to the Scots influence.
Research into the music seemed to start early, & has
been thorough. (During my thesis preparation, I found a
[*3.*]
material, but perhaps I'm being too partisan. The
programme was still greatly enjoyed - the cries of
"Howway, me bonnie lads" soon had me back in
Newcastle! Your opinions, as an out-of-the-country
person, accentuate interest.

Yours sincerely,
Ken Bell
