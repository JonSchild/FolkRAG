AL:  He was just walkin' an' takin' his woman?

BJ:  Oh, yeah.  Jus', jus' bull-dozin' about it.  Then he's kinda -- I guess he musta been a man that don't like to fight an' fuss, I guess.  He had got him a gun.  That what he -- Had done already ordered it an' Few Clothes turned 'im loose, he went on down there an' the Post Office open an' he took it out... 'Cause some of the peoples said they seen him when he took out the package.

Then he came back home an' he washed up hisself an' waited 'till a fresh night, an' he had on -- I know he had on an overall suit, 'cause I seed it.  The jumper, ya see, ya could the, the blue shirts, ya know, in, in there, up, up in here.  An' he had on an overall jacket.  Had on overalls.  But they said, they said, the people said he really had on some clo'es when he left.  An' he left there.  An' so.  He sho' did.  An' he...

An' Few, ah, Few Clothes died on Tuesday night.  He lived 'till Tuesday night.  Us go out there that Mon'ay night to the hospital to Miami to see him.  He was tied up, up in the bed.  Squallin' like a hawg.  Goin' on like he was dyin' then.  We couldn't see his face at all.  he's up in a thing like a sheet.  Had 'im doubled up in the thing, ya know.  They had all kinda things, you know, wanted to, try to get that (blue blood ?) outa him an' all.  You know... But... he couldn't make it.  He..."  Augh... Augh.  Augh."  We didn't ever see his face... no mo'.
