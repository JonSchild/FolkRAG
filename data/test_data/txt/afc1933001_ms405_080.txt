[*Reminiscences*]

During vacations and week-ends of the years
from 1907 to 1910 I travelled through Texas and the West,
hunting for folk songs and recording the tunes on an Edison
phonograph. The machine weighed about 50 pounds. The records
were then made on small wax cylinders, instead of the aluminum 
discs generally used today. The cutting head was driven by a spring
which had to [must] be wound every two or three minutes. Financed
by a Travelling Fellowship from Harvard University, I was
able to travel from Texas to California and north as far
as Montana in my search for the best folk tunes.
In addition to the recording machine, I carried
also a large horn through which the singers sang their songs,
and also a head phone which they put over their ears to hear
their singing brought back to them. Without the headphones
the squeaky reproductions would today sound laughable; with
them a competent musician could make fairly good transcriptions.
At least, the equipment necessary for playing the
record over and over again in the quiet of [a] the transcriber's room, was more
reliable than to hear one time a singer's voice in the cowcamp or in the back
room of some western saloon. My horn was never popular, and
I lost many a song because the cowboys didn't like the looks
of it.
Before the time I made these records Charles F.
Lummis of California, using a similar equipment, was recording
