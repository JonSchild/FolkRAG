Irene, Goodnight

“Irene was a woman, which was named Irene. ‘Goodnight,’ is 
something you say when you think something is funny. An’ so I 
put Irene an’ goodnight’ together an’ had my song, ‘Irene, 
Goodnight.’”
Such was Lead Belly’s own explanation of the origin of his favorite 
song, volunteered on the lecture platform after he had heard
us repeatedly profess our ignorance on that head. Lead Belly , among [folk]
Negro folk-singers, [is] stands out as an intellectual, a singer
more than [un]usually interested in meaning,[and] pattern , and sequence .
[When one considers] What sort of meaning, then, do most Negro folk-
songs have for the people who sing them and spend their days
with them, when their poet can so absurdly explain a song? *
But Lead Belly [does have] can tell a [slightly] more plausible story: [to]
[tell. He learned,] his Uncle Terrill Ledbetter, who seems to have
been his source for a great many old-fashioned ballads and songs**
taught [it to him, when he lived in Terrill, Texas] him the
refrain with a couple of verses before Lead Belly was [sent to the] sentenced
[Texas Penitentiary.] for murder in Texas. He sang it throughout the penitentiary system
(where it is now one of the most popular, if not the most popular
song) adding verses as he thought of them, filling out the
details of the song until it [became a ballad.] had developed into a semi-ballad. When he went to
Angola, he took "Irene" [along with] and his twelve string guitar and [and it]
"Irene" was by far his most popular song with the [men] convicts, the guards and the vis-

** "Bo' Boy," Ballad of the Boll Weevil," "Frankie and Albert,"
"Bad Man Ballad," and so forth.
* Perhaps, though the explanation is no more absurd than the
refrain itself.
