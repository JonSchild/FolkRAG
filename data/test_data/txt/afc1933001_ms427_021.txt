MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME

(Page 238 - Old Favorite Songs)

The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home,
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay;
The corn-top's ripe and the meadow's are in bloom
While the birds make music all the day.
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,
All merry, all happy and bright,
By'n by hard times comes a-knocking at the door,
Then my old Kentucky home, good night!

Chorus: Weep no more my lady, Oh! weep no more today,
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home
For the old Kentucky home far away.

They hunt no more for the possum and the coon,
On the meadow, the hill and the shore.
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon
On the bench by the old cabin door.
The day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart,
The time has come when the darkies have to part,
Then my old Kentucky home, good night!

Chorus: Weep no more my lady, Oh! weep no more todya,
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home
For the old Kentucky home far away.


SWING LOW SWEET CHARIOT
(Negro)

(Page 48 - Twice 55 Songs - Brown
Book, C.C.Birchard - Boston)

Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home,
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

I looked over Jordan and what did I see?
Coming for to carry me home,
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.
