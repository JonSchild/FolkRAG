ANOTHER DAY THAT THE LORD HAVE KEPT ME

It's another day that the Lord have kept me,
It's another day that the Lord have kept me,
He have kept me from all evil,
And my mind on Jesus,
Lord, it's another day that the Lord have kept me.

Yes, another day I been my Saviour, etc.
Lord, it's another day that I've been praising my Saviour.
