I looked around and begin to thank Governor Pat Neff,
I wanted him to have a little mercy on me because I 
I had thirty five years. 

Please Governor Neff be good and kinds,
Have mercy on my great long time, 
Please Governor Neff be good and kind, 
Have mercy on my great long time. 

They turn loose some on pardon, some on parole. Some
they's cuttin' they time. 

I don' see to save my soul,
Don' git a pardon, try me on a parole.
I don' see to save my soul, 
Don' git a pardon, try me on a parole.

He ask [where] when did I want to go an' here what I tole him. 

Goin' Back to Mary
Oh, Mary, 
Lawdy Mary, Um-hum-----.

Some folks it's a sin, 
Got to many wimmen an' in the pen too many men. 
Some folks say it's a sin,
Got too many wimmen an' too many men. 
I want to talk to him 'bout my time. If he didn't pardon me, 
he might cut my time. 

Please Governor Neff be good an' kind, 
If I don' get a pardon, will you cut my time.?
Give me a pardon
Please Governor Neff be good an' kind, 
If I don' get a pardon will you cut my time?

Here's the las' words I said to him ---

If I had you Governor Neff like you got me,
I'd wake up in the mornin' an' I'd set you free. 

Had you Governor Neff like you got me, 
Wake up in the mornin' an' I'd set you free.
