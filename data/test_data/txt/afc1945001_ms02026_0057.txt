RUMORS

            "A hugh cache of explosives, left by German submarines, has 
been discovered on the shore of Hudson Bay."
            "Uncounted thousands of political favorites have been given 
commissions in the Army and Navy while your husband and son are struggling 
along as privates" - generally has an anti-Semitic twist.
            "Better not be too anti-Nazi because the Germans are going to 
control this country when the war ends." (This persists among the 
German-language groups in Chicago. It is an idea assiduously spread by 
such men as Walter Kappa, the former instructor in the German saboteurs' 
school near Berlin who is possibly in the United States according to an 
FBI warning. He and others of his ilk used to worm their way into the
councils of various German-language groups--turner class singing societies,
etc., and implant this doctrine among the natural leaders of the group who,  
in turn, controlled the thoughts of the others to a great extent.)
            "Several troop transports have been sunk, and the Army and Navy 
won't admit it." "This or that battleship or carrier has been sunk." 
(Sentence 2 is an especially tricky one to handle and, sometimes, of course, 
may well be true.)
            "If there's any meat rationing it's on account of those lend-lease 
shipments." (Officials of the National Association of Retail Meat Dealers 
have also broadly hinted this same thing.)
            "Warehouses are so full of rubber that the floors are breaking 
through, and yet we can't have any for our cars."
            "Hell, this is just a Jewish war." (We are advised that this was 
heard repeatedly at a recent party and it was later learned that one of the  
persons making the statement was a good friend of one of the twenty-six 
indicted in the blanket Washington sedition case.)
