I-uh... of course, that'as a little bit before my time but... yet-uh I's-uh (y'know) I worked on a farm an' (y'know), these big cotton plan'ations... an'-er I had my uncle to tell me (y'know) 'bout the levee camps.  (KID BEGINS TO GET CONFUSED)  'Course I have never worked on the levee camps, but I have worked (y'know) on plan'ations...

SID:  Did you ever go 'roun' a levee camp?  Did you ever see any tools that the people work with on a levee camp?

KID:  O yes, I have.  Yeah, I've saw the tools that they used, y'know, an' I've had 'em to (y'know?)...

SID:  Wha'-what did they look like to you?  Wha-what-what did they tell you they was, the tools they was workin' with?

KID:  O, well-er-they had-er-uh large wrench, you know, that they-uh (y'know) screwed the bolts-uh on the rail with... I forget it look somethin' like a pipe... (NOW KID HAS FALLEN INTO THE TRAP AND SID IS OUT TO TEASE HIM)
