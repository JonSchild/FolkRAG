Mrs. Ruby P. Tartt
Livingston, Alabama

Dear Mrs. Tartt:

Your letter of December 10 addressed to Mr. Alan Lomax has
 been referred to me. As you know, Mr. Lomax is no longer with the 
Library, having resigned to take a position with the Office of War
Information.

In view of the shortness of time and the pressure of work in 
the Recording Laboratory, it is impossible for us to select and
duplicate records from the Sumter County collection for your club
meeting on December 18. Instead we are sending you copies of 3 
records which were selected for pressing and inclusion in the
albums of Folk Music of the United States from the Archive of American
Folk Song. We trust that these will reach you in time. After you
have heard them, we shall be glad to make duplicates of any of the
other Sumter County recordings which you may want. This will give us
an opportunity to make a more careful selection and estimate with Mr.
Lomax's help.

I still remember my visit to your home with Myrtle Miles and
Luther Clark back in 1939. This was one of the richest experiences 
in my WPA career, and I have always regretted that I never wrote you
afterwards. The recordings of Vera Hall and Dock and Henry Reed will
always remind me of my visit as my memories of them make their songs
live for me.

At Mr. Lomax's request, I have sent his father the letter you
enclosed from Mrs. Boyd. I was distressed to hear of Dock Reed's
condition and hope he will soon recover.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

B. A. Botkin
Assistant in Charge
