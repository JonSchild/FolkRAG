Mr. Alan A. Lomax,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Regarding publication of the song "ALLA EN EL
RANCHO GRANDE", about which we spoke in New York City, we
have learned the following facts:

1. A copy of the song, Silvano Roman,
author, was filed in Washington, D.C.,
April 30, 1927 by Salvator Cabrera.

2. This copyright assigned to Edward
B. Marks Music Corporation July, 1934.

3. Marks obtained another copyright on
English Lyrics and arrangement, dated
October 5, 1934; February 27, 1934; and
March, 1938.

4. Song copyrighted by E. Tovar, May 18, 1934.

5. An arrangement by Donald Reep, filed
Nov. 2, 1937 by Southern Music Co.

6. Stasny Music Corporation, (our client),
filed arrangement 1939.

We, the Stasny Music Corporation are sued by
Marks, claiming our arrangement infringes the Ramos copyright
of 1927. Our defense is that Ramos is not the original
composer, that the song is traditional and in the
public domain.

As you are aware, the song appears in "AMERICAN
BALLADS & FOLK SONGS" published by your father and yourself
in 1934, and in foot notes you cite the Publication of the
Texas Folk-Lore Society. We have the IX Edition of this
work, published in 1931, and the song appears therein. But
