Arrangements
The Conference will be held on the lovely campus of
New Jersey College for Women. Delegates will be
housed in dormitories and meals will be served in the college 
dining room. The total cost of room, board and registration 
will be $12.00. In the past delegates have come to
I.S.S. conferences as representatives of their various campus 
organizations and frequently these organizations have
paid the delegates' fees. The type of organization which is
invited to send representatives includes: the Christian Association 
or its equivalent, the International Relations
Club, the college newspaper, the History Club, the Student
Government, campus liberal clubs, peace societies and
kindred groups.
We know that campus organizations would be interested
in sending delegates to this conference and we urge you to
see that your organization is represented.
