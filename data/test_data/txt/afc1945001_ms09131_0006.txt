1.  I have heard that the Germans did in one 
campaign send wave after wave of men into a 
passe while fighting the English.  After too 
many men had piled up and blocked the 
pass, then, the Germans, sent a tank through 
the piles of dead men to clear the way 
for more men.  

2.  I have heard that Hitler is sickly and 
is about dead of over exertion and worry 

3.  I have heard that the waacs and waves 
are not for the purpose [of] suggested by their 
advertisements but are in reality to be used 
as prostitutes for soldiers and sailors.  

4.  I have heard that one method of instruction 
used by our Marine Corps is the use of lead 
pipe & rubber hose on those soldiers who 
are slow to learn or who need minor discipline 

5.  I have heard that most soldiers feel (as do 
most civilians) that the college student is a 
professional slacker and that antagonism toward 
the college students is strong.
