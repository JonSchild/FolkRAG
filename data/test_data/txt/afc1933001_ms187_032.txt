The Study of Czechoslovak folksong in the United States.
   The subject of this study is one of the principal manifestations
of Czechoslovak folk-culture, which perform important
and multifarious social functions in the Czechoslovak villages
to this day. It is one of the oldest and also most vital popular
traditions of Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak folksong is likewise
one of the most expressive and resistant elements in the
cultural life of Czechoslovak immigrants in America.
   Yet, both as regards the repertoire and its textual and
musical form as well as its social-cultural functions, the folksong,
like the other manifestations of national culture succombed
to the new social-economic, national and linguistic surroundings.
   The study of these changes is a valuable contribution to
the sociological and anthropological research of the gradual
cultural and psychological assimilation of the immigrant in the 
new surroundings and new living conditions.
     This complex of problems is instructive as well in a 
practical way: it shows us objectively which part of the Czechoslovak
cultural heritage is the most stable and vital and in
which respect the Czechoslovak succombs most easly to the process
of Americanization. From this we can, on the one hand, greatly benefit
for the purpose of American education of the Czechoslovak
immigrants and, on the other hand, for the systematic application
of its national contribution to the cultural life of America as a
whole.
