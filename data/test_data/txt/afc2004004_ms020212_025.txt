Dear Alan,
A note to tell you what you probably already know by the
time this is received. I was unsuccessful in budging the singers,
possibly due to my being in such a thrash trying to get the girls off.
They will arrive (the singers) five p.m. Thursday; they could have
made it earlier either by airplane or bus -- there [we] was absolutely
no possibility by train. I am not sure what the governing factors
were; I think there is a prestige factor connected with bus travel
for them (though actually the trip would have been faster and less
of a hassle by bus -- only one change at Memphis and about twelve
hours shorter). Planes are quite a problem; I did not have time to
thrash the whole thing out, but we hereabouts have had very little
luck in persuading both Mance Lipscomb and Lightning to fly. (John
flew once with Lightning, and L. killed about a quart on the way.)
John Davis got a real firm note in his voice when I mentioned [this]
flying, and I think you will have to go over it carefully.

Second factor was money; getting their money back from the
train company would take two or three weeks. They could have paid
their own bus fare but didn't want to; Bessie suggested that Ed or
I pay for them and then collect the ticket money back from their
train fares. I pointed out that we would have to [wait] wait just as
long as she would and besides, they had the money and I didn't, but
I don't think she really believed me.

[*Thirdly*] The third problem and the one where I possibly
butched it, is that I do not understand [the inn] how they operate on
a group level. I first spent about three hours finding out the
various possibilities and then phoned them (I simply did not have the
time to go and see them -- they live 45 minutes from [the house] us, and
my family problems were enormous at that point). Mabel answered the
phone; I outlined the problem to her and asked her to tell the others
and get everyone to think about it and I would call back later. Mabel,
being the youngest, is the quickest on business matters, and I thought
she could explain it clearly. For prestige, though, I should have
talked to John; when I called back two hours later, I had to explain
it all over again to each one of them, including all possible schedules,
changes, layovers and the works. I must have been on the phone over an
hour with the girls leaving the end of the day. Finally I got mad
whereupon Bessie stepped into the breach and tried to fix up the matter
socially by coming to see us with Emma and Mrs. Goose Tatum (a charming
person and Dina's sister, she tells me) two hours before the girls'
bus left! As I say, I am not clear as to whether they ever function as
a group except musically; they are terribly competitive on all such
matters as presents, even grabby over the old clothes I have piled up
to send to the island which they can't possibly use themselves. Bessie
and Emma side up against Mabel; John blames all problems on the "women"
[and as I] Henry supports[s] John emotionally and won't move without him,
and, as I say, Mabel, though the only one who thinks in any kind of a
business-like way, is the least effective dancer and singer. So......

Anyway, I'm sorry. I tried to call you all over the weekend
but no luck. As to the film, Ted says the reason for the delay is that
the head camera man Archer Goodwin is doing all the sync work himself
for free on his own time; this naturally slows things down. Goodwin,
