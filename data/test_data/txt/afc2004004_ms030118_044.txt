They ought to be on equally basis.  Jes like when he git ready,
you is ready; when he git ready to quit, you is too.  But if he's
reachin beyond you, you understand, he need a greater woman than
you.  Anytime you got a man, you understan, an you keep on reachin
fur anothah man, that man ain't enoug h fur you.  Some people might
call you all kinds of names cause that man ain't enough fur you.
But you jis ain't reached yo man yet.  Jis ain't reached you man
yit.  Whenever you reach your man, you can't go no further.  You got
enough.  Thass right.
     (You think that's true for a man, too?)
     I k now so.  If a man gits holt to a woman can't give
him enough, you understand, Well, she ain't enough fur im.  Thass
right.  Ain't no use callin huh no dog because she can't give him
enough.  She jus ain't his mate.  See?  Any man can't satisfy
yo u.  See?  An me myself, I don't want no woman what start wid me
and knock me off in no short time. I wants to enjoy what I do.
     (Do you make love a long time, Rev. Davis?)
     Specially if I got a-holt of somethin that I want.
I don't wanna be knocked off.  You can't knock me off right quick.
A woman have to be real, real warm inside to pull me off right
quick.  You know how a woman ought to be, inside?  Hotter than a man's
hand.  HOT.  You know jes about how hot watah is when you pu t yo
hand in it?  She oughta be bout three parts warmer than that inside.
Time a man git in theah, he can't stand that, cause it's too hot
in theah, you understand.  Bound to shoot.  If I strike one an she's
cold, I got a bad job on hand.  Some women, just brush up against em,
I jus jump up lak a hog jumpin up out of the pen.  Rare up jes like
a mule.  Have to jes rub mysef to keep mysef down.  That's a right
smart affectionary woman.  Right smart affectionary.  You take a woman
like that, if a man's almost dead, cold natured, you understand,
