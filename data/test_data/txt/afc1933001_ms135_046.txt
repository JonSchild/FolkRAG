San Antonio, Texas.

Dear Mrs. Beach[*y*][er]:

Your request is being forwarded on to John A. Lomax 
who is now in Europe and you will doubtless hear from him 
shortly.

I suggest that you write another letter at once, 
care of Thomas Cook and sons, 2 Place de la Madeleine, Paris, 
France, specifying what cowboy ballads you want to reprint 
in your volume.  I should appreciate your sending me the 
reference you mentioned in the Kansas City Star.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge

Folk-song.
