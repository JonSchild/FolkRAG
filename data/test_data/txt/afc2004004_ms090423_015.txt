"hallies" like "I'm Going Home on the Morning Train, The
Evening Train May Be Too Late."

We have here on this plantation, a band of good folks.
You kin ketch some doing more wrong than right, but that
ain't supposed to be no really fall down of the church
cause it suppose to put you out for dancing and cursing.
Of course now a days we send officers of the church down
to places to see how members do and the officers get in
more devilment than the people we send them down there
to watch. But us good christians, we don't stand for
them. And we knows that they do things, yes, but undercover.
People just don't go to the church like they
used to. The church ain't got no "pillars". The ones
it done had done left here and gone North; and they got
them youngsters in there now, and it ain't no center no
more. The other day, the church lasted all the day, but
that wasn't with preaching and singing. They was trying
to get money. 12. 

Another comments:

Yah they is having box suppers at the church, but they 
don't have all them old kinds of things often. And when
they gives them now, it's mostly for making money and not
just for no sociableness. 13. 

So changed are the people's needs that even the church entertainment
shows a considerable degree of urban influence. For example,
during the week of October 19, 1941 "Heaven and Hell" was on everybody's
mind and many people ask one another: "Are you going to the Heaven and
Hell Party given by the Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. Business Club of the
St. John Baptist Church?" Others merely accepted it as inevitable.
Mr. John Jones, the deacon, "lives a good life and plays around with a 
few women every now and then", says: "All the deacons of the church are
going to stay away from the party. We are going to let them younger 
folks, you understand, have their way."
