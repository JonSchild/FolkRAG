GOOD-BY OLD PAINT

(Chorus):
Good-by, Old Paint, I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne,
Good-by, Old Paint, I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne.
I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne, I'm off to Montan',
Good-by, Old Paint, I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne.
I'm a-ridin' Old Paint, I'm a-leadin' old Fan, etc.
With my feet in the stirrups,my bridle in my hand,etc.
Old Paint's a good pone,he paces when he can, etc.
I'm sorry, young lady,my pony won't stand, etc.
