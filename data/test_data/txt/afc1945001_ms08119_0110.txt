         One of the earliest legends about Lincoln
is an episode that occurred in 1832 , when he was
the newly appointed Captain of the Bucktail Rangers. 
His troop, marching in platoons, was confronted
by a fence with a gate that was tightly locked.
  Captain Lincoln had no idea of the proper
order, but his wits did not desert him. "The
company is dismissed for two minutes," he
ordered. "Then it will fall in on the other side
of the fense."
