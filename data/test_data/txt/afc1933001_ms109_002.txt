Darling:

Please tell Nick for me that
there is no newspaper & won't
be for two or three weeks
until it becomes a gov. subsidy.
Meantime it is important that
I have money, as I have a
chance to move into the house
of one of the most interesting
families here, a place
where people of all colors
& inclinations visit
