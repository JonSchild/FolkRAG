three-thrity.  The queen was unconscious.  He fucked intil four, and
the guards began to get uneasy, and they decided to go down and see
what was the trouble.  And the man was sitting up on the side of the
bed jacking off his teeth pointed on.

It was on the fifth of May
When the great Titanic went down.
Paul Shine was on the bottom of the deck.
Him and his mate was havin a little chat.
Paul Shine ran up to the top of the deck,
Say, "Captain, captain, the water is now
Coming in the boiler room door."
He say, "Go back, Paul Shine, and pump the water tight;
we got one hundred and fifty pumps to keep the water back."
Paul Shine backed his black ass off the boat
And began to swim.
The captain, say, "Come back, Paul Shine;
Come to me.
I'll make you just as rich 
As any man can be."
Paul Shine looked back
Over his shoulder and said,
"What good is money
in the middle of the sea?"
Went right ahead.  Just then
A millionaire girl
Walked in the bottom of the deck.
She say, "Come back, Paul Shine,
And save poor me.
I can be your wife;
It's ture."
He looked back
Over his shoulder and said,
"For me you're pudding
And jelly roll, it's true."
He said, "There are a thousand
In New York good as you."
He swum right ahead.
Just then a whale
Jumped up the sea.
Paul Shine looked back
Over his shoulder again.
Jumped up and walked the water 
Like Christ did in Galilee.
When the Titanic went down
Paul Shine was down in Holland,
Almost damn drunk.
The Devil was [y]laying across his bed.
He got up and walked to the door
And walked out and said,
"They were a long time coming,
But they welcome to Hell."
