the ground, indicate it would
all be pumped out soon.  He fed
me well & talked his Nazi talk. His
type of young brainless, efficient engineer
is the heart & soul, the future
Nazis of America.  Everyone here
talks about the "GD Meskins."
Familiarly about draft-dodging.  Pugnaciously
against Hitler - anti-war.  A sky
full of stars & a cool wind from the 
Gulf for sleeping.

Polo Abingo, San Perlita, Texas
friend of Frank Goodwyn's

Drove to Kingsville and spent the
afternoon talking with Frank 
Goodwyn & watching his two babies,
Pancho and Tex rolling on the floor.
He knows the country down here,
speaks Spanish beautifully, has a
good, hard Texan rural mind -
