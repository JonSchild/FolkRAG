THE COW GIRL
Sung by Howard Spurlock.

A pretty fair maiden all out on the plains
Who helped me herd cattle through hailstorm and rains
She helped me herd cattle whatever was done,
She'd [take] drink her corn whiskey from the cold, bitter cup.

She'd drink her corn whiskey that 
As fine as a lily, as white as the snow,
We were camped in a canyon in the fall of the year,
and a herd of fat steers

I taught her the language of the cowboy's command,
To hold a six-shooter in each little hand,
To hold a six-shooter and never to run,
As long as a bullet was left in her gun.
