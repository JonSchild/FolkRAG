Folk Songs May Inspire America's Soldiers 
By Katherine Graham 
     American soldiers have always 
had their own songs. Sometimes 
they have been martial with a 
blood-stirring lilt and sometimes 
the men have hit upon some universally 
appealing ditty about 
"The Girl I Left Behind Me." 
     With national defense uppermost 
in the public mind songs 
that soldiers sing have again become 
a problem for consideration 
from Tin Pan Alley to the White 
House. 
     It may be that some unknown 
genius will come forth with a 
melody tomorrow that will spread 
through army camps and naval 
stations like wild fire. Or it may 
be that for its songs, the country 
will look to its heritage. The 
people may hit on folk songs. 
     Neither martial airs nor 
patriotic tunes in the ordinary 
sense of those words, these songs 
are not new. Many of them are 
anonymous and most of them tell 
of hard work, the everyday 
work of earning a living. 
     They sing of picking cotton in 
the South, churning butter on a 
farm, working on a railroad, on 
a chain gang, building levees or 
cow punching in the West. They 
speak to a mule or talk to a lady 
love and often in the same vein. 
     But most of all the songs speak 
of America, and that is why they 
may be used to defend the 
country from which they sprang. 

At the White House 
     Several events are conspiring 
to bring folk songs to the fore. 
For instance a performance was 
presented at the White House last 
Monday night under the direction 
of the Library of Congress entitled. 
"A Program of American 
Songs for American Soldiers," 
and the White House timbers 
shook to the strains of "Whoopee 
To Yo. Git Along, Little Dogies," 
"Drill, Ye Tarriers, Drill," and 
"The Boll Weevil," sung by enlisted 
service men as well as 
professionals. 
     Mrs. Roosevelt commented 
afterwards in her column: "I hope 
these songs spread through all 
the branches of the service. I 
would like to see musical instruments 
available and records of 
these songs in the recreation 
centers and in every community 
center near a camp throughout 
the country. I think it would 
make us conscious of our rich 
background of folk literature and 

O graze along dogies and keep 
kinda slow, 
And don't forever be on the go. 
O move slow dogie, move slow. 
O, say little dogie, when you 
goin' to lay down, 
And stop this forever a siften' 
around, 
My legs are weary, my seat is 
sore, 
O, lay down, dogies, like you've 
laid before. 
Lay down, dogies, lay down." 
     A dogie, in case you didn't 
know, "is a little orphan calf 
whose mammy is dead, and whose 
pappy has run off with another 
cow." For this bit of information 
you will have to accept the 
word of John A. Lomax, honorary 
curator of the Archive of American 
Folk Songs. 
Songs of the People 
     For many years Lomax and his 
son, Alan, now an assistant in 
the library's division of music, 
have been traveling into remote 
and isolated regions of the country 
recording songs of the people, 
all of which are now in the 
library. In 1910 from a Negro 
saloonkeeper in San Antonio, 
Tex., Lomax first heard and 
recorded "Home On the Range" 
which he says is a favorite of 
President Roosevelt and which 
Admiral Byrd played on a portable 
victrola at the South Pole 
until his instrument froze. 
     Aside from the possibility of 
using the songs in camps, other 
developments forecast a general 
increasing knowledge and use of 
folk songs. One of these is a 
series of 13 broadcasts being 
recorded by John A. Lomax for 
radio use. The library has not 
yet worked out plans for distribution 
of these programs but will 
announce them later. 
     Another method is the broadcast 
every other Tuesday made by 
Alan Lomax, assistant in the 
division, on Columbia's American 
School of the Air which reaches 
a reputed 130,000 schools all over 
the country. 
 
Library of Folk Music 
     And nearing completion is the 
library's streamlined sound 
laboratory, built with a Carnegie 
grant of last spring which will 
make duplicate recordings 
possible. This means the extensive 
15,000-song library of folk
