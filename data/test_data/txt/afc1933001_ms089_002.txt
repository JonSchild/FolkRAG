Dear Mr. Spivocke:
More than a year ago I submitted
through your office against the
Library of Congress an itemized statement
of necessary expenses incurred during 
my last trip for the Folk Song Archive
I remained in Washington until March
15 but until I left I could obtain
only the statement that the account could 
not be settled "until all the bills
against the authorization for the trip had
come in." I spoke to you about the
unpaid bill, once in your office
as late as last June. During the summer
i wrote again to you while you
were on your vacation. [T????] Mr.
Waters wrote to me about the matter,
