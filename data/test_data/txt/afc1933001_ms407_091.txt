TRENCH BLUES 
"Big Nig" of Amelia, Louisiana, stood six feet and seven inches 
in his socks. Alan, on one of our visits, measured the spread of his 
mighty arms as an inch longer. When he works, "Big Nig" is the singing 
leader of a gang of Negroes who snake cypress out of the Louisiana 
swamps. "Big Nig" booms his signals to the flatboat out on 
the black bayou; the engineer toots his reply, and the logs come 
busting through the tangled swamp forest. Ten whistles means "A man 
dead." 
On our first visit we mistakenly tipped "Big Nig" in advance of 
his singing, only to find out later that he had become too drunk to 
sing. A year or so afterwards repeated visits put on records the 
singing and guitar picking of this remarkable man. 
The "Trench Blues", according to "Big Nig", was composed during 
the World War when he was a soldier in France. "They didn't 
give me a gun," said "Big Nig"; "all the weapons I ever had was my 
guitar, a shovel, and a mop." 
The tune resembles "C. C. Rider" and "Careless Love" in Negro 
Folk Songs As Sung by Lead Belly (Macmillan, 1936).
