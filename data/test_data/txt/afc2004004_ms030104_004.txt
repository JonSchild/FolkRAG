[*have mercy on me and
send Lazarus, that he may
dip the tip of his finger in water
and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in the flame."*]     [*55*]

You know, since weâ€˜ve had a little learning,
Since, we've had a little polish and a little culture,     (4
Hell's gone out of business.
Fact, it's almost out of existence ---
[But} According to the notion and [theory of some-]     (4)
But as far as the scripture is concerned
And as far as I personally am concerned,
Ther's still a Hell.

(Not all the ministers that are here     dais ?]

This fine array of young men
That you see here along with myself
They used to preach about Hell so                (6)
That even during the wintertime
Folk say "Raise the window
It's gettin warm in here."

But we have left it off so long until
The folks don't believe that there's any use        (6)
in trying to shun Hell.
But, folks, there's a hell, yet.
Some of us call it Hades and others Purgatory, but
That's just a full dress suit on the word, Hell.
In fact, that's the modrenest style,
Of giving you the slant on the place that
You wouldn't want to live eternally.

But it's just as impossible to do away with Hell
As it is impossible to do 'way with Heaven.

The first fact I wish to call your attention to is  (6)
Is that there is a Hell. There is a Hell.
[There is a Hell.]
Sinners without change of mind, without a change of purpose
Without a change of motive, when this life of yours is ended  (6)
Whether now or sometime later to come
Eternally your life hereafter will be spent in Hell.
