[*Mr. Alan Lomax     -2-     December 11, 1941*]

Will you please either wire me or write me here (WesternUnion, Burlington,
N.C.) by noon of the 17th? I expect to be in Staunton on the 18th
and in Washington on the 19th. My Staunton address is care R. L. James,
Box 427 (437 E. Beverly St.), Staunton, Virginia. I can come to
Washington before then if better for you; I consider my other
Washington appointments of inferior importance to talking with you
about the project

Cordially yours,
Fletcher
Fletcher Collins, Jr.

P.S. I am holding the recording equipment here until I have
word from you. When I come to Washington, I can bring the
equipment with me. And I half-expect a wire from you this
afternoon, requesting further recordings of reactions to the
German and Italian declarations.
