A vaudou song sung by Laience, a servitor in the hounfort
and a pretender to the rank of houngan at Cocoye--a little
habitation about a mile from Pont Beudet.
Agasu Yeme is his family loa and this is one of the songs that
Laience like best and is known by. The people of Le Roux like
to listen to it, but they listen to laugh because of the way
Laience grings in the names of members of his family into a
serious religious song. So far as he is concerned, however, it
is a serious song and I have seen him use it when he called
on the loa in a seance in his little mud cay.

etc., the same words, naming his children and some of his
cousins. The songs ends as many singers here end them--
"Aye bobo."
What the song means is it is unsafe for someone not intimate
in vaudoo to say. Agasu Yeme's back is a mirror and he
can see both directions. [EeZe} Bleo, ble---double, double.
Bocay---bocage--little grove. Marassa, the twins. Dosu, the
child born after twins in a family, very dangerous and
potentially very potent spiritually.

The first song that Anita sang for me and by all odds the
best, this is a very important song in the vaudoo cult in
this locality. It is sung
