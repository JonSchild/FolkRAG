Dear Mr. Lomax:
We wish to refer to our correspondence with you last November 
regarding the selection"Oh, Didn't He Ramble". We have been 
endeavoring to match up this song, or at least the Chorus, with 
the "Ram of Derby" but so far have been unable to find the similarity. 
The publisher insists that the music was new in 1902 and was 
written by Bob Cole, who was a partner in the vaudeville team of 
Johnson and Cole, and copyrighted under the name of will Handy 
instead of Bob Cole. Will Handy, of course, has no connection 
with W. C. Handy of "St. Louis Blues" fame.

The writer has spent some time in the New York library looking up 
some of the books to which you have referred us. Wherever I have 
found a few bars of the music quoted with reference to the "Ram 
of Derby" song, the music appears to be quite different from the 
familiar Chorus refrain of "Oh, Didn't He Ramble".

We still feel that without a doubt the number was not new and 
original in 1902 as claimed, but so far we have not been able to 
find satisfactory evidence to the contrary. I wonder if it would 
be possible for you to look into this matter a little further for 
us and if possible, either give us definite citations or perhaps 
secure for us and at our expense photostat copy of some Chorus 
older than the 1902 publication and which would show that the 
Chorus of the familiar Ballad is older. I hope you can find 
time to give us a little further in this matter, and remain
Very truly yours, 
HC Darnell
Manager of Copyright Section.
