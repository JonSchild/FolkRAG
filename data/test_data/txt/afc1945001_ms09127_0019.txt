Anecodate 

[*a.*] 

My story is a horrible, but true incident, 
that happened to a high school student.  It was his
desire to help the war effort and to make some
money, which encouraged his going to night school
to learn the skill of operating a machine.  Things 
went fine for awhile.  He could see visions of himself
at his new job, making money, and buying
war bonds, when it happened. 
His machine was one with two thin, oval
cylinders which moved together and apart. Tonight,
his arm, yes, his arm was caught in the movement
of these cylinders, crushing it as it came
together, and pulling it in further and further as
the cylinders came apart.  Before the machine was
stopped, his arm was almost all the way into the 
machine. 
When he drew his arm out, a fellow
standing near, fainted at the horrible sight. 
At last he arrived at the hospital where
he was informed that his arm must be
amputated!  And it was!
