Temporary appointment of
Mr. Alan Lomax.

Mr. Rogers, in charge of personnal, has just reminded me that the temporary
appointment of Alan Lomax, which as you will recall was for a five-month period, terminated on April 30. With the prospect that a new position in connection with the Archive will be provided for in the current appropriations bill - a position for which Mr. Lomax is of course ideally qualified - I should like to recommend that Mr. Lomax be kept on the Library rolls as a temporary employee until such time as he can be appointed to the new position.
