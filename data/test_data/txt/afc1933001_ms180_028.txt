Dear Smith Cason:
The Library of Congress, for whom you made some
mighty good records in 1939, is planning to publish
some of its best folk songs for use in schools and
colleges and for distribution to the governments of
the Latin American republics. We have chosen two
of your songs as representative, namely, The Country
Rag and Two White Horses in a Line. These songs
will be duplicated on one side of a 12-inch record
and for the privilege of using this material, we
are able to pay you $15.00 and will send you two
copies of the record for your own use. Before we
can do this, however, we must have your permission
which I hope you will give us by signing and returning
the enclosed form as soon as possible.
All the records will carry the legend, "For non-commercial 
use only" and, of course, your name
will appear on every record.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
