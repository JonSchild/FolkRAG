a - If a claim is presented against the Publisher alleging that the said 
composition is an infringement upon some other composition, and because 
thereof the Publisher is jeopardized, it shall thereupon serve written notice 
upon the Composer, containing the full details of such a claim and thereafter 
until the claim has been adjudicated or settled shall pay any moneys coming 
due the Composer hereunder in escrow to any bank or trust company to 
be held pending the outcome of such claim; provided, however, if no suit 
be filed within twelve months after written notice to the Composer by the 
Publisher of the adverse claim, the said bank or trust company shall 
release and pay to the Composer all sums held in escrow, plus any interest 
which may have been earned thereupon, but less reasonable counsel fees 
incurred by the Publisher in dismissing the claim. Such payment shall be 
without prejudice to the rights of Publisher in event of a subsequent adverse 
adjudication. 

b - From and after the service of a summons in a suit for infringement filed 
against Publisher in respect of the said composition, all payments hereunder 
thereafter coming due to the composer, shall be paid to the Publisher in 
trust to any bank or trust company until the suit has been finally adjudicated 
and then be disbursed accordingly, unless the Composer shall elect to file 
an acceptable bond in the sum of such payments, in which event the sums 
shall be paid to the Composer. The Composer agrees to reimburse the 
Publisher for reasonable counsel fees incurred by the Publisher in defending 
the suit. 

9 - The Composer hereby consents to the assignment of this contract or the said 
composition, or the copyright thereof, or any and all of the rights therein by the 
Publisher to any person, firm or corporation whatsoever, subject, however, to 
the payment of the royalties herein specified. The term "publisher" as used 
herein shall be deemed to include the publisher and its successors and assigns. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Composer has hereunto set his hand and the 
Publisher has caused these present to be signed by its duly authorized officer 
the day and year first above written.
