the vast swamps of the [UNCLEAR].  And in the south a marshy
shore that's neither sea nor land.
     It was here that. . .Cajun culture, black and 
white originated.  And for it was here that adventurers,
that, that shiploads of, of blacks came from, landed from
Africa, from Martinique, from Haiti, and encountered in
many, on, on many political, in many social arrangements of 
French coming down the river from Mississippi and from, and
ultimately from across the sea in the [Aquatane], in the
[Bandez] south of Brittany, another land of, another low
land marshy plane along the seas [march].
     From there they launched their, from here
most French colonial expeditions sailed to, to people of the
new world, and to open up French [UNCLEAR], colonial
possessions round the planet in the 16th and 17th
centuries.  This was the land of, this was an old land of
pastoral farmers who understood the marsh.  Who were aided
by the Dutch in, in draining it with a system of canals.
And who, seamen, fisherman, farmers, the land of [Watu].
All Cajuns came from this terrain.  A terrain almost
identical with that of Louisiana.  A, a terrain with a
magic, a, a. . . .no.  All Cajuns came from this terrain.  And
like so many wanderers, [SIRENS] somehow found matching
country of their own in their new world.  Again, a land of
marsh and sea coast.
