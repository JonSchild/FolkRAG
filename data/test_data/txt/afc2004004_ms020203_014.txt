reckon.  I never did know the father.  I never heard George 
say anything bout his father.  She'd beat him, she said she'd 
beat him till it look like she was gonna kill him, but 
it didn't do any good. .. She had another a son, older than 
George was, but he never was there.  He never was raised up there.
Somebody raised him up there in Utah, I believe, up there in Green 
county somewhere.  And when he got grown he come off up the 
road here, he way off up here in the North somewhere now...  
He never has lived at home, he never was round George.  Good thing 
he wasn't, cause I guess he was better than George.
E: What kind of temper did his mother have?
[*His mama is a sweet woman*]
V: Sweet temper.  Everybody say they don't know where in the world   
she get him from.  Where he could have come from with such a
mean dispositions as he had.  Everybody down there say he got 
a sweet mother, which I know she sweet, cause I know her, she 
so kind and sweet and it look like she love everybody.  She goes 
to church, well she just lovely.  I don't know where she got 
Nunc from.  He just a fair devil here on earth. Don't know where 
he come from and still carryin' on all that meanness. and got 
old now Look like he ought to reelize he's gonna die some days.
His time is nearly out.  If he come in here right now, he'd 
be jsut as happy, just laughin and tellin somw kind of funny 
[*George always laughing-*]
joke and just full of fun all the time.  Never even thinks about 
all those mean things that he did.  .. He just walk up in a 
crowd and say sumpin funny call some of the men some kind of funny 
name.  He treats everybody right, but don't fight him, don't 
work him up, we calls it workin' him up...(END)
