Drinking in Ireland - There is no word for sober in Gaelic.

The Irishman drinks out of a 
deep sense of obligation to family.
He drinks to become his father again.
He can go away from his mother into
the bar - slightly grimy, always com -
radely, a gentle male nuzzling, where
there is more treating than I've seen
in any other country.  As if in the bar
the Irishman could prove that he was
richer than he actually was - out
in the seat of his pants.

There is a serious pause before
he orders - stout - gin - whiskey,
ale, orange squash. It depends on
what condition his resolution is in.
He may have given up the drink
after Xmas for a sober New Year and 
after the 10th day will turn round
& look at himself in pride and say
14 days and not a drop.  That fatal
remark will push him splash
into the drink until Lent when he
may climb out for a day
