3 Double-barrelled items
4 Prejudice expressions
5 Anxiety-motivated items

B Some types of items can safely be counteracted directly.
1 Preposterous items.
2 Items based on superstitions, astrology, belief in magic.
3 Items based on some types of folk beliefs.

IV Direct counteraction should be done with care.

A Denials must be based on authoritative information

B They must be complete, a denial that is merely another version
of the original should be avoided

C They must be colorful and amusing, completely disarming even those
who believed and spread the original.

D Items about groups in controversy should be avoided.

E For counteraction purposes, items with a special group reference
may be shifted in emphasis to the detail which is being used to
carry the prejudice.

F Security officers must check to be sure program is not being used
to pry information out of authoritative sources.

G In presenting "phoneys" in print, paired with facts, great care
should be taken.
1 The phoney should not be in bold type and the fact in small.
It is preferable to make the phoney and the fact appear in the
same type, properly labeled.
2 The phoney quoted should have the word PHONEY (in bold caps)
printed at the beginning, in the middle (several times if a
long one), and at the end.
3 Never put into headline or sub-heads the substance of the phoney,
emphasize the truth.
4 Publicity should emphasize that the truth will be published,
not that phoneys will be reproduced.
5 Use terms like "truth", "fact", to describe authoritative material,
not "answer". Phoneys are not "answered", they are
annihilated!

V All forms of media of communication should be used for the total informational
program. Radios, however, should be avoided in the direct
counteraction sections.

A Part of the program should be to teach people care in thinking.
