"LISTENING SERVICE"

[*8*]

BOND SALES
"I suppose they will freeze the Victory Bonds or
suspend payment of interest after the war is over and
people are trying to cash them. But of course we must
hang on and win the war, regardless!"

CEILINGS ON PRICES
"The most sensible thing the government has done,––
if they can make it stick!"

WASTE OF TIRES
"Soldiers seem to ride about in jeeps at the least
provocation,––even use them while on leave,––while the  [*1*]
rest of us try to save our tires."

BUS TRANSPORTATION
"Since so much poor bus transportation is due to lack
of mechanics to service the motor coaches, it would be
advisable, I should think, for the government to require
the transit company to pay their mechanics wages adequate
to keep them on the job for smooth-running transportation
which in turn would do much for civilian morale."
