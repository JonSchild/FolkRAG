Some Sense of Humor

At 5:15 in the morning or I should
say in the middle of the night, I was awakened
by a shrill blow on a trumpet. The next thing
I knew I was dressed, shaved, and standing in
front of my already made bunk ready for
inspection.

As a joke one of the other gobs droped
a piece of paper beside my bunk. The officer
spotted this instantly. "Seaman Holmes," he shouts,
"after breakfast you may report back here with
a scrub brush and pail, and scrub every inch
of this floor (the floor being the dormitory floor)
until it is spotless. Then you may report for
guard duty at 2 o'clock, where you will be relieved
at 6. Be sure to report with full push. Oh! and
yes, no week end pass this week.

If you are ever in the navy and
want to die young just drop a piece of paper
beside one of your buddie's bunks at inspection,
and take the consequences.
