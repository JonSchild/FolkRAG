[1. Army appointments:] "I think there is something more
to this Aroff affair than meets the eye. Now you know there's a
lot of gifts and such given to Army officers who help get appointments
and commissions for people. I don't think that's all wrong. [*76*]
There's nothing so awful about giving a man a car you can't use,
or giving him anything else no more valuable than that. I don't
think that's bribery or anything. But here's why I think Aroff
is getting into trouble: he's Jewish and they're after him--that's
all." [(Heard in Lakewood, Jefferson County,] Colorado, [August 3)]
