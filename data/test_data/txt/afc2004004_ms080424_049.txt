(stan)  Now then, you get that doin' and then you get to get your
leaf, you see you get one off of the same branch that you have. . .
and you cut this off like that.  Then you run it in its mouth,
that's what I call 'run it down its mouth' (technical). . . . . .
You pick up the leaf like this (technical). . . .You got to get it
very smooth, like that.  And they you can put it right down in its
mouth, like that.  And you have to put it very tight, somethin'
like this. . .that does pretty well I believe.  And a lot of times
these don't work, so you cut it right very close there, like that,
and then you cut if off like this, right there.  And then you go
to the other side, you have to turn it around, you see.  And you
hold this down on it so you don't tear you leaf, then you cut it
right up this way.  When you get that done, if it really works
good, then you can call the crows in.  Well, I'll try it and see
 if there are crows around.  I don't know whether they're 'round or
not and don't know how this'll work out,  (unint.)  when it would,
but this is sometimes don't.  (blows)  This one don't. . . .
