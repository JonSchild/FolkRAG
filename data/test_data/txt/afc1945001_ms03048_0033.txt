Philadelphia Office
Report made August 14, 1942
Rumor Report - Week of August 3, 1942
7. I've heard that there is going to be a drastic shake-up
in the personnel of W.P.B. and O.P.A., from the top on down.
The President and a lot of Congressmen are disgusted with
the way those two war agencies have fallen into disrepute with thinking
people, and Congress is going to ask Leon Henderson to resign.
Harrisburg -- Former high state official. Intelligence above average.
8. Leon Henderson is a publicity hound, who is never in his 
office, but who spends three nights a week showing himself off in New 
York night clubs. His prestige is shallow, having been built up by
newspaper columnists. To a favored few, Danton Walker, in particular,
he gives choice bits of information on coming Government policies and
secret Administrational moves.
Philadelphia -- 8/5/42. Overheard at a late hour gathering place of
radio, stage, and newspapermen.
In addition to the rumors listed as of August 3 to August 8,
we picked up many in regards to the trial of the eight saboteurs.
We feel that, in the light of subsequent events, these rumors can
not be entirely discounted.
It is the feeling of this office that the rumors having the
greatest percent of validity are those concerning the conditions that
are said to exist in the Army and Navy Munitions and Supply Depots
being built in Pennsylvania.
