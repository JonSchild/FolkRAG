The Jealous Lover

One night the moon shone brightly,
The stars were shining too
When to Luella's cottage
Her jealous lover drew.

He said Love come let us wander
Into the woods so gay,
And wandering we will ponder
Upon our wedding day.

Deep, deep into the forest
He led the dreary way
Said she it's only for you Willy
That I am wandering here.

Oh the way seems dark and dreary,
And I'm afraid to stay,
Of wandering I am weary,
And would retrace my way.

Retrace your way no never,
No more these wilds you'll roam,
So bid farewell forever
To parents, friends, and home.

Down on her knees before him,
She pleaded for her life,
Deep, deep into her bosom
He plunged the fatal knife.

Oh Willy I forgive you,
With my last dying breath,
I never have deceived you
And she closed her eyes in death.

Next day her form all lifeless
Half buried on the ground
[*Line missing here*]
By some hungry hounds was found.

They took her to her parents
That all of you might see,
That's why Luella's sleeping
Beneath the willow tree.
