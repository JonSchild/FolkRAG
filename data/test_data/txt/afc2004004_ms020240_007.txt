bottom. Love is a light thing; it's [on it's] always on the top; it's in sight. 
All, all the time, it's in sight. You can tell.

TL:   Yeah, but didn't you ever love your husband and hate him
at once?

BJ:   I love my husband. I love my husband.

TL:   You hated him, too, though, huh?

BJ:   Well, I hate--

TL:   Did you get angry with him?

BJ:    Well, not -- I didn't hate 'im when I got angry with 'im; I
jes', jes' got...

TL:   You just got angry.

BJ:    ...angry with what he was doin' or sumpin' [like] of that type.
But I didn't hate him, of co'se, no-o. Goodness, no. Not only

offhand, not even a little.  I don't have them; I'm just sorry
that they made me mad; I'm sorry that they did what they did, because 
I like that person.  Ya see?  An' ah, an', ah dat's a

ya see?  If, if you cared anything about yourself.  I'd rather have
peace than to have anything else, ya see? So that's the way -- If you
not sorry, I don't care if I did make 'em mad; I don't care what
they do.  Well, you don't care, you just don't care.  Y-y-you
don't care about yourse'f.  Ya jus' don't care how -- what next
may come.  'Cause that same person may has to do you some good some
day. That same person, y-y-you know, you may have to rely upon 'im,
some day. But ya al-always try not to leave ah nobody grievious,
you know, mad wich ya.  An' not leave with mad wit' nobody.  So,
therefore, so many lil' things, ya know, you can look over, not
even think about it, pass it up.  'Cause it ain't worth while losin'
