3 {I come out tonight to
     Rock Daniel
Lord, Lord, rock Daniel.
O I can't rock,
I come out tonight

     Just rock. Just rock around. A couple
gets up and [motion?] your body, you know.
Is that what you call shouting?
     No sir, not exactly, shouting. (laughter)
No sir, not exactly, but it's just amusement,
you know, when you get to singing, you
feels good & you just moves your body.
Do they still do this here in this county?
     Yessir, at times, sometimes they
does.
Did they do it more when you were coming up?
When I was comin up, yessir! They
done more if it when I was comin up than they
do now - yessir!
