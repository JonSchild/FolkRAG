Crack Shot

One bright day at camp dix, the commanding 
officer received at bulletin requesting him to 
enter one of his solders in the annual pistol meet. 

The general, a pistol enthusiast himself, called 
his orderly, and ordered him to find the best shot 
in the regiment

The somewhat thimblebrained orgerly embarked 
upon his mission.

Four hours later the general recieved a phone 
call from the orderly. 

"I've found your man sir" he said

"Well, bring him here immediatley" ordered the 
general

I can't sir he's shot my pants off"
