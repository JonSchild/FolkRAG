And here's a great favourite on the homeward bounders. . . .
1)  We are homeward bound for London Town
And we roll the cotton down!
We are homeward bound for London Town
And we roll the cotton down!

2)  I will sing you a song for a tot of gin,
O bowse that block right down to the pin.
Lomax: What was that used for, captain. That accent?
Ras: We could use that for a topsail shantey. The ROLL the cotton
down. The shanteyman would sing the first bars you see. "We are
homeward bound for London town" and we ROLL (that's the pull)
the cotton down. . . .It could alos be used as a capstan shantay in
march time.
Lomax: How hard didthe men pull?
Ras: With every bit of strength - absolutely. As one man, you see.
They pulled with their backs, with their whole body, and I tell
you, they could do an amazing amount of hard-pulling in that way,
even frightfully heavy yards and sails. I should think an upper-topsail
yard would be in the neighborhood of sixty feet long, and 
as thick as a man's waist on the middle.
Lomax: How would they hold it in between pulls?
Ras: Well, it was six reed blocks, and there was no difficulty
in holding it. The difficulty was to haul it.
1)  Maximilian's daughter has my love,
Heave away for Santy Anna!
Maxmilian's daughter has my love,
Heave away, my lads, for Mexico!

2)  And I left my love in Laguna town. . .

3)  And when will I see Laguna's shore?
And when will I see my love once more?
