Independence, Missouri, August 3 ----- This Woman's 
Army Auxiliary Corps is just a pet idea of Eleanor Roosevelt's.
It's not such a bad idea, but why don't they put
the women who want to help in war production work where
they can do more good.  Looks like Eleanor wanted a place
to take care of some of her friends.    [*11*]
