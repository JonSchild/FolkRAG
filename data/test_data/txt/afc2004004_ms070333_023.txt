INTER-OFFICE COMMUNICATION
TO Mr. Lomax  DATE 8-8-38
SUBJECT Folklore Contacts  FROM WFYoung
If you stop at Bay City: St. Stanislaus Church, largest Polish parish in the city,
has (or had a couple of years ago) several fine musical organizations—the
Young Men's Choir and Choir Dzwon, notably. Paul Jablonski, Sports Editor of
the Bay City Times, a good friend of mine, will undoubtedly be willing to help
you meet the people who can be helpful and cooperative. From that point you
can very likely secure some introductions to Posen people who will help you.

I'll be glad to give you a letter to Jablonski
Rev. George Duquoi, Pastor
Notre Dame de la Visitation—Fr. C
