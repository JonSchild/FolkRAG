A Jap’s Bravery

I saw in the newspaper an article that told of a Jap’s bravery and his love for his country and his dictator. The article stated that a Jap survivor of a sunken battleship was swimming to shore. When he reached shore some American soldiers spotted him and ordered him to surrender. Instead of surrendering the Jap sailor had a hand grenade of which he pulled the cap and blew himself to death. This must have proved that the Japanese would rather give up their life than be captured by another country.
