visit to the inexhaustible Mrs
Minta Mangun, and where again
I had good fortune.
For tips I paid out, at
Columbia, $2[.]50; at Murrell's
Inlet, 3[.]80; at Livingston, Ala., 5[.]10;
at Mobile, $1[.]75; at Charleston
$1.20. Also at Charleston I asked
the kind gentleman and lady to
send in to you a bill for
the cost of hiring two trucks to
bring their Negroes into town.
I have filled nearly 200
records and have one more
trip in mind--Southwest
Texas to record more of
the Mexican Corridor. This
a little later when the weather
is not so terribly hot. I'm
making a tip next week
