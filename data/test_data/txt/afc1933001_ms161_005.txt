Dear Lahmer:

I have referred your letter to my father who handles all Lomax permissions with recommendations for leniency. You realize, however, that the publishers will have to pay something to use these tunes. This has always been the case since father's books were first published. I would suggest that you ask John A. Lomax for permission to use a group of five or ten songs for publication, to be paid for when the manuscript is accepted. For performance, except over the air, I don't see why not go ahead just as you please. My best regards to you and the rest of the Harris family.

Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
