Cullman, Alabama

Dear Mr. Denson:

I have written you several times in the past year
about the record I am releasing from the recordings
Miss Collins and I made at the Alabama State Sacred
Harp Convention in 1959. The record will come out
by Christmas and the company will, I am sure, arrange
for the Sacred Harp singers to buy it at less than
cost for sale in your area. In addition, two free
copies of the record will be available to the
Association.

I have a $150 advance on the release to pay to the
officer of the Alabama Sacred Harp Association and
a contract for this official to sign. Would you
please put me in touch with him.

I am crediting all songs to your publishing company.
There will be a small royalty payable on
the songs, and this credit guarantees you normal
copyright protection. Would you please inform me
to whom this payment should be made when it is due.

As the record is now in the process of publication,
I would appreciate an immediate reply.

Yours cordially,

Alan Lomax

P. S. Could you tell me Lonnie Odum's address, since
I know he wants to get hold of these records as soon
as possible.
