I used to sing

Well I looked down
Just as ?] far as I could see down
But I didn't see nobody
Look like Robert Brown (?)

That's an old _____.  Get up just a little bit now. Stop right there. I'd
get down on my knees and look down on therrigging and see whether it was
level. I'd holler again

Wo
Tell my baby not to look for me

And I'd stop again. Oh. Get up just a step. Hold it right there. Tell
them on the ____ rig.. Tell the boys I said dump it right there.

Lord over
I'll never go free

I'd tell them gee boy. I'd stop there and I'd come back and somebody else
would come up in the ditch and say what was said. "I saw Mr. Young out there
a while ago. Had a _____." I said, "You did? What they talking about?"
"[Didn] "Talking about how pretty that you ___________" He didn't [d]say nothing
about that pretty money of his." He said, "No." I said, "That's what
I want him to talk to me about. Well every body supposed to pay off."

A t that time I was working for Mr. Brown. I was his _____ out there
from __________. They called me "little man." I was doing what the big men
was doing. But I didn't have to be paid off and do no books.

AL:You told me about this payoff with Mr. Brown.

WB: He rode out there in the pit. He had a big white horse. Stallion
