a sore arm or something like that.

I knowone man, they called min Chuckaluck Same and yo can see him 
one day he'd be all broken up and bent, walking with a stick.  And tomorrow 
he'd be walking better than you can walk, see.  And the next day when 
you see him all messed up, just chuckled up, and tomorrow he'd be 
running and walking straighter you can.  He done a lot of dirt and 
they arrest him and [?] after they arrest him, when they went to hang 
him, he wasn't there to hang him.  On a street in Dallas he fell in 
a bale of hay.

A:  Do you know that to be true?

E:  That what they say -- that's what my folk-town say.  I don't 
know nothing about it but they say they know that for the fact.
