statement submitted to you that we are not asking for the establishment
of seniority rights or divisional preference at the expense
of qualification. However, where an employee is reasonably
qualified, we feel that he should be given preference in filling
a higher position in his division.

4. In asking that notice be given us whenever you intend to appoint
from outside the Service, this union is making no attempt whatever
to restrict you in the exercise of your power of appointment.
We desire merely to have an opportunity to decide whether
we wish to discuss with you or your authorized subordinates the
case of an applicant already in the Library Service. One must
not assume that this union would choose to do so in every case,
or even in a majority of cases. We wish only to have the right
and opportunity to press the claims of a deserving employee
when he is danger of being passed over.

5. We hold that you, as Librarian of Congress, are accountable to
Congress to no greater extent than the heads of executive agencies
are accountable to the President; that your adherence to
such a promotions policy as this union has proposed would qualify 
your accountability to Congress no more than the adherence 
of executive chiefs to similar policies is qualifying their accountability
to the President, or of private business and industrial
managers to their boards of directors and their stockholders;
that the principles embodied in their promotions policy
are no more dissonant with the present attitude of Congress toward
labor questions than the principles of promotions policies
already put into effect by executive agencies are dissonant with
the attitude of the President toward those questions; that, on
the contrary, the principles underlying this statement of policy
proposed by us are in strictest accord with the attitude of Congress;
and that, consequently, you would be more likely to incur
the displeasure of Congress by refusing to issue the proposed
statement than by issuing it.

6. You may offer the objection that you do not wish to commit your
successor to any definite personnel policy in regard to promotions.
We would answer that obviously a policy initiated by
a simple, informal statement from you would not be binding
necessarily upon your successor, should he wish to pursue
another policy. It could be suggested further that any Librarian
appointed by the New Deal administration would be very likely to
make such principles of promotion the cornerstone of his personnel
policy.

An additional copy of the proposed statement is enclosed.

We sincerely trust that an early response to this communication
will be forthcoming.

Adjustment Committee, Local 28
