Earl Hines -2.
Chicago.
     I helped him out every night for gratis.  Earl was a very poor
reader, who, although he sounded very good by himself, knew
that when he was playing with other musicians, he would make
mistakes; he never failed at any time to make an A Flat chord
against the G which the band should have.  Anyhow he got along very
well with Wolverine and Milenburg, but he could not seem to understand
the key of G where The Pearls was wrote.  I continued to
help Earl until he got angry with me on account of jealousy over
the fact that the people would continually applaud for me to 
play.
