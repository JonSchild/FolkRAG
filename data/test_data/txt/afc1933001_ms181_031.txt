MR. ALAN LOMAX,
ARCHIVE OF AMERICAN FOLK SONG,

DEAR MR. LOMAX,

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PROMPT
ATTENTION TO MY INQUIRY OF RECENT DATE, REGARDING THE
CHECK LIST OF FOLK SONG RECORDS. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL KEEP 
MY NAME ON FILE FOR A COPY OF THIS LIST, WHENEVER IT IS 
AVAILABLE. AS YOU MAY APPRECIATE, ONE OF THE PLEASURES OF
RECORD COLLECTING IS IN GOING OVER CATALOGS AND MAKING UP
LISTS OF MATERIAL ONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE, IF THE POCKET 
BOOK ALLOWED. FOR THAT REASON, THIS LIST OF YOURS PROMISES 
A RICH FIELD, AND I AM SURE WILL ENABLE ME TO MAKE SOME
VALUABLE ADDITIONS TO MY COLLECTION.

AS REGARDS YOUR KIND OFFER TO MAKE UP A SPECIAL LIST
FOR ME, UNDOUBTEDLY THERE ARE MANY ITEMS IN YOUR LISTS
WHICH I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OBTAIN IN COMMERCIAL RECORDINGS.
I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED, AT THE MOMENT, TO KNOW WHAT 
IS AVAILABLE IN OLD TIME BANJO RECORDINGS, BANJO 'PICKING'
AND SONGS WHICH HAVE ANY NOTABLE BANJO ACCOMPANIMENT.
I RECALL SOME VERY INTERESTING BANJO PLAYING ON ONE OF YOUR 
'SCHOOL OF THE AIR' BROADCASTS SEVERAL YEARS AGO, WHICH 
SERIES OF BROADCASTS, INCIDENTALLY, I FOLLOWED WITH MUCH
PLEASURE.

IN CLOSING, MAY I ADD MY LITTLE NOT OF APPRECIATION
FOR THE WORK WHICH YOU ARE DOING IN THE FOLK SONG FIELD,
AND I AM SURE THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER HUMBLE AMATEURS
LIKE MYSELF WHO FOLLOW YOUR EFFORTS WITH GREAT INTEREST
AND PLEASURE.

VERY SINCERELY YOURS,
CARLETON R BRACKETT
