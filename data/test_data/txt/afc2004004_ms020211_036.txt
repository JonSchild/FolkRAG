In Jesus' name, I feel fine. I was overjoyed to hear from you all. 
I just wrote you and sent you some of the write-ups of us. Yes 
sir, we sure had a find time. 

As far as Henry, I will let John tell you, for I am very sorry 
for him. But I will give you (a) hunch, it is better for him 
to stay home, as well as I love to sing with him. Let us leave 
him off for a while. We hope he will rule the grade and come 
back. 

If you don't know Emma's address, just send it in John's care; 
and Peter, too. I hope you have John's address up on the north 
end, for he doesn't stay on this end any more. I will be glad to 
get any work for that all I get, for folks won't give us a steady 
job for we are gone so much. So I am just skipping around with 
work. Sometimes I only make $5.00 a week, so get to calling. 
I got a lot to do up in (summer ?) and my house to be payed on 
that I am fixing to try to have built. And that is a secret. 
None of these (people here) know my business. 

Oh, I am 62 and some say I can start getting my security. So 
please give me a few words of how to start. I have no birth 
certificate. I was born in Smithville, Ga., February 8, 1902. 
My full name is Mary Elizabeth Smith. 

Write some. Anne, love, love, love. Dena, you know it is love, 
love, love. To you my master it is not end to love.
