' Twas the same night that poor Billy died. He said to his friends, " I'm not satisfied. There are twenty-one men I have put bullets through, And Sheriff Pat Garrett must make twenty-two."

Now, ' this is how Billy the Kid met his fate.' The bright moon was shining the hour was late.' Shot down by Pat Garrett , who once was his friend. The young outlaw's life had now come to it's end.

This is many a man with a face fine and fair Who starts out in life with a chance to be square,

But just like poor Billy he wandered astray.

And loses his life in the many same way.
