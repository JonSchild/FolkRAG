The item of $744.26 listed in the 1940-41 receipts as sale of
timber may well be noted.

Part of this timber was salvaged in logs cut ahead of levee
construction and a part of it, threatened by a caving river bank, was
sold for pulpwood.

Sale of timber will constantly appear as a future item of
Levee Board revenue, and in course of time the more than 10,000 acres
of riverside right-of-way, which is now developing a fine growth of
young cottonwood and willow, will in all probability yield a handsome
revenue.

This timber growth is being carefully guarded against depredation
by wood-cutters and as far as possible from fire.

The cost of our levee system, to the Levee Board and the
Government, since 1884 amounts to more than $40,000,000,00. It protects
against overflow from the Mississippi River around 3,500,000
acres of land of which 2,374,400 acres lie in our district.

The cost of our levee maintenance has practically always been
the most controversial subject confronting the Levee Board and has
been the subject for most general criticism.

Criticism may at times have been justified in some matter of
local operation, but any general criticism or condemnation of the
maintenance system or its operation as a whole has always come from
parties unacquainted with the levee and the many and vital problems
of flood control that constantly confront the Levee Board. To justify
to any taxpayer our administration of this matter, an inspection of
our levee and its maintenance system is all that is required.

The present annual cost to the district for maintenance
amounts to practically the minimum acre tax of 2Â¢ per acre and is
only approximately one-ninth of one per cent of the total levee cost.
This is cheap insurance indeed for the protection it safeguards
