May 22 - must begin this diary in
the middle so as to keep it up --
then never let it stray
   Tonight am with the Landry 
family at the Societie des Oeuvres
Vives - the French who still visit
the colonies they are about to lose
forever.  The Landrys have made a
film.  He is a thick man with a
red apoplectic face who keeps saying
he's an artist & doesn't care about
money which he cares for nothing
else.  His wife is a movie star 
he fucked.  His daughter is dark
& [u?] -- and 20 & I want her.
   I'm leading a Parisian life
whenever I can manage it - the
fine edge & the misery are 
having me in the same year.
