He lived only thirty-one years, but many of the songs he wrote
at sixteen are in ???? singer's repertoire. This symphony was not
interrupted by Schubert's death; the two movements available were
written long before his death and were simply laid aside, the third
movement going no further than sketches. Several attempts have been
made to "finish" the symphony, but it would be a fair assumption that
a composer with the necessary ability would be deterred by the futility 
of speaking in another's idiom. Schubert was much more the lyricist 
than the symphonist -- and this is more than evident in this work. 

The first movement (allegro moderato) opens with a sombre subject
on the celli and basses, almost immediately there follows a fluttering
figure for violins which becomes the accompaniment to a lovely melody
in the oboe and clarinet. A few sharp chords in the horns and bassoons
and there is introduced what has been called the loveliest lyric theme in
symphonic literature. This theme will be recognized as the tune of "You
Are My Song of Love". After restarting these themes, the development
section starts towards the end of the first face, and is built mostly
on syncopated chords accompanying the second theme. The restatement at
the middle of the second face omits the sombre opening subject, but
the doda (conclusion) is built entirely on that material.

The second movement (andante con moto) has two long sections, the
second being a repetition of the first. The first theme is for the
strings with a descending bass pizzicato. Towards the middle of the
second face there is introduced the second theme for woodwinds with
syncopated chords in the strings. The second section reporting these
two themes begins soon after the beginning of the fourth face.
