member of the Missionary Baptist Church?
BJ:    Well, when I was very small, I, well, I wasn't very small,
I was about eighteen years old.
AL:    About 18?
BJ:     Um-hum.  An' I, I felt like I was converted.  An' I felt like 
I was converted. I thought I was converted.
AL:     Well, what happened?
BJ:      You see, there's many peoples that way today.  They think
they converted, ya see?   An' so I did, I prayed an' I feel like that
I'd made a change an' from what, in some instances, but I didn't
strong enough;  I didn' have no help to hold up, to continue.  The
strong fact about it, I wasn't converted; I's jus' goin' to be
converted.
AL:      Did you have an experience at first?
BJ:       [Well, in playin' -- in playin' -- sure I had a wonderful, you know], I was prayin'...An' sure, 
an' prayin', well, sure;  I had a wonderful experience, you know.
Prayin', quite natchully, I meant what I was doin', you know, as
far as I knew.  An' ah...
AL:       Did you go out somewhere by yourself...?
BJ:        Oh, yeah. I had, I had my own praying ground, of course,
back home we had a praying ground.  When I was small, I'd come up
jus' like the old people did, go out and had your praying ground
off in the woods and pray.
AL:        Was there any special place that you would...?
BJ:         Yeah, I had, sure,  one special place,/[back up] in the woods. I'd
hide myself.down back out house and I prayed.   And truly I did.
And I, and I meant it, every bit of it.
AL:         Did you pray every day? 
BJ:         Oh, yeah.  Lawdy, 'most every day.  Sometimes twice a day.
