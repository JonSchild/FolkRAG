Dear Mr. Forman:
Thank you very much for your kind
letter of June 1. Were it not for Mr.
Lomax's scheduled performance at the
White House on June 8, he would probably
make the trip immediately. As it is, he
will visit you soon thereafter. I shall
ask him to communicate with you regarding
this as soon as he arrives in Washington.
Permit me to thank you for your kind
offer to cooperate with us in this matter.
Very sincerely yours,
Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
