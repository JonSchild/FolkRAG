BJ TAPE 27, p. 45

     You know when you call up -- Solomon there, was -- that was
in the Bible.  They calls up Solomon, I think it was, an' ah, an'
that man told 'im, "Tomorra you shall --- you'll be right where I'm
at."  An' the next day he was dead, too.  'Cause he got no business
worryin' them people.  In, in, in they grave.  But that was
the wishcraft (witchcraft).  You remember you remember readin' [about] it in the
Bible, wishcraft.
AL:  Was this something special in your family?
BJ:  That's right.  An' we, we always...
AL:  That other families around you in Dawson didn't have?
BJ:  A lot of 'em [that] didn' have, an' that, you know, seein' eye, spirit,
talk.  A lot of 'em didn't.  A lot of 'em did[n't] not have it.
But Paw [had] got it an' Paw an' them, they, they rough with it.  They
got it bad.  An' it don't worry 'em, ya know?  Don't worry me --
But it don't worry Mama, home, now.  Don't worry 'er a bit.  Not 
spirit.  But, my God, it kinda shake me a lil' bit.  When I makes
up my mind, when I get in a place an' I gotta be there, then I just make
up my mind what that is, all right. But I got to make up, first
make up my mind.  If I have a shakey mind an' don' wanna be
there (?), I'm gone.  Ha,ha, ha!  If I make up my mind, I can
beat it.
AL:  There are some places where there are more of them than
other places?
BJ:  Stir-stirrin' more, ya mean.  They ain't no more, I don't 
b'lieve, in the world, but that's right.  They're stirrin' more,
perhaps there.
TL: What happens when they're stirring?  Why do they do that?
BJ:  They has ta do it.  The world full a spirits.  Ya know?
The world been buried over three times, they tell me in 1914.
