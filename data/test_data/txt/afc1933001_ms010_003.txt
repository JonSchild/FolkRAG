THE LAST ROUND-UP

I’m headin’ for the Last Round-up
Gonna saddle old Paint for the last time and ride
So long, old pal, it’s time your tears were dried
I’m headin’ for the Last Round-up
Git along, little*dogie, git along, git along,
git along, little dogie, git along,
Git along, little dogie, git along, git along, 
git along little dogie, git along
I’m headin’ for the Last Round-up
To the far away ranch of the Boss in the sky
Where the strays are counted and branded, there go I
I’m headin’ for the Last Round-up.

I’m headin’ for the Last Round-up
There’ll be Buffalo Bill with his long snow white hair
There’lol be old Kit Carson and Custer waiting there
A-ridin’ in the Last Round-up
Git along, little dogie, git along, git along, 
git along, little dogie, git along
Git along, little dogie, git along, git along
git along little dogie, git along
I’m headin’ for the Last Round-up
Gonna follow the trail to the range that’s always green
Where the water’s plenty and the calves are never lean
I’m headin’ for the Last Round-up.

* “dogie* - a young calf - a yearling that has not wintered well.
