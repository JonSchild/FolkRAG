JOHN STEALS HOGS
My maw had a man named John and he had a lot of hogs. My maw said,"They're
missing hogs the other night. The last one I had [???] missed the hog."
She said "John, I believe you're stealing my hogs." "Oh, no," says,
"Oh, no," says, "Massa, I ain't stealin your hogs." Say, "The other 
night just took [hime] me off and take me a little show." So he first show
he grabbed him old Massa Higgins, caught him at the gate and rang him
show out. So Old Massa told him, "You know, John, it ain't gonna make 
a damn bit of good stealing all those hogs. You can't eat up all of 
these." So Old Massa  mad a[?]ld John go to the house and so he went
to the house. And told his cook to cook him up a pan of corn bread.
So he says, "Cook, cook up a pan of corn bread." And he put the hog
in an old pot, a pot that used for washing, a washpot. P t him down.
The first thing Old John grabbed was his head and he shook, shook the
middle of his head after he had it, he taked him in themiddle just
like a flapjack and he tooked up a ham and he knocked the gristles
off of them and I heard him turn tham and say, "Captain, (
rest unclear) I'll kill you." (Laughter). 
Knocked the girstles off the end of them and turned I hear him, 
"Captain, Captain, you didn't know enough to kill me." (Laughter)
