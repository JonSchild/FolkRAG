up one of these days before
long, I hope.  It's pretty hard
for me to get away from
my new job - and not best 
either for a while.
   Just this moment a
man came in with my salary
check for the past 15 days.  We
get paid twice every month
So I'll send you a Dollar
because I love you and treasure
you as my partner.
Father
