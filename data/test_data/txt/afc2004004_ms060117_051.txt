Dear Allan,
I am knee deep in the Independence 
Celebrations Exhibition
on Carnival, Calypso & S/Band.  So 
much so that I am going to the 
end of the month here.
I have mailed you two 
sets of contracts (B/Chisensee included)
The Diego Martin "johnnies" 
are "too smart" to sign (readily) 
a contract as good as yours. Fools!
I understand from Hill You 
are going to be back at Jamaica 
for one (1) month.   You'll find the 
contracts there consigned to Dr. Sherlock.  
Yours you should get before you leave 
NY for the Caribbean.
Nothing about release yet.   The 
Premier's Office (Sanders X and ) is still 
making up their minds.  
You did not say anything further.
