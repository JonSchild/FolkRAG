                                                               THE BOLD PRISONER

Pitts, Printer, Wholesale Toy and Marble ware-house, 6,
Great St, Andrew street 7 dials

As I was walking from my recreation,
   Across the green meadows one morning in May
There I heard two brothers a talking,
   And I listened awhile to what they did say.

Says one to the other I have a brother
   In prison so strong confined is he
But if I had forty brave fellows like myself
   We soon would set the bold prisoner free.

Ten of them should hold our horses head,
   Ten at the prison door should be,
And ten should guard the prison all round,
   While the rest should set the bold prisoner free.

Dicky broke locks and Dicky broke bolts,
   And Dicky made all before him to flee,
And Dicky took Arthur all up in his arms
   And carried him off most manfully.

Dicky looked over his left shoulder
   You little do think what I do see,
Here comes the bold sheriff of bonny down dale
   And a hundred bold traps in company.

O stop O stop the sheriff he cries,
   O stop O stop whosoever you be
Only give us the irons from off his legs
   And you may have the bold prisoner free.

O no, O no you are vastly mistaken
   O no O no that never can be,
The irons will serve to shoe our horses
   For we have a farrier in our company.

O I will leave houses and I will leave lands,
   I will leave wives and children three,
But before I'd leave my own dearest brother
   I sooner would die under yonder green tree.

To dancing to dancing they went
   To dancing they went most merrily
"Twas the very best dance that ever they had,
   Because they had set the bold prisoner free.
