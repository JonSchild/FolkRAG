1. The A.C.M.Co. is having a difficult time in getting experienced 
help to work in the mines.  Things look pretty bad, a couple of the mines 
may have to close down.   Foremen in the mines say too many are being 
drafted--not enough deferments and so many have left for better jobs in 
Idaho and on the coast.  (Hotel Manager)   [*Helena, Montana  Aug [3]4  (12)*]
