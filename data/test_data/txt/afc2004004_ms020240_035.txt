jus' as if they do it often.  Now, that's really nasty down there
with some of 'em.  If they don't know ya. Ya know, jus' 'cause they
doin' sumpin' fer, fer it, sho' enough.  Make ya real tired.
But if I know 'em, buddy, an' I'm a-waitin' on, I
call the man; tell him, say, "I wanna git some so-an'-so.  You,
you talk on.  Let him let me have so-an'-so."  If I know 'em, I
sure will!  You know, they don't pay me no mind 'cause they say
I ain't got good sense, so it's good.  Huh!  Ha, ha, ha!  It's
good.  I just ain't got it, but I want -- if I know 'em, you
know?  An' just like, like you talkin' about sumpin', I say, "All
right, you can talk on, but let 'im let me have sech-an'-sech."
See, I know ya, see?  I can speak to ya.  But if I know I don't
know ya, ya know, I don't say nothin' to 'em.  They just -- I
see them, turn their nose.
An' sometime I walk by an' high shoulder, you know.  Jus'
like somebody walk by me or somebody else, an' some, plen'y a
colored folks there, an' speak an' s-- you know, speak to Fatty
or me or anybody, "How do ya do?"  An' 'nother walkin' behind there,
them high shoulder ones, an' do like that.  That tickles me!  Great
goodness.  That tickels me -- Know why it tickles me?  ['Cause] I say, "You
ain't nothin' but big, proud sack a dirt!"  That's all you is.  You
goin' ta dirt jus' like I am.  Nothin' to ya but dirt!  Big, ol',
proud bag a dirt.  Ha, ha!  Ain't that -- !  That tickles me all --
It's just cute how you so big, nice, an' bushy bag a dirt.  Just...
turn this way to keep from me from speakin' or turn this way...Lawd
that gits over me;  I jus' laugh to myself.  But they ain't so many
but they does it.  An' that just gits...Now that don't make me mad,
a bit.
