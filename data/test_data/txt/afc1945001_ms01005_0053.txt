Radio DEBUNK, June 18th: "American
doughboys in Iceland staged a short
but heated battle with British
soldiers there but came out on top.
Our boys had one casualty, whereas the
Limeys suffered two dead and three
wounded. The British soldiers had
called our soldiers cowards for not
not starting an offensive."
At the present time we cannot be sure of just what the origins of our
rumors may be. The parallelism between domestic rumors and Axis propaganda
does not necessarily mean that local rumors are Axis inspired. In some cases
the rumors take a very different trend. For example, the Axis tries to emphasize
through plugging rationing that we have very little in the way of
necessary supplies; whereas in this field the rumors seem to be in large
part of the wishful sort of exaggerating the supplies we do have.
Whatever the original source of rumors may be, we do know that rumors
are working for the Axis. People spread rumors and believe them. According
to the interviewers in the intensive study, over seventy percent of the rumors
they collected were believed.
Have you heard that the government is going to take all the private
automobiles from 1939 on? I guess they'll pay you something for
them, but we might as well get what pleasure we can from ours now.
We haven't stopped driving a bit, and we're not going to. We're
driving more if anything." (Housewife, Birmingham, Ala. 8-15-42)
The Axis programs on Radio DEBUNK seem to be designed to plant and promulgate
rumors. There seems to be evidence of rumor campaigns among some of the foreign
language groups, and at least one of the domestic groups that were isolationist
before Pearl Harbor are still actively engaged in the development of rumor campaigns.
