Dear Mr Lomax

I expect to be in St Louis
from July 25 to the middle of
August and if you are near
there I would like to spend
a day or two with you. 

Here is your telegram just now
arrived Celluloid discs are in
second shipment. Will send two stylus
for cutting metal by air mail.
A rough stylus would account for
high scratch level. Wiring diagram
also being forwarded in a later letter
Be sure to send me sample of your
first recordings.
