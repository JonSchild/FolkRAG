     "I'm just back from Denver and other places in 
Colorado - - and all over it seems there is a lot of 
confusion about all this defense work. You know the 
people that do the work aren't getting paid - -  and the 
paid directors sit back ans supervise. Look at all the 
OCD work that is being done by local business men - - yet 
there are plenty of paid directors doing nothing. The 
same thing is true for USO - -  the people are doing all of 
the work and the USO directors get paid for doing the job."
