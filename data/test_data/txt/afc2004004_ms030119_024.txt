The Bible says, The bottom rail will come to the top. 
The colored pusson that's been undah the white people, aftah while, 
they'll be the top. Thass what the Bible said. In Matthew. Mmm-hmm. 
Jesus said the time would come when people would kill ye an think they done right. Yeah.
Everybody will be one color. If they're not one color, 
they'll be one color anyhow. Mean to say, Everybody will have their 
equal share. Everybody will be recognized as one people. An one 
language. Won't be no dyin.  Live forever. All murders will be done 
away with.
(That would be a very beautiful state of affairs, wouldn't it?)
(His preaching voice) OH YES! Lot of people 
lookin to go to Heaven, don't know where Heaven's at.
(Where do you think Heaven is?)
I don't have to tell you where I think it is; I'm gon 
tell you where I know it is. Where the Bible said. It's gon be right
heah. On this earth. This earth'll be burnt out an anothah earth will 
take its place. It'll be a holy state. A holy place.
(Will there be trees and birds?)
The Bible said there will be trees, and every leaf on 
the tree will be good for the healin of a nation. They'll bear twelve 
mantles of fruit every mont, an then the leaves will be good for the 
healin of the the nations. Won't be no doctors. The doctors'll be gone 
out of existence. No ondertaker.  Cause won't nobody have to die. 
No confusion. Everybody be in love.  Peaceful world.
But somebody have to die before that happen. Somebody 
have to die.  The world, the Bible says, aftah all the sinnahs is 
burnt up into ashes, then we Christians will be walkin round heah on 
the earth wid the ashes of the sinnahs.
