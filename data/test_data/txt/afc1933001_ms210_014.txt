This reminds me that I think the B.B.C. certainly
gyped you when they paid you what they did. They are a
very wealthy corporation and you gave the best fruits of
your labor and experience of the last 4 or 5 years
which they could have got from no other person. If they
come back for more for heaven's sake work through an
agent.

To matters of business. Mr. Blossom, assistant
reference librarian here, wants to propose you for
emembership in the Cosmos Club in Washington. Good
food, reasonable hotel rates and the most distinguished
authorities on anything you like in and out of Washington
as members. I will tack on note about costs of membership 
on end of this letter when I sign it.

Frank had not sent your books because you had
not given him very definite addresses. They went into
the mall Saturday, however.

I will work on the Cole publishing matter when
I come back from seeing Bess and let you know, and
will also let you know what Colonel Beauvais of the
Copyright Office thinks about your chances. His advice
is naturally the best you can get.

Your generous offer of a year in the woods or
in college are naturally tempting and I will hold them
in reserve. I think, however, I can get 6 perhaps 9
months of college on my own and I will write you about
this soon a little more definitely. In the meantime
give my love to Deanie and Alice and remember me,
 
Your loyal partner,

Alan

P.S. So many people have asked about you and sent their
regards on the trip it would take another letter merely
listing them all. The Crosses (Ellen is happily 
engaged) and Archer Taylor are merely typical of the
group. Sanburg was away.
