she opened the door, there was this stuff on the stove.  He
walked in there ta to -- ta t-t, ta kick it off the fire.  An'
him an' her wrapped before they got to the fire.  An', boy,
they wrapped!  I mean they fowght!  For a while, ya hear?
An' he, an' him, an', an' when, when they come an' got 'im,
he was on his knees.   An' today, if he's livin', that finger's
chewed up!  She jus' chewed it up!  He had to go down.  It's
on this hand.  I mean the lef' hand, 'cause, ya see, that's

damn one of 'em gonna be arrested an' he'll be in the hospital."
