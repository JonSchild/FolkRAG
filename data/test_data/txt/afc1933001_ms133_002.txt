My dear Mr. Lomax:
I have misplaced your letter about
the cowboy songs, and am answering it from memory. 
I want to thank you for helping me to identify 
the songs, and to let you know that if I an
get the text and tune of the River song I shall
surely send it to you. I have heard from Teddy Blue
again and he says he remembers most of it (he wasn't 
quite sober the last time he tried) and it has just
occured to me that another source is Ab Blocker
down in Texas, because I know they used to sing it
in the Blocker outfits.

I never did this before, and it's fun. 

If you are keeping "Forty Years a Cowpuncher"
in your files, you might like to add the following
notes, from Teddy Blue. "I composed it in '84 on 
the fall roundup on Powder River. It was sung all over
the Montana range by me and others, but I don't think 
it ever got to Texas." The SH (not ST) cow outfit,
he explains, was Scott and Hanks on Powder River.
The tune, he says was "Jerry go oil the car." 
(In '84?????? Can you explain that one?)

About the "Ogallalla song," the one you referred 
to as the river song, he says: "The Ogallalla was not 
really a song, just composed as the trail ran north by 
men singing on night guard. I made it up from 
Ogallalla to the mouth of the Musselshell in '84, and 
as that was the last year for the old Texas trail 
through Kansas I guess it died out."

He complains, rather bitterly, that the 
cowboy songs of the radio and even of the song books 
are "all fixed up, not as we used to sing them at all." 
I am thinking how well this agrees with your fathers 
comment in his introduction to his [*first*] collection; 
I think he resents the smoothing and polishing just 
as much as Teddy Blue.
Sincerely yours,
Helena Smith
