who come here from Europe to visit Louisiana and to find a

find French speaking cowboys in pickup trucks.  They,

expecting to find.  They're expecting to find squares and 
churches and statues -- and they find cowboys on horseback
and in a place where horses are, are still valued for speed
and stamina and not just as nostalgia.  The, the prairies in
fact were where the, where, where Cajun music best came
together because of its isolation.

ANCELET  Had cattle drives to feed New
Orleans coming right across the praries and, and going
through [Abiville] and along the [Vermillion] up to
Lafayette and cutting across the, the [Chapilay] basin
however they could.

ANCELET  Sure.
