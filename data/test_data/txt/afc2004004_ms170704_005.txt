Keiler Laddie (fragment)

For see ye not those hills & dales
The sun shines on sie brawly
They are mine and shall be thine
Gin ye leave her keiler laddie
Laddie o laddie
Gin ye leave yer keiler laddie

O would you fancy one that's black
And you so fair & gowdy
Or fancy you of a higher degree
Than follow a keiler laddie.

Her father dear then rowed and swear
Tho he be black, he's bonny
She's mair delight in him I fear 
Than you with all your money

O you shall gang in gay attire
We'll bush [?] it up so gawdy
And yent [?] away at every hand
Gin you leave your keiler laddie. (Dey) [??]
