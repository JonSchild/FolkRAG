they're not mated. I heah lots of folks talkin bout a woman bein bad. You're not bad. You just haven't got where your stoppin place is at. See, when a pusson git where their stoppin place is at, they'll stop. Cause they'll have what it take to give em enough. Some people are longer winded than other folks. Takes more to do some people than it do othahs. There's some that don't take but jes a lil bit of sumpin to satisfy them. Now you take a man, or a woman, that's been havin the hang of the worl, you understan, you know what I mean, the fashions of the worl.  Or you take a man that's never been used to but one woman, jes hangin round, you understan, keepin hissef proper for jest one thang, you understan. He meet a worly woman, he got mo to do fur that worly woman than he do fur that woman how nevah had knowed nothin bout the experience of the worly fashion. You see? It take mo to keep that woman. You take a woman, you understan, who don't know anythang mo than she jes one man's woman, you understan, an a man had been used to everything. . .? She'll kill huhsef tryin to satisfy him. She ain't gon satisfy. Yet she's a good woman. For somebody else. But not fur him. . . Thass the reason I say, A pusson ought nevah to start runnin round aftah the thangs of the worl, cause if you evah git the taste of the things of the worl, you'll nevah be satisfied no mo till you run to yo end. An you're liable to be might-near dead when you git to your end.

You take a man that love to have a good time sometimes. Run out among a bunch of prostitutes an all stuff like that. An what I call the glory, when a man marries an come to be the father of chilren, you not able to do that, an you soon go out. Quick.
