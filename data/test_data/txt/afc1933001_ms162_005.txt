Jo with laughter on his lips,
Magic at his fingertips.
When Jo fiddled up a tune
Hounds went baying at the moon,
Moon fell splintered through the pines,
Pink buds woke on wild grape vines --
Small wonder any girl should be
Blinded by that sorcery.

Gone again, skip to ma loo,
Gone again, skip to ma loo,
Gone again, skip to ma loo,
Skip to ma loon, my darling!

Sixty acres of plowed land
and a new gold marriage band;
But Jo tuned a witching air,
Witched her long away from there,
Lou, without one backward look,
Followed down the road he took.

Don't want none o' your weevily wheat,
Don't want none o' your barley,
Don't want none o' your blarney sweet,
But I'll take a kiss for Charley!

Many's the lass whose red-lipped smile
Has begged Sid's love a little while,
and many the star-spilled night he's known
With lying tongue and breast of stone;
But love is brief and years are long
To hate a gypsy fiddle song.

Now lost in his befuddled mind
Are two that he once meant to find;
For Old Sid's only need is bread --
The grave will hide a dream that's dead.
Yet, mumbling games they used to play
For coin to ease him on his way,
His heart holds beauty unforgot
In kiss of honeyed apricot!
