With his hands and his feet bound down likewise,
And with a bloody gavin-hook I killed him,
Because I wouldn't hear his cries.

Singing rhymes:
Green gavel, green gavel, the grass is so green.
     The fairest young damsel that ever was seen.
     We washed her in milk and we dressed her in silk,
     We wrote down her name with a glass pen and ink.

Sally go round the moon,

We have come to take your town - We are the Romans.
We have come to take your town - For we are the Roman soldiers.

No, you'll never take our town - We are the British.
No, you'll never take our town for we are the British soldiers.

Then we've come to take your Queen. . . . . .
No, you'll never take our Queen. . . . . . .

touching the wall. In the 2nd verse you take one of the children,
the Queen. . .

O I lost it on Calvary's hill,
     And it rolled and it rolled until it rolled out of sight.
I was happy that night when I lost it on Calvary's hill.
