you know of any World's Fair officials (yourself
included) in need of a crack secretary, just
whistle for me and I'll take the next plane east.

Have you assumed yet your role of consultant-
in-chief for the Fair's folk-lore? And is it the
exciting head-ache you rather expected it to be?
And what of our friend, Jelly-Roll (by the way, I 
understand he's mentioned in an article on jazz i
this month's Esquire) were his recordings successful
and is he still dictation those wonderfully impossible
stories of his?

With all these questions I ask of you, you'll
really feel like a cad and a bounder if you don't
answer my letter, won't you?

Yours -- with tongue in cheek,
Mildred Stocker
