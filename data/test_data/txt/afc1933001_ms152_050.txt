those School of the air
programs.  Have you been
on them long?  And do
 you expect to continue on
the program?  And will
you ever use any of my
songs?  I hope if you do
you will let me know
for I wont miss them

your songs.  I am taking a
chance on you getting this.

will reach you.  She works
for the station but never

you and your wife
also.  my regards to
both of you.
