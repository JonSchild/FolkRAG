Dear Alan:

With regard to the Boogie-Woogie 
dubbings - I hate to see such a nice 
fat order leave our jurisdiction.  It 
will do so much good in our revolving 
fund when and if!  I may be optimistic 
but I suggest that we wait a month to 
see what happens.

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
