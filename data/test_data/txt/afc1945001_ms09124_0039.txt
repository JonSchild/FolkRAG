One of the most ignorant things
I ever heard was to hear people sit around
talking about the war situation when
they really don't know what they are
talking about. They sit around in groups
like fifth columnist taking about us
sending food to the other countries when
we don't have enough for ourselves,
that is not true we have been so use
to being overfed that it seems impossible,
but we have got to get use to
it sooner or later so why not now before
it seems more impossible than
ever. [*Folder 124*]
