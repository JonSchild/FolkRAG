War Bonds and Stamps
[*A*]
The more war Bonds and Stamps
people buy the faster we can win this
war.  The more tanks, guns, airplanes
and a lot of other things that we need
can be made.  There is a new ship
being build called The U. S. S. Chicago
and the money in bonds has to be
raised in Chicago only so that this 
ship can be build to advenge the other ship
Chicago that was sunk  by the
Japenese. This ship will be bigger
and better then the last one.  So
everyone should buy as many
War Bonds and Stamps as possible.
