Mr. L.A. Lomax,
7456 San Benito Way,
Dallas, Texas.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

     I am enclosing a copy of the program of our Western Folklore [H ? ? ? addresses for you]
Conference.  I hope that it looks good to you, and that you will not feel
that we have burdened you too much.  Many have spoken with pleasure of the
prospect of getting to meet you and to hear you talk of your experiences.
We want the members of the staff as well as others who come out for the con-
ference to have a good time and to develop enthusiasm for carrying on folk-
lore study in the West.

     Mrs. Davidson and I would be very glad to have you stay at our home,
which is just across the street from the campus, while you are here for the
conference.  If Mrs. Lomax can come with you, we would enjoy having her be
with us also.  Everything will be quite informal, but enjoyable, I trust.  If
you will let us know when you expect to arrive, we will try to corral a fatted
maverick.  If it be hot weather, we will even put it on ice for you.

     Everything seems to be coming along quite well with us, even though
the rest of the world is in an unusually bad way.  Our summer school promises
to be a large one; we expect a decrease for next autumn, however.

                                                           Sincerely yours,

                                                                 [Signature]
                                                                       L.J. Davidson.
