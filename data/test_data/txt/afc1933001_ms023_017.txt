Gentlemen:

Replying to your inquiry of Nov. 27th. 1934 with reference to ballards current and popular among prisoners, wish to advise that we have made a survey of the ballards commonly heard around this institution but cannot find anything original, however we will still be on the lookout and if we are successful in finding anything will gladly pass it along to you.

Your very truly,

R R Penn

R.R.Penn
Superintendent.
