to delight and to interest the spectators: the Angel, Lucifer,
Gils, the only woman in the play, her lazy spouse Bartolo, and
of course, the Hermit who keeps them all in good humour.

In spite of all its blemishes, the spirit in which this
voluntary Christmas celebration is given makes it worthy of
preservation. Today, as yesterday, actors and audience are one
in their profession of faith, expressed by a survival of a
Medieval drama.

"Las Posadas commemorating the journey of Joseph and
Mary to Bethlehem is a Christmas celebration of Old MExico
frequently seen in San Antonio.
The Posadas begin nine days before Christmas. Hostesses
are chosen for each evening. With lighted tapers the guests
go from room to room, knocking at doors which will not open.
Finally they are admitted. They stand before the nacimento
sing Christmas carols, and recite short prayers. The rest of
the evening is spent in merry making. Breaking a pinata is
always a feature of Las Posadas.

The pinata a decorated earthen jar, filled with sweetmeats,
flowers, confetti, or presents for the guests, is placed where
the guests may strike at it.
Blindfolded, one after another try to break the pinata until
it is broken, and its contents scattered in every direction.
The patios of the houses in mexico lend themselves admirably
for this sort of entertainment. In San Antonio, the pinata is
usually broken on the porch or on the lawn."
