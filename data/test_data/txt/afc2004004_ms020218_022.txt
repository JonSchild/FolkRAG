BJ R.   3, P. [18] 20
[*5*]

Said, "She better not get sick." Mama was a hard man. So then,
Mama jus' let me lay quiet in the bed -- cover me up, you know,
good. An' [jus'] lay quiet in the bed. An' she went out an' she got some
double tansy. You know, tha's tan -- what they call tansy;
I got some in my yard. The single tansy's will  destroy
chilrun; double tansy make you whole. She went out an' got
some double tansy an' made some double tansy tea. An' gi'
it to me. An' I laid in that bed there, quiet, an' still.
An' so, I didn't know what it was an' then I heard her sayin',
"She tryin' to destroy that baby." She tol' Mama all about
it out there, you see. An' Mama blessed out Cozza; was cussin'
about Cozza. "Cozza been a grown man; with two chilrun," you
see? Then tryin' to destroy it. An' then, tha's how I know
about Cozza. They ain' never said anythin' to me; ain' never 
said anything yet. It's (the white farm up there. Since)
I got a big chile. The chile was up, around, playin' in the 
field. 'posed to work for him. But he ain't never said
anythin' to me. Ah, ha, light, but that what he was doin' then.
     An' so, ah, that's where I learnt that. Then I went
out in that garden, an' I got up in that bed, an' [next day] I
stay up -- the next day, from a Thursday, at leas', when I got
[went] out there -- in that garden. An' asked God to let
nothin' do no harm. An' in that prayin' [the] a word comin' out
of my mouth was healin'  my chile. You see, we didn't know
nothing' about that; we didn' know nothin' about that word.
it was many years past, you know after that, I got grown and you know learnin'
the Bible and learnin' the holiness an' things an' (yet I see
in the Bible  ?) said, "God'll heal ya; God'll heal ya' for 
your wounds." So it hit, bam! You see? I 'member me sayin'
that word. You see that! And [so it] sumpin' hit me jus' as good as
that. I say that word an' then never had no heard it, in the 
Bible, but God have healed 'er. An' you know, she's up in her
forty some odd years old, no trouble with sickness, an' no --
her eyes -- that come from that [those] dose a' med'cin she gave me,
ya know; her eyes was weak. So I tell you I see the sign?
That's where it started at, ya see. In the head, ya see? 
[*God's punishment*]
She was already made. Why, hit'd a-kilt me. An' destroyed 
her, too. An' so the doctor said it's some kind of med'cin I took.
