Dear Lomax,
Very many thanks for your
delightful radio broadcast.  I heard
Scotland sing-" on Dec. 4th."
I am still in Aberdeenshire, but
in the Hebrides in spirit, so looked
forward to your broadcast and
truly I wasn't disappointed.
So you have been up this way collect-
ing ballads!  You could have called
at this farmhouse if you were any-
where near here, maybe you'll be up
this way again before the end of Spring
if so give us a call.
Thank you so much for mentioning
honorable mention at that "the meal
and ale,"  I was so pleased to your voice
the old custom is still in vogue of
some of faomo about here.
Wishing you a bright & merry Xmas, and 
a prosperous & happy new year.
Yours sincerely
Rachel Mackleod
