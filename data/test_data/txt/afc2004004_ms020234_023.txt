'e'd go on.   He'd go...an' so...He'd do that, every...I don't
care when he did it.   Don't care how he did it.  Brother, sister,
I don't care who's standin' there.   So that was his job.  He would
[kiss,] kiss me on, on the cheek an' go on.
         He say ya never know [when] wheth' ya gonna git back home or not.  Or
whether ya gonna find a person back home.  Tha's his  --  that was
his idea.   You never know...what's gonna happen.  An'  so...That's
true, too.  Um-hum.  Never know.  So that was his mind; that was 
his idea.  
         So in that, whatsoever you got  --  If you got sumpin' to do,
go on do it.  Ya know?   If ya ain't got to do it an' don', an'
ain't care about doin' it, [then] they ain't no use a pickin' it up.
That's all.   See, if you don't care about doin' it, ain't 
worryin' about doin' it.   Like I see a lot a ladies an' lot a 
womens m-my age, an' some older'n me, they jus' got to [look after] -- well,
that's they motto [an'] if that's they mind, an' they ain't no use in
me or nobody else gittin' angry with 'em about it.  That they got to have
a husband.   See?  They got to have one.  They are,  they,  well,
it's a mystery to ya. (?)   An' they w-wants to do it.  An' [some of 'em]
no use a gittin' angry with 'em about it.   An' a lot a folks
say, "Oh, that ol' woman oughta be ashame' a herself;  she don't
want no husband."   If  --  She may want one.  I ain't gonna say
she don't;  I don't know 'er mind.   But, an' den  --
        Co'se I say that, ah, someone tell me,  I [say] tell 'em, I say,  "I ain't got
to have no husband."
        "I don't see why, how come!   Ah, any woman  got...!"
        I say, "Any woman ain't got to have no husban'. "  Said,
Some of 'em won' even, won' even marry.   They go be schoolteachers
an' go on 'bout their business;  won' even worry 'bout no husban',
