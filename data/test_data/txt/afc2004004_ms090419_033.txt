M.C. Orr. . .

morning , taking my morning stroll, met two nice looking young
ladies, all powdered up in flour and the sun had begin shining
hot and begod if they didn't have biscuits hanging under their
chins.

I was over to see my girl last night. While I was over there,
we played several games. The first game [was] we played--"Heavy,
heavy hang over my head. " A boy got up and hung a chair over
my head. I didn't play that game no more. But the second and
third game was that good old kissing game. It went like this--
"Kiss an unmarried lady, cost five dollars. Kiss a married lady,
cost two and a half. " it was some old [lady] maid up there, selling
um three for a dime--I bought worth 'leven dollars and six
bits worth. . . You people don't know the good in kissing old maids
like I do. They ain't got no teeth and every time you kiss one,
you get a good old gum drop. My paw is a preachers. One of the
biggest preachers in the state. I remember the day behind yesterday
my pay was sitting on the porch, reading the Bible. He says,
"Sin, go in the back yard and get the dog and gun and let's go to
hunting." I said, "Paw, today's Sunday. You ought to be somewhere
preaching.  "  He said, Go on and go what I told you."  I went 
on out on the back yard and shouldered the dog and whistled for the
gun and go [went] on down in the woods. Get down there and the dog
get in behind sumpin. Run the sumpin way off cross the woods and run
it up a tree.  Me and paw got over there and so many leaves up
the tree we couldn't see up there and so paw told me, "Go up there
and see what it is. " I says, "Paw, bein' you just a little older
than I am, you go up there. " Paw climbs up the tree and gets
on a rotten limb . Down come paw and down come t e limb and down
