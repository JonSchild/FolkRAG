Dear Mr. Spinaker:  When Alan and
I first started collecting folk tunes
we rented a large Edison cylinder
 recording machine.  We used it on
a long trip through Texas and Louisiana.
At Baton Rouge Mr. Engal's first
electric machine met us, and we set
it up in the shops of the State
University.  I forgot how many
of those cylinders are on deposit
with you, though I know they
contain a lot of interesting stuff.
Moreover, they are yet my property.
What shall we do about
it?  I'd like much to know
what those cylinders contain.  For
one thing I wish to mention
them in The Adventures of a Ballad Hunter.
Yours,
John A. Lomax
