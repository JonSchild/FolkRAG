Dear Father:

For the last time, your letters are not annoying, unwelcome,
unpleasant,, nor any other 'un', except for one thing. They
continually put me in a position of apologizing for faults of 
omission which I really can't help. I wish I could write you as
often as you do me, since I can't physically, consider that I 
do the best that I can.

1. The sermons and other miscellaneous prose material are
being gathered together for you. Elmo Newcomer's tunes are being
searched. This material you will find enclosed. Tomorrow, I will
go into my files and pull out the unused material from Our Singing
Country and send it to you. Mrs. Seeger has been written about
the music since she has all of it.

2. I should like very much to come to talk befor the Texas 
Folklore Society next spring, after my programs are over and I 
shall try to make it coincide with a two or three month field
trip into Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana which I have long wanted
to explore in my own way. You might have Dobie write to Macleish
in about ten days inviting me to lecture in May.

3. I think your idea about the books is a grand one, but
I should also like to know what the total of my obligations are
to you at present and I should like you to consider including 
Cowboy Songs in the group since this will be a major problem in
connection with the radio rights. If you feel that this deal will
be of some cash advantage to yourself, I wonder whether a small 
cash to boot could be thrown in as I'm awfully broke this summer.

4. I've just been notified by the Library of Congress that
your recording trip and your stay in Washington have been finally
approved. $500.00 from the Library of Congress increase for per
dime and milage, and $250.00 for records, needles and other incidentals.
A new recording machine will be bought for the trip which
will be much more portable than others you have used. Besides, Mr.
Macleish has got from the Carneigie Foundation, $500.00 to pay expenses
for you and Deanie to stay in Washington for six weeks to
anotate your own field recordings. In this regard, I wonder whether
it would not be wise for you to postpone completion of adventures
until you can get close to your material. Let me know about your
wishes and ideas about the trip. I'm already pulling out of my files
all of the contacts I have along through the mountain country.
