        Ben Theurer of Harrisburg 
Pa. told his son, a private in
the Marine Corps, to write
frequently even if he had no news,
to tell.
       Mr. Theurer shouldn't have 
been surprised when he received
the following letter recently:
           Dear Dad:
                     Affectionately Yours,
                                                    Dick.
           P.S. Boy, ? I tried!                                                         [*Folder 118*]
