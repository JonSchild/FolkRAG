[Later] In the south of Haiti I saw the batons that are used by the principle
dancer of the rara bands "raised up" and "given [food and] drink"
in essentially the same way. Yet, some days later, they were
baptised, received names and gifts from various god-mothers and god-fathers,
and "grace et misericorde" was asked for them by the bush priest.
[The process seems to ? ? be somewhat similar to the Catholic]
The pots, [and] jars, [and] flags, canes, handkerchiefs [are] of the vaudou

interest in the voice of the officiant who repeated the name after
me. [I im imagine that the ]
[Whether] Care in choice of a name and whether the name is remembered, [I imagine] depends, perhaps, on the
