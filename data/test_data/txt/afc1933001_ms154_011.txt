Dear Sir:

We understand you have a recording of 
a phonograph record of the ballad "Abe Lincoln".
I am informed it was the one used by Alistair
Cooke in a series on folk music which he prepared 
for the British Broadcasting Co. Would 
you kindly tell us if this is the case and if
a record can be obtained for our Abraham Lincoln
collection which is one of the most complete
in this country.

Yours very truly,
C. L. Cannon
