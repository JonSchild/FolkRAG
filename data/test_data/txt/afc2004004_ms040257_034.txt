Rann Buachailleachd
(Herding Rune)

The parting blessing used to be sung by old people in
South Uist when sending their cattle away to the pastures
in the morning.
1.  Travel ye moorland, travel ye townland
Travel ye gently far and wide
God's Son be the Herdsman about your feet
Whole may be home return
The protection of God and Columba
Encompass your going and coming
And about you be the milkmaid of the smooth white palms
Bridget of the clustering hair, golden brown.

THE SONG OF BREADALBANE
O failt air Braid-Albainn
(from same book)
1.  O hail to Breadalbane
Where deer, roes and fawns are found
There, lying so lightly
In long hollows of rushes and grass
The stags and the hinds are around me
Lying on the shoulder of every bush
They are sharp-eyed and sharp-eared
Watching what may come around them at night.
3.  There is no little glen without hunting
With grizzled fawns by it close
The antlered stag of the shy nose
Snuffing cloudy weather air;
Joyful, chasing them I would be
Early on a bright sunny morning without mist.
