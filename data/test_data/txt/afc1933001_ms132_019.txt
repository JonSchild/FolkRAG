Dear Mr. Boehne:

Your letter of inquiry of April 14 has just
come to my attention, as I returned to the city
from Indiana only a day or so ago.

The Archive of American Folk-Song was established
several years ago as a part of the Division
of Music for the purpose of collecting and preserving
American folk-songs. In the beginning, when
recording instruments were unsatisfactory, this work
of preservation was carried on in largely manuscript
form, but in recent years with the development of
fine portable recording machines, the Library has
been steadily enlarging its collection of records of
folk-songs made in the homes of the people who know
them. The Archive now has over 2,000 records from
fourteen states and two neighboring West Indian Islands
and has grown into one of the largest collections of
its kind in the world. Through it the songs of the
American people, which have been handed down from generation
to generation have the opportunity to live alongside
the more sophisticated published music that makes
up the major part of the Music Division. Songs of cowboys,
lumberjacks, Negro convicts, mountaineers; the
fiddle tunes and banjo tunes to which our ancestors
used to dance and which our rural population still enjoys; 
the traditional songs of the English, French, and
Spanish settlers of the United States have been recorded
from the people who have made or preserved them. The
task of the Archive is to record this rich folk culture
and prepare it for the use of scholars and other interested
persons.

The trip to Indiana, during which I met your constituent, 
brought into the Archive a large body of valuable 
and beautiful folk-songs, and I feel that in my
three weeks visit I only sampled Indiana's rich stock of
