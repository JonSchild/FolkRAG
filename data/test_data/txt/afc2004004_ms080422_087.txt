(Mrs. Workman sings) Battlefield

I said unto my savior, my talents are but small
But if I am a soldier, I am the least of all.
Chorus:
I'm going to die on the battlefield
Gonna die in the Lord
I'm gonna die on the Battlefield
With glory in  my soul.

I used to have some who walked along with me,
But since I found salvation they turned their backs on me.

Some said give me silver and some said give me gold,
But I say give me Jesus to save my dying soul.

Oh glory be to Jesus, oh glory to his name
Salvation makes me happy out in the battlefield.

(Phyllis sings)

I'm looking for the stone that was
hewed out of the mountain,
looking for the stone that was
going down from Babylon............etc.

Phyllis: This is a song I remember singing in my dad's church..

Yeah, it's called City that lies Four Square. (Phyllis sings)

I'm going to that city where the hides are hanging high,
I"m going where my troubles cannot come.
Oh will you meet me there my mother
In the city that lies four square.
And we'll all live together over there. .......etc.

AL: Do you think real genuine folk music is coming back?

Phyllis: Oh, sure it is, most certainly.....(after a couple 
minutes) I don't think it every went away, really. Because 
I grew up with it and that's what I've known all my life. But
