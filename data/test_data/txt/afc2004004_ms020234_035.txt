BJ TAPE 20, p. 32

like a good spirit or sumthin' met me at the door.  Said, "Now,
you see that?  You ought to know that you ain't what peoples call
you."  See?  "You ought to know your name."  I don't know what --
put the things down for me -- just talkin' to me.  "You know your
name; if somebody call you Mary or John or Susan, you ain't got to
look back an' answer, 'cause that ain't your name.  Somebody call
you a dawg or, or s-- , or a bitch or all kinda thing like that,
you ain' got to pay it no mind 'cause that's they word outa they
mouf (mouth) an' you ain' got ta give a account of it.
An' you [don't] know you ain't that.  So, if you git mad about what
somebody call you, you represent yourself to be that.

that .  Say, "You mustn't believe lies," like that, ya know?  "Aw,
that jus' a lie," sumpin' like that.  But jus' say to be bad callin'...
TL:  What did you say inside yourself then?
BJ:  Nothin'.  I jus' tell him 'e didn' know nothin about it.
And I'm satisfied then.  Hum, hum, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  He never --
But we never cussed and called names, 'cause either one of us
didn' like cussin'.  You know, so...Tha's all.  We never had --
I'm glad I --
          That's the reason I say I'll never git another husband jus'
like him in a heap a ways, you know.  Heap a ways.  'Cause...An' like that.
