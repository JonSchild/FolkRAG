Co'se Melrose was-was a fella that he would give me a little somethin', to keep you 
alive... to live on, see... an' that's... (end of record)
ALAN:  Remember the Big Bill Blues?
BILL:  "__That the Big Bill Blues ain't bad," an' that repeats an' then you say "It must 
not a been the Big Bill Blues they had."  Most ways, that's the way the first 
verse of it starts off.  Co'se-uh I got the words-uh, an' an' I got the dates of 
all the numbers that I've made.  I got 'em at home in my trunk, I keeps 'em.  
An'-uh, co'se it's a lot of numbers that I've-I wrote that haven't never been 
re-recorded by me, they [that] were recorded by other people.  The-uh Yes-Yes Girls 
made the number of mine.  I-I have never recorded it.  So did Lil[y] Green, she 
made some numbers of mine, I haven't never recorded 'em.  'N' I haven' got anything 
out of 'em.  Arthur _____, he was one of the guys that made a number of 
mine an'-an' swo' it was his'n.  "Rock Me Baby," was the first name of mine, 
that-when I first recorded it I called it that "Rock Me Baby."  But-uh come 
down to-when they-when he made it, uh-me an' _Victory__, when I first made it I 
called it "Rock Me Mam-Rock Me Baby". but-uh the company wouldn' take mine like 
that, they changed the name of it themselves.  They changed the name of my 
number an' called it, call it "Rockin' Chair Blues."  Then when Arthur _____ 
made it for the Victory, they let it went on "Rock Me Mamma," same thing, see?  
But-uh, with the same nam-title that I had for mine but the company changed 
mine themselves, see?  'Stead a "Rock Me Mamma" or "Rock Me Baby" they had it
