carry Black Sampson's spoken expiation for his sin of setting down
a delightful tune and story. Afterwards when Alan played back the

carry our heavy machine to the big prison gates, he said to me as I

Washington hears my song, they'll help this pore nigger git outa this

"Niggers growin' mo' like white folks, every day" begins a Negro
song. The Negro is going further in becoming "Mo' like white folks"
than merely to modify his beautiful spirituals. Under the leadership
of his preachers, his teachers, and his men of education, he is abandoning
them as unworthy of perpetuation entirely. Manassas, Virginia,
was once recommended to me as a likely place to find genuine Negro
spirituals. I made a long drive to reach the church only to be gretted,
when the singing began, by a surpliced choir that marched from the basement
up into the church to slow waltz-time music, derived from a book of
cheap, white, revival tunes.
