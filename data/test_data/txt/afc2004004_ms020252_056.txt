2nd Reel of 10/12/61, Song 2

GO WHERE I SEND THEE

My chirrun, go where I send thee, 
How shall I send thee, Lord?
I'm gonna send you one by one. 
One is jus' a lil' baby, 
Born by the Virgin of the Mary, 
Rockeded in the cradle-uh, 
Whatcha gonna call that baby?
I'm gonna call 'im Jesus.
He was born, born Lord, 
He was born in Bethlehem. 

Now chirrun, go where I send thee, 
How you gonna send me, Lord?
I'm a-gonna send you two by two. 
Two is Paul and Silas, 
One is a little-bitty baby, 
Born the Virgin of the Mary, 
Rockeded in the cradle-uh, 
whatcha gonna call that baby?
I'm gonna call 'im Jesus. 
He was born, born Lord, 
He was born in Bethlehem. 

Etc...I'm gonna send these three by three. 
Three is the Hebrew chirrun, etc.

Four is the four come knockin' at the door...

Five is the Gospel writers..
