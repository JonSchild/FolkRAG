study about 3 months in the State of New York, 3 months in the 
State of Pennsylvania and three or four months in Texas, and
to make about 200-300 records of Czechoslovak folksongs, the
most characteristic[al] and also the most beautiful, choicing
some of every species [of them], -- a grant, which would enable
me to carry out my research project and an analysis of the state 
Czechoslovak Folksong and its Fate in the United States, based
on that research.

I also submit the contents of my above-mentioned 
musicological and sociological project.
