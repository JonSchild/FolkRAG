Hanson, Dean of the Eastman School of Music,

anything in detail concerning the School of 
Music of this institution. 

The Carnegie Corporation has presented 
to the States College of Washington a 
records, and several hundred score and books 
on music. This is a fine addition to our 
record library. There are several thousand
books on music in the general library. The 
Carnegie set is housed in a large and attractively 
furnished room in Van Doren Hall, and 
is available to students and the general public 
for six hours per day under the supervision 
of capable attendants. 

Our college radio station, KWSC, 
operates day and evening on a frequency of 
1220 kilocycles with power of five thousand 
watts. KWSC is purely an educational station 
and accepts no paid advertising of any
kind. In addition to the programs prepared by 
students and staff, a considerable number of 
transcriptions are broadcast. 

We should welcome any consideration 
you can give us through the use of your records 
in carrying out our important educational 
project; and will be grateful for any suggestion 
you may make. 

Furthermore, the State college of 
Washington has been made an official film 
depository for the Department of the Interior,
