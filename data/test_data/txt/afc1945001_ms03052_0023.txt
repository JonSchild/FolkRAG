Dear Sir:

This is in response to your request for a report on rumors
concerning the war effort. Under the classification of number 1,
"What rumors people are telling," the following may be reported:

"That the United States is treating its war prisoners
better than many of its civilians."

This rumor is frequently heard especially in night clubs,
taverns, and coffee shops. Specific instances are Juarez, Mexico, 
August 3 and El Paso, Texas, August 3.

A second rumor which is being broadcast is to the effect 
that "the leadership of the war effort is weak, that the people
are strong and are fully aware of their responsibilities if they
only had proper leadership." Such rumors have been heard in
San Antonio, Texas, in hotel lobbies on dates between August 1
and the date of this report. These two types seem to be most
frequently repeated.

Specific rumors:

Enroute to El Paso, Texas, July 30--Heard on Pullman car
conversation between two men which ran like this: "I was in
St. Louis last week and heard that there are so many automobile
casings in storage in the larger cities that sufficient space
is not available for them in some cases."

The reply: "I heard that gasoline rationing is only
because the big oil companies and war officials want to get
rich out of it in the end."

El Paso, July 31--Rumored that two Japs were shot by
guards at the Deming, New Mexico, concentration camp for failure
to obey orders.
