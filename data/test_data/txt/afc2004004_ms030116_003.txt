Reverend Gary Davis -- Animal Talk

Looked up an saw a man bringin thirty mo.  Man say, "What you goin do
wid all these cows?"  Bull overhear him.  He beller,
"Bring em heah!  Bring em heah!  I can use thirty mo!"
Man was too slow.  Bull jumped the pasture fence.  Say, "I'm goin have
'em!  I'm goin have em!"

         BAPTIZING OF THE ANIMALS
     Preacher one time he put on a revival.  It was told that he baptized
ever thing that come to him.  He had such a grand time.  He had done
baptized all the people.
     Hoss he got the idea he wanted to be baptized, so he grabbed him by
the collar and baptized him.
     Mule he decided he wanted to be baptized, so he grabbed an baptized him.
     Then the peafowl flew up on his shoulder an he baptized him.
     Then the old cow came up an he baptized her.
     The sheep came an after the sheep got his baptism they got the goat
up theah.  Got him to the bank an couldn't git him no further.  Deacon got
tired an set down.  Preacher said, "Don't you believe, Brother Goat?"  Goat
wouldn't budge.  Preacher said to the Deacon,
     "Brother, come on up heah an hep me baptize this goat."
     "Nah sah," said the Deacon.  "I'm tired.  I see what kina time you had
gitten him to the bank.  Jes sprinkle that goat an let him go to Hell."

     You see what kind of 'sinuation that is?  The Methodist people must
git sick when they git that throwed on em.
     'Nomination don't make no difference.  They're all on the same road.
Don't matter what buggy they're ridin.
