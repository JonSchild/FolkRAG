Office of the Librarian

Dear Doctor Lomax:

Mr. Engel has passed me your note to him of the twelfth, confirming the suggestion made in conversation that you should, for a time, serve as Honorary Conservator of our Archive of American Folk-Song, incidentally continuing with our machine, at your own expense, to record and collect material in the field and, while in Washington, assisting in the response to inquiries involving the Archive itself.

The services will be most appropriate and is very welcome to us, and in our report, now being prepared for submission to Congress, we shall be gratified to refer to it as a disinterested contribution to a valuable section of the work of our Music Division, including you in the list of Honorary Consultants and as Honorary Curator of this particular archive.

Your note accords further permission to the Library to make copies of any of the material in this field which you have heretofore personally accumulated.  In so far as our resources permit us to take advantage of this, we shall certainly appreciate it.

Very sincerely yours,
Librarian


Dr. John A. Lomax
