2.

"Lie still, lie still, [Mattie Grow] little Mattie Grow,
And keep me from the cold;
'Tis nothing but my father's boys [a blowing up shepherd]
A-blowing up a shepherd in the cove."

Then from a hug [u]into a kiss
They turned and fell asleep,
And when they woke up in the night,
Lord Donald was standing at their feet.

"Rise up, rise up, Little Mattie Grow
Rise up, put on your clothes,
For never shall old England say
I killed a naked man."

"Two sharp edged swords you hold in your hand,
To kill me at your command,
And I have not a pocket knife,
No, not to defend my life."

"Two sharp edge swords you hold in your hand,
They cost me deep in gold,
But the best of them I'll give to you,
The other myself will hold."

"Stand up, stand up, Little Mattie Grow,
And fight me like a man,
For the very first lick that I hit you,
I'll kill you if I can."

The very first lick little Mattie struck,
He wounded Lord Donald sore,
The very first Lord Donald struck,
Little Mattie fell to the floor.

Then he took his damsel by the hand
And he set her on his knee,
"Which one do you love the best, --
It's little Mattie Grow or me?"

"I very well love your red rose cheek,
I very well love your chin,
But I [?]ould not give little Mattie Crow
For you and all your kin."

Then he took his damsel by the hand
And he [?]ed her to the plains,
He took his sword out from its sheath
And split her through the brains.

This is all I can remember. You may know the first verses or maybe
Sis or [?]oe will remember them. Glad to get the Texas Ranger song. Hope
said he would learn to sing it. Hope you are well as we are. When
are you coming out. Write soon.
