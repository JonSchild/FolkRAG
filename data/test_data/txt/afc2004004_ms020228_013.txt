BJ:  They would pick at you.  They never bother me, but I heard
'em talk of pickin' at people, [when they was ridin' along. Make]went an' grabbin' em an' makin'
'em git in cars an' all that, ya know?  I jus' didn't take [a] no
chance at it.  They know about me; I stayed there five years.
AL:  But they did [  ] do it to other people?
BJ:  They have, they have picked at peoples, jus' say, an' make
'em git in the car.

BJ:  Um-hum. An' so, anyway.  I went along with him to this show.
[We just [stood] went to the show an' talked.]  An' we just stood to the
show an' talked.  I mean, ah, lookin' , laughin' at the peoples
in the show.
     An' so.  An' therefore, he didn't try to. . .come to see me or
nothin' . An' that. . .An' talked wit' me an' that. . . Come back home with me.
We got ready to go.  He asked me was I ready.  I tol'  'im  "Yeah."
We come on back.
     So the woman there guessin' ages.  You know, you know how
it is with a mess a peoples. Guessin' ages an' everything.  An'
she guessed it to, to a T, you know?  An' she's guessin' his
age to a T.  I heard 'er give it to him. Give it to another
one. Down to a T, she. . .Of course, it ain't no guessin'. That
man come an' ask you an' she hear it, you know that.  You, you
know, when that man come an' whisper to ya an' tell 'im, she,
she hear it then.  She already hear it, 'cause she - - If he gonna
guess it, she, she's, she can say it without him comin' an'
askin' ya.  So, it's jest that way, I know.  [An' but,] An so any-anyway,
that's what it was.
