Dear Alan:

The duplicating of the Leadbelly songs for
your progress has been completed and the recording is
being sent today.  At least one of the songs is recorded
scratchily from the aluminum and you may not be able to
use it but the others are good and clear.  Will you let
us have the date of that program again so that I can be
sure to listen to it?  I know it will be good.

On page 10 of the enclosed Bulletin, there
is an account of the meetings of the American Folklore
Society from which we are slowly recovering.  Are you
planning to attend Stith's doings in Indiana?

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Duncan Emrich
Chief, Folklore Section
