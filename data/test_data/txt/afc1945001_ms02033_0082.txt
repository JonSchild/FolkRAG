From Margery C. Quigley, Montclair, New Jersey.
Heard in Springfield Mass Aug. 13 1942
Subject:  Defense Workers' Morale

"Is Mary's daughter going away to boarding
school next year?"
"Yes, the mother is absolutely determined that
she must go now. You know they live on a
street between the two Armories and Mary says
that the language they have to listen to in the
middle of the night as the defense workers on
the night shifts go by is unfit for the
child to hear. And besides, the City simply
can't get police enough nowadays to patrol
the Park properly so four of five girls have
been assaulted there lately and one never
knows what may happen with this huge
influx of defense workers and more
factories and air fields soon to open up."
