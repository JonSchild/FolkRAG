Harry Cox. (undated tape of Peter Kennedy's)
Lomax: What's the story of this one, Harry?
Cox: Well, this is about where they went away to catchin' (mumble) -
used to hurl the harpoon into 'em.
Lomax: Right out of this part of the country?
Cox: Yeah. Greenland. (pause) Is he ready for it?
Lomax: Right, Peter? (pause) Wait a minute, wait a minute. (pause)
Okay.
Cox:
So I cannot stay all on this shore
As I am so deeply in debt.
To Greenland we will go brave boys,
Some money for to get, brave boys,
Some money for to get.

So when we had reached fair Liverpool,
An' our good luck ship to man,
And there our names they were all taken down,
And for Greenland we were bound, brave boys,
And for Greenland we were bound.

And whne we had safely reach Greenland,
And the good luck ship  took more,
And so soon we shall wish ourselves back again,
All along with the girls on the shore, brave boys,
All along with the girls on the shore.
