Adventures of a Ballad Hunter

form of service that these strong, sincere and practical men worked
out with their congregations was taken over later wholesale by the
Negro slaves who had just been deprived of their African gods; and the
Negro flung into the service all his love of the dance and dramatic
ceremonials. Into the songs in which pioneers had mourned the hardships
of their frontier life, the Negro poured the sorrows of his bondage,
his jubilant and triumphant strength, his desire for the freedom
of heaven where he could "set down", and his flair for epigram and religious
imagery. He could sing of the fearful delights of the Resurrection 
Day with the pleasure and passion of an early Christian.

My Lawd, what a mornin' when the stars begin to fall,
My Lawd, what a mornin' when the stars begin to fall,
You see the world on fire,
You see the moon a-b leedin'
You see the tombs come crackin',
Then you see the graves a-bustin',
Then you see the coffins crackin',
Then you see the bones a-creepin',
And you see po' sinners rising' . . .

The weariness of this life was never more poignantly expressed:

I lay in the grave and I stretch out my arms
When I lay this body down.

Nor is the reward of the common man in Heaven more powerfully put:

When I get to Heaven, gonna take my stand
Gonna talk with my Lord like a natural man.

Gonna argue with the Father
Gonna chatter with the Son
Tell them all about the world
I done come from.

Two white horses side by side,
Me an' my Jesus take us an evenin' ride.
