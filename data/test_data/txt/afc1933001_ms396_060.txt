One night out on south Bosque creek,
I never will forget;
We rounded up and bedded down
In the valley of Bosque creek.
About midnight one of the boys came in:
"You had better saddle up
From the looks of things
Around up north
We are going to have a run."
Out to our left was the Littlefield bunch
We heard them shoot a gun.
One of the boys remarked to me,
"They are having their part of the fun."
We strung them out next morning
And counted one by one;
We saw we had our number
And then we grazed them on.

We passed on out through Valley Mills,
One of the boys bought a hat;
He tought he came out lucky
To get off as light as that.
On up by that lone grocery,
Kept by Bob Woodall.
Bob set up the bitters,
The best he had to drink.
We crossed the Brazos at Ft. Kimball,
A noted old pioneer Fort.
The only trouble after that was keeping them out of the fields.
The old nesters were pretty plain.
And this to us did say,
"If you let your cattle in our grain
You sure will have to pay."

We made it up near Ft. Worth,
Out on the open range.
We herded around a week or so
To get them looking good.
One night while there, we had another run.
That night old Blue Dog kept his feet,
We never heard a gun.
We sold our bunch to one armed Reed,
Who was buying for Ft. Sill.
Our Boss' name was then Buck Scott
Who pushed them on the trails.

After we crossed the Red river
We began to pass the mounds.
One of the boys recognized,
The grave of Charley Brown.
"Beefy more beefy, more Texas beef,"
You now on Indian grounds
You had better make the Washita before the sun goes down.
