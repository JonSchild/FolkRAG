Verses from Thomas Pattison's Farewell of the Emigrant

Farewell now to all that embraces thy shore
Dear land of my race that I ne'er shall see 
                                    more
Lands richer there may be before me than thine
But no other country can ever be mine

it was for the mists I was wearying
weary for the mists

Unless the children get to feel something about
the hills + the mists, they'll grow up crabbed
like the factor -

the meal costs me 45 s - If the blessed
bring only brew - but how should he know
it is the queens blessings on her who will
know the price of meal + she has not had
time to tell him yet -
