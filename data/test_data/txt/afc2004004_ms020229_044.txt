was gittin' mad [fer ya] firs'!"
     I told him, "He come, I was gonna git mad first.  I was gonna
tear 'im up with that hoe out there, in the field."
     So, he jus' tuk that one an' carried it to the house.  An' he
come back an' brought us another'n.  An' we stayed there an' worked
all the whole time.  An' den he walkin' an ' lookin' an' walk
on across the field a little.  I had told him about it when we went
up there to -- at the payroll at the, in town.  It git put
up in town.
     An' so, I tol' um Mr., ah, I mean Dr. Brian.  Mr. Green was in
there.  I said, "Dr. Brian," I said, "Mr. Green been goin' across the
fields just a-huntin' an' tryin' ta hunt some spots that we
ain't hoed."  I said, "Did he ever tell you about any?"
     He say, "No, he haven't."  [Say] Said, "Green, you been huntin'
places they ain't hoed?"  Said, "They're not doin' their work 
right?"
     He said, "I ain't never find none."  He said, "How did you
know that?"
     I said, "I jus' see you goin' across there."  I said, "You
must be huntin' that."  So, I wont - Said, "You don't go across
mine an' Rosie's."  I said, "Anytime I don't do the work to suit
ya," I said, "I'll just leave.  That's all."
     So, so, he just, heh, said, "Well..."
     An' Dr. Brian said, "Ya ain't got to worry about Big Gal."  He
didn't know nothin' about me.  He ain't never know nothin' about
me!  He just heard about me, you know?  Tha's all.  People that
moved from MIllen up there told him about me.  So, "Don't worry
about her.  If she don't do it good, she ain't gonna do it at
all."  [Says] Said, "Jus' don't worry about it."
