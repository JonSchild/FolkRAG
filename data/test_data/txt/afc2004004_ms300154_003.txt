Dear Mr Lomax,

I am asking you to please send me a money order
or the cash money. Because I cannot get this 
check cashed Because it is a personal check 
and the Banks won't take it. I would have 
wrote you sooner But I have Been out of 
town ever sicence July of last year and just
come the first of this month. I will thank
you very much if you do this for me as
quick as possibly Because I need the money 
Very Bad.
Thank you.
