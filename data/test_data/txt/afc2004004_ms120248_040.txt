Dec.  20 Sunday night.
My laziness and the press of events have conspired to make me miss
so much in the account I should be writing of my visit to Haiti that
I may as well begin over again with what passed today and perhaps
thus find the resolution to go on in reading tomorrow what I shall
have written tonight.
This morning I lay for what seemed hours and listened to a gentle
tap-tap that came from somewhere near me. For a long time I fitted
it into the dreams, that were passing swiftly across my palate,
then I wondered if it were raining, and at last I woke up. Someone
was at the door. When I turned the great cast-iron key, there was
Monseigneur Polines.  I asked him how long he had been knocking. "Oh,
'bout ee-fifteen de minootsah," he said with a sort  of gay humility.
Later Dr. Leon came bustling up to the table where Polines[(], my mentor,
my professor, my master, he who whose ardent disciple I am and whom
I have agreed to pay [the] what is in Haiti the scandalously high wage[s]
of ten dollars a month[)], and I were transcribing the words from a recording
of a voodoo dance I made night before last--- an invocation
to Agasu, whom Polines politely, fearfully now prefers to know as
"de big chief [deil] devil." The more pleased I was with the results of
the previous night's visit to les tambours, the more Dr. Leon rubbed
his hands. At first he was afraid that he had better not tell
Dr. Lamothe about the recordings sans permission of the minister of interior,
but as I beamed, his fear departed. He really likes the dancing
drum anyhow and as he comes to believe that I am an important person
he wants more and more to help me. I hope that sometime I [coul] can
keep from going to sleep in the presence of the members of my own kind,
I refer to the bourgoisie, and really look at them, but now I seem to
go to sleep inside when one of them is near and I no more know what
makes their wheels go round than if I were in the presence of some head
hunter of the upper Salween. I say this as an apology for my lack of
information about Leon and the others. At least, however, I can describe
him. Dark cream color, small black eyes, [fintly] faintly pink lips,
hair straight, black and short, prognathous, a convex face with the
[pe] slope from hair line to nose and then to chin, round belly, round short body, fat
pudgy hands. Jules Faine, who came in a moment later, looks exactly like
Mr. Goldschmidt, only bronze where Mr. G. is pale and pink. Presently
after Faine had listened politely to my account of the principle of
the instantaneous recorder, we all went to visit Lamothe, Haiti's foremost
musician. His house is old and rotting, with the pleasant smell
of decaying boards, a long porch on one side with shaky planks and
withered chairs facing on a garden. The usual Haitian lower middle [cl]
class parlor with the violent flower pa[pp]ttern on the wall paper, big
flowers, bright flowers, comfortable chairs with twisted legs.
There was a picture of the great Pole with his head on his hand and
Beethoven's ninth symphony on the piano. Lamothe was very nervous
and ushered me in from the front gate to his piano as if his
body were working on springs. It was strange, but his eyes kept going
away from my face into the distance as if he were some timid little
creature of the bush. He is dark brown, short and [fat but] plump,
but I must remember to notive his hands when I see him again. His eyes
diverted me. I made two poor records of his Haitian stuff, two carnival
pieces with complicated rhythms in imitation of the drum. He was very
hurt when I showed no pleasure at the results. I had to explain at
great length that the coustic conditions were not satisfact[l]ory, which was
