Dear Alan:

   In my forthcoming book "Americans and Their Songs"
I would like to include the following songs from your
book "American Ballads and Folk Songs" published by
MacMillan publishers in 1934:

   Words only of:
   CUATRO PALOMITAS BLANCAS (English only)
   COWBOYS GITTIN' UP HOLLER
   SIOUX INDIANS

   I would greatly appreciate it if you could grant
this request, and, of course, all the credits shall be
mentioned in my book which is to be published early this
spring.

   I am doing a lecture-recital for the members of the
Gridiron Club and their wives at the Hotel Willard in
Washington this Sunday, March 1st, at 3:30 p.m.  If you
could call and leave your number at the Willard, perhaps
I could give you a ring when I get into town.

With kindest personal regards,

frank
