Burlington, N.C. 

Dear Mr. Collins: 
We are waiting anxiously to hear 
from you about your recording project, 
and also about ballad records. I 
have so many good ballad records 
which I want to get released and which 
you people could be the avenue for. 
Let's so something about that before
Christmas. 
Regards,
