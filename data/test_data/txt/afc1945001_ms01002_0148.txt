priest went to protest. 6. Preist was insulted. 7. Priest 
was beaten up. 8. FBI was called in. 9. The board was closed 
up. All of these details are not necessary for a summary of 
the rumor and they make adequate counteraction impossible. Not 
all of the points are covered in the denials. Therefore, we might 
expect some to be enhanced by the column's effort.

V.  Education Program--On Rumors in Wartime

Key people in the rumor-control project can be expected 
to be called upon for public talks or special concerning 
their work. It is important that much talks and publicity be integrated 
into the total educational program. To present a round 
of talks on "Rumor" may prove much less efficient than to devote 
the same amount of time and energy to talks to supplying basic information 
which will help eliminate the more pernicious rumors. 

Talks or releases directly on Rumor as a topic (rather 
than on rumors) are at time appropriate. This may best occur 
when it seems wise to reduce the people's anxieties about RUMOR. One 
of the important roots of rumors is people's anxieties. If anxieties 
increase, we might ordinarily expect rumors to increase. 
A flurry of rumor-control activity may well serve to increase 
anxieties, to increase people's guilt feelings about past utterances, 
to increase people's suspicions of their neighbors. When 
talking about Rumor, therefore, it is important to consider the 
end-result of the talk. Presumably the result desired is the 
reduction of rumors. Therefore, the talk should serve to help 
people understand how natural and inevitable rumors are in wartime,
