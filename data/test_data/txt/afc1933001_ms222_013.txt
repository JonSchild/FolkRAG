then cancelled it.  Whatever your
reasons they are sufficient
for me, without any explanation 
[from] to me.  You've got
to consider your own engagements, 
your own life, without
reference to me.  In trying to
order my own life so that
I should never be a burden 
on my children, [and]  I have 
had in mind primarily
that they should be absolutely
free to work out their own
destiny with no imposition
of my will or my desires
or my angular notions.
So, whatever you have
decided, is right with me.
