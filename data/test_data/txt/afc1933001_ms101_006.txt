Dear Mr. Lomax:
Thank you very much for your letter of January 16. The question of free review copies of our folk song albums has come up frequently during the past few years and has caused us great concern. As you may remember, the grant from the Carnegie Corporation contained only a very small revolving fund which was not really intended to furnish capital for projects as large as those which we have since undertaken. On the other hand, when the opportunity to issue these folk song albums came along, we could not neglect it. Were we to attempt to give away free review copies even to the major record critics of the country, we should have to increase the price far beyond the reach of the average individual, to say nothing of many institutions and libraries. For this reason, we decided a few months ago to set aside a limited number of sets to be lent to those reviewers who are interested in writing about our recordings. Unfortunately, however, we are still experiencing difficulty in obtaining records from the manufacturer in quantities sufficient to inaugurate this new practice. We are working very hard on this problem, however, and hope to be in a better position in regard to stock in a few months. We shall then offer these sets on lean by letter to the various reviewers and feel sure that many of them will be glad to cooperate.
Mr Reynolds' remarks to his letter to you of January 13, are based on the misunderstanding that our project is comparable to the work of the largest recording companies like Columbia and Victor. This is, of course, not so and I hope that you can assure Mr. Reynolds, as Mr. Spivacke has attempted to do in his letter, of our gratitude for his interest and of the fact that our practice is dictated by circumstances beyond our control at the present time.
That Mr. Reynolds says about American people knowing practically nothing about these records is only relatively true. The fact remains that our Recording Laboratory has never been able to catch up with current orders and has disposed of as many records as it was possible to obtain from the factory without any publicity campaign to speak of. This fact should please you because it is after all flattering to your original work for our Archive of American Folk Song.
