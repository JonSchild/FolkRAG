1645 B (Cont.).    33
We had another tough guy by the name of Sheep-Eye. He was
the toughest man in the world until Aaron Harris showed up. When
Aaron Harris showed up, he was just like a lamb, like anybody else.
He was also one of those raiders, go[ing] [a]round the games, the
cotch games they called them.--A cotch game* is what you call
three card Spanish poker,--and take all the money and curse you
and beat and kick you, take a pistol and slap you across the head. It
was all right, when Aaron Harris walked in, he was just as nice 
a little boy as you ever seen in the world. He was nice, [and]
lovely.
Question: Did they ever have any songs about Sheep-Eye?
Morton: No, never had any songs about him. Maybe [because]
he really was yellow. Say, I hope he is dead, because if he
ever hears this, I will be dead, too.
Question: What about Robert Charles?
Morton: Robert Charles? Well, there was a little song
about Robert Charles, but I don't remember it. Robert Charles.
What you like to hear about that? Robert Charles was the man
that sold papers at the Dryad's market, Dryad's and Melpomene 
at New Orleans and a very swell fellow. One day he had some
trouble with his wife [in] an argument. She went out and got a
policeman and the policeman wanted to arrest Robert Charles,
according to the information, which I gathered, which I feel is
very authentic, because I only lived four blocks from Robert
Charles at that period. And Robert Charles was under arrest
* Cotch is a 3 card Spanish monte. The biggest cotch in the
game is 3 6's.
