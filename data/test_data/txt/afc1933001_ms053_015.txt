Mr. John A. Lomax
1618 Avenue Y
Lubbock, Texas

Dear John Lomax:

It is funny that our letters about the possibility
of your working for us should have crossed. At any rate
you can see that I have not forgotten you. I shall have
to wait, of course, until Alan gets back with the
machine before making any plans for such a trip.

The question of dust on the records has already
worried us and accordingly we have investigated the possibility
of purchasing special cases for them. In fact
the first case is already here and I shall try it out
and order more if it proves useful.

With kindest regards to all!

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
