John A. Lomax, Esq.
University Station
Austin, Texas

My dear Mr. Lomax:

 I have taken up with the Librarian some of the 
questions and suggestions presented in your letter
of June 7th. Unfortunately, no appropriation for 
the coming year will be available for services in
connection with the folk-song project. Under the
present conditions, therefore, it would seem proper
that you retain the title of Honorary Curator of the
Archive. Under these same conditions also, it would
seem improper for the Library to prescribe to you any
place as your domicile. Naturally, we should welcome
having you nearer at hand; but whether or not you
choose Washington is a matter for you to decide irrespective 
of your connection with the Library.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music
