An they call other people in to help out.  Maybe this preacher from some
other place or sumpin.  They have what you call a regular preacher.
Eliz:  But they have visiting preachers as well?  And Rev. D. would fit in
as a kind of visiting preacher, and to sing?
Mrs. D:  That's right.  Everybody love to hear him sing and play that
git-tar.  Sunday Rev. D. is invited to a lot of things.  H e was invited
to sing for a preacher that was goin to preach over on Eighth Avenue
Sunday night but that night he had to go to a birthday in Newark.
He had to fill this appointment.  I want to tell you because I'm gittin
him to remember little things.
Eliz:  Rev. D. has such a philosophical mind (He begins to laugh
with wickedness and pride Hah-hah-hah-hah in back of this flattering
remark.  He is very devilish and coy) that the hardest time I have had
with him is getting him to tell me the everyday, down-to-earth things
of life.  (He burst out in a great derisive high-pitched Yaaaaaaaaaah!)
He's such a complete poet. (Heh-heh-heh-heh!)  It's just like pulling
eye-teeth to get him to tell me things. (Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Heh-heh-heh-heh!)  He starts to talk in a general way about things --
which is wonderful.  But I have now a lot of that and I want  all the
details of his life.  I want to know what he does with himself all the
time.  He's mysterious to me still. (Huh-huh-huh-huh-heh-heh!) (We both
laugh loudly)
Mrs. D:  I try to git him to stay on the same subject, try to git him to
concentrate along, you know. Stay on the same subject till you finish
it.
Eliz:  Well. He has the kind of mind -- he's a philosopher.  He's always
unwinding a thought. (Hahahahaha!)  And building up a whole speculation
about the world and --
Mrs. D:  Yeah.
Eliz:  But I cannot get him to tell me just the down to earth,
