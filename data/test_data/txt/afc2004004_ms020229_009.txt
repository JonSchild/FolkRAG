BJ TAPE 15, p. 6

Jesus prepare for us. An’ where is that?  ‘Cause, see, God
ha’ done made the Heaven an’ done made the earth an’ da fullness
thereof. An’ Jesus say, “I’m goin’ to prepare a place for ya.” 
AL: Well, ya go to Heaven then, won’t ya?
BJ:  Hum? Heaven was already prepared.
AL: So you go to Heaven when you die, and...
BJ: You go to a heaven. Yeah, a heaven. Tha’s right. Because
Jesus said, “Where I am, is Heaven, also.” See? An’,"I'm goin'
ta prepare a place for you." See? 'An' where I be, you be, also.”
See.
An’ den, ah, but, He, He didn't have to prepare Heaven, ‘cause
Heaven’s already [been] made, see? An' God say He gonna move His
Heaven up higher, ya know, when this ol' earth begin ta, ta start,
ya see? An, an' so...An' then, in other words again, Heaven is not,
is, is not to the Kingdom. Ya know. Ya see, when ya, when ya,
when ya go in that front room there, ya not in the, in the, in
the livin' room, see? Ya not in the Kingdom. An' so, 'cause He
say He gonna -- He, He settin' on [the] His throne, 'way above the
heavens. An' so, ah...
But, anyway, ah, you have to be in a restin' place, an'
waitin', [till] until, ah the final day. An' it says seems just as a
day, you know? An' all those folks what done gone, Moses an'
John and Elijah an' -- not, ah, um, not Elijah, but Elijah. (pronounced ELIZSHA)
An all the others, an'all the others. That's just goin' on. [an'] When 
we all rise together, it seem just as a day, so He say. 'Cause
it's just as ya took a nap or sumpin', just as a day. An', [ah] in - 'cause He
said, a whole time is not but a day wit' Him. You think
about that.
