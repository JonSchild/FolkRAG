AMERICAN PATCHWORK
CAJUNS-LOMAX SCRATCH NASS 1/18/89

LOMAX     This morning Cajun music that's 
captured the ear of America as America has learned also to 
savor Cajun cooking, burnt red fish, shrimp et [tu fez] and
oysters a la something or other. This haunting music has
arisen only recently in southwest Louisiana, an area that is 
our own largest French speaking by the world. But they don't
speak French normally. They speak with an accent, a Cajun
accent. And they sing with a Cajun accent.

And this show is about trying to probe that
mystery. Musical mysteries are delicate and difficult to
unravel.

I want to share with you one of my most
extraordinary experiences while looking into this recently.
Driving down the misty road past the shining silver marshes 
that are so typical of that area where it's all low lying.
You're always draining water so you can farm. It's a rice
area. I encountered a, in the middle of the road occupying 
the whole of a modern American cement highway, a huge band
of mounted bedecked riders. Who were these people? It
turns out that they were having a Cajun mardi gras, a
carnival. This of course marks them down as French because
mardi gras is a French word meaning Fat Tuesday. And
