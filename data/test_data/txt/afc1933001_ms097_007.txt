Dear Mr. Spivacke:
Answering yours of
Dec. 19, I would have you please to remember that
I have two separate accounts with
you.
1. The one first submitted was
returned to me in September with the final approval
of Miss Rogers. On this
one I have sent direct to you
two detailed final reports.
2. The second one covering a
trip to the Texas Panhandle and
to Arkansas I submitted to months
ago. From it I have received
no word.
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
