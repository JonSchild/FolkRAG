"You know this Kay Mukai (Japanese Proprietor of an Ogden Noodle
Parlor) who runs the Bamboo Noodle? Well, you remember when he used to 
get that infection, that eczema on his face every fall and would go away
for a couple of weeks. Well, I understand he used to rub that paint off
his face as soon as he got out of town, and he spent the whole two weeks
every year up at Bingham and around those copper mines, and around these
dams and canals taking pictures and making maps." [*Salt Lake City Utah 8-5  21*]
