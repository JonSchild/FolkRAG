And I was left a prisoner. I was left to think it o'er.
A noble thought came in ma heid, I up the window drew
Twa willing hands did help me out. They didna like the blue
I wasna a rascal, a rascal, to the bone
To tear the coat from off his back
And that not being his own.
The next thing I may mention it leads to my disgrace
I was marching down to Aiberdeen just for to lead my case
The judge he passed the sentence. I heard it like I should
I got twenty shilling o' a fine to pay
And thirteen for the coat.
I think the folk at Tarvis a gaol would need to get
For tae lock up their prisoners and nae let them escape
Come a' jolly pluming lads, a warning tak' frae me
That when you gang to Tarvis dinna get on the spree.
