Come, sing a song to the Barons
As they cuddle down for the night

Mrs John Flynn
106 Scot Street                  

Old Dan Tucker was a nice old man
He washed his face in the frying pan
---
Go to sleep, go to sleep and come to granny
Behind the hush, upon the hill

Selma Fienberg
205 Washington Ave.,        

Bear Hunt in Dover
And all at once gave thrust and thump
And lo, was nothing but a stump.
 
The cold wind swept the mountains heights
And trackless was the dreary wild
As mid the cheerless hours of night
A mother wandered with her child

Mr. John Gleason
210 Depot Street                  

I run the old mill over in Rubenville
My name is John Ebenezer Fry,

Mrs Eugene Bushee
               
It was in the autumn of of the year; 
And the leaves they were falling
When young Jim Grey on his deathbed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

Mrs. Oakes
102 Oakes Street                    

Dan, Dan, the dirty man
Washed his face in the frying pan

Jim Finnigan lived in Walker Street
A genteel Irishman mighty odd
To live in this world he carried a hod
A beautiful brogue so rich and sweet

Mrs. John Gleason
210 Depot Street 
                  
Beyond yon weeping willow
Where the violet fair do bloom

It was there he stood a-gazing
It was there he dropped his reins
He drew a pistol from his breast
And fired it through his brains

Mrs. J. C. Houran
West Road                                

Young Charlotte live by the mountain side
In a wild and lonely spot.
