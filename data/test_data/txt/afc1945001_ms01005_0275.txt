[*Dr Roster.... referred by  [?] - Room 333-*]

Mr. Paul Richman, Anti-Defamation League, 
wants to find out if the following rumor is true:

England ordered fifty million dollars worth 
of films for morale purposes. She has refused to 
pay, insisting that the U. S. pay for them, as the 
order was supposed to be taken care of under lend-lease 
arrangement. 

His number is Dist. 7131
