Tape: #227  Sacred Harp       Summary

Tape 227 seems to continue from where tape 226 left off.
Mr. [Rogers]  [*H.M*] explains about accidentals and transposition.
They sing a song "Far La . . (?)" in round:  "Bells are ringing
what's the matter?"   Mr. Rogers then has the group do an
exercise in F minor.

There is more lecturing on singing, and then a recess . .
(talking during recess)

Mr. [Rogers] [*H.M*] continues talking about major and minor keys, and
methods to remember them:   Major Sharps -- "Go Down And Eat
Breakfast First";  Major Flats -- Five Boys Eat Apple Dumplings
Greedily";  Minor Sharps: -- "Every Boy Fine Can Get Dates";
Minor Flats: -- "Dr. Grainger Can Fix Bad Eyes."

Mr. [Rogers] [*H.M*]  says that in Sacred Harp a key is chosen for
convenience of singing, so that the Basses don't have to
"grant" and the trebles don't have to "scream."
He recounts a "pet slogan" of Uncle Tom Denson:  "If you don't
like this type of music you better get away from it, because
if you hang around it too much it'll get a hold of you and you
can't get away."  He explains that in Sacred Harp there is
6-part harmony, because both the Treble and the alto parts are sung
by both men and by women, each at their own octave.
Now the group sings #111, "Journey Home," first in solfa,
then with the words. 

[Mr. Rogers] [*H.M*] explains that in Sacred Harp music the tenor
carries the melody while the other parts provide the harmony.
