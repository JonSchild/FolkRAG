Ol' Rattler 

We have been told repeatedly by various Negroes on [the] Texas 
prison farms that they could outrun [?] any dog [and] or horse 
on the place, that they could leave the farm any [day]
hot day they took the notion. This assertion is to a 
some extent true. The convicts, who work all day every 
day under the broiling sun, driven by the guards, are in 
wonderful physical condition. The dogs, a breed of English fox-hounds, 
lie up in their pens most of the time; while the horses, 
a breed big-boned and clumsy, walk all day behind the 
men in the field and have no other excercise. 

Thus, if a man gets out of gun range, [xxx
xxx] control  [?] 
the thunder of horses' hoofs and the baying 
the hounds on his ears, and lays a careful and intricate 
trail through the bottoms, he is likely to get away. In the 
terrifying wet heat of the river lowlands, the dogs and horses 
will [founder] weary before the convict. That more men aren't lost on 
the prison farms is due to the efficiency of the guards, the 
fear of the men that,  if they are caught (and most of them are 
sooner or later) they will [?] lose their small privileges 
and their "good time" and the fact that there are few men with 
the courage and resolution to make [?]  a 
break away from a cocked shot-gun, [?] lay a [?] twisted trail through the
woods, and then leave their State for good.  They [?] either
[?] come back
to their families and their women and are [?] jailed again in the "pen,"
or are booked on a vagrancy charge.

Riley was one of the exceptions to this rule.  He outran old
Rattler and his pack, he winded the horses that were following,
"walked the Brazos River like Christ", and was never heard of
again.  [?]

He left Rattler on the bank "a-howlin'."  Rattler, probably
named after a [train] fast train, like his Louisiana
cousin, Red Ball, is the prototype of all good coon, possum and
"nigger" dogs in the deep South.  He figures in numerous songs.

[?]  This work-song should be sung with [?] gusto,
with shouts, with swift breath as if [?] the singer were
participating in the man-hunt or watching it or were
himself '?] fleeing through the bottoms with the dogs on his trail.
The refrain "Here, Rattler, Here," should [?] set the
dogs barking and howling for a half mile around.  We would
like to say definitely, but we cannot be sure, that this song [goes back' dates
back to the reconstruction period after the Civil War and is a sort of step-cousin
to "Run, Nigger, Run, the [?] [*or patter-roller*] Catch You."
