Mr. Whilock
Dear Sir, I am mailing you  
a copy of my book "Home on
Range" with this mail.

My contract with Publishers
called for 50 books to be sent
out for review, so far I have
not been able to locate a 
paper receiving one.  The book
was released Jan 1st. and I
believe that is ample time
for them be sent out.

This book is being very warmly
received here in this County.  
Mr. Reese is still alive.  His mind
very clear though he is bedfast.  He 
is 97 - and really enjoyed the book.

Sincerely
Mrs. Margaret A Nelson
