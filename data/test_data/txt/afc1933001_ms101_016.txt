My dear Mr. Lomax:
I read with interest the review in the Book Section of the Herald Tribune of March 9, and hope soon to see Adventures of a Ballad Hunter. Your interest in negro folksongs invites me to write you concerning one that I heard at a negro funeral near Cambridge, Maryland, 10 or 12 years ago which has been in my mind since. The church is located west of Cambridge on the road leading to the Crystler country place where Mr. Crystler has his duck blinds for hunting.
The verse runs something like this, though my recollection is not exact:
I'm gonna take my vacation in Hebben (thump, thump)
Whar de pine and de ebergreen grow, " "
I'm gonna take my vacation in Hebben " "
Whar de deer and de antelope roam. " "
(the thumps are done with the feet) 
The rythm is syncopated and there are many verses. If you do not have this ballad in your collection I am sure that your son or your scouts for music will find a rich field in and around Cambridge, Maryland. I am writing to your concerning this song because I have never heard it. Perhaps, however it is already in your collection.
Yours very sincerely
