got -- that what made the boy so bad, 'cause he would put
food there an' Cleo would still be hungry.  You know, and den, no
clo'es, no hair combed. . .She had long, black, pretty hair.  Just
like him; an' he had beautiful hair, hisse'f.  An' that child hair
would be all mangled an' tangled up.
     An' and then I like children so much, I keep pickin' at 'em
an' pickin' at 'em.  They asked me one day, would I keep 'er?  I
told 'em, I sure would!  An' I was delighted in keepin' 'er, there
with me.  An' so that's how she got kept until her aunt -- until his
aunt come from Georgia an' got her.

is born the same way.  You know, gonna grow up an' suffer the same
way.  But what. . .
AL:  Why did she do that?
BJ:  I mean she jus' was tellin' the peoples that, how they treat
the girl, God was gonna fix it so some of they chirrun's liable to
come into the same thing.  Because you gonna reap what ya sow.  An'
so that what she meant.
     An' she, she was sure -- [I heard] angry about it.  She tooken 'er, tooken
Cleo an' brought 'er back to Georgia.  I never heard no more from
'er, how she was. . .I heard how she was, but I ain't heard from 'er
