(AL)  they [aln] all had songs.  It was from them that we got "Tom Dooley,"
the song about the lonesome murder of the mountains that went all around
the world.  back in the early 60s.  Thanks for singing for us Frank, it's 
been a great honor to have you on the show.
Frank:  Thank you very much Alan,  for me too.  Thank you for letting me 
share this with everybody.  I hope they enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed it
being here.              (technical)
AL:  Ready?  Tell us about it....
Stan: [a] This is chickens a crowin' in the Sourwick Mountain there,  I'm 
goin' to try to play it for you fellows.  I don't get to play too much,
but I used to hear this a lot, and I had a... these old corn jugs... they 
got a corn cob stopper stuck in the jug, so I'm just gonna start... (plays)
AL:   That was real good!
Stan:    Thank you!  Well, I mean, roaming gamblers always doin' it and sing it.
 My lungs,  you know.....
