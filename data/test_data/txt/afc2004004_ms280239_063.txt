chap ran after him and said "Excuse me....." My God, I was in a rage. I said "Good" I said "I've herded that man into this ball and get him in with his pins in and you go and explode the whole thing. What do you think you're doing?" Oh, he was real sorry that he did it, but this chap..... We came home late and it came fresh.... and I've no idea what it is to drive on a fresh road with a horse and a sleigh, and only three year old and that dog-cart passed me, a man driving a dog-cart - that was too much for me and I said to this John Barr "Spring out". I said "We'll get snow. I'll pass him". But I said "We can't sit in the sleigh without snow" and we ran along and I did finish being in front of him, and I never knew who that man was till this day. And I came home in the morning. 
   This lad Matthew..... he was what they call the chaummer It's not the bothy - chaummer is the sleeping place. And he said to me one day "I had my father's place to manage....." (Cough)...... This lad, he said to me, "I was never out in the morning. I was often late and I wasn't working steady". And I said "You might be thankful I'm not out to see what you're doing". He took that in pretty good part and I came in to that on a Friday night. That was the night all the "Meals" were held mostly. About five o'clock in the morning.... if you'd seen that chap come out of his bed... He thought I was wakening him. I saw fine he wasn't having horrors, but he'd been having too much drink at the Feeing Market and I said "What's wrong with you?" "What way are you out here?" "Well, you know, I'm only on my road home from the ball and I thought I'd like to let you know I was up for once in my life." And I said "Michty, get back to your bed. The quicker the better." And I said, "I think you should stay in till you be rested. Please yourself."
