Fisk 16.4

Mr. Carrier says.  "Dave Coward,
See what you has done?
You left Florence at 12 o'clock
Done made it back at one."
         In my heart --
                --
Mr. Dave say, "Well, Mister Carrier
Let me have my way,
Let me run this same [train] spot
And I'll make 3 trips a day
            --
Mr. Carrier said, "No Dave Coward
Tell you in time,
Can't let you run this train no mo',
You'll have to run the nine
                                ---
Every body round Sardis told Mr. Carrier
"I know you got your way -
Mr. Ben is most too old a man
To run your train like Dave."
                                    ---
Last one Monday mornin
It come a shower of rain
9 come to Ballantine,
Goin like a fast train
                        ----
When the 9 got over to Sardis
Wid a large load of logs
Mr. C. told the people at the plant [yard]
It looks like the Yellow Dog -
