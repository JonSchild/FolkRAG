Dear Harold,
Sorry to have bothered you by wire, bu [I] it appeared to
be necessary. I have spent a couple of days in getting the
contacts the W.P. A. has and shall work out of Detroit for
a few days more before departing Northward. I should appreciate
your sending me some franked envelopes.
My visit to New York [has been very] will prove to have been
very productive. I saw Krimsky, even got tight with him one night,
and sold him on the idea of folk-lore in the fa ir and me
with it. He promised to let me know definitely in the next
month or so whether there would be a good job available. Actually
went so far as to have me interview the personnel officer. I
don't feel, howver, that it is yet time for you to intervene
your athority-- might scare them. Downes is as much interested
as ever and some what impressed by my progress with the Krimsky
crowd.
American Ballads Number 2 [appears] is in considerable of a
mess. The contract, I find, calls for only 400 pages and we have
already got together more than that amount of material. Therefore,
if you have done nothing about the Mexican stuff, hold it until
father gets back Sept. 5th.
In case the fair people wanted me to come back in September,
what would you advise me to do?
If you have not yet sent the Putnam records away, would you
mind holding back the record that contains "Go Down Old Hannah"
and "Ain't No Mo' Cane On the Brazis" for Ruth.
Here are several enclosures that will interest you. Give my
best to the staff. I'll write you in the next couple of days when
my plans are a little more definite.
Yours,
Alan
