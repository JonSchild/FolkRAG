I asked my doctor friend what I could do, honorably, and
he laughed and said "There is nothing the matter with you
but maybe you have had too many cocktails recently, so go
on a citrus fruit diet and it will drop."  I did so and 
I think the disturbance of the diet may have kept the
pressure readings, the citrus diet supposing to be for 
72 hours.  However, that really was what it was, if I had
gone on the diet sooner, because my blood pressure was down
to 130 a day or two after the examination. 

I intend to get into this war, in uniform, regardless
of time, expense or effort involved.  If William G. McAdoo
were still alive, I'd be in already, for he was close enough
to President Roosevelt to have called him up and asked him
to put me in, physical examination waived, if necessary,
and I think the President, who has the right, would have done\
so.  There is some law that an officer, having served ninety
days under a temporary commission, is eligible for regular
army retirement, and this is what they are afraid of.
However, I made no claim for any sort of compensation in the
previous war and although they tell me that you cannot
legally waive the statutory right of retirement, this should
be an evidence of the fact that I would never invoke it.
Of course, I am perfectly willing to sign any waivers.

I wonder if you know anyone who might have any 
suggestions to make in regard to the proper course of procedure
to go ahead and get in the army without a lot of foolishness.
I presume, since my blood pressure did not go down, the
doctors thought I had been taking something for it, and that
that was the reason for my complete disqualification, viz:
that it could not be reduced.  Of course, I can go on and
apply for another examination; may or may not get it.
I would accept limited duty, if necessary, although I would
always attempt to transfer to a line organization as soon as
the doctors saw fit.  It is a getting into the army that is hard;
once you are in they are more inclined to be lenient.

On the limited duty angles, I have plenty of
qualifications: as the former executive officer of a 
National bank that weathered the depression successfully,
as a public relations man, and  public speaker, as a lawyer,
as a "pep talk" man, and leader in group singing, as I have
an extremely powerful voice, once a great asset to a line
soldier but now only in specific cases, due to mechanization.

I have also had a great deal of experience as an
organizer, having been one of the co-organizers of the 
Hollywood Democratic Club, one of the greatest single
organizations in this county in 1932, and later, as the
