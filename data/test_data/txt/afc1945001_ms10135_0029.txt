Anecdote 

Recently, during one of the early 
morning drill, a soldier had a slight 
halt in one foot.  The drill sergeant 
yelled to the soldier "pick up them dogs". 
"Have you got an onion in your shoe"? 
"Naw" answered the soldier, "but Ive 
got a bunion that is seriously 
retarding the pilgrims progress". 

In world war no. 2, a soldier 
thought a jeep was a female Jap.
