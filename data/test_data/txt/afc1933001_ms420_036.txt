STANDARD COTTON BATTLE SONG
(Tune: Four Thousand Years Ago)

Now we know at Fisher No. 2 they had a fight
But it don't keep the boys from sitting tight
They took over the building too
And we all know it is true
For we know the union boys are never blue

Chorus:
We started working here about seven years ago
Not a job in the shop we do not know
For we've been around so long
And the company done us wrong
Now we started out to make them sing our song.

II
We sat down at exactly two-fifteen
And the bosses thought that we were mean
Oh, they left us here alone
And we are making this our home
If we left, the boys would soon begin to roam

III
Oh the cotton factory is a low paid place
And the cotton it is staring you in the face
When you ask for more pay
They would only turn away
For they think you can live and work this way.

IV
We worked fourteen hours a day
And the Stand rd Cotton's going to change its way 
We've been working in tha dust
Now the machines are going to rust
If the company don't settle up with us.

DOLLARS FROM CHRYSLER'S 
(Tune: Pennies from Heaven)

Everytime it rains, it rains
Dollars from Chryslers
Don't you know our strike contains
Dollars from Chryslers
You'll find your paychecks rising 
As we go along;
If we keep harmonizing
We can't go wrong.
Now, there's a pot of gold for you

If you'll keep your dues up
You can't get the things you love
If you don't pay up
So as the hours go by
Don't get low down or blue
There'll be dollard from Chryslers
For all of you

GOODY GOODY

So the Union boys have set you back on your heels
Goody, goody
So they're sitting down and now you know how it feels,
Goody, goody
So they're down in your plant too
They'll be sure to see it thru
And the women are behind them
Now how do you do?
So you lie awake,
Just singing the blues all nite
Goody, goody
Cause this union gang's a barrel of dynamite
Hurray and hallelujah
You had it coming to ya
Goody, goody for you
Goody, goody for us
And we hope you're satisfied
You rascal you 

ROCK A BYE BABY

Rock a bye baby, on the tree top
When you grow up you'll work in a shop
When you are married, your wife will work too
So that the rich will have nothing to do

Hush a bye baby, on the tree top
When you grow old your wages will stop
When you have spent the little you've made
On the scrap heap you then will be laid
([F?nt] to the power house, then to the grave)
