WHEN THE MAID COMES TO TOWN
(Tune: The Farmer Comes to Town)

When the maid she comes to town with her
arches broken down
Oh the maid she is the one who works the
most
If you'll only look and see
We think that you'll agree
That the maid she is the one who works
the most.

Chorus
The maid she is the one
The maid she is the one
Works all hours of the day
Then she goes to the gloom
Of her lonely little room
While the rest of the world goes by
(Last line is to be sung slowly)

Oh the mistress hangs around
While the maids about her work
Oh the maid she is the one who works the 
most.
If you'll only look and see,
We think that you'll agree
That the maid is the one who works the 
most

Chorus
The chauffeur and the cook
Go strolling by the brook
And the maid is the one who works the
most.
If you'll only look and see
We think that they will agree
That the maid is the one who works the most

Chorus

When the mistress goes to town
And the babies whine and frown,
Oh the maid she is the one who works the
most.
Even tho she tries her best
Just to get a little rest
There is no way to quiet them down.
