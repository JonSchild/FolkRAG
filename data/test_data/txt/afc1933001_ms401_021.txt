*Scratched Out Tyspescript*
An' if de boss keeps squabblin'  goin' to run me off,
Oh Hannah, go down;
An' if de boss keeps squabblin'  goin' to run me off,
Oh Hannah, go down!

Handwritten: 
Go down, old Hannah, don't you rise no mo'
Oh Hannah, go down
If you rise any mo' bring Judgment Day
Oh Hannah, go down.
