I didn' know what to do about that shimmey.  Me bein' young, too,
and not understandin' how to do.  I didn' what to do about that
shimmey!
     So it went on; one day -- He's a grand juryman.  He wen' over
town;  they had to go over town on jury.  They all went with him.
     So the boys had a room on the porch there.  Call it the
"shed room," you know?  An' ah, I went down there.  I had the key
to the house anyway.  You know, 'cause I wanted to go in there to
do anything, work, I could do it, or call 'em up for anything.  You
know, ta -- like that an' diffrunt thrings.  That's the first telephone
I talked on was at they house.
     An' so?  I went down there an' I went into the boys' room.
Didn't have to unlock it. Went in the boys' room an' I stood there an'
I looked.  An' I went -- I reached right behin' that do' where they
got old clo'es there. An' I hung that shimmey 'way back side
there.  Left it there.  I went on.  Ah, that was up in there, like
August.
     The next year, after Christmas, one day, she was takin' out
ol' clo'es to give peoples, you know, an', an' old things th' too
lil' for the boys an' whatnot.  An' she hollered an' called me.
I went down there; I didn' know what happened.  I forgot all about it.
     "What you reckon?"
     I said, "What?"
     "I found my shimmey-she."  She called it "shimmey-she."
"Found my shimmey-she!"
     I said -- I couldn't what she was talkin' about.  I forgot
about it, ya know? Ah, so, I jus' kep' on an' so after a while she
made me think of it.  I said, "Oh, you did fin' it?"
     Said, "Yeah, I foun' it," said, "I'm so glad," said, "I didn'
know where in the world that shimmey-she. . . "
