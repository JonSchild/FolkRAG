Dear Dr. Spivack:

I understand Dr. Lund, Chief of our Community and
Family Services Section, has talked to you about making
some copies of records of American ballads in your
files. These records would be used by Miss Margaret
Valiant, a member of our staff, in a program to be given
at the Shafter Labor Camp, California, later this month.

I should appreciate it if you could arrange to have
these copies made and through Mr. Seeger have them sent
to Miss Valiant.

Sincerely yours,
John O. Walker
