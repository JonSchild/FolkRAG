Arkansas Nine Wallops Atlanta To Re-Take Top Berth; Jim Trexler In Three-Hit Exhibition Blanks Crax 

(By United Press)
Once again the Little Rock Travelers are leading the Southern Association. They whipped the Atlanta Crackers last night, 6 to 0, behind a brilliant three-hit pitching job by southpaw Jim Trexler.

Trexler had a no-hit game in hand until Paul Richards, Cracker skipper, spoiled it with one away in the eighth. Jim walked one batter but faced only 27 batters officially. Two Cracker runners were wiped out in double-plays.

Jim Oglesby’s triple with Tommy McBride on base in the second would have been enough to win, but the Travelers added a run in the seventh and four more in the eighth.

The other chief contender, Nashville, divided a doubleheader with the New Orleans Pelicans. The Pels won the first game, 6 to 4, in ten innings, as southpaw Bill Seinsoth won his 16th game of the year.

Nashville took the second, 5 to 3, with Dutch McCall gaining his 8th win of the year against only one defeat.
    Chattanooga defeated Memphis, 8 to 1, as southpaw Bill Kennedy of the Lookouts won his sixth game. The win placed the Lookouts within striking distance of sixth place.
    In an afternoon game at Knoxville, the Barons pounded out 14 hits and received seven bases on balls while the Smokies made only six hits and drew one walk. Nevertheless, the Smokies won the game six to five. Dick Coffman and Red Evans divided the hurling chores for the winning Smokies with Evans getting credit for the win.

The same teams meet again today with Little Rock playing a doubleheader at Atlanta, Birmingham playing at Knoxville, Memphis at Chattanooga and New Orleans at Nashville.
