Tape:  #225 Sacred Harp Summary

This tape continues the conversation between AL and Mr. and
Mrs. Roberts of Ephasis, Georgia.  Mr. Rogers recounts an
anecdote to show the lighter side of singin' meetings.
AL then requests them to sing "Present Joys."
They then sing "#101" in sol-fa (There are only four notes
in this song:  la, sol, fa, and then do.  The note "do" is
voiced "sol" by the singers.)  AL requests them to repeat
the song with the words, which they do.  Then they sing
another song, #343:  "Oh! What a happy time when the Christians
all get home. . ."; upon request, they repeat in another version.
In the next section, Mr. Rogers talks about his family,
who came to Georgia from Wales via South Carolina.  He talks
a little about family life and family discipline.
Mrs. Rogers mentions their love of antiques, and the next
section is a display of various items:  a drinking gourd,
a cowbell, a framing square, part of a gear for oxen,
a railroad lantern, a (re)strainer, an old pump, a milk
screener, and etc.
Mr. Rogers explains that his is a community of small farms,
not of big plantations. Therefore life is neighborly, and
centers around the church.
AL asks about square dancing.  Mr. Rogers said that it was
"a very popular sport" but that his father did not allow him
to attend.
In the next section, AL talks to Mr. Denson.  This section
was a little difficult to understand. Mr. Denson talks about
the time he had a farm, and claims to be the first person in
the area of the country to plant strawberries.
AL asks him what his favorite song is, if he had one.
He answered that if there was a song that he would want to be
sung at his funeral, it would be "Come, let us join our friends
above. . . "  (#185??)
