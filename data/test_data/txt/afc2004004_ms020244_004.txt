                                 THROW ME OVERBOARD

CHORUS:     Throw me overbo',                 )
                    I've found a hidin' place.        ) (4)
                    Well, God told Jonah,
                    "Well, go to Nineveh land,"
                    Said, "I want you to go there
                    "At my command."

                    But Jonah decided
                    That it would not be.
                    Lawd, he made up his mind
                    That he would run away.       (Sayin')    (CHORUS)

                    Oh, Jonah went down
                    By the tidey shore,
                    And he met up with a ship
                    Makin' ready to go.

                    He paid his fare,
                    Lawd, he got on board,
                    Then the ship went driftin'
                    On down the shore. (Cryin')                  (CHORUS)

                    Well, the ship drift on
                    On down the shore,
                    Lawd, the storm did rise
                    And the wind did blow.

                   Captain on the ship,
                   He got trouble in mind,
                   "Wonder what the matter is?"
                   His ship wouldn't sail.

                   Lawd, he sent a man down
                   To search the ship,
                   And he searched the ship
                   From bottom to top
                   An' he found a man there
                   Fast asleep.

                   He said, "Wake up, wake up,
                   "Don't sleep," so the man said,
                   " My God is angry,
                   " Gonna destroy this land."        (Said)    (CHORUS)

                   Ol' Jonah rose up,
                   An' a might shout,
                   Said, "I am the man,
                   "I want you to cast me out."                     (CHORUS)

                   Well, they cast ol' Jonah
                   Right overbo',
                   Along come a whale
                   And swallowed Jonah whole.
