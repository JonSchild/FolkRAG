through there!  That was up there in (unintelligible-sounds
like "Cotton Pen"), Arkansas.
A.L.:
     You had different songs for them, didn't you?
--than you had for mules.
W.B.:
     Oh no, I didn't never tell em nothin but,
"Gee, Jane" an "Haw, Bob".  That's all I ever tol em.  But now,
you see when they get hot?, --you could be takin em down by
Lake (Wakeson?)
there. .
B. Gordon:
     In the water they go!
W.B.:
     When they'd get hot, you'd had to have em
under mighty good control.  When they hoofs get hot they would
go in that. . .
B.G.:

that cracker down the side of em an let it pop- I was coming
down side of back (Black?) river, out from (unintelligible),
Arkansas.  I never will forget it.  I had a nice a load of
Cypress logs that you ever saw, on a  two-wheeled, rubber
trailer.  And Bob looked down there and you saw that water. .

fell over against him.  And I'd pick it up and drop it over
Jane's head?, and hit Bob aside the ear?, I'd say, "Gee,
Bob!", and he'd turn around in the cotton fields.  That whip
ruined a bull!
B.G.:
     And he get hot, he'd go in that water.
W.B.:
     But when he get hot --and I used to drive
