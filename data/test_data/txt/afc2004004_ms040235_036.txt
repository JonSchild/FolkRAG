Dear Finlay,

It was nice that we had a long drink together Sunday night and it was too bad that you had to wash the car the next day.  I hope not personally, although the ringmaster seemed as if he didn't care whether you did it personally or not.  At any rate it was a nice drink and I wish we had more of them.  If we do have more, let them be in London or New York, at least for a while.  I confess that I was overwhelmed by your particular part of the world, but I sincerely believe (although I am not entirely sure), that you helped me to combat the severe attacks of Presbyterian conscience that kept overwhelming me in Glasgow, nearly drowning me the first two weeks of September.

Seriously, you were most kind and it wasn't always easy for you to be kind I know, but I hope to return the favour to you in kind some day.  If you hear any kind words spoken about "Over the Sea to Skye", you might pass them along.

All the best to you and your handsome lady, and by the way, to Shirley.

Yours,

Alan Lomax.
