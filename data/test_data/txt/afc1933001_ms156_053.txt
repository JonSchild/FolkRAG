Dear Alan:

I am sorry that I missed your 'phone call last Tuesday afternoon.

Woodie came down Friday morning, and we recorded twelve sides which
included the following:

DUSTY OLD DUST
THE GREAT DUST STORM
DUST BOWL BLUES
BLOWIN' DOWN THIS ROAD
DO RAY ME
DUST BOWL REFUGEE
AIN'T GOT NO HOME IN THE WORLD ANY MORE
VIGILANTE MAN
TALKIN' DUST BOWL BLUES
PRETTY BOY FLOYD
TOM JOAD (Parts 1 and 2)

[*Ans - May 3*]

I'm going to have him come in one day this week and record another 
number called, I think, DUST PNEUMONIA.

I am planning to put these out in two albums of six sides each. If
you have any thought on the possible groupings, I would appreciate 
your indicating them to me. I am sure that I have you to thank for
swinging Woodie our way,  in view of the high offer which Columbia made
to him.

I think I have things about worked out with Leadbelly if I can only
convince the powers that be that it is all right to list him on Victor
with the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet and on Bluebird for his solos. I
hope that you can relax now and get a good rest. I will let you know
when I have the Leadbelly agreement worked out and then we can arrange
for the recordings with the Golden Gate boys.

Many thanks to you and my best wishes.

Sincerely yours,
Bob
