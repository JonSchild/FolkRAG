I mailed your album tall tails in song

have played the album, sounds of the south
and have played it for several of
My Friends, and we like it very much
and have had several people to ask where
they can get it and the price
did it ever ocur to you that a small record
that could be used in the JuteBoxes
whith paddy on the turnpike on one side
and Jesse James as I sang it on the other
side might go over good. am always

getting Better for the last  6 months
as ever your Friend
               Neal Morris
