Miss Irene Carlisle
Fayetteville, Arkansas

Dear Miss Carlisle:

I enjoyed your feature story about Vance
Randolph, and am interested to learn that you are
yourself a collector. Perhaps you can give me some
idea of the work you have already done, and the
material that is available to you for recording.
We like to keep our files on collectors and material
as up to date as possible.

The check list is not yet ready for
general distribution, but I have put your name on
the list and you will be mailed a copy as soon
as it is ready.

Cordially,

Alan Lomax
