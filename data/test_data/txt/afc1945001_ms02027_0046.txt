POLICEMAN
In Indianapolis there aren't any policemen who walk beats. All patrolling is done by motorcycle and squad car men. As a consequence, the man selected to head-up the rumor collection was Lieutenant Eddie Rawls, head of the Subversive Squad, who has a large detail working under him. Their activities take them to every section of the city.
