I said, I don't steal it.  How you get it?  I told him, for
two buckets of dirt.  And I learned that.  He said, I can't believe that.
I liked it so much. . . .that's the way I got it., I got
the harmonica.  I was small, had about maybe 7 years old.
AL:  Where did you get your fiddle style?  I love it.
Dion:  I don't know.  There are two fiddle players around here
that has the same style of playing.  I learned, I guess I was
12 years when I started playing on it, and I used to hear
different players you know.  I heard, like I told you a while
ago, when I heard this fiddle playing with the accordion, we
could hear the fiddle, at that time, over the accordion, but
playing beautiful, thta's why I love that music so much.
My grandfather, I wish I could have had my  grandfather's
fiddle.  He had an old time fiddle, and when he died, I
was just a young kid at the time, and some older in the
family got the fiddle.  But my daddy played the accordion.  I
was a young kid and I remember we was 11 in the family, and
he'd get--at that time we had a chimney, you know in the
wintertime---and entertainment, there was no television, no
telelphone, the only entertainment he had was playing the
accordion.  But he played dances when he was young, but as I
got older, Iwent for fiddle instead of accordion.
AL:  YOUr father was named. . . . . .
Dion:  Alcide Dion.  Both of my grandfathers were Dion.  I was
born in 1915. . . . . . 68 years old. . . . . 27th June, 1915.  Yeah,
these years are creeping down on us.
