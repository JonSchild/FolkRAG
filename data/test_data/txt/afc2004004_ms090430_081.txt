by his policy of "cooperation with the white officials." The brick building
which houses the high school was constructed by the boys and girls of the
school, under the direction of the principal, who is a brickmason. This
building was a reward to the Negro community for the students of Geeter High
School because they helped build the white high school in the community. These
two schools are similar in their design and equipment. The Geeter School has
a cafeteria operated by the students, a library, a drum and bugle corps, a
choral club, which is reputed to be one of the best in the state; an active
parent-teacher association, and several clubs. The students participate in
all the local and state contests, and usually win honors in these events.

A second large school in the county is the Shelby County Training
School, located between Woodstock and Lucy, Tennessee. This school maintains
a boarding department to take care of those students whose homes are at some
distance from the school. Students may pay their room and board either in
cash or in produce, but since few families have cash money most of the students
pay in produce. Opportunities for work are given the students, to assist
in their maintenance. A new frame structure, with nine classrooms and
a combination gymnasium and chapel, has been added this year, to give the
school a total of six buildings. The buildings have running water, steam
heat and electricity. There are 411 students, 13 teachers, and a matron.

Barrett's Chapel, the third high school in Shelby County, is located
about thirty miles north of Memphis, near Arlington, Tennessee. The
frame building, which is only about two years old, is not entirely adequate.
There are twelve grades for a nine-room school.
