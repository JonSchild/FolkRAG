Dr. Harold Spivacke -- 3
September 4, 1941

This is a dull letter, but Elizabeth and I were driving last night until four o'clock and I've been hard at it all day long.

For the first time since I have been working for the Library, I'm beginning to feel that we're doing a job which interests me intellectually.

My very best regards to you and your live wire department.

Yours very truly,
