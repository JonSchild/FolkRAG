Tape: 891 cont. Nimrod Workman + Phyllis 3

She dig [her]his grave in her own [grave]backyard,
Dug it down 6 x 2
Just lay right there lovin' Henry she said,
til the meat drop from your bones,
And that girl that you left in New Orleans
Will think youre a long time coming home. 

Fly down, fly down, you pretty little bird
And rest upon my [head] knee
I'll make you a [grave]nest? as pure as gold
And hang it on a willow tree

I can't fly down nor I won't fly down
And rest upon your knee
Cause a girl that would murder her own true love
Would kill a little bird like me

If I had my [feet of gold]cedar bow, [an] Arrow in my string
I'd shoot a dark      through your heart
And no more you'd sit and sing

Well if you had your cedar bow
Arrow in your string, 
I'd fly [me] to the top of yen tall tree (?)
And there I'd sit and sing

AL: Is that a song that happened in Kentucky or what?
Nimrod: Yeah, I wrote that song. That was a fella had
two girlfriends, one of 'em was in Kentucky. He likes the
one that was away from Kentucky, but the one in Kentucky
liked him better than the other one did. And so he wasn't
going to go talk to her, and she leaned over across the fence
to give him a kiss, and she stabbed and killed him. That was
true. And she killed him and she buried him in her own
backyard. . . . . I don't know who wrote that song, but I learned
it. . . I mean I don't know who started the story, but I wrote 
the song. . .Lovin' Henry
