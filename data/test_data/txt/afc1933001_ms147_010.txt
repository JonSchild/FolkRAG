CENTRAL STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE
MOUNT PLEASANT, MICHIGAN

July 20, 1939

Mr. Alan Lomax

Washington, D. C.

My dear Mr. Lomax:

   Indeed I do know your father.  I have enjoyed his cowboy
appearances.  He has always been welcome at Central State and
always will be.  In your AMERICAN BALLADS AND FOLKSONGS (one)
he used two of my collected pieces.  He certainly can have
LITTLE BROWN BULLS;  I hope he can give me credit somehow for
having collected it.  That mention will be sufficient recognition.

   Summer session is out on August 4.  Fall semester begins on
September 26.  I shall be ready to aid you or your father any
time in October. I have lined up a few more sources for you,
sources about as as good as Perry Allen of Shepherd and Bill
McBride of Isabella City.  There is Chris Peterson of Bay City,
Fred Scribner of West Branch, Zeke Marsh of Mio, Bill Ellis
of Oscoda, "Mayor" Nolan of Camp Sixteen.

   I hope you men are able to appear when I am in the
territory.  I shall be glad to have either of you use my
home as headquarters.

Yours very truly,

E. C. Beck,
E. C. Beck

What about sending me a couple of
Bill's records?
