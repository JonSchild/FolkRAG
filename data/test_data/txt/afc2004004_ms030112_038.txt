GARY: 
you understand. You believe that when I tell you.
LARRY: 
I know that.
GARY: 
You can't do it. These people come to these places
you understand their guts is cutting in two [to there golden shows].
LARRY: 
And they'll take anything.
GARY: 
They'll work for nothing. I don't care what debts you
got to pay you understand the man come to set you out doors
and you can't ask for nothing you know what I'm talking about.
It ain't the man that set you out there, its hungry people
coming from other places coming in set you out there. And listen
whiles Iâ€™m talking I want you to listen to this. Talking about
stick ups and hold ups and what not and so on. Hear what
I start to say, I'm going to say it now. Only thing I [ain't] blame 
a hoodlum for, you know what that is  Grab you and you ain't got but
2, 3 hundred dollars and knock you in the head you understand
and take your money and they get caught. They ain't got enough
to pay a lawyer you understand, you know what I'm talkin about?
Now you remember me saying just awhile ago, If you gonna get anything
you gotta put your life in it. You hear what I say. Now if you, 
that ain't whats in it its the pistol ball shotgun custard. You 
understand. I'm talking about the toughest way, now. I'm talking
about. Go down to Wall street where the money is, your'e gonna
die anyhow, you understand. Hear what I say.
