Pop Goes the Weasel (in sets of eight)
Words: Head couple lead to the right
And balance there so easy
Then all join hands and circle half
Pop! Goes the weasel.

A penny for spool of thread
A penny for a needle
That's the way the money goes
Pop! Goes the weasel.

My Mary's got the whooping cough
Johnnie's got the measles
That's the way the money goes
Pop! Goes the weasel.

The second couple leads to the right -- and so on.

Formation: Sets of eight players, a man and a woman standing on
each side of a hollow square, couples numbered to the
right one to four.
Couples join inside hands.

Action: Number one couple starts by moving into square to the right
to stand facing couple number two (first line). All four
players bow (second line). All four join hands and circle
eight steps to the left half way around the circle (third
line). Couple number two raises arms, first couple passes 
under (fourth line), and on to the third and fourth couples
in turn. When the first couple has completed the evolutions
the second couple starts, later the third and fourth. (twelve
verses in all).

Pop Goes the Weasel (in large circle)
Formation: Couples with inside hands joined facing center in a large
circle.
Action: Play as for eights above, except when first couple gets to
fourth couple, then second couple starts with third couple,
and so on continuing around circle, a new couple starting
when the couple next to them is free. Always "Pop" the moving
couple toward the center of the large cirle.

Pop Goes the Weasel (in three's)
Formation: Three abreast in large circle, hands joined or elbows
linked, facing in line of march (counter-clockwise).
Action: Players march forward to words, "A penny for a spool of
thread, a penny for a needle, that's the way the money
goes." On word "Pop" all jump in air; on landing outside
players stand still and the center player moves on to the
two who are waiting ahead to the words, "Goes the Weasel."
Continue if group is not too large, until the original three 
are united again.
