JOHN A. LOMAX ' ROUTE 4 BOX 341 FOREST HILLS ' DALLAS TEXAS 
Dear Mr. Strunk: 
Alan and I have a large 
number of records stored which 
we will put into your hands 
before winding up this years work 
(it may not be possible to get 
them to you until after January!) 
I hope we can bring them records
with the accompanying manuscript 
and [put them in] with you [?]
on some suitable and convenient
plan for cataloging, possibly 
assisting with this work so 
as to be sure that it is done
properly.  We shall be busy
from now on in the effort
to cover more territory before
the end of the year.
Sincerely
John A. Lomax
