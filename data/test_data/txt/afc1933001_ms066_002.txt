Dear Mr. Gouger,

We are very much pleased to have your recent letter 
and especially glad that the Porters liked our Christmas
greeting.  You may be sure that the invitation implied 
is sincere.  We should be happy to have your grandparents 
visit us here in our home, for we were delighted with their 
genuinely gracious kindliness and we came away from Falfurrias 
with the feeling that we had found real friends,- 
this aside from the help which Mr. Porter gave with his fiddle 
tunes.

I have referred to Dr. Harold Spivacke,Chief of the 
Music Division of the Library of Congress, your request for 
copies of your grandfather's recordings.  He will do whatever 
is possible.

You have our very best wishes for the new year.

Yours very truly,
John A. Lomax,
John A.Lomax

Go down to [???igton]
and tell Mr. Spivacke what you
work.  He's human, too. J.A.L.
