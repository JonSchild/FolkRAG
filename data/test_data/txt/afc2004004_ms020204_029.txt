Vera Hall, page 6, reel 9...
My mother  always told me that 'ligion never was desire to
make your pleasure less.And so that's is my pleasure  to hear
and I likes it now to go where it is if I kin. For they never
did say anything to us about goin down there-- we be to church
on Sunday, go to  Sunday school Sunday mornin and then stay
through service. I never did  go down there on Sundays, but I 
sho would go through the week.
A: Do you still go?..
V: When I'm at home...
A: In Tuscaloosa?
[*A certain crowd gets together for parties-*]
V: I don't go [there] so much in Tuscaloosa. I been  twice, 
I mean I been jist sinul...Sometime our crowd git together---
at least the geng that I sociate with-- [the] some ladies and their
husbands--/ so we-we--- it ain't what you do, it's the way that you
do it--if you just let other peoples know what you doin, you
can do most anything, I believe-- so I like to take a drink
sometime but I just don't take it wid everybody-- I got a 
certain crowd there that we gets together and  their husbands
