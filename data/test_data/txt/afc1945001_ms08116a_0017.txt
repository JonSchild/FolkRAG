1. What color is the American [bebedes?] that
the soldiers wore I would like to
know but I was told to ask the
"Japs" they are the only one caught
them with their breaches down.

2. Mary don't be jealous of Bob, that the
very reason all the boys have to leave school
for the army, just because of some nations being
jealous.

3. Zuck to Hitler and all of his men
Soon as later they will be in the silver den
Will they come out no not one
Because the burning blaze will cook them done

4. Jack said, Dad you fought in world war no I and what
did you get for it, and now I have got to fight
If I don't get my rights there won't be any
rights for no one else.
