Mr. Alan Lomax, specialist in folk music at the
Library of Congress, will be in New York City
teaching during the month of January at New York
University. We have approached him on the possibility
of assisting in the training of this folk-song 
group and he is willing to spend several days
or evenings a week in assisting you. He has access
to all the folk song collections of the Library of
Congress, Federal Music Project and Farm Security
Administration, and others, and himself is able to
sing these songs in the native idiom. You might be
able to employ his part time on the project during
the month of January. Please let us know as soon
as possible if we can assist you in making arrangements
for obtaining his services.

D. A rhythm band made up of about 12 small children
would perform for 15 minutes once a week. These
children would be participants and would appear
only in the morning or early afternoon. You would
be able to take a different group each week from
the city program.

E. It has been asked that the bandshell be left free
for at least 15 minutes each day to accomodate any
other special program that might be developed on
the Recreation program in New York City during the
summer.

The number of persons suggested for each of these events
probably should be doubled so that at least two groups will
be trained in each event. It might be well to alternate
the groups by performances or by days in order to get their
working hours on the project. This alternation of workers
and training of double staffs will apply to demonstrators
and to persons operating in the court as well as those performing
in the bandshell. You know of course that the exhibit
is now scheduled to be open from April 30 to November
1 and from 10:00 AM to 10:00 each day.

II. The Auditorium

We have submitted no plans for regular use of the auditorium
prefering to use the more informal band shell. We have,
however, requested that the auditorium be left free at least
one hour each day to accomodate any special events developed
on the city recreation porgram during the summer which are
suitable for presentation at the fair. We have also requested
that provision be made for rearranging the auditorium
schedule in case inclement weather makes use of the bandshell
impossible.
