Mr. Archibald MacLeish, Librarian, 
The Library of Congress 
Washington, D. C.

Dar Mr. MacLeish: 

After my experience in the posts near Washington in recording 
the songs the men know, in teaching them others and in 
preparing The White House program, I feel I can make the following 
recommendations for an Army Music Program. 

In general, the program must allow for and follow the 
desires of the men. Their tastes can be taken as the absolute 
criterion for the program and supplemented by tentative suggestions 
from time to time.    

There is an enormous and basic interest among the white 
soldiers, the youngsters, in "hill-billy music", that is quite 
American folk song, plus a certain amount in popular song. Basic 
guitar, harmonica, mandolin, banjo and fiddle, in that order of 
importance. A great many of the boys know how to play these instruments 
extremely well in the folk style, others can play a few 
chords, yet others wish to learn. Very few have instruments of  
their own and those that do are afraid to bring their instruments
to camp. 

A great many of the boys know cowboy songs and others 
white folksongs and like to sing them individually and in small 
groups. Few know as many verses and tunes as they would like to 
know. 

Therefore, I should like to propose the following: 

1. To furnish the words for songs (cowboy songs, hill-
billy songs, sentimental songs, popular songs, folk 
songs) in leaflet, pamphlet, and song sheet form.   

2. To furnish similar types of songs on records. 

a. Select commercial records 
b. Select Library of Congress records 
c. Other records to be specially recorded in the field 
for the Library for this purpose.
