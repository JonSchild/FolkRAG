I were licking one now. It's 
the symbol for the firely hearth 
& the flame of the altar. I knew
the other way round - the flame 
of the hearth being masturbation for
the sweet entrance to the female 
genitals - no fucker no friggat
& so sweet & so dangerous 
I wish I were in the Doctor's 
wife now.

Actually its only because 
I've had a lot of gins that 
I'm writing this way now. 
The last few days have been 
almost empty of sex.  Drab
color but subtle color
