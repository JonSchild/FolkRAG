BJ TAPE 17, p. 7

          So anyway, we wen' on [there] an' got down to the bridge,
where nobody would bother me or nothin'.  Got to the bridge.  Then,
that where it started at.  'Liz'beth, she wan'd know why [I cared] Carolyn 
[a] pick at me; [(?) 'counta'] Carolyn she. . .'bout what she, what she's do to me,
all them things. . .an' so. . .
AL:       Carolyn was the sister of these boys, wasn't she?
BJ:       Tha's right.  This one sister, um-hum.  An' two guy-- two
boys, both was bad.   Well, I wasn't sayin' anything.  An' boy, when
she tol' -- Carolyn was goin' there at me; I knowed Carolyn was
gonna hit me, because I just know she was.  She hadn't never hit
me but in my mind, I know what she wa' gonna do, ya see?  An' I
know 'Liz'beth gonna whup me if I didn't fight 'er, ya know?  An'
there I was, see?
          [They] An' Carolyn: "Yeah, I'll. . .Yeah, I'll. . .Beat 'er. I"  -- When she
[broke up that stuff] brushed herself up there [an gi it to] against me, I jus' brought
'er right -- I jus' grabbed 'er, ha, ha!  When I grabbed 'er,
you see, she jus' -- I mean, she wasn', she wasn' 'specting that,
I know.  But I grabbed 'er with all I had. An' I was. . .strong. . .
I musta been stronger than I thought I was, ya know?   An' I
jus' grabbed her; it was right at the bridge.  I just turnt her
like that, an' boy!  An' I give 'er one of the hardes' pushes I
could push, an', boy, an' her-- see, her weight carried her.  She
was stout, an' she was a lil' taller than I was, too.  And she
was stout. An' her weight jus' carried her.  I guess by grabbin'
['er,] too, ya know.  An' she missed the bannister.  She had to miss
it, 'cause she hit the creek.
          An', boy, she hit that creek; 'Lizabeth (or Mae?) didn't have
time to grab her or nothin'.  They didn't know what had happened,
it was so quick, it's done so quick.  Right at the edge of the
bridge, almost, but you had to hit that water.  It's a big creek.
