Wife whose husband has been assigned to drive a peep was told by friend, 8-12-42:

Young business woman to another whose brother just enlisted in Signal Corps, 8-12-42:
"The Signal Corps is the most dangerous branch of the service. The men go first
and string wires and things without any protection. The casualty rate is very high."
Wife with husband in service, 8-13-42: "Bill has been made an Acting Sergeant and
it won't be long before he will be a full sergeant. He's been promoted because all
the other men go away from camp and drink and carouse around and he usually behaves
himself and stays at camp, and that's why he's gotten ahead."
Veteran official, 8-14-42: "Mothers and fathers are glad to hear that conditions
in camps are better than they were in the last war, but we need to hear more about

Business man, 8-12-42: "There goes a jeep. I wonder how much gas it uses. Of

Officer has said, "Now you can tear up your draft card. This is entirely voluntary.
There is no draft in this program. If you want to be really dirty, tear it up and
send the pieces back to the draft board."
