MEMORANDUM 

TO:  Mr. R. Keith Kane
         Assistant Director

FROM:  Eugene Katz,
              Chief, Special Services

RE:         RUMOR

This does have special area connotations and points up 
the need for intelligent rumor analysis. Whether the suggested plan 
would work out for us who have ethnic as well as geographic groups to 
worry about, I doubt.  But, I am sure that it would be helpful to 
the Naval Centers where special Naval rumors can do so much harm.

Will Stevens, Managing Editor, Vallejo Morning Times-Herald 
is the kind of guy we could use in Special Services Division.
