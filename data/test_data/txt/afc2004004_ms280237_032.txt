I'd go anywhere to hear anything o' that. (pause) If there was 
anybody singing the old songs, you know, I'd sit there a week. My 
ears are open. (laughs) 

Lomax: It sounds like a mighty nice boyhood you had, Harry? 

Cox: Oh, I had a good time. We. . .(pause) I never too no harm, I 
tell you. I used to be about a lot with my father, an' he put me 
into all these here jobs. I used to go with him. . .when he was a-mowin'. 
"Come on," he used to say, "try yourself." Oh. . .I mean, 
I weren't very old; I used to have a go, fairly, and then I go. . . 
Still kept a-goin', tryin', as I got older; an' then I did get 
[fairly tire] kind o' fairly tired. I could - I could go an' do that, 
I could go an' mow a piece or anythin' as good as the next - comes 
to that. (sniffs) Never be afraid on it. (pause) He drilled it 
into me, an' I. . .an' everything he told me, I - I tried to foller, 
in every way. I always done so, all o' me life. Anybody told me 
anything for my benefit, like, I used - I studied that. I didn't 
kick against it; I was always out to try an' learn. You tell 
anybody anything, they won't listen to you - er - they'll go a 
mile round to do this here, where you could go an' do it in half 
the time. That's how some people are. . . You could go out on a job, you'll 
show 'em the proper way - they'll go an do somethin' quite the [o] 
opposite. I mean, you could go an' do it, time they are - lookin' 
at it. Well, I studied all o' them sort o' things, and the best 
way out o' anything, I always followed that. 

Lomax: What did your father - how did he counsel you to lead your 
life, Harry? Did he give you any kind of. . .proverbs, or maxims, or 
guidance. Do you remember what he told you to do? 

Cox: Well,. . .he used to tell us how to go to work to do things. 
He - he never warned us. . .I never was warned about anything in any 
way. (pause) Never. 

Lomax: Was it a religious family, Harry? 

Cox: No. Well, noe of 'em 
Now, my mother, she belonged to the church, an' she used to foller 
that all our young time. Then she had her hands full, an' she 
[han] hadn't much of a chance to go anywhere, seein' after us lot. 
When we used to go in for our meals - I know when she hasn't had 
time to sit down, waitin' on us lot. Pourin' the tea out, cuttin' 
up bread. Oh dear, I never see job like it. Time she done it. . . 
well, she never had time to sit down, hardly. 

Lomax: Was she a sweet woman; a kindly, sweet woman, and happy, 
or was she. . .? 

Cox: Oh yes, she was - she was happy. She used to - she could 
sing one time, fairly. (pause) Yes, she never made herself on edge 
about anything. She used to take it all a good way. She got
