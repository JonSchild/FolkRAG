2) The liveliest of all the Hebridean song styles is the 
walking song, where the women hand-shrink the home-made 
tweed.  The repertory of these songs literally endless.  
Most of them are love songs and they have been the 
exclusive property of women for hundreds of years and 
reflect in a way that I have not met anywhere before 
the feminine point of view.  The poetry is of a very 
high order, the songs are old and beautiful and vigorous, 
to say the least, and taken together you have an insight 
through them of the fantasy life of women that is 
presented nowhere so frankly and so ly

A little guy named K.C. Craig spent about ten years 
living in the damp stone houses of the island of South 
Euist making a collection of these songs, published at 
his own expense and sold it from door to door literally.  
It would be a great contribution to British literature 
and to the Gaelic revival to enable them to translate 
these songs and get them published in English as well as 
Gaelic.

I propose a programme devoted to the life of women 
in the Hebrides in ancient times and it will be a very 
lively programme, I can tell you, in which we use 
Mr. Craig as researcher and translater.
