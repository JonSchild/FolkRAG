Fisk, 23. 4.

soft I just had my mind just for killing.

So his partner come running dow there with a Winchester. They had to
pick me up because the boy was a fresh shot and my poor, he stayed there.
He's an old man now. He'd come out there in the morning. I believe I
a pickpocket. And so they come arunning dow there with a Winchester.
"Who done that shooting?" I said, "Where are--me." The Winchester
ought to be full of field. I would have started. I worked the next
day. My boss come and told me I sure am gonna git thehand-boss.

Levee Holler.

Oh, oh, my,
Oh, Oh, my Lord.
I'm always start working
For thirteen.
Just start anchor by
Wit the wagon,
With the blowgun team.

Oh, my Charlie,
Oh, my Charlie.
I don't want no mo
Bill-Blue molasses
With the curb on the can
Oh, Lordie,
With the curb on the can.

Come on, Baby, Pray.
I shake my head.
I don't want to leave
Until you understand.
Cause Mr. Charlie
He told me
Early befo I left the town.

Well, I went to the river hole.
Well, I looked across.
There was no ferryboat there,
And I want to cross.
Well, I looked around
My wonder.
I saw no good in.

But I changed my name.
Befo you git mad.
Didn't want to stayed.
Well, the captain[t] looked at the water boat
And the water boiling.
You're a fiend, oh, captain,
Kick the waterboat in.

Oh, Lordie,

Well, I got playing,
