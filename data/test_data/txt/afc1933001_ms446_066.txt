No. 51

O, when shall I see Jesus,
     And reign with Him above,
And from the flowing fountain
     Drink everlasting love?
When shall I be delivered
     From this vain world of sin,
And with my blessed Jesus
     Drink endless pleasures in?

But now I am a soldier,
     My Captain's gone before;
He's given me my orders,
     And bid me not give o'er;
His promises are faithful,
     A righteous crown He'll give,
And all His valiant soldiers
     Eternally shall live.

Through grace I am determined
     To conquest, though I die,
And then away to Jesus
     On wings of love I'll fly,
Farewell to sin and sorrow,
     I bid you both adieu;
And O, my friends, prove faithful,
     And on your way pursue.

Whene'er you meet with troubles
     And trials on your way,
Then cast your cares on Jesus,
     And don't forgt to pray.
Gird on the heavenly armor
     Of faith, and hope, and love,
And when the combat's ended
     He'll carry you above.

O, do not be discouraged,
     For Jesus is your friend,
And if you want more knowledge
