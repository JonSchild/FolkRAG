August 15, 1942

we don't need to go to England for the person for that particular [*2*]
job either.  I've heard many mention Marshall, and I think he's the
man capable of doing the job......certainly not MacArthur, who is
somewhat of a hero right now.  I've heard so many within the past
three or four days say that until we do have one person at the head,
we will continue to fight a losing war.  And, furthermore, many add,
"Well, why buy bonds until some effort is made to clarify this situation?"  [*8*]

August 10......The next comment came from a Civil Service
employee who recently had been employed as an accountant by the U. S.
Engineers at one of our plants now under construction in the State.
He had given up his position and came to our office to obtain addresses
of some California Government agencies.  He said:

"The less you know, the better on these construction jobs.
The favoritism is disgusting and the waste of manpower is terrible.
The even have as many as three on one truck riding around over the
grounds on various errands.  It's ridiculous.  I just quit because
I didn't like the whole wasteful setup.  I have been in Civil Service
in Milwaukee for a long time, but recently thought I'd like to try
some defense work in the Middlewest.  I came here intending to stay,
but I've had enough.  I'm going on to the coast and get lined up with
something else.....I hope where I don't see such ridiculous waste of
time and energy and money.  It makes me sick when we should be conserving, but no one seems to care."

It is our opinion that while, no doubt, this lad was sincere,
and perhaps there is some "smoke" in what he said, nevertheless,
