on, 'till they got into Oxierfield.
        But anyway, he didn' bother me no more.   He didn' come to the
house to pick at us an' didn't do nothin'.   You know, to come. . .
You know, some woulda, woulda come to the house an' try ta blow
it up or sumpin'.   But they didn'. . .nothin'.   Didn't never do
nothing'.        nothin'.   Why, Maddox didn't like it, hisse'f.

BJ:     Oh yeah!   If we'd a-done that, why that night we'd a, we'd 
a, we'd been blowed [??  a] up. Ah, ah,       down.

stayed up part a that next night, seein' was anybody gonna come 
around.   They ain' nobody come around, notime.   Ain't heard no
more talk of him doin'. . .
AL:    That was because you had somebody. . .
BJ:     Tha's right. 
AL:     . . .a white man who was really backing you up?

could git.   I never heard talk a them botherin' nobody.   I mean
the Maddox'.
