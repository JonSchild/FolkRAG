Some time ago Mr. Keppel indicated that the Carnegie 
Foundation would be willing to grant the Library $15,000 
for necessary phonographic apparatus if some other foundation 
would supply the funds for the staff - $8,000 a year 
for three years. Since the Library was not encouraged in 
its approach to the Rockefeller Foundation, I suggest 
that Mr. Keppel be asked if the Carnegie Foundation would 
be willing to make the grant of $15,000 which could be 
used in part for staff as well as for apparatus. This 
would enable the Library to acquire the essentials of a 
good duplicating apparatus and put it to use in short order. 
Then another application could be made next year for funds 
with which to maintain the staff and obtain supplemental 
apparatus.
