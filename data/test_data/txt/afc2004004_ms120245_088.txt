You won't see anybody feed BS or Mait Cal
because it's a secret affair. The houngan & 
the person are the only ones who go. When 
R. was a little boy he slept for 3 hours 
on the caljon while the devils all treated 
him - Dodo came after him & carried 
him home.
Autrefois Dodo knew pass√© houngan [but]
he was so hard no one could do anything
with him. But now somebody's put a 
charm on him so that he drinks all the
time and doesn't know anything. Whenever 
he starts to do anything he begins to
drink.
The woman next door has an "oppression
on her stomach which comes up into
her neck & nearly chokes her - she 
[has] sang songs to the loi for an hour
and now feels better.
