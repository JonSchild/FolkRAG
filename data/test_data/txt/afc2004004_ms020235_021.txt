     I spoke to him.  An' I had my service pan.  I went to put
my pan up.  An' in my mind, I said, "That's. . .must be him."  Yeah,
um-hum, sittin' right there, huh!
     An' so, he. . .We, we jus' laughed an' talked an' I fixed supper
for all of 'em, you know, 'cause I brang enough food in.  And they
all eat.  An' we eat a little bit an' drink, drink some coffee an'
sit there.  In a few minutes, somebody come an' call, an' ah. . .
I had asked him his name an' everything.  He say he was Cardell.
He. . .an' everything.  So, an' ah, a few minutes. . .So a lady come
to hail 'im an' asked who it was; they told me.  An' she asked
me, said, "Was Cardell there?"
     I said, I said, "Ain't your name Cardell?"
     He said, "Yeah." [that's who it was."] 
     I said, "Well, see somebody call you."  
     An' so, ah, he went out to hear, to hear what they had to
say.  He went out the front do' and ah, Sue an' them tol' me
that was guy that been sendin' me, that wan', wan' to come an'
see me.  So I tipped right on out the back door easy.  An' eased
around there; we had a some, a whole lot of honeysuckles out there. An'
ah, I eased out by them honeysuckles to hear what he's sayin'.
     An' this woman was talkin' there; she was a southern woman.
(SHE MEANS AT LEAST LATE-MIDDLED-AGED)  She was tellin' about
how good she was to him.  An' how she'd buy him shirts, his clothes. . .
"I fixed a big supper for ya tonight."  Bought some kinda fish,
she say.  Anyhow, all like that.  An' everything, she was tellin'
'im.  "Then you come down here to see somebody else."
     He said, "I ain't never talked with the lady yet.  But if
she talk to me about it, I'm comin' to see 'er."  He said. . .
     An' so she said, "An', an' you don't 'preciate nothin' I do."
