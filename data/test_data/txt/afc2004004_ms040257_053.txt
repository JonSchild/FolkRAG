I've a sweetheart in America, 
I've another in Dundee-i-ee-i-ee,
I've another in Australia
And that's the one to marry me-i-ee-i-ee.

First he took me to America,
Second he took me to Dundee-i-ee-i-ee,
Third he ran away and left me
Wi three wee bairns on my knee-i-ee-i-ee.

One was sittan on the table,
The other was sittan on ma knee-i-ee-i-ee,
The other was standan by the door-side 
Singan:  Daddy will ye no come back tae me-i-ee-i-ee?

I sent her for butter O aye,  O aye, 
I sent her for butter O aye,  O aye,
I sent her for butter
And she fell in the gutter,
O the world must be coming to an end,  O aye.

I sent her for cheese  O aye,  O aye,
I sent her for cheese  O aye,  O aye,
I sent her for cheese
And she fell and skinnt her knees
O the world must be coming to an end,  O  aye.

I sent her for bread  O  aye, O  aye,
I sent her fro bread  O  aye,  O  aye,
I sent her for bread 
And she fell down dead
O the world must be coming to an end, O  aye,

I bo't her a coffin  O  aye,  O  aye, 
I bo't her a coffin  O  aye,  O  aye,
I bo't her a coffin
And she fell thro the bottom
O the world must be coming to a end,  O  aye.

I (bunt) buried her in durt  O  aye,  O  aye,
I buried her in durt  O  aye,  O  aye,
I buried her in durt
And she jumped out her shurt
O  the world must be coming to an end,  O  aye.
