That such Propaganda Clinics would be popular and would
actually do much to help the people spot propaganda, sift
opinions and check rumors has been proven to me by the
success of an experimental Propaganda Clinic that I conducted
for a group of high school girls that Mrs. Drumm has in for
a discussion once a week.  The girls were tickled pink to
think they had learned something about spotting propaganda,
were eager to learn more, and they were pleased with their
newly-found power to check a rumor.  All of which is quite
natural.

There is, of course, more to the development of this idea than
I can write down in a letter I am trying to keep short, and I
find that I am leaving out far more than I am putting in - 
and the execution, the orderly carrying out of it has a great
deal to do with its success.

For that reason, and because I am vitally interested in
helping in this job of checking rumors, I would very much
like to discuss this and related propaganda matters with
you and your colleagues.

You may wonder why I am so interested in this problem - and
the answer to that is easy:  I've been a newspaper man with
the Rochester Journal and The Detroit News, and have been doing
advertising and sales promotion work for several years.  These 
jobs in combination with a period as executive secretary of the 
Michigan Planning Commission induced me a long time ago to start
watching the techniques of propaganda and rumor - and now that 
these are vital to the security of you and me, it is, of course, 
only natural that I want to help control the germ. 

And think of propaganda and rumor as a germ for a moment.  If
you can not isolate a germ, you treat those who become affected
with it.  And that's what Propaganda Clinics would do.

May I hear from you again?

Yours truly

P. S. - The attached diagrams are rough, very rough, but
they are the kind of picturization people can understand - and 
they have enabled me to explain to people with loose
tongues why they should not repeat rumors.  And now there
is a tendency in many spots to think that it doesn't make
much difference if you just repeat the opinions and rumors
found in newspapers.  But these can be just as ill founded
and just as disastrous in effect as those not dignified by
print.  The clinics would analyze such newspaper rumors.
