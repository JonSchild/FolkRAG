Special campaigns should not be directed against any
particular rumor, except in very rare cases. Sometimes a par-
ticular rumor causes serious trouble in and of itself, but this
is so rare an occurrence that we may safely assume that most
projects dealing with rumors will never have to consider this.

ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS

In this general discussion emphasis has been placed
upon the need for care in rumor control programs and also special
emphasis upon the forms for direct counter-action. Experience
has shown that well-intentioned activity may cometimes be wasted.
In spite of the care which was taken in trying to squelch the
rumors about the Eleanor Clubs, reporters still find people
saying something like "Well, maybe there aren't any Eleanor
Clubs but there sure must be something."

The search for authoritative facts frequently leads
the column to the person who must necessarily give one type of
statement. You would not expect a bank president to say that
it was unwise to put money on deposit at his bank, so that calling
in the banker or the treasury official on some of the savings
bank and war bond rumors is not always the wisest thing. To
quote from a letter received by a newspaper column which has
dealt with rumors about food at the Army camps by quoting Army officers may prove il-
luminating:
