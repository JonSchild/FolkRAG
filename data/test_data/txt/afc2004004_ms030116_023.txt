(SHE IS RATHER PLACATORY AND ANXIOUS FOR FEAR SHE MAY OFFEND HIM.  HE IS
VERY JEALOUS-NATURED, WANTS THE FLOOR, SHUTS HER UP FREQUENTLY)
Rev. D:  Yeah!  But you know, heah one thing about it.  I n ever like to 
put out anything without goin over it -- fur the world to listen at.
Jes like a pusson settin down sewin.  You understand, Sister Lizybeth?
If you don't put up a good job of your sewin it'll come back to you,
won't it?
Eliz:  Well, Rev. Davis, if you'd rather take some time to get it together,
I'd be delighted.  I'll just turn this off.
Rev. D:  Naw!  It don't take so much time.  But heah the thing about it
yo u jus g ot know what you're sayin.
Mrs. Davis:  I know but you don't have to say it all, sweetheart.  The
sermon is rather long.
Eliz:  You can listen to it an if you don't like the way it comes out,
we'll do it again.
Mrs. Davis:  You say that little prayer befo you start.  That's why
-- a short one is called a sermonette, you know.
Rev. Davis:  You can preach a sermon, fur as th at's concerned.  in five
minutes.
Mrs. Davis:  The people calls fur em very often, you know.  People ast
you fur a sermonette cause you don't really take time to preach a long
time.
Rev. D:  I used to preach them great long sermons but I quit.
Mrs. D:  No use in doin it -- gittin all out of breath.  Well, she's
ready, honey.
