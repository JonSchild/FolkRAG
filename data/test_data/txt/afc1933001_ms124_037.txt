Mrs. Edings Whaley Wilson,
Martins Point, S.C..

Dear Mrs. Wilson,

Thank you for your kind [letter and] and interesting letter and
for the list of singers. We will greatly appreciate all the additional in-
formation you can send us in regard to Plantation Echoes.

I regret to inform you that I shall not be in Washington during
September and that the Library [has no] is taking no active part in the
Sesquicentenial Celebration. It is being directed by [a] Mr. Sol Bloom, [*Red. ?*]

As concerns the rerecording of the spirituals and songs of Plantation
Echoes, John A. Lomax has perhaps told you that we are not yet
equipped to do the work. When we [are able to] have the equipment we will [*then*]
be in a [*better*] position to discuss the matter. [seriously.]

I am indeed sorry that you cannot come to Washington to [assist]
tell me about Plantation Echoes, [but your letters] both because [that
would be] of [yo] the assistance you could [renedr the] [*render*] the Archive and
because I should like very much to meet you. Perhaps that [can be
arranged] will be at the World Fair. In the meantime, however, your letters
will prove of great assistance to us.
[Tahnk]
Thanking you again for your kind letter, Iam,

Sincerely yours,

Aaln Lomax
