OH, BABE

Oh, babe,
Boom, ba-loom-ba-loom,
Oh, babe, ("that's it")
Boom, boom, ba-loom,
If you don't like my peaches,
Please don't shake my tree,
Oh, babe,
Doo, doo, da-loo,
Oh, babe,
Doo, doo, da-loo.
(Ha ha! They goin' somethin'! An' they say:")
If you don't like my peaches,
Please don't shake my tree...
