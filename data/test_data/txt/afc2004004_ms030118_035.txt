a man is it?  And you told me you reserved that for women!)
     Well. . . .I said, Bet you won't gimme a cigarette, I said.
     (Me:  Hee hee h ee hee.)
     I love my men folks as brothers.  Thass fur as I go
with them.  But I got further than that wid women.
     (Pat:  You like men much better, don't you?)
     In a way, because I'm a man.  But you see, I can't use a 
man the way I  can use a woman, you see.  Cause he's a man.
     (Pat:  Yo u can talk to a man better, can't you?)
     Talk to a man better bout what I have experienced,
bout what I'm goin up against all right.  An then, some things I can
talk to a woman better than I can him.  Cause she's de doctor.  He
ain't no doctor.  I bring my case to you.  I speak to you as a doctor.
You ought to be able to minster to my case.  A man can't mister.
     (Pat:  Well. . . . .)
     That makes some of yall women biggety, too, cause we
have to look up to yall fur what we want.  That makes some of em fall
in bad health.  It's a good thang too.  If you don't give a man what
you ought to, what belong to him, God'll take your health
away from you.  Fore long you won't have no health at all.
     (Pat:  What belongs to men?)
     (indignantly)  What b'longs to em?  What God gives you to
give us!  Thass what b'longs to men.
     (Pat:  What?)
     You know what it is.
     (Pat:  You mean sex?)
     You can call it what you please. . . .You can call it what
you please. . . .Some of yall act right nasty sometime, because we have
to look up to you.
     (Pat:  Don't women look up to men for the same thing?)
