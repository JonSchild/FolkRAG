The simplest and perhaps the most direct type of program
for this need would be a sort of travelogue or investigatalogue
of America, American institutions, American life, American factories
and American personages with Spanish and Portuguese commentators.
I watched a French commentator handle completely unfamiliar
materials, dubbing his extremely delightful comments in and
over the sound of the things he was describing--- an Indian dance,
a steel mill in operation, a Federal Theatre play, and a lumberjack
song. If this could be done with people from the several countries,
well-known personas, commenting on, say, a Negro church service, a
session in Congress, etc., for the benefits of the home-folks, the
same effect would be got. Naturally, the same thing could be accomplished
by sending our sound recorder to South America, except that
in this case, the material could be used for home consumption with
an English commentator and the transcriptions shipped to rural
stations and with Spanish commentators for the South American countries.

10. Another program of the same kind must be based on what recordings
we can get of Latin American music, both folk and popular, comparing
them along the way with similar materials from the United States
and Canada. " Music of the Two Americas." This program could be
built entirely of dubbings from records with suitable comments.

11. I think the design of the programs for Latin America might well
be comparative in a great part. Certain basic problems are similar:
the conquering of wild country, the struggles to free ourselves
from a colonial position, the experiences of fronteirsmen,
the influences of African culture elements, and the parallel struggle
for democracy. I feel that a program on the democratic heroes of
the two Americas with the obvious connection between Bolivar and
Washington, Juarez and Lincoln would have splendid results.

12. One of the problems of a democracy at war is how to activate and
conquer the suspicious of minority groups. My conversations with
Negroes through the past few months have convinced me that the Negroes
are not only disillusioned with the New Deal but profoundly suspicious
of the defense program and the motives behind it. I think
that a Library of Congress program or programs on the Negroe's contribution
to American culture in both hemispheres would help to
clear the air a good deal. The program should take such a stand
as to make the Negroes feel that they are not being condescended to
and the Southerners feel that the program is not being written by
" nigger-lovers." Such a program would naturally be rich with music
and folk-lore of all sorts, but, it should also have interviews
with successful Negroes in this country and include dramatizations
of the lives of great Negroes on both continents. It certainly
should not shun the problems that have faced and still face the
Negro in both halves of the hemisphere. Herskovitz was decorated
by the Haitian government because of the honesty and tact of his
treatment of " Life in a Haitian Valley".
