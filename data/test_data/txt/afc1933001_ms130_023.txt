Dear Dr. Stoutt:

I am planning a recording trip into Pennsylvania for 
the Archive of American Folk-Song.  I understand that you 
have invited John A. Lomax to come to your folk festivals 
on several occasions, but he has always been somewhere between 
Texas and Timbucktoo and couldn't make it.  Sometime 
this spring or summer, however, I want to bring a fine 
recording instrument into Pennsylvania and make for the Archive 
specimen records of Pennsylvania folksongs.  I am sure 
that both you and the German Folklore Society can be of the 
greatest assistance to this project.

Will you be in Allentown this summer and with enough 
free time to give me the lay of the land, at least?  May I 
expect to hear from you in the near future?

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-Song
