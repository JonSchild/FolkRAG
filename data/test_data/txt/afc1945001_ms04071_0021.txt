A conversation between two employees of the Treasurer's 
office in Denver, August 4:
"I understand that many federal government employees have 
been very cooperative in regard to giving 10% of their income to 
the Government for the purchase of war bonds. They tell me 
though that some of these people are pretty hard up -- some 
of them don't make very large salaries and about a third of 
them cash in their bonds just as quickly as they can. Some 
of them have bought four or five $50 bonds but they have cashed 
in all but the one on which they are making payments. Is there 
anything to such rumors?"
