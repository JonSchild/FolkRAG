Tune: There's a Long, Long Trail A-Winding.
There's a mighty organization
Grown up in our land,
It's called the Farmers' Union,
And forever will stand.
There's another aggregation,
That is swinging in line;
And to the Union's mighty strength,
It will its own combine.

We are farmers' wives and daughters,
'Twill be hard for us to see;
Our farms in corporations,
Through the whole country.
So we'll stand beside our men folks,
In their struggle for right,
And for the Farmer Union cause,
We'll work with all our might.

It is true we're only women,
Be we'll see what we can do;
To save the farms for farmers
And we'll ever be true.
The Auxiliary they call us,
And we'll help all we can;
To master Eastern capital
And fight for rights of man.

We'll not only save the farmer,
And his family so brave;
We're thinking of our nation,
And it too we would save.
We would drive out all corruption,
For equal rights we now stand;
And aim to bring real Liberty
To our beloved land.

Tune--Golden Slippers
By A. M. H.
Oh! The Farmer's Union,
Oh! The Farmer's Union,
Farmer's Union I'm going to join,
 Because I think it's right.
Oh! The Farmer's Union,
Oh! The Farmer's Union,
Farmer's Union I'm going to join,
And help with all my might.
