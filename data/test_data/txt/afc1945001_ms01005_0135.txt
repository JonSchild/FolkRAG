Dear Sir:

The story was told here to the effect that a father (residence not
given) paid $337.00 more or less to undertaker who shipped home 
a coffin said to contain body of son. On opening the box, body
was found to be that of a stranger, and later, the son was found
to be alive. Said that the Navy Dept. made restitution.

Now this sounds false, and the kind of stuff our enemies circulate.
If true, it should be forgotten. If false, please advise, as I
would like to do what I can to destroy a falsehood.

Very truly,

H A Gilbert
