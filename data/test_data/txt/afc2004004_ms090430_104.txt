In 1897 the average levee height was less than 15 feet and the base width less than 100 feet.

Thus it may readily be seen that the levee s lopes subject to erosion from rainwash have been increased to practically 5 times the area of 1897.  Wave and scour damage has also increased its proportion to the greatly higher flood plane.

While the work involved has greatly increased, we have been able by the employment of modern equipment and more efficient methods to constantly decrease the cost of operations while actually adding to the section and efficiency of the levees.

In 1925 the net cost of maintenance after deducting all credits, including hay sales of $41,109.78, amounted to $60,745.33.

In 1927, after making all allowable credits, the cost amounted to $112,879.55.

The comparable cost for the year 1939 amounted to $50,308.01.

For the past fiscal year 1940-41, the costs amounted to a net of $46,724.78 though the maintenance account is credited with only $5,183.26 for sale of hay.

This cost of $46,724.78 covers all items of field operations including the new equipment, fuel, feed, repairs to equipment, all levee repair and drainage and all repair material, and an item of $1,751.06 for gravel roads to and along the levee.

A new equipment item for two Ford dump trucks amounting for $1,551.85 is also included.

We hope to still materially reduce these costs, but on a levee as large and as important as ours there is a limit to even the most economical spending if efficiency is to be maintained.
