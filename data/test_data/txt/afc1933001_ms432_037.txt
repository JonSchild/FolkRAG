(II) FUNERAL MARCH.

DY-ING AS SOL-DIERS FIGHT-ING FOR LA-BOR SO DID YOU
FALL, AN OFFSPRING OF YOUR LOVE FOR THOSE WHO 
STRIFE GLAD-LY YOU GAVE US TA-LENT AND TREASURES
YIELD-ING YOUR ALL, THE HON-OR OF THE WORLD YOUR 
FREEDOM LIFE. DEEP-LY YOU SUF-FER'D, NOR 
SHRANK FROM THE GRAVE; JUDG-ES AND HANG-MEN, THE 
FATE OF THE FRAY; STARV'D IN DARK DUN-GEONS BEAT-EN AND TORTUR'D
[CHEER-FUL AND] CHEER-FUL AND BRAVE, DE-FY-ING 
CHAINS AND JAILS YOU MARCH'D YOUR WAY. L.L.
