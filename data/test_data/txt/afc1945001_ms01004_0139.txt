Dear Sir.
            Upon the request of Mr. James B. Marley Regional Dirictor Region X I was asked to cooperate in connection with a study of rumors the week of August 3.
            Altho upon one occassion I invited information, it was withheld and altho I listened rather intently during the week because I was with groups of people I heard nothing whatsoever that might be classed as a rumor of war information.
                                                                 Sincerely,
                                                                     Hazel Bratley
                                                                     Regional Nutrition Representative
