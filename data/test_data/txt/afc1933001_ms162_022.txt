Dear Miss Rossell:

   You must by this time consider me completely undependable,
but the fact is that your letters chase me to and fro
from Washington to New York and back, and I've been constantly
on the go until the last day or so.  Your idea for records
for Book Week is, I am afraid, somewhat beyond me this year.
I should like to work on such a project myself for four or
five days and there just isn't the time this year, and that's
what I think this job would mean, nor do I have an assistant
to whom I could assign this fascinating project.
   The Library does not at the present, lend records.  We
are able to furnish duplicates at a fixed price of $1.50 for
a  twelve inch acetate record at 78 R.P.M.  For the best results
with such records, you will need a good play back machine
with the light and flexible pick-up rather than the
victrola type.
   There are, besides this, the problem of choice of materials
for children which we know little about.  Perhaps by
next year if you think it of sufficient importance, we can
have prepared an album especially with the needs of children
in mind.
   Another possible solution is for you to use copies of
certain School of the Air broadcasts of last year as demonstration
pieces.  If this seems practical, you'll have to
communicate with Sterling Fisher, C.B.S., New York City.
He will have to okay the use of these records for public
demonstration.  I suggest using Railroad Work Songs, Poor
Farmer Songs, Square Dance Songs, Gold Rush Songs and Sea
Shanties for your programs.

Sincerely yours,
