I got my 'cordion when I was a leetle bitty fellow [my] uncle, 
Jim Batson, which now lives in Mineola, Texas, he bring it to
me, ridin' on the back of an' ole mule from Morningsport. I 
was settin' on the front porch when he come riding up an' 
[he] give me that accordion. [an'] I was so glad, I jump on it an[d]' 
begun to whip ^it down. I didn' go to bed at [all that night] no more [?] for a while, set up 
and played my accordion all night long. Ev'y once in a while 
papa would xxxxx raise up and say, "S[a]on, aincha gonna lie down?"
An' I say, "Nawsuh, papa, I'm got to play this ole accordion."
When I [x] ^did lie down it was sun-up. An' when I wake up, [xxx went to bed I was so sleepy an'] fust thing I did [when I got up] was jump on that accordion and begin to whip it...
I kep' playin' the accordion 'til I got some six[e]teen years old. When I was
a right big boy I [went] ^used to go around with Bud Coleman and Him Fagin.
They had a guitar an' ^I used to follow 'em around to hear 'em play.
^I she was crazy 'bout guitar music one day I come home an' ask my papa to git me a guitar an' he went in
town an' brought me [my first guitar, had a black box on it.] one was painted black.
I jumped on it and begin to whip it down to de plank. [n]Never slept 
that night, was playing my guitar. [f]Fust thing I learned was
"Po' Howard, Po' Boy" from Jim Fagin and then "Green Corn" from 
Bud Coleman, I'd go off somewhere an' hear a song an' come home
wid it on my mind an' sit down an' begin to play it on the 
guitar. [i]If it wouldn' come to my mind [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx] right then,
I'd go lay down an' then in the night it would come to [me] my min'
an' I'd jump right up outa de bed an'  begin to whip it [xx] down
