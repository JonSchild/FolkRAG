3. Robeline, La., August 6, 1942. 

I called [ov] the Mayor if Natchitoches over the telephone to inquire about needs in that community and to ascertain if any soldiers were in the neighborhood. The Mayor volunteered the information that the community was rife with various rumors to the effect that "Natchitoches had been put off[o]-limits by the maneuver army." I asked him [o]if the rumor (see No. 1) was being circulated. He reported that it was one of many. "There is absolutely no truth to these rumors," he said, "and I am making a full statement to that effect in the local press as of today." [*79*]
