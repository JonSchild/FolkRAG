ALAN LOMAX, being first duly sworn, deposes and says:
I am associated with the Division of Music of The
Library of Congress, Washington, in the District of Columbia.

My father, John A. Lomax, and I collected and com-
piled the "American Ballads and Folk Songs" published by the
Macmillan Company of New York City in the year 1934.

My father and i took the song "Alla en el Rancho
Grande" from "Southwestern Lore" edited by J. Frank Dobie and
published by the Texas Folk-Lore Society as No. IX in the year
1931 and incorporated it in "American Ballads and Folk Songs"
under the impression that the song was a folk song.

When asked recently I said that I believed it might
be a folk song.

I have not found any publication of this song earlier
than 1927 nor do I possess any other proof to support my former
impression.
