[My failure with Iron [Iron] Head]
1
I was as deeply disappointed
with Iron Head as I had been
with Lead Belly, though I tried
desperately [hard] hard to be useful
to both. I treated [him] both of them
with far more patience and
consideration than I did

either of my two sons, as I have
2
often said. All their seeming
gratitude in a hundred ways
was proven shallow ?breath.
I could never even convince either
man that I was in some
way attempting to use him
against his own interest!

Some of my friends reproached me for
3
the danger I exposed myself and
family through my association with
these men, others actually for this
reason broke off their friendship 
with me. But the lasting and keen
reproach that I feel for myself
is due the fact that I failed
to help [either] them.
