"Industry sees the handwriting on the wall, and in a great many 
war plants men are teaching women to operate machines which only skilled 
male labor has heretofore been operating. The war plants will be letting 
men who are now regarded as vital to these plants enter military service 
without a protest when enough women have been trained. This, of course, 
means the release of men who have been trained for their machine jobs -- 
just as the women can be, in 3 to 6 months time." [*Columbus, Ohio 18*]
