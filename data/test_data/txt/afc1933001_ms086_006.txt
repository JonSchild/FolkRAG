Dear Mr. Lomax:

    We have endeavored to ascertain all of the
facts regarding the accident and death of Bessie Smith, and
there seems to be no doubt that this colored woman was
fatally injured in a automobile collision which took place
near Clarksdale, Mississippi, about sixty miles south of
Memphis, and that she was not brought to Memphis for treat-
ment.

    Enclosed copy of death certificate, and
copies of the newspaper articles are self explanatory. I
notice that Bessie Smith died at the Afro-American Hospital
in Clarksale, and this, together with the fact that her
right arm was amputated, shows that she received hospital
treatment following the accident.

    Any statement that this woman was refused
medical aid in Memphis is untrue. One of the best hospitals
in the South is the John Gaston Hospital here, in which ap-
proximately 75% of the patients are negroes. It is operated
by the City of Memphis, and we never have refused treatment
to anyone - regardless of race, color or creed.

    I have checked all the Memphis hospitals, and
find no record whatever of Bessie Smith having been brought
to any of them, or of anyone telephoning to inquire if she
should be admitted for treatment.

    The statement in the October 1937 issue of
Down Beat simply is not true, and the author, John Hammond,
either lied maliciously, or is an irresponsible writer
desiring to foment trouble between white and colored people.
