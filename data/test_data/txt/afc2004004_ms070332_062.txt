Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-eye, ee-eye, oh!
And on that farm he had a chick,
EE-eye, ee-eye, Oh!
With a chick-chick here and a chick-chick there!
And here a chick, there a chick!
Everywhere a chick-chick
Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-eye-ee-eye, oH!
And on this farm he had a duck, etc.

Chorus: (add duck to chick and repeat)
With a quack-quack here, and a quack-quack there
Pig -- oink-oink
cow -- moo-moo
Ford -- rattle-rattle
Wife -- gimme-gimme
Campers -- chatter-chatter.

No booze today, no booze today,
You can't buy booze on Sunday,
No booze today, no booze today,
Better come around on Monday.

Oh the only girl I ever had,
Had a face like a horse and buggy,
She had two teeth right in her head,
Oh fireman, save my child!

But the child was bigger that the fireman!
Take your hands right off that monkey wrench,
Your uncle is a nut!

I stuck my head in a little skunk's hole,
The Little Skunk said, "Upon my soul,
Take it out, take it out, take it out -- remove it."

I didn't take it out and the Little skunk said,
"If you don't take it out, you'll wish you were dead,
Take it out, take it out -- ssssss." I -- removed it.

Young folks, old folks, everybody come!
Join the darkies' Sunday School and have a lot of fun,
Please to check your chewing gum and candy at the door,
And here's some Bible stories like you never heard before.
