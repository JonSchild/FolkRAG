MacPherson's Farewell.

1)  Fare ye weel, ye dungeons dark and strong,
Fare-weel, fare-weel to thee,
McPherson's rant will nae be lang
On yonder gallows tree.
Chorus:
Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,
O rantingly was he,
He played the tune and he danced it roun',
Below the gallows tree.

2)

3)  By a woman's treacherous hand
That I was condemned to dee,
High on a ledge of her window sill
And a blanket she threw over me. (Cho.)

4)  Some come here noo, to see me hang,
And some to buy my fiddle,
Before I will part wi' thee
I'll break her through the middle. (cho.)

5)  Fare-weel, my wife and bairn,
There was nae repentin' at my heart
While the fiddle was in my airm. (Cho.)

6)  Come ye lower the bands from off my arm,
Bring to me noo my sword,
There's nae a man in all Scotland.
That'll                    at his word. (Cho.)

7)  O little did my mother think
When first she cradled me,
That I would turn a rovin' boy,
And die upon the gallows tree. (Cho.)

8)  The reprieve was coming o'er the brig of Banff
To set McPherson free,
They put the clock at quarter past
And they hanged him to the tree.
