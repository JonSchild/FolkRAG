I first met Josiah Coombs at
Cleveland, Ohio in 191[5]4?, where he had come
with a hand-made dul[s]cimer to sing
and play ballads for the Modern
Language Association at their
annual meeting. Afterwards he
won his Doctor's degree from
the University of Paris, his [b?]
dissertation being on the Mountain
Songs of Kentucky where he
was born. He is now Professor
of [French] Modern Languages in
Texas Christian University at Ft
Worth, Texas. We made these
records in his home in Ft.
Worth
