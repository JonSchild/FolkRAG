Dear Alan:
Your letter just arrived and I am returning
the one you wrote to Miss Flanders.  Her address
is Archive of Vermont Folksongs, Smiley Manse,
Springfield, Vermont.
Thank you for the list of Vocalion records.
I shall write to Mr. Wallenstein immediately.  I
shall also write to Mr. Walker of RCA.  It should
be easy to arrange for your visit but we cannot
give you any blanket order to hire assistants.  
If you see a big copying project ahead, fully
outline it and describe it accurately and we
shall obtain the copies for you by other means.
All that we ask is to survey the field.  Victor
catalogs are not so rare anyway, and it is very
possible that they can place some at your disposal
which you can use for your notations thereby
eliminating a great deal of copying.
With best regards,
Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke
