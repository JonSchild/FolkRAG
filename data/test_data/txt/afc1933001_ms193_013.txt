Mr. John Umble

Dear Mr. Umble:

I am sorry that your letter of September 5 has gone
unanswered so long but we have been searching for a recording
of "Froelich So Will Ich Singen." I regret that we do not
find this title in our collection of Amish records made by 
Alan Lomax in Goshen in 1938. On the other hand, it is 
possible that we have it listed under a different title. For 
this reason I am enclosing a list of titles which we find in 
our catalog. From this list you can choose the hymn you want 
copied on the back of "O Gott Vater Wir Loben Dich."

You will be pleased to learn that we can make a copy 
for you on an acetate disk with aluminum base. The cost would 
be $2.50 for the 12-inch copy, plus 25 [cents symbol] for packing. Since 
government practice requires payment in advance, I must ask 
you to send a check for this amount made payable to "The
Librarian of Congress." As soon as we receive your order, we 
shall try to send you the record as soon as possible.

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Music Division
