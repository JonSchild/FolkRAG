Dear Texas,

After Shirley and I left you we journeyed through the 
whole South as far as Arkansas and back to Georgia and came 
wearily back to New York with a treasure of songs from all 
over. The problem of arranging publication for all this 
material is complex. So far I have sold a series of albums 
to Atlantic Records. In this series I would like to use the 
two lullabies you sang. These songs will be copyrighted in 
your name and you will be sent publisher's contracts, and 
will receive royalties as composer of them. Also, you will 
be paid your proportion of royalties for your singing on 
the records. This is all covered in the letter of contract 
enclosed. Also the letter gives me formal permission to find 
a market for the rest of your recordings if I can. In your 
case, if I find no way of publishing these recordings before 
6 months are up, all rights will revert to you in respect to 
the songs not marketed by then.

I hope you will find this agreement acceptable, and 
will sign and return this letter of contract to me right 
away, so that the publication of the first group of albums 
can move right ahead.

Thanks for your sweet letter and Christmas Card. 
Shirley and I return your love in full measure, and wish 
for you and yours the best and happiest Christmas and 
New Year.

Sincerely,

Alan Lomax.
