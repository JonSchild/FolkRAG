   I am naturally distressed to hear about the decision
of the Carnegie Foundation.  Wouldn't it be possible for
us to get an Allied or a Fairchild with a double turntable.
We could probably set up a pretty fair duplicating outfit
for $1500 if[w] we were satisfied to cut all the corners.
Couldn't you persuade Mr. Bond to go that far for us and,
if we could get somebody to run the machine, just any
bright college boy, we could begin to turn out a certain
number of duplicates.  We could make some sort of arrangement
to borrow the Archive's technician to train this person
in the fundamentals and he could probably do some quite
nice jobs for us.  . . . .You know, of course that the Department
of the Interior is doing the duplication for the Five
Arts Committee's trip?  Perhaps we could [truen] turn our material
over to them.
   The various enclosures speak for themselves. When you
write next, will you tell me when you think the Committee
will be able to send me my grant?
   I will forward the Mississippi letter on to father
this morning in South Carolina. In the meantime I can see
no objection we could possibly make to the WPA making use
of the Parchman records provided that father is consulted and
given due credit.
Best regards.
