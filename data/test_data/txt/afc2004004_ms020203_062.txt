Vera Hall, reel 6, page 1.

A:  But you never did even turn away when your times were hardest
when your mama was sick. .
V:  I did not. Just stayed just like I was. Just believed
that he would fix it some way.
A:  You were havin' such a hard time-- how much were you makin
then, Vera?
V:  I want makin but seven dollars a week.
A:  How would you make do on seven dollars a week?
V:  Well, you see I wouldnt try to buy any clothes. I'd try to
pay my house rent outa that and just buy food. And buy the medicine
that the doctor say for my mother to have. And the doctor --
that's the reason I said I just done on what I could--he was good.
He would make trips-- he would tell me--Vera, don't be no ways
bashful or feel bad about callin me, if you need me. Said, that's
all right about the money--I understand, Said, you can pay it
whenever you can, but if you need me you call me, night or day.
So I believed the Lord did that, causin him to be like that.
So every time he come, he'd think that I was feelin bad
over not havin any money to give him and he'd always pat me on
the shoulder when he'd come in to see mama and say don't worry
say, "You need me, you call me. You do that, you hear? Said, 
"Yessuh I sholy would." Said, "Don't hesitate." Said, "If sumpin
happen or she gets in a way that you don't know what's wrong,
you call me. You cain't do nothin but call a doctor.
Call me." So I did. He was right nice to me. I haven been so
long got him paid. And my mother been dead over a year.
A:  How much was the bill?
