Ho, Back, Buck, and Gee,by the Lamb

learned from Dick-Licker on the Shaw State Farm in Texas.

Daddy had an' old bull-dog, he was double-jinted,
Taken him down to de black-smith's shop and had his peter
pinted.

Dinah she went down de road, I went down behind her,
She stoop down jes' to buckle up her shoe and I see her sausage
grinder.

Me an' Sal went to church one night, she sat on de steeple
I laughed forto break my heart and she pissed all over de people

So they went to Cunningham, fell down on their knees,
Mighta heard them holl'in', "Have mercy on me."*

* Cunningham( a notorious [leas] plantation owner, who leased
convicts in Texas and is supposed to have treated them brutally
is described as " a tush-hog in de numbers".
