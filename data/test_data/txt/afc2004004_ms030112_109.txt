MRS. DAVIS:
The fifth Sunday in April I had a program, I had a Church, Arrived in this Church and Rev. Davis he went on in the morning for the morning service, just felt like he wanted to be in the morning service so he went on.  But I didn't go till the afternoon and so he heard a nice sermon, he said, that morning and he was real happy he went on it ahead of me and so in the afternoon I had this program, Larry you know you was supposed to come but you didn't get there, so I called on Rev. Davis kind of at the end of the program, I called on him to do a short number, he did a short number "O Lord I want o Be Saved" he did that. And then he preached a short sermonette which everybody enjoyed so much I was so busy around there, I can't remember the words but anyway it seemed that everybody enjoyed it the sermonette he preached that particular Sunday. Cause he wanted to he said The Lord laid it on his mind, to do a litte sermonette a sermonette which he did it and I didn't ask him for one I asked him for a short number cause I didn't feel like he was able to do a sermonette, but he be in, and it seems like everybody enjoyed it and Lord put it in his mind to do a sermonette and thats just what he did and so we had a good time. One of my friends said he better stop or we be going to long, but I didn't stop him, I didn't want to stop him after awhile he stopped himself. He went on like that and we had an awfully nice program and that was the last service that
we had together which was April the 30th the Fifth Sunday in April.
