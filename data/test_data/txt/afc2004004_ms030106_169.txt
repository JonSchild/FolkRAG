1680 A (Con't.)

A "side" is a thing that it takes two to play, that is,
opposition against one another. So, of course, I picked [up] out
the jack and when I picked [up] out the jack I still had these cards--
other three cards in my hand. So I told the boys, "All right,
get down here on this card" and they start[ed] to getting down.
"Getting down" means to put some money up. They would put up
from fifty cents to a dollar, two dollars, and so forth and
so on[;]. So I knew that I  had the best card, as they call the
best card the one that don't lose, the one that stands up
longer. So I told the boys just make it easy on their self and
just roll in. Used to say, "Come on, let's roll up," and
they'd [would] roll and I made so much money on that deal, I
didn't know--I was taking it up so fast it was a shame.

So I didn't know how to get the cards back into the
deck[,]. So one of the camp men--they usually turn the deck over
after every deal[.]--they picked up the deal and turned the deck
over before Harry could do anything and I didn't know how to
get the cards back in there. So, since I had the [deck] jack and they
couldn't find the other three jacks, of course every [one swung] thing was
on me. The suspicion was right on me. And a fellow pulled out
a great big pistol. He said, "You either come in with my
money or off goes your head."
