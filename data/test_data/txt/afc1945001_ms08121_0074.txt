The English comander in
Australia told his men that
he would pay them a quarter
for every dead Jap soldier they
would bring in. So the next day
the English soldiers brought in
hundreds of dead Japs. After the
Comander had paid his men, he
asked "where did you find all these
Japs"? Then one man said "Oh that
was easy we bought them from
the Aussies for ten cents a head."
