In the Marines the men call their
guns rifles and if they ever make a
slip they're punished.  One fellow I
know wrote home that he had been
laughing at some of the other fellows
and then said 'gun' himself.  He had to
go around to everyone around camp 
in his spare time and say he was dumb 
nitwit or some worse name.  He said
that you feel soooo foolish because
they all make fun of you.
