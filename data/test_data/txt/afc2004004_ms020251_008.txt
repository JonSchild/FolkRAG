Reel of 10/4/61, Side 2, Song 23
37
GOIN' TO CHATANOOGY
Now we take this for a play song, but in the old days the grown-ups
really danced it.  People played it on the guitars, too.  When I
was little we would watch Mama and her friends dancing this and
then we would play it after they
had gone.  We were allowed to sing these songs, but were not supposed
to be dancing the Rawhide and Twisting and those things, but
we would have lots of fun with them.
CHORUS:  I'm goin' to Chattanoogy,
Goin' to Chattanoogy,
Georgia can't hold me,
Georgia can't hold me here.
You know, Macon is a pretty place,
Atlanta is a beauty,
If you want to see your pretty places,
Go to Chattanoogy.
If I had a razor and a shotgun, too.
I'd go where I want to go,
I'm goin' to Chattanoogy,
Goin' to Chattanoogy, too.
(A VARIANT ON THE LAST LINE OF THE CHORUS IS:
Georgia can't hold me no mo'.)
