"Well,"he says, "Tell me how does this boy live at home ?"
"O," he says, "Sure that boy lives very well at home. That boy,"
he says, " the house that that boy lives in is one of the greatest
houses ever I put my head into. That's one of the greatest houses
I ever stood in."
"My oh," he says, "Is it that great?"
"O," he says, "It is."
"And what," he says, "Is it made of ? Is it made of stone?" he says
"No."
"Is it made of timber ?"
"No, it's not."
"No, no, no, no. The stuff the house is made of, I couldn't
describe it to ye, but it must be very costly stuff. When I
approached the boy's home, the father was taking his dinner off a
table that your whole estate couldn't buy. It was the costliest
table I ever left my two eyes on. And during the time he was
taking his dinner, he had two men-at-arms at the door on guard.
So ye may know he lives well at home."
"Oh well," says this millionaire, says he. "I'm very satisfied,"
he says, "to get such grand news," he says, " and we'll get them
both married in the morning."
      So they both was married in the morning, and they lived there
happy till they died. The young man sent for his father and took
him to the castle, and they all lived together there till they 
died.....

St. Calum Kill was a great man. You know, St. Calum Kill used to
go from place to place when he was in this country. He was one
time crossing a river. He kept a boy, you know. So the boy
was carrying the books for him, and he kept a lot of books. The boy
was tired with the books - they were falling here and there. The
cord broke and he had no cord to tie them up. So he was
complaining about how unhandy it was that he had no way of tying
up the books. Calum said, "We'll soon get the tied. I see a man,"
he says, "cutting grass ahead of us. He might make us a thumbrope
to tie up the books."
"That's right," says the boy," says he. So on they went to this man,
and said Calum - remarked about the books being scattered and
falling. He says, "Would you make me a wee rope that would
tighten them up?"
"I will surely," the man says. So he fell to it and made a rope.
And if he was at it for seven years he couldn't makeit - he was
very unhandy. So calum told him to leave it there. "It will do
until we go a bit further on." So he passed it on, and as he went
away from this poor fellow he says, "I hope you'll get a good
woman." That's all he said.
So on he went and he met another man about a mile from there,
cutting grass. So he remarked to this man about the books being
falling, and he says, "I would like you to make me a thumb rope,"
he says, "to tighten up these books for they're scattering on
