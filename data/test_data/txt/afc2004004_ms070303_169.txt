Last stanza
So weavin's a trade that never can fail
While we aye need a clout to haud anither hale
So let us now be merry ower a bicker o' gude ale
And drink to the health o' the weaver
For 'twerena the weaver what wad we do
We wadna get claith made o rar' oo'
And the very best o' tailors wod get naithing sew
And it werena for the honorable weaver
