The Boston Burglar: Margaret Barry.  Music
1)  I was born in Boston City, boys, a place you all know well,
Brought up by honest parents, the truth to you I'll tell.
Brought up by honest parents and reared most tenderly,
Till I became a sporting youth at the age of twenty-three.

2)  My character it was broken and I was sent to jail,
My friends will band together to get me out on bail,
But the jury found me guilty and the clerk he wrote it down.
And the judge he passed out my sentence saying, "You're bound for Charley'stown."

3)  To see my dear old father standing at the bar,
Likewise my dear old mother, a-tearing of her hair,
And a-tearing of her old grey locks and the tears come tumbling down
"My son, my son, what have you done thatyou're bound for Charley's town?"

4)  There is a girl in Boston, a girl that I know well,
And if ever I gain my liberty, her compnay I'll shun.
For the rambling or gambling, or the drinking of strong rum,
Now all you gallant highwaymen, hear to hwat I will say.
Never go out rambling at night, before the break of day.
For if you do, you surely will rue, your life will be like mine,
You'll be sent to Dublin for seven long years to a place called Charley's town.

Talk on Bonnie Anne, by Jean Robertson.
Robertson: It must be three hundred years old. . . .
Lomax: And how doyou know that it was Lord Fyvie that. . .
Robertson: It was, you see, because even the story, too, was written
after that. Andrew Lammie came home from Edinburgh town - that's
where he got when she was killed; she was getting buried when he
come hame frae Edinburgh toon, and of course, do you understand
what it meant when he said, "a cowie was lowin" ? - Well, it was
when he was playing a trumpet. They heard his trumpet loud and 
shrill - it was heard at the mill of Tuftie, you see. That's in it, too.
Lomax: Well, millers in those days were very important people, too.
Robertson: O he wouldna be nothing compared to a lord and all his
money. Her father -- You see, they were very, very angry because she
wouldna take the Lord. I eam - here was a great rich lord wanting
his daughter, and yet she preferred his servant. But then she had
a true love for the servant.
Lomax: It was a pretty severe kindof punishment to actally break her back.
