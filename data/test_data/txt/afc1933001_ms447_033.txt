187. Jes - se James was a lad that
killed a - ma - ny a man; He robbed the Dan - ville
train. But that dir - ty lit - tle cow - ard that
shot Mis - ter How - ard Has laid poor Jes - se in the grave.

It was Rob - ert Ford that
dir - ty lit - tle cow - ard, I won-der how he does
feel, For he ate of Jes - se's bread and he
slept in Jes - se's bed, Then laid poor Jes - se in his grave.

chil-dren they were brave; But that dir-ty lit-tle cow-ard that
shot Mis-ter How-ard Has laid poor Jes-se in his grave.
