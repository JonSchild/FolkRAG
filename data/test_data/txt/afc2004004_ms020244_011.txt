OVER YONDER
A lullaby spiritual

I has a sister
Over yonder,
I has a sister,
Over yonder,
I has a sister
Over yonder,
On that other shore.

By and by,
I am going to see her,
By and by,
I am going to see her,
By and by,
I am going to see her
On that other shore.

I has a mother,
Over yonder, etc.

Oh, I wonder what's the matter
Over yonder, etc.

Maybe rung the bells, Lord,
Over yonder, etc.

Can't you hear them bells a-toning,
Over yonder, etc.

By and by,
I am going to see them, etc.
