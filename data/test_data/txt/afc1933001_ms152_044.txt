Dear Mrs. Buchanan:

A number of years ago my father recorded
several songs of J.M. Hunt in Marion, Virginia.
Recently in compiling our new book of American folk
songs we decided to use two of these: Santy Anno and
Haul Away, My Rosie.

We wrote Mr. Hunt for permission. He replied
by giving us permission but said that you had published
the first and suggested that we write you for permission
to use the song. Both my father and myself would very
much appreciate your giving us permission to reprint
this song with proper acknowledgement.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
