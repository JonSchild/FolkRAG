Dear Professor Lomax:

Recently i suggested to Reader's Digest, for whom
I write articles now and then, that I would like to prepare
a piece for them on "America's song explorers"--
yourself and others. They replied, and I think wisely,
that instead of an article on America's song explorers
they would prefer to have me tackle an article on John
A. Lomax.

Accordingly, I talked this afternoon with Alan Lomax,
and learned that he has here in the Library a considerable
cache of biographical and autobiographical material,
some of it scheduled for your autobiography. We
agreed that I should write you for permission to go through
the material he has.

The article I have in mind would be very short, and
would of course only scratch the surface of the material
available. So far as I can see, it would help rather than
hinder later sale of an autobiography. I would be glad to
have you check the MS. before publication if you wish, and
I would expect to mention your various works now in print.
If you have any other terms or conditions in mind, I'd be
glad to hear from you.

I plan to go to work as soon as I hear from you, with
an end-of-October deadline in view. If you have any suggestions
on what you believe should be emphasized, will you
let me have them?

Sincerely yours,
[ BRECHER, EDWARD M. ]
