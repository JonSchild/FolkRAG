When Henry Kaiser arrived
in Washington he was late
for an appointment with the 
newspapermen.
"What happened?" the
reporters asked the man
who had broken all ship-building
speed records.
"I had to wait thirty
minutes for a taxi", explained
Kaiser.
"Thirty minutes?" a
newspaperman asked. "then
why didn't you build
one?"
