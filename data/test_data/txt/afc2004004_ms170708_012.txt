On people & money - Harry Cox
Them that have got little, want to get more, &
they want to be a little above other people. But
the freest people you'll find are them that ain't
got much. Them what ha' got it, they are still
grabbing for more, & they want to keep you down. 
Like when you do a job - I have been to these
here little people what ain't got a lot. You'll 
get a cup o' tea, cocoa during the time. But go out
to a big one & you'll get nothing, & they'll try to
cut you off a shilling when you finish.
Give me the lower classes. I don't go upon
the rich. You won't get nothing out of a man
that has got a lot, its no use going to ask.
Wouldn't lend you anything. He won't give you
anything. The lower class are the ones.
