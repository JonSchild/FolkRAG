throwing together many small ones and particularly in turning
certain stretches of land into sheep and cattle runs, it was
inevitable that not [in] a few former tenants should find themselves
unprovided for and a good many actually turned off, particularly
the cottars with little more than a dwelling house and their
labour, who had clustered round the hamlets would find that for
them no place had been provided except to become the hinds of the
large farmers. In the island itself, there was no way of
fully absorbing this derelict population; some would find
settlements in other quarters, others crossed to the mainland;
a considerable number heard more loudly than ever the call
of the west and emigrated. "Bay chaleur" were the words of 
charm.
