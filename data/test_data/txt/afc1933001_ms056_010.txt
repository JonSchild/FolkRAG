Port Aransas, Texas
3/11/1939

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

Mr. Dornbush has asked for the near-impossible, but I will
at once make some enquiries by letter and let you hear.  One
group in San Angelo might do.  They, sons and grandsons of
cowpunchers, now young business men, will wish to know much more
about what this particular Washington meeting is.
You yourself have told me of the frequency that criticisms
of me come to you because I am not a technically trained
musician.  While I recognize the reasonableness of this point of
view, I want to show you that I have other qualities partly
compensating.  Something, too, you should show the Librarian
should he again, for any reason, become disturbed about me.  You
certainly have always give me evidence of your friendship and
confidence.  Alan, too, for that matter.
I can at least promise to quit sending you so many letters
to decipher.  We are quite ready to start when the machine comes.
Miss Terrill and I both hope Mrs. Spivacke will soon be well.
Give her out love.  Sincerely,
John A. Lomax
