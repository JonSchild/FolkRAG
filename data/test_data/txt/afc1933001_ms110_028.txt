my mind, me that liekes to know what I am doing and what I am going to do. We did the works at Galveston and came home by Shiner where one of the girls on the party lived. Ther4 was a brewery there that belonged to a family friend and we really overworked it. I had called Hart's office when we went thru Houston and found that Johnny was in seguin only fifty miles from Shiner so he came over and spent the afternoon (late) and the evening (also late) with us. We all had a grand time, went to a German dance, a beer garden and swimming among other things. But my little home looked mighty nice after all.

/Well we must go on to town and mail this and will write again real soon and give more detail of the shopping trip.

Lots of love,

Sh.
