But I will wander hame again all naked and quite bare
And back to Glesca I winna gae to ha'e a spree nae mair.
Come, oh you, pluming lads and listen to me
And I'll tell you a story that's nae a word o' a lee.
My name I needna mention, it's hardly worth the while
I am a lonely bailie lad that near to Tarvis dwell.
I canna yoke your horses. I canna haud your plow
Nor work, nor bind the harvest, but I can feed your coo
It fell upon an evening we all to Tarvis went
To get some drink and music.
The truth do I tell.
When we arrive in Tarvis two Duthies we did pass
To get some drink and music and make our hearts feel glad.
The lad that gi'ed the music his name I needna hide
There was some gaed there for boots and shoes
And some gaed there for claes.
But I gaed there for Brose
There was very few that I knew there
And as few there knew me 
Excepting one amongst the rest
Who tried to upset me.
We down to Mr. Phillips went to try and get some fun
When there I was ensnared with the maiden of the inn.
She was a lovely maiden — a maiden that she be
Twa rolling e'en and twa rosy cheeks
A lovely girl was she. 
When ten o'clock began to strike we a'made out for hame
When at the very moment a man in blue came by
He cursed and swore and damned me if I widna haud ma tongue
He would march me in to custody and that afore long
He hugged and tugged and pulled at me
His sense he didna spare
But I did shortly show to him the he would need a pair
Assistance then came up to him and showed me to the door
