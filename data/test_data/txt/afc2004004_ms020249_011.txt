Reel #5, Song 5
[*35*]

ON THE EAST COAST LINE
A ring play

'Way down yonder,
Hey,
On the east coast line,
Hey,
They eatin' syrup by the gallon,
Hey,
They eatin' meat by the pound
Hey,
They eatin' bread by the pone,
Hey,
She neat in the waist,
Hey,
And she pretty in the face,
Hey,
And if I was you,
Hey,
And you was me,
Hey,
I'd stop right still,
Hey,
And I'd shake it back.

Shake it to the east,
Shake it to the west,
Shake it to the very one
You love the best.
