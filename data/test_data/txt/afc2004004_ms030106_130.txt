That can never be music.
I first went to Memphis -- I went to Memphis around
1908 - possibly the early part of the year.  At that time
I was very shy about trying to play piano any places.  I'd
never play until I would find out who was the best
man on a piano.  The simple reason why I had been to
several places and every place that I had been they seemed
to have accepted me as superior.

When I went to Memphis, I went there with a fellow 
from Jackson, Mississippi I had met there.  It was very often
the boys to be recognized as somebody would use alias names.
This was a little bit a guy.  Seems like he stole his name
from some other big tough guy.  He named himself, I believe, 
Jack the Bear.    Maybe you heard that one - I'm sure in your travels.
Jack the Bear said, "Let's go to Memphis."  I said, "All right."
He said, "Let's hobo."  I said, "No, I can't hobo.  I tried
that once for twenty miles.  When I got off the train I had on 
a sixty dollar suit of clothes --I thought the train was going 
slow so I got off in a little town called Pascagoola (sic), Miss. --
just as the train drove across the drawbridge -- I thought
it was slowing down and I jumped off and I jumped off and I fell
head foremost and tore the knees of my trousers of the sixty
dollar brand new suit of clothes.  So I don't have to do that
no more.  So I wouldn't go that way."
