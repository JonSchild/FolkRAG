A

Joke

Last week in the Times
there was a joke about hitler
+ a brain specialist. The brain
specialist was examining hitler's
so called brain. On the bottom
of the picture there were typewritten
words (referring to hitler of course)
saying 10 years to late. Meaning
hitler called the brain specialist 10
years to late.
