     Finally, the Archive of American Folk-Song can do much
more than indicated in my previous memorandum. Its material
can be very useful in all types of community work as well 
as in the preparation of radio scripts having regional or 
national appeal.
     These are but a few suggestions and we can elaborate on 
any of them or make additional proposals to suit special 
situations.

Respectfully submitted,
