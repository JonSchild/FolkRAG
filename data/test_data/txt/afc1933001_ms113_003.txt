Dear Miss Lomax:

Enclosed are the leaflets for Albums 1 through
5. At the time the Albums were shipped to you by the
Recording Laboratory, the leaflets were not ready. Evident-
ly no record was kept of the omission and I am glad you
reminded us. 

Album 2 should contain records 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
If you will check the contents again and note the missing
number, we shall we glad to fill the omission. Will you kindly
return the extra copy of 8. How do you like the Albums?
We should appreciate the comments of you, Nick Ray and Charles
Smith.

As you know, I wrote Charles Smith recently acknow-
ledging receipt of the W. C. Handy transcription and requesting
similar recordings. Perhaps you can keep us in mind in this 
connection.

I had heard of your new job with the OWI and want to
congratulate you. We miss you and want you to keep in touch.

Sincerely yours,

B. A. Botkin
