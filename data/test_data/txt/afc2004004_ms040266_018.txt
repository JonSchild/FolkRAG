singing student in Italy. One morning she put her head
out of her window and started to sing; everyone in the street
joined in. I can solemnly assure you that when I did
exactly the same in Ortona and sang one of the local songs
it was taken up by unseen voices all around until everyone
in the neighborhood seemed to be singing. I often tried
this and it always worked!
One rather litany-like sone with a kind of dying fall,
beginning [scratch out] how Posso Piu Cantare" was always called 'Stormelle
Abruzzese". Once when on a visit to Rome I was astonished
to hear its strange melody being played by a street organ. (a beautiful
new instrument with love-birds in a cage on top). Everything came
to a stop in the street while the passers-by stood round listening with
evident appreciation. I asked the organ-man what it was called,
and he said "Stornelle Romane". I told him that in Abruzzo they called it "Stornelle
Abruzzese". He shrugged and said - "Oh, everyone knows it - they give it a name 'lecondo la vicinita"!
One common sight which you didn't mention was a group
of girls coming down a hillside with gigantic bundles of brushwood on
their heads, so that the bearer was quite dwarfed, singing as they
went. The effect was quite bizarre. But no doubt this was only
one of the many things which shortage of time did not allow you
to include.
I very much hope you will soon broadcast more of your
enchanting programmes.   Yours sincerely, Joan Hardstone
