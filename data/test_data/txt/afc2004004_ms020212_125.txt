1/23- Wrote Bessie

Dear Mr. Lomax,
It was with some amazement that I read your recent letter, since
I had written you a letter in the fall.  Apparently the letter was either
lost in the mails or simply was never dropped in a mail-box.  In any case,
I am sorry that you were kept waiting so long.
When we first began thinking about contacting the people you recorded,
many things were uncertain.  We had to wait untill we knew who would be
able to come, what our budget would be, and so on.  Furthermore, we had
certain commitments to other people which had to be fulfilled.  To be
honest, we were afraid your fee would be to high, but regardless of this,
by the time you wrote, all the MC positions had been filled.  I admit, it
was quite an oversight, and the festival certainly would have been enhanced
with your participation.
We ha ve had a great deal of difficulty getting a response from
Bessie Jones.  We have written a number of letters trying to get a hold
of her, and have even sent her two sets of contracts.  We want her to be 
in the festival alone, and really don't understand why we haven't received
the contract.  She has, of course, already agreed to appear.
We hope that you'll be able to come to the festival.  If you do,
you will have two complimentary seats for each concert.  We [*will*] send you
a schedule of all the events as soon as it is printed up.
Thank you for all your suggestions and help, and especially for
making it possible for us to know about these people.  Some of your
suggestions came to late, but they will be seriously considered for next
year.  Please let us know if you are coming, so that we can set aside the
tickets.
Thank you,
Bob Kass
