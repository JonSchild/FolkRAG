Dear Alan:
As I guess you know, Dr. Smith is doing a program at the MENC
meeting which will originate in Milwaukee.  It's going to be a symphonic
job, and one of the numbers is Copland's Joh Henry which I think was 
commissioned for your first year's School of the Air series.  Smith thinks
it would be a nice idea to have it sung first to point up the piece;
will you be around and in voice on the thirty-first?  Peter will also 
be out there, but as I remember the version it's one that you could do
better than he. You want to write me about this?  It isn't definite yet;
we'd just like to line it up now in case we want to use it.  If you are
going to be available, then we'll start negotiating with the budget
people, you see. 
By the way, how are you going out to Milwaukee?  Charlie, when 
I last saw him, said he thought you might be driving up with him; if so, 
I sure would die to come along,  The boys are also all going out but they're
making a two weeks tour our of the thing, and it's lining up pretty 
well already. 
Then are you ever coming to New York?  In your last letter to 
Pete you said something about it.  I have a jillion things to talk to you 
about, and I keep planning to come up but I'm busy as a dog with two-
headed fleas and I also am spending what money I get on clothes and 
doctor bills.  Im established up at CBS now, not on salary but with full
equipment and it look like a pretty sure thing.  Write soon and love to 
Elizabeth and Corey and  you 

Bess
