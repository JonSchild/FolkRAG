Tuesday.
Monday I finally solved the
tape problem - got all Irish 
songs in order, not quite
cut, but a good plan at
last. Now I know it
will be beautiful, but God
what a job.
Also shopped with Robbi
on her first day up.
Lots of resolutions &
one speech about our seperation
Rob says nothing.
Took Rob to Oxford to
see a good gynecologist
who says she has a chocolate
tumor on her right ovary that may respond
