Cox:  Yes. I've known... I know people been sent off to
America rather than...when they ha' been a-gettin' too thick.  Now
an' again when they thought she haven't been good enough.  They
want 'em to - like to get 'em away an'
Glad to get 'em away from 'em.  Things like that.  If they'd let 'em
alone, they'd ha' been better off.
Lomax:  Of course they would.
Cox:  Yes. Best thing is to let it alone.

Lomax:  What's the first song you ever learned, Harry? Do you
remember?
Cox:  I, er...Yes. Sweetheart May an' the likes o' that.  In my time.
Sweetheart May, that was one a-goin' when I was a boy.
Lomax:  What's the first part of that?
Cox:  Well, o' course, "Sweetheart May, you'll grow up some day."
You heard it, ain't you? "You may marry another, an' my love
betray." That was a song I larnt. An' Sunshine o' Paradise Ahead.
That was another one.  The first pub I started to sing in was the
Union Tavern at               I was about eleven, an' went
along with my father.  They kidded me up to singin' there.
Lomax:  Tell me what happened that night when you first started.
Cox:  Well, I...they made a gatherin'. I sung two or three o' my
piece songs; an' sent around the hat.  I got- I got a few pence.
Copper or two.  I didn't get a lot, you know.  I got some anyhow.
An' then I - I gradually worked into it when I grew older.  When I
used to go into these here pubs, they never would let me have a
rest. "Give us a song", that's how they'd start.
