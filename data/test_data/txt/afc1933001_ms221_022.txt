own chance.- Just now you are
free to choose for yourself.
My point at the moment is
that, no matter what your
income, unless you yourself,
Alan Lomax, resolute and determined,
follow[ed] a definite
and planned course, independent
of any influence, you'll land
in a poor-house, eventually.

Am I crazy that I value
my independence? That I
don't have to consider the opinions
of any man? My country
gives me the right to speak
out. My course in life has
given me in this country the chance
to speak my mind and be unafraid.
Lovingly, Father
