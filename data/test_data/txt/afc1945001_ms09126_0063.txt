Ernestine Holloway

1. I heard a lady say last Saturday when I
was in a dress shop that beginning April 1,
1943 they are going to ration clothes.

2. At the plant where my father works they
say that is they continue to draft young
men the plant will have to close 
down.  Everytime they train a man for some
certain job and he has begun to understand
how to do it well, the army takes
him and they get another and the
same thing happens.

3. I also heard that they were going to
begin drafting women into the WAACs.
