Dear Alan,

1). Bellvue Hospital says Leadbelly will be able to go to 
Mexico City

2). We now await a contract from the National Defense
Council which will enable us to begin to dispense
money for the Mexican performance. As soon as 
that arrives, I shall send you a check for $250.00
Please be sure to let me have your itinerary.

It has now been arranged for the Quartet and Leadbelly
to leave here by plane on Monday, August,11th. This
means you will connect with the plane that night in 
Atlanta instead of the preceding night.

All of you are scheduled to return on a plane leaving Mexico City on Sunday, August 17th.

Sincerely yours,
Sterling Fisher
