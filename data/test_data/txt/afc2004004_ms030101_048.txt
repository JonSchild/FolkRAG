Curry road

9. If I loose dis baby
Mama make me loose it
Take a piece of fine stick
And lick (rap) me 'cross my navel.

10. Way down curry road
        "       "         "       "
        "       "         "       "

Mama beat me for you
      "       "     "     "     "
      "    kick   "     "     "
      "    beat   "     "     "
      "    kill     "     "     "
Dat aint de first one you know
Meet my love de odder day
Would not talk to me
     "      "      "    "    "
