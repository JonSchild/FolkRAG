Dear Mr. Putnam:
   Herewith please find
a copy of my [work] report to
the Carnegie Corporation for the
year 1934, and also a copy of a request
for additional support
for 1935 - made at the suggestion
of Mr. Lester of the Corporation.
   At the meeting of the Folk
Lore and Folk Song Committees at
the Philadelphia meeting of the Modern
Language Association, held
late in December (Mr. Strunk and
I are both members), I was glad
to find a united sentiment in
favor of making the Library of
Congress the repository for all Folk
material collected in the United
States.
