1.  Once a lady, who was riding on a crowded street car, decided to get off in front to keep from pushing through the crowd to try to get off at the back, where colored people were suppose to get off.  After fussing with the bus driver for a length of time, she got off at the back and came around to a front window and said in a horrible tone, "When the Japs come we'll all be nigers and ride in the back."
2.  "The Japs says the colored people are their friends;  and if
they keep cool the whites shall be conquered."
3.  The Germans says;
"Some day that's bright, sunny and fair,
the Americans will be close to the electric chair." 
4.  Two girls walking along the street:
    Harriette_ Don't worry about James, Clara, because the Japs
    aren't going to bother colored people;  if only he could 
    shun the Germans.
   Clara_ I wonder if its true.  James say he getting along fine.
