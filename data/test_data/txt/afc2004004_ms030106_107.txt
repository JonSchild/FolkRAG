Morton:  No, no.  He was light complected.  He was what
you call a light brown-skinned boy.
Question:  Did he drink hard?
Morton:  Drank all the whiskey he could find or anybody
else could find.  And a funny thing about those guys in
those days, a musician didn't think he was a good musician if
he had a collar and tie on.  He wouldn't wear a collar and tie.
He would have his shirt busted wide open, every button open
and have a red flannel undershirt so the girls could see him 
and that was a great fad.  The girls and women, how they did go
for those red undershirts!
