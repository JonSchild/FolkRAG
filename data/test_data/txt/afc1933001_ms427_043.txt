NANCY LEE

Of all the wives as e'er you know, Yeo-ho! lads! ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
There's none like Nancy Lee, I trow, Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
See there she stands an' waves her hand up-on the quay
An' ev'ry day when I'm away she'll watch for me,
An' whisper low when tempests blow,for Jack at sea;Yeo-ho! lads ho! Yeo-ho!

CHORUS:
The sailor's wife the sailor's star shall be Yeo-ho! we go across the
sea.
The sailor's wife the sailor's star shall be.
The sailor's wife his star shall be.

The harbor's past, the breezes blow, Yeo-ho! lads! ho!Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
'Tis long ere we come back, I know, Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
But true and bright from morn till night my home will be,
An' all so neat an' snug asn' sweet for Jack at sea,
An' Nancy's face to bless the place, an welcome me; Yeo-ho! lads! ho! Yeo-ho

CHORUS:

The bo'-s'n pipies the watch below, Yeo-ho! lads! ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
['Tis long ere we come back, I know, Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!]
Then here's a health before we go, Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
A long, long life to my sweet wife an' mates at sea, An
An' keep my bones from Davy Jones where'er we be,
An' may you meet a mate as sweet as Mancy Lee; Yeo-ho! lads! ho'Yeo-ho!

CHORUS:



STEAL AWAY

Steal away, steal away, Steal away, to Jesus
Steal away, steal away home, I ain't got long to stay here.

1. My Lord calls me,
He calls me by the thunder;
The trumpet sounds within a my soul!

Steal away, etc.

2. Green trees bending,
Poor sinner stands a trembling;
The trumpet sounds within a my soul!

Steal away, etc.

3. My Lord calls me, He calls me by the lightning;
The trumpet sounds within a my soul.
