And you don't trick him, you woo him, and
the magical hunt is like that, because with
one bullet and with the gun exploding, ah,
Jack, the hero, um, gets all the animals in
the forest - a dozen ducks and a flight of
geese, and a - and a, and a deer - and a deer
with a, ah, a cherry tree growing out of his
ah, out of his ah horns.  Ah, you've all heard
that story from Baron Munchausen, the great 
Russian storyteller, who was a big liar about
the animal hunt.  And here Ray tells it to us
as if it happened yesterday.  And he makes
you believe it, because he says he went to
Jack's house one day and asked Jack could be
go along, and he actually goes on the hunt
and he actually sees all these wonderful
things.  So ah . . . 

[*JACK*]     Jack, the character he talks about, is the
ancient European trickster-hero.  In France
he's called Tijon, and ah in Spain he's
called Juan and in ah, ah, the Teutonic world
he, he's called Little Hans, and ah, in Great
Britain he's called Jack, from the French
Jacques of course.
