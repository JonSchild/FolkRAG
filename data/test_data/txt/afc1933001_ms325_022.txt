Was One of Series
Weldon and Paul Reynolds, WDBJ 
studio director, collaborated in the 
production of the American School 
of the Air broadcast which won 
first place. Reynolds announced 
the program, and a group of mountain 
string musicians the "Bog 
Trotters," of Galax, were the feature 
artists. The broadcast was one of 
the Tuesday morning series, "Folk 
Music of American," and was devoted 
to square dance tunes and mountain 
ballads.
The Galax musicians who played 
and sang on the program were 
"Uncle Alec" Dunford, Dr. W. P. 
Davis, Crockett Ward, Fields Ward, 
and Wade Ward. William Fineshriber 
of Columbia's New York staff, 
produced the program, and Alan 
Lomax, folk music expert, was the 
commentator.
The Junior League broadcast was 
one of the Saturday morning series 
and was given by a cast made up 
entirely of children, the oldest 13 
years old. Mrs. A. A. Farnham, 
chairman of the Children's Theatre 
committee of the Junior League, 
narrated and directed the production.
Members of the cast were: Bobby 
Heins, George Thrasher, and Harrison 
Weinstein, as the three dwarfs; 
Sylvia Farnham, the stepmother; 
Hermine Weiner as Helen; Mildred 
Jones as Margaret; Harrison Weinstein 
as the king. Sound effects 
were handled by Virginia Donnam.
Station WDBJ entered transcriptions
of three other local educational 
programs in the contest, two
from the V. P. I. series and the
third a broadcast made by the
Jefferson high school a cappella
choir.
