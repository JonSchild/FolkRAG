Lomax: Was she a traveller as well?
Davy: No, she was a towngirl - an Aberdeen girl. But that was
just a queer feeling came over me, I couldn't help it myself.
Lomax: Well, were the travelling people pretty free? When you
were out travelling could you always have a woman after that if
you wanted one?
Davy: I was frightened after it for a long, long time. Because
you always think to yourself, you're alone with a girl even in
a house. A traveller's very witty. He knows if there's one
person in the house he's very frightened to be in a house with
a girl on her own. Even where you're buying old rags at the
door, the woman will say to you, "Come in for a few minutes.
I'll get the stuff out for ye." Well, I say, "Oh Missus, I'll
stand outside." Because you never know what people might say.
Or the woman's husband might come in - think you were robbing the
house. I always tell the people I'd rather stand outside - even
the people tha always give me a cup of tea. And if there's no
man in the house I wouldn't go in - frightened. Unless the
people knew me very, very, very well. If it's a strange house and 
me walking in and the woman by herself, I would rather stand
outside and take a cup of tea. There was a case where I was going
to play the accordian - offered a cup of tea in some houses. The
woman said, "O come in and have a cup of tea." I'd say, "Is
there a man in?" She'd say, "No, he won't be long, he's working."
"Oh well, Missus, I'LL just take it outside the door." Always
the best way, brcause you might get into a house and 
and the woman, thinking you may do something, maybe frightened,
would go outside and leave you sitting inside the house, and 
she might go away to the police, and you'd be lifted for nothing
at all. So always safe, and be outside. On the safe side.
Lomax: Tell me about your travels. When did you first start
out on your own?
Davy: Oh I went away when I was about 8 years old. I went away
from Aberdeen to meet my cousin Blind Robin Hutchinson. I stayed
with his father. His mother is my aunt - my father's sister - all
dead now. But me and him went together, and we had a wheelbarrow
hurdy - balloons, toys, and we used to gather old rugs and brass
and copper. And he would get his pipes sometimes for the
children. Went to different towns, collecting for him and leading
him as he marched up and down with his pipes, touching his arm
telling him the people was gone. He was blind.
Lomax: Was he kind to you?
Davy: Oh yes, he was a very nice man. He used to learn me all
the songs. In fact "amish has got two tapes of Robin singing.
He was a fine singer.
