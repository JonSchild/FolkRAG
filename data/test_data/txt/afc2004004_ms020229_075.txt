Anyway, she ah, ah, she carried me to this hall.  She said,
"Come on go out with us."  Said, "You all stay in the house too
much.  Said, "Come on, got wit' me."  So, "Go somewhere. . .Jes' git
around somewhere."  Say, "An' learn the peoples."
      So I went with her.  Went to this hall.  Got up in this hall, I, no,
you could hear the folks dancin' an' the music was goin'.  She
said, "We goin' to Davis Hall."
     Said, "All right."  Went up there an' we -- I stood to the
door.  I said, "I ain't goin' in there."
     An' somehow or other I -- she say, "You ain't comin' here!"
     I said, "No, I jus' don' wanna go in."
     An' that was his hall.

     He said, "I ain't never seen ya in there."
     I said, "I didn't go inside.  I went up to, up to, up to the
do' as you go in --"  Jus' like you go up in that church us
