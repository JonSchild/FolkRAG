A Short Story
Once upon a time there was a military 
homing pigeon.  And as it was flying
leisurely to its destination with a report
from the front, it was jostled by a
second pigeon, which bawled:
"Get a move on.  I've got a denial of
the report."
Definition
The meanest men in the world - the one who
yells boom in a high explosion room.
