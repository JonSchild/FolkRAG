1.  The private went to the commanding
officer one weekend, for a furlough. 
"My wife's expectiing," he said.  So he
got the furlough.  The next weekend
he said the same thing. "My wife's
expecting."  He got the furlough.
The third week he said the

wife expecting," roared the
Commanding officer.  "She's
expecting me," replied the private.
