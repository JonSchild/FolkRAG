Reverend Roe.  Reel 13. P. 1
[*More false accusations*]
[Yessir, I used to live in] Celeste, Texas.  There was a deacon out there that
had a sweetheart[,] and he had been fooling out of all her money before
I [became] begin pastor there, and after I beg[a]in pastoring, I taught them
different, and she would come to church every Sunday, and bring me
a nice present.  This felow didn't like it.  And he began to s'picion
me, [and] when there wasn't any improper relation between me and the woman.
But he thought so.  And on one occasion I was preaching a sermon and I knew what he had
been saying and how he had tried to scandalize my name, and I told
a story -- want to hear that? -- about an old [goat] dog we had.  His name

have with me a [mower's] large knife that one of my trustees left with me
that day.  I opened the knife.  I told the women to let him alone,
that he was just looking for a man and I was a man.  Just turn him loose.
I walked up and caught him by [the] his shoulder[,] & led him outdoors and told
him, "If [you] he wanted anything that I had, I's [was] ready."  He soon come
down and went away with a promise that he wouldn't bother me any more.
But he went to a white man in the city and told him a lot of stories
about me, and when I came on my next visit, a lot of my members met
me at the train and told me I'd better catch the next train and go
back because this white man was going to kill me.  And I told them I
was going up and see the white man, and they tried to prevail with
