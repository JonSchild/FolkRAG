     Ah, a white lady asked me once in Miami, Miss Lilly McGann,
where I was workin' there so long there?  The way I tell ya I
got that job that time, that man call me?  She asked me one day,
she was sittin' down crochetin', an' so I says. . .ah, what ya call
it?  Infantile paralysis was gittin' rough along in there you
know.  Y-y-you know, oh, what the chilren have, ya know.  Infantile
paralysis or sumpin', say.  An' so anyway, they was sittin'. . .
TL:  I don't know what those are.  In --?
BJ:  You know, the, infantile paralysis.  Well, what ya sell these
stamps now, you know, for children?  In, in, an' walks on crutches
an' things, cripple.  See?
TL:  Oh, polio?
BJ:  Yeah.  Dey, dey, yeah, they, yeah, they done named it another
thing, ya know, now.
TL:  It's the same thing.
BJ:  Yeah.  It's the same thing; it's infantile paralysis; that's
what it is.  An', but they say "polio," now, see, done
named it another name.
TL:  Well, they call it infantile paralysis, too, but I didn't
know that's what you were saying.
BJ:  Yeah, that's what it was.  An' so, that's what it is.  An'
that's what she asked me one day.  It's now an' then ya hear
talk a colored peoples have it, ya know.  They don't have it much.
An' so she asked me one day, she said. . .I is, I's a-busy workin'
an' I's tired an' I's rushin' gittin' her work done, an' I didn't
feel like talkin'.  An' I, so. . .The Lawd just hand me a quick word
to say; I didn't know what to say right quick; I jus' answered
her, ha, ha, ha!  In a hurry.
