settlements, consisting of small plantation clearings along the 
Mississippi and its tributaries.

The early settlers migrated there in the seventies and eighties. 
They came from the "hills" of Mississippi, from Alabama, and a few from 
Georgia. At first they were slow to migrate to the Delta country 
because of the devastating floods which took a heavy toll of life and 
property; gradually they migrated in increasing numbers and found land 
extremely productive.

The people who cleared the forests and cultivated the plantations 
in the seventies and eighties, were of a hardy pioneering stock. They 
struggled with nature but the wild game and beasts were plentiful. They struggled with the river: they lived almost an amphibian life. 
They knew the water as they knew the land; they had to be skillful 
boatmen as well as skillful farmers.

This was the era of the river culture. The trading settlement 
and towns were steamboat landings. The most important trade center in 
the county was Friars Point at Port Royal, which was the county seat.

Harnessing the river and the railroad came about the same time. 
There had been some attempt at levee building before the Civil War but 
these inadequate earth barriers to the floods had fallen into disrepair 
during the war. In 1884, the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee district 
was organized and systematic levee construction begun. Short line of 
railroad were constructed in 1877 from the river to Lula, a distance 
of eight miles, and two years later the line was extended from Eagles 
Nest to Clarksdale. In 1884 [cicrlec] a section of railroad was completed 
through the county as a part of the line connecting Memphis to New 
Orleans.
