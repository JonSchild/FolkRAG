dialect, took, the Parisian speaks a dialect.  And you speak
another kind of French.  And, and he, he thinks his is
better than yours for some reason.
     :  Well that's the thing that bothers me
and I don't understand it.  But I, I do not want to lose my
identity.  It's not best, it's not best in, in the Parisian
or [Cebyquor] or the Belgians or [wherever] speaks French.
And my God, it's mine.  Why do you want to take it away from
me?
AL  But you're actually doing something
about it.  You're going to the schools, aren't you, and 
[INAUDIBLE]?
     :  Yeah. I, I, I could, I could accept if
they taught Parisian French, but to show the comparison, to
show -- my grandchildren said, for an example, you
grandfather will call a truck a  truck.  But in Parisian
French [FRENCH].  But the reason your grandfather say a 
truck is because when the truck, the truck was invented your
grandfather didn't have no communication with, with the
country of France.  So therefore, he had to adopt the
English word, truck.  And then he would understand why I say
truck.  But not come over here and say, Pappa, that's not
right.  That, that bothers me.
