ROLL 14 Interview with Shelton family.

ALAN LOMAX:   You travel a lot, don't you.   And it' a different route?
Where do you go?

MAN:   Well, into Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, all over
North Carolina.   And Baltimore, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
that's about the extent of it.

AL:    We're talking to the Shelton family, whose leader, or misleader,
is Mr. Ki English.   Are you related to the Shelton family?

MAN:    No, I'm not related.  We don't have one, . . .I try to be the
spokesman, but I tell you they better find somebody else, because

MAN:    Definitely, strictly gospel.   And that is it.

AL:    What do you mean by gospel exactly?

MAN:    Anything that would have country or rock, anything of the Lord,

tall.   When did you start, Maydonna, how old?

MAYDONNA:    I guess I was about eight when I started.   Me and my sisters.
It was younger than that we started trying to sing in trio at home.

ENGLISH:   She had a father that was a typical American.   I mean typical.
He had this sling (?) and he always used something like a cover on a bed. .
you call it a "kipper" (?) is that right?   I mean he was just a plain old
country man.   And then Linda, she is the half of the orchestra, and
we use one guitar, its amplified, and then we've got Leroy Carver, and
