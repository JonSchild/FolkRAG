During this song  the women who had staggered was mildly
possessed, dance about the the crouching and angular/posture that
Gran Erzulie usually assumes, and at last , leaning against the
center post of the tonnelle, threw her arms over her head
grasped the pole and , stretching herself as if in agony, writhed
in time to the drums. The song is at times sung in honor of
Maitresse Erzulie Freda , the daughter of Gran Erzulie and it may
be that the confusion of these two loa is the result of the similarity
of their songs. Another possibility, of course, is that 
originally two Erzulies did not exist.

Erzulie-o, cote ou ye,
Moni dit Erzulie, cote ou ye,
Ce pas pou' bien,
Ce pas pou, mal-o,
M' crier "ago" devan Sobagi-moin.

Erzulie , where are you ,
I say, Erzulie, where are you,
It's not for good,
It's not for evil.
That I cry,"Ago", before my hounfort.

Anacelie shook her ason and called the people for a song to
Aizan, a song of greeting, a yen valou.

Aizan-o, Aizan-o,
Ce-vo-why-e,
Aizan-o, Aizan-o,
Ce-vo-why-e,
Aizan-e, laisse coule,
