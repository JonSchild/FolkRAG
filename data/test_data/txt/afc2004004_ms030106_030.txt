1645 A.  31

   Of course, I never played Aaron Harris no more. From then on I decided to be good friends with Aaron.  And, I didn't want Aaron's money any more.  Well, of course, they wrote a song about Aaron, because Aaron was known to be a ready killer.  I wouldn't be saying this now, but he's dead and gone because he got killed.  But here is the song they wrote about him:

Aaron Harris was a bad, bad man
Aaron Harris was a bad, bad man,
He is the baddest man that ever was in this land.

He killed his sweet little sister and his brother-in-law
He killed his sweet little sister and his brother-in-law
About a cup of coffee, he killed his sister and his brother-in-law.

He got out of jail every time he would make his kill
He got out of jail every time he would make his kill 
He had a hoodoo woman, all he had to do was pay the bill

All the policemans on the beat, they had him to fear,
All the policemans on the beat had old Aaron to fear.
You could always tell when Aaron Harris was near.

He pawned his pistol one night to play in a gambling game,
He pawned his pistol one night to play in a gambling game,
When old Boar Hog shot him, that blotted out his name.

That was the baddest man I ever seen.  Boy, that man was terrible.  That man would chew pig iron and spit it out, I'm telling you -- razor blades -- I'm telling you he'd chew glass up if it was necessary, the same thing that would cut a hog's entrails out.  He was a tough man, Aaron Harris was.  He was one of the toughest.

*Boar Hog -- the toughest guy around --believes he was the one killed Aaron Harris.  Aaron Harris, gambling, pawned his pistol.  Had to cross alley on the way -- two men in ambush on each side of the street.  When he crossed this alley, they shot him.  Toodlum helped.
