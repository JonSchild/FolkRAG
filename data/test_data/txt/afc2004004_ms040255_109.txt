[The]
18.6.  Old [f??galian] song -
(They used to go in 2s & 3s & fall in love

The king of Scotland going to look for his
wife & this man & his son & his dog
The three of us will go - 7 wk 3 months
we sailed before we saw land where
the ship could rest - then we saw a 
beautiful blue castle with lots of
windows & chimneys - with lots
of [o???king] horns & grasses -
They went in & saw sitting in a golden
chair the beautiful young maid
Sitting on silken cushions & I knew that 
she was the one.

I blest her & she said put yr head on my
knee & I will sing to you with my heart
I will bring to thee a harper with blue blue
eyes & beautiful teeth

He fell asleep he was so tired with sea
wandering she just whipped off his head
Thats the end of the story and how
the sad song was sung.
