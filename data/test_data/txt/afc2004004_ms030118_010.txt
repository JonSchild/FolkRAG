Did you know one thang? I reckon ouwah mothahs did right. If they was to turn us loose when ouwah feelins was on us, we'd a killed ouwahselves with ouwah feelins. Some of em did it anyhow. Tryin to satisfy ouwah feelins. Some of em did it anyhow.
(How did they kill themselves?)
Well . . . ! You know. You can git too much of any one thang. You can set down an eat too much.
(Yo u really think you can get too much of love?)
Too much of that will kill you. You jes wanna do that every time you turn around. Don't give yo'sef time to catch up, you understand? Keep yo'sef dreened out. Your jes on the way to bad health.
(Then how would you die of it?)
How would I die? You'd die wid a case of TBs.
(Did you ever know anyone who died of too much love making?)
Plenty people . . . I don't call that love. Love will learn you how to hold back. Keep from killin yo'sef. It's all right to have it but jes don't . . . .
(What do you call it?)
Greediness . . . What if you had a man that evah time you turn around, he wanna git on you? You wouldn't like that, would you?
(Well, no. But I would never make love unless I wanted to.)
Your'e talkin stuff now. Yo u oughta be a woman of mine if you talk lak that. . .Long as I be shovin you my money, all I wanna know is, Is you feelin all right. thass all I want to know. I'd nevah ast you to let me git on you. Not as long as you gittin my money, I wouldn't.
