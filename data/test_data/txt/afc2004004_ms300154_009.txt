Dear Forest City Joe,
I am talking now with Atlantic about releasing some of
the sides you made me. But I don't have a copy of your contract and
don't know the terms we agreed on. Will you please send me a copy
or the original right away. You will be gald to know that I can also
pay you a cash advance on this deal fairly soon now.
All the best
Alan Lomax
