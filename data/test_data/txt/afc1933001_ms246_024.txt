Dear Alan:  Yesterday I drove over to 
Arlington with my machine to see
Tom Benton.  He has picked up a 
lot of ballad stuff in his wanderings
which he renders on the "French
Harp".  I couldn't get any tunes, 
for he was "out of practice" But 
he proposed to get in practice
and send you records of all
he knows.  He lives at 3616 Belleview
Ave. Kansas City and can have adequate
records made.  Also he
has found two old fiddlers who play
a lot of original, home-grown
native stuff. All this he will
also record and send on to you for 
preparation in the "archives of gravity."
