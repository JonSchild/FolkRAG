Dear Mr. Lomax :

I am afraid the Rosenwald project has to be delayed. Just when
I received permission from my husband to go to the South if I wanted
to ! You remember I had told you that Dr. Redfield and Dr. Herskovits 
had applied for a fellowship for me, I did not know exactly which
one, but I thought that I would have to go to Chicago. I have been
granted Friday a Guggenheim fellowship for one year to enable me to
write up the material of previous research. I may stay in New York.

I have seen your wife yesterday to my lecture on Folklore at the
New School. It has been very nice of her to come in spite of the 
week end.

Sincerely,
Suzanne Corn Zain
