Roll 54 Stan and Hattie Hicks 2

(AL) had a lot of fun, didn't you?

Stan: Yeah, we were terrible poor, but we had a lot of fun. They'd make
us toys -- we didn't buy anything out of the store, dad didn't have no
money to buy it, but he made all of the toys that we had. We'd get around
the fireplace you know, and he'd play the dulcimer and the banjo and stuff,
and we'd roast 'taters. We just about lived on 'taters and stuff like that
you know...

AL: What kind of toys did he make you?

Stan: Well, he'd make...my sister has some right here I guess she could show
you. This is a whimmydiddles , they called it. And my sister, she'd good
to work 'em, I never did do much (unint.) i don't know whether I could
try one or not...but, I never did try. I'll try this one and see if it'll 
work. He always made us little wagons and stuff, aw, sh,,,come on now...

AL: Oh, that's no good, let's see if she can...

Stan: She can work that now...

Hat: He made pop guns and squirt guns...

Stan: Yeah, had squirt guns and pop guns, and all that...

Hat: She's doin' much better than you were...
