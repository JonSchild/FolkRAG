BJ: I, I, I, I's afraid of 'em. I liked 'em, but I afraid of 
'em, that's all.

ya know, an' what they was sayin' an' didn't know whe' they were 
likin' me or not likin' me. Ya know what I mean. But they like 
us. They like everybody, I b'lieve. . . Oh, yeah, I b'lieve they 
nice peoples, ya know? If you just treat 'em nice; that's what I believe 
[feel] about it. An' ah, an' I b'lieve that they feel some time -- 
at that time; now now, since they all civilized up there now, an' 
they gittin' more an' more out the bottom, you know, comin' out 
them bottoms, you know -- an' ah, I b'lieve that they thought the 
same thing about the peoples, thought the folks didn' like them, 
some of 'em. Tha's what I -- Some of 'em did, ya know, down 
there, 'cause they act sometime like they was afraid, too. But,
