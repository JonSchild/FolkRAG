Reverend Roe.  Reel 4-p. 6.
could I say that I love God when I hate, when I hate the being that He 
made in His own image; and God love me, and made me in His image?  Why 
then, if He made me and He made you, and we all come from one parents, 
there's no reason why that we should love one another...
When I look out on His creation, I see white deers, black deers, and 
all different colors.  I see the same in cows, I see the same in hogs.  
[*God made us all.*]
Then I look out at the earth, and I see the earth that He made, and I 
see flowers coming -- some red, some blue, some white -- all coming up on 
the same ground.  It's a mystery to me, but it's God.  And He must 
mean for us to live together.  He must have meant so.  And that was 
God's way in beautifying our world.  And I believe it would be so 
beautiful if all of us -- I don't know as we have any need for you to 
marry a white woman and me a black woman -- I don't mean that because 
there is the white flower and there is the blue flower and they keeps 
their seed apart and everybody produce their's own kind, don't it, and 
that could be the same with us.
