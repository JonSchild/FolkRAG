Years afterwards as a train
took me into Concord, New Hampshire,
where I was to lecture to the
boys of St. Pauls School, I [looked] saw
[out of] from the car window [and]
[saw a] [A] a big sign over a large
manufacturing plant. [read]
It read, "Covered Iron Works." On enquiry
I found that for many
years this Company has built the
old stage coaches (and the chains[)]
to draw them) that were famous
in early western life. Thus

"Concord chains" [that] Rod sang
for me that windy night in
New Mexico.
