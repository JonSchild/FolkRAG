security, newspapers must refrain from making any comment about certain 
occurrences until long after the event.     
       People should understand why it is that such information is delayed 
or completely withheld. If the members of the communities are confident 
that it is withheld justifiably, they will refrain from spreading 
the information by word of mouth. Newspapers, therefore, should make 
quite clear the reasons why information was not published earlier when 
they have occasion to publish a delayed story.
     If people keep to themselves what they see in the normal 
course of the day, impose upon themselves the same sort of self-discipline 
that newspapers are expected to apply, rumors will not develop. The flow 
of rumors depends upon, in part, people's confidence in their news sources. 
It is not enough for this country merely to have the most reliable information 
sources, this fact must be known by the people of the country. The 
people must have confidence in their normal sources of information or 
else rumors will run riot.
      As has been pointed out, there is need for great care in rumor 
control projects and in the development of counteracting programs. 
For example, in spite of the well-intentioned efforts taken in trying to 
squelch the rumors about the "Eleanor Clubs", reporters still find 
people saying something like "Well, maybe there aren't any Eleanor Clubs 
but there sure must be something."
