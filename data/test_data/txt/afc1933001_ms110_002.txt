INTERNAL CORRESPONDENCE
Date  May 15th, 1940
To  Father         Address
From  Johnny   Address Vinegarone Village

I herewith enclose my rehash of our 1932 Cowboy Song Saga,
some 7,000 words, I estimate. If usable, it should make a
full chapter in your projected ballad hunting reminiscenses.
Here are a batch of comments thereto:
1) It supersedes [the] my comments forwarded to you in
Feb., 1939, a copy of which I also enclose.
2) I have no copy of my present treatise, so keep carefully.
3) Separately I am returning the Log for safekeeping.
4) Naturally, be free with your criticisms. However,
I don't intend to work it over until I next come to Dallas,
which I hope won't be so far removed. By that time my
mind should be rested on the subject.
5) Bear in mind that I have no idea of [tw]hat style you
plan to adopt in the book. I try to write something for
your X book about things that Alan had partly described.
In other words part of the struggle was to keep us distinct
[?] [?] [?] as individuals and segregate our points
of view.
6) My wrestling with tenses was considerable.
7) Kindly correct diction, spelling, punctuation, and
slips.
8) Neither title suits me. 9)The cross-current ending may not suit you.
I presume you are planning to make your book more or
[?]less chronological. But I would think that you had
best bring in some recent experiences or events towards the
first, then at the end round it with some conclusions or
philosophy and that done in artful fashion. I surely would
be proud to see you make this a lasting and powerful contribution
to American literature. With your understanding
and sympathy with the folk of America, of this you are capable.
Isn't it worth the effort?
Most affectionately, your son,
John
