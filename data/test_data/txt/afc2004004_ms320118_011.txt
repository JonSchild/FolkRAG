Time Code:           Tape: 1301 cont. Canray        4

he never did bother nobody or anything,and he would sing
and play the accordion and have fun.......Cause most of the 
time....that's one thing people don't ever realize.   I know 
that for a fact.   You might go somewhere where people are 
putting out good music, and they not feeling good for their
own selves, you know.  They do it for the people, but Amadie,
to me, from what I known about him, I didn't care how it
went, but he was happy with hinself, you know?
AL: But you were telling me how he used to play behind the 
chicken wire.
C:   Yeah he had all kinds of trouble.    You know what happened?
That's the very reason he went tothe crazy hospital.   And that
man there, they used to do them kind of things, you know.  When 
Amadie was playing professionally, they would go sometimes....
