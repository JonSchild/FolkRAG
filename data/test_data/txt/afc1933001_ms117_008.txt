Dear Dr. Spivacke:

Enclosed please find invoice and copies of shipping
papers on the shipment of discs and sapphire cutting stylii
to Alan Lomax.

We greatly regret the delay but we were completely
out of stock on twelve inch discs when Lomax left and shipment
to us had been promised before that date. Due to strikes the
shipment reached us Jan. 4 and we immediately canceled the discs
for Lomax and sent them off. Apparently there was no boat until
Jan. 14 so the shipment laid in dock until then.

In the meanwhile we had a letter from Lomax asking
for ten inch, of which we had a plentiful stock. On checking
it was found that it would cost $10 to get fifty ten inch records
to him by express and we felt this would not be OK'd. His letter
was received here Saturday the 2nd, the ten inch discs started
the same day but on Monday the RR express notified us of the $10
charge so we held up shipment because the twelve inch were received
that same Monday.

It has been our experience that field trips must
be planned for in advance to avoid this type of contingency. We
turned our plant inside out to get the machine ready for him
and we greatly regret that he has been held up in his work due
to lack of discs.

Sincerely yours,
Lincoln Thompson
President
