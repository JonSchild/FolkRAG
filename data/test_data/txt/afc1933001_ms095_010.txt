of the past decade as it has but in reflecting so great an improvement
in its condition besides.  Given any kind of a break, it will give a 
good account of itself and at the present time I would rather have it
at the price than a lot of other things I know of.  I have been holding
my own stock but that doesn't prove much.

You can reach me in care of the University Club, Washington,
D. C., and I would love to hear from you again and possibly to get in
touch some time with Alan.

Congratulation on your new book, which seems so fitting a 
companion of the predecessors which I often look over with such pleasure.

I was through Dallas hastily a little over a year ago and
wish I could have seen you.  Little would give me more pleasure than
to get down that way again and I hope some time soon you may be up
here.

With warm regards.

Sincerely yours,
Frank
