Bears - I asked him why he hated bears
He looked me straight in the eye & said
"You know [when] he was born
my father killed a she
bear & brought the little
cub & it was cute & my
mother liked it. She
suckled me on one side
& the little bear on the
other. The little bear
got more milk than I
did & I've hated the
damn things ever since.
