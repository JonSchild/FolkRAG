It all started in Ashville, around Ashville.
My old friend, [NAME]
Lunsford, who was the folklorist who organised
the festival, and he had the idea of having a
square dance contest, and there never had been
such a thing before. So the folks got busy
and they polished their dances and they got
their routines down, and they came each one
of 'em, with an absolutely whizzer of a show
to give their neighbours. And it made a huge
hit. And ah - so square dance ah contests
began to be very popular all over the place, 
and one of the things that one of the teams
did, um, taught by a gentleman named Sam
McQueen, was to bring clogging into the square
dance. Now clogging had always been separate.
That is the individual person getting up on his
feet and cutting fancy capers. This is an old,
old thing in ah north western Europe. The
solo male dancer - usually males. Ah, and
Sam McQueen had the idea that everybody should
ah clog, or what they call - or do what they 
call buck dancing, cutting the pigeon wing,
knocking the back step, all - doing all sorts
of fancy footwork while they were dancing.
