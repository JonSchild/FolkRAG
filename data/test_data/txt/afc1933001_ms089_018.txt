Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

    It occurs to me that in my brusque-
ness the other morning I might have left you with some
feeling of hurt in your heart at my manner. I hope this
is not the case. I gave you my offhand reaction to the
invitation which you were kind enough to make and now that
I have thought the matter over, I feel that I acted as
I would have acted upon reflection.

    It seems to me that our government ought
now to center every man-hour of effort and every dime of
money upon the prosecution of the war. I have here in the
office a pound-and-a-half of printed matter which the
treasury department sent to Mrs. William Bacon by first
class mail. She tells me that, as she understands, she
is one of two million American women on this mailing list
and she is outraged at this waste of money and I find my-
self entirely in agreement with her.

    I feel that the Library of Congress ought
to reduce its operation to a minimum, release as many of its
staff for military and naval service as possible and save every possible
penny.
