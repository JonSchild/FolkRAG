BLUES - 10
KID:  . .bottom with willows, thick.
SID:  New ground, they call it.
KID:  Yeah.  Un-hunh.  Willows was thick.  I-I've stalled four mules to a wagon,
you understan'?  Four mules, y'know, out in the bottom cleanin' up. .We had to
clean it up in the winter, so we could work it that summer, you understan'?
NACHEZ:  What do you mean "stall" four mules, Kid?
KID:  Well, I mean you load the wagon so heavy, naturally just that mud --- the
mules couldn' pull it. . .You see we cuttin' them willows, you un'erstan' it?
They grows thick, you un'erstan'?. . .You see, 'fter-'fter, you see 'fter we-er
cut 'em down, cut-trim the limbs off an' then we have to bu'n the bresh, an'
then the part that was any good (you un'erstan'?), we'd saw it up in stove
wood, you un'erstan'?  Do that in the wintertime an' then we have to ditch
that bottom, that (you un'erstan?) - that place wha' we'd cleaned it up,
had to ditch, let that water run off an' then it'd do to work that place.
SID:  Well, Kid, you was talkin' about down in those swamps an' bottoms an' places
