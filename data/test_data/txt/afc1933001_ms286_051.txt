18. The Farmer's Curst Wife.  Sung by Horton Barker, Chilihowie, Virginia, 1939.
Recorded by Herbert Halpert. 

One of the best known of all the British ballads found in the United 
States, this tale of a scolding wife evidences its popularity by the number of 
melodies and the number of nonsense refrains it has acquired  in its long travels
across the centuries.   [It has been to every corner of the country, and] It 
still delights any audience [that hears it] with its broadly comic version of the 
Orpheus legend.  I was told by a mountain singer that husbands have actually used it to [quiet] silence their shrewish wives [on occasion]; the superstitious women believed
that what happened to one woman might well happen to another.  The story is 
always the same.  The devil appears to a farmer in his field; the farmer gives
[his] him scolding wife [to the devil]; the devil carries her off to hell where she [at once]
proceeds to murder as many of Satan's imps as come within her reach; [until]
at last Satan, realizing that the old woman is "about the clean out Hell,"  carries her back to her husband, proving the old folk-adage that "nothing
is meaner than a mean woman".
