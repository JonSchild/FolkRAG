Reel of 10/4/61, Side 1, Song 3 [*37*]

WIRE GAL

The "Pigeon Wing" was just a dance my grandfather did and I never
did learn it.  It was a just a dance he did with no song to it.
The "Pigeon Wing" was something like "Wire Gal" and if anyone
knows how to "Pigeon Wing" he can do it to that. . .Boy, that was
pretty in those old long dresses; and there was some way of doing
it with their feet up and around.

Wire gal, wire,
Hold your dress, gal,

Wire a little wider,
Wire a little higher,
Wire gal, wire,
Wire gal, wire,
Wire a little higher,
Hold your dress, gal,
Wire a little wider,
Hold your dress, gal,
Wire a little higher. . .
