of happiness. I have been able to
push you off so that you have
a better chance, materially, than
my father could give to me.
It's all up to you now. If
I were [try] to try to help or
advise,  you would resent it
- perhaps rightly. When my pen 
runs away now and then and introduces
a caution I soon feel apologetic
and wish I had controlled it.
   I see my faults and shortcomings
much more clearly 
than you.  You must believe
this:  that always I have loved
you dearly and unselfishly,
that I never wished to get in your
way, that I rejoice in your successes
and sorrow with your
shortcomings.  At least I think I do.
Maybe you don't agree; in that
case you probably know best.  Father.
