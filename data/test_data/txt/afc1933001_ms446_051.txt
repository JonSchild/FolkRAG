I'LL MEET DEAR MOTHER
I have been thinking, brother,
While here on earth I stay,
That I will meet my loved ones,
In that eternal day.

And there'll be shouting, sisters,
When I shall reach that land,
And hear my loving babies
Sing with that concert band.

Their little tongues are so sweetly,
I often hear them cry,
O, why not come on, father,
To our sweet home on high.

Yes, I will meet you, children,
And mamma with me go,
And if it pleases Jesus,
The other seven too.

I hope it will please Jesus,
For all to reach that land,
And shout and sing forever,
With that holy, happy band.

I have seven children with me,
And two are gone away,
And by the help of Jesus,
I'll meet those two some day.

I'M GOING THROUGH
Lord, I've started to walk in the light,
That shines upon me from heaven so bright,
I'll bid this world and its follies adieu,
For I've started to Jesus and I'm a going thru.
