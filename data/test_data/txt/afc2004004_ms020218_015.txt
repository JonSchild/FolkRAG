[*self concept*]
[*Mama*]
[*BJ + DAUGHTER, EARLY LIFE*]

Like, me and my daughter was raised together. See? We was chilrun
together. You see. She was born when I was 'tween twelve and
thirteen. But she always have been a child, you see, Cause we get to play...
playin' dolls right on...wasn't through playin' dolls...We'd get
to playin' an' I just let her know that I'm the mama, you know. I
didn't know nothing' about training chilrun, but I been
raisin' chilrun all along, before she was born. Brought up with
chilrun, you see? An' I be the mama, see? An' kep' right on and on;
I was the mama, see? An' I seed that was right; it kep' her to be 
the chile. An' so she never have been nothin' but the chile. All
on account a that when we played together.
[*Concept
What a child is.*]
AL:    That's you own daughter?
BJ:     That's my own chile. An' we played together. An' she never
got a base in her life.
AL:     She what?
BJ:     She never have got a base. You know, the throw back, at
me, as though I was a chile, you know. Like her, see? She always
treat me as she was the child. She ain't got near as base as
these boys ever got. In the older times, you see? That's the difference...
AL:     What do you mean by base?
BJ:     I mean to speak, you know, "Oh, I didn't do so-and-so; oh,
I know I didn't put that there," of sumpin' like that, you know?
They'll say it, comin' up, you know. But she never did; never get
high in her voice, not at all, never have, that same daughter like
that, since been a chile. Just been a chile. An' me bein' a chile
with her [was] you see 's kinda different, kinda odd like, kinda like funny.
An' I remember...
AL:     Has she married?
BJ:     Married! Got chilrun. Chilrun's got chilrun.
AL:    Good gracious.
[*great grand children*]
BJ:     You know, I got great-grand-chilrun. Got six. I want you
to see 'em afore I go back. Ha, they ain't far from from here.
I want [to] let her know I'm here.
[*age when had 1st child*]
     But, you see she was born when I was between 12 and 13.
I [was] lackin' five months of bein' thirteen years old. You see,
we jus' played together as she was grown' 'cause I still was in
my playish attitude. But always loved the chilrun.
