But I'll repair to Jesus, where
     I'll ease my troubled breast;
To Christ above, who is my Lord,
     And my eternal rest.
And, O, that He would send for me,
     And call my spirit home,
To worlds of rest, among the blest,
     Where troubles never come.

No. 47

Nearer, my God, to Thee,
     Nearer to Thee,
E'en though it be a cross
     That raiseth me,
     Still all my song shall be,
Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer my God, to Thee,
     Nearer to Thee.

     Tho' like the wanderer,
          Daylight all gone,
     Darkness be over me,
          My rest a stone.
          Yet in my dreame I'll be,
     Nearer my God, to Thee,
     Nearer my God, to Thee,
          Nearer to Thee.

There let the way appear,
     Steps unto heaven,
All that Thou sendest me,
     In mercy given;
     Angels to beckon me
Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer my God, to Thee,
     Nearer to Thee.

     Then with my waking thoughts,
          Bright with Thy praise,
