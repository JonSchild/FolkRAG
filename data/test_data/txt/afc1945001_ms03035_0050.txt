RE: Rumors
[*Patrolman C*]
[*1.*] Engaged in a conversation with a group of men, who appeared
to be foreigners, it was brought to my attention that people of various
races and nationalities believe that if Russia prvents Germany from
conquering them, the war will end within one year, and people working in
defense plants will be without work of any sort causing amajor disaster
throughout the world.

[*2.*] While talking with a man who appeared to be an american and was
dressed in working clothes, stated "people are beginning to wonder why
the government is rationing foodstuffs and the necessities of everyday
life when we have been in the war only one year where last year they
paid the farmers not to raise any crops."
He said it looked to him as though our Bill of Rights was being
scrapped and our wonderful form of government was being taken away
from us.
[*3.*] Listening to a man who said he had traveled through different states
recently and who had talked with various people on the subject of the
Cost-Plus program and the answer was that it was nothing but a
production slow up.
