Dear Carleton:
It seems to me that before we put the matter into a project 
form that you should sound out the city fathers or whatever other 
sources of funds are available to take interest.  I should think that 
Mayer LaGuardia and his coherts would be much interested in this sort 
of a project now-a-days.  We have already begun in colaboration with
Dr. Mitchell and his Consort group.  Probably the Library would furnish 
equipment and discs.  Todd and Sonkin would be available as recordist.  
Seeger, Sachs, Cowell, Sidney Robertson, Hertzog might all colaborate 
as advisors, editors, etc.  I suggest that someone (Seeger, Sachs, etc.) 
be employed full time to carry out the project.  A fine out-let and study 
group in the Mitchell singers and in the folk dance group.  So let's get 
going.
If you do not want to bother with the problem let me know, and 
I will take it up from this point.
Cordially yours,
Alan Lomax
