Dear friend Alan:

I am sorry not to have been able to be with you on
Monday to learn what finds you made in Mount Vernon and Hew Harmony.
I hope that, sometime at your leisure, you will write me what you
got there, and also what else you recorded from the Bryant family. I'd
like to have this information for our records here.

Professor Thompson tells me that you did not stop in
Bloomington on your way north, so I suppose you are returning my bound
manuscript by mail. If you haven't already done so, please send it as
soon as possible, as I need it in preparing a paper which is due next
Thursday. In case you have mailed it to my Oakland City address, let
me know immediately upon receipt of this letter so that I may have it 
sent on here.

I hope that you found enough material in Indiana to
make your visit worthwhile, and that you may decide to return later for
a longer stay. My kindest regards to you both.

Sincerely yours,
Paul G. Brewster
