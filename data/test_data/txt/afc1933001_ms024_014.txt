2.

1) Transcribing, annotating and cataloguing of records made
in the past year to be filed in the Library of Congress.

2) A bibliography of commercially recorded American folk-music
for immediate use by students and collectors. We have interested
the three large American record companies in this project.
They will present to the Folk-Song Archive whatever records
we choose.

3) Completion of the series of recordings among Negro convicts,
who preserve work-songs and ballads that have fallen
out of use in the "free-world". Rerecording in penetentiaries
where, before, the recording instrument worked poorly.

4) Recording game-songs current among Negro school children.

5) Extended visits to country Negro communities to record the
magnificent Negro sermons, the unwhitewashed spiritual.

6) Recording French folk-songs in Arkansas, Louisiana, Indiana,
Maryland, Alabama and Canada.

7) Recording Mexican and Spanish folk-songs:
a) The "Pastores", traditional Christmas folk-opera.
b) Vaquero songs from along the Rio Grande.

8) An attempt to bring together in the Library all collections
of America folk-songs hitherto made, and, with the cooperation
of collectors in various sections of the country, making
records of the songs they have written down.

9) Books, already contracted for:
a) Reminiscences of an American Balladist, as a guide
to students of the ballad.
b) The Songs of Lead Belly, a folk-artist and folk-post,
[?] [?] intimately and at first hand
the processes and backgrounds of Negro folk-songs.
c) Revision of Cowboy Songs with complete annotation,
addition of music and recent discoveries in the field of cowboy
songs.
d) Story of the Chixxum Trail, a recreation of life
on the most famous of the cattle trails, with the help of Tom
Hight, Jeff Hannah and Ed Nicholas who drove herds northward
from Texas during the great years of trail-herding.
