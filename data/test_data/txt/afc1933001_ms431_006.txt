WE ARE BUILDING A STRONG UNION
(Tune: We are Climbing Jacob's Ladder - 
Negro Spiritual - Marion, N.C. Workers' Song)

We are building a strong union,
We are building a strong union,
We are building a strong union,
Workers in the mill.

Every new man makes us stronger,
Every new girl makes us stronger,
Every new kid makes us stronger,
Workers in the mill.

They have fired the men who joined us, 
They have fired the girls who joined us,
They have fired the kids who joined us,
Workers in the mill.

We won't budge until we conquer,
We will stand until we conquer,
We will fight until we conquer,
Workers in the mill.

We have toiled in dark and danger,
We have toiled in dark and danger,
We have toiled in dark and danger,
Workers in the mill.
