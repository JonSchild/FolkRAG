centers, largely engaged in the production of war goods, thus providing
the homogeneity useful in handling the small sample planned. 
Yet they are sufficiently separated geographically so as to avoid 
the possible limitations due to local idiosyncrasies of any one 
city. Furthermore, the social structures of these communities are
already somewhat known by the study director.

The Method to be Tried
If the following method proves itself in the pre-test, three interviewers 
will work for two weeks in each city. They will become 
participant observers seeking for data which will be particularly
susceptible to qualitative analysis. At the outset a "commando" 
technique will be used for the purpose of getting in touch with 
representative individuals and families. The cooperation of these 
individuals and families will then be sought to the end of using 
them as channels of information. The selection will be the same in 
both cities along some such plan as the following:

banker
lawyer
doctor
Service club president
policeman
bartender
restaurant keeper
merchant
clerk-stenographer
skilled workman
unskilled workman
minister, priest, rabbi
barber
etc., etc.

The problem of sampling for this study has been discussed with Steve 
Stock and he feels that some such method as this should be used.

These individuals and families will be taken into the study as participants. 
Different icebreaking and rapport building techniques will 
of course have to be tried out but we are assuming that this will be 
one of the lesser problems. These informants will be visited several times 
during the interviewing period and will pass on to the interviewer 
information relevant to the study. This will consist of such 
data as the following:
1. Reports of rumors.
2. What people are circulating rumors.
