together.
     Don't your friends--some of your young friends, did they ever make
fun of you for singin' Sacred Harp, or think it was kinda peculiar that
you would sing these real old, old songs?
     Well, maybe they think a little peculiar. I never did have anybody
make fun of me. They just--
     Probably scared to--
     They just a--there's more young people takin' part in it now than
there when I was, say, 14 'r 15, along in there. They just--
wasn't many young people took part then, but a lotta people now, young people.
     Why is that, do you think?              . . .
     I don't know, I can't. I haven't got no answer for you, unless it's
just a old tradition that they've kinda discovered, somethin' movin'
back in.
     How do you feel when you're out there conducting in the middle of 
a square?
     Sometimes nervous, sometime feel real good. It's accordin' to the
class you have--if you got a real good class to sing, music soundin'
good, why it's, it's a real thrill. But if, you know, if sometimes it's
a different feeling, you're kinda nervous or gunshy or somethin', I
don't know--
     Well, as far as the singin' part, why back when I was that little
boy's--Jeffrey's age--why, it was nearly all Sacred Harp. And then they
begin singin' in the seven notes and git pianos and organs, in this
community, and they went big for . . .                              and it seemed
like it's drift--comin' back the other way a little bit.
     You don't like to have the piano and organ in your singing, do you?
