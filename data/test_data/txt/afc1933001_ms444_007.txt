Mr. John A. Lomax

Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am very grateful indeed to you for wiring me as 
you did regarding the royalty terms of OUR SINGING COUNTRY. I
was sorry to have to ask you to make this concession, but I had
no other alternative.  The costs of manufacture and paper have
been increasing steadily for some time, and as you know we did not 
have very much margin in the beginning on a $5.00 price.  If you
had not made the royalty concession,  we should have had to price
the book at $6.00, which would have been very bad for sales. 

So that our records may be in order, would you be
good enough to sign and return to me a copy of this letter, which 
I am sending you in duplicate, in confirmation of our understanding
that we are to pay you a roalty of 10% to 4,000 copies, and 
then 15% on OUR SINGING COUNTRY, rather than 1% to 2,500, then 15%,
as provided in our contract with you, dated March 16, 1937, for the 
second volume of American Ballads and Folk Songs, under which contract
OUR SINGING COUNTY was accepted for publication. 

Sincerely yours, 
James Putnam
Assistant to the President.
