Times is so hard, the ladies can't buy powder to powder
their face, have to powder with flour. I was out this morning,
taking my morning stroll, met two nice-looking young ladies,
all powdered up in flour; and the sun had begin shining hot and,
begod, if they didn't have biscuits hanging under their chins.

Now my paw is a preacer, one of the biggest preachers in
the state. I remember the day behind yesterday, my paw was sitting
on the porch, reading the Bible, he says, "Son, go out in the back
yard and get the dog and gun and let's go hunting."

I said, "Paw, today's Sunday. You ought to be somewhere,
preaching."

He said, "Go on and do what I told you."

I went on out in the backyard and shouldered the dog and
whistled for the gun and we go on down in the woods. Get down there
and the dog get in behind sompin. Run the sumpin way off cross the
woods and run it up a tree. Me and paw got over there and so many
leaves up the tree, we couldn't see up there and so paw told me,
"Go up there and see what it is." I say, "Paw, [by] bein you just a
little older than I am, you go up there."

Paw climbs up the tree and gets on a rotten limb. Down come
paw and down come the limb and down come sumpin else. It[w] wasn't
no coon and it wasn't no possum, but it was a great big, grizzly
bear. Me and a paw didn't have to shift nary gear--we's already in
high. By paw having a little more speed than me, paw gets in front
of me. I told him, "Paw, let's have a prayer meetin. You's a
preacher." He says,"Son, prayer's all right in prayer meetin, but it
ain't worth a durn in bear meetin."
