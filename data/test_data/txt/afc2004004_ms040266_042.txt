Dear Alan,
A hitch has come up. Having
pretty well finished translations and
transcriptions, I went to Calum
Johnston yesterday for the Spinning
Song. He is not willing to give it. The
reason is that he himself got it from
Dr Kenneth Macleod (of Mrs. Kennedy -
Fraser collaboration). It is in Vol 1 of
"Songs of the Hebrides" just as Calum
has, words and refrain at any rate.
Calum is therefore afraid of copyright
troubles, not from Kenneth Macleod, of
course, but from Boosey and the
son and daughter of Mrs. K.F.
With another man I would have been
inclined to pooh-pooh this, but Calum
is so sensitive and so nice about
everything that one cannot
try to persuade him too strongly.
He said: why not use the Weaving
