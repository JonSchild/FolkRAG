participate in the general campaigns undertaken to minimize the
rumors current, but should not feel responsible for the activities
of the educational branch.  For some special purposes, it may be
to the advantage of the educational program to request the help 
of the reporters in certain types of campaign, but in general, 
their energies and attention should be focused upon the important
task of rumor reporting.

The morale of the individual reporter is very important.
He should understand that his work is being appreciated, but any
sort of public recognition of the contribution he is making to
the community would immediately impair his effectiveness.  For 
this reason, his work should not be publicly acknowledged until
after the project has been dissolved [or until he leaves the service].
To keep up morale it is therefore desirable for staff meetings
to be held, at which the reporters are thanked for their work
and the use made of their reports explained.

Care must be taken to prevent the community from feeling
that a Gestapo is being organized.  It should be made clear that
reporters merely monitor conversation.  There should be no rebuking,
no personal reporting, no tracking down and assigning "guilt" to
individuals.  It should not be necessary to check up on who is
spreading rumors unless there is suspicion that the individual
is purposely sabotaging the war effort.  If this is the case, the
problem is one for the appropriate law enforcement authorities
rather than a rumor control project.  There should be no need to
investigate individual rumors to discover how they might have arisen.
