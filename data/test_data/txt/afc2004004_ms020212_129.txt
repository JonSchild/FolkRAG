Dear Alan:
I thought of you so often as I was editing Bessie's
material for the Anthology.  Even though we have
several mountains ahead of us so far the project feels
more powerful all the time.  Our biggest hope is that
we can do the subject justice.
The reason I'm writing, even though you are out of town,
is in regard to Bessie Jones' material.   You have men-
tioned that we should contact your agent about the
possibility of our publishing the whole thing and maybe
being of some help in getting it issued in recorded
form.  We're certainly very much interested in that
and feel that we can be of great service to you, to
Bessie, and to the material.
When Warren called your agent, however, he was not
too clear as to your desires in the matter.  I am writ-
ing to you in the hopes that you can let him know or
let us know directly just how you want to proceed.
Incidentally, we are planning to do this with Lawrence
Gellert's valuable material -- in good part, I believe,
through your kind words of reference.  I just can't 
say what the ultimate commercial value of all of this
will be, but it certainly seems to me that to have
all this wonderful source material in once place will be
a tremendous advantage.  I believe we are set up as
no other publisher-recorder to see that these songs
get exposure they deserve.  There's no way we can
guarantee fantastic results but if sincerity and dedi-
cation to a purpose count for anything, all of us
should see good results.
Best personal regards,
Bob Bollard
