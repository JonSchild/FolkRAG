The Kid:  Got stuck and...

Sib: ....he couldn't get out. He died there. An so, er-uh, this
Captain Jack told mother that he was just crazy to git
his hands on that damn stuttering fool, Sib. Which was me.
[x] He told her, "I'm gonna do him just like he did that mule. 
Git him out on the gand and...."

Natchez:  I understand...

Sib:  An' mother had to scuffle to keep him off a me.  Ever little move
I'd make, he was watchin' me.  An' after all he done sold the mule
and she done paid him, but he gonna do me like I did the mule! 
He say, I kill the mule, you understand? 

Natchez:  An' the mule went out there, himself? You didn't carry him out 
there?

Sib: Aw, naw, I didn't carry him.  He was loose, you understand?

Natchez: You were a young man then, weren't you?

Sib:  I's around fourteen years old.

Natchez:  Fourteen years old...You see the main thing about those
things like that is the word:---we'll go back to that
word where they say, "Kill a nigger, we'll hire another'n.
Kill the mule, we'll buy another'n." All those things come
under that same word, see?

Fact of the business, back in those days a Negro didn't
mean no more to a white man that a mule...

[xxxxxxx]
Sib:  Didn't mean as much.

The Kid:  Didn't mean as much.

Natchez:  You agree to that, Sib?

Sib:  Yeah, I agree to that...
