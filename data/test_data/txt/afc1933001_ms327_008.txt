NOW AND ALWAYS your Lincoln

FOUR books on your shelves, four books which, after you
have spend memorable hours with them, feel to your 
hands like old friends, and live in your home like old friends
because they have spoken to your heart. This is Sandburg's 
Lincoln.

In the few short weeks since publication, Sandburg's Lincoln
has become known, surely and simply, as the greatest book
on Lincoln, the greatest of all American biographies, the great
work on the greatest American subject. Many, many critics
have said so, in many, many words. But you only know what
that greatness is when you read these pages. Then you live
the life of Lincoln, and see the towering symbol of American
democracy come to life as a human being.

A big work, big in size and importance, big in grandeur, but 
a simple work, easily read and long remembered. For it is
the realization of what Carl Sandburg set out to do thirty
years ago: to write the biography of Lincoln he wished he 
could have read when he was a boy. It is the book on Lincoln
for the whole family, for your children and your children's
children.

Within your library, it is a library in itself, a mine of fact
and story. Within your own home it is a reminder of America's 
living heritage, to return to time and again. Now that you
have Sandburg's Lincoln, you know more about Lincoln
than Americans have ever been privileged to know. And
you know more about America and democracy, understanding
them with your head and your heart, than you have ever
known before.
