sheeps, pigs, bullocks -- I've handled hundreds of bullocks, 
sheep, too, in my time. I got eighteen pence a week when I first 
started work. Threepence a day. Eighteen pence a week - that's 
what the wages was then.
Lomax: How could you live on 18 pence a week?
Joe: Well, there, I had to live on it....My father got eleven
shillings a weeek, [xxxxxx] horseman, and I got threepence
two shillings a week, when I'd been there a longer time. And
that's how they used to pay me..sixpence a week,.
Lomax: tell me about your father a little bit.
Joe: He was a horseman. He was a horseman all his life. Never
done nothing else. Well, he done, you know, his rounds and such 
as that, but he was on the land all his life. He never
done nothing else.
Lomax: Did he used to sing these old songs, Joe?
Joe: He was no singer. He could only sing bits of songs, you see.
He used to pick them up.
Lomax: Where di you learn these texts? At the beer house?
Joe: Yeah. Learned 'em in all parts of Kent and Devonshire. Used
to pick 'em up....(mumbles) and they learnt them off him. He
Used to go across nights, see, and we used to sing songs, one
against another, to ourselves, you see.
Lomax: They're wonderful old songs you know. What did he do?
Joe: He was a horseman, he was.
Lomax: What sort of fellow was he. Describe him.
Joe: Well, he was atallish man...
Lomax: Now he's dead?
Joe: Yes, now he's been dead for about two years.
Lomax: Do any of his people still have the songs, do you suppose?
Joe: Well, his wife has gone away. He hasn't go nobody left there.
No. His wife went away. Course, she wasn't no woman for singing. No,
no. A quiet woman.
