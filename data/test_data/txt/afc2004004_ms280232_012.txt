The Dark-Eyed Sailor - Phil Tanner. 

1) It's of a comely young lady fair 
Was walking out for to take the air, 
She met a sailor upon her way, 
So I paid attention, so I paid attention 
To hear what they did say. 

2) Said William, "Lady, why roam alone ? 
The night is coming and the day near gone." 
She said, while tears from her eyes did roll, 
"It's a dark-eyed sailor, it's a dark-eyed sailor 
That's proved my downfall. 

3) It is two long years since he left this land, 
I've took a gold ring from off my hand. 
I've broke that token; here's half with me, 
And the other's rolling (2) 
In the bottom of the sea. 

4) Said William, "Drive him all from your mind, 
Some other sailor you could find. " 
"Genteel, he was, not a wreck like you 
To advise a maiden (2) 
To slight the jacket blue."
