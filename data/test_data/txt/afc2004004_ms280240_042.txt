it swag, you see, and it was a job to get that - gear - get
that material, so, I started peddling, wi' a, wi' a case.
Sometimes I had a box too, on my back with straps on it, put
it on my back and away I'd go, peddling, and I had a good
turn at that and then I started to blacksmithing. And that
was my own town, where I belonged to. Course
they're all deaded, they died at the blacksmith and I
was about eighteen month at that - at blacksmithing. I was
learning to drive on shoes. . .shoing, drive on shoen, horse
shoen at that time. Horse shoes is the pronounciation but. . .
and the I got fed up of that - it was too hard and I said,
"Och, I'd like a lighter job." So I went away
travelling again away and a tramp again. So, I took a harvest,
a harvest, and I was about six weeks at the harvest, and I got
five pound formy six weeks - I had to work the whole six
weeks for five pound. It was harvest wages at that time.
That was away back afore the 1914 war.
(And then in the 1914 war you went in the army did you?)
Yes, and then. . . . .I was in the Gordons. And then I was in
the R.A.M.C., the Medical Corps, The Royal Army Medical Corps.
And I got transferred into the Gordons. I went in a fighting
unit. And I went to France. I got wounded in a place called
Passendale ridge, and I come back. . .
(How did you like th French women?)
Oh they were good, oh My God they were. . . . Oh I used to 
say Comme et alle vous, Mademesoille. I used to say "Comme et
alle vous," I says, "Along Promenade, five francs madamesoille."
