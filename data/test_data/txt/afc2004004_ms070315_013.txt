father. He knows ballads once
knew fiddle tunes. Exc. material
on work relationships.
  That evening tried to find a good 
church service--nothing going on
worth recording.
Aug. 10 Another morning of
game songs with the rural teachers
at the Coahoma Co. training 
school. Spent aft checking
way games are played. Exhausting
heat.
     Drove out to see 104 yr
old woman in country. She was
weak & her mind wandered.
Good texts, but her voice could 
scarcely manage the tunes. She
was magnificent in the lamp light.
All women in the house left for
church &the males (of all 
ages) fell asleep.
Heard a lot about double
jointed people today.
