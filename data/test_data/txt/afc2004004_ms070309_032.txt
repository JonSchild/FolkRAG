In those days when I was comin'
up, no pianos (all p's then wer in
the jook house), no choirs - old
mothers wd just pitch a song and 
carry it on till they'd raise 10 or 12 Dollars -
The world is weaker and wiser - [theolsin'?]
too much of the world now - the old 
religion is purer - the folks have
changed - the people in them days
didn't even cook on Sunday - now
we fish, we go to movies, play cards,
-
We have a lot of preachers that have
studied, but aren't called -
it's better to [be] study & be inspired
too! Language is what they want 
now. An old man get up and
 say something wrong, you can
hear 'em grunt all over the church.

old time religion.
