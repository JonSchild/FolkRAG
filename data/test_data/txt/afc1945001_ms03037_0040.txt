#6 - Missouri

waste materials something awful. I was told by a defense
plant worker that at one plant the foreman ordered workmen
to set fire to a pile of short lengths of lumber, much of
which could have been put to some use. That's a fine way
to waste taxpayers' money. (From a small dry goods merchant).

Liberty, Missouri, August 11 - I think the administration 
in Washington is playing politics and letting the 
war wait until after the election in November. They've just
got to preserve the social gains regardless of whether we
win this war or not. (This from the president of a Kansas
City bank who is a Democrat with a son in the service, but
who has been a consistent opponent of the social welfare 
phases of the New Deal).

Kansas City, Missouri, August 11 - People who growl
about our conduct of the war effort forget what a tremendous
job we faced in this country. They overlook the fact that
we started with almost nothing to prepare for participation
in the greatest World War of all time. If we had less grumbling
and complaining and more sacrifice and cooperation, we could 
get the job done a lot faster. (From a barber whose shop has
been in the same location 27 years and who listens to all
sides of the war comment).
