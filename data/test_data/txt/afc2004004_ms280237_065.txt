Cox: No. I don't know where he gathered it up from. I deren't 
quite sure, I believe that was. . .
Lomax: Didn't you ever hear any hard time songs, Harry, or. . .
You had hard times down there, on the farm. Looks like you'd
have made up some old songs - O yes, I know what. . .(cut)
Cox:
It's of an old man in Barton did dwell,
His nickname was Snuffers, he's known very well,
He hires abroad till he's (?) to go mad,
Don't like the poor fellows to go on the bad
Right fal the ral loo, fal the ral lay,
Fal the ral loo right loorol rol day.

About eight o'clock on the broad we did go,
Our babs an' our boats you very well know.
Old Snuffers came on an' he looked rather white,
Said he, "My young fellows, I know you, deny it,
Right fal etc

He came with his music an' began for to play
He 'thought he'd about frighten those eels all away.
So he stamped all his eels, his pike, and his bream;
We might know his own as they swam in the stream.
Right fal etc.

Old Snuffers came onto the broad one night,
We heard him long before he was in sight,
He swore we had damaged his boats an' his nets
An' he'd have us to gaol if it ran him in debt.
Right fal etc.

Now there's another verse in that. I missed one. (pause)

He had two men locked up for the night,
He thought he would put all the others to fright.
The trial came on an' he lost the day,
An' all the expenses he had for to pay.
Right fal etc.

Then off to Norwich, old Snuffers did go,
To sell his old cow, you very well know,
To sell his old cow, his duck an' his hen
And he put on his cape an' he will if he can.
Right fal etc.
