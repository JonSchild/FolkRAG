When Batson got in the jail-house
Locked up in the cell, (safe, space?)
He took a pencil right in his hand
He marked every day he laid.
Batson told Mr. Sheriff,
"Don't you know that's wrong?
You got me charged guilty unfriendly
And I know I ain't done the crime."
Refrain: 
Cryin' "O Mama,
I never harm no one."
Batson begin to cry
Tell you what he did do
You could hear old Batson crying
Just like a baby child.
The day Batson cried, 
This is the words he said,
"You're trying me for murder,
And I know I never harmed no one."
Well, the judge found him guilty,
The clerk he wrote him down,
The jurymen passed the sentence,
Poor Batson, he had to be hung.
Batson begin to wonder
Batson begin to moan,
Batson told his people
"You just have to leave your home."
"You may bring me coffee,
You may bring me tea,
You got to bring me everything I want
'Cept the black jailhouse key."
Now you may dress in red,
You may dress in black,
You may dress any color you want
But you'll never bring Batson back. 
Batson's little girl begin to wonder,
Batson's little girl begin to cry,
Batson's little child begin to ask him,
"Daddy, what they going to do with you?"
