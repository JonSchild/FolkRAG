BJ TAPE 10, p. 4

BJ:   Sumpthin' like that.  An' then, then: "An' the farmer told the 
boll weevil, th-that you sure done me wrong."  An' say,  [Now you]
"Y'eat up all my cotton, now you eat my peas an' co'n."  Sumpin' 
like that. But I know there's a whole lot about the boll weevil.
That's right, [about the bug was sumpthin'] that's "Uncle Bug" that's so nasty, um-hum,
um-hum.
AL:  Yeah, that's what I mean.
BJ:   Yeah. Tha' wa', ah, ah, boll weevil ain't the one tha's so 
nasty.  Um-hum.  But I 'member the boll weevils, 'cause we used to kill 
them.  Yeah.  Ya'd get 'em in a square.  They hatch in the sand. 
Down in the dirt, you know, when the[y] sand'd be hot there.  Overnight. 
Ya think ya got 'em, an' ya know anything, overnight they jus' --
The next mornin' the cotton is loaded with 'em.  They can hatch stuff 
[sudden] overnight, couldn't they?  Where they came from yo' home?
AL:  Yeah.
BJ:   Huh! Ha, ha, ha, ha!  That' sumpin'.  Why y'all create 'em 
down there?
AL:   They came from Mexico to start with. 
BJ:   Yeah?
AL:   An' then they came over into Texas and then they spread on. 
BJ:   Um-hum. Well, that was, that was some kind of a plage (plague), 
wasn't it?  That what it was, a plage.
AL: First time I seen the boll weevil,
Sittin' on the square,
Next time I seed him, 
Had his family there. 
BJ:   Hum, hum, hum, hum!   He sure had that thing that early! 
Next [morn] morning, he got it there! I [donno] didn' ever seen such 
a thing.
