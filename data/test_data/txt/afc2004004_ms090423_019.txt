The present facts concerning the plantation Negro in the Delta 
seem to indicate that they are ceasing to be a folk people. They have 
at their command means whereby they can participate in the things 
falling beyond the world of plantations. The men by working in the 
sawmill, compresses, on the roads; the women by working as domestics. 
But, by far more significant are such as the going to the town of 
Clarksdale on Saturday and there to dance, gamble, or participate in 
other activities; in addition, there are radios, victrolas, and juke 
boxes to pick up popular songs. Through them the world of the outside 
comes to plantation Negroes. 

Specifically the victrola, the radio, the juke box, the dance 
halls, the movies and the changes in technology make it possible for 
plantation Negroes to have a greater access to broader worlds of 
experience than ever before and this change reflects itself in their 
present day expressive life. In other words, there is a definite 
departure from the traditional folk life and the movement is definitely 
in the direction of the secular and the worldly. For one thing, the 
mechanical music box, commonly called the "Sea Bird" or "juke box" in 
this area, has almost completely displaced the old time guitar and "box 
pickers".

The Negroes on the King and Anderson plantation are acquiring 
formal schooling (the median last grades completed for family heads was 
4.4 and for wives 5.9) and with it, they are becoming self conscious
