Dear Miss Pitcher:

The song "The Rattle Sna-wa-wake" was republished out of American
Ballads and Folk Songs, and for permission to use it as well as "All the
Pretty Little Horses" I suggest you write directly to my father, John A. Lomax
at 7456 San Benito Way, Dallas, Texas.

My notion about the "American Songster" is that it be really pocket
size, that is, 6½ inches by 4½, more or less. I should contain between 150
and 200 songs with melodies and guitar chords indicated. Perhaps it might be
wise to publish a separate piano accompaniment book, as in the case of Zanzig's
opus. I should hope that a book of that type would sell for 25¢ on the newstands,
just like the pocket novels that are distrubted these days, so that
it would be available to all kinds of people. I have a notion that if we did
a book of this kind quickly enough, we might have the opportunity to bring
it into the army camps. At least I can get very good advice about how to bend
the book in that direction. We also should have a few engravings like the
old time    songsters to relieve the monotony of the print.

If you can handle all the permission letters, the editing job should
take no more than two months. My general plan is, by the way, to edit the
songs for singing, revamping the published tunes whenever necessary so that they
will be easy to sing and comparatively understandable at first glance. Most of
the material will come out of books already in print, and in the case of songs
that come out of Archive records I will give you the address of the singers.
You can pay such singers your standard fee for permission to use the songs.

I shall have to employ a full time assistant for the period, so I
shall have to have an advance. Let me know what you can do about this.

Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
