Reverend Roe. Reel 12. P. 6
A: No, what did you tell when he came back? 
R: Oh. You see, he tried to put everything on me, [said that] says I had
told so on , so on, so on, so on. I said I told [him] them about nothing.
Then I foudn out that he [had worked it] was trying to raise a racket, you know, and he did getup quite a little
stew over there, and so he would deny this thing to me but he would
tell the people all around, but he denied to me because he was a [farid] fraid
just to come out, you know, and say I did th[i]us and so, and then he was
afraid of my boy, too; my boy were here. And I just stopped the
meeting then and let him go, and I had -- it was on Friday night --
when I stopped the meeting, and he came back here Sunday, and I
preached myself. He thought, you know, that the people liked his preaching
so well until I wouldn't be able to do much good. But he came back here
that Sunday & when I got through with my sermon he say [, yessir.] "Well you's [was] a
good preacher (laughter); [he's] you's a good preacher all right. "What [are] do
you [going] want to do? He went [back] off & wrote back to his brother [mother], asked him hadn't he got
[rid] shut of me yet. But I'm still here (laughter) and he's still knocking
around [here] yet. But he's just a devil [possessed of the devil], and we've got lots of
em and lots of em is just known. You can't even take that man in
your house. You [culd] can take a [at] man in our house, and if  you had to git
up and go off after something, the next morning he'd be [??? laying there] in there after
your wife and before you got back, or daughter, or anything like that. He's 
just bad. And we got plenty of em that don't preach the Gospel. We 
got many of em that don't do nothing but get up in the pulpit and make
a pretty noise, just holler and hoot, and they got some people that 
shout over it.
