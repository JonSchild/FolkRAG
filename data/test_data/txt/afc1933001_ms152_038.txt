December 19, 1938

Attached is an invitation to Mr. Alan Lomax to attend
a concert in New York City on December 23, 1938. John
Hammond, chairman of this concert, is a recognized leader 
in the field of American popular music and also a well-known
collector of photograph records. A close contact between
Mr. Hammond and the Archive of American Folk-Songs would be
very valuable.

I recommend that Mr. Lomax be granted official leave
for three days in New York, and railway fair and per diem
allowance to be charged to "Increase".
