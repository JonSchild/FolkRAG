Mr. Fletcher Collins

Hagerstown, Maryland

Dear Fletcher:

Jo has taken leave of absence for six
months to have her baby. I am going to be
here only a few more days until I go into
the Office of War Information as a Special
Information Consultant. I shall probably
be calling on you for help and counsel when
I start my new job. In the meanwhile my
best to you and Mrs.

Why don't you come down for a visit?

Cordially yours,

AL s
