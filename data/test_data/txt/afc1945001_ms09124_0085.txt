The is a rumor in the United States and England that
there will be a trade war between these two countries after
the present war. This arises from the fact that both countries
are all out in building airplanes. After the war these airplanes
will be used for comerchal use and the pilots
that fly them will also be in the comerchal field. With
these two countries in a [powerful] trade war it might
lead to a military war.
