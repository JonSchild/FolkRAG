Dear Alan: in packing up I found
several letters which I thought 
might have a shadow of interest
for you.  Read 'em and throw 
'em away.  The Choate school 
letter to you came only today.
In your place I'd send in
my permanent address with 
a note to the St. Johns.  They were
certainly good to you.
1. You haven't sent me the name 
of the Negro at Wiergate.
2. You haven't told me about 
the wrinkles on the machine
Pretty nearly everything else,
