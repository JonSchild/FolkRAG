STENKA RAZIN
(Russia)

(Manuscript - contained in Folk Songs of
Many Peoples, Vol. I. Woman's Press)

From beyond the wooded island
To the river wide and free
Proudly sail the arrow-breasted
Ships of Cossak yoemanry.

In the first one Stenka Razin
With a princess at his side,
Drunken, holds a marriage revel
With his beautiful bride.

But behind them rose a whisper,
"He has left his sword to woo,
One short night, and Stenka Razin,
Has become a woman too."

Stenka Razin hears the jeering
Of his discontented band,
And the lovely Persian princess
He has circled with his hand.

His black brows have come together
As the waves of anger rise,
And the blood has mounted swiftly
To his piercing, jet-black eyes.

"I will give you all you wanted,
Life and heart, and head and hand,"
Echo rolls the pealing thunder
Of his voice across the land.

"Volga, Volga, mother Volga
Deep and wide beneath the sun,
You have never seen a present
From a Cossack of the Don.

And that peace might rule as always
All my free0born men and brave,
Volga, Volga, mother Volga,
Volga, make this girl a grave."

With a sudden, mighty movement
Razin lifts the beauty high,
And he casts her where the waters
Of the Volga move and sigh.

"Dance you fool, and men, make merry,
What has got into your eyes?
Let us thunder out a chanty
Of the place where beauty lies."

From beyond the wooded island
To the river, wide and free,
Proudly sail the arrow-breasted
Ships of Cossack yeomanry.
