In dealing with the problem we focus on what America is culturally --
a composite of peoples and heritages.  Sociologists no longer accept
the theory of the melting pot or an all-leveling Americanism. What has
taken place since colonial times is a two-way process: immigrants
adjusting themselves to American life and American communities absorbing
immigrant traits.  The process is one which in a given case may not
be completed for generations.  National unity must thus reckon with a
host of loyalties and antagonisms, active or passive, which at any time
may be translated into block acceptances or resistances. In counteracting
propaganda which makes for splinter-group action we can no longer 
rely on spontaneous reactions.  We can, however, still rely on democratic
traditions and common aims, provided we embark upon a program which
attempts to activize those traditions and aims by directed efforts.  It
may be noted that hitherto we have had no federal agency seriously
occupied with our nationality and immigrant groups, but have left this
large aspect of American life to local agencies, public or private.

II. PROPOSED PROGRAM

The following description has been kept brief in order to give a
bird's-eye view of the program without obscuring the main objectives.
The proposed program would ultimately involve both the utilization of
materials now available and the collection of additional material. Only
passing notice is given to the problem of new materials because organization
for making such collections would depend largely upon the program for
utilization and upon the nature of the agency under which the work is
carried out.

A. Available Resources

Since 1933 the federal and state governments, under the
auspices of the CWA, the ERA, the FERA, and the WPA, have
made statistical studies and social surveys bearing on
nationality groups.  These records are still available, in
various stages of completion.  In the WPA, social-ethnic and
folklore studies have been conducted on a nationwide scale
in cooperation with the nationality groups themselves represented
by their cultural and religious organizations, educators,
etc.  The one hundred and sixty-one social-ethnic studies undertaken
include studies of single nationality groups (local,
regional, and nationwide), cross-sectional studies of
communities, statewide and regional studies. Surveys were made
of the foreign-language press with intensive sampling of the
New York metropolitan area, New England, and several states.
The purpose was eventually to cover the foreign-language press
of the whole country.  The studies were to be essentially
