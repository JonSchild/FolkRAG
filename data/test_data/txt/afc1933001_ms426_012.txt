OUR UNION SONG

Tune-Tramp, Tramp, Tramp.
By Mrs. A. H. Calfee in Kansas Farmer Union Songs.

In our Union Hall we meet,
Planning now what we can do.
Fighting for our rights as men upon the plains;
And we'll try our very best
To win others, East or West,
And we know that we at last will surely gain.

Chorus-
Yes, yes, yes, we'll help the Union,
For we know what can be done.
And beneath the banner bright,
We'll keep fighting for the right
And we'll gain it if we're loyal everyone.

Brother, join us in the fray
And we sure will gain the day.
Though the conflict may be tedious and long.
Now we need you everyone
Then before the set of sun,
We'll rejoice and sing our song of victory.

TILL THE UNION MEETS AGAIN

Tune-Till We Meet Again.

Smile awhile till Union meets again,
Won't be long, we'll gather once again.
Then we'll face the common foe,
Like real men, we'll make things.
Plan our task what ever it may be,
Never stop 'til we see victory.
So hold your patience, friend of mine,
Till we meet again.

Bring your neighbor when the Union meets,
He'll enjoy the busness and the eats.
Bring your wife and sister, too,
Without them t'will never, never do.
Bring your smile but leave your frown outside,
Choke your blues, your pessimism hide,
Then life your head, you're never dead,
Till we meet again,
