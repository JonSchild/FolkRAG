STUDY OF RUMORS IN CHICAGO AREA - August 3 to August 8   ILLINOIS

spoken in the course of their contacts with the public.  They reported the 
following:
   "Why don't we establish a second front?" - stated by seven Italians 
and one Swede:  reported by special investigator who handles primarily 
Italian investigations.  Three of his sixty odd contacts stated "Why doesn't 
England give India her independence--is England waiting for the Japs to 
take over India rather than free her now?"  He advised that the consensus of 
statements made by the Italians with whom he talked this week is that they 
have a revengeful feeling toward Japan without a great deal of antipathy 
toward Germany and they still talk of America's stab in the back at Pearl 
Harbor.  He heard no objections to America's aiding Russia.  (In some cases, 
this individual was known as a Justice agent:  in others, he was unknown.)
   "If we don't establish a second front, Russia will fall" - reported 
by another Department of Justice special agent;  heard twelve times from 
the public at large.
   "All the talk about the second front is just another war of nerves" - 
heard eight times.
   "If several of the Nazi spies should go free, it would be a great ad 
for democracy throughout the world" and "The penalty on Max Stephan is too 
severe--the Axis will retaliate by doing this to our boys" - spoken by a 
person of presumably high intelligence.
   "It is easy to deal with individuals who may be against this country 
but how can you deal with a paper like the Chicago Tribune which does more 
harm to the war effort than all other subversive elements?" - reported by an 
agent who investigates proposed sponsors for alien enemies who may be paroled 
if any adequate sponsor may be found and who talks to middle-class business
