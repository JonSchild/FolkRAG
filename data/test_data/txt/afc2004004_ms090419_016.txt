Preacher stayed one night in the deacon's house, you
know, and this deacon had a good-looking wife and this
preacher liked her. So the deacon told the preacher, said, "Brother,
now you can lay down there until you git ready to git up.
I'm going out here to plow some."

So the preacher was laying in the bed and the deacon's wife
just kept passing back and forth through the room and every time
she'd pass the bed, the preacher, why he'd smack her in
the behind. He say, "Sister, I want to ask you something."

She say, "Well, ask me anything you want to ask me
if you wanta---"

He say, "Well, how about us?"

She say, "Well, it's all right, but those people live
right in front of us--if we shet the door, they'll know something.
Shet the back door, the old man will know something going on. How
we going to do?" 

He say, “We’ll just stand up right here side of the house.”
And that’s just what happened. Just about that time another deacon
passed and looked in the window. [???] say, “Reverend
what are you [dolin?] doing?” The reverend say, "I'm telling
the sister to come to prayer meeting early tonight."
