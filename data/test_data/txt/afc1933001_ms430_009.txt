THE HOUSE THAT JACK BULT

7.

This is the house that Jack built.
This is the dream
That grows in the house that Jack built.

These are the rats 
Despoiling the dream
That grows in the house that Jack built.

WHAT IS THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT?

America's the house that Jack built.

WHO IS JACK?

Jack is the worker
Who breaks the trail
And lays the road
Who hews the forest
And mines the ore
Who grows the grain
And weaves the cloth
That fashions the dream
That grows in the house that Jack built.

WHAT IS THE DREAM
THAT GROWS IN THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT?

To shelter the weak
And strengthen the strong,
To spread the table
And open the door,
To bring in the light
And give TOMORROW
To all who work in the house that Jack built.

WHO ARE THE RATS?
