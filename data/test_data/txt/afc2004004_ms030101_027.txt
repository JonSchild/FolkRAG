Stanza for Ole Joe Clark

I would not marry old Joe Clark,
And I'll tell you the reason why - 
He ran through our tobacco patch
And tore down all our rye.

Somebody borrowed my ole coon dog,
And I wish they would bring him back
He runs the big hogs over the fence
And the little ones through the crack.

Liza Jane

And when I go a-courtin',
I'll go on the train.
And when I go to marry,
I'll marry Liza Jane.
