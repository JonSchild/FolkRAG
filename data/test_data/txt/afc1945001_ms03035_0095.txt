Reported by five policemen patrolling
Detroit beats
Patrolman B

Rumor:  As I was patrolling my beat, a young man well dressed about 29 years
of age, 5 ft. 9 in. tall and weighing about 160 lbs., stopped me and
asked me for information regarding a street and number.  While in
conversation with this man, he expressed that the opinion people were
not accepting the war serious enough.  The press in his opinion was
not endeavoring to print the true facts about war production, and also
stating he had heard, of a large Aircraft factory which was supposed
to have airplanes on production but has not completed one that will
pass Government specification.
