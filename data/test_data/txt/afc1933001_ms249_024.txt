Dear Alan:

1. See the review enclosed. The
clipping came without comment
from Oklahoma City. If you
ever straighten out this tangle - if
any - I'd like to read your 
conclusions.

2. When I was there Mr. Spivacke
agreed to send me a
complimentary copy of the Friends of Music
Album of your folk songs. If
you are in a position to speak
to him about it, and if he recalls
and would still do so cheerfully,
I wish you would send [them] on the
album or see that somebody sees
