Dallas, Texas
Dear John Lomax:
I can see no possibility at this late date of having one of our machines in Dallas for use at the square dance festival on the 29th. It is too bad, because the material will be interesting and there will be an excellent opportunity to collet from singers when they are not performing for audiences. However, the radio stations there will certainly give some coverage to it and we can consider purchasing from them their recordings if they make any.
As for a machine in Dallas, it is our hope that as a result of this forthcoming trip and your good offices we may be able to place a machine in Dallas or some other Texas city where there may also be interest in collecting. 
I look forward to seeing you and will call on arrival. Dr. Evans said he had written you about my coming, which was very good of him as one Texas to another and obviates any need of clearing the trip through Mrs. Shipley.
With best wishes,
Sincerely yours,
Duncan Emrich
