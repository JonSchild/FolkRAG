Mr. Hugh Macphee, Mrs. Nicholson, Mr. John McLeod, Mr. John
 Mcinnes, and Mrs. McCormick.
                            -------------------------------------------------
Mr. Macphee:
          Well, some say they have it really in the cradle. They 
get it one way and another by listening to the Atlantic
rollers. Some say that it comes to them natural.
Mr. McInnes:
           Some thing that the pipe music may have something to do 
with it. John may think the dancing must have something to 
do with it. He's an expert on dancing.
Mr. Lomax: Blank.
Mr. McLeod:
           Mr. Mcphee is right. It's the music of the sea right
enough. They say that it's living so near the sea, and
listening to the music of the sea.
Mr. Lomax: Blank.
Mrs. Nicholson:
          Well, I was picking it up since I was a child from my
parents, beighbours [neighbors] and friends. 
Mrs. McCormick:
          I must say I just got it from old people, as Mrs.
Nicholson got it, listening to old people singing. 
Mr. Lomax: Blank.
Mr. Macphee: 
           I don't like the recent happenings of the island.
I just wonder how would you like, Mrs. Nicholson or Mrs. McCormick,
the world to be all males?
Mrs. N. and Mrs. McC.:
          We wouldn't like it at all!
