"HOORAY FOR AMERICA"

ROLLING ALONG, SINGING A SONG OVER THESE OCEAN WAVES,
FIRST ITS RAIN, SLEET AND SNOW AND THEN IT RAINS AGAIN,
BUT WE'RE NOT KICKING, ITS A SAILOR'S LIFE,
WE'RE UNCLE SAM'S MEN YOU SEE
WE HAVE GOOD HEALTH AND THATS OUR WEALTH
WE'RE JUST AS HAPPY AS WE CAN BE.

          *          HOORAY FOR AMERICA, HOORAY FOR AMERICA
   CHORUS   WE'LL RUN ABOUT, AND ALL WILL SHOUT
          *          HOORAY FOR AMERICA.

WE SAIL AROUND FROM PORT TO PORT TO DELIVER SUPPLIES, YOU SEE
WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO DO OUR PART TO WIN THE VICTORY,
AND WHEN IT COMES, I'M SURE IT WILL, WE'LL BE SO HAPPY YOU SEE
WE'LL RUN ABOUT, AND ALL WILL SHOUT HOORAY FOR AMERICA.

WE HAVE THE JERRIES WORRIED NOW, SO LET'S KEEP THEM ON THE RUN
WE'LL GO SO FAST THROUGH BERLIN, WE'LL SINK THE RISING SUN
THEY'RE CRYING NOW ITS PLAIN TO SEE AND THAT IS FUN FOR ME
WE'LL HAVE THE FUHRER SO DOGGONE NUTS HE'LL HIDE UP A 
SYCAMORE TREE.
