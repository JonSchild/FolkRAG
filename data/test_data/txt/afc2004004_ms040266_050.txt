Dear Mr. Lomax
I think the best date for you
would be Friday Jan: 15th 10 P.M.
at the Church House. Brid port.
Mr. S. Hoskins and Mr. D. Eveleigh
("Boom" and the "Pony" respectively)
or rather their wives, give "bed and
breakfast" at the Foundry House
Cafe, just a little way out of Brid port
on West Road. I am sure they would be
glad to put you up and you would be
in homely touch with two of the mummers
If you decide on that date I could
book the room for you with Mrs. Hoskins
They are very nice people & would I know
