1)  O we're all black bastards, but we do love our king,
Every night at the flicks you can hear us fucking sing,
                                          King Farouk, King Farouk,
O you can't fuck Farida if you don't pay Farouk.

2)  O we're just fucking wogs but we do love him so,
And we all do without just to keep him on the go,
From Saloum to Salouk from Kebir to Tobruk,
O you can't fuck Farida if you don't pay Farouk.

3)  O we're just damn niggers that a bugger brought to birth,
But when we have a bint, then we want our money's worth,
You may have a taboosh, a gamal, or gamoose,
But you can't have Farida if you ain't got farouse.

4)  If her boudoir you pass 'tween the hourse of 10 and 2,
You will see all the wops standing waiting in a queue,
The Nahaz ain't an ass, though Nahaz is a crook,
You can't fuck Farida if you ain't got Farouse.

5)  O it'snot hard to see poor Delilah's up a tree,
For she wears the horns in the Lampson family,
Old Sir Miles with his wiles in advance tries to book,
But he can't fuck Farida if he don't pay Farouk.

6)  Then sing "Zied Heil" for Egypt's king,
And unto his feet your tributes bring,
We're all black bastards but we do love our king
?

7)  O it's no use to say if you want to have it in,
Your sport King Farouk he would only fucking grin,
You may beg on your knees, he would just say, "Masish,
O you won't get Farida if you ain't got backsheesh."

8)  O this song that you've heard is the song the Gippos' sing,
They'd sing just the same if they'd Rommel for a king,
"Queezkateer, Rommel dear, (2)
O we've glad you've won the battle and we're so glad you here."

Aunty Mary had a canary,
Whistle the cock of the North,
He whistled for hours and frightened the Boers
They all fell into the Forth.
B for Boer, K for Krueger,
J for Generla French,
O the British were up at the top of the hill
And the Boers were down in the trench,
