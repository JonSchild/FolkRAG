this is a function of the Library
of Congress, nor do I think 
that its officers should sit 
by, supine and inactive,
and allow its own records 
to be twisted by changes and 
omissions to give evidence 
to support any cause. â€”
In the case of Professor Ernest
Brown that is precisely what 
you have done. 
Sincerely yours, 
JohnA. Lomax
