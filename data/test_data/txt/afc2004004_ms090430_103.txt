ficient dragline and truck outfit we are now operating. In 1935 the Levee Board worked 170 mules, at present we have 24, or one team for each station.
     Under the provisions of the Flood Control Act of May 15, 1928, all the cost of levee construction was assumed by the U.S. Government, but the Levee Board under the terms of that act is required to furnish all levee rights-of-way and do all necessary house moving and drainage and to properly maintain the levees after they have been enlarged or reconstructed. Thus the Levee Board has not been relieved from the burden of maintenance but the amount of work involved has due to the increased size of the levee been enormously increased.
     Some idea of the increase , since 1897, in the size of the levees may be gained from the comparison of gage heights at Memphis of the 1897 and 1937 flood crests.  This crevasse occurred at Flower Cape almost due west of Clayton and had a peak discharge of 73,000. C.F.S. The date - [???] crevasse - was about [???] 1897 and overflowed about  In 1897 our levee crevassed (the last crevasse of our main line levee) at a stage of 37 feet on the Memphis gage, and practically our entire line was over-topped and held by sandbags.
     In 1937 with a stage at Memphis of 50.4 we had a comfortable free-board along the entire line.
     Our levee now for the entire district average 32 feet in height, which requires for the ordinary or "B" section a base width of 210 feet.
     Our highest levees of any considerable length are from 40 to 45 feet in height and some bayou crossings are considerably higher.
     A Forty feet levee requires a base practically 400 feet in width.
     In addition to the base width required for the normal levee section the foundation width has been increased by berm construction practically 200 feet along one-half the length of the levee, making the base width, where such additions have been made, generally more than 500 feet.
