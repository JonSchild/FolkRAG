War In Suburbs.

Where are:
The lad who labored with my flowers,
The nurse who brightened Tommy's hours,
The cook (most excellent of girls)
The man who always did my curls
Effectively?

Awaiting orders for overseas,
In a factory wearing a coverall,
At Fort Dix eager for his call,
Respectively.

I can "piggy-back" Tommy, too.
For cooking I have quite a flair
And maybe I shall do my hair
Eventually.

Yes, I'm
Chauffeur, gardner, baby's nurse,
Housewife, guardian of the purse,
