Reverend Roe.  Rell 12. P. 6
A:  No, what did you tell when he came back?
R:  Oh.  You see, he tried to put everything on me, said I had
told so on, so on, so on, so on.  I said I told him about nothing.
Then I foudn out that he had worked it and he did getup quite a little
stew over there, and so he wouldn deny this thing to me but he would
tell the people all around, but he denied to me because he was a farid
just to come out, you know, and say I did this and so, and then he was
afraid of my boy, too; my boy were here.  And I just stopped the
meeting then and let him go, and I had -- it was on Friday night --
when I stopped the meeting, and he came back here Sunday, and I
preached myself.  He thought, you know, that people liked his preaching
so well untilI wouldn't be able to do much good.  But he come back here
that Sunday when I got through with my sermon, yessir.  But he was a 
good preacher(laughter); he's a good preacher all right.  What are
you going to do?  He webt back to his mother, asked him hadn't he got
rid of me yet.  But I'm still here (laughter) and he's still knocking
around here.  But he's possessed of the devil, and we've got lots of
em and lots of em is just known.  Yo can't even take that man in 
your house.  You culd take at man in our house, and if you had to git
up and go off after something, the next morning he'd be laying after
your wife before you got back, or daughter, or anything like that.  He's
just bad.  And we got pletnty of em that don't preach the Gospel.  We
got many of em that don't do nothing but get up in the pulpit and make
a pretty noise, just holler and hoot, and they got some people that 
shout over it.
