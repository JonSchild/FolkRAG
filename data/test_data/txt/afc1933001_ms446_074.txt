59 

There I shall bathe my weary soul, 
In seas of heavenly rest, 
And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast. 

No. 59 

Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb, 
And shall I fear to own His cause 
Or blush to speak His name? 

Must I be carried to the skies, 
On flowery beds of ease, 
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas? 

Are there no foes for me to face, 
Must I not stem the flood? 
Is this vile world a friend to grace, 
To help me on to God? 

Sure I must fight if I would reign ; 
Increase my courage Lord. 
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, 
Supported by Thy word. 

Thy saints, in all this glorious war, 
Shall conquer, though they die ; 
They see the triumph from afar, 
And seize it with their eye. 

When that illustrious day shall rise, 
And all Thy armies shine, 
In robes of victory through the skies, 
The glory shall be Thine. 

O ! faint not, Christians, for thy sighs 
Are heard before His throne ; 
The race must come before the prize,
