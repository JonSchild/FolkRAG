advice from the experienced 
authors of your friends
might be of material assistance
( Dobie, Sandburg, Landrum, 
Potts, or Cobb)
Another idea we 
blandly established for you 
is for you to join the ranks of 
the columnists, over a net-work
of S.W. newspapers, at least. 
We have in mind a column
written oftener than Dobie's but
not so wordy.  Your inexhaustible
spring or interesting stories certainly should
be set down for posterity and 
for this present too serious world.
You would certainly have a wide
range of experience from which to 
select, and among others, could turn 
loose, all the storehouse of recollections
about the Univ. and its characters, 
known by no other man. 

Much love, 
John
