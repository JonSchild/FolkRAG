Dear Alan:

   In considering omissions from
the book, I suggest that you think over

1.  Cutting out entirely the two
chapters of Bahaman and French songs
Certainly the Bahamans might come
out for geographical reasons alone
Later we might issue an entire
volume of Spanish, French and
Islands tunes.

1.  Omitting one or two
entire chapters which I
recall as being very brief (already
unrepresentative).

3.  Making drastic reduction
in all introductory material.
