TAPE 81. . .JEANNIE ROBERTSON.
She is a Rum One:
1) For as I strolled out on clearn moonlight,
One clear moonlight in winter,
For 'twas there I met a pretty fair maid,
She was a rum one, fol-de-doodle-i-o-aye.
But a bonny one, fol-de-doodle-i-do.

2) For shewalked up and she walked down,
And I kept close behind her.
For I asked to her the reason why
She couldna step no wider.

3) Go away, go away, you follish young man
And stop such foolish talking,
For it does not suit young men, she said,
To pick up young women walking.

4) For I'm a doctor to my trade,
My friends thell call me raree,
If you'll tell me where your troubles lie,
I'll clean you neat and fair-o.

5) My trouble lies between my thighs
And there it is abiding,
It tickles me both night and day,
And it keeps me from my striding.

6) He laid her down upon a bank,
And he provided the plaster.
She jump-ed up to her feet
Saying "I hope you'll never end it."

7) She gave to me my winter's beef,
Besides my winter's firing,
Far better than that, she gave to me
A stable for my stallion.
Jeannie: Dinna look at my face when I'm singing that rum song.
Lomax: Sorry. What do you imagine is the background of this story?
Can you tell me? Tell me the story again. . .in plain country
language.
Jeannie: Well, it means that he just met this woman, and . . . .Well,
actually, it means that this woman he saw hadn't been too good.
She wasn't a good woman.
Lomax: You mean she had an illegitimate child?
Jeannie: No. She hadn't been good. She wasn't a good woman.
Lomax: She wanted a man?
