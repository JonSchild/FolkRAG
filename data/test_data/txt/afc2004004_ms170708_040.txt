Kennedy: I've never heard that on Country Magazine.
Cox: Ain't you?
Kennedy: Was it Francis Collinson. . .
Cox: Eh?
Kennedy: Francis Collinson had that on?
Cox: That ha' been on, yes. Oh, that go like this here. If I can
think o' it. Sometimes that may go away. (laughs)

Old England long expected                news to our fleet,
It was commanded by Lord Nelson the French for to meet;
The news it came over, through the country was spread,
That the French were defeated, but Lord Nelson was dead.

Then that come, Rule Britannia, the chorus.
Kennedy: Well, sing it, Harry. I've not heard it before.
Cox: Didn't you? (laughs) That go Rule Britannia, every time, it
should be.

Not only Lord Nelson, but thousands were slain
A-fightin' the French on the watery main,
To protect their own country of honour an' wealth,
But they French they would not yield until they yield unto death.

That's - then you get the chorus, you see, it sort o' stop you up,
don't it?
(various mumbles)
Kennedy: What's the chorus?
Cox: Rule Britannia.
Kennedy: Sing it.
Woman: We'll all join in.
Kennedy: Just an ordinary Rule Britannia?
Cox: Yeah.
