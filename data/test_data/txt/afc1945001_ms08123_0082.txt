Rhymes
They've rationed my sugar,
They'll ration my meat,
They've taken the rubber
I used for my feet.

My coffee pots empty,
My clothes have no wool,
My gas tank's rock-bottom,
Which used to be full.

My wife takes the grease
which I used for my food
and sometimes I'd swear
If it were not so rude.

Of course I'm just fooling,
of course I'm not mad,
Although its not wanted
Its really not bad.
