Seattle, Washington
August 5, 1942
Say, I heard yesterday that the Boeing Plant at Renton is a flop, and that
the Army is taking it over and have started to paint it brown. Those big patrol
boats they've been building are so damn slow, the Japs can shoot 'em down like
clay pigeons. The Navy's been on their tail every minute to get a boat with some
speed. My wife knows a girl who was trying to get a job out there, and the people
at the Union or hiring hall where she went to see about it, told her the plant
was a failure.
