I wish you would thank Messrs.
Seeger and Botkin for their letters
of information, which contained
little, if any, that I did not already 
know.  As for the list of
50 or more queries for each
informant they are "not only
scoolish but dicklish and not
only dicklish but "surd" - a
fine example of academic
futility, particularly the section
on "aesthetics and psychological
factors." Under ideal conditions
you could not handle more
than one singer a day. I will
follow a bare, brief outline -
no more.
