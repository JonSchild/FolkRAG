I can see only future aimless,
good-natured & fumbling piling
up of material about whose meaning
future generations can only
hazard guesses. Shall we be
antiquarians, collectors of the
rag-tag & bobtail of society
left aside by other sciences, accumulating
grab-bags into which others
can dip for amusement? Or
shall we try to be responsible
students who know where we are
going?
