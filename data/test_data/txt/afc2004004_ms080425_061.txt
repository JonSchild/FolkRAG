Tape: Sacred Harp Interviews   13

satisfying thing was a raise in salary but that's not who you are.

Hugh:    Well, I have a quota to meet and a budget to keep the 
plant under, I have about 175 people, and anytime you have 175 
people to deal with, you got problems. But these are some 
of the most wonderful people in the world that's employed here. 
They're first class citizens of their community, and they 
are real nice and very cooperative.

AL:    Do you think there's anything similar between running 
a factory smoothly and running a good Sacred Harp meeting? 
Is there something that connects those 2 activities?

Hugh:    Well, I have good supervision that I can depend on 
for taking the load when I'm not here.  And I have no trouble 
with the Sacred Harp because there's only the president and 
the Chariman of the Board that I have to answer to and they 
always give me the leeway to do a s I please. So I have very 
few headaches with my peers. . . . . I been to Switzerland and 
I carried a group to the Hold Land; Syria and Israel. I 
sang in the U.S. Pavilion in Montreal for 8 days right behind 
Ray Acup and I had breakfast every morning with him and he 
would try to play his fiddle with us behind the curtain, 
but he said he couldn't play with us because we sang in the 
crack.   I told him not to try.   I carried a group of black 
singers up to Montreal.   I've also carried a bunch of whites 
and blacks to the Smithsonian in Washington.
