Mr. John A. Lomax
c/o Republic National Bank
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

The machine came this morning and needed some minor repairs. We hope
to get Alan fixed ip for the trip in a few days.

I cannot give you any final answer about the possibility of making
duplicates for the same reason that I have been unable to answer some of
your previous questions, and that is, because the Librarian is still on
vacation. He won't return until sometime next week and I shall take
these matters up with him as soon as possible.

Alan suggests that if you should decide to come here, Mrs. Lomax
could do the actual work. He says that she made some excellent duplicates
when you were last here. If you think that you can do the work, the only
question is that of supplying the discs. Otherwise it would have to wait
until Alan returns.

If the library should supply the discs, they would naturally remain
their property. Are the songs simple enough so that they could be easily
transcribed and leave the duplicates usable? The Librarian might ask me
that question.

Regarding the possibility of having them done elsewhere at your expense -
I don't believe there would be any objection but I naturally
should have to ask the Librarian's approval.

You can see from all this that I am in no position to give you the information
you want. Mr. Roberts, the Acting-Librarian, was kind enough to
approve my recommendation for Alan's trip to Kentucky which will cost the
Library at least $800 in addition to his salary so I hesitate to make any
more recommendations for the Archive at the present moment. I realize the
importance of this matter and shall let you hear from me as soon as I've
had a chance to speak to the Librarian.

Sincerely,

HS
