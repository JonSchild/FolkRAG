Sib:   Well, I'll tell you, Natchez, here's my thought on it. I 
         think that er-uh we colored people have had so much
         trouble, we's one nation that er-uh we tried to be happy
         anyway.  You ever notice that?  Because we never had so much,
         you understand, we tries to make the best life.  We don't 
         have nothin', but we try to be jolly anyway.  We don't let
         nothin' worry us too much.
         An' then we just go them country suppers... When I used to have
         a dollar in my pocket, I thought I was a rich man an' I'd
         just go there because I didn't have to spend much anyway
         no way.  Because, I'll tell you what, I never was used to so
         much and I always had to work, you understand.
Natchez:  I understand that.
Sib:   I 'member we cleaned up a whole bottom where the willows was
think.
Natchez:  New ground, they call it. 
Sib:   Yeah.  I've stalled four mules to a wagon out in the bottom,
         cleanin' up in the winter so we could work it in the summer.
The Kid:  What do you mean--stall four mules?
Sib:   I mean load the wagon so heavy, [naturally] the mules just
        naturally couldn't pull in that mud.
Natchez: Sib, you was talkin' about down [there] in these swamps and
         bottoms where you used to have to clean up to make your
         livin' raisin' cotton or corn or whatsonever you could
         raise on that land you clent up---now [what kind of song]                
         did you have the blues down on places like that?
Sib:  Of course I did.  It just come to me now.  You remind me of it. 
                 Lawd, I could hear my name [aringin' all up and down the li]
                 My name a -ringin' all up an' down theline, 
                 Laad, I hear my [name a-ringin']
