No. 1. A dentist – Dr. Floyd W. Pillars, 808 Equitable Bldg., Des Moines, Iowa.

Dr. Pillars is an exodentist, selected because it was felt that he would
represent a cross–section, since his business is referred to him largely by other
dentists. He unquestionably has a predominance of patients among the business
people in the higher bracketed citizens. He is a progressive young man of about
35, with an unusually successful practice, member of one of the large churches
and active in it. Dr. Pillars has found nothing which he would call a rumor. In
talking with him I found reference to these two or three which he hadn't classified
as rumors:

Dr. Pillars suggested that a dentist in general practice would probably be
preferable to him, because they usually had patients with whom they were more
likely to be acquainted over a period of treatments, and because they are likely
to have more opportunity to visit with the patient and the patient is under less
nervous strain than he is for a tooth extraction. He said he would be very glad
to help again if it was desired, that if nothing else were accomplished, the
fact that it made him aware of the importance of checking for rumors was worth
a great deal to him. He did not feel it took any excessive amount of time, although
he said he spent quite a bit of additional effort asking people about their reactions
that he ever had before.
