A. C. A.

ENRICO GLICENSTEIN whose
work appears below, as well as on
the inside cover, is already known
to our readers. His statues, carved
in wood, have peculiar intensity.
His recent show at the A.C.A. was
held together with his son, Romano,
a painter of considerable 
promise. Mr. Glicenstein was born
in Poland and received many
honors in Europe before coming to
New York. He is an outstanding
member of the Sculptors Guild.
