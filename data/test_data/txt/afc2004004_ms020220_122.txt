but some won't.  Some don't care no more'n the doctors do.  An'
you jus' sufferin' in there an', an' tied up on them tables.
TL:  They tie people on the tables?
BJ:  They ought to say your tied; you're in a brace.  You cain't --
you, your hands and arms are in a brace an' your laigs are in a
brace, so what's [about it] the matter?  Ya jus' like a cow!  I don't like
that. . .I. . .Um-hum.  So I'm glad I had all my children home.  Um-hum.
TL:  You don't tie any one down, or. . .?
BJ:  No!  You don't have to.  If a person is. . ..If they obey ya,
an' don't throw their arms up, ya see?
TL:  What if they do throw their arms up?

to hold 'em -- 'cause they had to hold me, I'm tellin' ya!
every one of 'em! -- But I, but ah, but if they do, then let

let ya, let ya arm be held where, where ya won't do it.  Tha's
all.  Cause you, you hurtin' an' ain', ain' no tellin' what you
liable to do.  You liable to jump outa there.  I wanted to run.
Anything could happen, I'm tellin' ya.  An' so, an' um, tha's
when your birth's jus' about bein' over with, when it's hurtin'
like that.  Jus', it ain't long. Jus' bear a little more.  You
know, when you think you['re goin' over,] done all you can do with anything,
jus', jus' a little bit mo'll finish it, ya see?  Tha's, tha's
when you finish things; when ya done all ya can do, then do the
next to that.  You see?  An' then ya got it, ya see?  That's
with everything.  An' so tha's what, ah, um, ya do about that.
See, when. . .
