Old John had a reputation as a man who could guess
anything. Way he'd do was to [slip] creep around  and find
out how they gonna test him and then he'd hang around until
they called him and he'd come on in and tell um . So he got his
old marse really believin in him till at least he bet $500
that they could put anything they want to under a wash pot and
Jack could tell um exactly it was.

So old Marse got a bet up and then he went and put a
coon under the pot and didn't let Jack know anything about it.
They called Jack, say, "Jack I've got $500 betted on you that
you can tell us exactly what's under the this pot."

Jack start to reach down and touch the pot, say"No
no, Jack, don't touch it. I know you can just look and tell us."

So Jack stand there and scratch his head. He knowed
they didn't know and knowed they'd done caught him. So he said,
"Well, old massa, I tell you. You all done caught the old coon at 
last."

His massa bust out and holler, "I told you old Jack
could tell you, I told you he could."
