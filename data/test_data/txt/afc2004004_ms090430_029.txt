     From the cash balance comes clothing for the family, education, 
recreation and health and other expenditures. There has been accomodation 
to this situation and many families continue the routine from year to year.
     There are a few large Negro owners, notably around Mound Bayou. 
They are similar in many of their social and personal characteristics to 
the white planters. Negro tenants, on the whole, tend to feel more secure 
personally and financially with the larger white planters. However, the 
Negro tenants who have sought the security of the more race conscious community of Mound Bayou express a preference for Negro landlords because they 
have greater freedom in regulating their work and marketing their own cotton.
     The owners and experienced managers of the larger plantations of 
the area are occasionally far-sighted enough to consider the value of certain 
mass controls over health and welfare. Some of them, notably the Delta and 
Pine Land Company, have made considerable expenditures for the control of 
malaria, tuberculosis, pellagra and venereal diseases.
