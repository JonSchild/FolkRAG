Dear Mr. Lomax,
I am still in the process of submitting outlines of 
my piece on you to magazines. Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, 
and Readers Digest have been queried and said no. Perhaps the 
folk song trend will have to go a bit further before they feel 
that there is sufficient predetermined interest to justify a 
piece for a wide reading public. I think they are mistaken, of 
course. But I wanted to try them first before asking Coronet, 
the New Yorker, Harper's, etc. I am so anxious to get going on it 
that the delay is irksome, but in any case I can promise you that 
I will not waste the material.
At a party the other night I happened to be standing 
with a group which included Lead Belly (who had just 
finished singing) and Woody Guthrie who was, we thought, about to 
sing, and took notice of a strange little friction between them. 
Lead Belly introduced the hostilities by simply remarking "Woody is 
a cowboy." That's all he said, but somehow it didn't sound 
innocuous. Woody appeared to retaliate by absent-mind[ly]edly singing 
"Goodbye, Irene" in the tone a soda jerker would use while polishing 
a table. Lead Belly soon got even when it was suggested that 
he loan Woody his guitar so Woody could sing. He explained in a 
soft confidential whisper that was just about as subtle as a riveting 
machine that Woody was welcome to use his guitar, only there wouldn't 
be any use in lending it to him, since he couldn't play a 12-string 
guitar. Woody took a disgusted drag on his cigarette that was the 
next thing to spitting on the floor and began to sing "Goodbye, Irene" 
again, making it sound bitterly corny. Miss Barnacle then put in 
her needle and addressed Woody in a strangely condescending tone. 
"What song are you going to sing, Woody?" she asked politely. (Which 
of the two numbers you know, she seemed to suggest). "Nothing" 
Woody replied curtly. Someone else [w]then offered to lend Woody 
his guitar (only six strings) but he still staunchly refused to 
perform. "Well what kind of a guitar DO you play on?" someone 
else asked. "I play on a hundred and seventy five dollar guitar", 
said Woody haughtily, and away he walked, leaving me studying Lead
