An', ah, those, ah, hawg joles (HOG JOWLS), ya know?  They
had that, ya know.  That's a special meat they had for New Year's.
An' have hawg joles an' peas.  'Most everybody had hawg joles
an' black-eyed peas.  An' I didn't see no need of it.  I don't --
I don't see nothin' in it now.  But I has it, though.
TL:  What is it supposed to mean?
BJ:  It's supposed to mean that, ah, that you have plenty to
eat all the year. . .Um-hum.  An' that's what it's supposed to
say.  But we don't know whether -- I don't know whether that's
true or not.  But I has it every year, anyway, as the old custom.
And um, co'se everybody 'mos' around still do it, ya know.  Ah,
at home.  They still do it, 'most everybody.  White and colored.
An' ah, we had, um, one white man, he, ah, had peas on his
table 12 days after Christmas. Whether, ah, whether he eat 'em 
or not. I don' know; that, that was his rule. He said that was
the rule of his, ah, old days comin' up.
TL: Is that right?
BJ: Um-hum. An' he jus' -- if ya don't eat 'em -- jus' put a lil' dish
of black-eyed peas on the table. He's a much rich man, too,
brother. He sure was. But he...
TL: But he never told you why?
BJ: No, I never heard him say why. I [guess. Somebody] jus' heard him say that
that was a rule ta have ['em] it on there 12 days. [I reckon for] that represent the
12 months of the year...Um-hum. Yeah. That's 12 months of the
year of health an' richness. You know. An' hit may mean a lot, 
on there. An' success the whole year 'round, he said.
TL: Do the black-eyed peas mean anything?
BJ: Black-eyed peas mean a lot to people, they says...um-hum.
TL: What do they mean?
