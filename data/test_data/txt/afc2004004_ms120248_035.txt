The Gimo Gods.

Gimo Roche,
Gimo D'l'eau
Gimo gran chemin
Marassa Gimo

When these families are fed it is in this order:  Gimo, to open the
way, then the Rada, then the Congo and finally the Loua.
The Rada Gods , who are the strongest, eat chicken, beef, etc.; the
Congo "mange toute melange"; the Loua eats "bÃªte sans plume" (beast
without hair), that is [pig] pork.

[From] Augustin a man, who was even among Haitiens most [confiedit] confidential
in giving me information produced a [gave] slightly different version [fo]
of the general structure of Vaudou in the North than Lile.  His interest
was rather more in food than in the names of Gods.

The Gimo are to be fed on [Wednes] Tuesday with black chicken (caye),
ruffled chicken, "cabrite bai(cream-colored goat), accasan, pistache,
banane rache, figue, bon-bon, pain, and parched corn(maiz gruye).

When the gods have eaten and the celebrants, the latter wash
their hands and bury the remnants in two holes before the hounfort
door, being careful to throw in in the water from the hand-washing and
the bones of the goat unbroken.  [On top] Several stones are placed 
on top of the pile of waste, the earth patted down over these and
the Marrassa are fed for all time.
