There was an American 
centry on duty. Everything
was quiet & peaceful,
when he heard a
noise. He turned around
& there stood a man
behind him. He said
"halt who goes there" &
the man said I have
valuable information I
am an American. The
centry said recite the
second verse of the "Star
Spangled Banner". The
man said I don't know
it. So the soldier said
pass "American".
