Dear Mr. Smith:

I am still so far behind that I haven't
had time to prepare the list I promised you two
months ago. However, in January I think I'll have
some help. Remember, I do a job very similar to 
yours without equipment or technical assistance. Be
as charitable as you can. With best wishes for the
holidays, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
