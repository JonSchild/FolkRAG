Dear Chick:
As you know, Barnicle has just come back 
from Kentucky with a hundred new records. 
I should like to arrange for the deposit of 
duplicates of these records in the Library of 
Congress and Barnicle has agreed to allow the 
duplication. Would it be possible for you to 
do the actual work of dubbing if we furnished
the acetate and Mary Elizabeth Barnicle fed you the originals 
as she prepared them? If so, can you quote me 
a price for the job?
I suppose we could get this work done 
through one of the regular channels, but 
Barnicle will be constantly using the records 
in her classes and your personal contact with 
her would make the duplication more feasible. 
I should like to hear from you soon in this 
regard and also should like to have your latest 
report on pick-ups.
Sincerely yours,
AL a
