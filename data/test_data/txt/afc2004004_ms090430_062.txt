There are a few cotton mills in the county and a small portion of
the white population is engaged in the manufacturing industries, but the majority
of the population, white and Negro, depend upon agriculture and service
to agriculture for their income. In addition to cotton and tobacco,
Johnston County ranked their and fourth in the state, respectively, in the
production of corn and sweet potatoes, and these are used mainly for home
consumption. The seasons are not severe and the changes gradual. Gardens
are grown the year round. Hogs are raised for consumption by most of the
families. There are, however, not yet enough cows and chickens to satisfy
the needs of the farmers. In 1930 there were 5,077 cows and 145,627 chickens
in the County. This is less than one cow and 19 chickens to each farm. In
spite of the deficiencies [*one*] the observer is impressed that the staple food supply
of the ordinary Johnston County farmer is more plentiful than in areas
farther south. It is lacking in variety but there is always plenty of autumn
green vegetables, pork, potatoes and bread. Canning is practiced and spring
and summer vegetables and fruits are generally served on the tables the entire
year.

These simple items make for important differences in the population.
With comparatively plenty of food for consumption there are, nevertheless,
problems encountered in maintaining a high cash return from the commercial
crops. Added to the ordinary cost of production of the two money crops is
the cost of fertilizers, which the soil demands for any worthwhile yields.
The soil is of such character that heavy cash investments must be made in
commercial fertilizers to keep a high return from either cotton or tobacco.
