Fisk, 25. 4.

A Woman Shouting.

Interspersed between the Oh's and Ee's, etc. are cries of Georgia men,
Hurray, Open up your hearts, Jesus in my heart, Yuck, yuk, yuk, yuk,
He's coming here, He's coming here.  He's coming over to Lily Wolf's
house.  He's coming to see my washtie.  He's coming to see my washtie.
He's coming here on my side.  He's coming out.  (Man:  Thank God for the
blood of Jesus!)  Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja, Glory to God.  Halleluja,
Halleluja.  (Man:  Help me.  Help me.  Help me tonight, Jesus!)
