My dear Sir:

I have just learned from Dr. John A. Lomax that his
son Alan, who is a graduate of the University, may be among those
to be considered by your committee for a travelling fellowship
during the coming year.  His scholastic record at the University
will doubtless insure him adequate consideration; and I should not
venture any expression in his behalf were it not that the application
of the year which he proposes is one that I have reason to believe
will result in a contribution to our literature and record of
American folk-lore and folk-song.  I have had special opportunity
to observe the enthusiasm and competence of young Lomax, in relation
to these subjects, from his association with his father in the field
work which for several years past the two have jointly pursued, under
grants from one of the Foundations, with the purpose of developing
in the Library of Congress invaluable records for subsequent study.
The combination in young Lomax of that interest, supported by energy
and controlled by unusually mature intelligence, together with his
academic qualifications, seems to me calculated to promise from his
year in the field results of serious general importance.

I am looking forward with much hope to hear that your
committee has found it possible to place at his disposal the resource
of the fellowship.

Believe me,
Faithfully yours,
Librarian

Dr. H. T. Parlin, Chairman,
Committee on Fellowships.
