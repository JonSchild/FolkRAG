and I went from there, to just going for singing all my life.
I love Sacred Harp singing. . . . . . . ,
AL:  But you're leading classes, isn't that what you call it?
It must have been something for a boy who had to leave classes
to lead classes.
Chester:  It makes you feel wonderful. I'm proud of what I
love, and that's SH singing. I love it.
AL:  There's a special trick to directing, getting people
to come in just the right way.
Chester:  I think there is. I think there's an art to it
that the accent that you have in your body-- that has a lot
to keeping class rhythm in your singing.
AL:  How do you feel whe n youre singin out there, leading
a class singing- do you ever get real happy?
Chester:  Lot of time I do.
AL:  Ever  shouted when you led?
Chester:  No, I don't think so. Not when I been leading
a song. But I've enjoyed it. That has been our life, that's
how we were brought up.
AL:  How many singings have you been to in your life, do you
suppose?
Chester:  That's beyond my knowledge. I wouldn't know. It'd
be up in the thousands. I've gone to all day singings all
of my life.
