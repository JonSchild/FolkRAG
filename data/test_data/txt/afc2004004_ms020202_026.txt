Dear Alan:

Can you find a spare moment to lay your
hand on, and send to me (copy will be
excellent - perhaps you need original)
newspaper clippings about Mable Hillery?

I'm working on arranging for Mable to go
to England and sing through

FOLK DIRECTIONS
39 Gloucester Avenue
London N.W. 1
England

GUL 7112

It's Roy Guest's (and my) folk-performance
booking agency in Eng.

Mable suggested I write you about this.

Can you help?

If you also have photographs, they would be
most helpful. One other thing I think of is
that I statement of Alan Lomax about [M]able
- her singing would also be very good.

I thank you very much.

Yours,
Hedy
