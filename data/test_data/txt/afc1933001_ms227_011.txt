of the circulars you sent.

In figuring on your finances
you'll have to keep in mind that I
advanced Ruth $300.00 for her work:
that nothing will be due from Singing
Country until Nov. 30, 1941 and only
half year's sales then. What are
your royalties "from radio companies
that are going to begin to come in"

If you do continue
your Folk Song programs, I think
strongly that you weaken them by
cluttering them up with miscellaneous
and indifferent [sig] singers who have
no interest in the simple beauty of
the folk tunes. Judging by what [????] 
to me over the radio I still say Lead
Belly has lost all his natural and
sincere charm, your Oklahoma
man probably never had any, the
Golden Gates were tolerable after you
has trained them, though their spirituals
continued to [be] reveal all the religious
fervor I used to get from beating on a tin pan.
They gave a show-off for fluent voices, the
emotional effect nil. Even if you don't
treat me right I can still love you.
