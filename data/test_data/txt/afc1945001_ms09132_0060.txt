My impression of the war that we are 
fighting now is that we are fighting to maintain 
something that we do not have and that 
something is Democracy. However I am 
inclined to believe that there will  be
a better and different type of Democracy
when the fighting is over and things 
are again in normal condition, then
on the other there are reason to be surprised 
otherwise and the soldier upon returning 
home may be treated as they were after
World War I. No need for discussion of that,
we all know what happened.
