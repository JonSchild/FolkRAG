Men are joining the arm forces. Rich and poor men are meeting in the army and are all getting the same treatment and training, all sleep in the same rooms and eat in the same hall. They will fight side by side on the same field. Everyone is asked to do his or her share. There is a job for everyone young and old. Those of us who are not in the armed forces or working in factories can help by just keeping ourselves healthy and buying War Bonds and Stamps.
