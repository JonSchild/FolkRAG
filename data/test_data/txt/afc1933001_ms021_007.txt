Dear Professor Lomax
I should have answered your letter of September 9 some time ago, but the rush of the opening weeks of the University year with unexpected increase in enrollment that has about snowed us under, and also the necessity of my making week-end trips and writing numerous letters in an attempt to bring in the many bits of promised material from my last summer's trip have together forced such matters to await a breathing spell.

I appreciate very much the information you sent regarding the sound-recording machine you used. The price of $450 is about the same as I received from several manufactures with whom I communicated. That was more than the money I had available would cover, so I had to resort to hand-recording, which, of course, is not very satisfactory.

The possibility of having the loan of the Library of Congress recording machine at a later time is a very pleasant prospect for me. I shall not be able to go out lore hunting again until next summer when I would like to continue this work. I have located a number of "singers" about the Great Lakes region who seemingly have large stores  of old songs which should be recorded before it is too late to get them. I also have the names of a number of lumberjack singers who are said to have a considerable repertoire. I shall write you later when my plans are more definite.

Sincerely yours,
Ivan H. Walton
