   In Montana there seemed to be considerable criticism against
the War Manpower Commission and the United States Employment Service
in that no provision had been made for the shortage of agricultural
labor; that an appreciable number of acres planted to sugar beets

necessarily had to go to waste because of the shortage of agricultural 
labor; that the farmers could not secure agricultural labor because of
the high wages and that the farmers were unable to pay the high wages
because of the restricted acreage and restricted prices established
by the Agricultural Department of the Government.  This man stated
that in his opinion it would be well worthwhile to assign companies
and regiments of troops to the fields to harvest these sugar beets
since it seemed to be apparent to him that the troops were more or
less "marking time" until a second front was opened by the United
States.
