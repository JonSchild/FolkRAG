TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
My father and I published Alla en el Rancho Grande, from the Texas
Folk Lore Society Publications, in good faith, in American Ballads
and Folk Songs, under the impression that the song was a folk song.
When asked recently I said that I believed it might be a folk song.
Since that time I have not found any publication of the song earlier
than 1927.
If I do find any evidence that the song is a folk song I will make
the information public.  Until that time I shall be happy to cease
and desist from saying that 'I believe that this song might be a 
folk song.'
