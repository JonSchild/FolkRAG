[RUMOR STUDY:] U.S. Government Sources Analysis

U.S. government sources (including the Congressional Record) can be
profitably utilized in rumor study, after the analysis of rumor content, to
relate government information output to rumor. These factors may be noted
and analyzed:

[(1)] (a) sources which may give rise to rumors or help circulate already existing
rumors. [For example, official statements about rationing, both in Congress and
in the Executive Branch, furnish a reservoir of confusions, contradictions, and
misleading ideas which could provide origin, aid, and comfort for many rumors.]

[(2)] (b) sources which tend to remove a rumor or the raison d'etre of a rumor.
Factors involved here are (a) factual and policy content of official statements
and (b) the informational character of the source. The discrepancy between
the phraseology of a rumor and the phraseology of official information may
suggest corrective information.

[(3)] (c) sources acknowledging the existence of a rumorand explicitly confirming
or denying it [For example, a War Department release of July 15 reported an[d]
organized effort to strike at the morale of the American factory worker by
spreading rumors of British carelessness toward American planes, tanks, and
material[s], conducted by Axis agents abroad. Colonel Craw was quoted as saying,
"Contrary to the German talk, the British have been most cooperative,
helping us in every possible way. But the propaganda, insidiously instilled,
has had [the] a certain effect and today rumors are floating back to this country
which are definitely Axis-inspired."]

[(4)] (d) General comparisons between what is on the public mind as indicated in
the rumors and what official spokesmen are saying. This will help show the
kind of information wanted or needed. Here again it might be worthwhile to
note the discrepancies of content.

[(5)] (e) Sources which contribute to or counteract attitudes or climates of opinion
influencing rumor production and distribution.

[(6)] (f) Cases in which no sources are related 
to the rumors. (except possibly very indirectly)
