The Family Organization

The rural dwellings of Shelby County are in the pattern of the cotton
area. The majority of the houses are unpainted board cabins, dating back
in design to anti-bellum days. They give the appearance of having stood since
those days but are actually of fairly recent constructions. They have simply
been reconstructed out of old lumber. The leaking roofs, the unscreened windows
and doors, and the broken porches and steps go in the pattern. For
family economy the families have to be large;for the landlord's economy the
cabins have to be small. The typical dwelling, thus, has two or three rooms.
Old clothes, boards, and tins are frequently used to keep out the chill winds
of winter, and the rains. The walls are covered with newspapers or heavy
wrapping paper. This covering serves both as a crude decoration and as insulation.
The open fireplace serves for heating and cooking. The families
grumble quietly about their homes, or accept them passively as part of their
lot.

Having no control over the house or its repairs, and no money to
use on it in the interest of greater comfort, their hopes and their objectives
fall back on the landlord, who seldom hears their complaints, and when they
do find it simpler to ignore them.

This dreary picture of farm dwellings is relieved by the more comfortable
homes of some of the Negro owners. An example is the brick house
of one family in the Whitehaven community. They are owners who have pushed
out of the tenancy class. The house is a bungalow type dwelling of red brick,
