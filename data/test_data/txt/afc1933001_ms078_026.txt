Dear Mr. Lomax:

    Thank you very much for your wire, indicating that
Alan can appear in Dallas Monday, May 5. This letter
will confirm the arrangement for this date. We under-
stand that Alan's fee will be $100 and that he will
pay his own expenses.

    Can you send us publicity material to use in pro-
moting the concert here? If you have nothing else, we
should like at least a brief description of his program.

    And one final question: Are you arranging this pri-
vately or is Alan being booked through the Columbia
Lecture Bureau?

    All of us look forward eagerly to seeing you and
Alan in the spring.

    Cordially yours,
    Henry Noah Smith
