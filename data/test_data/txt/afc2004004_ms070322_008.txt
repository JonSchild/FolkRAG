Wednesday - 
We took today off. Robin had
been ill all night with a sore
throat & we were both weary from
the broadcasts, so after a visit
to the doctors we went to the
National Gallery.
On the way Robin, who loves
old bangles & sparkles, stepped shyly
into a dreadful antique shop presided
over by a harpy whose dirty white 
hair had been died russet, and bought 
a pair of crystal ear bobs for 30 bob.
I wanted to haggle but between
Robin's shyness & the bedizened beldame's
bellows, failed.
The national gallery is the 
worse for grime, war, & the declining
British Empire. The 1000's of pigeons
who eat in Trafalgar Square live in
