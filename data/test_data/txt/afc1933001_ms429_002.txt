CAMP SONGS
TAPS
Day is done!
Gone the sun! 
O'er the hills
Drawing nigh
Falls the night.
Fare thee well!
Sweetly rest!
God is nigh!

A SONG FOR THE LAST DAY
When you come to the end of a perfect week, 
To the close of a camp like this,
And you think of the happy hours you've spent,
And the new-found friends you'll miss;
When a feeling of joy for their fellowship
And a tug at your heart-strings blend,
As you say good-bye to the days that are past
As a good friend parts with a friend.
-- G.R. Ingram
