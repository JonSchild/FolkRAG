Palm Beach?  He rents 'em out; he got 'is own farm; an' everything!
Ya hear him say he got it by having nerve enough to go an' take it!
An' he do it.  An' so they jus' bring that in a number, in a dream.
An' he'd go play it. An so-- 'Till he got his money like he
wanted.  He'd buy a car every year.
         But now he don't have to play it, see?  Been quit playin' it
for years.  'Cause he got sumpin' or other to bring his income
without botherin' with it.  That's right.
         But now, sumpin' like that, if I was gonna do [sumpin'] anything like
that, that'd be sumpin' to do me some good an' not to do [any]nobody no

God'll cut his blessin' off.  But now, such a thing as doin' that,
all that, all that happens is out there, anything happen out in
them bushes.
