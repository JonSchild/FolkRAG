and something to eat, you see.  
Something like that?
Sometimes they just have a quarter in their pocket and when they get to where they're
going that night or the next day, they have 15 or 20 dollars in their pocket.
A: I don't get it.
E: Well, there are different ways of getting that money, sir.
They got different ways to get that; some do different things to get that money.
???? man don't do the same thinggs.
A: Not everybody's a mausician, I suppose.
E: No, they ain't looking for that.
A: Well, what kind of guys did you meet on the road?  Every kind of guy?
E: All kinds.
A: Good guys and bad?
E: Some good guys and bad; some guys will be a friend and some aren't.
A: Some guys will steal a penny off a dead man's ???.
E: That's right.  There are some white guys you meet on the road will
treat you better than your color ever will treat you.
If I meet a shite guy who's as good as my color,
I go out of my way to be nice;
If I got money, I knock em off and sad say,
"What you want to eat or drink?" see.

Titanic Toast
Time when the Titaniic went down,
Old Shine was on that Titanic.
Titania began to sing
And everybody began to think.
And Shine was down in the barroom floor
He says, "Captain, oh captain, water is getting low."
???? to???? keep the water out the barroom door.
When the ship was going down,
When the Titanic was going down,
It sank and Shine was the only one was saved,
There's one white girl, she fell out the ship
She said, "Oh Shine, oh Shine
Would you say ?? me."
Shine say, "You got a godd stuff, true,
That I know,
But there's better stuff on the other shore."
And he hit it.
