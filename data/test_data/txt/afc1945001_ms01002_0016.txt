qualified for participation in the Rumor Clinic work. The Office of Education will then designate the group as an official Rumor Clinic. This preparatory work and final designation should take place prior to April 9th.

6. The function of the Rumor Clinics will be to furnish intelligence to this Office: all rumors and attitudes current in the area of the Clinic should be observed and recorded on reportorial form sheets (which will be provided later): these form sheets will then be sent to this Office for correlation with the reports from other Clinics. This will be done every week. The complete over-all report will then be made available to the appropriate Government offices. The machinery for the collections of such intelligence by the Clinics will be described in detail in Part II of the syllabus. For the present, however, no action whatever should be taken to establish connections with the general public or the press.

7. The value of the Clinics, both to the nation and the individual colleges and universities, is clear:

(a) The government will be provided with valuable and highly contemporary intelligence, on the manner in which the enemy is exploiting the "low pressure areas" of national morale; the government will also have a clearing house where the suggestions of men in academic life on "psychological warfare" etc., will be received and promptly forwarded to the agency or office concerned. In effect, there will be a greater unity of action between Governmental and academic circles for the duration of the war.
