Dear Lieutenant Price:

I cannot begin to tell you how grateful I am for your excellent
report on the men's reaction to the folk music albums. I did not want
to frighten you when I sent you these albums but I can tell you now that
to my knowledge the series which you have just given over WXLC at Dutch
Harbor is the first of its kind ever given in this country or any of its
territories. The British Broadcasting Corporation has on several
occasions used our recordings for broadcasts but they have never been used
in this fashion in this country. You can see therefore that you really made
history with these broadcasts.

The results are not too surprising. In fact, your remark regarding
the "general distaste for an apparently unfamiliar and peculiar type of
music" is probably the best summary of our folk song situation that I have
ever heard. It is a little sad when one thinks that these are American
folk songs of which you are writing but you are absolutely correct in
stating that they are completely unfamiliar and sound peculiar to the
average young American from urban centers.

The criticisms of the acoustical quality are of course also correct.
These recordings were made in the field, some of them many years ago on 
inferior equipment, but even at the best they cannot compare with studio recordings.
For this reason they may be unsuitable for general radio consumption.
In fact, it is even possible that just the loss of quality which radio
would impart to the records would be sufficient to deprive them of their 
most attractive characteristics. It was not my intention in sending you
these records to add to your already very numerous problems. As far as I
am concerned, I am eternally grateful to you for what you have done and
if you care to, just dump these records into some Service Club where men
can play them on phonographs and then forget about them. If you are still
interested in playing around with them, however, it occurred to me that
they might be tried out in some music appreciation class where the men
could listen to them on a phonograph and follow the words as printed on the 
accompanying leaflets. If you are at all interested in such an experiment,
please let me know and I shall be glad to send you additional copies of the 
leaflets. But please do not feel the least but obligated to do any such
thing. You are a very busy man and you have done more than your share about 
this already.
