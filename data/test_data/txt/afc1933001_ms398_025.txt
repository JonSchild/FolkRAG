It is said that Billy killed twenty-one men, not counting Mexicans,
before Sheriff Pat Garret got him. The next morning I rode North 
out of Denning on a hired living stable horse. On the pommel of 
my saddle I balanced the fifty pound recording machine while tied
up in the slicker behind the cantle of the saddle was the recording
horn. No stranger looking outfit had, perhaps, ever gone over that
trail.

The Diamond A Ranch at that time still a part of the estate of 
Senator Hearst, covered a large section of that part of New Mexico.
The Southern Pacific Railway split it in halves. My business took
me to the North section. Darkness fell before my plodding steed
stood at the front gate from which a long path lead to a low, rambling
dwelling house. I shouted, "Hello." A man came to the door and
answered, "Light stranger and look at your saddle." Then I felt at 
home, even at the Hearst headquarters at New Mexico.

After supper he took me in a buggy behind two big, long-legged
fast-moving horses, several miles away where a bunch of cowboys 
camped in the open had their campfire in the gully. The roaring 
wind sent streams of sparks across the open plains as the men sat
about the fire in cowboy fashion with their backs to the blast.

Here again I met my cowboy of the night before, a genial
friendly chap, call Rod Snodgrass. Several men sang for me that
night. Finally, Rod said, "Here is a short piece which a cowboy
sang one night up in Silver City":

Oh, the cow-puncher loves the whistle of his rope,
As he races over the Plains;
And the stage-driver loves the poppin' of his whip
And the rattle of his Concord chains;
