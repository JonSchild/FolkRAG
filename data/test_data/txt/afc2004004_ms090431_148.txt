Fisk, 23.  5. 

But the borad was so many may.
Hey, hey, water boat,
Water ring.

If you do n't bring it here,
You's a son of a bitch.
Oh, Lordie.
Oh, you's a son of a bitch.

A:  Do you know more of that song?
R:  Well, no sir.  Forest Jump was a pretty bad man.  He'd a place on
Arkansas just between Brooksburgh down there and White River Bottom. 
Well, what made him so bad I couldn't see.  Had no whole skinners,
AD skinners, some sixty skinners, and me and my brother, we stopped
in there just by Mr. Font's camp.  We stopped in there to get a job.
Well, and my brother say, "Well, we'll take a look over this camp before
we start to work."  I said, "Yeah.  That would be a pretty good
idea."
So we stayed around there for a few minutes, right across skip on a 
sixty.  A man walked down there.  "Guy, can't you drive this?" 
Say, "Yessir.  I been pulling it now for four years."  "Yessir, but
you ain't pulling it right."  So he uncrossed again and told him "If 
you hang it up again,"  say, " Me and you going for the dock."  All
right.  He put um down the bottom.  He gonna straighten himself. 
Gonna put up, I say, about half top place.  He cross um up in that 
fix again.  So the boss walked down there and got him a root.  I
ain't gonna tell you how they put that nigger there. 
Blues and Description.
A:  No, I mean where were you sitting and what were you thinking about?
R:  Thinking of folks, you know, my car.  Well, I didn't left Treaty,
looked like a girl and had running in my mind and knowing it.
A:  Tell me a little of the story of it, if you don't mind.  I mean, if
it's not too personal.  I want to know the fac[t]s of how you felt and
why you felt the way you did, for this beautiful song.
