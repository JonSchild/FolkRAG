[*POKE SALAD*]

TL:   What is this?
BJ:   This is poke salad berries; it's poke salad bush.  Hit's,
hit's good for swellin', too, you know.
TL:   Swelling?
BJ:   Yeah, it's good for swellen' an' den, we take the
berries of it, after dey turn red? An' make um, you can make
diffrunt kin' of um, um, dye.  You know, to dye things wit'?
My mother used to dye clo'es with it, you know.  An' they'd also
die all the rugs to make on, on her flo'.  Baggin' sacks rugs.
TL:   Oh, yeah?
BJ:   Yeah.
TL:  This was the stuff...?
BJ:  Yeah, tha's right. That what I tol' ya about, yeah. An'
they take that an', an' ah, squeeze the juice out of it, ya
know.  Or either just take the berries itself an' squeeze it 
over -- it's just dye -- in -- into the, the thing. You can dye
anything with it.  It dyes a pretty purple, jus' like the
stalk there look now.
TL:   Oh, is the stalk red all year long?
BJ:    No, no.  Hit's just red as it git grown up, ya know.  When
it first young it, it, this'n's here's old here now; that's what
makes hit look so pretty.  But in the winter, in the winter like
this, hit's it start a-gettin' redder, ya know. 'Cause it's
gonna die down.
And' then, another thing: The peoples eats it fer, fer
energy, you know. The, the leaves of it; not the stalk. Yeah!
They go out, go out all up in Maryland an' all home huntin' poke
salad. The folks call it.
