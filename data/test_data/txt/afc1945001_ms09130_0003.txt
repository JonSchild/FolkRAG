Dear Doctor English:

Enclosed you will find the material which 
you requested. The papers are in their original 
form, and have not been corrected by the classroom 
teachers. I do hope the stories are legible 
and that the students' writing, on the whole, is 
not too shocking. These papers are the products 
of a random selection of senior students.

Cordially yours,
Doris C. Gallagher
(Mrs.) Doris C. Gallagher

[*For local reasons, 
the students were not 
asked to indicate race but
the papers were collected
in seating order & keyed 
W or N by the teacher.*] 

[*This group has a decidedly upper
middle class of Whites plus a few 
lower middles & lower class Whites & a 
big group of Negros - all classes.*]
