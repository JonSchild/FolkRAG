The ship that bore us from the land, the Speedwell was her name,
And full four months and upwards, we ploughed the risin main. 
No land or harbour could we see, believe it was no lie, 
For around us one blackwater, and above us one blue sky.

I ofttimes looked behind me, towards my native shore
That cottage of contentment, that I shall see no more.
Likewise my aged father, who tore his hoar-a hair,
Also my tendermother, whose arms once didme bear.

It was on the fourth of july, the day we made the land
At four oclock we went on shore all chained hand in hand.
And to see our fellow sufferers I fear I can't tell how,
Some chained into a harrow, and some into a plough.

So we were marched into the town without no more delay,
And there a gentleman took me, bookkeeper for to be.
I took my occupation, my master likes me well,
My joysare out of measure, I'm sure no one can tell.

He kept a female servant, Roseanna was her name. 
For fourteen year a convict from Worcestershire she came.
We ofttimes tell our long tales, when we were far from home (?)
And now we arerattling off our chains in foreign lands to roam.

Sailin' Song(?)
So come all ye ladies gay, who delights in sailors joy,
Come listen while I sing to you a song.
When Jack Tar he comes on shore,
With his gold and silver store
There's no one can get rid of it so soon.

The first thing Jack requires, is a fiddler to his hand
And likewise, the best liqour of every kind.
And a pretty girl likewise, with two dark and rolling eyes,
And Jack T is suited to his mind.

The landlady she comes in, dressed all in her Sunday best
She looks like some bride in mornin style.
She is ready to wait on him, when she find he's plenty of tin,
Chalk[k] him down tothe one behind the bar.

Now Jack ? in his rage, he threw bottles at her head
And likewise all the glasses he let fly.
And the poor girl in her fright, called the watchman of the night
Sayin take this young sailor away.

 Now Jack did understand, that a ship lay wanting hand
And to her, he went straigh down.
