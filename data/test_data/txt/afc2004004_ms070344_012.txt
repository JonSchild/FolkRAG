last night I was immediately [?]eated
inside, saw R at once attracted,
wanted to run, dreampt of a 
big drunk at a bar playfully
crushing my ribs of my weak
blind blows falling
empty in the air -

Robin [dreampt?] of Victor*
coming in the room while we were
in bed and lecturing us on the
love of dogs & horses.  Then of going
out to the movies with [?] finding
herself late to The Blue Angel
having a napkin stamped for a
ticket finding a swimming pool
inside in which boys were diving
& diving & where she felt shouldered 
aside & out of place.  Her friends
came back asked her where she'd
been while they been to the movies
& to dinner.  In the dream her
sense of time seemed different
*the boy in Paris studying theory of knowledge.
