BJ TAPE 17, p. 6

a big girl.  Big, ol', grown woman like.   You know,
An' she had one arm.   An' so, she was fat.   Had a nub, an' I
don't like nubs, ya know?   Scared of 'em, really I am.   But she
had a nub.  An', ah. . .
AL:       Why are you scared of 'em?
BJ:        I don't like to see it work!   It. . .move.   Like that girl
there by the bridge.   I jus' don't. . .ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. . .I don't
like them nubs.  You know, when somebody been -- [lo] got cut off.
Now, I may get cut off, ya see?   It's a chance a me, yet.  But I
still, I scared a other people's arms -- I won't be scared a
mine after I get used to it.
           But anyway, I, 'Lizabeth tol' me that day, said, ah, ah, 
little children pick at me an' ['vite 'em to] if I didn't fight 'em, [(?)]
she's gonna whip me.   So there I was again, between two --
you know, I was jus' between the devil an' hell an' I didn'
know what to do because I was afraid for her to hit me, you
know, whup me an' -- she may whup me down with that nub, you see?
An' I wasn' -- Heh, heh, heh!  That's all I thought about!   I
wasn't worryin' about the whuppin'; it was that nub she has, see?
An' then, I was afraid, ah, ah, not to bother [Candy (?)] Car'lyn 'cause
all them brothers an' things there, they would beat me when she
gone.  You see?  An' all that was on my min'.   I didn't know what
to do.  All that day in school, I couldn'ta had -- do nothin'.
I was just aggravated in my min', thinkin' about what she said
comin' back home.  "If that gal pick at me, watcha gonna do?"
An' I ain't gonna run.  I'm gonna walk on there with them.  'Cause
I was supposed to get ahead of them an' go on home, right quick,
time to turn out school.  You know.  We'd get ahead of 'em an
cut                 home.
