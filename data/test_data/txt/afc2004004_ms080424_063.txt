Tape: Roll 53 Stan Hick's house 3

(AL) was that they were dances for people that used the plow, who had to
know where there feet were all the time.
Stan: Yeah, you had to know where your feet was...
AL: Show us how you'd plow a row...
Stan: Well, this is about the way you plowed, you had to sort of bow over,
and you had to go that way...
AL: But you're not stepping over those boulders, and all those rocks and 
stumps down there.
Stan: Well, a lot of times you didn't have none, and when you got to them,
you had to step high you know, like this. Sometimes you just about to go
down, but a lot of times you'd have to be this way with it. Then you
could straighten' out a good patch...
AL: Come back and plow along a real rough road and show us how you do it,
plow along,...really full of rocks and everything.
Stan: ...it'd jerk you, you know, like that, when you were plowin'
AL: And what would happen if your plow would hit a big rock?
Stan: Well, if it hit a big rock, it just jumps up and flies, and you just
about went over it, and then you just straighten up and go ahead, this way..
AL: Well, trot us in to the front porch, who's this waitin' to meet us here?
Stan: Yeah, and a lot of times you'd have to back it up....hit a rock you
know, and you'd have to take it this way and back the plow up. And then
you get it up there, and there you go again....
AL: Well, who's this lady here. Stan: Well, this is my sister here, Hattie...
AL: I haven't seen an old time bonnet like that in about 1000 years!
Hattie: Well, they quit wearin' 'em anymore.
AL: Now what were they good for anyway?
Hat: To keep the sun off ya!
AL: Yeah, but they also keep the men from lookin' right into your eyes!
