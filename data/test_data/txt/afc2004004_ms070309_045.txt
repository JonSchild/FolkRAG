I was born in Richmond, Va. in 1853
and was sold into Miss, when I was
2 years old with my mother and 
father. [When] My mother died when 
I was an infant and my father
was carried off by the Yankees
in the war - my master was trying
to escape in his surry and my father
was his bodyservant -
Mother -  Joanna Broadest
Father - Henry James Broadest
Belonged to the Starkses. Mrs. C was
named for the daughter Fannie.
She has been married twice and 
wanted to go North - get higher in 
life - but she had to be obedient 
to her husband - if she had her life
to live over again she'd go North.
She doesn't [no] know anything about
reels - because the old lady who reared me
wouldn't let us out in the quarters, among the commons, she'd keep  us quiet
Until today I doesn't mix with everybody,
I'm not used to it
