Hate Rumors

Besides being the most prevalent, the most dangerous rumors
are hate-rumors. The analysis of the Office of War Information leads
to the conclusion that it is dangerous to print or repeat a hate rumor
in any form, even in order to deny it. (See page 16). The purpose of a hate rumor is
to spread hatred, to make a given group a scapegoat. The denial of 
specific hate rumors does not spike the hate which created the rumor
but tends to shift the hate to different "facts" of different rumors.
Hate rumors should never be repeated or printed by themselves--even in
order to be denied--because this tends to keep a group in the focus of
attention and encourages controversy and suspicion. The enemy wants us
to debate and suspect the activities of other groups. 
The evidence shows clearly that many "hate-rumors" originate
in the United States as symptoms of domestic social and economic problems--
especially those problems which war creates or intensifies. [Enemy 
propaganda has often picked up [blame] rumors and tried to increase 
their circulation. Enemy  sympathizers or enemy agents do try to start, but enemy shortwave radio broadcasts reach a very 
small audience in the United States and have largely been ignored by
the American public.]
