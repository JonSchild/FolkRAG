Henry O

Miss [Mrs., Madam] Mina, alas, is a good woman
Sister Henrillia, alas, don't bother to speak
Mr. Henry, alas, is a good man
Give me my crook alas, for me to go up.

Give me my crook, alas, for us [me] to go 

Mr. Henry, alas, is a good man
Mr. Boujoir, alas, is a good man
Mr. Mina, alas, don't bother to speak
Give me my crook alas, for me to go up.

Chorus:
Henry O. Henry O

Henry O. Henry O
Give me my crook, alas, for me to go up.

Notes: 
1) "Don't bother to speak" [line 2 of above translation] means: 
"there is no need to say what is so accepted 
& obvious."
2) "éla" & "élas" — both mean "alas."
3) A "crook" is a stick with one or more hooks. A 
crook may be a walking stick, or simply a long 
stick used to pick fruits, etc. which are 
somewhat distant; it may be a stick [laborer] used by labourers
