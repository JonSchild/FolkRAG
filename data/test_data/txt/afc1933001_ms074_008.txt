Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thank you for sending me the copy of the Southwest Review containing "Stopover 
at Abilene" which I read with pleasure.  It isn't quite as interesting to a 
Northerner as the "Will Hogg -- Texan" article.  I shall be looking forward with 
much interest to seeing more chapters as they are completed.  We seem to have 
plenty of material for the dummy.

I did my best to get the same kind of a postponement for the contract which 
I have got before but, unfortunately, this time it did not work.  As you know, the 
last date we set was for September 30, 1940.  We agree to postpone the date of 
delivery to April 1, 1941, but one-half of the advance paid to you on signing of 
the contract on January 23, 1935, is to be charged to general royalties and to be 
deducted from the amount which you would otherwise receive in November.  If the 
manuscript is not delivered by April 1, 1941 the other half of your advance will 
be charged to your general royalty account at that time.  I hope this penalty 
doesn't affect you too seriously, and I sincerely hope that nothing will prevent 
your completion of the manuscript this winter.

Sincerely yours,
James [Sutuam?]
Assistant to the President
