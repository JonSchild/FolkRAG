The Coleen Ruadh:
1) In the next town of high renown a traveller passed along,
He heard a maid complaining in a lone and mournful sound,
Saying, "Donnel Og, now won't you come your native isle to view
For in Skerry is your love so well, your charming colleen ruadh.

2) When I think of the day your flag was raised so high on yonder wall,
How happy were we, both you and I, when the bugle sound did call.
The happiest day that passed away till you bid me adiue,
Of me ever more and Erin's shore, and your charming Colleen ruadh.

3) I remember the day your flag was raised in Flander's blood-stained plains,
And how you fought with the old brigade when the bullet flew like hail.
How brave you fought at Limerick Bridge, the day I stood by you
The day you fought under smoke and blood for your charming colleen ruadh.

4) But now you've left me here to mourn for you and your country's cause,
The treaty made it known to me the new and foreign laws.
For men may come and go again but none will come like you,
For to guard and fight and gain our rights, for your charming colleen ruadh.

5) The traveller heard this mournful tale, it touched his inmost soul,
When he heard the voice he knew so well as he did in the days of yore;
He pushed aside the bushes there and then sprang into view,
And he clasped her in his arms, his charming colleen ruadh.

Blackwater Side:   Music
1) As I went out one morning so early as I strayed,
It being the merry month of May, the birds sang in the shade,
The trees and the mossy banks were fully decked with pride,
With the primrose and daisies down by Blackwater side.

2) And scarcely had I gone a mile when there by chance I spied
Two lovers talked as they did walk down by Blackwater side,
And as he entwined her in his arms these words to her did say,
"It's in America I'll prove true to my lovely Irish maid."
