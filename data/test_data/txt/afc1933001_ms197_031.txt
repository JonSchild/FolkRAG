New York, 17.

Dear Rae:
Could you help me locate the following Library of
Congress singers:
The King Family (Kicking Mule[s])
The singer of Fod and the recordists [*(King, Todd & Sorkin)*]
[*Jennie Jenkins*] The singer of the Mountaineer's Courtship [*E.C. Ball Rugby, Va*]
The blind ballad singer who performs The Two
Sisters.
[*Horton Barker, Chihowie*]

Heirs or singers---either will do.

Again, thank you for your cordiality and kindness to
me during my Washington visit. Best Christmas wishes to you
and your husband.
Alan
Alan Lomax

PS. Would you  mind mentioning to Harold S. that he has
forgotten about the records?
