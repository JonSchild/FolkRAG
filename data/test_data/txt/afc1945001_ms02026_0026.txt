that Washington not ask us to repeat this type of activity. In the past, we have used a very excellent process of determining what rumors were in circulation by tapping technical sources such as the University of Chicago Committee on Public Opinion and Communications which has made a thorough study of rumors, the Counter-Propaganda Committee of the Chicago Area OCD, Department of Justice Agents, men engaged in plant protection work, and other investigators who are in constantly in contact with many elements in the field. It is through such contacts as those that we can come through with a survey of what types of rumors are currently making the rounds and the extent of same. Another thing is we did not have sufficient time to properly organize this work and to get same started, we had to pretty much rush into it. To my mind, this is a phase of activity that does not produce the necessary results, and Douglas Waples and Dr. Blumer of the University of Chicago Committee on Communications and Public Opinion join with me in this reaction.
