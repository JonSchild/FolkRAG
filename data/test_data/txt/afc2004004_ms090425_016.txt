Rock Daniel
(Rev. C.H. Savage & congregation.  Mt. Aaroret Baptist Church, 
Clarksdale, Mississippi. 1941)

Now, first I'm gonna sing one of the old specials, one of the old-time
songs that my grandmother taught me to sing long time ago.  And I
would like for ev rybody to sing with uplifted voice.  We are now in 
Cornwall County in the Mt. Aaroret Baptist Church of Reverend Law.
I am quite sure Reverend Law would enjoy this number.

I'm gonna tell my Lord,
        Daniel.
