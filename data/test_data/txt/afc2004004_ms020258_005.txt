"I want you to blow it
"At my command,
"One feet on the sea
"And one feet on the land."   (CHORUS)

"That first call easy,
"Wake up my people
"That are down there sleeping."  (CHORUS)

"Then I want you to blow it
"Loud as thunder,
"Wake up them sinners
"That's rolling under."   (CHORUS)

"Wake up my preachers,
"They're down there sleeping,
"Wake up my deacons,
"They're down there weeping,
"Wake up my members,
"They're down there trembling."   (CHORUS)

"Wake up my gambler,
"He's not my member,
"Wake up that murderer,
"He never heard of me,
"Wake up that liar,
"He's bound for fire."   (CHORUS)

When I get to heaven,
Gonna set right down,
I know King Jesus
Give me my crown,
I'm goin' on further,
Shake hands with my mother,
I'm goin' on further,
Gonna talk to my brother,
Gonna talk with the Father,
