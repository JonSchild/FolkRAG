Mr. Alan Lomax,
Library of Congress,
Washington.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
I'm sorry, but I can't give you
the text of ROOT HOG OR DIE, as sung by Madame
Olga, the bearded lady. Her husband, Mr. O'Boyle,
tried to persuade her to give me the words, but
she wouldn't cooperate.
The title of the song interested
me because I vaguely remember hearing such a 
song when I was a kid in the South. While writing
the profile I looked through a number of circus
books, hoping I could find the song. I wanted to
quote a stanza or two. There is a reference to
it in "The Circus From Rome to Ringling," by Earl
Chapin May (Duffield & Green, New York, 1932).
He says it was written by Dan Rice, who called
himself the King of the Clowns, but that's all he
says about it.
Sincerely,
Joseph Mitchell
