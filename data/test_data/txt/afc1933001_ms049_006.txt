referred by his to the Music Div.)

We regret that the records in the Archive of American 
Folk-Sing are not yet available for reproduction and distribution. The collection, however, does not contain any records of interest to speech students, consisting exclusively of recorded vocal and instrumental music.

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
