   In regard to item B4 in the Recording Schedule:
   John Lomax believes that the richest folk-song area that he
has found in the past four or five years is central Alabama
in the counties surrounding Livingston. Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt,
an extremely accomplished woman and an ardent folk-song enthusiast, has made it possible for Mr. Lomax to add to the
Library perhaps its best collection of rural Negro song, including items never before recorded and tunes which will
endure forever. Mr. Lomax has urged as strongly as possible
that in his judgment further work in the neighborhood is the
most important project the library can undertake during the
year. I feel that further intensive work in the territory is
in line with sound collecting policy, that is, intensive
work in a small territory where the material can be completely understood in its social context.

   The mechanics of this project are as follows; that a
Model K machine be shipped to Mr. Lomax in Dallas to enable
him to record informants located between Dallas, Texas and
Livingston, Alabama, that he take the machine to Livingston,
recording those informants on the way, that he instruct Mrs.
Tartt in the use of the machine and launch her on her recording
work, that she carry on the work from then for two or three
months, and that we reimburse her for her expense during
that time. The estimated budget for the trip follows.
