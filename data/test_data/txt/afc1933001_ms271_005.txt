\ We Are The Engineers /

We are the Eng....i...neers We build the
brid-ges and we have no fears.... We come from
near and far - No branch of serv......ice can e......ver swerve
us With mod-est thought we say that you de...serve
us The En.....gi.....neers... from pon..ton un..its to the
cam.....ou....fleers.... With truth we say that it's a soldier's oc..cu...
pa...tion this chance to serve our nation We're the fighting En..gi....neers
