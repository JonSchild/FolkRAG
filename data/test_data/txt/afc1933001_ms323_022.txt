THE AMERICAN COMPOSER AND AMERICAN 
FOLK MUSIC
"Our folk materials belong to us as a rich heritage 
which accumulated from generations of preferences.  
They are a living testimony of those expressions which
 people loved and understood.  They embody mankind's 
conditions, enthusiasms and passions in the simplest 
comprehensive expression of people in a given time and
 place.  Yet folk material is neither rigid nor final.  It 
lives by the same processes which created it.  It is 
plastic life-stuff to be used as we are able to use it."
ROY HARRIS, American Composer.

"I never hear a typical example of the art of our 
folk-singers without being filled with wonder and 
amazement that ears like mine accustomed to the luxuriant
iridescence, the complex sophistication, the sensuous 
fascination of the music of the symphony and
 the opera can listen with utter delight to a single line 
of melody, countless times repeated without essential 
variations, unsustained by instrumental support, unadorned
 and uncolored by harmonic background, nor
 is the enjoyment marred by the slightest sense of thinness
 or deficiency; on the contrary, the musical impression 
is one of rounded completion and abounding
 richness."
JOHN POWELL, American Composer and Folklorist.
Forword, Five Virginia Folk-Songs.

THE BRITISH FOLK-SONG MOVEMENT
"Largely owing to the labours of Cecil Sharp our 
folk-tunes are now known to English people from their
 earliest youth.  These tunes have become part of the 
national basis of musical language to every child in
 England.  Cecil Sharp was never under the delusion 
that a national music could be 'made out' of folk-song;
 but he did believe the more these tunes became the
 property of the young, true composers would arise 
among them.  His prophecy came true."
R. VAUGHAN WILLIAMS.
British Composer.
