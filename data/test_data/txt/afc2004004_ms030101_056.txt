Sailor Song
2. One day as I was at my father's room
      door
I saw a jolly sailor man I never
     saw before
"How do you do to know it was a 
      sailor man
"By de walking & de talking & de
      swinging of his arms.
Sailor fell drowsy. He hung his head
      down.
He called for a candle for to see himself
      to bed.
She run & get a candle like a maid ought to
      done
"Run along sporty boy, run along."
She was young & foolish, she tough it
      was no harm.
What happened that night no one couldnt
      tell.
But she wished de winter night
Was only seven long years.
