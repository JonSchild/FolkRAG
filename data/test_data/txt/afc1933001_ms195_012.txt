Dear Alan:

This time it is Mrs. Carrie Grover.  We
are planning to include several of her songs
in an album and want to get them released as
quickly as possible.  Our last address for her
is 69 Main Street, Gorham, Maine.  It seems to
me, however, that I heard somewhere that she is
now living in New Jersey.  Do you know whether
this is so and what her address is?

Am enclosing a postcard for your convenience.
Many thanks and kindest regards,

Sincerely yours,
