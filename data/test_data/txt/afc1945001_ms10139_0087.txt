I was with a group of people one Sunday & [an] a young 
girl was telling a joke about Hitler (which I don't remember) to a older 
man.  When she finished he said, "I think and feel 
very sure that by now the man must be insane.  
All the worry & [nur] knowing that he is beginning to 
loose is driving him mad. ."
