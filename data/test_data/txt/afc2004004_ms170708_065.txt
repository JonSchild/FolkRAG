I'm a poor gypsy girl an' you are a squire.
With wealth and great beauties at your command.
And there's more honest                    in the poor and the lowly
Than all those proud ladies that walks through our land.

How'll that do you?
D. Kennedy: That's very good. That's. . .
Kennedy: That's not the one I thought you were going to sing.
Did you not ever hear on about thesquire who has his hand
read by a gypsy girl, and she tells him that he's going to 
marry her?
Cox: No, I don't think I have.
Kennedy: And they have a wedding?
Cox: No, I don't think I ever heard that.
Kennedy: You never heard that?
Cox: (pause) My - I rather like the long songs. . .
Kennedy: My father was king of the gypsies, 
My mother was queen of the. . .Jews. . .
something like that, it starts off.
Cox: (laughs) (pause)
Kennedy: What about this. . .?
Cox: They used to sing a little old bit about. . .I never did
know that. I know a lot o' little pieces. 'Bout Rosie May.
My masters gives me holidays, I wish he'd give me more,
I thank him very kindly when I push the boat from shore.
So down the river paddle I with heart so light an' gay,
I always feel so happy when I think of you, dear May.

Oh Rosie May, as lovely as the day,
Your eyes shine bright as the starts at night
When the moon has gone away.

That's a little bit.
D. Kennedy: That is a lovely little bit, that, isn't it?
Cox: Then there was an old bloke, he used to sing an old song
