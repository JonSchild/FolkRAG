ROLL #234 - INTERVIEW WITH BANK CLERK

Clerk:  I work as a teller here at Chilton Federal and sometimes
when you get to working you get to thinking, well., all the
numbers I see every day, well, I think of the songs that go with
the numbers, and I started singing when I was very young under
Mr., Uncle Bud McGraw and Mr. Hugh McGraw. Went to a lot of
singing schools and I've always enjoyed it.
AL:  How old were you when you started singing?
Clerk:  About 4 or 5, well, Mother was taking me when I was a 
small child, cause she'd been singing in it for a long time.
That's the way I started, through my mother. So then I started
going to singing schools and I learned how to read and I started
singing with the book. Before then, I had to do it from memory,
I couldn't read then.  But I been singing for a long time and
it's always been one of my favorite things and I've always loved
it, and always will and I hope my kids will too. I take them.
AL:  When did you begin to feel it first, what grade did you start
feeling the music?
ClerK:  Maybe when I was 10, 11, 12, something like that. Always
feel it in the heart, cause that where it comes from when you're 
singing. Always makes me feel good. YOu don't feel like crying,
