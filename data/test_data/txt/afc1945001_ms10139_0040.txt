1- Lets slap the Japs off the Map.
1- Lets beat the Axis, Buy War Bonds and
Stamps.
3- A little story that impressed me was;
I guess you know by now that Adolf
Hitler isn't the Fuhrer's real name, his
real name is Adolf Schechelgruher I
was conversing with a friend the other day
and he told me that if they would call Adolf
by his real name and get that Hitler part
off it his war wouldn't last much
longer
4- You know Hitler was a paper hanger
He pasted himself up with his
own paste. Now he is known as a
Wall Flower.
