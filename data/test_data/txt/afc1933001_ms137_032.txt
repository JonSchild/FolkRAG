St. Ignace, Michigan,
Sept. 12, 1938.

Dear Harold,
     I am sorry there has been all the confusion about
food for me. The trouble seems to be that the mails here in
Northern Michigan are terribly slow. It takes your letters four
days to get to me here and your special about finances didn't 
reach me until I reached Mackinac City. I'm praying that the
check really arrives tomorrow, because I've been cutting down
on my diet a little more than I can stand.
     It's too bad I'm stuck here, too, just at this moment.
There are fine singers around, but one of them just had a death
in the family and is off on a three weeks bender, another has an
awful cold, another had a serious operation not long ago and yet
others want pay and are suspicious and elusive in the way that
the French Indian mixtures so often are.
     Please add the enclosed letter from Capt. Nye to our
files on the vagaries of folk lore and heed his warning to close
his collection to the public if that has not yet been done. 
     Mr. James Green's address is simply St. James, Beaver
Island, Michigan.
     I think that the purchase of another hundred discs 
from Sound Scriptions would not be a bad move, although I don't 
know whether this trip will yield more than a a couple of hundred
records in all-unless my luck changes very much. Not that the 
country isn't fertile, but it is stubborn and the people simply
can't see why they should sing for me without pay. This is a 
question we shall have to take up at some length on my return.
The proper answer, when you are asked, flatly, -- "Well, do you
get pay for this?" Nothing I have though of so far seems to 
be quite adequate. This is the region that I want to return to
for my next summer's field trip, however. I think two months in
this upper peninsula would yield remarkable finds for American
folk-lore. I'm leaving the Indian and the mixed blood problem
until that time.
     Now would be a very good time to talk about my return
to Washington. I hate for the Library to have spent the money
to send me out here wit out some sort of return on its investment -
i.e. over two hundred records. If you think it adviseable,
I should like to postpone my return to W. until the 15th,
setting that as the nether dead-line. That will give me a 
change to explore Northern Wisconsin and Minnesota very briefly,
at least.
     My mailing address until I notify you
to the contrary will be General Delivery, Escanaba. A telegram
might catch me in Newberry, Michigan. What has happened to the
films? Time's growing very short. Salary, please, at Escanaba.

Sincerely yours,
