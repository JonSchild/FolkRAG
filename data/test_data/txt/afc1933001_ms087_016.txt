on one side than on the other enabling it to browse comfortably on the steepest mountain sides. The prock is captured by driving it downhill to a level spot, where its peculiar anatomy causes it to run around in circles until lassoed. Such beasts are preserved in the D.A.E. to show that when it comes to concocting animals, Americans are as ingenious as Nature herself.
  Collecting quotations for the D.A.E. has kept a large staff busy for 15 years. In charge of the work is Sir WIlliam Alexander Craigie, a scholarly Scotsman who was knighted for bringing to completion the monumental Oxford English Dictionary.
  Many Americans had suggested an American dictionary of the historical types, but it was the Scotch scholar who aroused sufficient enthusiasm to get the D.A.E. project launched, under the auspices of the University of Chicago, with financial aid from the Rockefeller-endowed General Education Board.
  The appointment of a foreigner to edit an American dictionary was not too well received. The Chicago Tribune greeted him with a headline which puzzled even the learned Oxonian:
    MIDWAY SIGNS
            LIMEY PROF TO
                  DOPE YANK TALK
  Sir William's colleagues explained to him that the amusement area at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 was called the Midway, and that Midway became Chicagoese for the University which grew up on the site.
  Since Sir William's return to England in 1936, Prof. James R. Hulbert has carried on, but transatlantic clippers take final proof to the learned Scotsman for review.
  Preparing such a dictionary is a Herculean labor. Scores of readers must scan tens of thousands of American books, magazines, newspapers, and official records. Professors and students and amateur researchers everywhere have aided the regular D.A.E. staff by reading rare American works.
  A Boston amateur, the late Charles W. Ernst, was highly helpful. He had a phenomenal photographic memory which enabled him to call back to mind a visual image of any page he had ever read. If you asked him about such a word as pixilated --- a word most Americans now believe as coined by a Hollywood gag-writer in 1936 to describe Gary Cooper in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town --- Ernst would be likely to reply:
  "That word has long been used among the fishermen of Marblehead, Mass., I believe. You might look on page 56 of a novel called Agnes Surriage published in 1887 --- about the middle of the next-to-last line, if my memory doesn't fail me."
  Sure enough, that's where you'll find pixilated.
  Slang words are included in the D.A.E. only if they became established before 1875. A phrase like
