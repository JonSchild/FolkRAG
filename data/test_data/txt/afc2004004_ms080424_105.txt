Roll 73  Eller Brothers  1
L. Eller:  No, I sure don't.
AL:  What do you think it was about?
L:  Well, I don't know hardly just exactly how to put it.  Unless
it must a been this boy and this girland they kinda fell out and
they'd lost her somethin' is all I know.
AL:  You learned that from your mom.
L:  Yeah.  Well it says in there, you know, about courting too slow,
"I lost my true lover by courtin' too slow" that must be it.
AL:  When did you mother sing it to you?
L:  Well, she would sing often, a lot.  She had one of those spinning
wheels, you know.  That's the one that they spin out the thread
you know, knitted their sweaters and socks.  She'd be running that
there old spinning wheel, she'd be singing them old songs like that.
And we'd be with the old fireplace, and that there is where
I learned that.
AL:  What about doin' Ellen Smith for us, will you do it in that
same tune? (?). . . .What's that song you're gonna sing us now?
L:  "Pretty Ellen Smith. . "
AL:  What's the story of it, if you know?
L:  Well, all I know exactly what the story of it might be, uh . . . .
I just wouldn't know.  (PLAYS)
