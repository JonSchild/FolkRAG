Dear Sir:
Received your letter of July 23, and I must
apologize for not contacting you sooner but I 
have been away from Tucson for some time.  The
tapes we have of the Bessie Jones Georgia Sea
Island Singers were record on location with
Ampex Recorders and Neumann Microphones and are
of a very fine quality.  The recordings were
made with the intention that either you or Prestige
Records would be interested in assembling
the material for a new album featuring your
group.  As soon as time permits, copies of some
of the selections will be forwarded to you for
your inspection.  If they meet with your approval
and you desire the masters, please let me know
so arrangemnets may be consummated as soon as 
possible.
Sincerely yours,
Phil Dering
Business Manager
