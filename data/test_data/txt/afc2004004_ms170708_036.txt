Cox: Yeah. I heard it on Sunday.
Woman: You heard it on Sunday!
Cox: Yes. An' I've heard it afore then. My father used to sing some
o' it, an' I - I er. . .
Cox: It was of three brothers in Scotland did dwell. Yeah.
Kennedy: Your father sang that, did he.
Cox: He used to sing some o' it. (pause) I have a rich merchant
ship (mumble)
Kennedy: Well, the chap who sung that on Sunday is in the programme
with you.
Cox: I hope he is. I should like to know it. I never did - I knew
some pieces of it - he never did know all of it though.
Kennedy: And what about that other song he sang, about Stormy
weather boys.
Cox: Yeah. That's all right. I - that's good.
Kennedy: You like that?
Cox: Yeah.
D. Kennedy: Had you heard it before?
Cox: No. I - No, I don't think I had. I heard talk about stormy
weather, but I didn't know the song part. Do you - just like to hear
one verse of this other one. See if you have heard it. This here
what I told you. (pause) (laughs)
Did you ever hear talk of a good luck ship,
Did you ever hear talk of the commander's name?
She's the Royal Rainbow from Bristol town,
And Captain Ramsgate was his name.

This good luck ship she was loaden deep,
Three anchors weighed all on her bow,
An' the wind bein' east-north-east, my boys,
As close to the wind as she could lay.
