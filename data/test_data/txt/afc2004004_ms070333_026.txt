Aug. 31st, 1938
Wakefield, Michigan.
Dear Sir:-

     I am writing to you to let you -
know that I was the first one to register
at the W.J.M.S. radio station at Ironwood
Michigan, for the recording of Finnish -
Folk Songs.
     I was going to sing some of the
oldest of Finnish tunes from a book,
which has been published in the year 1900
I registered two weeks in advance, but
I was not called to appear when you
was in town.
     I have only an average voice not a
trained one, but the girl at the desk at 
W.J.M.S. registered me, and said I was
to be called on to appear for the recording
in two weeks. But they failed to do so.
     I would like to know, Did you have -
success in getting the oldest of tunes into
the library?
     I belong to some Finnish lodges, and
the Finnish people in this territory would
like to now if you succeeded in getting the 
majority of the tunes? List of oldest tunes enclosed.
Yours Truly.
