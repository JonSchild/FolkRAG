Wake up, Jacob—
Day's a-breakin'
Peas in the pot
And hoecakes a-bakin'—
for the Founders' Dinner.

Birthday Shindig
of the
Texas Folk-Lore Society
Twenty-fifth Anniversary
Twentieth Annual Session

Put yer Little foot right there
Prickly pear poultice for gun-shot wounds

Evah bell yOu heah ain't uh dinnah bell
Eyes of the boss make a fat hoss

CoMe along, boys, and listen to my tale
Chickens in the bread tray eatin' up the dough

Over the Staked Plans the White Steed ranged
On A hill after daybreak Coyote predicted rain

Sam Bass was born in Indianera
Strap Buckner, now, he aXed the devil

Bowie Put out to find the old Spanish mine
Bigfoot Wallace got his name
I'm gonnA spread mah wings an' cleave de aih
Ile out of rattlesnake for Your rheumatiz

Los muertos no hablaN
Longhorn mavericked and mustanged in the chaparral

Lasca used to ride
Little Miss MousiE by her side
