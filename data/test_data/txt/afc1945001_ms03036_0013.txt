This reporter sometimes eats his lunches at a "one-armed"
restaurant which is a unit in a chain.  This particular restaurant
which does not pull any trade from womenfolk permits the holding
of open forum sessions on the part of members of a loosely formed
club but with an elected president and other officers.  Recent
speakers and participants in open discussions have, in the main,
confined themselves to subjects of local political interest.  At
tother times discussions largely center on headlines of the day's
news.  The progress of the was has been a favorite topic.  Rumors
can ensue from such discussions.

Your reporter is happy to  be of service in this manner
and he will be pleased to cooperate in any future studies that
might be scheduled.
