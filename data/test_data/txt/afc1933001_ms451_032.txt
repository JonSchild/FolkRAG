GO 'WAY EADIE*

Go 'way, Eadie, you dirty dog,
Whoa, Eadie, go 'way
Go 'way, Eadie, you dirty dog
Whoa, Eadie, go 'way.

Go 'way, Eadie, quit worryin' me
Whoa, Eadie, go 'way
Go 'way, Eadie, quit worryin' me
Whoa, Eadie, go 'way.

I told you once and I told you twice
Whoa, Eadie, go 'way
Next time I tell you gon take your life
Whoa, Eadie, go 'way.
