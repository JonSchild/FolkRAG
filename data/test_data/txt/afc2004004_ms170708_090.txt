Six highwaymen for to bear my pall,
Give them white gloves an' sweet ribbons all,
And when I'm gone they will tell the truth,
Here lays a wild and wicked youth.
Lomax: Oh, that's a beauty. That's a beauty. That's perfect.
Cox: (laughs)
Lomax: That's the best I ever heard, that one.
Cox: You have heard it?
Lomax: No. Well, I have heard it, in different ways (mumble).
There's another song about the burial of a young boy that died of
an unfortunate life. Sometimes it's about a soldier. Do you know
this. He died of - he was buried by all the ladies in the town; you
know. He was a pretty wild bucko. . .
Cox: Oh, you mean. . .Yes, let me see, you mean (mumble) Beat the big
drums, do you?
Lomax: Yeah.
Cox: Beat the big drums, play the pipes merrily.
Lomax: What didyou say, Peter?
Kennedy: Is it the Young Sailor Cut Down in his Prime?
Cox: Yeah. That's what you're talking about.
Lomax: Peter, you don't have that from Harry, do you?
Kennedy:
Cox: No, I never did. . .
Lomax: That one, I've never heard in England. You see, we have it in
America. . . 
Kennedy: Oh, I've got it.
