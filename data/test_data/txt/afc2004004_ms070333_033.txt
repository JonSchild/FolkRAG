Dear Mr. Lomax:

I had about given up hope to see you when your
letter of September 20 arrived.  Mr. Alsberg advised me
long ago that you would be in our parts this summer.  I
am hoping that it will be possible for me to be in Duluth
during your stay there.

I have referred your requests to my Duluth Supervisor,
Mr. E. A. Kellen, Room 318, St. Louis County Courthouse,
and have requested Mr. Kellen to compile for you any
and all data that seems to him pertinent to your study.
We, unfortunately, in our State, have in our files very little
of help to you.  The enclosed suggestions from Mr.
Walter Harju,of the Minneapolis Office, will, I hope, prove
of value.  In addition to them, I recommend that you get in
touch with Dick Parish, Supervisor of Workers' Education,
whose office is in our WPA District Office building, 1608
London Road (north extension of Superior Street, Hemlock
5110).  Mr. Parish is an extraordinarily enthusiastic young
man who knows his Range thoroughly and who, through contact
with workers on the Range, is, I feel, in a position to
advise you.  I am told that one of his teachers, Fred Nadus,
is a likely informant.

If you are to be in Duluth for more than a day, I
should appreciate your calling me collect--Gladstone 7925,
Minneapolis, for I have constant business in the northern
part of the State and if it is possible for me to get away
from the office, I should like very much to make it a point
to be in Duluth while you are there.

With all best wishes for the success of your venture,

Cordially yours,

[*Parker T. Van de Mark*]
