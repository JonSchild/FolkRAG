Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I can't see how Alan's method would help
us. He suggests classifying type of song by
"the culture areas and regions." Our purpose is 
not to make an anthropological classification but
to determine how much descriptive and analytical
information, through use of computer technology. 
is needed to increase the usefulness of our folk
music for bibliographic and reference researchers.
