Fisk, 7. 3. HAFFER.

And now the ships are permitted
To go whereever they please.

These days, etc.

Thousands are taken prisoners;
Hundreds of thousands killed;
Thousands are left wounded
To die on the battle field.

NATCHEZ FIRE DIASTER.
One Tuesday night in April
'Tween eleven and twelve o'clock,
A tragedy happened in Natchez
Will never be forgot.

A crowd of youngsters gathered
Filled with joy and glee,
When fire of unknown origina
Destroyed two hundred and three,

It was sad times in Natchez;
So many people died.
Dead bodies were piled up
Almost shoulder high.

The night were calm and beautiful;
The skies were bright and fair;
The crowd were being jubilant,
And knew not Death were there.

They were eating and drinking and smoking,
Dancing and having a time,
And in less that half an hour, brethren,
The people were dyin.

It was sad times, etc.

After the ball was over,
The news broadcast around,
Doctors and medicines and nurses
Rushed out from nearby towns.
All hospitals were crowded.

That's the way that went.

A: That's all that you can remember?

H: Yessir.

A: You still have the ballad of that?

H: I might have one at home.
