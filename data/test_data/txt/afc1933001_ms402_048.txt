8.

Go yonder, angel, and get them servants a golden
waistband,
An' place it on them servants' waists,
An' servants, you set down.

Set down, servants,
You set down.

If Satan is a real enemy whom the Negro is often in

conflict, Jesus is the familiar, a solace in the time of trouble.

Dey nailed his bones and rivet his feet
De hammers was heard in Jerusalem street.

The son of man he dunno where to lay his weary head.

Jesus gib de blin' deir sight,
Jesus do most anything.
Jesus is our captain,
Jesus got de hellum.

Jesus will bring you milk and honey.
Mas' Jesus is my bosom friend.
Gwine ter write to my Jesus.

Mas' Jesus gib me little broom fer to sweep my heart
clean,

O' Satan is a busy old man,
And roll rocks in my way,
But Jesus is my bosom friend,
And roll 'em out of de way.

Two milk white horses side by side,
My Jesus gwine take him an evenin' ride.

I'm gwine to shake right han's wid Jesus,
I'm gwine to shake right han's with Jesus some o'
des days.

Lord's gwine to set dis worl' on fire
Lord's gwine to set dis worl' on fire some of des days
Lord's gwine to set dis worl' on fire,
Lord's gwine to set dis worl' on fire some of these days.

I's gwine to tell my Jesus howdy
I'se gwine kneel round' de union table.
I'se gwine walk an' talk wid angels
I'se gwine ride on de whis'lin' chariot, some o' des days.
