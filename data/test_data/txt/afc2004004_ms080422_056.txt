Time Code:
Tape:  891 cont. Nimrod   5
Nimrod:  They got into it over a hog, that's what they did.
An old poor sow.  But I think they had a little bad blood
somewheres else before that happened, had to.
AL:  It was generally families that did the fighting?
Nimrod:  And they both had strong families, you know.  It
was after that, you be sitting in a restaurant, one be
sitting over there maybe, someone else walk in, and say
hello there, what 'suou r name?  My name's McCoy.  My name's
Hatfield. On your feet.  And they'd took their fists (?)
If onee said he was a mccoy and the other was a Hatfield. . .
They done that for a long time, long after the war was over
with.  It happened up a place called Stringtown, over in
that. . . .(end of tape.)
