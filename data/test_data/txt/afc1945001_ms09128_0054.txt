1. One of the latest rumors is that it is possible 
that Adolf Hitler is suffering from a nervous collapse.  
A famous psychiatrist was summoned to Germany.  
From what country or by whom I don't remember.  

2. A little boy saw the milkman drive up to his 
house in an armored truck.  After the milkman 
left the little boy asked his Mother why did 
the milkman come in an armored truck.  His 
mother answered, "to deliver a pound of butter".  

3. Two men were discussing the shortages that the 
war has brought about.  One man said to th e
other, "you won't see anymore stockings hanging on 
women's clothes lines because they can't hang out 
liquid stockings.
