Dear Paul:
Attached is a document about THE BUZZARD LOPE, which is
one of the songs on the Prestige records which you were
presumed to have copyrighted.  Would you copyright this
song and send the pertinent contract for signature immediately
to Mr. Solomon.  Enclosed is $4.00 to pay for
the copyright fee.
Early this month I telephoned you regarding a long
article on American folk music, and am still waiting
to know whether or not you have it in your files.
Supposedly it would have been sent to you after
December 27, 1961.  Would you please advise Dena
about this.
Yours,
Alan Lomax
