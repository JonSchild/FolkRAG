"COMŒDIA" Paris (The most important theatrical newspaper of Europe)
"JOAN AND BETTY RAYNER have very great qualities of imagination, interpretation and mimicry. By the most simple means they transform the slightest story into a picture drawn in sharp relief and richly colored. For their repertoire they have had recourse to the old drama of national folk-lore, and they recapture their atmosphere by very simple announcements made with good-natured friendliness -- 'Imagine if you please,' they say, 'that here is a bucket, and here a well . . .' and without more ado they begin to act. They have a talent in the use of rapid accessories -- a cap, a scarf, a cloak, a feathered hat -- accent with exactness and mischief the character being portrayed. 
Few French artistes could bring so much tact, finesse, and comic discretion to the picturesque execution of legendary songs such as 'Le petit tambour.' 'Il était uń bergère' and 'Le petit narvire.'
Their program has no intermission -- they limit themselves to rare pauses -- and it is all in their favour that the dexterity of their changes means that their audience is never wearied by waiting. 
Curiously enough, although the drama they act is so old, the method of acting which they have evolved in unspoiled and new."                                                 Yvon Novy.

Joan and Betty Rayner were born in the newest all of countries, New Zealand, but were trained in Europe for several years in the art of the Strolling Player. Their unusual training finished, they set out to collect the folk-lore from which their programs were to be made. Traveling wherever possible by 'caravan' they journeyed up and down the Old World, mingling with the country people and gathering songs and tales of by-gone days. It is out of their many happy adventures in distant lands, as well as their study of people, that their vivid portrayals are created. 
Their art has attracted keen interest wherever they have been and although they are still young, they have toured several times round the world, arousing spontaneous delight with their program.
