Mr. Marshall Bartholomew

New Haven, Conn. 

Dear Mr. Bartholomew: 
Your letter recalls to me a 
piece of recording which I have long 
wanted to do. Miss Newcomb and I 
have visited together over her manuscript 
and both mutually agreed that 
her songs should be recorded on disks 
for the Archive collection, but something 
has always come up, however, to 
prevent this. I will try to see to 
it by spring that this will no longer 
be true. 
I would greatly appreciate your 
bringing to my attention any collectors 
or collection in any part of the 
country that you think we may not be 
aware of. 
Sincerely yours, 

Alan Lomax
