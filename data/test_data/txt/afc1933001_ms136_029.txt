Beaver Island, Michigan,
August 13th, 1938.

Mr. Alan Lomax,
General Delivery,
Charlevoix, Michigan.

Dear Sir:

I am in receipt of a letter from J.D. Newsom, State
Director of Federal Writers' Project, requesting information
on Irish folk songs of Beaver Island.

I find that a number of the older residents have kept
many of these songs alive and feel that your time would be well
repaid if you come to the island. In addition to the Irish folk
songs, they seem to have an unlimited repertoire of sea chanteys
in which you might be interested.

Upon your arrival in Charlevoix, if you find it necessary
to remain overnight,  you will find the Bartlett House, operated
by Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Olson, Park Avenue, a clean, comfortable
place to stay. Tell them I sent you. The boat leaves Charlevoix
at 8:45 AM and arrives about 12:15 or 12:30. If you wish me to
make arrangements for you, phone me between 7:30 and 8:00 PM.
The call is - Antrim Iron Company, Beaver Island, one long and one 
short ring and someone is always at the phone during that half hour. 

If the captain is unable to take your car across, phone and
I will meet you at the boat and drive you wherever you choose to go
to see these people. Mrs. Helen Cole, owner of the King Strang Hotel, 
St. James, will give you directions and accommodations, 

My time will be at your disposal for as long as you find it
necessary to remain on the island and I shall be glad to help you in
every way possible.

Sincerely,
Signature
(Mrs.) Elizabeth M. Wood,
Antrim Iron Company,
Beaver Island, Mich.
