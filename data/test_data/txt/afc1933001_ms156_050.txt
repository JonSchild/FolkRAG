Mr. Archibald MacLeish
Librarian
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. MacLeish:

My attention has been called to a 
story that appeared in the Spokane Spokesman
Review yesterday, Sunday, morning, to the 
effect that the Library of Congress has 
received funds which will enable it to provide 
for the installation in your music division 
of a complete sound laboratory for duplicating 
phonographic recordings of all types.
This newspaper story states that when the 
installation is completed, the music division 
of the Library will be able to provide 
schools, libraries and individuals with
recordings of American folk music, American
poetry read and interpreted by its makers,
unpublished string quartets, and new American
music and other similar materials.  It is 
also stated that a collection of ten thousand 
songs on disks has been accumulated under the
direction of John A. Lomax, honorary curator,
to form one of the largest collections of its
kind in the world.

May I call your attention to the
fact that the School of Music and Fine Arts
of this institution is recognized as one of
the best to be found in the United States.
You are at liberty to make inquiry of such
men as Professor Peter W. Dykema of Teachers
