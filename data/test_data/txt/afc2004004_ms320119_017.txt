LOMAX  The big and important continuities
in music, as in all the arts, go person-to-person.  You
can't write music down, all of it.  You just write a little
scheme.  The rest of it has to be learned from a master, how
to play it, how to put it together.  That applies to
classical music and it also applies to folk music.  And if
we're going to keep our folk music we have to have people
who want to devote themselves to sitting at the feet of the
masters of their particular kind of song, the one that they
want to continue and keep on, learn it long and painfully,
learn it with joy, learn it with the belief that this music
and how it's played, exactly how it's played, is the real
way to play music, their choice.  That's what their teachers
decided and that's what the young people have to decide.
And there are a lot of young people here in the Cajun
country now who have been following that precept.  Who, who
have been sitting at the feet of the great old time Cajun
musicians and learning just how to do it.  And we have, I
want to hear Mike Doucet who is the leader of per, perhaps
the most popular and best known and, and one of the most
beautiful of all the, of all the young people's orchestras
here, the, his band is going to, goes to Paris, goes to New
York, plays all over.
