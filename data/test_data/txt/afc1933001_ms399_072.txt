Shoot the Buffalo--(cont'd)

Rise you up, my dearets dear,
Present to me your hand,
I'll lead you in procession
To a far and distant land.

And we'll promenade, you know,
And we'll promenade, you know,
And we'll all meet together
And shoot the buffalo.

The girls will sit and spin,
They boys will sit and grin,
Rally round the barnyard
And chase the old gray mule.

The girls will sew and patch,
The boys will fight and scratch,
And we'll all meet together
In the sweet potato patch.

Oh, the buffalo is dead
For I shot him in the head
And we'll rally round the canebrake
And shoot the buffalo.

Oh, the hawk shot the buzzard,
And the buzzard shot the crow,
And we'll rally round the canebrake
And shoot the buffalo.

But Bob's favorite was "Jingle at the Window," the chorus
of which he would shout with a reckless abandon entirely out
of keeping with the somewhat childish words.

One after the other, each boy would skip to the other
girls at the four corners of the square, then back to his
partner whom he would grab and swing at the fourth line:

Skip one window, tidy-o
Skip two windows, tidy-p
Skip three windows, tidy-o,
Come jingle at the windows low.
