Reverend Roe. Reel 1 p. 3
tend the farm, whilst the chi dren, you know, went to school
helped me somewhat because when they get back, why, I'd read
you know. Well, I studied that way, but the white folks were [very?]
careful about that; they didn't want us to learn to much, [becau???]
said an educated man wouldn't make a good slave, ad that's true.
Well, after we get o ur farm -- paid for it-- well, then, we worked
until we got things pretty well fixed. We had a molasses mill and
 then we had a cotton gin and we ginned the cotton. We had what they
call a grist mill and we grind the corn on our farm, and my father
lived well as long as all the children, you know, stayed at home; he
lived pretty well then, and-- but, we all had to work -- no time to
go to school. In fact, there wasn't no schools anywhere around in
Louisiana for colored.
Where was that exactly? Near what town was that?
It was in Webster Parish. Millin was the ounty seat.
Yes, sir, and now I worked on the farm, with my fathe r until I was
twenty-one. When I was seventeen years old, up until I was seventeen
rather, the fello ws around drank lots of whiskey, nd they gave me
whiskey to drink, and they carried me out when I was seventeen years
old and made me drunk, and I cut up something awful that day I went
across to Mrs. Lee -- she owned a store up there, you know, a gin, a
great bog cotton gin, and she was well-to-do. And by me being a smart
boy and worked for her a deal, she thought of me as much as she did
her own son, and Mrs. Lee would always speak up for me you know.
Probably I would have been maybe killed, had it not been for she.
How was that, you might have been killed?
