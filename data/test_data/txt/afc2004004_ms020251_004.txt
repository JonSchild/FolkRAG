COME ON, SISTER, LET'S GO AROUND THE WALL (THAT SUITS ME)
The "wall" is the wall of salvation, the wall of jubillation or
the wall of trouble.  You know you can't go over the wall, so you
have to go around it.  Just take it easy and trust in God that
you will go around it some day; with tribulations there is a great,
high wall to climb; therefore, people have to go around it.  As we
are today, we're still going around that wall.  There are many ways
of going around the wall, and this song is about going around it in
the Christianity way.
Refrain:
Come on, sister, let's go around the wall,
That suits me,
Come on, sister, let's go around the wall, (REFRAIN)
Come on, sister, let's go around the wall,
Don't want to stumble and I don't want to fall, (REFRAIN)
Come on, brother, let's go around the wall, etc.
No, I don't want to stumble and I don't want to fall, etc.
Don't want to be no hannering call, (REFRAIN)
Oh, come on, Mama, let's go around the wall, etc.
Oh, come on, Papa, let's go around the wall, etc.
No, I don't want to stumble and I don't want to fall, etc.
Want to be there when the role is called, (REFRAIN)
Oh, Satan is like a snake in the grass, etc.
Always on some Christian's path, (REFRAIN)
Lawd, if this ain't the Holy Ghost, I don't know, etc.
I never have had such love before, (REFRAIN)
