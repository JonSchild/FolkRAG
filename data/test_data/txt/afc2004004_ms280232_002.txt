TAPE 16: STANLEY SLADE. 
Gal with the Blue Dress on: 
The girl's asleep with the blue dress on. 
Shake her, Johnny, shake her ! 
And on safe count she's resting on, 
Shake her and so wake her ! 

2) Storm clouds are gathering on our lea, 
And soon back ourselves may be. 

3) She may be drenched with salt sea spray, 
So go and rouse her quick, I say. 

4) White caps are dancing on the lea, 
Run quick, or else too late you'll be. 

5) She's lying asleep there on the deck, 
No thought of sea or gale or wreck. 

6) A girl's asleep with a blue dresson, 
Go rouse her quick or too late you'll be.

Sacramento: 
1 ) In the Blackball Line I served my time, 
With a hooda, with a hooda, 
In a four-rigged ship and in her prime, 
With a hooda-hooda-day. 
Chorus: 
O blow, bullies, blow, 
For Californi-o, 
There's plenty of gold so I've been told 
On the banks of the Sacramento. 

2) Away, we're the boys to make her go, 
Around Cape Horn in frost or snow. 

3) Around Cape Stiff in 70 days, 
Around Cape Stiff is a very long way. 

4) When we were tacking around Cape Horn, 
I often wish I'd never been born. 

5) When I went aloft on the lubber's hold, 
The mate, he shouted, "Blast your soul."
