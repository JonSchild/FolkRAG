Dear Alan -
I have asked APS for a total of 
$1100.
They, in turn, have asked for
recommendations on the value of 
the project itself - not character
references.
Nothing hinges upon this grant - 
we will go ahead without it, if
necessary - but it will put me
back in the black financially.
Cordially,
Ted
