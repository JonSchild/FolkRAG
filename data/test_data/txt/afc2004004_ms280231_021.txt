Highlanders Farewell to Sicily;
1)  The pipe is dozy, the pipe is fey,
He willna come round for his vino the day,
The sky of Messina is uncou' and grey,
And all the bright charmers are hearie.
Chorus:
Fare-well ye banks of Sicily,
Fare-ye-well, ye valley and shore,
There's nae Jock will mourn the kyles o' ye,
Poor bloody bastards are weary.
Fare-well, ye banks o' Sicily,
Fare-ye-well, ye valley and shore,
There's nae hame can smooth the wiles o' ye,
Poor bloody bastards are weary.

2)  Then doon the stairs and line the water-side,
Wet your tongue, the fairie's awa",
Then doon the stair and line the waterside,
All the bright charmers are hearie.

3)  The drummie has polished the disbraw,
He canna be seen for his webbing ava',
He's beist himsel' up for a foot o' another,
Tae leave wi' his Lola, his dearie.
Cho:
Farewell, ye dives of Sicily,
Fare-ye-well, ye shilling and ha',
We'll all mind the shebeens and bothies,
Jock made a date wi' his dearie.
Farewell, ye dives o' Sicily,
Fare-ye-well, ye shilling and ha',
We'll all mind the shebeens and bothies
Where kind senorinas were cheery.

4)  Then tune the pipes and drap the tenor drums,
Leave your kit this side of the wall,
Then first
All the bright charmers are hearie.

That song is a ballad about the departure of the Highland division
from Sicily after the campaign in which it took part, which ended
in the withdrawal of the Jerries from Sicily. The Highland Div.
was needed to take part in the western offensive - the assault
in France. And so it wasn't able to go on through Italy as it would
have liked to do. So it was withdrawn from Messina down to Catania,
and Agusta, and gradually all the battalions and units were embarked
to go home to Scotland, and just about that time, when I sawe everything
packing, I got into me head that I would write a ballad about
it. And hearing the old pipe tune, Farewell to the Creeks, which is
the tune of this song, it was played one day by the massed bands of
the 153 Brigade. I started putting words ti it and this was the song
as it eventually turned out.
