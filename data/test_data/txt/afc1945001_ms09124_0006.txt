The War

Victory! that's what we are fighting for.
We Americanos son as proud of our
country as a rich man of his luxery,
even though some are pore, they are
as happy as can be.

Victory! Victory! that's what I here every
body shout "we won't victory", they
say, that's what the noise is 
all about.

Ther's a man accross the [sea] ocean 
who won'ts to ruel the world, but
don't you think He's making a great
mistake? But if he think that he
can git it just let him take a crack
at the Americanos and see just what
he will get "As if we didn't know".

"I as an American will try to do
all I can in helping the war by
buying a devense stamp every Friday.
