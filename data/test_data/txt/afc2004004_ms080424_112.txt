ELLERS   2

AL:  Well, how do you know they'd beat you to death?
Mrs. E:  They would, if you didn't mind 'em.  They would.  They
just told us. . . . .and we wouldn't break the rules.
AL:  You had fun anyway, did you?  Ever play any games when you
were a young woman, did they make toys for you?
Mrs. E:
Ellers:  We're ready now.  (they play)
AL:  We've been listening to Warren Eller and his brother Bonn-
That's a real cowboy song, isn't it?
ELLER:  Yeah, I learned that from a fella that. . . . was telling
you about, years ago.
AL:  That one really comes from Texas.  That one's not phony like
so many of them are.  That one really happened, I think.  Where
did you get most of your songs, anyway?
Eller:  Well, most of my old    songs, I learned from my mother.
I just picked 'em up right here.
AL:  Who are all these folks here this evening, could you kind of
introduce them?
Eller:  Well, this here is Ed. . . . 's wife, there's Ed over there-
what's you name?  Hazel.  And that's my wife, sitting over there,
and that's her mother, and my brother.  And there's my  brother's
wife, and there's one of my brother's little girls, and there's
my wife's brother, and who's that little girl over there?  That
there is judy's little girl, right there.  That there. . . . .
