There was a Army private and an Army Sarg.
The army private and the Sarg got into a fuss
The private told the sarg I'd fight you if you didn't
have those stripes. So the sarge took off his coat and
stripes was on his shirt then he took off his shirt
the stripes was on his arm and he told the private let's
fight the private said no if I do I'll be put in the
guard house
