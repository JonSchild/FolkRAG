Three soldiers on leave for 3 day, after 2 months
of intensive fighting in the desert in the African
Campaign, went to one of the towns the have
a big time. They'd been without a drink of
whiskey during their battles, so, they decided to
get a bottle of that native brew whiskey. They got 
one and then went to a hotel and got a room. After
the second day of continuous drinking, one of 
the bleary eyed soldiers staggered to the 
window and looked out. Startled and fearful,
he turned to his two prostrated companions 
and yelled -----
"Hey, you guys!! Don't drink anymore of that
stuff. It's poison. I just looked out of 
Roosevelt out there reviewing the troops"!!!!
