GERMAN CAMPAIGN AGAINST RUMORS      ? Ã— 20


        Augsburger National Zeitung of October 24, 1942, in a prominent 
article on the campaign against rumor: "Man is dissatisfied
with ordinary, natural events. He inclines to believe in things
which, if he reflected upon them, he would recognize as impossible.
He does not weigh what he has heard, especially if it does not correspond 
with his own desires. We even hear people who are otherwise
absolutely trustworthy relate facts which they don't believe themselves.
They hear an impossible rumor and relay it without any reflection,
and they regard all criticism of rumor as a personal offense.
From their point of view they are no longer reporting rumor but fact,
because eventually they themselves believe what they say. Frequently, 
these fantasies bear a rich harvest. The dreamers see documents which
record things that were never written, military officials who leave
cards with remarks leading to ridiculous conclusions, and diplomats
who travel to places where they would have been killed long ago.
They know the most secret plans of the Fuehrer, and with a ring of
conviction, they discuss things which nobody is really expected to
know. But these people get their information from the London radio
or an out-of-date book of prophecies. It is from such sources that
rumors arise. We must arm ourselves against such information. We 
must discount ninety-nine per cent of every rumor. The proverb,
"Where there's smoke, there's fire," is only partly true, because some
things which smoke couldn't possibly be mistaken for fire. Therefore
don't spread rumors. You will only deceive yourself and harm the general 
morale. Rumors are always harmful....."
