Reverend Roe - Reel 2 - P. 4

[*Itinerant preaching*]
never anxious to go ahead of nobody - things like that. Just when my time
comes, I just get up and do the best I can and if that feeling comes over me,
why, it's just all right.
Now, I have had some very hard times in my ministry because after I began
preaching I'd go wherever I heard of a place that was suffering for the
Gospel, I'd go if I had to walk. I had walked as high as twelve miles on
Sunday morning and preached all day and wouldn't get a meal. And sometimes I
would have to stay all night and I have gone through the field and pulled
years of corn and carried along with me. And after I'd go, I'd take that
ear of corn and eat it to kinda satisfy my stomach.
A:  The folks wouldn't even give you anything to eat? They didn't want you there,
or they were too poor to feed you, or what?
[*Hard times as preacher*]
R:  I think they were mostly too poor, and then -- of course a lot of people who
worked on white folk'ses farms had to get all their food from the white folks
and on some cases didn't allow them to feed nobody, and that might have been
the reason, you know, I didn't ask. I only went there to serve and I did that
and would have to walk back sometimes, hongry. That had happened to me more
than once. Lots of time. But it didn't stop me, I would still go, anywhere
that I know the people needed the Gospel I'd go. I remember going to a church
one day. When I got there, there was a man up a tree, ringing a bell, when I
got out there (I started early) and I went on up to the church. Had a lot of
children there and he got on in there and had a little Sunday school, and
after Sunday school, why I talked to the children a little and asked about
the service, and he told me, he says, "Why, I don't know nothing about
service. I'll tell you the truth about me," - says - "I'm a gambler. When
I leave here, I'm going to a place over here to gamble, but I just don't
want the children to be without Sunday school here. I just started a Sunday
school here for the children.  I know the folks who claim to be Christians
