home wid dat song on my min' an' I'd sit right down wid my
box an' try to play it. If it wouldn' come to me right then
I'd go lay down an' sleep. In de night some time it would
ring in my head an' I'd jump right outa de bed an' 'gin to
whip dat tune on my li'l' box."

Certainly young Mozart was no more absorbed in music than young,
black Huddle Ledbetter. We have seen other Negro boys of his age
in the same dreamy state, sitting all afternoon out behind
the house in the shade, half-asleep except for their
long, swift fingers that were running up and down the
frets of a guitar. Humming some blues, repeating the same simple,
minor phrase lazily and drumming, their fingers acquiring
strength and deftness, these boys are usually good-for-nothing around a farm. At night
they are off through the woods playing for a party and coutring. The next day they sleep and eat and play their guitars and sleep again. Thus Huddle. he 
performed for himself, his family, his friends, then ( as 
Margaret says) for a church recital. "When his fame had spreaded
round," he began to play for parties and dances over the country-
side. Old man Wess Ledbetter, watching him go off night after night
his only son of whom he was so proud, was worried. He had been to
dances and he knew they were the scene of frequent and bloody
fights.
