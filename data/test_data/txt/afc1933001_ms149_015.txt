Dear Mr. Lyons,
There is nothing I would be more interested in then
in meeting your old chap from Tamworth, New Hampshire. I am
planning a trip into New England in November and should like
to call on him then. It would be a great courtesy to both the
Library of Congress and myself if you would tell me how I
may get in touch with him. Is he an educated person, a trained
singer? Are his ballads written down or does he keep them in his
head? I look forward to hearing more about him,-- and about any
other person or persons in the same or other regions who know
fragments or wholes of ballads, folk-songs, fiddle-tunes or
folk-tales. I very much appreciate your letter.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
