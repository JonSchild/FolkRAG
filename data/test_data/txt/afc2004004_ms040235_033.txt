24th August, 1951

Dear Mrs. McLeod,

Thank you for your charming letter and for the very interesting note which I'll certainly use in my work.

The contract that the BBC sent you was not for work that you will do, but for what you have already done in recording for me.  Some of the records I made will be actually used on BBC on a programme called "Scots Musicalogue" to be broadcast soon.

With all kind regards,

Sincerely,

(Alan Lomax)

Mrs. R. MacLeod,
