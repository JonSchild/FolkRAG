CLUB FISTS

A play of the slave children of Dawson, Georgia

     The children make fists with the thumb up, stacking their
fists one on top of the other so that (except for the bottom fist)
each fist encloses the thumb of the one beneath it.  The bottom
fist belongs to the Leader.
Leader:  What's that you got there?
Top Fist:  Club fist.
Leader:  Do you want me to take it off, knock it off, or
have a crow to pick it off?
     Fists come off the bottom fist and stay off, when one player
says to the Leader:
Player:  What you got there?
Leader:  Cheese an' bread.
Player:  Where's my cheese?
Leader:  The rat got it.
Player:  Where's the rat?
Leader:  The cat got it.
Player:  Where's the cat?
Leader:  The dog kill him.
Player:  Where's the dog?
Leader:  The stick beat the dog.
Player:  Where's the stick?
Leader:  Fire burn it.
Player:  Where's the fire?
Leader:  Water squenched it.
Player:  Where's water?
Leader:  The ox drinked it.
Player:  Where's the ox?
Leader:  The butcher killed him.
Player:  Where's the butcher?
