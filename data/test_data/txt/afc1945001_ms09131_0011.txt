A friend of my mother's was a member of Polish aristocracy.
She lives in this country with her husband and children. Last
year she received a letter from her brother in Poland - he 
was the president of an insurance company. In his letter
he told his sister that he was not living as she
knew he had, and he asked her for clothing. It was
sent through the censor, therefor the sister did not send
anything to him for fear the German army would take it.
