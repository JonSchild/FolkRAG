This duplication of the Archive records must be done within the
year in duplicate, a master copy being made at the same time as 
one copy for cataloging and study purposes is cut. Copies of These [records] copies
we can often exchange for copies of records in other collections
and thus more strongly urge that all collectors make their records
available for duplication and distribution as soon as is practical.

Besides the duplication of the records in the Archive, a certain
number of [records] blank discs should be set aside for duplication of records
in other collections. These records, too, should be made in
duplicate, a master [record] duplicate and a [master copy] study copy.

[For duplication of the Archive records during 1941:
16 in. acetates 1028 total.
[16] 12 in. aluminum for cataloging and transcription - 4000
total:___________________
For duplication of records [other than those] outside of the Archive of
American Folk Song:
16 in. acetate ([2] 1 copies of each record)]
[total]

II. A very large number of records can be obtained by gift from
commercial companys such as; Columbia Recording Co., Victor, 
and Decca if we submit to them lists which we wish to put on
file and if we also request them to send us their current releases
of Race, Hillbilly and Foreign language recordings. I 
strongly urge that this work be undertaken at once. It can
be carried on by [a] workers from the Library of Congress music project
with one assistant under the supervision of the Archive of American
Folk Songs.

III. The interest of the Library of Congress in field recording will
be due to recent developments somewhat different in the future
than it has been in the past. Hitherto, the Archive has had two
main concerns:

1. To accumulate [in a fairly haphazard fashion] all songs
its expeditions could record.

2. To get representative material of all types and from
all regions in the United States.

It is felt that this field work of the Archive can be greatly improved
by; 1. more careful planning, and, 2. keeping the future
