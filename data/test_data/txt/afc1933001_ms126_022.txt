Dear Mr. Lomax: 
Your letter was forwarded to me 
here after your planned date to leave 
Washington. I went home for a few days
to arrange for a leave of absence and I 
hoped you would come during that time 
even though my only sister was in the 
midst of getting settled in a new home 
Indeed I am an ardent collector 
and we might be of assistance to, each 
other! In the last nine years, I have 
gathered some 3000 songs and ballads 
from the Cumberlands and hundreds from 
European countries. [S????aphone] records
