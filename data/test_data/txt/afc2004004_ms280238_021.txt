the air was coming this way.  Well - he went to work while we
were fighting for a principle.  [H e] He was condemning what we
were fighting for.
J________:  Our S. Wales mines union was out in strike, and
up in England another in the Spencer Union that was the masters
union, supported by the masters, and they were trying to get
our Welsh boys to join that union.
Lomax:  You were working under [t] very bad conditions.
Tom:  Yes we were.  Our minimum there was Â£2.11.0. in 1926.
Working six days a week.
Lomax:  And what about safety?
Tom:  It was putrid because you didn't get the facilities you
are getting today.  In that time they were colliers - you
had to be a collier to work a place on your own - but today its
all machinery work, and [you're] you've got men doing different
jobs for safety - got more bosses than they've got colliers
under the National Coal Board.  And 50% of the men are only
theory - they're not practical.
Lomax:  It's safer today than it was.
Tom:  Oh yes it is.
Lomax:  [Tell me,] Tell me about yourself.  Was your father
a miner?
C______:  Yes, my father worked in the old pit.  In my younger
days when I started to work - because as soon as we were on the [verg]
verge of leaving school - we thought - What a glorious time to
go underground.  We had that in our blood.  When I started to
work I felt like a man - looking forward to start.  Well we'd
go to work Monday morning - wouldn't see daylight till Saturday,
and were taking advantage on Sunday.  But we had to go to
Chapel and Sunday School, and a prayer meeting on Monday night,
Wednesday night and Thursday night singing school - Friday
of course we'd go to the old opera house and there'd be a play
there perhaps.  And we used to enjoy it, too.  We had to be in
by ten oclock.

Break . . .

But every fortnight there was a blank day or a pay day - and
on the blank if you had 3d you were jolly luckier.  But it's
surprising the [pleasyre] pleasure we were drawing out of it.
We was taught to go to Chapel and on Singing School and so
[hox go- but we was dying to go to the theatre - but we dare]
forth - but we was dying to go to the theatre - but we dare
not go with our parents.
