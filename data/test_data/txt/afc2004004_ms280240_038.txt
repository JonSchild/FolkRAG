10/III
No, no, but I have seen me getting, getting scared with. . .
There was one time when I was along the road and it was a very,
very dark. . .well, it was dark in this wood and a good bit to
go through there, it were about, about five mile of a wood,
and wood on both sides of me, and of course, the moon was
shining too and, of course, I thoughit was something moving
in front of me - justmeself, you see. But I had a good
drinking. Oh I had a great drinking, i was - tipsy.
And I saw this thing moving in front of me, on the road, you
see, and I wondered what it was, you see. And when I moved
it moved along with me. It was a good distance away but I,
but I. . .. a hundred yards away from me, it would have been
about a hundred yards in front of me. And I stood up and
it stood up, and it stopped and when I moved to one side, het
moved too, and darn it, I thought it was something standing
in front of me. So, I had a bottle of beer in my pocket and
I took some of the. . .swig out of the bottle of beer and I said,
"Here goes, I'll face it, whatever it is." So up I goes, right
in front of me, and do you what it was? It happened to be
a pool of water. It was the moon shining in thepool of water
and the wind, and My God! (laughs) I went right. . .and walked
right into the pool of water, and I says, "Well," I says,
and I stood about half ab hour looking at it - before I went
to the - poolof water.
(Whose the meanest person you ever met on the road Jimmy.?)
Oh well, there's some awful, aye, there was a policeman. . .I
