Dear Mr. Spivacke:
Please send to me at Merryville, La. (You may have to use
Parcel Post) 25 Twelve inch records. Before we leave here we
will ship you 75 field records. In nearly every instance Miss
Terrill is including Typed copies of the words contained on each
record; also the slang of the song and the singers. This will be
a big saving for the Library. Writing down the words from the
record playing is a long, tedious job. Please get Mr. Henderson
or Dudley to send me the titles of the songs we recorded at
Livingston, Ala. The name of singers are Richard Amerson, Rich
Brown, Enoch Brown, Vera Hall, Blind Jesse, Henry Reed, the
Travis family, Tom Bell. The records came in two different places
in the catalogue.
Also the song titles given by Mrs. G.A. Griffin, Newberry,
Fla. (Alton Morris' old Georgia Cracker woman). I wish to avoid
needless duplication at both these places.
We have had some delay in having the machine tuned up. Last
night, however, the records I made were again up to a high
standard. You are getting day and night and Sunday work from two
people instead of one and in the section richest in folk tunes.
We will give an audition to a select group of your intimates
after we are rested a bit from our trip.
I have not heard finally from you on the Gamut matter,
though I've already filled half dozen records (Gamut's discs)
taking waivers in each case.
Again I thank you for promptly making the way easy for us.
Alan has written me frequently of what a fine job you are doing
and I understand why,
Always sincerely,
John A. Lomax
