Dear Alan:

Apropos of your recent letters to Harold requesting
the use of a recording machine, we have had requests from
other collectors in the New York area and also from the
New York Public Library.  The Library hopes we will be able
to deposit a machine with them to be used at the New York
Public and presumably on brief loan to collectors in and
around New York City.  Do you think this is a good idea?
From our point of view it seems to be since a machine will
be permanently located in New York City and with many
collectors using it, much material will be gathered.  Also
from our point of view, it is good to see New York Public
Library taking an interest in the field.  If you can help in
stimulating their collection there, it would be a considerable
gain to the field.  Let me know what you think.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Duncan Emrich
Chief, Folklore Section
