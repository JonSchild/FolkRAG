rumors are being circulated by Axis sympathizers." He takes too 
long to get to the actual denial. At no point does he specifically 
state the rumor is false even though he does end up that they 
are ridiculous. The careful reader could not be sure that in the 
course of the procedure described, unfit drinking water may not 
have been discovered and labelled such. The casual reader is 
very likely to stop with the feeling that the only counteraction
 is that this sort of thing is hard for an Army man to imagine (but 
apparently the civilian public has a better imagination).

"RUMOR--Several soldiers at a camp near here 
have died recently as the result of poisonous 
insecticide being mixed with their bread. At 
a large replacement center, poison has been 
found in the drinking water of soldiers.

"FACT--The Lieutenant Colonel in charge of the 
center says: 'This, too, is one of the oldest 
rumors in this war, or of any other war. It 
seems obvious such rumors are being circulated 
by Axis sympathizers.

"'In my 37 years' experience in the Regular 
Army, I cannot imagine either of these things 
happening. Rigid regulations are in force in 
the inspection of food and water for American 
soldiers. So stringent are these regulations, 
that the soldier is given much more protection 
than the average civilian gets. Army labora-
tories, manned by trained scientists, are giv-
ing the soldier the best protection that can 
be had. These rumors are absolutely ridicu-
lous." 

Sometimes desire to be authoritative and complete 
leads to a complexity of presentation in the course of which 
the [hub] point of the argument is overlooked [and] The following illustrates 
that in such cases there [is still] may be no answer to the rumor; here, we still don't know whether 
the scrap rubber will be used.

"RUMOR--Much of the scrap rubber recently col-
lected will never be used.
