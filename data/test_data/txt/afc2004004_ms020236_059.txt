[*(JOE DEAN, CONCLUSION)*]
[*(RECAPITULATION)*]
But I went to Fitzgerald.  From Fitzgerald I got to where Bob 
stayed at an' all like that, see.  Stayed out at [(mill?)] them 
places, out there.   So I never even seen Joe Dean no mo' in my 
life.
             But one day I was talkin' to 'em about -- I reckon about 
seven years ago.  I was right there in Brunswick.   An' the 
man was talkin' about -- he talkin' about Wes' Green an' so on.  
I asked him, "Did you know a man there named Joe Dean?"  I didn't 
tell 'im nothin' [ -- he asked]  else, you know, [if] it was a white man.  
Said, "Yes!"   Said, "Ol' Joe's in Jacksonville now.   His sons all 
married an' got chilruns an' he done got old an' crippled. . ."  
Said, "He walk with a stick now."  [Said,] Ha, ha!  said, Thank 
God!, I said to myself.   Ha, ha, ha!   Said, "He stay in Jacksonville, 
Florida," he said.   Said, "He worked out there to -- 
                                         -- said he worked out there to the airbase 
a long time."  I said to myself, "Well, I worked out there, too, but I 
didn't see him!"  Huh, ha, ha, ha, ha!   Oh Lawd!   That was cool!  
But I was washin' out my old linen in my life an' it all come 
back by my own people, tryin' to get me into sumpin' that they 
was doin'.                                                      [*repeat*]  It's a job to pull out from 
'em if they get behind ya that way.  But I was gonna cuss him out, you know.  
(To appease my mind?)  An' I was gonna blow 'im a while (?)
 'cause I had a lil' gun; I could blow, too.   But they tol' me -- 
I took their advice.   Said, "You wanna see your mama an' your 
chilrun again, you better talk to him nice."   An' that night, ya' 
see, he come up on me, an' that man in that house, I walked back 
in there, I coulda killed 'im.   My own colored man comin' in there
an' tell me, "Jus a man wanna see ya."  "Jus' a man."  An' knowin', 
too, that if he jus' look at one of them white womens like that -- 
an' one get too white, in a family, they figure he shouldn' a had it.  
An' then comin' there an' tellin' me that.  I coulda killed 'im.  
I walked back in the house; I didn't speak; I didn't say nothin 
to him at all, not nary a word.   An' so he seed -- looked like I --
jus' figured I reckon -- he just got up, "Well, I see y'all."  An' 
he lef'. . .Nasty devil. . .I got to thinkin' about [that] him sometime; he 
oughta been shot.   But he sure did it.  I know Joe Dean paid 'im, but 
they was scared not to come if he said so, because they was scared 
of 'im.

             He come direct from New York.  He had real dark skin.  He
had coal black hair an' had jus' a lil' bit of moustache, cut jus'
