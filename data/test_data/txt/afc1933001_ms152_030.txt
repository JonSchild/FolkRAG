Dear John:

I am delighted to hear that Charles Smith
is working with you on the Christmas concert. I am
going to call on the Golden Gate Quartet day after
tomorrow and I'll try to hand them some work songs
for you. You certainly should get together a group
of New Orleans musicians with Jelly Roll for the 
concert. I think his recent Bluebird recordings
completely vindicated him as a musician. Sorry I 
can't be there but best of luck. 

Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
