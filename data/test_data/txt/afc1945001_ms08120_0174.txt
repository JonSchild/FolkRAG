1. A rumor - that some markets are 
selling horse meat
2 What made that salior whistle 
when that girl went by because 
there wasn't a soldier around
3 A very ugly passed a sailor
Sailor - Gee but your beautiful what 
beautiful eyes. What lovley hair 
what a shape your my dream 
girl.
Girl - Oh you don't relly mean it do
you?
Sailor - No I just left GuadeCanal and 
[and] anything look good to me.
4 A Solider who had just come 
from a long hike took off his 
shoes and started fanning his 
feet. his friend said in a annoyed 
voice stop that your feet smell. 
The first soldier smiled and said 
you arn't the only one who smell 
defeat.
