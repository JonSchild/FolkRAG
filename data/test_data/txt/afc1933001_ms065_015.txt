In the event that you can consider the acceptance of this invita-
tion, I should add that we publish an Annual Bulletin, in which
we print the addresses of speakers who make them available to us.
Of course, a copy of it will be sent to you upon its publication.
Then, too, if you can consider the acceptance of this talk, you
will be our guest of honor at the banquet.

Should be it be that you cannot come to St. Louis, I should like
to ask if it would be possible for you to accept the same invitation
for our Milwaukee convention, July 1-3, 1940?

So that I may have our preliminary program released, I shall be
deeply grateful for an early reply.

I do hope that it will be possible for you to do this for us.

    Sincerely yours,
    Clara MacGowan
    Clara MacGowan,
    President.
