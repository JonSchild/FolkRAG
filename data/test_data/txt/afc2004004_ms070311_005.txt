over that load of logs and 
let his team go down over the 
bank. It killed one outright 
& we had to kill the other one.  
We fellows believed a team depends 
on their driver. He can a lot 
out of team if he asks for it. 
If he'd stood his ground, etc. and
[dared] cheered 'em and slapped
'em along, he could have boot them 
through. They wor a good lively 
team. They warrn't human, they 
didn't know. One simple move 
of that off horse and they could 
have made it around. We didn't 
think much of him to leave his team 
when they needed his advice
