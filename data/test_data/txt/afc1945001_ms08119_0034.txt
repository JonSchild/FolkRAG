1. "We're going to graduate in May," was a 
rumor which I heard, "because the boys 
are to be drafted as soon as they graduate."
2. A joke which I heard said, that we were
going to share the Pacific Ocean with the Japs.
"Sure," said a sailor, "We take the top and they 
take the bottom."
3. A Berlin radio report said that the people
in the United States were starving. Everyone
goes around saying "What's cookin'?"
4. A barber said to a soldier, "Haven't
I shaved you before?" The private said, 
"No, I got that scar at Pearl Harbor."
