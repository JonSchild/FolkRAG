less. In the Vienna Youth Hostel we got bed and
breakfast (two cups of coffee and two rolls) for
a quarter. You had to take breakfast there. All
Vienna was cheap though. The restaurants were
nearly empty, and the prices were so low. Vienna
is really nearly dead. We heard no music there
except one band in a park. All the restaurants
closed at nine o' clock. They had demonstrations
there at night, but we saw absolutely nothing
else in the evenings.
Send me Sudie's and Steve's address, please. 
I've written Steve and  Sergei twice, once in care 
of you at the Library, once in care of the University,
but I've gotten no answer. The letter I
sent in care of you must have gotten there 
while you were in Indiana, so you may not
even have received it. If you are in touch with
the student movement in Washington, I wish
you'd write me the address. Penn Victor will 
send any student material from all over the
world to any student group (ASO; CLR what) whose address I
can give her- monthly mailings. Only it's so
provoking, I've completely lost touch with everybody
just now, and I have nothing to tell her,
except mine, of course. If you can get me any job
or whatever with the World's Fair business, for God's
sake do it. I'm going to load up next year with so much to
I ought to have a marvellous time. Write, write. All my love Bess
