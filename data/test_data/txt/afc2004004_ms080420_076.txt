Woman:  That's what I remember about growing up was (unint)
. . .mama making me wash hands because I was the only one in the
house that could use my hands down in the yard(?).
(all talking at once; unint.)

AL:  . . . .woman in the mountains back here, why don't you tell us
about that?
Nellie:  Yeah, it was hard, you couldn't get money to buy nothing,
A man would have to work a day for more than a dollar!  My daddy,
I remember him working lots of one dollar days, to buy something to
eat with.  Lot of people would go in the mountains (unint) and
dig these herbs, you know, take 'em up to Ashville to sell 'em to
get clothes and things you'd have to wear.  Times was really hard
then, but you could make pretty plenty to eat on the farm.  Big
enough to work, we always had work, from the time I was 8 years old
I had to work.  Had cows, and horses, and hogs.  We'd kill about two
hogs every year to eat hogs, and beef.  We'd dry our fruit,
there wasn't such things as cans back in them days; just had to dry
it on a till.  You laid your till out and dried your apples and your
peaches and holed up a lot of things out from dirt.  The cabbage
and the beets and harsh(?) potatoes.  You could (unint) sweet
potatoes and put them where they wouldn't freeze and keep them.
It was a very hard time when I was growin' up.  But we lived pretty
good, you know, pretty good.  But I mean it's hard times to get money
