That kind of work was a pleasure to 
them  - the carding and & spinning & all that
they had a pride in it & took a
pleasure in it.  When they saw a beautiful piece of cloth well that was a 
reward for the labor they had put into it

At that time all the cloth the men wore was made by
their wives & their mothers.  They always
had to get blue cloth.  It was so thick
that they never wore an overcoat with it
as no rain would go thru it.  It was
waulked for a whole night.  Cloth has
to be shrunk.  For blankets & [hour's?]
waulking would be sufficient, but for
the fisherman's blue cloth, they'd start at
6 in the morning & wouldn't be finished till
10 at night with songs going all the 
time.  When that was shrunk to that
extent nothing wd go thru it.

The praise of the neighbors was payment for all
their labor.

To a stranger, when you're going there, it seems
a very barren island, 75% rock, & you
get there, there are certainly very lovely sandy
beaches, but I think the great attraction in
Barna is the warmth of the heart of the people
When you get to know it because if you
get to know them they'll take you to their heart
- much more than the island itself.
You take away the people
