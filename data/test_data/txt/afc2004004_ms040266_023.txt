2.

and I didn't know that Mr. Solomon could stop
you doing what you like with them. So here now
in my written permission, just incase.
    I am not assuming you could ever
find any good in them, its  just that I gave
them to you because I liked you and it was
none of Mr. Solomon's business.

At the moment I am trying to earn my
fare and some digs money and I'll be back in
London. I can't say when that will be as things
are a little awkward here now, but I hope I can
call and see you when I get there.

  Drop  me a note soon and let me know
how things are with you and your little daughter.
Also give my regard to your nice American girl
and to Shirley Collins. I didn't catch the American
girl's name right and I didn't like to ask her
again, so could you tell me. Thanks.

Did you ever hear a song that has the
air of The Girl I Left Behind Me, and it is
called The Real Ol Mountain Dew. :-?

Let waters flow, or the breeze blow, 
In a free and easy way.
Just give me enough, of the rare ol' stuff,
Thats made in Galway Bay.
The Custom's all from Donegal, 
Sligo on Leitrim too. 
Can roast in Hell before the get a smell,
or a taste of the Mountain Dew.

Yours Sincerely
Gerard Campbell
