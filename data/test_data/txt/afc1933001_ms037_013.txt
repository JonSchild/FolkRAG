INRE: Manuscript "Los Pastores"

I have read the manuscript entitled "Los Pastores" and, overlooking the terrible mispellings and mistakes and also overlooking the transcription of almost all of it into prose when it is evident that it was originally written in verse, I might state that the play has all the characteristics of the old Spanish Religious dramas and there are parts which very likely were written at the end of the Seventeenth Century by some of the disciples of the great Calderon.  The play has all the characteristics of an Auto Sacramental, a dramatic composition very popular in Spain until the beginning of the Eighteenth Century.  As a final statement I think the work has some very beautiful scenes and it is worth while keeping it if for no other reason than to show the interest work of the missionaries, religious as well as cultural, among the Indians of the New World.
