the other vult members, more particularly of the officers and
in the last analysis of the houngan or mombo in charge of the ceremony
to take care [of] of him. The houngan [must] at such times treats
the possessed person much as if he were a child[/], and a king at the same time, humoring him,
listening to all his conversation, feeding him, bullying him, and
finally seeing that [he is] the god is dismissed [after he in] in a happy frame
of mind when he has stayed his time out. At times the loa refuses
to be humored and sent away and threatens the family holding the dance
and the houngan, as circumstances warrnts. At times the loa grow
violent and try to hurt the other people present. And at times the
Gods who have [mount t] mounted the heads of their devotees [t] ride
their earthly chargers dangerously hard. I have seen possessed
persons fall to the ground, against chairs and so forth with a force
sufficient tot bruise most [individuals] people, but I never heard of
a person hurt in this fashion. [O] Often, however, the possessed person
falls on the ground[in] and [cannot be picke] and is so stiff that he
cannot be picked up. At such time it is the duty of the houngan to
pour a libation to the gods and to pick him up. Sometimes the
possessed persons roll in the mud and then they have to be sent
off and cleaned up. The houngan is supposed to see to the well-being
of all such [people] cases and thus the above song.
