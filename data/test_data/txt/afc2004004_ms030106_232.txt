Rags, bottles and bones men.

The rags-bottles and bones men would take some of these Christmas
horns and take wooden mouthpieces off them and play more blues on them
than any guys in these parts of the country ever thought of. Real low
down dirty blues, too, I mean. They couldn't play but in one key, though. 

John Rolichaux had the best ragtime band in N.O.- the best for years.,
1904-1905 or earlier. His biggest competition was named Manual Perez, the
best trumpet player- as goo or better than Buddy Bolden.
