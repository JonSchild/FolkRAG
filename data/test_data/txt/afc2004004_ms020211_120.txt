Dear Mr. Lomax:
This firm represents Walker Art Center, Inc. and its subsidiary organization,

for the folk song concert to be presented at the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre,
Minneapolis, Minnesota, on February 8, 1964.
It is understood that the above-mentioned group will perform for one concert

Very truly yours,
