1.  A private in the army says he will 
always play dumb so as to never become 
an officer, for as he is he can gamble and 
do things that officers cannot do.  

2.  A man received his papers from the 
draft board to report within a short 
length of time.  When he reported to the boa

that he could not keep his religion 
and go out to kill someone he knows 
nothing about.
