The analysis developed by the analytical staff should be
organized [with] in the light of the requirements of the educational program. [in mind]
This calls for a  very close coordination of analytical and educational
directors. Both should have clearly in mind the possibilities and
requirements of the total educational programs and the general intensive
campaigns as well as the precise sort of thing that goes into direct
counteraction programs. By direct counteraction, we refer to the sort of
regular publicity release which presents a rumor is designed to eliminate the
particular item from currency, on the assumption that if given a choice
between a true and false statement, the truth will always prevail. This
assumption, for implementation and translation into a sure, sound working
guide, requires that the items that are paired are clearly labeled truth
and falsehood in some form or another, and that in the presentation, care
be taken that no advantage from the point of view of the psychology of
remembering be given to the falsehood. Care must also be exercised lest
the community be unduly aroused about the effectiveness of Axis propaganda,
neighbors become suspicious of one another, animosities are aroused, and
individuals develop feelings of guilt or general anxiety. Below [xxx] an
effort will be made to organize some specific suggestions for direct counteraction
programs. This one type of program is being singled our because it
represents the newest weapon in the battle against rumor, the one about
which least is generally known; not because it is the most important weapon
for the rumor control project. As a matter of fact, the direct counteraction
program should be an incidental part of the project with the more familiar
general informational campaigns playing the most important roles.
