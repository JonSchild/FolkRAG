designed to give equality in grade to the levees on both sides of the river. Finally, bills were introduced by representatives of Arkansas and Louisiana, in both the house and the senate, providing for this equality and the abandonment of the principle of diversion for the middle section of the river.
          These bills were referred to the Committees on Flood Control and your levee boards appeared before the committee and at the hearings held in May of this year, strenously objecting to the approval of the proposed legislation, with the result that a favorable compromise was secured and the feud of a dozen years standing between Arkansas and Louisiana on one side and Mississippi on the other, was laid.
          The bill finally favorably reported by the House Committee on Flood Control and concurred with by the Senate Committee and with the recommendation that it do pass, provided that the levees on the west bank shall be constructed to a one-foot freeboard, and the levees on the east or Mississippi Bank, shall have a three-foot freeboard above the compulated project flood.
          Thus, Mississippi shall have an advantage in grade of two feet over the opposing levees and is assured positive protection against overflow.
          The Boeuff floodway and the Eudora floodways are abandoned. Also the act authorizes the construction of a levee along the west bank of the Yazoo River for the protection of the nearly one million acres of land now periodically overflowed by backwater from the Mississippi River. This project, estimated to cost $11,982,000, will be constructed wholly at the government expense,
