BJ TAPE 7B, p. 17

that lil' hill an' the lil' yard there, somethin' said to me, say,
"That preacher what you're out hearin', he ain't nothin'. He
go wit' that woman what's down here singin' wit' 'im, down here.
He ain't nothin' either. He go with another woman. He, he got
a wife an' go with a woman." Ya see? All them things.
I got up on the hill; I got to the church. When I looked in
the church, there was set the preacher an' this same woman. Ya
see? He was settin' up in the pulpit an' she over there. An' she
was helpin' him run this meetin' ' cause his wife was pregnant an'
she couldn't help then, ya see. She was too far gone. An' he had
sent for her 'cause she's a real war horse Christian, to help
'im, ya see? An' so, dat was the devil. Devil knowed that, ya
see? So devil put to me: "He ain't -- He, he go wit' her,
see in there?" By the time I got to the do' lookin' at 'er. / So says,
"See there? See? See?
Den I was so confused. It done told me I ain' nothin';
no need a' me goin' back. If I go back, I ain' nothin'; if I
go fahwa'ds, I ain' nothin'. You know what I mean? So I walked
on off around the back -- the side a the church. The big ol'
ah, palm, ah, tree there, ya know, a pa[l]mietta palm tree? I
'member well. I leaned against that tree an' I said, "Lawd,
whatsoever the peoples doin', let them do it. And save them.
Whatsoever they doing', let them do it. An' save me. An' save
them. I ain't got nothin' to do with it." An' when I walked 
off from there, it seemed like sumpinâ€™ had pulled clo'es off
me, like I jus' was standin' in a great big open place, pretty,
my myself. All that old filth, funny feelin' lef' me.
