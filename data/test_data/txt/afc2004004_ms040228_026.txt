The winds, the winds, the winds blow high
The rain comes scattering from the sky
She is handsome, she is pretty
She is the girl from the golden city
She goes out with a one,two, three
Pray tell me who is he.
Johnny Smith says he loves her
All the boys are fighting for her
Let them say what they will
Johnny Smith loves her still
Takes her down to the lily white Hall
Takes her down to the alter
Gives her kisses and says Goodbye
To mrs Jones daughter.
