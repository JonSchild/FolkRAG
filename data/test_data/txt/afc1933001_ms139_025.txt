My dear Mr. Lomax:

I was sorry to miss you in August. IN fact, I was handling a
short course in American balladry at Greeley, Colorado, when you
came into our lumberwoods-of-yesterday area. some of my interesting
old fellows have told me about you; they liked you.

What you got from Bill McBride and any of the other boys you 
have my permission to file in the archives. And you need not send
me copies, for I have already collected what these shanty-boys have.
However, I would like to get copies of the records, if that is
possible.

Thanks for your kind offer. I have no ambitions other than to
have the songs of these old fellows recorded. Since you have experts
in the handling of electric recording machines, I suggest that you send a man and a machine into this area and let me work with him.
If I could get records for file here, I would be happy to donate my
services.

Since these men are old and the winters are somewhat severe, I
suggest that you send your apparatus and expert in April. But do not
fail this April, for five of my best sources are eighty or thereabouts.
I have lost two valuable men in the last two years; others may go at
any time.

Besides the singing of ballads, I can put you in contact with
shanty-boy fiddlers, dulcimer players, and story tellers. And there
is an ensemble group that is "tops".

May I hear from you again soon?

Yours truly,
E.C. Beck
