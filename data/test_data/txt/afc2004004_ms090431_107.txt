Oh, Miss Rosy,

When you marry,
Write me a leeter.
Feel that letter.
With that letter.
You lucky we seed,
And let your garden grow indedd.
You owe me
Fifteen dollars
Hear it ring
In your pocket.
"Rattle like silver,
Silver and gold.

This game is played by the children. They form a ring and the ring[s]
moves around while the children sing until they get to the part where
they say ding-ding and then one [of] in the center of the ring swings
aroudn until the end of the song.
I learned this song about 18 years ago in Friar's Point school in Lion
Miss. All played this game [xhere thex] who played this game were the
teen-age children. It's still being played today.

Shortnin Bread.

Shortnin bread,
Oh, the skillet,
Put on the lid.
I'm gonna cook
A little shortnin bread.
Around in, shortnin bread,
Round in, shortnin bread.
I do now, shrotnin bread,
I do now, shrnin bread.
Ever since my dog's
If you been writing up
My pot beat.
I do now, shortnin bread,
I do now, shortnin bread.
You all knew, shortnin bread,
You all knew, shortnin bread.

This game is a stealing-partner game. Children form a ring and steal
partners. I learned this game about 18 years ago in Friar's Point school
in Miss.
