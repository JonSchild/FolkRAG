BJ TAPE 40, p. 32

     Every nigger from every...
     Every nigger from every trigger,
     An'  every man from every land.
     I see-- I seed every man, from every land...
That's the way it go.
     I also seed ol' Vip an' Van...
You know who that is?
TL:  No.
BJ:    I also seed ol' Vip an' Van,
        I seed ol' Nicodemus,
        He was comin' down on one bean row,
        He had on a coat, he had on a hat,
        But wasn't nothin' in this world like that man they call Pat;
        He was the wuss-- He was the greatest bean picker that
                     ever -- That we ever had seed,
        He picked beans from, from, from Fladah to New Orleans...
Now, that is that other one now?  Oh... Ow, Lawd!  It [was]'s about
Vip an' Van too.  But....
TL:  What's the name of this thing?
BJ:  Ah, hit, hit jus'; this is aw, bean-pickin' poem about the
muck, you know, see.  An' how, how, how the peoples picked beans
on, on the muck.  An' how [it was] they was down there, that what it mean.
It made a long poem out of it.  Many more poems made out of it.
TL:  Where did you make this poem out?
BJ:  Well, I heard 'em talkin' it in the fields, from one to the
other, an' makin' these, these poems, A-a-at one another, about
one another you know; that's what it was.  An' some really was, ah, jus'

TL:  Bean-pickin' Pat was one of them?
