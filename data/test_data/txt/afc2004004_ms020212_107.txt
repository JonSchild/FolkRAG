Alan Lomax, Esq. - 4/29/63      2.

When Bessie Jones arrives I thought I would simply ask her if this sort of proposal
interests her. I will stress that royalties, if any, will be delayed and
probably small. If she's agreeable, OK, we shoot and see what we get. If not,
and she probably could get a better offer from one of the small studios, I will
understand.

Yours truly,
Edmund Carpenter
