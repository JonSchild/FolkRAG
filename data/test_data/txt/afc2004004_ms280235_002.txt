TAPE 71. . .MARGARET BARRY. 
The Galway Shawl:  Music 
1) Oranmore in the County Galway, 
One summer's morning in the month of May, 
He espied a colleen, she was tall and handsome, 
And she nearly stole his poor heart away. 

2) She wore no jewels,, no costly diamonds, 
No paint or powder, no none at all, 
She wore a bonnet with red roses on it, 
And o'er her shoulders hung the Galway shawl. 

3) As they kept walking, as they kept talking, 
Till his father's cottage came into view, 
Very soon his mother had a kettle boiling, 
But all he could think of was that Galway shawl. 

4) He played The Blackbird, The Stack of Barley, 
And Rodney's Glory and the Foggy Dew, 
She sang each note like an Irish linnet, 
Till down her cheeks came the tears like dew. 

5) She set out early the next morning, 
To hit the road for Donegal, 
She kissed and hugged him, andthen she left him, 
And she's stole his heart in her Galway shawl.

The Bard of Armagh:  Music 
1) O here's to the list of a poor Irish harper, 
Scorn not the strains of his old withered hands, 
But remember his fingers could once move so sharply, 
To raise the very strains of his dear native land. 

2) At a patten or fair he could twist his shillelagh, 
Or trip through the jig with his brogues bound with straw, 
And all the pretty colleens around him assembled, 
Loved the bold Philip Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 

3) And when Sergeant Death his cold hands will embrace me, 
To lull me to sleep with sweet Erin Go Bragh, 
By the side of his Cathleen, his young wife who pleased him, 
They forgot Philip Brady, the Bard of Armagh.
