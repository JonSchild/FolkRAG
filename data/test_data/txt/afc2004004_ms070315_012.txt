Aug 8.
Arrived in Clarksdale from Dallas
having finished the first volume of Richard
Mahoney.  He seems very like me, - but
so do all heroes of all books, movies, etc..
Some [to my] of these comparisons flatter,
most in modern novels don't.  Richard 
does not.
Louis and I laid our minimum plans.
Began to carry them out.  That evening we
worked with one of the best informants we've 
yet found - a section gang singer about
35.  He gave us all the songs, brought
along a section of rail to tap and sing
with.  Went to see [moon shine]Moontide - 
it was then moonshine.
Aug. 9.
Drove to Will Stark's house on
Barksdale.  A silver grey shanty in the
green cotton patch - his wife & children are all
tawny brown and have silky, kinky
hair.  Will looks like a weary cracker.
Sings the songs of his restless, fiddlers
