Close parallels can be found between rumor and Axis propaganda. Examination 
of the out-put of Station DEBUNK offers the following alignment:

In Minnesota, the rumor was overheard: 
“The Jews put Roosevelt in. 
After the war there will be a 
revolution. Roosevelt won’t be the 
President, and all the Jews will be 
chased out of the country.”

Radio DEBUNK, on April 28, 1942: 
“After the people of the United States 
shall have suffered the burdens of war 
year in and your out; when they see 
the hardships and privations increasing 
with each year; when the number of 
killed and wounded melt into the hundreds 
of thousands and millions, they 
will recall that it was the Jews who 
wanted war. The Jews were not farsighted 
when they started the war campaign 
seven or eight years ago. This 
war is not going to make the world safe 
for the Jews; it is going to do just 
the opposite.”

Minnesota: “Roosevelt has a lot of 
Jew advisors around and they are telling 
him what to do.”

Radio DEBUNK, April 6th: “But would you 
have reelected FDR a third time if he 
had honestly told you what he and his 
Jew crowd of advisors were up to?’ 

Arkansas: “They told me that they 
are going to have 750 Negro cadets 
stationed at this school, and that 
white men are going to do the menial 
jobs. There will be plenty of trouble 
if that is the case. I hear that they 
have been having race riots down at Montgomery, 
Alabama, and that they have 
had to shoot a bunch of Niggers.”

Radio HOME, to North America, July 29, 
1942: LISBON: The United States War 
Department communicates that 769, I 
will repeat the figure, 769 Negro cadets 
have been admitted to an American Officers 
Training School.”

Illinois: “Trouble between the 
United States soldiers and British 
soldiers is common-place.”
