"True Running
Rumors"

Tell all your friends, ladies! that
there is a special sale on 
nylons in the basement
of the Fair: in order to get
them go to 48th and Waubash
and pick up 30 men in
uniform, they may appear to be
cops but they ar'nt, then take
them to the sale of the stockings,
The sign in the pile of stocking
will say 3rd 2nd hand cotton
woven in to mesh, likewise
there will be no one around.
Next scatter the play cops about
the exits and counter without
being seen and then you run to
the other end of the store and
yell "fight" and start triping people and
pulling down the goods on the
table and shelves, that will draw
a crowd then slip away, back
to the play cops that are around
