Mrs. Mary Bonelli
Stafford, Virginia

Dear Mrs.Bonelli:

I am still tied down to Washington, but
I am still coming down to visit you some day
I hope. Thank you for your continual cordiality
and interest. Of course, all recording
activity in the field of folklore will be cut
down considerably during the war. 

Cordially yours,
