Austin 
7-13-1935.

Dear Mr. Struck :
I think you will 
see both Alan and myself
before you sail aug. 13. Alan 
reports 75 Florida records with 
more than 200 songs. My
wife and I will drive 
to Washington where Alan and
OI will put out records in 
shape for use. Thanks for 
your kind letter.
Sincerely yours, 
John A. Lomax
