Ration

They ration my sugar.
my coffee.
my tires.
my gas.
Then they ration my shoes.
And now its my can goods.
And next comes my meat and butter.
But I don't mind it, because
it is going to help the Yanks to
beat the Japs.
There is just one thing that is
important. I hope that the
Goverment doesn't start to
ration War Stamps and Bonds.
If they did I don't know I
would do, not only myself
alone but the whole United 
States
