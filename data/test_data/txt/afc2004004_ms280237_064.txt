Cox:
What will become of Engeland if things go on this way?
There's many a thousand workin' man is starvin' day by day.
He cannot find employment, for bread his children cry,
And hundreds of these [childeeen] childeren, they now lay in
their grave.

Some have money plenty, but still they crave for more,
They will not lend a hand to help the starving poor.
They'll pass you like a dog and on you cast a frown;
That is the way, old Engeland, the working man cast down.

Lomax: Is that all of it?
Cox: That's all I know of that.
Lomax: Tell me where you learned that song.
Cox: Where I learnt it?
Lomax: How did you learn it, yes.
Cox: I learnt it by hearin' 'em sing it.
Lomax: Tell me... I don;t...
Cox: Well, a chap used to come there to the pub, he used to
play a tin whistle, an' that's a song he used to [sigg] sing,
at the Sa --  Bull And I've learnt it.  I - course I weren't
very old then.  I'd only just left school, an' - I don' know
whether I had left.  I used to go up there.  And he [8s] used to -
that was a song [he] I used to sing; I should think that was a song
with eight or nine verses in.  An' I used to like - I heard that.
An' he's dead now.  I learnt by hearin' him sing that, an' that's
all - only one I ever heard sing that.
Lomax: What was his name.
Cox: His name was Wright I - no - I believe that was Wright.  I
aren't quite sure.
Lomax: Was he the composer of it, do you think?
