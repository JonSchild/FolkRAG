Ou Lord!  Lord, I called the woman everything, honey, darlin,
sugar.  Oh my.  Oh-oh.  Chile, I followed that woman everyday.
I nevah shall forgit that. In the cotton patch.  Thought I had
to do that every day.  Go down theah beggin fur that same thing.
I couldn't git enough of it.
     (How old was she?)
     God.  That woman was a woman when I was a chile.  She was
a woman when I was a chile. . .I was twenty at the time.
     (I thought you told me you made love first when you 
were twelve years old.)
     I told you what happened to me when I was  twelve.
I told you I woke up one night an couldn't understand why I was so
wet.  (He also told me of pallet crawling, and a little neighborhood
girl.)  No, I used to try that when I was a kid, but I never could
git mysef straight out in it.  Tried.  But when I did find out what it
was all about, my God, that thing got me worked up all over.  That
thing goes all over you.  Mmm-mmm.  Gits all in yo grine, gits in yo
backbone.  Anybody asts you, you tell em anythang then.  Thass troof.
(He imitates voice of man making love, a high abject cry of
pleasure, almost a scream, like a man in church - his preacher's voice also.) 
Yes. .!  Yes. . .!  If it was to last you two minutes, it would
kill you dead.  Yeah, it'd kill you.  You couldn't stand it.
     (Do the women you make love with have orgasm?)
     (He doesn't understand this term)
     (Do they go out of the world, have a climax of feeling,
something like that which you as a man have?  Do they tremble and 
cry out?)
     I had one eat my shoulder up one time.  When I started to
discharge she grabbed me an go to bitin me. . .I don't know what dey
have, but I kno w dey sure has a slobberin fit.  I had one one time,
