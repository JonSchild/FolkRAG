3-Erie Canal


That the Erie Canal men did sing is proved from an old law that
I found in the Library of Albany, New York, assessing a penalty against
passing nightboats, the singing of whose crews disturbed the sleep-loving
burghers of that city with some such raucous refrain as-

Drop a tear for Bigfoot Sal,
The best damn cook on the Erie Canal,
She aimed at Heaven but she went to Hell,
Fifteen years on the Erie Canal.

Up and down the Canal I went one summer, hoping to find more
folksong treasures. Alas! the pioneer boatmen had died or drifted West.
Only fragments fell into my ballad net. One again speaks touchingly of
the cook on a canal boat;

Our cook she's a daisy and dead stuck on me,
Has fiery red hair and she's sweet sixty-three;
Though sun-burned and freckled, a daisy you bet;
And we use her at night for a headlight on deck.
