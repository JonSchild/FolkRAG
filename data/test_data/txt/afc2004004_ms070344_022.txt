# Nobody works very hard.  First that's
one for drinking.  Next sociability.
There is no murder - hardley any
violence.  The church & the father
rule - against everything but a steady
consumption of alcohol, a [?]
[?] for everyone, and a muddled
head result the younger people
are leaving Ireland in droves. 
Emigration is the country's
biggest problem. Life in rural
too dull for them.

In Dublin the lid is thoroughly
on.  Two communists [?] into
movie theatre for distributing Stock - 
holm peace petition - no one has
a good word for Joyce.

Story - mother [?] [?] in
big department store - aren't you
worried - No; he can't get
off the island ...
