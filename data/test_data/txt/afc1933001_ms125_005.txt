Dear Mr. Clarke:
Mr. Alan Lomax, of our staff, has called my attention to the
fact that the sample records which were sent to Mr. Philip L.
Miller for possible inclusion in the College Music Set, are now
in your possession. Since I hope to be in New York the weekend
of September 11-12, I should like very much to discuss this and
related matters with you at that time. Can you take lunch or
have dinner with me on either of these days,
Very sincerely yours,
Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
