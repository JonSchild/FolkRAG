(How will this begin, Rev. Davis?)
It's gon be begin wid love. Wid charity. That'll be the beginnin of it.
(Will the sinners and the cruel people live in this new world?)
They will come back heah an give an account of the deeds that they have did. An then they have to meet the second death. The penalty what God will put upon them for their sins. They'll be burnt into ashes. They shall burn as long as Hell be burnin. As long as there's one grain of sand upon the topside the earth. The world will be burnin. As long as there's one grain of sand upon the topside the earth, Hell will be burnin. But for the Christian, second death will have no power. Meanness shall die again. We don't have to die but one time.
(What will happen to lynchers? Some call themselves Christians?)
The Bible says that every murderer shall have his part. An everything that you ever did shall come up in judgement. In the Reseurection.  Whatever their occupation was then, it will be again on the night of the Reserection. They'll be all night wid their guns and rifles, shootin down one anothah. Come up angry as everything.
(Do you believe that there's any land on earth today where Negroes are not discrimated against?)
I don't know whether there is or no. Aftah you leave heah, I don't know whether there is or no.
(Have you ever heard of such a thing?)
Naw. I can jes only talk about what's heah. Can't talk so much about what's heah. Fraid.
