ATTENTION: Mr. Webber.

Dear Miss Blackburn:

I am enclosing herewith my rumor report due October 10th.
I cannot always conform with the form set forth in your
memorandum of October 1st.

Reports of specific types should be allotted more time,
especially when we have other reports to work on at the same
time. I can substantiate, however, that the rumors I am
turning in come from reliable parties.

                                                       Yours very truly,

                                               
                                                        E. Leigh Stevens
                                                        Field Representative
                                                        Bureau Of Public Inquiries
