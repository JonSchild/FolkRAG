Mr. Melvin C. Oathout,

Fulton, N.Y.
Dear Mr. Oathout:
Mr. Lomax has referred your letter of June 28 to
me for reply.
We should be very glad to receive the bibliography
of jazz literature which you have just compiled. If it
supplements the references in our catalog to any extent,
we shall place it at the disposal of our readers for
reference purposes. If it merely duplicates the cards
already in our catalog, we shall return it to you so
that you can make better disposition of it.
Permit me to thank you for the interest in our work
displayed by your kind offer.
Very truly yours,
Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
