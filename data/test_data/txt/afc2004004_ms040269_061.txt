Dear Mrs. Persad,
   Thank you for your very interesting song.  It may 
well be that I will use it in the book I am compiling at the 
moment.  You might like to know of a neighbour of your's in 
Hyde, Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy Miller, who are respectively ballad 
singer and dancer, and are very talented and interested in 
collecting.  Their address is Oak Cottage, Higham Lane, Hyde, 
Cheshire.
   As regards your question
1.   You can obtain from any of the large book stores "Folk Songs 
of the USA", "American Ballads and Folk Songs", "Our Singing 
Country" by Lomax.
2.   Mary Macpherson of the BBC Glasgow Office can put you in touch 
with a Miss Jean (?) who plays the clasarch.
3.   A good deal has been done with the Trinidad songs, but I am 
sure much remains to be done.  I believe the best book on the
folk-lore has been written by Melville Herkaolis, N.W.University, 
Everstan.  I am sure if you write to him he will tell you 
about books and perhaps suggest what would be worth while 
collecting.
      Yours sincerely,
      Alan Lomax

Mrs. Avis M. Persad,
225 Dowson Road,
Hyde,
Cheshire.
