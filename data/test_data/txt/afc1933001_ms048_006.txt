neither score have you any weighty 
matters to discuss with the Librarian.
What I wished to know from you, 
especially , was whether the machines
for re-recording were
in workable shape. I can 
run 'em if they are

Acting on the favorable 
tome of your letter I am 
coming on to Washington with 
Miss Terrill and my charming
young daughter, Miss Brown, to 
get the music I need from 
the records I have here and 
from thise in the Library. All I 
want you to do now is to 
see that the machines are in 
running condition. The copies 
Alan made for me have
proved satisfactory for Mrs. Seeger.
Wire me here in case you 
find the machines unusuable.
Sincerely, JohnA. Lomax
