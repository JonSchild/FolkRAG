(The next item Mr. Mangham presented for my inspection was a scrap
book of the Harmony Club.)
This is all of our programs since 1914. The older book has been lost.
These is here have been given since I've living in this house. The other one
was lost in moving. My wife probably threw it away. You know women don't value
these things. They just look like junk to them.
