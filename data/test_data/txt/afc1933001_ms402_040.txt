Lightnin' flashin', thunder roll
Make me study 'bout my po' soul
Caint you lib humble? Praise King Jesus.
De lightnin' and de flashin'
De lightnin' and de flashin'
De lightnin' and de flashin'
Jesus set poor sinners free.
I can't stand de fire
I can't stand de fire
I can't stand de fire
Jesus set poor sinners free.
De green trees a-flamin'
De green trees a-flamin'
De green trees a-flamin'
Jesus set poor sinners free.
Oh, I was lost in de wilderness,
Oh, I was lost in de wilderness,
Oh, I was lost in de wilderness,
King Jesys hand me de candle down.
The Negro is fond of singing songs about death:
Sinner-man lay sick in bed
Death come a-knockin' at de do'
Says he, "Come in doctor, go 'way death,
I ain't ready to go".
Now wasn't dem hard times
Tribulations, Lord.
Now wasn't dem hard times?
I'se bound to leave dis world.
Oh, de messenger ob def
Comes a-knockin' at my do'
But he comes fo' to carry me home
But he comes fo' to carry me home.
You may carry me way
To de ol' bone ya'd
But you comes fo' to carry me home
But you comes fo' to carry me home.
Christian man, says he, lay sick in bed,
Death comes a-knockin' at de do'
"Come on death, go 'way doctor,
I'meready to go,
I'se ready to go.
