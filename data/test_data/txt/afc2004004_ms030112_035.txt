GARY:
No I didn't I married after I left. Got me a little
2 x 4 place. We stayed there a year, then we started out a
travelin. Got up to Norfolk Va., and I was making over $300
a week just standing on the street playing guitar.
LARRY:
At 20 years old.
GARY:
Yeah. They busy running me everywhere. So the police
came up to me one time says I hate to stop this, you do play
good music but they don't like you playing on the streets.
Aonother fella come up and says Take that thing, get offa the
streets get the hell out of here so and so and so and so. Didn't
care how he talked to you. All that happened.
LARRY:
So like, then at 20 years old or so you had completely
figured your style out.
GARY:
Yeah , I [had] completed my style out. So I kept on till I got [**]
here. What I'm trying to tell you now is a really good point about
the thing. You starting out in your life you, if you don't want
to see anything, [if you] you know you can just stop. If you don't
want to have anything don't start. CAuse everything is just gonna
confront you when you start. There ain't no use crying about it
if you ain't willing to meet it go back home. Did you hear what
I said Mister[?]
LIONEL:
I heard you man, and your right too.
