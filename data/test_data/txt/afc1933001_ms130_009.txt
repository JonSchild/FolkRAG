Dear Mr. Brewster:

I very much appreciate your invitation to talk at the 
April meeting of the Hoosier Folklore Society and it is 
quite possible that I may be able to come.  It is important, 
however, that such a trip should mean the addition of records 
to the Archive of American Folk-Song.

You have formerly expressed an interest in helping the 
Archive record the folk songs of Indiana, and I should like 
to know whether you might be able to give any of your time 
to this project in April.  Would it be possible for me to 
visit at that time the informants from whom you collected 
material?  If so, can you estimate for me the number of songs 
I might be able to obtain from them?  Does the Hoosier Folklore 
Society have contacts in Vincennes or other Indianan communities 
where French folk ways are still alive?  Are there songs 
to be found in these communities?

I hope you will be able to excuse this rather inquisitorial 
letter, but it is part of the procedure for me to make a forecast 
of field trips before I set out on them.  If I've been a 
negligent correspondent in the past, it has been because I have 
had more work than I could possibly do, and I'll try not to sin 
in that direction again.

Sincerely yours,

AL:ed
