BLACK JACK DAVY 

One morning I called on the Gant family at ten o'clock. Mrs. 
Gant met me at the door dressed in her early morning wrapper. 
"The children are all asleep," she whispered apologetically, 
"an haven't gone to school today. Last night we all go to singing 
and dancing. We didn't go to bed until two o'clock this morning. 
The children stayed up, too, so I'm letting the whole bunch sleep 
until dinnertime." 
The Gants were east Texas people from the sandy, square-dancing, 
razorback country that stretches into Arkansas, through northern Louis- 
iana, Mississippi, and Alabama to the mountains. The Gants had fol- 
lowed cotton into Oklahoma, then down into the Panhandle and, in 
drought and years of bad prices, had moved on. In Oklahoma they 
learned new songs, new Gants were born, and some of the young ones 
began to pick the guitar. In the Panhandle they learned cowboy songs, 
the oldest daughter was married and had her first baby, and Adoniron 
began to pick the guitar. Dispossessed again, they came to Austin, 
the capital, looking for something to do. When there were no more 
jobs, they got a little food from the Relief and lived in a shack 
on the banks of the Colorado River. 
The Gants were from the square-dancing, ballad-singing country, 
and on Saturdays there was alsays a dance at their house. On other 
week nights some of the boys would drop in to pick Ether's guitar, 
and there would be singing on the porch. 
"Working on the highway, earning three dollars a day."
