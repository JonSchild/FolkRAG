LITTLE BIT O' WHOOPEE

Tune--There'll Be A Hot Time In The
Old Town Tonight

When you get the farmer unionized,
When you get the women organized,
When you get our hearts all vitalized,
There'll be a hot time on the old farm tonight
-----My Baby.

When you get two dollars for your wheat,
Stop that bunch that always wants to cheat,
When the race gets all it wants to eat,
There'll be a hot time on the old farm tonight.
-----My Baby.

When you get the gambler on the run,
When you know the speculator's done,
Won't the farmer have his share of fun?
There'll be a hot time on the old farm tonight.
-----My Baby.

When you get one dollar for your corn,
Pay your debts and never feel forlorn,
Raise your chest and blow your brand new horn,
There'll be a hot time on the old farm tonight.
-----My Baby.

When you win the cause of common folks,
Bury deep those big financial jokes,
Throw away those heavy galling yokes,
There'll be a hot time on the old farm tonight.
-----My Baby.

When you hear old Wall Street whine and cry,
Then you know a funeral passes by
Won't we heave an awful human sigh?
There'll be a hot time on the old farm tonight.


"God must like the common people or he would not
have made so many of them."
--LINCOLN

Taking everything gratefully and looking forward
to nothing better, is what makes peasantry.
