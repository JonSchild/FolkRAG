Rumors may expose information gaps which need to be filled - not by rumor-
denials but by intensive information programs. If there are a flock of
rumors in a community about Lend Lease, for example, the most effective
way of handling such rumors might be to launch an information campaign
on Lend Lease - feature stories, editorials, Sunday articles, etc.

Sometimes an information gap cannot be filled temporarily, because 
of military security. When a warship is in an American harbor,
for example, that fact cannot be published without aiding the enemy -
even though the ship and its sailors are visible to many people in the 
port area. Extravagant rumors about the ship, or the crew, or the cargo
may arise from such a situation. But these rumors would not spread unless
people repeated what they saw or what they heard. The Office of War Information 
is in possession of ample evidence that the enemy, or his agents, 
often does not know what hundreds of Americans do know about a  given war 
port or war plant; the repetition of facts or rumors, in such circumstances,
often makes it easier for the enemy to find out what he did not know, or
simply suspected.

However, as a rule, the presence of rumors indicates lack of
satisfactory knowledge about phases of the war effort. The rumors analyzed
by the Office of War Information fall into five general classes:

(a)  By far the greatest number may be called "hate rumors"; 
they express prejudice, animosity, or hostility for groups
other than the enemy.

(b)  The second group may be classified as "anxiety rumors." 
They reflect uneasiness or fear and commonly take the form 
of unfounded reports of Allied disaster or weakness, or of 
overwhelming enemy strength.

(c).  A third group, classifiable as "escape rumors" reflect,
in the main, wishful thinking about the progress and duration 
of the war.
