Lee Roy Milam
A Hero of World War II
Corp. Barney Ross was a boxer. he was light weight champion
of the world. He was a good boxer. The skill he had was some
think like Henry Armstrong's. The quick movement of his body
and legs was known through out the United States & Europe. But
ring fighting was not enough for him to take; he wanted
to fight in the biggest ring in the world; that is, to fight the
Japs. So he got into the Marines. His wish came true; he was sent
some where in the Pacific. The fight was mad but he didn't mind
because he [was] had been in worse fights than what the Japs can give.
He was wounded but he didn't mind he was in a bomb
[Cortu?] three of his buddies were wounded. To keep the Japs back
they threw twenty-two hand frenades and shot 280 rounds of
Rifle fire and killed 22 Japs.
