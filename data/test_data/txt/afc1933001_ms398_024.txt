Casey Jones
(et al)

Early

Late at night, hungry and tired, I leaned out of the car window
as the rain came into De[nn]ming, New Mexico, over the dusty route of
the Southern Pacific Railroad from El Paso; my friend, Ray Bedichek,
met meat the train steps, with his friendly airedale dog, Hobo--
a dog whose devotion had changed the entire course of "Bedi's"
life.

Bedi was a college friend, at that time editor of the De[nn]ming 
paper, secretary of the De[nn]ming Chamber of Commerce, and the efficient
holder of several other jobs that I have forgotten about. I
was hunting the tunes of Cowboy Songs and the ballads of the wild,
wild West.

"Come over to the back room of the --XIOU8 XIOU8 (extenuate) saloon,"
said Bedi. "They serve good steaks there and you may hear some singing."
(I carried a very old-fashioned and crude sound-recording
machine which wound up with a spring.) As we ate, an impromptu 
quartette m de up of the bartender, a hobo( a graduate of Oxford
University), a freight brakeman just off his run from Lordsbury,
and a cowboy from the Diamond A (Hearst) Ranch, sand Casey Jones
with so many sad quavers that Hobo howled mournfully as the song
ended.

Too perfect for a real ballad I though, though I have since
found out that a Negro round house worker at Canton, Mississippi,
[and that it] has some claim [as a product.] to its authority

Through the Diamond A Cowboy I got an invitation to visit the
Hearst Ranch about half way between Denning and Silver City, where
Billy the Kid added several notches to the handle of his Colt revolver.
