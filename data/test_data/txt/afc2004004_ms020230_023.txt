the jug in there, back a there.  An' Richard tol' me, said, "Look 
what I got."
         I seen it; I said, "Well!"  There was the Ol' Sumonion, [an']
there what we had the home-brew an' there was the 'shine.   So. . .
         An' then we began ta start ta eatin' an' drinkin', eatin' an' 
drinkin'.   So?   From house-- from room ta room, in that apartment 
house, like.   After a while I done tol' [Gladys] Clara, "Sumpin's. . ."  
Ah, [Ya know,] git large ya know; ya git larger 'an what you're supposed 
to be.  Said, "Clara, let's go have our pitchur made an' sen' it 
back to Georgia."
         "All right.  All right."
         Me an' Clara.  Pulled up to have our pitchur made.  On our 
way goin', I said, "Let's stop [an'] by an' see Mercer."  That's the 
landlord I used ta live with.   An' ah, she's very nice; Nassau 
woman.
         I stopped in there to see her, an' she was sittin' up there 
combin' her hair.  An' so we made merry with 'er an' I had a lil' 
package for 'er.  An' ah we started out.  An' Mercer say, "Come 'ere; 
I wanta show ya sumpin'."
         I went back in there, what she want.   She set up.  She said, 
"Ya got to have a drink before ya leave."  That was gin.  So. . . 
hah, so there ya go wit' ya moonshine, ya Sumonion, ya home-brew, 
ya gin.   That's fo'.  An' as I said, I never liked water -- I 
liked water behind the whiskey, or either [a lil']  juice behin' it, 
but not with it, when I was drinkin'.   I don' like nothin' with 
it, you know, in it.  You know, decoratin' it.   Yeah, but, so, anyhow...
