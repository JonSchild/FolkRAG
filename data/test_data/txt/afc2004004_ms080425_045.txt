himself.  And Americans took this burden first.  This is what made
their faces so funny, this is why they had to have a strong and
rigid morality; that's what made it possible for them to go as 
individuals, and in small groups [of course,] across the Appalachians and to the unknown and
to survive as human beings, and establish quiet orderly communities
as single family.   They could carry the whole culture on their 
shoulders.   This was the first group of people who had ever done
this before in our history.    West Europeans had their pagan festivals,
they had their Christmas, they had their Easter, they had all
sorts of community festivities but these people were shawn of all
that, and they had just the relationship to their own life purpose
and to God and that end is so clear in its own.  I think that is part
of the tragic character of the song.   The individual's sense that he
is totally responsible for his destiny.   All the people that I
have seen here have that burden and that privilege. . . that is one of
the things that make man so happy. . .like a real man; and our ancestors
were men and could not just face danger but they [get] faced God without an
intervening religious structure within an established church to help
them and I think that is in this thing too.   I don't know.   Jackson
said this [too] you know. I think he was the first to person that saw it.
I may ask you. . .I haven't even thought of talking for a couple of
days.   I don't think I am spoiling the conversation.   Do you think . . .

No, this is great.

Do you?

I think that's true.   And you've said it very well.

Very well indeed.

I think that the results of all these factors that we have been 
talking about, the fact that these people are well charged with
Welsh musical styles and others are really Irish with the Irish bla--
the Irish ability to embellish and others. . .four square singers from
                         and others---Cornish men with the box key, sweet
harmonies of southern England;    all these things are blended into
the sacred harp singing book and singing fraternity.   They have put
together the whole. . .Britain, you know, Britain is a culture of many
cultures.   All those cultures are welded together in the Appalachians,
