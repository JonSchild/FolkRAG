The Stoutest Man in the Forty-Twa.

1) Behold I am a soldier bold and only twenty five year old,
And a braver warrior never was seen
Frae Inverness to Gretna Green.
When I was young me father said he would put me to a decent 
trade,
But I didna like that job at all, so I went and joined the 42.

2  Chorus:
The wind may blow and the cock may crow,
The rain may rain and the snow may snow,
But you willna break in Jock McGraw,
He's the stoutest man in the 42.

2) The seargeant when he 'listed me, he winked his eye and then 
says he,
"A man like you so stout an tall'll never be killed by a cannon-ball,"
The Captain then, when he come round, he looked me up and he 
looked me down,
Then turning to the sergeant, "O you scamp, you've blasted 
the bleach field out on tramp!"
(Cho.)

3) At our last fecht across the sea, the general he sends after 
me,
When I got there and my big gun, of course, the battle it was 
won.
The enemy all run awa', they feared the legs of Jock McGraw,
A man like me, sae tall and neat, you ken yoursel' he would 
never be beat.
(Cho.)

4) The King then held a grand review, we numbered a thousand and 
sixty-two,
The kiltie lads come marchin' past, and Jock McGraw come 
marching last.
The royal party grabbed their sticks, and I'll be gone to 
stretch their necks,
Cries the king to the colonel, "Upon my soul, I took that 
man for a telegraph pole!" (CHO.)
