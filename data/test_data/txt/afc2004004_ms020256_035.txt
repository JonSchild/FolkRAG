went back to 'er house.  So no after that.  Never heard no mo'

AL:  You say fifty-fifty, they were fifty-fifty...?
BJ:  Up an' down together.  That's right.  They-- If one would 
go to Savannah, the other go to Atlanta, they go together an'

AL:  Did MacNamarra live out there with Miss Melissa?
BJ: No, no.  He used to go out there.  He didn't live there.
AL:  He'd just visit?
BJ:  That's right.  Just visit.  When he got ready, day or night.

chillun, when, for, for Christmas or Easter?  He carry the chillun
to the store an' tell 'em to dress 'em up.  An' he tol' 'em to 
go in his name, an' they does.  His chillun.  (Cont bottom p. 34)
