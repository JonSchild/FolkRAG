[*17.03.15.00*]  A  My - ah, this was sung by ah - to me by a

[*17.04.26.00*]  Ah. . .The event - final event is truly
dreadful, with the ah small truck mines that
have come, tearing away at small veins and
turning the whole population into exploiters
of their own terrain, and finally the big
companies with the strip mining that's simply

on television.  They're - they've made laws to
try to stop strip mining, but, ah, it's not
ah been restrained, it's going on more
vigorously than ever before, and the reason
is that the local legislators - 'latures -
will not back their own people in defence of
their own land.
