Dear Alan:

I am very sorry that you have been ill.

Shortly after I saw you in New York, I went down to hear the 
Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet at Cafe Society.    I mentioned 
the chain gang song idea to the leader whose comment was that 
he really didn't know anything about those songs.

If I could meet you some time in New York, we might work out 
recording plans and I could relieve you entirely of the 
financial end of the thing if you would introduce me to 
Leadbelly.

The list of folk song records which you sent in seems a very 
large batch to send to Texas to have your father go over to 
select a half dozen records for the album.    Don't you think 
it would be possible to boil this down to about 100 records 
for this purpose?

I hope you are feeling much better and that we can soon get 
together.

Sincerely yours,

[*R. P. Wetherald*]
