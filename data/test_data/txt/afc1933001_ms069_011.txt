P.S/ Miss Terrill, some time when your family is behaving and you
have time hanging heavy ----- if you will do it on a business 
basis, would you be interested in taking a red pencil in hand 
and criticiaing and helping me make sojmething that will sell?
Think it over .Will talk when you come.

I had a nice letter from Mr.Dashiel. Thank you ,Big Boss!

Our love always to two kindred spirits, 
who the babies and I can understand----G.W.C
