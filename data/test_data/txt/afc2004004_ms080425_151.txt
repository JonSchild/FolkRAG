Tape:  Sacred Harp Interviews  #246 cont.     4

AL:  Tell me about how you met your wife. You met your
wife at a singing, didnt you?
Chester:  I grew up in the same community my wife grew up in.
She was just a little girl to me til I was about 20 year
old, and I fell in love with that little girl. And she
accepted my plea to marry her.
AL:  Did you all go to singings together?
Chester:  Not verymuch.  In the community we would, but we
didn't go to singings together a whole lot while we were
young.
AL:  And tell me about that time the teacher caught that boy
passing a note to that girl, gave him such a hard time, remember?
Chester:  Oh yeah. Well, that was in my early schooling
days. That was a schoolhouse which was a churchouse, but
they had the school in this church house. It was just
one large room. And this teacher, he caught this note that
he wrote to this girl, and it didn't sound too good, so
after he done with the books, he sat down and talked to that
boy a long time. He was a great big fellow, strong. So after
talking to him a while, he said "You great big slab sided rascal
you, I'm gonna whup you." And he whupped him with I'd say
a 4 or 5 hickory whip, about 4 or 5 foot long. And he wore
that thing down til it wasn't no long than my arm . . . . .
