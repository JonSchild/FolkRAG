The Blantyre Explosion - Bob Holland.

1) By Clyde's bonny hanks as I sadly did wander Among the pit heaps as evening drew high.
I spied a fair maiden all dressed in deep mourning, A-weeping and wailing with many a sigh.

2) I stepped up beside her and thus I addressed her, "Pray tell me, fair maiden, of your trouble and pain/"  Sobbing and sighing, at last she made answer, "Johnny Murphy, kind sir, was my true lover's name."

3) Twenty-one years of age, full of youth and good-looking, To work at the mines of High Blantyre he came.  The wedding was fixed, all the guests were invited.  That calm, summer evening, young Johnny was slain.

4) When the explosion was heard all the women and children With pale anxious faces they haste to the mine.  When the truth was made known, the hills rang with  mourning, Three-hundred-and-ten young miners were slain.

5) Now husbands and wives and sweethearts and brothers That Blantyre Explosion they'll never forget.  And all you young miners who've heard my sad story, Shed a tear for the victims who're laid to their rest.

What the Winer Does for You:- Mrs Cosgrave.

It's me that keeps your fire going,
It's me that gi'es ye light.
I dig the coal that keeps ye warm in a cold, cold winter night.
My face it may be dirty,
But my heart is warm and true,
When you're sitting by your fireside
Just think of what the miner's done for you.

I used to hear my dad sing that.  He'd come in at nights with a pint or two in him.
