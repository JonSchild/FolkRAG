[the west for his health.  He went out to Denver and did one of the worst
things he ever did.  A fellow up at Tunica had killed a white man and gotten
away, and had been living in Denver for twenty years.  Eugene went out there
and saw him and wrote back here and reported him.  They brought him back to 
Jackson, and he committed suicide in the jail in Jackson.  He knew if they
brought him back to Tunica they would lynch him.  Eugene was the cause of
Charlie Banks' leaving Mound Bayou.  When Eugene went down there he joined 
the opposition and began fighting Banks.  Bank's wife, being Eugene's sister, 
took his side, and Banks decided that he would just get out.  He sold
out down there and went over here in Arkansas and bought a thousand acres of
land and about that time the depression came, and he was just about broke
when he died.  Green was the successor to Banks and inherited his fight with
Booze.  I remember I was there one year for their founders day and Charlie
Banks called on one of the old citizens to speak.  He started, hollowing,
"Where's Green? Where's Green?"  I thought he was crazy, but later I discovered 
that Charlie had put him up to it.  Booze had put Mr. Montgomery's
picture on the platform, and this old man was calling for Green's picture.]
Around this time everything was on the other side of the railroad
tracks -- colored and white.  I don't think there was anything of a business
kind over here but Eugene's store and a saloon run by old man Nelson Jones.
This side of the track was called New Worl[d].  Nothing was over here but saloons,
hock joints, and the red light district.  After they closed the red light district 
and laid this out in lots people began to buy over here.  All this and 
up there where you live, on Paul Edwards, was fields.
