SUGGESTIONS FOR SINGING GAMES

Singing games are "story plays" put to music.
New ones should always be introduced by a story and the "story
emphasized as the "dramatic actions" are played. For example:

"Oats-Peas-Beans" - 
A story of a farmer who planted his farm
in the spring and, his crops yielding him such
great returns, he decides he needs a wife to help
him with his work and make him happier.

The game is played in several countries.

Hints in teaching:
1. Know the words.
2. Know the tune.
3. Encourage dramatic action. 
4. Choose leaders to direct groups in reviewing games.
5. Have a period once a week to review all singing games.

Let a different group perform each game and 
let judges decide which group did the best
using first three hints from above as a
basis for judging.

6. In the games of the various nations try to
teach the game as it would be played by the
natives of those countries.

For example: "Annie Goes to the Cabbage Field."
Get the girl's coquettishness into the action
as well as the boy's sauciness. The play will
be very gay and the actions precise and vigorous.
