In 1845 a colored colony came to Michigan from Logan county,
Ohio. It was composed of Harvey Wade, Ensom Tare, Nathanial Boon,
Turner Bird, Crawford Bird, K. Artist, and Harrison Ash. These

About this time a planter, Sampson Saunders by name, died at
his home in Cabul county, Virginia. At his death he liberated his
slaves and left $15,000 to buy farms for them in some free state.
The peculiar advantages of Calvin township made it an ideal place

except a small sum, with which a small tract had been bought in
Porter township.

These two colonies were the nucleus around which the Calvin
community was built up, a whole township preponderately colored in
the midst of white settlers. It has kept its character for two or
