BJ  R. 2  p. 4
[* 4*]
BJ: Oh [dear] yeah Lord.  I woundn't a-ever knowed. . . and I didn't like it so I felt like ___ [?] I 'member one
day I was goin' to the spring, and they was talkin' and Lulu was tellin', she say, "You
know," says ah, [you know] Uncle Roanie was goin' by, --  that's Uncle
John's, that's my father's brother, too -- [Tom] [*(Uncle Tump - correction)*] Tump -- was goin' by.
And I seen Uncle Tump and they - And Lulu say, "You know, Mister Jimmie ain't your father; Mister
Tump' [(?)] brother your father."  She must've thought they hadn't told
me or somethin'.  She had heard it, herself. And so I said, "I know it.
But Papa my father."  I'll never forget it, y'know, because he was
one [dream (?)] raised me.  I say, "I know it, but Papa my father."  And they
kept that up a long time,. I'd never play with anybody. There Papa is my father I know [you] he 
ain't m[y] me Papa, but Papa's is my [father] Papa. We didn't know nothin' about
no "daddy". [* (the word)*]  All we know was fathers and papas... [* I remember this [cause] good *] [I] We was gettin' water
from the spring.  I didn't want them to tell me that [be]cause I loved
[my] the papa. I know that Papa was my Papa. I [learn] remember that so well and so that [way] why  if they had never told me, “I'm glad you told me when I was young.”
AL: Did you ever feel reproachful or angry at your mother for havin'
you before she was married.
BJ: Um-um
AL: [Did it] That didn't ever [*B. Um-um*] make you feel. . .
B.  Um um
BJ:  I never felt. . . sh--- nothin' bout it.
[* father + step-father*]
AL: Shame[ful]ed...
BJ:  [Y'mean] I guess you mean shame[d] [no,] but I never felt nothin' like that.  You know,
even since I've been up grown enough to understand [it,] it that there's a heap
about [it] that it didn't have to be you know.  It ain't likely [--] (sigh) well, I'll 
give it to you this way:  I'm born at where God want me to be born
at.   And I'm who he want me to be.  'Cause I 'member me tellin' Mama
one time, Mister Bunk Walker, he used to give me more candy and stuff.
And every Christmas they bring me pretty things, the Walker Family, --
Mama was raised with them, and they loved Mama well, and they just
give me things, y'know, like that and so -- and I told Mama one day I wanted Mr. 
Bunk [*(colored)*] for my father, [I told Mama that] I wish he was my Daddy   And Mama said, " If  Bunk had'a
been your father, you wouldn't a-been who you are."  And so that proach's come to
[taught] me.  I couldn't see how come I couldn't been who I am and then he 
be my father, too; that's what I wanted.  I wanted him to be my daddy
but I wanted to be just who I was.  And so Mama tole me that.  We was standin'
[Un] 'neath the chinaberry tree, [sort of] shellin' peas -- green peas --
and she says, "if Bunk [was] had been your father, you wouldn't  [a-] had been who you are."
But I long time before I realize... comin't to the knowledge and 
understandin' that, sure enough, who your father is, that's who you
