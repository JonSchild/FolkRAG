MEMORANDUM

February 24, 1941

Mr. Archibald MacLeish, Librarian
The Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. MacLeish:

Vance Randolph, author of the best books on
the Ozark's region and one of our most important regional 
writers would put at our disposal his knowledge of
the country and his entire collection, one of the most
important in the United States. If we only had a little
money to help him along with. There are a number of other
cases of this sort throughout the country. If we ever get an
any money, it is through such people, in part, that I want
to work. In the meantime, do you think we'd have a prayer
to one of these here "funds"?
