Dr. E. C. Beck
Central State Teachers COllege
Mount Pleasant, Michigan

Dear Dr. Beck:

I think perhaps you have exagerrated the difficulties
attendent upon the operation of a portable electric recording
machine and I feel sure that with a few days practice
in the field, you would be able to take very successful
records.

It may be possible to send a portable recording machine
and an operator into Mt. Pleasant next spring and
I certainly agree with you that it is important that this
particular piece of recording be done as soon as possible.
At the moment, however, the Archive cannot commit itself
that far in advance, especially since by that time we may
be able to arrange the recording work locally.

It would help considerable if you could estimate just
the number of songs and singers that would be available
next April. And there are various questions which it
would be most helpful for you to answer. First, do all the
singers whom you have located live near Mr. Pleasant or are
they scattered throughout Michigan? How much time do you
estimate it would take to make records of the ballads you
have in your collection? How large a collection of important
folk songs have you accumulated? If the recording
will take more than a week, will you be able to leave your
University duties for that long a time? With this additional
information at hand, we should be able to let you
know by next February or March whether this trip will be
feasible or not.

If you care to have a list of the recordings which
Bill McBride and your other performers made for the Archive,
we should be happy to furnish it along with duplicate records
of three or four of the songs. I hesitate to choose these
records myself since my preferences might not match your needs.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Cordially yours,


Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
