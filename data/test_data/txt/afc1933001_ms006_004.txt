Dear Mr. Lomax:   
I regret very much my delay in answering your letter
of January 24, which reached me at State College; but an
attack of illness, which struck me shortly before your letter
arrived, so "slowed me up" that it was all I could do to
keep my required work going for the rest of the school year.
I neglected everything but schoolwork and my correspondence
with my family.
In the part of country where I have been finding the
material I have, the great bulk of the folksongs are of
British origin - as is the case, I presume, in most early-settled
"singing districts". However, I have recovered quite a
few of the indigenous pieces to which your special study is
directed. A number of them certainly must be quite widely
known, as I see versions of them in most collections that
I chance to look into; and I have no doubt but what you
are acquainted with them all, and perhaps have far better texts
in your collection than any I have been able to recover.
I shall list the native songs in my collection which
seem to be widely known - or, at least, which I personally
have found in collections from different parts of the country.

I think all these pieces are

who can trace them to their sources.
But I know you are well acquainted
with all of them.
