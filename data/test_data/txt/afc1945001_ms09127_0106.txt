"We really build them"
Last week one of our flying forts 
came home with the tail of the ship 
litterly severed from the rest of the 
ship. The ship, although torn to pieces 
by gun fire, came home and made a perfect 
landing, without collasping. The next 
morning someone opened the bombers 
hatch to enter, and the plane fell in half.

"Recognition"
Our great ship builder Kaiser, made 
the suggestion that all of our war workers, 
who are turning out the goods, be given service 
stripes for a reward.

"Keeping Up Morale"
Certain popular orchestra leaders are 
being deffered to keep on playing music 
for the service men and the citizens. They 
were deffered because the government feels 
that they can do more that way than they 
could on the battle field.
