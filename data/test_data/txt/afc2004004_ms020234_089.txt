BJ TAPE 20, p. 86

     An' so she says, ah, "Bessie?"  She was sittin' down there
crochetin' an' wasn't sayin' nothin'.  Says, "Bessie," I answered
her.  She said, "Why is it that colored peoples don't have the
infantile paralysis an' the diptheria I-- as many colored babies
die with it as do white?"
     So I says, " 'S too rich a disease."  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha!  I didn' know what. . .!  Ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  I never will
forgit that!
     She looked at me so hard!  She didn't know (LAUGHTER MIXED
WITH WORDS)  she thought. . .She  thought was real!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!
     But I tol' 'er, ha, I said, "The disease is too rich for po' peoples."
An' I kep' right on goin'.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Hu, ha, ha!  But
that was so funny to me!  I, I laughed afterwards.  I didn'
know what else to say.  It was too rich for us to have; y'all
have it.  Hu, ha, ha, ha!
     But it wasn't that, you know?  Ha, ha, ha!  You knowit
wasn't that, ha, ha, ha!  But I didn't let her. . .
TL:  Why do you reckon it really is?
BJ:  That was jus' like I tol' ya, you know, the mens is weak an'
the woman is weak.  An' the chilren be bo'n weak, that's all.  That's
that's what it is.  It's that yet, today; that's the causin' of it
today.  Most of it, I mean.  Now, sometime, you can come into a
cold or. . .some kind of a cold you can catch, ya know, like that,
go. . .
TL:  Bessie, speaking about that, who do you think is more
strong, poor people or rich people?
BJ:  Ah. . .Why, I think the po' peoples is stronger than the rich.
I mean physical.  You know, in their body.  Yes, that's right,
yeah, physical.
