one woman, an she put him down.  Take him a long time to fin anothah
one.  He may mess around wid some, but I'm talkin bout gittin one
he can pend on.  That's right.  I ain't jokin.  Ef you start, bettah
start wid two engines.
     (What about a woman?  Should she have more than one
man?)
     No.  She ain't got no business wid mo than one man.
A man ain't sposed to have mo than one woman.  You don't have to
have em cause you started with em.  You know what I mean.  I'm
m on tell you what I mean, so you'll know exactly what I mean:
Now, you wouldn't have to do fo me what you'd do fo the othah man.
You understand.  I don't mean you an me.  I'm jes sayin that as a 
par'ble.  You understan what I'm talkin bout?  Well, do othah man
might walk off an leave you.  You h ad done been already chattin
round wid me, talkin, feelin round tryin to find out jes bout
what you think I would do.  You understand?  An uh, he gone, an theah's
a chance fo you to take a fair break at me.  You say, Well, I'm not
hurtin him.  Heah Mr. Davis ovah heah.  I'll talk wid him.  Then
you'll send fo me one night, say, Come ovah heah.  I got sumpin to
tell you.  Well, it might be jes the very thing I wanna hear.
That's the way it is.  You don't wear all yo dresses but you keep
em all clean.  A man may walk out into some barb-wire, an git a split in his pants,
an have to walk right back into the house and pull that off.  Ain't
that right?  Yeah.  You ain't got to have em all jes cause they're --
they're round.  You see?  Be impossible fo you to have em all, cause
every one of em commenced to callin fo the same thang, you wouldn't 
be able to give it.  An I know ef twould be me, I'd make it my
business to come in when the othah men come in, an call for the same thing
an I know good an well
