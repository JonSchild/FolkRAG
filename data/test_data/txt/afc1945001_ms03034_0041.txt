FBMS reports

When Knapp, of the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety,
was here he requested copies of the FBMS reports. I said he would have
to consult you about them. In case he didn't, I am reminding you of
his request and if you approve will prepare a letter to the FBMS
suggesting that a copy be sent him.
