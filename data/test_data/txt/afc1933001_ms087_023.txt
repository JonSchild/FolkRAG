We're smart as can be,
my roomie 'n' me,
We're puttin' our names
In the CORN HUSKIN' BEE.

Shhhhh!

In our hall, we have found,
They keep quieting us down,
So we're goin' to where
They give prizes for sound.

Hog callin' is choice
Fer my frustrated voice.
An' that husband callin's
A cause to rejoice!

Roomie's wearin' long pants
'Cause we want to dance.
As my "date" for that night
No one else stands a chance.

Now it'd be just our fate
To enter too late
And miss this event --
So we don't think we'll wait.

AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU ....
