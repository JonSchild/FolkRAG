8.

These are the rats
Millowners--Banker-
Landlord--Boss,
Greedy and ruthless
Armed with force.

These are the rats, 
Swelled with greed,
Who steal the trail 
And ravage the forest;
Who waste the ore
And corner the grain;
Who defile the cloth
That fashions the dream
That grows in the house that Jack built.

HOW CAN JACK
BE RID OF RATS?

This is the way
The only way
This is the way-
Unite the Jack
Who breaks the trail
With the Jack
who lays the road.
Unite the Jack
Who hews the forest
With the Jack
Who grows the grain
With the Jack
Who weaves the cloth

[**Mis?ints here**]

For united the Jacks
Can build a trap,
Can catch the rats
That spoil the dream
That grows in the house that Jack built.
