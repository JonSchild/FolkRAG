preparing a careful record of what passes,   (As part of a counteraction 
program, the possibilities of recruiting a rumor monger
into the project in order to be in a position  to bridle his tongue 
should not be overlooked.)   Reliability, responsibility, a
willingness to work anonymously, a willingness to do routine tasks,
an understanding of the importance of following directions, the
ability to remember what is heard, all are part of the personal
qualifications necessary for a good rumor reporter.

Rumors travel along social networks.  It is important,
therefore, that reporters be drawn from all networks of the community 
or from people who are in a position to observe such
segments.  In order to keep track of rumors among Negroes, it
would be important to have Negro rumor reporters.  However, in
order to keep track of rumors among some of the wealthier circles,
members of the hotel workers and bartenders and waiters unions

rumor is a specific type of information, ordinarily transmitted
by word of mouth.  Ideally, a rumor has three major aspects:  (1)

of a private [*everybody knows etc.*], reliable source of information, one not
available to the general public.  (3) it has a specific rather than
a general reference.  These three features distinguish rumors from
all other forms of orally transmitted materials.  It is often difficult 
to get a clear-cut expression in just so many words of all
three phases of the rumor characteristics, but if one or two features
are clearly present and the other implied, then the communication
should be considered a rumor.
