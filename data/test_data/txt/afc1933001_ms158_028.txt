HUGH HODGSON, DIRECTOR
Dear Mr. Spivacke:-
Thanks you for your
interest in McGarrity. He has
accepted a good position in south
Georgia, but still has his heart
set on working for you in Washington.
I have not heard
from Mr Lomax [*Georgia [F-S?] Archive*]. I am very keen
about this work.
We are motoring north
to take our daughter to camp.
Will you be in Washington any
time this summer?
Sincerely,
Hugh Hodgson
