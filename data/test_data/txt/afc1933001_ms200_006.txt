Dear Rae:
 Can you help me in the following ways?

1) Arthur Alberts tells me he has deposited copies of his
African tapes with you.  He is going to let me copy his originals
but he has no list of the contents and thinks he left one with
his tapes at the Library.  If this be so, could you have it
Zeroxed and send it to me with a bill immediately so that we can
make sense out of choosing items from his tapes.

2) Henrietta Yurchenko is permitting me to code her Mexican
stuff; however, she does not have it all and I would like to know
whether her acetates are in shape for duplication by the Recording
Laboratory.  I am especially interested in Guatemalan material
from the Quiche and Ixil peoples.  She tells me that the identifications
are on the envelopes of the boxes.  I would like to 
know what it would cost me to get this material copied and if 
there are as many as ten songs per group (Guatemala).

How are you all?  It's getting hot here.

All the best,
Alan Lomax
