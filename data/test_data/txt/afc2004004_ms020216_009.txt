BJ TAPE 3,  p. 7

[*REVERTS TO SIN*]

BJ:     Well, I went back with the rest of 'em, jus' what was doin' 
the same thing they had been doin', a little later on.  An' jes' -- 
you know how it is to do -- jes' go out an' go back dancin', go 
back drinkin' an' everything else you was doin', you know. So, 
tha's jus' -- tha's the way aroun'.   If I'd a-been real 
in it, see, I'd a-been washed in it [from sin]; I'd a-been born again. I 
couldn't a-went  back where I come from.  You know, no chile what 
born again go back where he from, where he came from.  He, he may 
get nasty and wall around an' moth' an' fath' say, "I don' wan' 
'im," but he ain' goin' back where he come from.  Ya see?
An' what I mean by that is, when the Lawd change you an' 
give you grace, He don't take it from ya.  I can mess mine up 
right now, before night.  Ya see? An' mess it up.  You know 
what I mean?  Go doin' all kin' a nasty things, but yet and still 
God hadn' took it from me.  I messed it up. An' when He come 
from me then, He come fer it; He come for what he give ya; you 
messed it up.  It's no good, see?  But He won't come in; you're 
not accepted.  You know that?  Tha's jus', jus' -- this is jus' 
like a man and wife, ya know.  You know, they can get messed up 
so until nary don't want the other, you know what I mean? But 
still that license an' that name is up there.  It's written, ya 
see, so you don't take that away from 'em.  The Lawd don't take 
nothin' from ya ['em].  He don't want no second-hand religion nohow, 
see. He don't have it that way.
AL:    Well, you really think then, that the Missionary Baptist 
Church that you belonged to first, that none of the people have 
real religion.
