glad to see 'im!  He looked like a man, [had] done shaved.  Ya know, he
jus' looked good!  An' pretty, rosy as could be.  He more
rosy than Jack: Jack kinda white, ya know, look, uh, kinda
crackerish-like, ya know.  He look like he ain't had much blood
as Henry.  Henry was rosy like Ol' Man MacNorra, jus'
up there, jus', jus' it.  An'.... An' coal black hair.  All of 'em
had black hair.
     An' boy, that was sumpin' fun to me that night!  An', an'
I said, "Tell me you done marry."
     Said, "Yeah, I married a (stout, dark ?) white woman."
Says, "Now," he said, "Jack gonna marry Valle."  Said, "But we
got to take 'er back to New York before I let 'er know she got
a, ah, got a colored sister-in-law."  Heh, ha, ha,ha!  Says,
"If I let 'em know down here, her folks won't like it, but up
there," [says] said, "She won't care."
     They was in New York then.  That was in 'twenty...seven.
1927; I was in Miami.  Yessuh.  An' that was something funny
to me.  An' I ain' seed 'em no more [,see,] since 'cause Valle [had] an' him
did leave.  [She's] He's (sic) the cause a [him] her (sic) gittin' rid a the cafe an'
everything.  They come up here an' marry.  They up here somewhere, I reckon,
now.
     They're MacNorras; that's their name, MacNorra.  I thought
of 'em one day lookin' in the 'phone book; thought I'd find
MacNorras in there, huh!  Yessir.
