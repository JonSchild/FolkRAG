Gentle cow lowing in the evening.

Aug 6 - The long gap filled by a trip
to [the] Buchan, bosky Buchan, collecting
ballads. A bad luck trip full of
punctures, car trouble & ending with
my dropping the recording machine.
Instead I came back to Aberdeen
had machine sorted out & have
spent the last two weeks editing
my collectanea and worrying about
my radio program.
   Finally last weekend I could 
stand my lonliness no longer & invited 
Pip Bell up from London. She
loves me, poor girl. Well, I made
valliant love to her in a beautiful
hotel in the Trossachs all weekend.
At end I saw my face in the 
mirror, how dark & selfish
