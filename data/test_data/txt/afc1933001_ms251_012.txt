Dear Alan,

I cannot understand how I broke a 
confidence by repeating what you told
me your had read in a newspaper.
In my opinion my enquiries cannot
possibly hurt your mission. I first
wrote to the editor of the paper,
who did not reply. To him and
to the Secretary of the Chamber
of Commerce I merely said that
I had been told that a Negro
convict had been beaten to death
by his guards, and that no investigation
followed. I asked them
for the facts, and I told each of
them that I was a native of
Mississippi. The natural inference
from my letters would be that
I had doubts about the correctness
of the story
