Going North, sung and chanted by Tom Bradford with his own
guitar accompaniment (knife style), Birmingham, Ala., Oct.
25, 1934.

(Guitar, main theme; excitement; travel, far places; the singer
was half higher than a pine with corn whiskey.)

(Chanted) One time we was gitting -. They was getting a lot a'
niggers to take 'em up North; I thought I'd go up there myself.
The boss said, "Son, do you want to go up there?" I said, 
"Yes, Sir." He says, "Git in line then". I got in line. He
says, "Son, the train'll leave out in about thirty minutes."
I say, "All right." 'Bout thirty minutes he come back. "Say,
all right, son; we ready to go now." I say, "All right." The
train stand out there doing this away (guitar imitation of the
sound of the steam in a cylinder head). It started out easing
out from under the sheds, and commenced ringing the bell.
(guitar imitation of train bell). Got down there by the L. &
N. Trunk; then he blow (imitation of a train whistle).

(Sung) I am going up the road,
I am going up the road.

(Chanted) Every once in awhile he go by these little stations
and he blow (guitar imitation of train whistle). Got up in
Tennessee, had so many niggers, he got another engine. That
one in front, he blow this away (guitar imitation of baritone
whistle). That 'un on behind, he blow like this (imitation of
tenor whistle). We got up there; then got up in a great big
strike. I say, "I'm gonna write back to Mama and Papa and see
if they have got any money. If they ain', I'm gonna leave here;
an' if they is, I'm gonna leave here." Sont me a letter right
back; says, "Dear son, mighty glad to hear from you, but we
ain't got a penny in the house." I says, "Lawd, have mercy!" I 
went on down to that road crossin'; bell commence ringing (guitar
imitation of bell). About that time, I got on --- at the
road crossin'. I rid about fifteen or twenty miles 'fore he
ever found me. Time he found me on there, he says,

(Sung) "Negro, where are you going?"
I say,
(Sung) "I'm goin' to my long happy home." (4)
"No hobo can ride this train." (3)
(chanted) that time this -- a bell began ringing. (imitation of bell).
