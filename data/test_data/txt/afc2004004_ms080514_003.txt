Well we're all used to having opera houses,
symphony halls and chamber music places, where
the fine arts can continue, can be
preserved, but we have forgotten that all the
other arts need such places themselves in our
time, and that's what we have here in
Preservation Hall, a place where ah the great
music that started jazz, the early jazz of 
New Orleans, could be preserved. But what
does it mean to be preserved when you've got
music?  It means it has to be played, and the
genius of this place was that it provided an 
absolute legitimate living for some of the
great oldsters out of jazz to come together
and play every night for the people who
wanted to hear it.

The effect was remarkable. Ah, before ah
long,  [NAME]      Street, which had been
a dead article for 25 years, began to fill 
up with other jazz places, with other kinds
of jazz, and after a little bit the jazz 
parades, which had almost disappeared, began 
to happen again.
