Dear Alan:

It is essential that I receive a 
definite statement of your plans immediately 
I had to argue the Disbursing 
Office into accepting your last 
voucher because I have not as yet 
recommended any extension of time.  Furthermore,
some very interesting things
have been brewing with relief agencies
and it will help me if i know just when 
I may expect you. 

Sincerely yours, 

Harold Spivacks 
Chief, Division of Music
