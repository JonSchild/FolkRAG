Mercer County, Pennsylvania.
[*70*]
The following rumors are hereby reported, as instructed.

It must be understood that Mercer County is primarily
a defense industry area. The workers have been and are warned repeatedly against discussions of war work, in any form, by the various 
employers. Taprooms in the vicinity of defense parts are plastered 
with warnings against loose talk. In addition, the population of
Sharon, Sharpsville, Greenville and Grove City are, as a class,
factory workers, without much active analytic interest in world
events. Farrell has a very varied population, largely Slavish,
Hungarian, Polish, Negro with undoubtedly many undercurrents and
eddies, but not given to such discussions before strangers. Farrell
has many foreign language clubs (each with a good long bar) but
only members or invited guests are admitted.

I have previously heard no mention of second fronts,
of offensive operations against Japan, Martinique, Dakar. No
comments on rail movements have been rumored at any time to date.
Tire and gas rations have not been discussed much in recent weeks
in this vicinity. (There is no gas rationing here, as yet.) Notes
will be made on day heard to avoid as  much as possible any subjective
factors on my own part.
