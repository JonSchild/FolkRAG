Say either one you wanna say, yes or no.  No use to be shamed bout
what you want.  No u se a woman cussin out a man fur astin fur what
he want.
     (That's right.)
     May be a chance you'll git it, by askin fur what you
want.
     (That's right.)
     You know what people oughta taught chilren, then, when
I was comin up. . .?  Don't try to teach chilren six or seven years ole.
      (What do you think you should tell little children?)
      Well. . .You shouldn't tell them anything.  I tell you
what you should do.  You should be careful not to let them know these
things.
     (You think you could keep them from knowing these things?)
     Yeah you could.  Yo u can brang you lul gull up an
she'll nevah know nothin bout nothin like that until she's ole enough
fur you to set down an tell huh bout these th ings.
     (You think that's a good idea?)
     It's a good idea for one reason.  I'll be the savin
of the chile, you understan, from knowin things that should be kept.
     (What about the child seeing animals, etc.?)
     Thass what I'm tryin to tell you now.  These things should
be put out of sight.
     (How can they?)
     Whosoever it b'long to, you understan, it should be a 
law fur it.
     (Wh at about the little b irds and squirrels
and little dragon flies?)
     Hmm?
