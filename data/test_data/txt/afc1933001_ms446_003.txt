WHITE SPIRITUAL

One evening late Uncle Ben [who had fought with Robert E. Lee in Virginia,] "came through" at a [sunset] grove meeting held
far up the creek under the shade of a clump of cottonwood trees. We could
hear him coming back to the camp-ground singing ["I've been washed in the [?] of the Lord"]
and shouting in his great, booming voice in between the lines, [?] the 
famous Rebel yell and heavenly hallelujahs:]
"Whoop-se! Eyiah! Bully for Christ! Hurrah for Jesus!"
Uncle Ben had "got religion," [and he was answering the fact to his
neighbors.]

Frank Candy and I were taking food supplies by horseback to our

On the one side of Frank's horse swung a dozen frying-sized chickens,
balanced on the other by [many] dressed squirrels, killed that morning as [they]
robbed the fields of [young] corn bordering the forest. On his saddle-horn
in front of him he held a huge basket of fresh-picked black-eyed peas. I
rode on a sack, on end of which held a huge watermelon, the other stuffed full
of roasting-ears, fresh young corn ready for eating. Precariously in front of
me I carried [several [?] of [?] and] dozens of fresh eggs, gathered from the horse-trough
and back yard. A camp meeting was a failure unless the worshippers had plenty
