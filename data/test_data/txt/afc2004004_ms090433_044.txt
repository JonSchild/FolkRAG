Fisk, 3.  12.  DAVID EDWARDS.

E:  Well, Eddie and his mother work for Ham and he wouldn't make any money by his being so little and the farm and people gave him ( ?) and pay right smart.

A:  He plays pretty good?

E:  He play good.

A:  Is he still around?

E:  Still around, right in Memphis now.

A:  How much money do these people make would you say, these musicians make in a year?

E:  Well, in a year it's pretty hard to guess.  I'd say about two or three hundred dollars; I'd guess, hustlin, that is, playing beer taverns and something like that, see, they make more than that.

A:  How much money in a night?

E:  Well, I was playing in a crowd the other night, and they got just $18.  One night I got $25 for a swang band.  They'd do pretty good sometimes.

A:  Clem White, or --?

E:  White.

A:  When you say they sat down and teach you to play, how would they teach you anyhow?

E:  Well, they'd show me different chords, how to make.  I didn't know these chords.

A:  Did you have to pay them for your lessons?

E:  Some I had to pay and some I didn't.

A:  And then by the time you got through that year you could go with the best of them?

E:  I could go with the rest of em.  I don't care who the man is, who he is, he'd just go and tune his instrument, and I'd catch him.

A:  Where have you been traveling?

E:  Well, I feel all down the South, Louisiana, Texas, Illinois, Missouri,
