1  "A slip of the lip will sink a ship." 

2  Look out for that man 
He might be the enemy at hand 

3. Here's to the cow, 
That ate the beans, 
That gave the cream, 
To make the butter, 
That the neighbors had a fight over. 
The cow belonged to John; 
The beans belonged to Mary; 
The cream belonged to the cow; 
Who does the butter belong to? 

4  "A stitch in time saves nine" 
Sew up your old shoe.
