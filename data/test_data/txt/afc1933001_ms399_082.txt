A prize winner one year may not again compete for the same prize.
Explicitly, only men who earn their bread by handling cattle may be
contestants. Even more important for the onlooker who wishes to see
the dramatic and picturesque scenes of life on a cattle ranch, the
contests are strictly limited to what may happen one day on ranch.
So the bulldogger disappears. The boss does not require any cowboy
to run alongside a steer, catch him by the horns and hold him with his
bare hands. The girl broncho buster also disappears. On any ranch,
ancient or modern, the ladies are tendered gentle horses. If she must
ride a wild one, some generous and kind-hearted cowboy would first ride
him and let him pitch the hell out before allowing the female of the
species to risk her life.

The trick roper and the cowboy clown are there, but only for
hired entertainment - for them no prizes.

What the spectator sees in the amphitheatre at this Swenson
Ranch sponsored cowboy reunion, is the daily work of a cow ranch -
with one exception. A cowboy's job never depends on his ability to
ride bareback a wild steer, yet steer riding is almost a necessary part
of the training for young boys who live on the ranch, almost before they
quite wearing diapers you can find the younger generations in the milking
pens straddling the astonished and rebellious young calves. And yearling 
boys ride yearling steers. Hence, at the reunion one of the events always
is a meeting of the cowboys with their old enemies, the full grown
steers, untamed, vicious, buckers, without rivals.
