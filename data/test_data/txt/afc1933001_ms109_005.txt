The phonograph was out of
order when it arrived here,
but am sure its something
very minor, But I am
lonesome for the records.

Frank J- predicts that
this country will bust open
on the 15th of [O] Nov. ("Some
people say the 14th" says he,
"But I say the 15th." I will
write reams about this
matter & the puppetts &
mariachis that I saw in
the market last night &
the 4 hr. horse ride over
the mountains & the other
matters when & if I find a
typewriter.     I love you, love
you                  Chavella
