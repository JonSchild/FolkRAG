Dearest Alan,

Here is a letter I got from Elizabeth the other day. It may
be that this is a bad thing to send you but I thought it was so lovely
I couldn't bear not to. I wrote her back about a week ago.

Have you any notion what the family wants me to do for Christmas.
Johnny wrote me a mysterious letter stating, "Remember I seldom tell
all I know!" And I wonder what it is. I would like to come to the Seegers
through Christmas and then go to the ASU national convention in New York
It begins on the twenty-seventh I think. Our vacation here begins the
[twent] sixteenth!! Will you ask Charlie and Ruth to write Father and Deanie
inviting me to stay with them over Christmas? I will have quite
a lot of work to do over the vacations including two term papers, and
I think it will be better in all sorts of ways if I stay up here.

And will you ask R. and C. also if they would mind having
a friend of mine up for a day or perhaps two at the most before Christmas.
This will be Arfus, the girl you [know] don't know. Eddy will be in
New York I think but she has a hell of mother who won't let her do
a damn thing. I think it would be very swell if Arfus could stay a day
or two and meet lots of new people. She has lived in Philadelphia all
her life and for lots of personal reasons I think it would be good for
her to find out there are such bunches of nice people in the world.
It gives you a nice unlonely feeling.

I am slightly depressed on account of I haven't been sublimating
so good lately. I intend to commence this morning. What about the
Spanish records?

Much much love,
Bess
