or unless you have an uncontrollable
impulse to establish
contact with "The House
in the Woods", sequestered under
the oaks and elms of East Texas,
don't take up your time
for me. Pass me up as
an old—probably senile— 
dotard, unworthy of the
attention of a vigorous mid-
[century minor] of the twentieth
century anniversary of Jesus Christ,
the son of God—  

"The madman saith he
said so— 
It is strange."

Your father,
John A. Lomax
