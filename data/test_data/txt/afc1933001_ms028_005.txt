Mr. John A. Lomax
       Wilton, Conn.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
                             I have received a letter from Miss Evelyn Stearn, Secretary
to Mr. John L. Martin, in which she states that there is nothing that he can
do in this matter about which I wrote to you.
                             Therefore, I am sending a copy of the petition to you in the
hope that you will help and do all that you can.
                             Assuring you of my appreciation, I am
                                                                     Very sincerely yours,
                                                                      Myrtle C. Moore
