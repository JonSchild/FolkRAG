Dear Miss Bestor:

   The Archive of American Folk-song contains a large
collection of all types of American folk music, including
English and Scottish ballads, lumberjack and other t ypes
of occupational ballads, Negro songs of all sorts, French
folk-songs from the Mississippi Valley, Spanish songs from
the Southwest, songs from the Bahamas, Haiti, and Dutch
Guiana.  Some of these are very good examples of African
survivals in the Americas.  There is, besides, a small
group of excellent Iroquois records from upstate Nw
York.  The Library does not loan out recordings, but has
facilities for making excellent copies of them on acetate
at $1.50 per 12-inch disc, double-sided.  Mr. Lomax,
Assistant in Charge of the Archive, might make up a
selection for your use.  Besides this, within the next
six months we will issue regular shellac pressings of
some of the choicest songs.  These will be generally
available.

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief of the Music Division
