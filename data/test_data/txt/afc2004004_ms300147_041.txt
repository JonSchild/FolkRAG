Alan Lomax mailed the Bows
yestardy had to go 25 miles
out in the country to get them
in Regard to the songs I am
of the opinion that I would not
have a right to sell them
since they are all old Folk
songs older than I am. but
will take it up with my attorney
as soon as I can contact
him. Maybe next week
[I think] tell Shirley to get
a No 5 Banjo string for the Bow
Preferibly a Roped string
