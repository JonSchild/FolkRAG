Dear Mr Spivacke:
Before any copying of records 
is possible at most two pieces of
equipment are necessary:
1. A cutting needle
2. A new battery ( one is totally
usable- the other 
broke.)
I should appreciate your [?]
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax

Mr. Harold Spivacke
Acting [head] Chief, Division of Music
