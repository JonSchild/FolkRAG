Berea, Kentucky

Dear Miss Wilcox:

During the months of September and October this fall, I shall
be in the Eastern part of Kentucky, making records of folk-songs
for the Archive of American Folk-Song in the Library of Congress.
I am anxious to meet and work cooperatively with the collectors of
the region, in order that the Library may feel doubly sure that
its Kentucky collection will be truly representative of the quality
and variety of Kentucky folk-song.

I feel sure that through your work at Berea College you have
established contacts with interesting singers and communities that
should be represented in the Archive, and I feel equally certain
that you are able to offer me valuable suggestions in regard to collecting
in your neighborhood. I should like to know whether or not
you will be in Berea during the two months I plan to spend in the
mountains, and whether you would be willing to help me in the Archive's 
work there. I would greatly appreciate a letter from you, as detailed
as you care to make it, about your work in Kentucky folk-song, about
the region or regions in Eastern Kentucky you are well acquainted with
and about the singers that you know. I plan to leave Washington about
September the first.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge,
Archive of American Folk-Song
