      Of course, you've got to have these little tinges
of Spanish in it in order to play real good jazz. Jazz  has a foundation
that must be very prominent, especially with the bass
sections, in order to give a great background plus what's [is]
called riffs today which was known as figures, but figures
hasn't always been in the dance bands. I'll give you an 
idea of Spanish there is in the blues. (Piano) This particular
tune I wouldn't be honest if I said that maybe the
whole tune belonged to me, although my name is on it. It's [is]
supposed to be arranged by Mr. Joe Jordan, but these arrangements
were made also be myself. There's a man that used to
teach me to play piano. I'll have to give him credit for
some contribution to [these] this [blues] tune. His name was Frank Richards.
He was older than I was. He was on the ragtime order, but he 
was a very good player as far as it went, although he was
incapable of instructing anybody along music--that is for a 
very short ways, that is all he could go, he couldn't go very
far, because he didn't know so very much about music, himself.
But at least in the early days, in my beginning on the piano,
he was the first one that started my instructions and I thank
him greatly for that. His name is Frank Richards, I mentioned 
it before, but I want to be sure that you get his name correctlyâ€”
Frank Richards.

Question: What part of the blues did he contribute?

Morton: Well, I claim that his contribution was more
