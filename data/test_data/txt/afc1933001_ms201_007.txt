Dear Alan:
Thank you very much for sending me your
study on the classification by culture areas and 
regions. We shall keep this around, and I feel
sure that some day it will prove useful when we
do more with our "anthropological" collection.
With kindest regards, 
Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
