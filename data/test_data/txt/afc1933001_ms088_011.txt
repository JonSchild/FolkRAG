Mr. Ted Moses
The Cattleman
Coloseum Building
Fort Worth, Texas

Dear Mr. Moses:

As you know, for thirty years I have been collecting and making records
of the songs of the cowboy, especially the songs that they sang in the old trail-driving 
days. The records I make are all deposited in the Library of Congress as
a part of the history of the Southwest.

I am now interested in putting on records the calls, shouts, or hollers
that the handlers of cattle make when they wish to hurry a herd along, to turn a
bunch headed the wrong way, to quiet them qhen they are restless, etc., etc.

I can recall when I was a small boy in Bosque County, when the big herds,
headed North, came up the Bosque River Valley and crossed the Brazos at Kimball's
Bend, I often heard these musical calls to the cattle. On rainy days the cries had
a mournful sound, as if they reflected the discomfort and misery of the cowboys
slogging after the herd. At night when herds were bedded down near my home, I used
to listen to the songs and calls of the cowboys as they circled the cattle in the darkness.
Not all groups of cowboys sang or gave these cattle calls.

I hope that through your fine paper I can find some one who will shout
these calls into my microphone - some one who remembers them from trail-driving
days, or who learned them from some old-timer. I shall be deeply grateful if
you will make enquiry through The Cattleman. I will take my recording machine
wherever a person can be found who will help to preserve these unique hollers.
All the records will go for safe-keeping to the Library of Congress, Washington,
D. C.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
