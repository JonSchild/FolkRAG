Tape: #226 Sacred Harp 

Summary

A Sacred Harp member explains to AL the history of Holly 
Springs Church. It is so named because two springs run on
either side of the church. He remembers that "young people 
would come down here at recess and hold hands and get a drink"
from the fresh mountain water. The church sits on "valuable
property" between two major highways of the area, I20 and I27.
The church was built in 1903. Before the present church, there
was a "log church" on the property. It is a "Primitive Baptist"
church, and holds a service on the fourth Sunday of each month
(the congregation is small). Since the church is not used
three Sundays a month, the Sacred Harp singers use it for
their singing meetings. AL suggests that the church is a 
"musical shrine" because the Sacred Harp people keep it up.
The man says that the Sacred Harp singers take care of everything 
and built the picnic table.

The 2nd, longest section of the tape is a lecture on musical
notation and theory by [Mr. Rogers] (?) [*Hugh McGraw*] at a Sacred Harp meeting.
"Rhythmatics is your time and accent, melodics is your tonality,
and dynamics is your power, high and low." He goes on to cover
the musical staff, F and G clefs, bars, measures, time signatures,
rhythmic notation, octaves, compound, common and triple 
times; accents, syncopation, repeats, slurs and ties, triplets,
and chromatics. Some of the explanation is unclear, especially
the section on "ties." There are two questions from the congregation,
both unclear.
