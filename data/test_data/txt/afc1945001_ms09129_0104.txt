The other day I heard a young girl say 
that she wouldn't work in a defense 
plant because she had seen other girls 
who did, and then they began to smoke, 
and drink, and develope bad character.  
I do not think she is very patriotic.  

I have heard young married girls 
say they won't go to work because 
the army would take their husbands.  

At the notary last night, a man 
said he might as well quit his 
job and be a bum, because he 
had to pay so much taxes.
