understand, of course, that my accompanying you and
helping you will depend upon whether or not I get some
sort of grant before that time. In your case finances
would not need to be considered; in mine, as you can
readily understand, they would.

I shall be looking forward to a letter
from you, and hope that matters will shape themselves
so that we can do some worthwhile work in this field
for a week or so this summer.

Very truly yours,
Paul G. Brewster
