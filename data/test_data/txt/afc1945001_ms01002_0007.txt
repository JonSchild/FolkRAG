Rumor Clinics

A Rumor Clinic is a specialized group of volunteer professors
and advanced students, prepared by a short intensive
course on Psychological Warfare under the supervision of the
Civilian Morale Service to collect, analyze and route to the
Office of Education significant rumors current in the clinic's
area.  Eight such clinics have already be identified,
and are ready for the kind of cooperative assistance outlined
here.  Present plans call for fifteen or twenty more.

The Rumor Clinic also is a councilling agency for the promotion
of understanding the problem of rumor-mongering;
using the radio, public discussion, and the printed word.
A Rumor Clinic is therefore an outlet for authentic information
on this subject, which it in turn processes for its
own area.

It is obvious that great discretion must be exercised in
the selection of stories and materials for public discussion.
It would be preferable to discuss current rumors only of
the Mousetrap, Confused and Recurrent varieties.  Defeatist,
Slanderous, and Strategic rumors should be discussed only
when the specific individual stories are long dead.

The danger that the public analysis of rumors might tend to
spread them unquestionably exists.  It necessitates the most
careful consideration of the kind of material which may be
authorized for release, and careful selection of the persons
authorized to make public use of it.
