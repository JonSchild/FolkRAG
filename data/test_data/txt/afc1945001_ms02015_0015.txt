Subject: Availability of Rumor Collectors for Future Studies

Will you please furnish us with the names and addresses of the
persons who are cooperating with you in the rumor collection
now under way. First of all, we want to thank them, and secondarily,
we may want to ask for their help sometime in the future.

You will be of considerable assistance to us if you will let us
know the reaction of each person who cooperated. We want to know:
Was the work interesting? Was it too burdensome? What general
comment or suggestions are offered? Would they be willing to
repeat this type of rumor reporting? As to how often, would they
do it continuously, if that were desired, or for a specified week
from time to time? If they would do it for a day at a time, at
what intervals would they be willing to undertake it?

If you have any suggestions or criticisms of the rumor collection
procedure, I shall be glad to have them. We do know that too short
a time was left for you to make arrangements for collectors.
