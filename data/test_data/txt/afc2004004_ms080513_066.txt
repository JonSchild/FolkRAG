[*BARBARA ALLEN
(Short Version) 
2 *]

A [ Ah, what Frank is picking out is the ah
nostalgic song that was everybody's favourite
in frontier America, in the 19th century, the 
old song of ah Barbara Allen, and ah, which
touches deep in ah - which goes deeply into the
feeling of frustration that people had about
love in this period of ah severe sexual
morality. * Barbara ah rejects her lover and he
dies of heartbreak, and ah, there's nothing
more to the story than that, but, ah, no one's
ever been able to resist it, from Samuel Pepys
down to the old mountaineer who said:  whenever 
I hear it, the har just stands right up on my
head and I get goose pimples all over.  And, ah,
he was thinking about his own problems in
this part of life, and the problems of love
in the nin - in 19th century America. *

Ah, you know, Ray and his friend and everybody
ah, if you just ask them, talk about this very
freely.  Ah, [ backwoods America, in spite of
whatever Erskine Caldwell wrote about it, was
a place where, where ah love was difficult to
come by.  Parents watched their children very
carefully and a girl could get into lifelong
trouble if she made a misstep. ]  Sometimes she
was actually driven away from home in some
areas.
