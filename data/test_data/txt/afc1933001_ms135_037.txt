Washington, D. C. 

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I shall be away during August, or part of that 
month, but in all likelihood I will be on the job 
in September.  As you know, Miss Edgar has been having 
a siege of sickness.  I doubt very much that 
she will be in shape to do anything this summer.

Sincerely yours,
Theodore C Blegen
Superintendent
