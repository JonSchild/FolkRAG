1655  A
As I said, they brought me a lot of light operas, including
"Miserere" from "Il Trovatore" and so forth and so on like that,
and finally they brought me "Poet and Peasant."  It seems like
in St. Louis if you was able to play "Poet and Peasant", correctly
you was really considered the tops and the man that [who] brought it
to me was supposed to be the best musician in town, and it seems
like he wasn't able to master this piece himself.  I had known
this tune for many years and had played it in [for] recitals and so
forth and so on at light concerts and things, and they placed
this number in front of me and I started looking at it like I
never seen it before, which I had rehearsed it maybe two months
before I was able to play it, [And] I start playing this number,
so I got to a passage and this passage was a very fast passage
and I had to turn the page over, but it was impossible for me to
turn the page over, due to the fact that this passage was so
fast and I had to manipulate it so fast, I couldn't turn it
over even through I new the tune, and Mr. Matthews grabbed the
tune from in front of me, which was "Poet and Peasant" and
said, "Hell, don't be messing with that guy.  That guy is a
shark."  And I told them, "Boys, I been kidding you all the
time.  Say, I knew all these tunes anyhow."  So I swung a few
of these operatic tunes for them like "Miserere" from "Il
Trovadore" in my style.  (Piano)  I combined "Anvil Chorus"
with it. (Piano)
