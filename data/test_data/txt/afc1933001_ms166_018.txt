"Nicodemus the Slave"

Nicodemus the slave was of African birth
He was bought for a bag full of gold
He was reckoned by all, as the salt of 
the earth
And he died years ago, very old.

'Twas his last sad request, so we laid
him away
In the trunk of an old hollow tree.
"Wake me up," was his charge, "at the 
first break of day
Wake me up for the great Jubilee."

'Twas a long time coming, but its almost 
here
Though a long long long on the way, 
So (to be sung fast) run tell Elijah to hurry up Pomp
to meet us at the gum tree, down
in the swamp.
(Very slowly) To wake Nicodemus today
