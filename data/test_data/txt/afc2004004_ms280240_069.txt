Lomax: It doesn't end ... Usually they go off and leave the
girl and don't give a damn.
McBeth: O he came back, you see, and searched for her.
Lomax: Do you think that's based on a true story?
McBeth: Oh yes, probably. Aye, as far as I could see.  The song
really took place and it belongs to the toon o Dundee.

1) Come all ye lonely lovers, come listen unto me,
It's about a 'prentice ploughboy I mean to let you hear,
Concerning of a ploughboy and a ploughman he was bound,
And he is the heir of nearly twenty thousand pounds.

2) Down in my father's garden when first my love met me,
He threw his arms around my neck and embraced me tenderly,
We both sat down upon the ground for to complete our joy,
Go where ye will and I love him still, he's my darling ploughman boy.

3) The sacks and leaves are well pulled down, on them I'll make my bed,
The greenwood piles are well pulled down below my weary head,
The reaper bush will be my guide and for once my heart is coy,
Go where ye will and I love him still, he's my darling ploughman boy.

4) Now since I'm not inclined to tell to you his name,
He is the laddie in my mind, the laddie I lo'e well,
But when he sings, the barley rings and he makes my heart full joy
Go whereye will and I love him still he's my darlin' ploughman boy.

Lomax: Jimmy, there seemed to be a lot of goings on in the old
days when rich men tried to grab up all the best looking girls.
McBeth: My mother told me about that.  In her day they did that.
Lomax: What did she tell you about it, Jimmy?
McBeth: They took advantage of them, the masters did.  They left
their own wife ...
Lomax: And the girls had to comform?
McBeth: O they did.  They surely did.
