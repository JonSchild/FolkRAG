THE CAPITALISTS WILL FOOL YOU IF YOU DON'T WATCH OUT
The capitalists will fool you if you don't watch out,
And if they do, you'll scream and shout,
Naked and hungry and nothin' to eat, 
My wife and children throws out on the street,
That's what the class struggle's all about.
They try to make you think they're the poor man's friend, 
But that's when elections they are trying to win,
That's what the capitalists is about.
But the workers know what class they're in,
And they sure do know who's the worker's friend,
That's what the workers are about.
We win this election by a big majority 
For we all voted for Mayor La Gardy,
That's what the Labor Party's all about.
I am a real American, my father always said,
My grandmother, she's Indian, so you can call me a Red,
That's what the class struggle's all about.
We go idey-iedy, we go boo-boo-boo.
But you can't fool the workers, you bourgwahs, you,
That's what the class struggle's all about.
Try to fool the workers, on strike we'll go,
With the Farmer-Labor Party and the CIO,
That's what the workers are about.
