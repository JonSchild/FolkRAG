Rumors.

Hitler is dead. Hitler
is dead. That is what
people all over our
country are shouting

"Ah" if such a wonderful
thing could
happen. That would
not end the war, but
defeat for the Axis would
be in sight.

This rumor hasn't
been confirmed. So we
the school children of today
who are the parents
of tomorrow cannot
raise our hopes to high.

But some day the
rumor will be true.
I suppose we can wait
to selebreate [celebrate] the eventful
day.
