1932

During the late Spring of 1932, at the nadir of the general
financial collapse, my fortunes had reached their lowest ebb since the day
I left college. At these two periods of my life I was in each case 
worth less than nothing. I was heavily in debt. I had no job, when I
graduated from college, I did possess youth and health; while in 
1932 I was barely recovering from an exhausting illness. Moreover, my
children, Alan and Bess Brown, were yet dependents.

I had reached New York City on a long lecture trip with John, Jr. 
as the driver of my Ford car. We camped by the roadside and did our
own cooking. My lecture fees had reached a low limit of $5.85 for a 
single engagement. Cowboy songs had gone almost into a total eclipse.

One morning I drifted into the offices of Macmill[o]ans at Sixty
[Fifth] 5th Avenue, Mr. E.H. L[o]atham, a big hearty, wholesome man, whom I
knew slightly, received me with gracious courtesy. I told him timidly 
that for years I had hoped to edit a [collection] volume of American folk songs
but that until at that time I had never had the leisure to round out 
a collection that had been growing steadily for more than twenty years.
Mr. L[o]atham had told me more than once of his fondness for the crude 
output of the cowboys contained in my two books of Cowboy Songs
published by the Macmillans. Both these books had a st[u]eady if 
slow sale for several years. I watched Mr. Latham's face as I 
unfolded my story, I was desperate and I think he realized it.

"I like your plans," Mr. L[o]tham said, "but we cannot tell in
advance how we will like the book you will submit. Have you any
sample songs?" I was ready for just that question. "I can't sing
them," I said eagerly, "but let me read you these."
