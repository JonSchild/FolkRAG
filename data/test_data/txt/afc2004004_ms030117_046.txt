     An I wanna tell you anothah thang, too.  Lot of women
don't know how to catch a man.  Lot of men don't know how to catch a 
woman.  Ef you're goin anywhere, go on where you started.  Don't be so
tight an narrow.  Say, "Well, I'm goin.  You g oin my way?"  That show
them you don't want nobody theah when you do leave.  Whosoever is
theah, LEAVE ME THEAH!  Let the thang git good to em so you can catch
em.  You understan?  Bes time you can ever catch fish when de sun go
down.
     (You feel you'd like to get revenge on them?)
     Reven ge on em?  Well. . .No, it's not a mattah of that.
If you treat a pusson right.  Miss Lizybeth, whatever a pusson done,
GodAMighty make that thing good to a pusson an they cain't quit till
you lay yo hand on em. . .?  They jes can't quit.  They jes can't.  Whenever
they're at, they jes can't let that thang alone.  Till you catch em.
     (Then what would happen, if you catch them?)
     That be lef wid you, what would happen.  If I catch anybody
messin wid anythang of mine, why, I'm gonna keep em theah.
Till everybody, everybody in town come to see em.  Thass the way I
catch em.  Make em finish doin what they'se doin.  They won't nevah
stop, cause I'm gon kill both of em right theah.  I spect I might set
down an play my guitar a while an make em tell me how was it.
They git up an kill em.  Thass right.
     (Then you must feel very possessive about women?)
     NAW!...Naw.  Now jis listen what I'm gon tell you:
It's some real, genuwine good women.  But the dog always git it.
When you gits ready to go to de market to buy, the man chip the meat
off the bone, an he give you the bone; the dog didn't do nothin but
jes switch his tail fur it an he got the meat.  Sorry men gits good
women.  Sorry men gits good women.  I tell you why.  You want me to tell
