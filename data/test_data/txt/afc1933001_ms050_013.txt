Mr. T. A. Hight
Hanford
California

Dear Mr. Hight:
    Among the notations I have about you is a
mention of "Tom Hight's Scrapbook". I wonder if
you yet have this scrapbook and I am wondering also
if you would send it to me so that I could copy all
the notes and songs you have entered therein and
deposit it in the Folk-Song Archive of the Library
of Congress. I feel that it would be a very valua-
ble contribution.
    I have just been reredding a number of your
letters to me and I wish to express again my appre-
ciation for the very real help you have been in the
work I have tried to do.

    Sincerely yours,
    Honorary Consultant and Curator
    Archive of American Folk-Song
