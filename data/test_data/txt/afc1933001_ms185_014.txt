Dear Alan:

During the folk lore conference here at I.U. over the past six weeks,
frequent mention has been made of the desirability of using our own folk
material in the public schools. The same idea was stressed at the Conference 
in Milwaukee last spring. I have been wondering if any one has yet
had the idea of getting a song book or books, for use in the elementary
schools, made up entirely of our own folk material? I do not have in mind
just a book of songs from which teachers could select, but rather a book
organized around a definite music education plan for use either as a basal
text in the school room, or as an important supplement to other basal texts
already in use.

I am sure that suitable songs for the purpose exist, and that they could be
organized in such a way as to supply not only a determine first-hand contact
with our own culture, but also to further legitimate student music education
aims.

Would you be at all interested in collaborating with me in the production of
such a book or books? The contribution that you could make does not need
even to be mentioned. My contribution to such a project would be the
following:

1. Actual trial of the material in a normal class room situation
where the reactions of children, teachers and parents could be
secured.
2. The organization of the material for teaching purposes.
3. The preparation of any accompanying manuals or teaching aids.
4. Whatever prestige Indiana University may have in the field
of folk lore, and whatever standing I may have personally in
the field of music education.

I realize that this suggestion may not interest you in the least, or that
you may already be embarked on such a project with some other person. It
will surprise me if some one else has not had the same idea. I should like
your reaction, however, for I am convinced that if our own material is to
be made vital among our people, at least one effective way to go at the
problem is through the children in our elementary schools. Since I have
already published two books in the elementary field, I believe I could bring some valuable experience to such a project.
