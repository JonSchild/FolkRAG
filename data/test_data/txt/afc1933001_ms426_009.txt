SMILE! FIGHT! YELL! SING!
Tune--Pack Up Your Troubles.

Forget your trouble in this union fight,
and smile, smile smile.
We've got enough to do without your sigh,
So smile, Boys, all the while.
What's the use of being blue,
It doesn't do, do, do.
You! Forget your troubles in this union fight,
And smile, smile smile.

We've got a war to win to save our farms,
So fight! fight! fight!
No use to squawk and fuss and rub it in,
T'will never win the fight.
What's the use of shedding tears,
It's not our funeral,
So-forget your troubles in this union fight,
And yell! yell! yell!

We used to have to fight upon a dream
Of hopes to be.
Now we can count our gains a dozen times
Of victory-ry-ry.
Take your coat off, roll your sleeves
And look up like a king.
Then-tune up your fiddle for a Union song,
And sing, sing, sing.

LET ME CALL YOU BROTHER
Tune-- Let Me Call You Sweetheart.

Let me call you brother in this union fight,
Let me feel a kinship in this dark dark night,
Let me know you're nearer than a stranger cold,
Let me call you brother, soldier, comrade bold.

Come and join together, like the foes will do,
Grip our hands like brethren, me and you, you, you.
Bind our hears together, one in unison,
Never more to separate till victory's won.

Let us die together if the worst must come,
Never stop the battle til we save our home.
Wealth may crush our lives out but we'll go down true,
Ever with our heads up, me and you, you, you.
