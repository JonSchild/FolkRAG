Henry Ford Blues
When the Model A Ford first came out, L.B., who is
a firm believer in Fords and in Mr. Ford,-- as he says,
dey'll do de work, dey'll take you where you want to go"--
heard everybody talking about them. "I listened to one
 man say one [thing] word there an' I heard somebody else say
[somethin' else] another word over yonder an' I put 'em all together an'
made me a song."

Here [it is], he is, a great [man brought down to earth
and still a great man.]  Capitalist masterfully 
doing business, instructing his
friends and henchmen
with pithy words,
and talking the language of a barrel-
house Negro. 

 This Blues [is an example of] shows how little L.B. 
cares for meaning and consistency in our sense
of these words and the last stanza [we see] 
[how [?] that] illustrates the penetrating 
power of a good publicity campaign.

 L.B. hopes that he will have a chance
to sing this song to Mr. Henry Ford some day and believes, 
when that day comes, Mr. Ford will give a brand new, shiny 
Ford car, "late model".
