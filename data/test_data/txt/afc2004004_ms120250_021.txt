Dear Mr. Lomax: 
I do not think you need to be afraid of duplicating 
the songs I collected in Haiti for two reasons; in the first
place your recordings will be so far superior to mine that 
it will undoubtedly be possible to get much greater values 
from your discs than could ever be obtained from my cylinders, 
and in the second place the variations from valley 
to valley are so great that no problem of conflict could 
possibly arise. All my songs were recorded in Mirebalais, 
which is, of course, across the mountains to the north 
of the plain where you are working. I do not think it 
would be too much to say that I did not hear one song sung 
outside of Mirebalais that I heard in it; furthermore our 
personal servants who were from the southern peninsula had
never heard these songs, nor had the people of Mirebalais 
ever heard their songs.

I would suggest that in a given region you go 
at recording songs systematically, dividing them into secular 
songs and religious songs. Of secular songs there 
should be the songs sung by the cooperative work groups 
called combites, the songs of allusion called point, which 
retail gossip; songs sung for the rara festivals (mardi 
gras); and the songs which accompany the secular dance cycles, 
including the martinique, the banda, zesse, and the like.

In the religious field I think it would be wise 
to go at the matter systematically, deity by deity, and I am 
enclosing a series of lists of gods which are worshipped in 
the Mirebalais vodun cult and which will give you the necessary 
leads. I take it, of course, that you are attending 
vodun ceremonies with Dr. Reiser (to whom I hope you will 
give my best regards); if your recording machine can get 
drums and singers as they actually are heard at dances, it 
will be extremely valuable.

I think you should also try to get some of the 
services, and obtain some of the songs sung at these ceremonies. 
One will get the songs which are used when sanctifying
