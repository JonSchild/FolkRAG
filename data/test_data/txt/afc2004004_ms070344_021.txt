Heaven - "pulled out his razor
& slashed his own throat from
ear to ear."  This is true &
the characters known.  Should
send it to Sandburg.

Dublin - 1890 quays along
the Liffey with the names of
the merchants painted in black
letters across the 3 & 4 storey 
[?high] fronts.

the cops, beef & whiskey 
flushed, hairy, bestial faces,
enormous bodies, heavy lidded
eyes of [?] who never strike
except to kill or [?came] & [?]
while can be gentle

not a middle aged man
whose face is not whiskey
purple - 

- more kindness & care [?than]
any capital I've seen - people
with time to talk, give directions
