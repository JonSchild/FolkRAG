that has left the old country, the Nova Scotia in the
southwestern part of Louisiana, and then the south Louisiana
American melting pot is a, different nationalities.  And you
see when I started school I couldn't speak anything but, but
French.  My parents didn't speak English at all.  And I was
forbidden to speak French in the school, for instance.  And
as it went, then they realized that. . .
AL  How did you feel as a little boy then
when, not being able to talk in your own language?
     :  How would you feel if they put you in a 
country. . . .
AL  You gell me how you felt.
     :  How the, I, I felt an oddball.  That
when you talked about people that spoke English, they were
American and you were French.  It was very, very disturbing.
It was awful.  But over the years they realized that to be
bilingual was something beautiful, very educational.  Now,
the thing that I can't,  I can't understand, and I'm just a 
simple man, but I can't understand why they want to teach my
grandchildren now to speak Parisian.  Once you've taken
that, once you've taken the Cajun language you've taken the
Cajun culture away from me, away from my grandchildren, then
who are they?  They're an American plastic card with a 
number on it.  And my God, I hate to see this happen.
AL  Do you think it is happening now?
