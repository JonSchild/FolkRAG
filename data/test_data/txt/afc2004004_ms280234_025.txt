3) And who will smile upon is and bless our flashing arms?
And who will be our queen of hearts in battles loud alarms?
Our own dear Irish mother, no other queen we know,
We'll die for her, or conquer - a reaping we will go.

3) And what will be our harvest, of dear united men?
And what will be the harvest down in every field and glen?
'Tis scarlet Saxon soldiers all standing in a row,
Will be our sheaves of corn when we a-reaping go.

The Marseilles: Parody.
1) The dogs of war at loose are holding
And treacherous kings consulting raise.
The dogs of war at loose are holding
And lo, our fields and cities blaze.
And shall we basely view the ruin
While all is by our foe destroyed?
Rest our salvation far and wide
With crime and blood his hands are brewing.
To arms, to arms, ye brave,
The victory of the grave.
March on, march on, all hearts resolve
To Liberty or death

Tape 66:
1) Othe praties they grow small, over here, over here,
O the praties they grow small over here.
O the praties they grow small, but we eat them skin and all,
They were better than none at all, over here, over here.

2) Same. . . .
They were better than fuck-all, over here.
