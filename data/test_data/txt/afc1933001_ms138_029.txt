Laurium Mich
Oct. 20-1938 

Dearest Alan:- 
Thinking of you this 
evening, I thought, I would drop 
you these few lines, and let 
you know, that we're all still 
lonesome for you, Abo is still 
here mourning for your company
Yalmer is feeling very ill, he's 
laying down and Abo went 
to one old widow's house. I 
have often thought did you 
get any trace of those 
films before you left, and did 
you get very many song's 
and music in Jinn; Oh! I 
wish you were closer so 
you could every once in a 
while come and a company
