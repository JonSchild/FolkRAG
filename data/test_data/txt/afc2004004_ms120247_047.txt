The songs that these orchestras play and sing are, one
might say, the only respectable popular songs in Haiti. They
are the only songs publicly sanctioned by the members
of the upper class and all, the striving petit bourgoisie.
Most of the songs are called meringues, touted as the national
music of Haiti, but almost certainly Cuban and Santo Domingan
in origin. (For example one of the most popular meringues
of today of Gonaive. I heard this sung in Spanish the other
day by a man who claimed he had learned it in Santo Domingo.
I doubt if the cultural influence goes the other
way.) The rhythms, and the spirit and most of the
melodies of the meringues are completely foreign to the rest
of Haitian music and I think that any person that listens
to these records would say
that they sound closer to Cuban or Santo Domingan music than
they do to the rest of the Haitian music I have recorded.

Of course, it is possible that one has in Haiti two
musical cultures corresponding to the limits of the two
classes, the rich and the poor; and it certainly seems that
this is the case, when the upper-class audiences (especially
the upper-class women) ask for me to play them meringue records
and the lower-class audiences always want vaudoo or
mardi gras music, and when one has observed that the
language of the meringues is half Creole, half French, so to
speak. Yet it is important to observe : that the language is
only half French, interest of the upper-class and the
lower overlap and the musical tastes too, and that most of
the upper-class culture is an obvious importation.

The ten thousand of the upper class in Haiti are not seen dancing
at the vaudoo bamboches, although they dance. And the
vaudoo dances are banned by law. Outside of mardi gras season
no respectable person will dance the mascaron or hannch dance.
Therefore, if you want to give a nice little party in your
house you call for the local manoumbas group. Sometimes these
orchestras include a banjo-mandolin and a Spanish guitar or
two and there is no trois, sometimes the manoumbas is not
included, but the range of songs is pretty much the same everywhere
I have been, both here and in the South. Ti Mamam Cheri,
President Vincent, All Messieurs qui gain' courage bambouher,
Port de Paix, Gonaive, Moscosso, one or two Cuban or Santo
Domingan songs in Spanish and two or three vaudoo songs adapted
to the meringue rhythm.
