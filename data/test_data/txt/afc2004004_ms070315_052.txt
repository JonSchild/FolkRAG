livin' with me for seven months, 
now I'm gon' live with her awhile -
now I've changed - I'm gonna [put] take
my wife & children on the road to 
the promised land  -
stories about the chrysler & the
rings in the oil pan - about the 
bushels of apples in the back floor
story about living with his sister
and trying to marry the widow 
woman —
Later we barged in on the party 
given in our honor at the High School.
Discussed Negro folk lore in the community
until far into the night.
Went to Miss Rogers house & gave
her the outline for a Negro folk
festival.
Leaving in the morning, with the 
job 1/4 done — but it would take
a month more to complete it. I'm
restless & tired.
