Mrs. M. [M]Cosgrove,

NEWTONGRANGE.
Midlothian,
Scotland,
Dear Mrs, Cosgrove,
In the second week before Christmas you certainly took
the old British championship for the best and most
travelled miner's wife stage star.  Congratulations on your
success in the dramatic contest.  All that hurts me is that
you had to go home so quick.  We hardly got to know each
other and had not half started recording your songs for
posterity.
I must say that you and your brother have certainly been 
tactful about the letters to the B.B.C. and to me.  Your
tact has won its reward because they are sending you money
to cover the return fare.  If there was any misunderstanding,
let me take the blame.  But I hope when I hear from you
next you will be all straightened out.  If and when that
does come through, perhaps you'll feel like sending David
Attenborough back his three quid.  Forget about my three,
you don't owe me anything and after all it was me that made 
the mistake, an error of over-anxiety about the success of 
the programme.
You will be glad to know that your part in the show was
a great hit and that the series wound up with a bang.  So
much so that they are going to go on with it next year,
and I hope that I can have you back again for some more
extended part.  I have written friends in Scotland about
you and you should be hearing from them,
All regards to Harry, your brother and all the other nice
friends in your family.
Best wishes for a happy New Year,
I am sincerely yours,
