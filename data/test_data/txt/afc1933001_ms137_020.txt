RECEIVED

                                     Attached is a suggestion from Mr. Alan Lomas that the Library pay Mr. James W. Green, ballad singer, $15 for the ballads he has contributed to the collection of the Archive of American Folk-Song. I recommend that this be paid and charged to the appropriation for the Increase of the Library.
