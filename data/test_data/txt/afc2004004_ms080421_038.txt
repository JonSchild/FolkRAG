as a craftsman. You get paid half in money and half of it's
in satisfaction of doin' somethin': tryin' to make somethin' purty.

(I'm sorry, just hold on one sec.)

If I got paid for skilled labor, like my son-in-law gets paid, a
dulcimer would run, the cheapest one I would make would run you about
$600. But I don't get paid that much, I don't, I have always figured
that I might have made the minimum wage; and sometimes I've put in
a lot of days and didn't make nothin'. That's the way things turn out
in the crafts world. You never know what, you work in the shop maybe
all day and you come out with nothin'; maybe you work a day and come
out with a hundred dollars, which would be very seldom.
