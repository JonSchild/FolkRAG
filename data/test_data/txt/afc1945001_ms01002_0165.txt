MEMORANDUM

To: Mr. Keith Kane
From: Douglas Meservey
Subject: Collecting Rumors

    George Barnes has suggested a few additional ways of collecting
rumors.
      1.  One Hundred hand-picked editors like Waymack of Des Moines
          and Boettiger of Seattle spotted around the Country.

        2.  Contact the various information agencies of the Government
           and get each of them to pick five or ten of their best 
           and most trusted people in the field who are ex-newspaper 
           men.  Their experience would not only be good but they are 
           Government employees and would be loyal and subject to 
           control.

          3.  Certainly the F.B.I. operatives should be allowed to 
                help.
     In getting this information you might try to aim towards three 
or four Nazi "tricks of the week", such as the "Widow on the Bus".
