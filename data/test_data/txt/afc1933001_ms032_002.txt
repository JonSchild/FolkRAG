Dear Mr. Spinacke:
The machine is here, 
apparently in good order.
I'm off for the wilds of 
New Mexico. Thank you!
Please have Mr. Strunk's 
Secretary send the certificate 
mentioned in the enclosed
letter. I think she will recall
the transaction - a double 
payment of express on the 
machine.  Regards to everybody.
Yours,
John A. Lomax
