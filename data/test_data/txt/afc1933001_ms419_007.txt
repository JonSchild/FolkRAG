1 Mamma, Mamma, make me a garment, [*23*]
And make it long, white, and narrow.

2 Mamma, Mamma, look on my pillow
And you will find some money.

3 Get along, boys, and gather 'round me,
Come pay my fine, come and get me.

4 My true love died the other day,
I believe I'll die tomorrow.

MUSIC---Go Down, You Little Red Rising Sun

GO DOWN, YOU LITTLE RIDING SUN

1 Uh---go down, go down, you little red,
Redder than rouge rising sun,
And don't you never---uh---bring day,
Great Godamighty, no more.

2 To the pine, to the pine, where the sun,
Great Godamighty, don't shine,
You got to shiver when the cold,
Great Godamighty, wind blows.

3 Lord, I wish to my soul that old bald---
Bald-head Judge was dead,
And green grass growing round,
Great Godamighty, his head.

4 Lord, I left my home in nine---
Nineteen hundred and ten,
And I ain't never, oh, been back,
Great Godamighty, again.

5 "Oh, Mamma, Mamma, why'n't you pray,
Great Godamighty, for this child?
For the grand jury tryin' to have,
Great Godamighty, him hung."

6 "Oh, son, oh, son, what in the world,
Great Godamighty, you done,
For the grand jury tryin' to have,
Great Godamighty, you hung?"

7 "Mamma, Mamma, you just pray,
Great Godamighty, for me,
And I never will do wrong,
Great Godamighty, no more.

8 "I ain't killed no man and I ain't robbed,
Great Godamighty, no train, [*23*]
And I ain't did no man,
Great Godamighty, no crime."
