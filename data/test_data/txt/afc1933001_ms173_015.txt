   Mr. Fletcher Collins, Charman of the Folklore Committee
of the National Council of Teachers of English, has requested
the use of a Library machine for ten days of recording in North
Carolina.  Mr. Collins has an excellent reputation as a collector
of folk-songs and I feel that this project would bring good
records into the Archive.  He wishes to have the use of the machine
in the month of October, so that approval of the project should be
expedited.

A   A budget for the project appears below.
