Education and the Schools

Both of these Delta Counties have County high schools which appear 
to be the very special pride of the benevolent planters.  The Coahoma County 
Training School is an attractively designed institution set in the midst of a 
large plantation development.  The Bolivar County Training School is located 
at Mound Bayou.  These schools, however, reach only a small section of the 
Negro population.

The great mass of the Negro youth are exposed only to such elementary 
schools as are available.  Salaries for Negro teachers are not much above what 
they were fifty years ago, and the schools themselves reflect about this same 
rate of progress.  For example, in 1889 white teachers in Bolivar received $45.00 
and Negro teachers $20.40 monthly; today white teachers receive $100.00 and Negro teachers $30.00.  In 1934 in Bolivar and Coahoma Counties there were only 51 school buildings for Negro children built to serve as schools; but 175 schools 
were being housed in churches, tenant cabins, lodges and other makeshifts.  In 
these privately owned buildings there is no school equipment.  In Bolivar County 
110 of the 147 schools for Negro children, and in Coahoma 56 of the 70 schools 
are one-teacher schools.

The Negro birth rate has been increasing in both counties since 
1933.  It was 21.0 in Coahoma in 1933, and 22.9 in 1937.  In Bolivar it was 
17.7 in 1933 and 19.0 in 1937.  The still birth rate has been decreasing.  In 
Coahoma it was 58 per 1,000 live births in 1933, and 55.2 in 1937.  These two 
counties, with their planter population, have the lowest mortality rates
