The bed shakes and squeaks 
I have been packing for 3 
days; I guess that's it. I 
want to see you so badly.
It is hot and very still. There 
are goblins out tonight. In 
the morning I will wake up 
with my hair all tiny matted
snarls where they have ridden 
across me on their brown, 
tanglefooted horses. [A] Crosses
chalked on the door and window
would keep them out but a 
proud heather must suffer for 
his freedom. Write me letters.
Love, Bess
