Sept 29 - 1939

My dear Mr. Lomax,

I am sorry I cannot
match you in immediacy of response.
Thank you for your quick
letter re "Whiskey Johnny." I have just
written to Mr. Landbury asking him
his his permission to publish. I first
saw it in his "Songbag" and completely
forgot about it. I hope he
doesn't send me on to Robert Frost
from whom he had it. I have been 
out  of town until this week and missed
the musicological congress and 
especially your recital. My
daughter heard you at Sara Lawrence College.
I have an amusing and somewhat
sorry tale to tell you someday about
Dick Maitland and the letter A. Not
"Adultery" as for Hester Prynne but
Alcoholic Ward as in Sailor's Sung Harbor.

Very truly,
Nelson Sprackling
