nothing wrong with him mentally or was insane. He
was just fed up with not being able to do things.
Lomax: Did you know cases like this? I mean that happened
in your own time?
Robts: Yeah. Oh yeah. I've known quite a few.
Lomax: Do you remember one that you could tell us about?
Robts: Not necessarily in my own village. Well, I knew one
man who was a boat builder, and he used to design
his own boats, build 'em, launch 'em himself, and 
he had no sons, so his wife used to help him. His
wife used to come and hold the various tools you
know that held the planks and timbers in place
while he fastened them, and so on; and he built
some remarkably stout boats on the Suffolk coast.
They were heavy but suitable for any weather. He
was proud of his baots - everyone who wanted a boat
used to go to him and say, "I want one of your
baots." He was the chap to build them. Well, he was
proud of them, proud of the reputation he had. Well,
when he got old, he found he couldn't hold the plank
up, he'd got no sons to help him, and there was no
question of unemployment in those days -- there was
never any unemployed, everyone had a job you see;
other people's dons worked for their own fathers,
or worked with their own fathers, or started up
on their own. So, the poor old chap, he couldn't
hold the planks up, his wife got too old to come
out and help him, and people would come to him and 
say, "I want you to build a boat for me." He'd try
and then found he couldn't do it, or couldn't finish
it, he got fed up and said, "I'm going in the shed
for the last time." and there was the boat he was 
trying to build. He couldn't finish it, - he knew the
timber was too heavy for him to lift, so he took
the knife that he used to scrape edges of timber with,
and cut his throat in the shed. He wasn't going to
stand there and see the boat not finished.
Lomax: God damn!
Robts: There was nothing wrong with him mentally. You
might say the day he -- unbalanced mind, and so on --
he wasn't. When he couldn't do it any more, he wasn't
just going to lie by and -- didn't want to do that. And
that was the general tendency.
