Adventures-Sheldon 4

While they grow popular once lying in bed
The devil keeps us workin' in a Texas Land.
"Texas is Texas anyway you fix it;
Whiskey is whiskey any way you mix it."

"You're damned tootin'," retorted the cowboy.

The little boy cutting up dry brush into short sticks for kindling wood looked
up at me as I came to a cabin in the Bandera Mountains west of San Antonio, Texas.

"Yes-sir, my father is at home," he replied to my question. Marvin Hunter had
told me that Elmo Newcomer could riddle more cowboy breakdowns in genuine cowboy style 
than any other man who lived in th[e]is eddy of civilization framed by the surrounding hills.
There stood Elmom in the doorway, a spare, typical mountaineer.

"I'm John Lomax"-- I began.

"The feller who got up the cowboy songs?" he interrupted. When I assented, without
another word he led me to a corner of the room wher4 he had nailed in a triangular small
? shelf. On this shelf, making a pile four or five inches thick, lay a first edition of
Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads. No two leaves were fastened together, though the
entire book was there, even the introductory pages and the half covers, stained from the
touch of many hands.

"That's my library. My children have been raised on them songs. The neighbors have
worn the book out, always borrowing it.

"Nearly thirty years ago a boy friend and I read about this book in the Texas
Cattleman. We cut and sawed wood for money to pay for it. Then when he moved away I bought his share. Won't you have a chair?"

Until near midnight Elmo Newcomer, surrounded by his family, part of the time with
with a baby on his lap, drew magic music with his homely fiddle and flying bow. In between
bars he would ahout out cattle calls, initate the cries of a panther or the whoops of wild
Apaches. His dance calls, also interspersed with the music, gave directions in rhymed couples
Finish ? song and [prolonged?] "Rye Whiskey" ? one brown snow ?:
"A good ? of whiskey wants [to?] me ? ?;
I wish I had a ? as long as my arm"
