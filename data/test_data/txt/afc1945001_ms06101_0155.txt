"The Government is throwing the whole economic system out of balance
with the high wages they are offering in their war plants. People
are going out and getting several times more money than they ever
made before in their lives by working the Government plants. The
independent businessman can't run a business on the kind of economy
used in the Government business. It's going to be mighty hard to
get people back to normal." Topeka Kansas 8-4 57
