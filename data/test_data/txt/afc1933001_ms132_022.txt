Folk Music Enlivens
Keating Luncheon

Mr. and Mrs. Keating always
plan some sort of an interesting
program for their breakfasts, and
yesterday was no exception. Olam
Lomax, who has charge of the
folk music archives at the Library
of Congress, and John Vance, law
librarian at the library, sang a
number of songs from collections
they have made of American folk
lore, accompanying themselves on
their guitars.

Wilbur Hubbard, who comes
from Maryland, told several 
amusing anecdotes collected on
the Eastern Sho'. With Mrs.
Keating acting as mistress of
ceremonies, several prominent
Senators made amusing and to-
the-point speeches. These included
Senator Alva Adams, Senator
Ernest Lundeen, Senator
Homer T. Bone, Senator Kenneth
McKellar, Senator Edwin C. Johnson,
Senator Hattie Conway,
Representative James M. Mead,
and Mrs. Harry Blair.

The guests were seated at a
number of small tables, centered
with spring flowers, from the garden
of Mrs. Oswald Svchuette,
one of those present. She had
discovered on a shopping tour the
quaint little holders in which the
flowers were placed.

Senator and Mrs. Adams were
accompanied by their daughter,
Mrs. Joseph Uhl, of Pueblo, Colo.,
who is visiting them. Another
out-of-town visitor at the breakfast
was Mrs. William H. Alexander,
of Pennsylvania, a retiring
vice president of the D.A.R. She
has been asked to become chairman
of the Women's Division of
Chatauqua.

Mr. Keating is editor of Labor,
the weekly newspaper. Colorado 
was formerly his home.
