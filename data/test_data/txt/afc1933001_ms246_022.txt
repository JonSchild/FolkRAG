of mining, the [?] stories and legends
from the Days of Forty Nine on down to
the present.
Under your most recent instructions
I ought to get a lot 
of good stories.  Woody's bunch
sound most hopeful.  I hope some of 
them have a small vein of
Woody running through their make-up.
Pampa is northwest of Amarillo
a fur piece from Dallas (500 miles).  I'll try
to uncover some characters comin'
and gwine.
1.  I'll need 2 cutting needles
2.   "     "      20 or twenty-five records.  I have
reserved only the first shipment
3.  Give me orders about paying performers
who are poor or who expect pay like
the Mexican family of nine children 
to whom I must send - each of them - 
a Christmas present. 
I can't go to Pampa until after Christmas. 
Don't get yourself  criticized on account
of my slowness or inefficiency
I'll send in the machine at any time
you say. 

Lovingly, 
Father
