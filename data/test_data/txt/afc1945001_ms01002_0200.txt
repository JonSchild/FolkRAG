MEMORANDUM

To:                   R. Keith Kane, Assistant Director
From:              Cornelius DuBois, Executive Assistant

The radio people are still bombarding Katz and
Swords for rumor material to broadcast. Both of
them and myself think that no rumor material
should be broadcast.

Can we get together and settle the policy on
this?
