     An old coon is a mighty smart animal, isn't he?
     Coons are real smart. They get into a lot of water, and they pull a 
lot of tricks. They're a real smart animal, pullin' their tricks and 
everything.
     Don't they sit out there in the middle and let the dogs come to 'em
at times?
     Oh yeah, they sit out in that water sometimes and . . .             get on a 
log or somethin' . . .
     What happens then?
     They can just about whip a dog out in the water
     They do.
     . . .                jump on the side of 'em.
     You mean they jump right on the dog?
     Right on the dog's head, get on him and whip him. Try to . . .
him anyway. If you got a good dog, well, he can handle him, but if you
don't have one that's real experienced and knows what he's doin', well,
the old coon might get the best of him.
     What are some of the other  tricks? I understand they can actually
dive, can't they, I mean they can stretch out their legs and kind of
dive-- they can jump out of a tree real high?
     Yeah, when they come out of a tree . . .                      they can sail way
out . . .                                lot of times get wet from 'em. And most of the
time when they're comin' out of a  tree, if there's a stream of water
around, lotta times  they'll try to get up a tree where there's a 
stream of water, you know, real close by, and that's what they jump for
when they come out of a tree is that water. They hit the water when
they come out of a tree, and then they can a lotta times get away from
