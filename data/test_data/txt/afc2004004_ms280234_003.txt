have him," she says, "as my busband."
      "Ob," he says, "Don't think on the like of that. You know
you're a lady - a young lady that doesn't know your riches, and
this a poor boy off the road lookin for work. I kept him only
for a week."
"It doesn't matter," she says. "If I don't have him as my
husband - when he's away, I'll be going with him."
He joined to scratch his head, he joined to mourn, he joined to
cry and he didn't know what to do, and he was very sorry for
taking the boy about the house. So he called for the coachman.
He says, "I'm in great trouble this morning. I kept that boy that
you see there to give him a week's work and rest his feet, and
my young lady has fell in love with him this morning, and what
will I do ? If he goes, she'll be with him."
"Well, it's a very bad case," the coachman says. "But maybe th
boy is wealthy at home. You wouldn't know. He might be a match
for any girl."
"Well, the only thing we can do," the millionaire says, says
he, "You get ready in the morning, get your horse ready and go
to where the boy comes from and see how he lives at home. And
if he lives well at home I'll surely agree and get them both
married. But," he says, "If he's a poor boy, I wouldn't like to
see my daughter married to that boy."
     The coachman didn't like to do any harm to the boy - it made
no difference to him. He got the horse in the morning and off he
went, and he never told the boy where he was going. On he went
until he came to the boy's home, the wee sod house, and he had
to cross the moor where there was no road, do you see. He was
up to the neck crossing into the moor, as for the wee sod
house, it was all reek when he come in, and the reek was coming
out the door, and it was just a wonderful looking place to
be living.
     So the coachman steps in and he bid the old man time of day. 
What was the old man doing but just taking his dinner out of
the ashes. He was toasting the praties, and he had the salt on
his knee, and he was peeling the praties. The goats was at the
door and he was throwing the skin to the goats and the goats was
picking them up. So he stood up and looked around and saw the
house was made of sods and he wondered much at it. So he said
nothing and he stepped out again. He had the whole token of
the house and that was all he wanted. So he went away again.
The old man conveyed him to the door.
     On he went until he came to the castle, back again, and there
was a long wait on him to see how did the boy live at home. The
millionaire was waiting very impatiently to see was there good
news about how the boy lived. So the coachman said to himself,
"I'm going to do that young feller no harm. Makes no difference
to me."
"Well, ye got back," he says.
"I did."
