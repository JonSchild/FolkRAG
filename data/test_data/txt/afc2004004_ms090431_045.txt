Fisk,12. 6.
worked there I think a little better'n a month, clearin the bushes
and everything. Pretty soon they run out. I caught a few ties,
but I toted the water most after the bushes run out. I never
cautched many ties. Well, then the e[a]xe fell. When the axe fell[m],
he cut me off.
A: What do you mean, the axe fell?
B: Wel, that means the allowance. Yo see, he gets a allowance
every month, every month he gets a new alowance. The allowance
lets him work ten men this month, ma[b]ybe ten men the next month,
maybe the next month the allowancesay ten men, maybe the next month
the allowance say eight men. Well, that so, two men's gotta
come off. Well, he cut off the two of the youngest men, see?
Well, he told me I wasa young man, I hand't worked for very long;
I didn't know much to do -- I got cut off.
Well myself and them, we went back to Memphis, and they played
around in one or twolittle nightclubs and things. Well, then I
got a chance to be a gambler. I stuck on with them and gambled,
and they carried me to one or two [partied] harvests, and I found out I could
pick berriesand things like that. Well I just run then from
berry harvest to sugarbeet harvest to grain harvest back on around
the river until, and on the railroads backwardsa d forwards. We
never stayed in one place. I'd be follwoing them, too, you know,
together.until '29, March the 2o. I started working for Mr.
Bailey, H. Bailey, but I'dwork with the foreman, you know. But
I'd never work more'n two months or three months or something like
that. And so after I started working for M.r Bailey, I worked
for him from '29 up until '36. Then I quit and went to Mr. Clock?
A: Didn't you getmarried about '29?
