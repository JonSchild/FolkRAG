OVER ALL THE LANDS                                                      -10-
(Anvil Chorus - Page 12 - New Brown Book - C.C. Birchard Co.)

Over the prairies and over the mountains
And up from the cities that fron the sea,
Out from the mills and the mines and the forests
Is rising the call that shall set men free.

Chorus:
Over all the lands it sounds,
And over all the waters,
Earth and the fruits of earth
For all her sons and daughters,
No more each for each alone
But undivided, with heartd decided,
We rise to claim our own.

Men in the grip of the farm and the factory, 
Women and drudges of kitchens and mill
Children bereft of the playtime of childhood
Have claimed for their children the promise still.

Chorus:

Circled by hope and by hatred the Russian
Still flings forth his flag in the fozen north
Southward the castle - ridden riots of India,
Even to them has the word gone forth.

Chorus:

Eastward the back-broken four hundred million
Have cast off their patience to front the sun
White men and black men and brown men and yellow
Are shouting at last that all toil is one.

Chorus:
Brothers shall build us the homes that we dwell in 
And brothers shall till for our food that soil
Brothers in freedom shall meet with each other,
With gladness exchanging the fruits of toil.

Chorus:

Brothers shall meet in the council of peoples,
With old hates forgotten and war-flags furled,
Brothers shall build us the ships and the railroads,
The bind us together around the world.
