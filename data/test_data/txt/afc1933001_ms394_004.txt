Adventures- Preface     3

Alas, also, what I did set out for readers would be subject to the
same uncertain fate of the two extra grains of corn. Many  chances were against
me then,- drouth, which perched the plants, storms that blew them flat; sometimes
we even gathered no corn at all, however carefully we tilled our field.

I have lost some of the confident hope of the barefoot boy who
could see two of the seed grow into kingly stalks burdened with hanging ears
of corn. A ballad collectore meets so many people, the real people, plain, raw
people, devoid of tinsel or glamor,- some beautifully kindly, some base, a
few suspicious and surly,- but all with veneering so thin that one can easily
see the motives of their simple being, if he has any writing gift whatever.
A ballad collector should be able to uncover some worthwhile stories. So--
I've made another book.

In Texas we called land that was cultivated the first time "new-[grows] ground".
On such fresh land a first year crop was usually latge. One virtue
at least I can claim for this book: it attempts to cultivate new-ground.
