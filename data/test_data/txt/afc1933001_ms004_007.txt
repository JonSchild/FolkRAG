My dear Mr. Lomax:

This much I can report:
1) the money for the purchase of a recording machine, not to cost more than about five hundred dollars, is available;
2) Mr. Garwick (whom you saw in New York) has left the Fairchild Co. and is working on a machine which is to weigh considerably less than the Fairchild model, and has assured me that, equipped with every possible improvement, it will not cost more than $500.

I hope to see Mr. Garwick in New York about June 5 or 6, when I expect to have more definite news for you.

Faithfully,
Chief, Division of Music
