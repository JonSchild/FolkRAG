My dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter dated Jan. 10th in re: to making record
of Old Paint, just received.

I do not know of anyone I would rather make this record 
of Old Paint, unless it is: Uncle Sam and Mr. John A. Lomax.

I do not know what kind of an outfit Mr. Myers  has, in
Amarillo, but I have heard, that he makes records.

The first time I'm in Amarillo, I shall make the record
for you, and do so with pleasure, and will make same, without any
acc. as you suggest.

Yours very truly,
[*Jess Morris*]
