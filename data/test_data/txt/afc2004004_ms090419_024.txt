The animals have a convention and they was all in when
the rabbit come in. It was late and it was crowded and there wasn't
no seat in there but next to the hound. The flies was bad and bothered
the hound and, you know, the hound would snap at um. The rabbit
would jump down off his seat every time the hound would snap.
"Mister Rabbit, " they say, "Keep your seat. You's late already and
you gonna get fined directly."
He says,"All right. But I motion you put a muzzle on this
gate mouth son of a bitch 'fore he makes somebody hurt theirselves."

over there to git him some water. He got him a drink of water and
he noticed her washing and not paying him any attention, so he
slipped up behind her and when he had what he wanted, he thought he'd
slip off. But she hollered and told him, say, "Mister, I washes here
