Dear Mr. Lomax,

I am afraid it is not going to be possible for me to
get down to Washington despite the fact I am so close.  The job I am
doing here at the Council this summer is not going to leave me any
time, I am afraid, for side trips, since I must finish it by the first
of September when we sail for Europe for a year.

Is there any chance of your being in New York before
the end of August?  We are living just across the river at the address
typed in above and I can be reached either here, or in the event you
should come suddenly when the office is closed, at home.  Just in case
this should happen, the telephone number at the house is: 

Cliffside 6-0060.

When I get back I will probably accept your very kind
offer to arrange to have some duplicates of the Haiti letters made
available to me.  My own records have gone to Europe to be transcribed,
but for purposes of instruction they are so crude - having been taken
on cylinders - that they are quite useless.  Naturally, if you do your
book on Haiti I shall be more than glad to help you in any way I can.

Yours sincerely,
[* Melville J. Herskovits *]
