Macpherson( contd.) 

an outlaw and he stole sheep and cattle and gave it to the 
poor people. They couldn't get near him, you see, 
so he kept them away with a guard, with his sword and 
this woman [was washing blankets on the top and he was
beside the window, anent the window, as it were. That 
woman] dropped a blanket on top of his head - a wet
blanket - [it was a soaked blanket] - and afore he could 
get the blanket off, [they rocked and] they collared him. 
The Laird o' Grant and all this laird's farmers, they 
collared him and handcuffed him and he was tried before 
the Sheriff at Banff. [*45 secs. Then script*] 

At that time Banff had independence; at that time they 
could hang a man. A Sheriff could sentence to death 
at that time. They had the power - a Sheriff himself, 
but they lost that and it is about four or five years 
since they got back their rights. They lost their  
rights after that. The town of Banff, you see.
They got back their rights about six years ago. 
It is what it was before. And he was tried and executed 
in the open. He was a great fiddler - he could 
play a violin. And he was hung in the open by a cart. 
They took the cart up on the Gallows Hill. There is 
a street there that you come down past it, that street 
in Banff. He was hung in a field between two carts

                  hands up to ten o'clock and he was hanged. 

                  And this reprieve was put back to Aberdeen on horseback, 
                  and this horse dropped dead at the Bridge o' Banff, yonder 
                  on the top of the same bridge; it is about 400 years old, 
                  yon bridge, and he ran all the way up town but he was too 
                  late - four or five minutes late - or early - he would
