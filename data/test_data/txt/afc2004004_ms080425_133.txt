speaks of dancin'. And it didn't particularly say square dancin' but
it's just a, it's just a amusement, just entertainment, that's all it
is. If you want to make somethin' out of it, now they make
somethin' out of ball games now, the thing is that's not right.
What about bluegrass, do you like bluegrass.
Oh, they're very smooth. Yes, sir, I sure do. I like it. I like
bluegrass music.
Do you like old ...           Did you ever hear of this man?
...
Who?
John ...     
Oh, yeah, yeah. I've heard his band. Now....
he was the leader of our band at that point, and he was a real
musician. He knew, he knew music. He played it by ...      music,
he read the music, played it as ...       Of course he could play
by ear too. But most of the band, lots of 'em, the biggest majority of 'em,
unless they're professional, I mean orchestras and things like that, they'd
play by ear.
Who is this man William Dillon(?) Do you know anything about him?
Uh, really I don't know ...      but really I don't know. He's
a musician, I can say that. He was a musician.
Do you like his songs?
Yeah, I sure do, he's got some good songs on the Sacred Harp.
What's about your favorite song, would you say? I mean, the one
that you always sing the most or think of the most. If you have one.
Well, that would be hard for me to say. There's plenty of 'em.
You know, I like all kinds of music, I like major music and minor music, too.
