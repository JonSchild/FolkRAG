4&5) The tubes were bought as spares in
expectation of a breakdown far from any
radio shop or from a shop where the necess-
ary tubes could be bought. I have wasted 
days at a time in the field waiting for
tubes to be sent to me.
8) The old pick-up or reproducing-head
was always the worst feature of the Thomp-
son recorder because it simply would not
track on aluminum records. It skipped
grooves whenever the total volume in the
sound track jumped suddenly and has often
caused me to surse the day I ever was born.
9 & 12) The two batteries were expensive
because they are not ordinary automobile
batteries, which discharge in a very few
hours and are otherwise generally unstable,
but are capable of giving more hours of
steady power. They are not essential in
the United States because there one is al-
ways near a garage and charging is rela-
tively inexpensive, but here when I am back
in the mountains somewhere and my batteries
go dead, it means hours on horseback and
then more by automobile to the nearest gen-
erator.
I hope this explanation is satisfactory and
not too long-winded and boring. At least I
can assure you that the machine makes the
highest quality aluminum records I have yet
heard.
I have encountered a few unexpected diffi-
culties here. The Haitian government, be-
cause of the yellow journalism that Sea-
brook and other foreigners have indulged in,
is naturally wary of visiting ethnologists
and others of that ilk. If I had gone di-
rectly to work, making records,

Dear Dr. Putnam,

Perhaps an explanation of the sizeable bill
from the Sound Specialties Company is forthcoming, since it
was somewhat larger than the original estim-
ates. I enclose my copy with each item numbered
and shall forthwith explain the items one by
one where explanation is called for.
1) The turntable unit( comprising the converter,
the turntale motor, the cutter and mechanism,
the pickup) had given a year and a half of ser-
vice under trying conditions without being
touched; it deserved a complete overhaul, greas
ing and cleaning. The amplifier formerly con-
sisted of two parts. These were combined with
considerable saving in weight and with the ad-
dition of power and better quality.
2) The new cutting head was an absolute es-
sential if I hoped to be able to record drum
music. The old cutter, as I had discovered in
the Bahamas, would not serve to record drum
music,and,since le tambour is the national in-
strument, I though it best to take advantage
of the obvious improvement Thompson has made in
his cutters. I might add that the records I
have so far made are the best from the point
of view of quality and low surface noise I
have ever made, that is, considering the acous
tic conditions.
