Dear Mr. Lomax:

I enclose another carbon copy of my letter to
Professor Lomax, and the original of his reply; also
a carbon copy of my biography of the Mayos to give
you some notion of how short a Reader's Digest article
really is.

I suppose my letter to Professor Lomax referring
to material "scheduled for your autobiography" made
it abundantly clear that I had the "Ballad Hunter"
material in mind.

I also wrote him: "If you have any other terms or
conditions in mind, I'd be glad to hear from you." that
still stands. I hesitate to suggest any cash payment, because
I've never done so before; but if you're thinking
along those lines, let's talk it over.

Sincerely,
Ed B.
