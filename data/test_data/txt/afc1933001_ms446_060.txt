45
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I fain would weep--but what of tears?
     No tears of mine could e'er recall them;
Nor would I wish that grov'ling cares.
     No cares like mine should e'er befall them.
They rest in realms of light and love,
     They dwell upon the Mount of Glory;
They bask in beams of bliss above,
     And shout to tell their happy story.

I heard them bid the world adieu,
     I saw them on the rolling billow;
Their far-off home appeared in view,
     While yet they pressed a dying pillow.
I heard the parting pilgrim tell
     While passing Jordan's stormy river,
"Adieu to earth, for all is well,
     Now all is well with me forever."

O, how I long to join their wing,
     And range their field of blooming flowers;
Come, holy watchers, come and bring
     A mourner to your blissful bowers.
I'd speed with rapture on my way,
     Nor would I pause at Jordan's river;
With songs I'd enter endless day,
     And live with my loved friends forever.

No. 45

My little flock, I bid adieu,
     Our parting is today;
O, may we all to Christ prove true,
     And try to watch and pray.

There is one thing that wounds my heart,
     And grieves my heart full sore;
To think we must in body part,
     Perhaps to meet no more.

And if we never meet below,
