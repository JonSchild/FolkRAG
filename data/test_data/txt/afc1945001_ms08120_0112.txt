Grandfather's Story

My grandfather used to tell of
a strange adventure which had. He
and some other boys had been spearing
fish by torchlight in the clear lake.

They started back home about
midnight, and had walked nearly a
mile through the woods. Suddenly
they seemed to hear an army
marching, were giveing commands; the
men were keeping step; the wagons were
rattling along. What could it be? All
the boys heard the noise, but could see
nothing. Gradually the sounds grew
fainter, and then ceased. The boys
were afraid and ran home to tell
their parents what they had heard.
The next day they learned that Fort
Sumter had been fired upon, the
Civil war had begun.
