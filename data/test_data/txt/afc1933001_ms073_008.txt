Mr. John A. Lomax

Dallas, Texas

Dear John:

Very glad to receive your letter of the 1st inst.

In regard to the suit which was lost many years
ago, I had forgotten all about it, and I certainly
would not care to open the matter again. However, 
I appreciate very much your thoughtfulness in
writing me about it. 

I note from your letter that you have done an 
enormous amount of travelling; I hope you have
enjoyed it

With best wishes, I am
                                                       Sincerely yours, 
                                                           Bill
                                                       William F. Krahl

I suppose the only way, as the late date, 
to square this matter is for me to make
the luckless suit loser a nice present. Do
you happen to recall his name? As you 
were still working for the firm all
the responsibility is mine.
F.
