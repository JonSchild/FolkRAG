THE BLA CK BALL LINE

Leader: I served my time on the Black Ball Line
Chorus: To my way-yah, horrah!
Leader: In the Black Ball Line I served my time
Chorus: Hurrah for the Black Ball Line

Once there was a Black Ball Ship
That fourteen knots an hour could clip    &c.

You will surely find a rich gold mine
Just take a trip on the Black Ball Line   &c.

Just take a tripmto Liverpool
To Liverpool, that Yankee school     &c.

The Yankee sailors you' ll see there
With red top boots and short cut hair    &c.
