Mr. Cornel Lengyel
WPA Music Project
San Francisco, California.

Dear Mr. Lengyel:

I want to express to you my admiration for the
excellent work that your project has done in the preparation
of the first two volumes of History of Music in San Francisco
Series.  Not only will these books prove to be valuable in
reference work but they will besides, make good reading for
a long time to come.  I should be very grateful if the 
Archive of American Folk Songs were put on your mailing list,
and if it were possible for you to supply it with the two
volumes already published.

I hope that the series will be continued and that
at some point an entire volume might be devoted to personalities
of the persons who composed the miners ballads.  There certainly
must be more background material available than you were able
to include in those two volumes.  Sidney Robertson, who is
recording songs for the WPA under sponsorship, tells me that
she has already accumulated a good deal of this kind of material:
a joint publication might be most profitable.  On November 14
I am presenting a program on Songs of the Gold Rush Period on
the American School of the Air for CBS.  The songs to be used are
mostly those found in Put's Songsters.  Is there anything known
about the person who compiled songsters under this pseudonym?
Was he author himself or merely compiler? Was he a singer or 
merely some employee of Appleton Company?  Any information you can
supply me on this mysterious individual I should deeply appreciate.

Sincerely Yours,


Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
