DINK

     Years ago while teaching English at the Agricultural and Mechanical 
College of Texas, Professor James C. Nagle, the head of the Civil Engineering
Department, served as supervising engineer for a levee which was being thrown 
up just across the Brazos River from College Station. One Saturday he invited
me down to record the singing of the Negro workers building the levee.
There I met Dink of Mississippi, the "woman" of one of the mule skinners.
     I found Dink wasking her man's clothes outside their tent on the banks
of the Brazos River in Texas. many other similar tents stood around. The 
black men and women they sheltered belonged to a levee-building outfit from
the Mississippi River, the women having been shipped from Memphis among with
the mules and the iron scrapers (for moving the dirt) while the men all skillful
levee builders came from the Vicksburg section. A white foreman volunteered:
"Without women of their own, these levee negroes would have been all, over
the bottoms every night after other women. That would mean trouble, serious 
trouble. Negroes can't work when sliced up with razors". The two groups of
men and women never had seen each other until they met in Texas where the white
lebee contractor gave them the same opportunity presented to Adam and Eve-
they were left alone to mate after they had looked each other over. They women
kept the tents and cooked while the men built the levee.
      Down on the dumps nearer the river, clouds of drifting dust swirled from
the feet of moving mules and from piles of shifted earth, while the shouts of
the mule-skinners sometimes grew into a group of words with a semi-tune:
                    "I looked all over the whole corral,
                     Lawd, I couldn't find a mule wid his shoulder well".
     But Dink, reputedly the best singer in the camp, would give me no songs.
