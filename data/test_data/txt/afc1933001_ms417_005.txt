-3- One Big Union

But cars come and cars went, and I spent 4 of the hardest days 
and nights you ever seen, out rambling around in that cold weather 
and rain, and the March wind ... and one night about midnight I 
fell off of a freight train and the town was Tuscon, Arizona. I 
hadn't eaten for two days and three nights, and I was so weak and so 
dadgum shaky, that all of the hoboes noticed it. And they all said, 
Man's a dam fool to go so long without eatin'.

About nine o'clock next morning, I was setting on the rails of 
a side switch, looking so fagged out that it attracted the attention 
of all of the 'bos. Pretty soon one came over and set down 
beside me and said, What the heel's the matter with you, boy? Hungry? 
How long's it been since you et? Listen, they's a big church 
over on the other side of town that is feeding 'em. I done been 
out a hittin' back doors, got a fine breakfast, but it took a long 
time. You can light out for that church --- if you dont like to 
hit the back doors. Dont be bashful, hell's bells, Man's a dam fool 
to go hungry when they got too much stuff to eat in this old world. 
Go ahead, get up. Go find that Church.

So up I got. I was so dadgum shakey, I shook worse than 
a pecan tree in a high wind. But --- I'd seen plenty of guys on 
the roads shake worse than that.

First church I went up to was a Baptist church, and I went to 
the back door. I knocked on the screen door, and a negro maid 
come to the door. I told here I was a willing to do some work for 
something to eat and she said, You better git on 'way fro here, 
de minister dont like to have no bums a knockin' on his back do', 
better git on 'way from here ... he might come out here any minute, 
and he'd see you here, and call the police wagon.
