1948

     During the year, news was received of the sudden death
on January 27 of John A. Lomax, Honorary Curator of the Archive of
American Folk Song. Mr. Lomax had during his lifetime contributed
greatly to the recorded collections of the Archive, depositing 
virtually all his field recordings with the Library, and through
his publications and also stimulated a wide interest throughout
the nation in the subject of folksong. Born in Mississippi and
raised in Texas, he specialized in the collection of folk songs from
the South, visiting penitentiaries, outlying farms, cotton plantations
and isolated mountain districts.
     It was appropriate that on his 80th birthday, September 23,
1947, he was honored with a celebration by former students and associates,
a fitting tribute and climax to a pioneer career. Among Mr. Lomax's
publications, the following books are of special interest: Cowboy Songs
and other Frontier Ballads, American Ballads and Folk Songs, Our Singing 
Country, and his autobiography, Adventures of a Ballad Hunter.
