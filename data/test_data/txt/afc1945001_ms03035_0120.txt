Rumor:   On Saturday, October 10, at approximately 1 p.m., a customer of a
                 small establishment remarked to a sales clerk that America was losing 
                 this war fast; that all the talk about our cooperation with England
                 was unfounded; that the English and Americans were not cooperating; that 
                 the public was not given half the facts regarding our defeats. He stated 
                 that thru letters from friends and relatives who went overseas and in 
                 positions in Washington claim that this was mostly due to the difference 
                 between our higher civil officials and Army officers. These officers who were
                 approximately 10,000 strong in Washington and about 70% of them arm-
                 chair-pencil-pushers who never saw any actual service knew little or
                 nothing regarding how the war should be won or otherwise. These 70% being 
                 in position to dictate to industry and higher ranking Army officers has 
                 created an ill will and lack of morale between these two all-important 
                 bodies. Therefore hampering the old combat men from performing their 
                 duties as they should be in time of war. The claim is that this 70% is 
                 past clothing clerks, grocery store managers, etc., who merely got their 
                 Army rating thru their college degree only.
