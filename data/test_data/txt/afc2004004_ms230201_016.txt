Sib:          
O yeah, I have, Natchez.  I have to admit it.

Natchez:  
Is that what they call it in Paducah? Shootin' craps?

Sib:          
Shootin' craps.  That's right.

Natchez:  
You ever been locked up in jail for shootin' craps?

Sib:
Of course I have. 

Natchez:  
Been in jail for shootin' craps. 

Sib:          
Yeah, An' you know, Natchez, [we used to have a] my uncle
taught me a song to shoot craps by. He say it was from 
the levee camps...
        I shot 'leven dollars,
        Call the point black nine,
        Up comes the trey
        And the twelve comes flyin'...
        Say, O boys, can't you line it?...

Natchez:  
You go that a little wrong. You mean---
        Up comes the trey,
        And the six spot comes flyin'...

Sib:  
Yeah, yeah, I did make a little mistake there

Natchez:  
I 'member there was one old holler we used to sing at the
mules all day long, [callin'] workin' with them slips
an' scoops an' things---
        Well, I'm here today, O--- Lord,
        But tomorrow I may be gone. 
        Yes, I'm here today----
        But tomorrow gone. 

The Kid:  
Yeah, that's right, Natchez.  An' there was one song we used
 to sing down around Memphis, which was levee camp 
 headquarters---
        I'm going to Memphis, when I make parole,
        Stan' on the levee an' watch the big boats blow.

Natchez:  
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
