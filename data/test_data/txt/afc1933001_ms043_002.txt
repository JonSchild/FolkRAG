Dear Mr. Lomax,
     When Lillie arrived yesterday with her 'Edison wind up', as she expressed it
I said 'The Lomaxes must be on the way'.  We want you to come when you can 'get sent'
but I have been really glad the fates didn't send you the past two months.  Everybody
has been sick except Lillie and me, and, as Lillie said, "Miss Jinny, I tell'em at home, us
aint had time to be sick".  My father is now in the hospital for a good rest.  Our nursing
got him up but he needed some pretty trained nurses and the quiet that my boys cheated
him of here.
     I saw Miss Montgomery in Conway for a little while after she had seen you in Columbia.
She was as disappointed as I that your plans hurried you along North.  It is funny
how anxious we get to have you pass on our collections.  Please if (or when) you do come,
bring, as you did before, the ones of the songs I've sent in that you have not already recorded,
and it will then be an easy matter to find the singers.  I am trying to keep a record
of some that may not get get to you for some time.  Lillie gave me one with twenty-nine stanzas
yesterday.  She didn't know I was getting it and occasionally hummed a whole stanza.
     I appreciated your criticisms.  It was an interesting fact that the only thing in my effort
(not effort but attempt) at description that you commented on favorably -- the use of [ter]
terse short little sentences (that I thought I had absorbed from my love of Victor Hugo [(] and
reckon I absorbed from association with some of the natives who talk like Dickens' Jingle!).
-This (shall I say style) was adversely criticized by Miss Montgomery's right hand assistant
(Mrs. DuBose) who wrote me she thought as a contrast to the negro dialect, I should
cultivate (affect) smoothly flowing sentences.  She, of course, was trying to help.  As
a matter of fact 'Style' has never entered into my calculations.  I just concentrate on
seeing what I want to describe and write it down.  There is much to learn.  By the way, she
sent me 'Green Mansions' to read.  I am three hundred years behind with the masters so
have not read any thing in many moons.
     Did Miss Montgomery write to you that Mr. Reid Smith had lost his wife?  Incurable cancer.
It was like you said.
     Write me your wishes and we will arrange the party.  Aunt Hagar comes weekly and
has kept us in cow peas for hoppin-John.  She has been kept pretty busy all winter with
Grans and Great-Grans who will keep coming.---this crop never fails and the harvest time
knows no seasons!
     With our very kindest wishes to you and Miss Tirror and real affection
     The Chandlers
     and
     Lillie
     (and Aunt Hagar too!)
