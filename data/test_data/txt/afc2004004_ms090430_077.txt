regulations. A white officer said:

It just isn't safe for me to go on a plantation to bring
students to school. The landowners show absolutely no
concern and they tell me to let the "niggers" work.

A tenant parent explained:

The children need all the education they can get, but we
need them to help on the farm. If you don't make your crop
the white man will put somebody else here to do the
work. The children go to school when there ain't no work
for them in the fields; but when there is work they has to
stay home and do it.

Lack of adequate clothing and bad weather also contribute to poor
attendance. Recent relief measures have met some of the more urgent of these
needs. Children in need of shoes or clothing have been provided for to some
extent. But since the County provides transportation only for one high school,
the problem of small children getting to the scattered little schools of the
open country in bad weather remains.

The result of poor attendance as well as poor teachers is reflected
in the high percentage of retardation among the students. Seventy-three and
four-tenths per cent of the boys, and 63.5 per cent of the girls are behind
their normal grade. (1) The higher percentage of retarded boys is explained by
the fact that boys generally must stop school early in the spring to do plowing
and other heavy work on the farm. Both sexes enter school at a much
later age than city children, because with homes so far from the school parents
hesitate to send the small children walking four or five miles to school in
the winter.
