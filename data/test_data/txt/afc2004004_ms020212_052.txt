Mr. Alan Lomax
121 West Third Street
New York 11, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I understand that you are attending the Newport Folk Festival
and I know that your sister, Bess Hawes, is planning to join
you in New York and travel up to Newport with you.  Could
you please let me know as soon as possible how many are coming 
in your party so that we can plan accommodations for you and
for your sister, who would like to stay in the same house that 
you do.

Travel expenses and lodging in Newport are paid for by the 
Festival.  In addition you will receive $50.00 as a fee.
Please keep your gas and toll receipts for the records of the
Festival.

We are looking forward to hearing from you shortly.

Sincerely
Joyce Wein
Joyce Wein
