The Kid:  He have that forty-five, that so-called tough guy,
but when the white man come, he whip him with that
forty-five on him.  White man wouldn' have no gun or
nothin'.  He'd just come in an' say, "Lay down there,
fella, I'm gonna whup you."  ([Andxxxx] The Kid speaks
this wearily, quietly, with intense irony)
An' this so-called tough guy would lay down and the
white man would whup him an' just kick the gun
out of his scabbard. . . An' after he get his whuppin',
he just put his gun back in his scabbard and go on
back to work. . .
Natchez:  That's right.
The Kid:  And come on out there on the job and kill one of 
us or somethin' like that. . .
Natchez:  Sho, sho, I've seen that many times. . .
The Kid:  See, if you were a good worker, you could kill anybody
down there, so long as he's colored. . .
Natchez:  What you mean is you could. . .
The Kid:  . . . kill anybody and then go anywhere. . .
Natchez:  What you mean is, you could kill anybody as long as
 you kill a Negro!
[The Kid]
The Kid:  . . .any Negro , if you could work better than him and
 you were sorry.
Natchez: But don' go killin' a good worker!
The Kid:  That's right!
