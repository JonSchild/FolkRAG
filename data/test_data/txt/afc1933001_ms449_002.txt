TOM HIGHT
Tom Hight and I spent two happy days together in a Oklahoma City 
hotel. Tom was made happier, asI am sure I was, but the added presence
of two quart bottles of rye which he consulted frequently between
songs. Tom knew more cowboy melodies that any person that I have ever
found.
"Ever since I was a boy," said Tom, "I have been a singing
fool. I could sing down any man in the cowcamp in the Panhandle. When
the fellows backed me against the neighboring camp, I won. They challenged 
the whole dawn Panhandle. The champions of each camp met at
a central point and we lifted up our heads like a pack of cyotes, only
we lifted em one at a time. The rules were that each man was to sing 
in turn, one after each other, round and round. The man that sung the
last song, won the prize. The other fellows couldn't sing no more,
cause they didn't know anymore songs. It took us mighty near all 
night to get sung out. But I was ready with the last one and had more
to go. Of course, you couldn't no books and no writing. I was mighty
proud of being the champion singer of the Texas Panhandle. My cowboy
friends gave me a pair of silver-mounted spurs for a prize with my name
engraved on them"
