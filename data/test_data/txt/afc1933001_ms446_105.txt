CHORUS 

Oh! my mother, how I miss her, 
Since the angels took her happy soul away; 
In the land of love I'll meet her,
By the throne of God I'll greet her; 
I shall meet my precious mother some sweet day. 

2  

Many loving friends are kind and good to me, 
As the toilsome homeward journey I pursue, 
But I miss my mother as the days go by,
For there is no friend like mother, none so true. 

3 

Swiftly now I pass the milestones one by one, 
By and by the glory gates with joy I'll see; 
Then among rejoicing friends in that sweet home,
Will my own dear mother gladly welcome me. 

No.  12     Precious Memories 

(Used by permission) 

Precious memories, unseen angels, 
Sent from somewhere to my soul; 
How they linger, ever near me,
And the sacred past unfold. 

CHORUS 

Precious mem'ries, how they linger,
How they ever flood my soul; 
In the stillness of the midnight, 
Precious sacred scenes unfold. 

2 

Precious Father, loving Mother, 
Fly across the lonely years;
