A Sailor's Song
Words by RICHARD FARIÑA
Music: Traditional

SLOWLY

All the mon-u-ments stand on the grieving land — For the legions who have
marched a-way. — But the bat-tle-ships roll and the black bells toll, — and to-
CHO:
mor-row-is an-other day. — If you watched the sand sifting through your hand, —
— And the leaves falling down from the trees; — Young A - mer - i - ca's
sons with ther long range guns
Would keep roving — o'er the 
sev - en seas.

At the burial ground hear the bugles sound
For the ashes that would still remain
But the Admirals sail and the widows wail
And tomorrow it will be the same.
(Chorus)

Now the tall fires burn and the loud wheels turn
For the squadrons sleeping in the sand
But the uniforms gleam and the sirens scream
And tomorrow who w ill plow the land?
(Chorus)

On the sorrowing ground where the dark drums pound
For the sailors who will sail no more
All the officers lie and the seamen die
And tomorrow we will talk of war.
(Chorus)

Senator J. W. Fulbright
warned here last night that
"America is showing some
signs of that fatal presumption,
that overextension of power
and mission, which brought
ruins to ancient Athens, to
Napoleonic France and to Nazi
Germany."
