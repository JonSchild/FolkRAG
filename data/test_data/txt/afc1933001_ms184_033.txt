Huntsville, Tex.

Dear Casey Smith:

Don't worry; you will get your records,
and the money too. There isn't any lack 
of cooperation on our part. It's just
that it takes a long time for a government
department to carry out a big publishing 
job such as this one.

I think the money will be paid in
about a week now. For the records you
may have to wait a month or more. They
haven't been published yet; we are just
making the final arrangements now, and 
the manufacturing takes a while.

I am really sorry you have had to
wait so long, but don't get discouraged;
the records will come.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax, Assistant in Charge
