Washington he was, he was great.  He'd never missed that,
he'd never miss his left hand on them.
ANCELET  Well one of the most important
differences between Creole music and, and Cajun music, you
know, black music and white music in Louisiana in, in Creole
music the, the essential thing, the thing that you want to
do with your dancers is to make them jump.  You know, to
make them move.
:  Keep the beat.
ANCELET [UNCLEAR] Whereas what do you
want to do?  What does a Cajun accordian player want to do?
What's, what's the ideal?  What's the most, what's the best
compliment that dancer can pay, can pay an accordian player
if he says your, your music is what?
:  It's [moved] and the beat is right,
don't ever come off a beat.
ANCELET  That's right.
:  And when you start you're going one step
and it keeps on until it's finished. If you got to dance
awhile and all of a sudden you got to stop and listen to the
music and then start again, you're not right.  There's
something wrong there.  So I think a musician, to be a good
one he has to be a good dancer first, you know.  If he's a 
good dancer he knows what the people want.  And if you can
start a dance at the pace that you're going to play, well
