John A. Lomax, Esq.
Wilton, Conn.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Here is an envelope for the unsavory 
songs from Ohio.

Miss Rogers tells me that the mail
you left behind was forwarded to Wilton
shortly after you left. As to the machine
and batteries, these were sent on to you
by express prepaid on February 19. No
doubt you have already received them.

Faithfully,

OS
