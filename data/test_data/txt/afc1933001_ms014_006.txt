University Station,
Austin, Texas.

My dear Mr. Lomax,

You have my profound sympathies. I know only too
well from past experience what you have been through. But the two
operations that I underwent finally made life bearable, at least in
this one respect.

I did not reply to your earlier letter, about
the "Mexican Passion Play" because I did not quite understand
whether or not you would be able to record the whole thing, or
whether there were some written or printed records of it.
Naturally, it would be of interest and value to the Library to
have this play, text and music. And if it is something that you
could record, please let me know when and how you would want to
do it.

Faithfully yours,
