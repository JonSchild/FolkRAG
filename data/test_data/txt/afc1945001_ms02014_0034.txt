Mr. William H. Webber,
CHIEF, INTELLIGENCE DIVISION,
Bureau of Public Inquiries,
Office of War Information, 
1400 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Webber:

This is in compliance with your request for the
names and addresses of the six persons who assisted
us in the rumor collection the week of October 5.

First, we will discuss the question of the efficiency
 of this method of collecting rumors.  If our experience 
in this assignment was indicative of what may 
be expected from volunteer rumor collectors, then we
would say that the method will be far from satisfactory.

 We found that the persons whose help was enlisted 
were willing enough, but that they simply lacked the
training and the basic understanding of the whole war
problem to enable them to do a good and thorough job of
collecting rumors.  For example, we found that some of
the most interesting rumors which they heard they had
not thought as of being rumors at the time, and did not 
put them down.  But, when we conferred with them later
and began questioning them, we dug it out of them.

It is possible that we were unfortunate in our
choice of contacts, but it is our belief that any persons
we would choose would average up about the same.

To repeat what we said in our report on the rumor
survey, we found, for example, that the patrolman 
we had selected was moved over to a night shift and sent
far out in a residential district where he had little
opportunity to get rumors and he was so worried about
his change of job, that he didn't give us anything.
