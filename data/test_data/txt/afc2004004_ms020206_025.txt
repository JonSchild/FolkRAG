Reverend Roe.  Reel .3.  P. 6
we had the old blue-back speller, you know, and I could read [most] just
any book I picked up, you know. That old speller, you know, back there,
you know, it would give you the definition of words, so that's all I
had. I'd see the white boys going to school and lot of [them would] em knowed
[help] me -- [they like] me because was always good-natured. They [would] loved to
play
with me because I was funny and good-natured, and they let me look
at their books, and some of them would show me things in the the books, [and]
things like that. Of course, that helped me, [a good deal] certainly did, and I made
friends with them. They white folks at home [that] as I was telling you
about - Lee, the home where the old lady lived? -- they would never
have a play amongst the white for young folks without inviting me.
I'[d] had to go there [as a serving fellow] to sing for them and help them. Those white boys
and white girls were just as familiar with me as if I'd have been
their brother. I've known when Mrs. Lee would send me in the girls' room
to make Molly get up to come and cook breakfast. Yes sir, I went in
there and [go'd up so] got after Molly, and Molly'd say, "Get out!" She'd be
hitting me, and I'd grab her [by the leg] arm and pull her out the bed and
run. All [fair's] passed off in fun, you know. She knew I meant no harm, and they
know'd me. Yes sir, I was just like one of the family.
