Tony W. a comic - caperer -
Joe Schelestick {a cream buyer
& pale longnosed wife} let
me record in his house - a
blond, curly haired - none of
these poles speak or understand
any too much English -
they appreciate as new such
hoary tales as "What did the
monkey say when he got his
tail in the lawn-mower."
They find it practically impossible
to translate Polish
even so much as song
titles --They are extreme --
