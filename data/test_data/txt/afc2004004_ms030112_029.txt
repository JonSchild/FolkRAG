my breakfast, have a little drink sometimes. I feel good. And 
he be hitting every telephone pole that we pass by with a stick. 
[BOWlll] POW deedle, deedle, deeele, POW hit [t]his stick. He
never stopped till he get us down there by the river 
you understand. You know that's a deep river in Augusta, Ga.. 
He stopped you see. He says you see that white oak tree down, 
there, down by the river.  Not that first white oak tree,that
right after that one. He says thats where those god-damn niggers 
hang about in. I started to holler, he said don't you holler and 
can't get you back to the station. He got attached with me, went 
back to the station and I stayed there till next morning, train 
pulled in and we had to pay a dollar to get across the bridge. 
We didn't ride but 17 miles [it was] out of Augusta, Ga. that train costs 
us a dollar. Cause it was a toll trestle. And I got on that little 
station, it was a sandy place you know it had sand all the way around 
looked like a cotton house. Thats where the train stopped 
looked like a cotton house.

GARY:  Yeah. So we started walkin, I got about two miles on the 
other side of Woodlawn station. I felt my feet feeling kind of 
cool, I know I had good shoes on. I knowed I had good shoes 
on. [This] The [hole] sole in my shoe was as thick as my hand that way.
