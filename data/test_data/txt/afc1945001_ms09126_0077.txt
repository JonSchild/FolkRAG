A lady went to the meat market
and asked the butcher for six pounds
of steaks, two pounds of ground beef, five
pounds of lamb chops, and a roast.
Then she told the butcher she
wanted this delivered. The butcher
told her he was sorry. She said,
"Why not, there is the cart sitting
out front." The butcher replied, "I
know it, but you just bought the
horse."
