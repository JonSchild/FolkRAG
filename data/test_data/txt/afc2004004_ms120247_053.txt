How My Drums Were Made

First of all, it is important to realize that
there are many different shapes and sizes of drums in
Haiti. Roughly speaking, I should say that
each type of dancing society has a distinctive
drum or drums, which are regarded as appropriate to
certain dances and to no others. In Leogane, for
example I saw eight different kinds
of drums for as many different societies----this in an area
of four or five square miles----and I was told of several
other societies that I had no time to investigate.
So far as my observation goes, however, the Rada
drum, which might be called the vandou drum since it is the type
used in the most widespread of the vandou cults, is quite
different from all the rest. First of all,
it is the heaviest type of drum that I know of (beyond
the assotor, and this drum has practically passed out of currency
since the coming of the Marines and if it is known
it is rather difficult to find). It is part of the furniture
of the hounfort and is never removed therefrom. Because of
the thickness of the drum walls the skins is pegged to
the head which allows, I believe, for a more accurate
tuning than is the case with the
other types of Haitian drums all of which are drums whose heads are
bound to the top of a shell of wood.

The drums I have deposited are Rada drums: the large
one called mama, the middle one called segon, and the
