Kullgeen, Betty

leaving the harbor at Friday
night 12:00 heading for Tropics
probably Manila. This beauty
parlor girl was sitting in
a tavern or bar room with 
her boy friend & passed it
on to him. Unoticed by
any one a sinister looking 
spy was sitting next to 
them he gave word to a 
german sub. The sub 
probably warned the whole 
fleet. & On (Friday) Saturday about 5:00
in the morning news came 
to Washington that a fleet,
American of course carrying
hundreds of soldiers was 
sunk no survivors. You see 
the minister meaning no harm
said a prayer for the hundreds 
of soldiers with out 
thinking or dreaming a terrible 
rumor would be born
His own son was probably one of the dead.
