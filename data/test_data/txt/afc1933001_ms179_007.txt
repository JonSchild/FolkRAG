Dear Mr. Coleman:

     I am glad that we are a little closer together than we were
last month.  Enclosed is a check which covers the elastic one
you received in December.

     I'd like to close my accounts with you in terms of some
lectures.  I will have the time this spring to give them.
One reason, I believe, that your people have not gone after 
lectures for me during the spring is that I had previously
planned to go to South America.  This didn't work out, however.
You might try for me under the title of "America in the Summer 
of 1941".  During this period we recorded not only music, but
public sentiment over a large section of the country, and the resulting 
records are quite exciting.  We continued this through
the Pearl Harbor period, and are still carrying it on now, following 
public opinion with recording all over the country.
The stuff would make an extremely interesting lecture, I believe.

     I would like very much to get some lectures if you can arrange 
it for me.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
