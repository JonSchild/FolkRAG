V:  When he got all through my bill was thirty five dollars.
Cose that was a whole lot. Thirty five dollars. Cose he come
night and day. Lots of people round there------ if they
have to make trips like that.

A:  Your mother just died then?

V:  She did. She had a light stroke. She was lingerin round eight
years with rheumatism--limbs. Couldnt walk hardly. She was
in that shape a long time.

A:  You were the one that looked after her.

V:  I was. I sholy was. My oldest sister 's dead. And my next
sister  that's married out on the farm now-- You see I always
lived in the town. And uh, she had always ruther be there with
me because I could get sumpindone for her quicker than my other
sister could. So, why I could was because my other sister was
ten miles in the country and so many times it was unconvenient
to get a doctor out there. So she, after she lost her health
for the last eight years, she come to live with me. She'd
go back out there in the summer when she's feelin purty good,
let me rest up some, but she did the bigges of her stayin
there with me. When she had that last stroke, she wasn't sick, she
wasn't down and helpless long before she died. She lingered a 
long time.

A:  I guess it broke you up pretty bad, didn't it?
