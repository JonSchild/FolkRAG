Baton Rouge, Louisiana

My dear Mr. Lomax:

Three days ago, while in New York, I had Mr Garwick show me the machine. He 
tested it thoroughly in my presence, I spoke and sang a few little snatches into 
the mike myself, and gained the impression that, if properly handled, the machine 
should give excellent results.

I was more impressed with the recording on aluminum discs than on celluloid. 
But I understand that the celluloid records have certain advantages over the metal 
ones; they are certainly lighter and probably more easily handled.

I have this morning received a letter with shipping instructions. I am forwarding 
these at once to Mr. Garwick. There remain a few finishing touches to be applied 
to the machine, but he promised to have it ready for shipment by July 3 or 5.  
This should bring it to Baton Rouge in time for your arrival there about July 10. 
I presume that, if need be, you would find there some radio technician or electrician 
who could help you to set up the machine. Mr Garwick intends to send not only full 
directions, but also a wiring plan, so that any mechanician can see at a glance how 
the machine works and where every part can be found. The test records will be sent 
to you in Austin and can probably be forwarded from there. Mr. Garwick's address in 
New York is 250 West 54th Street.

Naturally, I shall be anxious for a word from you that this machine was safely 
received and is giving satisfactory service. With every wish for your enterprise 
and kind regards, I am 

Faithfully yours, 

Chief, Division of Music
