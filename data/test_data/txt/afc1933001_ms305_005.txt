the traditional square dance tunes
and ballads played by the group
come.  Dr. Davis plays the autoharp.
Davy Crockett Ward plays
the second fiddle, his brother, Wade
Ward, plays the banjo, and his son, 
Fields Ward, the guitar. Fields
does most of the calling of figures 
for dance tunes, but the singing
may be handled by Uncle Alec,
Uncle Crockett, Fields, or Wade.

The "Bog Trotters" have played
at the White Top Mountain folk
music festival, and several of its
members, headed by Uncle Alec
Dunford have won individual prizes
there. When it comes to local fiddlers
conventions and folk music
contests, there is scarcely a band
or an individual performer in that
region that can compete with the
"Bog Trotters" and its members.

The Tuesday program in the 
series, Folk Music of America, is
devoted to square dances, and the
"Bog Trotters" and their music will
be presented by Mr. Lomax, who is
narrator for the broadcast, in the
light of the development of the several
instruments they play and the
importance of these instruments in 
American rural life.

Familiar Selections
The selections to be played are,
of course, familiar to most of the 
rural residents of Southwest Virginia,
with the possible exception 
of "Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow,"
a bit of mountain "program 
music" which describes the movements
of the great French emperor
as he fell back from his march on
Russia, and is rarely heard now-a-days.

The other numbers to be played
by the "Bog Trotters" probably will
include "The Arkansas Traveler,"
"Hop Up, My Ladies," "Old Joe
Clark," "The Bank of the Arkansas"
and "Here, Rattler."

Mr. Lomax will tie the several selections
together into a narrative
of the part such music has played
in American life through the years.

"Discovered" By His Father

Mr. Lomax said the "Bog Trotters"
were selected for the square
dance broadcast as a result of a
trip made by his father, John A.
Lomax, also a folk music expert,
several years ago through the Appalachian
mountains in search of
old ballads and folk tunes. At that
time, the elder Lomax made the acquaintance
of Uncle Alec and his
group and the "Bog Trotters" made
several recordings of old songs on
Lomax' portable machine.

These now form part of the
largest collection of folk music recordings
on this continent—that of
the Archive of American Music of
the Library of Congress inWashington.
The private collection of
the Lomaxes went into this archive,
of which the elder Lomax is honorary
curator and the younger is
assistant in charge. Together they
have published several standard
'volumes on American folk music.

more tightly about the little

the snow today, though, and they're
plum wore out with running in and
out the house."

The Wards neither farm nor raise
stock now, she said, though when
they lived in the mountains near
Indepedence they used to raise a
crop every year.

We had a dipperful of water from
the water bucket in the kitchen,
noticed that Mrs. Ward puts
up her own fruit and returned to
our seats, warm and comfortable
behind the little stove in the front
room, in time to hear Uncle Alec
recite the opening lines from
Burns' Tam O'Shanter, and name
that, with the Cotters' Saturday
Night as his favorite selections
from his best-like poet. Entirely
fitting, we thought—Burns, of the
simple heart and homely rustic
heritage, would have been much at
home in a gathering of this sort.
His art, too, was one to which he
was born; he would have understood
that these people play and
sing as a natural expression of
their daily life and experience, not
as prefessional entertainers, for
effect; the tunes are in their blood,
and the words, handed down from
their elders, have the grace of real
traditions.

That's the way it had been, too,
when Uncle Alec and Uncle
Crockett were growing up back in
the mountains of Grayson county.

Such neighborhood music parties
still are common in those sections,
but Uncle Alec's group didn't have
any real organization until some
time later when Dr. W. P. Davis,
who was raised in that country and
practices medicine in the little
town of Galax on the edge of
Grayson county, got behind them.

Dr. Davis says simly, "I had an
autoharp (a type of dulcimer) and
Uncle Alec had his fiddle and we
both loved music, so we got together
to compare notes." Uncle
Crockett Ward and his brother and
son naturally came into the group.
That was about seven years ago,
and when the neighbors began to
call on them to play and sing the
old ballads and dance tunes for
square dances and all sorts of entertainment,
Dr. Davis thought
they ought to have a name.

Why did they call themselves
the "Bog Trotters?"

"Well," the doctor says in his
easy manner, "we played a lot of
Irish pieces for one thing. Then,
we played down here along the
swampy, boggy Ballard creek."

"And our music had a sort of trot
to it," Uncle Alec interposed in
his inimitable drawl, illustrating
the trot with his hands.

popular programs continued for
several seasons.
