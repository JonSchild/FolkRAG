2) He cheeks was like the blooming rose
That tells of a rosy morning,
With an innocent heart and graceful means
Her beauty's fame adorning.

3) Lord Fyvie had a trumpeter
Whose name was Andrew Lammie.
For he had the art to gain the heart
Of miller Tiftie's Annie.

4) For proper he wasm both young and gay,
And his like was not in Fyvie,
Nor was there one that could compare
With this same Andrew Lammie.

5) Lord Fyvie he rode by the door,
Where lived Tiftie's Annie,
His trumpeter rode him before,
Even this same Andrew Lammie.

6) Her mother called her to the door,
Come here to me, my Annie.
Did ye ever see a prettier man
Than the trumpeter of Fyvie?

7) She sighed sore but she said no more,
Alas for bonny Annie,
For she darens own that her heart was won
By the trumpeter of Fyvie.

8) But the first time I and my true love met
Was in the woods of Fyvie,
His lovely form and his speech so soft,
Soon gained the heart of Annie.

9) He called me Mistriss, but I said no,
I was Tifty's bonnie Annie.
With apples sweet he did me treat,
And kisses soft and many.

10) It was up and down in Tifty's glen,
Where the burn runs clear and bonny,
It was here we went and knew our love
Before he went and leaved her.

11) But now, alas, her father heard,
That the trumpeter of Fyvie,
Had had the art to gain the heart
O' Miller Tiftie's Annie.
