Dear Alan:

I'm sorry I didn't get your letter sooner as Woodie was in on
Friday and recorded two more songs, DUST PNEUMONIA BLUES and
DUST CAN'T KILL ME.  Perhaps I can get him to come in again
and make the other two songs on the basis that if and when we
list them, we will pay for them.

I will ask Woody whether or not he can group the songs logically
for me..   If not, I will then appeal to you.

He has written a booklet which is really a historical document.

I haven't forgotten you on the recordings with Leadbelly and
the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet.  The last offer I can make
you is one-cent a side.  On those solos which you make, I can
offer you, I think, a 5% royalty.

We will look forward to recording Leadbelly and the Golden
Gate Quartet in June when you come to New York.

Sincerely yours,

Bob
