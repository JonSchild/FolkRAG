EFFICIENCY RATING REPORT

To Alan Lomax
Grade SP-4
Division Music

Your "Efficiency Rating" for the period ending April 15, 1941 was:

Your attention is directed to Section F of General Order No. 1021 which provides that "an employee who is dissatisfied with his rating may within 15 days after receiving notice of it request in writing a reconsideration by the Efficiency Rating Committee. The Committee will investigate the case and may call upon any employee of the Library for oral or written evidence". Such requests for reconsideration should be addressed to the Director of Personnel.

If the original rating from which reconsideration was requested is upheld by the Efficiency Rating Committee, the employee may appeal within 90 days after receiving such notice for a hearing before a Board of Review as provided under Section 7 of the Ramspeck Act.

Each appeal from an efficiency rating shall be submitted in writing to the Chairman of the appropriate Board of Review within 90 days of the date that notice of such rating was delivered to the employee. Boards of Review may waive this requirement for good and sufficient reasons, as in the cases (a) where it appears that appellants were not in a position to make an appeal within the 90 day period, (b) where the employees elected to avail themselves of the grievances procedure in their own departments or establishments before processing with appeals under these regulations, or (c) where new evidence is discovered after the close of the 90 day period which would have a bearing on the decision concerning the appeal. All efficiency ratings which require the dismissal, demotion, or reduction in salary of employees subject to the approval of the Civil Service Commission under Section 9 of the Classification Act of 1923 as amended shall, on the request of the Civil Service Commission, be scheduled for hearings before the Boards of Review in the same manner as if appealed by such employees.
