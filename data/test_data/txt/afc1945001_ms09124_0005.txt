Rumors
There has been a lot of rumors going
around, and all of them are about
the war. Some of them say don't buy
war bonds or stamps, other say
America can't win the war. But
they say all that to try and make
us lose our faith in America.
They even start black markets, and
sell things that are rationed.
But the American's shall never lose
faith in their country.
