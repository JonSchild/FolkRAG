Dear Sir:-

Mr. W.C. Handy suggested that I contact you.

We are one of the leading photograph-agencies co-ooperating wh with nationally-known publications.

I remember reading the excellent review your book received in the New York Sunday papers and I am aware of your outstanding work in the collection of Negro folk-songs.

We have an urgent request for photos of Hudie ("Leadbelly" ) Ledbetter. Can you submit these at once for the purpose of copying them to be used in Ken magazine?  Of course, we will return them promptly.

We shall be glad to compensate you for the use of the photos.

An immediate response will be deeply appreciated since this is an attempt to meet a dealine between May 31st and June ist.

Sincerely,
Maurice Roberts
