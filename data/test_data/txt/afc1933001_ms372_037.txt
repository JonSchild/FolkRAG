[My Western Home]
Home On The Range
By Dr. Brewster Higley

I
Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam,
Where the deer and antelope play,
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
[1] And the sky is not clouded all day.
CHORUS
[2] A home, a home where the deer and antelope play.
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the sky is not clouded all day.
II
Oh, give me the gale of the Solomon vale,
Where life streams with boyancy flow,
On the banks of the Beaver, where seldom if ever
Any poisonous herbage doth grow.
III
Oh give me the land where the bright diamond sand
Throws light from its glittering stream
Where glideth along the graceful white swan,
Like a maid in her heavenly dream.
IV
[6] I love the wild flowers in this bright land of ours:
I love, too, the wild curfew's scream,
The bluffs and white rocks and antelope flocks
That graze on the hillsides so green.
V
How often at night, when the heavens are bright
[5] By the light of the glittering stars,
Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed
If their glory exceeds this of ours.
VI
The air is so pure, the breezes so free,
The zephyrs so balmy and light,
I would not exchange my home here to range
Forever in azure so bright.
