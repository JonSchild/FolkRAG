bishop -- had called him up an' told him that he was on his way.
He was comin' out here.  He told him what happened.  The
members had said -- the Mother of the Church, in there, an'
Maggie, diffrunt ones, done had wrote him, told him to come
down an' see about this.  Elder Winn was lettin' me be in
the Church an' knowin' I wasn't married.  See?  Oh!  Gonna put
me an' Elder Winn an' all out, ay know.  That what was gonna
be.  It woulda been a terrible trap, see?
     So.  Elder Winn told us, that's what he said, an' just how
he said it.  It's a mess on him an' me an' everybody else, ya
know.  It'd been a flaw.  A big flaw.  Christian flaw, I'm
talkin' about.  So Elder Winn told us about it.

     George went back in the room an' got the license, handed
it to him.  Said, "You see here?"  He handed it to him.  He said,
"This the license."  He opened it an' read it.

     So he said, "All right."
     He said, "Don't tell them nothin'.  Go 'head on to the
church tonight jus' like you don't know nothin'.  Don't even
tell 'em you seed me."  He went back through the mud.  At the
side, see?  Nobody seen him down that road that day.  'Cause
they mighta went an' said that he went an' bought 'em or sumpin'.
or other.  You know, you coulda, coulda done it 'cause it
wasn't dated, was 'way back.
