SECRETARIES

Congress of the United States
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.
April 14th, 1938

John A. Lomax, Curator
Archive of American Folk Songs,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I would like to ask you what the duties of your
Department are. The reason for writing you is that
a constituent of mine has advised me that someone
purporting to be from your Department had asked him 
for some old songs. Naturally,  this constituent wrote
to me to see whether or not the representative was 
actually from the Library of Congress.

Will you be good enough to let me have some
Information promptly by return mail.

Sincerely yours,
John W. Boehne Jr
