The President's Committee On Administrative Management
Advises You To Join Your Union

The President's Committee on Administrative Management
took the personnel policies of the federal government apart and
looked at them with a microscope. They found many things
wrong, but they said to the President, the answer is a union,
and "further equalization of compensation levels." To quote
form their report, "hours of duty, and working conditions, generally 
will require honest, careful, and continuous attention over a 
period of years... The central personnel agency can probably
do its work in this field most effectively by encouraging employee
organizations and supervisors to deal directly with each
other in the consideration of the numerous problems capable of
solution through mutual cooperation and fair dealing."
