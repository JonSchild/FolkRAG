MODERN CANNON BALL

Far across the great Pacific to the island of Japan,
We've got a score to settle and the time is now at hand;
We've gotta send some aeroplanes flyin' o'er the sea,
To make this country safe for those who love democracy.

Chorus: The aeroplanes are hummin', hear the angry bullets whine;
We're gonna have to use them to change old Tojo's mind;
He'll know his days are over when the shells around him fall;
We'll send this message to him on the Modern Cannon Ball.

I know you've heard the story of Pearl Harbor and Luzon,
The spirits of the men who died say we must carry on;
We'll blast their fleet of battleships from the ocean mighty soon,
We'll blow them up so doggone high, they'll sail around the moon.

(Chorus)

We'll drive them from the ocean and islands of the sea,
The people will be free again just like they ought to be.
The mighty Chinese people will have freedom in their land
When we lick those Fascist bullies from the island of Japan.

(Chorus)
