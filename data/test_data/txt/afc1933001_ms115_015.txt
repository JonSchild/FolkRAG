Dear Mr. Strunk,

The department's recording machine has had an interesting time
this summer and I should like to give you some account of it
before you leave for Europe.  In many ways this has been the
most exciting field trip I have made and, really can only
be told in a long, rambling novel, but I shall confine myself
to a catalouge of records which, while exciting enough, is
by no means adequate for the whole story.
Miss Mary Elizabeth Barnicle, professor of the ballad at New
York University, Miss Zora Hurston, Columbia anthropologist
and probably the best informed person today on Western
Negro folk-lore, and myself met in Brunswick Ga.. on June the
fifteenth and began our search for folk-songs there.  Through
Miss Hurston's influence we were soon living, in an
isolated community on St. Simon's island, on such 
friendly terms with the Negroes as I had never experienced
before.  This community is a settlement of Negroes that has 
remained practically static since the days of slavery, [is
made up entirely of Negores.] We rented a little Negro shantey
and sent out the call for folk-singers.  The first evening our
front yard as crowded.
In a week's time we had made about forty records.
1) Children's game songs, both traditional and indigenous
2) The shrill, strange cries that thes children 
use to signal to each other across the fields.
3) Chanties of the sort that the Negroes sing in loading 
the ships in Charlestown, Savannah and Brunswick, songs of the 
like that the white sailors heard in the days of clipper 
ships and turned to their own use -- probably the earliest 
type of Negro work-song.
4) Ring-shouts, probably the earliest for of the 
Negro spiritual, widely current in the days of slavery, but 
now all but forgotten except in a few isolated communities.
These songs are for dancing.
5) Records of what is called "Jooking" on the guitar.  The 
"jook" is the saloom and dance hall of this part of the South
and "jook" music furnishes the rhythm for the one-step, the 
slowdrag and the other dances of Whiskey filled Saturday nights
At St. Simons island we were lucky enough to find still 
current and popular an early and primitive type of guitar
