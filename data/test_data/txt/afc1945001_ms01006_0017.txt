JUST AS THEY already were
closing in on Java before they
took Singapore, the Japs now are
arranging their approaches to
India without waiting for the technical 
acquisition of lower Bruma.
[?----]Practically, of course, it already is
theirs.

News of the British withdrawal
from their positions on the Sittang
River's west bank, and of the cutting
of the rail
line from Rangoon
to Lashio
is just a matter
of time 
[Is it more than a matter of time?]
[!N.B.] perhaps such a 
short time that
it will have happened
before
this can get 
into print.

The defenders'
recognition
of their inability
to hold out
much longer is
plainly indicated
by events at
Rangoon. Quantities
of war supplies destined for
China were hastily shipped north
to Lashio, where the Burma Road
begins. Not all of the stuff
stacked on the docks went, however.
The torch was applied to 
some.
[How does he know?]

THAT CAN only mean the Japs
arrival is too near at hand for
more trains to be loaded and started
rolling. Even were they to get
clear of the city before the enemy
came in, they probably would be
intercepted somewhere along the
Sittang, which the rail line parallels.

Having bought the Burma 
campaign to this point, the Gaps
are preparing to outflank Rangoon
[How does he know?]
by sea, and to place themselves
within striking distance
of India's coast from Calcutta
to Ceylon. Permitted their own
way, they will be able to control
the whole Bay of Bengal, over
which must steam all vessels
bound for India's eastern ports.
[Obvious!]

The manifestation of this intention
[could be a feint]
lies in the air attacks on the
Andaman Islands, which seemed
to center mainly at Port Blair and
its flying field. These islands lie
in a latitude well  west of Rangoon's, 
and their occupation by a
Jap force would constitute a seaborne
by-passing of that port to
render it useless even were it to
hold out.

STRETCHING FROM north to
south for about 200 miles, the
Andamans lie some 400 miles due
west of the Burma panhandle, the
appendage stretching well down
the west coast of the Malay Peninsula. 
Possession of the would
[Conjecture, of course]
place Jap bombers within range
of parts of India not conveniently 
in reach of captured Burma bases,
and would additionally furnish an
advance base for Jap naval expeditions 
against India emanating
from Singapore and Penang.

As yet, of course, these islands
have not yet been tracked except
by planes. However, such
forays are seldom anything but
preliminaries to an assault in 
force [is this true?]. When it comes [When and if], it can be
taken as a sign that Japan is
deadly earnest in her threat to 
conquer India.

How much beyond the threat
stage this phase of the war goes
probably will depend almost entirely
[too much "depend' to mean much]
on the amount of assistance
China can spare India, and on
India's willingness to fight.

Various political and diplomatic
fences are being quickly mended 
in an effort to augment the Indians'
enthusiasm for battle
against the Japs, and the degree
to which this ardor for fighting
is generated perhaps doubtless [it is either "perhaps" or "doubtless" not both] will
have a good deal to do with the
size of the force Chiang Kai Shek
is willing to commit to the campaign.

THE JAPS seem to think that
the chances of such a military
coalition becoming effective are
good. They indicate this by the
speed of their operations. More
than anywhere else they have
fought, the Japs' attacks in Burma
give the impression of racing 
against time.

They have advanced in the face
of opposition which cost tremendously
in casualties. Troops that 
served in the Malayan campaign
have been rushed to the Sittang
front instead of employed against
 Java, which is itself a place where
time is of importance to the Japs.
[Where did he get this info?]

What the Chinese mean to do
will probably first be indicated
on the Burma front that will
form after the Japs have cleared
the Sittang's West Bank of defenders
and flooded into Rangoon.
Unlike the present line,
which runs north to south,, the
new one probably will run east
to west, with its back against
Mandalay.

Its job will be to fence off
northern Burma, keep Lashio and
the road that stretches up into
China free, and maintain at least
a trickle of help for the Chinese
flowing out of India.
