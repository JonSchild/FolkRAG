A cowboy's horse is so much a part of the cowboy himself that he rarely in
his songs looks at his horse objectively. In one song he says

"Oh a ten dollar hoss and a forty dollar saddle
And I'm goin' to punch those longhorn cattle."

This was in the days when a first saddle cost more than a mustang pony.
Those ran wild on the Texas range, free for anyone who could put a noose
around their necks. But the cow pony was the constant companion of the 
cowboy when he sings,

"The rapid beat of his broncos feet,
On the sod as he speeds along,
Keeps living time to the ringing rhyme
Of his rollicking cowboy song."

In "Old P[o]aint" he pokes fun of his cowhorse when he sings ["Old Paint's]

"Old P[o]aints' a good saddler, he paces when he can
He paces all the time if he's not in the sand.
Old P[o]aint [had] was a colt way down on the Rio Grande,
We roped him and we branded him and called him Cheyenne."

But in the song, Choko, the cowboy sets forth in detail just that portion
of the daily work done by a horse that knows his job:

"You're a good roping horse, you were never jerked down;
When tied to a steer, you will circle him round;
Let him once cross the string and over you'll go,
You save the business, my cowhorse, Choko."

At the end of the trail, where along with the cattle the                  of horses
were sold, the cowboy was faced with separation from his favorite saddle pony,
the one, perhaps, that had saved his life by being surefooted in a midnight
stampede.

"Fare you well, old Blue Dog, you have been a good friend,
Around the night herd on you I could depend
With lightning in your eyes and thunder in your heels
You went spinning around like a hoop upon a reel."

In other words, old Blue Dog didn't step in a prairie dog hole and tumble his 
rider in front of thousands of steers blinded by fear and rushing headlong
through the night. The cowboy did love a faithful horse, his trusted friend
