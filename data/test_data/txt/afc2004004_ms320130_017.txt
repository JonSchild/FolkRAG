pasture together.  Just like horses or anything else, they
can build a fire and you, the stable will be afire.  You
take them horses out and they're going to go right back in
that fire.  And a lot of people wilkl do the same thing.
You take them out of the house and they'll run back when
it's afire.  You got to watch people here when it's afire.
Now I put them horses in there and just like you [shot]
them, they wanted to get back out.  So I said just let them
stay.  Yeah, them waves and stuff, we had drifts and stuff.
Well all that cement and stuff at them steps, them big
bulldozers, they cleaned all around my house and big [eight
cats], that's what cleaned all this place.  That was drift
that high here.  The seaweeds and everything.  I wish you'd
have seen that.  Big logs right against the house and 
everything.
LOMAX  Your house stayed here, it didn't 
go. . . .
HARDIN  Yes.  But it didn't leave a bit of
fence nowhere.  You never had a bit of fence.  The only
thing I kept is, is the cow pen.  Every other piece of fence
was gone.  Yeah.  But we, whenver, after the storm it's just
like in old times.  You'd have to turn your cows and calves
a loose every evening and pen up the [cats] and shut them in
the cow pen to, to milk the cows the next day, yeah.  Yeah,
that's the god's truth.
LOMAX  Did you, you all lost some people
out here.  Did you help clean up the place?
