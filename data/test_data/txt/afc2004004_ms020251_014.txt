Reel of 10/4/61, Side 1, Song 7                   [*37*]

J. P. MORGAN

This is just a funny, little song.  You don't dance to it.  It is
just something to be saying about a hungry girl.  They would just
say it to one another.

CHORUS:  My name is Morgan
                 But not J. P.
                 Them banks on Wall Street
                 Don't belong to me.

                 I carried a gal up Rangtang Street,
                 Just as hungry as she could be,
                 We dashed right into a restaurant,
                 She ordered everything was there,
                 And I told her that I didn't mind
                 Buying two or three things to share,
                 But the appetite that you've got tonight,
                 Would break a millionaire.    (CHORUS)
