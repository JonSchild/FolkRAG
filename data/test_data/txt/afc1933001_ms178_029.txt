Dear Mr. Lomax: 
I am in receipt of your letter of January 27, 1942.
Somehow I can't quite understand your feelings as expressed in your letter. 
Nowhere in either of my letters did I indicate that we were holding your 
check "over your head". Good business practice dictates that where a check 
comes back because of insufficient funds in the drawer's account the drawee 
notifies drawer of such fact, and requests that a new check be issued. This 
is common everyday business routine, and has never in my experience resulted 
in any statement of resentment by the drawer.
Further, I see no reason why you should feel that we are "unpleasant about 
this matter". Again, good business practice dictates that outstanding monies 
should be collected.
I am sure that you, as well as all persons active in the business world, at 
some time or other must have written or asked for monies that were due and 
owing.
At no time was I or anybody in our organization told that you were short of 
funds and couldn't settle your account at this time. However, that being the 
case at the present, there is nothing for us to do but defer collection until 
some later date. If you will let me know when and how you will repay this 
money to us, I am sure we will show our complete cooperation as we have so 
often done in the past.
Pursuant to your request, I return herewith your check dated December 6, 1941 
drawn on the National Capital Bank of Washington, and payable to the order of 
the Columbia Lecture Bureau in the sum of $25. which was returned to our bank 
with the attached notation "Exceeds drawer's balance".
Cordially,
Merritt H. Coleman
