Dear Mr Lomax

I have just received your
letter of February 26, 1942, with bill from MacMillan
for $55 for music corrections.

I had previously understood
that there was a "theoretical" charge of $50.91 for
author's music corrections of the proof of the
second (and final) music printer engaged by MacMillan.
But I had taken for granted that this had been
cancelled in view of the enormous amount of time
spent by me in correcting not only the work of the 
first music printer (whose work was subsequently)
admitted inadequate by MacMillan and was discarded),
but also the incredibly inaccurate work of the final
printer - whose careless mistakes outnumbered my
author's corrections ten to one. it will be remembered 
that MacMillan employed a staff proof reader for
the text, but no staff proof reader for the music.
I served in this capacity without pay.

May I ask (1) - as an author
who has not had previous dealings with MacMillan - 
whether it has been their custom to collect author's
corrections in cash, prior to declaration of royalties,
and (2) whether I may assume that you and Alan are
being asked to pay for the corrections in the text,
which, as I recall, were substantial.

Faithfully
Ruth Crawford Seeger
