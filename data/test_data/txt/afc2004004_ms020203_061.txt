V:  I did not. That was on Wednesday, I believe it was.
Anyway it was around the middle of the week mama went out
there. She never would go the first time it start--but she'd go
about two three nights after it's done started(500). And
it must have been long 'bout Wednesday night or Thursday
night or something like that. And so when I went back there
Sunday night, I joined, I joined the church that Sunday night
and just I got with um. I joined and everybody was just
so glad, um-um--um, they put me on the choir that night.
A:  How did you know it was time for you to join the church?
V:  I felt like I had Christ and I felt sorry for myself and 
I was willingly to do just what the preacher had read in the
Bible the way he said that you had to do to come to Christ--
had to be humble and feel [and just feel] just sorry for yourself
and feels like you just you not livin the way you'd like
to be livin and the way you livin, you just die and be lost
if you'll believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, we'll save you,
he will save you. And so I felt that way and I did believe
it, that the Lord will save me when I die. I still believe it.
