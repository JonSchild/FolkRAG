Dear Mr. Brandon:
     Attached is a copy of the note
on Tall Tales with a short bibliography. I hadn't 
sent it on because I judged that you hadn't liked
my introduction to the picture and there was no 
point in continuing with the other part of my job.
     I am delighted that you are going 
to use it and here is my bibliography.
          Apologetically yours,

          Alan Lomax 
          Assistant in Charge
