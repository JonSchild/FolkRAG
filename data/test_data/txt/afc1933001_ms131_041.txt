Mr. Alan Lomax
Music Division
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Alan:

The titles in the attached list are now finished 
and will be ready for delivery as soon as they are 
labelled, which will be in the next day or two.

In general, I have done two things in making the 
dubbings: deepened the cut and raised the level to 
about the point found in commercial recordings. The 
surface noise in the bulk of the records was sufficiently 
low to lead me to feel that nothing should be
done to filter it.

I shall have another batch ready for delivery in
another week, and shall send them as soon as possible.

I shall be glad to hear what you think of the
first shipment as soon as you have had a chance to go 
over a few of them.

Sincerely yours,
(Signed)
Chick
