Dear Father:

It's going to be a little hard for me to make such an 
agreement with Columbia until I know what you have agreed to
for your other books. Please let me know by return mail what
that was. Enclosed is my last communication from the Columbia
Recording Company. I am afraid that all I can do is see them
when I go to New York next and make what arrangements I can. It
seems to me that in regard to the songs in Our Singing Country, 
which are quoted from public domain records in the Library of
Congress, you will have a very hard time making your claim good
in court. Peter Grey is a published song out of the first part
of the nineteenth century. Cotton Eye Joe was given to us by
Margaret Valliant of the National Youth Administration. Streets
of Laredo, while it is the version published in Cowboy Songs,
was recorded recently by us for the Library.

Please remember, too, that CBS is not Columbia Recording
Company, although the Columbia Recording Company is owned by
CBS. The people at the Columbia Recording Company are the most
honorable people in the field, and they're nice guys. I am
not anxious for this relatively small and pretty hard to clinch
matter to go into court. It seems to me that your position as
Curator of the Archive of public domain folk music becomes at
this point hard to justify.

What have you decided about the recording trip?

Love to you and Deanie,
Alan
