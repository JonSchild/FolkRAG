       AMERICA'S FIGHTING JEW 


     A poet wrote a tribute
     To our country's fighting jew
     So we'll join our friend the poet 
     and drink to that jew too.

     But now where are all his pals 
     Saulie, Abe and Sam?
     They have now left him all alone 
     As if he were a ham.

     They are fighting at the race tracks 
     To place their show bets down;
     They'll fight for ring side tables 
     At the Swanky joints in town;

     They fight like hell at Jordan's 
     and cousin Filene's, too;
     Wherever there's a bargain,
     You'll find the FIGHTING JEW.

     Onward Christian Soldiers! 
     That is their battle cry.
     They fight to wave Old Glory 
     At gentile soldiers passing by.

     Now Abie, Saul and little Sam
     Stay home and have your fun
     ut when the doughboys come back home, 
     Then you had better run;

     For when he's thru with Hitler, 
     The Japs and Mussy, too,
     Johnnie Doughboy has a date 
     With America's FIGHTING JEW.
