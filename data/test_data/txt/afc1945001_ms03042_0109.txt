FROM: K. G. Haxtun, Manager

SUBJECT: Cooperation with Office of War Information

In accordance with your memorandum of July 30, 1942, and telegram of August 7 the following report is submitted:

1. During discussion as to the need for a second front in Europe three different persons have said, "Why start a second front, let the Russians and Germans kill each other off." [*4*]
2. A person returning from a trip during which he visited a friend who is a soldier at one of our large military camps said that the soldier informed him that it was generally the opinion among the soldiers in that camp that the British are yellow and that the Americans will have to assume the brunt of the war  and pull the chestnuts out of the fire [*for the British*] [*2*]
3. From two different persons I have heard the following: "The Socony Vacuum Oil Company is paying $18 a day demurrage per car (number not given) on tank[s] [*cars*] kept on railway siding in the city of Rochester because their storage tanks are filled to the top with gasoline. This statement was made in connection with a discussion of the lack of necessity for gas rationing in this area. [*3*]
