            The rumor collection covering the week of October 5 to 9 inclusive 
was furnished from the following sources:

            (1)   Sgt. Donahue of the Boston Police Force, in East Boston.
            (2)   Dorothy Kenneally, owner of beauty parlor in Roslindale, 
                    Massachusetts, which is a. part of metropolitan Boston.
            (3)   Dr. George M. Lee, dentist of Beacon Street, Brookline, 
                   part of metropolitan Boston.
            (4)   John Shaughnessey, worker in war production plant at 
                   Hudson, Massachusetts.

            (6)   William R. Dacy, proprietor of drugstore at Wellesley 
                   Hills, Massachusetts.
            While these sources are all in eastern Massachusetts, two were 
selected from outside the metropolitan district of Boston for the purpose 
of trying to get representative rumors both in large cities and 
smaller communities.
            In addition, there are certain rumors reported from contacts made 
by the writer personally.
            Of the sources selected, one, the drugstore proprietor, was not 
productive, but the others all furnished some material.
