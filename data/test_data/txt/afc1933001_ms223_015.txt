have Macmillans letter, saying that
that they have in hand a satisfactory
manuscript. As they send
out proofs (I've asked them to
send them to you and to accept your decisions as final) I'd like
to see copies. As yet I don't
know what you have finally
said in the Introduction. Would 
you send me a copy of that
and also of Ruth's?

Is your adoption of
e e cummings' style a playful
interlude or does it represent
your permanent conviction 
that again the process of the ages
is on the wrong track?
Lovingly,
Father.
