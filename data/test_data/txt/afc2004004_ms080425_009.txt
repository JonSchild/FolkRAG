. . . How do you get that sound.  None of 'em would tell me.
I got the book and figured it out, next time we went to
singing, I just got the music, had it ever since, you
got to figure it out.

Al:    And what's your job in life, your profession?

Man:    Seeding peaches [*?*] . . . I had a manufacturing company for
37 years.

AL:  Doing what?

Man:  Grinding cars, fixing machinery . . .

AL:  You're a mechanic

Man:  They retired me at 65, I sat around 6 months, about
had a nervous breakdown til I went out and got me some work.
I'll be 76.   We have a 3 day convention over here in old
Cankrete, third Fri, Sat, Sun in August.

AL:   So you can imagine, every weekend, somewhere in
Alabama and Georgia, there'll be singings like this
where the ladies bring the food, the men bring the appetite,
and everybody brings a wonderful feeling for this old time
American spiritual music.  This is just one slice out of a
big activity that amuses and rejoices people all through
this hill country in the south, from Georgia west to
the foothills of Texas.

Man:   I look forward to it from one week to the next.  People
