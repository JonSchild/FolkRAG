Ladies and gentlemen, we now in the jungles.
We're broadcasting over station J-I-N, Gin, the breath
of a nation.
Everyone of you are animules,
You should be walking on four legs,  but you're now walking
on two.
You know you come directly from the animule familiee
What's it I see coming through the weeds,
Just as tall as he can be, all speckled and striped, there,
Hasn't got a collar and tie on.
Um-hmm, I know you,
Why, you're just so tall you can eat trees from the leaves,
and never bend your knees,
Yes, I understand, this is Mr. G. Raffey.
Who is that other big fellow that's following right in
your tracks?
Why, it looks like he's got dirty clothes on,
Look like they're white clothes [?] but they've gone darker
Ha, I think I can see him, why, he's got a trunk with him,
Oh, yes, I realize who that is; that's Mr. L. E. Phant.
Who's that little bit of thing that's walking through 
the weeds, there,
With a hat all over its head,
That look like Aunt Dinah's little bit of children,
I see, looks like it's kind of angry,
Oh, I know who that is; that's the lady porcupine.
There’s something walking straight up on two legs,
What’s that? oh, I know,
That’s a cross between a gorilla and a rang-u-tan,
A little bit of ring tail monkey.
Yes, we right in the animule field,
And I never think I want to tell you people with clothes on.
You have tails just the same, but you wear clothes and you
can't see them.
We're down in jungle town / For miles around,
They used to give a ball every night at the animule hall,
The band begun to play, they begun to shout,
You'd laugh, ha, ha, ha, [*2 and 5,*] 'till your sides would crack,
And they'd call them dog-gone figures out.
