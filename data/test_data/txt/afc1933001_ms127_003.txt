Recording expedition of Mr. Alan Lomax

At the suggestion of Mr. John Lomax, I recommend that the recording expedition of Mr. Alan Lomax be extended for two weeks and that he be ordered to proceed to Akron, Ohio, to record the singing of Captain Nye, the old canal-barge worker whose lengthy letters were recently shown you.

I also recommend that, for the duration of this extension, Mr. Alan Lomax be reimbursed for his subsistence, mileage, and incidental expenses out of the appropriation for the increase of the library.

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
