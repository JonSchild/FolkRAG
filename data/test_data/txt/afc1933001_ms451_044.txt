6  Got that possum & I put him in a sack,
Next thing I knew I had him on my
back.
Saying, "Come on, Blue,
Boo-hoo."

7  Bake that possum good & brown
And [place] I lays them sweet potatoes round &
round.
Saying, "Come on, Blue,
[Boo, hoo"] You kin have some too."

9  [Whe] When old Blue died, x he died so hard,
[And he] That he shook the ground in my back yard.
Saying, "[Come] Go on, Blue,
I'm coming to."

Dug his grave with a silver spade.
And I let him down with a golden chain;
Saying, "[Come] Go on, Blue,
I'm coming too."
