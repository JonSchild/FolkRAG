I'm happy tonight and not ashamed
To tell the world
Where I stand.
I'm a messenger.
Then I got a message.
And my message is salvation.
You give it.
You tell the world.
None of your business
Whether they believe it or not.
Neither the condemnation of all men.
Go out the preach the word.
Preach the word
with tears in your eyes.
Preach the word.
Preach the word....

..THE OLDER MEN. AGAIN HE BEGAN SLOWLY IN A DEEP BASS VOICE. AGAIN, AS HE WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE NET OF HIS OWN FEELINGS HIS VOICE MOUNTED TO
A HIGH PITCHED, CHILDISH SCREAM.  AS FOR THE CONGRE-
GATION PANDEMONIUM LOOSE...

O Lord,
O Lord,
Don't be angry with us this evening,
Please suh, have mercy.

We know we''ve done wrong,
We know we have treated you just as wrong,
We know we haven't kept your commandments very well,

O Lord, O Lord,
You're the forgiving God,
Please suh, xxxx xxxxx, forgive us,
Love us freely one more time
As though we had never sinned,
Please suh, have mercy.

O Lord,
O Lord,
O Lord,
Give us the determination to press on,
Please suh, have mercy.

Broaden our shoulders,
O---, make us strong,
Make us able to bear out burdens,
Please suh, have mercy.

O Lord,
O Lord,
We want to thank you,
Please suh have mercy.
