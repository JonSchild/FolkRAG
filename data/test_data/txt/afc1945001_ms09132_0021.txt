Junior - N - M.

(1) Jap's going to win this war.  (How do you know  
ask another indivudual.) because we white, 
and colored folks are not together. 

(2) How are you going to get by the Draft 
Board Jim! Well I'll eat some O.K. Soap 
make my heart beat faster.  

(3) Those Russian's fight like Hell, but 
if they have kill all the German, they 
say they have there would be no Germans.

(4) What have the Jap's and German's done to me 
Not a thing? nothing, why should I give my
life, and what for, but I am going to because
I am a true American. 

(5) Our men are all right at home 
but not in Africa where Rommel 
men are.
