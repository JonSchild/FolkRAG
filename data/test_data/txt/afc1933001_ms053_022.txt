THE MACMILLAN COMPANY
SHEET NUMBER 2 

In COWBOY SONGS, "The Strawberry Roan" occupies part of 99,
all of 100, 101, and 102; "To Be in Texas" occupies all of 321, all of 
322 and part of 323. It is, therefore, in each instance, a considerable
body of material that must be supplied.
Sincerely yours,
