Tape: #230 S.Harp 3

Roll 230

And when you beat time you want to put a strong accent on the first
part of the measure. And that's the way you get, like soldiers when
they drill--hup, two three four, hup, two three-- they're getting a
strong accent on the first part, and you should always remember that.
And always beat time to stay(?), and don't give it a little /courtesy?/ up
like this, or don't go across like that. Beat straight up, straight
down, always--common, triple, and     . You know about this
other type music that we have, the conventional type, the quartet type,
when they have a dozen leaders on the floor at one time, and everybody's
beatin' time a different way. We don' want to beat that way;we want to
beat the Sacred Harp way. OK, let me see where I've got to

... somebody sang one in 3/4ths time.

OK, OK, Henry you come sing one in 3/4 time and      all beat
time now all goin' in the same direction. ... ... ... 435 -- this is
triple time. Remember, there's not nobody gonna hit you if you call a
[*++*] note wrong. If you call a note "la" that should be a "fa", sound it, it'll
fit, just call it and go on. Now let me make one other illustration here,
Henry. When a song that's got only three-part harmony, somebody's gonna
get left out. So always when they've got three-part harmony, the alto is
the one left out. And we don't want you all to feel slighted--you all
could sing bass an upper octave, or you could sing triple, or you could 
sing     , but sing.

...the sol is lower than fa, but you want to hit fa first because it's
a key note.

Well, now to cue that would you go fa-la-sol or--

Yeah, and you could come back--
