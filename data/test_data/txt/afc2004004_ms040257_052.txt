In and out the dusty bluebells
In and out the dusty bluebells
In and out the dusty bluebells
I am your master.

Tipper-itter-atter on my shoulder,
Tipper-itter-atter on my shoulder
Tipper-itter-atter on my shoulder
I am your master.

Up against the wall for the London Ball
The London Ball, the London Ball,
Up against the wall for the London Ball
For the bonnie bunch of roses.

Mother, mother, may I go
May I go, May I go
Mother, mother may I go
To the bonnie bunch of roses?

Yes, my darling you may go,
You may go, you may go,
Yes, my darling you may go
To the bonnie bunch of roses.

She buckled up her skirt and away she went
Away she went, away she went
She buckled up her skirt and away she went
To the bonnie bunch of roses.

She met her lover on the way,
On the way, on the way
She met her lover on the way
To the bonnie bunch of roses.

[He gave her a kiss k a*]

She shook her head and said good-bye
Said good-bye, said good-bye
She shook her head and said good-bye
To the bonnie bunch of roses.

Rainie rainie rattle stanes
Dinnie rain on me
Rain on Johnnie Groat's Hous
Far across the sea.

The wind, the wind, the wind blows high
The snow comes falling from the sky
Mary Wood says she'll die
For the want of the golden city.

She is handsome, she is pretty,
She is the girl of the golden city
She is handsome, one, two, three
come and tell me who shall be.
