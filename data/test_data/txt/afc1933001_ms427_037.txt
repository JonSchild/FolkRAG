COMRADES, MARCH SHOULDER TO SHOULDER.

Comrades, march shoulder to shoulder,
Answering liberty's call;
Closing our ranks we shall boldly ) repeat
Fight for the ultimate goal.            ) twice

Workers, unite for the battle
One proletarian mass;
Fellows who preach and who prattle  ) repeat
Do not belong to our class.                  ) twice

Down with the fetters and cages
Wrought by the forces of greed;
Stifled and starved thru' the ages,) repeat
Labour at last shall be freed!         ) twice

Out with exploiters and rulers!
Out with the vulturous pack!
Long they were suffered to fool us,) repeat
Now we shall give them the sack.   ) twice

Militant, strong and defiant,
Workers will conquer the world,
And the red banner in triumph  ) repeat
Will be forever unfurled.             ) twice

ON, O THOU SOUL

On, on, O thou Soul! Tho' the way be starless and steep;
Onward still throu' night and tempest,
Thro' the dread gloom of the deep.
Soon over the tempest and the darkness,
Like golden eagles, Exulting in their blue dominion,
Sun and star shall rise and sweep.

Chorus:     On, on to the goal, Where the hills in glory sleep.
Onward tow'rds the portals of morning,
Upward still out of the deep.

Rise, rise, O thou soul! Thou hast dwelt too long in the  night;
Like the sun our God is rising,
All the world glows with the light.
Now after long years of sin and hatred,
Ages of sorrow, Man doth arise in joy and beauty,
Like the sun in love and light.

Chorus:     Rise, rise, O thou soul, Thou hast dwelt too long in the
                   night;
                   Like the sun our God is rising,
                   All the world glows with the light.
