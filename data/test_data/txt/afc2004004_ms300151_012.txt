[*Prestige
Ltrs from Singers*]

Dear Almeda,

I am delighted to get your letter, and I can read every, single
word of it. The big problem in American folk music today is
that only singers like Joan Baez sell enough records to pay back
their advances and make royalties. Both Atlantic and Prestige
Record Companies have instructions from me to pay your royalties
directly to you after the advances are paid out. Neither set of
records has sold sufficiently to pay off the advances up to now.
My guess is that they will not do so for a few years, but when the
wheel turns, as it inevitably will, to real songs sung by true
folk singers, royalties will start coming in. I made no outright
sales whatsoever.

I want you to understand, also, what my role is toward you and
other singers. Because I am well known, I can get records accepted 
by large companies on sufficient terms so that the singers 
can get something for what they have done. Also, because of
my reputation, the records are widely reviewed and listened to,
which so many records from small companies up until now generally
have not been. This has meant that many people such as yourself,
Bessie Jones and Hobart Smith, begin to be noticed and do other
things. In other words, they served to put you on the map. The
only way I could do this in a way that was acceptable to these
record companies was to have a lot of variety on each record,
which meant that the royalties had to be split among a number of
performers. I feel absolutely convinced that this was of great 
benefit to you and to the field in general, but from now on you
will be able to make your own records, as you say, for yourself,
and please feel free to resing any of the songs on the Prestige
albums without and restriction at all. If I can be of any use to
you as an advisor on recording contracts, I would be delighted.

I talked to Ralph Rinzler at length the other day about his plan
to become an agent for genuine folk singers, and I think he has a
good head on him and is a very nice man. I suggest that, if he
proposes being your agent for a while, you try with him because
there is no one else that I know of who is in the agent business
who cares about the real thing.

I don't believe you'll have to "hang on" too much longer.

Much love,

Alan Lomax
