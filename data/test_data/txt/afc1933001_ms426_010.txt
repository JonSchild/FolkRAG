KEEP ALIVE YOUR COURAGE

Tune-Throw Out The Life-Line.

Dark the night of gloom has settled.
O'er our farms and country homes.
Greed and graft control the battle,
And our loved ones soon must roam.

Chorus-
Keep alive your Union Courage,
Falter not, dare not delay.
You must break this human bondage,
And restore our liberty.

Dark the night of debt surrounds us,
Shades of loss creeping near,
You must hasten if you'll save us,
Or we'll lose our farms so dear.

Don't give up when profits lower,
It's the game of grafter's greed,
Buckle up your belt and 'Holler'
"Bondaged farmers shall be freed."

OH THAT OLD FARMER'S UNION

Tune-In The Evening By The Moonlight.

Oh that Old Farmer's Union,
It has stood the test of battle;
Oh that Old Farmer's Union,
Neither shot nor shell can rattle.
It has stood for right and justice,
And will stand 'til crack of doom.
It's the Old Farmer's Union, Farmer's Union.

It has fought for price of products.
In the North and South the same;
Down in Kansas and Nebraska,
The folks are big and game.
In Wisconsin and Dakota,
Minnesota and Montana,
It's the Old Farmer's Union, Farmer's Union.

Down in Iowa the Union,
Fights the same as Oklahoma,
Colorado, Illinois,
And the state where is Tacoma,
Even Georgia with her peanuts,
And Kentucky "Hush Keep Still."
It's the Old Farmer's Union, Farmer's Union.
