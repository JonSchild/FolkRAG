I only want you to consider the
probabilities that after all I may
be right. Face the facts and do
as you like - as you always

Wednesday of this week Shirley
is bringing Pat and Susan for us
to keep while she stays with
Chris at Mobile, Ala., where
he is scheduled to sail on
some sort of war vessel. Shirley
will go back to Lubbock where
so many of her friends live.
The pay of Chris is not enough to support
