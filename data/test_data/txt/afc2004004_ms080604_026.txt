B.G.:
            He'd have his stick an pistol.
A.L.:
            You ever see anybody shoot anybody or hit
anybody with that?

B.G.:
            Oh yeah!  I got a lick one morning -he hit
another fella an he hit me.  Had my head drippin'.  But I was
already up.  This fellow, when he got after him, he broke in a 
run, he made a mistake an hit me.

A.L.:
            But you couldn't fight him back?

B.G.:
            No you couldn't fight him back --he got a 
pistol.  Can't fight no pistol. (laughs)

A.L.:  
            Anybody know one of the songs those [chef-] shark
rousters sang?  You sang us one before. . .

W. Brown:
            Oh, ah. . .  Yeah.  They used to sing different. .

A.L.:
            Show us how they used to do it on the drum.

W.B.:
            An, ah. . . they would ah, (to B. Gordon) gimme
that can there --hand me that thing (points to a long piece of
2x4 lumber) . . . Now, they would come round there and they
would have, uh -steel.  But it was made in a diamond shape.  It
would come 'cross like this, and out like that, and back up
there. . .

A.L.:
            Cut the tape a minute.

(begins again with Walter Brown using a small piece of angle
steel in place of the 2x4)

Walter Brown (singing and beating rhythm on the steel with a 
wrench):
Everybody
Better get up soon
Got to catch the mules
A-by the stars and moon
