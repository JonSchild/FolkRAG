Bill hasn't Got The dates. Practically all of these
unless otherwise specified, were cut under the Okeh and
Vocalian Labels.

My asterik notes:
Banker Blues - the banker referred to is the hot shot
in the ofice but the sad sack coming in wondering what happened
to the petty cash he banked. Written as a result of crash of
Schiff Bank on Chicago's West Side in the Thirties.

Get Away - you undoubtedly know this one. Bill said he sang
it with you an a Midnite Special concert. Make My Get Away -
might be an underground railway song of 1949.

Lookin' Up At Down -- a study in relativity. A guy in a mine
is looking up at down -- a basement flat - which is higher up
than he is. When You're Lookin' Up At Down -- you're in
pretty bad shape.
