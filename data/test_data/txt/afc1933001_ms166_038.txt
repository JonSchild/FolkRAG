"AN HOUR OF SHEER DELIGHT"
"Town Hall is happy to have been the scene of The Troubadours' New York Debut, and I want to thank you
for the hour of sheer delight we enjoyed through your program of folk-tales and dances. In these sophisticated
days the freshness and spontaneity of your work is a real treat, and so far from missing the usual stage trappings,
it was obvious that the audience enjoyed the all-too-rare opportunity of exercising its imagination under
your high-spirited inspiration. We are all looking forward eagerly to your next visit to Town Hall."
     George V. Denny, Jr., Director, TOWN HALL, NEW YORK

"GAY AND LAUGHTER PROVOKING"
"We all enjoyed your delightful program. It is very difficult to find a program which appeals to all ages, and
many members have said that your gay and laughter provoking interpretations of folk-lore gave them an hour
of great pleasure and provided one of the nicest programs ever given for Daughters' Day."
     Mrs. G. E. Friend, Program Chairman, HACKENSACK WOMAN'S CLUB, N. J.

It is so difficult in these times to find programs that are unique and different from the usual routine,
that your offering met with an enthusiastic response all around."
     Mrs. Julian Olney, President, THE CONTEMPORARY CLUB, WHITE PLAINS, N. Y.

old Scottish tale "It fell about the Martinmas time"
From the program 'Cap and Bella'
(A Special Program for Children)

"The program given by the Misses Rayner at 
this school was original and unique. It provided
an evening of wholesome fun and worthwhile
entertainment. The thorough knowledge
of the background of every number, and the
careful preparation, as well as the zest of the
presentation, made every scene enjoyable. At
the close of the evening, the question asked by 
the pupils was: 'When may we have them
again?' "
Miss Eliza Kellas,
THE EMMA WILLARD SCHOOL, Troy, N. Y.

"Your programme so captivated the audience 
that scores of teachers remained behind to tell
me, personally, how very much they had enjoyed
it. As a teacher, I cannot commend your
work too highly. The beautiful dramatizations 
of folk-songs and folk-tales which you present 
without the external, material aids of setting
and full costuming, make an immediate appeal
to the imagination. The simplicity and sincerity
of your work marks it as truly artistic."
