Dear Mr. Boyd: 
I have been away on a collecting
trip or your letter should have 
been answered more promptly. I have
been told repeatedly by officials of the 
Music Division that this department 
would handle items of Express carriage;
in fact they suggested Express
carriage rather than Parcel Post where 
[?] the Government would render service 
gratis. Please see Mr. Strunk
and, if the plan we have hitherto followed 
is not possible, I suggest the 
payment of the enclosed bill 
out of the balance of the Carnegie
Grant still on hand with the Library; or I 
shall follow your definite instructions.
