Would just beat time there just the way you were doing.
Nick, tape some feet there, would you?  Just play a bit
more.
(music)
Nick, why don't you shoot a little context now while I'm
talking to them for the last little bit.  That yellow vine
over there is very, very beautiful and typical of the area.
RAMBLER
O.k., did we play our theme song for him
RAMBLER #2
Play our themesong, he'd like that, he'd eat that up.
A. LOMAX
We're about used up here,
RAMBLER #1
You're about at the end?
A. LOMAX
I think so.
RAMBLER
No, you don't have to put it on. . .
A. LOMAX
No, let's just take some. . .
RAMBLER #2
You're missing a good one. . .on that accordion
RAMBLER
This is one that we put on the album that we recorder in '63
for Chris Strachwitz.  You know Chris don't  you?
A. LOMAX
I don't believe we took any of that purple flower, that
wisteria, that craypmore (sp?)
