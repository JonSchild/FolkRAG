Facts and Figures

Dear Mr. Kaiser:

Our lay-strategists are worrying about the Japanese
foothold in the Aleutians. One of our readers proposes
a home-guard or guerilla army. He thinks that all
workers and other non-combatants young enough to carry 1
a gun should be given a few hours of training a week.
There should be a minimum of discipline or compulsion
about the program, and the equipment need be only
outmoded rifles, but our borrower believes every
able-bodied male should know enough of the rudiments of
home defense to be useful in time of emergency.

Something like cynicism has crept into what was
formerly disappointment about the delay of the second 4
front. Now the question – "When is it coming?" is
likely to be answered with a knowing smile, "You aren't
still expecting it, are you?" But it would be a mistake
to lay too much emphasis on this disillusion. Our
neighbors are mercurial – as ceaselessly in flux as
the headline writers who materially form their opinions.

Far more dismaying is the kind of disillusion
sometimes revealed in chance anecdotes about defense plants.
You hear about workers "soldiering on the job". Another
borrower notices that the old speed-up system has been
relaxed; everyone takes it easy now that the company is 7-b
making army equipment. A young man under thirty will
tell that his job in the ship-yards, which has so far
kept him in the deferred class, is one that any woman
could perform.

But these are rare contacts. It is no empty
generalization to say that our public is not only
solidly, but stolidly, behind the war effort. The
really great reserves of patience and endurance are
still untouched.

Sincerely,

Harriet Feldmann
