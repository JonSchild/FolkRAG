Dear Alan:
I had simply a swell time with you, your father,
Mr. Seegar, and Roy Stryker the other day and I am very
struck with the list of commercially-recorded American
folk songs which you have made up. Knowing the interest
of Vice-President Wallace in such Americana, I would suggest 
that you send him a copy of your list. I think he
will enjoy it as much as I did.
Sincerely yours,
Jim McCamy
