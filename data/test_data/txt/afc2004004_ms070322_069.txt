roof of the inner church was warm
& pink. I have seen nothing finer
than this - things more passionate,
but nothing expressing with such
charm & coolness the desire that
we have to be linked with the
ancient armored trades of the stars.
Here again as in Hampton Court -
there was sunlight, candor and 
richness but with simplicity.

In the niches the crumbling effigies
of the knights toes turned up & palms
joined gazed sightless [at the] out of cool
decaying limestone.

The inner chapel is intred vols.
with whales, elephants , gargoyles,
ostriches upon the edges of the
benches to remind the deans at
home that imperial adventures
abroad in the jungles of faraway
oceans & continent paid for their cushions.
