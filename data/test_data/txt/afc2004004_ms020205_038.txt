Reverend Roe. Reel 1. P. 4
Well, I'll tell you about that. Now after [hen] I was drunk and I had a brawl [on the part of some]
there with some white [smart] fellows that was awful mean. I had a pistol; I was a real good
shot with a pistol, and the reason the fell ow didn't kill me was
because he was afraid I would kill him, 'cause I had a pistol, but
I never thought of my gun; I was too drunk. [He] they locked me up in a
seed bin, nd I stayed in there and I sobered up, and [ad] they told me about
the things that I'd done, and I told them, I says, "well, I'll never
do that again." I was seventeen years old and I'm now seventy-seven, [eighty] the 18th
years old now and I haven't taken a dram since.
I never gambled [gambling a lot] in my life. In fact, I've been very careful in my life.
I've never been a rogue [robbed], never stole ,anything, [ad I] and I think the reason why when I was just a boy, I don't how old -- I

in the thicket [and] than sheaf [sheath]. And I was praying that night. There was
something, I don't know, mysterious, seemed to happen to me that sort
of changed my whole life, and from that time on I never could partake
of those things. You see, there'd been something that kept me, [but] however I
didn't join the church at that time, but I was always religiously inclined
and I attended Sunday school [at] and churc h. And one of the reasons I
didn't join the church was because there were so many different denominations
and they was preaching different doctrines I didn't know who was right. I 
set to find out; I began to read [reading] my Bible. And when I was twe ty-one
years old my father didn't give me anything, he just told me I 
was grown [gron] and I could go for myself. I went to work for a Mr. Lee there [then].
I worked for him for twenty-five dollars a month and I lost one day
that year [in] the 4th July. My father asked me to let him use my money, and
at the end of the year he would pay me. But that year I bought one [many] of
