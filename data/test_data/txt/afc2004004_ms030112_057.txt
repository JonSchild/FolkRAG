TAPE 1 ---- MRS. DAVIS & LARRY JOHNSON

LARRY:
Ah, Mrs. Davis tell me how did you and Rev. Davis ever wind 
up here in the Bronx. In back of those buildings up there, where 
you can't see nobody and nobody could see you. How, how did you 
ever get up there.

MRS. DAVIS:
Well how we wound up getting back there, because the city 
picking house near Webster Avenue the city taken it over and so 
we found a little place back there ourselves. The city put me, 
it was on Brook Avenue, I didn't like that spot so we found a 
little place 3826 Park Avenue, I found it, and we moved in a 
little private house but ---

LARRY:
It was nice, but. When I met Rev. Davis and you were out
there, it just looked to me, I couldn't believe he was such a 
good musician and all, and you were there, you know.

MRS. DAVIS:
Well we were there for the time being, that was all, for 
the time being we were there. As a matter of fact that city was 
moving everybody out, they moved us on I think it was 
82 Brook Avenue, there were so many bad people around me, he 
didn't like that too much. So we got this house by ourselves, 
nobody gave it to us, I found it myself and thats why we're here. 
Only there for the time being.
