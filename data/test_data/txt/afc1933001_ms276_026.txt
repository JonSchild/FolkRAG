Got a high-ball Wheeler, and a western tongue;
Gon' stick it in the bottom, good pardner, if it breaks my arm.

c) The Negro convict sings the ballad of Long John, who out-
ran all the prison dogs and horses and laughed at them while
he did it.  The recording was made by four Negro convicts,
chopping in pairs at the base of a big live oak in South Texas.

LONG JOHN

Chorus:

Leader
He's a long JOhn,
He's a long gone,
Well a turkey through the corn,
In the long corn.

Well a John sed,
In the 10 chap 10,
"If a man die,
He will live again,
Well that crucified Jesus,
Well that nailed him to the cross,
Sister Mary cried,
My child is lost.

Chorus:
Well long John,
Long gone,
Long gone,
John, John,
Big eye John,
Long John,
He's a long gone.

Says come on gal,
And shut that do',
Turkeys is a comin',
And I gotta go.

It's a long John,
He's a long gone,
He's a long gone.

In a two, three minutes,
I'm gone again,
He's a long John,
He's a long gone,
He's a long gone,
He's a long gone.

Leader
Well my John sed,
Jus' befo' he did,
Well I'm gwine home,
See Mary led.

It's a long John,
O long John,
With his long clothes on,
Jus' skippin' through the corn.

Well John sed,
On the fourth day,
Tell my rider,
That I'm on my way.

He's a long John,
He's a long gone,
He's a long gone,
He's a long gone,
It's a long gone.

Gonna call this summer,
Ain' go'n' call no mo',
If I call next summer,
Be in Baltimo'.

He's a long gone,
He's a long John.

d) Allen Prothero, convict, sinks his pick into the road and
hollers about this woman, Jumpin' Judy.

JUMPIN' JUDY

Jumpin' Judy; Jumpin' Judy; Jumpin' Judy
All over this worl'; All over this worl'.
Gonna take this ol' hammer
Give it back to Jumpin' Judy;
Give it back to Jumpin' Judy;
Lawd, and tell her I'm gone,.
Lawd, and tell her I'm gone, oh, Lawd.
