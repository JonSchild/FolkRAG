The Kid:  . . .if you found a worm in there an' say, "Captain,
here's a worm in my greens," he'd say, "What the
 hell you expect for nothin'."
Natchez:  (Joining him in his wild, crazy laughter. Big quaw
quaw[sx] coming from all three). . . Yeah, yeah, I've 
 heard 'em say that. . .
The Kid:  (Speaking quickly to get it all in, to leave nothing
out of his joke). .Some fella over 'long the table
would say, (shouting) "Gimme that piece of meat."
One of these things. . .I mena, those guys seem to get
a kick out of that. . .
Natchez:  Wall, in them times, what did you know?. .
The Kid:  Seemed to get a lotta fun [xx] out of it. . .
Natchez:  You didn't know no better. . .
The Kid: (Still savoring it). . ."Give me that piece of meat ---
Don't throw it away."  (And now Sonny, weak with laughter
staggers off around the room, beating the air with
weak arms to rid himself of this laugh that is stabbing
at his ribs. . .In the calm and after a pause, Natchez
poses the next question quietly. . .)
Natchez:  You ever see those guys, called 'table-walkers'?
The Kid:  Yeah, yeah. . .
Natchez:  They'd snatch out their forty-five and get up on
 one end of [xxxxxx] a great, long mess-table and walk
 right on down, trompin' in ev'ybody's plate, snatchin'
 up yo' food. . .
The Kid:  Those guys were what you call 'tough peoples'.
Natchez:  Yeah, 'cause he know he gonna get a whuppin'. . .
