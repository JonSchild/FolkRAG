UNION JUNIORS

On Wisconsin-- From Wisconsin's "Union Junior Songs"

Union Juniors! Union Juniors!
Work with all your might.
Let no other group distract you
From doing what is right.
We will boost the Union Program
Clear up to the sky.
This is every farmer's battle--
Do or die!

Union Juniors! Union Juniors!
Help the Union grow!
Fight for Liberty and Justice.
You will win, we know!
Co-operation is the watchword--
Unity the Goal.
Together we will keep 
The Golden Rule.

HE WEARS A UNION BUTTON
Round Her Neck She Wore A Yellow Ribbon--

On his coat he wears a Union button,
He wears it in the winter and the summer, so they say,
And if you ask him why the decoration,
He says, "I'm in the Union and I'm in to stay--
In to stay, into stay!
And he wears it milking cows or mowing hay,
'round the town he wears a Union button, 
He says, I'm in the Union and I'm in to stay!."

WHEN YOU DROVE A TRUCK

When you Wore a Tulip--

When you drove a Buick, a big yellow Buick,
And I drove a little red Ford,
When you went around me, you tried to guy me,
But your insults I ignored.
Then you struck a mudhole,
A nice, slippery mudhole,
Your engine raced and roared.
Then I pulled out your Buick,
Your big yellow Buick,
At the tail of my little red Ford.

GREETING SONGS
How do you do, everybody, how do you do?
We are glad to see every one of you,
And we hope you'll fall in line,
With our Juniors all the time,
How do you do, everybody, how do you do?

Farmer in the Dell--
We're glad to see you here,
It gives us joy and cheer,
Sure it's true, we say to you,
We're glad to see you here!

How do you do, everybody how do you do?
Farmers Union means a lot to me and you.
Let us all get out and work,
For this is no time to shirk,
How do you do, everybody, how do you do?
We greet you with this song,
We know it won't be long,
Until there's more within our doors
To welcome with this song.
