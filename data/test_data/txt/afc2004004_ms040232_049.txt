FOLKLORE
Another American whom we were 
pleased to have with us for a short 
stay was song-collector Alan Lomax.  
We had the pleasure of meeting this 
impressive Texan during his visit.  He 
made a sincere attempt to obtain 
original data for his collection of 
folk-songs, and he undoubtedly succeeded 
where lots of others have 
failed.  However, in his short stay, 
he purveyed for the B.B.C. semi-Gaelic 
items that were taken to be 
representations of Highland life, but 
these, we are afraid, bore the Lomax 
touch so much that despite his own 
sincerity and their undoubted entertainment 
value they were no longer 
typical of what he meant to portray.
