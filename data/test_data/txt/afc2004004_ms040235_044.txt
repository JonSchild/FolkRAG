3.  The production of such an album is
an enterprise we would prefer to
undertake ourselves as a long term
project.  We do not believe that
recordings of all the material that
should go into it are immediately
available, nor could they be made
within the space of a few weeks, as
we all have heavy commitments in
various other ways at the moment.

4. In view of No 3 above it
is natural that we prefer to
retain the best of our Gaelic folksong
recordings for publication in such an
album, especially as very careful
work will be necessary upon the
texts and translations of such songs.
There are not many people who
are able to edit and translate
such texts and the calls on their
time are already heavy.
