Part of Scandalous John's Wolf Story --
"I studied them buggers just
like I studied horses and cattle
They fool you the best you
ever saw
They are shore smart buggers.
They got a big foot on
'em. Nearly as big as a
hoss. Track 'em to find
their dens.

Track 'em right into their
dens.
Me and another boy found
sixteen loafers all together
We was riding' together
This shinning round the
cap rock [?] makes
a tree. Its funny about
that shinning. We found
the '?] in a patch
of it
