teachers did, you know, [then,] [*I have-*] and my wife had been teaching and I 
assisted her in making that report each month, and a woman came to 
take her place after she had to leave and go home, and she invited me 
out to help her [pastor- I'd] [*as she hadn't*] been accustomed to that, you know. I went 
outthere that night and I stayed til I guess [around] [*round*] eleven o'clock, and 
I started home. I was bach[eler] [*?*]; my wife had gone, you know. [a] [*A*]nd I 
got a little ways [and] [*from her house and for some cause, I don't know, I*] looked back and there was a light [*?*], the rays of a light, [shining in back] across the road behind me. It kinda made me 
feel funny because I could look each way[s] a[n]d couldn't see no light
an I [c]ouldn't see why there would be rays of a light [when] [*and*] there 
was no light. I went on, thinking about it, [*and] looked up, and it was 
shining in front of me. Noe then it was behind me and before behind me. 
And I [kinda] [*just*] felt [*like*] I was [*almost] in a dream or something. I [woked up] [*walked out*] and I looked 
down at the gravels in the light, and it was just [boulder] [*bordered*] , just like

did, it just seemed like [*just*] somet[*h*]ing [*just*] come up just like when your foot

[knees] [*?*] and I prayed, I don't know how long [and I prays] [*I was in that place*] and final[y][*l*]ly I 
said, "WEll, I don't know. Maybe something gonna happen to me.[*Don't know what it is.*]".
And I got up and someting just seemed [*when I stepped out of it*] like to say to me]"you ought to
[have] pulled off your shoes." And Isaid, "Lord, you know, I didn't
know." That's what I said. I got back in [there], but I [pulled off] [*never did think about pulling*]
my shoes[*off*], and I prayed again, and then when I got up [.I] [*and*] walked [*out of it again*], I 
walked a little piece and [*I*] looked back, and it was gone. I went
