Fish 21, 7

3:
I know you gon' rock me
In the Bosom of Abraham
O rock-a my soul.

3: 
O come down, angels, trouble the water
O rock-a my soul.

O watch the sun, how study she run,
O rock-a my soul,
O don't let her catch with your words undone,
O rock-a my soul

3:
O rock-a my soul
O rock-a my soul

I 'member the time % I 'member it well,
When my Lawd freed my soul from Hell
