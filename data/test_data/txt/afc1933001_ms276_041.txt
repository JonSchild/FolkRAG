it wouldn't have happened if they hadn't gone to their union.
Instead they would have been fired, and when the new money
came through new workers would have been employed, and
they would have been on the outside, trudging around looking
for jobs, worrying about the rent and the grocery bill and the
shirts that were fraying and the bill at the department store, and
having a devil of a time

But now they are working, and they owe it to their union.
And when they add up what the union means to them, they add
up the fact that their rent is paid, and the fact that their grocery
bills are almost up to date, and the fact that they can go to a 
movie once in a while. To them the union adds up and there is 
no mistake about it.

But there is the chief of the section. Suppose he takes a total.
First of all he has fourteen workers in his office and they know
their work, and there wasn't any need for training a lot of new
people.

Unions in a government office add up, no matter whether you
add touch system on a Sunstrand, or go up a column with a
pencil. They add up to a good thing. They mean security and
regular paychecks to government workers and they mean efficient 
employees to employers.

You Don't Have To Be Fired To Need A Union

Take another case in another department. These workers
weren't fired but the union helped them too. There were twelve
of them, CAF-1, making $1260 a year less the 3 1/2 percent retirement
deduction. They were employed to file and for a while they
did file, but then the computing in the office got behind and they
were put to running Marchands. Now they didn't mind running
the Marchands, in fact they liked it. Computing is a lot less
dull than filing. But then they learned that all the other computers
were making $1440 and were on a CAF-2 classification.
If it had been just temporary they wouldn't have minded, but 
they were given computing to do permanently only no one ever
bothered to raise their pay or reclassify them.
