7.  Experience in research; publications or work ready for publication:

Five and a half years of field work in American folk song.  Co-editor
of "American Ballads and Folk Songs," "Negro Folk Songs as Sung by
Lead Belly" and "Cowboy Songs", with John A. Lomax.  "Sinful Songs
of the Southern Negro", and "Haitian Journey" in the Southwest
Review.

8.  Description of plan of study: character, scope, method, plan of work, presumable contribution
to training; when commenced; progress to date; expectation as to completion:

Since this is my first month of graduate work, it is difficult for me to
say what the "scope, method and plan of work" for the Ph. D I eventually hope
to get will be.  I can, however, say that the work I am doing in anthropology
and music will equip me to do far better field work than formerly.  At the
present writing I am interested in anthropological method, linguistics and the
musicological approach to folk and primitive music.  By June I expect to be
able to handle both phonetic and musical transcription with some degree of
ease, to know how to plan and execute field work in accordance with modern
anthropological methodology, and to have acquired a fair acquaintance with
general anthropological literature.
