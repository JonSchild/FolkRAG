time.   But he did tell the folks, "Well, I really just ought just 
let it go."  He said, "Don't kill 'em."  He said, "Kill me first." 
 An' he had his --                    that long -- I seen it many 
[???] times, when they, in his apartment.  Long gun.  He had a lil' 
ol' car called a 'Skeeter.  He put Louella on that Skeeter an, 
him an' her, man, they be gone.  It would like the gas goin' in 
the back of it there, you know.  Man, they be ridin' up a storm.  
He jus' natchully loved 'er.   Tha's all.   He left there.  So 
they figure he goin' so they let him go.   Then they come to 
New York.   Mr. Koston had a brother up here, in New York.   An' 
tha's why he come on up here.   An' he sure tol' them that that day.  
That was a time then!  They didn't know what the devil to do, 
'cause they know that they done anything that he was gonna kill 
someone else.  He had his gun.  Brother.  They was a 
rough, tough.
TL:         Well, people usually kill more than anything else in 
these affairs, huh?
BJ:         They knowed he woulda done it if they'd ahurt her.  
'Cause he told 'em, he loved [her] the girl.  He strickly loved her.  An' 
love's the highest                                                         force.   An' 
so that's why I don' want to love nothin' that I don't ought to 
want to love.  Jus' get out the way of that stuff.   Ha, ha.  
                                                        'an stay away from it.  An' so, I 
wouldn't say he didn't, 'cause he really did... Got Louella away 
from there.  'Cause they 'low her jus' a space of time to be gone 
an' don't come there no more.  So he went with it.  Ha, he went 
with the time, right 'long with 'er.
TL:         Did you ever see Willard again?
