Subject:  Rumor Clinics

October 13, 1942

        The best known rumor clinics are the ones in Boston and Philadelphia.
The Boston Rumor Clinic runs weeky in the Boston Herald and is under
the supervision of a special division in the Massachusetts Committee on
Public Safety.  Attached is a reprint of a rumor clinic column and a mimeographed
circular describing the organization, aims, and program of the group
sponsoring the rumor clinic column.  This has a listing of the advisory
board in the Boston set-up.  The key people are actually Gordon W. Allport
and Robert H. Knapp.  This clinic represents the combination of the Civilian
Defense set-up, Harvard University and a Boston newspaper.  It has received
the greatest national publicity and it is reported to have received requests
from 46 different agencies such as chambers of commerce, civilian defense
groups, universities, newspapers in this country and Canada.

        Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:  In the newspaper the Inquirer, there
is a rumor clinic.  This clinic is run by the newspaper and appears every
Friday.  It is an attempt by the newspaper to render a special service.
Eight Philadelphians are serving as a committee of experts in guiding this
clinic, but they do not have actual control over the preparation of the column
as far as I know.  Judge Gerald F. Flood, of Common Pleas Court 6, is
Chairman of the Advisory Board.  Members are:  Dr. Joseph Fort Newton, Rector
of the Episcopal Church of Saint Lake and the Epiphany; James M. Skinner, retired
industrialist and philanthropist; Arthur C. Kaufman, President of the
Philadelphia Merchants Association; Dr. Alexander J. Stoddard, Superintendent
of Schools; Dr. Edwin J. Twitmyer, Professor of Psychology at the
University of Pennsylvania; Herbert E. Millen, Assistant Director of Public
Safety, and Walter H. Annenberg, Vice President of the Inquirer.

        In New York City:  The newspaper, the World Telegram, is running
a column which seems to be the start of a regular series.  The release October
3, was headed "Spike That Rumor".  More like it were promised for the future,
but no outside sponsorship was indicated.  A newspaper item indicated at the
Psychology Club at New York University under the guidance of Professor George
B. Vetter was developing a rumor clinic.  So far, we have not seen anything
produced by them.

        In Suffolk County (Long Island) New York, the Civilian Protection
Office of the County War Councel is setting up a rumor clinic according to an
announcement by Floyd D. Houston, Civilian Protection Director.  Their headquarters
are in Riverhead, Long Island.  So far, we have not seen anything
produced by them.  In Syracuse, New York, there is a joint university-newspaper
organization, the Post Standard is combining with Syracuse University.
J. Leonard Gorman is the newspaper man and Warren B. Walsh seems to be the key
man of the Syracuse University Rumor Clinic.  It is worth noting that at Syracuse
