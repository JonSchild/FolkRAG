Mr. Alan Lomax

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

In order to properly clear the songs that are to
appear in the Teacher's Manual in the "Folk Music of America"
series we must have the page number and volume of all those
songs which I am listing below:

"The Chisholm Trail"
"Santa Anna"
"Ox Driving Song"
"Springfield Mountain"
"Shoot the Buffalo"
"I Married Me a Wife"
"Samson"
"The Cowboy's Lament"
"Tamp 'em Up Solid"
"De Ballit of de Boll Weevil" [*- 296 ABFS*]
"Chilly Winds"

We understand that you received permission from
Joana Colcord to reproduce "Boston Come-All-Ye", which appeared
in a book published by W. W. Norton. If this permission
is in writing will you please send it to us as soon as
possible? If it is not in writing will you please let us 
have Miss Colcord's address?

As you know we are trying to get the Manual ready
as quickly as possible, so will you be good enough to let us
have this information at your earliest convenience?

Sincerely,

Marjorie Sanborn

Assistant in the
AMERICAN SCHOOL OF THE AIR
