That song when we was chillen. Used
to be a li'l' boy came to mama's
house & he couldn' set down without
he begin to sing that song.

Honey, I'm all out & down
Mules & de hosses nicklin' for dey oats & hay
Women in de bottom shouting' 'cause it's
mos' pay-day
O lawdy (2)
or
O baby (2)
----
I'm goin' tell you like the Dago tol' the Jew
If you don' want me baby, I don' want
    you,
Women in bottom hollin' "Wo-haw-gee"
Men's in the levy camp hollin'  "Doncha
    murder me"

When I was skinin' for Johnny Ryan
I would put my  'nitials  on the
    mules' behin'
