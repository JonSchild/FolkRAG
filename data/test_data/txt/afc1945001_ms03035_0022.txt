Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Kane:

Attached are our departmental and
branch reports on rumors current in this area. I
am sending all of them to you just as they were
reported for I feel that you rather than I will be
able to weigh the importance of each.

I am inclined to believe that there
may be some local repercussions to the article
appearing in Life magazine for August 17, on
"Detroit Is Dynamite" but as yet there has not
been time for these to be recorded. It is quite
possible that such rumors may be too local in
character to be of interest to you. However, if
we get anything that appears to be significant, I'll
send it on.

Very truly yours,
[*Ralph A. Ulveling*]
Librarian
