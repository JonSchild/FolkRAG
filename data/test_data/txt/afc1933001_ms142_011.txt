Dear Alan Lomax:

   I have just heard from Dr. Harold Spivacke
that I cannot secure a record of Jelly Roll Morton's "Tiger
Rag".  I am grateful to you, nevertheless, for the suggestion
and for your reply to my earlier letter.

   As I expect to be in Washington in March
or April, could we meet?  I cannot be sure of my exact dates
until later this month.

   Would you also tell me how I might arrange
to hear the Morton record and others in the Archives?

Sincerely,
Rickard Leekley
