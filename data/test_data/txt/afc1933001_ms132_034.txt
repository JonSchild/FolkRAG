Mrs. Josephine Caney
Vincennes
Indiana

Dear Mrs. Caney:

Of course we didn't meet quite everyone in
the state, but you were so superlative, I think
we can safely say you are the nicest person in
Indiana. We were both sorry to go away and leave
you. It would have been much better to collect
you and bring you back to Washington instead of
your songs alone. We are, however, happy to have
that much of Vincennes here in Washington and, as
soon as it can be arranged, we'll come back and
take down the rest of what you know and have a
longer visit with you.

May I extend to you the appreciative thanks
of the Music Division and the Library of Congress
for the contribution you have made.

Votre ami,

Elizabeth sends her love.
