Dear Mr. Lomax:
You wired us a few weeks ago that you
might go to Virginia next week. Will
you let me know what developed on this
projected trip? If you are going will
you wire collect when and where you'll
be--we can have our photographer get in
touch with you.
If you aren't going to Virginia next week,
when do you think we might get a picture
such as we wrote you about earlier?
Sincerely yours,
Eleanor Stierhem
