are hoarders and there are defense
workers who take too many days
off, I know some, but although
I'm not "in the know", I'm willing 
to bet that they're the exceptions, and
not the average. People have gone
to defense meetings, attended Red
Cross classes, and said good-bye
to many Army, Navy, or Marine recruits
who were close to them. If that
doesn't wake a country up. what
will? America today is alert
and cautious, not complacent.
