Dear Alan:

Just got your nice letter this morning, and
though I realize I am breaking a Lomax precedent by
doing so, have decided to answer now; since I have a
few spare minutes. Charlie and Arthur are out battering
down doors in UAW halls-- their usual daily procedure--
and Butch is practicing the guitar, and for some
strange and unaccountable reason I have nothing at the
moment to do.

Please by all means send us whatever records
you can lay your hands on. We are badly in need of
musical stimulation. Two days ago we met a soldier
from Louisiana who came up and played us some Jimmie
Rogers blues and we've been working on his tunes ever
since in a sort of last-gasp way that rather troubles
me. He sang one very nice blues that started off
"Where was you woman when the train left the shed?
Standin' in my back door wishin' to God I was dead."
And then he knew an extremely funny song, "When It's
Apple-Pickin' Time in Georgia" about a guy who is overwhelmed
by the number of states that are "calling"
him.

We are still at a cross-roads trying to decide
what to do. There seem to be two alternatives: to hole
in here for the winter with our minds made up to stay
on whether we get enough Almanac work to keep us alive
or not-- there are lots of other jobs floating around.
Or else we can start planning tours, probably invloving
a trip to Texas for the Oil-Workers and from there to
the West Coast. Arthur and Charlie want to stay here
and try and do a solid job for the UAW, even though
they still are not universally open-arms to us. If we
do stay, the character of our work would probably
change. Many Union officials point out that the guys
want to hear us two or three times and then ask for
some tight-rope walkers, please-- in other words our
stuff is not varied enough to suit them. To keep ourselves
constantly useful to the unions we would have
to do much more song-teaching,, would probably have to
