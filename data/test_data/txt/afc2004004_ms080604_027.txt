[*26*]

It ain't time yet
But it won't be long
That's why you hear me singin'
This a-lonesome song

A-git up, boys
Put on your clothes
Eat your breakfast
Git ready to roll

I ain't goin
But you got to go
That's why that
I'm tellin you so

Ain't you ready?
A-boy, ain't you ready?
Ain't you ready?
A-boy, ain't you ready?

Joe Savage (singing:)
I don't know
But a I was told
A-when you git here
You got the solid rule

They say, "Ride."
"Ain't you ready to leave?"

Oh, big leg Rosie
And her big leg drawers
She got me wearin these striped overalls
 
Ain't you ready?
Mmmm. . .

A.L.: 
Show us how the man beat the thing.

W.B.:
Huh?

A.L.:
Show us how the man beat the thing.
