REVEREND GARY DAVIS

Gary Davis was born April 30, 1896[1] in Laurens, S.C.[2], a poor, predominantly black, rural toan. His parents were John and Evelencia Davis. It seems that Gary's father was killed by some whites while Gary was still a child.[3] Gary was raised by both his mother and his grandmother, though he was much more attached to his grandmother. The few times he talked about his childhood with me, he would speak fondly of his grandmother and hardly mention his mother. His grandmother took him to church with her.
     It is hard to determine when Gary went Blind, but it
was certainly at an early age.  Gary's nephew, Joseph McCLean
said that he remembered Gary saying he went blind when his
mother put some salve on his eyes; and article in Blues Unlimited
(Sept., 1965) says "he was blinded when only a few
months old, suffering with ulcers on his eyes; a doctor used
too strong a lotion, so his grandmother told him"
     According to the same article, Gary learned how to play
harp when five years old; his "uncle-in-law" would by him
one whenever he bought himself one, and then banjo at age six
and guitar at seven.  He taught himself to play guitar, and
then his mother bought him one, for eighteen dollars.

1.  It may be possible that Gary was born before this date, as
his birthdate has never been documented.
2.  In previous accounts Laurens has been spelt all sorts of
ways, and there has been confusion as to whether Gary was 
born inLaurens County or in the town of that name (which
is in that town) According to Bruce Bastin he was from th
town
