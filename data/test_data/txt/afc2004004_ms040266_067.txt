Dear Mr. Lomax 
Thank you for your
letter received yesterday on
my return from London.
I went up on the 2nd 
to contact you, but the
smog put an end to my
plans for it irritates
my throat so badly that 
I nearly cough my lungs
out and brings back my
asthma which I had got
rid of in Norway. 
I hope to be luckier with
the weather next time, for 
I do want to see you. 
I can come up again
early next week and
