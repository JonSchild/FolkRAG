TAPE 80: JEAN ROBERTSON.
1) When I was Noo But Sweet Sixteen
And beauty justnin blooming-o,
O little, little did I think at nineteen I'd be greeting-o.
Fp the ploughman lads the gay wee lads,
They're false and deceiving-o,
They'll said awa' and gang awa'
And they leave their lassie greetingo-.

2) For if I had kenned whatI do ken,
And ta'en my mother's biding-o,
I wouldn't be sitting at your fir4side,
Crying hishy-ba, my bairnie-o.

Bonnie Annie: (Andrew Lammie)
Well the song about Tifty's Annie is over three hundred years
old because she was the miller of Fyvie's daughter, and the Laird
of Fyvie was in love with her and he wanted to marry her. But a 
trumpeter cameto him belonging to Edinburgh - they called him
Andrew Lammie. He was very, very handsome, and one day he met her
in a place they called Tifty's Glen, and he met here there, and 
both of them fell in love with each other. So of course, shewas
true to the day she died, and of course, she got killed for him.
She got her back broken, she loved him too much. But he loved
her also. But her people didn't want him as they wanted the Laird
with his money. So they broke her back for the loving of Andrew
Lammie. So one day when they got him away to Edinburgh town, they
killed her. So she died for love.
Lomax: Did people really do that?
Jean: That was wuite true. That was a true story.
Lomax: They did things like that back in those days?
Jean: Yes, I could tell ye. Jean and George and Hamish was up and 
saw her grave; and they had a look right around and saw what
they call the Weeping Stone. It shes water every now and again,
and they call it the weeping stone. It is in the graveyard some
peace. And it's over 300 years old since that happened. And
her grave is buried up in the old churchyard at Fyvie. And that's
what she said before she was killedd that she would be brueid
there.
1) Up the mill of Tiftie there lived a man,
In the neighborhood of Fyvie,
He had a lovely daughter fair,
Who's name was bonnie Annie.
