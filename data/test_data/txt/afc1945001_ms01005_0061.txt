Dear Mr. Editor:

As an American scientific Astrologer, I therefore wish to state that the 
Stars Say that for the next thirty days I find that a most unusual amount of 
sabotage will be in evidence throughout the country, and that a great fire 
or explosion will occur in either the White House or Capitol, and that the 
life of our great President will be in jeopardy, and that much serious 
internal troubles will occur in the nature of serious riots and sympathetic 
strikes throughout the country, and that our Militia and Police will be 
called out to suppress such, and that much loss of life and property will 
be sacrificed, hence, extra precautions should be taken.

Yours truly,
(Signed) Prof. Gustave Meyer
