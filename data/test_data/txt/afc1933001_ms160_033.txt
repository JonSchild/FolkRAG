THE CHARACTER OF THE BOOK

     All of the songs will be folk songs typical of the
region, chosen for their general masculine appeal and on the
basis of their wide currency and acceptance. Their altogether-
flavor will be, - salty, swashbuckling, ironic, 
humorous and sentimental in the democratic vein of the American
people.

     Since the books will be used as supplements to more conventional
books in all likelihood, it is extremely important that
they not be conventional or proper. They will contain the words
to familiar ballads that everyone has always wanted to have but
which have always been in expensive or rare collections. And the 
book should be so beautiful that they'll be kept as souvenirs by 
the soldiers and sent home to their families.

     The musical editing of this series can be handled entirely
by Dr. Seeger and the projected staff of the Library of Congress
Music Project. The decoration can probably be done under
the supervision of Cook Glascoe of the Art Project. The Archive
of American Folk Song should appear as editor of the series.
