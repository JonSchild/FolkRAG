Mr. Harold Spivacke
Acting-Chief, Division of Music
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

    I am so sorry we did not meet last week, but hope we
shall soon.

    News has just come from Mr. Wise at Columbia that
his experiments in dubbing over the metal discs have failed.
He says in all events that, despite his best efforts, there is
so much surface noise and scratch in the finished product that
Columbia cannot consider putting it on regular sale. So, as
we, of course, could not undertake to have such a disc made
exclusively for the Carnegie Corporation music sets, we have
reluctantly had to abandon the idea, at least for the time being.
I am doubly sorry in this because, if I am not mistaken, Lomax
collected the material under a grant which the Carnegie Corporation 
made to your Division.

    Miller is still abroad but should be back within a
week, so unless you are in any particular hurry, I'll leave
the matter of returning the discs to you until he arrives.

    Sincerely yours,
    Eric T Clarke
    Eric T. Clarke
