Dear Mr. Lomax:

As I told you in my previous letter we are still investigating
the financial complications unfortunately resultant from your trip
last fall. Believe it or not, I think we see daylight ahead. 

At present the situation seems to size up something like this.
Out of the allotted $1500, payment of $1309.45 has already been
made to you and Mrs. Lomax. We still must pay out $140.33 for expenses 
incurred by you as you traveled to Washington. If you and 
we could be absolutely sure that no more charges were outstanding,
you could expect to receive the balance which amounts to $50.22 I
hope in the next few days we can receive sufficiently definite in-
formation so that we can proceed to settle the matter once and for
all. 

The figures as given about should give you a clear picture of
the account as it now stands. As a matter of fact, if you know of
any charges which may come into us in addition to the obligated
$140.33 it will be very helpful if you will tell us about them.
Meanwhile please believe that we regret this delay just as much as 
you do.

With best regards to you and Miss Terrell,

Sincerely yours,

Edward N. Waters
