During army maneuvers down 
South a women was going to walk across
a bridge.  A soldier guarding the bridge
told her that it had been destroyed 
the other day.  She hadn't heard about the
army maneuvers, and she thought the
soldier was a little crazy because 
she could see the bridge as plain 
as day.  Seeing another soldier standing
near by, she asked him if
the soldier guarding the bridge was
all right mentally.  He said, "I 
wouldn't know ma'am, I've been
dead for three days."
