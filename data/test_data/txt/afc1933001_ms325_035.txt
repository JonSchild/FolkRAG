THE NATION'S NO. 1 ECONOMIC
PROBLEM
   It is my conviction that the South
presents right now the Nation's No.
1 economic problem - the Nation's 
problem, not merely the South's. For 
we have an economic unbalance in
the Nation as a while, due to tis
very condition of the South.
   It is an unbalance that can and 
must be righted, for the sake of the 
South and of the Nation.
    - Franklin D. Roosevelt.

N. I. C. B. Data
   The National Industrial Conference
Board data as presented in National Income
and Its Elements do not show the
South in 1929 to have been in a different
position in the income scale from that
indicated by the Brookings Institution.
   The South's per capita figure of $351
was 53 per cent of the national average of 
$660, but 47 per cent of the average figure
for the rest of the country. To state
it another way, the person outside the 
South had more than twice as much money
to spend. The deficiency of the South
is clearly seen in the fact that, with approximately
22 per cent of the population,
it received only 11.8 per cent of the 
national income. Twelve of the sixteen
states ranking lowest in per capita income
were in the South.

Significance of the Condition
   The analysis of Southern income based
on these three independent, authoritative
estimates has necessarily been somewhat
superficial, but has evolved at least one
indisputable fact, namely, that Southern
income with respect to population is about
half that of the rest of the country. The
real significance of the lowness of the 
South's income lies essentially in the fact 
that cost of living between the South and 
other parts of the country are comparable, 
if not virtually equal. Difference in
money income therefore serve largely to

   The South being predominantly rural,
the question of comparative living costs
to the same standard between the country
and the city is an important one. But it
is likewise an unanswered and very difficult
one - of practical import but theoretical 
nature. If it is true, as is often maintained,
that living costs are cheaper in 
rural areas, then it is also true that the 
South, which is predominantly rural, will 
not need so great a per capita income as in 
other regions to experience a comparable
adequacy of living. Its total living costs
as realized through money income will
not be as great. In the main, however,
the above mentioned conjecture, even if a 
fact, could not be of sufficient importance
to compensate for the wide income differential
between the South and the rest of
the country.
   Many factors are responsible for the 
low income condition of the South. Several
may be briefly mentioned. Of primary
importance is the prevailing agricultural 
and colonial type of economy in the
South, couples with the lowest epr capita
farm income in the nation and the lowest
productivity per farm worker. Secondly,
a lower scale of wages and salaries is paid
in the South. Then, too, low-wage industries
and employments, such as the textile 
and lumber industries, dominate the 
Southern economy. Of comparatively 
slight significance is the relatively small
number of Southerners belonging to the
higher income classes.

Improving the Situation
   There is no easy, quick way to improve
the South's income level. Just as a combination
and interaction of many complex
factors have produced over a period of 
many decades the present economic and
social plight of the South, so it will be a 
matter of decades before the region can
have hoped to throw off this heritage of
the past, which today means low incomes
and low living standards for millions of 
the Southern population. The broad policy
to be followed in the region seems to
center about a reconstruction and reform 
of agriculture, and an increase and sound
guidance of the ever-quickening trend

one to the other. This policy is a sort
of middle ground between the one advocated
by the proponents of agrarianism on
the one hand, and those of industrialization
on the other.
   More specifically, the reconstruction of
agriculture involves the old, old story of 
"tempering specialization with diversification"
and of eradicating the baneful effects
of tenancy. The South's emphasis
on its two cash crops, cotton and tobacco,
is far too great. Diversification of crops
and greater emphasis on livestock production
has long been urged as a means of
raising the incomes and living standards
of the small farm operators in Southern
cotton and tobacco areas where cash crops 
are practically the only source of income.
Feed and food could be produced that
the South, under a debtor economy, now 
buys from the North and West. A major
part of the farm income would be derived 
from home consumption of agricultural
produce.
   The last half century has witnessed a
rapid and steady advance in Southern industrialization,
based chiefly upon the
availability of a large supply of cheap
labor, hydro-electric power development, 
and upon the growing recognition of the
region's rich natural resources. The lower
costs of production thus made possible 
have resulted in the South's resources -
raw materials, labor and savings - being exploited 
by a migration of industry from
the North often encouraged by promotional 
activities. Industry must come to
the South, but it must be guided along
sound and intelligent lines. It should be
wisely diversified, sanely decentralized,
and should provide reasonably adequate
wages and living standards. It should be
financed as much as possible with Southern
capital, and the present migration of cheap 
industry should be carefully checked and 
guided. Organizations or bureaus of research
are needed to survey the industrial
possibilities of the various states as integral
parts of the region and to chart an 
intelligent program for their sound exploitation. 
A sound development of industry
