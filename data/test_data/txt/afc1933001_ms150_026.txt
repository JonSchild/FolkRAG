Dear Harold:

The enclosed letter from Mrs. Flanders
indicates that she is at last ready for the Archive
to send it's recording machine to Vermont. Since
we have discussed the desireability of this trip
at length I will at this point merely discuss the
details of the trip.

(One) I can be in Springfield, as requested, 
on the morning of November 3rd, and be free to
work with Mrs. Flaunders until the 13th, at which
time I must be back in New York City. [*(11 days)*]

(Two) I shall use my own car for travel
and for carrying the recording equipment, and
should not imagine that the mileage for the trip
should total more than fifteen-hundred miles, including
the distance between New York and Washington. 

(Three) I am sorry to inform you that both
the machines which I might have expected to be able 
to borrow are not free for this period. Miss
Barnacle's machine is in use, and Mr. Halpert informs
me that the only way to get the loan of his recording
machine is for you to make a request direct to
Colonel Summervill. Rental of a machine for nine
days is out of the question because of the expense
involved and I should therefore recommend that a
new machine be purchased for the Archive, preferably
equipped with a two speed turn-table motor and a
one-b cutting head.
