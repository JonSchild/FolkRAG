[*A.A7S. Recording Expeditions*]

Suggestions for making the material more useful to the Archive 
and the records more easily catalogued. 

1. Give your trip a name, viz, "John Doe's Expedition to Kalamazoo" 
or something of the sort. 

2. Number the records in the order they are recorded, writing or 
stamping the title of your trip and the number of your particular
recording on the top of each record envelope. 

3. Scratch or write in the center of each side the letter A or B, 
thus identifying the record side.

4. The strips on each side should be Nos. 1, 2, 3, and etc. in the
order of their cutting and each of these strips should be identified
by giving the title of song as the singer gives it (followed by the recordists' title or other title), and name of singer (s) with instrumentation, the place of the recording and the 
date. The slip cover, where such notations are generally made,
should then look like this:

A1 -- Barbara Allen, sung by John Doe with guitar and fiddle
by Jim Henry, Pasedana, N.Y.
A2 -- etc.
A3 -- etc.
A4 -- etc.

B1, B2, B3, B4, etc.(other side).

5. Naturally, we hope that you will be able to furnish us with a 
great deal of additional material surrounding the recordings,
both, in terms of careful field notes and interesting interviews.
recorded with the songs. You'll find a questionaire enclosed
which has already been used in the field to some extent. It contains
a great amny pertinent suggestions for questions. My personal
opinion is that it is valuable to get the informant talking
eloquently for himself, rather than interrupt him or push him with
questions. The recordings interview can be as significant as the
song itself and is valuable as a fresh field document, especially,
if the informant does not know that the interview is being recorded,
and if he never learns it. 

6. It is very important to record the tunings of all instruments which
play a part in the music, to photograph the instruments and get the
informant to explain how he plays it. In the case of unusual instruments, 
it would be worthwhile to make accurate drwaings or send
the instruments where they could be drawn to scale. If part singing
is recorded, it would be a real contribution to record the parts in
the harmony separately. This can be done by shifting the singers in
