After a while, next one come was Mama.      She come
an' bring me tea cakes an' milk an' stuff, you know, so I could
reach an' git my, have food.  I said, "I know he don' know what he
talkin' about."
He still sit there.  Ya know, and' he didn' say a word or
nothin' about it.  Jest sit right on...
After a while, Mama -- Mama an' Miss Sarah was bof was there --
Miss Sarah, she was doin' sumpin' in the kitchen; Mama was stirrin'
around there.  Either one a them ain't know; ain' know nothin'
about it.  Because --- what he was there for.  An' ah, den, the
fact about it, Mama hadn' see 'im.  Miss Sarah had seen 'im
'cause she'd been in the kitchen.  She seen him sittin' on the
porch, an' she spoke to 'im.
So, anyhow, after a while, here come Bessie.  Nice-lookin', 
ah, bright girl, named Bessie.  She come here an' she tol' Mama,
she says, she says, ah, "Whyn't you all stay home!  I been all
the way, ah, ah, I been to your house huntin' some milk an' ah,
to get some milk," she says, "An' here you 'way over here."
Mama says, "You know I ah, you don't have to go that way
to come to my house."  Says, “You come down the road.  My house across the field.”  She ain't been to Mama's house, 'cause
she come all the way around that way an' Mama's house sit 'way
down here.  She'd been to Mama's house, she's ha' to go down the 
pasture an' come back up, ha, ha, 'way around that way.
An' so!  Mama said, "You ain't been to my house."
There she go, just drivin' (?), yet she know what she was
even talkin’ about.  She says, "I want some milk!  I want some
milk!"  An' she just turnin' around, just turnin; around, she just
turnin' around the flo'.
