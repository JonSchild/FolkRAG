Philadelphia, Pa.
Dear Miss Dealy,
John A. Lomax has sent me your letter [1937-08-21] and I should
like to tell you for the Library that we are much interested
in the songs and ballads you mention. Would
it be possible for you to send copies of your collection
to us for examination and possible permanent deposit in
the Archive of American Folk-Song?
I know the song you mention, but at this moment I
am packing my equipment for an early departure tomorrow
morning for Kentucky. I shall be there for two months
making records of Kentucky folk-songs. In the meantime,
however, let me refer you to two books where you can,
perhaps, find the song:
English Folk-Songs from the Southern Appalachians,
by Cecil Sharp, Volume II.
Folk-Songs of the South, by J.H. Cox.
We look forward to seeing your collection.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
