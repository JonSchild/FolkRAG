JUDICIAL BUSINESS

    After a thorough investigation of your past, your present, and the

serve as judge of contests at T.S.C.W.'s Fourth Annual Corn Husker's
Bee to be held on the Bell Ave Concrete Slab, Tuesday, October 28th
from 7 until 9:30 P.M.

    If you will only accept this appointment our supreme court will
look like this--
