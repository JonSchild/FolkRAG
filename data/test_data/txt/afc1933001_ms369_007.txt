this school of collectors the most important figures from
the point of view of modern scholarship were undoubtedly
Motherwell and Buchan. Motherwell's "Minstrelsy Ancient 
and Modern" contained three hundred untouched ballad versions
that he had picked up from what he called "old singing
women." Besides these, there was a definition of the
ballad that we shall find repeated with emphasis a little more than one hundred years later by Miss
Louise Pound, - "A ballad is a narrative song preserved on
the lips of the people."

Peter Buchan has suffered at the hands of critics.
Little is known of him beyond his collections. He seems
to have collected for the sake of collecting every piece of
doggerel that appeared to him to be "scarce" and "ancient." [*]  [* Use numbers*]
In thi s he did the ballad scholar a favor that few seem to 
appreciate, [by] presenting the ballads in their natural literary
setting and in their true oral form. Because he did
not tamper with his material, either by eliminating what 
was "bad" or by a refining editorship, his versions have
ever since been dubbed "vulgar," "corrupt," "padded,"
"vapid," etc. Nevertheless, the final judgement of the
best scholars - besides Professor Kittredge who has never
collected outside the Bodelian and Harvard Libraries - has
been that Peter Buchan's versions were, even if distasteful
and therefore not quite the "real thing," nonetheless
