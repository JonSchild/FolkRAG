Dear Mr. Becker;
Wilson Teachers College called me shortly 
before your letter came and I arranged to talk for
them for $50.00 on Nov. 18th. I did not think to
inquire if you had contacted them previously. This
was my mistake and I'll not make it again. I'll also
be glad to forward you your commission if you so desire.

It seems to me that Wilson Teachers College
behaved rather badly.

With sincerest regards,
