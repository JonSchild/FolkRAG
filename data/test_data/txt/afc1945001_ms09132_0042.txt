F. N. F.

Two old women were in one of the air raid
shelters in England one day, and one remarked 
to the other one "My goodness, in all this
darkness we're likely to be blasted into
maternity". "Yes," said the other one, "and we
won't even know who 'done' us."

Lick a stamp and Lick a Jap!
Every bond you buy will bomb a city in 
Germany or Japan!
Every stamp you buy will help to stomp out 
a Jap.
