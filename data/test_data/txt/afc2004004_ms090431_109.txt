Fisk, 18. 11.

The children form a circle and one carried it, he carries the handkerchief,
runs around the circle singing till he gets to the part I
believe I'll throw it away, and he drops it behind some person and
runs on saying, you needn't look, It's not behind -- that's to betray
the others from looking behind. And the child who the handkerchief is 
dropped behind take sit up and runs and tries to catch it.

Willie Over the Water.

Willie over the water,
Willie over the street.
Wil lie caught a blackbird
But he can't catch me.

Repeat.

My name is Rosie Sheldon. I live Friar's Pont, Miss. I learned this
song about 25 years ago in Hine's County in Miss. The children form
a circle and clap hands and one is it and get in the center, and they
go around singing. And when they get to the part that you can catch a 
blackbird, but you can't catch me, they dart. The one in the cetner
runs to try to catch one befo re he can dart and if he can, why, that
one is to be It and get in the center of the ring.

Needle Eye.

Oh, you looking for a needle,
And your kiss is so sweet.
Needle eye.
Second fly.
Stick that needle,
Right through the eye.

Oh, you looking for me,
And your kiss is so sweet.
Needle eye.
Second fly.
Stick that needle
Right through the eye.

Oh, you looking so neat,
And your kiss is so sweet.
Needle eye,
Second fly,
Stick that needle
Right through the eye.

I learned this song about 25 years ago at the Gregory school out from
Lion, Miss. I learned the game from the children. They form a line,
and the line marches toward the arch. When the arms of the arch are
raised, the child walks in. And when the arms are raised on the other
side, the child walks out.

A: Does every body sing or just the leader?

Ans. Just the leader singing.
