Dear Mr. James:

     I have been much delayed in preparing the fellowship
application for Rosenwald because I had first to find out whether
gas and tires could be had for your work except by approach to
local boards. It appears that I will not be able to arrange for
anyone to apply from Washington in behalf of these fellowships
and so I have had to revise my plans considerably. It may be
that this necessary delay will bring my letter to Rosenwald too
late. If that is so, please understand that I have been pushing
this whole matter just as hard as I could, but the wheels of
government sometimes grind slowly.

     I am, by the way, suggesting to Rosenwald that in view
of the gas and tire situation, each fellow confine his work to a 
complete study of the folklore of one county against the background
of the social history of the county. From what I have heard from
you, that sort of project would interest you a good deal. I
figured that you could get around in a rural area without needing
to use a car very much. What's your reaction.

     Your comment on the existence of wartime songs and
folklore in Georgia interests me a great deal. This type of
material, it seems to me, has great importance for the war effort
and should be collected. I should like to enlist your voluntary
assistance in gathering and sending to me as much of this sort
of thing as you can find. It can have a wide variety of uses and
I cannot overstress its importance. Would you be willing to do
this and to keep up a correspondence with me from time to time
about these matters?

     I hope to hear from you soon.

     Sincerely yours,
     
     Alan Lomax
