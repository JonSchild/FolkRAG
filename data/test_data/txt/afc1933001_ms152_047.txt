Mr. R. P. Wetherald
RCA Victor
Camden, New Jersey

Dear Mr. Wetherald:

I have to suggestions to make about your 
square dance album.  First, the price you offered Mr.
Seeger and myself is fairly small for two such busy
people as we are.  Secong, the records which you left
with me are mostly pretty bad, not worthy of Victor
or of American folk music.  There are three possible
solutions for your difficulty.  A:  Get in touch with
Ruth Crawford, 9609 Fairway Ave, Silver Springs, Md.
She is co-editor of my fathers and my new book which is
to appear in the spring and a Gugenheim fellow in 
composition.  B:  Make a good set of records with calls,
using one of your current hillbilly orchestras under
expert supervision.  C:  Bring out an album of square
dance tunes of different kinds with directions for
different dances included and using fiddle records that
you already have.  The experience of folk dance leaders
has been that records with calls are extremely difficult
to follow in most cases unless you know the particular
regional figures demanded by those calls.  There is
great variation here.  If you do a new album I certainly
feel that John A. Lomax should be consulted about it.

I am still waiting for the records before 
proceeding with myrecommendations to father. I must be
acquantinted with the whole range of your material before
I can make intelligent choices for him.  I hope to find a 
letter from you when I return from my vacation.  With best
regards, I am,

Sincerely yours,
