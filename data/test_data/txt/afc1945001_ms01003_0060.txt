Mr. Hoover:

                  There is a report being circuated which is purely and simple
propaganda by Foreign Agents though these words seem small they can
gather in motion that can cause an internal eruption.
Its going around to draw your money out of the "Bank" and hide it in
your home as in course of time our government will get In financial
straits they will confiscate all the money in the Banks. It is
your duty to call the proper authorities to this condition and have
this stop in its insipiency.
Have it published over Broadcasted over Radio and if I can get where
it originated I will be glad to let you know.

                                                                        Respectfully

                                                                            American Citizen
