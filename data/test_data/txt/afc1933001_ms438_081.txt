"Just a few lines to you in answer to your little note you
wrote me in Authur's other letter found me not fealing
so well but glad to hear from you though you say that
I don't care for you, well my dear you shouldn't say that
but for the way you have treated me I aught not to care for
you, but you no, hudie, for the sake of the child I
bound to care something [for you] about you. but listen here
my dear I do earnesly think you treats your chile cruel
when you are makin' so much money you say and won't event
send here one penny now [do you think] how do you think she
feal? I jus' couldn' treat my onlest chile that way a special a girl
an you know its so many things they kneeds. you sure ought
to be proud and feal great to think that you have a daughter in
the world grown and havent brought no shame and disgrace
upon us.you should think I am a wonderful mother to raise
such a girl in this fass town and such a little salary
as wemons make in this town. of course she could have been
more faymous if I had just had some one to [put her through]
[college] help furnish the money to put her through college
but as it is I thank God for her and that it is (as) well
with [us] both of us. I do hope I will meet you some day so that I
can explain to you* so now I am asking you this in the
name of Jesus Christ the Son of God out of the depths of my
heart. please send me $5.00 five dollars I need it so
bad. from Margaret"

trouble
