Dear Mr. Lomax:

    In reply to your letter of August 6th,
I have never heard the story which you men-
tion, but will be glad to make an investiga-
tion and let you hear from me as soon as
possible.

    Sadly, the Country is infested with
negro communists who seek to poison their own
people against their best friends, and I am
glad to have the opportunity to join in
establishing the facts, which I am sure will
disprove the story.

    With good wishes, I am,
    Yours very truly,
    Walter Chandler
    Mayor
