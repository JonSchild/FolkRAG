Mr. Theodore Christian Blegen,
Minnesota Historical Society,
University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Dear Mr. Blegen:
The Archive of American Folk Song plans
to make this summer a rapid recoding survey
of the folk music resources of Wisconsin,
Michigan and Minnesota. I am well acquainted
with your work in Norwegian immigrant folk
lore and feel sure that you would be of the
greatest assistance in the field of Minnesota
material.
The Archive is interested in building a
collection of records for the use of musicologists,
folk-lorists, composers and teachers and
naturally looks forward to collaboration with
the scholars in the region where its work is
being prosecuted. Some day we hope to be able
to supply the needs in terms of records to any
student of American folk song and to exchange
our collections with the great Archives of
Europe.
I look forward to my work this summer in
the Lake States and I will greatly appreciate
whatever concrete suggestions you could send
me in regard to the field of folk music in Minnesota.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
