Dear Harold,

1) Shannon Allen says we're 81 12" discs behind, says we should have been
supplying two to one. He also was to know what for about the
Anerc, School of the Air Recordings.
2) Joe Tate of U.S. Recording will bring into you on Monday a complete
estimate covering the items in the enclosed memo on Vinakovaroff's trip.
3) Joanna Colcord is ready to go with her exchange. It will mean
finding my original approved memo and approving it for [28] 38 discs to Shannon
Allen. I'd say this was a good idea since she presented us through
Gordon with all her unpublished ms.. She will give us 48 transcribed
Deccas and five Columbia sea shantey records in return for copies of the
19 Maitland sea shantey records which we gave.
4) Please[?] ask Miss Rogers to search for the memo on the Mitchell
matter covered in the city of the memo appended.I'm going to see him in
New York and get hm started.
5) I've written father that you're going to get his trip to him
soon. Don't forget to speak to MacLeish about it.
6) Has the loan of duplicates to father been approved. I have his
list of requests.
