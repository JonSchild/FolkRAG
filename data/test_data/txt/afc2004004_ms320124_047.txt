:  No.
ANCELET  You let it boil a little while and
it tastes very good.  And it's better than any of the
different ingredients.  And that's sort of what happened
here.  The Cajun culture I think is, is something that has
become different from just the some of the parts.  It's,
it's something, it's something new that happened only here
in Louisiana.  This was the only place in the world where
you had French culture blending with Spanish, German,
Scotch, Irish, Ango-American, black and Indian cultures,
all together.  This is the only place in the world where
that happened.  And this, so this is the only place in the
world where you have something that sounds like Cajun music.
The only place in the world where you have stories like the
Cajuns tell.  And. . .
:  And food.
ANCELET  And, and food the way it's cooked.

subtropical style with Spanish ingredients and German tools.
[LAUGHS] That's, it's, it's an amazing. . .like in the music
