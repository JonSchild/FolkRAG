are confused about the rubber situation. 
  Here in Indianapolis resides Col. A.A.W. Grist, world 
traveler and former political associate of Bonar Law and Lloyd 
George. Last night, at Col. Grist's invitation, the News 
Bureau representative of OWI and myself visited Col. Grist at 
his apartment. 
  He is representing the British Propaganda Ministry 
in this area. He has a weekly radio program and writes many 
letters to editors citing the British side of the conflict. 
Col. Grist would like to arrange a program in cooperation 
with OWI whereby we would take up the rumors we hear each week 
and he would refute them. 
  Col. Grist lives in a luxurious apartment, with servants, 
and apparently has unlimited resources. He is a highly 
intelligent, aggressive man of about 60. 

RUMORS 
  "Did you hear about the excitement out at the Fort 
(Benjamin Harrison)? They found a bunch of dynamite under 
one of the buildings there. I got it straight from a neighbor 
boy who works at the Fort. All of the employes are scared to 
death." Indianapolis, August 3.
