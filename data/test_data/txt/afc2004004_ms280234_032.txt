digs, you see, boarding houses and one place to another. And I
wasn't to comfortable because I wan't happy, and well, I always kept
myself up to the best, you know, strict like, strict rules, you see.

Lomax: What do you mean by that ?

Barry: Well, I'll tell you. I never go to the pictures much - out at
night very much. And I always keep indoors, see. I never go out very
much. That's one thing in life. I never bother with pictures or
even dance halls or anything like that. In my whole career I never
went to a dance hall or the pictures. I don't care about pictures, anyway, and
I don't care about dance halls either. But I'll tell you what I would
like. I'd like a room to myself, you know, and had some sort of music
on, like, I think I could do well with one or two people looking at me,
you know. But I'd go into a dance halll and start dancing around, you
know, amongst people, I don't care about 'em much; and at night time I
always had a notion that thenight time was worse for any woman to be out
after dark - too late of hour, you know, I'm very strict like that. Even
though very little had been taught me by my father - he wasn't a great
man. Do you see, he got married again. Had his second wife, and some way
and another he wasn't very interested in me; and I had to go by my
mother's rules, although she was dead, you know. Still andfor all, I
just remembered her words from day to day. Up till -- up till the time
she died at thirty two. and I was twelve years. And I mind every
word she said, as good as the first day. She alwasy told me, " Always
keep yurself indoors at night. Don't be out late at night. Supposing
I'm going to die." You know, I'm thinking of that now, you know. And
It's a very hard world, you know. And it's only now it's all coming
back to me. Dying, you know. I never thought of it at the taime because
I was only young. Yet it's only now that all these memories are coming
back to me. She said, "If I die, or anything happens to me, always keep
indoors at night; don't be out late at night. Don't be following no
pictures. You can certainly entertain yourself, and if you 3ant to go,
go to an early picture or something like that, but do not be out at late
hours. Because any girl or woman that's out after late hours is not
good - and she's never going to be good." ...Well, I kept going on them
from the towns, andindeed, several fellows I met, you know, like strong
men. People like - there's a fellow there they call Tom Burns, you know.
In fact, I heard a fried talking about him not so very long ago. Whether
it was the same man or not...But she said it was the same man. Well, he's
tall, you know, dark-haired, well, he was off and on talking to me.
you know, but someway and another I wasn't interested in him, and I
always liked him if he was a musical man, you know. I love a musical
person. But this is it, you see. I never gave myself time to think.
. I wasn't worried. All I wanted was to get inside, inside doors, and
to get a home over my head. That's all. But as for loving and liking
this person - I like him, certainly, but real love, I'm sure I couldn't
do so. It would be untruthful if I said that I did. But I do like him
a great deal, you know. But I dont really love him.

Lomax: How did you meet him ?
