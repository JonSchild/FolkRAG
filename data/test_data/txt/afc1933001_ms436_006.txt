to time he would pick up a couple of dollars doing this kind of thing.
Anyhow, we got into Helena, Arkansas, across the river from 
Mississippi.  I began playing pool and I beat some of the supposed[ly]
to--be sharks around there.  So this town was full of stool pigeons and 
one of them marked chalk on my back.  That was to designate to the policemen 
that I was a stranger in town and a shark.  My suit was getting 
kinda greasy then because  I couldn't haveit pressed and I guess it really 
had a bad odor, so pretty soon a policeman tapped me on the shoulder.
"Where did you come from"?
I wasn't so afraid of policement because I had seen quite a few of 
them on my rounds and I knew that policemens were just another kind of man,
in a sense.  But, of course, I always knew I had to respect superiority 
and I respected him very much.  If I hadn't, I knew it could be very very 
bad for me, because I had learned it doesn't take much to have them shooting 
you down.  I told him I had just come across the river from Clarksdale,
which didn't mean a thing to him.
So, he said to me." I want you shuck sharks and crooks to get 
out of this town and stay out."  Not very polite, was he".
But I was polite.  I said," I'm very sorry, but I'm a musician."
"A musician,  " he said, " Doesn't mean a thing around here.  We put more 
of them in jail than anybody else because they won't work."
I said, " Did you say ' leave town?'
" You heard me".
" Well," I said, " That will be my next move, because I don't intend 
to do anything but play music."
Anyhow, we managed to get on some [?] river boat, maybe [?] it was
the Natchez, I don't know, and we made it to Memphis.
