BJ: You knew he would. Supposed to be a man, be upright. You
know, jus' take an' cut -- He say He cut it off -- [the] between
the man -- between the snake an' the woman. That's what I [mean] meant

BJ: Um-hum. It's a devil of a thing, I'm tellin' ya. Ah, dirty,
nasty! I have nothin' to do with a snake but kill 'im. They
say ya must bruise 'is head. If ya don't, he'll bruise ya heel..
TL: What...?
BJ: Said, bruise a serpent's head 'cause without, that is, if
ya don't, the serpent'll bruise your heel. So he made to bite
cha, an' you made to kill 'im.
TL: Oh, yeah?
BJ: Tha's right. It said, bruise the serpent's head; if you
don't, the serpent will bruise your heel.
ALL: And what will happen then?
BJ: You got snake bit! Ha, ha, ha! Ain't no tellin' what will
happen, is it? Ha, ha, ha, ha!
AL: You kill every snake you see, don't you?
BJ: Yeah, if I can. If I don't, I kill him one way or the
other. Kill 'im runnin' or kill 'im -- git 'im with somethin'.
AL: Does that mean poison snakes or...?
BJ: Any kind. I don't, I don't know. All poison to me, long
