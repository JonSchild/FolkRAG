would forward me as soon as possible on such subjects as terms used in the language of the Cowboys, on songs of any kind that could be used to discuss in the class.

                                                                                       Very respectfully,
                                                                                         Elizabeth B. Costello


P.S. If you could forward any unprinted material on these subjects, I would be very grateful to you.
