[Kalamazoo Teachers Luceum]

Mr. Harvey J. Bouck
Central High School
Kalamazoo, Mich.

Dear Mr. Bouck:

I am informed that the cost of a
round trip to Kalamazooo, including
Pullman berths, is $54.92.  Therefore
the total fee plus travel would be
$204.92.

As far as my present plans go, any
Tuesday in January would be satisfactory
to me.  Please let me know which date
you select.

I am sending you some publicity
material under separate cover.  The
equipment necessary for the lecture on
"Documentary Recording" consists of a
16-inch turntable able to play at 33
revolutions per minute, with amplifier
and speakers.  The whole success of the
talk will be dependent on the distinctness
with which the illustrative
recordings are heard by the audience --
and this is up to you.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
