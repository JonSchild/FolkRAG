Rumor reported from Chicago (August 4, 1942)

"I have heard too many stories about government printing. The story is: The Government got all excited about lack of sugar, so they printed great stacks of rationing cards, etc. The bill was the greatest they ever had in printing, so rather than store all the printing they had, they were afraid of what people like McCormick (Tribune) might make of it, so they went ahead with the rationing even though it was not necessary. (This story is supposed to be ripe around here).   (75)
