Dear Mr. Engel:
          Still no pens we have fought zero weather and four feet of snow to
get this for on our way. I don't wish to come back now except for important reasons.  Will you consider and reply to me General Delivery, Detroit Mich.
1.  Whether you will permit Mr. Garwick to ship the machine to Texas, so that Alan and I may again begin recording as soon as possible after December 1?
2. Will you write me fully what I can do to forward the matter of getting some financial aid through Mr. Leland or elsewhere. I had planned to first ask your advice and then to see Mr. Leland in person in case you thought the plan
