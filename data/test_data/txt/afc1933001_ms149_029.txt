Gentlemen:
I have written you previously requesting
a notarized bill of sale for the car which I
purchased from you on June 6, 1939. It was a new
1939 Ford standard coupe, motor # 4966735. The
invoice was N.C. #310.
I am being considerably inconvenienced
by not having this notarized bill of sale and will
appreciate hearing from you within the near future.
Very truly yours,
Alan Lomax
