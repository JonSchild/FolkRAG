Adventures-Sheldon 2

to the distance. In the late afternoon groans were heard, and the miserable faces of
old maid school teachers-sore, shaken-faces-begrimed with dust which they were too
tired to wipe away- made a picture of absolute wretchedness that transcended all space.
"Look on us a time," they seemed to say," and space shall be no more." Two fainted and
fell from their patient mules the day we went down, and [they] were carreid to the top on
stretchers.

The August sun did not prevent Cason and me from skipping down the first two or
three miles like a couple of young boys out for a morning lark. Then gradually came the
heat and the pull of muscles doing an unaccustomed task with wearying repetition. Down,
