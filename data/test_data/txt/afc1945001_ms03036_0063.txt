Instructions on Study of War Rumors

[*271*]

We are making a study of rumors related in any to the war
effort. We want to know:--

1. What rumors people are telling.
2. Which rumors are being told most often.

We plan to study the rumors current during the period from
August 3 until noon, August 8. To help us in learning the part that
rumors play in war information, will you please give us a word for
word report of each rumor each time you hear it. This will mean that 
you will write out some rumors several times in exactly the same way,
or maybe the story will be told a little bit differently each time. It
doesn't matter whether the rumor is told to you or you hear it being
told to someone else--write it out just as you hear it.

Next to each rumor that you write out, put down the city in
which you heard it and the date. Keep all of your rumor reports till
the collection is complete Saturday noon, August 8th, at which time
they should be mailed to

Special Service Division
Bureau of Intelligence, Office of War Information
Room 300, Library of Congress Annex
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sirs, 
although constantly 'keeping 
my ears open' for rumors I heard
none during the 2 weeks covered
by the study.

Very truly yours,
Raymond E. Brooks
