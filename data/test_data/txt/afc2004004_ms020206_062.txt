Reverend Roe.  Reel 5.  P.  1
If you want a beautiful bouquet, we must get flowers of all colors and
bring them together and it makes the bouquet beautiful. And then,
[*Humanity a beautiful bouquet*]
too, if you wish the [bouquet] flowers to be more lovely, they must be well cared
for. The better you treat them, the more lovelier they will become,
and that's also true with the nations that must live here in this world together. Every one
a beautiful Godly nation. We must treat them good and they must treat
us good. And if we treat each other well, we'll all love one another,
and then we'll make a better world for us all to live in.
A: Let's record that over again, Reverend because of all these noises
that interrupt the record. Let's begin with the blue flower.; start
with the Lord put blue flowers and white flowers.
[*The flowers*}
R: As I look out on the field I see where the Lord have created
flowers of all colors, some blue, some white, some red, and all different
colors, and by so doing He have made the prairies more
beautfful. And [then] if we wish to have a beautiful bouquet we can't
gather all white flowers, all red, all blue, but we'll gather flowers
[of] all different colors and [we'll] blend them together, and we have
then a very beautiful bouquet. And the loveliness and beauty of that
flower is helped by good treatment. The better we treat the plant,
the more beautiful [will] be the flower. And if all nations, races
would treat each other right, give justice to all alike, all nations
would grow more beautiful and more lovely, and we'd have a much
better world in which to live.
A: Reverend, you're not purely Negro in your own origin. [The] Your family
has some mixture in it doesn't it?
[*I should have been born white*]
R: But I'll tell you this -- want me to tell you? Now, the one
thing that I hate, had I had justice or, if my foreparents had of been
honest, I would have been born white. The seed is from the man, and
my grandfather was a white man. He'd taken my grandmother after his white
wife [had] died. She was his slave. He'd taken her in his home, and
