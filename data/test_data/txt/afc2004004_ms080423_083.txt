Nellie (Woman) we couldn't get no money. When I was very small, my daddy 
went to Pennslvan.When he come in--he stayed two years--I couldn't 
really know him when he come back.   But I'd never seen him with a 
suit and a necktie on, and when he come back in, I didn't know him. 
Me and my baby brother, we neither one knowed him, we was way up in 
the mountains and playing.  And a road come thru, you know a little 
path thru the woods where you had to come, and he come, that way, 
and neither one of us knowed him.   Got with us where we was playing 
up there in the edge of the woods.   He had a sister living [a] in 
Pennsylvania.   He went there and got a job making bathtubs.   And he 
stayed there for maybe 3 or 4 years, when we was just little, I didn't 
even know him when he come back.   He had a lot of money, they payed 
pretty good up there, you know, when he come back.   My mother, she 
plowed, (unint) make everything, . . .but he was gone.   (soft, unint.) 
. . . . .My mother, she had to plow, to make what we had when daddy's 
gone to make money for somethin' else. Times was a lot different 
back when I was growin' up [ba] to what they are now., lot different.

Man:    I believe we'll sing a song my brother used to sing: 
"Went down to the river and. . . ."
