Dear Alan:  Your letter enclosing a 
check struck me in the midriff
this morning and quite 
bowled me over. To this circumstance 
you must attribute
any lapses in this letter. 

We'll be [likely] ready to 
travel on to San Antonio [t]
with you after your appearance
at Fisk, April 29, though
that gives you little time for 
pleasure before you come before 
the Folk-Lore Society on the 
evening of May 2. But I think
we'll make it even if we 
have to run along ahead of
you and have the gates open 
(I haven't yet seen Dobie's program)
But don't you worry. Whatever
