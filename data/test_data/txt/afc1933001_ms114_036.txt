start choral groups, art classes, photography work,
dramatics etc., etc., within one of the big UAW regions
and sponsored by that region. The amount and,
probably, the quality of our singing as a distinctive
group would probably go down. That may, however, be the
thing for us to do; we can do it, and we can, I think,
do it on a higher and more consistent level than it's
been done previously in the labor movement.

On the other hand, Butch, who is developing
into a very nice Jimmie Rogers style singer[s], wants
to go on singing primarily and writing Almanac songs.
He's in favor of a tour, and points out that Arthur
and Charlie, who are at the moment rather bemused by
UAW politics, will probably get themselves appointed
cultural directors inside of a year or so and that will
be the end of the Almanac Singers, as singers.

Actually, with the war on, I see little chance
of any extensive tour plans developing. And in the mean
time we have to keep on keeping alive. This we do by
making bookings, and so far as I can tell [will] we will
keep on doing so until we have enough money
to do something else. We are strapped into living expensively--
hotel, etc.-- by having no money, peculiarly
enough. We haven't got the initial investment required
to set up an office or any kind of living quarters.
So I imagine we will keep on as we are
until we make enough money to be able to stop and ask
ourselves what we ought to do now. Funny, isn't it?

I wish I could see you and talk some things
over with you and hear about your trip. Please write
as often as you can. Butch, the old New England farm
stock, [wan] has gone nuts over the beautiful lush farming
land around here, and wants us to set up a farm,
for [a] the winter. Why don't you come and write your
novel here with us and live on a beautiful Michigan
farm? We will be your best friends and critics. Much
love to you, and please send whatever records you have
no matter what they are. We'll remit [when you send]
whatever they cost.
