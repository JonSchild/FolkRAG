Mr. Tom Benton
3616 Bellview Ave.
Kansas City, Missouri

Dear Mr. Benton: 

Hear'n tell that you and Father got together the other day
and talked about folk songs, and that you want to record for us.
We'd like to have anything you care to pick up or play. Do you
have a machine to do the work, or do you know somebody who will
do it for you? We might be able to furnish the acetate if the
thing looks good.

Better come in to see me, and we'll talk the thing over here
if you are ever down this alley. 

Father told me about your affection for Doc Boggs. He has 
long been my favorite on commercial records, but you ought to
listen, if you haven't, to some of the Mainer Mountaineer stuff
on Bluebird, recent. Enclosed is a list of such records of songs
which you may not know. I would like to hear from you very much.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
