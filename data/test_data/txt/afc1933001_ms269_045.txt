policy that affect our ability to answer questions. By proper documentation [by by] of the machinery of the Library all of the fascination in the operation of the building could be exemplified. The Library itself is a monument to democracy and the program could, I think, be the most interesting quiz program on the air.

i) We must, of course, do a number of programs for Latin American consumption and for inter-American consumption. Mr. Weisner has subsisted the possibility of the great short-wave stations in Boston and Schenectady taking transcribed programs [for] from the Library, particularly if these have Spanish scripts. It seems to me that with the number of persons in the Library who handle Spanish and Portuguese [and] added to the embassy staffs from the various Latin American countries we should be able to supply this need easily.

The simplest and perhaps the most direct type of program for this need would be a sort of travelogue or investigatalogue of America, American institutions, American life, American factories and American personsages with Spanish and Portuguese commentators. I watched a French commentator handle comments in and over the sound of the things he was describing---an Indian dance, a steel mill in operation, a Federal Theatre play , a lumberjack song. If this could be done with people from the several counties, well-known persons, commenting on, say , a Negro church service, a session in Congress, etc., for the benefit of the home-folks the same effect would be got. Naturally the same thing could be accomplished by sending [out] our sound recorder to South America, except that in this case the material could be used for home consumption with an English commentator and  the transcriptions shipped to rural stations and with Spanish commentator for the South American countries.

j) Another program of the same kind must be based on what recordings we can get of Latin American music, both folk and popular, comparing them along the way with similar materials from the United States and Canada. "Music of the Two Americas." This program could be built entirely of dubbings from records with suitable comments.

k) I think the design of the progams for Latin America might well be comparative in great part. Certain basic problems are similar: the conquering of wild country, the struggle to free ourselves from a colonial position, the experience of frontiersmen, the influence of African culture elements, the parallel struggle for democracy. I feel that a program on the democratic heroes of of the two Americas with the obvious connections between Bolivar and Washington, Juarez and Lincoln would [be] have splendid results.

l) One of the problems of a democracy at war is how to [activate and] conquer the suspicions of minority groups. My conversations with Negros through the past few
