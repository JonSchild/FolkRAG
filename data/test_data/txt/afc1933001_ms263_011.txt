9. Texas Negro Folk Religion, 1941 Approved Actual

John Faulk, at the recommendation of Charles Johnson, was
given a recording machine and a Rosenwald Fellowship this year
to make a study of the religious practices of the Negro people
and particularly to record the sermons and prayers which form
so noble a part of our folk literature. The Library is making
copies of the discs furnished by the Rosenwald Foundation and furnishing him additional disks and needles.

10. Northern Georgia, the Asheville Folk Festival, and the
Galax Folk Festival

The Archive this summer embarked in a new direction
to document the folkways of a community as well as the
folk music, in order to create radio programs out of this
material. With this in mind a collaborative trip was
undertaken by the Archive and the Radio Project. The
Archive furnished the services of Mr. Weisner, Mr. Lomax,
the sound truck, and materials. The Radio Project
furnished the services of Mr. Liss and the studio costs
in creating the documentary radio programs to result.
The work was centered in northern Georgia, documenting
the effect of TVA on an isolated mountain area and extending
this documentation into the Tennessee Valley.
Important experimental results were achieved.

Besides this two of America's most significant folk
events were completely recorded, namely the Asheville
Folk Festival occurring in Asheville, North Carolina,
and the Galax Fiddlers' Contest occurring in Galax,
Virginia.

Melville Herskovits, the leading Africanist of
American anthropology, was sent by a Rockefeller grant

return for the deposit of this collection in the Library
of Congress.
