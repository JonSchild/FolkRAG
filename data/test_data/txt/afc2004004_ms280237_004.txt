1) Come all ye sailormen and listen to my plea,
When you've heard it you will pity me,
For I was a goldarn fool in the Port of London Pool,
On the first day me barge came home from sea.
I was paid off at Greenhythe from a voyage from North of Blyth
And four pounds ten a month it was my pay,
And as I jingled my tin, I was very soon taken in
By a pretty girl they called her Maggie May.

2) Well do I remember where I first met Maggie May, 
Cruising up and down Woolwich Place,
She wore a kerchief fine like a frigate on the line
And like a sailor I gave chase.
I caught her all aback, she shifted her main tack, 
But Maggie she had busted her mainstay,
And next morning when I woke, with me heart just sore & broke,
'Cause Maggie had skedaddled with my pay.

3) And that morning when I woke I was not only broke, 
No shirt, no pants, no weskit could I find,
I wrote for where they were, she replied, "My dear sir,
They are down in Ipswich pawnshop, number nine."
To the pawnshop we did go, but I could not find my clothes, 
So a copper came and took the girl away,
And the judge he guilty found her for the robbing of a homeward bounder,
And he paid her passage back to Butterman's Bay.

4) O Maggie Maggie May, they're taking you away,
To toil upon that demon-troubled shore,
'Cause you've robbed so many sailors, and you've done so many whalers,
But you'll never see the Riga any more. 

Lomax: That's a fairly recent song, isn't it?

Robts: Its's originally a Liverpool song, you see, and so
many Liverpool ships came here to discharge in 
Butterman's Bay. So they picked it up locally, and it
got banted round to getting a local name - Ipswich and 
Butterman's Bay where the sailing ships used to discharge 
you see, just down the river...but it's really an adaptation of 
an old Liverpool song.

Lomax: Nobody knows who the original Maggie May was, I guess.

Robts: They'll tell you that in Liverpool ! There were plenty 
of Maggie Mays in Woolwich !
