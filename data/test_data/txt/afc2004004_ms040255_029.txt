"the Old Horse." Two men made the horse which performed the action in the song. This of course was known as humming and was actually done outside our front door on the Xmas Eve of 1933. I sincerely hope it is still in being for it seems a pity that these good old British songs should die. 
Will this knowledge be of any use to you in some future programme. I hope so.
Yours faithfully (Mrs) Florence B. Rodger.
