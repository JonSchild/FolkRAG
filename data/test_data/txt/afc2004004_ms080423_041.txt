Man: Well, I think thhough that if you drill to dancing
any two people can do the same figure.  I don't call that
old timey dancing.  I call old timey dancing is whatever
body danced to the music, keep in time with the music,
do what they want to do.   I call this here dance team,
everybody doing the same step, just like drilling an army
you can take a bunch out and drill 'em and I don't think
it's old timey dancing myself.   I mean, you know, everybody's
got their own opinion about that.

I:   That's what you call precision dancing.

Man and woman:   Yup.

I:   There's a lot a that around now.

Woman:  There sure is.       Man:  That's about all there is anymore.
Nobody does . . . .     It's all but take over. . . .
The old timey footdancing.

I:   I like that where they throw the skirts around myself.   (Car noise.)
Don't you think so?   (Laughter)   Where they kick up their legs and 
everybody's watching that.

Man:   It's really easier to do, and whenever we start out to dance and
Carol is calling out the square dance we don't know what he's going to
call.   When they do that precision dancing you know about, everybody
does the same step before you know what you're going to do.
(car noise)  Whenever you doing that precision dancing and you go
through a drill where everybody knows what you're going to do all
the time, the footwork everybody's doing the same thing.  Where our caller takes
us out to dance.   If we're dancing, he don't tell us what he's going 
to call.  He's liable to call anything.  You've got to listen, and
pay attention and to not make no mistakes, nobody's going to call to
give the figure.

I:   Now let me ask you an intimate question.   When I was
square dancing in my younger days the thing I liked was that I'd
get to dance with all the different women in the circle and get
to hug every one of them, you know, when I was sort of adventuring
around.   Does that enter in at all to the thing?

Woman:   It does to him, I know.   (Laughter, protests.)  He's the
biggest flirt we have on the team.

Man:   (Daub?) usually dancing with the same woman every night.

Woman:   That doesn't mean anything.

I:   But you get to go around. . . .

Man:   Oh, yeah. . .a little bit.   I like to go to these dances like you
have at Maggie Valley and places where everybody gets out there and
dances, and you call and swing, with your partner behind you, all
