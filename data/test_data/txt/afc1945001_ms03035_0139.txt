RUMORS IN DETROIT, MICHIGAN

Reported by Bert M. Grim
Beautician, 308 W. Grand Blvd., Detroi
While having dinner in the dining-room of the
Book-Cadillac Hotel Tuesday, October 6, at 8 p.m.
Three men at an adjoining table were discussing 
our Selective Service Draft Act - one claimed
that there were a large number of men classed 1-A
not on essential war jobs who by paying large sums
to personnel managers were given deferred classifications, 
claiming that said fixed money was
split thru an organized setup in Chicago who had 
some control with government officials. These
granted deferments were not guaranteed for any 
long period of time, but nevertheless it was a 
situation that he had contacted. The large proportion 
of those involved seem to be of the Jewish race
or other foreign nationalities.

This man seemed to be a business man with some contact
in war production plants. His conversation 
stressed on the contacts that they now had and the 
slowness of the government personnel men in O.K.'ing
priorities that they could get out their production.
