Fisk, 1. 2.
You be so pleased to give me water around, I pray The. Please guide
the home, I pray for J sus' sake. Now, my Father, the victories are
barely achieved in Your Name. Your fair is over. Would Thou be so
pleased as to let me see somewhere in Thine hour. Accept us as Thine.
My Father, You taught Your Disciples topray, to say:
Our Father, Who artin Heaven,
hallowed by Thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come.
As Thy Will be done
In Earth as It is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our debtors
As we forgive our debtors.
Lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.
Thine is the Kingdom, Power and Glroy forever.
Amen.
