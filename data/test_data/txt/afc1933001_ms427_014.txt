ONWARD BROTHERS                                                       -9-

Onward Brothes, march still onward,
Side by side to carry on.
Though the night be dark and hopeless,
We are coming toward the Dawn.
Women, children, slave about us,
Hard the toil and grim the strife,
But our souls still sing within us,
Dreaming of a better life.

Olden sages saw it dimly
And their joy to rapture wrought
Living men have gazed upon it,
Standing on the hills of thought.
All the past has done and suffered,
All the daring and the strife,
All has helped to mould the future,
Make man master of his life.

Still strong deeds and brave arene eded,
Still the toil for freedom's cause,
let us all join in together, 
Fight against the master's laws.
Let us strive for lvoe and justice,
Brotherhood - true Freedom's sun.
Let us never yield or falter
Till the victory is won.

SWEET AND LOW
(England)
(Page 129 - Old Favorite Songs)

Sweet and low, sweet and low, wind of the western sea,
Low, low, breathe and blow, wind of the western sea.
Over the rolling waters, go,
Come from the dying moon and blow,
Blow him again to me, while my little one,
While my pretty one sleeps.
