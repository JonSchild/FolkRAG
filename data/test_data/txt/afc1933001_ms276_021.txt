and with the bawdiest and most scandalous songs imaginable.

a) Here one of the bands call on their protecting deity, Papa Loco, god of the 
Winds, to guide them through the night trails.

b) The singing leader of one of the Rara bands announces to all the world that
one Adelice, a young lady of his acquaintance, has been behaving scandalously,
in fact, that she shows physical evidence of her sins.

c) Prettied up considerably, this song says, "It's gone wild, it's gone wild,
so much woman about, the road is caving in."

B. Bahaman Folk Music

Haitian music can be described, roughly, as West African music, much
influenced by French Culture. Bahaman Negro folk music, however, is the
result of an almost complete obliteration of West African traits. Melodically
it is close to England. It's harmony is an adaptation of the quartet techniques
developed by Southern Negroes. Certain fundamental African patterns
remain, however: the close association of all music with dancing or work
rhythms, and the repetition of short melodies with many "breaks" or "riffs."

1) A jumping dance song. Jumping dances are held on the beach on moonlight
nights. The girls sing. A boy handles the one goatskin drum. The dancers
form a circle and clap while one after another they "shine" around the circle.
The text of the song has to do with one of the great hurricanes which periodically
sweep the islands. On this occasion the storm beached "The China" and
"The Setting Star" on main street.

The wind blow East, the wind blow West,
The wind blow the "Setting Star" right down in town.
The wind blow East, the wind blow West,
The wind blow the Chine right down in town,
The wind blow the Chine right down in town,
etc...
2) Bimini Gals, played with guitar and mandolin accompaniment by a Nassau
street band, celebrates the obduracy of the ladies on the beautiful island of
Bimini.

Bim'ni gals is a rock in the harbor,
Neber get a lickin' 'till you go down to Bim'ni,
Oh-------------, when you go down to Bim'ni,
Never get a lickin' 'till you go down to Bim'ni.

3) The natives of the Bahamas are reputed to be among the best small boat
sailors in the world. They sail through their own reef-filled waters at night
whereexperienced white pilots are afraid to sail by day, guided only by feel
and guesswork, and they are seldom wrecked. They set out on journeys of
hundreds of miles across the open sea in little cockle-shells of boats with
patched sails and nothing but a little dired beef, a jug of water and an inbred
understanding of the sea to bring them through.

Along with their inheritance of good sailoring from England, they have
received a stock of shanty melodies. But, as is always the case with Negro
sinners, they have not been content to imitate. They have made their chanties
their own.
