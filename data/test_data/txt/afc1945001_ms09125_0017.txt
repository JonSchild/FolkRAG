  I
One of men send a letter back saying
while we was over here conplaining
about buying food. He said if you 
were over there in Russia are Europe 
you would glad to even get a piece
of bread the people over there are
dying from the won't of food.
  II
Another said we are taking this war
as a joke. But really serious and the
quicker we relize it the better we 
will be.
 III
Someone on the streetcar said the
other day that the United States 
tells all the japs they have killed 
but they won't tell how many 
on our side has been killed.
 IV.
There will always be someone to take 
Hilter place so killing Hilter won't 
stop the war. Nothing will stop it but
until they learn that the U.S. are 
not afraid and we will fight.
