John A. Lomax, Esq.
Wilton, Conn.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
Our Mail Division advises me that the recording machine and batteries
were sent to you prepaid and that the express people ought not to
have asked you to pay any charges on delivery. A duplicate bill of lading
is being sent to the express company's Washington office, on receipt
of which the Wilton agent will be directed to reimburse you.
I am looking into the question of the thirty records for which you
ask a refund and shall let you know about this in a day or two.
What can you tell me about Bascom Lazar Lunsford, who called on me
last week to tell me about the ballads he has just recorded at Columbia
University? Mr. Garwick, who has just written to me in this connection,
calls these Lunsford records "the most important and most complete collection
made up to this time." There are, as I understand it, nearly one
hundred double-faced records. There would seem to be nothing to prevent
our copying them for the Library if we can find some way of meeting the
expense. I believe, too, that Mr. Lunsford might be willing to record
some addition ballads for us if he were approached in the right way.
His address is Leicester, North Carolina.
I enclose a copy of a letter to Mrs. Flanders.
Faithfully yours,
Chief, Division of Music
