Match Box Blues *

"Now this here's a song I compose about de P.G.. ** It done
been here an' got her an' gone.

P.G.'s got my babe an' gone,
O de P.G.'s got my gal an' gone,
O de P.G. got my gal an' gone.

Lef' me here jes' to sing dis song,
Lef' me here, podner, to sing dis song,
'O de P.G. has got my gal an' gone.' "

In such a way lead Belly once introduced the song that is to
follow, explaining to us the origin of the tune. The stanzas
that he has woven together to create this semi-ballad,
this blues narrative, come from various blues.
"Settin' down here wonderin' would a match-box hol' my
clo's?
Don' want to be bothered with no suitcase on my road,"
is a well-known, widely sung stanza [of various blues.] The
other[s in the] stanzas , in the same way come from other blues;
but L.B. [*Lead Belly*] has given these random lines, all of which
tell part of a story briefly, enigmatically,
and with naked realism, a new [direction and meaning]
meaning and significance. The [ballad] semi-ballad that results
has all the impersonality and generality that anyone could
wish. It is a type story.

This blues Lead Belly plays with a knife on a six string guitar.
The same guitar technique is used as in "Blind Lemon", but
the guitar is tuned in "vasapool", vestibule.

** The Junior Editor says "P.G." is probably some kind
of soap. He, however, adds that "P.G." is one thing
he does not know about Negro folk songs.
