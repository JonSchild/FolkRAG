A very prominent citizen said there is a very definite group of people in this country and in this area who are Pacifists and who are constantly criticizing the conduct of the war, and a great many people without any technical knowledge or without facts are constantly criticizing the different military missions and deploring the fact that we are in the war. This group is much larger than is suspected and they are quite vocal in their views and criticisms.     [*24 Denver, Colo    8-7*]
