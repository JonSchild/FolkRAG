GARY:
He said, I don't see no sense of a nigger smoking
cigarettes. Sit down there on that stump and play me a piece.
I told him, I'd be damned if I will. Thats what I told
him. Thats right. Talkin about a Negro can't smoke a cigarette.

LARRY:
Right.

GARY:
You understand? You asked me for one of my cigarettes. I
said I asked you for a cigarette, I ask you again, Give me a 
cigarette. That the way you hear about colored people I said
you can go to hell, and I wouldn't play you a damn tune if you
in hand over head, that's what I told him. 

LARRY:
If he was hanging over hell?

GARY:
That's what I told him. Walked on out of there. Then
what made me mad too again, I was already mad, Set down on 
the rock there and I said I've been sitting up on white folks
porches, inside their house playing guitar, I told him. He sitting
up there and saying sit down on that rock down there and play 
your guitar.

LARRY:
I'll be damned.

GARY:
Thats right. All that happened.
