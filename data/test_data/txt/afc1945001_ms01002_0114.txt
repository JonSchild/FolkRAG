PROCEDURAL SUGGESTIONS

The following are suggestions for a cooperatively executed 
investigation of rumors on the subject of gas and rubber rationing. 
These procedural suggestions are equally applicable to a study of 
any other type of rumor, and it is suggested that one or two additional 
types should be included in the preliminary study. This will 
provide a framework of comparison for developing the relationship 
between informational deficiencies and rumor.

A. A Funnelling to the Bureau of Intelligence of orally transmitted 
rumors.

Rumors can be gathered through the following mechanisms:

a. Division of Surveys Interviewers

Due to the relatively "free" character of the 
interview, rumors in the center of the focus of 
attention of the interviewees are likely to emerge. 
Interviewers will be instructed to probe further 
according to specified standards.

A form will be provided interviewers for the reporting 
of each rumor according to the classification 
categories suggested under Part 2, Detection 
and Analysis of Rumors (What? Who? Where?)

b. OWI Field Staff (formerly OGR - OEM)

Members of the field staff will be instructed to 
report rumors on the subject and to classify them 
according to the standards set forth above.

c. Special Services Division Correspondence Panelees

 Rumors will be elicited from them in the same 
fashion as from the OWI Field Staff (b)

d. OPA Field Staff

In addition to the fact that this group is active 
in urban areas (a desirable offset to Likert's predominantly 
rural coverage) they would be dealing 
with a subject that is their professional concern.
