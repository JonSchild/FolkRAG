Any mothah don't keep up wid huh chile, you understan, from one
mont to the othah, you understan, she's a lazy mothah.  She knows
everything that chile's sposed to wear an every piece that chile's
sposed to use.  Everything.  Even knows hern from her own chile's.
Yo u see?  An if that don't be seen when that time come fur it to
be seen, she don't have to ast that chile nothin.  You see?
     (Would she get mad?)
     Well, she shouldn't jes git mad.  Still she shouldn't 
be in sich a good humor.  But she should be interested to find out
what's up.  She should go to that chile an try to find out, in a 
quiet way.  See if she couldn't git it out of huh.
      (Would she ask, "wh ere have you been, have you been
fooling around with boys?")
     Well, she should ask it.  She should ask huh --
certain things she is supposed to show, you understand.  An make huh
bring em to huh.  An each time make huh show em to huh.  An tell huh
how long an what an everythang.  Your chile couldn't fool you.
Cause soon as she brought it, you could look on it and know it
wadn't none of huhs.  If it was one of yours, you could tell it,
an if it was one of  huh you could tell it.  She couldn't fool you.
I knowed a gull tried to fool huh mothah like that one time.
     (What did she do to try to fool her?)
     Huh huh.  You know what she done.  I went fur enough to 
tell you.  You know what I'm talking about.  You know what
happen to a woman at the end of every mont, don't you?
     (You mean some mothers ask their daughters to --)
     Show em that.  Thass thass thass the proper thang!
Long as they show that, understan, you know they ain't nothin
there.
      (You knew this girl who tried to fool her mother?)
