Mr. Alan Lomax
Washington, D.C.

My Dear Sir:
After a long delay, I am
acknowledging receipt of the fine
record you sent me.

From the reading of your letter I
inferred that you had sent me some
special needles. The envelope was
torn and there was nothing in it but
the letter so I lost the needles also the
address, where I could get them- I
have been waiting for needles, so that
I might tell you about my record, but
haven't heard it play yet. I will just
assume that it does fine, and tender
my thanks to you and the good wife
for sending the record, which I was
sure would come in due time-
So hoping you are both well and happy,
I am

Very truly yours,
J.M. Gevedon.
