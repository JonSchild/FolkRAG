(Do you feel that that is a pleasing sort of arrangement?)
WELL! It's pleasin fur me to give you my money. It should be.
(What do you mean, give me your money?)
Jes lak I be givin you my money. Lak you my wife or sumpin. I don't ask Can I of nothin I call myself mine. Somepin I'm doin fur. They don't have to let me do nothin. I go ahea an git what I want. She give up to me. Must be mine.
(What about the woman? How does she feel?)
WELL. . . It's the same way. I don't take no mo than what I low them to have.
(Do you feel that sex is a fair exchange for money?)
Money is not anything 'sential to love. Cause you take a woman that loves a man, she loves him if he ain't got a dime. If he ain't got a pair of pants that can covah up his nakedness, if she love him, she love him. You take a man that's got all kinds of money. I don't care if he's John D. Rockefeller. If a woman don't love him, he's jes trhwin his time away. She don't want him nor his money neither one.
(You believe that, yet what about the woman you give yo ur money to? You feel that you can make love to her whatever she says. . .)
They ain't got any business sayin anythang. They done give theirselves up to me to take care of. What they gonna say? That's MINE.
(What if they don't like it when you make love?)
WELL! Don't like it? That don't hep me from likin it, do it?
