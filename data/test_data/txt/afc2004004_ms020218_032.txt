gi' it to them an' we'd order clo's or sumpin' like that.  Ha,
ha.  An' do[in'] it that way, you see?  An' I liked it that way
'cause he was respectable, he wanted, he said, "You respect
yourself; I will help to respect ya."  A course, a lot of men
don't do it.  A lot of men, they see you try to respect yourself,
they ain' gonna do it.  They'll try to flatter you, an' throw
you flat.  I think that's a nasty person...It is a nasty person;
you shouldn't want to see somebody try to keep their chilruns disrespectful.
If I hadn't done it, now they wouldn't believe in me.
You see?  Not at all, see.  An now, they yet don' know anything
about my life.  Bu they knew this man would come there.  We'd
go in the car; we'd go to town; we'd go buy groceries, an' buy things by night.
But jus' say he come in there to give me orders.  An' I wan't
ordered nohow, y'know.  I ain' never had no brother, no father.  Ha! an' all
[Y'see I was all on 'count a no thing to no] them kinda them things - like a man -- like I b'long
to 'im; you'know sumpin' that; I don't.  Now if I did it be different.
Jus' like I have a husban'.  [I know] Y'see what I mean?  I know.
Ya see?  But I know when [ya] he ain't [got a] my husban', y'see?
An' so, some of 'em take that way; some of 'em married; some of
come to their house an' jus' rule like the devil.  I couldn't do it;
I would have a fit.  I said, "You can't boss two places, brother."
I says, "You on'y have in due time."  I says, "You couldn't do
it."  An' so, tha's ah, when you can't do a thing, stay outa a
things way.  See.  Tha's the way I feel.  If you can't do no
thing -- I heard [Mist'] men -- talkin' like that, "Well, what you
gonna do?  You gonna raise the chilrun or you gonna let them
raise you?!"  I said, "I'm gonna raise -- I'm gonna [raise] bring them
up."  Y'see? "Tha's just what I'm gonna do."  "Well, they
ain' gotta [what] do what you do; you grown."  I says, "I know."
Says, "Tha's what I wanna do what I wanna do, 'cause I'm grown."
I don' wanna do what a chile will do.  See?  Nothin' like --
no chile -- it don' on'y mean my chile on'y -- no chile!
AL:  Bessie, at the time that you -- you went with Cassius
several months before your baby was born?
BJ:  Oh yeah.  Before the baby was born!
AL:  How long?
BJ:  I went with him several months before I ever got
('spanded ?).  An' then aft' that the baby was born.
