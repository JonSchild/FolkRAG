Return to E Katz
July 8, 1942
Dear Mr. Knapp: 
Mr. MacLeish has referred your letter of July 1 and your memorandum on Jews and the draft to me. We have forwarded your letter and your memorandum to General Lewis B. Hershey, Director of the Selective Service System. 
I regret that we have no accurate figures on the participation of Jews in the military services, and I think it unlikely that accurate figures are available. However, I quite agree with you that this is a very dangerous rumor. It has been suggested that an intensive study of a particular community might go far to refute such rumors and that a logical place to institute such a study would be in an area where these rumors are intense. One method would be for a Jewish research organization to put up the money for a complete check list of Jews in a particular city and then have Selective Service or some other official agency check this list against the local draft board records. Such a study would be extremely difficult and would probably take some time. However, if the situation is as serious as you say, it might bewell worthwhile. 
I think that you may expect to hear from General Hershey, and perhaps he will have some ideas on the subject. We deeply appreciate your interest and cooperation in this connection and wish to thank you for bringing the matter to our attention. 
Sincerely yours, 
R. Keith Kane
