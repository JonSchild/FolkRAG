DIVISION OF MUSIC
July 16, 1940

To Mr. Lomax:

We take pleasure in announcing the appointment of
Dr. Leonard Webster Ellinwood to the staff of the Music
Division, effective July 16, 1940. Dr. Ellinwood will
direct and coordinate all of the processing activities
which the Division undertakes. After a general survey
of the situation he will be in a position to make any
necessary recommendations which may improve the service
and benefit the persons engaged in processing duties.
I am sure that every member of the staff will give Dr.
Ellinwood full cooperation in line with this important
work.
