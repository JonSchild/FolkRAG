BJ TAPE 6, p. 31

         But, anyhow, this was the toast that I had:
AL:    What, what...?
BJ:     Toas', we say a toases; say a natchul toases, say it like
it should be.   But jus' say, "A toast to you," an' all like that, that's 
nothin'; you ain't a-toasin' unless you say it.  If just [say] said
that, tha's all.   But, but you yet ain't said the toast.   But
um, I um, this toast I made [it] up myself was um, um...:
               "Once I loved the life of a millinary (millionaire),
                Spendin' my money jus' like I didn't care,
                Takin' all my friends out to have a good time,
                Buyin' 'em beer, champagne an' wine.
                An' when I begin to fall so low,
                I couldn't find a friend here, or there, or
                         nowhere I go.
                It seemed mighty strange, without a doubt,
                There's nobody knows ya when you're down an' out.
                I'm down; though I'm down now, but I long to rise,
                I wouldn't a-been down if I had a-been wise,
                But when I rise, I'll let the whole world know
                How ya treated po' Bessie when she was down so low.
                If anybody should ask you who composed this toast,
                You tell 'em, "Bessie Jones, that goes from coast to
                          coast."
I got that written down all about it.  They got it all up in the
                        , you know, written down.
AL:    Part of that is...
BJ:     Drawed out.
AL:    ...is, there's a blues about it.   I've heard it on a 
record of Bessie Smith.
