They Are Still Hoping

We in America do not yet know what 
it is to have our cities bombed, our towns 
devastated and suffer the inhuman slaughter of 
defenseless people. 

We are lucky. There is a little village in
Czechoslovakia that is not so lucky. This little 
village has known all the terrible destruction 
and brutal slaughter of the cruel tyrant, Hitler.

This little village is called Ledice. Its people
became furious at the Germans and killed
a German general. This seemed so little they
had done, but for the murder of one man
the village payed a terrible price. All the men
of the village were shot down, and the women
and children sent to concentration camps.

It is unbelievable that even the Axis
could be so cruel and ruthless and care so
little for human life.

Ledice knows that tyrant cannot live
forever, and so she still has hope in her allies.
It is well that she can hope for if or when a
country loses hope, all is lost.
