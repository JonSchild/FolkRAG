heavily, however, and occasionally becomes so boisterous in his cups
that he begins to break up the furniture, and makes himself so objectionable 
that Erzilie is forced to leave him until he becomes sober.

Ogun, in Haiti, as in Nigeria, is the god of war.  The 
Nigerian Shango is also found, though the Haitians conceive Shango
as a loa who acts as the servant of the Ogun deities, particularly
Ogun Badagri and Ogun Batala.  Ogun "eats" red cocks, red beans mixed
with rice, and his color, red, is worn by his devotées.  To this fact
may be referred the custom of the Caco warriors who fought against the 
American Marines in 1918-1920 to wear red as their distinguishing color,
something referred to by Wirkus, (pp. 22 ff.), though he combines an
explanation having an element of correctness-"a charm against harm"-
with entire misunderstanding when he speaks of the color as symbolizing
a "declaration of a holy war against wrong and oppression."  Some, but
not all, of the Ogun loa drink Haitian rum.  Ogun himself is identified
with St. James the Elder, and his sacred day is Wednesday.  This loa is
a Neg' défence and protects his worshippers from bullets or wounds
inflicted by other weapons.  Ogun Balandjo guards travellers, though he
is not as strong as such others of the Ogun group as Ogun Badagri and
Ogun Batala, with whom he shares the bamboo tree as a habitation.  The
former gives connaissance,--knowledge,--which permits those he possesses
to prophesy; the latter endows with the ability to prepare healing baths.
The Ogun loa, Erzilie, and Damballa, are jealous gods.  On the day sacred
to each, a devotée puts fresh linen on his bed, places powder, soap and
a comb nearby, and sleeps alone.  If the devotée is a woman, her husband
sleeps elsewhere, if a man, his wife must seek another place, otherwise
the transgressor would die.
