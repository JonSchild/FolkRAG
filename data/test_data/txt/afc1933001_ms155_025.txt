Dear Mrs. Brown:
Thank you for suggesting "The Indian Song" and
"The Little Pig" to us for use on the "Folk Music
of America" series of our American School of the
Air. Since various other of our listeners have
suggested this and similar songs, we feel we
would like to include it in our program.
Would you be good enough therefore to sign the
attached copy of this letter and return it to
us in order to confirm formally your consent
to our broadcasting the version of the folk
songs, "The Indian Song" and "The Little Pig"
which you have sent us.
Very truly yours,
Leon Levine
