Anecdotes, Jokes, Rhymes and Rumors

I heard that clothes, milk, cheese, and meat are going to be rationed. According to some other rumors I have heard that Hitler has had to call a psychiatrist to treat him.
There was a soldier walking around camp. A sergeant came up to him and pointed to a cigarette on the ground and said," Is that your butt?" The soldier replied, "No sarge you  saw it first."
One soldier said to another soldier, "Say Tom what is it that is green with black spots and a thousand legs?” The other. Solider said “I dont know either and you’d better get it off your neck before you get bit”
I also hear that Hitler is not getting along with his generals. He is trying to show them how to win the war.
