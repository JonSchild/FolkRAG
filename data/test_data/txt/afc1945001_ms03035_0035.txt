Jews
City Editor, Hearst Times, Detroit: "I am told that the
Detroit induction center is manned entirely by Jews and that a committee [*6*]
of Royal Oak, Michigan, citizens has filed a complaint about it with 
the Governor." August 14.
Public Relations Counsellor, Detroit Banks: "A Detroit banker
said to me August 11: 'What's a Jew boy of his age got to be given such
authority? He'll probably run into as much trouble as we had when we [*6*]
tried to run banking in Detroit with pretended bankers who were as young
as he is.'" August 11. The same source said that another banker had
criticized Nathan's youth and that there seemed growing resentment of
Nathan in local banking circles. A good portion of it be ascribed to
Jewish prejudice.
Head of research engineering laboratory: "There apparently is [*6*]
a lot of dissatisfaction over the number of Jews in Government service.
I am told by a great many people in Washington that the departments there
are filled up with them." August 13.
