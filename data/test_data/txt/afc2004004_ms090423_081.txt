37. 

This account, albeit restricted to a single case is true also of 
others on the plantation. He speaks of reading a book, the Miracle 
Power, revealing the fact that the plantation Negro of to-day is 
partially literate. Significant, too, is the fact that he tries to 
learn things that "can be proven". 

Things mentioned in the foregoing pages are indicative of the 
changes going on in the church. minister, and religious behavior in 
general. They may be summarized as follows: (1) ridiculing of 
ministers; (2) the people do not attend church as regularly as they 
once did; (3) the greater emphasis upon the pecuniary and secular 
values than upon the spiritual life of the community; (4) increased 
literacy, and finally, the plantation Negro church is losing its all 
inclusive functions through competition with other activities within 
and without the community. To-day the plantation Negro has many 
alternatives of going to places other than the plantation church.    

The data seems to indicate that the religious behavior of the 
plantation Negro is being affected by the participation of the community 
in the urban way of life. In the light of the foregoing discussion we 
can conclude that the Negro church is changing and yet the church 
because it has had a long history resists change. Thus, it still plays 
an important part in social life of the plantation Negro.
