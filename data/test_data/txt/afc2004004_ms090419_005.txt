Greensnake-4

There's a good looking girl at home, sitting under a tree,
you know, waiting on her company.  The boy flew there, cut a somersault,
tunred into a ring and got on her finger. Greensnake flew down
there, cut a somersault and turned into a man, dressed to kill,
plenty clothes, big stripes in his pants, diamond stick pin, courtin
that girl.  All his talk, "Baby, give me that ring."  Just about the time he over'suaded her to give him that ring, boy jumped off her
finger, cut somersault, turned into a box of mustard seeds, flew up in
the air and busted. Greensnake cut somersault, turned into an old hen
with a hundred chickens picking up them mustard seeds. Just about that
time I left.
