The
Federal Workers
School
Mid-Winter Announcement
(Second Term)
Beginning week of February 7th, 1938
Workers in the Government Service and in
private industry have given their enthusiastic support
to the Federal Workers School. To meet the 
educational needs of labor in Washington, the school
has offered courses in a number of subjects ranging
from union organization, labor economics and
social legislation to current events and international
relations. Several workshop courses in public 
speaking, theater, literature and the dance rounded 
out the program.
In this second semester the school is offering
a number of new courses for which considerable 
demand has become evident.
The Federal Workers School seeks in general
to increase the effectiveness of workers in their 
unions and to promote a greater appreciation of 
the position of workers in society. Enrollment, 
however, is open not only to federal workers and 
union members, but also to anyone who can profit 
by the courses and who wishes to advance his understanding
of the world today.
