Cho;   6} O Lord
	      } Will you come by here?                     A song that 
						                           mounts like a rising wind
            6  } Right now –				                   of sadness
                } In the needy time			      a noble and unrestrained
						                            appeal to the whole
	      6} O Lord				                     of heaven - 
	        } I’m the humble child

	      6} O Lord,
                } Will you hear my groans?
