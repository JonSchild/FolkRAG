Dear John:

We all missiseeing you and hearing you and drinking big bottles of whiskey with
you.  This summer I am doing nothing but file papers and typewrite.

There has been a real drop in interest in folk music in this country because of
rock-n'-rolle, and there are fewer jobs at the moment.  I fell, however, that next year
or the year after things will pick up again and we will be able to involve the group
in tours and so forth.

I tried hard to get the whole group invited back to Newport.  In fact, I threatened
them all many times, but this year they only wanted Bessie with some children's
dancing.  Please believe I tried hard.

Please give my regards to all my friends on the Island.

Yours with love,

Alan, Ann and Joan
