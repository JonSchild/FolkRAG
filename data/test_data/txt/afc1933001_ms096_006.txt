Mr. John A. Lomax:

I quote below summary of a review of Our Singing Country which
appeared in Revisto do Brasil Ano, No. 45 3d fase (March 1942).
Alan asked Mr. Chase of the Music Division to prepare the summary for you.

"We have here an admirably conceived work, which, although done with greatest scientific care, is within the reach of everyone.  The authors have transferred to written notation the most attractive and most characteristic anthology of phonograms from the most valuable Archive of Washington. . .  The anthology can be used according to
their wishes by anyone, be they composers or scientists, for their
studies and inspirations, be they students, housewives or radio performers.  That is . . .  they could be used if it were not for the 
notice, absurd in my view, "All rights reserved", which seems to me capitalistic and unjustifiable.  The Lomaxes have used material belonging to a public institution, and it matters little that it was collected by them.  It was for that reason they were appointed to remunerative positions.  This public material is published, but it becomes "reserved"!  I do not wish to understand such a state of affairs."

Miss Rogers is working out some problem connected with your
travel voucher.  I believe you hear from her in a day or so.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant,
Archive of American Folk Song
