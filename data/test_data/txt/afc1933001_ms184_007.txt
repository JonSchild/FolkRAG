to be true. (We're still in it.)

Finally, Alan, you have overlooked 
one other important point. The rating was 
for the period ending Mar. 31, 1942 and was 
written at a time when you were writing 
me notes stating that I was not interested in 
the progress of your work because [I] you thought 
I had failed to order typewriters which of 
course I had. If the period involved had 
extended to June 30, I should have noted 
a marked improvement - I might almost 
say a distinct change - because we seemed 
to get along much better during the past 
couple of months. At any rate, I hope 
that I shall have an opportunity to indicate 
this next time. 

Before closing, let me say 
that I sincerely appreciate the attitude 
taken by you in your message to me 
and hope that you will find the 
explanation here give to be helpful 
and reassuring.

Regards, 
Harold
