2. There is a story going around about a U. S. customs official who 
shot an old Mexican woman. It appears that she wanted to cross the 
border and one of the officials grabbed her handbag in a rather 
unceremonius fashion which frightened her and she ran from him. He 
then shot her. (Mexican citizen banker and businessman, Mexicali, 
Baja, California - Phoenix 8-6-42)
