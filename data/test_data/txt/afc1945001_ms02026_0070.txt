For example, the following statement was made by a steel worker
in a defense plant:

I don't believe there is a sugar shortage, this
ration business is a lot of humbug. The other day I
read in the Tribune where a business house stored
thousands of pounds of sugar in a basement and it happened
to rain, the basement was flooded and the sugar
was melted. This probably isn't the only case.

2.  There is pronounced feeling about the role of certain groups
in the war effort. In the Negro community one of our listeners overhead
the following statement made by a Negro in a tavern the night before his
induction:

I had rather fight here at home for rights denied
me than go abroad to fight unless Negroes get a better
break in everything.

Here is the state of a Negro doctor:

I can't see myself volunteering when the doors
to so many places where aid to win the war is vitally
needed are closed in my face. When I am called
I shall gladly go. But to volunteer, seems to me a
farce.

From both South Chicago and the Italian West Side we get pronounced anti-Jewish statements. Here is a statement made by an Italian
youth in his own home.

Most of the Jews are to blame for this war.
Hitler was right in kicking out all the Jews, although
he should not have attacked the other countries
who were not bothering him at all. There
aren't a heck of a lot of Jews in the Army, is
there? No. They stay home getting rich while the
other boys go out and get killed. Damn them! Why
doesn't the government look into this?
