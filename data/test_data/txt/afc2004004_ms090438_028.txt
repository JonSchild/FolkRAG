1. The Bible is said to be written by Holy Men of old,
As they were moved by the Spirit of God wrote down what they
were told; They wrote about these troubled times which we
are passing through; These days got everybody troubled—So
they don't know what to do.

— CHORUS —
These days got everybody troubled, not only me and you—
It's got the rich and the poor, and every nationality—So they
don't know what to do. (Repeat chorus twice.)

2. In nineteen thirty-seven there was awful times you know;
Through many towns and countries God let his water flow;
People were so distressed could hardly make it through; These
days got everybody troubled so they don't know what to do.

— CHORUS —

3. This flood is Bible prophesy in harmony with God's will;
Recorded thousands of years ago and now its being fulfilled;
Chunks of ice falling from the heavens, men dying all around;
Multitudes swept away, rivers breaking though dry ground.

— CHORUS —

4. The water commenced rising — rose up higher and higher
Until it filled up every creek, river, lake and bayou;
The rain continued falling about 23 nights and days,
Until the water had covered a portion of eleven states.

— CHORUS —

5. There are people living in this world who have seen many
floods years ago, But the flood of nineteen thirty-seven is the
worst ever seen before. There's thousands of acres of land that's
never been flooded before; There was thousands of people driven
from their homes and no place to go.

— CHORUS —

6. Many sacks of dirt was gathered, men worked with all
their power, But the levees still were threatening, water rising
more each hour; They did all they could do, but the water went
through; These days got everybody so troubled so they don't
know what to do.

— CHORUS —

7. Many camps were established to care for the refugees,
Thousands of doctors and nurses to battle with disease.
Soup kitchens were soon erected to feed the hungry souls,
While thousands and thousands of others were shivering in the
cold.

— CHORUS —

8. With more than four-hundred people dead, half-billion dollar
property loss; More than a million cared for by the Red Cross;
Whole cities were in darkness, communication lines were down,
Short wave stations were set up to broadcast news around.

— CHORUS —

9. Now goodbye refugee people, and in my last appeal
If you will put your trust in the Lord He will surely heal;
God almighty is the prince of peace, He's true, good and kind;
If you call on Him in time of need He will ease your troubled
mind.
— CHORUS —
