THE MINES OF COAL CREEK

Sut up in the mines of Coal Creek
I know we're bound to die
But if we'll trust in Jesus,
Our souls to Heaven will fly.

The birds are sweetly singing
And the sun is shining bright
But in our place of torment
It is as dark as night.

Chorus:

Oh, I see my loved ones
My wife is in distres
She does not know her husband
Is going home to rest

But I must die, my darling,
For death is close at hand
I'm going home to heaven
To dwell in a better land.
