(1)   War is hell. It is hated in the minds and
    hearts of mankind. It is destructive, tearing
     down the things we have built up.
(2)         Americans, lets do our best
              to defend our country like all the rest,
               against Hitler, mussolini , and the Japanese
              who are all America's enemies.
             If we want to do what's right
             then let's get together and help America fight
              If we are willing to lend a hand
               God will help us to save our land.
