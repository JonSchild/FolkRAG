   Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 3.--Mr. X told me about a carpenter
friend of his who had just returned from an Iceland construction
job.  He commented on the tremendously high salaries they had been paid
there--more than high ranking Government and company officials--due to
unlimited overtime and high wages.  He said there were a lot of "draft
dodgers" there.  He himself had not registered and he was contemplating
accepting another foreign construction job rather than to register for
the Draft, although this depended somewhat upon where such jobs were
available.
