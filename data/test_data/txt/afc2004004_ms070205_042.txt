trying anything = Again
Forster helped his brother's employer
out - the farmer was
being persecuted by an Italian
neighbor & F's brother
wasn't able to help him.
So F went about through
the bush tearing the stuff
down - little wooden crosses
with chains around them
and bunches of keys and 
everytime one would come
down, it would roar like
the bush was falling -
