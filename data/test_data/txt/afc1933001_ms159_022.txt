Mr. Alan A. Lomax
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

My dear Mr. Lomax:

Many thanks for the material you sent for your circular which
Mr. Erstein has acknowledged and also for your okeh on the leaflet costs
he has sent you. This may seem like an expense to you, but it is really
impossible to get lecture engagements on the fees we are after for you,
unless we have something to leave with the committees. I believe you
will find this has been an investment worth while.

On the matter of Program advertising, please understand that we
are not urging you at all to do this advertising except for the regular
ads which we are running in Program monthly and which you have seen along
with all the other artists. The reason we notified our artists of the
September issue was that they make their own decision about the value of
being included in this special edition of the magazine which they are trying
to make a sort of Year Book on the type of the February issue of Musical
America. They feel this will be kept for constant reference for program
chairmen, and from that standpoint, if you feel that it is advisable
to participate, that is entirely up to you.

We are sorry that you cannot be here on the 26th, but I hope
that you will be able to meet the representatives in the early Fall as this
is always very helpful.

If you will look at your letter of July 10th, you will note that
you sent me a script for a Mr. Farnell and gave me absolutely no information
as to who it was for. I have been trying to find out from everyone around
here to whom it should go to, and was just about to wire you on it when your
letter came. I assume that this script is in answer to a request for this
material and I am getting it to Mr. Farnell immediately. We shall see that
you get a report as quickly as possible.

I hope that it's not too hot in Washington. Best regards. I am

Sincerely yours,
Isabel R. Scott
