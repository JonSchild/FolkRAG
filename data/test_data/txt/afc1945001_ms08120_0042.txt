One night a friend of mine
who is a sailor well he was 
on his furlough and there a
bunch of us out so we went
to a party this boy is always
making some smart remarks
and making us laugh so
there was a very cute girl
there so he told us to listen
to his conversation with the
girl so he asked her to dance
they were dancing and
so he said what kind of perfume
do you wear so she told him
and she was blushing so he
says it smells slightly like [a]
the stock yards.
