In discussing various things with this party he made the statement that a few
days prior to the time I was talking to him he had heard the rumor in the western
part of North Carolina that a Selective Service official had made the statement
in the presence of owners of small farms that due to a shortage of farm labor in
all probability it would be necessary for the Selective Service System to take
over small farms and operate them and put the farmers into defense work.  This
statement was told to me by a man who holds a prominent position in a farm association
and who travels the State and comes in contact with numerous people who
are operators of small farms.  This man stated to me that this statement had, had
a very bad affect on the farmers in the locality in which the statement was made
dur to the fact that the farmers were fearful that the Army would take over their
farms and operate them and thereby deprive them of their property.  [*14*]
