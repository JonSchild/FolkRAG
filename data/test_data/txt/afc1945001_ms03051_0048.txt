Dear Mrs. Miles:

I am afraid I cannot
be of much help to you with reference to
the matter contained in your letter of
October 5.

I have had absolutely
no discussion of any of the subjects named
except that of racial relations, and you
you are fully familiar with the rumors
which were going the rounds in Memphis the
early part of this week.

I will keep this matter
in mind and if I run across something relating
to the subjects you mention, I will be glad
to communicate with you.

Sincerely yours,
[*Clifford Penland*]
Clifford Penland
Executive Secretary
