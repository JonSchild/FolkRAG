NEW JERSEY

Many of current rumors are concerned with shipping
activities along New York waterfront.  Rumor of
1,500 corpses being returned by ship to Brooklyn Navy Yard from Pearl
Harbor persists.  Rumor mongers appear to be people who have nothing
else to do.

NEW MEXICO

Rumor that United States lost half its fleet at
Pearl Harbor has been finally discredited.  There
are recurrent rumors that anti-Semite sentiment is growing along Atlantic
seaboard, and Jews whisper that they fear they will be a persecuted race
after the war.

NEW YORK

Public is showing far greater resistance to rumors
than in December and January; farmers usually pay
little attention to them.  Greatest rumors were concerning Pearl Harbor
incident when it was said that our losses "were a thousand times worse
than the casualty lists show" circulated by ex-members of America First
Committee, and that a great Navy ship had arrived in Brooklyn with
thousands of bodies of dead soldiers from Hawaii.  Commandant of the
Third Naval District issued a statement denying this tale.  It is thought
that Axis agents are responsible for two rumors now occurring in Harlem.
First is that, although many Negroes in Harlem are not getting enough to
eat, shipments of food are piled up on piers and are allowed to rot
because ships are not available.  Second is that unit of American Negro
troops was deliberately left behind on Bataan Peninsula, and that
Filipinos made up rest of force left behind.  Rumor apparently originating
in Yorkville section of Manhattan, a Nazi stronghold, is that
President has agreed with Stalin to abolish Congress and make this a
Soviet nation.

NORTH DAKOTA

Few rumors heard are unimportant -- having to do with
Japanese escaping from internment camps and the
number of our soldiers being shot by guards when coming in after hours.

OHIO

There are many rumors and reports of rumors; however, 
they carry little weight with the average citizen.
Social Justice is held responsible for the spreading of much propaganda
which circulates in the form of rumors.  Another breeding ground for
propaganda of the rumor kind is found in the "letters to the editor"
columns of newspapers.  Many church groups feel that everything they hear
is closely related to the "gospel truth."  Director feels that definite steps should be taken to enlist active war effort support among church
leaders of this country.

OKLAHOMA

While exhorting public to examine all rumors, press
has set up its own definitions for rumors, consequently
quotes unindentified experts only to extent it so desires and
frequently gives public an incomplete story.  Public realizes that press
and radio are supplying only incomplete pictures, but is at a loss as how
to determine between rumor and fact.  Consequently public is highly
skeptical of everything given it through regular channels and is not
infrequently relying on information from somewhat unreliable sources.
