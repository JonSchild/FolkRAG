Dear Alan Lomax -

We should come up with something, but don't be overly 
optimistic. Screening rushes can be heart-breaking.

We're still not settled re settings. Some shots can be 
done [xxx] against black velvet which won't register. For 
the others, Pete Seegar & Bess suggested we try to avoid any 
suggestions of a studio &  I know what the mean: the MCA 
atmosphere.  And that we avoid any phon[e]y props. An old-time 
porch would be good, but there aren't any around, short of 
studio rentals. We may just break up the studio background 
with incidental junk -/[xxxxxxxxxx] & shoot it out of focus. I'm afraid 
that if we go outside we will lose the tight sound control 
the studio offers.

I doubt if any money comes out of this venture for anyone, 
so the only reason for doing it is the fun of doing it right. 
If you were here I'd ask you to direct & supervise editing; 
as things stand the first is impossible, though I hope the 
second isn't.

As I mentioned, I saw the Buzzard Lope just before the war 
performed by the Rappahannock of Tidewater Virginia. I was 
then a student, accompanying Frank Speck on one of his trips. 
We assumed, at the time, that it was an African dance brought 
over by slaves and preserved by the very conservative Indians.  
The coat symbolized a dead mule; the chorus went" 'Pluck-a-pluck -a 
mor' meat / Pluck-a-pluck -a mor' meat  / Socko / Socko" with the 
lead dancer plucking out the mules eyes at the words Socko.

Incidentally, I saw a very old horse costume, much like the 
Cornwall one,/ in storage in the Museum for Folk Culture in Hamburg. And 
on the jacket cover (& inner illustration) of Andre Malraux's 
THE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE GODS there is a 12th (?) century 
sketch of one. The figure is still made in miniature in Poland 
as a toy.
