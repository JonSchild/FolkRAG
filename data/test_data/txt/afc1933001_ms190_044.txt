     For quite some time I have been trying to interest the Red Cross in
the possibility of doing documentary recording in their overseas operations.
It was not until I met Mr. Korson that my suggestion was sympathetically
received. As Dr. Botkin points out in the attached memorandum, Mr. Korson
is a reputable folklorist and has worked hard to obtain approval for the
project. The general plan is to do this recording in the North African
and Near Eastern theatres of operations. It is impossible to designate
at present any more specific localities because the Red Cross operations
naturally follow the advance of our task forces. I recomme[d]nded emphasis
in the Mediterranean area because the Library already has connections
in the Pacific through its cooperative projects with the United States
Marine Corps. It is needless to point out that this project is directly 
connected with the war effort, and with any luck at all should bring to
the Library material of the greatest historical importance. For this
reason I earnestly recommend its approval.

     Respectfully,
