The  analysis of rumors can best be done by persons trained in the social sciences.  Local universities will generally have [crossed out: some such] experts on their staffs who can be asked [Crossed Out: recruited] to serve on the project and supervise the analysis.  Rumor analysis should [Crossed Out: tell] indicate what rumors are being spread, [Crossed Out: with] how widely, and [Crossed Out: what frequency,] in what circles.  Such analyses [Crossed Out: show] reveal what the rumor problems are, how serious they are, and toward whom information must be directed.  
CONTORL PROGRAMS - INFORMATION

1.   Never repeat a rumor.
2.   Do not repeat a rumor verbally even to deny it.
3.   If you know the facts which can spike a rumor, cite the facts promptly.
4.   If you do not know the facts which can stop a rumor, ask the rumor-teller where he got his facts.
