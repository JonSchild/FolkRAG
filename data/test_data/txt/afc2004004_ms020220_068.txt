girl', an' we jus' come up together [an'] in the fields an' the
house an' whatnot, ya know?  An' they go to town, I stayed
up, you know, to they house with them, you know, like that.
Old folks'd go to town.  An' we played.  An' see, we had [this]
jist a good time.  We'd go out in the field an' -- me an' Leola,
the lil' girl -- an' bus' up watermelons.  She was smaller than
I was.  An' we'd go out there an' bus' up watermelons.  Now, to keep the
people from knowin' that we were goin' [to] in the patch, ya know,
we would go in the watermelon patch backwards.  An' come out
forward.  Walkin' the same track.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ain' that
the devil!  Chirruns can do some devilment!  Me an' the white
chirrun, nobody but me an' the white chirrun. Ha, ha!  Out in
they own field.  Mr. Langford, he would find out, see?  I come in

tracks, backwards.  I come out forwards.  She come out forwards,
stepped right in my tracks.  One trail of two, two little
tracks goin' barefooted.  Ha!  All barefooted.  Mr. Langford
caught up with us.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  He, he caught up with us.
He, he'd go down in the field by the stomp (stump) of a tree
or sumpin' an' bus' it.  They'd be green, we'd go back an' get
another one.  That same trail.  Hum, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Backwards, hah,
an' fo'wards. . .
