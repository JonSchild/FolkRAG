Lucien Warner's outline, July 16, 42

If we accept two propositions

1. That O.W.I. should (within the limits of strategy
considerations) provide those facts [most satisfying
to the public's new hunger [strikethrough]], and [which best supply the public's
news demand] [handwritten]]

2. That people speculate and gossip most concerning those
matters lacking official confirmation which intrigue
them most,

it follows that a careful analysis of prevalent rumors should help 
answer this question:-

Concerning what subjects should O.W.I. make every effort to supply
more information? Conversely, what topics are by inference of minor
importance?
