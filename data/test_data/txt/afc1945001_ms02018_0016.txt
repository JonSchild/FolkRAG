Defense Workers
1.  All a fellow needs to know is how to hold a hammer without dripping
     it and he can get a job on any war project.  (Employer.  10/7/42)
2.  Defense workers will have no money to pay their income taxes, because
     they are spending it as fast as they get it.  They may make a report,
     but even if they don't, how can the Government check these people
     who are here today and gone tomorrow.  (Office employe in private
     industry.  10/9/42)
