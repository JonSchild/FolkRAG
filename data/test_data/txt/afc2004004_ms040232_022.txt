    Oh  - oh - eile 
    Ill - e - o - gú.
Cha leid mise mochd d' on bhualidh &
Gun did chumen gun dá bhuaraich, 
Note The milk maid was to take two
miliking cogs & two shackles with
her to the milking fold, also a
peck of meal, and ale for a 'fearing'
'Fuarag' is moist brose misnamed
in English, 'cowdie.'
In older times Highlanders brewed
ale from heather bloom, healther
ale the necihe of which is lost.
Almost every house wife brewed 
whiskey until early in the 17th Century. 
Atholl brose is made with meal
honey (if possible) and whiskey -
so the meal & mixed with ale is an earlier
edition of the athol brose!!!
We gather that the milk maid
expected a mysterious stranger
at the cattle fold for whom she
was bringing food.
