Unsatisfactory - The degree of efficiency or lack of efficiency represented by inadequate (weak) performance in important phases of an employee's work assignment.

The terms outstanding, adequate, and weak as used in the above definitions are defined as follows:

Outstanding - An employee is considered outstanding if his service is distinctly better than what would be expected, after a reasonable period of training, of a fully competent, qualified, acceptable employee in the same kind and level of work.

Adequate - An employee is adequate if his service conforms to what would be expected, after a reasonable period of training, of a  fully competent, qualified, acceptable employee in the same kind and level of work.

Employees and supervisors are encouraged to discuss their ratings. In this way the employee may learn those aspects of his performance in which he can improve, and the supervisor, by discussion with the employee, may assist him in developing ways and means to generally improve his work. An intelligently administered and an intelligently accepted rating system can go far toward establishing a more efficient organization, assisting those who need improvement and rewarding those who demonstrate efficiency.

Supervisors, division chiefs, or members of the Efficiency Rating Committee will be glad to answer questions, not already answered above, on the efficiency rating system.

The Efficiency Rating Committee hopes to have all ratings reviewed and reports sent to individual employees on or about May 15, 1943.
