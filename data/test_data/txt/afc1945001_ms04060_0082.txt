10.  We returned from a visit in Canada about a week ago and all those
people talk about is how much they hate the English.  We picked up 
two boys who are members of the air force and took  them with us for
about 100 miles.  They called the English everything they could think
of, said they had been to a training school in Eastern Canada, where
the instructors took a very arrogant attitude toward the Canadians,
did not know their business, and did very little except drink tea.
