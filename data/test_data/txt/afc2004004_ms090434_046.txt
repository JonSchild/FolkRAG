Have You Ever Visited My Store?

Or perhaps I run a garage or a shop.  But have you
Ever been in my place of business?  For many weeks now
the merchants and business men whose ads appear on
this page have been telling the story of Clarksdale to our
friends and neighbors of other counties and inviting our
home folks to visit us.
We want your patronage.  To be successful in business
we need your patronage.  We solicit it on the basis of
giving you good merchandise or good advice.
We are boosting and shall continue to boost this community.
We believe in Clarksdale.  If you trade with us it
will help us give employment to more people.  Those people
in turn will build more homes and buy more groceries
and drygoods.  They will buy from you just as you buy
home concerns will help us give you a job someday when
you need one.
It is all a wheel within a wheel.  We work together for
a fine and more prosperous and happier Clarksdale.  We
are trying to do our part through this series of advertisements
in The Daily Press.  We practice what we
preach.  We invite you to come to see us.  We want to
get acquainted.
Sincerely yours,
The Merchants and Business Peoples
Whose Names Appear On This Page.
