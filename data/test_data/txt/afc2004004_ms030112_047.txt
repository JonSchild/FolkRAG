GARY:
Can't walk. You have to make your own path. 
LARRY: 
Well I know that, but if it hadn't been for you I don't

GARY: 
Somebody got to pull you up, you can't get up by yourself. 
LARRY: 
Yeah, I remember something you told me 10 years ago now. 
What you told me, you said Larry before you can lead somebody,
first you got to be led. 
GARY: 
That's right, thats right. 
LARRY: 
You remember you told me that? A long time ago now. 
GARY: 
And nobody can't tell you about something, that you already 
know, that have to tell you about something you don't know. 
LARRY: 
That's right.
