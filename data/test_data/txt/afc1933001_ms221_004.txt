Choo-choo and Fidelis used to 
frolic. The three  of you scampered

colors were beautiful - all 
shades from pale yellow, bright 
crimson, to deep green - now

blanket in the cold bathroom next
to the sleeping porch, one happy
Yule-tide morning in the not 
very long ago. I do want 
you back again amid the 
same scenes that will last
