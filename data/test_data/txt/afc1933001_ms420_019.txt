Fragments of Two Strike Songs from New York City

Strike of B. S. and A. U. at Metropolitan News Co., Spring of 1936.
Song made up by Murray Nathan and sung on picket line.

Tune: Farmer in the Dell

We pity our bosses five
We pity our bosses five
A thousand a week is all they get, 
How can they keep alive?

Oh! we pity the boss' son,
We pity the boss' son,
Fifty a week is all he gets,
The lousy son of a gun.

Oh! (repeat)

When the bosses would appear, the pickets would sing this. One boss
drew up in his car unnoticed by the pickets, and as he stepped out of
his car, the policeman on duty started the song softly as a hint to the
pickets who took it up vigorously.
-----------------
A song used in the longshoremen and seamen strike, winter of 1933 or 
1934. It appeared in the Daily Worker; but I don't have the exact reference.

Tune: Oh Susannah

Chorus: Oh you bosses,
Here's our ABC,
You can take your arbitration
And go throw it in the sea.
