Fisk, 3. 3. DAVE EDWARDS.
JELLY ROLL BLUES.

Jelly roll, jelly roll,
Hanging on my mind -
It hypnotized my daddy
And run my mamma blind -
I love my jelly
I love my jelly roll.

Lords have mama
Why don't you stop in
She's standin round the corner
Doing the double belly twist
Chorus - first verse

Lot's of fancy guitar picking

It by - my mama
Run my brother blind
-
Sister got the rubboard
Brother got the tab
Sister got the rubboard
And brother got the jie?
Chorus is first verse
Toola have mama
Can't you see
- ? -
Is killing po' me.
