The Cowboy at Church

Cowboys call a minister a "sky pilot." For a sincere preacher of

The ranchmen and cowboys come for hundred of miles to listen to
his sermons. Whole beefs are barbecued for the crowds that throng to
hear the eloquent "dude" preacher from the city. The cowboys join
in singing, and sometimes sing a suitable cowboy song.

The eloquent minister has persuaded many a one to live a better
life-- to quite his meanness, leave the stray herd, get branded with
a C and drift into the trial herd bound for glory.

"Bill, please grumble over this food a little before we eat it."

Startled and embarrassed at this unlooked-for request, greeted by
a dead silence, Bill finally stammered out:
