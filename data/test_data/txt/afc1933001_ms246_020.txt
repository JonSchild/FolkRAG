Dear Sir:

Re: "GREY GOOSE"

Thank you for your letter of December 2nd. We
have since heard from Alan Lomax who advises that he has been
authorized to set a fee on your behalf for the use of "Grey 
Goose" in our motion picture TALL TALES.

He has set a fee of $25.00 instead of the proposal
we made to you.

In full settlement of the matter, we enclose herewith
our check in the amount of $25.00 in payment.

Sincerely yours,
BRANDON FILMS, Inc.
