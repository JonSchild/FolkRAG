EXCERPT - Letter of February 8, 1943 - A. Lomax to W.C. Haygood, Rosenwald.

     Professor Willis James.has been highly recommended to 
me by both Sterling Brown and William Bond, and his letters 
have been full of interesting comments on the folk group of 
his region. He wishes to carry out a study of wartime folklore 
in the same region in which he has worked successfully for a 
number of years, namely, Central and Southern Georgia. This 
is an area from which we have few recordings of Negro folk 
songs and such records would make a valuable contribution to 
the files of the Library of Congress. If Mr. James could come 
to Washington some time this Spring, he and I could develop 
a plan which would serve to greatly expand our present knowledge 
of South Negro folk music and aid in the wartime program I 
have suggested above. His fellowship might amount to $2,500 to cover 
recording expenses in his area and a certain amount of travel.
