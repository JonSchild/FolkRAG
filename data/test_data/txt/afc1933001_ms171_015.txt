Dear Miss Breeden:
So far as I know the two very interesting folk songs you
sent have no financial value. They do, however, have interest for the
collector of folk songs and for the Archive of American Folk Song. I
would greatly appreciate you sending them along with others that you may
happen to have at your disposal, to the Archive collection.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
