Dec. 29th Pont Beudet, Dr. Reiser's house.
Dr. Reiser is the warden of the national insane
asylum at Port Beudet, a little Haitian villiage
community on one of the Haitian American Sugar Company
spurs ten miles north of Port-au-Prince on the road
 to Hinche in the lowland neck of the great plain of the Cul-de-Sac.
To the North are the great tawny mountains
of the       which look as barren as the mountains
of Northern Mexico about Parras but which Dr.
Reiser assures me hide many fertile canyons
where bananas, etc., abound. Here on the Cul-de-Sac
of course the land is highly fertile.
The banana and cane plantations are orderly
jungles. Something about the banana grove makes
it the most tropical thing I have ever seen. Something
completely foreign about it to the very nature
of the temperate zone. Something exaggerated about
the size of its great knife like leaves - a huge palm
with forty feet of its bole buried out of sight in
the earth - a celery stalk under the microscope
- a beet a million times bigger than it ought to 
be.
The institution is inconspicuous among the ear-like
banana leaves -- a set of low-lying
green and white sheds, cast-iron roofs --
