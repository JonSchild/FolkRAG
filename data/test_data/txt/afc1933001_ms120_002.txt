Dear Alan, 
I was very sorry to hear that you are
having so much trouble. The librarian had 
already communicated with the State Department 
when your letter arrived this morning. 
I believe that your request for an extra
allowance has also been approved. Furthermore, 
Mr. Voorus tells me that your check 
for the period February 11th to March 11th, 
has already been sent you.
 
Mr. Morgan made an immediate investigation 
about your camera and reports that 
there is a sunshade already attached tothe 
apparatus. A filter has been ordered and 
will be sent you immediately. I hope that 
this covers your needs for the time being. 
Regards from all, 
Sincerely, 
Harold Spivacke
