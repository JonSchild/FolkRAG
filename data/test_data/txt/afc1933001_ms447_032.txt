120. It's Lit-tle Joe, the wrang-ler, He'll wran-gle nev - er-more,
His days with the re - mu - da they are o'er;
'Twas a year a - go last A - pril he rode in - to our camp,--
Just a lit - tle Tex - as stray and all a - lone.

It was late in the eve - ning he rode up to our herd
On a lit - tle Tex - as po - ny he call'd Chaw;
With his bro - gan shoes and ov'-ralls, a tough-er look- in' kid
You nev - er in your life be - fore had saw.

127. Good - by to my pals of the prai - rie. Good -
by to the cat - tle and the trail. Good -
by to the cards and the drink - ing, Good - 
by to the prai - ries and the vale.
