fo men on each end.  There's one man back here, he kinda like  -- well,

you say jine ion, it gets rightup on the block like that, it slips
right up there like th t.  Sometiie when you say nod his head, it

JOREEING ON THE JOB
A: What do you mean by jo-ree.
B: Well, say, like I be teasing you all the time, well , that's the way
like you do h[m]im -- just tease him, you know.  Mostly kinda half
threatening, you know; make him hop to, you know. Any way you just
teasin him, have a little fun.  Yo work long, you going dead, you

your daily work would be hard.  Just a little fun, just anything to
keep everybody alive and jolly..
