[New York Cityand Fifth Avenue]

Refrain: Oh----------O
Talkin' to my baby,
Oh----------O
An' I don'[t] mean maybe;
Recitative: When I get back to Louisiana, gonna walk and talk,
Tell ev'ybody about the city of New York.
Refrain: Oh-------O,
Talkin' to my baby,
Oh--------O,
Don' mean maybe,
Recitative: When I get back to Louisiana, tell 'em about the mighty shock,
Tell 'em New York city is built on a solid rock. 8
[Oh-----O.]

There's two things I want you to do,
When you get to New York city, go to Fifth Avenue.

When you get to New York gonna turn around,
See Fifth Avenue, the longest street in town.

When I get back to Louisiana, the people singin' "Stormy
Weather,"
You go to Dallas and New Orleans, Fifth Avenue hold more people
than the two towns put
together,

You can go to Dallas an' you can go to New Orleans,
But you go up Fifth Avenue an' you see more people than you
ever seen.

People was singing wid a doneful sound,
Get on Fifth Avenue, get a petition to a hole in the ground. **

It's thun'in' and lightnin' an' it look like rain,
In the hole in de ground you see them subway trains.

I get back to Louisiana, gonna walk and tell,
New York City is a burning Hell.
Oh-------O,
Tell you all about it,
Oh---------O,
Tell you all about it----------etc.

*The refrain and the recitatives alternate regularly throughout
the course of the song.
**Perhaps, "admission" to a subway.
