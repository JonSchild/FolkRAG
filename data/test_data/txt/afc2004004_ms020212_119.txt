... more interesting material, but this must bd stylistically consonant with the old for you to accept it. There is no reason in the world why John and Bessie and the group cannot learn to understand the levels of authenticity and time depth that their material represents. This will protect them from becoming acculturated any more rapidly than will happen in the normal course of things. I think you should do everything possible to push John to be more of a leader of the group in terms of decisions about dates, finances, etc. I also think that Bessie should not do all the KOing, because she is apparently talking more and more, and this is one of the chief barriers between the group and their public. I suspect that Henry would make a good, quiet announcer of tunes, and I suggest that you try his out at this for some of the smaller dates.

I am going right now to a meeting about a Negro folk touring company to go to Europe following the successful heels of the "Black Nativity" group. If this works out, I think it is going to furnish a long period of employment for Bessie and other Negro artists. 

Please forgive the unbrotherly tone of this letter, but I am making this all business--personal affairs curing the next few days. Our house is now big enough to accommodate one or two more Lomaxes at a time, and we would love to hear from you all. The home address is 361 West 18th Street.

Much love to you all,
