Fort Sumter Hotel
Charleston, S.C.
7/16/1937

Dear Alan : I failed to send the 
pass to the Senate, as announced in 
my last letter. Here also are 
some newspaper clippings for your 
reading, and for Mr Spivacke. In 
April the famous street criers of 
Charleston hold a contest where the 
most musical and effective peddler
is named champion. I'll 
leave their recording to you. You'll 
enjoy a trip to this quaint and 
unique city - more quainter and more 
unique than New Orleans. Then, too, 
you can have all the street criers
