Judge L. D. Miller
Chattanooga, Tennessee.

My dear Judge:-

Your letter of May 11th relative to the parole
of Allen Prothers was duly received at this office, and referred
to the penitentiary authorities. They advise me today
that this prisoner died on the 9th day of April. He would have
been eligible to be paroled on the 29h day of April, 1935, but
his case was passed because of his sickness, and it was his own
request that he be allowed to remain in the tuberculosis hospital.
He died from that disease, I am advised.

Sincerely yours,

Hill McAlister
Governor.
