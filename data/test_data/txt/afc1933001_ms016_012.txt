May 23, 1934.

John A. Lomax, Esq.
University Station,
     Austin, Texas.

My dear Mr. Lomax,
          I have your note of May 19
and the enclosure from Professor Boner. Whatever
the initial faults of the machine may
have been, I daresay that the roads of Texas
may have had something to do with the final 
breakdown. I am glad to hear that all is well 
now.

               Faithfully yours,

             Chief, Division of Music.
