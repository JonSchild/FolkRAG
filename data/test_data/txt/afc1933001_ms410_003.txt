My dear Alan Lomax:

As far as I am concerned, anyone can use anything I have
had printed, so go ahead.   The Milk White Steed, I am sorry to say, was in
the main my own invention, but the stanzas 2, 3 and 4 I heard sung by a schooner
man from Nova Acotia.  The rest I did because the fellow who sand told me he
forgot the rest, couldn't remember by any means, and had what he recalled,
(those three) from his grandfather.  But he learned what I made up and was very
happy, and sung lustily to his shipmates who, in turn, learned it from him.  So
you have the truth.  Likewise Annie Breen is a patchwork largely mine, and based
on a partially remembered ballad.  In fact I've been guilty of all sorts of
crimes in this direction I'm sorry to say.  As for Roy Bean, I knew him well
and many's the drink we had together, though I always paid.

Anything else I can do for you, Alan? If so, ask.  How would you like
to have one of my books?

Meanwhile what about letting me have copies of the songs I sang?

Sincerely with best wishes
Chas [?]
