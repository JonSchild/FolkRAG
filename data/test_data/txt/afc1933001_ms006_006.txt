marriage of a bear and an opossom. One called "The Good-Lookin' Man,"
which tells how a wife "beat up" her faithless husband, is apparently 
of native make too, tho' it's filled with old, folksong formulas.

In speaking of the native songs which were widely current,
I forgot to mention one which is known outside my district,
and which seems to be indigenous. My version begins:
Young Paddy's sore diggin' taters in the sand,
Brogues on his feet and a shovel in his hand.
He went down the street as hard as he could run,
and all he could say was, Johnny, git your gun,
Mushy ding!

It is about a boy who enlisted, and the equipment he received! In 
my part of the country it is called "The Irish Potato".

There are songs in my collection that I don't know whether
to label "indigenous" or not.  They might be of native make, and
they might also be of some late Anglo-Irish composition.   Such a one
is this, which you probably know about, tho' I don't. It is 
rather widely known; in the Appalachians, at any rate:
Come all you maids of a rambling nature, 
Come listen to my mournful song,
I loved a fair one beyond my duty;
I suffered more than the common run.

Another one of this sort is the following,â€” I'll give a stanza out of 
the middle:
I think it's high time to leave off the lads,
And commence on the ladies - they're four times as bad.
They'll powder their face and comb up their hair,
Like an owl in the bush at the boys they will stare.

The refrain, as I have heard it, is: "Derry down, down, hi derry down", or 
"Li-o, li-o, ladl-i-o!"

I have a few compositions, also, that were made in my own
particular part of the country, and were very popular there about 
forty years ago. Like most of our folksongs of comparatively recent
date, these are either laments or satires. I think it very improbable
that they have attained any wider currency than in the southwestern 
corner of Pennsylvania, and the neighboring counties of 
West Virginia. One of them  is a lament for a murdered girl. It 
begins: 
Come all you good people, wherever you be, 
Come listen a while to my sad tragedy.
