Tape:  897 cont.  Nimrod Workman   2
choose this day whom you may serve.  You can serve God, and 
he said if you don't serve God, he said you'd be cast into that
lake, you're turned over to the devil.  The devil is what
burns you, God don't burn you.  You burn yourself for not
obeying what God says for you to do.  He said all that comes
to him should not perish, but shall have eternal life.  But them
that fails him, they shall be cast into that lake.
AL:  I've always thought that was a hard doctrine.
Nimrod:  It is a hard doctrine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
AL:  People aren't stron enough to stand up to the test.
Nimrod:  They either stand up to it or lay down to it.
Now that's it. Listen, God said, let me be the truth and
nevermind the law.  And you've got to do what he says.  He
said if you fail to do it, you shall be bound hand and foot.
There'll be people like that, and they'll say, lord, I done
so and so, I done this and he said, I was in prison and you fed
me not, when I was hungry, you fed me not. . . . . .When we done
these  things to you Lord?  You've already done it unto me. . . . .
Now you see a lot of these hippies, they say, I'm gonna have
devotion. . . . . .they're going to kill them you see? . . . . .All
mothers shall have their part in that lake that burns in fire
and brimstone.
AL:  And that doesn't include just the people that shoot you
with guns, that included the people who take the bread out
of the poor man's mouth.
