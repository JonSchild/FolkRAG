Dear Mr. Lomax:
We do not seem to have received a reply to your letter of
the 12th and it is possibly due to vacation period of the
fact that you are occupied with other more important matters.
However, we would appreciate word from you at your convenience
whether you think you can substantiate the belief which
both you and we have to the effect that "Oh, Didn't He
Ramble" is older than the 1902 publication.
If we could just show in some of the books on old folk songs
that the familiar chorus of this song was known before, and
it is so stated by authoritative sources, I think it would
answer our immediate problem.
I should be glad to hear from you advising whether you
believe you can furnish the desired information, or whether
you have exhausted your sources of information in this
regard.
Very truly yours,
HC Darnell
hcd-w Manager of Copyright Section.
