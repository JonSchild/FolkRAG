"the Attack on Pearl Harbor."

On December 7, 1941 Japan attacked
Pearl Harbor, not long before than
the President of the United States
had visited Japan. The attack on
Pearl Harbor was a big blow to the
Americans because Pearl Harbor was
not guarded, and many lives were
lost. Another hard blow to the
United States was the U.S.S. Chicago
was sunk. Now we are urged
to help build a new propeller
for U.S.S. Chicago. We are asked to
buy bonds and war stamps to
help end this destructive war.
We are asked to save rubber, tin,
lead, grease will you help win
victory and gain peace?
