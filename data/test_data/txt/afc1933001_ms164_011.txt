December 7, 1940

My dear Mr. Lomax:

I have your letter of October 15, 1940 in which you
request 50 reprints of the Bibliography of American Folk
Songs compiled for the Committee of the Conference on
Inter-American Relations in the Field of Music. I re-
gret there has been some delay in attending to this
matter.

I am transmitting under separate cover the 50 copies
you requested.

Sincerely yours,
Charles S. Thomson

Charles A. Thomson
Chief
Division of Cultural Relations

Accompaniment:

Reprints (50).

Mr. Alan Lomax,
Assistant in Charge,
Archive of American Folk Song,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.
