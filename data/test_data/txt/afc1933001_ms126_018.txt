Dear Mr. Lomax,

You will note from the heading
of this letter where I landed. I was admitted to
Harvard, had a room assigned me In Perkins House,
and was all set to go. I thought there would
certainly be no objection, on the part of the General
Education Board, to my naming Harvard
instead of the University of North Carolina. However,
I was mistaken. They flatly refused to transfer
the fellowship, since they are of the opinion that
North Carolina is the best school in the country in which
to do work in the field of Southern folklore and
tradition. You know the old saying that "the one
who pays the piper can call the tune" still holds
true; so here I am.

I am glad to receive your letter at this time.
I have had these songs ready to be mailed for
sometime but I have delayed sending them until
I heard from you. You may find some of them
missing, since I have in moving lost the lists giving the
titles. May I suggest that you check these songs
against the records and if any are missing then write me the names
