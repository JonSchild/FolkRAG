Lomax: See if you've got the Foggy Dew on your mind. Are you ready
Cox: Yeah. I'll sing it when you like.
Lomax: All right, Peter.
Cox:
When I was an old bacehlor, I followed a rovin' trade,
An' all the harm that ever I done, I courted a servant maid;
I courted her one summer season an' part of the winter too,
An' many a time I rolled my love all over the foggy dew.

One ngith when I laid in my bed a-takin' my balmy sleep,
This pretty fair maid came unto me an' how bitterly she did weep.
She wept, she mourned, she tore her hair, saying, "Alas, what shall I do?
For this night I resolve to sleep with you for fear of the foggy dew."

That's a bit too high yet.

So all the first part of the night how we did sport an' play,
And all the later part of the night she in my arms did lay.
And when broad daylight did appear she cried, "I am undone."
"Oh, hold your tongue, you silly young girl, for the foggy dew is gone."
Supposin' that you should have one child it would make you laugh an' smile,
Supposin' that you should have another, it would make you think a while.
