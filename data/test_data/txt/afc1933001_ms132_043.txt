Dear Dr. Broussard:
Your note makes me regret the fact that I did not
insist on seeing the interview you mention before it
was published. In fact, when I discussed the Acadian
material with the reporter, I emphasized the importance
of Miss Whitfield's work (I have read her thesis) and
I mentioned the fact that some work was being done at
the University of Louisiana. I did not know, of course,
that the Department of Romance Languages had purchased a
recording instrument or that it planned to do systematic
work in the field. The last time I visited the University,
I heard of no project of this sort. Naturally, I
am delighted to learn that progress is being made in
this field, since my cursory contact with folk-music in
Southern Louisiana convinced me that your state is an
extremely rich field for students of folk literature and
music in the country. I hope that the Archive of American
Folk-Song may be of some service to you, and that
whatever material is collected may be deposited in duplicate 
in our files.
What I did hope that this interview would do, of
course, would be to arrouse some widespread interest in
Louisiana folk song and to bring support to whatever projects
there were for the collection of this material.
Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-Song
