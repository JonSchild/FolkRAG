Research on War Attitudes (Continued) 3

(more mature?) interviewer or "supervisor" will call upon the respondent
and explain tactfully that he wishes to fill in a little further information
and to find out how the other interview "went." Different types of
explanations will need to be tried out in order to find which encourages
the respondent to talk more fully and freely. I believe that in general
the follow–up interviewer will be able to elicit considerable additional
material from the respondent and that, at the same time, he can learn something
of the extent and nature of the respondent's resistance, deception,
and lack of frankness during the initial interview. (We shall explain to
all interviewers the plan of having these follow–up interviews in order to
avoid misunderstanding or resentment.)

c. Interviews will be tried in which the questions pertain to concrete
and specific "cases" described by the interviewer, instead of the
usual more or less abstract and general questions. Similarly, some interviews
will be built around quoted expressions of opinion with the request 
that the respondent tell his agreements and disagreements. These procedures
have been occasionally employed (the "case" description especially by Alfred
Jones in his Akron study of attitudes toward private property) but offer
opportunities for further development and adaptation to inquiries of the
kind here proposed.

d. A very small "panel" of respondents will be set up with whom a
series of intensive interviews can be conducted. The purpose here will be
to check on the usefulness of this procedure for our particular type of
study. The nature and advantages of the panel procedure have been widely
discussed in the literature.
