Lomax: Did you ever have a fight with anybody on your travels?
Davy: No, I never fought - never had no actions with no men. Just
one man in a public house in Ireland. Didn't like the Scotchman,
and I didn't fight with the man. The man  trickered my accordion,
and he called me a Scotch b-----. I didn't like to open my mouth
me being in a strange country. Just kept the accordion. He was
going to hit me but I didn't give him a chance. I hit him first.
And the other Irishmen told me I was quite right because he was
a very imperent man - says "I didn't like him myself."
     So, I got a good few shillings in the pub that night. At a 
place called Rossgrave, County Galway.
Lomax: But most of the Irish people treated you well did they?
Davy: Yes. Irish is very good. I like the Irish people. They
treat me very well. I had no arguing points, no fighting among
the Irish people. They always like me because I gave them
a little entertainment, especially when they see the accordion,
they'll follow you for miles. They like the accordion.
