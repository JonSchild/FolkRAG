saying something like "Well, maybe there aren't any Eleanor Clubs 
but there sure must be something."
         The search for authoritative facts frequently leads the column
to the person who must necessarily give one type of statement.   You
would not expect a bank president to say that it was unwise to put money
on deposit at his bank, so that calling in the banker or the treasury
official on some of the savings bank and war bond rumors is not always the
[safest] wisest thing.   To quote from a letter received by a newspaper column which had dealt with rumors about food at the Army camps may prove illuminating:

                                              The Service Club
                                              -------Training Center
                                             Camp--------, State----

September 12, 1942

Gentlemen:

"I have seen several articles in your paper dealing
on various phases of the Army mess. In a great many
instances the officer is undoubtedly correct in his
statement about "enlisted men's mess," but my experience
serves to confirm the above rumor.

"I feel that I am better qualified to judge mess conditions
than an officer who eats with us possibly twice
a week. The food is probably alright before it falls
into the hands of the cooks, but from that point on
things start to happen. Most of the cooks could not
qualify for a Hamburg stand in the vicinity of the
Barbary Coast (Philla.).     Filth predominates. Brushes
are used to scrub floors one moment and dishes the next.
Pitchers are used for many purposes for which they were
not originally intended.

"I have seen dishes and cups cracked and nicked--yet we
still use them. Last night for a beverage--a can of
tomato juice was dumped into a barrel of water.

"There have been times when the amount of food wasted
would feed 50 people--if they could eat it. Frankly I
eat in the mess hall less than 50% of my meals."

Yours very truly,
