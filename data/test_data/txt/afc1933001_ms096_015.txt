Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thank you for referring the letter of Ruth
Ann Musick to us. We are getting in touch with
her. The other matter is being taken care of by
Dr. Spivacke.

I trust you received the folk song book
which we recently forwarded to you.

In a very few days you will receive your
copies of the pressings, together with the printed
leaflets and catalog, which are ready at last.
 
With best wishes to you and Mrs. Lomax,

Sincerely yours,

B. A. Botkin
