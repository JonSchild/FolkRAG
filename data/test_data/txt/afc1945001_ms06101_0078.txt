B.  Rumor No. 2 was heard in Oklahoma City, August 3 and August 5,
1942.

1.  (First version)  "A fellow told me that anybody that had
$100.00 didn't have to go without tires, and you wouldn't
have to buy stolen ones either.  The fellow said that most
of these tire dealers just put new tires on their own cars
making used tires out of them, and then they could get their
own prices for the used tires."
