1. [As I was going into the drug store, a man]
One man said to the other did you
hear about the fellow who got his tongue 
snatch out of his mouth. The other said no
what about him. Well the wind was blowing
other day very hard and it blew a fellow's
hat off of his head. And as he reached for
his hat & his hand went up accidently. There were
other men around when they saw this
they jump on him and cut his tongue. Ha
Ha - they though he was one of Hitler [Nazi]
supermen.
