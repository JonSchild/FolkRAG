Dear Mr. Carrier:

The Archive of American Folk Song is planning to make up
a group of its best representative American folk songs to
be distributed in Latin America. Among the songs we hope
to use is your performance of "O Chere Fite Fille" which
you recorded for us. We will pay you $4.00 for the use
of this record which occupies less than ⅓ of one side
of a 12" record and we will send you two copies of it for
your own use.

I hope you will give us your permission to use this song by
signing and returning the enclosed form as soon as possible.
All the records will carry the legend, "For non-commercial
use only" and of course your name will appear on every record.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
