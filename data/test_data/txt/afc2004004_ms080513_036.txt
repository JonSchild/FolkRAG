KYLE EDWARDS.
A     [*Kyle*] [Carl] Edwards, who built the Stomping Ground
ah has made his living as a, ah, as a bulldozer
operator.  Naturally he's made a good
living.  He is a, he is a skilled bulldozerer 
and he makes ah - he - he's a, he's a, he's a
community developer.  So he decided that since
tourists were coming in to this area, into
this beautiful area, that we would make a
shrine for dancing, where he and his family
- all of whom are great dancers - ah could
dance, and where all their friends could come
and where the visitors to Maggie Valley could
enjoy the pleasure of square dancing, and
where it could find the kind of home that
jazz found at Preservation Hall, and ah, the
symphony does in, in ah Lincoln Centre and
other places.  It's the same idea, and so he
has dances there 3 times a week, gets a big
crowd, and ah, he has dance teams from all
over the place and the best of all ah of the um
