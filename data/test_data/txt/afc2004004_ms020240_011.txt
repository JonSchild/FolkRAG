up that old shell that hit was in, ya see?  That old shell [that,] jus'
he just, [that] and ah, an' it springs up a new life, inside.  Although it
was so dry that you could just chuck it around, see?  An' then it
springs up in it a new life, a green life; it become live.  Because
God's spirit and power was in it.  An' each           it,
an' met it.  An' then He went into it, ya see.  An' then it jus' --
An' after it swolled, then that new life come an' it -- How it come
up there:  It got green, got life for it, then out come a leaf.
It'll spring up.  Just like it go to shootin' up.  'Cause, an' then
it [just] come on up from the top of the ground an' show us; it['ll]
shines.  That what they call "shinin'." let the world see ya, see?
Let that light shine.  That mean it's comin' up; it got life in it;
it been bo'ned again.  See?
     I was dead.  See?  But I'm [was] bo'ned again!  Ya see?  Ya see, that's
what that is, the same way it is about a person, see?  [We] They were
dead, but when ya come into Jesus Christ, He overshadows you.  He say
[said,] "overshadow", [it] that mean come His way.  That's right.  An' then
he brings out that ol'  -- Ya throw [all a] off that ol', ol' ties, the
ol' man -- because that means sin, that mean, "I'm gonna lay
all these ol' things down, ah, that I did, I did before."
     Before this bean was, ah, was [put,] put in the groun', you could throw
it among all kindsa things.  Ya could throw it among the peas; ya
could throw it among the any, anything.  It was layin' there a bean; 
it was dry; it could [grow most] go amongst anything.  But after hit planted an'
come up, it had to be steadfast in one place an' be unmoved, until
it multiply.  It didn't 'sociate all, wit' all kindsa things.
You see?  It couldn't go out among all kindsa things.  Although when
ya let it come up an' hit git dry, the beans of it git dry, see?
Go right back ta show ya again, to be bo'n again; it yet live.  From
