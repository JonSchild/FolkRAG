I thought how often she had gone
With little Sis and me
To church when I was but a lad
'Way back in Tennessee.
It never once occurred to me
About not being dressed
In Sunday rig, but carelessly
I went in with the rest.

You should have seen the smiles and shrugs
As I went walking in,
As though they thought my leggin's 
Worse than any kind of sin;
And yet the honest parson,
In his vestry garb arrayed
Was dressed the same as I was-
In the trappings of his trade.

The congregation doubtless thought 
That the cowboys as a race
Were a kind of moral outlaw
With no good claim to grace.

Is it very strange that cowboys are
A rough and reckless crew,
When their garb forbids their doing right
As Christian people do?
That they frequent scenes of revelry
Where death is bought and sold,
Where at least they get a welcome,
Though it's prompted by their gold?

Stranger, did it ever strike you,
When the winter days are gone,
And the mortal grass is springing up
To meet the judgement sun,
And we 'tend the mighty round-ups
Where, according to the word,
The angel cowboy of the Lord
Will cut the human herd,

That a heap of stock that's lowing now
Around the Master's pen
And feeding at His fodder stack
Will have the brand picked then?
And brands that, when the hair was long,
Looked like the letter C,
Will prove to be the devil's,
And the brand the letter D?

While many a long-horned coaster-
I mean, just so to speak-
That hasn't had the advantage
Of the range and Gospel Creek,
