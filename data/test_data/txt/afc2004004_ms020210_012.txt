Dear Sister Ramsey:
A week ago I sent you a letter suggesting that some royalties,
due to Henry Morrison deceased, should come to you.  It has
been suggested by Peter Davis that Eva Powell should be the
recipient of these royalties.
I hope you can agree that Peter's opinion is correct, or that
you and Eva Powell can agree to a share of these royalties.
They will be, I warn you, small.
I take this opportunity to wish you A Very Merry Christmas.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
