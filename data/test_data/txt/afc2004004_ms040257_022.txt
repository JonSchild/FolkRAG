Mr. Macphee:
           All females, now?
Mrs. N. and Mrs. McC.:
          Oh, we wouldn't like that either!
Mr. Macphee:
          Well, that's exactly what I'm driving at.
Mr.
          I sometimes do a bit of auctioneering. I sell coal
and grain... a bit of a butcher's business, and I represent
the spirit line as well. Unfortunately, whisky is very
short. I think most of it is going over to U.S.A.
Mr. Macphee:
           The house I live in was built in 1713. I'm led to
understand that Prince Charlie and Flora Macdonald met there.
He left                House, dressed as Berry              ..........
It appears that the two of them were good-looking and I wouldn't
blame them........ (great laughter) ..... they called him "Bonnie
Prince Charlie", and they say Flora Macdonald was good-looker.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised. There might have been a bit of 
romance in it
Mr. McInnes:
           All I know is what's in the history book and that's not mentioned, but they seemed to have quite a good time from what I hear.
Mr. Macphee:
           It's only hearsay on my part. I only heard it form old
people fifty years ago. They were saying that they met at 
                    House, where I stay, and some say there wasn't
romance between them ...............
           When I've been in Glasgow a week I long to be back in
Benbecula. It's the natural country life. You can go
amongst your neighbours and your friends, and you can sit
down at a Ceilidh, and do business in a friendly way.
