BREAD AND ROSES

(Sheet Music - Published by Woman's Press)

As we come marching, marching, in the beauty of the day,
A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray,
Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses,
For the people hear us singing, "Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses."

As we come marching, marching, we battle too, for men,
For they are women's children and we mother them again.
Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes
Hearts starve as well as bodies: give us bread but give us roses.

As we come marching, marching, un-numbered women dead
Go crying through our singing their ancient song of bread,
Small art and love and beauty their drudging spirits knew
Yes, it is bread we fight for. But we fight for roses, too.

As we come marching, marching, we bring the Greater Days;
The rising of the women means the rising of the race.
No more the drudge and idler; the that toil where one reposes
But a sharing of life's glories: Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses.
