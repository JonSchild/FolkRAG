Johnson - Elijah Bell. 

1) 'Twas of two jolly butchers as I've heard many-a one say, 
Come riding out from London all on one market day, 
As they were riding along the road as fast as they could ride, 
O stop your horse, cried Johnson, I heard some woman cry.

Barbara Allen: Phil Tanner 

1) In Scarlet town where I was born 
There was a fair maid dwelling, 
Made every youth say well-a-day, 
Her name was Barbara Allen. 

2) All in the blooming month of May 
When green buds they were swelling, 
Young Jimmy Grove on his death bed lay, 
For love of Barbara Allen. 

3) He sent his man down through the town 
The the place where she was dwelling, 
You must come to my master dear 
If you be Barbara Allen. 

4) So slowly, slowly she came up, 
And slowly she came nigh him. 
And all she said when there she came, 
"Young man, I think you're dying." 

5) "A-dying man, no, no," said he. 
"One kiss from thee would cure me." 
"One kiss from me thou shalt never have, 
If thy poor heart was breaking." 

6) He turned his face unto the wall, 
The pains of death he fell in. 
Adieu, adieu, adieu to all, 
Adieu to Barbara Allen. 

7) When he was dead and laid in the grave, 
Her heart was struck with sorrow, 
O mother, mother, make my bed, 
For I shall die tomorrow. 

8) There on her death-bed does she lay, 
There to be buried by him. 
And so repented of the day 
That she did thus deny him. 

9) Farwell, she cried, ye virgins all, 
And shun the fault I fell in. 
Henceforth take warning by the fate 
Of cruel Barbara Allen.
