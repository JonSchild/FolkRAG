TAPE:  Roll 24   p. 3
(Cass) they believe, you know, speak in this unknown tongue and
stuff, you know; while the Baptists, they claim they're speaking
directly to God when they're speaking this unknown tongue -- but
the Baptists claim, you know, when they had that Pentacostal day
that Paul reside(??), there were so many people from different
nations, was what that unknown tongue was.  Preachin' Paul knowed
it all.  And these Holiness, they just fly about something and say
they're talkin' to God, and nobody else don't know who it is, only
they's talkin' to God. . .'course the Baptists don't see it that way.
Sheila:  That reminds me of the time they had that snake handlin' up
at the church.
Cass:  Yeah, well the snake handling is different from the 
Holiness song.  They'll say a little something, you know, like
they ain't got somethin' or another, and all they got to do is
grab one of them snakes and put 'em around their neck. . .
Sheila:  Well they got into a big argument the night that we were
up there, argueing as to whether they were going to get 'em out
or not. . .out of the boxes. . .they did!
Cass:  They got 'em out of the boxes fine, played with 'em. . .
Sheila:  Oh I know they did, and the churchhouse cleared out in
about 15 seconds. . . .
Cass:  I got some fun. . .
Sheila:  They were handling the snakes. . .I was beating a fast retreat
to the back of the church!
