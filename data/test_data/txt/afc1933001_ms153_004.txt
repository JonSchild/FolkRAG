NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
EIGHTH REGION
N. B. C. BUILDING
CLEVELAND, OHIO

Saturday Morning.

Dear Alan and Elizabeth:

   Things happen so fast in the Lomax family that
I have no doubt that this letter will go through half
a dozen post offices before it reaches you.  You  may even
have gone right through Cleveland en route to some place or
other, but no matter where you may be I suppose your fondness
for receiving letters accompanies you.

   Cleveland is much as I expected it to be but I am
still convinced that it will be possible for me to establish
roots here that go way down deep, if I stay long enough - something
which was utterly impossible for me in Washington.  The
Cleveland office is very different from the Washington office,
I miss the drive, the virility that exists in Washington, nor
is the personnel here of the liberal type that exists in
Washington.  New York and Washington are unique places and I
forget that all of the United States is not like that.

    Since my arrival in Cleveland, I've been busy getting
reacquainted with the family (at least one of the family is a
very worthwhile person[s] of whom I'm very fond), I've been looking
up old friends (I find that the paths of many of them diverged
a long time ago from mine and they'll never cross again).  Lake
Erie is a never ending source of delight.  I am only beginning
to realize the aching nostalgia I have had for years for the
Lake.  Swimming in it never tires me and just to drive along
its shores for me is thrilling.

Tuesday P.M.

   Three days have elapsed since I started this letter.
I've been pretty busy since, what with a week end at Vermilion,
work, house hunting, etc.  The housing situation in Cleveland is
a very bad one, there has been practically no building for about
ten years.  Our present aim is a large house with two finished
rooms in the attic which will belong exclusively to me and where
other members of the household will not come without an express
invitation.  I hope we find such a place.
