When Henry Kaiser arrived
in Washington he was late for
an appointment with the newspapermen.
"What happened?" the reporters
asked the man who had broken
all shipbuilding speed records.
"I had to wait thirty minutes
for a taxi," explained Kaiser.
"Thirty minutes?" a newspaperman 
asked.  "Then why didn't you
build one?"

"I want to get a little on hand before
these hoarders get busy," explained
a woman to the grocer when ordering
ten pounds of butter.
