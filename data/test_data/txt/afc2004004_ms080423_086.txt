Nellie:   And I won't have one at all if they like him!  (laughter)

AL:    Let's hear it!  What does "Little Bohee(??)" have to do with
all this now?

Nel:   I don't know exactly whether I know or not, but this fellow
was out by himself strolling around, and he met up with Little
Mohee(??), fell in love with her, and he had another girl back
home, so he. . . .When he got back home, he didn't like it and he went
back to her, and I reckon they lived happily ever after when he
got back.

Nel:    I'll try to sing it:   "As I went out walkin' for pleasure and 
dance, and sweet. . . ." . . . .
Woman:    . . . .little bitty girl.  She sung that ever since I can
remember, and that's been a long time, I ain't gonna tell how
long, it's been a long time!
Linda:   That's one of the first ones that I can remember singing.
Woman:    . . .and "Young M(?)". . .
Nellie:    I got hanged up in it first. some way or another, I don't
know how come I do that.
