Mr. Stephen W. Smith
Hot Record Society
303 Fifth Avenue
New York City

Dear Mr. Smith:

     The Music division is delighted to
accept the set of records issued by the
Hot Record Society for permanent deposit
in its phonogram collection.  It is hoped
that we shall be on your permanent mailing
list, so that this set can be kept complete 
and up-to-date, and that besides
that we receive the bulletin which
parallels the recordings.

     The records can be sent to the Library 
express collect, marked "Attention:  Mr.
Lomax," and in that way the shipping 
charges will be taken care of.

     May I take this opportunity to thank
you and the Hot Record Society in behalf of
the Library and the Music Division for this
significant addition to our phonogram
collection.

          Very sincerely yours,


AL a           Assistant in Charge of the
                       Archive of American Folksong
