in Clarksdale.  Its establishments are larger and more varied in their stocks
than in Cleveland.  Everything in Clarksdale is more highly developed than in
the smaller town.
     The Negro community in Clarksdale is much larger and has developed
more institutions than any found in Bolivar County.  The 5,000 Negroes in
Clarksdale are half of the total population.  There is a sizeable Negro owned
drug store, several cafes, two undertakers, and a small professional group of
lawyers, physicians, and dentists.  Churches of several denominations, but 
chiefly Baptist, are scattered about the Negro residential section.  There is
no high school in the town but one of the best in the state for Negroes has
been developed in the Coahoma Training School just outside of the town.
     The size of the owned units of land in these counties is suggested in a

contains 3,600 acres; the Brooks Plantation at Deeson has 4,434 acres.
There are numerous smaller ones of from 500 to 1,000 acres.  The largest plantation
in the state, and perhaps in the United States, is in this County.  The
Delta and Pine Lands Company, a great corporation owns 37,000 acres in the
county, with 15,350 of them located at Scott.  On this plantation alone are
approximately over 800 Negro tenant families.  The effective production of 
cotton requires large tracts of land, and large numbers of workers.  [end]

of these were Negroes.  The white population is of native stock, because this
type of area is inhospitable to foreign-born workers.  In spite of the scattered
settlement of traders in the towns, there were only 500 persons of
foreign or mixed parentage in the County.  Less than 5 per cent of the population
is classified as urban, and 79 per cent are farm dwellers.  The rest
