-2- Sara Ogan's "I Hate the Capitalist System"

She hates the system that killed her father.  She hates the
system that killed her husband.  She hates the system that killed
her little baby boy. .  [and the system that is going to kill her
two other children . . . and the doctor says Sara must die, also,
with the same old disease that all of them have died with, it is
a lung trouble called 'cilicosis' that you get when you breathe
the dust that comes from out of a coal mine . . . . . and] you don't
get enough wages for your work to buy the groceries and the house
and the clothes that you need every year.

But me . . . why do I write all of these things?  What has the
system done to me?  What gives me a right to hate the Rich Man's
Rule?

I'll tell you why/ . . . because it ran my mother crazy, and she
died in the insane asylum, and my 14 year old sister killed herself
because of it, and my father laid flat of his back in a bed for 18
months because he tried to kill himself --- and we lost $35,000
that we had saved for several years.  It made me a bum and a tramp,
and it made me a low down hobo, and it made me a stranger and a
vagrant every where I go ----- that's why I hate the rich mans rule,
because --- because I've spent a many a night and a many a day just
a setting and a listening to my wife a crying and my 2 little kids
a crying for something to eat --- out on the Texas plains, out in
the wheat country, out in the oil fields, out where the dust storms
has made a desert out of the lands, and folks are living like a 
brunch of rats in traps.

"I hate the Capitalist System".  You dam right I hate it . . . .
a world run by rich men, dictated as bad if not worse than any
other place in the world.  I hat it.  I despize it, the god dam
