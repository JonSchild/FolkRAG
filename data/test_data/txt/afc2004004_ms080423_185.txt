Tape:  Roll 41    Hicks    p.6

Looked like a log!   We went on then, on huntin' up towards the
East (?) and we got weak with walkin'.   And looked out, and
Jack says, "Ray, here is some ripe October. . .oh gosh, they is
meller(?)!"   And he got one of them, and said "Here we can eat
us some peaches."   And I reached to get one, and hell the tree
run through the wood!   Them peach seeds had come up in deer hide
bodies, peaches!   And so, we went home and got back in.   The last
time I seed Jack he laughed and he said, "Ray, have you seed those 
peach tress anymore, runnin' thru the woods?!"   Now I didn't know
a thing.  Now, as far I I know, Jack's a hunting yeast!
(laughter)

AL:     Couldn't beat that!
