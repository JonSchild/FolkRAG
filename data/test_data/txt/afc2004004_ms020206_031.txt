Reverend Roe.  Reel 4.  P. 1.
A: Well, what do you think is going to be the solution of it?
R: Well, you, know, I don't know. And yet we understand that God said,
"Whatsoever shall man sow, that also shall he reap." And every man
who has sowed are bound to reap what he has sown, because we believe
the word of God is true.
[*Family driven off the farm*] 
Well, after I left home, my father and one of the older sisters and
her family, they cultivated the land until Father died.
A: Did he have a title to it?
R: Oh yeah. It belonged to us. And after my father died, why, for
some cause they got uh-- mad with my sister and a group of white folks
went there and whipped her.
A: You don't know why they got mad? Didn't you ever hear why they 
got mad with her?
R: Naw sir, I don't know just what it was. I was in Texas.
A: And she never told you.
R: Oh well, she said she didn't know just why they treated her like
that, but she thought it was because they wanted the land.
A: What did they whip her with?
[Whites whip sister]
R: Ropes, I think. They tied her, and she had the ropes around her
arm and burnt her arm and legs were hurt, and she was hurt pretty
badly. And she had to take all of her children and leave, and she came
to Sherman to me, and I had to look after her until they got on their
feet. The boys are still up there, one of them, the other just sold
out and went to De-troit, Michigan -- he bought up there, recently.
[?] the white folks down there, if there was something they wanted,
why, they got it. They'd get it if they had to send a mob crowd on
you, and run you off and take it. And we knew if they wanted something,
if they keep on after us for it, they just had to get shut of it-- to
keep from having trouble. That was generally known down there.
