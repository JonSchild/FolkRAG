4. Cheyenne, Wyoming, August 6
"Thousands of dollars are being expended in the maintenance
of an office to direct sales of defense bonds and stamps which
might better be used for other war purposes. A great many
people who have signed pledges and are buying bonds and stamps,
later turn them in for cash. Some of them have a revolving
fund for this purpose which permits them to meet their pledge
but in the end requires only a very small investment." [*39*]
