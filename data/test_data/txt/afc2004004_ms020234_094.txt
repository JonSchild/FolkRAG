say from home?  You leave from, ah, down in St. Simons,
down in the bottom of Georgia, Florida, all down in there where I
lived there, I work I worked  through an' everything, worked very well,
good.  But when I come up aroun', ah, well, I say up around my
native home, Dawson, up in there.  I feel better.  Further up I
get?  The better I feel.  You know, see?  Because it's sumpin'
about it that do's me good.  An' there is some, ah, some people
can't stay in the South, period.  They cain't stay
there 'cause it's too warm for 'em.  An' I don't know what it is
'cause I have never tried -- I don't go to a doctor enough to
know whether's anything ailin' me or not.  But, uh, uh, I don't
know, but I was told this, 'way back, years ago.  Back in, back
in '26, that it's better fer me up.  Further up I go, the better it
is fer me.  I was told that, um-hum.
TL:  What for, Bessie?
BJ:  Just just better for my health, condition.  I wouldn't be near
as sickly; I wouldn't feel bad.  I, I told the children many
times in letters home, I haven't had a sick day like I have at
home.  I be workin' an' goin, feelin' bad.  Go in the house, I
feel bad.  Workin' an' doin' -- Git up, git up an' keep goin' ta
keep from givin' up an' lay down, feel bad.  But I haven't felt
sick since I lef' home.  You know, in that way.  An', an', so I
can jus' feel the stagolation (stagnation); up here, the circulation
of the air here; an' feel the staga -- feel the stagolation in the
air there.  Ya see?  I can feel that; I know that.  An' so tha's
a, just a diffrunt in it.
TL:  Is St. Simons good for you?
BJ:  No.
TL:  You don't feel healthy there?
