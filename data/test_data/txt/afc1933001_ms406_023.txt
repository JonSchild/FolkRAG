1936

     Once I asked The Revered Aaron Pinn{{??}} of Heavens Gate Church,
South Carolina, why he so deliberately attempted in his sermons to influence
his congregation to "shout." In the physical ecstasy his sermons
provoked I had seen young girls dive through the air and fall headlong
on the hard floor in defiance of bruised flesh and broken bones. The
men were more careful of bodily injuries, seemingly content to "hold" 
the riotous females temporarily under the influence of the words of
the minister.
     The Reverend Pinnoche, coal black, intelligent and frank, replied
without hesitation: "If I did not preach shoutin' sermons my congregation
would pay me nothing." Even in religious matters the economic
factor is dominant. We can't get away from it.
     Sinkiller Griffin, pastor to the three thousand or more Negro 
convicts in Texas, kept in mind always the attitude of his hearers.
Why shouldn't he? Their disfavor might cost him his job as a state
employee as pastor to the black convicts of Texas.
