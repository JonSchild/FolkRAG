Dear Alan -

Of course your father
expects you to be perfect even
on your first stab at your
programs. Even so, he was  proud
as a peacock as also were
Mrs. Sharp & I. We had box
seats for the performance in
the lovely Sharp living room.

We are making slow progress
getting the house in order, but by
Christmas it will be ready for all
of you, we are hoping that you
will have no meetings to keep you away.
Sorry you missed Ben - or did you?
She was looking? gorgeous when she
came through Dallas.

Bushels of love,

Deanie
