As freedom came nearer historically the slave sensed it probably through that great institution of theirs- the grapevine - and their hopes of freedom became more pronounced and their songs for freedom really became more triumphant or at least anticipating triumph and belief and the group are now going to sing together two of those the famous "Freedom, freedom over me before I be a slave and buried in my grave and go home to my master and be free", and "Perils on me" (?) -

The power of the spirituals moves more and more as they stand the test of time.  They have outlived the generation and the peculiar conditions that produced them they have survived in turn the contempt of slave owners and the cold conventionalization of formal religion and the artistic repressions of puritanism, cheap corruption of sentimental idolatry and neglect and disdain of second generation respectability and now the tawdry exploitation of tin-pan alley and our musical market places.  They escaped the lapsing conditions and fragile vehicle of folk art and come firmly under the protection of the skillful folklores a little late but not too late to capture some of their fading original beauty.  Only classics survive such things.  And now finally the quartet will give us their own cotemporary spirituals on the theme - a rather characteristic on - that every one has to die - that assertion of a democracy that must have meant so much to the Negro peasant in their own thin satisfactions in life - The quartet will close with "Travelling shoes" -
