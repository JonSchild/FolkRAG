Time Code:            Tape:   #896 cont. NImrod Workman    3

it's just now getting around to a lot of people. . . . . .well,
I think more so all over, not only in the mountains. At
one point, it was only inthe mountains, cause that's what
everybody grew up with, what they were singing, but now I
think it's all over. I think more people are doing traditional
music because it does tell a story, . . . . .

AL: Do you find it's popular where yougo?

Nimrod: Yes, I do. I'd say for the last ten years now, when
I was singingm they asked for this old timey [j]music, they
want to hear it, seem to like it better than they do the
new. They're going back to that. So many people, they say,
well that's new to me, but [t]hat's beautiful. They come at you
often and say will youdo that again for me? We want you
to come back again. They show their love for it and they
show that it's getting to them, and they're really liking it,
old timey singing and m[usi]c is coming back.

AL: What about here in the [mo]untains, is that true here too?

Nimrod: Yeah, in the mountains and everywhere else. In the
mountains they love it, they say, won'tyou do that over. Do
some of the old timey songs, like they'll request it, you know.

Phyllis: I find that a lot of people, like in the mountains,
are turned on to doing traditional music, even some of the
young ones who, 5 or 10 years ago, wouldn't even listen. Now
they're listnening and sayin[g] where did that come from, why
do you sing that, you know? A lot more younger people are
picking it up.
