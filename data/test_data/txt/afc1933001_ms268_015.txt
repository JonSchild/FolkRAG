3. To furnish all types of stringed instruments, making
them available in the barracks and in the folksong center.

4. To furnish instruction books for playing these instruments,
along with tunes and card diagrams to fit the
types of songs above discussed.

5. To furnish recordings by folksongs virtuosos playing on
these instruments to be used as instruction records by
the men.

6. There should be a center in camps for this type of
music as opposed and as contra-distinction to jazz
and other types of music played from written music
and with complicated arrangements. In these centers
should be found the song leaflets, instruments, instruction
books described above.

7. A sound recording machine should visit these camps
once a month to record the best programs by the men
and the songs they have themselves made up. These 
records could be reproduced and used, beneficially, to
circulate from one camp to another.
