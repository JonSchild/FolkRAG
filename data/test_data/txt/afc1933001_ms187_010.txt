Dear Mr. Lomax,
     Your letter came just about the time that we were making
preparations to get away from the Ranch to return to Chicago and in the
busy days that followed this answer has been delayed.
      We decided not to stay for the present at least for the
same reasons that affect us all now. We hope the future will bring forth
however some fruition of these things held in mind. I wrote to a Mrs.
Jean Brooks Lathrop of Casper whose family are old timers of Wyoming and
she said that any time you came to the State she would help in every way
possible. However to more present plans. As long as we will be in Chicago
this winter Ross would be glad to have some of his material recorded. We
will do whatever you arrange for.
     We too would like to enjoy some more evenings like the one
spent with you in Milwaukee. Is Pete in New York? He's a nice youngster.
     Are you going to be in Chicago for the Radio-Broadcast Convention?
I read where it is meeting in November, I believe. If so, I hope
we can see you
Thank you for your interest and cordiality,
     Yours sincerely,
Alice and Rose Whitmire
