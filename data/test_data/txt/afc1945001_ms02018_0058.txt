Report on Rumors - 8

War Information
1.  I was glad that the Government came out and told us we could 
lose the war if we didn't get enough supplies to the Army and Navy.  It'll 
make us all work harder.  (Middle-aged social worker.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.)
2.  I heard that several hundred American soldiers were killed 
during a German air raid on the British Isles, which has never been reported 
to the public in the United States.  (Truck driver for wholesale company.  
Prescott, 8-11-42.)
3.  That Government announcement that we could lose the war if we 
don't supply our men means we've got to get busy.  The United States is 
not producing enough materials to put the Army and Navy on the offensive.  
(Unknown, retired individual at Library Park.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.)
4.  If the Government could have gotten it over to the country sooner 
that we could lose the war, the American Government would have been months 
ahead in its war preparations.  (Man on the street, employed.  Phoenix, 
8-12-42.)
