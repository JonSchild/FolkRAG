I'm Labor (continued)

I swarm and toil and fight and die,
But capital takes the risks, not I,
I'm labor. (He's labor.)

V. I've no ambition, I'm labor,
As politician, I'm labor.
I follow still the good old plan,
I'm a Democrat or Republican,
But a Socialist is a bogeyman,
I'm labor. (He's labor.)
I'm strong as a steer, I'm labor;
But weak up here, I'm labor.
I always vote for friends you see,
With friends like Frank or Al agree,
But will I ever vote for me?
I'm labor. (He's labor.)

VI. At last I'm waking, I'm labor
My chains, I'm breaking, I'm labor.
Too long I've waited for this hour,
No more to wealth and name I'll cower,
But rise, unite and use my power,
I'm labor. (He's labor)
I'm done with hoping, I'm labor,
With waiting, groping, I'm labor.
I'll put to work the boss and drone,
No more they'll reap what I have sown.
I'll come at last into my own,
I'm labor. (He's labor.)

POOR MR. MORGAN
(3-Part Round)

Words and Music by L.E.Swift
From ("Songs of the People," p.51)

I                                                                                          II
Poor Mis-ter Mor-gan can-not pay his in-come tax; Pity-y poor Mor-gan;

                             III
he can-not pay. He's dead broke, he has-n't got a cent.

WAGE AND HOUR BILL SONG
(Tune: "The Merry Go Round Broke Down")

Adapted from a parody in "The Builder,"
(publication of the ACWA, Nashville, Tenn)
by students at Southern Summer School
for Workers, Asheville, N.C., 1938.

Oh, the C.I.O. goes round
Building a union town
And the bosses there
Must learn to be fair
Cause the C.I.O.'s in town.

Oh, the Wage and Hour Bill's hero
To the Company's despair
All we want is a union shop
So the chiselling will stop.

Oh, what fun, a wonderful time
When the company toes the line!

WWe met the other night
At a hearing in our fight,
The bosses balked,
But the workers talked;
And things turned out all right.
