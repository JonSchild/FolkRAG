Note
The songs recorded at the home of Segundo Dolabaille at Lopinot between 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. The musicians also took part in the singing. The tunes are mostly galeron, aguinaldo, and warrap - songs used by the Spanish folk for parangs and serenades on holidays, Saturday night parties. The song session was casual and was organised in the usual customary way, i.e. one musician begins to sing and play the cuatro, his neighbours joining him to drink liquor and assist in the singing without any formal invitation so to do.
