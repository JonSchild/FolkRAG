Tape 25 A...Description of Waulking, etc....Mary Gillis etc...
Interviewed and recorded by Alan Lomax.
Lomax: And how long would they go on in one of these rounds --
I mean would it be two hours or ....?
Mary Gillis: An hour.
Lomax: And they'd be quite tired after that?
Mary Gillis: Quite tired.
Lomax: And then they would stop and rest for toast and tea?
Mary Gillis: Have tea, yes.  It had to be thick, you know.  Thick, it
would have good wear out of it.  And it wasn't an easy thing...I've
got very bad English.
Annie Johnson: He enjoys you telling him!
Mary Gillis: He's laughing at me.
Annie Johnson: No, no he's not.  You tell it in your own way.
Mary MacLoud: Well, there are three different kinds of waulking
altogether -- Clomore, Cocoran, and Harris tweed.
Mary Gillis: Harris tweed -- what the harris tweed! Nothing like!
You know what to do with it! Oh, it wasn't harris tweed! A pity
we hadn't a bit of it -- what my mother had made.
Mrs Sandy MacNeil: Yes, like my mother used to make.
Mary McLoud: ....Three sets of waulking women before they would
get it to the measure they wanted...with the shrinking.
Lomax: So it was really heavy cloth, that.  It was difficult to do that.
Mary McLoud: Oh, yes, and especially the Clamore, because there were
so many different vegetable dyes in it, and it was a very, very heavy
tweed.
Lomax: At this waulking would they have plenty to eat and plenty to drink.
All: Oh yes ---- no drink! No drink at all.
Mary Gillis: Where would we manage to get a drink from? (LAUGHTER.)
