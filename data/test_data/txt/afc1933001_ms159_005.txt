Dear Alan:
Your letter of June 25 was forwarded to me in New York as I was
there from June 28 through July 3.
I questioned everyone and made a search for myself for Woody's
manuscript which you said you left in the studio on the morning
on which you recorded. I was unable to find any trace of it
whatsoever. I do hope it has turned up elsewhere.
Upon my return this morning, I had a conversation with Mr.
Darnell. He is sending to your father a new contract, offering
him a cent a record covering all twelve songs made by
Leadbelly and the Golden Gate boys.
I hope to have the recordings complete this week and will
send a set of them to you.
Best wishes,
R.P. Wetherald
