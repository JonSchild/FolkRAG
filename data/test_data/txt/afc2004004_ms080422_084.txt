AL: (to Mrs. Workman) How was it that you were in the 
Holiness Church.
Mrs. W: That's the way I was brought up, that's the way I 
believe and that's the way my bible tells me.
AL: Is that they way you were raised.
Mrs. W.: Yes, but it's plain in the Bible, so I know it's the 
right way for me.
AL: You joined the Holiness church when you were grown up?
Mrs. W: No, I joined when I was a small kid. So, I"m a 
Holiness from the top of my head to the sole of my foot.
AL: You believe in getting happy and shouting?
Mrs. W: Yeah, I sure do, if the Lord puts it on you to get 
happy and shout, you better do it. I really believe it.... 
It sure do, it really do. If it wasn't for the good lord, we 
wouldn't have anything. He gives us everything we need and 
the air we breathe. He gives us every bite we eat, and he 
keeps us, if we serve him, he'll come to our rescue.
AL: What's your favorite holiness song, one you may have 
heard when you were a little girl.
Mrs. W: Well, I like them all..... well, my uncle, when I was 
a real small kid, he'd sing Goin' back with Jesus, he was a 
preacher, and everytime he'd be in church or going to a
prayer meeting, he'd sing Goin' Back to Jesus When He Comes.... 
well, I could sing a little of it, I was a small kid.... 
(she sings)
