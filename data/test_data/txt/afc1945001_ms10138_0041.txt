This war is one which is unnecessary for free-loving
people. Their soul is one which wants peace and
happiness that are dire to them, and the sooner this
horrible war is over the better off peaceful loving
people are going to be.

Nursing is of great importance and though some
people say it isn’t I know it is and nothing
can change my attitude. Ever since I can remember
I’ve wanted to be a nurse, but being in the 
10th grade, being a ender age hasn’t helped me any.
And now I’m going to be a nurse’s aid, helping
the sick and well as well, and comfort those 
who mourn for their loved ones. This is my ambition!!!

The people of Germany, Japan, Italy I think want
some day for this war to be over so they can
have their loved ones back. No matter how bad a 
person is you can always find somewhere a 
streak of decency and self-respect in him. May 
God have mercy upon the souls of the wretches 
who are cold hearted enough to plant such a 
war of mourning and hatred.
