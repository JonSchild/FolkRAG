producer. Tenants themselves have no credit standing in the community; 
landlords merely allow them to share their credit on occasions.

For the mass of tenants, as a rule, landlords make a definite 
allowance of cash or credit monthly during the five months regarded as the 
season of crop production. From the first of February to the end of August, 
according to the size of family, or at times according to the amount of 
land under cultivation, tenant families receive from a minimum of $5.00 to 
a maximum of $15.00 monthly. [*]*]

Since 1930 landowners have not had sufficient cash to make 
"furnishing" convenient. As economic pressure has increased individual 
landowners have reduced the size of the allowance made to tenants, and in 
1933 some of them stopped the allowance entirely. The end of a practice 
regarded by many economic observers as detrimental to the tenants' interests, was however, not at all welcomed by the tenants. Whenever possible, when "furnishing" ceased, they withdraw from the farm and sought another, or went to town.

It is a practice among these smaller and hard pressed landlords, 
when they consider a tenant insufficiently productive, to dispossess him of 
tools, livestock and produce, and thus force him off the farm. This is called 
by tenants "breaking up." Those who desire a change in landlords must also 
relinquish all their possessions, - upon which the landlords in many cases hold mortgages. This practice has served to keep mobility among tenants lower than 
it would be under different circumstances. When the effects of the general 
depression began to be registered increasing numbers of tenants were dispossessed.

In some instances where tenants were dispossessed they were not required 
to vacate houses if they could pay rent for them. If there are debts 
to the landlord, in many cases he takes the proceeds of the last crop produced. 
How the tenant is to provide for his family afterwards is considered 
the tenant's problem. In some other situations the landlords have dispossessed
