Committee on Counterpropaganda, Chicago OCD
University of Illinois
College of Medicine

Chicago, Illinois

Dear Dr. Kraines:

                Recently you sent a copy of the report of the
Committee on Counterpropaganda to Mr. Davis.  This report
has been referred to our office because rumor study,  at
the present time,   is centralized here. 

                We are very glad to get your Committee's analyses 
of the causes of rumors and methods of combating
rumors.  In the very near future,  an official  OWI statement 
on the problem can be expected,  together with materials 
prepared for rumor control projects designed for
group somewhat less sophisticated than yours.

                As soon as this material is ready,  I shall send
copies of it to you and should like very much to keep in
touch with your work.


                                                   Very truly yours,

                                                    Eugene Katz
                                                    Chief,  Special Services Division
