22

When friends and relations forsake me,
And troubles roll 'round me so high,
I think of the kind words of Jesus,
Poor pilgrim, I am always nigh.     Cho.

I soon shall reach the bright glory,
Where mortals no more complain,
The old ship is approaching,
The captain is calling my name.    Cho.

Hark! what is that I see coming?
My heart's blood is running cold or slow,
But Jesus can quiet the Jordan,
And pilot me through as I go.

I'M GOING HOME

My heavenly home is bright and fair,
No pain nor death can enter there;
It's glittering towers the sun outshines;
That heavenly mansion shall be mine.

CHORUS:

I'm going home, I'm going home,
I'm going home, to die no more.
To die no more, to die no more,
I'm going home, to die no more.

My father's house is built on high,
Far, far above the starry sky ;
When from this earthly prison free,
That heavenly mansion mine shall be.

Let others seek a home below,
Which flames devour or floods o'erflow,
Be mine the happier lot to own,
A heavenly mansion near the throne.
