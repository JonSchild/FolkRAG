the devil may be said to have taken possession
of the earth. It continues day and night
through Vendredi St. until Christ is well
risen to protect poor shivering men from 
evil until the devil is finally beaten.
The [majors] officials are officials of a real
army setting out with masques and the
rest of the usual primitive paraphanalia
to beat the devil. The majors dance [their]
make their tin jcus flash in the air like
so many spears, showing all the world how
agile and how ready to fight the devil 
they are.
Of course the whole thing may be colored by 
the notion of the rejuvenation of the earth
by the king that dies and is brought to 
life again. The only person I have asked
says simply that rara is in honor of
Bon dieu.
Another person I asked this morning said
that the rara bands are interested in making
the jews run away. The majors with their
batons are prepared to beat them.
