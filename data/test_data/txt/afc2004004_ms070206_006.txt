Autumn ring down your rain
Now is the revolution of the year
The pear tree baffles the astounding wind
And drops its scarlet banners on my hair

Over the path the leaves lie loose
Lost pages of an old prophetic book
Sightless and mindless now but somehow dear
They too shall be purged with the dew and the wild
tongued brook. 

Naked te child leaps bloody into life
Blind as a worm, the ugliest of his clan
His mother ies bent and shaken as the tree
And thanks kind nature for her thankless son. 

And the prince of war rid s in the fall meadow
As the autumn reddens into a bloody stain
Young men are fallen there marred and broken
And red wounds blossom where the bullets rain. 

Red is for October and Revolution
And d ad men's hand lie loose as leaves in the wood
Here are summons clearer than flags or slogans
The year runs out it is time they were understood. 

Autumn ring down your rain
A wolrd is dying and I cannot grieve
A child will leap up from his father's bones
And learn to dance among the crimson leaves.
