Labor has the government just where it wants it.  Why, if wages have a ceiling
placed on them, you'll see the biggest walk-out in history -- and there
goes your war production all to hell.  Milwaukee, August 4.

"Somebody sure is getting rich out of this war, and you know who I mean."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah, it costs $50 to join the union, and you can't get a job unless you
join because the union does all the hiring."  Milwaukee, August 5

THE WAR

A lot of this second front talk is being fomented in England by German propagandists
to divide the United Nations.  Milwaukee, August 3

There's no need for a second front -- I mean fighting front.  Our planes can
batter Germany, knock out its supply lines and bases, and save a lot lives.
That's what the Allies have in mind by not barging onto the continent.
Milwaukee, August 4

We're producing 4,000 planes a month.  Why not send 'em all to England and
blast Hitler off the map.  Milwaukee, August 5

Why don't they start sending stuff to Russia?  They can't hold out forever
alone.  Milwaukee, August 5

Japan talked them right out of any more bombings.  They told Drew they'd
cut off food for Americans in concentration camps -- and no more bombings.
We're certainly getting places when those yellow --- ---- can put it over on
us like that.  Milwaukee, August 5

If we don't set up a second front soon, Russia's going to fold up.  And
that'll either mean the war, or drag it on another two or three years.
Milwaukee, August 6

The Russians are losing -- and we're just sitting over here, watching them
catch hell, without raising a finger.  Milwaukee, August 8

Russia will soon sign a separate peace.  Milwaukee, August 8

We're losing the war, and won't start winning until we obtain enough equipment
and trained men.  Milwaukee, August 8

We can't expect to win the war by furnishing our men with pop guns and water
pistols.  Milwaukee, August 8

Nothing is being done about the Aleutians.  Milwaukee, August 6

Instead of talking about it, and sending congressmen to investigate, why
don't they get the Japs off the Aleutians.  Milwaukee, August 7
