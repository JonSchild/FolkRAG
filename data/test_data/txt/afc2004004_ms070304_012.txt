   Next day - rather fruitless.
Recorded Malrosh. Recorded little
Rona McDonald. Recorded Duncan 
& son & McPhee my landord in
some speech. After buying & being
bought lots of drinks made a 
good exit & slept drunkenly while
the little steamer rolled in the
cold wind toward Barra.
   Staying with Mary Gillis where
Ennis & Calum boarded. Ennis
was finest man she ever met
& she talks about him so much I was
a bit miffed.
   Gillis made fine speech this
morning about passing of old 
days. Off now to see Annie
Johnstone. -
   This is Tuesday June 23rd & I've been in
the British Isles 6 months. At 
this rate I'll be 70 before I get to R.
