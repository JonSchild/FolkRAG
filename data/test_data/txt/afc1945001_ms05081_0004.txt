"There was an announcement in the newspapers by Germany that they had
sunk 30 ships in an American convoy to Murmansk.  I have watched the
news items closely and our government has never denied this sinking.
I believe that the greater portion of everything we ship is being sunk."
(Professional man, August 7th, 1942, Birmingham, Alabama.)  [*1*]
