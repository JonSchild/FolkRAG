Whoa, back, Buck, an' gee, by de Lamb!

L.B. Speaks: This man was drivin' twenty yokes o' oxen.# He was a long
ways from home. An' it was slow drizzlin' rain an' de man
was cold. He was a long ways f'om home an' he was tryin' 
to git his oxens to hurry up a little faster. An' you know
'bout how much speed an oxen has got. 'Stead o' the oxen
gittin' faster, they was speedin' up slower. Ev'y once
in a while he'd look at 'em an' he'd cut down, "Ti-yow!"*
"Yay! back up there! Gee! Buck, whoa!"

L.B. Sings: Whoa, back, Buck, an' gee, by de Lamb,
Who made de back-band?
Whoa, God-damn.

Tom done bucked** an' Bill won' pull,
Papa gotta cut dat uddah lil' bull.
Whoa, back, Buck, an' gee, by de lamb,
Who made de back-band?
Whoa, God-damn.

L.B. Speaks: He begin to think about his wife, eighteen, nineteen,
twenty years ago befo' he married her. He look 'way down de 
road, seem like he could see her.

L.B. Sings: Whoa, back, Buck, an' gee, by de Lamb!

Shirley, write out refrain
twice here*]

Eighteen, nineteen, twenty years ago,
I taken Sal to de partyo,
I taken Sal to de partyo,
Wouldn' let her dance but a set or so.

** Back-band. Oxen wear no back-band. It
is a strap slung over the backs of mules and horses when they
are harnessed, serving to hold up the trace chains.

# L.B. for dramatic purposes, exaggerates a little. No 
one man, at least, ever drove twenty yoke of oxen.

* A splendid sound, descriptive of the crack of 
the whip over the horns of the lead oxen,
an ox-whip with a a stout six or eight foot stock of pecan or
hickory and twenty feet of plaited leather, or single
strips of rawhide pieced together.

** "Buck," probably balked
