A British bombing force made a raid over Germany 
one night. The following day the British newspapers 
carried headlines claiming that three German 
oil tanks were hit and set afire. The same 
day the German newspapers appeared with an 
account of the same bombing. However, the report 
of these papers was that there was no damage of any 
military consequence, but that three cows had been 
injured by the bombings. Three days later a 
Danish newspaper reported that a bombing
expedidition from England or Gt. Britain had raided 
Germany three days previously, that three cows 
had been hit and were still burning. 

28 German fliers were killed one day in combat 
and the next day appeared before the gates of St. Peter. 
They knocked on the door, demanding admittance. 
St. Peter came to the gate and asked them what they 
wanted. They said that "seeing as how" we are all 
good Nazi fliers they desired admission to heaven. 
St. Peter said they would have to wait a minute, he 
would have to check with the books, first. He 
departed- Soon he returned, and he said he was 
sorry but he could only admit 3 German aviators.
