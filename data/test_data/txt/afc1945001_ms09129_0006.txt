(Joke)
A sailor in one of the southern camps
approached his superior officer with a
grim face. "Sir," he said, "I'd like a seven
day leave." The officer said, "sorry no leaves
until your training is up." The sailor
angrier than ever pulled a knife from
his pocket. "Sir, I got a Mother above 
a father below and a girl in Baltimore
and I'm goin to see one to night.
(Joke)
A colored guard, guarding a defense 
plant was very tired. He was jus about to go 
off duty, when he heard a sound. "Who goes
there," he said. A voice answered, "Officer
of the day." "Who goes there," the guard said, 
again. Officer of the day, the voice said, 
irritatedly. Don't you know who I am. 
I'm not supposed to said the guard. I'm
supposed to say, Who goes there three times
and shoot. And I've said it three times.
