Dear Mrs. Tartt:

Mr. John A. Lomax has called my attention to the valuable
aid which you rendered him in recording folk-songs for our
Archive. These records constitute a most important addition 
to our collection and I want to thank you for your kind assistance,
and express our deepest appreciation for your cooperation.

Very sincerely yours,

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
