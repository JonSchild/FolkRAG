Dear Professor Thompson:

I regret exceedingly that it will not be possible for me to be in Goshen next week. Our vacation begins tomorrow, April 8, and ends April 18. The time between the 8th and the 18th is not my own. I am doing some research in Mennonite history in Ohio during that period. My itinerary has been planned and the questionaire already sent out so that to change my plans now would mean inconveniencing a score or more of interested people whom I cannot afford to offend. 

I hope that it will be possible to see your Mr. Lomax at some future time. Or it might be that if he makes the necessary contacts, he would be able to to the recording in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. It would not be so far from Washington.

Very cordially,
John Umble
