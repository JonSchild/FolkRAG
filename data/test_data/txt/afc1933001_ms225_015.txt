Dear Alan: I have asked Mrs
Witt to help you with the Waco
woman. Miss Terrill will see
Mrs. Smith here. The best that either
can do is to send you the
written-out notes for the melodies.
I am returning the original letters
now and herewith.
I've just collected $50 from
Columbia (boosted by me from an
offer of $25) for using one time
on the radio (March 10) I'm Almost
Done and The Rock Island
Line. I'm crediting you and Mrs
Seeger for your one third.
