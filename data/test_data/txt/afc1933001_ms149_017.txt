Dear Mr. Wetherald:
Too many people seem to have been on their vacations
the last two weeks. I understood that Father had written
you and received an answer in Niagra Falls where he last
was. He wrote me that in reply to your original offer he
had made a counter-reply and was prepared to stand firm
on that ground. Did you ever receive a letter from him asking two
cents a record for editing the albums? If not, I suggest 
that you write him again at 1618 Avenue Y, Lubbosk, Texas.
I did not know where he was myself for nearly ten days and
he did not stop in Washington on his way to Texas.
It has occurred to me that one possible effect of the
albums of reissued records that we discussed might be to
legitimize, further recording of this sort in the eyes of
the Union. By the time you have come to some understanding
with Mr. Walker and the company I shall have made further
progress in my study of material already in the Archive. The
Columbia Broadcasting System has no objection to my recording
and working with Victor, and as soon as it is convenient
I will be happy to consider whatever offers you may care to
make. It will be six weeks, however, before I will have any time
outside of the work I have already on my schedule.
With very best regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax, Asst. in charge of
