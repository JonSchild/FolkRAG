Rev. Milton W. Keeling -2- September 26, 1961
These songs will be copyrighted in the name of the group by
Lochrae Music Corporation, 485 Madison Avenue, New York, New
York, and later on a publisher's contract will be sent to you
and you will receive whatever song royalties accrue directly
from them. Meantime, please supply me the names of the composers
or arrangers of each number.
Attached is a check for $15.00 to cover the check that was 
returned. Please send me that check at your earliest convenience.
I regret that you were caused this worry and delay.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
