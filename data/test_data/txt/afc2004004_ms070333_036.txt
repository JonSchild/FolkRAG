when I stop and think about
it all, I know I was wrong. So 
[y] will you please forgive me?
I'm very sorry.
After you left Saturday I went
to bed just thinking about you.
Wondering how you arrived at 
Washington, and have been waiting
Patiently for a card, but none. Poor
me dissappointed again.
Are you really coming
back in three weeks? I hope
so for I'll be a better girl
the next time really.
Well, how did those pictures
turn out?
