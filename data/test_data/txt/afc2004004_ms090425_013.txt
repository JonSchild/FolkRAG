Hester Jones -- I know the Lord fixed a way for
me. Alligator lake about 7 years ago. The first
one I heard sing it was Rev. Thomas. It's an
old song-I been knowin about 6 or 7 years.
Not as old as the others. Aw-no sir.
1) I know the Lord will fix a way for me
If you live the holy life
And do what the Lord say do
(.)
2. He's gone to fix, etc.
