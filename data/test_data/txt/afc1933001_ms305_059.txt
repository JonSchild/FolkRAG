Mr. Alan Lomax,
c/o Columbia Broadcasting System,
485 Madison Avenue,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Sir:-

I am enclosing herewith a
clipping from the French newspaper "La Presse"
on your recent visit to Montreal for the
American School of The Air presentation.

I hope you will like the
article about Mr. McGill and yourself, and I
trust your brief stay in Montreal, last week, was
a pleasant one.  So here's hoping we may see
you again this side of the border, in the
near future.

Yours sincerely,
Paul Gélinas
Publicity Department.
