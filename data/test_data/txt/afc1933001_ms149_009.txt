Dear Alan,

In a talk with Dr. Rainey, President of the University of 
Texas, I learned that the University would like to start a
collection of records of Texas folksongs. If we could get
permission of the University of Iowa to duplicate the
records, could we at the same time make duplicates for
Texas? If so, what would be the cost per record? I believe
you said you would make a set of duplicates for
Iowa for the privilege of duplicating. Is that true? Also,
would it be possible for Texas to get duplicates of the
records in the Library of Congress? What would be the cost
per record on those? Dr. Rainey wants price quotations
right away, so I'll appreciate an early reply.

I have been too busy getting settled down to write to Iowa
for permission to duplicate the records, but I shall do so
today.

Sincerely yours,
W.A. Owens
