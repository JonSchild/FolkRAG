Dear Dr Lomax,

Your letter to me was delayed owing to having been
sent to the wrong address. I replied to you at CIAP as soon
as I got it only yo be told that you had gone away and left no
forwarding address.

In my letter I told you thay I could easily supply
the Scottish Gaelic folksongs for the slowplaying series,
as I have made over 350 wire recordings of such songs; subject of
course to suitable conditions, including the consent of the singers.
I also said that the only other archive of this kind was in the
charge of Professor McIntosh of the Linguistic Survey of Scotland
and I would consult him about suitable material there.

I may add that only a short time ago the Linguaphone
Institute published for the Folklore Institute of Scotland a set
of 5 12 inch discs of authentic Gaelic folksongs with a book of
words and translation made by myself. Perhaps you have not heard
of this.

Yours sincerely,
