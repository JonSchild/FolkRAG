they sing with me and they can sing a few songs now. They're 
3 and 2 and they can't read or write or anything like that, they 
can't read the songs so I just have to do it with them by heart. 
I pick out the easy ones that I like a lot, so that they can 
sing with me when I lead. I have lead, and that's nice. I 
like the feeling up there. (She sings some of "Go Preachers")
