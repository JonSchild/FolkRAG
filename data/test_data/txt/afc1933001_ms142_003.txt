Mr. Alan Lomax
562 West 148th Street
New York City

Dear Alan:

No doubt you are "champing at the bit" because your tuition money has not arrived. the reason for this is that Dr Putnam is not in his office and will not be there until Saturday. Rest assured that we will get his section on the matter as soon as possible.

Best wishes for a successful semester.

Sincerely, 

ENW
mr
