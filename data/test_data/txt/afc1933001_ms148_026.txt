INSTRUCTIONS FOR TYPING DIVISION REPORTS
Please read carefully and follow closely.

The entire report should be double-spaced - nothing single-spaced
(except two or three lines at the bottom of a page when necessary in order
to avoid breaking a paragraph, as explained below).

Leave ample margins -- at least an inch and a quarter on each side.
In general, avoid breaking a word at the end of a line. (A ragged right
margin is of no importance.)

Do not use a pale typewriter ribbon or worn carbon paper.

At the top of the first page of the report proper, type the heading
as printed in last year's annual report.

Number the pages of the report proper (exclusive of any covering
sheet or letter of transmittal) consecutively from 1 up, in the lower
right-hand corner. Omit any running title.

As far as reasonably possible, end each page on a paragraph break,
regardless of the blank spaces that result. This is important.

Tabular material, lists to be printed in columns and matter to be
set in smaller type (except footnotes, as explained later) should be typed
on sheets separate from the preceding and following text matter (regardless
of the blank spaces that result) but numbered continuously with the rest of
the report.

A footnote applying to text matter should be typed on the line
immediately following the word to which it is appended. Leave an extra
space above and below the footnote and number the footnotes consecutively
from 1 up.

If a footnote occurs more than once on the same page, it should
be typed only in the first instance and the same reference number used
throughout that page.

The footnotes attached to a table should be grouped immediately
after the table and numbered from 1 up, separately for each table.

In comparative tables, the figures for the latest year should,
whenever possible, be given first, followed by those for preceding years.

Whenever a hanging indention was used in the 1938 printed report, similar 
material in this year's report should be typed in like manner. (This
paragraph is a specimen of a hanging indention.)

Except as otherwise here specified, the 1938 annual report (supple-
mented, when necessary, by Webster's dictionary) should be followed as to 
spelling, punctuation, compound words, capitalization and abbreviations.
