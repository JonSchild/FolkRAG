books were few. The nearest Railroad fifty miles away. [N??] Neighbors lived miles apart. Then we were thrown on our resources for much of our entertainment. On the long winter nights the family gathered around the big, open fireplace burning a large live oak backlog, flanked by four sticks of cedar.  Then often we sang and told stories. My older sister Mary and my mother had brought from Mississippi and Alabama [?] of tales and folk tunes. "Billy Boy" always seemed to me young and defenseless and stupid.

When he went down the lane
To see Miss Betsy Jane
The shriveled and lanky old maid
who was yet "too young to leave her
[momy] mommy." My sister knew 
many stanzas of that song. She 
taught us to
Whistle and hoe, sing as you go,
Shorten the rows by the songs you know.
I remember the song [we] I used to
help me pull he dosher up and 
down through the long, slender barrel 
of the old-fashioned churn.
It fitted precisely into the rhythm
of the work.

Come, butter, come; Come, butter, come.
For old aunt Kate
Is wait'in' at the gate
with a hot Johnny-cake
Come, butter, come; Come, butter, come.
