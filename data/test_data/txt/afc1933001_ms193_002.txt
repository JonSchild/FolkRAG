Dear Ben,          
  
Have youdropped through a hole in the Washington 
ice or have you given up the id  a of coming to New York or what? 
Let us hear--- a post card from such a busy man to such busy 
folks... News with us is that the baby is a charmer and married 
life is really wonderful...
    
You can do me a couple of kindnesses.
1) Send me all the Jelly Roll material. It's in a couple
of binders, maybe in a box, consists of typewritten transcripts and 
lots of pencilled notes of mine. I'll type out the pencilled notes 
and send the Library a copy eventually. I'm beginning to want to 
do something with that material now.
    
2) Look around and see if you can't find bound sets of 
my School of the Air and Back Where I Come from scripts for CBS. 
I'm starting a folk song series for the army and I need these scripts 
constantly in this job. The sets on your shelves belong to me,--- 
when I left themt there I just didn't have any place to put them....
    
Give my kindest regards to Mary and Ed and [Wak] Dick and 
Harold and your wife and your children and all the people in 
the Library that I used to know.

Yours,
Alan
