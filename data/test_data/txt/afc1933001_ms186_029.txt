Reception to the program in Virginia
was good everywhere. Of course, we know
an Army Camp would require a
different kind of presentation than that used
for The Department of English at a University.
We have already sorted out the songs
Horton knows which would go over best,
as far as we can judge, - and there are
a half dozen tall tales (mostly non-Jack)
which would be sure-fire.
If you could suggest leads toward even
one "try-out" in one camp - say, in Virginia -
I would appreciate it. - I have written
again to H Spivacke.

This attempt "to serve" means much
to both of us. Do let me know whatever
you can discover in this regard.

Yrs ever
