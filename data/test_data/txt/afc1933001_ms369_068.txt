head and went off home. Lamb for dinner at Bouki's house.
The next morning early Bouki was groveling
at the Forvilice door. "What did he want?" "His
bird!" "But the little bird was gone. The gift had
been repaid." "The bird, the bird, my particular
little bird," Bouki insisted. By afternoon he
was marching home with another fat Forvilice
lamb on his head
Madame Forvilice heard a strange cock crowing
before dawn the next day. It was Bouki (??)
another lamb and he finally got it. (but was told 
that if he came again) But he still didn't have
his (little) bird, his precious little bird. To
assuage his injured feelings he found a 
hole in the corner of the sheep fold and through
it dragged lambs, ewes, rams and all in the course
of the following days.
At last there was only one old ram left 
in the Forvilice pen.  Mister Lion came to
him and said, "I don't like to see that 
thief, Bouki, eat you all. You let me wait
here in your place."
