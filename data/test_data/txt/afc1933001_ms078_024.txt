Ammicable Building
c/o E. E. Witt
Waco, Texas

Dear Mrs. Witt:

    Alan is coming to Texas to appear on the State
Folk Lore Society's Program in San Antonio the first week
in May. He'd like to stop and give one of his concerts at
Waco, either before or after, the Waco meeting. If you
have the time or the inclination to interest yourself in
finding a date for him, talk with Mrs. McCluskey. I certain-
ly am in no position at present to ask any favors of you. In
the old days you did enough for me to put me in your debt for
life.

    I wrote to Edgar the other day that his shabby dis-
regard of the fact that I'd moved back to Dallas and urged him
to let me know when he would return, and his utter disregard
to pay any attention to me whatever, had brought on a certain
amount of resentment in my nature towards him. I don't know
when I'm going to get over it.

    With kindest regards I am always,
    Sincerely yours,
    John A. Lomax
