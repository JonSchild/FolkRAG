job far better than I could if I were
well. And they'd rather have you.

Meanwhile, assuming that I'll
venture the journey, please write
out answers to the following queries.

1. Approximate total of recorded
songs in the Archive.
2. When will the catalogue be ready?
3. The story of the financing of the
radio research dept.
4. Plans for the development of
the archive.

And anything else that might 
interest a group who knows
nothing whatever about the Archive.
I did hope (and continue faintly
to hope) that you would send me
a copy of your address on the
Archive before the South Eastern group.
I finally found copies of my
reports to the Music Division.
Lovingly, Father.
