Fisk, 7. 7. HAFFER.
was before I was converted. A judge killed a fellow, and I wrote. 
I didn't print that; I just composed that.

I'LL BE GLAD TO SEE THE SON

I'll be glad to see the Son
When He comes;
I'll be gald to see the Son
When He comes.
I'll be glad to see the Lord,
To get my just reward,
I'll be glad to see the Son
When He comes.

All the Gospel of the Kingdom
Must be preached at God's command.
The methods [was] be declared
From door to door.
His chosen people gather about Him
And placed in their own land,
And they never [subjec] will be subject no mo.

I'll be glad, etc.
