Reverend Roe.  Reel 8.  P. 6
When you get without a preacher, the next thing is you must get a 
preacher.  [Maybe, you know] You may be able to have ministers come in and do the 
preaching and get along for a while, but not long.  You've got to 
[*Preacher must rule the church.*]
have a preacher.  The Lord so fixed it.  He put the preacher here 
before the church was fully organized.  He prepared the preacher, and then 
He turned the church over into the hands of the minister.  [That he did] Where he left 
for us to carry on.  and that's God's plan, and no other plan will ever 
work well in God's [choice] church saving his's.  Therefore, no man will ever 
be able to lead the Church of God but a God-called minister.  They 
might knock along for a while, and [?] preachers come [now] in and out and 
preach, and in a way, he is kinda leading [them] it there because without a 
preacher you [wouldn't] won't have [no] any congregation.  It takes a minister, 
matter not whether he can preach well or not.  They just can't do without 
one.
