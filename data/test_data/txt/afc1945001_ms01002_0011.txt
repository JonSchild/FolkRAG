Dear George:

Things here have not developed very much since I last talked to you yesterday, but there are a few points which I would like to have clearly in mind before I approach the Crimson in an effort to set up a committee for rumor collection. /First of all, what sort of an agreement did you come to with Gavin. Will he give publicity to this committee so that letters recounting current rumors will be sent in to this student group. Unless such is the case, I see no great point in establishing this group unless (1) you are interested only in the rumors which the committee themselves may encounter or (2) you have some other means of publicizing the interests of the student group. Now when this point is cleared up, I will be glad to get in touch with the Crimson editor or any other proper persons, and see that some sort of an organization is set up.

The second thing is the manner in which the rumors will be sent on to you. You mentioned a form which Kris has been using. Unfortunately, I do not have the notes I took from your description. May I suggest that, providing you have an understanding with Gavin regarding the student organization, you send on to me the form which you wish to use, with complete explanations. This I can in turn pass on to the chairman of the committee who will follow it in all communication to you.

Let me know as soon as possible what is the set up and I shall proceed accordingly.

Yours

/s/ Bob
