R-82 cont.

dogs and drove about 5 milesdown to what we call Talbert's
walk, on the creek. We let the dogs out of the car and down
the woods they went, and here goes the dogs, and here goes
Bud, and here goes..... I was running pretty good at the
first of the race, I was staing inside of 'em. So down
the creek where the creek runs into the river, so then we
turned and came back up the creek, here comes Bud and then
here comes the dogs -- I was way behind. So I shot the rabbit
and hung it onthe side, made Bud mad 'cause he was killing 'em
pretty good, he was gainin on him pretty good, and he went
and jumped and back and forth he went and crossed up the
hill and back through the hollow and I decided then that
I would just give up the race, but Bud, he was running good
then he began to open his mouth and went "WhoooOOO-barking.
They run that one out, I shot him, and Bud, he was runnig real
good........so we done that all evening there and'bout dusk
or dark, he got up on one of these old swamp bucks, you know
these old buck rabbits- and down the creek he went, and those
rabbits jumped across the creek and Bud went in the creek and
crossed the creek, back up the other side of the creek, and
back across, and back in the creek, and Bud got up there, "whoo",
I loaded up that buck, and I done had myself hung all the way
around, a belt full of rabbits, you know. Bud, he didn't even
want to speak to me. Didn't know me when he came by that time.
