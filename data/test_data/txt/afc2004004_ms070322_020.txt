Tuesday. Written Wednesday... Sort
of got in circulation by the time
big Hamish came to the hotel.
Had the recording machine set up
in another room, where, in
spite of echoes, Hoovers and
cold we recorded some nice
mouth music, the original version
of King Farouk and a few of
Hamish's work ballads. Hamish
is an absorbed singer, given over
to his music, swinging  his body
& head even on playback. His 
voice is rather rough, but it's 
true and he has fine rhythm.
He cares for something beyond the
musicality or the charm of his
songs - I expect he keeps, thru
them, a close connexion with
his peasant ancestors who
were crofters in the Highlands,
