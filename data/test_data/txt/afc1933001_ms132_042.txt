Dear Alan:

I have just shipped off the final instalment of
the eighty records of Kentucky folk songs.  This
covers everything Barnicle did except for eight
records made on the battery set and three records
of gamblers' calls.  I did four of the twelve
records made on the battery set, but their quality
is not very good and the recordings themselves are
very unsteady.  I had hoped to be able to eliminate
the wows to a certain extent, but neither Barnicle's
motor, nor any I was able to find responded smoothly
to being slowed down or sped up.  Moreover, there is
considerable overloading in the originals, so that,
even leaving aside the wows, the result is not too
good.

The gamblers' calls were made in too live a room so
that they were not really distinct.  They were also
recorded at an excessively low level.  I came across
this several times, of course, and numbers 46-51 had
to have additional amplification beyond what I have
in my standard amplifier.  But here, except for some
noisy spots in the original, the results were not bad.

I should like to hear from you as to what you think of
the end product.  There is considerable variation in
quality in the originals, but every one seems to feel
that the dubbings are very faithful, and that the
added volume is a great help.

                                                                              Sincerely yours,


                                                                              Charles G Ritter.

PS. Miss Barnicle is living at Wilton now, and is very
hard to find.
