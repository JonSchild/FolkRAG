GHOST STORY.
One Sunday me andmy girl had a fal[n]ing out and I laid, I couldn't go 
to sleep.  I was thinkingover affairs about fallng out with my girl and 
I couldn't sleep.  And I lay there, I reckon until 10:30 -- the old watch stopped -- and I heard looked like men what just jumped on the counter and walked and stomped, throw down jars and thi ngs.  I 
just lo oked like to me as break ng s ow-cases and one thng.  Well, 
I had raise up and looked.  And the room where he lives, you can't see in the dark; I never could see nothing but I heard it and 
I know the next morning, the things was just like I left em, didn't been nobody in there but I heard something.  (laughter)
A:  Wel , why do you reckon there was a ghost inthere?  Was anybody 
killed in the store?
S:  I reckon so.  If it was anything like a ghost, I reckon it was the only time the people what used to live there come back.  If they are 
any such thing as a ghost, That's what it was, I guess.
A:  But your father [did] told you not to[b]believe that?
S:  Yes, and when he come back and I told him, he just laughed.  It tickled him.  He say, "Goddamn, Itold you, " he say, " I don't believe 
in anything like that but, dmn, all you got to do is lay 
aw ke one night and you'll sure hear it."
