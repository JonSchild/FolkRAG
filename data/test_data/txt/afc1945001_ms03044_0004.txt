As was stated in the forepart of this report, there is very
little interest or feeling concerning the war, except among those who
have close relatives in the service.This feeling, of course, will
change, if, and when, a second front is opened, because at that time
there will be a number of casualties, including those close to the people
in this area. One man told me that this war is so large and is being
conducted on such a grand scale that very few of the people can comprehend
or understand just what is being done and that it is necessary to put
the facts before them from time to time so that an intelligent understanding
of the operations conducted from Washington can be brought home to them.
I would like to suggest, and this is merely a suggestion, that
all of the offices throughout the United States conduct an educational
campaign consisting of speakers, either governmental or otherwise, and
radio programs, controlled in Washington, but broadcast throughout the
Union, on the various aspects of the war. To me the lack of interest in
the war in this state is alarming and the confusion, generated by conflicting
statements of Government officials in Washington and news
releases, have only aggravated the situation.
A very good example was the radio news broadcast yesterday
morning, August 7, which stated that the six saboteurs on trial had been
sentenced to be executed in the electric chair and two of them had
received clemency. Later a report over the radio stated that the
President had not finished the examination of the documents in the case
