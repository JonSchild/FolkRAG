Two days' investigation in a very quiet and
indirect fashion by a detective of the Jacksonville
police force has failed to produce any indication of
the existence of an "Eleanor" or "Daughters of Eleanor"
club in this city.

If any new information on this subject is ob-
tained, it will be forward to you promptly.
