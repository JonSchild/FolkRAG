Nevertheless it focused the attention
of millions on folk song
and when out great librariers and
our learned institutions, our foundation
of fabulous wealth, and
even the alien composer within
our gates, began to spend great
sums and much time collecting
the folk music of this land, the
managers sought to capitalize this
new interest.  Now Allan Lomax,
serving the Columbia Broadcasting
Company and the Library of
Congress,offers weekly programs
of native folk music.

What do these programs prove
about the art?
That question can be answered
most satisfactorily by illustration.
Scattered through this page are


toward the music of England and
the Americans will remain. Meanwhile
one asks: If the folk song f
all races is relatively equal in
artistic value how does it happen
that Germany, Italy and Russia are the
musically dominant nations
and Britain and the Americas their vassals?

To answer that question one
cites an entertaining and quite
accurate thesis to the effect that
national achievement in the art
of music stands in inverse ration
to sea power.  This has ample basis
in fact.  The nations that have produced 
operas have built few ships.
The nations that have planted
colonies all over the world have
few symphonies to their credit.
Consider the Dutch.  They built an
empire while Bach was laying the
foundations of German music. The
Dutch folk songs are more varied,
less mechanical, more imaginative
than the German, sturdier than
the Italian.  That implies greater
native talent for the Dutch.

However, the qualities of imagination,
the habit of mental and
emotional adventure reflected in
their song also sent the Dutch out
over the world and presently they
preferred to live adventures rather
than to sing about them.  The material
gains of empire stifled the
artistic impulse. That is true also
of the English,and the Spanish.
The colonial Spaniard and Portuguese,
like the colonial Celt, Saxon,
and Gaul, sang and danced, making
the music of frontiers.

Now his material world in excellent
order, he makes operas and
symphonies.  He has made these
artistic expressions out of the material
formulated in folk music.
He ask a hearing.  We ask new
music.  Is that the answer to the
problem of our shrinking repertoire
of opera,symphony, and
chamber music?

Revive Forgotten Music
Why is it necessary to complain
about the shrinking repertoire of
symphony?  Because the imported
conductors, who are fully aware of
it, meet the problem by reviving
dead and justly forgotten European
music native masterpieces.
Or they cling with pathetic faith

the Germans that they are a race
of supermen, a conviction which
now, as in the past, has proved
inconvenient for the rest of the
world.  It is no exaggeration to
say that the spirit which has set
the German people on the bloody
path of conquest so often during
the past century is also the spirit
of Wagner from "Tannhauser"
and "Lohengrin" to "Die Meistersinger,"
with the obvious exception 
of "Tristan" and "Parsifal."

Of course, Wagner's music is
consistently militant, which would
not be a fault were it not also
monotonous. The public is the 
victim but the conductors continue
to play it to the exclusion
of music that is expressive of our
outlook and of our spirit, that
would be new and might well be
refreshing.  for this reason, I,
and thousands like me, walk out

Turn to Nearest Source
Where can the works of native
music be found?  For the most
part conductors turn to the nearest
source at hand.  Koussevitzky,

Unusual Rhythm
New Yorker and his opera "Peter
Ibbetson" once opened a Metropolitan
season and held its place in
the repertoire longer than most
new operas.  How often have you
heard the Taylor suites?  They
are better than Tschaikowsky's

enough.  Of course it costs no
royalties to play Wagner, and Taylor 
insists on performance fees.  So
do most of the natives, which is
one of the factors against them.
