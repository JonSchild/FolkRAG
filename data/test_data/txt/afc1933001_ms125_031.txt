Mr. Alan Lomax - Page 2                       September 23, 1937

Remember also our aim to get 300 records by this trip. I realize, 
of course, that the first two weeks are the hardest and that your rate 
of production should increase. Don't turn common ballads down - they 
may have value as variants.

I hope that you'll take this sermon in the sense that is given 
and will appreciate my point of view. Really intelligent advice cannot 
be given at this distance. You know what we want and I know that we can 
count on you to do your best.

Regards to Mrs. Lomax!

Sincerely yours,

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music

P.S. I got a very nice letter from Niles. He seems anxious to help 
the Archive now.
