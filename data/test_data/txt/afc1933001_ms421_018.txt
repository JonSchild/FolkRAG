THE COMMON WEALTH OF TOIL 
By Ralph Chaplin
(Melody: Nellie Grey)

In the gloom of mighty cities 
Mid the roar of whirling wheels,
We are toiling on like chattel slaves of old, 
And our masters hope to keep us 
Ever thus beneath their heels,
And to coin our very life blood into gold. 

CHORUS   But we have a glowing dream 
Of how fair this world will seem 
When each man can live his life secure and free 
When the earth is owned by Labor 
And there's joy and peace for all 
In the Commonwealth of Toil that is to be. 

They would keep us cowed and beaten 
Cringing meekly at their feet. 
They would stand between each worker and his bread. 
Shall we yield our lives up to them 
For the bitter crust we eat? 
Shall we only hope for heaven when we're dead? 

They have laid our lives out for us 
To the utter end of time.
Shall we stagger on beneath their heavy load? 
Shall we let them live forever 
In their gilded halls of crime 
With our children doomed to toil beneath their goad? 

When our cause is all triumphant 
And we claim our Mother Earth, 
And the nightmare of the present fades away, 
We shall live with love and laughter, 
We, wo are now little worth, 
And we'll not regret the price we have to pay.
