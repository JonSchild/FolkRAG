1. There is a new song I heard but didn't see
printed that goes- You can ration
anything at all but don't try rationing
my passion.
2. I heard that the only people in New York
who drive around in cars are the Jews.
3. Over the radio I heard a new commentator
who said that during gas rationing 
he saw a senator's car in Washington
in the shopping district with the car 
running waiting for the wife to shop &
still keep the chauffeur warm.
