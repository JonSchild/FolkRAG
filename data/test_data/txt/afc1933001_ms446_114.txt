I'm booked for a ride in the air; 
You're invited to share my vacation, 
And a feast with the Bridegroom to share. 

4 

There will be no space given to smokers, 
No card parties there are allowed; 
All the backbiters, liars, and gossipers 
Can not stand such a wonderful crowd. 
But the old gospel train will be ringing 
With the shouts of the glorified throng, 
Who are on their vacation with Jesus. 
You are invited to go along. 

5 

Now when most people take their vacation
They return to their homes by and by, 
So after the great feast is over
I'll return from my trip to the sky, 
With my King who is coming to reign here 
And to set up His heavenly throne. 
All the days will be one long vacation 
As earth welcomes her Savior home. 

No.  20     Will the Circle Be Unbroken 

I was standing by the window, 
It was on one cloudy day, 
When I saw the hearse coming, 
For to carry my mother away. 

CHORUS 

Can the circle be unbroken, 
By and by, Lord, by and by? 
There is a better home awaiting, 
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.
