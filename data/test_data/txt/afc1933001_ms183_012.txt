Dear Alan:

Here's that long overdue first report on activities in
Cambridge. - The two of us (o.k. three if you insist) are
in pretty good health now, though Laya was sick for
about three weeks. I guess the activity of comming here,
and the business of trying to find an apartment were
to much for her. I, like always, find myself very tired,
but I will soon get over that; the Lab is taking a two weeks
vacation (required) for which we as yet have no plans, unless
Harold want me to go to Indio.

Domestically speaking we are not yet settled, we have
rented an apartment which we plan to move into soon; our
furniture is now on its way up and, we hope, will be organized
shortly. One of the few spare evenings that we have  had
we spend buying some new Haywood-Wakefield furniture,
a bit of news that would interest Dick Hill.

The work is the most interesting I have ever run into, and
although its in a field which I spent most of my time
until about 3 years ago, I didn't recognize it, and I had
had to spend a good deal of time with the books. At
first my head would creak and groan under the strain
of even simple trig, but after six or so weeks I am
picking up a good deal of mathematical technique; even
so, I think I spend many hours playing with things
that should be obvious, before they penetrate. - working
