Mr. Allan Lomax
Dear Sir:
We have heard your broadcasts of folk-songs on CBS school of the
air and enjoy them very much. I am descended from "York State Yankees"
and can remember hearing my parents sing some of the songs you have sung
on the air.  They also sang some I never have heard any one else sing. 
My mother often sang "A Frog he Would A-Wooing Go" but the words were
different than those usually heard.  She also sang "Brennan on the Moor",
"Gypsy Davy", and one beginning "McAllister, McAllister was a brisk and
brave young soldier", being a tale of highway robbery and love and ending
on the gallows.  I remember nearly all the words and would like to 
get the rest of them. 
My father used to sing a rather sad Southern song, "My Dear Savannah
Home" which I have never hear from any other source and can find
no trace of in the Song Exchange to which my daughter belongs.  It seems
to me that some of those old songs were too lovely to be lost, and had 
much sweeter melodies than so-called popular songs of today. 
If copies of any of these songs that I remember as my parents sang
them would be of any use to you, I would gladly send them. My typing is
not perfect as I just lately learned it by myself.  Am past fifty but 
can still learn something new, though when it comes to songs I like the 
old ones best.  With the hope that you can keep up the good work of 
broadcasting the old folk-songs, I am 
Yours sincerely, 
(Mrs. Gilbert Maney) Libbie Maney.
