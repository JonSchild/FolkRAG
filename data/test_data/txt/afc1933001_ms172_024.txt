SUBJECT Alan Lomax

Referring to your memorandum of June 30th; we have checked payments 
made to Alan Lomax for services on the School of the Air program 
and find that payments were made consecutively each week for $100.00 
and also that payment was made on March 29th for his services in 
connection with the Columbia dinner at the Hotel Commodore for the 
first Peabody award.

According to our Auditing Department there are no outstanding checks, 
therefore he had received payment for all programs on which he was 
engaged.

We are therefore closing our file in connection with this matter.
