Dear John:

Thanks so much for sending me the copy of the advertisement
of "Our Singing Country".

I am delighted to get the copy of the poem to you and
your wife.

I thought the remarks of the Archbishop of Canterbury
were unnecessary at the time but from my own point
of view if there ever was a man who quit and did not
have it in him, it was King Edward the Eighth of
England.

Yours Sincerely,
Barrett Wendell

P.S. Post 3 copies
for Xmas presents.
