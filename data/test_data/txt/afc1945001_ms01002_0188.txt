Dear Sir:

This office is engaged in establishing a series
of "Rumor Clinics" in various colleges throughout the
country for the purpose of collecting and eventually
"sterilizing" rumors. Each Clinic will be directed
by a man of some experience in the field of psychological
warfare, who will be resident at the college concerned.
Each "director" will have a staff of approximately 25
undergraduates, graduate students, and members of the
faculty. These assistants are to be given a brief survey
course in rumor and psychological warfare, based on a
syllabus being drawn up by this office.

The compilation of the syllabus proves to be a 
problem: how to be brief, yet thorough enough? how to
have it viable for men of differing opinions, yet
stringent enough to produce the measure of uniformity
which we will need in order to produce meaningful reports
on morale (using rumor as an index of morale)? how to 
develop a bibliography in the short time which we have?
etc.

In the hope that you will be able to assist us, I
am enclosing a tentative draft of the syllabus. If you
have the opportunity to assemble your criticisms and
suggestions, I will be delighted to incorporate them
into the finished product. If you are able to see me
personally, either in Princeton or Washington, it would
be splendid

As we are pressed for time, such an interview would
preferably take place at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
George A. Nelson
George Nelson, Jr.
