have already been made of many of them- 
The group on which I am working now 
is to be the basis of my doctoral dissertation 
here and at Vanderbilt. Hence, as you know, 
I shall be under certain restrictions 
until the degree is granted, [We hope 
that will be in June or August, 1938.]. 
On the other hand, I shall be glad 
to discuss with you the situation in our
region. Won't you please send me specific 
questions [that I] and suggestions as to 
how the music could be recorded as 
long as I am here in Graduate School- 
I have found our people very reluctant about 
singing, even for me another mountaineer until 
they learn that my father "used to teach Jamie
and Jeanie" or that Mother "was John's first 
girl way back when - - -." Was this 
your experience in Kentucky? 
Your father's article in the "Southern 
Folklore Quarterly" was fascinating and
I hope that you keep the recording growing- 
Sincerely yours, 
Bess Alice Owens 
P.S. Yes a few of my ballads were located 
through students who knew the singers-
