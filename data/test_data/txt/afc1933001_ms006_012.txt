           The volume that we put on the records has caused the engineers, in the
studio where you visited, to make changes on the Fairchild cutting heads ( they
have four of these ) to obtain a corresponding volume.

           Do not forget that I would like to have any information about length of
time the batteries will supply power without a recharge.

           I am sending you a book, on this type of recording, written by one of the
engineers on my staff; I believe you will find something interesting in it. while
it does not cover any of the new materials, which only we have used, it will be
of interest to you.

                                            Sincerely yours,
                                                                      W. C. Garwick
