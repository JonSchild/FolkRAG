Mr. Allen Lomax --
New Roads La.-
Dear Mr. Lomax - So sorry to 
have missed you yesterday.  I 
may have been able to help 
you.
My maid said you asked for 
my sister's address which is:
Mrs. Willie Catlett, Elton, La (Jeff
Davis Parish) about forty miles
a little north east of Lake 
Charles. She will be able to 
assist you in securing French and 
"Cajun" folk songs and games and 
also take you for a visit to an 
Indian Villige five miles out -
The Last of the Coushatta Indians -
