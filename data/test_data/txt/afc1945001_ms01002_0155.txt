Mr. Gregory V. Drumm:

Greenville, Michigan

My dear Mr. Drumm: 

            The letters which you addressed to Mrs. Eleanor 
Roosevelt and to Colonel Donovan, respectively, have 
come into my hands. They seem to me to contain some 
interesting suggestions for the prevention of the 
spread of rumors and I think you will be interested 
to know that an Interdepartmental Committee has 
already been studying this whole problem. 

            I have, therefore, taken the liberty of 
passing on this material to Mr. Cornelius Dubois 
of the Office of Facts and Figures, who is in general 
charge of this inquiry. 

                                                  Very truly yours,
 
                                                  William L. Langer 
                                                  Director of Research
