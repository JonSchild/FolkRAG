Subject: EMBARKATION OF SOLDIERS

A sister of a soldier said, "My brother is in Iceland. Of course I have no business to give away Uncle Sam's secrets but I am sure he is there."
"Why?"
"Two persons called me up when he was still on the ocean and told me so."
"Two civilians?"
"No, two enlisted men who had known him in camp."
