1. I have heard that the Germans did in one 
campaign send wave after wave of men into a 
passe while fighting the English. After too 
many men had piled up and blocked the 
pass, they, the Germans, sent a tank through 
the piles of dead men to clear the way 
for more men.

2. I have heard that Hitler is sickly and 
about dead of over exertion and worry

3. I have heard that the WACCS and waves are not for the purpose [of] suggested by their 
advertisements but are in reality to be used 
as prostitutes for solders and sailors.

4. I have heard that one method of instruction 
used by our Marine Corps is the use of lead 
pipe and rubber hose on those soldiers who 
are slow to learn or who need minor discipline.

5. I have heard that most soldiers feel (as do 
most civilians) that the college student is a 
professional slacker and that antagonism toward 
the college student is strong.
