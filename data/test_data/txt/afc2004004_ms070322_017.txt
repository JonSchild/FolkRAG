Sunday. Slept late: This is a
bad habit of mine, worsened
by living with Robin. Robin
very ill with cold, I crept
out to get her fruit & she
cast a fiery and feverish look
at me as I left. I thought she
was angry & bored with me
& I thought evil thoughts all
the way to the fruit stand at
Marble Arch, but when I came
back & found her red with
fury because I hadn't spoken
to her. It's always hard for
me to remember that she loves
me and depends upon me.
Spent afternoon reading
to her. Cut a little take. Went
to party arranged for me by Max
Tone, the baldheaded & super-friendly
jazz critic, met
