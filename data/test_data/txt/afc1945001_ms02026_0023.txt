Study of the Chicago Press (Continued)  2

The results of this part of the study will be related to the results of
the other two parts. There is good reason to expect that lack of realism
in this sphere will be closely related to divisive and unfavorable attitudes
both in the press content and in the reactions of the readers.
 2. A record is kept of the targets of press attacks and the character
of the attacks. For example, we have already found that the Tribune has
been forced to shift from its direct attack on the administration to attacking
such unofficial "devils" as New Yorkers, Ralph Ingersoll, refugee royaalty,
et al. In March such unofficial "devils" accounted for but 15 per cent of 
the Tribune's domestic political attacks, while in July they accounted for
about 40 per cent.
 In a similar manner, of course, record is kept of all identifications.
By determining the relative frequency of attacks on and identifications with
various groups such as labor, the government, or our allies, and the character
and sphere of the attacks we can establish the impact of events upon
the various papers, and also the relationship between the presence of certain
critical attitudes in the press, and the acceptance of the attitudes by the
attitudes by the readers. The latter involves relating the results of this
section of the study to those of the final section.
 3. A recently completed study by the Committee on Communications has
shown that the Tribune and Sun do exert a marked influence on their readers'
opinions. We found that dissatisfaction with the Tribune's was attitudes
was the primary factor making people turn to the Sun. We found, further,
that people who stuck to the Tribune did so, for the most part, despite its
war attitudes and because of habit, features, or style. We also found (and
this is most important) that the appearance of the Sun did result in a marked
