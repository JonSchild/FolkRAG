The other fellow was Jimmy Tiger. So when we get into 
town they all go out there and see where they could get commissioned 
for me to play. I'd be sitting on the edge playing a tune, 
putting money in my pocket. Come time to eat, I ain't got nothing. 
LARRY: 
Right. 
GARY: 
You understand. These things you got to do when you traveling 
with somebody, you got to look out for yourself, you don't your 
lost. And you ain't gonna be treated right when you go with 
other folks. When you go off by yourself you understand 
you can take much farther. And that fella tried to [shaft] shove me off 
at that lake and I [went wack] wammed him across the head with my walking 
cane. 
LARRY: 
Sure enough? 
GARY: 
Yes, he tried to shove me off in the lake. 
LARRY: 
Well I'll be damned. 
GARY: 
Deep as that water was, and dangerous as it was. 
LARRY: 
You can't swim no ways, can you swim? 
GARY: 
To the bottom.
