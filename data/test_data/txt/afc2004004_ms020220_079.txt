BJ TAPE 7A, p. 75


TL:  I'll be darned.
BJ:  Jus' call it. . .an' ya see a big, white streak sometimes,
right across the heavens, when the stars shine bright.  They say
that's Mary's Milk Pan.  I don't know how they know it, but they
say that she waste -- She, she spilt a pail of milk.  So, an'
said that that, an' that's where the word come in at, "There's no
use in grievin' after spilt milk."
TL:  Oh!  I didn't know that.
BJ:  Um-hum.  That's where that word comes in at.  'Cause hit's
really gone, they say, heh, it's gone!  An' [so]that's where
that word come in in at.  You know, like that.  'Cause they'd
say that was Mary's Milk Pan.  Ah, tha's ah, she was someplace,
anyhow, an' it says she spilt -- after milkin' the cow -- she
spilt this pail of milk.  An' this b--word is used, ya know, in
the Bible, "There's no use a-grievin' after spilt milk." An'
so that's where they say that come in at.
     An' he also learnt me a lot. . ah. . .ABC's [of] in the stars?
Ya know, an' they ah, an' they are jus' as plain as in the book.
TL:  They are?
BJ:  Yeah, plain as in the book.  The ABC's.  Right on the, jus'
the two, jus' the two straight lines, not four; there's jus'
two lines.  Tha's right.  An' plain.  If you jus' know how to
read them.  An' so I think it's just marvelous how them old
peoples learnt things an' could do things an' learnt things of
science an' things like that.  But they go to huntin', he could come
out the woods anywhere, an' people's lost [or] all they wanted to
know was jus', [you know] jus' watch if the stars was out.
