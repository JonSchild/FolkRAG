Shorty George

Past the Central State Farm at Sugarland, Texas, there chugs
every day a little, short train.  The men have name it "Shorty 
George. An Because on Sunday 
afternoon it carries off the Negro women visitors. they sing about it
as if it were some "seedbeds" man. 
The text of this version of Texas prison farm blues is probably more than that printed under 
the same title in "American Ballads and Folk Songs".  The melody
is an interesting variant.
