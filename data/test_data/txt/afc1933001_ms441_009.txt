**For [?]

When I was a little boy, little boy, little boy,
When I was a little boy, twelve years old,
Papa went an' left me, left me, left me,
Papa went an' left me, to save my soul.

Chorus:
Hi! thisaway,
Hi! thisaway,
Hi! thisaway,
Ho, ho, thisaway,
Ha, ha, thisaway,
Ha, ha, thisaway,
Ha, ha, thisaway,
Then, oh, then.

Mama come an' got me, got me, got me,
Mama come an, got me, to save my soul.
Mama didn' whiff* me, whiff me, whiff me,
Mama didn' whiff me, so I was tole.

Ha! ha! thisaway,
Ha! ha! thisaway,
Ha! ha! thisaway,
Then, o then.

I went to school, went to school, went to school, boys,
I went to school when I was twelve years old;
Obeyed the rules, the rules, boys,
Obeyed the rules as I was told.**

Learned my lessin', lessin',
Learned my lessin', as I was told
Wasn' that a blessin', blessin', blessin',
Wasn' that a blessin', to save my soul

Liked my teacher, teacher, teacher,
Liked my teacher, so I was told;
Prayed like a preacher, preacher, preacher, to save my soul.

I went to school, went to school, went to school,
I went to school when I was twelve years old,
Teacher didn' whiff me, whiff me, whiff me,
Teacher  didn' whiff me, to save my soul.

*L.B sometimes says "Whip" for whiff + "whiff" for whip.
