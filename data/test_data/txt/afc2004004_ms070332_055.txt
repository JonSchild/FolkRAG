Congressional Record

SEVENTY-FIFTH CONGRESS, THIRD SESSION

WHO ARE THE DICTATORS?
SPEECH
OF
HON. JOHN T. BERNARD
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
April 2, 1938

LET ME TELL YOU A SECRET

Mr. BERNARD. Mr. Chairman, it grieves me very much
to be compelled to disagree with the leader of the Farmer-Labor-Progressive
bloc, but I have a secret in which I am
positive even my very good friend, Mr. BOILEAU, will be very
mush interested. Here it is. I have working for me the
keenest minds in America. I have working for me the
highest-salaried men in America. Whenever a bill of this
sort is going to come up for consideration in the House I
have these men to scrutinize, analyze, and weigh very carefully
every word and every punctuation mark in such bill.
They have offices throughout the country, with an army of
secretaries and stenographers, and after all this analysis,
after all this careful weighing, when they come to me and
say, "Mr. Congressman, our decision is 'no'," then I close my
eyes and I feel very safe within myself in voting "yes."
[Laughter.]

THESE ARE MY BRAINTRUSTERS

You all know this group and you all know that I am right.
Yes; of course, I am referring to William Randolph Hearst,
to the Liberty League, to the wolves of Wall Street, to the
United States Chamber of Commerce, to the House of
Morgan, to the war makers, to the enemies of human progress.

It may sound a little funny, but this thought flashed
through my mind last night when I was in my humle bed
thinking about this bill.

WHO ARE THE REAL DICTATORS?

When I hear the Republicans speak of dictatorship and
maintain that they do not want to see any individual or
small group of individuals have too much power, I am
naturally puzzled. In my humble estimation coal is power,
oil is power, iron ore is power, our streams, our forests,
all our natural resources, the wealth of America, represent
tremendous power; and why do they not protest against the
House of Morgan and other money barons who control so
much power in our country? They speak of dictatorship,
but I am firmly convinced within myself that that same
small clique of selfish individuals who, unfortunately, at
this time control the very lives of the American people, have
been using that stolen power as dictators.

WHO ARE THE PATRIOTS?

My Republican colleagues were also speaking about patriotism.
I wonder what they mean by patriotism? To me
patriotism means a better America for all the American people.
To me patriotism does not mean concentration of
wealth in the hands of 2 percent of our people. It means
America for the American people, including, of course, the
"real Americans," those who are building and feeing this
country.

Let us at least try to be true to ourselves. We were sent
here by the American people to do our level best to represent
them, and that we should do. Unfortunately, and disgustingly
so, I see too many of these would-be representatives of
the people bowing continuously to the forces of reaction.

I CHOOSE ROOSEVELT

If I must choose--and I am compelled to choose, of course,
on this bill, like on any other bill--I look around, and what
do I see? On one side I see Roosevelt, who was put in office
by such an overwhelming majority fighting desperately
against the forces of intolerance, of selfishness, and greed
to do something constructive and progressive for his people,
and on the other side I see the forces of reaction, I see the
Hearsts, the Morgans, and the Liberty League the creators of
that horrible monster "fascism." Of course, I must go with
Roosevelt and not with his enemies, the enemies of human
decency.

MY PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

I shall feel quite safe when I go back home to my people
and tell them, in all truthfulness, that I had to choose between
these two sides. They will understand, for they are
true progressives, real Americans. Only a few minutes ago I
listened with very much attention and amusement to my
colleague from Missouri. If his outbursts of eloquence will
not have any more success than they did when he came into
my own congressional district to campaign for my Republican
opponent he will not be very successful. I want to thank him
for paying my people a visit in 1936 because he really helped
me tremendously. I defeated my Republican opponent by
16,000 votes, and I certainly hope he will come back again to
campaign for him because the same individual is going to
run against me this year.

Therefore, in order to be true to ourselves, in order to be
true to our people, let us not desert Roosevelt and follow
Hearst. The statements that the passage of this bill will
give the President powers of a dictator, are ridiculous and
false fabrications. In plain American language, damnable
lies. [Applause.]

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
