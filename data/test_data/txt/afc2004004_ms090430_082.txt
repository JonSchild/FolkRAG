This school has no transportation facilities, although many children
live as much as five miles away. Objections from the white community
prevented the Negro children from having a school bus, although the
Negroes in the community had raised sufficient funds to purchase a chassis,
and the school board was building the body. White residents of the community
felt that if Negro children rode to and from school it would make
them "too much like white children."

These large consolidated schools are the centers for social
life in the community. They sponsor ball games, boxing, moving pictures,
plays, farmers' conferences and community fairs. The attendance at meetings
is very large, because there are no other provisions for recreation
in the community.

Another valuable service performed by the schools is the education
of parents in home beautification, scientific farming, and proper
methods for the canning of fruits and vegetables. Contests are conducted
and prizes awarded for the best cotton, the best corn, and the best hogs.
The schools permit the women of the community to utilize their equipment
for the proper canning of their vegetables and beef, under the direct supervision
of the home economics teacher. The changes under way in the schools,
and as a result of the school, are not in the logic of the plantation development,
but they are made possible by a combination of factors, social,
economic, and political.
