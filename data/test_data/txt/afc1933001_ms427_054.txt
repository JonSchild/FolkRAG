REUBEN & RACHAEL

Rueben, Rueben, I've been thinking                    Rachel, Rachel, I've been thinking
What a queer world this would be                      What a queer world this would be
If the men were all transported                           If the girls  were all transported
Far beyond the Northern Sea.                             Far beyond the Northern Sea !

Rueben, Rueben, I've been thinking                    Rachel, Rachel, I've been thinking
Life would be so easy there                                  Life would be so easy there
What a lovely world this would be                       What a lovely world this would be 
If there were no tiresome men!                            If you'd leave it to the men

Rueben, Rueben, I've been thinking                     Rachel, Rachel, I've been thinking
If we went beyond the seas                                   If we went beyond the seas
All the men would follow after                              All the girls would follow after
Life a swarm of humble bees                                Like a swarm of honey bees

BLOW THE MAN DOWN

1.  Come, all you young fellows that follow the sea,
     With a yeo-ho!  we'll blow the man down!
     And please pay attention and listen to me,
     Give us some time to blow the man down.

2.  On board the Black Baller I first served my time
     With a yeo-ho!  we'll blow the man down!    
      And in the Black Baller I wasted my time,
     Give us some time to blow the man down.
 
3.  There were tinkers and tailors and sailors and all,
     With a yeo-ho we'll blow the man down!              
     Thad shipped for good seamen on board the Black Ball,
     Give us some time to blow the man down!

4.  'Tis lar-board and starboard, you jump to the call,
      With a yeo-ho!  we'll blow the man down!
      When Kicking Jack Williams commands the Black Ball,
      Give us some time to blow the man down!

OLD ZIP COON

1.  There was once a man with a double chin
      Who performed with skill on the violin,
      And he play'd in time, and he played in tune,
      But he couldn't play anything but Zip Coon
      Old Zip coon he played all day,
      Until he drove all his friends away;
      He played all night by the light of the moon
      But he wouldn't play anything but Zip Coon
      -----
2.   They left him there by the deep blue sea,
      Where he lives a-lone in a hollow tree;
      And he plays that tune and it never ends,
      So it isn't surprising that he had no friends,
      Old Zip Coon he plays all day,
      There's no one left to run away;
      And still he thinks it's a beautiful tune,
      And that is the history of Old Zip Coon.
