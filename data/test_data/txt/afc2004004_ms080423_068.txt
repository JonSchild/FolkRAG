(AL)  How does it come to you, what do you. . .
Madonna:   Oh, I do, just cry (?) or. . .pat my foot, keep (unint). . .
AL:   Well, everybody has his own kind of religion, doesn't he,
that's what it's about being in America.   Well, the thing
we've been running into, talking to people in the mountains,
is the incredible kind of independence in religion.   I talked
to a man yesterday who said that Jesus was a "red man" --

and he said "I saw him."  I said "when was that?" "last year"

does, so let's just believe that he is the Christ, forget
the color, and I believe that all America would be a lot
better, don't you?   I do.   By the way, did I tell you her
name a while ago,  I don't believe I did.   Her name's Lil.
AL:   We'll (unint)  when she's led us all in song.

Man:   Alright. . .but let us say that it has been a real joy.
