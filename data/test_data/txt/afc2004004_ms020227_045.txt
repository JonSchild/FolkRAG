So he was talkin' to me so good about it, an' goin' on so strong that I was he'pin' him, then, to learn to midwife.  'Cause he had caught me, ya know, in, in, ya know, midwifin' that lady.  So he just continue on.  Want me to train to be one.  I woulda been somebody with it if I'da went on, but I thought I was jus' too young an' I would dodge 'im.  Heh, an' wouldn't go!  An' so that's jest why I done just lost all that, ya know?

But after -- But this school, this place, I was, I had a good mind to go there, ya know.  I had already wrote an' told Mama an' them about it.  I might take it up, ya see?  An' so, ah, at this midwife place, in um, another doctor told me, said -- not Dr. Welcher -- see, Dr. Harper tol' me that they would have to spay me.  You know?

Then I asked her about it, what it meant an' everything an' she tol' me.  An' then I didn't wanna do that.

AL:  You heard that it you were gonna work for this doctor he would have spayed you?

BJ:  He had to spay me, uh-huh.  He had to spay me.

AL:  He hadn't explained that to you?

BJ:  No.  N-not Dr. Welcher.  But Dr. Harper told me, see?

AL:  But he was gonna have you take care of his own little girl?

BJ:  I was... aw... no.  He didn't have no girl.  He gonna send me into this school.  Somewhere or other.  I don' know where it was gonna be, where it gonna be at, you know.

AL:  What was the reason that they told you that you had to be spayed?

BJ:  Ah, well, ah, ah, 'cause I tol' 'em I was gonna take the job.
