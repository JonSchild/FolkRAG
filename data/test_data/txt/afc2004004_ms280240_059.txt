(She...)
Yes, he would take her home...he says "I'll take you to the
dance and I'll take you home." And "I'll see your home," he
says, "I'll see your haim," as it were, "I'll see you haim."
So he'd...when they were going haim, that is, that's
the way it, that the way they'd fall in love.

(He'd ask whether he could come up that night...
-Yes
(...up the ladder)
Yes, well he says...ah yes, he would...yes - "You'd
better watch," she says, "Throw up a stone, a chucky small whitish stone.  Then
when," she says, "I'll know if you're there.  Get a ladder
and come up and lift up the window cammy"  And he'd sleep
with her above in the farm house, next to the farmer, the same
house that the farmer stayed in - just above the kitchen.

(How'd he get the ladder down?  Would he have somebody up there
to take the ladder away for him?)
He shoved it away.  He shoved it into the garden - he shoved it
away... amongst the... there always a garden there tall of
apples, trees or something he'd shove them against, an apple
tree.  And about a quarter to five, they got up at that time -
the servant girl got a knock [?] the foreman, that was the
man that carried worked the first pair of horse.  He'd give
a kick at the door to get up.  That was to
make their food and everything - they went into their breakfast
at half past five that time.  And, he would let her out at the 
kitchen door at the back....the back door and he would get out.
