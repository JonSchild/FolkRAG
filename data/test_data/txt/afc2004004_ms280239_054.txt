let the girl go again they would maybe never get her again,
you see..... They need to be pretty good..... 3 There was always
more men than girls.... there be two girls at some of the big
farms, but there would be six or eight men, you see.....
4 the girls were always a scarce commodity and when they began
their dance the girls sat at one side and the men at the other.
- dancing deportment, taught by the greatest marvel that ever
was - a man, we call him Dancey Morrison and he was the only
man on the face of the earth that ever controlled the farm
servants - the one and only lad.  There never was a farmer
that ever controlled the farm servants.  There never was a
grieve nor anybody else.  The good lad was a law to himself,
but he didna need much control.   This man, Morrison, if

that.... and mind you, there was always a belle of the ball,
as it's called - d'you see - and wasn't it a fine thing for
that quean gin three or four of the best men of the district,
sitting at the other side and it would suddenly be announced
"Lancers" and there'd be four of them bolt for this girl
and the best ane got her.  If he was able to cuff the other
