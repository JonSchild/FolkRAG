3,

the dust bin.  I am not bragging
on my point of view, but you
have put me slightly on the defensive.  
All this is not worth
this scribbling. You can say anything 
to me, at any time, and I'll
tell you my mind and be
as fair as I know how
to be.

I appreciate your work on
the Cowboy Songs situation, and
I am glad the matter is not
urgent.

Three more times have I 
written to Mr. Spivacke with
more and more [and] details about
my trip. Also I have urged him
to make suggestions or criticisms.
I shall follow all your leads
