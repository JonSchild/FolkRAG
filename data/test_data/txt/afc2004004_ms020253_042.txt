TL:  How do you know the person's not crazy?
BJ:  No, no!  Now, I was getting back to where we started at.
Uh, uh, Alfonso an' his mother was talkin', an' uh, uh, out
there, about it.  So Alfonso said, "Muma says, uh, sho'," he
says, "Peoples can't he'p speakin' unknown tongues."  He said,
"I know," he said, "When the spirit get on get on me," he said, he
said, he said, "Tha's the joy."
     "Oh, I've spoken in tongue," she said, "When I first come through,
a lil' bit, an' I , I ain't spoke since.  I know I got as much Holy Ghost
as any of 'em aroun' here," says, "Git the Holy Ghost about
fi' or six months ago hittin' on me, ya know, an' then think
they know it all."
     That thing sure hurted me!  It hurt me so bad.  I's washin'
dishes in her kitchen; I know she hintin' at me; sumpin' jus' got
all over me.  I went in her room, a little back shed room she
had there an' I got on my knees then, an' I talked to the Lawd.
Tha's why I say I went over with another fast.  I couldn't eat
another meal.  I said, "Lawd, you take care a me."  An' so, the
soul, an' let her know that truly it ain't people makin' up
this.  'Cause peoples can't do that; tha's the spirit of God.
You see, an' any time it come, any where it come, uh, when it
come, it's there, an' no, no man can stop it.
     An' so, anyhow, that night, ya see, in, in church, that
same night -- see how quickly the Lawd comes -- I was on my
fast, heavy, for, for I wanted to know should I be baptized
the second time, you know?  What I meant, you know, in the
wada (water), because I didn't understand it that I should be.
An' so, an' I wanted to know, I wanted to do, everything that
was definitely right, you know, an' uh, for my soul.  An' so,
