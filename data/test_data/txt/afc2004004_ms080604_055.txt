W.B. :
No, you didn't have to load fast --they didn't
rush you, you know.  There'd be a man there singin a song for
you, though.
A.L. :
Really?
W.B. :
Yes.  They said, "Look at my roustabouts, how
they movin on.  I want y'all to come on an bring that cotton
on."
A.L. :
Sing it to us, sing it to us.
W.B. :
Yeah. (begins singing:)

Whoa, look at my men
How they movin on
Keep a-rockin, boys
And bring that cotton on.
(speaking:)
You know, and we would be rockin!  Just doin it
for him!  Now, I was young -it was fun to me.  I weighed a
hundred eighty, eighty-two pounds and 350, 400 was nothin for
me to pick up.
B. Gordon:
I got to be goin, it's five o'clock.
W.S. Hart:
What you mean, man?
B.G. :
Oh, oh. . excuse me.
W.S. Hart:
Straight up!
W.B. :
Yeah, we'd be out there. . -like we'd get to
Arkansas City, women's would be on the bank like that (makes
downward spreading motion), you know.  Standing up on the 
levee, you know. (in falsetto:)  "Hey!  Hey!  Hey!"  When theys
get to Natchez, the one that (just?) here?  This was a river
then (points to water).  See, this is Lake Ferguson now.  They
cut a spillway down there to cut if off.  When she used to git
'long yonder, she would make that blow.  And that levee there
would be linin' with women meeting us.
