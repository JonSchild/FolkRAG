When we wrote again later in the Spring we had to ask Lead Belly
for Margaret's address. By this time he had guessed what
we were about and rushed a letter [into the mails] to
Dallas with a five dollar bill enclosed. [and] After [*cap*]
some delay Margaret sent us the letter [that is] quoted in
full below. The impact of the five dollar bill is evident,
but the letter is still interesting since it gives us a
notion of what his parents and friends thought
of Lead Belly when he was a boy and of how, in all likelihood,
Lead Belly (and his admirers have) rationalized his own career.
