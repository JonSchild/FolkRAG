Dear Stuart:
The enclosed are some rumors gathered shortly after the Japs struck.  America 
has apparently become a vast rumor factory and they are vastly important for morale.  
The Negroes, as I get it from Negroes and people working with them, find it hard to 
identify with our cause in the Pacific since the Negroes are not fighting there.  They 
can't get in the Navy and are practically ruled out of the air force.  If a Negro unit 
were sent to the Far East that would help.  But to get them really steamed up the 
color bar must be modified.  The large Italian community in Phila seems to be in a 
violent state of flux .  The constant harpingon Italians as cowards has burned them
up .  Benito has lost much but not all his luster.  There seems to be an active 
propaganda among them that Italians are discriminated against even if they are citizens.  
How fortunate it would be if an Italian hero should turn up in our armed forces!  

Have signed a contract for a book on propaganda and social change but its like 
standing under Niagara and writing about it.

Yours,
Hugh Carter
