Dear President Holland:

   I am delighted to have your letter
of the twenty-ninth of April and to know of your interest
in our recording project.  I am going to ask Dr. Spivacke
of the Division of Music, who will have charge of this,
to write to you directly.  Thank you again for your
inquiry.

Faithfully yours,

Archibald MacLeish
The Librarian of Congress
