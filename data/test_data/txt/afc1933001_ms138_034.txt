Dear Mr. Greene:
 Upon my return from a trip recently, I heard that 
certain records from our Archives were shipped to the 
British Broadcasting Co. for reproduction.  I am very 
pleased that we can be of service to you and hope that 
you will be able to use them for material. 

Will you please send me a note acknowledging receipt
of these records for our files, and including a 
statement to the effect that they will not be used for 
any commercial purposes?  I am sorry to have to trouble 
you about this but I am sure that you will understand
the necessity for this request. 

With kindest regards, 

Sincerely yours, 

Harold Spivacke 
Chief, Division of Music
