College - Sophomore - Negro - Female

One of the anecdote that I read about the war is where I read are article in the paper about the negroes at war, as some of the negroes says that conditions could be worse if Hitler was the ruler than they are now for the negroes

2. Another anecdote that I read in the newspaper was pertaining to the W.A.A.C's where the husband and wife were both in the army. The husband being only a Sgt and the wife a second Lt. He approached her and was telling her how proud he was of her and she in turn told how proud she was of him, and she was waiting for a salute from him.

3. Another article that I have read is pertaining to the W.A.V.E. and SPOT where at first they were only taking the white bodies and now it is open to both white and colored.

4. Segregation at the W.A.A.C. center in Des Moines Iowa
