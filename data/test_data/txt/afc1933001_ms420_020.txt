The capitalists will fool you if you don't watch out
[THE LOVE BUG]

The capitalists will fool you if you don't watch out
And if they do, you'll scream and shout,
Naked and hungry and nothin' to eat,
My wife and children throwed out on the street,
That's what class struggle's all about.
[ABC]

They try to make you think they're the [worker's] poor man's friend,
But, that'l when elections they are trying to win,
That's what the capitlaists is about.
[AC]

But the workers know what class they're in
And they sure do know who's the worker's friend,
That's what the workers are about.
[AC]

We win this election by a big majority
For we all voted for Mayor Le Gardy.
That's what the Labor Party's all about.
[AC]

I am a real American, my father always said,
My grandmother, she's a[n] Indian, so you can call me a Red,
That's what class struggle's all about.
[AC]

We go idey-idey-idey we go boo-boo-boo.
But you can't fool the workers, you bourgeois, you.
That's what class struggle's all about.
[BC}

Try to fool the workers, o strike we'll go.
With, the Farmer-Labor party and the CIO.
That s what the workers are about.
[AC}
