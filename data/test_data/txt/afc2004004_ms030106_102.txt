Mr. Jelly Lord

In foreign lands across the sea,
They knight a man for bravery,
Make him a duke or a count, you see, 
Must be a member of the royalty.

Mr. Jelly struck a jazzy thing
In the temple by the queen and king.
All at once he struck upon a harmonic chord.
King said, "Make Jelly a Lord."

Mr. Jelly Lord,
He's simply wild at that old key-board.
You should see him he plays jazz  music as a rule,
Sits upon his throne, that old piano stool.

With his melodies,
I mean he really strokes the ivories,
Now at home as well as abroad,
They call him Mr. Jelly Lord.

When Mr. Jelly struck his old home town
The people gathered 'round,
They said, "Mr. Jelly, you're so grand,
We going to make you king of Dixieland."

All the people from far and near
Said, "Mr. Jelly, you've nothing to fear."
The preacher man said, "The boy's a bear,
If you can't make him king, we'll make him the mayor."

Jelly Lord,
He's simply wild at that old keyboard,
You should see him toil when you see him strolling
down the street,
Yes, the man's an angel with great big feet.

With his melodies have made him Lawd of ivories,
Just a simple little chord
Now at home as well as abroad
They call him Mr. Jelly Lord.

Oh, Jelly Lord,
He's simply wild at the old keyboard,
You should see him toil when he plays jazz music as
a rule,
God knows an ivory fool.

With him melodies have made him Lawd of ivories,
Just a simple chord
And at home as well as abroad,
They call him Mr. Jelly Lord, baby.
