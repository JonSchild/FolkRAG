Wooten:   They've scattered a whole lot now.  
There's 15 or 20 here today.
 
AL:   Do you have any favorite songs?  Any favorites in the 
book that stir yuou more than any others?

Wooten:   In the hymn part of the book, on page 47 and 49 . . .
(sound bad-- then better)  song begins on page 47--
words start off--- And am I Born to Die. . . Lay this body down.  
I don't know it by heart.

AL:   Sounds real sad.

Wooten:   It is. . .  a real good song.  And then 49-  Ibelieve 
its 49-  "Will God forever cast us off?""   And then in 
the class music, #441- that's Raymond. . . ."Hark how I hear 
the trumpet sound". . then it goes on thru- I couldn't sing 
it just talking to you and tell you.  And, Eternal Day that's 
2 of my favorite class songs.

AL::  Thanks, bye.

Random talking, laughing, 3-4 minutes

AL:   Heard about you for years.  My name is Alan Lomax.
 I was at Sand Mountain when we recorded up there in 1960.

Man:   I sure did want to see you--I don't know where I'll 
be staying, but if I stay over at Green Oaks, I'd love to 
see you, go out and have supper with you.

Older Man:   I think we have reservations. . .Green Oak. . . .
