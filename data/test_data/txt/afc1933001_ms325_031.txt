Knoxville Man's Idea Would Preserve Ballad Folk-Lore Of The

Rhythmic songs of toil, songs of earth and life, of blackened
villains, of romantic loves and wistful tragedy, of heroic
exploits, and of likable, red-blooded brigands.
   These are the ballads, the melodies long sung in the blue
loneliness of the Great Smoky Mountains, handed down, unwritten,
from generation to generation of mountaineers, as they
were handed down centuries before in England to be carried
across the sea by the pioneers.
   They are soul and bone of an ancient universal heritage,
source of a thousand streams of more sophisticated music and
literature, but still held in their original charm by the people
still more close to the earth itself than almost any other American
group, the Great Smoky mountaineer.
   T. S. M'KINNEY of Knoxville, by profession an insurance man,
by avocation a mountain lover, has introduced an idea into
the thinking of a few interested people which already is beginning
to take form in definite hopes.
   During the Appalachian Trail Conference at Gatlinburg,
McKinney heard Prof. and Mrs. I. G. Greer of Boone, N. C., present
some of their unrivaled collection of mountain ballads and
he was impressed by their value as folk-lore literature and significancde
to national culture.
   "Why," he thought, "shouldn't something be done to keep
these mountaineer ballads alive, alive in their natural
surroundings?"
   Then he thought of the great international gatherings that
go to Oberammergau, in Germany, to see the Passion Play.  He
began to think of a sort of Oberammergau in the Smokies, developed
in connection with the Great Smoky Mountains National 
Park.  It would be a festival expressive of the rich traditional

mountain culture in which the ballads would be sung and enacted
by the mountaineers.
   A sort of ampitheater might be built in a mountain setting
where the ballads would not only be sung, but where their
long, droning stories would be acted out.  Possibly for a week
each year these mountaineers could gather and offer such a
national attraction, unique and valuable.
   McKinney spoke to Prof. Greer of his thought, then wrote
to him, then last week-end went to hear the mountain music
festival at White Top, Va., and en route home stopped for more
than a day at Boone and visited with Greer.
   Greer, perhaps the best versed scholar in ballads of these
mountaineers and a mountaineer by birth himself with an ability
to sing these folk songs in their native manner, was enthusiastic
about the idea.
   They have talked.  Both have broached the idea to others.
Last Sunday the Asheville Citizen-Times carried a lengthy interview
with Greer on the proposition.
   McKinney has written a number of people, including George
Folsom Granberry, New York musical leader, who approved it
thoroly.  The proposal so far is only an idea.  McKinney plans
to communicate with the National Park Service to see what
hook-up can be made with their future recreational plans.  Arno
B. Cammerer, associated director of National Parks, has already
expressed his interest in McKinney's idea, and at the Appalachian
Trail Conference had urged the preservation in every way
possible of handicraft, customs, and culture of the mountain
people as a unique attraction to the Smokies.
   "Ford at Dearborn," McKinney says, is preserving the
material evidences of American culture;  the government in the
park is preserving its natural beauty.  Why should not the human
