AMERICAN SONGSTER

   A series of song books for Conscription Camps.
   Each songster represents a region: the West, the 
South, the North, and the Negro.

   Each songster contains twenty-one folk songs typical 
of the region and generally familiar to persons coming from
this region. The songs are to be arranged in four part harmony
with simple piano accompaniament and with tablature indications
for guitar and ukelele. Each songster should contain 
declarations and illustrations, if possible, one for each song
representative of the region, the art material to be of the sort
documented by the INDEX OF AMERICAN DESIGN. Each songster on the
page opposite the table of contents is to contain an excerpt from
the life and adventures of a folk hero typical of the region, and
anecdotes about him ought to be scattered through the book wherever
there is space.

The four heroes: [would be]
   For the West, Pecos Bill (or Big Foot Wallace); for the 
South, Davy Crockett; for the North, Paul Bunyan; for the Negro,
John Henry.

   The books are to be of pocket size, approximately 6 by 9 in.,
one illustration or design per page, one page for a decorative
frontispiece, one for the table of contents, one for the folk
hero and a final page for notice of other books in the series-
26 pages in all. A folder for binding the four books together
will accompany the series. This folder will have the title
"AMERICAN SONGSTER".

   The titles of the books will be:
     1. West of the Mississippi
     2. Down in the Valley
     3. From Maine to Washington
     4. Deep River
