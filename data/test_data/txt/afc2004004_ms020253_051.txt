Now, God, to some folks, is so close -- an' they're very
few, I'm tellin' you -- they're so close with the Lawd, like
Elijah was, an' diffrunt ones, ya know, so                  with God,
until they can interpretate, see.  Few things, sometime, that'll
run through, the Lawd showed me, but after that, I din't know
anything about it.  I'm not deep enough, ya know.  See what I
mean?  An' ah, so, anyway, Sister Ollie, that was the oldest
sister of my husban', well, she was talkin' to her son, but she
was hintin' at me.
     We was talkin' about how, you know, about the Holy Ghost,
how we felt an' all like that, an' he had the Holy Ghost.  He was
combin' her hair; she didn't have no girls an' he loved to comb
her hair, he would jus', act' (act) like a lil' girl.  An' he
was combin' her hair an' so, an' they was talkin'. . .
TL:  What's the unknown tongue, now?
BJ:  Jis' the spirit of God speakin' through ya.
TL:  An' ya can't do it until. . .
BJ:  Until He speaks through ya.  Tha's  right.
TL:  Yeah, but can you understand what comes out?
BJ:  No.  Ya don't understan'.
TL:  Do you mean to tell me that, if I started talking to you
right now, I would talk to you -- if I had God in me -- I would
talk to you but you wouldn't know what I was talking about?
BJ:  No.  You wouldn't, you wouldn't be talkin' to me nohow.
You'd be talkin' to Him.
TL:  Yeah, but you wouldn't know what I was talking about?
BJ:  No.  An' you wouldn't know what you was talkin' about.  You
see?  Tha's right.  An' you don't know what you're talkin' about!
TL:  How do you know the person's not daft?
BJ:  What?
