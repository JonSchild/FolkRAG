From Margery C. Quigley, Montclair NJ
Heard in Springfield Mass Aug 14 1942
Subject:  Defense Workers' Morale

"Maybe these defense workers do make a lot
of money but some of them do a lot of grousing
along with it. The husband of Helen's cook, for
instance, works at Westinghouse and he is
always saying that this discussion of coal and oil
'is all bologna'. One day he said,
"See that house. The woman who lives there is a 
defense worker. She is only fifty feet from the
bus stop, but she gets all the gas she wants and
so every evening she goes joy riding just to
use it up."
