and loved in his neighborhood,
as an entertainer
with an almost inexhaustible
repertoire of native ballads
and folk songs, and, in
spite of his gray hairs and
large family, a good
dancer of the "hoe-down"
and other traditional dances.

Our cook, Miss Nancy
Jude, from Pine Mountain School
in the same region, has heard
Abner Boggs many times, and
is enthusiastic about his singing
of folk songs in the old-
fashioned way.

Very sincerely yours,
(Miss) Marjorie Wright.
