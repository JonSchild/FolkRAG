A Program of American Music

American music today is made up of three distinct living idioms—A
folk, a popular, and an art music.
The traditions of all these three derive from Europe: The bulk of 
our folk music from the British Isles, that of our art music from the
great composers of the continent. As in the case of the American
language, the folk music has undergone sea change in its migrations
across the Atlantic.
In addition, certain other national and racial minorities have created
new hybrids, the French in the Southeast, the Spanish in the Southwest,
the Germans and the Scandinavians in the North. Above all, the
Negro has made the most distinctive contribution.
The people sang as they built a country, recalling the old and celebrating
the new. The voices of miners, farmers, lumberjacks, workers
of all kinds, their wives and children, swelled into a tide of music rich
and strange but vital and undeniably American.
Our popular music, the music of the cities, draws from the sources
of both of the other and older idioms. Today, like the motion picture,
it is an export commodity to all ports of the world.
The selections on this program are drawn from these three musical
currents and sung by persons and groups—professional and amateur—
who know and sing them best.
