Pick A Bale of Cotton
If [any rhythm could follow] the movements of cotton-picking could be adapted to any rhythm, 
this gay tune would be that one; but when a man snatching cotton sings a fast reel like this he tries rather than succeeds in keeping up with it.  If anything could help a man pick a bale (fifteen hundred pounds) of cotton in a day, the feat would be possible with this merry, swaggering air in one's ears.  In every stanza, the tremendous lie is repeated, but it is a good lie. Every cotton picker who hears it knows it never was the truth and never could be the truth, but he wishes to Christ it was so for him.  So, when he is snatching the bolls clean, he thinks of the song and believes that perhaps some magic will (this time) fill his cotton sack faster than it has ever been filled before and that at the end of the day he will weight out at a bale and the cheering, admiring crowd will carry him off on their shoulders, crowning him the king of cotton all pickers. 

In other versions of this song (see same title in "American Ballads and Folk-Songs) such lines as, 
"Massa tole de niggers to
Pick a bale-o' cotton, 
and 
Massa gimme one dram to
Pick a bale-o' cotton,"
are frequent.  We are led to believe, therefore, that "Pick a Bale o' Cotton" is a slave song, another of the old Negro songs that the Texas Prison system has kept alive, while the prisoners died.  The tune and the rhythm indicate that it was probably a reel, sung during the cotton picking season after the day's work was done.  Note it's close melodic relation to "Julie Ann Johnson." It is current especially [by] among the older prisoners, throughout the Texas penetentiary system.  Lead Belly likes it.
