Dean Briggs- JAL

2

The brain lesion was too serious for me to apportion credit at the time
for these extraordinary attentions. I lay in a sort of maze with a single thought
burning in my brain: "What will happen to my year's work when I cannot take my
final examinations?" I would go back to Texas with no evidence to present that
I had ever been to Harvard University. It was a black prospect. Maybe I told my
troubles to Dean Briggs. I cannot recall.

But very early one morning I heard a slight noise at the double doors
of my room. I heard the outside door open softly. Then I saw a paper quietly
slipped under the inside door and heard footsteps slipping away.

For a long time I looked at the slip of paper. Finally I staggered
across the room,recovered it and read: "Lomax, I have seen all your instructors
and they agree to give you full credit for the entire year's work just as if you
took the final examinations." So you are free, as soon as your physicians will per-
mit you, to go back to Texas." The paper was signed "L.B.R.B."

Years afterwards Professor Kittredge told me that he had b[e]en out that
night and that when he returned to 8 Hillard Street at 2 a.m., he found Dean
Briggs sitting on the front steps waiting for him to say that my work in his courses
had been satisfactory for the year. The good Dean could not have got much sleep
that night, for he was at my door just as day was breaking.

During my convalescence he came every afternoon and took me driving. He
missed only one day. Then he sent a note of [strikethrough] [/strikethrough] apology, begging me to amuse myself with his bicycle which he sent along by a Negro man.

I have always felt that he saved my life. From Harvard have come many great
men,but for me LeBaron Russell Briggs will always stand above all the rest.
