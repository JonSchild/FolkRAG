T.J. Johnson is 40, thin faced, and brown, 
a moustache and dark glasses, shapeless
felt hat, head-rag, very dirty. I met him
Sat. night on the street in the Negro section,
blowing his harp and shaking a little
tin can for [hi] his collection of nickles.
He has been blind since he was 16 years
old when he "had the swimming in the
head and the wagon ran across the back of 
my head - both wheels- took me a solid week
to loose your sight - "I suffered with a swimmin'
in my head when I was comin' up" When I
first lost my sight, I didn't eat nothin.' My
sister come & help me - my baby brother helped
mama. My father was dead.
He's the only musician in the family.
