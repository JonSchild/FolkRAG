REPORTS OF RUMORS - P2

"Wish they would keep the nigger soldiers out of our USO 
houses. I hear the boys are not going to stand for being pushed around 
much longer. I know they can't push me around and get away with it."
(San Francisco -- August 4th - soldier)

"I'm glad to hear that General MacArthur is going to command 
our forces when the second front's established. Hear he was now in the 
states enroute to England. He'll show the British how to get the job 
done." (San Francisco -- August 4th. Apparently business-man.)

"It isn't a good idea to jockey for a commission or a rating
in the Navy, and I'll tell you (listener) why. In the first place, guys
at the recruiting station may promise you a rating or a commission, but 
once you get in there, and they need seamen or deck-hands, the guys at the 
top simply bust you down for one reason or another until you're a seaman 
or a deck-hand. And don't think they won't either. Boy, they may tell 
you you will be a CPO or an Ensign, but if they need galley slaves -- 
you'll be a galley slave, and don't think you won't." (San Francisco, 
August 4th. Elderly grizzled ex-seaman (apparently.)

"It's a shame that Government is allowing industry and big 
business to make so much money. Look at Higgins and Kaiser, for instance. 
They'll be so rich when this is over they won't know what to do with 
their money. Maybe the Government figures it can borrow from them to 
help pay the National debt." (San Francisco -- August 5th - laborer)

"I wouldn't pay too much attention to price ceilings. They 
are going to change it all anyway. President Roosevelt is working outa 
new system for us, one that's a honey, and if it don't work they will try 
something else. Pretty soon we will all be out of business if this keeps 
on." (San Francisco -- August 5th. Businessman.)

"The Limeys are yellow cusses and stuck up. They're certainly 
learning how to run backwards, fast." (San Francisco -- August 6th - 
Cigar Merchant.)

"How do we know that Stalin's Army is doing? I'll bet Hitler
and Stalin play checkers every afternoon. They both wanted to suck the 
United States into this war; Then they'd gang up on the Allies. If not, 
why won't Russia let us put observers along his front lines? Why won't he 
let newspaper reporters cover the front, and why doesn't Russia give us 
bases along her coast line so we could bomb Japan? Just read Pearson and 
Allen's columns. They'll tell you." (San Francisco -- August 7th - newspaperman.)
