A Rumor About the White House
It is a rumor that the 
White house has nation books
 but didn't have to make a report 
of how much canned 
goods they have on hand.
Could this be true? If so 
I don't think it is fair in the 
least but, after all if they
pass a law or rulings and 
expect others to abide by it they 
should do the same themselves,
after all aren't we all suppose
to be of the same equal?
