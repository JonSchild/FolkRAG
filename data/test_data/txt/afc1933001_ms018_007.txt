Mr. John A. Lomax, Honorary Consultant in American Folk-Song, writes 
in a letter received this morning. 

"I wish to send a letter to every State, Federal, and larger 
city prison system in the United States, in search for our indigenous
jail bird songs. Would it be possible to frank such
a letter, the material to come in there to you (Where the letter 
would be dated)? And could you have the printing done for me?"

If it is possible to give Mr. Lomax the assistance for which he 
asks, I should strongly recommend our doing so.
