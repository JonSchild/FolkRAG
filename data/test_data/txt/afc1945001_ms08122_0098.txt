The efficiency of the assembly 
line is truly amazing. Even the 
Army physical exams are being 
speeded up. One doctor looks in 
one ear, another doctor looks in the 
other. If they can see each other, 
they reject the man.
You may believe it or not, but 
the story is going around that a 
detail of eight enlisted men 
were assigned to move the post
library at Camp Davis, North 
Carolina. The men carried out 
the assignment, but left one
book. It's title was: "You Can't 
Take It with You."
