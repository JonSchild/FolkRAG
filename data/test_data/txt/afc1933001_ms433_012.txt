COME AND JOIN THE UNION
Tune: Battle Hymn of the Republic

We have seen the reaper toiling in the heat of summer sun,
We have seen his children needy when the harvesting was done,
We have seen the might army dying helpless, one by one, 
While their flag went marching on.

Chorus:

Workers, come and join the Union
Workers come and join the union
Workers come and join the union
As we go marching on.

O, the army of the wretched, how they swarm the city street - 
We have seen them in the midnight, where the Goths and Vandals meet;
We have shuddered in the darkness at the noises of their feet, 
But their cause went marching on.

But no longer shall the children bend above the whizzing wheel;
We will free the weary women from their bondage  under steel
In the mines and in the forests worn and helpless man shall feel
That his cause is marching on.

Then life your eyes, ye toilers, in the desert hot and drear,
Catch the cool winds from the mountains. Hark, the river's voice is near.
Soon we'll rest beside the fountain and the dreamland will be here
As we go marching on.
