FRIEND  [UNCLEAR]
:  [Drawbridge]
LOMAX  Yes, [Drawbridge].
FRIEND  The other day when he brought [Cathy] here, a fairly young little
girl.  She is a school teacher.  I say to her, where you from?  She says Drawbridge. 
I say how far is that from [Fonbru]?  It's the same name.  Drawbridge and
[Fonbru]. . .
REED  Are the same name.
FRIEND  She did like this.  She said [UNCLEAR][LAUGHS]  And the lord made
her, [Jones wife], oh, she'd have you.  But she [INAUDIBLE] something.  I say
you smart, you a school teacher.  She's a little brunette.  [UNCLEAR]
REED  She's not too strong in that.
FRIEND  She said about three mile, Fonbru is three mile from Drawbridge,
and it's all the same, it's all the same town just that's in English, you know.
Like [Mamu] hear that, and they call that a big [mamu], [see Mamu], I got to
go a friend [and see Mamu].  Mamu is about four or five mile right here.
:  [That's number one.]
FRIEND  Now [Draw Mamu], and Mamu, Mamu Town, and [Big Mamu], and there
are about four or five [Mamus] here.  And I recognize the word from the [UNCLEAR],
with all the, you know, but half of them young people don't hear, they all seamen,
all seamen or roughnecks or. . .
:  Yeah.
FRIEND  They work on the dock.
REED  . . .all go to sheep.
FRIEND  And every time one of the [UNCLEAR] among, and they like to [INAUDIBLE],
let me tell you, they work.  [UNCLEAR] Mamu, [UNCLEAR] work, not live
[UNCLEAR] someone from out of, out of state.
LOMAX  how did Mamu get to be the way it is?  It's an amazing place.
I mean it's a kind of the capital of the Mardi Gras.  And it's the, it seems to
be the capital of Cajun culture really.  It's the center of everything.  How did
it get to be that way?  Do you know?
REED  I don't know.  It's sort of a spontaneous, the, the very
sound of Mamu I think sort of attracts, you know, culture, a certain amount of
attention.  I got a letter this week from, what's the capital of Delaware?
:  Wilmington.
REED  Wilmington or Dover.
:  Dover.
REED  Dover I think.  Well anyway, this college there is. . . .[MIKE OFF]

the story about three red devils or something?  I missed that.  You were talking
about in French.

REED From France?
LOMAX  Yeah.
REED  Oh, that [UNCLEAR], when they want to come to the United
States to be Americano, they [UNCLEAR], [FRENCH].
LOMAX  I thought I heard you talking about three red devils.  I'm a little
deaf so I may have gotten it wrong.  You were talking in French.
