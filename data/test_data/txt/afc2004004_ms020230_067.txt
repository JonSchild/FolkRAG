[*(LINING UP TO PICK ROWS)*]
BJ:    A, a job ain't never hard to get on the Lake as long as God
let the beans grow.  Ya see?  An' [ah] they ain't never hard to get
on the -- not on the Lake.  Ah, nowhere around there.  An' cane is
growin' an' beans is growin' an' one, one thing to the other
is growin'.  Ah, 'lessen somethin' come through an' destroy it.
I have went--- ah, ah, we have, ah, beans ready to out tomorra ta
pick great hampers -- ah great fields of beans, which was thick.
We have looked at it an' see how beautiful it was; we was gonna
sure be there.   'Cause you git it -- if you git there early --
ya got to git there early like I tol' ya -- an' you git your row,
sit there  on it, stay near it or have somebody; 'cause anybody
get that row, they. . . 

TL:    Did they used to fight over what row . . . 

BJ:    Oh, ah, some folks was try to take peoples, rows, ya know,
but they, they, they stop it.   'Cause the man'll line ya up, see?
Ya see?  Always somebody.  An' then, [then] ah, 'cause the rows are
long, we line up on this end, ah, as much as will, if ya fill
it out.  Then go over in the middle an' line up two lines there.
See?   Go to the other end an' line up a line there.  [Ah] Now, two lines
in the middle is this way:   You sittin' turnt back to meet me; then
sittin' turnt to meet them.  An' brother, sometimes we don't git
git them rows out in a day.  An' 500 have been in a field at one
time!   An' don't git 'em out.

TL:    Is that right?

BJ:    That's right.                     the beans been jes' that way.  I'm
tellin' ya.  They's jus' so thick an' so much beans.   An' then, it's
