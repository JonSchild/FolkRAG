Dear Mr. Spivacke:
    Not one time have I said to hurry on the machine to me.
Truly March 1 or March 15 or even April 1 would be ample time to
disturb these peaceful days of soft, springtime weather, the
nightly singing of the Fiddler Crabs, the charming fragrances of
blooming rosebuds. Take your time, look properly after Mrs.
Coolidge and don't worry about Your friend,
    John A. Lomax

I apologize for frequent letters. Alan Lomax thought my letters
to you lacked specific information.
