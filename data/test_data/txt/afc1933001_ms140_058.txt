Mr. Alan Lomax,
Library of Congress,
         Division of Music,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This will acknowledge with many
thanks your letter of December 8th in regard
to the recording we have here; we will indeed
look after them carefully and I am sure
that Mr. Greene will be delighted to know that
he will have the opportunity to use some of
them in the two remaining programmes which he
will do when he gets back from Lima.

With reference to Mr. Cooke's programmes
and the recordings which he borrowed:
I understand the series of programmes last
summer was not relayed on the Empire short-wave
schedule; it might be that future programmes
would be, but in any case I have asked Mr. Cooke
to keep you advised on this. As to the records:
they actually are all here in this office; we
were in touch with Mr. Cooke about them today
and he is coming in tomorrow to see about packing
and returning them to you.

               With renewed thanks,

                                Yours sincerely,  D CGO. Rowse
                                                 D CGO. Rowse
