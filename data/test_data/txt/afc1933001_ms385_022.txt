Colonel Steret is gratefully recalled, too, because of the five or 
six comprehensive and sympathetic articles he soon afterward
wrote about the ideals of the University and the practical fulfillment
of those ideals as he saw them actually being worked
out.  His sharp eyes and few questions returned an amazing fund of
information, and Bill Steret's articles helped the University
to tide over the stormy days that soon afterwards followed.  But
the University best remembers him as an incomparable story teller.
Here is one he told me which should be given a place in theannals  
of the State.....
"Did you know Major George W. Brackenridge of San 
Antonio?" inquired Colonel Sterett.  He was the University Regent
who would never agree to sell the University lands, who gave to 
the University Brackenridge Halls at Austin and at Galveston
for the benefit of boys and girls who had little money; and he
was the man who paid the way of so many girls through the medical
department of the University.  This is how I came to meet
Major Brackenridge.
"While I was serving as Game and Fish Commissioner for
Texas, a job that Governor Colquitt gave me, the legislature 
appropriated twenty-five thousand dollars for another fish hatchery.
I selected a site just below the Colorado Dam in Austin for a
suitable location.  There it would help to educate the thousands
of Texas boys and girls who came to the University every year.
