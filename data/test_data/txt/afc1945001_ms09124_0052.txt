Some soldiers were invited for dinner at an old 
dowager's home.  she also invited enough girls 
to entertain the soldier boys. Everyone had an enjoyable 
time during the dinner.  Madame Dowager decided that 
the boys and girls would love to sing several old folk 
songs.  She played the piano and she thoroughly enjoyed 
herself.  She, of course sang a little louder than the boys, 
and therefore she didn't hear the remark, "Just as soon 
as a push the piano top on her fingers we'll have plenty 
of dancing."

I heard a rumor that in one of those small towns 
in the south, our groups of people had to wait 
until the other group was entirely finished with 
registering for war ration books.
