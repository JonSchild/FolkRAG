ALL THE WAY HOME
AN OFFENSIVE POEM
AGAINST LYNDON'S PEACE
Lyndon flew to Hawaii
Lady Bird stayed home
General Ky had roast Cong
Dying G.I.'s had none
we
we?
WE?
WE
all the way home
Lyndon flew to Hawaii
Listen to freedom ring
"Love your enemies,"
said Jesus
And Martin Luther King
all the way home
Lyndon talked to London
Tokyo and Canberra
Has he listened to one
Draft-card burner
all the way home
Lyndon flew to Hawaii
Pacifists went limp
On our television
Everyone is camp
all the way home
Lyndon new to Hawaii
To beam upon General Ky
"This is my beloved Son
In Whom I am well pleased"
all the way home
Lyndon flew to Hawaii
On the LSD
Of Realpolitik
And saw Eternity
all the way home
Lyndon flew to Hawaii
So high he'll never walk
Baresoled and innocent upon
Our common soil
all the way home
Lyndon talked to London
Paris, Bonn, and Rome
Has he listened to one child
In Vietnam?
all the way home

BROADSIDE #70

Lyndon flew to Hawaii
An amputee flew home
We watch the war through dinner
Without shame
all the way home
Lyndon flew to Hawaii
Morse stayed home
Shouting in the Senate
Our shame
all the way home
Lyndon flew to Hawaii
V-C sharpened sticks
To fight flamethrowers
Napalm and tanks
all the way home
Lyndon flew to Hawaii
Too high for groans
Strangelove jets defend us
Children burn in the ground
we
we?
WE?
WE
all the way home

JELLIED GASOLINE BALLAD
Burn the kids and build them schools.
Promise freedom to the fools.
Give them a Dictator, tools
and jellied gasoline.
Burn the rice and teach them ag
How to vote and how to gag
the press. Oh wave the flag
for jellied gasoline.
Burn the fathers, rape the mothers.
Rape the fathers, burn the mothers.
No difference: all men are brothers
in jellied gasoline.
Burn atheistic Communists
and sneaky yellow Christless Buddhists.
Against their pointed sticks and fists
use jellied gasoline.
Burn Hanoi, Hon Gay, Haiphong,
Hoa Binh, Nam Dinh, Bac Ninh, Hai Duong,
and if necessary, Saigon
in jellied gasoline.
Burn, baby, burn, higher than Watts.
Then we'll burn the Hottentots.
Uncle Sam will call the shots
with jellied gasoline.
Burn, baby, burn, to China's wall
and on and on till all reds fall
at Uncle Sam's feet. He'll have a ball
with jellied gasoline.
Burn also the Geneva Agreements,
the Declaration of Independence,
and the U.N.Charter.What makes more sense
than jellied gasoline?
