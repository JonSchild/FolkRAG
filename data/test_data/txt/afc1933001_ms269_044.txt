this . It should be made in small towns and shipped to small town radio stations for use on their sustaining hours.

c) A program to be entitled "Our Singing Country." The story of America in terms of its popular and folk music and the lives of the people who made it. A criss-cross-patchwork of American lives in music, designed for the morning hours and housewives.

d) A program to be entitled "The Language of Freedom". The central idea of such a program [to] should be American tolerance of all languages , creeds and colors. The materials for the program to be drawn from the experience of various minority groups in America. Each program an exhibit of the the story and the culture of a national minority group [broken] with a by a dramatization of the contribution of some member of this group toward the growth of democracy in the world.

e) A program to be entitled "Their Weight in Wildcats." This program is to build the notion of Americans as fighters for democracy and as [rootin', to tin', hell-rasin'] fighting' democra[c]ts.

The program should be broken in the middle by a ten minute dramatization of the issue , perhaps a documentation of a street corner or corner grocery store dispute over the question where the issue is presented from the point of view of violently held opinion.
