Dear Allen,

Regarding the prices of the various accessories which you need, I have
obtained the following information for your guidance and hope it will
be of some help to you.

The French blanks which I was using can be obtained through Audeo Devices,
Inc. at 1600 Broadway, New York City. The 12" size costs 75[cents] and the 10"
size 60[cents].

The very small portable machine which I told you was cheaper and probably
better than the Presto, Jr. costs $135.00 complete. (This includes a
microphone although I don't know what kind.) A. W. Nieman Sound
Apparatus Company, 159 West 46th Street, New York City makes up this job
but if you are interested or know anyone else who is, be sure and get 
your order in quite a while before you definitely need it because as most
technicians are - - he is! He also handles the Neuman Cutting Head and builds custom designed amplifiers.

The sapphire cutting needles cost $3.00 each and $1.00 for sharpening.
I have not been able to get the address of that company but if you need
any right away, I will get them for you and send them down.

I am going to get a demonstration on the portable machine I just
mentioned and compare it with the best work possible on the Presto, Jr.
and I'll let you know what the results are.

I have been looking into this National Minorities business and it seems
very interesting. I wish I knew more of what was lacking. Naturally,
I am handicapped by not knowing just what you have. If anyone knows up
here, I would appreciate knowing who it is.
