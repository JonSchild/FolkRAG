Dear Dr. Spivacke:
I think that in view of the uncertainty at the moment
of our appropriations, we ought to drop from our list of
recording trips the expedition planned in collaboration with
Mrs. Tartt in Livingston, Alabama, and disencumber the amount
which is still set aside for this purpose.
Respectfully yours,
Alan Lomax
