         She didn't see 'em.  So when she came in, [in] there to dinner -
[the den?),] I was fixin' up everything else, ya know, gittin'
ready so I -- git the table all set an' everything.  Well, she
tol' me, said, "I tol' you to cook some biscuits."
         I said, "I know it."  I was jus', jus' as happy.  I said,
"I know it."
         Then she said, "Well, you can't cook 'em now, ah, ah, "Don't
you see Dr. Richert to table?  Uh, uh, is comin' to the table?"
         I said, "[Oh]Well, tha's all right."  I Said, "I'll be ready when
he get there."  Jus' like that.  I was goin' in to the other side
to get to the ice.
         An' so, an' see..."You do what I tell ya to do!...Don't you
...don't you dare talk to me like that.  You do what I say!"
         I said, "I ain' talkin' to you no way."  I said, "I have

         I said, "No you won't."  She didn't have time to say, "I'll
slap you" or sumpin'.  I said, "No, you won't."
         Well, I had started towards the stove.  And oow, umm! I

know where I was at.  I done -- whoo!  I didn't -- I

         An' she jus' look at me jus' as crazy!  I jus' walked out
an' lef' her.  Ow, I hollered when I got out in the yard; I

there.  I walked all 'round the cove an' down the railroad
