Washington, D. C. 

Dear Mr. Lomax:

We have a letter from the Griffith 
Music Foundation in Newark, New Jersey that you 
were paid direct for your engagement on October
6th.  We are surprised that you have not informed 
us of receiving a check direct as we know you must 
understand we always take steps to collect all fees
that aren't sent in to us promptly.  We are also 
surprised that you haven't sent us your check covering
the commission for this engagement. 

We shall greatly appreciate it if you
will send us your check by return mail covering commission 
for this date as well as $20. to be applied 
against your publicity account which is in accordance
with our agreement of last summer. 

With best wishes, 

Sincerely yours, 
Mary Jo Wallace
Director of Contract Division
