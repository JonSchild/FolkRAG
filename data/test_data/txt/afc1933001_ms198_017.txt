Dear Alan:
   This is in answer to your letter of May 8.  First of all
let me explain that the new Library policy about recorded materials
used for commercial publication grew out of experiences in a
non-musical field and for this reason probably did not come to
your attention earlier.  You may be surprised to learn that there
are two small companies working on library material at the present
moment who do not seem to regard the charge as unreasonable.  They
too have arranged to pay the original authors as well as the editor
of the record.  I do not know your arrangements with the Prestige
Company but it is possible that they would be willing to absorb this charge.
   The philosophy behind this surcharge is really quite
simple.  As you well know all the recordings deposited in the
Library of Congress were collected for scientific and research
purposes only.  In cases where they are used for commercial
exploitation, the Library feels that it should recover at least
a part of the cost of obtaining the material.  Where we issue
records, we do not sign exclusive contracts with the singers and 
as you know have no objection to the use of the same singers singing
the same songs for commercial records.  You may be surprised to
learn that in the case of some living poets in good health, they
have refused to read the poems again and simply referred the companies
to us and the companies have agree to pay us this charge which is
based on the time actually used on the record. (It was first
proposed that we charge $100 per side but I pointed out that sides
vary so much in length that it would be more equitable to have a
standard fee based on time.)
   I recognize your problem in the case of the two singers
who happen to be old and ill but I do hope that you can discuss
this with the company involved and that they will be willing to
