Rumor of the Merchant Marine
About a week ago in all the leading newspapers, 
there was a article of about some merchatmen
who did not want to unload there ship, because 
it was Sunday. That one rumor caused a great deale 
of truble, for the marines made a complaint about 
it to Washington, where it was taken up. A Committe 
looked into it for several weeks, and finaly 
found out it was just a rumor. For on that Sunday 
the merchantmarine-men did unload that ship 
and continue to unload there ship during a heavy 
bombing, wich some men lost there very lives. 
This all happened on Guadacanal, that 
rumor shows that talk is cheap, but sometime 
harmfull.
