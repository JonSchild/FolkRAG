[*WEST GREEN (CECIL, THE LOVER & LAZ'RUS, THE FLUNKY*]
BJ:           Well, she jus' taught me how to tap (?) myself, y'know.
TL:           How do you do that?
BJ:           Well, jus' tap myself in the particular way, in the 
right way [an' so]; what I've done; don' let everybody know your 
business; that was all; jus' kep' my business to myself. . .
               An, ah, so, after I had got there -- with 'er, ya see, I was 
a good while ov' there with her, goin' in an' out workin' -- someone, there's 
a guy that was talkin' -- askin' about me.   Different things, ya 
know, see?   An' she knew the good an' the bad, ya see.   An' she 
jus' tol' me, she talked to me about 'im a good while before I ever 
even seen 'im.   And so finally one night he came ov' there an' 
he talked with me, an' from then on he could talk with me an' she 
taught me jus' how to go.   An' I went along with that guy an' nobody 
know I was goin' with 'im.   He's a night watchman, you see.   An' 
he didn' have no wife or nothin'; didn' even live there.   See?  
Ha, nothin'!
  
[*Roosevelt*]  [*Lazrus*]
               An' there was another boy ov' there we called Roosevelt.  
His name was Roosevelt; we called him Laz'rus because he was sore 
and          his [head (hair?)] got cut.               Ha, ha, ha!  An' so 
Everybody call him Laz'rus, but he was. . .
TL:           What do you mean he was [(sober?)] sore?
BJ:           Well, he had been broke out with some kind of a poison 
ivy or somethin', an' it jus' got all over 'im, an' he was jus' 
sore then.   He didn't work; they wouldn't let him work 
then 'cause on account of -- until he got well.   An' so [he] Laz'rus 
was [always] walkin' around there.   So I got Laz'rus -- that was a 
fine boy -- I got Laz'rus [to be] for my buddy, ya see?  Laz'rus was my 
flunky.   Well, they knowed good an' well that Laz'rus wasn't 
workin'.   An' they wondered all the time how in the worl' did I get all these 
nice things an' everythin' I want.   These different shoes an' 
different [night] nice dresses.  Them dresses go for eight an' ten an' 
twelve dollars or higher.   Ya see?   Well, they know I wa'n' makin' 
no more than two-fifty ov' there where I'm workin, ya see, with 
that woman.   But I had what I want.  An' I had real money.
TL:            How did you do that, Bessie.  Did Laz'rus get it for you?
BJ:             No, no, he didn' get it for me.  But he was my flunky.  
He'd go let me know when he's (Cecil) in, at the mill, an' when I'd go 
ov' to see him -- any time I went to see him -- I'd walk with 
Laz'rus, ya see?   Ha!   If I'd go ov' to the commissary, I'd
