INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE HAY.
We had to rise at five o'clock in the morning and we were
working till about eight or nine o'clock at night. We had
all the horses to feed and all the cattle to feed after - 
Ay, in the evening you see. . . . 
     Well, we had what we called our supper here (you would
call it your tea, I suppose) but we didn't get much tea. . . .
Brose. . . .  Oh well, I was engaged at the farm when I was a 
boy at fifty bob for six months - when I was a boy of twelve
years old. And then I got up, you see. . . .
     Well, the biggest wages that ever I had as a farm
servant - you would call them farm labourers - but they
call them farm servants here, you see. . . . . Well, it was
forty pounds, was about the highest wages . . . . No, no,
just your food and your board. - your keep . . . . . They
treated you a damn lot better now, excuse me. Because
they're getting well, of course.
     This Government now, they've put up the wages and then
the hours - we never got a half-day on a Saturday or anything
of that kind. They've all their half-day money and they
have their piece in the forenoon and a piece in the afternoon.
Well, we never had anything like that.
     Oh well, some of them, there were some good places and 
some bad.
     Oh yes, if you engage for the six months you had to stay
there . . . . . . .You just went to the Court and you was fined. . . . .
(He laughs) . . . . . Oh, oh, yes. . . . . Oh, oh, no . . . . . . Oh, they
couldn't do that. No, no. No, the farm labourers here in
this country - I don't know what they're like by you, but the
farm labourers in this country now, they've a good  time now.
I tell you they've full wages about four pounds a week, you see.
