        God gave to every man two ends, 
           One to think with one to sit on;
           It's up to us which one to use
           Heads we win! Tails we lose!!

           Son:  "Father, what does war mean?"
           Father: "Hell, son, it's mostly fighting."
           Son: "Why, is it that soldiers get
                     married so much?"
           Father: "To be well fitted to fight singularly
                     after the duration"

           Teacher to Class:  "What do we mean by
           the word ralianalgation" '?
           John: "When one finds it impossible
           to buy what he wants to eat when
           he is hungry when he has his money."
           Teacher: "Then, Tom, why can't we
           get shoes like we once did?"
           Tom: "Well, Miss Jeffries, I tell you
                      the truth, folks done got too
                      darn selfish of the other ones
                      ability." Just forget about Hitler!""
