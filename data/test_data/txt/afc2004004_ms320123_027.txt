CANRAY
Well, most of the time they would play anything they could
jump, 'cause that's the only day-Mardi Gras is still pretty
much the same, that's the only day you gonna see two men
dancing with one another.  Otherwise. . .my dad used to play
something, it was something like a square dance, he would
play a little bit of that.  But he was so well known that a
lot of time he would go there and they say "Adam, play a 
waltz or something else", you know.  They liked the way he
played.  But usually. . .(plays his fiddle briefly)  And
that's another thing that's very important.  My daddy's the
only one who ever played "The Arkansas Traveller" on an
accordion.  All them old musicians will tell you that.  They
don't try but they couldn't.  (strokes his fiddle)  Another
one that's very popular for the Mardi Gras to jump around is
"Johnny Can't Dance".  (plays the tune, which lasts about a 
minute)
A. LOMAX
Does that have any words to it?
CANRAY
No.  They never sung that.

CANRAY
