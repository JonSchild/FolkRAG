COOPERATIVE YOUTH SONGS

THE CALL
(Melody - Call Me Back, Pal O' Mine)

Hear the call, slaves of toil, may
our cause be your own;
Hear the call, help to free all your kind.
Let us stand then to win, and to claim 
us our own
All we earn in the days to come.
Speed the day and the hour, feel the
thrill of your power,
Let us fight to the end of the way.
Let us help see it through with the 
work that we do
Hear the call of your kind, all today.

IF YOU DAM UP THE RIVER OF PROGRESS
(Words by E. Nesbitt. Melody - The
Red, White and Blue, Columbia, the
Gem etc.)

If you dam up the river of Progress,
At your peril and cost let it be!
That river must seawards despite you
'Twill break down your dams and be free!
And we heed not the pitiful barriers
That you in its way have down-cast;
For your efforts but add to the torrent,
Whose flood must oerwhlem you at last.

CHORUS:
For our banner is raised and unfurled;
At your head our defiance is hurled;
Our hope is the hope of the Ages,
Our cause is the cause of the World.

Whether leading the can of the fighters 
In the bitterest stress of the strife
Or patiently bearing the burden 
Of changelessly commonplace life.
One hope we have ever before us,
One aim to attain and fulfill,
One watchword we cherich to mark us--
One kindred and brotherhood still!

What matter if failure on failure
Crowd closely upon us and press?
When a hundred have bravely been beaten
The hundred and first wins success
Our watchword is "Freedom" new soldiers
Flock each day where our flag is
unfurled;
Our hope is the Hope of  the Ages,
Our cause is the cause of the World.
