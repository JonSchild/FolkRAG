THE BUFFALO

Come all you young fellows that have a mind to range
Into some foregin country your station for to change
Into some foreign country away from home to go
We lay down on the banks of the pleasant Ohio.
We wander thro' the wild woods and chase the buffalo
There are fishes in the river that's fitting for our use
And fine lofty sugar canes that yields us fine juice
And all sorts of game my boys besides the buck and doe
We lay down on the banks [et] &c.

[*doubled*]
Come all you young maidens spin us some yarn
To make us some cloathing to keep ourselves warm.
For you can card and spin my girl, and we can reap and mow
We lay down on the banks &c.

[*doubled*]
Supposing these wild indians should by chance come near
We will unite together our hearts free from care
We will march down into the town my boys and give the fatal 
blow

We will lay down on the banks &c.
