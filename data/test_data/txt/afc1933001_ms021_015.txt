Dear Sir:

On August 20, 1934, I wrote you a letter of inquiry regarding
my interest in songs and dances of the Tennessee mountains, of which I
have a collection, and am adding to it at odd times. You expressed an
interest in the work and told me of the "Archive of American Folk Song"
in your division, and suggested that I write Mr. John A. Lomax. I did
so and he replied that there was no money available then, but that a
move was being made to get aid from some of the big foundations. He advised
me to keep in touch with you at times to learn how the work was
progressing.

Will you at this time tell me of the status of the work? I am especially
interested in learning what money aid may be available for the
collection of such material.

I am enclosing some sheets which explain the projected organization
of the Tennessee Folk Lore Society. If you are interested, we should be
happy to have you or any of your friends and co-workers become charter
members. It was Mr. Lomax who suggested that I form the organization
and he will tell you, if you inquire, that I and my institution are
trustworthy and capable of making the work a success. Some of the leading
educators of this state have expressed an interest in it.

Yours truly,
J.A. Rickard
