MINUTES OF THE FIRST MEETING OF 
THE TENNESSEE FOLK LORE SOCIETY

     In response to invitations sent out by Dr. J. A. Rickard,
about fifty people met in Room 1, of the Administration Building
of Tennessee Polytechnic Institute, November 10, 1934, for
the purpose of effecting a permanent organization, Dr. Rickard
acting as chairman and Mrs. Helen Somerville Rafferty, as secretary.
The chairman began by explaining that John A. Lomax,
nationally known folk lorist, had aroused his interest in the matter
by pointing out the need of such an organization in Tennessee,
and declaring that the mountain sections of Tennessee were the
richest in folk lore of any portion of the United States.  He had 
urged Dr. Rickard to take the lead in forming such an organization.
     The meeting began with an introduction of each person present.
In addition, extracts were read from letters written to the chairman
from such persona as Dr. Charles S. Pendleton, Mrs. John Trotwood 
Moore, Miss Irene Bewley, and others,expressing a lively
interest in the formation of a folk lore society.  The chairman
then appointed the following nominating committee:  Prof. Hill
Shine, Maryville College; Prof. T. J. Farr, Tennessee Polytechnic
Institute; Miss Fannie Burr Kiser, Goodletsville Public Schools,
and instructed them to retire and consider nominees for various
positions in the society.  While the committee was at work, the
society proceeded to the consideration of a constitution for which
[had] purpose a tentative draft had already been prepared.  With
this as a basis, a constitution was put into final form  and adopted
(see constitution attached).  The nominating committee then
made its report and the society selected the following officials
to serve for the first year.  President, Dr. Charles S. Pendleton,

be the general policy of the editorial board to issue a series of 
mimeographed publications on folk lore, with perhaps some
printed bulletins when the finances of the society would allow 
this to be done.  The society by motion and second unanimously
agreed to hold the first annual meeting at Tennessee Polytechnic
Institute early in November, 1935.  The exact date to be set by
