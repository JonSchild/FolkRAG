Whoopie-ti-yi-yo--

Mr. Frank Rosengren, Bookseller, San Antonio, Texas (109 W. Travis St)
referred me to a volume of Swedish folk songs; whose title page reads as
follows:
Carl Michael Bellman: urval af Fredmans Sanger- Bacchi Ordenskapital
och Fredmans Testamente No. 15-- For Piano med fullstandig Text.
Kr. 3.75-- Stockholm-- Abr. Lundquists Musikforlag--

Mr. Rosengren called our attention to eight bars in Song No. 1. These eight
bars begin the third "move ment"; in 6/8 time, key of F, to the words:
Bacchus sjalf hans vapen molar: i rodtfalt en guldpokal;
rundt omkring ett lofverk pralar: med tulpaner och bregal.

He writes that these measures seemed familiar when he first played them
and he soon recalled that they are almost identical with the melody of 
the first bars of "Whoopie-ti-yi-yo, Git along little dogies".
(See: COWBOY SINGS by John A. Lomax)

Carl Michael Bellman lived 1740-1795). Mr Rosengren bought the voluke of 
folksongs in Sweden.
Stells Terrill Stover, a musician of Denton, Texas, verified
the similarity.
