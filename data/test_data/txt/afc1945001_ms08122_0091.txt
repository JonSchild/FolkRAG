 Here usonly in Chicago there has
been a rumor going around. It was
once a lady lost her ration book
and sent to Washington for a new one
When the letter came, before she would open it ten minutes later
there came a telegram from Washington
for her not to open the letter, and
for her to send it right back. Well
the lady got curious and open it to
find by mistake they had sent her
ration coupons for clothes. I have heard
this rumor several time and by different
people. What puzzles me is that every
time I hear it it is one of there friends
that got the clothes coupons by mistake.
Now I know all of these people couldn't 
have the same friends. Either some one isn't
telling the truth or Washington is very careless
these days to have let the same accident happen
more than once. My opinion of this
is that some big clothing stores are putting
out this rumor. My reason for this
