ORGANIZE, OH, ORGANIZE

Tune-Maryland, Oh, Maryland.

By Andrew J. Fedje, Milnor, North Dakota.

Ye farmers of this mighty land,
Organize, oh, organize!
It is a bulwark that will stand,
Organize, oh, organize!
For with the flag of right unfurled
In spite of darts against you hurled,
You still must feed this hungry world,
Organize, oh, organize!

If you would come into your own,
Organize, oh, organize!
Or be forever overthrown,
Organize, oh, organize!
Yes, everywhere, thruout this land,
The tillers of the land must stand
And be a farm united band,
Organize, oh, organize!

Firmly to stand against each wrong,
Organize, oh, organize!
Your only hope is Union strong,
Organize, oh, organize!
To break the bonds of slavery,
That bind you now from sea to sea,
And from oppression to be free,
Organize, oh, organize!

Your calling was the first of earth,
Organize, oh, organize!
And ever since has proved its worth,
Organize, oh, organize!
Then come ye farmer, good and true,
With the good of all the world in view;
The die is cast; it's up to you,
Organize, oh, organize!

The local meetings are the best place to talk over
farm problems. We must forget petty jealousies and
get shoulder to shoulder.
