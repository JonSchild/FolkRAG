Alan and I made records of the many Negro
services, where when we explained our purposes,
we were always cordially welcomed. I'm
most cases, so earnestly devout were
the worshippers that the room forgot about
the microphone. Sometimes we removed
it from the stand and carried it concealed
in the hand, though we couldn't conceal
the black cable that ran through a window
to the [ground] machine set on the 
ground outside. One Saturday night in 
the prison farm at Atmore, Alabama,
two Negro ministers (convicts) proposed
to preach sample sermons. To spur
them on I offered a dollar to the one
voted the best orator by the group
of Negro listeners. The contest proved
a failure because one of the contestants
kept turning away from the microphone
to exhort his eager heart to repentance
