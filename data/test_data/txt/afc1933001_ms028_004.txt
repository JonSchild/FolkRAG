400 East 34 St.,
Austin, Tex., 5/5/1935.

Dear Mr. Strunk:

You once proposed to send
me a copy of G.S. Jackson's
Early Songs of Uncle Sam.
Has the book not been returned by
the "Secretary of the Postmaster General"?

Our new machine is reported
to be nearly ready. We have 
our routes mapped out and are
ready to go. Our plans are now
for Alan to come to you in the 
latter part of the summer.

Sincerely always
John A. Lomax
