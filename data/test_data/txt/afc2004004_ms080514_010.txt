That although you can put down the structure of arts in books and so on, artists really have to pass on their craft themselves.  You have to show how it's done.  A musician has to - the, the apprentice has to watch the older musicians play, and absorb it over a long period of time and the painter does too.  And really, so does the writer, except that's a silent reverie through pages of print.

But the older arts, the folk arts, have always been passed down generation to generation through the older people, and ah, it just means that for mankind's whole history, whatever we have of imagination and fantasy and story and civilization has been - has gone from the older generation to the younger generation.  And ah, that's what old people have done, that's why they've been venerated and adored in great part, because in them the young people found the real treasures, the keys ah to the culture.  Ah, it takes a long time to understand a way of life, and a way of life is summed up in the arts, and at the very peak of the arts, you may not really get it until you've worked with it
