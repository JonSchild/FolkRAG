P.S.
I expect to stop at several 
out-of-the-way places. If 
I need the batteries and converter,
I'll need 'em badly. You 
might sent one battery, fully
charged, and [one] the converter;
or authorize me to buy a 
battery if I should need 
it. Do whatever you think 
best and is the least trouble 
to you.
