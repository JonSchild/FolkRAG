glad to acknowledge RIGHT, and give me the credit for taking an unsung and forgotten tune and making an American classic of it.

Mr. Lomax may be interested in knowing that my very close friend, the late Carl Engel, invited me to lunch to discuss the worth-whileness of Mr. Lomax's venture.  I enthusiastically gave my approval of the work done by Mr. Lomax and had much to do in interesting Mr. Engel towards getting a financial backing for Mr. Lomax from the Library of Congress.

I hope you will give this letter your sincere attention, Mr. Editor, and that you will help clear the muddy water concerning Home on the Range.  In so doing, I'm sure, you will greatly please ASCAP, my publishers, G. Schirmer, Inc. and me.  I think the public is entitled to the whole truth -- don't you?

Thanking you, and with best wishes, I am
Sincerely yours,
(sgd.) David W. Guion
