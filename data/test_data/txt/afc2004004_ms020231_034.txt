but, see, by tusslin' an' tryin' to git back to Sam Sweet, that
what it was.
          Anyhow, they carried 'er on down in the jail, so they say.
I didn't know it 'till I, 'till they, 'till I come out from the
show.  They come an' got Papa an' Paw.  They didn't git Bill.
I was with Bill.  I come out from the show down there.  Said
she had been, said -- No, ah, I said, "Mama said she was goin'
home."  So he said, she said, "Yeah, your mama hadn't gone home."
Said, "She done been put in, got. . ." they call it the calaboose,
"Done got put in the calaboose."  Ooow!  That thing s-scared me.
An' I wanted to know where she was.  Said, "She ain't in the
calaboose now," said, "She's gone home."  Said, "We'd better go home."
         So they all, we all hopped on the wagon.  They had cheers
(chairs) [, in the], you know, [sittin'] to set in the wagon, you know, big
ones, in most wagons.  An' ah, got there, Mama was sittin' in there.
An' so they was talkin' all about Mama.  [So I] Mama said, "I jus' wanna
git back an' [meet] beat him."
         Kraus was standin' at, at the wagon, when I got there.  An' so,
Kraus said, "Now when you see 'im, don't bother 'im no mo' now".  'Cause
she wasn' in there over 5 minutes.  'Cause Papa ran on an' tol'
Miss Susie about it.   Susie lived there.  Susie Dillon?  An' Miss
Susie. . .
AL:      Who was Susie?
BJ:      That's the owner of the plantation.  Miss Susie called 'im,
called 'im an' told 'im to turn 'er out.  So she was -- she wasn't 
there -- she hadn't got a chance to git in there an' sit down good.
She [was, she was] 's still cussin' 'bout that man.  Old Sam Sweet!
Susie got her.  Miss Susie tol' 'em to "turn 'er out!"  So they
turn [Mama] her on out. . .That what, that's what he was talkin' to her.
