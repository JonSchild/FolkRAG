1663 A (Con't.)

the band and the parade, and of course if they had ten fights
that day, they didn't have many and, of course, they would start
on one side of the street, for an instance, like the house is
at my left hand side, they would parade and go up the right
hand side and go all around to the next block and then come
down the left hand side to get to the place. And there would
be a grand opening right there and the band would play in front
of the place while everybody marched. And the boys would go in
and, of course all, the organization would get their food and
their drinks first, and they're drinking and having a hell of 
a time right there and there might be a big fight before they
get out of there - there wouldn't be no argument. And when they
would get through, then the band would drink--they would have
enough to drink at that time.
     Question: How would they talk in those fights, Jelly?
Give us an argument.
     Morton: Well, for an instance, an argument, well--I'll 
tell you, it's a tough thing. One guy would say, "Get the hell
out of here. Where do you get that stuff at? You don't belong
in here." "Who said I don't? Why, I live in this
neighborhood." Say, "I don't give a damn if your mammy lives
in here. You gonna get out of here." Said, "If you don't,
you black son-of-a-bitch, I'll knock your brains out." And it
would start on like that and pretty soon, fists would be flying.
