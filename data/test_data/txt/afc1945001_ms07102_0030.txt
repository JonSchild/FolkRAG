August 7:  There are too many different reports coming out of Washington.
If they would only get together on the rubber situation. I think our people
will be able to accept an ultimatum if they understood clearly exactly what
was what. There is still so much confusion and so many questions in our minds,
that is so far as the public is concerned. There are so many different ideas
in various parts of the country. Political pressure is put on in various
parts of the country and it creates confusion to everyone. The same is true
with the draft. I don't care if I am drafted, but I don't know where I stand.
I can make no sensible plans at all. [*Ogden, Utah  63*]
