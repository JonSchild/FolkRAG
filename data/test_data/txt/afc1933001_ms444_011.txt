Dear Mr. Lomax, 

It is a pleasure to grant your request for permission to reprint
the Whitefield broadside from American Broadside Verse.  I presume you have
also written to the Yale University Press. I am sending your letter to 
them,  stating that I have given you my personal permission. 

I shall watch eagerly for your book. 

Sincerely yours, 
Ola E. Winslow
