Dear Chick:

I understand that it will be impossible for you to be paid for the 
dubbing, according to our first arrangement.  It is against the law for 
the Library to pay wages for outside technical help.  Therefore, send 
me one more estimate - just an estimate this time - for the price of 
the completed duplicate, this including the cost of the blank itself.  
This should, I feel, not exceed a maximum  of $1.25 a record.  I should 
appreciate your sending me this estimate as quickly as possible so that 
we can begin work next week.

With best regards, I am 
Sincerely, 

Assistant in Charge
