Oscar Holden, clarinet and piano.  Saw him in Chicago first in 1912.  Not
hot.(1918 latter part.)  The place (Patricia) didn't do so hot.  They didn't
understand American style of cabarets.  JR pulled out and went to the Regent
Hotel. ( Doc Hutchinson, drums, Baltimore, not hot, but good drummer; Horace
Eubanks, East St. Louis, clarinet, hot man, learned around St. Louis and
from New Orleans boys, good musicians, $50,000 to get him across; two others).
Patty Sullivan who owned he Regent, a big gambler. JR would go along.
(Left N. W. last time in 1919 Christmas).  Eubanks left in charge of the
band, pulled his stand up high, pointed his finger at the drummer. "You
the first man to go.  You miss abbeat- look out men, Le's go".  Drummer
threatened to leave.  JR had to tell Horace he was demoted but Horace took it
as a joke.  " If I'm going to be a leader, I'll be a leading son of a gun." 
Horace brought his wife with him.  The Regent did a hell of a business and
though other places began to bring bands in, Horace quit in the holidays
and went with another band.  Picked up a saxaphone player out of Denver
named Hall and put him in Horace's place- wasn't hot.  Couldn't fill his
place.  Had a lot of trouble getting men across the line because of opposition
of Canadian Nwsc. Union.  Jelly Roll broke the barriers.  Got in
touch with W[e]ber and threatened to have all the Canadians thrown out of U.S.
Business slacked up the summer time and Anita and JR who had been 
keeping a rooming house got restless and wanted to leave.-  Went to Alaska
for a vacation.  Anita, JR and gog stopped in Prince Rupert.  Policeman
asked JR to leave town because he was well dressed- caught the next boat-
went toJunean and other places- swell time for three months- nearly fell
in the ocean, can't swim.
