puppet master wins & we all die. The
audience said nothing, clapped
twice & went out into the
grey, smoky, lonely coal town
night without a word - heading
for the bus, leaving the actors
cursing backstage. Frantic
at all the work for nothing
Joan L. burns with greatness
& humanity. Ewan is a bit of
an eccentric Scot, but in a
year or two more he will be
a great man. Young weary
heroes living in the back of
a great green truck which 
carries their set & barnstorming
because they believe in 
theatre & truth. They have
changed my lives. More
later.
