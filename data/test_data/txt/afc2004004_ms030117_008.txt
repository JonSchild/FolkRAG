XII  contd  -  Imagination (wonderful)
Dreams of love - 
Satisfied love is everything
Some people  harder to satisfy than others
Desc. of a man overdoing in love 
By seeking god, you find your mate
Sin is a colic -
a death colic 
Trouble in man comes from getting
the thing you want, not what 
God wants you to have.

XIII Story of Ahab & Jezebel
Palms of your hands dirty.
Don't be greedy in love.
Children affected by feelings of
mother at time of intercourse
The orgasm  
[sin & la] No sin to ask for it
Keep children from  knowledge of sex.
Mother not to talk to son
father " " " " [not to talk to] daughter
Put child away in farthest room
so it won't overhear.

XIV Children notice by 12 months 
If they know too early, they'll disgrace you
Put paregoric - make sure they sleep -
small cabins
By 12, they can keep a secret.
