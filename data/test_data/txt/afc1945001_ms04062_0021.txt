"The Air Force is in a bad way for officers. These non-commissioned men won't go to officer's school because it costs too much for uniforms and they're making more money as sargeants then they would as second lieutenants. They're just not taking the officer's schooling when it's offered to them. They're going to start sending privates to officer's school three days after they're inducted. if you can get the Air Force to request you, you can go to officer's school three days after you're in."
