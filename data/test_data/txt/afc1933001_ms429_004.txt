CAMP SONG

(Entered for Song Contest)
Tune: Solomon Levi

We are the Union Juniors and we'll help to save the day,
We've gathered here at camp this year
In the good old Union way.
At camp we make acquaintances and greet them with a smile,
And try to make our sojourn here a week that is worthwhile.

CHO:
Oh, Union Juniors, Learning to organize,
Oh Union Juniors, helping the Union to rise.-oh,
We'll gather by the campfire bright and sing our Union's fame,
While Union members gather in and help to praise its name.
The Juniors all co--operate and always do their part,
To make each day a memory to treasure in their heart.

WHAT THE UNION MEANS TO US
Tune: Just Before the Battle Mother,

Just what "Babe Ruth" means to baseball,
Just what "Tiffany" means on rings,
Just what "Home-Made" means to piecrust,
Also "Heinz" to pickled things.
Just what "Sterling" means on silver,
Likewise "Packard" on a bus,
And what "Bunte's" means on candy,
"Farmers Union" means to us!
