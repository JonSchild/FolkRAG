to church."
That man, the gambler, was teaching the children. Hm, Hm! We find
lots of things that would surprise us, going out like that, you know, way out
in the [wilderness[ rurals sometimes.
A: People sort of {brutalized?) about their experiences. They just
don't care anymore.
R: They just don't care. Well, they forget Well, they don't have no one to preach the
Gospel to them. they don't see anything but something wrong, [There] Wherefore,
they forget about ...that's why [I didn't] they did need the
preacher [then] there.
Now, then, I continued, you know, going and preaching. Finally [The] Baptist
denomination, they [just] kinda took [awhole] holt to me because of faithfulness [ my face, I
guess]. and they made me a Sunday school missionary. Why then, I
travelled around and got acquainted. So pretty soon a church, a little
church called me, it [probably] had six members....Well, I taken the [t? to] church,
and I was ordained [all day] there. And I run a revival [little while] there and I
taken about eighteen people, and I had a minister to baptize [them] um
for me, to be my pastor, and I made me some deacons & things and got
going. and I'll tell you about that - I belonged to the Bethlehem
Baptist Church at that time and they refused to recognize the
call [that] and ordain me. And I had a dream, and in the dream I
went down [to] in a kind of a [wal?ing] swampy place and there was a stream of
water. And I walked around that steam, and sometime there would
be nice clear holes of water and then [right there, they'd] where it would run over,
you know, and there'd be a little stream with muddy roo6s and things
stagnant [running] in it. And I'd find another clear hole and it would go
like that, and I looked up along the banks -- it was high banks-
and I'd see [see the] cedar trees toing. I went up and got one of those
cedars [seeds], and I carried it down in the south part of town, and I set it
out where [there wasn't any tree' that was in a dream, and it grew and flourished.
