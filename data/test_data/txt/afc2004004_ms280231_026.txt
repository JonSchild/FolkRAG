Prickle Holly Bush:
1)  Hold your hand dear Judge,
O stay some little while,
For I think I see my mother a-coming
Al over yonder stile.

2)  Dear mother any gold
Or silver to set me free?
To kep my body from the cold clay ground
And my neck from the gallows tree.

3)  No, I've no gold,
Nor silver to set you free,
For I am come for to see you hung
Alone on the gallows tree.

Refrain:
O the prickle holly bush
That picks my poor heart sore,
And if ever I get out of the prickle holly bush
I'll never get in it any more.
