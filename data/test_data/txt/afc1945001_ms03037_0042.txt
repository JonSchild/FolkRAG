#8 - Missouri

down on the job in this war effort. (From a workman in a
private factory working on war contracts).

Kansas City, Missouri, August 12 - The farmers and 
labor union people seem more interested in how much they can
make out of the war than in worrying about the lives of our
boys who must face death on the firing line before this war
is over. Both the farmer and the city worker are better off
than they have been for years, yet both are demanding more
and using pressure methods to get it. We need more sacrifice
at home to win this war. (From a woman volunteer of a Civilian
Defense organization.)

Liberty, Missouri, August 12 - The farmers are
willing to do their share to keep up production for winning
the war. They don't mind working from sunup to sundown seven
days a week. They are used to it. But it gripes us to
hear about these defense workers demanding time and one-half
and double time for overtime work. They ought to be glad
they are not having to shoulder a gun in the front lines.
(From a Clay County, Mo., farmer who served in the army 
in World War I).

Kansas City, Missouri, August 12 - It looks like the 
British are going to have their hands full with insurrection
in India. They always seem to have some side issue to settle
