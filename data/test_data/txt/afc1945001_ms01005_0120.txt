THERE IS A RUMOR THAT THE REAL PURPOSE OF 
MR. WILLKIE'S TRIP IS TO START THE 
GREATEST POSSIBLE AGITATION FOR A SECOND FRONT. 
THAT ONLY A SMALL MINORITY OF BRITISH WILL 
BE EMPLOYED IN SUCH AN UNDERTAKING; THAT THE 
CASUALTIES WILL BE TOO GHASTLY FOR WORDS, 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE ALIBI THAT 
THE PEOPLE ASKED FOR IT. 
                                                          TIME WILL TELL.
