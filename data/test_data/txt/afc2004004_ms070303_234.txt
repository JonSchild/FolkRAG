Brown Haired Alan

By H Alan, my treasure & my
     name?
Stoc & dear I paid for rent
Not cows in calf, not white sheep
But the blood spilt by the boat
My father was on it and my
     three brothers
And the darling of my body whom I
     would
But that is not what altogether
     tormented me
But [M] the [MacClean] MacLean of the fair white
     chest
Who brat me from Clachan on Tuesday
Little gull of the sea, gull that
     swims every port
