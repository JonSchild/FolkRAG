SOLIDARITY                -11-

(Tune: "Battle Hymn of the Republic"
Page 166 - Old Favorite Songs.)

When the Union's inspiration through the worker's blood shall run,
There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun.
Yet what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one?
But the Union makes us strong.

Chorus:    Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
For the Union makes us strong.

It is we who plowed the prairies, built the cities where they trade,
Dug the mines and built the workshops, endless miles of railroad laid.
Now we stand, outcast and starving, 'mid the wonders we have made;
But the Union makes us strong.

Chorus:    Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
For the Union makes us strong.

They have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn,
But without our brain and musclenot a single wheel could turn,
We can break their haughty power, gain our freedom when we learn
That the Union makes us strong.

Chorus:    Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
For the Union makes us strong.

In our hands is placed the power greater than their hoarded gold,
Greater than the might of armies magnified a thousand-fold,
We can bring to birth the new world from the ashes of the old,
For the Union makes us strong.

Chorus:    Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
For the Union makes us strong.
