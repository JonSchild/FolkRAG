this big house & died after dictating his
life story to his [?] folklorist [?]
and stood in the road talking with me
while Robin bounced on the road in the sun
& melting snow and took photos on
her broken Kodak like a fisherman
casting with no hook on his line.

any other cottage - the cooking was done 
in winter at the chimney corner in the
kitchen
