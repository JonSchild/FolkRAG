MABEL HILLARY
The voice of Mabel Hillary rings strong with the woman's blues.
She sings of red clay, dusty Georgia, and the men that work the
land.  It's been a long time since a good woman's blues was heard.
The bitter-sweet voice of the old South has just about given way
to the low-down, dirty, gravel voice.  But Mabel hasn't forgotten
how it feels and her style is as true as her words.  Nor has she
forgotten the spirited tradition passed down to her by a family
of singers and dancers.  She raised her six children on the rich
lore of east Georgia- the fantasy songs, games, plays and dances
of Negro children for generations.  And the church is part of her
life, too, her repetoire including the most moving of the spiri-
tual and gospel music.  When the integration movement started to touch
her people in Georgia, she began to compose songs for the new
freedom.  She has sung with the best in the country - the Georgia
Sea Island Singers, John Hurt, Sonny and Brownie, Barbara Dane,
Fannie Lou Hamer, and Guy Caravan.  Now she is in the field working for
the Newport Folk Foundation on its most important project, the
revival of the grassroots tradition in the South.
