Reverend Roe.  Reel 14.  P. 1
[*Roe ??? fighter in his community when he was a boy*]
I haven't always been as I am now.  When I was a young man, I would
fight anybody that bothered me, anything, man or animal; I just didn't
[care] ????.  And I never bothered anybody[; I] and never give anybody any [cause] call to
bother me.  I had several fights with white boys in a place where it
was dangerous even to insult one.  But I was always in the right,
and I never was bothered about it.  I'd defended myself because I believed
I had a right to, but I never imposed on no one else.
A:  Well, weren't you afraid the whites would gang up on you?
R:  I didn't think [much] about that, I didn't think about that.  I just
[felt] thought whatever come, I'd take care of it as it come.  It was just in my
mind; I was just brave and wasn't afraid of nothing.  I don't know just
-- I can't understand myself [as] since I've gotten older and looked back on
the dangers through which I came, the [way] places where they killed our people--I've
[I remember once in] even been driving my wagon along at night, and the man's foot
would almost touch my head, I'd look up, he'd be hanging over my, and
that didn't scare me.  I said, "Well, they won't do me that way."  I
don't know why I had that i-dea, but I [believed in] thank God [,] that I did
because if I didn't I'd a been scared out of my wits.  So I kept myself
in that position, you know, that I could always demand the respect of
all, both white and colored, and everybody always spoke well of me. [I] Never
bothered nobody, and because I'd fight, they just said I didn't have
good sense, and they just wouldn't bother me.
[*Whites accept him*]
And then the white boys, you know, I'd run with them, I'd run with the
white boys, we'd wrestle, we'd box together, and there wasn't ???? man,
white or black, in our country round there, [but what ho could wrestle] that was my equals,
[or be a boxer.] wrestling or boxing.  I was just the best man, and they all just knewit, and
they felt whichever side had my protection, why, they thought they had something.
And some of those white bo s would take up for me just as quick as they
would [for] one another.  And even the white women there would speak up
for me.  I just lived amongst them, and I lived a gentleman; I lived
