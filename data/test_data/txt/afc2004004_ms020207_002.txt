There are signs in the sun
That their Judgment have begun.
Sun, moon and stars appear like never before,
There is strange things [and]in the land
Seem like [it didn't] men don't understand
But we konw 'tis God's hand - 
[*chorus*]
He's coming soon,
Coming soon,
He's coming soon,
Although His coming may be morning, night or noon,
Night or noon;
Strange thing down here below
[Til] Tell He's coming at your door
So that all men may know He's coming soon.

You Reads in Daniel, twelfth and four,
See men running to and fro,
Seeking knowledge as they pass [be]-long [away] the way 
But God's children who will obey,
Who will [walk] watch, fight and pray,
[Should all] Shall go home to live with Him.
[So have faith in, have], Some happy day Coming soon,

A: Reverend, when did you compose that?
R: Oh, that's been twenty, some twenty years ago.
A: Beautiful song. How'd you come to compose it, do you remember
the circumstances?
R: Well, I don't just remember that, exactly, but I know generally I compose
my songs at night. I'll be laying down, you know, and just thinking,
