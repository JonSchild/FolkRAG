(1) That ain't it

A soldier walked around camp and people or officials thought he was crazy.
Everything he came to he would say, "That ain't it". So finally the 
officers decided to discharge him. When he went into the office
and started saying, that ain't it, they knew then he was crazy. 
They handed him his discharge papers and he hollered "That's
It." He was put back in the army.

(2) The Blind Soldier

There was a blind soldier who came to take his final examination. 
The doctor placed cards before him and he couldn't see a thing.
So finally the doctor asked the nurse to walk pass with out her
dress on. The soldier didn't budge or fudge. He asked her to remove 
her clothes down farther. Still nothing happened. Finally she walked
in naked. The doctor said maybe you can't see anything brother but
your indicator is pointing straight to Fort Knox. Next please.

3. Toast to Hitler!

Here's to Hitler as powerful as he is,
And here's to Uncle Sam as powerful as he is,
But as powerful as Hitler is and as powerful as Uncle Sam is
Hitler isn't as powerful as Uncle Same is, as powerful as he is.

4. Nazi dogs read & run
If you can't read run anyway
1. Get out of this U.S.
2. Take all your treasonous ways with you.
3. You served your God & go to hell & we'll
serve our God above and live well 
and happy.
