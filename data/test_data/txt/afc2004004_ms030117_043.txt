Ever time a woman call me what them two call me, I'll hit anothah
one.  Sh e called me a god-damn lyin son of a bitch an I
knocked huh down. . .You wouldn't know huh.  I was kina chippin around.
     (Th at must have been in your sinful days, Rev. Davis?)
     That's right. . . That's right. . .
     (This song, "Cocaine Done Killed My Baby," did you learn
that back in your sinful days?)
     Yeah.  I learnt stuff like that. . .Oh well. . .You don't
have to worry bout the words.  You got the song.  (Later he sings them.)
     (Do you think the words are too sinful to sing now?)
     I wouldn't sing em fur nothin. . .(laughs)  I used to be
a bird.  Ain't no use anybody tellin me to come back tomorrow!  What
I come fo is comin today!  I used to be the terriblest somthin.
I'd haint one of em to death, I'm tellin you the truth.  Ef--ef--ef-ef
I foun out she liked me to the least bit, that jis settle it.  An I could
talk, too.  I ain't never been a niggah -- I ain't nevah been a MAN
too proud to talk fo what I want.  (This is the only time he uses the
word nigger in the interviews.)  I nevah have met a woman in my life
that I couldn't ast huh fo what I wanted. . .I didn't do nothin bad.
I was jist a man, like anothah man, that liked women.  Only one thing
I hate about a woman.  You know what tis?  Because they ain't anothah
one!
     (Do you think it's more happy to have several women, or
many women, than to have one that you like especially?)
     Do you want me to tell you the honest truf?. . .You
don't have to have em all.  All the engines don't be used.  But keep
em standin on the yard.  In case of e-mergency.  If one breaks down,
you git the other one.  Or sometime, git holt of one, you don't know
when she gon cut up, you understand. . .?  Man feel bad h e got jes one
