Roll 19   Mr. Witt   Tobacco Farmer   p. 1
AL:   This hillside tobacco patch in the Smokeys in Madison
County reminds me of the old stories that used to talk
about how the hill were so close together you had to pry
[th]them open for day to break.   The hillside farms were so
steep that the farmer didn't have to do anything to get his
pumpkin patch; he'd just plant them in a row up and down
the hills and just pull the plug out of the bottom, and
they'd all roll out of the field.   Did you ever hear those
stories, Mr. Witt?
Witt:   Yeah.
AL:   Must be pretty hard goin' straight up and down.  They
have mules in this country with the legs short on one side,
don't they?
Witt:   Yeah, all of them short on one side!   And the 'taters,
they plant them up and down the[y] hill, you know.
AL:   Alright, and what happens?
Witt:   Well, they pull a stop at the bottom, and they roll out!
AL:  Is this your land, way back, your folks?
Witt:  Well, it's been my land 'bout 20 years now, I bought
it about 20 years ago.
AL:   But your folks have been in this country a long time,
I reckon. . . 
Witt:   Well, they've been in  (unint.)  for years, I guess.
I guess they've been in (unint.)  60 or 70 years, maybe
