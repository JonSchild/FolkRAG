Dear Mr. Lombard: 

Thank you for your letter of February 27 and your
interest in the Georgia Sea Island Singers.  As of
this date, the group will be available at any time
in October and November, 1964 that is convenient
to your schedule.  The terms for the group of five
people would be $5,000 for three weeks with the
understanding that they will pay their own transportation
to and from Minneapolis only, plus their
own room and board during the tour.  In this regard,
I would appreciate your suggesting inexpensive but
comfortable places for them to stay throughout the
tour.  The group cannot perform more than five concerts
in any one week, and this provision should
be part of their letter of contract.

If these suggestions do not in any way match the budgetary
norms of your area, and if you would explain to
me why, we will consider negotiating the matter.

I would also like to use this opportunity to bring 
an accompanist of the stature of Mississippi John
Hurt into the group.  This would cost an extra
$1200 for three weeks.

I look forward to hearing from you in this regard.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
