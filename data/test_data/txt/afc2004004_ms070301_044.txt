May 2 -
Dinner with Haiesh and 
Seanes - remarkable and melancholy 
conversation about the depopulation of 
Ireland. 8 million people 100 
years ago, now 2 million.  Famine, 
emigration.  Why?
No work
Why does gov?
It would be too cruel to hold 
them if they could find nothing for 
them to do.

A yg man can't marry so he 
emigrates.  My own family - [8] 6 
children.  Only 2 married, the 
two girls in London.  I'm going 
to New York.  My brother in the 
can for homosexuality.
