Dear Alan:
Since I am not too busy to drop you a postcard, I will 
do so -- as soon as I find a postcard.
I am glad to hear that you are thinking of getting to
work on the Jelly Roll book again. Before anything can be
done at this end, however, you will have to write a formal
request to Harold who knows more about the status of the
material than I do.
Meanwhile, we are sending you under separate cover the
two bound sets of scripts of "Back Where I Come From" and the
"CBS School of the Air", which you requested.
Your folk song series for the army sounds exciting and
I hope you will tell me more about it. Willard Lampbell was
supposed to drop in here this week but evidently got sidetracked.
Earl Robinson wrote me recently for a copy of a long-meter
hymn recorded by you in the Mt. Sinai Baptist Church but I was
unable to locate it. I did find one by Rev. Ribbins but it
does not answer Earl's description, according to which separate
voices could be heard as the microphone was moved. Can you
give me any more clues?
It is good to hear that you are such a happy family. I 
thought as much when I saw you.
With best wishes from all of us to you and Elizabeth,
Faithfully,
B.A. Botkin
