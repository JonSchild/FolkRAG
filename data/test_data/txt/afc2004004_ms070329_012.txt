David Burgess.  A sailor's wife a sailor's star shall be
Yo ho my lads, yo ho my lads.

There was a frog lived in a well
I own Kitty Malone
There was a frog lived in a well
Kitty Malone and I.




TOWNSHEND, WEST - VERMONT

Mrs. J. Starr  The snow was fast a -falling
And the winds did loudly roar
Whe[n a] poor little boy most frozen
Came up to a lady's door.

Aunt Jemima climbed a tree,
She had a stick to boost her;
And there she sat a-firing cabs
At our old bob-tailed rooster.

Mrs. R.E. Ballantine

O carry me to the prairie,
Roll the sod o'er me

Ethel DeCelle Rock-a-bye- my little owlet

Mrs. Raymond Howe:  Down by the weeping willow
Where the wildest violets bloom
