PICK A BALE OF COTTON

Oh, babe,

Jus' me and my wife,
Pick a bale of cotton,
All day long,
Pick a bale of cotton.     (3)

When I pick my cotton, 
Pick a bale of cotton,
Gonna carry it to the gin, (REFRAIN)
Gonna pocket my money,  (REFRAIN)
An' I'm comin' back home,  (REFRAIN)

Jus' me and my wife,  (REFRAIN)
All day long,  (REFRAIN)
Oh, babe,  (REFRAIN)

the singers pretending they have sacks on their backs
and are picking cotton an filling the sacks.
