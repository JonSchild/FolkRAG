Conversation between two stenographers in an office building:
"Do you know Joe Dokes?"  "Yes, what's happened to him?"  "Oh, he
is a member of the armed forces now.  He got an officer's commission."
"How in the world did he get an officer's commission? -- he hasn't
any military training."  "You don't have to have any military
training.  If you are the editor of a newspaper or if you have
plenty of dough or if you have a famous family name you can always
get to the right people.  It is the average guy who must fight the
war because he will be a private or just a sailor.  The smart boys
who have been to Harvard have their papas fix things up for them
so that they will be officers."  "Do you know anyone else besides
Joe Dokes who was able to get a commission?" She replied, "Plenty."
(This type of rumor heard two to three times a week for the past
three months).  [*24   Denver. Colo   8-6*]
