"FACT--This is one version of probably the most
widespread, persistent rumor that has been peddled 
around town since Pearl Harbor.  For the
past two months it has sprung up with reference
to dozens of draft boards.

"Sometimes it appears in an Italian neighborhood 
and at others in an Irish.  One variation
is for a Protestant woman to appear to a Catholic 
priest, who then intervenes and is rebuffed
by the draft board.

"Its inexhaustible variations alone show how fantastic 
the rumor is.  According to one, received
recently by this paper 110 inductees in one section 
staged a two-day sit-down strike until they
forced their board to call a larger percentage
of Jews.  No such incident could be traced.

"In an Italian section, the draft board was
supposed to have been closed after the priest
from the Church of our Lady of Guadalupe complained 
of favoritism.  The pastor of the Church
repudiated the story as a complete falsehood.
The fact is that 80 percent of that particular
board's registrant's are Italians, so its percentage 
of Italian inductees is naturally high.

"Another common version, involving the alleged
fist fight between a priest and draft board member, 
centers in another section.  Here the church
is invariably mentioned as the Church of the Good
Shepherd.  This last week it was retold in a postcard 
addressed to the Mayor of City Hall, and in
a letter received by this paper from a shop foreman 
who said that 300 workers in the shop are
talking about it.  Both referred to the Church
of the Good Shepherd.

"Inquiry at the Church of the Good Shepherd
brought a reply from the secretary to the pastor, 
that 'there was no truth whatsoever to the
story.'  The rumor has been going around the
neighborhood for weeks, she added.

This newspaper also inquired about these rumors
at the Chancery of the Archdiocese.  The vice
chancellor told this paper that the chancery
has heard of them and stated that 'there has
been absolutely no verification or confirmation
of any of them.'
