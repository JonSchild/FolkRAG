[*(INFIDELITY - REASONS WHY BJ OBJECTS TO)*]

BJ:      No-o.  'Cause I ain't gonna be there.
TL:      Well, did you ever get with one and have them treat you
mean an' you get up and leave them?
BJ:       No.   Well, no, not, not treat me mean.   But if I find out
that they lil' bit in a way that I don't, that I ain't gonna put up
with, I let 'em alone.   You see?   An' then I tell them.   I don't 
care what they did.   It could be littler than they think it is.
'Cause some folks, some folks do great things to you an' think
it's little.   Because they did it for other folks an' they liked
it.   Ya see?   Ya see?   They did it to other womens an' they
liked it.   An', an' ta me to think I oughta like it, too,    Ya see ,
I jus' don't like it an' I letcha know I don't like it.   "Now,
you stay away from here, or either sumpin' gonna happen."   Ya
see what I mean?   An' so, tha's all.   And that end that, too.   Then
I put somebody else between them.   Tha's all.   That's all's to
that.   An' I be meanin' that, see?   An' so, an' ah, that's all.
That's why I ain'. . .I wouldn't stay there, no-o.   I'm not gonna
stay there scared.  I don't wanna be with nobody I'm scared of.
TL:       What is the worst thing a guy ever did to you, Bessie?
BJ:       Well, ain't nobody done anything to me, but jus' sometime,
if I be along with somebody an' I see they fleshy, with this
woman or that woman, an' ah, I'm not worried [with] about him with the
woman.   But I worry about me.   Me has been always been me.   Ya
see?   Now, him an' [thea] that woman is all right, for my part, ya
see, but what. . .I figure that woman [flesh] flirts [? flush ?] with
him an' knew that I got 'im; she flirts flush with another
man, too. . .
TL:       What's (flushy?) ?
