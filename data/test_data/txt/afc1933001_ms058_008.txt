Mr. John A. Lomax,
Publisher cowboy Songs & ballads,
Alamo Hotel, Austin, Texas.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have your letter 5/7/39.
In RE: Washington trip, also expenses...... I understood
that it was the proposition made by them and not the cowboy
singers, who wanted the expences paid, in other words, it was
the proposition made by Mr. Dornbush in his letter to Mr. H.W. -
Broome, dated April 3, 1939, quote: "All costs of the trip
including travel both ways and expenses in Washington will be
assured to the performers", unquote.

I can give you:
" OLD PAINT"
" Jack o'diamonds"
" Dying cowboy" --- Bury me not on the 
lone prairie & ect.
