Dear Sir:

I realize that it is hard for you to understand why we are paying
no more for the use of your song. The reason is this - these are our
first records. They are going to be sent to South America to make
friends for us there. Then they are going to be used in schools to
teach American folk songs. There will be no profit or money made from
these records in any sense and, as a matter of fact, the issuance of
these records is costing the U.S. Government a considerable amount of
money. As a patriotic American I feel that you should participate in
this important governmental activity by allowing us to use your song
for the purposes as indicated. Yours is the only record which is being
held up and you are causing this project a very serious delay.

I hope that you will agree wit me that allowing us to use the
material will be of sufficient benefit to the welfare of the U.S. that
you will sign your release and return it to us at once in the enclosed
airmail envelope. This is the first time that American folk songs and
particularly American negro folk songs have ever had their real chance
to be heard. Please do not do anything to prevent this, and answer me
at once.

With sincere good wishes, I am

Yours very truly,

Alan Lomax
Assistant-in-charge

P.S. There must be some mistake about the payment of $10.00.  $4.00 is
absolutely all we can pay for a song as short as yours.
