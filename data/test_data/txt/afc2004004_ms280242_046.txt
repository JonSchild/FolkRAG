Lomax: Were you mad at him at the time?
Davy: Well, I was, but it was for my own good.
Lomax: How long did he beat you?
Davy: He beat me about an hour with a big leather belt with a 
big buckle on it.
Lomax: Hit you with the buckle as well?
Davy: Mostly with the belt. But I got it for my own good.
Lomax: It left some marks on you?
Davy: It did. But I wouldn't give in.
Lomax: You wouldn't give in? What do you mean?
Davy: I wouldn't cry out. I would rather suffer the pain. So it
learnt me a good lesson.
