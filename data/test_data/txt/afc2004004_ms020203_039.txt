Vera Hall, reel 3, page 14.
But she was a grown young lady when she was playing, because
if I'm not mistaken, she was married in that same year, a long
about the last of that year round Christmas time, she married
I think.  She was a grown young lady.  But she never did say
anymo about that hip botherin' her no mo until after she
was married about three years and then she would get to the
place that she would get down and she couldn't hardly get up.
And finly she got to the place till she couldn't hardly nuse that
that leg wjust went palyzed like on her.  She wasn't much count
after she married.  She work purty hard after she got married.
Cose she worked hard at home but she worked harder after she
got married.  She still worked in the field.  She had more
to do after she got married cause we'd all do the washin
If one 'd wash the other'n 'd i'on.  If one had to go to the field
the other 'n there would wash.  So after she married, she had to
wash ion and cook and do evthing hersef.  And my mother said
she believed the reason her leg start to failin on her she
just had so much work to do.
Woman has a terrible lot to do on the farm!
Oo!
Think she has more to do than a man does?
I know she does.  Because he only has one thing to do and
that's get up and wait for his breakfast and sit down and eat
his breakfast and go on out and catch his mules and go
on to the field and hitch up and go to plowing'.  Plow till
twelve o'clock, feed his mules, and sit down under a tree
