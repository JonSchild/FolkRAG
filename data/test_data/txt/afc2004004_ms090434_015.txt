PAGE FOUR THE CLARKSDALE

Charlie Hills Sez:
Let's Talk Sports

Former football players with Clarksdale High School
are doing right well with Uncle Sam's armed forces in
various sections these days.
Latest to be heard from in Johnny Tarzi, flankman
with the Wildcats, who is now at San Diego, Calif., as
a member of the United States Marines. the lad has
won highest honors on the pistol range with a series of
bulls' eyes that make him the envy of the camp at San
Diego. And, he's been doing right well with the rifle, 
too.
All this, and the kid never shot a pistol before entering
the marines a couple of months ago, says his father 
in this city.
Young Tarzi has sent home his decoration for marksmanship,
and also a sample of the bulls-eye he shot so
full of holes it looks like confetti.
And, there are other local 
gridders who are doing real well
with the armed forces.
For instance, Henry Furr,
speedy backfield ace, has recently
won highest honors as a 
top marine in San Diego and
was cited by his commanding
officer.
Charlie Skeahan, former all-
delta player, was some several
months ago cited as one of the
ten outstanding soldiers in the 
Southeast coast maneuvers, and
is now at Officer Training
School, Fort Benning, Ga.
Walter Simmons, former all-
state center for Clarksdale, is 
now on one of Uncle Sam's largest
battleships and has received
several promotions since entering
the service.
Richard Webster is a sergeant
with the armored forces at
Camp Knowx, and little Bruce
Webster, an All-Big Eight guard,
is with the U. S. Navy at Pensacola
and doing well.
Louis Compassi is showing up
well at LeMoore, Calif., as a 
member of the air corps.
Watt Simmons is at Camp 
Robinson, Ark., with the army 
medical corps, after volunteering
several months ago.
Many other former gridders
from Clarksdale are now in the 
armed services and probably will
show marks of distinction before
this war has gone it's way.

Macon Series Is
Now Completed
(By United Press)
The Columbus Red Bird
probably are glad today that
their series with Macon is over.
The Red Birds dropped four in
 a row to the Peaches to drop
deep into the Sally League cellar.
Macon's four victories, on
the other hand, has enabled 
them to go four full games
ahead of the second place Jacksonville 
Tars.

Machtoiff hurled the latest
Macon victory, holding Columbus
to five hits.
The Charleston Rebels trounced
Augusta twice, 5 to 1 and 3 
to 0, with Stein and Van Slat
turning in well-pitched games.
Hamrick hit a home run for
Charleston with two men on
base in the first game.
Greenville walloped Savannah
9 to 5. Jacksonville's scheduled
doubleheader at Columbia
was postponed.
