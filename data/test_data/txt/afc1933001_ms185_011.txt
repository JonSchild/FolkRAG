Dear Mr. Goodchild:

I am forwarding to you a proposal of a Czech
folk lorist, Svatava Jakobson, 230 Franklin Ave.,
Grantwood, N.Y., which has been referred to me
by Alan Lomax. I met Miss Jakobson and found
her a very intelligent young woman. Her rather
extensive background and her apparently excellent
training would seem to be just what we need in
this sort of study in the United States. I
wonder if you would be so kind as to tell me
whether you think the other members of the
committee would be interested in looking over the
proposal.

Sincerely yours,

Charles Seeger
Chief
