Richmond, Va., Sunday, August 2, 1942
            I overheard  on the train going down to Richmond that the person
who was talking had on the highest authority he fact that colored
soldiers were exceedingly poor troop material and that in the last  World
War many colored troops had actually refused to fight. [*71*]
