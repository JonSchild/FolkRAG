Haddon Heights, N.J.

 ---From a religious seminary student: "I had a 
telephone call from my father, explaining that 
he couldn't meet me. He had to go to Williamsport 
(Pa.) to help move some troop trains. I 
think they're shooting a lot of the boys across 
right away. Out on Staten Island, where the seminary 
is, we can see them getting an awfully big convoy 
ready. There are 10 or 12 great big luxury liners 
there, painted gray. There are a few warships -- 
one great big one, a battleship or heavy cruiser. 
And there are a lot of freighters being assembled. 
They've been there some time and we thought they'd 
move out in a day or two, but the convoy has been 
getting bigger for the past 10 days.  [*70*]
