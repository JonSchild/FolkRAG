F.sk, 6.  p. 1. CHAS. HAFFER, SR. [*A remarkable prayer take nas the Baptist Convention preceeds this.*]
[*Calm- judicious voice*] Well I began working in 19 and 9.
A: What do you mean by working?
H; I began writing poetry, [ballads and stuff -- still copy different in the way of songs, ballads and things] different compositions in the way of song ballads & so forth
A: How do you mean?
H: I did the dictating; someone [else] done the writing.
A: How did these songs come to you? Tell me about the first song that
you made up and how that happened.
H: Well, the first song that I ever wrote was a song they called
"Stand By Me When I'm Crossing Jordan River", and I wrote that, well
I heard a man singing that song at a convention, a 'sociation, but, when
I went home I wrote it entirely different. It just come to me through
the Spirit.  You see, I been converted for a good long time and it
just come to me through the Spirit and I wrote it and talked with some
people and they advised me to print it. And I printed that and it
made such a big song hit that I just began from that writing different compositions.
A: Do you remember how that first tune went?
H: It went something like this:
When I'm crossing Jordan River, 
Stand by me, Jesus. 
[He thought broke my chillin] ------?-------
Stand by me, Stand by me.
Now [you] the waters are chill[in] cold
Now Jesus in my soul. 
Lightnin flash, Thunder roll, 
Stand by me[, Jesus.]

A: And it had a number of different verses?
H: Yes, that's the first one. The second verse was:
[True hearts] Through hard [troubled] trials, tribulations, 
Where you tribulation?
Stand by me, [Jesus].
Amid the false assucation,
Stand by me, Jesus. 
Trouble [rank, move in sorrow] [?] in gloom aloud
[Lightnin tickin, thunder rolled] [?] [?] + thunders loud
[I'm on my way] And [?] [?] seems so hard
[It's so hard]
