TRAVELIN' SHOES
This is a shout that I learned from my people in churches back in
Fitzgerald when I was a little girl.  It means that, when you have
on your traveling shoes, you're ready to travel on with the Lord,
you're ready to ravel on in a religious world.
REFRAIN:
Travelin' shoes, Lawd,  (2)
Got on my travelin' shoes,   (2)
I can travel now, (REFRAIN)
Don't you see that liar
Sittin' over there,
When ol' death come [a]ridin' by
He'll say, "Go away, death,
"I'm not ready to go,
" 'Cause I ain't got on my travelin' shoes.
Travelin' shoes, Lawd,
Got on my travelin' shoes,
Can't you travel now, (REFRAIN)  (2)
In the word of God, (REFRAIN) (20
Don't you see that drunkard
Sittin' over there,
When ol' death come a-ridin' by 
He'll say, "Gow away, death,
"I'm not ready to go,
" 'Cause i ain't got on my travelin's shoes.
Travelin' shoes, Lawd (REFRAIN) (3)
I'm gonna travel on, (REFRAIN)  (2)
On my way to God, (REFRAIN)  (2)
Travelin' shoes, Lawd (REFRAIN)  (4)
