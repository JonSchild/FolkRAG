Dear Dr. Lomax:

I was glad to get your letter. I hope your son, Alan, writes me; I should
like to know more about where he got the "Ah! lovely appearance of death."

In this mail I am sending a letter asking that you be sent a copy of The
Christian Advocate in which my review of your book appears.

I am so sorry that I did not know you were now living in Dallas. I was
there about three weeks ago for two or three days and would have enjoyed
calling on you and talking with you. "Who's Who" gave your address as
University Station, Austin.

Trusting all is well with you, I am,

Sincerely,
Robert G. McCutchen

See long letter I gave you. I hope
you will reply. I haven't got his
review yet
