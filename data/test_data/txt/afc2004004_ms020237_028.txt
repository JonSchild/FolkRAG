sure die, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. It jus' can't stand it. That's right.
    Let's see, I thought I had one in my mind jus' then, but I can't think 
of a thing now. 
     What is this here: "It go an' it go an' go. An' it's very 
swift in going. But anyitme it git to a roa,d it won't cross." 
...Jus' go an' go an' go. Go anywhere until it git to a road...
It won't cross a road. 
TL: A fence. 
BJ: What?
TL: A fence.
BJ: A fence? you can put a fence across the road.
TL: Who ever heard of puttin' a fence across...?
BJ: Well, ah, ah, ah, you can put a fence across there if you
want to, though, 'cordin' to the road, you know? I see a-
many roads stopped with a fence. Hu, hu! See,
hyere goes itself, now. Nobody don't have to carry it. Nodbody
ain't gonna carry it. It goes an' goes, but it won't cross the
road...It's fire, again. 
TL: Fire again?
BJ: Um hum. 
TL: Oh sure, that'll cross a road! 
BJ: No, it won't either. Hit, hit won't cross there. If ya git
 to the end of the road an' have butt in that traffic an' git in 
that road (?), it's gonna stop. Now it may be flame an' fly over 
there, you know, up in the air, but hit ain't gonna cross down here.
TL: On the road.
BJ: Tha's right. Ain' gonna cross on the road, um-um. Sure
won't do it. Jus' go an'go an'go. But it won't cross the
road.
