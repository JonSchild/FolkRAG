SINGING GAMES

Blue Bird

I. Bluebird, Bluebird
In and out my windows
Bluebird, Bluebird
In and out my windows
Oh! Johnny, I am tired.
Oh! Johnny, I am tired.

II. Take a little partner
And tap him on the shoulder
Take a little partner
And tap him on the shoulder
Oh! Johnny, I am tired.
Oh! Johnny, I am tired.

Directions. The group stands in a single circle, clasping hands to make
windows or arches. There may be two or more leaders or Blue Birds. On verse I,
leaders skip or run in and out the windows. On "Oh! Johnny, I am tired" all players
stop and stretch arms. Leaders then stand behind a partner, tapping shoulders
while singing Verse II. As the song is sung again, the leaders and the ones they
tapped are Blue Birds. Continue until all or nearly all are Blue Birds.

Note: This game is taken from "Suggestions for Singing Games," a Bulletin of the
Cleveland Department of Parks and Public Property, Division of Recreation.
