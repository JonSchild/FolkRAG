In German occupied Norway, a
farmer received a notice from the local
rationing board that he was not filling
his quota of eggs.  Shortly after, he
replied with this note:  "I tacked up your
letter in the chicken house, but as the hens 
did not pay any attention to it, I shot
them all for sabotage."
