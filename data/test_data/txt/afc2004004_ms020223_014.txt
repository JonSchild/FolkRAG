BJ TAPE 7D, p. 12

BJ: The gitar be pickin' it, too, ya know, if they have a...A big
ah time with that. That "Shooley," that "Shool-along," you know
when they mostly said "Shool-Along" is when they be playin' these
sets an' when it [be] time for the woman to dance right, or the man
to dance right. Ya see?
[*SQUARE DANCING*]
AL: What do you mean, "dance right"?
BJ: You know, you know when ya dance to ya right an' go around an' shool-
along, you...what, what, what ya call shoo-fly. Ye-ya know, when
they be dancin' [at] in a set. (THIS IS SQUARE DANCING REFERRED TO)
AL: You mean when the individuals come out and dance?
BJ: That's right. When they, you know, you know, say ah, they
has a, a dance to the right, ya know. An' then they have a, a
flyin', they call it. You know, jus' a-goin'. You, you don't take
time to stand wit' that partner an' dance; ya jus' swing, ya see?
You shool-along, just keep on goin'. Swing that'n then swing
another then swing an' quit when ya come to ya partner, ya see?
That jus' shool-along. You ain' got -- Jus' go around to all of
'em. Especially when they have 16 centers, ya know. An', an'
they mos'ly have 8 cen'ers, but when they have 16 cen'ers, it's
a big one ['n], 's a double set, you know, at one time, see?
     An' man, they...They say, "First ol' lady fly, fly to the
right," see? She jus' go an' git that partner. She git, she git
that man...ev-every'n a diffrunt man. An' -- you know -- an' then
back to 'er own. An' "second do the same...third do the same,"
so on, ya see?
     But now, that's not dancin' to the right. That's just, that's
just fly to the right. An' then they go to, "Shool-along, gal,
shool-along. Shool-along," see?
AL: What does "shool-along" mean?
