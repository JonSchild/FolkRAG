CO-OPERATION
Tune--Tipperary, By Jimmy O-Shea.
We're the Farmer's of Montana,
And we heard the call on day,
Banding us together in the
F--E--C--U way.
Whispering words of comfort,
While we listen to them say,
Farmers never stick together,
Flourish as they may.

Chorus--
It's a grand word co-operation,
It's a lode-star for us all,
When we're weakened and disheartened,
And the ranks around us fall.
Good-bye to selfish interest,
Farewell strife to you,
For the Union is bound to triumph,
If we all stay true.

Each interest has its Union,
But their faces all grow long,
When they hear the echoes
Of the Farmer's Union song.
So let us stick together,
And unite in one strong band,
Co-operate and play the game
That waits on every hand.
Chorus--

SELL! SELL! SELL!
Tune--We Won't Be Home Until Morning.
We'll all sell to the Union,
We'll all sell to the Union,
We'll all sell to the Union,
For 'tis the better way,
For 'tis the better way,
For 'tis the better way,
We'll all sell to the Union,
We'll all sell to the Union,
For 'tis the better way.
