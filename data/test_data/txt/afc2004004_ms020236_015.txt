TL:         Your mother's what?
BJ:         My mother's brother.  Tha's the baby brother.   Anyhow,
he had went down to Dawson, Georgia.   We was speakin' about him
bein' kilt.   Went down to Dawson, with my uncle, the same time, y'know, when
Mama went down.   Not the same time, but the same place.  Then
Uncle [got] moved, after Mama got, you know, where her and Papa was
married, they was gettin' along alreigh; he [was a c ]
[An' I tell you he was a] moved to Cuspa (?), an' I tell you
he [had a big place] was a big [one around there] renter. He rents. An' so [I was] he
[tellin' you we] went down to [Cuspid (?)] (Cuspeth?). . .My uncle, 
Eugene -- tha's the older uncle, tha's Mama's uncle.   An' tha's (the one)
(why) I tell ya' he was surprise', you'know married (Maryland? all the) time.
He had [a] Son* with him.   Son was his[-- you know --] his mother's --
was his -- you know.   So he was the Son's uncle, too, an' Mama's
uncle.   All right.                    But Mama's brother.   An' so
Mama -- we went down there workin' with him.  An' so there was, ah,
they all was havin', you know, around that country, rapes an'
one thing an' another, an' all kind of mess.   An' so, anyhow,
he was workin' near this -- these peoples -- this family of
peoples, an' ah, near where his farm was.   You know, a little
farm up to the hill?   An' he was workin' to the farm an' so on.
An' Uncle was [workin'] kinda up there; they didn' like Uncle so [hard] hot
nohow, y'know, up in that country there, livin' like he was.   An' didn'
like Son so hot, either, 'cause Son would work with him an'
Uncle didn' have to hire much done 'cause Son work with him.

TL:         Well, how were they living? If they wouldn't work?
BJ:         Well, 'cause they just rent, ya know. An' they lived by
themselves, workin' by the day.   See, he had his own, you know what
I'm talkin' about. . .see, this way, when you rent the place, what
you make is yours.   Because you just pay the rent by the place, you see?
