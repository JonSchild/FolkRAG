installment on the xxx mardi gras costumes and buy food and drink for
the members of his band during the season of practice and mardi gras
proper.  For these bands practice, beginning Saturday the sixteenth ,
drum, dance and sing all night until eight Sunday and practice until twelve
or one or perhaps, if it is the week before the seventh of February, all
night again Sunday.  They wander about the country-side and collect enough
money to pay for their candles and the oil for their lamps and xxxxx 
oil for their voices and souls in the form of clarin. during the 7,8,9 ,
they dance steadily for three days and nights and cover forty or fifty
miles and collect, if they are good perhaps a hundred dollars. The money
pays for the elaborate costumes of the two principle dancers(which may
cost, depending on the expectations of the band and the credit of its
manager, between $15 or $100 dollars apiece), food and drink for the
three days and nights, salaries forthe drummers and dancers, and what is
left goes in the pocket of the director.  After mardi gras is over practice
for rara season begins at once and goes on until holy week  when the
dancing begins twelve o'clock Thursday and lasts through Monday. At this
time the band may pick up two or three hundred dollars.  But more of all this
when I see more of it during the next month.   I am positive of this much,
however, that the rara and mardi gras bands themselves do not do all this
simply and solely for pleasure and prestige, because in a little xxxx xxx 
poverty striken town where I spent the night some time ago, there was no
rara at all. The country people, slightly better off, did have mardi gras
bands but the costumes were entirely of home manufacture. Of course, in
Port au Prince where the money of Haiti is largely concentrated, the mardi
gras season is at its best and some of the bands not a mint of xxxxmoney,
just how much I shall discover next week. 
Just after twelve the drums led me through the dark to Vielle Pont.  I had
never been there before and didn't know the dark, muddy and treacherous
path, but the drums seemed to put wings on my heels and I wlked straight to 
them across two miles of black countryside.  And wht a howling raring confusion
of communal rejoicing I found there!  There were two mardi gras bands
the one x from Leroux I have described, another from Cocoyea, and a chaille
o pieds band from Dessus.  They had all come to Vielle Pont to practice
because there was a big open court in the center of the habitation and all
were roaring and drumming and dancing away, dancing toward each other in
simulated attack, each band trying to marshal behind itself the majority of
the spectator-participants, each band with its loyal adherents and its
fickle stragglers. Each of the groups xxxxx was xxxxx singing
a different song and dancing to a different rhythm and when, occasionally
two groups would defile through each other in an attempt to xxxxx
xxxx attract away adherents of the other party, the conflict in the 
two powerful rhyths made one's soul crack.  So long as I watched  , how,
ever  ,  no group of drummers lost xxxxx their beat, even when
it had practically defeated in one of these mock encounters.  Trailing
behind each band was a little island of light and warmth and clarin 
and cakes floating through the air on the precise head of a woman [*vender*]. When 
business was dull, she danced along behind xxx the band from her community
and consoled herself for the dullness of trade by wiggling from 
the navel down.  Of course all this time she paid not the slightest heed
to the wooden tray with bottles,glasses, candy , etc., which slid along
xxxxx through the air [with never a tremor] balanced
on her head.
