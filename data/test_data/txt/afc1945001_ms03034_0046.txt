To:             R. Keith Kane                                                     Date: July 31, 1942

From:        Eugene Katz, Special Services Division

Subject:    FBMS reports

                        When Knapp, of the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety,
            was here he requested copies of the FBMS reports. I said he would have
            to consult you about them. In case he didn't, I am reminding you of
            his request and if you approve will prepare a letter to the FBMS
            suggesting that a copy be sent him.
