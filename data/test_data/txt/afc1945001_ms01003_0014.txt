Rumors

Can we have a pow-wow about rumors Saturday morning immediately following the staff meeting? Those included besides yourself would be Drs. Fransen, Stanton and Cottrell, Neil Du Bois and myself.

If the meeting lasts too long to get this in before luncheon can we make it after luncheon, in Neil's office?

Same memo sent to:
C. Du Bois
Dr. Cottrell
Dr. Stanton
Dr. Franzen
