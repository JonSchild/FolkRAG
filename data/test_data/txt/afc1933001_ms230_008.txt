[you] reacted as I would have
you react. In these regards
I [foun] find no fault
with you.

There is no reason
under heaven why I should
write to you save and
except, Alan Lomax, that 
years and years ago, even
before anyone had seen you,
the care and center of my
being was set in time to a
conglomerate known as You.
So long as I live I will
follow you with grand
concern. Afterwards I don't
know . Affectionately,

Father
