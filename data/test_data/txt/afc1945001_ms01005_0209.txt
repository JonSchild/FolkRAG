                            Division Chiefs
                            Miss Shannon [*(Signed) R. Keith Kane*]

FROM:                 R. Keith Kane
                             Chief, Bureau of Intelligence

RE :                       Newspaper correspondent's inquiries

                              Please find out if anyone in your Bureau had a 
conference with Frank I. Weller, World Wide, regarding
rumors.  If so, let me have the name of the individual
so that I may have a talk with him, or her, regarding
a recent story in the newspapers.

                              Please instruct your personnel to refer calls
and visits from newspaper people to the News Bureau.
If this does not meet the situation, reference should be
made to me.
