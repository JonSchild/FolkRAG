From Margery C. Quiqley, Montclair NJ
Heard in Springfield Mass Aug 14 1942
Subject:  Defense Workers' Morale

"Margaret is thinking seriously of moving
away from Ypsilanti. It used to be such a
nice little town but she says it is just horrid
now. They've brought up a lot of poor whites from
the South to work in the defense plans and
these men go riding around town offering even
nice refined middle aged women five dollars and
then raising the ante to ten dollars. She's afraid
to go to the corner drugstore at night.
"They can't get enough police to patrol
the town properly so the police have been
instructed to shoot at sight"
