23rd & 24th

Spent night in Macroom - 
a garage in a turreted castle -
an island of houses in mysterious
moonlit square - children's 
shouts until 11 along dark
streets - Ireland is a nocturnal
country even in the rurals - 
people sleep til 10 & 11 even
on the farm & indeed there is
little enough to do here - land so
poor & so crowded.  Out west of
Macroom toward Ballingerry
the rocks stick up in fazed ridges
in a way that would make a
[denot?] out of any land but not
Ireland & really you think
you can see faces anywhere
but here we meet the bony
horse nosed doctor with his
boiled English face & nose
as long as my hand.  He
