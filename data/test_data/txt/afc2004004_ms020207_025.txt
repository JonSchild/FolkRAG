Reverend Roe.  Reel 8.  P. 6
When you get without a preacher, the next thing is you must get a
preacher.  [Maybe you know] You may be able to have ministers come in and do the
[*Preacher must rule the church*]
preaching and get along for a while, but not long.  You've got to 
have a preacher. The Lord so fixed it.  He put the preacher here
before the church was fully organized.  He prepared the preacher, and then
He turned the church over into the hands of the minister.  [That He did] When he left
for us to carry on.  And that's God's plan, and no other plan will ever
work well in God's [choice] church saving his['s].  Therefore, no man will ever
be able to lead the Church of God but a God-called minister.  They
might know along for a while, and get preachers come [now] in and out and
preach, and in a way, he is kinda leading [them] it then because without a
preacher you [wouldn't] wont have any congregation.  It takes a minister,
matter not whether he can preach well or not.  They just can't do without
one.
