3) Me and my marrow and our laddies
Come straight up frae Aberdeen to Dundee,
But we couldna get a
We had to pick the berry.
4) O to pick the berry in the winter-time,
Cold weather ye ken the noo,
And we took a wee bit camping,
Up in Blairgowrie, too.
5) O next morning it was snowing,
I didna ken what to do.
I lifted my pipes into my hand
And started forth to play.
6) The hornies come, the dirty,
To lift                           free,
I got sixty days and three.
7) Verse one again.
8) Verse two again.
9) Noo I'm singing the song from London Town,
It' great to hezr my voice.
And people back in bonny Dundee,
Shall always now rejoice.
10) They all think of Davy the singer,
Wherever he may be,
But he canna get a berry.
Lomax: That's a real tinker's song, that.
Davey: The man, he had a wife and three kiddies and a set of 
piprs. Now it being cold winter-time, and he goes to Aberdeen -
no buses at thatntime. He walked. There was a train, but he
hadna the price of the train. With him were wee bairniew in an
old pram. . . . . . .they stayed in the barns. And he came to
Perthshire, and of course, he come to Blairgowrie in the wintertime
with snow on the gruind. It's very cold up there, and his
wife. One morning he started to play the pipes in the town, and
the hornies, - that's the police - came with the cart and took
him away. Took the bairns and put them in a home, and put the
woman in jail, too.
