Subject: Rumors

Reporting on your memorandum of July 30, on rumors heard up to and during this day, I regret to say that I have heard no rumors and this in spite of the fact that my work requires that I travel in the three States of our region, both in cities that are overcrowded with defense industry and in the communities adjacent to military establishments. 
I feel somewhat remiss but those are the facts.
