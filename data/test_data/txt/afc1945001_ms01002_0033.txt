tendency to save one's self time and to skip the reading of the counter-
action.  Since most reading is of spotty sort, quick, casual review of 
material, rather than a careful analysis of the precise implications of 
the content, the reader who recognizes a "this is not so" counteraction, 
would be inclined to skip the full statement and go on to the next juicy 
tidbit.

Items that are parti[c]ally true are difficult to counteract since 
it is always necessary, if one chooses to be honest, to acknowledge the 
truthful part. While the occasional inclusion of this sort of item lends variety 
and greater acceptance of the column as a whole, care is needed. Any state-
ment that presents a rumor first and then a counteraction where one says, 
"it is true--but," los[s]es the effectiveness needed for the elimination of 
the rumor. Most rumors do have some [kind] kernel of truth but if this becomes 
emphasized, readers will end up with greater confidence in rumors than 
before. The rumor must be described as false [play], tremendous exaggeration, a 
distorted picture--emphasis on the errors, with a minor passing gesture 
toward the true parts.

A rumor that has two parts, or is relatively lengthy, should not 
be included in direct counteraction program. If the rumor is complex in 
form, then the response to it will have to be relatively complex and it 
becomes difficult for the untrained reader to keep the various parts separate. 
He loses the nub of what is [its] being denied. The whole sequence becomes a reading 
exercise without the sharp lining up of "False" and "True" which is implied 
in the sort of program designed.
