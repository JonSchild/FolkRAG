6. The problem of publishing locally each Clinic will be left to the head of the Clinic. However, no action whatever should be taken along this line until the Rumor Clinic machinery has been set up and perfected. Since it is quite probable that foreign agents will attempt to sabotage this organization, these precautions are understandably necessary. Materials and suggestions on methods of self-publicization will be forwarded at the proper time.

7. The greater part of the labors of each Clinic will be devoted to a comprehensive and accurate gathering of all local rumors. During the weekly meeting these rumors will be discussed and written up in detailed form with their variations to be sent to the Office of Education where they will analyzed. Material thus acquired will be of great value to many governmental agencies.

8. At a later date the Office of Education will return to the Clinics complete and nation-wide reports on the most important rumors. These reports will be publicized by each Clinic in a manner to be worked out later by each Clinic in cooperation with this Office.

9. This prospectus is by its nature cursory and will be followed by more precise information at a later date.
