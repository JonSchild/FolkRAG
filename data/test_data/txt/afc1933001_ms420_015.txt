THEY'RE TALKING WAR

Words and Music
Jessie Lloyd


They're talking war - who's talking war
The yellow press - we know what for
They sent us to wallow in gas and mud
While the profiteers made their cash from blood

Try it again - try it again
And we'll turn the tables then


They said to fight - boy, how they lied
To save our homes, country and pride
Well, we fought and we won as they said to do
But the banks got our homes and our country too

Told us to give - give till it hurts
While they grabbed our very shirts


They say its fine - who says its fine?
War brings a boom - we know the kind
All the prices hit the roof and the wages lag
While the poor working goof stands and holds the bag

Take it away - take it away
'Cause you can't fool us today


Tehy're talking war - they say prepare
All right, we will, yes, and with care
Let each worker and farmer the whole world 'round
Join and work till exploiters of war are down

Rulers beware we're telling you
If you start one more - you're thru!
