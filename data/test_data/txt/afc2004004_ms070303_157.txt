30/6 - Above song by a shepherd - 

Colum John
Tradition was that way ,

Altho you might get a little
inflection in the music you
very seldom got any change
in the words

Pipe Maj Ross. I get the distinct
impression that he's nervous about
playing pibroch. He the redoubtable
of all the pipers. [sic] He put the pibroch
off as long as he could. He changed 
his mind about which one. He
made a mistake in two bars & insisted
on going back. He showed
no pleasure in playing or listening
& spoke of the long one's as boring
