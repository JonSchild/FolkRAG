the road and the four gros negres
 rode up and down between the two
 cheering [?] _

Crowds of people have already come into town
from PaP, Jacmel, etc.. The little cafes
are full and the streets are thronged with
strangers.
 
By five or six o'clock 12 or 14 bands have
passed back & forth through the [city] villiage.
One or two have been very poor - that is,
undecorated affairs - the poorest had
only one flag [tied] a lavender mouchoir
tied on a switch, [and] several people
carried bunches of greenery - there was
[only] one major's [and his] costume consisted
of a red [?] - the other major had
no costume at all - neither one could
jouer [?] very well - this was [the] La
Fleur d'Or -

Another band had only four flags and
two majors with few payettes on their costume.
It seems to be the custom [to] for everyone in the band toucher the
best prospects - the majors, the chef, the major, the sans bas
- the sans bas passes behind the neck of the prospect -
