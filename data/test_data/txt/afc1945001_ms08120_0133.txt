One War at a Time
At a certain U.S. military camp the
officers who examine candidates for
officer's training hit upon a wonderful
question for testing the poise and mental
equilibrium of Southerners who appear
before them. Each candidate is asked
what he would do if his state seceded
from the Union.
When they sprang it on a Georgia
man, his eyes lit with a holy fire, but
he quickly got himself in hand. "We got
to finish this war first, suh" he
said.
