TL:  Well livers?
BJ:  Um-hum.  Yeah.
TL:  Where did they live, in Dawson?
BJ:  Well, no, no.  They has, they have lived there.  An' that's
where -- I lived with them there. But they came from around
Buenavists and Smithville up in there, see?  Up in there. And
Ellaville.
TL:  And why were they well livers?
BJ:  [Well] Oh, just cause they liked to do well.  An' liked, like
myself.  You know what I mean by "well livers?"  They just look
out for theyselves.  Ya see, that's what I mean.  An' they were
saved from year to year an' they would work, ah, work with good
peoples an' they would treat people good an' they was treated
good.  You see?  An' then they had -- Then they tuk care a what they had.
An' dey had something.
TL:  Were they well livers among the whites, or. . .?
BJ:  Among the white and the colored.  That's right, just well
livers.  That's all.  Just well livers                                        (?)
What I mean by that, they didn't, ah, throw away, jest, oh, they
ah, earnin', an' den dey always tried to keep something like, you
know, that they could help somebody with.  Just like Mama an' them
always did, see?  Tried to raise [somethin'] stuff an' put up somethin'
an' keep somethin' goin'.  Well, a lot of folks just don't do it.
That the causin' not to be doin' so well.  It's just like the
ants.  You look out for, you know, for the cold in the time of the [,you know,] in the
time of the summer, the spring.  So that's what they do.  They always
doin' sumpin' to help themselves, an' [then they] to help others.
