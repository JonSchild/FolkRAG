Old Humprey Marshall

Old Humphrey marched us day and night
Without a bite to eat
Because he was afraid to fight
He ordered our retreat
Tired and hungry oft set down
We could not get a meal
How often did we have to starve
How ofen did we steal

Sometimes they marched us round the ring
Some called it thrashin' wheat
Sometimes we didn't have no bread
And sometimes had no meat
Tied up it's oh tied up
I never shall forget
In the days when we're tied up
Along the Lynchburg raid.

Sometimes they put us under guard
The guard stood at the door
I see the bugs upon the rugs
And crawlin' on the floor
I do not crack them with my thumb 
Or mash them on the wall
This world is wide
Theys room beside
They's room enough for all.

And when we get from under guard
And away from these nasty bugs
Some will go to playin' cards 
Some for the whiskey jug 
Before the setting of the sun
They'll have us tied to trees
I love those independent men
who does just as they please

When they gagged us in the mouth
We had not a word to say
We's like the dumb beast of the earth
We's bound and must obey
Tied up it's o tied up
I never shall forget
In the days when we're tied up
It may be all right yet.

Now boys iT8s ricollect the gag
The guardhouse and the bugs
The ball and chain
The apple tree
The card, the whiskey jug
I love the jug the best of all
It keeps me in good heart
O jug, o jug, you whiskey jug 
I hope we'll never part.
