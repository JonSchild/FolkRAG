                           INSTRUCTIONS TO INTERVIEWERS

            It is very necessary for the Office of Price Administration to know 
how the public is receiving the restrictions which the war effort imposes upon 
them. ln his testimony before the House Committee, the administrator repeatedly 
emphasized that the success or failure of price control would depend largely 
upon the attitude of business and the general public.

for each person whose comments are recorded. On the form is a place to indicate 
whether the interviewee was aware of the interviewer's identity. 
            There is no set procedure that see be used in approaching the 
casual subjects since it should be done informally. The interviewer should not 
approach the subject as a representative of the Office of Price Administration. 
In other words, the interviewer must be anonymous, and his subjects must be 
such people as he meets in the course of his day's work, at outside of his work, 
casual acquaintances met on a train or a street car, or in the local food or drug 
store, an elevator operator, a policeman, a gas station attendant, the
