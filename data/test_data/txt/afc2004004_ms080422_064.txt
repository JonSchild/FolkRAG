Tape: #893 Cont. Nimrod Workman
They fired them with coal and with wood, and they had these
old power houses. They'd make their own juice, you know, they'd
make juice and they'd get the hot water from this power house.
So I heared then whistles blowing and train bells ringing,
whistles of them old freight train a blowing whoo, whooooo.
And I turned them oxens out, and my mother got out there beating
down plow(?), we lived in the country, Morton Cty, KY. I run
out to see what was going on, and I said, what's going on,
Mother? She said they drove King kaiser into the... they
stacked arms. You won't have to go. I said, Thank the 
lord for that, I won't have to go. And my buddy, they drafted
him in. He and me used to make moonshine liquor together a
lot, you know, when times was slow. We made moonshine whiskey
and sold it for $5 a gallon, from 2 1/2 to $5 a gallon. You
could get 100 lbs of sugar for $2 back than. He went and
fought all the way through the war, never got a scratch. Come
back with his uniform on, and I got out loafing around with him
and he got drunk on moonshine, and went up to a log house, two
story house, bout two weeks after he come out of the army, and
his brother and his wife went off and burned himself up in that
house. Went all through the war, and never got a scratch, and
burned hisself up in that house. That made me think that a
man just had a certain time to go, or an appointed time... all
around bullets when the war was going on, hear that old...
coming, (he growls) that's the way they go, growling, you can
hear them for miles. And they didn't fly fast, you know...
