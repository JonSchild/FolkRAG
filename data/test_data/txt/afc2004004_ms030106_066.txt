69 have no shoes on and was doing a kind of dance and mumbling.
There would be a dance on a blanket and a feast.  They would
have jumbalaye rice with some kind of peculiar odor to it.  The
odor had a kind of drug-storish scent.  They gave us kids poppy
seed to put in our mouth.  Don't remember what it was for.  The 
seed was supposed to make you highly successful. You could swing
people your way.

There was some kind of workmanship you did to make somebody
fall in love with you--take frog legs and grind them, also boa
constrictor tongues.  Give them the names of who you want to
fall in love with you and this thing is arranged, but you don't
know how it is done.  These operators were all over the country.

At the age of 17, [went around to gambling houses.] I was sick and couldn't get a job. Somethin was wrong with my hands.  At "Twenty-five's
Sano came in.  Said, "Son, you sick."  I said, "Someone did something
to me--a woman."  He said, "you don't have to tell me, I
know you have no money.  I'm going to give you three baths and
you will be well by the last bath." It was winter--went to his
house.  He stripped me, put me n a tin tub with some kind of
grass.  He would shake all over and rub me.  Did this three consecutive
Fridays.  He said, "I will get you a job and then you
can pay me."  He said, "When we get to this place, don't open
your mouth, just touch me."  He said, "in three days you will
have this job."  At two o'clock on the third day, the maid
walked in and said she was looking for a piano player.  Asked
how I was feeling.  Said regular piano player was sick--would
I like to make a few dollars.  I went there to sing and play.
They had a legitimate white pianist there--nothing hot.  I went
in there and started on the job.  In a week I had plenty money
in my pocket.  Miss Burt asked me if I wanted to work steady.
"If you think you can come steady, I will be glad to have you.
Everybody likes your work very much."

Work started at nine o'clock but sometimes I would come early
to get the good meals.  I never paid Sona because I never believed
he did anything. It is one of the most ungrateful things I ever
did in my life.  In spite of him taking me down to that house,
I should have realized there was some powerful ingredient he
used.
