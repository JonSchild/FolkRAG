My dear Mr. Lomax:

I have your note of June 12. I received word from Miss
Daniels in New York, this morning, that Mr. Garwick has just
returned from a two week's trip and has promised to hasten
with all possible speed the completion of the machine. I expect
to receive from him, in a day or two, detailed specifications,
and immediately upon their receipt I shall send him the
formal order. Orally the whole matter was settled over two
weeks ago. I am very sorry about these delays.

Faithfully yours, 

Chief, Division of Music
