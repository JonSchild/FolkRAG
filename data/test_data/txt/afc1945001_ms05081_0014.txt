I read that a merchant ship off New
England was struck by two torpedoes
on opposite sides of the ship[e] within
a few seconds of each other - indicating
that two submarines were teaming together
on the same boat; the boat sank in less t
than a minute; there must be a hell of a
lot of submarines out there.
