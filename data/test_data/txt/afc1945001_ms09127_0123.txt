War is [a] horriable, it takes
your loved one's away from you, many 
of them never to return.
This was is a war that is
being fought on many fronts trying 
to crush the enemies so that peace 
may rule the world forever. 
The Axis is very smart, and
we have to be much smarter if or
when we are to win the war. They, I mean
the Axis treats their war prisoner's 
cruely, they do not feed them much,
and what they do feed them is not
fit to be eaten. 
The Axis does not have
mercy on anyone or anything. They
bomb hosipitels, schools, and Red 
Cross First Aid centers. When the allies
bomb one of these by accident, the
enemies let us know about, saying 
untrue things.
