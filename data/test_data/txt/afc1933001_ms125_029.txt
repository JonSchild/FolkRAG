Port-au-Prince, September 23, 1937

Mr. Alan Lomax,
Division of Music,
Library of Congress,
    Washington D.C., USA.

Dear Mr. Lomax,

    I shall gladly help you in the translation of the Haitian
songs. Even if you were well acquainted with the actual Creole
language their translation would be very difficult from the ordinary 
speech.

    I have not published as yet a glossary of Creole although
I intend to do so in future.

    Do you know if the Library of Congress has purchased my
book "Le Creole Haitien, morphologie et syntaxe" ? If not, I
would appreciate it if you could have them get a copy for their
linguistic division. 

    Sincerely yours,
    S. [?]
