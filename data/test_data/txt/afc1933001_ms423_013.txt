THE FARMER COMES TO TOWN
(In his "American Songbag," Carl Sndburg says that he heard fragments of this
song in Illinois in the early 1890's. W.W.Delaney said, "As near as I can remember,
that song came out in the 1860's, just after the war.")

When the far-mer comes to town, with his wa-on brok-en down, O, the

far-mer is the man who feeds them all. If you'll on-ly look and see, Then I

think you will a-gree That the far-mer is the man who feeds them all. The

far-mer is the man, The mar-mer is the man, Lives on cred-it 'till the

fall; then they take him by the hand and they lead him off the land, And the

mid-dle-man's the man who gets it all!

II.
When the lawyer hangs around, while the butcher cuts a pound,
O, the farmer is the man who feeds them all.
And the preacher and the cook Go a-strolling by the brook,
O, the farmer  is the man who feeds them all.
The farmer is the man, The farmer is the man,
Lives on credit 'til the fall;
With the int'rest rate so high, It's a wonder he dont die,
For the morgage-man's the man who gets it all.
