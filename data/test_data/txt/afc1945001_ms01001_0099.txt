help members of the community to track down factual information.  the rumor
column should be preserved as an instrument of the total educational program.
The use of people sufficiently concerned about special topics to write in
concerning them should be reviewed by the Educational Director.  They may 
prove good discussion group leaders, lecturers, outlets for printed matter, 
etc.  Their reports should be included in the analyses of the Research
Director and in this fashion contribute to the definition of the educational
program.  If their rumors merit attention, they should be dealt with in
accordance with the perspective of the entire program.  If the rumors warrant
direct counteraction, the column will take care of it--if indirect, the
regular programming will serve; and if it is wisest to table the material
for a while, this can best be decided by those responsible for the definition 
of the activity of the project as a whole.

The organizing of counteracting material should be done with great
care, sufficiently long in advance to permit its circulation among the 
experts on the advisory council and other specialists whose cooperation may
be secured.  Counteracting material must be based on authoritative information.
A major function of the direct counteraction program should be the 
helping of people to learn how to select good sources of information.  Care
should be taken to indicate clearly what the authoritative sources are; and 
where feasible, desirable methods of approaching the authoritative sources 
or keeping in touch with official information along the lines involved should 
be presented.  The counteracting statements must be complete, devastating.
A denial that is simply another version of the original should be avoided.
The rumor as an item of social intercourse, should be eliminated.  It should
not simply be corrected.
