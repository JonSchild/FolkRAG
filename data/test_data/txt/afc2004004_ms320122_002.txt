AMERICAN PATCHWORK 1357. 1358
[MUSIC]
MR.FOUGET  If I could sing that, ah ha.
I can't.  It's too high.  But Ann can sing that pretty good.
A.LOMAX  But at the end of the Mardi
Gras everybody was drunk and happy or how would that. . .
MR.FOUGET  Oh, yeah.  Well usually meet
before daylight you see.  So that's what I said.  I was drunk
before daylight.  We'd get drunk.  We'd take off.  Go from 
house to house.   And then about, just before sundown or 
something like that we'd come back and the women cooked the
gumbo, see.  Big pots of gumbo.  I got pots right here.  Big
pots of gumbo.  Would eat gumbo.

And then just before the dance started we'd 
go and we'd change costumes so the people recog. wouldn't
recognize us.  And then they start the dance.  So if the
house was small, so they let a group in.  they dance about 2
or 3 dance and another group would come in.  And then even
the women. they'd dress and then they'd come too.  They'd 
dance a Mardi Gras. 
A.LOMAX  When you changed your
costume. . . 
MR.FOUGET  Yeah.
