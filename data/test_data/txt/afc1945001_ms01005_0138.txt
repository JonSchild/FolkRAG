Mr. Warren E. Walsh
Director
The Syracuse University Rumor Clinic
Syracuse, New York

Dear Mr. Walsh:

Your letters of October 3rd and 4th, addressed to Mr.
Elmer Davis, have been turned over to me for reply, since the
Bureau of Intelligence, of which I am in charge, is responsible
for the analysis of rumors.

The Syracuse University Rumor Clinic, which you describe
in your communications as having been inspired by the AMERICAN
MERCURY article, reproduced in the READERS' DIGEST, is of extreme
interest to us, and we are most anxious to have you and your
associates make good beginning in this very delicate sphere of
activity.

As you of course understand, the rumors themselves which
our clinic encounters are the symptoms, not the cause, of the disease.
War-time rumors are created as the studies of competent authorities
show, by the tensions and anxieties which are inescapable in a war
situation.  The cause of the rumors, thus, is not so much the
enemy as our tenseness and anxiety about the conduct of the war.

Since this is the case, there is good reason to believe
that widely publicized rumor clinics which attempt to refute each
rumor by information intended as an antidote will, when read by
the general public, augment their anxieties and, in turn, produce
more rumors.

For just such groups as your own, we are preparing a
statement on rumors, along with some suggestions about how local
groups can be of help to the Office of War Information in their
collection and analysis of rumors.  You will receive this statement
in a very few days and we trust that you and your associates, along
with the Syracuse POST-STANDARD, from which we have heard under date
of October 5th, will take our suggestions into consideration.

Sincerely yours,

R. Keith Kane
Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
