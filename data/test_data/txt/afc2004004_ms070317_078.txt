I heard it, made my hair 
stand right on end. 

[?] He's got your pardon in my 
hand 

When I'm lonesome, lonesome, 
lord, I'm sho he'll walk 
with me. 

Small payday here, large payday 
in the morning. 
I'm coming quickly and reward 
every man.

John was a [?] witness where Jesus 
[?] unstopped the blind eyes,
and pulled the plug out 
of the deaf ear
#
If Jesus cried with a loud
voice, its allright for me for me 
to cry out in a loud voice--
to roar like a trumpet
