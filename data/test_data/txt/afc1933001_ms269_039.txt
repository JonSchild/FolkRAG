Recommendations for the activity of the Archive of American
Folk Song in the National Defense Program.

1. RESOURCES
a) Twenty thousand songs on record made in the field.
b) Six thousand songs on commercial records.
c) A huge collection of ms. material.
d) The printed sources on American folk lore and music,
constantly used by the Archive and most of them in the
public domain.
e) Contacts all over the United States from whom special
information and a great body of educational material can
be had- i.e. the other collections in Columbus Uni., Uni.
of Va., Texas Folk Lore Society, etc..
f) The production on records from fresh field work, now actively
in progress, and from hundreds of informants, known
and as yet unvisited.

2. THE CHARACTER OF THE MATERIAL
a) Folk lore by its very nature is democratic. Whether communally
composed or merely communally accepted, it has
been through the process of folk legistration, refinement,
change, enlargement, etc. until the lore has been, so to
speak, voted on and has become the lingua franca of a whole
group. This process of development in folk literature has
been going on for ages and American folk lore is merely one
end point of that democratic process.
b) The material is integrative in character for the reason
discussed above. It draws people together and furnishes
them the ideas and the language which they can use for purposes
of communication. It speaks so simply and so sincerely
of things profoundly near to all people of all ages
that it can at once be understood and accepted by all of
them. Even if it appears to indulge in absurdities, these
absurdities are so rooted in the language and psychology of
the people that they are hard to forget; they provide a province
of nonsense through which men can communicate in a
sort of emotional fourth dimension that is rare in all literature
and music.

There are various songs, stories, symbols, heroes and types
of all of these which are acceptable to all Americans
whether sophisticated or unsophisticated. Around a campfire,
in a front parlor, at a country dance, in the slums
