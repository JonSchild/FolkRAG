So I was satisfied with that, then I went to iron.   Tha's why 
she came in there -- an' no -- before she came in there -- 
some of the chilrun had done sumpin' in there an' made a mess.  She 
cuss all the time, y'know, talkin' --some of the chilrun had 
done sumpin' in there had made her angry.   An' so I had heard 
[her] this man's name called 'cause Big Boy had told me his name, 
see?   An' she says to the chile, she says, "You jus' like your 
damned ol' daddy, Ol' Joe Dean."   Whoop!   Somethin' hit me all 
over.  I near 'bout said aloud (?)    Said, This is Joe Dean house!  
Said to myself, I'm gettin' out of here!   Owaugh!  I was scared 
[then, too.] into fits.   Oh, God, I said, I'm gettin' out of here. 
 So I said to myself, I said, I'm gonna ask her could I come back 
tomorrow an' finish the clo's.   It was gettin' over the hill; 
sun's goin' on down.   When she said that, I mean, ow, it look 
like the iron got cold.  Oh Lawd!
           So I went on, an' she came in the room jus' a lil' bit 
after that.   She said "You ironed all them winter clothes?"  
I said, "Um-hum."  She said, "Don' iron all them damn things." you know, cussin'.  She said, 
"Just pack [them] those things an' put 'em up."   Why'n' she say that 
befo'?   'Cause I was down to nothin' but [undercloche} undershirts 
an' drawers an' underclothes for men.   An' boy, I was through (?)
I rolled 'em fas'!   Whooo!   I got 'em rolled up quick as I could.  
An' I put the ironbo'd; I put the irons aside in the fireplace.  
An' I lef' that place, finally.   When I got down to the bridge, 
I [made it] met him.   You know, [I was] how close there.   [I mean] Well, that was too close to me.  
I met him an' another man together.  He looked around with a kinda 
grin on [the] one side.   He said, "You got through?"   I said, "Yeah, 
I'm through."   I kept right on goin'.   He said, "All right."  
He said, "Well, I'll get you your money tomorrow."   But I kep' right 
on goin'; ran [down to] and I didn' look up.    Said, "Whoo!"   But [it] I was 
on the bridge, where I met him at.   Was just between his house 
an' the quarters.   [Way!]  Great goodness amighty.
           I went on over -- there was another man over with 'im.  
So.  Although I didn' get to look at him hardly enough to 
know him good, but I knewed him then, in a way of speakin'.  I wen' on home.  I 
told Miss Alice.   Alice said, "Well, tha's just what the plot 
was for when that boy went an' told you not to hurry the ironin'," 
see.   "An' then he would take you home."  Ooh, boy, I went on home!
