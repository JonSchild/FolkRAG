RUMOR: Washington, D. C.
August 7
This rumor was told to the writer by a lady who had just
come from northern Louisiana.
Negroes are organizing in the South and will attempt to place
themselves on an equal footing with white people. There have been
several race riots already in which considerable bloodshed has occurred
but these have not reach the newspapers. Further race riots
are expected.
