Winston-Salem, North Carolina
August 3, 1942
In talking with a fellow he stated that he had heard that a gasoline distributor
was caught in the swamps of Georgia supplying a submarine with gasoline.  That at
the time the operator was caught he was in the act of pumping gasoline to the
submarine and that the operator of the gasoline supply truck and the submarine
were captured.  This statement was made by a man who travels a great deal and a
person in my opinion who is very intelligent and would do anything he could to
help the war effort.    [*14*]
