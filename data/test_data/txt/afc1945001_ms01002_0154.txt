Washington, D.C.

My dear Mr. Dubois:

At the suggestion of Dr. John M. Potter, I
am sending you herewith letters addressed to Mrs.
Eleanor Roosevelt and to Colonel Donovan, respectively,
by Mr. Gregory V. Drumm.  Since these letters contain
suggestions for the prevention of the spread of rumors,
I think the material will prove of some interest to
the committee with which you are working.
Sincerely yours,
William L. Langer
William L. Langer
Director of Research
