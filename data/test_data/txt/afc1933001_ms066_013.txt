Mr. John A. Lomax, Jan. 7, 1940.

Following this will appear your name and Library of Congress
identification.

If you desire a different title and any additional information
concerning it, to follow it, will you please send me full details?

The reason that I desire these data is that we issue a pre-print
program of the Official NEA program. Under separate cover I am 
sending you a marked copy of our San Francisco program. On page
25 you will find our banquet program for last summer. We also
issue a special program page of our banquet.

Sincerely yours,
[*Clara MacGowan*]
Clara MacGowan,
President
