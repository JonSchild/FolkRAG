Egglestone Poachers.
1.
It comes up ye gallant poacher lads
whoever that you are
Who ramble out on a moonlight night
with yor dog, gun, + snare.
And all you want ye miner lads,
It's you that's got the blame
For the watchers say both night & day
You are killing all the game.

So the keeper he went out one night
As you shall understand.
He thought he saw a poacher lad
with a gun in his hand,
He thought he saw a poacher lad 
skulk in beneath the wall
It was in the squire's high preserve
close down by yonder hall
