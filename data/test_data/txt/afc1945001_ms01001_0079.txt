How can we get relevant information in sufficient quantity to
satisfy people's interests without threatening national security?
How can we prevail against completely unfounded rumors?  Programs must
be worked out thoroughly and carefully based upon fullest understanding
of the problem, for the following is not a unique case:

"Mr. F said that he had met a guy who worked in one of
the largest hospitals in New York and that this guy told
him he just got a call from the hospital that the whole
staff had to leave at once because a terrible disaster
had happened.  Mr. F inquired as to where the disaster
was but the hospital employee said he knew nothing more.
Mr. F. said he became very surprised because he hadn't
heard anything on the radio about this.  He further said
that after he left the guy he turned on the radio but
still didn't hear anything about the disaster.  He said
he was very worried over this because maybe it was so bad
the radio and newspapers couldn't mention it."  (New York,
August 13)
