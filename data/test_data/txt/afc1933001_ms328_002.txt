In the wilds of Utah,

In the wilds of southern Utah, in this wilderness of sand.
   Where the underbrush and sickly sage abound on every hand;
We are camped in dreary exile, doomed to yegtate and rat. 
   The outside world forgetting and by the world forgot;-

It seems an age since I left home to seek this godless Land.
   A thousand miles of cactus and a thousand more of sand,
Each sun baked man and worn out truck the story meekly tells;
   How we've rode these hills and valleys, on the trail that leads to hell:

No charms of nature greet, the eye, no cool and shady dells;
   No little rippling bubbling brooks, or sound of village bells;- 
No charming maidens greet us with a sly enticing wink:-
   Isolation every where and not a drop to drink;-

Utah my Utah where is your Pabst and Schlitz:-
   The sight of your damned sand hills makes me throw a thousand fits;-
God/Should have worked the seventh day, and put things right in here;-
   Or did he leave it in this shape to help the sale of beer.

Around us forest fires rage, our throats are parched and dry;
   And the burning sun shines down on us, from the furnace heated sky;-
Mosquitos, flies and rattlesnakes, help weave a charming spell;-
   Give me a barrel of brimstone, and I'll start a first class hell;-

The flies are armed with cork screws, the mosquitos all wear spurrs.
   The rocks are full of copperheads and the sand is full of burrs;-
The dessert's full of cactus, and the sand is full of fleas.
   And the crabs on boack sixteen add their fragrance to the breeze;-

Oh for the gift of language, to discribe this god damned place;-
   I've cursed it and damned it till I'm purple in the [xxx] face;-
In French, Spanish and Balshivek, and other tongues  unknown;-
   And wish to, god I was back to the place called, home sweet home;

I've scanned the books on poetry to find a fitting name;-
   I've hunted all [zzz] through proverbs, but it seems a losing game;
No adjectives ever written can portray it's thousand ills;-
   It's the tail end of the universe, just held between two hills;-

They talk about the hardships of the Isrealites of old;-
   Tis true they did that penance, when they made that calf of gold;-
But they did stand it forty years in trails and various ways;-
If they'd live in panguitch, they'd have croaked in forty days.

Now that-high-browed freak who went me here,
   May lightning strike him dead.
And may the curse of toa strike on his god damned head,-
   May he be scalped and skined alive and hung upon a rack;-
And may his bowels ne'er move again, until he sends me back;-

What joy what bliss twould be to have him here to tease.
   With a lemon squeezer on his balls so each could take a squeeze.-
The mention of his hated name makes a sober person rave;-
   I'd gladly walk ten thousand miles to piss upon his grave.-

So it's goodbye to old panguitch with it's hot and burning streets.
   Where the blooming heat just sizzles on your tired and acheing feet; 
Farewell to [xxxx] all the bars with their bubbling foaming beer.
   I'm going back to, home sweet home, when I get out of here;-
                Signed
                    Earl E. Campbell
                          Co. 2529,c.c.c.
                              Henrieville,
                                    Utah.
