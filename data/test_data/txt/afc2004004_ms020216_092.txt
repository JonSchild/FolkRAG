done then, ya know, would save 'em.  An' then Jesus, Jesus knowed
that -- But  they yet had faith in God, ya see.  But Jesus knowed
that, an' God knowed it.  That why He, jus' straightin' [it] that out.
Them folks [was] would wash[in'] up a certain day, now, jus' that day, ya
know.   But every day an' all the time wash up me; I'm the Sabbath.
See?  An' that [why] what it [wa'n'] was -- But see, didn't know, ya know.
AL:      [There's] Makes a lot of [sinners] sense. . .
BJ:      Yeah.  [There's sinners] It's sense too, 'cause that day cain't save you.
The day is gonna be destroyed.  Yessuh.   He said, "There's. . ." ah,

one stone shall be lef' upon another'n."

          He said, "Not one stone shall be lef' upon another'n""
See?   All these things mus' come down. Every bit of it's vanity.
See?    Everything.   Nothin' gonna stand but the [worldof] Word of
God, see?  [An'] Tha's [the end] Him.  Tha's Jesus.  See?  An' (He spoke?)
in the spirit.
          An' so tha's the on'y thing gonna stand.  You don't git in

every root an' branch, of sin.   If you believe some of this
stuff, you know some of this sin gonna be in it.  See?  Somebody got
