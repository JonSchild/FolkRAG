BJ TAPE 11, p. 28

So anyway, she's kinda rowdy, an' she didn't like it 'cause so many people, ya know... They, you'd be... We, we got along good.  Everywhere.  I 'vidin' (dividing), givin'; they'd give us an' we could meet at our house.  And we'd have a lots of fun an' we tried to have her in.  But somehow or other, some people just don't like ya, they just don't like ya, that's all.  She just looked like did...

An', cause, I ain't never wondered about no kind a man.  Period.  An' so, she, ah, went to talkin' that day at me as I come in... Ah, sumpin' about some stockin's.  An' I couldn't get the straight about the stockin's.

An' one thing it was, again, I had, used to cook fer two or three boys -- two boys there, from Fitzgerald.  An' they quit her from cookin' for 'em an', an' an' ah, an' I was cookin' fer 'em, see?  'Cause I had cooked fer 'em at first, an' they went on there, then ah, she went to cook fer 'em.  An' she asked me about it.  Well, 't was all right to me 'cause I had enough to cook fer, ya see?  An' then, after a while there, they they -- sumpin' or other -- I don't know why - anyhow, they left.  They must didn' like her cookin', or I don' know what it was; they didn' tell me.  But they come back.  An' all that made 'er mad, again, see?  'Cause she wasn' gittin' that lil' change, you see?  They come back, I tooken 'em back.  But I knew 'em very good, ya know?  They 2 boys from Fitzgerald.  An' so, anyway, I figure all that was in it, ya know.  'Cause one a the boys say she been flirtin' af-after him.  An' that was funny to us, ya know?, 'cause we wasn' studyin' nothin' like that at all.  See?  He was goin' with a fine girl then named Ceely, same boy.  An' I knew it well an' me an' Ceely was great friends.  An' he was teasin' about that an' so on.  So I figure all that was in it, ya know.
