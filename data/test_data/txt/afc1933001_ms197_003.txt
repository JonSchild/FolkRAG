Dear Duncan:

Under separate cover I'm returning the Leadbelly songs, although I'd much rather keep them on permanent loan. As it happened, there was no time to play a record on the program as was scheduled. But the concert was a great success; Town Hall was packed with a wonderfully enthusiastic audience, and an estimated 400 turned away at the door for lack of room.

The meeting in Washington was the most interesting one I have attended; I think you ought to be much pleased with yourself. 

With best wishes,
Alan Lomax

P.S. The attached is obviously for you
