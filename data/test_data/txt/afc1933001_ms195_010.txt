New York, N.Y.

Dear Alan:

Dr. Emrich is planning to include a forthcoming
album "Wearing the ball and chain" and "Train
going up steep grade" sung by Pete Steele and recorded
by you and Elizabeth in 1938.  However, the release
and voucher sent to him have been returned to us
"unclaimed."  It occurred to me that you may know his
present whereabouts.  If so, we certainly would
appreciate hearing from you.

We are all enjoying "Adventures of a Ballad Hunter."
George reviewed it for the Washington Evening Star.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,
