BJ:        I was gettin' 'em from the store. . .Yeah, but I said 
this guy I had, he had a place opened up for me, downtown.  
You see?   At the grocery store and at the dry goods store.   He

TL:        Is that right?
BJ:        Yeah.  So I. . .
TL:        You mean that white man was doin' that?
BJ:        No, no!   This guy I was goin' with.   This night watchman.  
He didn' even live there.   See, he didn' even stay there.   You 
see?   His name was Cecil.   He was a ta-all black man.
TL:        He wasn't married, though.
BJ:        No, he wasn't married.   He had been married an' he had 
three chilrun.   An' he was stayin' with his mother -- ah, with

lookin' guy.   An' he was a night watchman at this place!    You 
see; he didn' even live there.
TL:        How come you didn't marry him?
BJ:        I didn' wanna marry him.  Ha, ha, I wouldn't have to 
marry him. . .An' so, anyway, tha's what I had.   Tha's what they 
didn' know.    See, 'cause they didn' know it wan'n nobody on 
that mill.   Or even on the turpentine still, or at the mill.  
Nowhere, see?   Around there.   [Nowhere.] Didn't know that.  'Cause 
they just search one another an' ask an' talk an' question an' 
everybody they ask they had to tell 'em No.   You see?   They had 
to.   An' that what gave 'em pause.  They didn' know what it was.
