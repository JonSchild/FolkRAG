Spent next day seeing R. Leon, Cremly, Zora
getting the records, & seeing the Sylvain sisters
- mulatoes, intelligent, pretty in a  half-light
They told me about coumbit, walses, romances and
remarked that not all possessions were genuine.
Saw Deux Orphelines, very pop here, super sentimental
in the Dickensian manner. Every eyes was dry when 
the show was over. I went out resolved to shoot all the
rich bastards I saw.

Back in Port Beudet back to work. Odelia, supposed
to be a better ringer than Anita, can't come
because her polygamist husband (4 or 5 wives) [won't]
keeps her locked up like an animal in a cage
and she is afraid [because] that the other
wives would get her in trouble if they saw her 
having a good time. - Andre's wife brought
forth a dead baby this morn. A hard bed, a row
of children looking on  from against the wall,
little Andr√© on the bed crying and comforting 
his wife. She laughed between her moans and
was assured that it was a very common thing
and all for the best because  bon dieu
was responsible and she was comforted-
