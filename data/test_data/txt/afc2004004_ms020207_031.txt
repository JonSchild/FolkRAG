Reverend Roe,  Reel 9.  P. 6 
than two months ago.  And the other day as I was coming down the strret
I seen him, he['d] had come back here.  And I met her this morning,she said
he spoke to her, but they're divorced now.
A: Looks like they re gonna get back together.
R:  No, she says never any more because she tried him and he just won't do right.
You see, when she got in [the] family way, why he just went around with
other women, just stayed away from home . She was down there sick and he wouldn't even get a doc-tor for her, and even didn't stay or pay her bill at all.  And so she
just quit him and got a divorce.
