[*Blind Man Chap 1*]

s orm at Tupelo---2

came in my mind...
It happened Froday at eight o'clock. I was in Marks,
Miss., and I heerd about it. It was broadcasted on the radios
and in the papers. It come right on out. They was dancin at a
big jook, three or four Seabirds in the same jook and it was
a 'struccion time. Only eight got saved in Tupelo. Didn't save
a house. It was a tornado did it. At eight o'clock you
couldn't hear nothin but a lumberin and a roarin. Seem as if it
were a ball of fire turnin over and over sweepin as it go...
See that town over there, they done some mighty mobbin in
it. They hung three or four colored peoples, hung um unmerciful.
And one of those colored men told um that Tupelo---he spoke to
um form up there where they [was g] had him to hang him---
he told um Tupelo would never do no good no more. That mobbin
was just about four or five years before the storm come down
making a Southeast course into town...
