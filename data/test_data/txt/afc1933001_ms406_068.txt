[In] During Cattle Trail days in Texas, [from] 1868-1892, every singing cowboy carried Sam Bass in his repertoire.  The tune is typically of the western ballad breed- drawling, whiney, crispy, saturated with gloom.  Negroes classed it among their lamentations.  My manuscript collection contains nearly twenty versions of the words.  All the tunes were much alike.  
Once while lecturing at Coe College in Iowa I referred to the Sam Bass story.  At the conclusion of [my] the talk a freshman came up and said proudly:  "I thought you might be interested to know that my mother was a sister or Sam Bass!"
