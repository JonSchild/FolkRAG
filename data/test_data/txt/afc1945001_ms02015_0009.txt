Subject: Rumor Report Due October 10

For your third effort on the collection of rumors, we are redefining
the term "rumor." This collection is to be confined to all war-related
rumors. Rumors are war-related if they refer to such things as cost of
living, e.g., rationing, price ceilings, wage stabilization, farm
prices, war bonds; to production, materials, labor, management,
priorities; to transportation, civilian mobilization, salvage campaigns;
to housing conditions, race relations, morale at home, day-care of children
programs; as well as to Selective Service, volunteering, treatment
at camps, troop movement, the Army, Navy, United Nations, the Enemy,
progress of the war.

For our purposes:

Rumor is something told by one person to another

(a) it is stated as a fact (not an opinion)

(b) it comes from sources not generally available
(a letter from a son at camp, told by
someone in a position to know; not read in
the general press, not heard over radio)

(c) it has a specific reference, perhaps to
an incident, a person, a well-defined
locality, a particular set of circumstances
(not "the British are yellow," but: under
such circumstances, cowardice was displayed;
so-and-so is yellow)

All three qualities must be present. Frequently when an opinion is
expressed, if the opinion is challenged, it will be justified by a "fact"
which will be the rumor we are interested in. Reference to Negro-White
friction need not be rumor, but stories of Eleanor Clubs in particular
cities or with regard to particular maids clearly are.

Rumors may be true, partially true, or false. It is an interesting part
of this study to discover what proportion of rumors current are false,
though falsity is not what distinguishes rumor from non-rumor.
