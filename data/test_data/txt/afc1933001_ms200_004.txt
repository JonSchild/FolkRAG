Dear Rae:

Thank you for your good letter. Attached is a check re-ordering
the Gladden-Smith recordings. I will make it clear to any recording
company interested that they must pay a fee of $150.00
to the Library if they wish to publish these tapes. This letter
represents my agreement to the stipulation.

There is interest now in bringing together a full set of the 
John A. Lomax recordings in the Library of Congress for deposit
in the University of Texas Library at some relatively distant
future date. At some point when it would be practical for your 
overburdened staff, I would like an estimate in round figures
for producing this set of duplicates.

My research project goes along well. We are busily engaged in
increasing our statistical codings for a larger and larger world
sample. Four main areas are of continuing difficulty in so far
as obtaining material is concerned: (1) Polynesia and Melanesia;
(2) Siberia; (3) tribal India and southeast Asia; (4) China.
If the Library has holdings in any of these areas which would be
available for copying and purely statistical scholarly use, I 
would like to know about them.

All kind regards to you and George and Harold and your assistants
in the Archive and Recording Lab.

Yours sincerely,

Alan Lomax
