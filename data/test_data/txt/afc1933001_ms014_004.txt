Did father write you of our trip to
South Texas and our recordings of the
native Mexican folk-songs? We plan
as soon as the work of transcription is
complete to send you these records sep-
erately It may be that they are quite
ordinary and little district from Spanish
folk-songs.
 I should imagine you will join me
in the hope that the Lomax expedition
will be less than formerly impeded by
sickness
          sincerely yours
           Alan Lomax
