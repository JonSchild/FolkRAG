Dec. 28, 1945.

Dear Mr. Emrich,
    
Just to remind you that I am urgently in need of additional
material for my Guggenheim application. To wit:
    
1) A statistical and briefly descriptive summary of the collections brought into the 
Archive under my aegis-- whether these were duplication jobs like the 
Barbeau material or field expeditions undertaken forus by other  people.
  
2) The total number of folk song records in the Archive (approximate).
The states and countries covered by the  present collection.
      
If you do not have the time to prepare this material for me, 
send me the annual reports covering the years from 1933 to the present and 
I'll dig out my own information and send the reports back.
                 
But please hurry.  Will write you later about other matters,

Regards,
Alan Lomax
