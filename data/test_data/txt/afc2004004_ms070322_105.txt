for a room. Dublin is full of
people for the horseshow & 
there are no rooms to be 
had. I drove out in the country
out in the seashore and because
I have no friends & no real
satisfactions I could fix
upon nothing.
Came back to town sternly
telling myself that finishing
this script is actually the 
thing I want to do most
and anything else is secondary
Then couldn't find anything
here but a horrible little cream 
& mahogany hutch 5 floors
up in the gloomiest of 1905
houses.
Well, I'll live but, as I 
said to myself this morning; I
hate life & everybody in it.
