July 2, 1938.

Mr. John W. Collier,
17 N. Fairfield Ave.,
Bloomington, Indiana.

Dear Mr. Collier:

I have just been playing over
the Indiana records and have greatly enjoyed
you and your fiddle--your John Roger 
the Miller and your A Little too Small.

The Library greatly appreciates
the kindness you have done it in recording
these songs and in helping out down Brown
County way.

Please give my best regards to
Claude Cryder, Mrs. Rogers and the rest and
remember me.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
