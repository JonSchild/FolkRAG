Dear Alan: Burl Ives has a
right, I suppose, under my
agreement with Columbia to
broadcast our songs, especially
[weth] with your conversing with
him. He ought to be generous
enough to return the favoring
by acknowledging the credit and
not assuming it all for himself.
But I am following up the
Record matter, or will as soon 
as [my] our book is printed
You have probably spilled the
beans by giving Ives the tunes 
before they were actually copyrighted.
I do want you to
return the New York Times story
at once.
