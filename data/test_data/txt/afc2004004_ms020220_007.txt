BJ TAPE 7A, p.4
[*FISHING ON THE GULF*]

BJ:  [An,] Ain' nothin' happen[ed].  I jus' enjoyed bein' there, ya know.
I had never been on the water like that to stay an'...We had to
go over on the ferry.  Wa'n' no roads go over there, then.  I
don't think there's none there yet.  An' um, they had the one,
the train goed there once a day.  That's the Seaboard Allied (Airline?), ya
know.  They go there once a day.  An' when the train go, they
turn the bridge so no one could walk there.  The track ya know,
over there.  They have the bridge turned up an' down the Gulf.
An' so that's the way -- Anyone go over there, have to go back
an' forth on this -- the ferry to go across t' the mainland an'
everything [an'...] else.
AL:  I bet you saw some sharks an' stuff?
BJ:  Oh, I did.  I saw many of those curious things ov' there.  And
You know, the, whatchacallem ol' things?  Them ol' pompous
(porpoises) an' things like that, ya know.  I saw a real one.
The water had lef' one there.
AL:  The what?
BJ:  Ya know, the tide had lef' a pompous too much, so much so
he didn' have enough water to swim in.  That was a big, funny
thing to me!  Heh!  I seen him pretty good.  Like a mule layin'
out there on the, on the on the water.  Until the tide come back, ya know.
An' he struck water.  I didn' see 'im when he struck water, but the
peoples say he really goes fer it when he -- hah, hah -- when
that water get deep enough for him to go.
An' ah, we caught a lot of fishes out there through, about
the pompous, too.  'Cause the pompous drive fishes up in them
lil' schools of, of ah, necks, ya know?  An' they would take 
nets an' go an', an' go up ahead of the pompous, you know, an'
throw it out.  Broth', you got some fish then.  Ooh! fish, fish,
