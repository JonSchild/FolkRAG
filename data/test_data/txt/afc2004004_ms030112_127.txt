MRS. DAVIS:
I'll miss him a whole lot because we would go to service together, I think about it I have to go by myself, I -- give him up and a lot of times him and me would sing together at church he always sing that number about that was the number Revealed Song the Lord give to him SOON MY WORK WILL ALL BE DONE along with many more reveal songs the Lord give to him and he didn't forget them. He would have me get up, if the Lord would give him a number during the night he would tell me I got a new number I want you to get up and write it down, whiles it on my mind I would write it down, There was something peculiar about him, if the Lord would give him a number he wouldn't forget it. He would not forget it but he always told me to write it.
LARRY:
When he would say write it down, that would mean the words.
MRS. DAVIS:
Yeah, write the song down it came to him. I was looking at one of his numbers the other day up in a book he had so many numbers Lord Jesus.
LARRY:
