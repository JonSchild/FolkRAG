John Work, who learned the folksong trade from his eminent father, Frederick J. Work, has been recently active in uncovering some of the most interesting new material in field of Negro folk-song.  He is goint to permit us to copy his record collection for deposit here, and, besides, he requested that the Library furnish him with records to use in recording the folk music of middle Tennessee, and particularly the Negro Sacred Harp singers of Alabama, a unique discovery of Mr. Work's.
Quad approved                                                                    $345.00
13. South America, 1941
At the request of the Librarian, the Archive lent to Lincoln Kirstein for the duration of his South American tour a recording machine.  Mr. Kirstein takes with him Sheamus Doyle of New York City, an accomplished amateur in the field of folk-song, to set as recordist and collector.  Mr. Kirstein plans to tour a number of Latin American countries, and will undoubtedly bring to the Library valuable samplings of Latin American folk-song.
Quad approved                                                                       580.00
14. Mississippi Delta Socio-Musical Survey: Southwestern Virginia records for public release.
In connection with the projected social survey described in the following item and discussed in another memorandum, Dr. Lewis Jones, Dr. John Work, Dr. John Ross of Fisk University, and myself went to the Mississippi Delta in September to make preliminary investigation of the field of the forthcoming study.  This trip resulted in 22 16-inch discs of all types of Negro music from the area, including one very remarkable religious service which is good for public release.
On the same trip I recorded three of the finest ballad singers in Virginia, making records which can be used for pressing purposes.  Virginia is the state from which ballads and ballad tunes spread across the country; Virginia is the traditional style of the ballad collector, and Dr. Davis, editor of Traditional Ballads of Virginia, will, I believe, edit soon for the Library an album of Virginia ballad performances, some of which were recorded on this trip.
