CAJUNS-LOMAX II   -31

He couldn't have a sisterly act with a woman wiping that,
his face with a handerchief.  You've seen musicians sweat.
You've seen how they have to mop themselves.  And that's
what Amadee needed and then so he got death.
     So, you could go back to the end of the other
tape here.
                           :  There's not much on it.  Maybe we should
go onto. . .
LOMAX:  After we tell Amadee's story we can
end Amadee's story maybe with one of the tunes that he made
most popular which is the [Eunice] two-step.  And we could,
we could introduce a lot of other bands doing the [Eunice]
two-step, showing how he actually affected people in terms
of a tune.  Of course, all the testamony that people, views
of him. 
     But that should be not so much him in person
but showing the influence of, of a Afro, what, you know, of,
our friend Jesse Jackson now is demanding that blacks be
called African Americans which puts, gives them a completely
different status than Afro-Americans.  They're, they're
African Americans like Jewish Americans, Irish Americans,
Spanish Americans, right?  They have a clear cut culture.
Right?  And that is in a sense what we're doing here.  So,
Amadee is an African American.  That is he has, he's an
American with clear cut African type culture.
