Dear Alan:

1. See if you can hurry up
an air mail letter to me petitioning
the priorities board for a set of tires 
and tubes. With these new restorations 
we've got to work fast.

2. You might add to the outline 
of my proposed  trip mailed you 
yesterday, my plan to send some
time in the cattle country around 
Alpine and the Davis mountains near 
the Big Bend Country, in the Tayah 
region, in San Praticio New Mexico,
in Pampa, Texas (Woody's section) 
and around Henryetta in eastern 
Oklahoma.
