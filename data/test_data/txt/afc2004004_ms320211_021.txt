LOMAX  But, but and so those were the
places that, where musicians could be regularly employed.
The other employment was casual, was it?
ROSE  Oh yes.
LOMAX  I mean so that people had to do
something else besides play music in order to live.
ROSE  Oh sure.  Almost everybody did
play something, do something other than music.  I mean like
(Manuel Perez) was a cigar maker, and (Pigfu) was a
tinsmith, and Johnny (Sensere) was a plasterer, and I could
go through the whole roster and, and tell you the, the
occupational base for each one.  And it still is true to a
large extent.  But around the district in, in the, in the
area, like on North Rampart Street where the, that was the
tango belt where the white musicians played.  And, but the
white musicians didn't play in the district.
LOMAX  So the, the birth of jazz and,
was, was in the community, in the street.
ROSE  Oh yeah, jazz, jazz was, was a 
thriving art form years and years before Storyville was
instituted.
LOMAX  Now when did, formally, however,
they, the bands were, didn't feature brass as much, did
they?  I mean how, how far. . . .
ROSE  Well. . . .
LOMAX  . . .back does the, does the brass
band go?
