Dear Mr. Potter:

There is one angle of the Rumor Clinics Project which was not
sufficiently covered in the joint memorandum which will have
to be made explicit in order to get the final approval of the
project from our end. That is the question of which material
is to be sent back to the clinics for local dissemination.

There is a strong feeling here that the Office of Facts and
Figures, in its relation with the Committee on War Information
should make the decisions in this field. From what you and
Mr. Williams have said, I am sure you will agree with us in
principle and wouldn't mind putting it in a memorandum for
the records.

Best regards.

Sincerely yours,
Cornelius DuBois
Executive Assistant
Bureau of Intelligence
