Thirty days in the work-house, six long months in jail, 
Thirty days in the work-house, six long months in jail, 
Now they got me in trouble, no one to go my bail.

He poke out his mouth an' went on anyhow. 'An' 'fo' day 
de nex' mornin' he was locked up in jail an' had [six] thirty

I'm a hard-workin' prisoner, sent here without a trial, 
I'm a hard-workin' prisoner, sent here without a trial, 
Now my heat is achin' to stay this great long while.
