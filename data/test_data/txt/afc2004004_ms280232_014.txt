3) For Huntley and Sinclair they both played the tinkler 
Wi' Conscience as black as a crow, man. 
Some Angus, Fife men, they ran for their life, man, 
And ne'er a Lot's wife there at all, man. 

4) And trumpet McClaine was brix wi' a clame, 
Through misfortune he hapened to fall, man. 
By saving his neck, his trumpet did break, 
And come off without music at all, man. 

5) So there sic' a race as was ne'er in that place, 
Such a nice little chase was it all,man. 
Frae each other they run without a drum, 
They did not make use of apoor man. 

6) Whether we run or they run or we won or they won 
Or if there was winning at all, man. 
Save our brave general. . 
Whar first began that war, man. 

7) With the Earl of Seaforth and the Cock of the North 
But Florence ran fastest of all, man. 
Said the Lord of Finaven, I've sworn to be even, 
With a general or peer of them all, man.

A second song in the same battle of Sherifmuir. . . 

1) When we went to the field of war 
And to the warpen-shore, Willy, 
Al for to serve the rightful king 
And chase his foes awa', Willy. 
Lords and lairds come by Aberdeen, 
And o, but they were small, Wilie. 
While pipers played frae right to left
whigs awa' Willy. 
Chorus: 
Up and war them all, Willy, 
Up and war them all, Willy, 
And up and sell your sour milk 
And dance and ding them all, Willy. 

2) And when our army was drawn up 
The bravest I e'er saw, Willy, 
Without a doubt their ranks to rout 
And win the day and a', Willy. 
But o'the brae it wasna play, to get sae hard a fall, Willy,
While pipers played frae right to left [large empty space] whigs awa' Wil
