Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am writing at the suggesting of my former teacher,
Dr. E. P. Kuhl of Iowa University, from Iowa City Ia., to inquire as
to the possible value as folklore material of an old album of
Civil War songs owned by one of my pupils here, and written down by her great grandfather in 1866, with the following explanation:

April the 26 A.D. 1866

"A book of all songs this book is composed of love songs

and war songs.  These songs is rote and sung By Wm.  A.  Larkins

when called upon by his friends.  These are selected from among

the best songs he knows which he believes to be the best 

selected from among the songs in this country.  He is all so 

alearning new songs which will be rote in this book as he learns 

them."

Written by Wm. A. Larkins

The songs includes:
