International House
New York, New York

Dear Madame Comhaire:

I am afraid both the Rosenwald idea and the duplication of 
your records have been delayed bt the fact that I have changed
jobs recently going into the Office of War Information. This 
morning, however, I called the Library to urge them to send your
estimate on the records you want duplicated. About the Rosenwald
fellowship, I have not been quite sure that you were interested
in doing the job in Louisiana we talked over together. Before I 
formally submit the project, I should like such assurance from you.

Would you suggest a group of Hatian songs, not necessarily
folk songs, which symbolize for Hatians the democratic traditions
of your country. I wonder whether you would make a few suggestions
along this line with comments about songs and their historical
background. Are there any Hatian musicians in New York with whom 
you could work out songs dealing with Hatian involvement in the 
war against the Axis.

with best regards, I am 

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
