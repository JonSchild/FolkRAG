THE PREACHER AND THE SLAVE   (Tune: The Sweet Bye and Bye)

Long-haired preachers come out every night
And they tell you what's wrong and what's right
But when you ask them for something to eat
They will answer with voices so sweet

Chorus: You will eat, bye and bye,
In that glorious land above the sky
Work and pray, live on hay,
You'll get pie in the sky when you die   (Repeat cho. after
                                                                       each verse.)
Oh, and the starvation army, they play
And they sing and they clap and they pray
Till they get all your coin on the drum
Then they'll tell you w hen you're on the bum

Holy Rollers and jumper s come out
And they holler, they jump, and they shout
"Give your money to Jesus" they say,
"He will cure all disea ses today."

If you fight hard for children and wife
Try to get something good in this life
You're a sinner and a b ad man, they tell
When you die you will sure go to Hell

Workingmen of all countries, unite
Side by side we for dreedom will fight
When the world and its wealth we have gained
To the grafters we will sing this refrain:

Last chorus:
You will eat, bye and bye,
When you've learned how to cook and to fry
Chop some wood, 'twill do you good,
And you'll eat in the sweet bye and bye.
