befo you git a good bite.  Set right there.  So when the
sun goes down, you understand, that's where you git your
fish.  Maybe you ain't got time to stay but it's time
then for fish to bite.  So -- bout the time the sun went
down on me I bit.  That's the way the biggest majority of
us are caught.  That's right. (A sharp, derisive
little cry of)  A-n-n-d -- I had been
 belongin to the church befo I married.  Looked like she
cared to be such a good Christian woman.  I always did say
I wanted me a Christian woman for a wife.  Cause I didn't
want no ro ugh woman for no wife.  It come to me to marry
somebody, but I didn't know who.  Cause women that I had
come in contact with, I knowed they wouldn't do.  And
now I ask-ed mysef what must I do?  I wasn't in no hurry
bout it.  We lived together five years.  And as soon as I
find that she had a living husband I loosened huh.
Now let me tell you the truth
I don't want to lie. . .It don't 
pay for you to fall to good talk too quick.  (Did she
turn out to be unkind?)  W-e-l-l. . .after I got huh,
she seemed to be. . . . very, very. . . .bitter.  At times.
Most all women is bitter at times.  I don't care how good
they is to you.  They'll be short at times.  There's some
reason or cause for all of us to be short.  It need to
be looked over an considered.  (Do you feel that women are
more bitter than men?)  I'd say that women are more
so b ecause I tell you why, an I believe you bound
to gree wid me bout that.  When you begin to look at it
what you have to ask for, how many places you got to ask
