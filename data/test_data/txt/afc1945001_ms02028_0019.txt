Conduct of War, Cont'd.

"Why do they spend so much time and money in those trials for the sabotuers - Why don't they take them out and shoot them - that is what they would do to us." Aug. 5 - Two working women. 

"I think this trial for the sabotuers is a disgrace. It's just a mockery of real democracy. Those men were going to murder our people and they treat them like kings." Aug. 3 - Housewife

"I'm so disgusted with this trial it makes me sick to read about it. The idea of all those generals wasting their time on a bunch of thugs like that. Why don't they take them out and shoot them? If they let them off from the death penalty, I won't believe in any justice anymore." Aug. 4 - Housewife

"You know what those people would do to us, if we sent some sabotuers over there." "Oh, but this is a democracy, don't you know" (Sarcastic tone) Aug. 7 - Two working women

"I've heard a lot of people say they're going to spend all they can get their hands on because we are going to lose the war anyway. The War Bonds will never be paid back. We will all be asked to contribute them to the Government so you might just as well quit buying them." Aug 8 - Des Moines business man

"I wouldn't be surprised if ten years from now we were asked to make our bonds a contribution to the Government." Aug. 8 - Des Moines businessman
