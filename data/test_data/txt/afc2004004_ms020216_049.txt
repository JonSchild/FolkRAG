guide and led by the way -- you know what I mean? -- by the way, 
the the courage an' by the understandin' of how to use yourse'f 
on the water to keep from getting drowned.   'Cause if you tilt 
and cain't swim, you know what's gonna happen to ya, see?   You 
know.   An' so, that's it.   An' you cain't handle -- An' you cain't 
float God's word.   Because His, His word's gonna stand forever. 
He's in the bottom of the sea, was down there with Jonah.   See? 
He, he went down; he thought he was [high] hidin' and not of God's word. 
You can't float it up on the top, ya see?   He was down there 
with 'im.   An' he prayed [to Him] in the belly of the whale.   See, 
he was in Hell, he said, see!   So He's down there; you cain't, you cain't 
float Him; He's in it.
