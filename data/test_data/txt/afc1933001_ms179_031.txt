Dear Mr. Sulzer:
As folk-lore consultant on the radio project, I was
delighted to read your cordial letter about the documentary
series we are about to release.
The potentialities of your contacts in the mountains
are very great and although it doesn't appear that we
can do anything about this material at the  moment, I
want you to know that I hope to some day.
As you are probably aware, the Archive of American
Folk-song of which I am in charge, has been documentin[g?]
sources of regional music and folk lore for some tim[e?]
and your listening posts would be ideal starting
points for research in the mountain region.  Our
plan now are to do a little documenting wherever
we record folk songs with the hope that perhaps the
material will be useful for broadcasting in some way
or other.  Your letter, therefore, is quite welcome
and I hope we can make something positive grown out
of this suggestion of yours.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
