He tole me to go to the pool an wash.  He spit upon the ground an made
clay an tole me to wash.  I did as he tole me to do an I can see."
     I want you to know, my friends, God is a man who we must
b'lieve in.  His son Jesus that came bringin light to the world that we
all might see that he is the son of the livin God. . . . . . . . .(?)
an mighty in his strength.  Wrapped hissef up in mortal flesh
that we might see that he was the son of the livin God.  In order
to prove himself he walked around heah thirty-an d-three long yeahs.
An aftah his time was up he give up the ghost an died.  Last words he
said, "It is finished."
     An I'm tellin you, my friends, that the time is comin when
the sun is goin down with us.  We must finish our work, because when
night comes no man can work.  An while we realize that no man can work
let us make it to be our business that we might do all that we have
to do while daylight is shinin.  Because the time will come when day-
light will disappear from us.  Death will come an rob us of what
breath that we have in ouwah bodies.  When we stretch out an look
death in the face, we will be able to say as Paul has said,
"I have fought a good fight.  I have kep the faith."  May God bless
you.  May God hep you.  May Good keep you.

Rev. Davis:  It would fit into the time of life. . .fur people to
consider. . .that they had to die, that time was runnin short.
