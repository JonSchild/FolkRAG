Dear Dr. Spivacke: 
I have your letter of October 22nd; and am delighted 
to be informed that the budget for the field study in Coahoma County 
has been approved by the Library of Congress. I believe we have an 
opportunity to do a significant study here, and you may count upon 
us for our best effort. 
For the past two weeks we have had two field workers 
in Coahoma County doing some interviewing and locating musicians and 
other significant individuals and situations, for recording after 
the cotton picking season is over. This should be somewhere between 
November 15th and December 1st. In addition to these field interviewers, 
two trips have been made by Dr. Mark H. Watkins, our anthropologist; 
Mr. Lewis Wade Jones, our rural sociologist and field supervisor; 
and one trip by Mr. John Work of the Music Department. A 
part of the time, our field workers have been working with the cotton 
pickers in the field. These workers are here today for conferences, 
and will probably remain a week or two, working up their materials, 
and resuming their normal seminars, until the second field period 
starts in November. 

They have brought from the field some exceedingly interesting 
material, and as it is copied I shall deposit a copy with 
the Library. 
With best wishes, 
Sincerely yours, 
Charles S. Johnson
