Hey, boy-
Ain't ya ready to go?
It ain't time yet
But you got to go.

A-get up soon
Put on your clothes
And you git ready
Git ready to roll.

A-my boss tol me
To tell you so
That I ain't got go
But you got to roll.

Come on, boys
Day is breakin
Sun is shinin'
And you got to go.

The mules is hitched
In the latch
You got to go
And get that dirty spot.

Ain't you ready?
A-boy, ain't you ready?
A-let's go
A-boy, ain't you ready?

A-let's go
A-boy ain't you ready?

Yonder come Mr. Charlie
With that great 44
He got that stick
And he mean to go.

He got his pistol
In his hand
He'll kill somebody
Or he's gon' kill some man.

Ain't you ready?
A-boy, ain't you ready?

Let's go
The cook's got the meal-
On the table,  if you don't eat
Because you ain't able

Mr. Charlie
see you 'fore you go
He gonna ask you why
