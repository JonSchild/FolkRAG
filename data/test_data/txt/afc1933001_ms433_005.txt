My Country

Harvey P. Moyer

My country, thou shalt be
Sweet land [f]ofi liberty
When justice reigns 
When darkness turns to light
When wrongs are changed to right
When truth asserts her might
And breaks our chains.

Then poverty shall cease
Wealth, comforts, joys increase
On every hand 
None shall know want or care
Earth's bounties all shall share 
Rejoicing ev'rywhere
Oh, blessed land.

Great God, we cry to thee
Love, wisdom, liberty
To us be gi ven
Help  us to see the right,
Thy children all unite
Lead us in vistorous fight
Till earth be heaven.
