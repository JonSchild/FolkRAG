Ritchie" That's like Lovin' Hannah. The words of it. Well - we say
"church" instead of "mass" because I guess we're Protestants!
I roved to church last Sunday,
My true love passed me by,
I knew her mind was changing
By the roving of her eye.

Never Wed an Old Man: Jeann Robertson.
1)  For an auld man come courting me,
Hi-doo-a-darrity,
For an old man come courting me,

Hi-doo-a-darrity,
Maids when you're young never wed an old man.

2)  When we went to the church, I left him in the lurch,
When we went to the church, me being young.
When we went to the church, I left him in the lurch,
Maids when you're young, never wed an old man.

4)  When we went to our bed he lay as he were dead.
