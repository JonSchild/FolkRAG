Dear Friend:
Pursuant to our agreement, made at the time you recorded your songs for me, I have found
a company prepared to release them (some of those not taken by Atlantic Records).
This company is:  Prestige Records, Inc., 203 So. Washington Ave., Bergenfield, New Jersey.
They have paid me an advance for the whole set of records, and I am sending you your share
of said advance, carefully calculated in terms of the actual time taken up by your performance
on each side of this set.
This payment is advance against performance royalties  If the record concerned ever pays
back its advance, Prestige will send you additional performance royalties.  I must warn 
you however, that sales for this type of record are general small, and it is likely
to be some time - if ever - before you receive additional performance royalties.
In addition, Prestige will pay certain extra royalties to the lead singer and arranger
on each song as copyright fees.  These royalties will be paid to Lochrae Publishing Co.,
485 Madison Ave., N.Y.C., who are attempting to copyright the songs in your behalf.  They
will send you your share of any such payments.  Here again, you must understand that most
of the songs on this record are arrangements of old folk songs, and that your copyright
royalties are usually recognition of your contribution to the song, rather than your
authorship of it.  The principal reason for this copyrighting is in the hope that one of
you may be lucky, and have a song picked up by a popular recording group, whose records
sell well, and through whom you might receivea substantial sum.  Otherwise, it is unlikely
that your song royalties will be more than slight.
For those of you who receive advances because your material was published by Atlantic, I
must explain that Prestige is a much smaller company, that the total advance was far less
and, that the sales will be correspondingly smaller.  Therefore, your advance and your
royalties will probably be somewhat reduced.
As the records will be released around Christmas time, I'll give Prestige instructions to
send each of the principal sings a copy.  However, it is completely impossible to send
every individual participating in the record a copy. This, if you do not receive one, you 
will have to go to the leader of your singing group to hear what the song sounded like.
Some of you misunderstood the meaning of 1 paragraph in the original contract, which has to
do with the performances of the records on the radio.  By this I meant, performances directly
from my original tapes.  As you know, records are played constantly on the radio, and
usually no fees are collected for this.
It has taken me 8 months to sell and to edit this material for publication- I think I have 
found the best available outlet for you, and I hope this release will give pleasure and
benefit to you.
Yours cordially,
Alan Lomax
