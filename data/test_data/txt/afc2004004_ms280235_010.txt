Lomax: Did you go hungry lots of times ? 

Barry: No - that's a thing I never did do is go hungry. 

Lomax: Did an awful lot of men try and seduce you ? 

Barry: Oh no. They might have, but I was very clever. A lot of 
women and girls, no matter how clever they are, get taken in. 
But that's one thing my mother and father always said. "Play a 
bit of music and sing in a twpn or village. Get a couple of 
shillings, then go away and get your lodgings." I always had 
that in my mind. 

Lomax: Then for years you just wandered around Ireland ? 

Barry: Wandered around, and I had a fine life, in a certain way. 
Of course, I got a little hardship egere and there, and sometimes 
I might be singing out in the rain. 

Lomax: Did you ever get thrown in jail ? 

Barry: I did not. That's one thing - I never got one day in 
jail. Never was in jail. That;s one good thing. 

Lomax: What's the strangest thing ever happened to you ? 

Barry: Lots of miseries. Went I went down to Lizmore in County 
Cork, I had an awful time. I had a nice little boarding place to 
myself there. But I had to go to City Cork first and do the

people. They never done singing in the streets. They all played 
in big orchestras, dance halls. I was kind of like afraid that 
they might come up andsay, "Look at her , look at her. Singing 
around the streets and carrying-on. Why don't you get some place 
and work ?" That's one thing I couldn't do, house-keeping, or 
anything like that. But for music and singing, I was all the time 
after it. 
I was in Lizmore - this violin player was going to learn me 
this song. He had a copy of it. He met me in Lizmore, and he 
was playing in the street, playing for his living, and he met 
me and was talking to me. Course, I knew him before that. I met 
him in Waterford and several places. One way and another I 
couldn't like him. I should have married him because he was a 
musician like myself. I think the two of us could have got on very 
well. But I wasn't in love with him when the fiddle wasn't in his 
hands. I asked him, "Would you learn me the song I can't read music." 

He says, "I will." and he took the violin and started playing fot 
me, and he gave me a copy of it. Well, then I was in a boarding
