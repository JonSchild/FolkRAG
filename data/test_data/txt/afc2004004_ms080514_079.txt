the men used to come in from the farms, and

the - where he played were in the barns [barrooms].  And ah, 
his wife ah makes it clear that she got tired 
of going to those barns, because nothing was 
happening, except Denis was leaving the stand 
and going and dancing with girls who invited 
him.  And ah, she was home, bearing one child 
after the other.  Ah, she said: Well, I'll just 
leave that to him.

having a lot of sex, feels very uncomfortable 
when their ah greybeard ah grandmothers and 
grandfathers, ah, ah, like to have some too.
