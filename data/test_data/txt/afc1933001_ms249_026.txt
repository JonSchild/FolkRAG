The Family Circle

Of Thine Own 
By Ethel Ristine 
For too long a time churches have 
taught the song "Hear the Pennies Dropping" 
and fathers and mothers have fostered 
the habit of sending their children
off to church school with an offering of 
the smallest coin in the realm. As a result,
little coins are considered "big money" 
when they go to church. And many adults
have never outgrown this opinion!
Only through a systematic and right
method of giving can we gain a Christian
scale of values. Giving as stewardship will 
bring us and our children a spiritual blessing. 
In the recognition of God as owner, 
and us as administrators of all that he has 
placed in our hands, there comes a sense
of sacred trust. Our giving and our spending 
will then be made in the light of enrichment 
of personality and contribution to 
the building of the kingdom of God. There 
will come a sharing of God's compassion for 
human life and human need. In this spirit, 
we give because we love.
As Christians, we should devote a certain
portion of our income to the support of 
persons and institutions which will definitely
express and extend the teachings of Jesus;
and, when we place our giving within our 
budget, we should respect and handle this
money as efficiently as we do the rest of our
business. Our failure in this and the loss 
of character development which results is 
due chiefly to carelessness. The beginning 
of giving as a system can be taught to the 
very young child.
Jane, an eight-year-old friends of mine 
is given a small weekly allowance. One 
tenth of it is put into a bank for others. 
From this she makes a regular pledge to 
her church and uses the duplex envelopes 
in her giving. Because her tithe is small, 
it is supplemented by her parents, just as
her spending needs are supplemented.
There are certain of Jane's expenses for 
which she is responsible. It is interesting to 
note her change in attitude. Where she 
used to always be begging for a nickel or 
dime now mother merely has to say, "You 
have your own money." Often Jane, after
evaluating, decides she would rather use the 
money for something else. 
Then there is a small book bank. Daddy
is the banker and Jane's savings are deposited 
and withdrawn as at a regular bank.
She is keenly interested in these savings. 
Last summer, when vacation came, the 
family was planning a trip. Each one contributed 
to the expenses, Jane volunteered 
to contribute half of her savings. This was 
given to Daddy for the trip, which she enjoyed 
much more because she shared in
 making it possible. Then she asked for the 
balance of her savings to "just throw away 
on her trip." The money was given her, 
but she spent little more than her regular 
allowance and redeposited almost all she
 had withdrawn when they returned. She
 had learned the value of giving, saving, and 
spending. Now her allowance can be increased 
and greater responsibilities added. 
The way to become Christlike is to practice 
Christlikeness: so the way to develop a 
generous, expanded life is by intelligent, purposive 
giving. The educative value of giving
must not be lost sight of with our boys and 
girls. It is important what giving does to 
our children. Their gifts will have more 
significance and their character be ennobled 
if they are trained to share, rather than 
merely passing on money handed to them 
on Sunday morning. 
Giving is an act of worship. Through giving 
we are extending our lives and personalities 
into places where we cannot go ourselves. 
Giving is Christianity in action. 

Blessed Are the Merciful 
(For the Story Hour)
By Gertrude Della McKelvey 
Betsy loved her new teacher, Miss Allen.
Why she couldn't tell. Maybe it was because 
every morning Miss Allen told a 
story to the boys and girls who arrived in 
school for the first bell. She called them 
"Stories to Live By."
"I've a grand idea," Mabel announced 
to Betsy as the girls walked home from 
school. 
"What now?" asked Betsy eagerly. 
"Well, I've been wondering why we 
don't start a club and ask Miss Allen to be 
our leader."
"Oh, heavenly!" sang out Betsy. "Let's 
start planning now."
The Cheery Club began a week later
with Miss Allen as leader. Its purpose was 
to do good, to spread cheer and to show 
kindness always, At each meeting the girls 
decided to report the good they had found 
to do, and then they would vote on the 
deed they felt to be the most outstanding.
The girl who won the cote for the best 
deed was to receive a verse from Miss
Allen which fitted her deed and each girl 
was given a little book in which to write

Chickadee 
By 
Orlo Evan 
Wheeler 
Hello! Hello! Chickadee, 
Friends for dinner? Three I see,
Gouging out those bits of suet 
Like they saw no limit to it-
Calling all the while they do it, 
"Chick-a-dee-dee Chickadee."

Each a clever acrobat
Jumping, turning this way, that, 
Hanging downwards by his feet- 
Pausing now and then to greet
Incoming friends and still repeat, 
"Chick-a-dee-dee Chickadee."

Welcome! Welcome! Chickadee, 
Days are cheerier, seems to me, 
When the feeding shelf without
Lures each jolly gadabout
Near enough to hear him shout,
"Chick-a-dee-dee Chickadee."

her own verses. The book was to be 
called, "My Guide Book of Verse."
Betsy tried particularly hard those first 
weeks to do a good deed, but one day as
she walked to the club meeting she knew
she hadn't;t done so well. She had helped 
her mother and had been cheerful, but she
hadn't;t won a verse yet and the club was 
almost a month old!
But she would be cheerful anyways she 
though, as she hurried on to club. Then
 it was that Betsy saw a sad little face 
looking out of the window of the house she 
was passing. Betsy looked again and slowed
her pace, Yes, there were tears tumbling 
down the cheeks of the foreign-looking girl
at the window, and Betsy realized she had 
seen the girl at school. 
This was too much for Betsy, who could 
not bear to see anyone unhappy. She went 
up to the door to knock when it was 
opened by the teary little girl, who smiled
ever so little and said, "Won't you come
in?"
"Thank you, but I can't stop, I am on my
way to club," said Betsy. "Wouldn't you like 
to go with me?"
"Oh, yes I would like that," answered 
the girl. Her face beamed with joy as 
she hurried to put on her coat. 
Betsy arrived a little late, but she introduced 
her new friend to the girls. "This 
is Marie who has come from France to live 
with her aunt until the war is over. I 
thought maybe we could help her to feel 
more at home in America."
Marie sat next to Betsy and heard the 
girls report their deeds. 
"It's your turn, Betsy," called Miss Allen.
"Just the usual things like helping 
mother," responded Betsy. "That's all."
"Why Betsy," laughed Mabel, "you 
don't know a good deed when you have it
right with you."
"Miss Allen," Jane, the president, spoke. 
"I think all the girls will agree that Betsy
 should have the verse this week. She has
 helped to make Marie happy."
"Oh yes, very, very happy," added Marie. 
So Betsy won her first verse. It was 
"Blessed are the merciful for they shall
obtain mercy."
When Miss Allen repeated the verse she
said, "Betsy, Jesus knew how to live this 
verse, because it was his very own; and you,
my dear, are learning how to live it also."

Unconquered
The boisterous March winds have brought
a great parade of kites to our street! Every 
lad in the block is flying a gayly colored 
beauty; their shrieks of delight are some-
times intermingled with cries of distress
when strings get tangled, and several times 
I have watched someone drag a forlorn 
and broken thing.
My own son just rushed in with a tattered 
wreck and when I exclaimed that is 
was too bad, he laughed, "Oh, that's nothing; 
I'm making another one!"
I continue to marvel at this something 
wishing the human heart that will not be 
conquered!
Two years ago, I read a story that ex-
