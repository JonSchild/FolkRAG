OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To: Eugene Katz Date: April 10, 1942

From: Neil DuBois 

Subject:     
If it's rumors you are collecting, here's a honey. You probably
know of the three persons names in the correspondence: Roy
Dickinson and Messrs. Palmer and Meade of Printers' Ink.

Maybe you could get Meade to tell you more about the source of
this story.
