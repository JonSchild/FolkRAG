Mr. O'Connor: (continued)

4. On August 11, Mr. D, a traveling salesman, told me that
he just took a cab from Pennsylvania Station and that
while in the course of the conversation the taxi driver
asked him if he wanted to buy any "A" gas ration stamps 
for a quarter each. The salesman said he needed some 
stamps and would be willing to pay the quarter apiece.
The driver then said he was sorry he couldn't sell him
any because the cab wasn't his but if he wanted to buy
some he could do so from practically anybody.

I heard another variation of this rumor on August 13,
when Mr. E told me "don't you know you can get "A" gas
ration stamps for a quarter apiece, but they are all
counterfeit".

5. On August 13, Mr. F said that he had met a guy who
worked in one of the largest hospitals in New York and
that this guy told him he just got a call from the
hospital that the whole staff had to leave at once
because a terrible disaster had happened. Mr. F
inquired as to where the disaster was but the hospital
employee said he knew nothing more. Mr. F said he
became very surprised because he hadn't heard anything
on the radio about this. He further said that after
he left the guy he turned on the radio but still didn't
hear anything about the disaster. He said he was very
worried over this because maybe it was so bad the radio
and newspapers couldn't mention it. [*New York, Aug 13*]

6. On August 14, Mr. G told me that according to remarks
he heard from several people the attack of the U. S.
Navy on the Solomon Islands was being made only to
take away attention from the European War. The opening
of a second front in Europe was more important but
because the Allies were not ready for it the attack in
the Pacific was made. [*4*]

Very truly yours,
