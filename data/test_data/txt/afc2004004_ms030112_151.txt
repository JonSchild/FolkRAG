LARRY: hey baby look what we got. But thats good in a way its 
in the bank but I'm really not sharing it with who I'd 
like to share it with. You know.
MRS. DAVIS: Well you could share it with your children you know.
LARRY: Oh yeah, that I have them.
MRS. DAVIS: With your wife too.
LARRY:
I will, but theres still something missing you know. Just 
like Brother Davis told me once, you know whem me and her broke 
up and he was telling me Larry go back to your wife, just like you 
did always. But then again he told me he said that Larry even if 
you do go back theres this he said Marriage is like a rope if you 
stretch it and stretch it and stretch it and then the rope breaks. 
And you can tie it back and it be stronger than ever was but that knot 
is there,
MRS. DAVIS: That knot is there.
LARRY: Theres a knot there.
MRS. DAVIS: And I heard him.
LIONEL: Larry do you want to go back on that.
