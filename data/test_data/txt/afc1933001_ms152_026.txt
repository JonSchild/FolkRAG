In this fiddlers' convention each contestant had the right to
play two tunes of his own choice and there was a great variety
of selections, including Grey Eagle, Old Hen and Chickens,
Sourwood Mountain, Turkey Buzzard, Old Blue Eagle, and Napoleon
Crossing the Rocky Mountains, which several contestants chose
to render. This tune seemed to be a favorite and one which is 
was stated was local to that part of Tennessee. This, however,
proved to be an error, for it was found to be also popular in
parts of North Carolina and in Kentucky. Dean William Jesse
Baird of Berea College heard it in Pine Mountain and tells this
story about it:   "Uncle John" delighted in playing for visitors
and sooner or later he would say, "Now, I want to play you my 
favorite; I calls hit Napoleon Crossing the Rocky Mountains."
One day a teacher at Pine Mountain said, "Uncle John, you mean
Napoleon Crossing the Alps."   "I don't know, maybe I do," he
replied. Sometime later he was playing for a visitor and at 
his usual point announced, "Now I want to play you my favorite;
I calls hit Napoleon Crossing the Rockies. Some folks say
Napoleon never crossed the Rockies, that he crossed the Alps,
but historians differ on that point."
