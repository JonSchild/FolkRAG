         So they went back to see about ah -- they was lookin' for the cows
an; things; that's [when] where they [found,] found the cows, in [thea] that
great squash that had grown so big.   The cows an' the hawgs was
down there.  They had to git the great saw to saw that stem offa
there an' then they could let'm (let them) out through by the stem.
They come out through an' -- ha, ha, ha, ha! -- through that stem.  Oh,

         An' they was messin' around with that corn.  Said they had

makin' it.   When they got 'way up there, [say] said they see somethin'
flyin' out on the edge of the top of the thing, comin' down  an'
goin' back.   With roastin' ears, back wi' roastin' ears.   Says
they know if the angels of Heaven comin' down an ' get roastin'
ears -- hah -- they wouldn't bother with that no mo'!   Ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, hum, hum!
