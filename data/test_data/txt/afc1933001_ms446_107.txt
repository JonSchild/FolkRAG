Far across the burning sand,
She is thinking of her happy wedding day. 

3 

On the fields of meditation
As she sees her Isaac grand, 
The camel would not hold her as before; 
She ran up to her Isaac
And she gave to him her hand, 
Lamb and bride as wife and husband evermore. 

4 

Now, my friends, would you meet Isaac 
Like Rebecca give your hand, 
And abide in peace with Him forevermore? 
You must ride the earthly camel
Far across life's burning sand, 
And you'll land on Canaan's happy golden shore. 

No.  14  There Will Be Light at the River

Many years I've wandered in the lowland dim; 
And no hope of my Savior could I see,
But He sought and found me,
Now I'm trusting in Him. 
There'll be light at the river for me. 

CHORUS 

There'll be light, glorious light for me; 
When the end of my journey I see; 
There'll be light, wonderful light for me, 
There'll be light at the river for me. 

2 

Nothing now can harm me, He is at my side, 
All my joy and comfort is He. 
In his holy presence I am satisfied.
