Dallas, Texas
Dec.13

Dear Alan,
It's been very lovely to hear your voice come out
of our little box radio every Tuesday. So far I have enjoyed 
most of all the teamsters and rafters program, and of the 
instrumental adaptations I have enjoyed most David Guion's and
De Philippi (o?) or perhaps Felipi. Anyway, they two seem to
me to hit upon some happy variations and adaptations without
playing out of tune, or off the key! which shows how much 
I know about the composition. We are glad that Bess can help you.
I'm only sorry that this particular program comes at a time
when she must make a special trip from Texas rather than
from nearer-by Philadelphia. We didn't understand your plan
for a trip South. I hope your itinerary includes Texas, and
preferably around Christmas week when Shirley and Johnny
are more likely to be here. Shirley is bemoaning the fact
that she has not seen you for three years. Johnny will be
in and around Luling until about the 23rd. Is Elizabeth able
to make this trip with you? I gathered from what Bess told
us that E. has been ill. I am very sorry. I hope you found
the trouble and got it relieved. Of course if she comes to
Dallas we want her to visit with us too. I have had two
conversations with Mrs. Harrold about your programs, but none
since Bess's letter about Elizabeth's not feeling well. She
(Mrs. Harrold) said she would telephone me of she had any new
news about your plans. I wrote Mr. Weaver a card when you
announced the date of the ox-driving song. I hope he heard
it. Let us know if (or when, I hope it will be) to expect
you, and bring Elizabeth. If the Lomax stirring around is too
much for her all the time she can seek refuge at her mother's
at times. Mrs. Goldman in Austin told me in great detail
the following story: She and her daughters were telling some
friends about you when you were a little fellow, how they always
saved the first flower and the first fruits for you. In a pause
in the conversation, some one turned on the radio, and the first
sound was your voice. The Goldmans were all deeply touched.
Many people in Austin and elsewhere have spoken to us of your
programs, and of course we have felt very proud of and for you.
Our Negro boy Mike always stops his work to listen. Mrs. Casteel
