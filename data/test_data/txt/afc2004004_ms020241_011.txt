An' the man told them same thing. An' so he figured, Now, 
if this woman go in there with him, maybe nothin' won't bother 'em. 
'Cause always been mens stoppin' in there now for the last 5 or 
6 years, ya see, an' nobody can't stay. So he told the man the 
ha-- the house wasn't so well, ya know? He just said, [that] SAID, "[If] But if 
you can stay there," said...
Said, "Oh, yes," said, "Me an' my wife can stay." Say, 
"Yeah, yeah."
So, when he got there, didn't have no matches. He went up-
stairs. An' ah, so the, an' the woman, they looked all around up 
there an' they come right back down an' they had eat, too, an' every-
thing, an' fed the baby.
So she sit there an' he said, "There ain't no matches here 
to make a fire with." He, he didn' have none. So it' about a 
mile from there before ya git to anybody's house. An' he left 
to go git some matches. An' the peoples was tellin' about how bad the 
house was. He was a young coward (?) guy. 'Stead a him gittin' 
the peoples to go wit' him back there to git his wife, he didn't 
go back at all. He stayed with -- He stayed; he didn't go back. 
Too scared to go back. An' he, an' he didn't stay at all. An' 
there she sittin' there with that young baby.
An' things happen. Everything happens, see? But she had to 
take it. She didn' know where to go if she run. An', an' the 
baby's young. 
An' so...Lil' later on, he didn't come, she set to the winda 
for him, lookin' out the winda for him. So, first thing she said 
she heard, a walkin' upstairs, laughin', talkin' gigglin', all 
kinda -- look like a crowd a peoples. An' so she said she took 
it. She didn't know what else to do but stay dere.
