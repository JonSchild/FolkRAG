[*STORY OF GUS, THE LUNATIC WHO WALKED*]
         I know there's a man there, around there home, when I was
small, we called Gus.  He would go bare-feeted all through the
winter.  You know, would go in people's houses an' sleep under
the beds or in the beds an' walk the streets like that.  You know,
break in?  But he mos'ly wanted to break in while lil' girls was
there, if he could!  Heh, heh!  He'd stay outdoors an' holler,
"I'm co-old. . . I'm co-cold. . ."   Heh, heh, all like that.  But he
wasn't crazy.  You know, wasn' all that crazy, but he would do
that; he wouldn't stay home, you know, much.  Nowhere much, jus'
walk.  They'd tell 'im to stay over there.  They thought the
parents would ah, you know, would ah, was mean to him.  He,
he jes' had a mother; didn' have no father.  He was grown, full-grown
man, when I seed 'im.
         But that's one thing I saw when somebody -- We would,
we would run from him when we see him comin' down the road,
them ol', ol' footsteps.  Crack up.  Ha, ha.  Wouldn't wear no
shoes, har'ly.  Papa an' them, diffrunt peoples gave 'im their
shoes.   He'd wear 'em a lil' while, but he'd take 'em off.  He'd
go bare-feeted -- Along in them days, it snowed at my home,
ya see.  Snow would be most every winter.  Mama had to stop up
the cracks of the windas, you know, to keep snow out.  That
bugger be[hind] out in that snow, down that road. (?)  Sometimes he'd 
double up on the steps.  An' Paw an' them would let him in the
house an' he'd git warm,
         He'd go home an' he'd go on again.  Liable to walk 'way far,
you know, some -- other side a town.  He just known in the 
neighborhood to walk. Tha's all.
     Now, he wasn't crazy.  Just couldn't he'p himself, I
reckon, but walk
