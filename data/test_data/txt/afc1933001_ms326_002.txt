     Here's the big catalogue of used records. They vary in playing quality and appearance from excellent E, to good G, to fair F, to poor P. The separate sides of a few, especially Armstrongs rescued from nickel machines, vary in quality. These are indicated.
     Minimum order: $1.00. Discs mailed anywhere in U.S. CO.D.  On orders over $7.50 I'll pay postage, an will accept cash or money orders, thus eliminating C.O.D. charges.
     Prices subject to change without notice.  Since all records are subject to prior sale please include list of substitutes with your order.
    IMPORTANT.  I am planning to stay in the record business for some time, issuing catalogues of new and used records as circumstances require.  But I cannot afford to send them out to people about whom I know nothing but their possible addresses.  So, on receipt of this list WILL YOU PLEASE DROP ME A POST CARD, indicating any change in address and whether you wish to receive
future catalogues.  No obligation to buy, of course.  Those I don't hear from will be dropped from my files. THANK YOU.
