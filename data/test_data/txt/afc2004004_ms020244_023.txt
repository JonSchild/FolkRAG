SHORTENIN' BREAD

A song for corn-shelling and other parties

CHORUS:  Mama's baby loves shortenin', shortenin',
Mama's baby loves shortenin' bread,
Mama's baby loves shortenin', shortenin',
Mama's baby loves shortenin' bread.

Two at the feet and two at the head,
One turned over and he done said,   (CHORUS)

Don't mind the oven, don't mind the lid,
Mama's gonna cook some shortenin' bread,  (CHORUS)
