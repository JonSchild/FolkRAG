"There's no sense in talking about a second front until you've
got a million men to send in there.  You might just as well dig a hole out 
there and tell two or three hundred thousand men to jump in it.  If you 
sent a hundred thousand men over to France, Germany would knock 'em off in 
no time and tell us to send them some more.  Let's talk about a second front 
when we've got a million or two men to talk with.  We haven't got them yet."
