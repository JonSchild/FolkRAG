I have many things to tell you, but it wouldn't do to write 
them all down, for many reasons. It would be a bit difficult anyway
to cover two and a half years of one's life in a single letter.
On my several trips East I have missed you - you are as 
elusive as quicksilver. Of course, December is a long ways off, but
it is possible that I may be in N.Y. during the Xmas-New Year week.
I doubt very much if I'll get to Washington, but is it possible that
you will be in N.Y. at that time? If a collaborator on one of the
"World's Greatest Books" should deign to answer, he may do so at

9711 Parkgate Ave.,
Cleveland, Ohio

Sincerely,
Marie Prince
