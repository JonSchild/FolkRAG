Draft

Mother worried her 19-year old son's desire to enlist in the Marines, 8-14-42: "I think that all these 18 and 19-year old boys will be drafted after November so he might as well go in the Marines now, even though he seems too young to me. But I don't want anyone to think I am not all for my country - I just hate to see these babies go." 
Nineteen-year old fellow, 8-12-42: "They told me down at the draft board they had all of the 18 and 19-year old kids classified by age groups and that as soon as elections are over they will be taken in." 
Employment official, 8-15-42: "There is a lot of confusion between draft boards on the physical classification, particularly of those who might be in 4F. For example, an arrested TB case in the one county will be 4F and in the adjacent county will be 1A, and the man in 4F never knows how long he will stay there because the requirements apparently change. The unsatisfactory thing is that some of the local boards apparently aren't as well informed about the changing regulations as others, so there are inter-county differences." 
Employment official, 8-15-42: "All the fellows are going to summer school this year and taking a heavy schedule so they can complete two full years, so that they will be eligible for deferment from draft to complete their education."
