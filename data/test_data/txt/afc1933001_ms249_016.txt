try until hunger begins to press. In
Texas I am forced by the fast
that no music teacher or leader
of the "cultured" element has ever
had one second of praise, or shown
the least sign of interest, in our
folk song work. To hell with
them if I can exist without
them, say I.
3. I agree with you that Modern
Music gives Our Singing Country
an unparalleled review. Has 
Mr. Spivacke read it? Does Modern
Music have standing or influence?
What does Carl Engels say?
4. At least from now on I can
promise you less frequent letters
that call for your attention.
Do your darndest, and never
mind the splinters.
