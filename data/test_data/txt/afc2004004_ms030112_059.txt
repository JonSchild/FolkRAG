MRS:DAVIS:
would say if you go to a doctor maybe you could see
again, He says "NO, if the lord wanted me to see, He wouldn't
have made me blind." I don't think there were no hopes for him
he told me a number of times (?).

LARRY:
I bet it was very hard for him to accept that.

MRS. DAVIS:
I don't know. _______________________ He was a very happy 
blind man.

LARRY:
Oh yeah, by the time I met him he was happy himself, and
he made people happy around him.

MRS. DAVIS:
Yes, he was.

LARRY:
So you say one day he come walking down the street past 
your house?

MRS. DAVIS:
Well he was passing my house, going someplace to play
for somebody. ______________________ He was playing beautiful
numbers and my sister was calling me, I came running in, and
he got to playing so nice so I said I thing yo all need a good
cook. Thats all, I don't know. I never been with a blind man
didn't know how it feels (?) So, pretty soon me and him got
engaged after we was engaged it was a whole year before I
married him.
