your family and yourself.
Sincerely yours,

And, as I send this letter, a swarm of other questions overwhelms
me. Do you know my good friend , Mackie Langham
Bennett, former Instructor in English at the U. of T.,
now married to an oilman who makes his headquarters in
Lafayette? If not, you [x] might look her up, she's an 
engaging person. Have you ever figured out what "Les
Clefs de la Prison" has to say. There seem to be a number 
of ways of looking at the song. My interpretation runs
as follows: a) The boy says to his [girl-friend] ["Babe], they've
given me the keys to the prison b) She replies, what do you
mean, the keys to the prison, when the officers have them
hung around their necks? c) I mean they're coming after me
at nine to hang me at ten. [l)] And what grieves me most 
is that I've got to know my death such a long time in advance.
d) His father is tearing out his hair on his knees.
e) How could I have left you, have gone away from you except
to prison. f)  [C] (c)  again. g) [Baby] yes you take my body
to the grave with my beautiful (?) horse, and my black carriage
and [my] the four red wheels. Or is it a conversation between
a boy and his parents. Or what? What does shausse mean?
I have been over your transcriptions a number of
times and have made what I think are some corrections. Would
you like to see the results?.. especially in "J'ai passe
[lo] au long du bois."
