Dear Mr. Lomax -

Sterling Brown and Horace Mann Bond
have written to me regarding a proposed plan
which you have in the realm of Negro folk
music -- saying that I should write to you
in prospect of service which I may be able
to render.

At this time, with only a faint idea
of the scope of the work, I can only say that
I am vitally interested and that I should be
more than glad to work with you on the
project.

May I say, modestly, that my qualifications
are real and unique. I have 
made studies of the music and folk-lore
of my people for more than twenty years.
