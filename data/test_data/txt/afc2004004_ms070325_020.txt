friend of Tzara's.  Was I so disrespectful
because someone had 
told me he hadn't written anything
in 20 years.  But then I have
never written anything at all.
   Will Robin come back to me and
love me?  One but not both, not
unless she has changed.  For I 
am less.  These days I have to
drive myself to work.
   Tonight I took Milton [Singer?]
& Helen to dinner.  They are old
friends.  He was on this side when
in college & so was she, tho both
more careful than I.  Now he
is grey.  A slow, careful, almost
humorless man, whose mind has
gone to seed in apologies & in 
rendering balanced judgments
that don't match his feelings
