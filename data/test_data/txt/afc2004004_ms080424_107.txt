AL:  Back when you were young alot of folks up this way, not just
you, played 'em. . . .they were common. . .What did they call 'em?
Bob:  Well, we called 'em "song bows" back then, but a lot of people
call 'em mouth bows.
AL:  Why did they call them a "songBow"?
Bob:  Well, I reckon that's the name they just give it up here in
the mountains.  Well, there used to be some fellows down here,
the (unint).  They'd make 'em way out that there long, you know,
it sounded big and loud.  But I don't make 'em that long.
AL:  Play us another tune on one.
Bob:  Well, I'll tell you, play this song, "Fly around the little
blue-eyed girl."  (Plays)(Sings):  "Oh, fly around blue-eyed girl,
oh fly around my daisy, fly around little blue-eyed girl, almost
run me crazy!" (Plays)
L:  I like to (unint) because there are 4 of them (unint) and 
I like to sing.  I thought I liked to sing, but I didn't, but I
just learned how to learn to sing.
