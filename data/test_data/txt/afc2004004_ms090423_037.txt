67. 

Forgive me Lord 
Silent Night 
Father I stretch my hand to Thee 
I'm living for Jesus 
Nearer my God to Thee
Somebody touched me 
Near the Cross 
In the Cross of Christ I glory 
Glory, Glory, Hallelujah 
There's rest for the weary

Spirituals 

O the time is so hard 
Little David play on your Harp 
Steal Away
I've heard of a Land called Heaven 
Wade in the water Children 
Go down Moses 
Swing Low Sweet Chariot 
Bye and Bye 
I'll fly away 
Going to put on my Travelling Shoes
Lord stand by me 
Amen 
Before this time another year 
Give me that old time religion 
I couldn't hear nobody pray 
Everytime I feel the Spirit 
Nobody knows the trouble I see 
Keep your hand on the Plow, hold on 

Blues 

Bumble Bee Blues 
Confessing the Blues 
St. Louis Blues 
Warming the floor over you 
In the Dark 
Going to Chicago Chauffeur Blues 
Highway Blues 
Sweet Home Chicago 
How long Blues 
Lonesome Blues 
Weary Blues
