My dear Mr. Lomax:

I am not returning to Michigan until
September 22; so I shall be unable to help
your father if he stops. And I wish I were
there to aid either of you, for I think I know
where the singers are and where the false leads.
I spent two weeks in the Upper Peninsula and
in Wisconsin in August following the blueberry
pickers and searching for fugitive lumberjack songs.

Tomorrow I leave for the Sioux reservation
in South Dakota, where I am picking up some 
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse lore.

Respectfully,
*signed* E.C. Becky

I see no reason for restricting
the use of the lumberjack records.
