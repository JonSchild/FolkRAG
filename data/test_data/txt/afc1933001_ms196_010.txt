November 5, 1948

Dear Alan:

What with the increased cost of production
and the relative lag in the purchase of records, of
which you are probably also aware in the commercial
field in New York, we have found it impossible to give
to the collectors more than the material actually
represented in the new release. Nor, have we been able
to give discounts even to universities or other
institutions.  The best that we can do is to honor an
order from New York University which would make the
albums tax exempt.  I am sorry that I did not send a
letter explaining this at the time the records were
sent you.

Thank you for forwarding the material from Mr.
Holmes of Draper, Virginia.  We have not heard from him
but if we have any collectors in his region or if he
should be in Washington, we shall certainly latch on
to him.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Duncan Emrich
Chief, Folklore Section
