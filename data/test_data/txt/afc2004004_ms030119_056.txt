(I didn't know that was in the Bible, Rev. Davis.)
Yes it is. You read the twenty-first chapter of Lee-viticus. You'll find it.
(Lee-vitius has a lot of things to say about men and women, doesn't it?)
Yes it does.
(What else does it say?)
If a man messes with his mother-in-law he shall be put to death. . .if a man uncover his uncle's nakedness he should be put to death. . .If a man messes wid his own daughter, he should die childish. He'll come to be jes like a chile befo he die. He loses his grown person's sense. Go back into a child. (he blows his nose and snuffles.)
(How would that happen to him?)
Yeah. Man supposed to die wid all his good knowledge. It would be something that God-A-Mighty put upon him cause God had declared that it's a sin. (indignantly) Man shouldn't have his daughter. Mother shouldn't have her son. Thass the reason I tole you, these things I tole you bout, you understan, comin up a boy into a man, you not sposed to set down an tell your boy that. Even if that is yo chile.
(That would cause improper feelings in him?)
Thass what I'm tryin to tell you.
(Well, Rev. Davis, do you think that in a state of nature, if there were such a thing -- of course we're social beings and we live according to our teaching -- but if we never had been taught anything at all, do you think that sons would want their mothers?)
Lemme ast you a question: I don't mean no harm if it comes flat. Does a she-dog wants huh puppy? She do have him, don't she?
