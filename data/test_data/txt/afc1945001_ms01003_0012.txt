Vallejo, California

Dear Mr. Stevens:

May I thank you for your very excellent 
memorandum of February 28th, which was turned over 
to me by Mr. Christian Herter, since the problem 
of counteracting rumors properly falls within the 
sphere of this Bureau.

I was especially impressed with the 
specificity of your recommendations. We have been 
working for some time on the development of a system 
to catch and kill rumors. One of the devices we 
have been considering is very much like the one you 
recommend and if it goes into operation, you may be 
sure that you will be called on to help us.

Sincerely yours,
