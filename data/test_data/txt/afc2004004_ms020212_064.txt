Re: Mr. John Davis -2-

Initial Impression: 1) Acute respiratory disease with rhinosinusitis and
post nasal drip.
2) Disease of the heart. Possible old rheumatic disease
vs. luetic disease, with aortic insufficiency and
cardiomegaly.

Comment: While the acute respiratory infection seemed most prominent it was
difficult to determine on the initial examination whether the abnormal cardiac
findings were pre-existing and stable or whether this represented an active
component of the patient's current disability. The following program was
therefore advised.
1) Rest at home.
2) Tetracycline 250 mg. qid.
3) Phenergan expectorant with Codeine 5 cc qid.
4) Return in 3 days for evaluation and a chest x-ray.

The patient was again seen on June 10, 1963 at which time he was afebrile. He
seemed much improved and volunteered that he felt much better. He was stronger
and the cough was considerably reduced. The headache, while still present, was
also diminished. His blood pressure was 180/86.

HEENT: Gross reduction in the amount of erythema and of drainage which was
previously present.
Chest: Clear to PP&A.

Heart: Unchanged from previous examination.

EKG: Unchanged from previous tracing.

Impression: 1) Resolving respiratory infection.
2) Probable stable pre-existing heart disease with little if any
contribution to the current disability.

Chest x-ray showed marked cardiomegaly with a bootshaped heart. The aortic knob
was prominent and there was some question of calcification in the rim of the
aortic arch.

On June 14, 1963 the patient was again evaluated. For the past three nights he
had been working as part of the Georgia Sea Island singing group and was able
to do this without any symptoms. He looked fine and felt fine and volunteered
that he now "feels as a man should feel". The headache and cough were virtually
gone. The physical examination was entirely unremarkable. No further restriction
or medication was advised.
