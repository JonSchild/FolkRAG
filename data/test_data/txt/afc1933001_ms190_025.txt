February 11, 1943

Dear Alan:     I have your letter of February 8 with the information
                        about Messrs. Pipes, James, and Guthrie.
The enclosures belonging to Mr. Moe I have returned, but not
before reading the exciting material submitted to Oklahoma by
Mr. Pipes, particularly the practically perfect "How to Read
the Bible".

     All of these men sound extremely interesting, and
I am hopeful that the Fellowship Committee will react enthusiastically.
However, there is more clerical work to be done,
and for that reason I am enclosing three sets of application
blanks. I should be glad to send these to the men did I know
their addresses. Since these three will be judged as fellowship
cases, along with the others applying this year, it will
be necessary for me to have the same sort of papers and credentials
from them that I receive from all others. Therefore,
will you please send each one a set of blanks, with the admonition
that right now haste is of the essence?

     We have had to set up a rather elaborate machinery
for the mechanical details connected with handling the requests
which we receive, and it throws the machine out of gear if I 
cannot feed the hopper more or less on schedule. Pardon the
mechanistic similes of the foregoing sentences, but I can think
of no other way to describe our process, or to emphasize the 
need for haste. In addition, I have recently received my first
draft notice, and am anxious about having all of the applications
in order before marching away to defend you know what.

     I hope something will take me to Washington before
leaving for the army so we can have another talk.
