man named Steve Miner, he was out there and he had an old Model T truck
so he brought the ________ back and the milk cans back.
     I come on back and then my daddy stops me.  He's gonna farm and he's
starting to get ready to plant cotton.  He said, "Son."  I said, "Sir."
He said, "You reckon you can you can run that cutter rig?"  I said, "Yes."
He said, "All right."  He had an old grey mule named Paul.  "I'm gonna
give you Paul cause she ain't too fast."  He had five two-cutter baldes
and an old two-well stall-cutter that carried one roller and had blades on
it (?).  He went out there and he was taking one of the blades off the
stall cutter and had the old cutter made up and stetched as wide as he could
get it, so he could take back to cutting it up.  That blade
for the smooth     (?)
     I got old Paul and I got behind it and I was so light and little
it was just shaking me.  So I got from behind it and got out in the 
middle.  I worked for a whole one hour.  At 12 o'clock I was tired but I
wanted to be a man.  I didn't say nothing, I went on.  I was tired at 12
o'clock but I just wouldn't say nothing.  I wanted to be a man.
    So that night when we knocked off, I had been a big man and was gonna
take the mules to the lot.  That night when we knocked off I made it to
the top step and that's as far as I could make it.  My sister, she came
out there abd she said, "Brother what's a matter?"
     I said, "I'm tired."  There wasn't but two of us.
     She said.  "You is tired?  Why don't you go in?"
     I said, "I'll be in directly."  She went and got the wash bowl, 
and she brought it out there with the soapy water and she wiped my face.
Then she brought a little supper and I ate there on the steps.  And then
I just fell back on the porch.  I was sitting there on the top step
and I just fell back on the porch.  I lay back there and I went to sleep.
