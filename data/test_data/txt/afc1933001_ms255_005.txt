Oh set down chile, set down, (3)

Set down, Chile, set down 
Dat angel in Heaven goine to wait on

Dat gospel is comin (3)
An’ I don’ want to leavin behind
Goine cross dat ribber of Jardon

yo soul
Dat star done rizin in de Eas'
  "    holy star from Heaven
Don't min' sinner you be lef behind
Thanks God, there's nother one a comin'
Straw back angels, straw back (3)
Don't want to [be] left behin'
Way back side in Heaven -
