The racial population fluctuations in the county are significant.  They reflect the long history of competition of black and white farm workers in the South.  During slavery the blacks had the advantage and the protection of an institution.  From 1800 to 1880 the Negro population increased 277 per cent, and the white population decreased 27 per cent.  From 1880 to 1920 the Negro population lost by 6.4 per cent and the white population gained 39.4 per cent.  Since 1910 the migration from Greene County has been considerable, and most of it has been from the old plantation areas.  Approximately half the Negro migrants left the county in 1923, 1924, and 1925.  The peak of white emigration came two years later.  The reason for this was that the insecure small landlords were no longer able to furnish their tenants either with advances or rations or tools or livestock.

The tragedy and the irony of the present situation are dramatized in the abandoned and dismantled great houses of former days, which now house impoverished families of tenants.  The collapse of the plantation in this area has given rise to small white owners who lack both the benevolence and the aristocratic prestige of the former plantation owners.  They form a class somewhere between the tenant and the planter.  The change of fortune has, however, made possible the growth of a group of small Negro landowners.  The Negro landowning class reached a peak in 1921.  In that year Negroes owned 18,977 acres.  By 1927 their acreage had dropped to 11,315.  The loss was sus-
