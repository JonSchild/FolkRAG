I recommend that Mr. Alan Lomax be sent to the RCA Manufacturing
Co., Camden, New Jersey for a period of two or three days to inspect
the files of those Victor records in stock which may prove valuable
to the Archive of the American Folk-Song.  For this Mr. Lomax should receive 
travel and per diem allowance, to be charged to Increase.
