AL:                                    you can just call up on the telephone
and get you out?
BJ:     They still can do that at home, ya know. . .Oh, yeah.  They
still doin' it home.   Jus' like, jus'. . .If I was to git in jail
direct now, if I [probably] would, had to, jus', you know, up, up
up there, to home.  But I hope I never will, but I worked for
some of 'em.   I'd call 'em an' tell 'em [to tell 'em] to turn me
out.  An' they'd turn me out.  'Cordin' to who they were.  'Cause,
see, I, I, I ain't, I ain't got no record there.  See?  See
what I mean?  If you got a bad record at a, at a place, why, you,
you know, you expect to have trials an' diffrunt things.  You,
you got to be in there, "Cause they even put people outside, but they
still goin' to jail all the time.
AL:     They wouldn't put you out if some colored person called up
to help you out?
BJ:      Ah, colored person, if he got the money and is responsible.
My pastor can git me out anytime.   An' ah, an' ah, an' my son,
with the job he got.   Ya see?   He, he can git me out.   At any time,
you know?   By, by, by not even comin' down there.  Because he know
he got the, that, that the money's comin'.  Ah, "hit's gonna be
sech-an-such a thing; sech-an-sech thing will be the fine," see?
An' that's all.  Tell 'em, "I'll be down there to pay it up."
An' that's all to that, see.  You, you, you, you're responsible.
