of stuff do you wish me to record?

I wish to make some sort
of favorable reaction to the confidence
of you and Jerry in
sending me material. If, however,
at any time you think it best
for your interest to close 
out all dealings with me
I shall promptly send back
to you all material that I
have on hand.

Here in Dallas a group of
white collar people meet once
a month and dance the square
dance and polka after the fashion
of 50 years ago. They have some
old time fiddlers and an ex-cowboy
caller. Friday night, as I wrote
to you, I am planning to make
some records on the dancefloor,
as I mentioned in my other
letter. Further activities await
explicit approval by you.
As ever,
Father.
