Dear Mr. Lomax:
   Well at last the exams are over and I can
settle down and breathe a little and write to all
my friends.  I came off with three A's and one B,
which I think is as good as could be expected by a 
fellow like me who has no genuine appreciation 
for the glorious details and beauties of a complete
and scholarly bibliography - or rather Bibliography.
   You asked about this fiddler I found - also another 
one, and I was not sure just what they had and 
did not want to get you down here on a wild goose
chase.  One of them I know is worth a dozen 
trips down here.  The other one I don't know about.
This one who is worth recording knows scores
of breakdowns I've never heard or seen in print, and 
he plays them in real old-time style.  I think I
can safely say he is the best old time fiddler
I ever heard, and it's no trouble to get him to 
play either.  He plays on fiddles which he made
himself - good ones, too -- he makes his living 
that way, and he knows fiddles.  Come down 
any time and we'll go see him.
Your friend always
Frank Goodwyn
