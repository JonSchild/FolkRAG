19 B STEINBERG p.3

Q: You found a great amount of indecision...bewilderment in the crisis when
     Hitler came in and the people couldn't move rapidly enough to prevent him...
     is that going to happen to us?
A: I had the impression that the U. S. is working fairly quickly and that the 
     arguments are more on the surface. I am not a politician nor
     a military man but so far I think highly effective help has been given to
     England.
Q: The people who know think we are not making the number of guns and planes...
     and with the strikes.. for instance on the West Coast.. the airplane
     plant... isn't that ture what happened in France... they were too busy
     arguing, etc...   
A: Evidently the labor here didn't realize that was only one possibility...
Q: I spoke to a man who worked in your plant and in the Maintenance Dept.
     he has some very strong opinions about unions. Can you tell us
     something about that?
A: I haven't any opinion about unions because I have had no experience with them.
Q: Did they have them in Germany and England?
A: The union man was bewildered. People didn't and couldn't believe this was
     a permanent situation.
Q: Have you had any contact with people since Hitler came into power who would
     state the truth?
A: Yes.
Q: Are the people as a whole in favor of Hitler?
A: The feeling in Germany is that the younger people built up in the Nazi 
     way are for Hitler but the older generation I doubt.
