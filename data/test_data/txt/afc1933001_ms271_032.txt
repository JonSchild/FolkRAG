Better World A Coming
By Woody Guthrie
There's a better world a coming
Wait and see, see, see,
Wait and see,
Out of marching and our battling
You can hear the chains a rattling,
There's a better world a coming
Wait and see.

There's a better world a coming,
Don't you know, know, know,
There's a better world a coming
Don't you know.
Out of storm and wind and rain
Out of sorrow, out of pain,
There's a better world a coming,
Don't you know.

There's a better world a coming
By and by, by, by,
There's a better world a coming
By and by,
When the buzzards of hell
Are driven from the sky,
There's a better world a coming
By and by.

There's a better world a coming
Tell you why, why, why,
There's a better world a coming
Tell you why,
We will bent them on the land
On the sea and in the sky,
There's a better world a coming
Tell you why.

There's a better world a coming
Won't be long, long, long,
There's a better world a coming
Won't be long,
We will run the Axis down
And we'll bring them to the ground,
There's a better world a coming
Won't be long.

[There's abetter world a coming
Wait and see]
