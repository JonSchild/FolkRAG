Dear Alan:
Well, here's a first approximation. This should give you an idea for a 
point of departure. If it looks to you like we could make a bibliographic 
contribution, I'd urge you to call Alan on 202-707-6590 and offer your 
thoughts. As I mentioned, he and I have talked and this does seem like a 
logical channel through which we could make a material contribution to the 
Jukebox.
One note: the 10-year run of SELECTED LIST that I've enclosed is hard to 
come by. The other Bibliographies are available in multiple copy.
Sincerely,
Gerry
