LISTEN TO OUR STORY.  By Alan Lomax.  (MS-12pp from last chapter only.)
This is a small sample of the material Mr. Lomax wants to
include in his new book - a part of the autobiography of Jelly 
Roll Morton, the jazz composer.  It is told in his own words, and 
tells about his adventures in Memphis and thereabouts when he was 
playing and singing and throwing the dice in saloons and sporting 
houses, back in 1908.  It is flavorous enough - sometimes rather 
too much so for my taste - but I must admit that I'm not wholly 
sold on the idea of this book, if it is to be like this. 
In the first place, there is a certain monotony about these 
true life stories, told in the first person in dialect.  For a page 
or two the picturesque expressions and vigor are interesting, but 
thereafter I think most people would be apt to find such characters 
as Jelly Roll a bit hard to stomach.
Mr. Lomax's transcription is no doubt accurate, he already 
has something of a reputation in this field, and probably his 
book would have a moderate sale.  It would fall somewhere between 
the folklore and the musical fields, however, and I don't really 
feel we would be justified in offering him a contract on the 
basis of these 12 pages alone.  I think his book sounded better 
in outline, in short.  And certainly he should write some sort of 
introduction or connecting passages, to make the reader understand 
the significance of this material as Americana, and to avoid 
making the book seem too much like a collection of short stories.
