COPIED 

FROM REGIONAL ANALYST'S REPORT 
OF 12/11/42 

Only one other minority group situation which might cause 
troubles has come to my attention, and that is between 
Irish Catholics and Jews.  It is not out in the open, 
but this week two things came to my attention.  The attached 
statement claiming all the "firsts" involving 
bravery and other virtues for the Irish, and implying 
that Jews are chislers has been widely circulated here.  
It has appeared on printed cards, in typed copy, mimeographed, 
and in hand writing.  Nobody seems to know its 
source.  The other thing was a letter addressed to a 
prominent Jewish judge here, and opened by the war agency 
to which it was erroneously addressed.  It was unsigned, 
but the writer identified himself as Irish Catholic.  It 
was so insulting and threatening that it was referred to 
the FBI.  I have no idea how much was back of these 
things, but there used to be a considerable following 
here of Father Coughlin and such literature as "Social 
Justice" was distributed when it was still in circulation.
