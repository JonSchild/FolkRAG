J. FRANK DOBIE, being first duly sworn, deposes and 
says:

 I am the editor of Southwestern Lore, Publications No. IX
of the Texas Folk-Lore Society.
 
When I prepared Volume No. IX published in 1931,
I included at page 119 a few lines of the music and a few
lines of the lyrics of the musical composition entitled 
"Alla en el Rancho Grande"/  This was contributed by Joaquin
Mora, then attending the University of Texas from Mexico.
I had long known the song as a widely popular song
and it was my impression that it was a traditional piece of 
music.  At the time I included the song in Volume No. IX of 
the Texas Folk-Lore Society I did not have and I do not now
have the information to enable me to say when and where the 
song first made its appearance.  My sole reason for including 
it in the volume was that I considered it a folk song because 
it has been my impression that it was a traditional piece of 
music but I have no personal knowledge or proof that it is.
