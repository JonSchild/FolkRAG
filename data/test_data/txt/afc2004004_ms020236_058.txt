[*ESCAPE FROM WEST GREEN*]
figured Cecil or Laz'rus, one, would take me to a nearby place,
y'know to git -- to catch a train.   But not let that crew at
that there juke there know, 'cause they would tell 'im.   See?  Now,
[So,] I went on, and while I was talkin' to Catherine, she said,
"Don' worry," she said, "Daddy comin' at me today,"  she said,
"Because I'm [quick as] quittin' Sam."   An' then I was outdone about that;
they was mad at one another.   I didn't know it, y'know.   So, sure
'nuf, Mr. McCormick came, her daddy.  An' he talked 'em back to-
gether; he wa'n' gonna carry her nowhere.  You know,
                                      peoples, y'know.  He didn't come to get 'er;
he come to talk 'em back together.   That's what he did.   She stayed
there.  So she tol' him about me an' everything.   "Good God!"
That man knowed me since I was a lil' chile.   He said, "Well, we'll
get her away from here.   Her Mama would have a fit if she know that
this was goin' on."
             So he sent this boy down, Henry McCormick, an' tol' me
what to do, you see.   An' then Henry got my clothes, you know,
some of 'em, an' put 'em in a sack, [crocus (?)] croker sack.  You know,
like a croker sack of nothin'.   An' carried it to Miss Alice --
I mean to Catherine.   An' he loaded 'em up there, see?   I was goin'
on like I was jus' walkin' -- I always jus' walk through the
woods walkin'.   I went on down to the road, almost to the colored
section -- they call it the Colored Quarters.   The quarter there
ain' nothin' but jus' colored people, but jus', you know, jus'
called Colored Quarter.   An' I went on down through that way,
like I was goin' there.   Mr. McCormick picked me up.  An' that
man put on some ridin'.   He carried me back jus' as far as I
went back, to Fitzgerald.   So I went a different route.   'Cause
everybody there knew I was supposed to go to Millon -- go home --
I mean go where Mama was, see?   I went back to Fitzgerald.   An'
I [hain't] ain' been there no more.   Hup, ha, ha, ha!   That sight!   An'
you see, I had to leave Miss Alice.   That was a time, I tell ya.
I hate to leave that woman.   Oh, goodness.   She was so good to
me, but she was done [walk] up -- I was glad she was up walkin'.  See?
An' I didn't write her or [anybody] nothin', after I got off.   I wrote
Catherine but I wrote her under a different name, y'know.   An'
Catherine tol' me 'bout how Miss Alice was gettin' along.   Well,
she was  gettin' along all right.   [You know] Still.   She got along fine.
