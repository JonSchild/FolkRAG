Mr. Lowell Mellett     -2-     February 14, 1940

     4. I would suggest specifically that Mr. MacLeish meet
informally some evening with you, Mr. Botkin, Mr. Spivacke, (Mr. 
Harris, if he is in town) and Lorentz. If you prefer not to include
Mr. Lorentz at this time, I would be glad to sit in for 
whatever contributions or suggestions I could make. This meeting
could do two things:
               a) Give direction to the general thinking
               b) Discuss definite ways of procedure including
                    financing and production.
