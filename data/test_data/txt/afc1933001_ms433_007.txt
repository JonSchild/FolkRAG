The March of the Workers

William Morris

Tune: John Brown's Body

What is this the sound and rumor?
What is this all men hear?
Like the windsi in hollow valleys when the storm is drawing near,
Like the rolling on of ocean in the even tide of fear?
'Tis the people marching on.
Whither go they, and whence come they?
What are these of whom ye tell?
In what country are they dwelling 'twixt the gtte of heav'n and Hell?
Are they mine or things for money?
Will they serve a master well?
Still the rumor's marching on.

Chorus:
Hark the rolling of the thunder
Lo the sun! and lo thereunder
Riseth love and hope and wonder,
And the hosts come arching on.

Forth they come from grief nd torment;
on they wend toward health and mirth;
All the wide world is the irdwelling,
every corner of the earth
Buy them, sell them for they service
Try the Bargain what 'tis worth.
For the days are marching on.
These are they who build thy houses
weave they rainment, win thy wheat,
Smooth the rugged, fill the barren,
turn the bitter into sweet,
All for thee this day - and ever.
What reward for them is meet?
Till the hose comes marching on.
