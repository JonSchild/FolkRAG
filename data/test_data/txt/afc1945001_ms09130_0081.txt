11A - Boy White

1. There is a rumor around that they will 
start slicing bread again.

2. An U.S. plane shot down 24 Jap 
Zeros. The plane's rudder was shot 
off, the motor was shot up, yet 
he glided to his base 100 miles away.

3. It is said that in another year 
bare feet will be the latest 
thing out. (Because of shoe rationing.)

4. A lady went to market and got 
as much meat as she wanted 
in fact she got so much meat 
she could not carry it. So she 
asked the butcher to deliver the 
meat. The butcher said he could 
not deliver the meat because she had 
just bought his horse.
