finally drove me to sit & work with
him. We battled for two or three
days - I gave him breaks for
drinks & fell alongside lazily
myself - until they were done
& I could send him along.
Meantime I had ripped up
the town getting ready - recorded
my three 3rd  Pgm shows, dubbed
the Dublin pgm which G & Lawr
said they liked, arranged new
work visa, god I can't remember
but I"m still so tired I ache
all over from that time --
dictated & completed all my
world library business.
One day I remember - down
town in Picadilly feeling hysterically
alone - oppressed by time - crushed
by a $1400 income tax bill
just arrived from the states -
