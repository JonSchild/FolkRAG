A note about lectures:
Dr. Payne write that he was arranging a 
book in Dallas through the professor of folk
lore at S.M. U., Brooks, [I] but gave me 
the opportunity to take over if I cared.
I wrote Brooks. I wrote Beatty with 
whom I was arranging a lecture. Brooks 
replies that he had never heard of the 
fact Dr. Payne mentions. Beatty replies,
"That makes it easy on us. We 
will have someone in Sandburg's place
since S. is coming anyway. We 
are booking Stork Young."
What kind of a nut is this Payne 
any way. Damn him to be scorched.
The [two] three dates I have hopes of , good 
hopes - Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin,
Tulsa University.
