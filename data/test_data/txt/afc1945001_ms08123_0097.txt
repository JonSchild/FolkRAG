Rumor

Just lately I have been
hearing that clothes are
going to be ration. Not
only have some on my
best friend but even those
whom I do not know while
shopping will say "Do you
know that clothes are being
ration soon, so stock up on
your share now. Those are
the people whom we can 
do without. 

Joke or Anecdote
A soldier was taken before 
a judge. The judge said
"order please". The room
was quite noisey & did not
take heed to this. So the
judge said the next one
who speaks will leave
this room. The soldier on 
trial hollowed Hot diggety
dog may I go now.
