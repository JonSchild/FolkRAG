Dear Sir:
I had the express man to pick up the package you left here with me and I am sending you the receipt that he gave me for the package. The express man said you had c.o.d. on the package and he said that you meant for them to collect $500 before they deliver the package.
But he told me to write you and tell you if that is not what you meant for them to do, that you can wire the express agent in Washington, D. C. and the express agent there will release the package without collecting the $500.
Yours truly,
Café Texan

Dear Spivacke:
This ought to get you the records. If it won't, let me know at Parchman, Miss. The Express man misunderstood my caption.
Yours,  John A. Lomax
