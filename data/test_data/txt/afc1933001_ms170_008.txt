Mr. Alan Lomax
restrict his recording activities to areas which I shall define.  I have 
called a conference with Seeger, Hanke and Thomson to discuss this and
shall defend your interests to the best of my ability.
I like most of your other suggestions – Randolph, Linscott, etc.
We have ordered a truck which should be ready for you when you return.
It is a new type which combines the advantages of a station wagon (8 seats)
with a steel bodied truck.  This can be used on the joint project with the
Radio Project if it comes to pass.
Please let me know how you feel about the South American plans so
that I can begin preparations.
Regards to Elizabeth and yourself – I hope you have recovered from
your attack of the bellyache.
Sincerely,
Harold
HS
