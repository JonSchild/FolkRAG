FOR RELEASE TO AFTERNOON NEWSPAPERS
Wednesday, February 5, 1941

     "More than 5,000 cases of syphilis have already been found among
Selective Service candidates," Assistant Surgeon General R. A. Vonderlehr 
of the U. S. Public Health Service said at a regional Conference on Social
Hygiene and National Defense in St. Louis today. He presented the findings
of a preliminary tabulation of 120,000 blood tests and physical examinations
for syphilis performed on Selective Service candidates in 23 States during
November and December, 1940.
     Rates among the States range from 7 to 114 per 1000 men examined, Dr.
Vonderlehr reported. he divided the 23 States into four groups according to 
the extent of the syphilis problem they presented. (See table attached.)
     "It will be noticed," the Assistant Surgeon General pointed out, "that 
the two groups with the highest average rates are composed of Southern States. 
Comparison shows that they also were among those States which had the highest
syphilis rates for men drafted in the last World War."
     Direct comparison of rates for syphilis then and now cannot be made because
routine serologic tests were not performed on drafted men in the 1917-19 period,
but, Dr. Vonderlehr emphasized, "we can see nevertheless that after 20 years
the geographical distribution of the problem is practically the same."
     The Public Health Service reported that several States, notably North
Carolina and Alabama, provided blood tests on a voluntary basis to men who
registered under the Selective Service and Training Act. The preliminary rate
reported for North Carolina, for example, was 78 per 1000 men examined. Some
200,000 tests from Alabama are in the process of being tabulated.
