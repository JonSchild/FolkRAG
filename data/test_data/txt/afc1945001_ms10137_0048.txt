Sophomore White Female
1. A fellow at one of the army camps got a nasty 
bump on his head. He was putting some toilet 
water on his hair and when he looked up, he hit 
his head on the toilet seatâ€”Nasty bump!!
2. Two girlfriends were talking over the dates 
they had the previous night. The one girl 
had gone out with a sailor. He had said 
"May I convoy you home?" She said 
"No Sir! Last time I was convoyed 
home by a sailor I was torpedoed 
twice and now I'm carrying bundles
for Britian."
