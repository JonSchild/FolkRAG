Report on Rumors - 8

Pertaining to the Military
1.  There is a lot of talk in Nogales, Arizona, about there being so many 
deferments among the white selectees, while there have been none among 
the Mexican selectees, who make up 90% of the total.  (Mexican Consul 
Phoenix, 8-8-42)  (There was an article in a recent paper concerning this 
situation - get clipping)
2.  During the two-day convention of the American Legion, I have heard 
fifteen or twenty people speak with disfavor concerning action of the 
draft boards.  They mentioned especially the extremely small percentage 
of deferments among the Mexican selectees and expressed discontent with 
deferment of so many able-bodied men for defense work.  (State official, 
member of American Legion.  Phoenix 8-9-42)
3.  The operator of a beer parlor at Parker, Arizona, told me that two of 
the privates who are down in that country on the one quart a day water 
allowance in connection with desert maneuvers requested additional water 
from two officers.  This was refused and the privates drew their guns 
and shot the officers.  (This was told by a fruit shipper who has recently 
been in the Parker area, who state that he believed this story.  Phoenix, 
8-15-42)
