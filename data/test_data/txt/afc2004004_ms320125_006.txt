AL         Bill said that tune you know called
Indian on the Stump, that's a real Indian one, isn't it?

:             All right. Do you need the [UNCLEAR]?

AL          No, let's just have that alone.

:             All right, okay.

AL          Tell us where you learned it. Where did
you learn that song?

:              Where did you learn, when did you learn
to play this song?

:              I learned it,  this Indian Stomp I 
learned from old Indian name of Jackson Langley.    [UNCLEAR]
He used to play that. That's where I learned that.

AL           Now, as far as you know, is that an
Indian song or is, is that a song that he picked up from...

: (Dewey Balfa)  He picked up just the English I believe.

AL           Oh, okay.

:               That's right.

:                How about [UNCLEAR]
[MUSIC,  SINGING]

AL             You have some trouble keeping up with 
him, [Dewey], why?

: (DB)        It's because of, because of the
measurements. He, he, sometimes he adds a measurement or he
will cut a measurement. And I have trouble to follow that.
