      Devil's Dream - one passage where player sings
in breathy choked tones Ha - ah.
     The strangest & most primitive Afro-Am. sound I've
ever heard.
Then a passage of syllables murmured in the beeps of the
nose - Eph-o, Eph-y-Eph-y-...(3 tone melody
     C#, B, C# F.
Jessie James - a fair approx of the tune with
drums, military style, evident, straight, but
very fine military style.  Melody on [flute] fife
[Sidewalks  of New York] After the Ball - [flute] fife with drums. the tune,
all right, plaintive.
Sidewalks of New York - same style with choruses
sung.
Death March - some really good fife playing
