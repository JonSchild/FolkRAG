Dear Arthur Bell:

Thank you very much for sending us permission
to use your song. We are very sorry, however, 
that the government payment procedures will make
it impossible for us to send you your money before
you leave the State Farm. If you will send 
us your new address, though, we will send it to
you just as soon as possible.

With best wishes.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
