assigned to merchant ships as Army gunners, 
to replace Navy gunners. They can be iden-
tified by an emblem on their right arm, an 
anchor and a double 'A.' They are in and 
out of town constantly.

" 'The cadets, training for the RAF in the 
South under the Empire's air training scheme, 
are all being moved back to Great Britain.

" 'The British sailors quartered here at any 
one time are never more than a few thousand 
at most. They are: 1. Waiting for repairs 
on their warships; 2. recently arrived on 
troopships to take back new vessels; and, 
3. shore-based naval attached."

On the negative side it should be noticed that the 
column uses the label "Answer" for the rumor counteraction, 
rather than "Fact" or "Truth" or some other way of pairing the 
[necessary belief] accurate information with the phony. Moreover, with rumors of this 
length the term "phony" should be inserted in the middle and 
added at the end.

The same source in a later issue tried answering the 
very tricky rumor concerning Jews evading the draft. Normally, 
as suggested elsewhere, we might expect this rumor to be approached 
by pairing it with a series of other rumors about other 
groups evading the draft. This column, however, by emphasizing 
the local character of the specific rumors, was able to make an 
interesting approach. There are a number of defects in its 
specific handling but some sound principles emerge.

"RUMOR--A certain local draft board composed 
entirely of Jewish members had been outrageously 
lenient in deferring Jewish registrants. 
A vast majority of its inductees were Christians. 
The situation became so scandalous 
that a Catholic priest went to protest. He 
was insulted by a board member and finally 
beaten up. The FBI had to move in and close 
up the board.
