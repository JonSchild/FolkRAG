When supper was over, Mrs McDonald & I [?],
when the prince smoked a pipe - a habit acquired
in his wanderings and also to alleviate
toothache, with which he was often troubled, brought
on, no doubt, by the damp of a climate to which he
was not accustomed.
176. ....However, we took ourselves off to bed - for
dear Maggie, I was justly tired out - leaving Kingsburgh
very busy with boiling water, lemons, & sugar
preparing a bowl of capital whisky-[?]. Shall I
confess the sin of taking a wee glass on leaving the
table? You know full well that we Highland ladies
do thus indulge sometimes.
177. After we left, one bowl of punch was succeeded by
another, the prince seeming to forget his fatigue,
& that he was to enjoy the comfort of what he had
not felt for so long - a warm bed. He was so pleased
with Kingsburgh's hospitality & friendly conversation, that a 
good humoured contest at last occurred as to whether or 
not a third bowl should be prepared, the Prince saying
yes, his host no, until by pulling the china too
violently, it broke in tow, which, of necessity,
settled the point.
