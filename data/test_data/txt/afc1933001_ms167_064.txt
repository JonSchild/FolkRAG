Dear Miss Kenard:

There is a very fine example of Cajun singing on
a commercial record, listed as B12C42-B: Ta Oblis
Do Vernier, performed by Happy Fats and Rayne-Bo
Rambler, singing with string band.

There is also a Victor album of Creole music which
has just appeared. I have not yet had time to
play it through and so can't guarantee its authenticity, 
but you might try that. There should be
something in it suitable for a Mardi Gras scene.

Yours very truly,
