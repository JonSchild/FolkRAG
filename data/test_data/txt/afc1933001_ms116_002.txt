Mr. Lincoln Thompson
Sound Specialties Company
Waterbury, Connecticut

Dear Mr. Thompson:

We have an inquiry from one
of the other Government departments
concerning the price of a
re-recording machine similar to
the one you supplied for use at
Yale University.

I shall appreciate any information
you can give me about
such a machine at your earliest
convenience.

                Faithfully yours,

OS  a      Chief, Division of Music
