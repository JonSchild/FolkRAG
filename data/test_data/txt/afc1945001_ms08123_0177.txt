There were two solders in a shell hole fighting hand to hand. One was an American, and the other was a Jap. When the Jap got the American down, he pulled a knife in order to kill him, but the soldier was too fast for the Jap and knocked the knife out of his hand. Without the knife the Jap hollowed, "Have mercy, please”. So the soldier let him up, and asked, “Where do you come from?” The Jap cried “Yakolioma”, Then the American said, Well I am from Oklahoma. The Jap cried, We both is from “A Roma” so let us not fight
