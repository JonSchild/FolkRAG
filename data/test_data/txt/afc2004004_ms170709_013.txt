play I'd go. It was such a nice place. I mean I enjoyed that better 
t han I did anything there. I mean I didn't know nothin about Dallas. 
There wadn't nothin there I could do. I didn't know nobody much. Only 
jes Huddie's sister -- the peoples that she know. I was so close home 
I'd ruther been home than a been there. His sister wanted us to stay 
with her a while. Huddie waspplayin an workin round there. He played 
quite a bit there. He had a quite a few peoples there. His daughter 
was there. It was a man that handled him there. He played at white 
places an all. He played at two night clubs in North Dallas there. 
But it wasn't too much work there at the time. Mr. Townsend brought 
us back to New York with him. He was workin on the Tribune here. 
When we got with them we came back here then. We didn't go back South 
any mo till we went back with Miss Barnicle. When we had the wreck. 

Mr. Lomax came to his sister's there in Dallas. John was workin 
there in the bank then. He came there an we saw him. He called us an 
asked us to come down an see him. We went to his sister's house one 
night there. We read some parts of the book. We jes didn't like it, 
you know. What was wrote an how it was wrote. Huddie tole him he jes 
didn't want that book out. He didn't git enough money out of it or 
sumpin. He tole em he was goin stop it. So he did. An some way they 
settled it. I forgot how much he paid him out of the book. I don't 
think it was sold anymore after that. But anyhow we was there an very 
much in need of money. H ad done been there all this time an Huddie 
didn't git very much work so he gave us sumpin -- I don't know how 
much it was now. I done forgotten. But anyhow we lived off of that. 
Then we got with these peoples the Townsends an got back to New York. 
Then we stayed till he an I an Miss Barnicle drove back. I'd always 
go back every once in a while but he never did go back after that time 
we went with Miss Barnicle an had the wreck. See while we was there 
Mr. Lomax wrote this letter an said sumpin about Huddie threatenin
