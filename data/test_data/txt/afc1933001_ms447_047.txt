MUSIC--JOHN HENRY

JOHN HENRY

1 Well, every Monday mornin'                    28
When the bluebirds begin to sing,
You can hear those hammers a mile or mo',
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring, oh, Lawdy,
Hear John Henry's hammer ring.

2  John Henry told his old lady,
Will you fix my supper soon?
Got ninety miles o' track I've got to line,
Got to line it by the light of the moon, oh, Lawdy,
Line it by the light o' the moon.

3  John Henry had a little baby,                       28
He could hold him out in his hand;
But the last word I heard that po' child say,
"My dad is a steel-drivin' man, oh, Lawdy,
Daddy is a steel-drivin' man."

4  John Henry told his old capt'in,
Said, "A man ain't nothin' but a man,
Before I let yo' steel gang down
I will die with the hammer in my hand, oh, Lawdy,
Die with the hammer in my hand."
