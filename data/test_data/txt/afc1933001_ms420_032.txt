These Old Cumberland Mountain Farms
Skyline Farms, Alabama.


It is hard to be bound down in prison,
But it's worse on these [old] Cumberland mountain farms,
Ruther be in some old penitentiary,
Or up in old iron Tennessee.

How weary I've climbed them old mountains
Through the rain and the sleet and the snow,
[If] Tip yo' hat when you meet Mister Ridges,
Bow yo' head when you meet Captain Ross.

Young------, he run a commissary,
Mister, you bet was a thief,
He sold[?] apples at fifty a dozen
And potatoes was [at] fifty cents a piece.

When the Coffee County boys came to the mounting,
They expected to get a lot to eat,
But when they called them in to dinner,
They got slamon, corn dodgers and meat.

It is seventy miles miles to Chattanooga,
It'ss a hundred and twenty to Basell
It's a thousand miles from here to civilization,
But's it's only a few steps from here to Hell.

Young people, you've all heard my story
And I hope you don't think it all wrong,
If you doubt thw words I have told you
See Red Campbell , for he composed this song.
