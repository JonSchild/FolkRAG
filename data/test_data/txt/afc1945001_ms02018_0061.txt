Report on Rumors - 11 

Japanese
1.  I have heard that at the relocation center at Sacaton, Arizona, 
the Japs have electric dishwashers and white cooks, and I would like to 
find out about that.  (Older woman, prominent politically, financially 
well-established, innumerable contacts.  Phoenix, 8-8-42.)   [*(3)*]
2.  I don't know anything about how the Japs are being treated at 
the relocation centers, but I have heard that the Japanese statesmen in 
Washington have the most expensive hotel suites and everything that money 
can buy and I don't think that is right.  (Woman, state employe, moderate 
circumstances, quite numerous contacts through nature of work.  Phoenix, 
8-8-42.)    [*(3)*]
3.  At the American Legion Convention, August 7 and 8 in Phoenix, 
I heard twenty to twenty-five persons bitterly criticize the proposal 
to allow Japanese at the Sacaton Relocation Center to fish without a 
license.  (State official, member of American Legion, Phoenix, 8-9-42.)
4.  I just delivered a truck load of watermelons to the camp at 
Deming, New Mexico, for dangerous Japanese.  The Government is not going 
to let them spy around the country.  The camp is enclosed with a high 
wire fence that no Jap could ever break through.  There are a lot of watch 
towers and a man with a gun is in every one of them.  (Statement of 
unknown truck driver at restaurant near wholesale market.  Phoenix, 8-9-42.)
5.  There have been a number of stories going around about the Jap 
relocation centers,--including one that says there are air-cooling systems 
and aluminum refrigerators in every apartment.  That is just a little too 
far-fetched to believe.  (Mining engineer, wide contacts, comfortable 
income.  Phoenix, 8-10-42.)
6.  I heard that the Jap internees pulled nails inside the buildings
