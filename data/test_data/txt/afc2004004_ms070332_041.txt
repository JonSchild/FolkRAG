It should be noted ("Instructions to Field Workers")
that the basis of every folklore collection is the full,
unedited field notes on each interview. As far as possible,
the actual collection of material is to be made incidental
to but an integral part of the interview. In [many] some State
offices it [will] may be possible to assign stenographers [to] for special interview[ing]s.
Duplicates of the forms for recording data
are also to be supplied by each State office. Local
specialists should be consulted wherever possible, and
bibliographical helps and samples of material will be sent
on request. It is believed that workers themselves are apt
to be less confused and hampered if they are kept away from
books and references.

Directors and supervisors are requested not to assign
field workers until their qualifications for handling the work of
interviewing efficiently and tactfully have first been thoroughly
checked and tested. It is suggested that field workers be tried
out on small assignments, and in case of doubt, samples of their
work be submitted to the Folklore Editor. These suggestions are
made and should be carefully observed for two reasons: (1) A
good informant can be spoiled by bad handling; and (2) a tactless
worker can involve the project in needless friction and difficulty,
especially in the immediate locality.
