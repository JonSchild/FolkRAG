12B
The most generally known song wherever I have been is the
following patriotic meringue. President Vincent and his
group of backers spray the public of Port-au-Prince with
pro-Vincent propagande until one would think he made the
very corn grow up out of the ground. From what I hear he
seems to be a decent, honest, rather idealistic fellow with
a very difficult job and a very precarious
political situation on his hands; but I should think he
would blush every time he reads the almost daily eulogies
that appear about him in the newspaper, discovers that almost
all the books printed here are dedicated to him, and hears
this naive and silly little song which was composed either
as syraight propaganda or in an effort to win his favor
by a Haitian radio singer. I favor the former hypothesis
since every sign in the Port-au-Prince mardi gras
was covered with the refrain of this
ballad and the bands are all under the direction of the city
officials.
