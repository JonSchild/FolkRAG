Dear Mr. Lomax:

After receipt of your note of January 4, we checked with
our Accounting Division to see when payment for permission
to use "The Cowboy's Dream" would be made. We are informed
that your check was sent to you yesterday, and you should
have received it by this time.

We shall be glad to send you a copy of our book in which
"The Cowboy's Dream" appears as soon as it comes from the
press.

Very truly yours,
Rand McNally & Company
