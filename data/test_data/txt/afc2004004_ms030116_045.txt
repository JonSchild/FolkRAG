gon take you to cote."  She say, "This heah my own baby.  I have my eye
witn esse that I did you no h arm.  This heah is my own chile."  So I
can see this woman goin on, takin God along with huh, sayin to huh heart,
(hoarse shout) "Time will pick up everything.  I'm goin on in God's name,
see what can be done fur me."  They tell me that she went on an left this
woman in doubt.  (Shout)  An she was taken up by officers an carried to 
cote.  So when they got to the cote, fo the time came for huh to go into
the coteroom to be tried, they tell me the two women met toget her
and she tole huh, "Do you gree t o do this:  Take one half.  I will take
the other."  An she wouldn't gree to do so.  So she decided that she would
kill the chile fore she would give it up.  They went before the jedge.  At
this time God had placed Ole Man Solomon wid the wisest of knowledge.
When they come before him to be tried, King Solomon said, "I know what
will tell the thing.  This thing what I'll do will pick up everything.
There have been many times  there have been parenthood nobody haven't
been able to tell about.  But this time will pick up everything."  An
he called his servants, said, "Oh Servants!  Oh servants!  Bring me -- a
sword.  I'm gon see if I can fine the one that love t his chile the bes.
Bring me a sword."  They tell me that the servant brought a sword.  When
they brought the sword he taken the chile up by each one of his heels
an reach him toward the one that said that she would be willin for him to 
be tookin in half.  They tell me the mother fell on huh knees an said,
(agonized shout)  Pleeeaaaase!  Don't - take -- the life of my chile!
I'd ruther give it up
than let em take the life of my chile, cause I know whose chile it is.
Please don't take the life of my chile!"  They tell me while she was
crying King Solomon called to huh to git up off huh knees an come git huh
chile.  What I'm tryin to git you to see: (hoarse shout) Time will pick up
everything!  You can do everything in the dark but God has declared
that that which is done in the dark shall be brought into the light.
