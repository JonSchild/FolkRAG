JOHN A. LOMAX
7456 SAN BENITO WAY
DALLAS, TEXAS

8/1/1940

Dear Alan: As you will see from
the enclosed statement on November
29, 1940, your indebtedness to me
will be decreased by $110.07, i.e., in
case New York and Macmillan are
not blown up by that date.

I am assuring Mr. Spivacke
that I have nothing to fuss about at 
him.  Johnny and Aunt Alice
have just spent a week with us
- Johnny a nearly 200 pounds of 
energy and rare good humour.
The girls have yielded to the heat and 
lassitude of Lubbock and do not 
write.  The green and quiet and early
morning birds notes still cheer me.
Lovingly, Father -
