Edinboro
     The house where Mary Stuart
[?] out while [H???] harangued
& the mob threw filth. Later
she was almost lynched.
     The Waverly Memorial â€“
White seated statue of Scott
below rising [?] decorated
tower.
     The houses well built, grey,
impersonal, turned away from the
street, windows all very polished
So that whole streets will catch
the vagrant light of one moment
& look like the house is lit from
the mind with cold light.
     Streets completely quiet &
deserted in the early morning.
