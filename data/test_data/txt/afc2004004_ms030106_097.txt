Yes, windin' boy, don't deny my name,
Windin' boy, don't deny my name,
Windin' boy, don't deny my name,
Pick it up and shake it like Stavin' Chain,
I'm the windin' boy and don't deny my name.

I want a mama that is nice and kind,
I want a mama, baby, that's nice and kind,
I want a mama sweet and kind,
So she can shake that big buh-hind,
I"m the windin' boy, don't deny my name.

I like a gal that's good to me,
Yes, like a sweet mama that's good to me,
I like a sweet little mama good to me,
Let me have that thing really free,
I'm windin' boy, don't deny my name.

I'm the windin' boy, don't deny my name,
Yes, windin' boy, don't deny my name,
Windin' boy, don't deny my name,
Pick it up and shake it like Stavin' Chain,
Windin' boy, don't deny my fuckin' name.

When I see that gal coming back to me,
When my gal coming back to me,
When I see my bitch coming back to me,
I know I'm going to make her "Nearer my God to Thee"
Windin' boy, don't deny my name.
