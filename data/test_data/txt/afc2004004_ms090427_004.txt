Folk Culture Study, Coahoma County, Mississippi -- 3

community. In the performance of secular music this side trip was
very valuable. 

More than 70 records were made during the period in the area
and these will contain, at a conservative minimum estimate, four times
that many songs.

The general results of the study may be seen in the impressionistic
statement which follows as a suggested organization of the
report on the study.

2. Impressionistic Suggestions for
    Organization of the Report on the Study

The people of Coahoma County are predominantly rural. There
is one town, with a population of 12,000, and four fillages, but the
familiar names referred to as places by the people of the area are
simply plantation headquarters with store, owners and agents homes,
sometimes a gin, sometimes a railroad station, and sometimes a filling
station. Such is the character of Hopson, Sherard, Mattson, Cloverhill,
etc. The so-called urban population of Clarksdale is close to
the plantation. Many of the inhabitants are seasonal laborers who go
to the fields in the hoeing and picking seasons. The four generations
living may be considered as being the river generation -- the oldest 
people, who are in their seventies and eighties; the railroad generation, 
from sixty to forty; the highway generation, in their twenties 
and thirties; and the youth and children.

The economic organization of the area is the familiar one of
cotton cultivation, but a dynamic cotton area in which the soil productivity
is sufficient to have new machinery and new methods of cultivation
