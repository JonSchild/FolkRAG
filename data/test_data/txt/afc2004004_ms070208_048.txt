Prompter, called just like preacher —

McM. Had chuckaluck, craps, poker. Seen the time I could
take six dice & a pack of cards & win this plantation 
'fo' Sundown if he'd [beat] bet me — I had
to stop [??] all that, 'cause these niggers got to
knowin’ so much about it, they would kill [I] me.

[Uglier than a home-made doll]
#
Whenever you see a man losin’ big bets & not flinchin’
You know he’s not studyin’ about losin’, he’s
Studyin’ ‘bout robbin’. #
