Not only am I a musician and singer
but I arrange music also. Some of my
works have been published by G. Schirmer
and used by leading choirs and artists in
this country and Europe. However, let me say
that I also use, and prefer in my work
as a teacher, the natural primitive harmony
and style consistent with the Negro folk. I 
regard this as a rare and difficult thing
to achieve.

I am the first Negro to have two full
time Fellowships for field work in Negro
music. You know something  of this and
my work with festivals, I am sure, from
what has been told you.

What I have done is recognized by our
best scholars as being significant. I am at
present preparing a group of works for the
James Weldon Johnson Memorial collection
at the Yale Library.
