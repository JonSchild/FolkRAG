MEMORANDUM

TO THE LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS

FROM THE Division of Music
June 3, 1938

REFERRING TO Letter dated June 1 from
The British Broadcasting Corporation
Felix Greene
British Empire Building
620 Fifth Avenue
New York City; with attached letter from 
Mr. Alistair Cooke.

I recommend that the records requested by Mr. 
Cooke be sent to him in New York for purposes of 
duplication. Although it is inadvisable to send 
original discs out of the Archive, an exception 
might be made in this case. The records can be 
sent express collect with a valuation sufficiently 
large to cover the cost of recording an equal number 
of songs.

Chief, Division of Music
