sleep an he couldn't call me loud enough to wake me. Well then, what would 
he do? So I jes wouldn't leave him. I stayed right theah. Right by him. 
I wouldn't leave him. I jes wouldn't. Finally he tole me to call Doctor 
___________ (?). He wanted to go back to the hospital. As I say, "Why do 
you want to go back to the hospital?" He say, "I jes want to go back to 
the hospital. I know you jes gon work yo'self to death. I wanna go back 
there where the doctors can tend to me an you can git some rest." I say, 
"I can't see where I'd git too much rest cause I'd wanna be theah all the
time. An they prob'ly won't let me stay." He say, "Well, I know it, but

"No, I don't want to go now. I've jes stayed fifteen minutes." He say, 
"I know it. But go head." Say, "I jes wanted to see you." But he jes [let]
set there an looked at me. He say, "You can come back tonight if you 
wanna. That's if you feel like it, if you wanna." An he say, "Why don't 
you go by Naomi's so you can have somebody to talk with a while." So I 
went on there, an I called back to the hospital. I called Dr. [Balck]
Black an I said, "I want to hear bout Huddie cause the last time I saw 
him I don't like how he act. If he needs me, you let me know an I'll
