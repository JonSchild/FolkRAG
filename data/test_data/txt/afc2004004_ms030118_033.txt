      I might put up an ything, jes to find out how you
gon take it.  You know, it's so many ways to ast a question without
jes comin straight.  One time I was talkin to a woman, I said,
YYou don't care a thang about me."  I was jes askin huh a question.
She say, "Why sho I do."  I said, "Well yo u don't show it."
They gon brang me somethin worthwhile to show they care sumpin bout me.
They have to do sumpin fo me they haven't nevah done fur no othah man.
You know, when anythang b'long to you, nobody can't take it.  Thass
right.
     (Pat:  You said yo wife lived beside you for two weeks
and never wanted anything unless you asked for it.)
     I don't wanna be bothahaed like that.  I tell you why.
You see, heah's the thing about it:  I works too hard.  I'm a old man
anyhow.  Lookin fur somethin younger than I am, to do me good.
I'm a old man, lookin fur sumpin younger than I am to do me good.
     (Me:  What do you think happens if an old man marries
a young girl?  Does she grow older, or does he grow younger?)
     A old man marries a young wom an, you un derstand, he
ain't done cryin.  No.
     (Me:  What do you mean?)
     I mean he ain't done cryin.  Cause his life ain't gon
be enough fur that young woman, you understan.  What she call fur, he
jus done passed that life.
     (Me:  What will happen then?)
     It's gon be some steppin out goin on.  Thass what it's 
gon be.
     (Me:  An he'll cry?)
     Yeah.  He'll cry.  When you git hungry -- you can go fur
two three days sometime without eatin -- but when you do git hongry,
you jis got to eat.  You know?  I tole you a while ago, Nature is one
