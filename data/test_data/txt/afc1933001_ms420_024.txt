Collector Man Blues
Walter Roland, Melotone 13103-B (15493)

Hey, hey somebody knockin' on my do',
Says it may be a collector, baby, I sho don' know.

They will try to tear yo' house down Lawd, an' this is what he will say,
Says, "I'm got to have some money, 'cause you didn't give me nothing las' pay-day."

Folks one thing that I sho can't stand,
I says, folks, one [that] thing that I sho can't stand,
Yo' children can't even play for hollerin' , "Daddy here come that collector man."

Folk don't buy nothin', Land, on a 'stallment plan,
And you will not be worried, Lawd. with no collector man.
