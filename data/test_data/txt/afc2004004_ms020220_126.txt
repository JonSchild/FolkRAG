[*RE.  BJ's SON GEORGE*]
as he come to that island, he bring that boy something.  An'
sometimes he jus' come on [purol] purpole (purpose).
     I was known in Brunswick by peoples I never had seen.  "Is
you the lady?  Is you the lady?"  That was a mystery.  See,
they's 21 years apart, and then the boy was taken, an' then
he wa'n' -- an' then he didn't die.  Ya see?
     An' the best son ya most ever witness.  Ha, ha!  Boy, he
know 'im, ho boy!  He said he's bo'n for some great purpose.
That he tol' me.  He had great ideas; he was from West Indies,
this doctor was .  He had great ideas, too.  He tol' me, said,
now, you watch 'im.  Say, "He['ll] gonna be quick."  Say, "He very
quick," you know to do somethin'.
     Asked 'im, "How ya mean?"
     He say, "Jus' quick! Just quick at anything.  He'll go make
a fire, go a' (at) anything, he'll go right to it; jus' quick at
it.  Quick at doin' it."  He is, ya see?  An', an' grabbin' an'
'lectricity thing.  "I can fix it."  An' ain', ain' no joke; he
fix it, ya know what I mean?  But he jus' look at it and I'm 
afraid he won't, won't set off the fire, ya know?  You know
what I mean, the dangerous part, before he get into that.  An'
drivin' cars or anything else.  An' the white peoples, they
crazy about that boy.  He's a great worker jus' like his father, ya know?  An' ah,
whatsoever he work, he jus', he learns that.  Goes on to it.
Yessuh, say he gonna be quick.  Yes, he's quick to thinking an'
go, go into it.  Don't know what it is.  He just that way, just
quick.
     An' Mattie said -- my daughter-in-law; I got the sweetest
daughter-in-laws in the world, hum!  I'm tellin' ya; I got two
of the best [of 'em] out -- Mattie say him and her got in an argument
