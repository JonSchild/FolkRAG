Mr. Moses Smith
Columbia Recording Corporation
799 Seventh Ave.,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Moe:
Of course, I realized you knew nothing about the whole matter of the recording, and my reference to a friendly relationship was to one between myself and the company, rather than between myself and you, for obvious reasons.

   The difficulty, Moe, lies in the fact that Burl Ives, who in this case was acting as a sort of agent for Columbia, asked me whether it would be all right for him to sing the songs in a book in process of publication, on which no copyright had yet been obtained. As a favor to Burl Ives and to Columbia, in both of whom I had the greatest confidence, I permitted the issue of these songs before our publication, which takes them really out of control of our compilation. My father and co0editor, John A. Lomax, very justly has made complaint, and I wonder therefore whether you [?] ask your legal department to get in touch with Father and make some equitable and reasonable settlement.
                                      Very best regards,

                                       Alan Lomax
