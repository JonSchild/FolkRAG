The figures on school attendance in Madison county indicate very
little differences between Negro and white children, and, for that matter,
very little about the schools and what goes on in them. About 25 per cent
of the white school children enrolled in Madison county are in junior high
school or high school, grades 7-12. Only 7.1 per cent of Negro children
are enrolled in junior high school or high school. In large part this situation
is due to the failure of the county to provide adequate facilities
for secondary instruction. There is no Negro public high school or junior
high school in the county. Some secondary instruction is provided to Negro
students at the Alabama A. and M. Institute located within the county. Students
wishing high school instruction generally go either to this institution
or seek admission to the high school in Huntsville. The Huntsville school,
however, cannot accommodate the rural pupils unless they establish residence
within the city. Alabama A. and M. Institute can only be used by students
in the immediate neighborhood since no transportation is provided for Negro
pupils by the county. in 1936-37 transportation was furnished to 45.5 per
cent of all white pupils enrolled. Tuition for high school day pupils at
the Alabama A. and M. Institute is $15 per year. Students boarding at the
school pay in addition $144.50 per year for board. The numbers, thus, are
expected to be low in view of the general economic inadequacy of the rural
Negro families.

The average salaries of both white and Negro teachers are far below
the level for teachers outside the South. Salaries of white teachers
are slightly below the level for the rural parts of the state generally, and
salaries for Negro teachers somewhat above the Negro average. The differences
are slight but in accord with the general observation that lower population
proportions of Negroes tend to reduce the disparity in per capita expenditures.
