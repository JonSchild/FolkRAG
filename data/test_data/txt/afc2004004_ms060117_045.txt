If it is true that there were two more or less independent
migrations, which differed racially, then it may well show
up in the music.  Wilbert has some tapes that he made among
the Warao, a tribe of Diego-negative marginal fishermen
gatherers, which I am working on and making a study of for
my term-paper.  I used our coding sheets for some of the 
songs, comparing them with other sheets that I did for some
Australian songs and for the Navaho.  Wilbert seemed very impressed
with the profiles.  He told me that he is planning
to do extensive field work among the Warao in the three years
following and is looking for students interested in doing
field work.  He was somewhat noncommittal, but I got the impression
that if I do a good job on the term paper, I'll
probably be asked to go along on the trip.  I'm not really
sure whether or not I want to go, as the trip would involve
considerable hardship (the Warao live in a swamp in the Orinoco 
delta--their houses are on elevated platforms which are
entirely open, meaning no privacy), and the music, though certainly
interesting, doesn't seem to have the enormous variety
and profusion of instruments that first attracted me to S.
American Indian music.  What I am looking for in S. Amer. is
cultures that are aboriginal, with many surviving instruments,
much ceremonialism, or else, cultures that sing in that pygmy
style that we seem to have found.  Nevertheless, I haven't
discussed the matter fully with Wilbert and it may turn out
that the Warao are more interesting musically than his tape
indicates.  If so, the possibility of getting really unacculturated
material is irresistible and I may well go on the
