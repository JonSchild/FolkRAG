Dear Miss Scott:

Enclosed you will find my suggestions for the leaflet.
I imagine you'll have to rewrite it somewhat, but, please
send me the proofs before it is published. When you make
engagements in the future, consult the schedule of the School
of the Air Program and assume that I'll be in New York from
the Friday preceding each broadcast through the following 
Tuesday night. You' better check with Bill Fineschriber
about that. I have contracted for a lecture at the Wooster
Women's Club on April 9, 1941. These people wrote me independently
before I signed up with you all.

Would you please file the enclosed letter to Mr. Farnell
I should like for you to arrange for an advance on submission
of complete script.

Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
