2) He dressed himself in scarlet 'ray
All mounted o'er with green,
And every town that he rode through
They thought he was some king.
3) When he came to Fair Ellen's gate,
How loudly he rang the bell,
There was none so ready as Fair Ellen
To welcome Lord Thomas in.
4) "What news, what news, Lord Thomas?" she cried,
What news have you broughten to me?"
"I've come to bid you to my wedding,
And that's some news to thee."
5) Forbid, forbid, Lord Thomas," she cried,
"Forbid it nothing to me.
For I thought you the jolly bridegroom
And I the bride to be."
6) "Come ritle-me title-me, mother," she cried,
"Come ritle me unto one.
Will I go Lord Thomas's wedding
Or will I stay at home?"
7) "Many one's been your friend, Fair Ellen,
And many one's been your foe.
But if you take your mother's advice
To Lord Thomas's wedding don't go."
8) When she came to Lord Thomas's gate,
How loudly she rang the bell,
There was none so ready as Lord Thomas
To welcome fair Ellen in."
9) "Is this your bride, Lord Thomas?" she cried,
"Is this your bride," cried she.
"For I thought you the jolly bridegroom
And I the bride to be."
10) "Despise her not, Fair Ellen" he cried,
"Despise her not unto me.
I wouldn't give your little finger
For all that whole body."
