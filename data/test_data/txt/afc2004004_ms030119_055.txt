(She had been going out with some boys?)
Yeah.
(She had a baby?)
Yeah. She had one. An you can tell it. Their skin being to git velvet-lookin. Shiney-lookin. Bright-lookin. They begin to push out, and begin to git fat. Everythang.

Fur as my feelins are concerned, you know I'm not a woman. Huh huh. Not a woman. See, I'm not a woman. But I have come to know these things though. . .I come by mine, you understand, by my quietness, you understan.  An in my latah yeahs in dealing with women. 
(Because you listen to them.)
Thass right. I come to be an age of dealin with women myself, I come to learn of these things. I used to think a woman ough ta be in a proper attitude for a man all the time, but it's not so. There be's a change about it. . .What makes it?  Thass the very time I'm tellin you bout now that makes it.
(You think a woman doesn't want a man at that time?)
If she do, it be the wrong time.
(You think it would not be right?)
I know it wouldn't be right. The Bible say it wouldn't  be right. The Bible say if a man connects himself with a woman like that the blood should be upon him jus like it would be upon the woman.
