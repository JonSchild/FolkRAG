Dear John:

The tangle over Gus Cannon's rights to his song is too complex
for me to advise at long distance. I called a friend of mine who
is an expert in these matters and, in case what is involved is
Gus's arrangement with Southern Music, my friend suggested he
might profitably consult a lawyer on the following grounds:

1.  Even outright sale of a song may not necessarily include
the renewal rights. Presumably, when they renewed it, they may
not have consulted Cannon, so they may not have had the right
to renew it.

2.  It is questionable whether they even have a bill of sale
from Cannon; therefore, attorneys should ask for a copy of it.

3.  Any publisher, including Southern, getting such a claim at 
this point would be receptive to considering settlement based
on a royalty arrangement.

If, however, Gus has signed some recent contract in which he has
sold his rights to someone and the contract is legitimate, there 
is probably nothing I can do.

If you go to a lawyer, be sure you get a really high level firm,
maybe the firm that handles the University's business.

About the Atlantic arrangement, it may be impossible to judge at
a distance. I could get my agent, who is honest and intelligent, 
to handle this for Gus if you like. All that's necessary
is just to send me the papers and I'll turn them over to him
for action. If Gus is performing, he should get four to five 
per cent for artist's royalties, and then, of course, get normal
writer's royalties for his song.

One thing that's important is that he be a member of BMI or
maybe ASCAP -- one of the two composers' societies -- because
otherwise he will miss the money that should be coming to him
from radio performances of his song under whatever deal he has.
I have just talked to the head of BMI and he assures me that
Cannon cannot have assigned his performance rights under any
arrangement he has made. He is, therefore, entitled to one
hundred per cent of this, an income which usually amounts to
about the same as a royalty income, anyway. It was suggested
that you get in touch with Mrs. Frances Preston, 23rd Floor,
Live and Casualty Towers, Nashville, Tennessee, telephone
CHapel 2-6553, the regional representative of BMI, and she 
will advise you about this and perhaps all the other problems
connected with the song.
