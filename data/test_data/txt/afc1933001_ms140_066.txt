Dear Doctor Umble:

Under separate cover, you will receive the
duplicate recording of Amish hymn-singing which
you requested. I included on the "B" side, parts
of two hymns in the hope that one of them would
meet your requirements.

Mr. Bontreger did not sing any one hymn
entirely through, since he felt that the first,
or in some cases the first two stanzas, would be
enough to give me the melodie.

This records should be played with a good
quality medium tone needle and the hook-up used
should be light and flexible, preferably a crystal
pick-up. The record plays from inside out, and
should be good for forty or fifty excellent playings
if it is carefully handled. It will reproduce
only on an electric phonograph.

Cordially yours,


Assistant in charge of
The Archive of American
Folk-song
