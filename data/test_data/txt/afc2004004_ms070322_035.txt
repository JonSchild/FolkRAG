Notes for Terrible TV show
with gypsy band.

Wasn't that kind of 
nice? - A Kentucky
mountain love song -- by 
my friend Robin Roberts 
from the state of Utah --[She's a ballad 
singin & so'm I & American 
ballads. We've got lot's of them] a Am
ballad singer like myself -
[Now that love song -]

Maybe you didn't know we 
had a lot of real folk songs in 
America - Well just listen - Here's 
one from the sedate quaker state 
of Pennsylvania. All about an old 
boy who couldn't get him a 
wife - you'll see why

Now a quick switch from 
Pennsylvania to Budapest -
from Quakers to Gypsies. Here is 
Tibor [& his] gypsy orchestra.
