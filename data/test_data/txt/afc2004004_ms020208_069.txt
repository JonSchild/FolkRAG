Reverend Roe. Reel 16. P. 4
After I got up to be a large boy, I used to see em in droves coming,
and I'd get out and hide in the woods until they pass. They maybe
wouldn't have hurt me but make me go along with em, you know, and do
whatever they wanted me to do. Some places go and take a fellow out
and whip him, and some places they'd get a fellow out, you knnow, and 
just go up to him and warn him about different things, turn him loose.
But the thing was, they wanted to keep him afraid, you know, keep him
down.
A: And a lot of the peo ple they did keep afraid.
R: Oh yeah, a lot of them they did, and some of em justtaken so much
they just got the place, they just made em kill em. They'd kill a 
white man or two and just die, just stand aslong as hey could.
A: Have you known preachers that would advise their congregations to 
do things that were against themselves, for a white man's benefit?
R: Well,maybe one time, some preachers, you know.
A: To help keep the people ignorant?
R: Yeah, to help to keep em in ginorance and teach em, you know, to
obey the white folks. Yes, I've heard preachers do that. And then
I heard em just do the reverse. Like the extremes, I called it.
Another would teach em to go on, 'tend ot your own business, live
honest and make your living, and if a hwiteman bother you, kill him
'cause they gonna kill you anyhow, so you just better carry one with
you. And I understand s whole lot of em did that. Yessir.
A: Did anybody ever come down to your part of the country andtry to
organize the colored folks to..?
R: Oh yes, yes, but they'd git run out, they wouldn't, they couldn't
do that very much. There was one person down there -- I was, oh, I 
was just a boy then. There were some white folks, you know; they
would come and make the women folks go and wash and do for em, you
know. And it was a colored fellow there, he was in pretty good shape -
