Dear Sir:

Several weeks ago, at your request, I examined a phonograph recording
system which you had been using, the examination being for the purpose of
learning why the equipment functioned unsatisfactorily. Upon examination I
found the following conditions:
        
1. The amplifier was of very poor design, not embodying the best principles 
of current practice. The power tubes were connected in parallel, not
in push-pull, and this connection seriously reduced the low frequency response 
and increased the distortion.

2. The transformers used in the amplifier were of very poor quality 
and entirely unworthy of equipment designed for the type of work you are
doing.

3. The battery switches were too small for the currents involved.
       
4. The wiring has been very poorly done. Soldered connections were
improperly made, resulting in joints that would fail easily and thus cause
noise and intermittent operation.
       
 5. The system employed a carbon microphone, which is entirely unsuited
to quality recording.
        
6. The play-back head was in bad condition.
        
The amplifier was in such a state that no amount of work could have
made it function properly and reliably. In fact, I could hardly class the
equipment as an "amplifier" in the best sense of the word but as something
resembling junk.

Very truly yours,
C. P. Boner
