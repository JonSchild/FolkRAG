Dear Miss Prink:
Archie MacLeish looked at me as severely as he can 
look at anybody and said: "How did you like my foreword?" 
and I had to admit I'd never seen it. Would you please 
send me a copy of it right away so that I can speak to him 
about it? Don't forget that Fadiman expects an advance copy 
of the book, and I think that if you send one direct to 
Mr. Luce at Time he will give it his personal attention.
Mrs. Louise J. DuBose, supervisor of the south Carolina 
Writers Project, has a folklore manuscript which she wishes 
to get distributed. If you could lend her for a few days 
the mailing list that I have prepared for you, I am sure 
she would find it very useful in preparing for her non-profit 
folklore release. I'm writing her that I have written
 you about this.
Cordially yours,
Alan Lomax
