MRS. DAVIS: 
I said you could have let me stay in there. I said but you so mean you wouldn't do it. I told them that, really I did. Cause they tried to chase me out, cause he was sick. I rubbed his knees on down to his feet and his feet were cold as ice. Were just as cold as they could be. So I said don't you all keep him down here to long like this cause he's real cold, I think they know'd he was going when we went in there cause he didn't like where he was going. 
LARRY: 
You were just riding around in the car and he felt so sick. 
MRS. DAVIS 
Brother Davis hadn't I tell you the truth, Brother Davis hadn't felt good all that week. He told me, I think Thursday, I got a pain, coming all the way down the arm. I said B. Davis its coming from your heart. That was Thursday, and I said you see tonight I want to take you down to the emergency ward. Oh he says no, he says I got an appointment for May the 9th thats on a Tuesday, I says don't worry about May the 9th I says Lets go now, I says I won't have them give you no medicine I just want to see how your heart is and instead of him coming with me, one of my friends came and drove my car and taking him to church and brought him back again 11:00, well he didn't go to bed, he set up in his chair and I put some cover on him, he didn't even get undressed 
LARRY:
