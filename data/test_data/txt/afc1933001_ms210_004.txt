John A. Lomax July 2, 1938

My article has come out at last in the Southwest
Review and a copy is now on its way to you.

Tell Johnnie I am still sore at him for not having
come to see me in Washington, that I would have come
to see him if I hadn't been busted.

My special love to Deanie and my very special love
to you. Please have a good time and come to see me
as soon as you can.
