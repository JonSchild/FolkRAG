TL:    Well, how do you get a room for yourself?  Do you just move
in, quick, when nobody's in it?
BJ:    I jes' move in it.  When nobody's in there.  Jus', say, you
see one empty -- if you already on that place, ya know?, in that,
in that quarter -- an' catch you a room empty, move on in it.
You don't have to ask nobody for it.  'Cause. . .

BJ:    Jus' see somebody move out.  'Cause sometime people leave
the while quarters an' move to another quarter, ya see?  An'

they get a room.  Until, finally, and, and then sometime they,
the white people that, uh, been livin' there in ol', big, funny
houses?  An', an' they move out.  You can just take the
house.  See?  If they ain't nobody gonna come in to take it again,

and then the people come back?
