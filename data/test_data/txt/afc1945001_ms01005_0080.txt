Sub Committee on Rumor Study                                  

Report to Committee 3,  Organizations

The first thing of importance is to note that rumors can be
studied.  In Canada, the Committee for Morale makes a continuing
study of rumor and provides the basis for a program of counter-action.  
The two-week rumor study by the field staff of Intensive
Surveys was able to collect over 1100 rumors in two cities.  The
nation-wide cooperating field staffs, in the two-week period, reported 
about 3000 rumors.

Rumors should be studied systematically, [for] Such a project
would have a number of values:
1.  Certain kinds of rumors may injure American war effort.
For example, in Canada, experience has shown that rumors
can function to close important industrial plants for
periods of days.  In New England, the Survey study collected 
evidence which indicated that rumors are serving
to reduce the labor supply being made available in certain
important war industries.  There is some evidence
reported by the Special Services Division that there
are rumor campaigns being initiated among some of the
leaders in anti-democratic groups.  For example, we have
the report that Mrs. Faber, President of the Mothers of
the United States of America, prides herself on her
ability to spread rumors and to encourage the others to
do likewise.  Among the Italians in New York there seems
to be evidence of an inspired rumor campaign.  In addition 
there are rumors of rumor campaigns in various
places.  Axis radio propaganda efforts aimed at this
country seem to be making a special point of deliberately 
planting rumors.

2.    Such a study would provide a means of evaluating the
degree of public interest and the relative concern
people have in different areas of their general thinking.  
Since rumor is related to concern as well as the
available news, if we had standardized reference on
the basis of which rumors were reported it would be possible 
to develop comparison amongst the different topics 
about which people talk.
