personality made him a general favorite. We belonged to the same
college fraternity, whose motto was "all for one and one for
all." Tom put this fine saying into effect one night just
before he left the University to join Roosevelt's Rough Riders
at San Antonio.  We had spent a beautiful moonlight evening
lying on the grass in front of the beloved old Main Building, watching the stars,
exchanging confidences, [as young bachelor friends sometimes do and]
talking over the happy days we had spent together.  As we
said goodbye late that night Tom asked me for the loan of ten
dollars, and I felt proud and happy to help speed a young
soldier on his pathway to glory.

Later, while Tom was yet in the [service] army, the University sent
him his diploma; so when he was mustered out he did not return
to Austin. He first practiced law in Waco, afterwards moving
to Marlin where he was soon elected [as] county attorney.  We 
saw little of each other for the next few years.  Meanwhile,
I had completely forgotten the incident of the ten dollars.
[The passing of six years had wiped out all recollection of the
loan.]  Neither of us had ever mentioned it in our frequent letters.

That cold Saturday afternoon I met Tom at the College Station depot, took him
to my room where a big welcoming wood fire greeted him, helped
off his overcoat, found him a comfortable chair, and passed the
cigars. We were to have a week-end get-to-gether.  Before sitting down myself I happened to notice a
book lying open on my table which I had been reading just
before his train came in.
