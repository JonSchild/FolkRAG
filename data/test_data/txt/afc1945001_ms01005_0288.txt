informant was handed a postcard carrying the above legend by an officer).
The Bureau of Intelligence informs me that this material has the appearance
of an organized campaign particularly prevalent in Irish and anti-British
communities.

The problem raised is not a new one, but It calls for skillful handling
by Arny and Navy Public Relations officers. It would seem to me that
heightened publicity might be given to the nature of our casualty lists,
which represent Americans of every faith. It might also be possible to highlight 
a few Jewish heroes who receive awards for valor or distinguished
service. There is, obviously, no need to indulge in ballyhoo, but a slight
emphasis can do much to "blanket" many current rumors and scotch impending 
rumors.

I think that several good opportunities were missed in the past: the
pairing of the names of Colin Kelly and Meyer Levin might have become one
of the colorful symbols of this war; the excellent story about Barney Ross
in Guadalcanal might have been helpful had there been some indirect indication
that this boy is Jewish. I think that if an eye ere kept upon such
possibilities - both in the field of news stories or casualty lists or
citations or other publicity on American heroes - a great deal could be done
to meet this problem. Otherwise, we can certainly expect it to intensify and,
perhaps, reach serious proportions.

Since Major General George V. Strong of G-2 has expressed great
interest in our rumor studies, and has written both Mr. Daris and myself
offering his cooperation, it might be worth bringing this matter to his
attention - especially insofar as organized anti-Senitio activity round
Army Camps and Air Force Stations is concerned.
