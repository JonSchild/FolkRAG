for a start, and directions where
to get more. Mr. Garwick
said in the letter to me
that the machine would
cost only $425.00. If you
can spend the balance
of the $500.00 for records, it
would be a very great
help to me. Please notify
me in Lubbock,
Texas, just as soon as
you can determine the
date the machine will
be ready.  Thanks.

Gratefully yours,

John A Lomax
