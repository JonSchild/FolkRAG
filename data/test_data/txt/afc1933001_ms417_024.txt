FRANKFORT TOWN
-- by Thelma Slone and Avenell Sexton

When I went down to Frankfort Town
Many workers I did pass
'Twas there I saw the governor
And I kicked him on the - hocus, pocus, sonny bocus
And you may think I lie,
But if you'd been down in Frankfort Town,
You'd a done the same as I.

There's a Billy Goat in Frankfort Town
In the Mansion by the pass,
His coat is on his shiny back
While his pants are on his - hocus, pocus, sonny bocus
And you may think I lie,
But if you'd been down in Frankfort Town
You'd see the same as I

The goat that wears these shiny clothes
Is surely not so rich. 
The bosses call him their loving son,
While workers call him son of a - hocus, pocus, sonny bocus
And you may think I lie
But if the rich were poor like us,
They'd call him the same as I.
