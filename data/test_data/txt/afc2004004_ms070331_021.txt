SWING SONG

Swing along! Swing along! See the selfish wealthy cower
For they know this is our hour
Marching on to peace and power
On!
Swing along! Swing along! Marching with triumphant clatter
Farmer labor forces batter
At reaction 'till it's shattered...gone!
On we go we surely know the foe is fading fast
On we roll we're near control, the goal of all the past!
Swing along! Swing along! And join the party of the people by
the people for the people all the people of the State!
