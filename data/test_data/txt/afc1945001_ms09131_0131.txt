1. I wish I were a bombardier
I'd drop a bomb on Hitler's ear
And when he turned to see what got 'im
I'd drop another on his bottom.
2. The story about the tall gangly 6'6" fellow who
finally got into the ski troops of the Army after
having been turned down by many other branches
of the service. After three months in the service
he still hasn't been granted a furlough because 
as yet the quartermaster hasn't been able to supply 
him with the people-size uniforms.
3. The joke about the littel anemic, undernourished,
shriveled draftee who was being taken for a ride by
his top-sergeant. The  sergeant was obviously disgusted
with this pitiful piece of humanity and finally
declared that he, the private, probably couldn't 
even kill a man to which the private replied,
in a high, feminine voice, "Oh yes I can, if 
it takes weeks and weeks and weeks."
