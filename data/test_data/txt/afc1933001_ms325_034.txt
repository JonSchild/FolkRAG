Income in the South
   EDITORS' NOTE: In view of the 
present focus upon the socio-economic
plight of the South, the NEWS LETTER
proposes in the current volume to give
particular attention to this situation. The
following article by Charles F. Schwartz,
a third-year graduate student in rural social
economics at the University of Virginia,
deals significantly with the fundamental
problem of income in the South.

A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM
   Quite recently the South has come to 
the forefront of popular attention by being
singled out as the "Nation's No. 1
economic problem." Whether or not this
ill-distinction is rightly deserved, it comes
as a climax to the growing realization
among students and citizens alike that the
condition of the South is at least in part 
responsible for the economic unbalance of
the nation. An analysis of Southern income
should therefore prove of timely 
interest, since the low income level of the
South is mainly responsible for the economic
"backwardness" and retardation of
progress that have come to characterize the
region's economy.
   Income may be defined broadly as the 
money equivalent of goods and services
produced. Its importance can be briefly
cited in the facts that it is intimately associated
with the economic progress of a 
nation or region, is a conditioning factor
of the physical and mental well-being of 
its inhabitants, and is fundamental in determining
the plane of living.
   For the purpose of ascertaining the
relative position of the South in the nation
with respect to the factor of income,
an analysis of the most recent pertinent
data supplied by income studies of the
National Bureau of Economic Research, 
the Brookings Institution, and the National
Industrial Conference Board was
made. It must be realized that income

$390 was only 44 per cent as great as
that of the rest of the country, $894.
   In short, the South had by far the lowest 
per capita income of any section of 
the country over the period 1919-21.
The Southern people had to get along 
during that time on average income less
than half as great as that received by residents
of other sections of the United
States. Moreover, Southern income remained
practically stationary, while the
figure for the rest of the country showed
a considerable increase over the three-
year period. The South was able to attract
but a minute portion of the 18 billion 
dollar gain in national income. The
beginning of the post-War agricultural 
depression together with industrial expansion
seem to have effected a radical
redistribution of income in favor chiefly 
of the Middle Atlantic, New England,
and East North Central States, and to have
prevented the South from receiving its
share of the increase in national income.

Brookings Institution Data
   The excellent study of the Brookings
Institution, America's Capacity to Consume,
shows the national income to have
been highly concentrated in 1929 in the 
Middle Atlantic and East North Central
areas. The Middle Atlantic States in 
1929 led the other regions with a per
capita income of $1,093. The South
was lowest with a figure of $368, which 
was about one-third as great. The average
per capita income of the balance of
the country, that is, excluding the South, 
was $860. The figure of the South was
only 43 per cent as great. In other 
words, Southern income per person was
roughly only two-fifths that of the rest
of the nation.
   Differentials existing in 1929 among
individual states were naturally more striking 
than those among geographic divisions.

THE NATION'S NO. 1 ECONOMIC
PROBLEM
   It is my conviction that the South
presents right now the Nation's No.
1 economic problem - the Nation's 
problem, not merely the South's. For
we have an economic unbalance in
the Nation as a whole, due to this 
very condition of the South.
   It is an unbalance that can and
must be righted, for the sake of the 
South and of the Nation.

N. I. C. B. Data
   The National Industrial Conference
Board data as presented in National Income
and its Elements do not show the
South in 1929 to have been in a different 
position in the income scale from that
indicated by the Brookings Institution.
   The South's per capita figure of $351
was 53 per cent of the national average of
$660, but 47 per cent of the average figure
for the rest of the country. To state 
it another way, the person outside the
South had more than twice as much money
to spend. The deficiency of the South
is clearly seen in the fact that, with approximately
22 per cent of the population,
it received only 11.8 per cent of the
national income. Twelve of the sixteen 
states ranking lowest in per capita income 
were in the South.

Significance of the Condition
   The analysis of Southern income based
on these three independent, authoritative
estimates has necessarily been somewhat
superficial, but has evolved at least one
indisputable fact, namely, that Southern
income with respect to population is about
half that of the rest of the country. The
real significance of the lowness of the 
South's income lies essentially in the fact 
that costs of living between the South and
other parts of the country are comparable, 
if not virtually equal. Differences in
