[*Rumor.*]

OFFICE MEMORANDUM

November 3, 1942

TO: Mr. Eugene Katz
FROM: Renzo Serena
SUBJECT: A rumor about Mr. Morgenthau.

On October 30, according to the United Press, Mr. Emanuel
Neumann, a representative of the American Emergency Committee
for Zionist affairs, denied a rumor that Secretary Morgenthau 
planned to resign and become head of Zionist Movement.

I think this rumor should be thoroughly investigated because
it seems to be a perfect Nazi propaganda trick. The rumor not
only emphasized Mr. Morgenthau’s Jewish origin in, but tends to show
through a totally false statement that Mr. Morgenthau's allegiance
is with the “Jewish International” rather than with the Government 
of the United States.
