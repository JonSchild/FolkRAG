IX. Under what conditions will a rumor become most distorted?
A rumor will tend toward maximal distortion as the following conditions prevail.
a. In the absence of evidence restricting the range of distortion.
b. In the absence of standardization of newspapers and radio.
c. As it is disseminated widely from person to person.
d. When the emotional state of the group becomes heightened.
e. When the need for information becomes acute.
f. When it is disseminated through groups of (1) differing cultures, (2) differing emotional states.

X. How may rumor be controlled?
Rumor may be controlled and discouraged by the following devices.
a. By maintaining and assuring good faith in the 
formal system of communication.
Example: it has been the policy of the English 
government to make public, so far as military 
considerations would permit, all news regarding 
the progress of the war, good and bad. In France, 
on the other hand, a policy of secrecy was pursued 
which destroyed the public's faith in their formal 
system of communication.
b. By developing maximal faith in leaders.
Example: At the conclusion of the last war, the 
formal system of communication in Germany was almost 
completely disrupted. This was largely due 
to the widespread conviction among the German 
people that they had been betrayed by their leaders. 
Rumor was immensely widespread since no 
individual would trust the press.
c. By making information disseminated through the 
formal system as complete as possible.
