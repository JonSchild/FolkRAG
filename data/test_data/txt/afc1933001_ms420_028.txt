Things About Comin' My Way [*Hill*]
[* Tampa Red, Vocalion 1637*]

Los' all my money, ain't got a dime,
Givin' up this whole world, leaving it behind, 
Chorus.   But after all all my hard travelin',
Things is 'bout comin' my way.

When I was sick, down on my bed,
My friends forgot me, thought I was dead,
Cho.

Boys, ain't it hard, when you ain't got a friend;
Just keep on travelin', they'll need yo' help again.

I'm always pleased, I'm never mad,
Thinkin' 'bout the bad luck I once have had,

Now take me, baby, just as I am,
Ain't got no money, I'm in a jam,
Cho.

She told my neighbors and all my friends, 
That I was a mistreater, she didn't want me back again.
Cho.
