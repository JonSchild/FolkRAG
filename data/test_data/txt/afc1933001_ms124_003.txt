6) Who lead Goin' Inter the Wilderness and what are the words?
7) Who lead LET YOUR WILL BE DONE and what are the words?
8) who lead DANIEL IN THE LION DEN and what are the words?
Act III
1) IN act III there are four dances that come before the Ring dance and the concluding dance, Snaket. Do you remember the order 
of the dances the night the records were made and could you give 
me the titles?
2) After the dance an ex-slave told a brief story of his experiences. 
What was his name?
3) And finally what was the name of the man who made an announcement 
at the end of the last record about the metting times of the 
congregation and a description of what each kind of meeting was for?

I know that this letter must look like a request for a week of 
your time, but I felt that you were anxious to have a full and adequate 
record of Plantation Echoes made and that, therefore, you 
would be willing to give a little of your time toawrd the furthurance 
of that task. If you can't get immediately to the job of copying 
off the words of the songs, would it be too much to ask of you to 
give me the names of the performers and correct me in case I have 
made any mistakes in titling the songs?

Please give my regards to the members of your delightful cast, 
whom I feel I know almost as [I if] well as if I had sat and patted 
my foot with them, and allow me to congratulate you on a splendid 
job sympathetically and imaginatively done.
Sincerely yours, 
Alan Lomax
