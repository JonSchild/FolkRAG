Mr. Keith Kane
Office of War Infomation
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Kane:

Many thanks for your letter of September
9. We shall be most happy to send you the results of
our collection for the period of September 7 to November
1st. Naturally, you will probably find the results
of the Reader's Digest contributions most interesting
in this connection as they cover approximately this
period.

I don't know whether Mr. Markley who represents
your office here has told you, but we turned over
to him all of our findings during the period of your
earlier study. In addition we worked through the O.C.D.
district office in collecting rumors elsewhere in New
England besides Massachusetts. I think you will find
an account of our work in Mr. Markley's report.

Our report on the Reader's Digest rumors
is now being drafted. We hope to have it in your
hands within a week.

Sincerely yours,
R. H. Knapp.
Robert H. Knapp, Chairman
Division of Propaganda Research
