THE ROANOKE TIMES, ROANOKE, VIRGINIA: SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 7, 1940

Music Artists To Broadcast To Nation Through

'Bog Trotters' Will Be
Heard Over CBS Chain

Local Staff Aids Network in Arranging
School of Air Program

Southwest Virginia and this section's radio station, WDBJ, will be
heard from all over the  nation Tuesday when the Columbia Broadcasting
System presents to its nation-wide audience a group of native
Southwest Virginia artists through the facilities of The Times-World
corporation's broadcasting system.

It will be the "Bog Trotters" of Galax who interpret for the vast 
classroom audience of Columbia's American School of the Air the
square dance tunes and ballads they learned from generations of mountaineers
who played and sang them. The group has been selected as
the artists for one of the regular Tuesday School of the Air series, devoted
to Folk Music of America.

First of Series
The broadcast here is the first of
the folk music series produced anywhere
except in Columbia's New
York studios, and will mark the
second time in WDBJ's history that
the local station has "fed the network"
on a program.

WDBJ's staff is assisting in the
production of the broadcast, and
Paul Reynolds, studio director for
WDBJ, will handle the announcing
for the entire program, replacing
Columbia's Niles Welsh, regular
School of the Air announcer.

Reynolds and Jack Weldon, program
director and educational director
of WDBJ, went yesterday to
Galax where they will meet Alan
Lomax, "folk-musician" and one of
the directors of the folk music program
series, and put finishing
touches on Tuesday's broadcast.
The "Bog Trotters" will come to
Roanoke Monday for a studio dress
rehearsal.

Two Broadcasts
The broadcast is to be made twice
from WDBJ studios Tuesday to be
carried both times by the local
station. The first broadcast, from
9:15 to 9:45 a. m., is for the east
and central portion of the United
States, and a re-broadcast from
3:35 to 4 p. m. will reach the west.

CBS directors of the folk music
series are Alan Lomax, Davidson
Taylor, assistant to CBS vice-president
in charge of the programs, and
William Fineschriber. Fineschriber
had been expected here yesterday
or today, but an accident confined
him to his home in New York and
he is not expected before Monday.

The "Bog Trotters" of Galax are
headed by Uncle Alec Dunford,
widely known fiddler in Carroll and
Grayson counties, with Dr. W.  P.
Davis, Galax physician, acting as
a sort of manager for the group.

Remembers Them All
Uncle Alec plays the first fiddle,
and it is from his almost limitless
storehouse of memory that many of
