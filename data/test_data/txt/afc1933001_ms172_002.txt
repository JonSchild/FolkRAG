Dear Alan

Just as I sat wondering what
had happened to you and Elizabeth, Pratt
handed me a letter from Miss Terrie with
a check, which gave me reason to believe
that you had not only reached Washington
but had taken time out to write your
family of the visit with us. Meanwhile
I mailed her my answer in which I 
hinted that you might be responsible, I
by the way returned the check, and at
approximately the same time, according to
the post mark you mailed a letter to me!
Telepathy must have worked overtime.

It was nice to hear directly from
you, and I appreciate the things you
had to say of your father's kindly
feeling for me. I am devoted to him - 
in fact he is the only person I know who
can talk [to me] of his two hobbies,
his work & his family, and always
remain interesting. Far into the night - 
and I'm still agog for more. He is
a very remarkable person and I know
of no one whom Pratt & I enjoy more.
