And the Wards, that's who the girls were, had to have the 
boy stop visiting.  Well the Wards' father was white and 
their mother is part white, but the kids go for colored around 
here, and when they is away I've heard they sometimes goes 
for white.  Their father died not so long ago.  The mother 
has a plantation in Jonestown; don't guess white folks care.  
Their father came home every evening to his family.  The 
Negroes talked, yet if anything was given the Wards was 
invited.

Well I tell you, up until recently, so many colored women 
living with white men that it was really something and the part about it some of them consider themselves high class women.  You can believe this or not, lady name Dora, everyone of her 
children had a different father.  When she would have them, 
she would send them off to St. Louis; then get her another 
white man and get some more good living.  But since Gregg 
Rice took up to cleaning up the country, this stuff had to 
stop.  Still quite a number of Negroes and Chinese marry.  
You know about the China girl that went to the University 
of Chicago - she goes with a colored boy.  Lot of people 
around here don't like her.  Once her father wanted her to 
do something and her mother wanted her to do something else 
and she jumped up and told them, especially her mother, 
"I'm not a nigger and I'm not a Chinaman, I'm just a mixture".  
People heard about it and cause she sassed her mother, 
people didn't like her.

I used to work in one of the leading white stores in town, 
Max Landon and Company.  Started as porter, after a while 
they would let me go in the cash drawer, that's one thing 
that Negroes seldom do.  The owners were Jews and pretty nice 
people.  I really had a chance to learn a lot about types of 
people.  Used to wait on whites that didn't mind.  I could 
usually tell the kind that wouldn't mind.  Youâ€™ll find that
the white people that you work for are all right just as long 
as you with them, but if the table's turned, you got to know 
where to put your foot and where not to put it.  Lots of 
times people asking me things.

General Musical Questionnaire

Well I tell you, I like classics, semi-classics, and 
swing.  For the different occasions I think the music 
should be appropriate.  If its dance; should have dance 
music.  If its a program; should have program music.  
I like the piano and the organ best, but I can't play 
neither.  My favorite songs are: The Negro National Anthem, 
Star Dust, Send out the Light, To a Wild Rose, I'll Fly 
Away, Carmina, The Rosary, Deep River, Steal Away.  I
