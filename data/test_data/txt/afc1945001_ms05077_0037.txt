Philadelphia, Pa.   
August 3 
--From a newspaperman:  "They're getting ready 
to shoot about 500,000 of our boys across the 
Atlantic right away.  They're massing them in 
the East and using every train available for 
troop movement.  The way I found out was by 
going to the Pennsylvania railroad on a story.  
We were going to raise Cain about the lousy train 
service to the shore.  And they told me the 
set-up."
