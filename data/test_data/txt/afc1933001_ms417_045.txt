I've been red crossed, green crossed, and double crossed, folks. 
I've been asked to help the society of John The Baptist,
The G. A. R. Women's corpse,
Men's Kiwanis, and reli ef corpse;
I've worked like heck and been worked like heck, folks.
I've been drunk and got others drunk,
Lost all I had and part of my furniture.
Because I won't go around now and spend what little I earned,
And go beg, borrow, and steal,
I've been cussed and discussed
Boycotted, talked to and talked about,
Held up and hung up,
And I'm doggoned nigh ruined.
The only reason that I'm sticking around now, folks.
Is to see what the heck is a-gonna happen next!
Now folks, if that isn't hard luck, just tell me what is.
