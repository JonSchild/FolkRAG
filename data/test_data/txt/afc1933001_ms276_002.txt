THUNDER OVER THE LIBRARY

CAREER SERVICE
FOR LIBRARY EMPLOYEES

The Library has been new lately.
We refer to: a) Washington
Daily Merry-Go-Round in the Washington
Herald, Nov. 20, 1937; b)
the speech of Representative McFarlane
in the Congressional Record,
Dec. 21, 1937, items attacking
with more vehemence than dignity,
the administration of the
Library of Congress. What impells
us to discuss an affair which ordinarily
would not concern us is
the fact that those attacking the
Library administrator claim to be
concerned with the down trodden
rank and file employees of L.C.
Careful investigation leads us to
conclude that on neither side of
the struggle is the welfare of
Library exployees a consideration.
The struggle is personal and political
and we, the employees are
a handy item to drag in. Whichever
side wins -- we don't. The axiom
that government employees will
help themselves only through their
own organization remains unshaken.
  BUT - we resent being dragged into
a private fight. And perforce
we must think of ways of securing
ourselves against the indignity
of becoming involved one way or
another in a political feud. It is
not fitting that the staff of one
of the world's greatest libraries
should be disturbed and disrupted
by factional wars.
  It is for this reason that Local
28 is giving primary attention to
the matter of Civil Service for
the Library. A study made by the 
Social Science Research Council
(Better Government Personnel,
1935) recommends enactment of
laws which for us would mean Civil
Service status and would make
Library work a career service,
free from interference of political
factors. Is this desirable?
  In order to discuss the question
we have invited a speaker from
the Civil Service Commission to
lead us in a discussion of "Civil
Service for the Library of Congress."
Come, ask questions, and
let's get down to cases on Civil
Service. If you think that you
want Civil Service, what particular
arrangement of it do you
desire? Do you feel that all
present employees must be automatically
blanketed in? Or do
you think such privilege should
be extended only to, exployees
with twenty years of service? or
five years of servicve? or three
years of service. What educational
requirements should be expected
of employees. Should examinations
be based on general cultural
knowledge, or specific library
training. Should examinations be
competitive or non-competitive?

AND CIVIL SERVICE SPEAKER.
