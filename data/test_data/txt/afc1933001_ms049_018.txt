Mr. Harold Spivacke
Acting Chief, Division of Music
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

From July 1 of 1936 up to the present time, with only
slight expense to the Library for incidentals, I have made
Folk Song records for the Music Division in North Carolina,
Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida,
South Carolina, Ohio, and Kentucky. As a result, I have
deposited in the Folk-Song Archive records to the number of
254; song items numbering 1103. On these trips, except for
the last trip to South Carolina, Alabama and Texas, during
which time I made and have turned in 74 records and 339 songs,
the per diem and mileage expenses were paid me by the W.P.A.,
under special arrangements I had made with them.

When, about July 1, it became possible for me to make this
last trip, Mr. Putnam had gone on his vacation and Mr. Strunk
had just resigned. Already I had made definite engagements
to make records in the three states (South Carolina, Alabama
and Texas), when suddenly the W.P.A. withdrew its support.
Therefore, I went ahead and undertook the trip on my own
responsibility without attempting to make any agreement with
you as Acting Chief or with anyone else.

In following this course, I met the engagements previously
arranged in South Carolina, Alabama and Texas and travelled
as far as Lubbock, Texas, spending my vacation on the work mentioned.
From Lubbock you ordered the recording machine returned
for Alan's use.

I secured the 74 records and 339 songs deposited with you
that have come from this last journey with an outlay of my own
money, as follows:
