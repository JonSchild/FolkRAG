Dear Miss Muller:

   Your letter has been referred to me by my Chief,
Dr. Spivacke, for comment.  Through some error in transmission
in the Library, your inquiry failed to reach me before, but
I now have your original request before me.

   It is possible for us to make copies of Miss Smith's
records at $2.00 per twelve-inch, double-sided record.  There
are twenty-eight records in the group, almost all of them
containing extremely interesting material.  The Guiana records
form only a small part of our collection of field recordings
from the United States, West Indies and South America, and
any of these may be copied for your use with the greatest
of pleasure by us.  May I express my regret that the inquiry
was not replied to earlier, and assure you that the Archive
of American Folk-Song will be glad to lend you any service
possible in the future.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-Song
