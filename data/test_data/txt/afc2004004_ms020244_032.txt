9/26/61 Reel, Side 2, Song 26

I KNOW AN OLD MAN AN' HIS NAME WAS NED
A white folks' funeral song for a favorite slave

I know an old man an' his name was Ned,
He died long, long ago,
He had no hair upon his head,
Just a place where it will not grow.

CHORUS:
Oh hand me down the fiddle and the bow,
Whoa, whoa*,
Lay down the shovel and the hoe,
There's no more work poor Uncle Ned,
He's gone where the good darkies go.
(CHORUS)

He had no hair upon his head,
He had no eyes for to see,
An' he had no teeth for to eat corn bread,
He had to let the hoe cake be.
(CHORUS)

(REPEAT FIRST VERSE AND CHORUS)

*The "whoa, whoa" is an approximation of the whine of the fiddle.
