Ricardo Archuleta
Cerro, New Mexico

Dear Mr. Archuleta:

Some time ago you were kind enough to record for Mr. Juan
B. Rael some ancient Spanish folk songs. Among them a song
entitled "Atencion Senado Ilustre" which occupies less than 
1/5 of one side of a 12" record, three other songs which
occupy one side of a 12" record, "O Dulcisimo Jesus," "El
Telcolotito", and "El Mejor Hombre Del Mundo". For the 
privilege of using these songs we are able to pay you $18.00
and send you two copies of each record for your own use.  

The Library of Congress is preparing to send some selections
from its Archive to various countries in Latin American and
it is for this purpose that we wish to use your songs.

I hope you will give us your permission to use these songs
by signing and returning the enclosed form as soon as possible.
All the records will carry the legend, "For non-commercial use
only" and of course your name will appear on every record. 

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax 
Assistant in Charge 
Archive of American Folk Song
