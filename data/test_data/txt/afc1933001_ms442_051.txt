A note about lectures:
Dr. Payne wrote that he was arranging a
book in Dallas through the professor of folk
lore at S.M.U., Brooks, but gave me
the opportunity to take over if I cared.
I  wrote Brooks. I wrote Beatty with
whom I was arranging a lecture. Brooks
replies that he had never heard of the
fact Dr. Payne mentions. Beatty replies,
"That makes it easy on us. We
will have someone in Sandberg's place
since S. is coming anyway. We
are booking [Stoub?] Young."
What kind of a nut is this Payne
any way. Damn him to be scorched.
The [two] three dates I have hopes of, good
hopes - Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin,
Tulsa University.
