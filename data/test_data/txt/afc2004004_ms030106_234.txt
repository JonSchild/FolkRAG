W.B.

The first night after my grandmother told me to go, I went to the
theatre and saw a play where they sang a very sweet song entitled, "Give
me Back My Dead Daughter's Child".  I thought about how my mother had 
died and left me a motherless child and how dirty my uncle Nebiscot had
been.  I began to cry.  A motherless child and orphan left out in this
wide world to mourn.  You wouldn't believe it, but I was so dumb I didn't
even know how to rent a room.  Walked the streets all night till time 
for the train for Biloxi.  Went to my god-mother, who was a very fine woman,
Eulalie Echo.  I played in various little places but I never made
any money like I had in New Orleans.  One of them was the Flat Top in
Biloxi.  I stayed there until one night the owner was hit in the head
with a pool ball, which has made him crazy every since.  I began hanging
around with older boys, for I was beginning to think of myself as quite
a man.  They told me that you could be real man only if you could take
a half pint of whiskey, throw it to your mouth and drink the whole thing
straight down.  So, I tried it and was knocked out for three whole days.
Lay under the bed at my godmother's house all that time and they never
found me.  That ended me with whiskey entirely and I never took another
drink, except every so often.

For a while, I played for a white sporting house woman, named Mattie
Bailey.  Nobody but white came there, but it was a dangerous place.  Seemed 
like she rather trusted me, so she always kept me behind to close up
the place for her.  I was always the last man out and talk got around that
she was intimate with me.  One night, some of the bums and low riff-raff
decided to lynch me, but Mattie heard about it and got me out the back door
in time.  xxxxxxxxx  I decided it was time to leave for New Orleans.
