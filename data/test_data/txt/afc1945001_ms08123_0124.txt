Blackout
It was last June sometime while I 
was sitting down on the couch with my 
foot on the bed reading the newspaper by candle 
light during a blackout. Soon there was a 
knock on the door. So I trot over to the door 
and open it. It was so dark outside a 
raindrop had knock on my door to borrow 
a match so he could find his way to the ground.
