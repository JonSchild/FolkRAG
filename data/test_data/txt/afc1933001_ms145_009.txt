Mr. Alan Lomax
124 West 12th Street
New York City
Dear Alan:
   We must have more information before we
can pay this.  We must know what it was for -
otherwise we cannot decide which fund should
pay it.  At any rate, get all the bills for
the project together, so that I can make the
proper recommendations.  Nothing will be paid
before this is done.
   By the way, do you know the Mr. Perez
mentioned in the previous week's New Yorker
as a commercial recorder of calypsos?
Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke
