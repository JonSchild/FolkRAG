Port Aransas, Texas
1/15/1939.

Dear Alan:

The enclosed Christmas
Card from the St Johns came
to you at our old Dallas address.
It would please those good
people to hear from you even though
you sent them only your address
and present occupation.

Again I remind you
of my [?] astute sensitiveness
to your neglect of comment
on my heavy literary efforts; e.g.,
the roses on our joint Christmas
card. By the way it went to all
four children with no word,
