MRS. CATE 
DIES; FUNERAL 
SET FRIDAY

Historian, 73,           
Widely Known         
For Research           MRS: MARGARET DAVIS CATE 

     Mrs. Margaret Davis Cate, historian 
nationally recognized for 
her definitive research into the 
colonial era of coastal Georgia, 
died today at the Brunswick hospital. 
     Mrs. Cate was 73 years old on 
November 24. She had been a 
patient at the hospital since 
suffering a stroke on Nov. 14, 
never recovering consciousness. 
     A woman of many careers, Mrs. 
Cate was regarded as largely responsible 
not only for historical 
interest that led to designation 
of Fort Frederica as a national 
monument but for public action 
to preserve the natural beauty of 
much of Glynn County. 
     A native of Brunswick, she 
taught in public schools here 12 
years, was postmaster of Sea 
Island from 1943 until her retirement 
in 1958, and headed the 
Glynn County Planning and 
Zoning Commission from 1939 
until resigning in 1946. She lectured 
in history at The Cloister for 
many years until her final illness. 
     Under her leadership the planning 
board designated areas of 
natural beauty such as all of St. 
Simons Island where the banning 
of signboards has been credited 
with spreading its fame as one 
of Georgia's most attractive 
regions.
     MRS. CATE'S diverse accomplishments 
included pioneering 
both chicken and turkey raising in 
this county and winning state 
prizes for the quality of the fowl. 
Every historical marker erected 
by the Brunswick Chapter, Daughters 
of the American Revolution, 
in Brunswick and Glynn and surrounding 
counties was through 
the efforts of Mrs. Cate with her 
vast knowledge of the history of 
this section. She was historian 
of the Brunswick chapter for 
many years. 
     Her counsel also was followed 
by the Georgia Historical Department 
in erecting state markers 
throughout this area in recent 
years.
     Her father was John Benston 
Davis, a native of Leechville, 
N.C., and her mother, Ida 
Rebecca Stafford, of Liberty 
County, Ga.
     Mrs. Cate graduated from 
Glynn Academy in 1905 as a first 
honor graduate. 
     She married the late Dr. G. V. 
Cate of Brunswick in 1917. After 
Dr. Cate's death in 1932 she 
moved to Sea Island, later becoming 
postmaster.
     SHE WAS a member of the 
Board of Education 15 years, 
from 1922-37. In addition to heading 
the Glynn County Planning 
Board, she was also chairman 
of the City Planning and Zoning 
Commission from 1929 until 1938. 
She also was the chairman of the 
Glynn County Board of Public 
Welfare, 1936-46.
     It was in the field of history 
that she devoted almost a lifetime 
of effort, with special emphasis 
on the Oglethorpe era and Fort 
Frederica. Mrs. Cate acquired 
an extensive collection of books, 
manuscripts, maps and photographs 
relating to Glynn County, 
as well as files of old Brunswick 
newspapers.
For many years she was vice

president of the Georgia Historical 
Society and at her death was 
its curator. In recognition of her 
work the National Park Service 
named her a collaborator in the 
Department of History for Fort 
Frederica. Archelogical findings 
in recent years confirmed her 
studies, often with amazing accuracy 
as to predictions of what 
would lie beneath the surface of 
the ground. Displays at the Fort 
visitors' center were designed 
under her supervision.
     She was author of "Our Todays 
and Yesterdays," published in 
1926 and revised in 1930; "Early 
Days of Coastal Georgia," with 
Dr. Orrin S. Wightman, 1955; and 
"Fort Frederica Color Book," with 
Al Manucy, 1957; and many extensive 
articles on the same era.
     THE GARDEN CLUBS of Georgia 
certificate of merit was awarded 
her in 1956, the Georgia 
Writers' special award in 1956, 
and Oglethorpe University awarded 
her an honorary degree of 
master of arts in 1956.
     She was first president of the 
Glynn County League of Women 
Voters and former president of the 
Brunswick Woman's Club.
     Since 1928 Mrs. Cate had lectured 
at The Cloister not only 
on history of the area but on its 
trees, flowers, birds and sea 
shells. She frequently addressed 
other groups.
     Her deep interest and effectiveness 
in communicating such 
appreciation to others caused Alfred 
W. Jones of Sea Island once 
to term Mrs. Cate "the greatest 
human asset in Glynn County."
     Survivors are three nephews, 
John B. Davis, Los Angeles, 
Stafford C. Davis, St. Simons Island, 
and William Gordon Davis, 
Brunswick; two nieces, Mrs. 
James A. Lang, Newnan, Ga,
