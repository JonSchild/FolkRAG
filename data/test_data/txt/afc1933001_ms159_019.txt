Mrs. Annabel Morris Buchanan
16 South Boulevard
Richmond, Virginia

Dear Mrs. Buchanan:

I regret to say that it will not be possible for
me to come to the White Top Festival on the 15th. of Aug.
A sudden business emergency call me to New York for that
entire week. I'm deeply disappointed, but I wanted to
let you know in case my proposal had presented any problem
to your committee.

With kindest regards, I am,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
