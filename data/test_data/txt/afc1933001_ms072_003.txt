Delhart, Texas.

July 10/1940.

Mr. John A. Lomax,
Route 4, Box 341, Forest Hills,
Dallas, Texas.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I got word from the Copyright Office, and they passed
on my Schottische: "El Rancho Grande XIT".

This Schottische, is 100%, and will last.
If you come up on the 5th. & 6th., will be glad to paay
(play) it for you, so you can make record of it, if you want
it ----- I also, have a Polka, there in the Copyright Office at
this time, and am waiting for Copyright on it ---- the Polka is
even prettier than the Schottische, and is in the key of D. & A.

The Schottische, is all in the key of D.

I wish to thank you mr. Lomax, for what you have done in
my behalf, in re: getting this Copyright ..... Here is hoping I
see you at the reunion .... I have had several letters from
G. Schirmer, Inc., Woodside, L.I. (N.Y.),,, ---- they have my
transcripts, but have not heard from them in re: as to their
offer ---- I don't believe that I will try to handle it myself,
as that is an up-hill business.

Your friend,
JESS Morris, 709 DENROCK Ave.,
Delhart, Texas
