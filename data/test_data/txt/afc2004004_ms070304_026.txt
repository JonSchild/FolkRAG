Pip I was going quite mad. She
brought me back to sanity and
being with her now for awhile will
make me healthy again. However,
I find I'm very fickle [x] when
she's there - attracted to all the
women around. I'm getting an
apt where we can be together, 
but I have my doubts about
the wisdom of it - & fear  t to
hurt her when I go away. She
is incredibly sweet, honorable, & she
wants to be married & have six
children like the heroines of all
the old fairy tales.
   E has written that she wants
to come over with Anne & the thought
seems warm & comforting, but I
wonder whether we'd hurt each
other too much or not -
