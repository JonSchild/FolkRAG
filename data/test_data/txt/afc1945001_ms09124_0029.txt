We in America
We in America don't seem to be so war minded and we seem to waste very much. Did you know that the people in foreign countries do not get half the food or clothing that we can get? We are so use to democracy and the freedom that we have but some of us still do not appreciate it. 
"We've a war to win, we must not lose". 
Another thing we must do on the home front is write more to the boys in our fighting forces who whould rather receive mail than any thing else. That is the very least we can do.
