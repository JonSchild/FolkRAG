Place - Denver, Colorado
Date  - August 12, told to me by another person:
"The United States is actually losing the war at a
much more alarming pace than the public has any
knowledge of. For example only 10% of all materials
being shipped to the United Nations from the United
States under lend-lease procedures actually are reaching
their destination. 90% of all such materials are
being sunk en route and therefore our contribution in
materials to the United Nations is very small. Most
of our materials are ending up on the bottom of the
ocean. There will be a great scandal someday when the
people learn that the administration did not inform the
people truthfully how badly the war is going."
