Mr. John A. lomax
c/o Thomas Cook and Sons, 
2 Place de la Madelaine, 
Paris, France.

Dear Father:
New Items:
1) I have recently been raised to $1800 a year.
2) The Writers Project plans to expand its folklore
activities very considerably and Buck and I are going
to push for the establishment of a folklore archive
here in the Library, in connection with the present
Archive of American Folk Song. Will let you know what
develops.
3) The British Broadcasting Company has asked for a
large group of records to be used in a program on American
folk music, As you know, BBC is not a commercial outfit;
on the contrary, it is a state owned and state financed 
company and we have decided to loan them the records
for that reason. I will let you know when the programs
are going on the air so you can listen in.
The producer, with whom I had several long talks, is a
very bright fellow and really knows more about American
folk songs than nine-tenths of the folk-lorists.
4) If you can tell me where I can find the dates of
your recent magazine articles, I will forward this material
on to Boggs for you.
5) I hope I have not made a mistake in giving Miss Smith
permission to use your material. It seems to me at the
moment more important to lend assistance to composers than
to try to squeeze a few dollars from them for permissions.
I hope you agree with me on this. If not, let me know in
general what you want me to do in regard to future requests.
