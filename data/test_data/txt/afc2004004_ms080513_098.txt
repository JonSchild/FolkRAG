Nimrod lived through all of that and ah he
learned what it was like, and he came out of
it a fighting union organiser, as did many
many of the people, and the strikes were
terrible and bloody and harsh.  Ah, the
companies had ah, a, a [straddle] throttlehold on the
com - land, and the towns, and they didn't
want to get up - ah, give it up.  They fought
it every inch of the way with gun thugs and
every kind of injunction, and they were backed

that they worked in, which was the most
iniquitous thing and Congress turned its back.
Nimrod tells how he went to Congress finally

did, ah, to help tell their story and to give
them ah selves courage in the many many 
fights that they had.
