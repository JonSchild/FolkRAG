Revered Roe. Reel 16. P. 3
so mad she said, that they wouldn't 'low em to pray. They'd whip em,
the old penny-rollers would. And she said they used to, they used to
take a pot and she saidthey'd turn it upside down or something, and 
they'd get under that, you know, and pray, and that would keep their
voice, you know, from going out where the penny-rollers would hear.
And they'd getthere and  ray, you know, in the pot.
And there was awna, they accused him of raping a girl, and they got
after him to kill him, and he ran, and there was a big wash pot on the 
side of the river. And he run by and grabbed up that wash pot and
went down in the river. She said they waited for him to come up and
they looked around there for hours, and theynever did see him any more.
And it was a long time after that, I think it was a bout two mile down
the river, out in the bottom down there, why, they found the pot. And
he had put that pot over his head and held it down -- it was heavy,
you know-- by the ears and just went on. He went on. And we found
that you could take apot and put it over your head and go down in
the river and just as long as the air lasts, you know, in that pot, you
could just walk on the bottom of that river and breathe just like you 
do up here on the street. And he went for a mile or two down the 
river and git on out of the way, and they never did catch him.
Yessir. But I never woulda thought about a thing like, I don't
know how he learned it..
(Break in record??)
Fine, you know, a thing like that. Elected the officers, and all of
em could vote and things. But later on, you know, when the Southern
white folks got things back in their own hands, why, they put him
down. And that was the time that everything was so bad -- the penny-
rollers, they called em, was travelling all over the country everywhere.
