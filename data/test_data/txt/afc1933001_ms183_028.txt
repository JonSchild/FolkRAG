Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was delighted to receive just now your Check-list
of recorded songs in the English language, since for thirty-seven
years I have developed in Canada the best library of that country
for the study of ballads and folk songs in the English language.
This library of English and American Poetry and Drama is called the
Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial Library and is at Mount Allison
University.  I have given to this Library all the books (some 15,000)
and all the records, over 1200, also a number of films.  All of the
books by your father and yourself are naturally there.

Your Check-List will be wonderful service to research
scholars.  I should like to buy a few records now of a couple of
famous ballads that they may be in the Library to exemplify the
store of material which may be procured from your Library.  May I
therefore ask you to send to me here at Brown University, the following:

Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight
1937  1415 B
1937  3250 A1  
1938  1725 B1
1939  3064 A1 
1938  1746 A2
1939  3786 B3 
1936  845   A2
1938  1735 A

The Wife of Usher's Well
1936   838 A2
1939  2906 B1
1935  3429 B
1936   853 A1
1939  3637 B2 
1938  1734 A

When these arrive here, I shall enclose them in a box which
is now being filled for this library.

Could you spare me another copy of your Check-List?  Or,
send it directly to

Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial Library
Sackville
New Brunswick, Canada
