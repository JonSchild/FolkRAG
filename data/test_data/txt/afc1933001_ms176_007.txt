preacher and it was repeated as many times as he liked. I've kept 
this up through the years. Imagine my delight one day when I found
I must get a job at once, to find the only one available was on
the sewing project with negro women. My friends were horrified, they
thought I must be mad, but I knew I could learn to sew and would and
that some day, because I was the only "white woman" as the foreman called
me, I'd be left in charge for she was from some distance out of town. 
On those days I knew we'd earn our pay checks, but I also knew the
negroes would sing and be happy for I had known them always and they me. 

Now every time I see one of Sumter County's little underprivileged
boys having difficulty walking, I know those were the pants cut by me
and sewed up backward on the day the young N.Y.A. negro boy sang 'Go Down Moses'!

Then one day a letter came saying I was to be transferred to the 
Writers Project. My friends were jubilent but I wasn't. I knew I couldn't
write, and I knew how I'd miss the songs and folk tales which they'd 
tell on the days when I was left in charge. But the best was yet to 
come. My first assignment was by long distance. I was to send 25 or more
songs at once as their National Advisor John A. Lomax was to be in 
Birmingham the next day!

If I hadn't known the songs I could have never filled the order. 
How little some people know of the time required to get those songs
from a negro! I was frightened to death - but I sent what I had. 

Fortunately for me your father liked the songs. Many of them,
tho very old, were new to him, and so started a friendship which has
brought him back several times to record in those old settlements,
songs I'd heard and loved as a child.

His knowledge of folk lore, his patience, and sympathetic understanding
of the negro have made these visits a joy to be remembered
always. 

No, neither the Library nor your father owe me anything. On the 
other hand I shall always be grateful for the privilege of having been
allowed to listen in on the recording of some beautiful songs, that but
for him would have been lost forever, and but for my father might never
have been discovered. 

I very much hope that the job will still be open when the weather
will permit our making records again together, for this country is still
rich in unrecorded gems that I would advise recording but they
are in the back woods! My regards to Mr. Spivack, my love for you and Elizabeth.

Sincerely 
Ruby Pickens Tartt.
