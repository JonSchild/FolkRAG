A rumor was heard three times over the week end, once on Friday and
twice on Sunday, each time purported to have come from someone having a
son or husband in the service, and on the fighting front, that there is much
dislike and dissension between the Americans and English soldiers. Also that the
treatment accorded Americans in foreign ports is very fine while the English are
treated very badly, shown no consideration, especially in Africa.

In each case the talkers were antagonistic to the English, saying that they
(the English) refused to admit that the United States did anything to help in the
last war and doubted if we would in this one.

These rumors were heard in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Aug. 14, '42 and Aug. 16, '42.

American-born Japanese who are as loyal as you are I are removed to camps
far from their homes and places of business. That is unfair to American citizens.

The Japanese who are taken away from their homes are getting the best land
and wages and are pampered in our over-zealous desire not to be carried away by
war hysteria.

How can Japanese boys serve in the army if they are under suspicion all the
time?

I've hard that the tin cans that are being turned in are being used to make
tops for beer bottles.

August 10. Stores of steel in possession of manufacturing firms are being held
for higher prices.

Poor quality of fruit on market now is due to local fruit being shipped away
to get higher prices.

August 11. There are some valuable tin mines in S. D. closed by international
business interests (Baruch and Churchill) for some vague but sinister reason at
the moment when tin is most needed.

One of the defense factories has miles of lumber unused but unneeded which
they are burning to get rid of supply.

The New Brighton munitions plant is a hot bed of graft. (Overheard in Tech. Dept.)

August 12. The army is going to get 90% of prune and apricot dried fruit output
and 100% of the raisin output next year. (This was heard again from a wholesale
grocer just arrived here from Pacific coast only kinds of fruit were varied and
fruit for canning added).
