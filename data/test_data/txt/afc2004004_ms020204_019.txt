(855)  but she ain't got a family.  Just she and her husband.
Now he ain't go no religion at all and he don't pretend
to have nary un , her husband.He don't even pretend to have
one.  He don't even belong to the church.  But he will come
to church sometime, stand outdo's , look in the window, but
he won't come in.  She ought to be standing out there with him,
what good she doos in the church.  [*S*]he doesn't do any good.
A:  Have you seen preachers  that were in the same fix that
really weren't  sincere? 
V:  Well, I ain't say but one preacher that I thought put on.
[*O*]ne time.  And the reason I thought he put on--- He lived at
Livingston, right in the town part, this preacher.  His name
was Eddie Yates.  We call him Sheffield.  He aw, he went up to
Elks , Alabama, and heard a preacher preach up there, Wills
Broughton was the pastor up there, so he pre---each and he had 
a very heavy voice, so Sheffield heard him preach up there a time
or two,  So he was a little unliscenced preacher , so they
had him just to preach around some time when the real pastor
was gone [*down at*] [doesn't] the Second Baptist.  He was what you call
a jack-leg preacher.  And-uh, he went down there and preached 
exactly like Willis Broughton and said the same words , same
action that he did, did the same things that he did.  So everybody 
talked about it, say,  "We never thought he was no preacher
nohow, but after he got up there and done that, everybody justed
knowed he wasn't no preaCHer.  Went and saw Wills Broughton how
he preached and carried on , went down there and did the same
thing.  Did the same thing that he saw Wills Broughton do . . .
