LARRY:
Yeah, Well he was quite popular, he was the first man that I think really learned under Brother Davis that could play you know, real well he made a lot of records. I asked Brother Davis, I say Brother Davis Why you didn't make a lot of records? And he explained to me how there was no money in it how at that time he would take his guitar somewhere and be playing on the street corner and he be sitting down and when he got ready to get up and it seemed like he could hardly get up people would be dropping half a dollars, quarters, nickels and dimes over his guitar. He say I'm making more money before I was making anyway on the street corners.
MRS. DAVIS:
I tell you what he is saying, he told me, there was a big tobacco factory in Durham and then he would sit down he would get money there you know right much money cause everybody knowed him.
LARRY:
Sure, right, right, and he didn't have to go no where, and Fuller was going off and making records, getting cheated, working in places where he might get killed before he come out. You know thats why I look at Brother Davis, you know he was 76 years old he come from a time where parties and good times were just that.you know, Like he told me once he was somewhere he was trying to make a living and someone called him to come play for a party you know and he say he didn't like that kind of thing but he went to make the money he said he would set up there and play the guitar and all of a sudden he heard a gun. People start shuffling
around you know and he say he took his guitar, it was in the summer time, he took his guitar and he stood up in the chimney,
