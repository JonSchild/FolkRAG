In Quebec they feel that they are being ground under, whereas the
New England French-Canadians are no trouble as far as something like
conscription is concerned, since they feel essentially that they are
participating in the economic program of the country.  Whereas the
Canadian French think of this war in terms of nationalistic imperialism
such as was at the base of the establishment of the British Empire, the
New England French Canadians have more of a feel for the economic
imperialism which this country has been concerned with.  It is suggested
that there is a great deal of parallelism between the French-Canadians
of Canada and the American Negroes.  The situation is somewhat worse
as far as the Canadian problem is concerned because of the barriers of 
religion and language.

When some of the results of the study of white attitudes towards
Negroes were quoted to him, namely that whites who had worked with
Negroes along side were somewhat more tolerant and liberal than whites
who had not had such experience, Mr. Irving described the very different
results which had been observed with respect to the orientals in
British Columbia prior to the war. Former students under Mr. Irving's
direction had made many careful studies, and it was found that the
attitudes toward the Japanese were [much] more better [than] among those who had worked
along with them than among those who had not.

Concerning the study of rumors, as a source of information, the 
Canadian office found that Postal intercepts were very, very useful.
In terms of analysis, the rumors in Quebec seemed to be lined up in 
three  directions: (a) Anti-British, (b)  anti-conscription, and (c)
the horror-disgust pattern such as those used in industrial areas to
close down the plants.  It is believed that these rumors are the result
of inspiration by enemy sources because of the way in which they spring
up in different points of a province on the same day.

A specialist on race friction in Canada is Major J. S. A. Bois,
Ph.D., Directorate of Special Services, Mines Building, Ottawa, Canada.

An appointment was made to speak at length with Mr. Irving,
particularly about the rumor studies, the morning of August 4th.
Mr. Irving will try to bring Major [Du] Dr. Bois along if the latter is free,
for a partial exchange of information and views on race relations.  The
meeting is scheduled in the Office of the Special Services Division at
9 A.M.

I left Mr. Kane's office at about 12:20.
