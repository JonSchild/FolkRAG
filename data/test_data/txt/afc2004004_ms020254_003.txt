BJ Tape 40, p. 1

TL: This is "Who Built the Ark?"  And where did you learn this 
song?

BJ:  I learned it from my grandparents.  Learned it from my 
grandparents, at home.  In Dawson, Georgia, um-hum.  They used to sing
it... Long years ago, yeah.  It's very much old. Right I... I'm gonna
try to sing it; I'm kinda hoarse.
