He has the Cornish shape, mm, and the Cornish
big head.  He looks a little bit like ah, ah
the hero of Lorna Doone, who - what's his
name ah . . . John  [ONE]     ,  the big man.
[*DOODLES*]
Anyway, he's, he's the - he's of that south
ah western corner of England, and he feels
about music in a different way.  He does music
to please other people, and openly says so.
[*16 .02. 47*]     
And he also likes harmony a lot.  He, his band
has a, has a, a real rich harmonic quality
that not all the bands have, and he is quite
clearly playing with his people in a way that
ah the normal ah bluegrass band doesn't play.
[*DOODLES*]     
He's really playing chords, he's rolling in
- in a very -  [ONE]     it in a very
rich way, and, and blowing his [ONE] harp
you know, really black style.  Favourite number
is a little old thing he remembers called
Swing Low Sweet Chariot, which is sort of the
ultimate, ah, mmm, chapterin our story.  For 
him that's a folk song.  Ah, he grew up as - 
- admiring D. Ford Bailey ah over the air.
[*16.03 . 33.*]     
He has nothing but affection for black people
and adores their music.
