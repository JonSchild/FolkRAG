Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am upset enough about a mistake in your otherwise
splendid new edition of CowBoySongs to "write a letter
to the editor," and that is unusual.

On page 308 you have the Santa Fe Trail ^cross-influence, which you credit
to Sherwin and Klickmann's Songs of the Ruond-Up.

The song was written and published in Denver. Words by
James Grafton Rogers (now at Yale University); music
By John H. Gower. Published in 1911 by The Comet Publishing
Company, Denver, long since disappeared.

I understand the song was written for one of the annual
entertainments of the Cactus Club of Denver.

Neither the music nor the words as they appear in your
book are quite correct. And the correct version really is 
nicer.

Probably many others have told you this before. But if
they haven't, and if you want the correct version, I 
think I might lend it to you to copy, so that the next
edition, and I hope there will be a next, will be
accurate about one of Colorado's favorite songs.

Sincerely yours,

Louisa A. Ward.
