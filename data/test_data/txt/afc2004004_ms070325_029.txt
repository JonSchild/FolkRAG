Sunday - June 25th - -
   Spent the day on the Mave with
Pat & Charley Rousen, two nice Jewish
girls -- their French boyfriends - and
a nice Negro girl, Jaqueline Branford,
whose father is the organizer of the
fabulous Negro Branford models in 
New York.  [I] The food. the sun. the
wine. the young people brought on
an attack of singing and I bawled
so loud & hotly that the cafe brought us
an new bottle of wine
