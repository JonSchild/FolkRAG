Dear Mr. Lomax :

I have left in Washington some publications I had in
hand the last day I spent there.  Was it in your car or at the
Library of Congress?  If you find them, please forward them
to me.

Also, you promised to give me the names and addresses
of the people who had lunch with us, probably you have forgotten
because I have received nothing to-date. Excuse me for bothering
you (replace the verb by a milder and more polite synonym,
I have no time to re-write the letter).
