Dear Mr. Spinacke :
1. The University of Denver has a machine to play
16 inch, 33 revolution discs. You proposed 
to furnish me a set of the 
discs I made for the radio project.
Please have them sent here at once. I can 
get the two radio stations here to listen 
to the records and perhaps make 
a sale or two in Dallas for Mr. Cohen.

2. Kindly send me copies of all 
your talks on the Archive, whatever
Alan has written about it, Also include 
you plans for the Archives development,
new equipment, etc. etc

3. Please note the enclosed copies of the Denver
program and the telegram about the 
Colorado College program. In
