     She ran back out a the room an' called Mama. "Abbey, what 
kinda way is you raisin' this gal!" I'll never forgit the words
she said! 
     My Mama said, "I ain't told ['er or] the ol' fool 
nothin. Ha, ha, ha, ha! She hadn't, neither. It was pure me!
Ha, ha, ha!
     An' so. Now, my grandmaw's an In'ian. I tell you she had 
that Indian hair an' she was pretty. That was a nice, real light, 
real light. I ain't thinkin' about her, ya know. 
AL: Did you really feel that these children smelled different 
than you did?
BJ: No! I just had sumpin' to say. That was all; didn' have 
nothin' -- We all [done] had tuk a bath. If we was gonna smell, we 
all had did one. (??) Ha, ha, yeah, ha! But yet an' still, I 
jus' wanted to say -- I didn't smell no children. I jus' wanted 
to say sumpin'.
     But pardner? Did Mama put sumpin' on me! I mean Mama
whupped me. That was 'way in the midnight, whupped me, an' you know they 
whupped me. An' they say stopped, you must stop cryin'. They
believed that stuff. You got to stop. An' then they went back
in that room an' I layed down, them [ol',] ol' chillun. I was mad
then, sho' enough. An' Georgia an' them just pet me. 
" (Cooing)
Then I was, they, they pet me 'till I got kinda sorry for myself,
I reckon. Anyhow, I went to sleep. An' went on. 
     But I never forgit that. The last night! An' I ain't been --
I ain't seen 'em no more since that next day [there] I left. Ain't seen
none of 'em, no more, no more   . I know she had, ah, 
Georgia an', an' ah, Horace, an' the oldest boy was named Abbott,
