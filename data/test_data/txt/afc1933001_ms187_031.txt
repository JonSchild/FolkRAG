Dear Doctor Rainey:
     Some time ago I had the great pleasure to meet a distinguished
musicologist and folklorist from Czecho-Slovakia who has made some
remarkable studies of both folk-song and folk life in the mountains
of Moravia. Her name is Mrs. Svatava Jakobson and she is at present
continuing her research in Czech folk-song in New York City documenting
the change and development of this interesting body of
material in this country.
     She discussed with me a plan to study the folk music culture of
the Czech minority groups in the United States with particular interest
in Czech communities of Pennsylvania and Texas. I feel that Mrs.
Jakobson would make an important contribution to the science of folk-lore 
as well as to better understanding of our own general culture
problems by the work she might do in this field.
     This morning I conferred with Doctor Goodchild of the American
Council of Learned Societies, Doctor Seeger of the Pan-American Union
and with Mrs. Jakobson. Doctor Goodchild was much interested in the
project and suggested that I write to you to inquire whether the University
of Texas would be interested in co-sponsoring this study and
giving Mrs. Jakobson assistance in her work in the Czech communities
of Texas. The use of the University machine and the help of an
operator, for instance, would be of considerable value. Or better,
perhaps, the University might see its way clear to offering part
financial sponsorship to the enterprise. It is possible that the
Library may furnish some aid in the project and Doctor Goodchild plans
to discuss the matter with one of the Foundations, I believe.
     I would appreciate greatly to hear from you about this matter
with whatever suggestions you find it possible to make. What institute
in Pennsylvania do you suppose might be interested in sponsoring Mrs.
Jakobson's work there?
With kindest regards, I am
   Sincerely yours,
