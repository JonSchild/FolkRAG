Sergeants Aren't So Bad
Two husky young men, both new raw 
recruits in the Army were sitting in their 
barracks, talking over the experiences they
had during their first day at camp. 
Joe, a red headed boy from from St. Louis, said
"Look at this uniform they gave me, two
sizes too big! Why, I can swim in it.
Then finally Tom, an Iowa boy spoke up
"I wouldn't squawk if I were you, just look 
at the thing they gave me, and look at my 
shoes a mile too big."
"Oh well I heard the Army only has two 
sizes - too big - too small."
Both told each other whom they they met and how
they thought they would like this sort of
life. 
Joe said, "I think I will get along with 
everybody except the sergeant of mine, I 
don't like him"
"Why"? asked Tom.
"Oh because, he & I got off on the wrong
foot my first day here I guess" said
Joe.
"What did you do?"
"I didn't do anything, I just didn't have
my tie on right."
