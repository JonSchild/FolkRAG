Dear Sirs
I like your School of the air program very much 
it is a wonderful idea. I went to school many years 
ago but I have to admit I learn more thru your
program now than I did at school, as a matter of fact
I'm more interested now and the things mean more 
to me. I have a daughter at school she is 8 years 
old. As we liv in the country she goes to a little 
red brick school. they just got a little radio and 
I'd like to know if you send out books or any 
kind of phamplets to the schools I'd like to get 
these children interested in the program. the teacher is 
Miss Helen Gall and she'd like to modernize the 
country children in new ideas every week she takes 
them to mills and interesting places they have a 
paper now called "the Encore." won't you please 
answer my letter so I can bring this up to her 
and I'm hoping she'll cooperate with me about 
it that is why I'd like to have back programs 
what you had on the air before. I hope this letter 
will bring me luck also with this letter I'm 
sending the best of luck to your program. 
I'd like to hear about Stan Lomax's program Lou 
 does he send out song books about the old songs. as 
I'm on the radio too on WEST Easton. We have a 
Round up every Sunday night and I'd like to have
