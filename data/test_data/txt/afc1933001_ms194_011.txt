Dear Duncan,

Attached is a letter which is obviously your baby.

Thanks for the information you sent me about the Archive. I was
able to put it to good use in the Book of Knowledge article, together
with an extended plug for our records.  It certainly is nice to know
that you and the Archive together have received the recognition,
administratively speaking, that the department has so long deserved.

The book is still kicking around, but as of this week it
begins to look as if the durn thing will actually get born under good
auspices.

Regards,
Alan
