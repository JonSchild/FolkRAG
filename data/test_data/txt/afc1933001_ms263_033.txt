in re: Catalogue of the AAFS.
The faculty of the Folk Lore Department
of the University of North Carolina has
 asked me to estimate the cost of the duplication
of the Archive recordings from
North Carolina. They amount to several
hundred songs and would mean quite a sale
for the phonoduplication division. I have 
promised to bring this list by on my way
to Fisk University the latter part of this 
week and go over it with them; but I had
thought that by the time I was ready to 
start, the checklist would have been
published. In fact I looked forward to 
taking the checklist to Texas, Louisiana,
and Georgia and other places in order to
stimulate interest in those places.
The North Carolina stop is, however, a definite 
commitment and in lieu of a complete
checklist I should like to request a copy
of the North Carolina cards be made up for me 
before the end of the week.
