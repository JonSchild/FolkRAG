& soon there wasn't one of them not
stretched out on the white fields
His whole lands were laid waste
The few that did live, he
drove west & they stretched
down beside of the mad & died.
Tuck lived only 3 days after.

The poor man got satisfaction
for the damage the landlord
had done him & he well deserved
it.

This stone was doing so much harm
that at last a holy person came
took it away & hid where no
one could find it.  It had destroyed
the whole country with wind
& high rain.
The well is still there.
