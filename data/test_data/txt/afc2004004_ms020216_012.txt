[*RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST*]

any jook or any place in the world that is, I got power to go in
there and come out.  You see? [But] Without sittin' to the table
and join the band.  See?  I got power enough to see you -- What
I used to -- If, if you ain't got sumpin' to keep you from it
an' you already done it, you, you know, you ain't got power over
it.  But you got to continue to fight.   
An' here's the next question:  When Jesus died, uh, for,
for His purpose, an' when you receive the Holy Ghost, you call
Jesus as true, an' uh, but when you see the Holy Ghos', you are
baptized within.   Ya see.  Baptized within an' 'cause the man
baptize ya without, you know, in the wadder.  Without.
AL:   I've been [?] baptized, but I never received the Holy Ghost.
BJ:   Um-hum.
AL:   Now, tell me, what is it that you experience?
BJ:   Well, the Holy Gho' don't come up on everybody, like.
I can tell ya that now, again.  Ya see, but yet and still, it
come up on ya an' it's the same Holy Gho'.  You know, when they
was all in the day of Pentacost, they all was on one ['Gos] 'cor'
(accord), you see, where it say it there?  And in one place.
Ya got to get on one accord.  All right.  An' say, an' how many
was, an' it was, uh, so many that was endowed wit' the Holy Ghos',
see?  An' the Holy Ghos' fell upon them, every one of them, ya
see?  An' they all began to, to, ya know, speak with, with other
tongue, because you, they's jus' speakin' of the Holy Ghos'.
See, the Holy Ghos', itse'f, speaks for itse'f.  It was a witness-
bearer, of its own se'f, see?  The Holy Ghos' bears its own
se'f witness.  An' the truth then is -- You can see it; it's a
mark.  Ya see, what I mean.  It's, it's in there.  Because you
are baptized.  An' then. . .
