One night after the soldiers
had all gone to bed one private
found that it was impossible
to go to sleep. So he decided to slip
out & go see his girl. Just as he
got past the last hut & thought
he was free, the centry stopped
him.
"Where do you think you're 
going?" said the centry.
"To see my girl," said the private.
"Oh no you're not, said the centry,
cause if you don't turn
around & march right back
I'll shoot you."
The private looked at him and
said, "I got a mother in heaven
& a girl in Harlem & I'm gona see
one of them tonight.

A sticker on the window of a
baker shop said, "Lord please
help me to keep my big mouth
shut."
