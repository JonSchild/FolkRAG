probability rumors were spread even though a good deal of news was available.
The greater incidence of rumor among the better educated probably reflects
their broader horizons, which in part may be the result of a larger
variety of precipitating phenomena as well as a higher educational and informational level producing greater interest and concern in events. This
combination would almost necessarily lead to the greater frequency of rumor 
observed.

Rumors reflect psychological aspects of the people who repeat them.
We do not repeat everything we hear. We select items in accordance with those
things which define us as a person. Not only is there the selection of rumor,
but there is also distortion as rumor is transmitted from person to person.

Efforts have been made to classify the rumors in the Intensive Surveys
Study of Portland and New Brunswick in accordance with the way in which they
reflect different psychological characteristics. The rumors seem to fall
into four types. Thirty-five percent showed hostility, twenty percent gave
evidence of anxiety, ten percent were wishful, while thirty-five percent
seemed merely to reflect curiosity without any very deep emotional toning.

The curiosity rumors in Portland and New Brunswick reflected chiefly
local interest in the shipyards in one city and the enemy camps in the other.
Such stories as the following were current:
There was a big river battle in the Harbor a few nights ago.
Submarines are floating supplies ashore.
Telephones have been taken out of the (nearby) camp so that boys
can't call any place.
Whenever leaves are taken away, it means they are going to be
shipped somewhere.

On the national scene, the curiosity rumors took the form of announcing that
this hotel or that hotel was being taken over by the Army or Navy or other
