Down On Me

O down on me, down on me---, O Lord,
Look like everybody in the whole round world
Down on me.

If I could, I sholy would,
Stand on the rock where Moses stood,
O look like everybody in the whole round world,
Down on me.
O down on me, etc. .

When I gets to heaven, I know I'm gon' shout,
Nobody ther gon' to turn me out,
O look like everybody in the whole round world
Down on me.
O down on me, etc. .

Go down, angel, in the South,
All God's chillun gon' jump and shout,
O l[i]ook like everybody in the whole round world 
Down on[m] me.
O down on me, etc. .
