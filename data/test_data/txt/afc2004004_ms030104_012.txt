When I think of a man
Regardless of what he propose to be
That would send men out

With all of their cruelties

And with all of their destructive natures

And drop bombs an' fire [line]

An' incendiaries upon defenseless people

Then, brethren, let me come home

That's over there in Hitler's territory

YEAMEN. 

Let me come home.

Or when I see a man that'll do more

For (you'll pardon me)
SAY IT. SAY IT.
When I see a man that'll do more
For some other woman

Than he will for his wife an' his children

I say the ol' man's loose again
[in Hell's walkin  men on earth]
ALRIGHT.

He's makin' 45 dollars a month

Five children and a wife

He's gotta have an automobile to drive the other woman aroun'

An' that woman gotta make a crop with them children

You mean to [tll] tell me that there's not a Hell?

You mean to tell me that the agents of Hell

Are not operatin' in that man?

[As soon as we are born]

We go about speakin' lies

All we like sheep

Have gone astray

Each wandring in a different way.
[*pause*] [*Folks there's a hell*]
Not only is Hell [not] a place

But Hell [wasn't] isnâ€™t made

For folks that'll believe
  Aw naw.
If you believe

You don't have to go to Hell

But if you won't believe
