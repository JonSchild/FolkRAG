65 

And we shall meet above, 
Where fear of parting ne'er can come, 
In that sweet world of love. 

And there with Christ, in Paradise, 
We shall forever dwell ; 
Till then, let's pray, both night and day, 
And so, dear friends, farewell. 

No. 65 

While passing a garden, I paused for to hear, 
A voice faint and plaintive, from one that was
there ; 
The voice of the sufferer affected by heart,
While in agony pleading the poor sinner's part. 

In offering to heaven, his pitying prayer, 
He spoke of the torments the sinner must bear ; 
His life, as a ransom, he offered to give, 
That sinners redeemed, in glory might live. 

I listened a moment, then turned me to see 
What man of compassion, this stranger could be ; 
I say him low kneeling upon the cold ground, 
The loveliest creature that ever was found. 

His mantle was wet with the dews of the night,
His locks by pale moonbeams were glistening and
bright ; 
His eyes bright as diamonds, to heaven were raised 
While angels, in wonder, stood round him amazed. 

So deep were his sorrows, so fervent his prayers,
That down o'er his bosom, ran sweat, blood, and
tears. 
I wept to behold him, I asked him his name ; 
He answered, 'Tis Jesus, from heaven I came. 

I am thy Redeemer, for thee I must die,
