Mr, John A. Lomax,
Wilton, Conn.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
Since I wrote you on February 20th
I have secured from the District Clerk at Boston
the court papers in the case of State of Texas v.
Walter Boyd and find that he was indicted for murder
by the Grand Jury of the Bowie County on January 29th,
1918, the indictment charging that he killed Will
Stafford on December 18th, 1917, by shooting him
with a gun. I understand that Stafford was also
a negro. The papers indicate that Hugh Carney,
afterwards District Judge was the District Attorney
and prosecuted Boyd.

It appears that Mahaffrey & Keeney
did represent Boyd but neither of them can remember
anything about the case. They were doing a large
criminal practice at that time and this negro's
case has evidently escaped them.

The court's charge is the one usually
given in murder cases of this kind. I attach however
a part of it which may give you some information about
Boyd. Two witnesses testified that Boyd told them that
under the name of Huley Ledbetter he had been convicted
in Louisiana for shooting at a man and put on the chain
gang from which he escaped, raped a woman and then went
to Texas where he changed his name to Walter Boyd.

I also enclose copy of the affidavit
made by Henry Brooks, jailer and deputy sheriff, in
connection with Boyd's escape and on which his appeal
was dismissed.

Yours very truly,
A L Burford
