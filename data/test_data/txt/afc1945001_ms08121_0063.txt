Jokes Concerning the War.

There are many jokes going around the
country concerning the War and also
Hitler, Hirohito, and Mussolini. There
was one I rather liked. It was about the
germans, and went something like this:
One day on a streecorner in Berlin, there
was a drunken man yelling to the top of
his voice: "The dictator is a bum! The
dictator is a bum!" He was yelling so loud
that a german "Storm-trooper" heard him
and took him to the Captain of the gestapo,
and said, "Mein, Captain, this dumpkoff [dummkopf]
was calling der fueher [führer] names. He was
yelling, "Der fueher [führer] is a bum!" And the Capt.
said, "What do you haff to say." And the
drunken man said, "It wasn't the fueher [führer]
I was calling a bum it was Mussolini.
And the Captain of the Gestapo said,
"Dumbpkoff! There is only one bum of a dictator
Then theres another one about Hitler and
Mussolini. This one is in a room at
Hitlers headquaters [headquarters] in Berlin. We hear 
Hitler saying: In the other room is a 
skunk! And the man who stays in there
the longest will be the bravest one.
