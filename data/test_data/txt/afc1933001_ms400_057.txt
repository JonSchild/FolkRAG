Chain Gang Negroes - Page Five

father, brother, or from men friends. Often the letters
contained post office money orders for small sums - twenty-five
cents, never more than a dollar. This money keeps the crap
games going. Clear Rock, a Texas convict, boasted once to me
that in successive crap games he had won the entire capital of 
more than two hundred Negroes - less than thirty dollars. All
this money had come from letters from home. Convicts are
everywhere furnished tobacco, sometimes a weekly amount in cash,
to make purchase at the penitentiary Commissary or in a store
run by a convict.

I asked an old Negro man herding milch cows on the
Penitentiary Farm at Parchman, Mississippi, how he came to get
locked up. "My trigger got loose, Boss," and then he added the
shocking detail, "Dat shotgun tore dat nigger nearly half in two."

Another Negro murderer justified his plight, "Me and another
nigger was shooting craps. I made my pint and he wouldn't recognize
it." They are shy of the word 'kill' and usually when not
claiming innocence, they attempt to defend themselves. "If he
hadn't kept on bodderin' wid me, I never would have hurt him."

"I just got to shooting niggers an' couldn't stop," said
Allen Prothers, a Tennessee boy, explaining how he had shot his
wife's lover and then also a second boy friend bystander.

"Boss, can't you help me get outa this place, I just
naturally don't like it," said Black Sampson to me as I told him
goodbye on leaving the Nashville Penitentiary. "Ninety-nine is
a load on my shoulders dat I can't shake off."
