whole of the union organisation, he was a

For instance if they made a chute and a lot
of slate came down with a lot of coal they
weren't paid for getting the slate out of
there,  it might take them a day,  they were 
only paid for the coal  they produced and
they were killed by the hundreds in every

their pick might hit the wire and they

couldn'r keep them out of the mine  , no 
matterwaht  the conditions wre,  they all 
went back  .  They tried to quit and then
they would have to go back again.  One of
