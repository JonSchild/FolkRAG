August 14. The only thing done so far on the Alaska Highway is a series of work
camps and a trail.

The Jews are profiteering in the sale of scrap rubber and scrap metal. (Heard several times).

August 15. The following were heard by man on train on way to Minneapolis from 
Pacific Coast:
Dutch Harbor catastrophy was far worse than ever reported by Government.
Sugar rationing never should have been started and is kept up to save face.
Am. Government always late was planning to into Attu to build an air base
this summer but was beaten to it by the Japs.

Art Department.

Every one in the Art department has been on the alert for rumors, but not one
has been heard. It is interesting to note the greatly increased study of the books
on photography. Many sailor boys come in for them. A number of young men have
said that they were seriously studying photography hoping to get into that branch
of war service. So you see that our patrons are not spreading rumors about the
war, but taking advantage of every opportunity to be of greater service to their
country. August 15, 1942.

East Lake Branch, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

During the past week we have heard only two rumors. The first, based on the 
recent newspaper article that the war would be won or lost within the next forty
days; the second, that gas rationing would go into effect on August 15, in this
locality, and as proof, it was stated that Brown and Bigelow were now printing the
ration books.

Branch Department, Minneapolis Public Library, Minneapolis, Minn.

Quoting from a letter received from Pennsylvania:

According to reports here, the Mellon Institution has long had rubber substitutes
available and willing to go ahead with their projects to aid both government and
individual but being thoroly Republican, their schemes do not set well with the
Administration.

Franklin Branch, Minneapolis, Minnesota

Two women on the bus - August 10, 1942
1st woman - Things are getting worse. I get a headache if I let myself
think of the war.
2nd woman - Well, I have three brothers in the service. They say that
everybody will be in it before long. They are going to have an army of
10 million men.
1st woman - Yes, a man told me yesterday that not only the youngsters
but the oldsters will be in it too as soon as the elections are over.
