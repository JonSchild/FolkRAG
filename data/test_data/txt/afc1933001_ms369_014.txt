his quieter moments Gummere realized the difficulties of
presuming such an origin for the Child ballad, but the presumption 
was strong enough to prejudice the definition of
the ballad quoted above - and, I might remark, the writings 
of most subsequent ballad critics and the activities
of most ballad collectors.
Prof. Kittredge, who has inspired the ballad work
done in this country, adopted Gummere's point of view almost 
entirely. He did, however, realize that the English
Ballads were not in all likelihood composed in the manner
described above. He made a strong distinction between
oral and written literature. A poem in the literary sense
is dated and a closed account, while the date of composition 
of a ballad is only the beginning of a process by means
of which it becomes a genuine popular ballad. Probably,
however, the originator of most of the ballads (most, because 
some of them were undoubtedly derived from metrical
romances, chronicles, etc.) was a poet in a different sense
from, say, Shelly or Keats.

* Perhaps it has not been made clear that Gummere regarded
the ballad as a definite form with a distinct evolutionary 
history of its own, analogous, for instance, to the evolution 
of the Tarsier which evolved along its lines as its
descendants, the higher ape forms, evolved in their way.
This analogy is completely misleading. The folk make no
distinction between narrative and other varieties of songs
in the mountains, for example, they are all called "love
songs" - and the ballad has not evolved separately from
other poetic forms, except, perhaps, as it has taken on a
more definite form in the minds of editors and collectors.
