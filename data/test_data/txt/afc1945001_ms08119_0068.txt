1. A girl who graduated from this school 
in February told me this; “I haven’t as
much to eat since rationing began. I
now have two sandwiches before supper
when I used to have five.” The funny
part of this is she is very fat and is
always eating starches and sugars which
are very fattening.
2. I was in Sears last week with my
mother and a lady came up to us
and said; “I am not going to be caught
with my pants down when the rationing 
of clothing starts, I just bought
four dozen pair of pants.
