St. Paul, Minnesota, August 6. - Mr. S had heard from his brother 
who is in the Army Air Corps somewhere in Utah, that several hundred
aviators, most of them with more than a year of flying experience, were
standing by without anything to do because of an acute shortage of
training planes. He said the men were restless, discouraged, and disgusted
because they were not furnished the equipment to continue their
flying training or to get into combat service.  48
