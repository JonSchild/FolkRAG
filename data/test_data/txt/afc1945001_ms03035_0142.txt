RUMORS IN DETROIT, MICHIGAN
Reported by Bert M. Grim
10-7-42
A customer in a beauty shop on West Grand
Boulevard in the General Motors district told
of knowing a foreman in the Ford bomber plant
who said that it was almost impossible to get
any work done; that the plant and government
were employing Negroes in large quantities;
that the Negroes carried weapons - knives, razors,
billies, etc. - and defied the foremen to fire
them for slowing up productions.

Within the past ten days a Negro attacked a white
man with a razor. When the attacker was fired
his union sent his steward to investigate. This
man who represented the union upheld the Negro
saying that it was too damn bad he didn't cut the
foreman's throat. The rumor is that this situation
is getting worse and the foremen and plant personnel
cannot get out their production as fast as they
could if they had better cooperation.

The lady reporting this rumor seemed to be a very
dignified lady about sixty years old, a lifelong
resident of Detroit knowing several officials
and men working in the Ford plant.
