A WISE TEAM
Tune of Yankee Doodle.
A farmer owned a stubborn mule,
To add to all his troubles,
Each day he kept that crazy fool,
His troubles came in doubles.

He had a horse--'twa just as bad,
He drove the two together,
They'd run away and make him mad,
In rain or stormy weather.

He had a crop of wheat one fall,
He'd teach these two a lesson,
Each day he'd make them pull a haul,
He'd give them quite a dressin'.

One day he started to the town,
A great big load behind them;
His feet got cold and he got down--
They left him singing anthems.

The elevator man looked out,
He saw the wagon coming;
They pulled open the scale all hot,
He weighed the load a humming.

The two, they didn't wait for pay,
They started home a laughing,
They felt that they had earned their hay,
That farmer's still a gapping.

That horse and mule, like other mules,
Had made as good a bargain,
As good a price as human fools,
Who sit upon their wagon.

First chorus.
Farmers, wake up, wake up now,
And you will learn the wisdom.
F. E. U. will show you how,
To break this crushing system.

Second chorus
Union farmers, keep it up,
Union farmers, dandy;
Mind you battle and your step,
And keep on being handy.
