[*Mr. Spivacke: 
Alan asks that you 
reply to this letter JAL] 

Mr. Alan Lomax 
Music Division 
Library of Congress 
Washington, D. C. 

Dear Mr. Lomax: 
I have been, several times, on the 
point of writing you, but until now have never been 
able to "get around to it." As perhaps you know, I 
have been collecting traditional ballads and songs 
in this state for the past for or five years, and a 
year or so ago corresponded with your father regarding 
the possibility of his coming to Indiana to record 
the tunes of at least some of the songs recovered. Our 
tentative plans fell through, however, because of the 
fact that at the time he could do the recording I was 
not free to work with him. 
Last summer Miss Lucile Wilkin, who 
was at the time working in the Library of Congress, 
wrote me about you (you were then doing, or about to 
do, some recording in the South, I think) , suggesting 
that I get in touch with you and find out your plans. 
Other pressing matters interfered, so that I am only 
now writing to ask if you will be doing more of this 
work during the coming summer, and, if so, in what 
part of the country. My plans for the summer are at 
present indefinite. I am trying to get a grant from 
the American Council of Learned Societies for further 
collecting in this state during the summer months, but 
have no assurance of getting it.  So far I have done 
all my collecting without and financial aid, but now
that I am completing my work for the doctorate here, 
I no longer feel that I can afford to finance the collecting 
myself, much as I should like to do the work. 
If financial help is not forthcoming from some source, 
I shall probably remain in school during the summer. 

If you are interested in recording some
good ballad tunes from Indiana (duplicate records to 
remain in my possession, as was the agreement with 
your father) and this section can be included in your 
summer itinerary, I shall be glad to hear from you.   You
