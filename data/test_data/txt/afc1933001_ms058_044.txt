In case you are to be around I
plan to look in on you about
June 15 or 20

I have spent some money
on tips to Negroes and whites who
give me there work time (this is the
busiest crop season). By staying around
longer I might probably have got
the same material without cost,
but I chose the more direct
route, which, I hope, will meet
with your approval.

Thank you for your
kind notes.

Always sincerely,
John A. Lomax
