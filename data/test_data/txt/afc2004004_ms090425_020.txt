He Rose Up from the Dead

He rose,
He rose
He rose
He rose,
He rose up from the dead.
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose up from the dead.
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose up from the dead;
And the Lord will carry
My spirit home.

Show the baby's body
And learn it from themselves.
Rose up gracious body
And laid it in the tomb
Rose up gracious body
And laid it in the tomb.
When the Lord went down
Thy spirit, Lord.

He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose up from the dead.
He rose,
He rose
He rose,
He rose,
He rose up from the dead.
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose up from the dead;
And the Lord will carry
My spirit home.
