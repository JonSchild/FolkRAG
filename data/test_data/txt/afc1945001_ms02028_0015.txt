"I went to the beauty parlor Saturday and the operator had had a bunch of WAAC's and are they sore? They said they came in here to have office jobs, to sit behind fancy big desks and get commissions and here they are drilling until they're sick, sitting around on the floor like a bunch of hogs, and when they go to the doctors, there are so many there that there aren't enough chairs in the sitting room for them while they wait. One said she left a good job to take this training and if she had know what it was going to be she sure wouldn't have come. They beauty operator said they will have commissions some time and they said: 'Yeah, when want someone to do some dirty work behind the front lines over there.'" WPA worker. 8-5-42.
