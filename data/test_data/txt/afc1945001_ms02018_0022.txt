Selective Service
1.  The Army physical standards are going to be lowered so that practically 
every man will be taken.  (Married man with wife who works.  10/7/42)
2.  There are not enough 18 and 19 years olds to make a great deal of 
difference in deferments, because a large percentage of them have 
already enlisted.  (Worker in war industry.  10/9/42)
3.  Selective Service quota system is going to be changed as in many 
districts the quotas cannot be filled without taking skilled 
workers.  (Woman, prominent in public affairs.  10/8/42)
