f.  The Departmental Agencies come in contact with
rumors through their unsolicited mail, personal
contacts, etc.  Arrangements can be made for O.F.F. 
analysis of this material, or, ideally, relevant 
sections of it.

g.  The Media Division readers should follow a continuing
directive to detect and report rumors appearing in 
the press, magazines and on the radio.

The collation of this data will constitute a full-
time function for several highly-skilled analysts who should 
issue rumor reports at regular intervals for the guidance of
O.F.F. and information policy-makers.

(This collation is not a "spot" job but must be carried 
on continuously and, given its ramifications, the staff performing 
this work should not be encumbered by a variety of
commissions unconnected with the rumor field.)

2.  Counteraction of Rumors

To the Bureaus of Operations, Liaison and Production is
properly assigned the task of counteracting rumors in
direct consultation with, and on the basis of information 
furnished by, the Rumor Division of the Bureau of Intelligence.
