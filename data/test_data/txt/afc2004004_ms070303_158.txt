They gred me claes to hap my back.
And mittens to my hands, sir,
And they swore I was the bravest lad
In a' their Hielan clan, sir.
We spent the maist o' a' our time
In marchin' up and down sir
Wi' a feathered bonnet on my heid
And powdered to the crown, sir
But legs they gart me change my tune
And sent me off to Spain sir
Where fifty regiments in a row
Cam' marchin' owre the plain, sir.
For three lang days and nichts we fought
Till I thought it would never end sir
When a bullet cam' whistlin' through
my leg
And I up and fired again, sir.
