    White and colored people live here in
peace and harmony. Memphis has done more for her
colored citizens than any city in America.

    I have inquired of a number of prominent
colonial citizens about the Bessie Smith case, and not one has
any knowledge of her having been brought to Memphis for
treatment.

    If you wish further information on the
subject, let me hear from you again, and I will try to
supply any additional facts obtainable.

    Thanking you for your interest in the
entire matter, and for your efforts to put Memphis in
the right light, I am,

    Yours very truly,
    Walter Chandler
    Mayor
