If a mule was running away with the world
Woe-ee-ee Lord, I'd let him go
I wouldn't tell a mule to "Get up" if he was
      setting in my lap
I wouldn't tell him to "Whoa" if it would
       hurt my old grand pap
All night long, hollering Whoa, Gee, Get up - in
     my sleep. 38.

Moreover, the blues are now sung by boys and girls as they pick cotton.

      Love me baby, love me
      Love me baby, love me
      If you don't love me baby
      I'll throw myself in the sea
      Where the fish and whales can fuss over me

      Love me daddy, love me
      Love me daddy, love me
      If you don't love me daddy
      I'll shimmy on the mountain top
      Where everybody can fuss over me.    39.

      The plantation Negro knows that "he has a place" in the city.
He seems to delight in telling stories or reciting poems that show
the Negro "besting the white man", as well as, ridiculing the white
woman.

     I took a gal to the ball the other night
We hadn't got far before we got in a fight 
The cop said, "Move on", but we didn't budge
Next morning, I had to say - Good morning judge.

     The cop said, "Judge, this coon is a fad"
Then I pulled a thousand dollars out of my money bag 
Put on my coat, and started toward the door
All the darkies in the court room began to roar
"I wonder what is that coon's game
The way he spends his money, why it's a shame
Is he from Klondike or from Maine, is what I want to know 
He has got me a little worried, I must admit
The yellow gals will make a terrible hit
And I wonder, what is that coon's game?"
