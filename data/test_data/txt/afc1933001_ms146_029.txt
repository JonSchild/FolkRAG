My dear Mr. Lomax:

I thank you most kindly for the 
information you gave me concerning the song
Joe Bowers.
For the past three weeks I have tried 
to get a little history about the negro song
Batson.  I am sorry to tell you that I have been
unsuccessful.  I remember that the darkies on
our plantation sang it after the hanging of a 
Mr. Batson.  They claimed that he had asked to 
sing this composition of his on the scaffold
before his hanging.  I recall only one line-
"And you can't bring poor Batson back".  Later
on if I am successful in securing any information
you will certainly hear from me.

Cordially yours,
Sarah Buchanan Dalles
(Mrs. Paul Dalles)
