OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION
Memorandum of Rumors and Rumor-Control Groups
Not for Publication

The Office of War Information has received many requests
for cooperation and guidance from groups which are interested in
rumor control. This memorandum is written in response to such
requests. It was prepared on the basis of an analysis of more
than 4,500 rumors and the experience gained in working with various 
rumor-control projects.
Fighting rumors is a complicated, technical task. It 
raises problems in public information, military security, and 
social psychology. It involves specific techniques for handling
the uneasiness and hostility which any war necessarily arouses.

Dangers in Anti-Rumor Activity
Programs which are conducted without an awareness of the
inherent and potential dangers of anti-rumor activity may tend to:
a. Circulate the very rumors which are being denied.
b. Circulate more rumors than are effectively denied.
c. Make the community too "rumor-conscious."
d. Create widespread uneasiness, which is fertile soil
for more rumors.
e. Exaggerate the danger of enemy propaganda -- creating
unnecessary fears about the enemy's cleverness or
propaganda success in the United States.
f. Deny only certain kinds of rumors, allowing other
rumors to circulate more freely.
