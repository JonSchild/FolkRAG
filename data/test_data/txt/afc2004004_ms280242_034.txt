5) "O good morning, how do you do?
How is your daughter Janetty noo?
How is your daughter Janetty noo
Since I laid her in the Dentidoonbye?"
6) "My daughter Janet is no very well,
My daughter Janet she's looking awfu' pale,
She's round at the waist and she kowks at her kail
Since ye laid her in the Dentidoonbye."
7) O he took her by the wee bit hand,
He showed her through his room number one.
He placed her cock into her hand,
Saying "You're lady of the Dentidoonbye."
8) "O," said theold man, "What will we do?"
"O," said the old wife, "We'll dance until we dee."
"O," said the old man. "I think I'll do that too,
Since she's Lady of the Dentidoonbye."

The Dark-Eyed Lover:
1) Once I loved a dark-eyed lover,
And he thought with me.
Till one day he found another,
And he's sat no more with me.
2) He took the ring from off my finger,
And the flock from by braids,
"Farewell, you old lover,
Weel I know who you love best."
3) O dear, if you be weeping,
There's the lad you called mine.
If you think I'm so unworthy,
Go and leave me, I don't mind.
4) When I made my bed of stickles,
And you'll see the ways are thorny,
And you'll want me back again.

I learnt it as a wee boy. Heard it here and there among the
travelling classes.

The Berry-Picking Song:
1) O last night I was on the groundee,
Me and my wife and bairns three.
O the nicht we went to Blairgowrie
To pick the berry.
2) O to pick the berry for the hornies
A think I'll never do.
To pick the berry for the scurvies,
I canna get oot the noo.
