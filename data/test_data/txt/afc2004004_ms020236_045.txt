             All right.  It was a white man; the sawmill run by a 
white man from New York.  He was out this -- he was a sawyer, 
you know, a sawyer at the mill, you know, a sawyer.  At the 
plant, makin' all that pretty -- all that stuff, you know.  
An' I would go to the sawmill 'most every other day or two 
and get wood, them blocks an' things so me an' Miss Alice could, 
you know, keep her warm, [an'] like that.  An' I notice so many times 
I been up at that mill, I got to where I wouldn't want to go; 
I'd send Laz'rus sometimes.  Well, I didn't like the sport that 
they would do when I be out to the mill an' leave there.  
Hear 'em whoopin' an' hollerin' an' talkin', oh!  I was stout 
you know.  An' all kinda mess,        "Big, fat mama; [meat] the 
meat's shakin' on 'er bones!"  An' all kinda ol' mess, ya know?  
Like that.  An' it jus' make me sick.  An' I jus' didn' like
 it.  An' I wouldn't never look up at 'em an' laugh at 'em, an' said 
nothin'.  An' so I didn' know what it was all about.
             Dis white man up from New York, he was offerin' to pay 
any of 'em some money to get me to go up to Eva's so he could 
talk to me, ya know.  He wanted me,  And as much talkin' he done 
done around there around all them people, it made me feel like 
  a [(flower?)]. [*flatterer*]      You know?  'Cause he was talkin' 
to the fellas, you know.   He was tellin' 'em.  An' [he had] here 
come some of 'em to carry me, different ones, different colored 
boys been tryin' to get me to go over there.  "I'll take you over 
there."  See, that was for -- that was him then.  Tellin' 'em.  
An' I ain' -- pure, deep colored peoples tryin' -- I could kill 
every one of 'em!   I'm tellin' you the truth -- in my mind -- 
that [I hate bein'] had he been colored himself, an' knowin' he jus' look at 
a white woman, they take him [back] out an' get 'im.   ['Cause] 'Course 
he wouldn'a, 'cause he used to it up here (IN NEW YORK), ya see?  
But the others woulduv, you see?   An' I tell ya -- I found it out 
this way, so.   The Big Boy tol' me, said, [says] "Don't go."  
He says, "The sawyer," I said, "Tha's a fine lookin' man, I'm 
tellin' you!"  "An' he got his wife" -- says, "he got a Georgia wife." 
 Said,  ["He kn]  "She know that he likes colored women."  Said, "If 
she ever find out that he even met you tonight, right now," said, 
"She'll have a crew right here to run you away from here."
