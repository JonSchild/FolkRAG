Dear Alan:

I think it so important to
secure records of authentic cowboy
singing, the stories and hollers of
the not quite extinct Trail Drive
Cowboys that I have decided, in response
to your Air Mail letter:

1. To abandon work on the book
of My Adventures,
2. To wear out the tires on my
automobile,
3. To spend a month or six weeks
on what will probably be my last
trip (I'll have to go alone, since Miss
Terrill is looking after Pat and Susan)
for the Folk Song Archive,
over
