description of the conditions under which most of the Child
ballads were composed  - the earliest ballad documents led
no further back into the Middle Ages than the 13th century;
yet in the background of the ballads this type of composition 
certainly lay. Gummere, I think, was speaking of poetic 
origins, rather than ballad origins and he confused the
two rather badly Just as anthropologists of the period
were likely to take for granted the evidence of travelers
and amateurs, so ballad scholars, notably Gummere and Kittredge, 
used uncritically any evidence the anthropologists
had to offer. When one thinks of primitive one thinks of 
naked savages dancing a war dance around a huge fire, singing 
the death song of their enemies. Then, since the most
obvious feature of the primitive community at first sight
is its homogeneity as contrasted with the cultural heterogeniety 
of civilized society and since primitive art has
seemed by contrast more  a matter of community activity than
of genius and originality, the scholar who has had no experience 
with such people is likely to believe that primitive 
poetry is communally composed. Then, because of the
antiquity in Europe of certain well-known epics and sagas,
the interest of primitive people has been presumed to be
in story. Thus, out of these three unanalyzed notions Gummere 
produced in a shower of notes, references and other
