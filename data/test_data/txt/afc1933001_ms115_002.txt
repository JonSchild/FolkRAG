Dallas, Texas,
March 27, 1935

Mr Alan Lomax,
Dear Sir,
We hope that this will be some 
service to you.
This is the best we could do. We
have wrote it over and over so this is 
the contents.
We started it two different ways you
can fix it to suit you.
this is as much of that song as 
my mother could think of. You will find it 
on the end of one of these sheets of paper.
I am not just back to my self yet but 
I am thankful to be better.
Arthur M. Ledbetter
P. S. I hope it isn't too late.
