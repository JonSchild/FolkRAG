F. N. F

1.  A man once called up his doctor in such
an exciting way, which made [the] him 
think he or someone is his family was
seriously ill.  The doctor said, he would 
come over, as soon as he had time, but 
this man who called was so determined he
pleaded [so] to the extreme, the Dr. finally
said OK.  I'll come over right right away.
When the doctor arrived the man said,
"Please won't you give my horse a pill
so he can eat!  because he hasn't eaten
for four days."  Upon the disgust of the
doctor he turned away.

2.  Why did the little moron walk
across the street
Ans like anyone else to get on
the other side.

3.  The little moron went to a lumber
yard and found the Board of Education
after looking around he saw a man
standing and he said "Young man
come and follow me 'I'll show you
what board you should be looking.
The little amazing looking and followed 
without a word.   Finally they came
to a board which was the Draft Board.
The moron said if I had stuck to
the Board of Education I never would 
have walked into the Draft Board.
