it.  Boy, I'd set down an' string it.  I liked to string it, ya 
know?  Then, then hang it up on a long strings of red peppers. 
TL:  Did you dry it out?
BJ:  Aw, well, it's already... We don't pick 'em 'till it's red, 
like that, completely red.  Then it's ripe.  An' then you hang it 
up an' it just stay there, see?  An' ah then, the next year, you can 
jus' take some an' shovel it out an' plant.  An' [they take that all season] then you - an' then 
also ya' can put it in your pocket an' you got your -- if you 
wants anything hot -- you got it right in there.  Put it in your greens 
or anything.  See?  Th-that's the dry red peppers.
     Then, the green red peppers, ya take it an' put it in vinegar, 
make pepper sauce.
TL:  You put 'em in what?
BJ:  Vinegar.  How you make pepper sauce.
