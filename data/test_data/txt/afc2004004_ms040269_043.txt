THE STANE'S AWA

Tune"-- The De'il's awa wi the Exciseman.

The Scots gaed doun to Westminster,
And danced awa wi the stane, man,
"Owerlang ye've bade in alien bield;
We're come to tak you hame, man.

Chorus.  The stane's awa, the stane's awa,
The stane's awa frae the aibbey;
And the Reverend Dean cam on the air,
And begoud to griet like a baby.

"To steal that stane is sacrilege.
The King's sair fashed aboot it;
The coronation cheyre, he thinks
Leuks geyan tuim athoot it."

The stane's awa, the stane's away.
The stane's awa up north, man.
It isna in the Serpentine,
It maun be in the Forth, man.

'A curse on him wha's stown my stane.
Be he yellow, white, or black man,
My aith I tak:  I'll never rest
Until I get it back, man.

The stan's awa, the stane's awa,
The stane's awa for ever.
Albeit he gang to the warls'd end
The Dean'll find it never.

The polis offices are thrang,
The telephones are bumman,
Wi road blocks on ilk norland gaet
Fowk think that was is come, man.

The stane's awa, the stane's awa,
The stane's back til its hame, man;
And still 'Hunt's Up' detectives cry.
I think they like the game, man.

They seek it here, they seek it there
Wi polis, spy and bellman,
But to this day they dinna ken
Gin it's in Heaven or Hell, man.
