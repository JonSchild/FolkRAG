Dear Dr. Lomax:
I am writing a rather belated acknowledgement of your letter of December 20, 
in which you gave instructions for the use of the duplicate recordings[.]
of parts of three of the Amish hymns.  I received the record and used it
in connection with my talk before the American Folk-Lore Society in New
York on December 30.  I thank you very much for your courtesy and assure
you that we will do all in our power to assist you in further recordings.
I am not sure, however, that any other recordings will be possible here in 
northern Indiana.  We may need to choose some other section.  I have not
entirely given up hope of doing further recording here, but it will be
necessary to overcome a considerable amount of reluctance if we shall be
able to do any more recording here.
I am sorry that the young cub who reported the last meeting of the
American Folk-Lore Society made so many mistakes.  It was quite inexcusable,
because at his request I had given him the manuscript copy of my address.
You may have noticed that he said that the recordings had been made by
 a Northwestern University student.  What I [had] said was that you had made 
the recordings and that a Northwestern University student was making an
intensive study of the hymns under expert guidance.  the Northwestern
University School of Music may write to you for copies of the records
which you have.  If so, I should be glad to have the records made available
to them.
I  [T]hank you again for your cooperation and courtesy and hope that we may
meet sometime and continue the recording of Amish hymns.
Very cordially yours,
John Umble
