SISTER, SISTER, IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE BEST
A church song

Umm, mm, my Lord,
Oh, sister, sister, if your heart is wrong,
You better leave God's wine alone,
Umm, mm, oh, my Lord,
Oh, brother, brother, if your heart is wrong,
You better leave Godâ€™s wine alone,
Um, mm, ah, oh, my Lord
Oh, preacher, preacher, if you know what's the best,
You'll tote God's witness in your breath,
Umm, mm, my Lord,
Oh, Lordy, ummmm, my Lord, umm,
Well, if your brother treat you wrong,
Take it to yourself an' God alone,
Umm, my Lord,
'Cause, sister, sister, if you know what's best,
You'll tote God's witness in your breath,
Umm, Lord, umm, my Lord,
Umm, Lord, umm, my Lord.
