The Royal Forester: John Strachan (2.50)
1) I am the forester o' this land as ye may plainly see,

With my ru-rum-ra-da-dee, ri-rum-ra-da-dee,

He's laid her doon upon her back and asked no man's leave.

And since you've ta'en your wills of me, you'll tell to me your name.

But when I'm in the king's high court, the William is my name.

But afore he had his horse well-watered she was at the other side.
