This is the hammer killed John Henry...Fisk 17.2...
This is the hammer
Killed John Henry.
Laid him low,
Laid him low. (2ce)
Take this hammer,
To the captain
Tell him he's gone,
Tell him he's gone. (2ce)
When you hear that
Bull-dog a-barkin,
Somebody roun,
Somebody roun. (2ce)
When you hear that 
Pea-fowl a-hollerin, .
G'ina rain,
G'ina rain. (2ce)
I don't like no
Right black woman,
Black myself,
Black myself.
You cain read,
You cain write,
You cain eat no supper tonight.
You cain eat
You cain stay
On the eighth of Januway.
You cain read
You cain write,
You cain eat no supper tonight.
You cain eat,
You cain shine, 
You cain talk to the gal of mine.
a few verses of Carrier Railroad...
Last, one Monday mornin
It come a shower of rain
9 come to Ballantine
Goin like a fast train.
When 9 got over to Sardis
Wid a large load of logs,
Mr. Carrier told the people at the plant
It look like the Yellow Dog
