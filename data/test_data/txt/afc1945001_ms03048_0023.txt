A. Rumors of Allies
1. An American sailor, supposed to have witnessed a sea
battle between the English and German naval forces, said the English [*2*]
had an opportunity to "blow up the entire German submarine fleet,"
but were ordered to retreat, instead.
Philadelphia--8/5/42. Character - good. Intelligence - average.
2. The English are willing to open a second front until a U.S. [*2*]
Army of 1,000,000 men get over there, so that they don't have to [*4*]
use any of their own men.
Philadelphia--8/3/42. Character--questionable. Intelligence--
average.
3. I know it to be a fact, because a soldier who is stationed [*1*]
in England wrote to his Mother, and she told me, that her boy wrote
to her, that the English don't even talk to our boys, and snub them
every chance they get. [*2*]
Harrisburg--8/4/42. Character--good. Intelligence--average.
4. The G-- D--- English never were any good. They are still [*2*]
for themselves and themselves only. Wait and see, they'll sell out
the United States just as they did in the last war. Why even their
own people don't trust their leaders. A British sailor told me that
there will be a revolution in England before there will be one in 
Germany.
Philadelphia--8/4/42. Character--questionable. Apparent class--
middle. Intelligence--average.
5. England don't want to open a second front until the United
States can supply the men and material necessary to open it.
Philadelphia--8/5/42. Apparent class--laboring, Intelligence--
average. Character--?
