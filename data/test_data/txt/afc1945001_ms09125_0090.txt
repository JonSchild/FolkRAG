A Friend in Camp.

I have a friend who has a friend
in camp in Virginia. He is a man 
in his middle fourties.
It was stated one time that all
men over thirty eight would be
exempted from the Army. This
man who hoped that he would be
exempted wrote his friend that
all of the younger men were calling
him "Dad."  but he didn't mind that,
and that those long hikes were really
hard on his feet.  He said that Uncle
Sam didn't want him any way,
because he was too old, and Uncle
Sam wasn't going to keep him on
the pay roll doing nothing, so he
hoped to be home soon.
