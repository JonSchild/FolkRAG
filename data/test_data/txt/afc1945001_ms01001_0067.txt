insufficient news, seems to be of greatest importance.
Perhaps the most important finding was the evidence which tended
to contradict the notion that rumors are found in greatest abundance
among the ignorant. The lower the informational level of the person
interviewed, the fewer were the rumors reported by the interviewer.
Sixty-three percent of the well-informed people, in contrast to only
twenty-five percent of the [fully] poorly informed, mentioned over six rumors.
An analysis of the educational background of the persons interviewed
revealed the same tendency. Those who had high-school backgrounds were
more prolific in rumors than those who had never attended high-school,
and college-trained people repeated more rumors than those who had never
attended college. People under emotional tension tend to repeat more
rumors than phlegmatic individuals. Three out of five people rated as
tense reported more than seven rumors as compared with two out of five
among those who were not tense who repeated this number. People who
participate widely in society report more rumors than those who are
socially isolated. Sixty percent of the "sociable" people reported more
than six rumors, in contrast to only twenty-eight percent of the isolated
group.
Men, contrary to preconceptions, seem to tell more rumors than
women, though we cannot consider this a necessary sex difference, for
employed women circulate many more rumors than do housewives. This
difference, too, is probably related to the informational status of a
person. 
Concerning situational determinanc[e]ts, let us consider the case

of Propaganda Research in the Massachusetts Committee of Public Safety:
