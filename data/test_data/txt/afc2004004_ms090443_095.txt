learn that.

So Houston Brady, he was the 2nd cook, and Houston got sick, real sick.
He had to move, he was so ill. You don't run across that from what we
have now, Brown's affliction, they called it. And she put me back in the
kitchen as [second]-cook and she moved Alan Collins up to Houston's place
as the second cook and she made me _______ cook. I went back there
and I was young but I was a big man for my age. I was sitting back there
and I learned everything. Then I staryed to making light bread, ________,
cold bisquits, corn_________, cutting meat up in it and putting raisins 
in it and putting dried peaches in it, and I named it Dudalo Joes, that's
what I named it.

They would have a great big pan of it and the men came in and I'd
have a pan of it sitting on this end of the table and a pan on that end of
the table and they'd go and get that up. Some of them liked it and some of
them didn't so they made a song about it. That this is what I want everybody

WB: O yeah, my great-great-grandmother. She was named Moreia Davis. I
believe she was born in Transylvania, Louisianna, but she lived to get 121 
and when she was 101 she picked about the cotton. She had one tooth in the
front and she cleaned a bone cleaner than I can with twenty now. She used
to get out on the field and she started to picking cotton and she'd break off
a cottin stalk and poke our hands, and take it whup one hand and then she'd
take it and whup the other hand.
