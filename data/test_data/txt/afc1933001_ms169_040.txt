Dear Bill:
It's easy to be polite (except with Lomax),
when you are an executive of a big corporation.
PERIOD, PARAGRAPH.  Anyhow, suppose I was hasty, 
I' sorry.  Anyhow, suppose CBS was slow sending 
me my checks (you ought to be sorry).  I asked 
the lady at the dispersing office to please send 
me a records of the checks paid me, covering my 
last four programs.  I feel sure I was not paid 
for one of the and I never received my check for
the banquet.  I'd appreciate, dear, kind Bill, if 
you'd get me this information and them checks.
Next address, until May 10, 7456 San Benito Way,
Dallas, Texas.  After that I think I'm going to 
Mexico.  I hope you have a nice time on your vacation

Much love,
Alan
