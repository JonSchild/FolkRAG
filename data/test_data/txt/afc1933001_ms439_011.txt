He had two chillun there--- a lil' boy an' a li'l' girl-----

the woman run an' got her daughter an' says, "Daughter, play me
a piece on the piano."--- the li'l' girl sit down an' 'gin to
whip it to a gravy------

(piano)

"Lawd, have mercy on me,
Oh, Lawd, Lawd, have mercy on me,
, have on me."
Oh, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd

he sit an' 'gin to think about when he was cou'tin' her-----

Ask you to love me, you swo' you didn' know how,
Ask you to love me, you swo you didn' know how,
Showed you my money, loved me like a farmer loved a Jersey cow.
