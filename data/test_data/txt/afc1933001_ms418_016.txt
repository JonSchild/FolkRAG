(No Title)

Tune: Washington and Lee Swing

When these shirt factory girls falls into line,
We're goin' to win this strike another time,
For you see we're just so full of pep,
That we're surely gonna to hold them altogether,
And we'll fight fight fight for every score,
And we'll win them all and then some more,
And we'll roll the old bosses in the mud, in the mud
Rah, Rah, Rah.
