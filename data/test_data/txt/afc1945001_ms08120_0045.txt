Air Raid Warden: For incindiary bombs
You should have two buckets of sand
& a long hand shovel.
The Frustrated Housewife: But what if
it happens to be a high explosive bomb.
Warden: You won't need the
sand then.

The meanest man in the world
is the one who comes behing
you said the man working in
a high explosive factory making
bombs is the one that says
"boom!"

(E.C.)
