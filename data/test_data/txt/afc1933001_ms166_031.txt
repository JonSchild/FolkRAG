Dear Bill:
     Here is what I can do in the way of clearances for Tuesday's 
show:
     I. For the Ecuadorean Trio.
           A. Ecuadorean Songs
               1. A San Juanito
               2. A Jaravi
               3. A Pasillo
     These are tunes usually played on the Indian pan-pipes or
"Rondador" and are the commonest of dance forms in Ecuadorean region
of Ecuador. There are numbers of such tunes in print in collections,
but it is impossible to tell, which is which. All are 
called folk tunes.
               4. Gitanita, unpublished, according to singers, a 
                    pasillo, very lovely, with text and guitar accompaniament.
              5. Morenita, a San Juanito, said to be composed by
                   Paredos Herrera who has published two collections
                   of Ecuadorean songs called, "Album del Musica Nativa"
                   in collaboration with Luis Del Rio. These two
                   volumes were just published in Guayaquil, Ecuador.
          B. Chile.
               1. La Pollita, a cueca, which apprears, text only, on
                    page 166 or "Canciones Populares Chileans" by
                   A. A. Hernandez, San Diego, Chile, 1939, copyrighted
                    by Editorial Ercilla.
               2. Prenda Querida, a cueca, which I've not been able 
                   to find.
          C. Mexico.
               1. Jarabe tapatio, certainly PD, published, however, in
                   numerous books, among them, "El Folklore Y la Musica
                   Mexicana" by Ruben M. Campos, Publicaciones de la
                   Secretaria de Educacion Publica Talleres Graficos
                   de la Nacion, Mexico, 1928.
              2. Puercito Gardo, which I'm sure is a folksong. We
                  have oner version of it in the Archive. It is a 
                  particularly good
