Sept. 10 . This morning
Capt. Trueblood could 
remember no more songs.
Archie Paquin was feeling
[too important] overawed
by the impressiveness of 
brother Joe's funeral and
would not sing â€” not death 
of his brother, but the arrival
of relatives from Detroit +
Chicago and the number of 
cars in the cortege had 
caused him to pause +
ponder on the brevity of
human life or something.
