I been hit several times.
(Who hit you?)
Oh, the party that I'd be in it wid sometimes. I didn't 
nevah bothah nobody less somebody bothahed me. Mmm-mmm. I love 
peace. I love to live in friendship. I'd do anything in the worl 
jis to have peace. . . It's been so long that I couldn't hardly tell 
you jes what did happen. But everytime I don sumpin, I 
done it because I had to. Then I'd hate it. . . Never have fought ovah 
[a woman] no word said to no man bout a woman. Uh-huh.  No. While me 
an a man fussin ovah a woman, I could be gittin me a dozen or 
t wo. I thank that's nonsense. Me an a man nevah fought about a 
woman. . . I'd rather have a squabble wid anyone bout anything else
outside a woman. I ain't gon have no squabble wid anybody else bout 
anything. Some people is always pickin. Thass all the sense they 
have.  Yeah. . . The devil is in em, that's what. Want somebody to kill 
em, I reckon. You know, some people gits tared o livin. Th at's what 
I say, want somebody to kill em. Thass right.
(Did you know anyone like that?)
You ought not to ast that. You know a plenty people 
like that. (he laughs)  Yes, I know plenty people like that. Plenty. 
Plenty people. I been mongst people you couldn't git long wid 
em if you treat em right. You couldn't git long wid em no way.
(Did you ever know one very well?)
No. I didn't care to know em. I find out a person's 
hard to git long wid, thass much as I want to know bout em. I jis 
gits right way from round em. I don't have nothin to do with em. 
Thass right. I don't stick up wid anybody either. Thass reason you 
see me all the time by myself. Since I been comin down heah, you always 
see me by myself. I don't have nobody wid me.
