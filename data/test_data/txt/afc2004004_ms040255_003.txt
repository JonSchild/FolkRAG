Dear Mr. Lomax,
Thank you indeed for acknowledging 
my letter.
I have learnt of these six
unusual songs sung by the
Romany, no doubt he has others
in his repertoire, but it's difficult
to extract them at one questioning
- discreetly carried out. 
If these are not sufficient for you
to consider, I could have another
session.
Yours truly,
D.M. Piper
