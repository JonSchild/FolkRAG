Memo to Dr. Harold Spivack, Chief of Music Division
from Alan, Lomax, Archive of American Folk Song.

     I wish to recommend that the Department of
Interior Radio Broadcasting Division duplicate for
current work in the Archive of American Folk Song
   archive discs. Two of these are from the recent
Vermont recording trip and since Miss Flanders expects
(see accompanying memo) duplicates of this material,
I recommend that double duplicates he made for these
two records. The total number of blanks requested 
will be and this number is available from the stock
left over from the Vermont recording trip.
