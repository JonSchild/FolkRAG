Stryker sent you her program of 
the "Deep South in Song and story."
She also sent one of Mrs Jeanette 
[Wag??] Arguedas, While my 
daughter is in the south they combine 
the program.

Mrs. Arguedas is unique in her 
interpretations of the Creole Plantation 
life of Louisiana and New Orleans.
I think she would be pleased to 
contribute one of her sones to 
your collection.    [?ut] the Creoles
interfection is so unusual so
unique that a song could only sound 
correct coming from a Creole.
She has a wealth of song that 
she know from her childhood.
