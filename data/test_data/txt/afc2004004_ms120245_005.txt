R. P. doesn't like the [loi?] to come in his head. When
the [loi?] begin to come in your head you can always tell
it because your head seems to go up toward the sky and
if you got sense enough to go away from the dance
& sit until that sing is over you can estop it. You
can't exactly stop it, [but] because the [loi?] can kill
you.
