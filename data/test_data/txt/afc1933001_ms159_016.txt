My dear Mr. Lomax:

Many thanks for your letter enclosing copy for the circular. It looked swell.
I have gone over it keeping in mind the publicity that has gone out from CBS.
As there was some good stuff that was used during the "School of the Air" broadcasts
last year I have incorporated some of it in the enclosed description.

The copy enclosed is just a suggestion. What do you think of it?

If you could get it right back to me with your corrections and suggestions
we can shoot it right out to the printer.

I have gotten an estimate from our printer who has done some excellent work.
It is as follows:

2,000, on a single sheet, printed both sides on 80# coated stock. Size 8 1/2" x
11" with one halftone 6 1/2" x 8 1/4" ------- $60.50. The New York City Sales Tax is, of
course, additional.

In going over the copy I would appreciate your looking at it rather critically
as there is a labor charge for any changes from proof once the type is set. After
looking over the attached please let me know if you feel that you would like to see
proofs or if we can handle it from that point on.

I am delighted that this is going through now and am looking forward to getting
this copy back from you with your comments.

Sincerely yours,
Richard Erstein
