toted it.  And stacked it.  And stacked it.  And such as tractor
tracks and whole cows for food and different things.  Me an
one man.
A.L. :
Show us how you did it.
W.B. :
Me an one man! (stands up)  He had it on one end
and I had it on the other and we used to do like that (rocks
back and forth).  The (store?) used to call us his bulls.  We
used to get it like that.  Goin down the gang-plank, goin
over the water.  And we'd get out there and we'd stagger like
that, you know, like we gonna fall with it?
And just keep on rockin, man! (laughs)
A.L. :
What did you rock for?
W.B. :
Well, it make it light.
B. Gordon:
It seem like your rhythm make it more light on
ya.
W.B. :
Make it light.  Then, ah. . you'd be -that'd be
the slide of it, you know.  When you do that rock to this
side, that'd lighten this side altogether and when you go
back, that'd lighten this side.  And you just stand there and
rock wit you.  Goin down the plank, you know -staggering.
Playin with it and goin on.
A.L. :
(laughs)  Ah. . that was the job of the 
roustabouts?
W.B. :
That was my job.  As a roustabout.
Man off-cam:
I'd almost fall over in there too.
W.B. :
Now, you know, like -the boat pull in, we
gonna tie in, we'd set out the (by-poles?), and we'd put
cables on the Johnson bar and wind it in and tighten it up
for to hold the boat, keep the boat from goin in an out, you
know?
A.L. :
And you'd have to load fast so the boat could
get off.
