To the Acting-Chief of the Music Division:

At your suggestion I have prepared an outline of a possible recording
trip to Kentucky.

Kentuckians divide their state into four more or less well defined regions
with north and south dividing lines. From East to West these are:
the Mountain, the Blue Grass, the Knob and the Penny Royal areas. The regions
I have in mind for the project survey is the first of the group,
the mountain country, which comprises approximately thirty-seven counties in
the Allegheny-Cumberland mountain belt. It would be sanguine to expect to
complete the collecting work in this area in two months, but, on the other
hand, it would be dangerous, in any matter as chancy as the collection of
folk-songs where Acts of God, bad roads and bed tempers so often intervene,
to restrict oneself to too small an area. Indeed all I suggest is that after
two months, the Library may feel that its Kentucky mountain collection provides
an adequate notion of folk music in that region.

I hope I shall be able to leave Washington for Kentucky by the first 
part of September because later on the weather may seriously impede travel
and make impossible outdoor recording of dances and baptizings. There is
another and more important reason, however. Professor Barnicle, of New York
University, plans to work in that region during September and she has offered
to accompany me and to introduce me to the singers she has discovered in
three or four summers of collecting in Harlan, Pine and Bell Counties. As you
know, Mr. Harvey H. Fuson of Harlan asked us to send someone to make records
of the singers he has located, but i should like to complete this job, if
possible, before Miss Barnicle comes down from New York and be free to work
with her, and have the benefit of her rare understanding of the problems and
techniques of field recording of folk-songs in this particular territory.
When she leaves Kentucky I shall be part of the family there and will have
friends of her friends in every community I later visit. I therefore urge that, if possible, the trip begin in the first week of September.

The shortest and best road to Harlan enters the Shenandoah Valley at New
Market, Virginia, and runs straightaway southwest through Staunton and
Roanoke to Bristol. Then one heads up into the mountains through Gate City
to Pennington Gap, and on county roads over the Big Black Mountains into
Harlan. There one is in the heart of the mountains that have protected for
generations a rich heritage of Elizabethan song, manner and speech, and at the
same time have hidden the veins of coal that are leading to the disappearance
of this tradition. And so one finds in Harlan and nearby communities the
