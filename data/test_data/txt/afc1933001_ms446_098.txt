6 

I long to see my Savior when I lay this armor down, 
I'll start my life with Jesus with a brand new harp
and crown, 
I'll walk the streets of glory, I'll sing and shout and
shine, 
I'll be at the marriage supper, when the Lod says,
Come and dine. 

No. 6     I'm Living the Right Life Now

The midnight is past, it's morning at last, 
No longer in fear I'll bow; 
For wanderings are done, my life's crown is  won. 
I'm living the right life now. 

CHORUS 

Oh, glory to God, I'm washed in His blood,
His lovelight is on my brow; 
I'm happy and whole, there's peace in my soul; 
I'm living the right now. 

2 

The pleasures of sin that beckon within, 
No longer can charm my soul; 
For pleasures I find His Spirit is mine, 
Since Jesus has made me whole. 

3 

No burdens I'll bear, my pathway is clear, 
And Jesus is at my side; 
His story I'll tell, His praises I'll swell,
I'm living the right life now. 

4 

O sinners astray, seek Jesus today,
The right life is far the best;
