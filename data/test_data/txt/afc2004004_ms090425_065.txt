Fisk, 22. 2.

W: I learned how to read a little bit. I went to school a little bit.
Uh-uh.
A: How much school did you get?
W: Oh, I went to school just about the second grade. I went to school
about the second grade. Then again, I sent my children to school and
I learned with my children when they got it. My children all went to
school-- I sent them all to school. And what they learned in the books
they learned me. I learned all the songs in the book for children.
I didn't know um when I was a child because my mom and dad
didn't know to learn me. They didn't know any songs to learn me but
just the most common songs they did-- they taught um. They couldn't 
read none of them. They just taught um.
A: Your parents were singing both the old Jubilee songs and the Dr.
Watts songs?
W: They were singing the old Jubilee songs and the old Haley songs
and Dr. Watts. I never did hear um say nothing about the Dr. Watts
along in there. They didn't know nothing about Dr. Watts then. They
just knew what to say about Dr. Watts. They knowed he made the
"Grace" and "How Things Sound." I don't know where they got that
from. "Lay Down My Bundle, Going to Die," "There's a Fountain
Filled with Blood." -- And like that. Now I don't know where they
got that but I know they did.

Rock Daniels Discussion.

Oh, I know "Rock Daniel." There was somebody and she saing "Rock
Daniel" And I knowed that, too. 
A: What kind of song was that?
W: It was a rocking song. That people would just sit up there and
rock. We'd git on the feet, you know, and rock--

Lord, Lord, Lord
Rock Daniel.
