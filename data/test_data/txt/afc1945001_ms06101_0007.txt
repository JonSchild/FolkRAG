5.  On Wednesday, August 5, and on Friday, August 7,  women shoppers
in two grocery stores were heard discussing what they characterized as
"shameful waste" of food at Fort Jackson.  One woman of middle-age who
was buying meat on August 5 said a friend of hers working at Fort Jackson
had told her that he had seen practically a whole leg of lamb thrown 
away on a recent Sunday because so many soldiers in the outfit were on
pass and those remaining for dinner were unable to consume all the lamb
placed before them.
