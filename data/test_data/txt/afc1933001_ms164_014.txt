ROYAL GREEK LEGATION
WASHINGTON

December 10, 1940.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This war has kept us so busy working
here at the Legation - 10, 12 and sometimes more
hours - that I have not called you to ask if you
still wanted me to hear the records about which we
had spoken some weeks ago. You see, I was waiting
for the work to let up a little, so that I could
know what afternoon I would be free.

As things still are, I usually have
to work Saturdays and Sundays, too. I was wonder-
ing, Mr. Lomax, if you still want to complete your
work on the Greek records, if it would inconvenience
you to do this work some evening - say, a little
after seven o'clock. I could arrange to have my
brother pick me up and bring me to the Library, and
if he wouldn't be in the way, he being a musician,
he could help, too.

I am writing all this in a way of
explanation, for I didn't want you to think that I
had forgotten about the work.

With my best wishes for the holidays,

Sincerely,
Denise Chobas.
