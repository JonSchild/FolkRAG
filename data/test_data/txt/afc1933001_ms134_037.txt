Recording trip
Beaver, Pa

June 15, 1938.

Memo to Dr. Spivacke,
In Re: Trip for Archive of American Folk Song,
June 18, 19 and 20.

I have been asked by the Bryn Mawr Summer Labor
College to lecture there Saturday, the 18th and Sunday, the
19th and to record whatever folk songs the students who have
come from all over the country know. The College is willing
to pay my mileage or railroad fare there and return.
See Enclosure No. 1.

The Pennsylvania Folk Festival will be held on
Saturday, the 18th, at Beaver, Pennsylvania. Although we 
have been invited in the past, as yet no person on the
Archive staff has attended this important folk festival;
and I feel it would be advisable, in view of the Archives's 
connection with the World's Fair and for other reasons,
for me to attend this gathering. See Enclosure No. 2.

Miss Kay Dealy of Philadelphia, Pennsylvanis,
has discovered an old lady nearby the city who has quite
a stock of traditional ballad tunes. I have seen the
manuscript of this collection and I feel it would be a
valuable acquisition for the Archive. I have arranged
to do this recording on Monday, the 20th. See Enclosure
No. 3.

For this reason, I should like to request per diem for these three days.
