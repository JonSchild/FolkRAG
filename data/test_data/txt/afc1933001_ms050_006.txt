Mr. Thomas Rutherford
Galax, Virginia

Dear Mr. Rutherford:

Upon his return from Galax, Mr. John Lomax told me of your
great kindness in allowing him to set up the Library's recording
machine in your home. I believe that Mr. Lomax has already written
you but I want to add the thanks of the Division of Music.
We are indeed grateful to Mrs. Rutherford and yourself for your
cooperation in helping us to assemble a truly representative collection
of American folk-songs.

Very truly yours,

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
