Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have been almost as negligent in fulfilling John Hammond's 
request to write to you as John himself was apparently in 
his correspondence during the summer. I am terribly sorry 
and I hope you will forgive me because I have been so 
dreadfully occupied in the few months I have been here.

John has sketched in only lightly the project in which 
you are interested. I am therefore in a position of working 
somewhat in the dark even though I feel quite sure 
from what John has told me and from what I know of you 
by reputation that we ought to get together, I think the 
best way for immediately untying some of the knots is 
that you and I sit down together at lunch or wherever 
you please and talk the whole matter out. It can't be 
in Washington as you suggest, I am afraid, for I don't 
know how long.  John tells me, however, that you come in 
to New York more or less periodically. Will you be good 
enough to let me know in advance of your next trip here 
and leave time for a conversation with me.

With my bests wishes and in anticipation of a note from 
you, I remain

Sincerely yours,
Moses Smith
