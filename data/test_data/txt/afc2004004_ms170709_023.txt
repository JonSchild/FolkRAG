Yeah. He died in December. We had the Memorial Concert in January 1950. 
But I jes don't see how he stood it that long. Onliest thing that worried
me much as it did was cause I jes couldn't tell him things. You know...
I [] mean that's the onliest thing I ever had to keep hid from him. The 
doctors tole me, say, Don't ever tell him, keep tellin him he'll be all
right. Huddie asked me, he said, "Do you think the [babie] doctors know what
they're [] talkin about, Baby?["] They keep tellin me I'll be all right. Look
like to me I'm gittin worse." I said, "Well yeah Baby, you'll be all right.
[You jes] It jes takes time. The doctor tell you it takes time."
