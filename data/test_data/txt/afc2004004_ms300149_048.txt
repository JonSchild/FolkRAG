Dear Lucille,
I was very sorry to get your news about the death
of Mattie Gardner. I think it is only fair
that we split the $5.21, which was her advance 
payment for the two songs on the records,
among those of you who sang with her: Yourself, 
Denise Gardner, Ida Mae Townes and
Jessie L. Pratcher. I have enclosed your 
check in the amount of $1.30 and am send-
ing out the others today, with copies of
this letter.
With all best regards,
Alan Lomax
