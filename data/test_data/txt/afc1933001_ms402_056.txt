Now and then he gives his classes of sinners, telling each

that he has got to die:

Sinner you jes as well get ready, you got to die
Maybe today or tomorrow
You can't tell the moment or the hour
Sinner you jes' as well get ready, you got to die

Then follows a list of the different sinners who have all

got to die:

hypocrite
mourner
schemer
crapshooter
backbiter
Liar
hick-a-teak
chief thief
watermelon swiper

The following song is a good example of the unlettered Negro's

ability to translate a Bible story into words that appeal to his

hearers:

Hock! Who dat knockin' at de gate?
Who dat dayin' "Is I too late?"
Wid pocket em'ty, heart so full,
De prodigul, de prodigul!

Chorus

Den kill de fatted pig an' calf
Whitewash dem cakes an' make him laugh,
dat hongry prodigul.

He 'socked his father an' his frien's,
An' wannered far away fum hence,
He was's his sumptious dressin' fine,
Livin' high an' drinkin' wine

(Chorus)

But when de famine strike de lan'
An' honger bowed him to de san',
He wrested wid his onbelief
An' fulled his mine wid many grief.

(Chorus)

His las' dime's gone, his suptions spent,
Wid empty heart he now repent
De bongs of sin has hilt him fas'
But now he's scaped away at las'.

(Chorus)
