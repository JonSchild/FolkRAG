My dear Mr. Drumm: 

Thank you for your letter of March 
2nd, dealing with a manual in connection with 
the prevention of the spread of rumors. 

As I advised you in my letter of 
February 25th, a Committee has already been 
studying this problem. Mr. Cornelius Dubois 
of the Office of Facts and Figures, Library 
of Congress, Annex, is in general charge of 
this inquiry and your communications in this 
respect should be addressed to him. I am 
forwarding your March 2nd letter for his 
consideration. 

Very truly yours, 

William L. Langer 
Director of Research
