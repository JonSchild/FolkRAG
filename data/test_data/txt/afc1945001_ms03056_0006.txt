RUMOR: Richmond, Virginia
August 12
A submarine is supposed to have come into Chesapeake Bay at
the same time that the net was opened to let in a big freighter.
The net, therefore, was closed for three days during which period
of time the Navy succeeded in finding the submarine. The ferry did
not operate during this time because they were afraid to open the
net in fear that the submarine might escape.
