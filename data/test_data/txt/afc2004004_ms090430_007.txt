washed away, we may, in a small measure, envision the prospect that faced the citizens of that day.
          In 1867, the Old General Levee Board of 1858 was revived for the purpose of liquidating the debt created by that board in 1859. It is worthy of note that while many hundreds of thousands of acres of the district's lands had been forfeited for taxes, all the liquidating levee board debt was ultimately paid.
          In 1871, the district number one levee board embracing our immediate territory was organized. This dis-trict operated with little or no success because of paucity of funds and extravagance and inefficiency of management the taxes were squandered and no work of value was done.
          After the attempt of 1871 had proven a failure, the people of the district determined to make another effort. At that time there were at least one and one-half million acres of land, or more than half the area of the district, that had been sold for levee taxes. In spite of all these difficulties, the present levee board was created by Act of the Legislature on February 28th, 1884.
          The district created under this act embraced all of the counties of Tunica, Coahoma, Quitman and Sunflower and that portion of DeSoto, Tallahatchie, LeFlore and Yazoo, lying west of the high water mark of the Mississippi River Flood of 1882 at or near the foot of the hills making said high water mark the eastern boundary of said levee district.
