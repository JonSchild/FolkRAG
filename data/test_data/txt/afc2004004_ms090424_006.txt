Let's Go Loopty loop  (three times)
On[e] one Satdy night (Chorus)

I put my right hand out, I take my right hand in, 
I give my right hand a shake, shake, shake, and 
turn myself around.  Chorus

I put my left hand out,
I put my right foot out,
I put my left foot out,
I put my big head out,

Teacher has to get out on the campus and play with the folks.  When 
I was going to scholl, the teachers didn't play, but they havet o 
get out now and play.  The change of attitude towards play, I 
feel, is responsible for that.  Children now-a-days have more 
grown up minds.

Will get a ten per cent raise in salary this year.  Has contributed
thru Mrs. Rogers to fund for lobbying for equal pay.

Has charge of the Glee Club.  Folk songs, Negro spirituals,
(Has sung with Mr. Mangham in Imperial Harmony Club)
Plantation Melodies as Stephen Foster Songs. The children
enjoy the Gospel Songs, however, most of all.

In Lyons, Mrs. Mattie Chambers teaches piano.

The school has no piano or instrument. Hope to this year.
