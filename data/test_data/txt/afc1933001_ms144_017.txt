Dear Mr. Lomax:

The General Accounting Office has returned to

for $1.74, from the Western Union Telegraph Company, 
for certain messages sent during the period September 
2 to 28, 1938, between Michigan and Washington, 
D. C, with the notation, - "Messages appear to be of a 
personal nature and charges therefore should be 
collected from the interested party at the commercial 
rates plus tax and handled in accordance with provisions 
of General Regulations No. 40, Supplements 2 
and 3."*

A copy of the preaudit difference statement

With best wishes.

Very truly yours,
