Tape: 1312 cont. Octa and Dion  2
AL:  I notice that most of the good singers in Cajun country
sing way up high, I like that, why is that?
Dion:  Well, years ago, there was no microphone, you had
to sing very loud so the people could hear it.  So just
like Mr. Clark, that's the way he learned, no kind of amplifier
or nothing.  So the people could hear you, you had to sing
very loud, and high.
AL:  And a high pitch to make it go far.
Octa:  It depend on the ladder of the accordion.  The C, D--
the C is low, the D is high.  And I play on the D, so I got
to sing high.  And the C, you got to sing low, that's the 
difference.
AL:  I'm a high singer, too, and I like the way it makes you
feel.  You like the high sound?
Octa:  Yeah, I like it.  It strains you a little bit, but
you get used to it.
AL:  Does it make the people sad or does it make them excited
Octa:  It makes them excited, when they hear that singing high
it builds them up a little bit.
AL:  Now there's one  thing in Cajun music that I hear no where
else at all and that's the hoot, that kind of holler, I love
it.
Dion:  That's the way it's been all since I'm young, since
I started the dances, that little hoot, it's like to wake up
the people, otherwise, they go to sleep on you, but you give
them that little hoot and wake them up.
