THAT OLD FEELING

I went to bed last night,
I had that old feeling.
My sup er was so light
I had that feeling.
I got up this morning
With that old feeling.
I was so hungry I was rocking and reeling
[I was ?]
The workers children are crying
From that old feeling.
Some of them are dying
From that old feeling
The[t] capitalists is to blame
For this old feeling.
I tell you it's a shame [about]
[Tha]t About that old feeling.
We workers see the light
About that old feeling.
And we are going to fight
That old feeling.
The capitalists, they are fat, 
They don't have that old feeling.
The worker's stomachs are [fat] flat,
We have that old feeling
We 're all united too
Against that old feeling.
Mr. Capitalist, we are through
With that old feeling.
