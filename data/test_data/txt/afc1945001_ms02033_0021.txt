ANTI-BRITISH RUMORS
1.. Roosevelt and Churchill could end the war soon, but don't want to. Reason: They are making too much money with the munitions companies. Thus they don't take advantage of their opportunities. 
2.. The British "sold out" to the Germans at Tobruk.
3.. The British Navy is doing nothing, while all our Navy is convoying to England and Russia, thus exposing our coasts.
4.. Jim Crow cars are in operation in England and our troops are being segregated.
5-- England has returned the last shipment of our tanks because they have a faulty reverse gear.
6.. Allied reverses in Africa do not permit the opening of a second front.
7.. The British are holding back, waiting for us to do their fighting.
8.. The British are not sincere in their pledge to aid Russia.
9.. The Germans are sending peace offers to the British through Turkey.
10.. The British are shipping us shoes made of lend-lease leather.
11.. England will wait until we have troops and equipment to open a second front. The British always have to be shown how to fight.
12.. English military leadership is totally incompetent.
13.. England is leading the U.S. by the nose.
14.. We are letting the Chinese and Russians down. The English in particular are anxious to sell Russia down the river.
15.. Meat will be very stringently rationed in the near future because we will send most of it to our allies, notably the British.
16.. A ship with 50,000 tires aboard for England was sunk off the Cape.
17.. The U.S. and British will allow Germany to destroy Russia so that Russia will not have to be honored at the Peace Table.
