smiling, you know you was beat to death. She remembers
my grandmother. 117 when she died, you remember grandma
Becky Don't you. Her husband was a full blood Indian, old man
Mrtin. She could take a rock and hit a bull with it.She 
could throw a rock and hit with it...... Reckon that's where
I took mine from. I was for a while in my young days...I
didn't need a gun. I could take a rock and a tree like that, 
a squirrel could be in it. My boys would say "let's see you 
knock that out Daddy, let's see you knock  that squirrel out. 
I'd tell them to get me a round rock, get me one about 
the size of my fist.....and I'd knock him for about 5 foot. 
And old dog I had, she remembers this, a feller give me one,
a black one. I kept it tied up, kept for noticing my chickens. 
I thought I'd turn that thing loose, take him up on the hill 
to hunt..........a rabbit.....he went up that side, I went 
up this side. I seen some rocks and I got me a round rock, 
bout like my fist and I started to turn around to that chicken, 
I decided to get him right in there. He just sunk down, that 
chicken.........(some difficult lines) I could throw me 
a rock.
Mother: Yes, well sometimes. He did kill that dog, I think, 
with a rock....
Phyllis: This song, I learned from my mother, when I'd go to
the Church of God church. My dad was Baptist, my mother 
Church of God. So I'd do this in that church, and sing in 
lower keys in his church. (Phyllis and her mother sing)
