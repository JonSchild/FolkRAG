Washington, D. C. 

Gentlemen:  
 I had, repeated to me, a rumor heard in 
Huntington, West Virginia on August 3rd.  The 
report was being circulated around that area that 
colored soldiers were being sent into battle first.    [*5*]

The person who repeated this rumor to me 
said that she had heard it several times in 
Huntington.  [*202*] 

Very truly yours, 
Beatrice N. Crockett
