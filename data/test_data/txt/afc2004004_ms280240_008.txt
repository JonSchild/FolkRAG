TAPE 68. .MARGARET BARRY AND JEAN ROBERTSON.
She Moves Through the Fair: Margaret,
1) My young love said to me, "My mother won't mind,
And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind."
As she stepped away from me, and this she did say,
"It will not be long love till our wedding day."
2) As she stpped away from me and moved through the fair,
And fondly I watched her move here and move there.
And then she turned homeward with one star awake,
As the swan in the evening moves over the lake.
3) Last night she came to me, she came softly in,
So softly she came that her feet made no din,
Then she laid her hand on me, and this she did say,
"It will not be long, love, till our wedding day."

When My Apron Hung Low - Jeannie.
1) What a voice, what a voice, what a voice I hear,
For it's like the voice of my Willie dear.
For if I had wings like that swallow fly,
For I would clasp in the arms of my Billy boy.
2) When my apron it hung low,
 My true love followed me through frost and snow.
But now my apron it is tae my shin,
And he passes me by and he'll ne'er speer in.
3) It was up onto the white house brae,
That he called a strange girl to his knee.
And he tellt her a tale which he once told me.
4) O I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
O I wish, I was a maid again.
But a maid again I will never be,
Till a apple it grows on an orange tree.
5) O I wish, I wish that my babe was born,
And smiling on some nurse's knee,
And for myself to be dead and gone,
And the long green grass growing over me.
6) But there's a blackbird sits on yon tree,
Some say it is blind and it canna see,
Some say it is blind and canna see,
And so if my true love to me.
