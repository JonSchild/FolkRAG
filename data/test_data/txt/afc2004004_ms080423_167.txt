AL:  You've probably got another one with a dulcimer . . .
(Do you want this bachelor one again?)
HP:  The bachelor one?  (sings)
AL:  Did you sing that to make fun of the men and make them feel
ashamed?
HP:  She just didn't like him because he's a bachelor.
AL:  You wouldn't have liked him if he'd been married, would you?
HP:  No, but you take a bachelor and they've got their way of
goin' and they wouldn't get along with you (?)  You take a bachelor
. . .         got their way of livin' and it would be hard to turn to
live like the woman . . .
FP:  Keeps on bein' a bachelor . . .
HP:  If you want me I could try to sing that . . .
AL:  What about lonely (?) wives.  You were talkin' about
how dangerous it was, you know--women actually got killed in their
love affairs in the mountains, didn't they?
HP:  . . .           them old songs, they was killed in them.
Come listen to my story,
I'll tell you no lie,
How John . . .
Led a lonely life.
Meet me, oh meet me
At Adam's sweet spring,
Some . . .               I'll bring you
Some other fine thing.
So foolish she met him
At Adam's sweet spring,
No money he brought her
No other fine thing.
Hop up behind me
And away we will ride

'Twas on a Thursday evening
And the rain was pourin' down
They searched for . . .         body
But it could not be found
