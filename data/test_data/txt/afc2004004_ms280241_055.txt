Rothesay:

1) Last Hogmanay in Glasga fair,
Me and mesel' and several mair,
All gaed off to hae a wee tear
And spend the night in Rothesay-o.
We started frae the broomilaw
Baith haeland sleet and rain and snow.
We got the length of Rothesay-o.
Chorus:
A-durrum-a-doo a-doo-a-day,
A dirrum-a-doo-a-daddy-o,
A dirrum-adoo-a-doo-a-day,
The night we went to Rothesay-o.

2) There was a lad called Ruglen Will
Whose regiment's lying at Barn Hill,
Gaed off wi' a tanner to get a gill,
Before we went to Rothesay-o. (Cho.)

3) Says he, "I think I'd like to sing,"
Says I? "Ye'll nae do sich a thing."
"O clear the room and I'll mak' a ring
And fecht them all in Rothesay-o." (Cho.)

4) In search of lodging we did slide
To get a place where we could bide,
There was eighty-twa of us inside
In a single room in Rothesay-o. (Cho.)

5) We all lay doon to get our ease
When smebody happened for to sneeze.
And they wakened half a million fleas
In a single room in Rothesay-o. (Cho.)

6) O noo says I, "We'll have to 'lope,
So we all went and joined the Band o' Hope,
But the police wouldn't let us stop
Another night in Rothesay-o. (cho.)


Mormond Braes:

1) It's I gaed doon by Strichen toon 
O I met a lassie mourning,
She was making sair compaint
For her true love nae returning.
Chorus:  Sae fare-ye-well ye Mormond Braes,
Oftimes I've been cheery,
O the hills where the heather grows,
'Twas there that I lost my dearie.
