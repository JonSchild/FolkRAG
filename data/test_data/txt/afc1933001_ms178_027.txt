Dear Mr. Coleman:
I would appreciate your returning my check to me at once. I am sorry, but I don't like the idea of you holding it over my head. As it happens, at the moment I am short of funds and simply can't settle the account for some time, but the check that was sent to you was sent with the full belief that there were funds to cover it.
If you, as my managers, are interested in continuing to be unpleasant about this matter, we can dissolve our relationship as of today. 
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
