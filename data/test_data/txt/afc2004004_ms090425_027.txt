Want you to be here by sun-up." Well I didn't have but two miles to go, and it didn't look like to me I would ever git there. -- the weight of the world was on me -- and I started out. And I met one of the plowmen on a mule -- he was riding -- and he looked at me, and he say, "You prayin, ain't you?" Say, "Yes." And he just moved off. Now let me tell you -- they say, "Oh, that's all foolishness." Of course, it may be all foolishness to you, but it not foolishness to me. I couldn't drink water. I couldn't eat. I couldn't rest anywhere I went. And that Saturday night I went to the church and that prayer meeting there was just two or three brothers there when I got there. And they said, "Here's one more -- We're gonna start." And they started and I got to saying, "Lord, have mercy," and when I found myself, I said, "Thank God, Thank God."

And I want to tell you all I didn't stop -- everywhere I go I wanted everybody to know it. I went down to everywhere, and that was the greatest and the happiest time ever I felt in all my life. My feet felt new. The light shined brighrer. The people looked better. And it just looked like to me I could throw my arms around it and carry all to heaven.
