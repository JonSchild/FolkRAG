in a cloud. Slept in bed with
Robin every night. And she never
made love to me. It hurt very
deep. Wept like I did at mother's
funeral when she went away out
of Victoria station. Have worked
hard nice &, wondering why
I'm alive, am soon going to
Scotland.
If a tree don't fall on me --
God, I might be starving,
or old or blind or sick but
I couldn't be much lower.
