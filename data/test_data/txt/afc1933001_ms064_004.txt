with him. As a matter of fact,
I think Alan has reason to trust
you more than me. Please
know, also, that Alan has not
suggested that I write to you
about the matter, nor [to] about any
concern of yours and his.

When you can spare
the time I should enjoy
hearing about the progress and
improvements you are making
with the Archive and allied interests.
You and Mrs. Spivacke 
must know that you always will
have quarters waiting for you in
the House in the Woods.

Some of Alan's songs sound
well. Thus far I think the symphonic
arrangements exceedingly
poor.  Your friend, John A. Lomax
