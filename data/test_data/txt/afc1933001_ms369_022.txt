N.B. To anyone particularly interested in the problems 
presented and the tale told in this paper, I would particularly 
recommend Professor Hustvedt's book, which, while 
it winds about a little inconsequentially, winds no more so 
than the ballad controversy, itself.  It has a superb bibliography 
and a brilliant index.
