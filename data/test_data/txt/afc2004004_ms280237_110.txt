TAPE 94. A. COLWILL: MRS COSGRAVE:
Mary's a Mazar: A. COlwill:
1) Our Nan and I we made up our minds to gang and catch the train,
To gang to the town to buy some clothes for poor little Billy and Jane,
When we got to Roland's gate the morning train had gone,
There wasna more to gang that way till fifteen minutes to one.
I said to our Nan it's a long way to gang
It'd save me a good deal of vex
But I says, "Never mind, we've plenty of time,
Stop and gang in wi' the next.
2) She gave a bit of a smile when I spoke up and said,
"There's a public house along there,
We'll just gang along, we'll have the one,
Have a glass of the best bottled beer."
Nan was so stout she couldn't walk, didn't seem silling to try,
When I think of the trouble I had that day I think I could burst out and cry.
Chorus: My Nanny's a mazar, a mazar she'll remain,
3) As long as I live I'll never forget the day we lost the train.
3) So off we went to the public house and when we got to the door,
She says, "We'll gang to the parlour end, I've never been there before."
In we went and took our seats, before I rang the bell,
I asked her what she was going to have - she said, "The same as yersel'."
I ordered two jugs of the best bitter beer, she paid for them when she come in,
Now when she had swallowed three parts of her beer, she said,
"Old man, I'd rather have gin."
I ordered a glass of the best orange gin, she walloped it off the first try,
I said, "By gum, Nan, thou's as good as a man,"
She said, "A poor man'd fell if he try."
I ordered another  that went the same way, I said, "That'll settle thy thirst."
She said, "To tell the truth, I fell no better now than I did when I swallowed the first.
4) O she sat and she drank till she got tight,
She says, "I feel very queer."
"Seeing as thou's had nine glasses of gin, to my three gills of beer."
She losed her hat and then her coat and tossed them onto the floor,
I thought she was going to go out of her mind, so I set myself close to the door.
She says, "If you go, I'll sing a bit song."
I stood and I glowered at all,
I thought she was joking for I'd never heard
