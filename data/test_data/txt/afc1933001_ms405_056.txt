ADVENTURES
BLOOMINGTON AND LOS ANGELES

During that year, at home in Austin, Texas, I had been busy
preparing an ex-student catalogue of the University of Texas, sixty
thousand names. I dug my knuckles into my eyes to assist concentration
and attempted to resurrect the names of those "Texas-Exes" who had drifted
to San Francisco. One of these might help. Suddenly, like a ray of
sunlight through a rift in a cloud, flashed one name - Cy McLaughlin.
I hadn't seen Cy for twenty-five years or more. As I was getting
into the University of Texas, he was getting out - off to Columbia University
on a fellowship to study geology. Men with money had since come
to believe that Cy's knowledge of what was under the earth had a cash
value. Cy was now president of a big California Oil Company.
To Cy I went with my tale of woe. I'll never forget the kind
crinkle about his keen black eyes as he heard my story.
"I think I can fix it up," said Cy, as he reached for a telephone!
"Give me the General Manager of the Southern Pacific Freight Division."
"I want you to stop No. _ at Palo Alto next Friday night...
Friend and college mate from Texas... Speaking to Stanford students,
etc.". A slight pause. "Thank you," said Cy, as he hung up. "Everything
fixed up, Lomax," Cy announced, as I stammered wondering gratitude,
I had at last reached the place where sat the man who could punch a button
and make the wheels go around.
I said my little piece in Stanford in due time and was standing on
the platform watching the approaching headlight of the Los Angeles train
that in the tides of time had stopped for no man. As the train rushed by
it seemed endless - a solid quarter mile of sleeping cars headed South.
