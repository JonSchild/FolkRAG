Dear Alan: Replying to your air mail
letter of July 19:

1. I only, under the conditions you
describe, can mend the complaint
about letters - not send you so
many. Then you will have no
troublings of conscience. Some of my
concerns you have never answered;
for example, my request that you
visit David F. Houston, a letter from
you to Mrs. Winterbotham, etc., etc.

2. The enclosures you mentioned
weren't enclosed. Perhaps your economical
trend is developing.

3. As to the Folk Lore dates I
think  you had best tell me definitely
what is the earliest week-end
