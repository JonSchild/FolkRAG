9th Per.

I was on the "L" one day when
two sailors got on. One was telling
the other about a nice girl he meet
last night and danced with untill
2:00 a.m. She asked him if he
would take her to a wedding the
next day, and he said he would.
(I think he was suppose to meet
her at 8:00 P.M. at an "L." station
on the westside), but he did;t arrive
at 8:00, insted he was sitting up in a
salon untill 9:00 P.M. When he
did get to the station the firl was
gone, and he wished he had keep his
word.
