1. Negro (Folk) Spirituals
The songs I give you I believe to be almost entirely the product of the Negro mind, operating as freely as is possible from the influence of the ideas and the conventional phraseology of the whites. In singing their best songs in the Negro congregation, the leader carries the burden of the work. Many times the Negro minister sings the theme of the song without help from the audience, their part of the exercise being a repetition of a single line wherein the imagery aids the entire picture. Of course the leader and the audience all join in the chorus.
This is a typical song:
Leader: "Tell me who dat had a rod?"
Chorus: "Mone, member, mone."
Leader: "Hit was Moses, child of God."
Chorus: "mone, member, mone."
The Leader, usually the preacher, will say:
Who hit dat mighty rock?
Congregation: "Mone, member, mone."
Moses, strike one, heaven clock!
Mone, member, Mone!
Struck it one, and struck it two,
Mone, member, mone!
Watch out, Moses, what you do-
Mone, member, mone!
Struck it three times, Ring-aring!
Mone, member, mone!
