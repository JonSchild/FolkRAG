Copy of letter mailed to
New York

April 8, 1940

Mr. Alan Lomax
Columbia Broadcasting System
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
By this time you have received the second letter, I hope, in which 
I said I had to choose your title for the preliminary program. There 
is still a chance to change this for the program proper which will be 
distributed at the Convention, so I shall send in "This Singing 
Country" as you suggested.

The Section will pay one hundred dollars, including expenses, according 
to your first telegram, but I am afraid we can't do much about additional 
talent unless you have some way of finding Cincinnati folk singers.  There 
is, of course, the Conservatory of Music and the University also has 
musical groups, but I'm not on the spot and have no knowledge of their resources. 
Do you have any way of making contacts there? We might stretch 
our budget to twenty five dollars more.

I do not yet know in what kind of auditorium your talk will be, but 
you will probably have an audience of about 500. Since there are two 
other speakers that afternoon, your time will probably be limited 
to an hour, which I regret.

Let me know whether you have any suggestions about someone to assist 
you, or whether you'd like us to investigate.

Is it best to address you The Library of Congress, or do you have any 
travelling addresses for April in case we need to speed up any arrangement?

Sincerely yours,
[Lesley Newton]
Lesley Newton
Chairman
