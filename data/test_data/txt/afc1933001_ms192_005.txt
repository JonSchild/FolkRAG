"Were you There"

Were you there when the invasion it began
I was there when the invasion it began
When the invasion it began and the ships came sailing in 
I was there when the invasion it began

Were you there when the guns and cannons began to roar
I was there when the guns and cannon began to roar
When the guns and cannon began to roar
God have mercy on that shore
I was there when the guns and cannon began to roar

Were you there when the planes they filled the sky
I was there when the planes they filled the sky
People were running here and there 
They were praying everywhere
 I was there when the planes they filled the sky

Were you there when the bombs came pouring down
I was there when the bombs came pouring down
When the bombs came pouring down
They were bursting all around
I was there when the bombs came pouring down

Were you there when old Hitler began to cry
I was there when old Hitler began to cry
When old Hitler began to cry
Saying loud we're going to die
I was there when old Hitler began to cry

Will you be there when the victory it is won
I want to be there until the victory it is won
When the victory it is won and we can all go sailing home
I want to be here until the victory it is won
