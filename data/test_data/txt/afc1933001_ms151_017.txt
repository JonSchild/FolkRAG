Dear Mr. Wetherald:
Father has written me that you two have
at last reached an agreement. I shall make the
suggested selections of records within the next
month and send you the list so that you can ship them
to him. But I would first like to have a look at the
other records that I picked out of the catalogue. If
you can get them to me sometime soon we can start
the ball rolling for father. Besides, I would certainly
find a few items in the group to include in my bibliography
which I must complete very shortly.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
