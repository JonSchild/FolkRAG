BLUES: - 41

NATCHEZ:(cont) hired a sheriff there, an'-uh so this sheriff were livin' in one

of Charlie Holman's uh-uh-places.. houses. He wouldn' pay Charlie

no rent; he was jus' stayin' there. An' so every time that Charlie

would ask him for.. some rent, he'd whip 'em.

SIB: Yeah.

NATCHEZ: So he happen to be, as they say, one of Charlie Hulen's Negros. So..

so Charlie Holman finally got up enough nerve to go tell Charlie Hulen.

So Charlie Hulen t-tells the police say, "Saturday evenin' at one

o'clock, meet me. I'm killin' you or you kill me". An', I mean,

Sib this is no joke. Tha's what happen. So he met 'im that evenin'

an' he tol' him, say, "Well, I came to kill you. You been messin with

one of my Negroe". So the police went to get his pistol. An' Charlie

Hulen shot him through the heart. So they pulled him over out the street

an' let the honky-tonk roll on.
