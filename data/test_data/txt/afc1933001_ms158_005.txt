Dear Mr. Smith:
Dr. Carlton Smith of the New York Public Library has 
asked me to order for him a group of selected records 
of American Folk Songs issued by Victor.  He is leaving
Friday by plane and will appreciate your sending him
collect the records on the [*e*]inclosed list.  Some of them
may be out of print.
John Hammond can possibly help you to find the R. Johnson
records.
Very sincerely yours,
