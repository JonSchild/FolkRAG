Gloria F. Young   3/12/43
English III

It is said that Hitler is dead.
Maybe he just went and visted
his brother "the devil" lets
hope he stays at "home" he
enjoys heat so much.
  So all America has to do
now while Hitler is visiting
is to follow this Motto:

God gave us two ends
One to think with
One to sit with
The war depends on which
end we use.
Heads we win
Tails we lose

So lets apply this motto, don't 
sit so much use your head.
and we won't let Hitler come
back because he wouldn't
like a cool earth, now would
he?
