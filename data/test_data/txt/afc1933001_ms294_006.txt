Serbian flute players in Detroit, 
Finnish fingers in Upper Michigan. 
French Canadians all along the border. 
The Czec colonies in Mif le Atlantic States 

Follow the rivers, 
Look into isolated valleys, 
Open the doors of Holiness churches, 
Go into places of low resort, 
Ask your maid, 
Ask your husband who works on the railroad or in the 
oilfield, 
Listen to the people who sell charcoal in the streets 
or watermeolns in the South. 
Get to know your own country.
