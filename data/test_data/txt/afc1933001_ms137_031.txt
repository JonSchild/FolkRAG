Dear Mr. Lomax:

           Enclosed is a check for $92.10 which I hope will help you for 
the time being. Also enclosed are two vouchers which Mr. Voorus 
says cannot be notarized here any more. Mr. Voorus claims that, 
according to a new ruling, you must be present if he is to notarize 
a document bearing the statement "in Washington, D.C.". He added 
that if you could get it notarized by a government notary, there 
would be no charge (don't forget to cross out the word Washington 
and substitute the place where it is notarized). Finally, keep sending 
in the vouchers at frequent intervals if you expect to receive 
any additional money. 

                 Miss Rogers tells me that no registered letter has come to the Library as yet. 
    
         Father just dropped in this morning and he is looking fine.
                                                                         
                                                                      Sincerely,
 
                                                                      Harold Spivacke
                                                                      Chief, Division of Music
