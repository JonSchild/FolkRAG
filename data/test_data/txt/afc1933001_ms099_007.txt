This does not mean that the collecting end will be in any sense neglected. I want to collect on week-ends in this whole area and I want also to go on a field trip next summer for perhaps two months. But with the widespread distribution of recording machines today and with the general acceptance of folklore, it is not as necessary for me personally to cover the country as it  was for you and Alan who were pioneering. In other words I hope that I can combine both the administrative and collecting, shifting the emphasis for myself, however, to the former. Don't mistake me. I prefer the latter. But the first has to be done -- damn it. I think you know my feeling, if only because you remember Marion and me at the Windsor in Denver.

All of which brings me in a very round about way to your letter. I cannot at the moment "do" Kitteridge as I originally suggested, although I shall not forget it and keep notes as I run acrossx materials. You yourself are probably busy at this moment, too, with your new book, so that can wait at least until Spring. The same holds true for Leadville and mining leads, although I hope to hit that section of the West next summer. It has not been done, and the Archive is weak on Colorado, Utah, Nevada, etc. Mining, however, is still my main interest and Wayland Hand and I have a future book on it in the slow moving mill. I estimate now that it will be three or four years before we really get down to the last lap, but collecting will in the meantime still go on. I should very much like the informant lead if you can still dig it out. Hand has, by the way, recently been up in Butte, but I don't know yet what he has uncovered.

In your letter also there are two things which troubled me. One, your health. You spoke of being tired in a way which neither Marion or I liked to hear. We both hope that it is nothing serious and that you will, like this land -- your land, go on forever. The second was [deleted] your statement that you intended to give your papers to Harvard. I am from Harvard as you were. And next to the Library of Congress, there is no other place comparable in my books. And I myself should hesitate between the two if I had any papers of value. But because you have identified yourself in your collection with the Library of Congress and because the whole American people have also identified you with it, I hope you will reconsider your decision. You have grown from a Harvard graduate student and Sheldon scholar, grown from Harvard, to become a great national figure. You belong to the nation and not to an [deleted] institution. I write this not because I have the Archive post or because I think it any duty to do so, but simply as I would write otherwise, or as we might talk over a drink. I am very sincere in this and if it were possible to come to Texas to talk with you about it I would do so. I promise you -- as I did in my earlier letter -- that the Archive will grow under me and become what you would wish it to. And to that end, I want to gather here the great body of work which has been done and will be done in the field. And I will do it. So that scholars will turn here for eighty per-cent of their [deleted] source material. It is something to shoot at in
