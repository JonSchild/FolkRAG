Addendum, May 9, 1935.
We now have something more to add in regard to the origin of 
these stanzas.  We have a sad story to tell.  Turning through the
February issue of the "Golden Book" not long ago, we came to 
page 161. These under the title, "The Old Story, Variation
on a Greek Theme of Marcus Argentarius," we [came upon] was the poem
that Lead Belly called "What Love Have Done." It was ascribed to Edward Arlington Robinson. At first
we thought we had Lead-Belly it is and were seeing things, but our
family corroborated our impression, -- Lead Belly is a plagiarist.
Desperate from our demands that he "think up" some additional words
for his "Li'l' Cowboy Song," he had lifted the poem entire from the 
issue of the "Golden Book", that had lain about our house 
in Wilton, Conn for months. Except to improve it by the 
addition of a word here and there, he had not changed the poem. 
The case is horrible, but clear, -- Lead Belly is a plagiarist. 
In his defense we can only say that 
his crime was so simply and daringly conceived, 
that he was caught by accident; not by two such literary 
sleuths as Professors Kittredge and Rollins. In exoneration we add
that his taste was excellent. 
The title and the refrain are not Robinson's but Lead Belly's own --
that is, so far as we now know.
