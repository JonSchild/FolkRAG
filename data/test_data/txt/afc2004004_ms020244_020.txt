Can't you hear the bell tonin'?
There's somebody at the graveyard, etc.

Oh, the children keep a-screamin',
"My mother is dead.", etc.

Oh, the preacher keep a-preachin'
On somebody's funeral, etc.

Oh, Heaven keep a-ringin'
On somebody's coffin, etc.

Oh, what's the matter, Mary?
"My baby is dead, Lord.", etc.

Yeah, Mary come a-scremin'
To the Roman cross, Lord, etc.

Oh, what's the matter, Mary?
"King Jesus is a-dyin'.", etc.

Oh, what's the matter, Mary?
"My child is dead, Lord.", etc.

I've got to go to judgment
And you can't go with me., etc.
