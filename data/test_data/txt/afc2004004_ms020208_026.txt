And then on one occasion that any sinner could do, because they pose as Christians and get the confidence of the people, they teach false doctrines, and then they practice all kind of a sinful things, you know, in their presence and lead lots of people on.  Sure, I had a man here running me a meeting - his brother was a member of my church - and he'd come in and preach, and go off that night and get him some sproting women and have a big time, and he got to the place so drunk he couldn't preach, so he wanted to -- Well, he was a good preacher, you know, Well, he had got the people, you know, liking him.  And he thought he could put me out and get the church, and I give him enough money so he went and paid down on the car, got a car, and he carried me on to Fort West with him to see my niece over there.  And believing he had the sweet of a girl to go with us, and she's at the drugstore know, and he picked her up and carried her.  And he come back and told the people that I carried the girl and went over there and left me there in the house and I went me down and all like a that, you know, and I went to my niece's house, you know, and he went there with me, the girl with him, and they went in.  Well, she made him something, you know, and she wanted to see me and I got talking and I come out, he had left.  And then the girl told me that he said the she wanted me.  And I guess that's strange.  And then I started to go and catch me a bus and get on home.  But on account of the girl being there, a member of my church, and she begged me so to, I just stuffted down and come on back with him and come on back and brought all that stuff right here in my church.  I just sent him on away.  And, you know, that same rascal had the gall to come back here and want to preach for me again!  I wouldn't even let him say his prayers in my church.
