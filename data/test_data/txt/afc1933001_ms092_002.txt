Dear Mr. Henderson:

As you are no doubt aware, the Library of Congress has been engaged during the
past few years in supplementing its collection of Americana in terms of field
recordings of otherwise unpublished but at the same time unique and valuable
specimens of American folk song and folk lore. 

The Archive of American Fold Song, which has been accumulated under the direction of John A. and Alan Lomax has grown to be the best single collection of American folk stuff and is in a position to make important contributions to the whole field of American history, education, art and perhaps now, morale. Almost all this material has been gathered in the homes of folk singers in relatively isolated sections of the country and from places where it was possible to go only by automobile with sometimes a good long walk from the point where the roads ended. With the necessary rationing of automobile tires, we are faced with the prospect of much of our field work being curtailed.

Much of our collecting is now doneby private individuals to whom we learn portable recording equipment and it is from these people that we have obtained recently not only folk songs but a documentation of contemporary American sentiment about the war effort which has been used by us to create a number of documentary programs which we believe will have an important place in the morale building effort. Currently the Office of Emergency Management is constructing a morale program from the material and we believe that further use will be made of our facilities and our field technique. We wish, therefore, that you would consider whether or not it seems advisable to make certain exceptions to the general tire rationing procedure in favor of our field work. You may be sure that if you decide that such exceptions are worthy of being made, we will not make applications for such exceptions unless the work itself seems to justify them. 

The case in point at the moment is that of John A. Lomax, Curator of the Archive
of American Folk Song, who has been planning an extended trip in the Southwest to document what remains of the tradition of cowboy song, to record the reminiscences
