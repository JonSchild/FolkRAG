Life in the Camp at Argeles

REFUGEES FOR SALE
Douglas Jacobs

WHEN Marshal Petain, French
Ambassador to Burgos, returned to
France on a visit early in July, he
went immediately on a hurried trip
to the major concentration camps in
which the Spanish refugees were interned.
Considering that Petain had
received somewhat shabby treatment
from Spanish fascist leaders, liberal
circles in France seized upon the aging
Marshal's visit to the refugee
centers as proof of the fact that
France was about to reverse her long
policy of "non-intervention" and "appeasement"
of Franco and that therefore
the refugees would benefit.

Shortly after Petain's visit to the
camps and some subsequent discussions
with the then Foreign Minister
Bonnet and Premier Daladier, the
Bank of France returned to the Spanish
Republican Government's gold reserves
to Spain, and it became apparent
to even the most wishful
thinker that the Daladier Government,
under the influence of Mr.
Chamberlain and his colleagues, was
not yet ready to abandon all hope of
weaning Franco from the Rome-
Berlin nursing bottle.

With the outbreak of the war in
Europe and the signing of the Soviet-
German non-aggression pact, this
gradual weaning process was rudely
and successfully hastened - but not
by the French or British Governments.
Again wishful-thinkers in all
countries assumed, however, that the
new situation would necessitate a
more liberal attitude to the refugees

on the part of the French Government. 
Nothing could be further from
the truth. The necessity for keeping
Franco in a state of "benevolent neutrality"
strengthened the arguments
of French Rightist circles for the continuation
of a policy of appeasement
to Franco. And the tendency of the
French Government to return the
refugees to Spain, which had become
so strongly apparent immediately
following Marshal Petain's visit to
the camps, was and is now in no way
lessened, despite the fact that this
policy is today even more obviously
to the disadvantage of the French nation
than before.

It is no exaggeration to state that
today the Spanish refugees on French
soil are in grave danger of being
used to "buy" from Franco his
"benevolent neutrality" in exactly
the same fashion as the gold reserves
of the legitimate Spanish Government
were used in order to appease 
the Spanish fascist Government.

Regardless of political convictions
and quite aside from any consideration
of the rights or wrongs of the
Spanish struggle, no humanitarian 
person, least of all democratic
Americans, will condone such treatment
of hundreds of thousands of
helpless men, women and children.
Nor can such humanitarians fail to
do everything within their power to
lessen the physical hardships which
this policy of "appeasement" has imposed
upon these victims of aggression.

First-hand reports and studies of
all available information lead competent
observers to believe that there
are, at this time (October, 1939),
somewhere in the neighborhood of
250,000 Spanish refugees in France
and North Africa. The French authorities 
have admitted to United
States Ambassador Bullitt the existence
of 182,500 such refugees, but
leaving aside all other factors, the 
truth is that no one has ever known
exactly how many Spanish refugees
came to France and its North African
possessions, how long they stayed,
or even exactly where they stayed.
Certainly the original exodus from
Catalonia in the early part of this
year totaled more than 400,000 persons,
and certain it is that, yielding
to the blandishments of Franco, the
pressure of the French authorities
and the horrible physical hardships
of their exile, many thousands have
since returned to Spain, some of them
openly, and others by way of the "underground
railway" which operates 
in a most efficient manner through
the high passes of the Pyrenees on
the French-Spanish border.

Taking the estimate of the French
authorities made to Ambassador Bullitt
as an absolute minimum, and
taking also additional information 
from the same sources at its face
value, it can be said with absolute
certainty that at least 100,000 old
men, women and children are at this
time interned in French concentration
camps and refugee centers and
that approximately 42,000 Spanish
militiamen are also being held as virtual
prisoners of war.

Why does not the French Government
employ in productive work the
able-bodied Spaniards? France needs
man power with which to operate her
mines, mills, and factories, and tilll
her fields while so many of her own
citizens are at the front. Perhaps the
answer is apparent when one considers
that self-interest alone should
have dictated to the British and
French Governments a policy which
would have been entirely different
from that of "non-intervention"
and "appeasement" which they followed 
during the war in Spain, and
that Franco's present neutrality is in
no sense due to those policies of non-
intervention and appeasement, but
rather to the fact that, any other considerations
aside, the Soviet-German
pact did drive a wedge through the
Rome-Berlin-Tokyo and Madrid anti-
Commintern bloc. Today, self-interest
alone would dictate that France em-
