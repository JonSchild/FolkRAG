Atlanta, Georgia
August 13, 1942

On August 11, 1942, I heard:

(1) From parties in Tallahassee that during the last
full moon, two German submarines surfaced at the same time about
10 o'clock at night just off the beach at Fort Lauderdale. They
were so close that the voices of the sailors talking between the
two boats could be plainly heard on the beach. That, they stayed
on top about an half hour and just after they dived some planes
appeared and dropped bombs, but so far as is known, no damage was
done to said submarines.

On August 12, 1942, I heard:

(1) From parties in Jacksonville that it is believed that
enemy submarines are being furnished supplies somewhere between
Fernandina and Daytona Beach, Florida, but so far no one has been
able to determine the exact place.
