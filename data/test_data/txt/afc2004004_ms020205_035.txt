[*Room 1301 - Bea Baron*]

R   I was born in [Ramsen County], Webster Parish, Louisiana.
A   How long ago was that?
R   It was in 1871.
A   Who were your parents?
R   Anthony [Blue] Roe and Eliza -- she was a Bates before she married.
A   Were they well-to-do-people or-- ?
R   They were poor. They were farmers and of course I didn't have the same
privilege[s] that others had.. There were no schools the[n]re in our home

an old Irishman, you know, to teach us, and there I learned to read.

and three of my mother's -- [they] that was old enough, you see, to work and
[we] he made some money, and we bought this farm from a Mr. Hast[ing]y, [a] 300
[farm] and eighty acres. [Pretty] We had a pretty hard times [paid] paying for that farm, working, you
know. I began  working in the field as a full hand in the fields when
I was nine years old.. I beg[a]in plowing at nine.
A   It must have been mighty hard on a little boy.
R   Yes, (laugter) I remember [some time that] how I'd wrassle with the plow, you know, and some time it would throw you
down, well, I'd get up and try it again, you know. We had a hard time
[know, we paid for the farm] until we paid for the farm --And then Mr. Hasting had a claim[ed] you know the hogs -- you
