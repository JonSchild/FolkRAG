Mr. John A. Lomax
400 East 34th Street
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

 We have been working for some time as you know on the question
of a reissue of COWBOY SONGS AND OTHER FRONTIER BALLADS with the
changes which you have in mind. Unfortunately the costs of the revision
have been much greater than I anticipated when we first talked
the matter over. Despite this fact, our plans have shaped up as
follows:

We would like to bring out a revised edition of the book in
1937, with the substitution of about twenty-five new songs for twenty-five 
which you think should be eliminated. We have allowed for
eliminating the present pages of music, with piano accompaniment, from
the book and substituting for it music for fifty or sixty of the songs
made up of one-line notations only. We have also allowed for a certain
number of notes which I understand you wish to add. This, I think, is
in accordance with the plans which we talked over when you were here,
