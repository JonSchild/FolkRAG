The VIEWPOINT...
Leisure and recreation need to be reconsidered and interpreted, their educational implications explored, and their contribution to democratic living evaluated.
Skillful performance of individual and group activities leads to emotional stability, gives personal and social pleasure on a high esthetic level, and introduces the participants to activities which not only are interesting in themselves but also are a survey of the folklore of many nations.

Each week is an independent Institute, yet all weeks are integrated.  Members may enter in any week and stay as long as they wish.
