The Night before Hitlers Death

The Gremlins
to Hitler:

The Gremlins will get 'cha if you
don't watch out!
They will make de feuherer's army
look like sour kraut
The Red army will be de hot
sauce
For you my feuherer der Big Boss
And when your time comes for
you to go
The gremlins will take you down
below.
You will think of the people you've
killed
But don't worry Big Boy, you
won't get killed 
You'll work, you'll sweat both
day and night,
Cause dat German never could
fight
You'll reap a harvest not of
silver and gold
But put ease and rest on five
million souls.
