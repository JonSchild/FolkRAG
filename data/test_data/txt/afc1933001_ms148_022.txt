Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thanks for your nice letter of August 24.  I shall 
be glad to let you know a week in advance of my 
going over to hear your records of negroes singing 
railroad songs.

No, I am not a collector of railroad songs and stories 
although I have probably missed quite a bit during the 
last twenty-five years' association with the railroad 
in not attempting to do this.  My primary interest 
in your collection is because of the fact that we have 
a fine Glee Club on the Baltimore and Ohio and I thought 
that perhaps some of the songs might be adapted by a 
competent composer for use by our male chorus.

Sincerely yours,
R M Van Sant
