THE BOLD ENGLISH SOLDIER.
1) I'm a bold English soldier that fought on the line.
The first place I stayed was Newcastle-Upon-Tyne,
I'm tired, sick and weary of marching all day,
To a house down by the hillside I'm making my way.

2) Well, I first had my supper, and then had a shave,
For courting this fair maid I highly prepared.
The moon in the sky and the stars they shone down,
And I hit for the road with my army books on.

3) I knocked at my love's window, my knock she did know,
And out of her slumber she woken so slow.
I knocked once again, and she said, "Is that John?"
And I quickly replied, "With my army boots on."

4) So she opened her window, and then let me in.
'Twas into her bedroom she landed me then.
The night being cold, and the blankets rolled down,
And I slept there all night with my army boots on.

5) Early next morning at the break of the day,
Says I to my true love, "It's time to go 'way."
"Sleep down, sleep down, love, you know you've done wrong
For to stay here all night with your army boots on."

6) So he bent down his head with a laugh and a smile,
Saying, "What could I do, love, in that little while?
And I know if I done, it, I done it in fun,
And I'll do it again, with my army boots on."

7) So six months being over, and seven after this,
When this pretty fair maid grew stout around the waist.
Then eight months being over and nine comes along,
She hands him a young son -- with his army boots on.

8) So come all you young ladies, take a warning by me.
Don't never let a soldier come into your bed.
For when he gets warm, sure, he'll think upon yon,
And he'll jump on your bones with his army boots on."
