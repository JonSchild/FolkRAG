have sung with you without
losing a week of her stay
at home. Corporations are 
heartless, I know full well.
Perhaps it was all their 
fault.
Referring to your programs
again, up till now I think
this symphony feature ineffective.  
They'd better let you
sing more thereby adding
interest and saving a lot
of expense; or get musicians 
who have more feeling 
for folk music.
Yours, hoping to see you
soon.
Father
P.S. Try to get Macmiilan's enough
of the book to start work.
