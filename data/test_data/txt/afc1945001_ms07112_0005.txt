               August 3 - The next rumor came from an Omaha employment representative 
who said:      "What's the matter with the Martin Plant?     Why don't they get going?
I understand they have had some Government investigation already, and from rumors, 
I think they need some more, for no one knows the reason for their slowness to
get into operation.     I guess they have a few planes flying around, but they are
moving awfully slow for some unknown reason, and people are wondering about it.
There is something funny about it, and certainly not that much a military secret.
Many people I've talked with are dissatisfied."     13
