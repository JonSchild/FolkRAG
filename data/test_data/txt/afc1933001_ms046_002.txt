Dear Sir:

On my recent trip to Akron 
Ohio and Ashland, Ky., I made 
24 1/2 records and paid out for 
incidentals, as shown by the enclosed 
receipts, #1524. In addition I sent 
to Miss Joan Thomas, Oshland, Ky., 
two paid telegrams @ 35 cts. each, 70 cents.
The total is #15.94

Sincerely,

John a. Lomax
