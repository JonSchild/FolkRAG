Dear Professor Lomax:
In reply to your request of February 1, I
am writing to tell you that you have my permission to include
my "The Battle of New Orleans" in your American Ballads and 
Songs, provided, of course, that due acknowledgement is given.
You will, I think, be interested to know
that I am sending the manuscript of my Ballads and Songs of
Indiana to the publisher within the few days. It contains
100 song texts, exclusive of variants (approximately one-third
of the total collection), and 35 tunes.

Sincerely yours,
Paul G. Brewster
