II. Rationing–continued
[*3*]
"You can't blame the small industrialist for having secret inventories
of raw materials. Prospective freezing orders and rationing are
always advertised so far in advance. Naturally a man will store up
to stay in business as long as possible." (Professional man,
Birmingham, 8/14/42.)

"Yes, I am taking a three month's vacation. Last year I worked day
and night and the government got it all in taxes. I propose to
take it easy now. If I work myself to death it doesn't mean anything
to me." (Birmingham business man 8/14/42.)

"I have tires stored in my stock room that ought to be doing somebody
and the government some good but I can't sell them account of quota
restrictions. The factory won't take them back even at the price I
paid for them. I stand to lose on the whole deal and nobody is
getting any good out of this rubber. I don't understand the government
at all." (Tire dealer, Birmingham, 8/14/42.)

"Rent control is not working in Mobile because I know of cases where
the rents have not been reduced. Now the landlords are trying to
get a ruling that if tenants sub-lease the rent can go up as high as
the amount raised by sub-lease." (Mobile union member, heard in
Birmingham, 8/15/42.)

"I need tires, and I've been offered tires by individuals, but they
all have the serial number burned off. These 'black markets' are
really operating – regardless of what the Government says. I'm a
Social Worker and my work seems a lot more essential than some of these
young fellows who buy tires and cars just because they can." (Lady
Social Worker, Birmingham, 8/15/42.)
