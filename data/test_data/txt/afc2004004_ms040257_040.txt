vengeance of eternal fire! Will boiling oil, burning brimstone,
scalding lead, a glowing oven, a scortching furnace, be an easy
lodging for me? Oh, why, my soul, wilt thou not be pursuaded
to repent? Is there too much pain in that? Thou art ready
to say "I cannot bear a cross, nor any affliction, a scoff or
a reproach: talk thee of crucifying the flesh, of parting with
thy worldly companions, of entering in at the strait gate: Oh
these are hard sayings. Who can bear them? But how wilt thou
do to dwell in with devouring fire? Whatsoever thou thinkest
now, think what hell will be when the day comes thou must descend
into it; thou mayest drink or laugh away the fear of it but
what will it be to thee when thou feelest thyself wrapped in the
flames of it, and not a drop of water to cool thy tongue!
Think on hell, Oh soul, and then think on Christ and consider
if a Redeemer from such misery be not worth the acceptance of.
Think on hell and think on sin and carnal pleasures and delights,
consider how they will relish with thee when thus salted with
everlasting fire: are these the price for which thou sellest
thy soul to hell? Oh bid these lusts and pleasures be gone;
bid your companions and sins be gone; and though you loved
them well and have spent your time sinfully with them, yet tell
them you must not burn for them, that you will not damn your
soul to please your flesh.
