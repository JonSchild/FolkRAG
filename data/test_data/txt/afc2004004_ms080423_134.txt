Tape:  33 R. Hicks & Friends

    Roll 33:   Hicks and friends continued.
    FP:    And that's a near as a way my father . . .                    get in
that tune, which I could . . .                   maybe, after a while, we could
talk about it a while.
    AL:    What about the facts of the case?
    FP:    Oh, there's gobs of facts.  They say that he was, uh, some people
say he was framed.  Pauline Foster and Ann Milton and some other women
might have had him framed, you know, made it look like he done it,
whereas they had actually done it themselves.  All circumstantial
evidence that convicted him so the whole truth will probably never be
known because of a, the lack of witnesses and stuff like that.  I think
he's guilty as sin.
    AL:    He was a pretty bad fellow, wasn't he?
    FP:    He was pretty wild and reckless and he just got out of the
Civil War.  And the last year of the Civil War he spent in a prison in
Keniston (Kenston?), North Carolina Federal Prison, and he got out in
1865, like about May or June, and walked home from Kenston.  That'd make
anybody pretty wild, walking that far, just about to Caldwell County,
Wilkes County.  And so, I guess bein' in the war and everything got his
mind kinda messed up, like all the rough times he went through.  They
said he was pretty wild even before he went in . . .              worse when he
came out.  
    (We should cut because of the airplane.)
    AL:    What did you say?
    (We should cut because of the airplane.  The airplane's too loud.)
    AL:    It doesn't matter.  We shouldn't notice anything.
    (You don't want to cut?)
