Go down , ol' Hannah, doncha [don' you] rise no mo'
Go down,ol' Hannah , doncha [don' you] rise no mo'.

[Each line is twice repeated)

Ef you rise in de mornin', bring j[u]edgement day.
You oughta been on de Brazis* in nineteen and ten;
[Th]Dey was workin' de wimmen, like [th]dey drove de men.
Oh, nineteen an[d]' then, it was a might hot year.
[Nineteen an' ten was a mighty hot year.]

You oughta been here in nineteen an' ten.
The men's wuz [*spell "was"*] fallin'--- a reg'lar haulin' in.
The sun wuz shinin', the mens wuz flying',
The cap'n wuz holl'in', we wuz almos' dyin',
The cap'n wuz holl(or)'in', "Jump in there, shine."
Number one leader, I wuz rollin' #some,
I wuz rollin', honey, from sun to sun.
Moon in de mornin' 'fore de sun did rise,
I would think about my baby, hang my head an' gry.
Oh, de man*on de en' a-holl'in', Bring 'em, bring 'em on 
here."***

#"Rollin'" is the equivalent of "working" and is [also] descriptive
of the easy motion of a man, who is a good worker, as he hoes [or]
or plows down a long row.
*The assistant cap'n, who oversees all the gangs in the [filds]
fields. If the work isn't going fast enough, "He'll get off
his horse an' walk 'cross de [fil] fiel's an' whip 'em , gang
by gang. He'll tighten 'em up, ef dey ain' tight like that. 
He'll give mos' men jus' five or six good licks, but ef one
is [wat] way late he'll throw him down an' pull[l] down his britches.
But ef you is a real good worker, he ain' gonna bother you
ain' gonna touch you 'tall."
*** "Bring 'em on here" , [a] part of the [slang] lingo of [Southern]
prison guards, meaning "hurry up", ["ighten] "tighten up."
*The Brazos river, one of three streams that drain [?].
