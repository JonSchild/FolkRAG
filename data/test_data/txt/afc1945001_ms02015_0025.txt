Dear Mr. Bane,
One of the important duties of the Bureau of Intelligence
of the Office of Facts and Figures is to discover public reactions
to the war effort.
The agencies who actually administer the various phases
of the war program are important sources of these attitudes. For
these agencies are deeply concerned with, and influenced by, the
reactions of the people with whom they deal.
Because of its large field staff, the Office of Price
Administration is in a peculiarly advantageous position to judge
reactions to an important phase of governmental policy.
Accordingly, I am very anxious to establish a continuing
contact with the Office of Price Administration for the purpose 
of determining, on a basis of mutual cooperation, public reaction
to price control, rationing and other related subjects.
Very truly yours,
