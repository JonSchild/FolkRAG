Dear Alan:

The best way to get in touch with Sonny that 
I know if is through James B. Long, Elon College,
North Carolina.

[*add to file*]

Sonny has been quite sick, but I understand 
he is much better now.

Jamie and I just haven't been able to get down
to Washington for any length of time. When we do,
we certainly will get in touch with you. 

Sincerely, 

JH
