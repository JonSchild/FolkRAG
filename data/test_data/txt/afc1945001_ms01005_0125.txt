Chief, Field Operations Division
Social Security Board
Room 915 - 1825 H Street
Washington, D.C.

Dear Miss Engle:

It may seem like a long time ago to you,
but in early August your office was kind enough to
assist us in the collection of rumors from the field.
Material resulting from this rumor collection was
combined with a more intensive rumor analysis made
by our Surveys Division to produce the enclosed report,
which, I believe, you may find interesting.

Again may I thank you for the assistance
you gave us.

Sincerely yours,

Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
