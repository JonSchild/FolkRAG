B Some items are natural and unavoidable. They may be analyzed
publicly to help people understand the natural (psychological)
laws which govern the development of such items.
C Campaigns should be directed, not against any particular phoney
(except in very rare, serious cases), but against the ignorance
that begets the phoneys.
VI Personnel should apply general principles to themselves.
A Phoneys should not be passed in an office diverted to their elimination.
B Workers should make themselves expert in critical thinking and
the psychology of cognitive activities.
C The reporting and analytical staffs should be anonymous -- to
get appropriate public commendation only after the dissolution
of the project.
D The directors and advisory council members should be made known
to the public. Success of the project depends largely upon the
skills of these people and the confidence they inspire.
E All material dealt with by the unit is to be considered "confidential"
in the strict sense of the term and only released through
the project director or as specifically directed by him.
