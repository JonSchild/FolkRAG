Uncle Bob
tunes are "Blues", most of which
he claims to have put together.
As he played for us in Oil
City the adoration of his
comely wife who sat by, the
gran regard and esteem manifested
by Uncle Bob, made
the scene memorable.
"Uncle Bob, you are now old 
and helpless, you wear ragged clothes
covered with patches, for fifty years and
more you were able-bodied and 
healthy. You lived in a rich country.
Why didn't you save up something 
for your old days?"
"I drank too much whisky"
said Uncle Bob. "Every Saturday night
I spent all I had earned the
week before. But I had a good time,"
answered Uncle Bob. I could detect no
tone of regret.
