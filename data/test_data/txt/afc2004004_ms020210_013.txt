A NOVEL CONCERT
BY BESSIE JONES
A Spirit of Georgia Islands
Permeates Oral Room
[*1-10-71*]
By John S. Wilson
     Bessie Jones, a leader of the
Georgia Sea Island Singers,
came north this weekend with
just one Georgia voice, Bessie
Burk, to support her in her
traditional songs, ring games,
shouts and spirituals.  But at a
concert sponsored by the New
York Pinewoods Folk Music
Club on Friday night at the
Oval Room, 13 Astor Place,
that was all the support she
needed.
     Miss Jones, a vital, garrulous,
68-year-old with an amazing
store of energy, fired up her
audience through a few songs
with Miss Burk's help and then
pulled her listeners more and
more into her activities both 
as singers and dancers.
     Wearing a stunning gold and 
black robe and beating time
on a tambourine (a new one
that, she said, was not quite
turned to her yet).  Miss Jones
moved through some old-time
religious songs with the sure,
developmental skill of a gospel
preacher, shouting out the lines
with a great swinging beat that
Miss Burk re-emphasized as she
sang back her responses.
     And then, interspersed with
tall tales, Miss Jones got members
 of her audience up on the
stage with her to play out the
roles of courting dances while
she and Miss Burk kept the 
beat and the lyrics going.
     Miss Jones had a jovial but
commanding way of presenting
her songs and leading the 
dances.  Yet Miss Burk, working
in the shadow of her friend,
gradually revealed a marvelously
 strong, resilient voice that
shot lines out like a whiplash,
nicking up the vocal energy as
Miss Jones turned her attention
to calling the dances.
     Even with a singing and
dancing company made up of
willing but breathless New
Yorkers, Miss Jones and Miss
Burk managed to bring a great
deal of the musical spirit of the
Georgia Islands to chilly Manhattan.
