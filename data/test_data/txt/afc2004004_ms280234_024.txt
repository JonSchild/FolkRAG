Cho:
All trouble and strife it is no lark
When Dublin City is in the dark,
All I want to do is get her to the very next park
And view the Zoological Gardens.

2) O I went up there at the old park gate
And found a policeman on his beat,
He was trying to make love to me darling Kate
Outside the Zoological Gardens.
I went up there on me honeymoon,
She says, My dear, if you don't come soon,
I'll have to get in with the dirty big hairy baboon
Inside the Zoological Gardens.

3) O she says to me, "My darling Jack,
I'd love a ride on the elephant's back,
If you don't give me that I'll give you such a smack,
All outside the Zoological Gardens.
At quarter past seven the bed did rock,
She says, "my dear, you've ruined me frock,
I've plucked off a one of the real old stock,
Inside the Zoological Gardens.

4) O I brought me ma up to the zoo
For to show her the lion and the kangaroo
There was he-males and she-males of each shade and hue
Inside the Zoological Gardnes.

The French a-Sailing.
1) 'Twas the French a-sailing, and Napoleon's gaining,
And his masts are straining across the waves.
And it's said that the fleet is bent for Erin,
For to face the vile foe to fight again.

2) For if I knew the tale was true,
My heart would leap like the thrush upon the thorn.
For to hear the bugle assemble the true men
Once more to battle on . . . . . . . .

The Wexford Man;
1) I met a man from Wexford with valor in his eye,
And he sat upon the tumbril with his head throwed back on high.
Andhe sang the song of freedom with his proud face all aglow,
Saying, "Are ye others coming, and a reaping we will go."
Cho: And a reaping we will go, with the guns and trumpets play,
And the cannons crash from shore to shore.
And the rifles flash - hooray!
