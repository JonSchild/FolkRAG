heat it, hot, let it come to a swell.  Then put it on and let 
it, and sweeten it enough to let it work, you know.   Corn buck, 
jus' like you gonna make moonshine.
TL:     How much sugar do you put per corn?
BJ:     Oh, goodness.  All that big ol' barrel full?   I put syrup 
most of the time, but[, but]  if I'm gonna put sugar, I put about 
10 pounds at a time, ya know?   [From] Some -- well, I en', I [dne] end up 
15 pounds, in there.
TL:     What proportions, Bessie?   Like you have a bushel of corn, 
how much sugar would you put with that?
BJ:      I put about ah 20 pounds.
TL:      20 pounds to a bushel?
BJ:      Um-hum... That'll make it, you know, good, an' sometime ya 
can make it over again, ya see, 'cause, after ya drink all that 
off, ya can add a lil' water, a lil' sumpin' to it, hot water.  
I put hot water an' let it come to a -- make -- an' add a little 
meal to make it work quick.
         An' you see lil' chilluns aroun' there with lil' j- jars an' 
lil' cups, all (CAN'T HEAR UNDER TONI'S LAUGHTER).  They got 
[sumpin'] some, too.   Ya know, they... ha, ha, ha!  
chillun.   "Got Coon Dick!   Got Coon Dick!"   They drink' em.  We 
catch 'em, we try to stop 'em, but there wa'n' no need 'cause there's 
hundreds a children there, from all places, ya know.   Had 
this big factory.
         An' that sure was funny.   I had much with them in that place.  
I had some very good friends.
TL:    What do you do after it works?
BJ:     Ya strain it off an' um. . .
TL:     Sprain it off?  What does that mean?
