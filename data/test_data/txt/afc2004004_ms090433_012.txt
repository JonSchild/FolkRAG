Fisk, 3. 11. DAVID EDWARDS.

[What they know now is what they been recording like Mr. Melrose] up in
Chicago sent for [??]

He'd get in tech with the good blues players he'd get them and they'd play blues for him -- he records And old numbers - they don't know nothing about old numbers. [They didn't know that old melody.]

A:   How would he contact you [them] down in there Memphis?

E:  Well, he'd have some boys write up talents for him, you see.  Now
he got a boy in Saint Louis [Robert__________) write talent for him.  I don't
know [any [?????] writes talents for him], but I think that someone in
Memphis gits up talent for him; I know they do.  He has a man [Itiene?]
& when he gets read to book them out, he have them on the road.

A:  Would the musicians that you know make pretty good money?
E.  They used to make good.
A:  What kind of money did they make?
E: Well, when they recording there, they got $25 a side for a record,
that's $50 a record.  But now they pay $7.50 a side, $15 a record.
A:  That's all you get?  What about the royalties?
E:  Well, they won't give no royalties now, not unless you're blind
or afflicted; they don't give no royalites.  Not unless they're started lately.
A:  Why is that?
E:  I don't know.  They just cut them clean out.  The records just got cheap; they cut from $25 a side to $7.50 a side -- why they cut that royalty off.  But [yet and] still they want you to record; there must be something in it.
Didn't, they [????} want to all the time [if they didn't want you] to
record,
A:  Well, what about the songs?  Who owns the songs when you get together
and record it?  Do they put your name on it?
E:  They put your name on it.  Whom'sever sing the song that's your
record, (not about music, you see?)
A:  Out side of records, how would these midgets and [all these] characters that
you talking about [how would[ make their living?
