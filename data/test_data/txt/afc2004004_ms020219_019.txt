BJ TAPE 6, p. 17

         Ya see, then 'e asked 'im an' 'e offered 'im everything in
the world, you know, he could do for 'im, you know, but jus', jus'
[don't], don't throw 'im in the briar patch.   "Do anything you 
wanna do, jus' so that briar patch ain' in the way.   My part
bein' so (?)...You can kill me, do anything...I know ya gonna
kill me.   Jus', jus' cut my head off; put my head on the choppin'
block, come on.   I don' care 'cause I, I, you know, 'cause, jus'
don't put me in them briars."   You know, he's scared of 'em.
"Jus' gonnabe all mungled (sic) up, an' mungled up.   Scared of
'em.   Mungled up so bad if you throw me in them briars.   An'
I'm not so long, the soul's so long (?), ya know?   Jus', jus'
can't stand 'em.   Please, please don't...Anything!   Don't put
me in those briars.   They, they's mean [things]to me."  An' so, "Cain't
get out of 'em.  They's jus' [so....]...oh, goodness!"
         "I'm gonna throw ya anywhere."
         "Throw me anywhere.  Jus' throw me anywhere."  Didn' care,
ya know?  Throw 'im anywhere.
         Wouldn't do that.   Well, he throwed that (?) that was in
this bag(??).   An' so went on down to this briar patch.  There
was big thicket, them great, big long briars.  An' he say,
"Briars," you know, unto hisself, "Oh, it'll be jes' the trick.
It'll jus' murder 'im up, jes' tear 'im up, like he say."
         He say, "Please don't ."   He, oh, he jus' pat 'im, jus'
grab him an' jus' pat 'im.   "Please don't.   Please don't."   Ho,
jes' beggin'.   Said, "I'd rather you'd jus' cut my head off.
Do anything ya wanna do."
         Well, he throwed -- He took 'im by his heels an' swung him 
over an' over an' -- hah, hah -- so, anyway, in them briars.
Great goodness!
