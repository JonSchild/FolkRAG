-3-   Rumors, 8-3 to 8-8   New York  8-14-42

   New York 8-4 (Garment trade executive):  "Unless Hitler's drive toward the oil fields can be completely checked soon, Stalin may capitulate. That's the way the people in our industry feel. Russia has not been getting the necessary aid from us. Russia's war resources have begun to peter out."
   Yonkers 8-4:  "The Russians are such realists that they will make peace with Germany if it seems to be a good idea, regardless of how the rest of us may fare. She'll probably make peace before the end of this year. Who can blame Russia -- we aren't giving her any support."
   New York 8-7:  "Within one month, Russia is going to sign a peace treaty with Germany. I've got it on good authority -- it comes from the State Department in Washington."
   New York 8-6:  "I don't trust those Russians. They made a treaty with Germany before and they'll do it again. A friend of mine says she's heard that Stalin and Hitler may get together next week."
   New York 8-8:  "Because of the Russian situation, we stand a very good chance of losing this war."
   Troy 8-5:  "The Government is not honest with Russia and has deliberately stalled in sending aid. I don't think the higher-ups want Russia to win, in spite of all this United Nations talk."

War Bonds
   New York 8-8 (Italian-American):  "Those war bonds will never pay off. If you turn'em in, you'll get some other kind of bonds. Maybe your grandchildren will get twenty cents on the dollar."
   New York 8-6:  "How do we know that we will get our money back from the War Bonds? Ten years from now everyone will be clamoring for their money and the Government will not have sufficient to take care of the demands."
   Brooklyn 8-5 (Italian-American):  "My uncle and aunt wondered if we will ever be able to get the money back which we are putting into bonds."
