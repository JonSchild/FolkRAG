Joke
Men discussing President
Roosevelt's fourth term:
Man: It looks as if President
Roosevelt is going to break
the record as far as presidential
elections are concerned.
Other fellow: Yes, it looks as if he
is going to be like Joe Louis,
he ( President Roosevelt) is
going to break up everything
breaking the record. Thus, fixing
it so that nobody else will be able
to break the record.
   I obtained this by word of
mouth. I admit, however, it is 
a slurring remark and that this
may not be the type of joke
you are asking for.
