Got on de dummy an' de dummy didn' run,
Stop an' let me tell you what de dummy done.

Chorus: *[*]
But I ain' bothered a bit,Lawd, I ain' bothered a bit,
                                                       or
But I ain'[8] bothered a bit.Lawd, I ain' bothered a bit.
Left Atlanta 'bout half past one,
Made it all around by de settin' of de sun.
Got on de dummy, didn' pay no fare,
Police ask me, "What you doin' on there?"
Caught me by de hand an' led me to de do',
Hit me ov' de head wid a two-by-fo!--
Hit me ov' de head wid a two-by-fo,--
"Don' let me catch you on de dummy no mo'!"
Tole de cap'n ol' Ben was dead,
Didn' do nothin' but nod his head.
Jaybird flew in de grocery sto',
** Runned all over dat grocery flo'.
Runned in de coffee, runned in de tea,
Hadn'-a been watchin' he'd-a runned on me.
Runned in de flour, runned in de jam,
If dat ain' runnin' I will be damn.
I'm so glad 'til I'm 'bout to shout,
Me an' my whor-a had a fallin' out.
[Woman tole de man he needn' to grin,
"Cause-a money was made to spen'."]
Meet a woman, lookin' good an' brown,
Tell me, "You want-a whop a dollar down?"
"Looky here, gal, you needn' to fly,
Before you get to heaven, you got to lay down an' die."
