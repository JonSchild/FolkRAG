back to me there were as you know three copies
of each song one for me one for you and one for
the company. would like to know if you ever
ever got them. am working here in Heber Springs
now. and have a little more time at home. and
of all things I have worked at in the past. am now
running a small grocery store here for a Friend
like the work not much to do
give my love to Shirley when you
or write her and dont forget
Your Friend
