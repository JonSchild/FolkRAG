The Folks over There

In the immigration office in an invaded
country, the consul was swamped with 
pleas to arrange passage to America for
hundreds and thousands of refugees.
Indeed this man was very busy.  One day
an old and poor but brave woman appeared
before him asking if she could obtain
passage; The agent glanced up from
his work and said, "No, its impossible.
Come back some Tuesday, next year!"
The old peasant woman slowly turned
to go and then looked back wanly smiling and
said, "Would morning or afternoon be
better?"
