1.  A story is told as follows:
A housekeeper wishing to purchase supplies for
her home went to the store and requested two
pounds of sugar.  Said the grocer, "I'm sorry
but you must have your ration card."  She left
and went to another store and asked for a
lb. of coffee.  Said the grocer again - "I'm
sorry but you must have your ration card."  She
then went to shoes store and requested a pair
of shoes.  Said the salesman - "I'm sorry but
you must have card."  Getting very angry, she 
went to another store and asked for toilet
paper and hastily said- Yes, goddam it, I've
got my ass with me.
2.  Here's to Hitler, the sun of a bitch
May his ass rot with the seven year's itch.
3.  Buy War Bonds to help save your sons.
4.  To Hell with the Japs, let's knock em off the Map.
5.  Hitler, Hiarohito, Mussolini are three
We simply must knock s----out of
If the good old dawn we want to see.
6.  Roosevelt and Churchill
have racked their brains
To see how in the hell all these Japs can be slain
