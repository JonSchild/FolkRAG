mandolin playing ah fan - fantastic filigrees

orchestra.  No winds here.  The preference of
Europeans for strings uppermost.  And as
somebody said:  it's as hot as a goose - no,
it's as, it's as hot as a hen sitting on
goose eggs in a basketful of wool.  [LAUGHS]
And that music has ah travelled all over the
