2) A gay young buck was standing by,
The sight of her quim that dazzled his eye,
She said, "Young man, I feel amazed
To see a young gentleman stand and gaze at my - Refrain:

3) She said, "Young man, it you mean what you say,
Twenty bright guineas in gold for to pay,
Twenty bright guineas in gold for to pay
And then, young man, you may fiddle away on, etc. . .

4) That very soon he gave consent
And into the woods together they went,
While he performed and she pretured,
The boy in the boot he kept time to the tune on her, etc. . .

5) Now six weeks being over as I have been told,
She gave him some fire to keep him from cold,
Tok keep him from cold by night and by day,
And he cursed the young damsel that learned him to play on her. . .

6) Now all young men, come listen awhile,
I've told you what happened at Firelock Stile,
Or else like me you'll rue the day
You go into the woods for to learn to play on her, etc. .

Adieu to old England:
1) Once I could lay in a bed.
A bed of the very best down,
But now I am glad of a bunch of wheat straw
To keep my poor bones from the ground.
Chorus: 
So adieu to old England and adieu,
Here's adieu to five thousand of pounds,
If the world it'd been banished before I was born,
My troubles I should not have known.

2) For once I could drink of that beer,
The very best of the glass,
But now I am glad of cold water
To quench my poor lips from the thirst. (cho.)

3) That's all I know of that one.
Lomax: What's that about, Harry?
Cox: I don't know. Money matters. Somebody must have spent
a fortune. He spent enough, and that's how he finished up.
