(Ray) just shake it, get the water in it, third or half full. If
they gonna die, the blubbers would come to the top and then go

AL: Why don't you tell the part about getting Death in the sack,
actually in the King's bedroom?

Ray: Well, he comes on there, and the King's daughters got sick.
And he sent out over the country for doctors, and they all come in.
The word was, fix, if either one failed, he beheaded them, and put
their head on a stick, on a post, put their head on it. Finally,
when all of them was beheaded, he put out word if any ordinary man
could cure her, that gold or pay wasn't a lackin'... could cure the 
daughter. So Jack took the sack and the drinkin' glass and headed
off for the King's palace. And so he got there, and gosh! Lookin'
at a gold gate and all that stuff fixed around that palace of his
house. And so he went on in and hollered and the King come out.
He said "What you here for?" And he said "I'm here to try my mind
on your daughter, like all the other doctors." Well he said,
"You know the rules, don't you?" He said "Yeah, but I dad know!"
So he called him on in and he sets one of the other kids at on that
glass, half or third full of water, and he shook it. and that
water blew blubbers come up and shot down to the bottom, then come
up then shot down to the bottom and stayed,...and went back to the
bottom and Death was on her! So he opened that sack and got up
side of the bed where the girl is at and said "Wickitywack! Oh,
please, Death would you please come down into this sack." And
