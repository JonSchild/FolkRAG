Dear Mr. Lomax:

It is nice to hear from you again. Yes, indeed we still
want the story on "Home on the Range" -- about 3,000 words. We'd
like a copy fairly soon. Don't rush, but send it along when you
can. We'll be happy to send you a check for $25.00 on publication.

Sincerely yours,
Ernestine Taggard
