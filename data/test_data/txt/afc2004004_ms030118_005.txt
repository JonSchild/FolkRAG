They happened to spot him right then. He jumped out of that tree
an forgot to git his shoes. They give him five yeahs fo that.
An that white man got him out of that. So one day, theah was a man 
. . .. . . (?) an he saw a white woman comin long in a buggy. He didn't do
a thing, you understand. Jes went to the buggy, took the white woman 
out of the buggy, an hugged huh and kissed huh. Thass all. An the
woman fainted. That night bout leven o'clock they took that man out
there an made sausage out of him.
(what did they do to him?)
They lynched him. thass what they done. They made
sausage out of him, I tell you.
(You mean they shot him up?)
Mmm-hmmm. . . I tell you what I always have wondered.
why is it that a white man would love to have a colored woman,
an he don't want us to have one of his white women? . . . Now, you see,
I could have married you if I didn't have no wife. (we laugh)
But I couldn't carry you all ovah the Nunited States . . . No, I
couldn't carry you no further than New York. If I went ovah heah in
Jersey, I be done lost you. Jes ovah in Jersey. I be done lost
you...Fur as the discrimination is concerned, I look at the thing
jes the way you look at it. Out of one blood brought all nations. 
Cose your face are white, an mine are black. That don't say I
shouldn't have my equeeal rights. Jes lak you. Thass right . . . Now 
I tell you one thang about it. Jes lak I an yo u settin down heah
talkin. I an you can't hep it. Some mo come in an talk about it, 
they can't hep it. Except all Nunited States come together
on the things I an yo u talkin bout, we can't do nothin bout it.
Except that all States m et together, come together on the same 
things that I an you talkin bout right now. Thass the only way
