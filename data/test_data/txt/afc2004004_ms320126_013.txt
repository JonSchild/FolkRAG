passing off time you know?  They'd walk into a dance, now
they never did this where we played, but before our time,
they'd come in and take the knife, stick it up in the wall 
and hang their hats there.

Hey, let me tell y'all something.  I'm not kidding, I was
playing a big old barn bass fiddle and they had a free for
all in one of these places, and I'll tell you what, we was
dodging, man, bottles and everything flying, I was behind
that bass, I was pretty safe, but Darbonne with that little
fiddle he couldn't protect, but man they was throwing
bottles all over that place.  Boy, even the owner of that 
place was fighting.
LUDERIN
That old man from Big Lake used to say en francais "Les
chiens (?) et les femmes (?)"
RAMBLER
"The dogs bark and the women cry"
LUDERIN
The fighting was going on and old Sampson, Sampson Granger,
a friend of mine, he'd dead now but anyway he used to say
"Boy, Les femmes (?) et les chien (?).
RAMBLER
It means "the women cry and the dogs bark.
LUDERIN
Crying over the fight and the dogs bark "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo"
It's comical but that's probably the way it was.

You haven't got a song about that have you?
EDWIN
We had "Gabrielle's Waltz", but that, "Gabrielle's Waltz" is
about your "daddy looks like an elephant, your mama looks
like an automobile, your little brother looks like a frog
and your sister looks like the corner of a sidewalk.  The
mosquitoes ate your girlfriend, left nothing but the toes,
now you aim to stop my bottle"  C'est French, you like that?
