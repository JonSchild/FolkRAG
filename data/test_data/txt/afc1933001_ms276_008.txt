NEWS FROM OTHER LIBRARIES

Chicago Public Library

On November 27 the Chicago
Public Library Employees Union
took time out from a busy season
of activity to hold a banquet
which included among its
guests members of the unions
in the Chicago vicinity and
the Budged director of the
city. We sent a telegram of 
greeting and wishes for continued
success in their fine
program.

New York Public Library

An organizational drama is
unfolding in the New York Public
Library. The Staff Association
has been following a
vigorous program designed to
raise salaries and increase
book purchases and give the
people of New York better library
service. In this work
the Staff Association has been
given full support by the CIO
unions of New York, which in 
turn brought about the cooperative
support of the progressive
elements in the city government.
This seems to have
incurred the displeasure of
the administration of the Library.
Therefore the Administration
is starting a company
union to compete with the democratically
constituted organization
of the employees. We
are pleased to see the Staff
Association stand firm against
the intimidation offered by
the administration. We would
also tender a bit of advice:
Accept the compliment of the
administration. If you are
acting like a union there is
one more organizational step --
affiliate with the Congress of
Industrial Organizations and
be a union in the full sense 
of the word. You will then be
in the ranks of organized labor
together with the librarians
of the Chicago Public,

The Cleveland Public, The Library
of Congress and many others.

Milwaukee Public Library

The Milwaukee Public Library
Employees Union (AFL)
has just published a report of
its first year's accomplishments.
The list is impressive
and we extend congratulations
to the union and to the progressive
administration of the
Milwaukee Public Library.

THE "STICKER" CAMPAIGN

The "sticker" campaign was
inaugurated as a method whereby
persons desiring to contribute
to the Community Chest
but unwilling to support the
Chest in its position on the
Group Health controversy, could
make their pledges conditional 
upon the Chest agreeing to
purchase hospitalization services
only from hospitals which
are not practicing this discrimination.

A concerted drive of misrepresentation 
and of pressure
from officials in Government
Departments and solicitors for
the Chest has developed in opposition
to the stickers. Not
only are pledges containing
stickers being rejected, but
attempt is being made to induce
persons who have used the
stickers to withdraw them.

As friends of cooperative
medicine we heartily endorse
the "sticker" campaign and
maintain that responsibility
for any loss to Chest agencies
which ensues rests with the
directors of the Chest and not
with those who use the stickers.
We urge Library employees
who are like-minded to stand
by their guns.
