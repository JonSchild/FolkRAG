Bessie Jones Tape 6

This is a single track tape to be played at 3 3/4 IPS.
Recorded and interviewed by Alan Lomax in late
Sept. 1961. Transcribed by Dena Hirsch.

Contains 1 page of 1st husband's asking for her
hand. Then 2 songs, THE MAN I LOVE HE IS DEAD 
AND GONE and her own BEGGIN' THE BLUES. Then 3
fireside stories from her youth, 4 Uncle Remus
stories and miscellaneous tall tales and brags.

There is a brief portion of a bean farm song
and her own toast, when she stopped her drinking;
her attitudes toward carrying on on when she was 
doing it. "Going to hell in a decent way." A
couple pages of making and running moonshine, ages
19-20.

Finally a good, long story about life at Mr. Crum
Williams', near Abbotville, Ga. She starts telling
about Bob Young at the end of the tape.

Transcribed and reviewed by volunteers participating in the By The People project at crowd.loc.gov.
