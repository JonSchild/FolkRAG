I. Military Developments-continued
[*3*]
"Things must not have been as bad as the news indicated if we can
turn around and start an offensive (on the Solomon Islands) right
when things looked darkest they had in months." (Birmingham business 
man, 8/13/42.)

"I have two boys on the Enterprise and the Japs claim they sank it.
The Navy never has denied that. Can I find out the truth? Why
doesn't the Navy say so if it is true." (Woman calling newspaper
office, Birmingham, 8/14/42.)

I hear Clark Gable is really joining up to head the new Women's 
Air Corps. That ought to bring in recruits. I sure wish I could
be his orderly." (College Boy, Birmingham, 8/14/42.)
[*2/23*]
"That certainly is good news about the Americans finally starting
an offensive. I think we will see that the second front is really
going to be in China. I wouldn't be surprised if we have a whole 
force in China getting ready to lay waste the islands of Japan.
Little bits of information about forces in China keep getting in
the papers." (Birmingham businessman, 8/14/42.)

"The local draft boards are unfair and unfit to administer justice.
A boy boards with a friend of mine, single, who got deferred claiming
his mother was dependent on him. He bragged that he not only
didn't live with her but did not contribute to her support. He 
thought it was funny how he pulled the wool over their eyes. The
lady he boards with reported it to the draft board and they wouldn't
even listen to her. Somebody should do something about the careless 
draft boards." (Beauty Parlor Operator, Birmingham, 8/14/42.)
