I said, "Tha's stuff."  I said, "I don' even know 'im."  I 
didn' know 'im when I seen 'im.  Did['n know] not know him.  'Cause 
there were many of 'em up there workin'.
            All right.  So one night I was in this commissary.  
Miss Alice sent me there to get some Epsom salts for her to bathe feets 
and laigs, they was sick an' swoll.  I went [back] there an' got the 
Epsom salts an' I went an' bought some English walnuts.
TL:       Some what?
BJ:       You know, English walnuts nuts.  You know, nuts, Brazil 
nuts. . . I bought me some of them.   An' as I was comin' out I come 
[buy] by, you know, cloth.   There was a heap of cloth, you know, 
up on there, in there.   An' I was lookin' at some cloth that 
looked like apron cloth, you know that stuff, you know.   An' I 
was holdin' it up there lookin' at myself.   An' ah, this man 
walk up to me.   He say, "You like that cloth?"  I say, "I sure 
do.[like it"]  an' I didn' look up to see who it was.   The commissary 
was full of people, y'know.   An' ah, she was in there, too; he was 
in there; other mens was in there that he been tryin' to get to 
tell me that.   That was the same man right now; I didn't know it.  
An' he said, "Do you have time to take in any washin' an' ironin'?" 
 I said, "Yeah, I sure do."  An' I didn' even look up, still look 
at the cloth.   He said, "Well, will you wash somethin' for me?"  
Then I turned around an' looked at 'im.   An' I said, said, "Yeah, 
I'll wash somethin' for ya."   Didn' know who I was talkin' to.  
He said, "Well, you can get the clothes -- I can get the clothes 
to Catherine house."   He knew them all, ya know.   An' he said, 
"You can wash there, can't ya?"   I said, "Yeah."  Said, "There's 
water [up] right there, at the house."  I said, "I'll be glad to."   I 
said, "I [got] have time to wash mostly, but I won't have time on 
Tuesdays -- I mean on Wednesdays," that's what I was talkin' about.  
An' so he said, "Well, y'all be washin' Monday."   So, [I said,] "Yeah."  
"Well, I bring them to Catherine's house for you Monday.  I have 
'em sent, to Catherine's house next Monday."   So, I said, "All right."
          So, sure 'nuf, Monday morning early I went to Catherine 
house, an' the clothes was sittin' there.   See?   An' I wash.   I 
mean I wash there all day; they was some clothes!   I washed and 
I washed an' I hang up an' I take down.   I wash and I wash an' I -- 
All right.  I got all [them] my clothes washed.  So, he had sent word 
there during the day by a colored boy that he would send his child to get the clothes.
