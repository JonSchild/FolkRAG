got the seal of God. An' den you look for death an', [den you--]
an death'll flee from you, see?
It's gittn', it's gittin', it's gittin' bad. Ya'll pray but ya
[the] prayers is is not gonna be answered 'cause it's
closed up. Time is out! "Those who are saved will be saved, "He
said. "He, he that are filthy, let it be filthy still?" "He
does right, let him be right still?" See? An', an' "He that,
that, that is, that is unholy, let him be unholy still." See,
the times just out. It's just closed up. Like a man when he shut
his sto'. You know, at night.  [Them that] You ain't bought groceries,
just ain't bought 'em [it]. Closed up that's all, ya see?
An' so, it's just -- it's gonna be terrible in that way. Tha's
the way I see it. It said that, it's comin' a eagle from the south.
I don' know how an' where. Says, ah, an' these, an' these last
days, says, "The eagle shall come from the south an' shall spread
forth her wing. An' the Ethiopians shall take the land." That's
six months before the end of time. [So} Said they'll rule for a little
while, an' then end come. See, that when the war's coming through, there.
It's gonna be terrible! Killin', destroyin'. Gonna be a lot--
Every thing went, went, an' everything started from, from Adam's
time, hadda be some blood shed. Did, did you notice that? I,
I mean read that up, an noticed it?
See, in Adam time, when He put Adam an' Eve out the garden,
that wa' the on'y  two members He had. An' when they sinned, He
put 'em out. That's the on'y thing separatin' 'em from God.
AL: Do you think that God condemns prejudice? Prejudice agains
different races?
BJ: No-o! God made every one of 'em. No, no. Hum-um  [Said?} whosoever
will.
