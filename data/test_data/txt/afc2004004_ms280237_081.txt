5) At last I got him in,
And wriggled him about,
If you gave me all the world
I couldn't get him out.

6) At last I got him out,
He was so stiff and sore,
If you gave me all the world
I'll never touch another whore.

Lomax: And there's another way to begin that.
Cox: If you go to Lowestoft
And ask for the Rising Sun,
There you'll find two old whores
And my old woman's one.
Lomax: That's a real rough one. Would you sing that in a pub?
Cox: I have heard it.
Lomax: And Harry, tellme, when you were a young man, could you
fool round with the girls in the countryside, or did you have
to go to town to get a whore?
Cox: O they were all over the shop. They rarely went to town
for that intention. Those that led that life - that's where
you'd find them. Not so much in the country.
Lomax: Couldn't you get a girl to give you a piece in the
country, too?
Cox: Yes, there was them about.
Lomax: Just the farming girls?
Cox: Yes, that was done.
Lomax: Very frequently? Suppose you met a girl out in the fields?
Cox: Yes. There was some about just the same. But they went to
town for the main part. They do it for a living in those towns.
Lomax: Did they mostly have diseases?
Cox: The country places was alright. The towns - I wouldn't
trust them.

Maid of Australia
1) As I walked down by the Oxborough banks,
Where the maids of Australia do play their wild pranks,
Beneath a green shady bower I sat myself down,
Where the birds sing so gaily enchanted all around
In the forest, the native Australia (2)
Where the maidens are handsome and gay.
