A.L. . (softly to Bill Gordon) :
Give us a verse, Bill, go ahead. . .

Joe Savage (singing:)
I bought her (make-up?) for Christmas,
I tried to buy a diamond ring.
She said “I’m sorry to tell you”,
“Little Joe, but that
don’t mean a thing.”

A. L.: (to J. Savage:)
Sing that again, would you? sing that over
again. . .

J.S. : I bought her (make-up?) . . .

Reel 43 (no. 2042) :
Man in Group:
Tell me what she wanted, boy.

William S. Hart:
Well, I could tell you what she wanted, did ya 
hear what she says you got?

A.L.:
Sing a verse. . .

W.S.H. (singing:)
Get up in the morning
Harness my team.
When the (doggone rain?)
I will be seen.

Went to the commissary,
Tell him myself.
Don’t let my woman
Have nothin else.

(speaking : ) I don’t let her have nothin else, either.

Bill Gordon (reciting verse: )
Some call me slick,
An some me shy.
But you can hear my name
Ringin’ all up an down the line.
