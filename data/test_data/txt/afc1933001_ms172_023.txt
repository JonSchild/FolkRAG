Dear Alan:

I have heard all kinds of nice things about your 
sister from people who have not allowed themselves 
to be persuaded by you.

The apprentice system has been suspended, I think 
this is bad luck for the potential apprentices, 
because they had a chance to pick up in a year's 
time information which has taken some of us five or 
six years to assemble. However, that doesn't 
necessarily mean that there is no chance for your 
sister to do something here. Incidentally why 
didn't you mention her first name? If she can come 
to New York and spend a couple of days, I should 
like to introduce her to Joseph Burgess, the head 
of our personnel department, Bill Spier, the head of 
our script division, and Bill Fineshriber.

As to South American recording trips, I hear the most 
dolorous rumors about cuts in the music budget of the 
Coordinator's Office for next year. We may have 
waited too long to send you south.

Mary Elizabeth and I would certainly love to see you 
and your wife. I haven't been to Washington since 
last fall but if I come there you can rest assured we 
will look you up. Why don't you come to see us?

Sincerely,

Dave
Davidson Taylor
