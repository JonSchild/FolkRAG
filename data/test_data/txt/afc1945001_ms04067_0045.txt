Rumor heard in the lobby of a hotel in Denver, August 6:
"I think the Government is responsible for our present
inflation. Why, I know high school kids that are making $75 and
$100 a week at Remington Arms in Denver, and on a defense job at
Pando, Colorado, and various other places. I suppose they are
making these big wages all over the country. Kids that weren't
worth $75 and $100 a month are now making that much every week.
They are so young they don't have sense enough to keep it and they
blow it in as quickly as they make it. If the Government wants to
stop inflation they had better look into this situation because it
is a contributing factor. Young people never will be satisfied
after this emergency is over because they will have become accustomed
to earning large salaries." Another said, "Well, I'm a druggist
and I know that that is a correct statement because I can give you
the names of some of my customers who fit that description exactly."
