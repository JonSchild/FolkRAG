No. 3. Proprietor or manager of a neighborhood drug store - Maynard Gray, Brown 
Drug Company, 42nd and University, Des Moines, Iowa.

I checked two or three times with the manager of a moderate sized drug store located in a small shopping center in an average residential district. The 
drug store has a small lunch counter which is patronized for breakfast and supper 
by apartment dwellers. Mr. Gray said that he had heard "hardly any war talk in 
the last week." If we were to attempt another survey of this type I believe Mr. 
Gray would be one of the persons who might well be replaced.
