Mr. Alan Lomax

Dear Mr. Lomax:
Joe B. Pugh-Forrest City Joe and His Three Aces-
wanted me to write to you and thank you for the check for recordings-
so I am taking the opportunity to do so - but Joe is not
to tell me what to write. Joe B. Pugh was killed in a car wreck
Sunday Morning about seven April 3rd. They had been out all night
playing at Negro tonks and juke joints-as customary on Saturday nights.
They were returning to Hughes from Bruins when the driver-Robert
Williams lost control of the car and it flipped over throwing all
five out-knocked Joe's brains out on the highway-killing him instantly.
If I can be of further assistance in the above 
matter, please let me know.
Sincerely yours,
Lemuel C Ramsey
Lemuel C. Ramsey
