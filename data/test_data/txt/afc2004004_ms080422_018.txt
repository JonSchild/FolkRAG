Rabbit hunt continued. R-82 1
AL: Sounds like you were... living on that $13.50 a day--
Man: A week. 60 hours in the cotton mill- see that was in
'31 when things was picking up and beginning to back towards
normal and then I had a brother, which is my oldest brother-
he worked two weeks for free- they didn't pay him to learn
the job, he worked the job for free so he'd learn. He made
$6,50 a week, which was $20 a week. Well you take $20 a week, 
my daddy'd buy us new overalls for 98 cents a pair. And a
few salmon, we loved salmon. Back now, people dont eat such
as that for breakfast, but we had chicken for breakfast, and
salmon for breakfast, such like that, and we thought we was
become rich, you know?
AL: That's when you moved to town?
Man: That's right. So we moved here from the other end of the
county, what's called Drake County, which there wasn't nothing
there but a little country store--- that's what they called 
Drake town. My daddy'd work out there, he farmed up there for 50 
cents a day and then we got to the point where we moved here and
that's when we thought we got rich- with $20 a week, which we
come out pretty good on it, you know, I mean we was raised--I'm
proud of my daddy and my mother too. They done the very best they
could with us. I got more respect for them, I guess, than any
man should have for his mother and father on account of that. But
we had a good life, a hard life, but it was good. I believe you
are a better person when you're raised and you know what heartache
