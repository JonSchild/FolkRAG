San Francisco
1939

San Francisco -- a center of music in the West since the
gold rush days -- offers a rich and as yet hardly touched
field for investigation.  The main object of the History of 
Music Project is to prepare a comprehensive history of San
Francisco music.  This is being done through a series of monographs
covering its phases from 1849 to the present.  Written
in a clear, concise and vivid manner, it is to be published in
twelve or more mimeographed volumes, appropriately illustrated
wherever possible.

The series are to provide the student and the musician
with a reference work of local significance and a compedium
for consultation.  To the author, critic, and historian it
should be a valuable depository of information and source material.  
A work such as this will make accessible to the layman
an interesting history of the city's musical culture, a
subject which as yet has had but fragmentary treatment.  The
monographs are to be distributed to specific public agencies
such as schools, libraries, universities, and special institutions,
places where they will be at the disposal of the student
and the general public.
