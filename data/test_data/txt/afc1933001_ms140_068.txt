                            Attached you will find bills from the Presto Recording
                 Corporation, New York, N.Y. and the Metropolitan Sound Co.,
                 Detroit, Michigan, for your attention.  These bills cover 
                 items of recording equipment which I purchased in the field
                 to take care of certain emergencies which arose in the 
                 Archive's last field trip, July 23 -- November 3. 

                           The bill from Presto Recording Corporation, covers
                 cutting needles which were ordered by Wire and sent by air-
                 mail to Michigan, on September 20th.
      
                            The two statements from the Metropolitan Sound Co. 
                 cover the same items.  The statement dated on December 1, 1938,
                 is a due bill of the articles itemized on the statement of
                 October 28. 

                            The sapphire needle and pivot screw, purchased in 
                  Detroit,  replaced equipment which had been broken in the 
                  course of field work and travel and had to be replaced in 
                  Detroit when an unforeseen opportunity for recording arose
                  on November first.

                                                                                  Archive of American Folksong
