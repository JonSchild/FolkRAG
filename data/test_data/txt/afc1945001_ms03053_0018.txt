UTAH

"Well, they gave it to the spies. Now if they round up a few
more guys in this country and give them the same medicine, the country will
be a lot better off."

SUMMARY OF SOURCES . . . AND AREA . . . 

The area covered by this report is the populous 40-mile stretch
from Salt Lake City to Ogden. Next week's area will be extended both south
and north of this area in an effort to obtain more rural comment.

No conscious effort was made to link the rumor and its source in
this survey inasmuch as the original instructions of July 31 did not specify
that this be done. The August 15 section will be handled in the manner
prescribed in the August 5 Memorandum. Sources for the accompanying report
ranged form personal acquaintances, business men and group and civic leaders,
to street-corner touts, housewives, soldiers and self-appointed panel groups
collected in front of newspaper window bulletins.
