Dear Mrs. Morgan:

Mr. John A. Lomax has called my attention to the aid you have
rendered him in recording folk-songs for our Archive.  The records
containing your songs constitute a most valuable addition to our
collection and I should like to thank you for your assistance, and
express our deepest appreciation for your cooperation.

Very sincerely yours,

Acting-Chief,
