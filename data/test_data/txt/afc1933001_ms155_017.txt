Badest woman Ever come out teniSee
i Sleep with a Panter tell the Break of 
day i caught a tiger cat in the collar
and i ask him what he had to say.
and i wore a rattle snake for my chain 
and a negro man for my [fob?] and i 
made a Alee catch a train and a seetick
grab the mail their is nothing in the 
jungle Eny bader then me and i Shave
a gorelor tell he change his nitty nitty

Drifted on down the sea and i made a 
grisly gray lion Shake glad hand 
with me their is nothing in the jungle 
Eny bader then me i am the badest woman
com out tennise Arom
