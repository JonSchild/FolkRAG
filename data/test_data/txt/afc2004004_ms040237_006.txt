Dear Mr. Loman,

Here are the signatures of your
singers. You have made a slight mistake
in the names which are:

Mary Gillies
Mrs. Annie MacNeil, (Mary's sister and 
Lisa MacNeil's mother)

Mrs. Mary Johnston. (Mary's cousin
who gives the sea-birds calls)

Rachel MacLeod

They all send kind regards, and
Mary Gillies sends a special message.
She'd like to see you back.

I am,
Yours, sincerely
Annie Johnston
