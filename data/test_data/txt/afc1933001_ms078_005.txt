Dear Sirs:
     I notice on page 238 of "A Treasury of American Song"
by Elie Siegmeister and Olin Downes, that you have reprinted
the first song in American Ballads and Folk Songs without giving
credit to that volume. The note is phrases as if the song was
got directly from me, personally.
     I don't recall that I ever gave permission for you to
use this song, or for you or Messrs. Downes and Siegmeister to
use "Gettin' Up Holler".
     There are other songs printed in this volume which are
evidently so completely taken from my book, that I cannot understand
why substantial credit should not have been assigned.
                
                                                                                       Sincerely yours,

                                                                                        John A. Lomax
