Dear John:

I have not written you because I have just
shifted gear and gone into high at the Office of War
Information. I have one question to ask you about
the Rosenwald Fellowship which I am just preparing.
It's quite important that you use your own machine,
since the Library machines are going to be spread
pretty thin in 1943.  Would you be so good as to
consult your President or Chief Factotum and let me 
know for sure that you can use the College's recording
machine.

I hope Ruth is feeling better by now.  My best
regards to you both.
