Such early pioneer ballads do exist. Already I have collected
nearly a hundred from one state, - Texas. I wish to solicit your aid
in preserving from extinction this expression of American literature.
Eventually it is expected that the ballads will be published in book
form. An editorial request from you to your readers for copies of
frontier songs will doubtless result in valuable material. I shall
greatly appreciate your help to this extent, and your further favor in
forwarding to me whatever material may come into your hands. 
May I add that ballads, and the like, which because of crudity,
incompleteness, coarseness, or for any other reason are unavailable for publication, will be as interesting and as useful for my purposes as
others of more merit. It is my desire to collect the songs and ballads
now or lately in actual existence and in the precise form which they have popularly assumed. 
Yours very respectfully, 
JOHN A. LOMAX.

Mr. Lomax's plan has our hearty approval. The materials which he
collects are to be preserved in the Harvard College Library, where they
will always be accessible to investigators.
