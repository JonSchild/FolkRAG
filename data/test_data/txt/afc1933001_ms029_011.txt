Letter dated June 16 from
John A. Lomax

In a letter dated June 16, Mr. Lomax writes:

"Alan is now running the machine near Brunswick, Georgia,
along the sea-coast. From there he will go down into Florida,
the only Southern State in which we have not yet collected
material. Meanwhile I am following the old Cattle Trails from
Texas to North Dakota, locating and rounding up single singers
and groups of singers to be visited again later and their songs
recorded.

I have taken the liberty to trade in the old machine, badly
worn except one important section which we had built here in the
University of Texas laboratories, for a new one manufactured by
Lincoln Thompson, Waterbury, Conn. We had his machine in our
house at Wilton, and gave it a thorough trial, finally adopting
it with some accessories helpful to our field work, for several
reasons:

1. It is about half the weight of the old, whose
600 pounds was hard on our car.

2. It is much more compact, and more easily carried.

3. Its operation is similar.

4. We believe Mr. Thompson a more competent person
than Mr. Garwick. He does make his own machines
in his own shop.

You will understand, of course, that the new machine is the
property of the Music Division."
