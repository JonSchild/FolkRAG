Dear Madame Comhaire Sylvain:

I am delighted to hear that you will be
able to come to the Archive and work with us a few
days. I will have everything prepared for your coming.
It is likely that I will be leaving Washington on a
field trip by the 7th of June, so if it would be
possible for you to come by the 29th or 30th of May,
we would be sure of a few days work together. I am
looking forward to your visit with the greatest of
pleasure, I assure you. Of course, you will let me
know about when you do plan to come a few days ahead
of time.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
