Mr. John Lomax
Division of Music
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am glad to be able to tell you that the forty-five recordings
which you lent to us are today being mailed to you at the Library of
Congress. You would have had these back sooner, but I have been
awaiting some special tin boxes in which they are being packed to
insure that no damage comes to them.

I want to thank you once more most sincerely for letting us
have the use of these records. My journey to South America - which
was longer than I had originally expected -  made it necessary to
keep the records for all this length of time, but I can assure you that every possible care has been taken of them.

The series as a whole has been considered a very great contribution
to England's knowledge of the music of the American Negro,
and this was only made possible by the recordings which the Library
of Congress so readily loaned to us. It has been by far the most
authentic series of American folk music that has ever been prepared
for English listeners, and I myself put high value to a series which
gives to listeners abroad an idea of the singing of this section of
the American people. It is only by obtaining knowledge of this kind
that our people at home will have an understanding of the history of
the American people, and a greater sympathy for their modern culture.

I have today received a request from one of our departments in
London, wanting to know whether they can use again in the future
parts of the recordings which have been broadcast in this series.
They have, for instance, a program which is being prepared by experts
in England entitled "The Foundation of Jazz," and I know that there
are one or two of your recordings which they wish to use as illustrations
of the early Negro music. As this is merely an extension
of the series for which I was responsible, I feel sure that you have
no objection whatever to the further use of the recordings that I

[* To be taken from the recordings I made. *]
