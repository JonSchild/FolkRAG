Dear Alan:

I am very sorry that you have been ill.  Knowing that you
are very busy, I had just assumed that you were swamped with
work.  I wish this had been the case.

I had already selected Take #2 on "Grey Goose," but I lost
the battle after arguing it out with two people on "Whos Back
Buck."  When it comes time to release the second album, I
am going to attack again from a different quarter.

The following is the best information we have on Wade Mainer
and his Mountaineers.  His home address is Route #2, Weaverville,
North Carolina.  I understand, however, that he is
now on tour and the last address he has given us (which has
been quite recently) is:  c/o Radio Station WWNC, Asheville,
North Carolina.

I hope you will soon be feeling better and be back to par.

Sincerely,

R. P. Wetherald
