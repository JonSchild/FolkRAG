Dear Alan:

After reading your carefully worded
and supremely courteous notes my inclination 
is to tell you to go sit on a tack.  If I forwarded
the note that you sent to Miss Hinze,
you'd probably have a long white beard before 
she would do anything about it -- and I don't 
know that I would blame her very much.

As far as the copies of the scripts are 
concerned, I'll have them checked today and 
see what we can do about getting them to you.
Frankly, I'm a little puzzled about your closing 
billet doux; "If they're not available, get 
them typed up.  This is the official record".

Despairingly,
Bill
