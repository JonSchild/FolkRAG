our best wishes and
regards to both of you
and all hope to see
and hear from you
again in the future.

Many thanks for your
nice words about my
"Beautiful Girls"
I think they are beautiful
but dont expect every one
else to think so.

Respectfully
Mrs. T.M. Bryant

P.S. How did the pictures
come out?
