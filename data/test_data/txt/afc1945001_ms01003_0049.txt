MEMORANDUM                       April 18, 1942

To:  Mr. Robert Huse
       Executive Officer

From:  R. Keith Kane
             Assistant Director

Subject:  Receipt of Rumor Information and Processing of it

We have been keenly aware of the need for rumor
reporting for some time, but have been prevented from engaging
in any rumor gathering activities by budget limitations
and the fear of the bad public reaction which might
result from participation in this effort by non-Government
agencies and by Government agencies whose field staffs are 
not under our own direction.

At the present time we are starting on a modest
attempt to identify and report rumors from the field through 
our Correspondence Panel activities.  This is at the present time in a purely formative state.  We feel that we will be
better able to utilize the assistance offered by the Social
Security Board when the Correspondence Panel has been completed 
and we, therefore, suggest that the Social Security 
Board be advised that we are working on the problem but that 
we are not as yet equipped to utilize;e their assistance.
