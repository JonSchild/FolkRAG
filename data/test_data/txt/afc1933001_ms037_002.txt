My dear Dr. Leland:

Responding to your telephone call of yesterday, advising me that the
Carnegie Corporation has sought the opinion of the Council on the application
of Dr. John A. Lomax for a continuation of the grant covering the expenses of
his quest for material to be added to the Archive of American Folk-Song in
the Library of Congress, I take pleasure in sending you the following comments

We are glad to clarify that the results of this quest, in terms of recordings
actually deposited, seem to us an important contribution to the
Archive from a field, in itself important, which Dr. Lomac, both from previous
experience and present contacts, is specially competent to explore.
To date, after two successive grants in 1934 and 1935, Dr, Lomax has sent in,
from the Southeastern states and the Bahamas, 641 recordings. Just how much
remains to be done in this territory we cannot undertake to estimate. It is
rather for Dr. Lomax to outline the prospects, as he sees them, of securing
further significant material in this region.

Disposed to this extent to support the application of Dr. Lomax, we
think it not inappropriate to enumerate the conditions which we believe essential
to the development of a comprehensive and representative folk-song
archive in the Library of Congress. If the project is to function effectively
and to become, as it should, the national center for the concentration, preservation,
and study of folk and primitive music, its collections ought not to be
drawn from any one area or due to the activity, especially the subsidised activity
of any one individual, no matter how competent. On the contrary they
ought, in a large part, to consist of existing materials drawn in by active
effort from the center, which ought, then, to be in a position to encourage
and direct the efforts of local groups by placing at their disposal apparatus
and information, developing and disseminating its own collections, in the meantime,
though re-recording and exchange. Not until it is in a position to do
these things will the Archive be able to live up to the endorsement given it
last year by the Modern Language Association and, more recently, by the American
Society for Comparative Musicology.

If the above is sound, it follows that to concentrate the collecting actively
in one area, through repeated grants to a single individual, though it may
for a time be advantageous, will result eventually in a one-sided contribution
to the Archive.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music
