I.   Military Developments-continued
    "If the Yorktown wasn't sunk, like the Japs claim, why hasn't the 
    government issued denial." (Street car passenger, Birmingham, 
    8/13/42.)

    "The British Convoy to Malta (according to the English) got through 
    in pretty good order - they only lost one airplane carrier and a 
    cruiser -  but did you hear what the Axis had to say about it? 
    I bet if the facts were known one cruiser and one carrier were all 
    that got through." (Heard on the street car, Birmingham, 8/13/42.)

   "The British haven't shown any evidence of knowing how to fight 
   on land - they surely lose lots of equipment and men - but they're 
   a little better on water." (Business man, Birmingham, 8/13/42.)

   "It's no wonder our boys are finding it difficult to down a 
   'Messerschmidt'. They were taught to fight with wooden guns.   Is 
   that anyway to train an Army?" (Birmingham business man 8/12/42)

   "No, I  don't object to two of the saboteurs getting prison sentences 
   instead of death, if they helped in the conviction of the others. 
   Turning states evidence is nothing now and they'll never get 
   pardoned    anyway." (Housewife, Birmingham 8/13/42.)

   "I can't see why anybody would be sorry because all eight of the 
   saboteurs weren't put to death. From the way the trial was being 
   conducted it looked like none of them would be executed, so I don't 
   think there is any reason to complain because two of them will 
   spend the rest of their lives in prison."  (Office worker, Birmingham 
   8/13/42.)
