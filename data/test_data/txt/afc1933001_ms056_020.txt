The San Angelo bunch are 
a robust group of westerners, 
nearly all sons of cattle men. 
Mr. Thornbush, I suppose, can 
get some idea of their performance 
by having Mr. Broome 
read on some sample records. 
They dress their parts, though, 
as a matter of fact, they 
are all, probably, college 
graduates.

Your wire came a week 
ago. No machine as yet. 
I am still hoping.

Always sincerely,
John A. Lomax
