because the situation reminds me
too much of Robin.

Tuesday.
There have been two days of work
in Dublin, one with Seamus, lining
up most of the tunes. The next
with Sean finding material on
the stone of Torey and looking
for curses, beens, etc..
This morning there is the usual 
malaise before beginning to write,
but it is not as bad as usual.
I hardly think of Robin,
but that is because I have
learned with almost suicidal
violence that I must forget her
or be destroyed within. It
shows by my waking at 7 AM
& before in the black - cold in
bed.
