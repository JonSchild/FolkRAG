October 7, 1942

State: Florida   City: Jacksonville   Reported by: Man from Daytona Beach
Place or circumstances in which rumor passed: In my office

Rumor: A Daytona Beach man called at this office for allotment information
in behalf of a friend, fell into conversation and asked me, "When
do you think the British will fight their own battles?".  I pointed
out that they have done a masterful job under the circumstances,
and through their courage defended this nation from Axis domination,
to which he agreed, and then reverted to World War I as a basis for
his statement.  I asked him if he would have enjoyed being under
German control since 1918, for then, too, the British valiantly
prevented world domination.

He again agreed and promised that while his personal opinion of
the British is very low, he will refrain from comment since the
enemy aims tend toward building up a lack of sympathy and appreciation
between the American and British people.
