(36) August 15 - Richmond, Virginia. A reliable insurance salesman told me that he had heard that gas rationing books were being sold to Charlottesville at $2. and at Fredericksburg at $2.50. He also said that in some places in Washington the books were being sold for $2.50 to $5.00 each.
(37) August 15 - Richmond, Virginia. I have talked with an employee of the Defense Transportation. He stated that when he took the job that he was assured that his salary would be subsidized from some other sources. He said that he knew of three or four cases where representatives were appointed and that their salaries were raised by the Highway Users Association. Very often the men appointed were former secretaries of the Highway Users Association and their salaries continued in addition to their Federal salary.
(38) August 15 - Richmond, Virginia. A merchant, fisherman, and sportsman has just told me that yesterday the United States Marshall's office sold a boat approximately 50 feet long which had an A # 1 motor in it and was in excellent condition for $875. This boat originally cost $12,500. With the government taking over fishing boats that are slow and not nearly as serviceable, why didn't the government buy the boat themselves? I told him that I had no idea and that I couldn't understand it. He stated that the boat would do better than twenty miles an hour and that he couldn't understand it.
