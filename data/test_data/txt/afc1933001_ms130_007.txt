Dear Chick:

I suggest that you make us an estimate based on 
my first letter if you want the job, in a letter addressed 
to me, in care of the Archive of American Folk-Song. I 
am writing Barnicle today about the same matter. Indicate 
in this estimate how much time you think the work would 
take. Thank you for your information about pick-ups and the 
invitation. 

Sincerely Yours,

AL:ed
