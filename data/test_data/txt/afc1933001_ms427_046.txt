LI'L LIZA JANE

I knows a gal that you don't know,
Li'l Liza Jane,
'Way down South in Baltimo',
Li'l Liza Jane.

Chorus: Oh, Eliza! Li'l Liza Jane!
Oh, Eliza! Li'l Liza Jane!

Liza Jane looks good to me,
Li'l Liza Jane,
Sweetes' one I ever see,
Li'l Liza Jane.

Chorus:

Where she libs de posies grow,
Li'l Liza Jane,
Chickens roun' de kitchen do',
Li'l Liza Jane.

Chorus:

What do I care how far we roam?
Li'l Liza Jane,
Where she's at is home, sweet home,
Li'l Liza Jane.

Chorus:

OH! DEAR, WHAT CAN THE MATTER BE?

Oh! dear! what can the matter be?
Dear! dear! What can the matter be?
Oh! dear! What can the matter be?
Johnny's so long at the far.

He promised he'd buy me a beautiful fairing,
A gay bit of lace that the lassies are wearing,
He promised he' bring me a bunch of blue ribbons
To tie up my bonny brown hair.

Oh! dear! what can the matter be?
Dear! dear! What can the matter be?
Oh! dear! What can the matter be?
Johnny's so long at the fair.

He promised he'd buy me a basket of posies,
A garland of lilies, a wreath of red roses,
A little straw hat to set off the blue ribbons
That tie up my bonny brown hair.
