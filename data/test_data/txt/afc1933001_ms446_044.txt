25

Where in life's early morning I once loved to roam,
But now all is quiet and still.

Oh, how happy we were in our old cottage home,
When parents and children were there,
With the old family Bible that lay on the stand,
At the hour when we all knelt in prayer.

Many years have gone by since in prayer there I
knelt,
With dear ones around the old hearth,
But my mother's sweet prayers in my heart still
are felt.
I'll treasure them up while on earth.

One by one they have gone from my old cottage
home,
On earth I shall meet them no more,
But with them I shall meet around that beautiful
throne,
Where parting shall come never more.

LITTLE BESSIE

Hug me closer, closer, mother -- put your arms
around me tight.
For I am cold and tired, dear mother, and I feel
so strong tonight.
Something hurts me here, dear mother, like a stone
upon my breast,
Oh, I wonder, wonder, mother, why it is I cannot 
rest.

All the day while you were working, as I lay
upon my bed,
I was trying to be patient and to think of what 
you had said,
How the Kind, blessed Jesus, loves His lamb to
watch and keep,
