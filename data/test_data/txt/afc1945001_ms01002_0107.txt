Mr. Cornelius Dubois

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Dubois:

Reference is made to your letter of January 30,
concerning the release of material to rumor
clinics for local dissemination.

It was my understanding, at the time of our initial 
discussions of this project, that such release 
was to be approved by the Office of Facts
and Figures in the way that you indicate.

Mr. Williams tells me that this was also his
understanding.

                          Yours sincerely,
                           John M. Potter

                           Research and Analysis, Office of
                           the Coordinator of Information
