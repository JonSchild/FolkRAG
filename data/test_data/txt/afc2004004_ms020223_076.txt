That was the wust day in the world, to me.  To work, ya see?  So
it come to be no more'n no other day, now.
TL:  Would 'most everybody go to town on Saturday?
BJ:  'Most everybody, or either go fishin' or do they cleanin',
you know.  See, an' scaldin' or whatnot.  Whatever they wanted to do.
Sewin', or anything.  But Saturday was the day home, you see?  You
know, for the womens, especially.  Co'se for the men, if they had
special things to do in the field, they'd go out an' do it Saturday
mornin', you know?  An' at twelve o'clock, they don't do
anymore, you see?  But that wasn' jus' only because that they didn't
wanna do no more, you know, but because the mule had to res'.  Ya
see, that's what that was.  See, they thought, they thought more a the
mule than they did the peoples, of course.  The mule had to rest,
an' let, let the mule res' some.

knew it, tha's all.

or would they go to town and do their shopping?

town; some of them had to go.  Just had a big family, all of 'em 'll
have to go.  You know?  Co'se some [of 'em] 'll go an' some stay home [to] an'
work, some go fishin' or whatnot, see?  But jus' ah, jus' ah, one
family, why, you know. . .Or not much in the family, why, they all
may go. . .
