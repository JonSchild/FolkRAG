Dear Mable,
I think you should get in touch with the
Atlanta man yourself.  I don't know anything
about the show in October.  Please
send me the paper about the film made
in Atlanta--I'd better look at it.
I'm just  back from Russia and have no
other news but will write again next
month after I've had a chance to get 
settled.
Much love to all,
Alan Lomax
