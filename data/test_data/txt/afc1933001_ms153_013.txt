Dear Father: 

My telegram should have read, "The dummy has been 
in for a month and the manuscript for two weeks" which 
was substantially the case, I believe. They must have 
the manuscript since I receive as acknowledgement for the
same recently. I have worked on the book to the neglect
of a number of other really more pressing projects and
I shall be able to finish the whole job including the
difficult record appendix within a month. Please don't
worry about it. I should have kept you more closely
informed about the progress, however.

I am glad you all had such a nice Christmas and
would liked very much to have been there myself. I
knew, however, I would not get any rest if I came.
Elizabeth and I had a completely beautiful and restful
week in Nassau, and without it I don't know how my
spring would have been possible. I must say again,
however, that one of my reasons for not coming is your
invitation was not sufficiently general. bess is
staying with Rays and myself for the rest of the week
and will spend most of the time resting quietly at home
and working on her school papers. She was not very well
when she arrived but her cold is much better now. Don't
feel concerned about her.

A couple of enclosures will speak for themselves.
Give my love to Deannie and remember you fond son,

Alan
