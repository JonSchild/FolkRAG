2. Took Paul and Silas [and they] put 'em in the cave jail,
 Had no one to go their bail.

3. Paul & Silas they begin to shout,
Jail [doors] were opened and they walked out.

4. Peter was so nice & neat
Wouldn't let Jesus wash his feet,

5. Jesus said, "Wash them not,
You'll have no father in this lot."

6. Peter got anxious and Jesus said,
"Wash my feet, my hands & head."
