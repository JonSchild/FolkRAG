Indianapolis, Indiana.

Mr. Alan Lomax
c//o Dr. Stith Thompson
Atwater Avenue
Bloomington, Indiana.

My dear Mr. Lomax:

I have hurriedly prepared the enclosed memorandum, which I hope will be of some assistance to you. I believe that all of these people can be reached directly.

When you get in touch with Mr. Dixon, he will lead you to a number of other prospects. I have asked him to have a letter awaiting you at the postoffice in New Harmony advising just where and when he can be reached. He is teaching school somewhere in Posey County south of New Harmony. Please call for that letter.

When you get in touch with Mr. Merton Knowles (whom I long ago designated as "Old Sycamore of the Wabash"), he will lead you to a regular chorus of songsters and will sing quite a group of songs himself. I have asked him to have a letter awaiting you, general delivery, at the Attica postoffice, advising where and when you can get in touch with him.

I think Mrs. Kellams of Evansville can take you to some prospects. You will get in touch with her through the Central Library at Evansville. 

When you get to New Albany let me suggest that you call on Miss Iris Cook (residence, 619 West Spring Street; office, Third Flr. Courthouse). She is a field worker for Federal Writers' Project, and I think has some prospects in hand.

The office here is handicapped today in helping on this matter because of the fact that the regular file clerk is absent. I am unable to strike the trail of the old songster of the Predestinarian Baptist Church of Jesus Christ, but shall do so as soon as possible. I think it would be well worth your while to pay a visit to this office and go through the manuscripts on file here.

I should like very much indeed to go with you on this Hoosier round, and if you will stay long enough possibly I can connect with you somewhere. It has been a sincere pleasure to me to become acquainted with you, as well as with your father. Kindly extend my kindest personal regards to your father when you write him next.

With best wishes, I am

Yours truly,
Ross F. Lockridge
