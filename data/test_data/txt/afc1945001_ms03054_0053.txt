(9) I have heard from the manager of a chain of bureaus of
commerce in eastern Virginia that the merchants are complying
with price ceiling on commodities on which the price is
specifically controlled, while on non-essential articles they
have increased the sale price in many instances as much as 100%
so that they might boost their overall profit.
(10) In Newport News the manager of a Chamber of Commerce
says that the price ceiling on scarce commodities has not been
enforced. Bottled beer is one of these articles. Nowhere on
the peninsula can a 10¢ bottle of beer be purchased at that
price. All establishments now charge 15¢ for 10¢ beer and 20¢
for 15¢ beer. Some places they are charging 15¢ for a very small
container of draught beer where heretofore it was 10¢ and a larger 
container.
(11) I have heard that private enterprizes are saying:
"Why should we be required to invest 10% of our earnings in war
saving stamps if the major government agencies are not doing so.
When I asked what they meant by the major government agencies they
said that they meants the civilian personnel of the War Department
and the Navy and Post Office employees.
I, as chairman of the Federal Employees War Savings Staff
of Virginia, can personally state that there is some truth in
this rumor. In many instances the War Department assumes the
attitude that it is too busy to see that the campaign is properly
inaugurated in their civilian personnel. The same thing is true
