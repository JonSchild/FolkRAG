We were working as carpenters at the Madison airport, but they laid us off
when we caught up (to the crew ahead), but instead of hiring us back when
they were ready to go again, they got a whole new crew --- just so the 
union could get its 15 bucks out of each of the new workers. Yeah, the union does all the hiring, and have they a sweet racket!!
