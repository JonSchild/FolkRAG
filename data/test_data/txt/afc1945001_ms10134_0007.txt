Two marines are in the 
hospital one tells the other he is
angry because he just received
a letter from home and his girl
is married. The other replies that
he should be angry he just
received a letter from home and
his draft board "rejected him."

Six R.A.F. fliers and
one American go on a bombing
raid only to drop pamphlets over
Germany. The R.A.F. pilots returned
in 8 hours. Ten days later the
American returns. When the
commanding officer asks him
why it took him so long to drop
pamphlets, he replies,  "Drop them!
I've been sticking them under
the doors."

Drugstore--Approx age 20 six friends.
"I see the Germans are
chasing the Americans now"
"Yes but we'll get them,
look how we've been bombing
Germany!"
"That reminds me of a cute
joke I heard this summer
now that Hitler has lost Cologne-he
really stinks!"
