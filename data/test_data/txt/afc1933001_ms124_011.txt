expenses of his automobile during the duration of the trip. In addition, must 
be reckoned a certain sum for miscellaneous expenses which may amount to about
$100 for the trip. Under this heading would fall such items as the charging
of batteries, minor repairs to the recording machine, and, where necessary,
the reimbursement of singers. An advance of $100 will also be necessary to
enable him to carry on until the first vouchers will have been paid. I believe
that all expenses for this trip could be charged to the appropriation for the
increase of the library, with the exception of those for equipment which might
be charged to the appropriation for furniture.

Attached is a tentative plan for this trip which I asked Mr. Alan Lomax
to outline.
