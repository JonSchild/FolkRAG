Aug. 29th. Woke in Clarksdale. [checkmark]
waited on square for the Fisk
playboys for three hours.
It turned out later they'd slept 
in Memphis - no apologies.
Called on the sherrif
Greek P. Rice had clear, hard
blue eyes - a young & loud fellow -
a Southern gangster politician
Began by [asking [?]] saying,
"Well, if you begin any labor
trouble, we'll finish it -
acute shortage of labor here 
the boys running of to the
defense jobs - 
A boy later explained
that G. P. Rice had closed all the 
dance halls & whore houses &
gambling games & nobody couldn't
have no fun no more - have
to go to the plantations to git
a woman.
I gave the deputy
in Riceâ€™s office my name.
