Dear Alan Lomax -
A note in great haste - without syntax, effective phrase, or 
lineal ordering.
We shot on Sunday & the results, though far short of possibility,
are probably better than we had any right to expect or even hope.
That intangible but precious spontaneity that set the group apart
is largely lacking; too much light & too standard lighting were
used throughout; on the play-backs, the group went into
syncopation rather than straight sync - they 'responded' to their
own voices; etc., etc.
Still, we got 10,000' 35 mm b&w with, I would guess, every foot
technically good.  We had three cameras:  2 Arrifexes with blimps
on Crab dollies and a wild Eclipse that was used either on a Mitchel
head with a telephoto lens or shoulder-mounted with the cameraman
right in with the dancers.  For dances, we used the two Arriflexes
for the Master run, then all three cameras for three re-takes and 
finally the wild camera for a single take hand-held.  Thus ther are 
twelve 'camera' takes of each dance & fewer takes of
the songs.
Six songs were filmed:  Moses, Yonder Comes Day, Before This Time Another
Year, Down in the Mire, Buzzard Lupe, & Adam in the Garden
All twenty technicians were volunteers; most of the equipment was 'borrowed',
etc., etc., with the result that to date, expenses are almost
exactly $500.  Processing & w/p normally would run $1300 more, but
I will plead poverty & culture and ask for reduced rates, perhaps as low as
$800.
You will recall that under the terms of the original proposal, all rights
remained with the group, with the understanding that immediately after
the shooting you would decided whether to authorize us to complete the
film (under terms we discussed on the phone) or to turn the film over
to you at this time, with you reimbursing me for the $500.  Right
now I'm so tired I would be relieved if you decided on the second alternative,
though I suspect that the first (and Bess agrees) is more realistic.  We
can pull deals, borrow equipment, find volunteers, etc., in a way that 
someone not in this game 24 hours a day would find difficult.  However,
the decision is yours to make and I ask only that it be made as quickly as
possible, because the film does have to be processed within a matter of days.
Needless to say, if you decide to have us finish the film, we would hope,
expect, guidance from you.
Cordially,
Ted Carpenter
