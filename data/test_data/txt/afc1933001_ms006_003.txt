in recording the tunes Through
the use of the improved facilities
of the sound laboratory I believe
all the tunes that you wish
from our collection may
be transferred to permanent
records for the use of
the Library
        We are running behind
our schedule but for the
best of reasons We should
be in Baton Rouge by July 12
when we will test our
new machine before going
on Kindest regards to you
 Mr Putnam and all your force
who paid me kind attention
              Sincerely
               John A Lomax
