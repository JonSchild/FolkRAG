I Walked Her and I Talked Her
(A Li'l Cowboy Song)

This fine, rousing melody certainly comes from across the water.
A sea-chanty? A game-song? We have no idea, but Lead Belly,
knowing our partiality for cowboys, calls it a cowboy
song. Let it go at that. 

We attach the stanzas of "What Love Have Done," that Lead Belly had Martha write
out, that he says are part of this song, that can be sung
to the air if you take the trouble to stretch each couplet.
Neither Professors George Lyman Kittredge nor Hyder Rollins of Harvard
were able to identify this pretty lyric poem that deals,
as do many of Lead Belly's songs, with the
fickleness of friends, particularly girl
friends.

Walked her an' I talked her,
An' I turned her roun' an' roun',
Had my pistol, I would blow you down.

Walked her an' I talked her,
An' I turned her roun' an' roun',
Had my pistol, I would blow you down.
