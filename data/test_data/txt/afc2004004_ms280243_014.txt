The Broken Token: Jean Robertson sings Jean Ritchie's song.
1)  A pretty fair maid a-working in the garden,
When a bright young soldier came a-riding by.
He said, "Kind miss, don't you want to marry?
Or could you fancy such a one as I?" (2)

2) I have a true love in the army,
He's been in the army for seven long years.
And if he's gone some seven years longer,
Not a man on earth shall marry me. (2)

3)  "Well, maybe your true love has been drowned,
Or maybe he's lying on some battlefield slain.
Or maybe he's to some poor girl married
And ye may never see him again. (2)

4)  "Well, if he's dead, I hope he's happy,
And if he's lying on some battlefield slain.
And if he's too some poor girl married,
I will love the girl that married him."
