Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thank you for your letter of November 20th. We greatly appreciate 
what you are doing for us. 

As our film is nearing completion and we shall be ready to
record the sound by December 5th, we shall be very grateful 
if you can get the recording to us by that date. 

Sincerely yours,
Sheldon Dick
