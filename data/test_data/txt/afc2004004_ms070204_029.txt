from different ranches fot
when they wet in town to
determine which was the
best - shot out lights and when
the battle over lined up at
the bar & surveyed the damage -
heard cowboy songs but has
now forgotten them - left
when the barb wire fences came -
work lonely and dull, then,
and the bullets began to whistle
about your ears =
Worked in lumberwoods
for 40 years after that -
