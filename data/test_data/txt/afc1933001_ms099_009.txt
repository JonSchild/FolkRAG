Dear Mr. Lomax:
This is in answer to your letter of November 16 addressed to Mr. Clapp which I found awaiting my return from England. I am delighted to learn that you are willing to continue to record for us in accordance with the arrangements suggested by Mr. Clapp in a previous letter. If you will let us know at least a month in advance when you would like to start your expedition, we shall be glad to work up a project.
I agree with you that there may be great difficulties in attempts to record the Indians in Oklahoma and for that reason it might be better to operate in familiar fields in the southeast or perhaps attempt to collect western songs. On this matter, however, we shall of course be willing to accept your suggestions.
With kindest regards,
Sincerely yours,
Luther H. Evans
Librarian of Congress
