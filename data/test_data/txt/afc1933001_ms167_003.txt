Mr. Ivalee Hobden   -2-    2/3/41

About records, under separate cover I will forward you
a bibliography of cheap American records of folk songs,
most of the white stuff being done by contemporary singers
with whom your musicians are probably acquainted. I feel
that this list of records will be of great use to you and
I would like to recommend that you allow me to pick out
for you about ten Library of Congress original recordings,
have them copied and sent to you. Copies of these records
can be purchased at $1.50 each. This is for a 12-inch,
double-sided acetate.

I have discussed your project with my father who will be
back in Dallas in March and he has indicated his interest
in helping you out with consultation and advice if you
care to call him at his home.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge of the
Archive of American Folk Song
