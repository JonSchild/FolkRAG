English VI.
I. One high school girl talking to
one of her friends said: "I am
so mortified, mother's  a wacc,
Sis is a wave, and what are
we? Just plain girls".
II. Waccs, waves, soldiers, and 
sailors were in a park one day, 
when all at once they turned in
surprise as one wacc [?] yelled, 
"Look! a civilian".
