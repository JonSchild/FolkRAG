BREAK DOWN BARRIERS

(Page 3 - Y.W.C.A. Song Book)

O world of industry from sea to sea,
Filled with barriers of race and creed,
O loving neighbors, hear our plea
in this age of strife and greed.

Chorus: Break down barriers, change our thoughts
With the help of the One above
Break down barriers, change our thoughts,
Help widen the reach of love.

Father of Mercies help us to find 
'Monst the people of every land,
The loving brotherhood of mankind
And help us understand.

Chorus: Break down barriers, change our thoughts,
With the help of the One above
Break down barriers, change our thought
Help widen the reach of love.

BROTHERHOOD

(Page 179-Tune: "Dire Wacht am Rhein"
Old Favorite Songs, -Wanamaker-)

The crest and crowning of all good 
Life's final star is Brotherhood;
For it will bring again to earth
Her long-lost Poesy and Mirth.
'Twill bring new light to every face,
A kindly power upon the race;
And till it comes, we men, we men are slaves
And travel downward to the dust of graves.

Come, clear the way, then clear the way,
The fear of kinds has had it day.
Break the dead branches from the path,
Our hope is in the aftermath
Our hope is in heroic men
Star-led to build the world again.
To make this event the mighty ages run.
Make way for Brotherhood;
Make way for Man.
