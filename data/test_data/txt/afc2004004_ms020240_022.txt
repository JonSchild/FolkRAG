AL:  I don't think it happens so much up here in the North, as
much as it does in the South.
BJ:  Oh, maybe it don't.
AL:  That's what I'm saying.
BJ:  Oh!  I don't know where it happens all right, but I know
it happens.  An' I know...
AL:  What are they interferin' with your business for?
BJ:  Well, who knows?  Just jealousry (sic).  You know, everybody
[have,] ah, is not, uh, uh, a friend that claims they a friend.  That's
that's what that dream mean.  You know, an' then spyin' on
your business, a whole lot a times peoples'll just git wich ya an'
git in ya conversation, jes', ya know?, jus' try ta find out cum-
pin' about ya.  Then go an', you know, carry it out.  So.  If you
ain't got no better sense'n to tell 'em.  An' ah, sumpin'
like that.
     An' then there' some folks envy peoples, you know.
So that's a diffrunt in it, you know, when ya envy peoples.  See?
     An' some have revileations. (REVILEMENT)
TL:  Hum?
BJ:  Said a lot a peoples have revile-ations, ya know?
TL:  What are those?
BJ:  That's, that's against you; that's revile-ations.  An' ya know
they tell you one thing an' then tell somebody else another, ah,
concernin' about you, you see?  An', an' that's what that is;
that's revile-atin'.  They go out an', you know, out' an talk
about, "I like him, but...I found out so-an'-so about her, but..."
This-that-an'-the-other about, you know, "But."  they put a conjunction
in it.  An' then carry your name an' come back to you so
nice an' good.  An' carry -- an' go out an' revile-ate you.  You
see, in that way.
