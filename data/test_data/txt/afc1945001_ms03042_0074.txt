- 16 -   Rumors, 8-9 to 8-15 New York   8-18-42

New York 8-11 (Negro): "The Japanese have made big new submarines
that each carry a plane.  They will sneak up and bomb all California.  Then
we will be invaded."

New York 8-9 (German-American):  "The Army and Navy are fighting
between themselves in Alaska.  No wonder they cannot keep the Japs away."

Brooklyn 8-14 "Wait until the WAAC women come back from the
Army posts to have children.  Then we'll understand why they are in the 
Army."

New York 8-12 (Businessman): "If I wasted money in my business
the way the OPA does here in New York, I would go bankrupt.  Why they're
paying my former bookeeper over twice what I paid him, and I paid generously."
