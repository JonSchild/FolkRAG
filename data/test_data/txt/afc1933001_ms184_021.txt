Dear Mrs. Jakobson:

I was very greatly interested by the outline of your 
work you presented to me. As a matter of fact, I discussed
it in a seminar here at the University of Indiana in Field 
Collecting. Since I am going into the field now for about
a month, I have forwarded your letter to Dr. Charles Seeger
at the Pan-American Union at his request. At the time you
were in Washington, he thought that your project would be 
of interest to the musicology committee of the American
Council of Learned Societies. I hope, too, that if something 
does come of this project, it will be possible for
the Library of Congress to cooperate. If you have not heard
from Dr. Seeger within the next few weeks, write me care
of the Library. 

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
