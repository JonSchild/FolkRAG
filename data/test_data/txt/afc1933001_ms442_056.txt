One of these mornin's sun refuse to shine,
An' I'm goin' back, Lawd, to that gal of mine.

If that's your woman, better pin her to your side,
I I got a dollar I know she gonna let me [by.] by.

If that's your man, better pin him to your side,
If I get a dollar, you gonna let me [by.] by.

If that's your woman, you better buy you a lock an' key,
Get a lock an' key to keep her 'way from me.
