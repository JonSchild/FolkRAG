[*Pitching*]
sometimes you've gotta, you gotts sharp, sharpen it and make it higher or make
it lower . . ."  Each part to get their part. You know the bass is a low
part and the treble is kinda the high part. So where the notes runs, how
they run on the staff, that's how you pitch the music. He says, "You
pitch where the low part can get there . . .                   and not a dragout,
and the high part can get there without a scream, then you've got your
song pitched right." So I learned to look at a song, tell how high it
run, if it runs, how high it runs on the second octave--that there is
. . .            degrees, eight with a double on the first one in eight (?)
And then I try to pitch the song with that. If I have to make it sharp,
I'll raise, I'll make it a little sharper than what's it written in.
Say it's written in F, I'll make it F#, or somethin' like that.
     A lot of people can't do that.
     A lot of people can't do that. I don't believe that anybody, I don't
believe there's anybody can do it everytime they try, either. You're
gonna miss one sometimes.
     Hard to do.
     It's hard to do. You're gonna miss one sometimes. But, uh, . .
     You do a lot of pitching in the church, don't you? for other singers
who can't do it.
     Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. There's not very many, there's not very many
people, but there is, there's a lot of people that can pitch that don't
pitch. I don't know why they don't, but they can do it, but they don't
do it. I reckon they're 'fraid maybe they'll make a boggle of it by
not bein' used to it. The more practice you get the better you are at 
it, at anything, you know. And then there's . . .
always somebody with more experience . . .                as a singer.   . . .
