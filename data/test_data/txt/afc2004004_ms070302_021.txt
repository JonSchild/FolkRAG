Jumping the Juniper

The groom [up] over the juniper 
-- 3 or 4 feet
Single men in one side 
Mar men on the other --
They all had their gd rules
The nipper gettin married
wd have to stand the single 
men's side & he'd say
"Yg men & maidens I'm 
bidding you adieu 
Old men & Nancy I'm 
comin over to you
With that he jumped over 
the juniper -- & the boys 
smacked his behind
-
After the wedding, they'd 
take the bride & bri groom
