Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was so much taken with there recent Victor album of Smoky
Mountain Ballads that I decided LIFE should do a story about the 
singers and the way their songs were collected.  I wrote to Victor,
but they could five me very little information, and suggested I 
write you.  I would like to know some details about the individual 
performers, where they live and what they do, what kind go local 
color we could work into a photographic story.  For instance, I take 
it that the Skillet Lickers are a local hoedown outfit, and that the 
Carter Family perhaps sings for small churches in the south.  We could
follow them up n this way.  What kind of a personality is Uncle Dave Macon?
and the genius, Dixon, who sings Intoxicated Rat?

These records are so wonderful that I have already persuaded 
several of my friends to get the set on faith. Among these are editors,
writers and photographers on LIFE and FORTUNE.  I have just talked to the 
Music Editor of TIME, Carl Carl Balliett, who regrets he was away when this 
set came out, as he is very much interested in this kind of music and
would have like to give the set a good notice. 

Incidentally, I am sorry the Victor did not include words
for the songs, Do you have them? 

In the story I have in mind we would be able to branch out and
take in the whole field of recorded folk music, including other 
companies.  Decca, Okeh, and other outfits have recorded a great
deal of good stuff, I'm told. 

Years ago, before radio corrupted the popular record business,
I collected records of this kind.  I have some old records I wouldn't 
swap for 20 of the newer ones (except the Smoky Mountain sett--they 
are genuine).  I refer to such things as B.F. Shelton singing "Pretty Polly",
and Kelly Harrell's great "Oh, the Cuckoo".  The latter, I have learned
lately, comes right our of Mother Goose. 

I have and enjoy the Lead  Belly and John Jacob Niles songs
that are available. 

But I started to write a request for information for a story.
Do you suppose you could help me get started?  I can assign a photographer 
when I have a little more information. 

Sincerely yours
/s/ ROBER BUTTERFIELD (National Affairs Editor) 

P.S.  -- Are you going to follow up the Smoky Mountain set with more
of the same. Our news angle on the story could be the recording of 
a new set.  Also, what activities do you and your father have in mind. 
during the next few months that would be interesting in such a story?  ?
