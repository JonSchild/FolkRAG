Rumor is a much abused word with many meanings.
We will not try to provide a final definition, but
rather focus on those aspects of greatest importance for an
informational program.

Rumor is a popular report, the common talk
-- common talk related to the war effort is
our concern.

Rumor is a report current without any known authority
for its truth

-- a report without reference to authority is usually
difficult to verify and more likely to undergo
distortion than reports when authority is
cited (this is hypothesis).

Basically we want to know how people are
feeling about the war efforts.  We may use what they
are saying as a clue.  We cannot record and 
analyze everything they say, let us focus on those
things they say spontaneously about the war effort which they
considered relatively authentic but for which no authority
is cited.  We may approach what is said 
[thru a] directly by attempts to record material our
observers here or indirectly by finding out what
people have heard and use this as a key since
someone else said it.  The indirect method has 
a source of error:  A may have reported item M to B who is
interviewed.  A may have cited source, B forgotten it.  We cannot
assume B will necessarily retell it; therefore the indirect
method taps what might be "latent" rumors, a larger
reservoir than those current.  Let us therefore keep
the two sources separate for analysis.

May we say to hell with assigned authority and cherish truth, defining
"truth" as consonant with reports carried by AP-VP or major radio
commentators during [period] functional period (2 weeks before, during, 1 week after)?
