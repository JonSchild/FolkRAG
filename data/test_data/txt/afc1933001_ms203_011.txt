Friday P.M.
Dear Alan:
Several days ago I had occasion to go to Cleveland
Public Library (by the way, it's one of the country's best) and
I paused before a shelf of books conspicuously marked "The
World's Greatest Books" and suddenly a very familiar name met
my eyes (you are not to assume that I was entirely unfamiliar
with all the others). The name was yours. Of course, I cannot 
tell whether the book was carelessly placed there by some lazy 
reader of whether it was done by the library. I prefer to think
the latter.
Anyway, seeing the book there brought you rather forcibly 
to my mind and then I started thinking that it has been an awfully
long time since I've seen you or heard from you. Of course, I've
heard you on the air but that lacked the personal touch and didn't 
tell me how you were, what you're doing, thinking, dreaming, etc.
Last spring, one of my musical friends here told me that 
you were scheduled to appear at a convention here in Cleveland.
I eagerly scanned the program, dashed up to the Hotel Statler at
about the hour you were scheduled to speak and hung around for
sometime, but neither hide nor hair of your could I find. I reluctantly
came to the conclusion that you did not come to Cleveland
or you would have found five minutes to telephone me to say "hello."
