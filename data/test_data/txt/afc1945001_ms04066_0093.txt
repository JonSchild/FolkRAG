Kansas City, August 4 ---- They're too wishy-washy 
back there in Washington about dealing with these eight saboteurs 
captured on the East Coast. They waste too much 
time in legal technicalities. What the public wants is 
swift and sure punishment and wants it done by the regular 
method of army court marshal. [*11*]
