considerable time there, and is fluent/in French, I don't know how much luck he 
would have. The priests would help; but I don't know how long Alan could stand 
the almost medieval Catholic atmosphere! The University of Missouri published
a thesis by a young man now on their Romanic Languages staff whose name I don't
have at hand -- on French survivals in and around Ste. Genevieve. I talked to
him and he told the unusual tale about the infinitude of pains necessary to disarm
suspicion; but I suspect that was chiefly the result of his rather scholarly,
muscle-bound appearance. If Alan can speak French and picks up dialects
easily I'd love to see him turned loose there, and I doubt if he'd have to
pretend to be a wood-cutter or ditch digger, or whatever this U. of Mo. fellow
did, I forget. The latter is no help, he wants to do further work himself and
rather rudely failed to believe I could possibly resist the temptation to publish
his rare and wonderufl material if he put me in touch with it once; but
Father van Tourenhout, (or Monsignor van T--, rather, as he now is,) does n't
have this point of view, though he likes the U. of Mol. young man very much .....
I don't even know whether Monsignor Van Tourenhout speaks any English; but I
suppose he must, as he's worked in this country for years. He is a marvelous
old party and he and his community deserve a book to themselves.

I envy Alan so much the opportunity to dig in as deeply as he likes in one community —
I got awfully tired of skimming the surface as I did. It was a priceless
experience for a while, but enough is enough already yet.

Tornadoes, floods and suddent bequests from foundations aside, I still want awfully
to get back to Wisconsin. I spent a week there in September and located a lot
more of the older singers. I noted down about 40 songs sung by a youth whose
singing, while good of its kind, is much more regular in form than that of the
older men from whom, for the most part, he learned the songs. I suspected this
but was unable to contact the older men and hear them sing until after I had returned
the recorder; and they get impatient so easily I did n't dare try to note
down any but a very few things whose irregularities were not too complex for me
to handle on paper. It seems awfully important to me to get records of these
old boys; and I would like to have time to record the singing of the same songs
by each of 3 generations. The best time to work there, from their point of
view, is before the thaw in March. I have set aside enough money to pay my
travel back there, in the hopes that eventually the Library might be able to
keep me going once I got there --- and I would like to go the end of December.
My difficult friend Miss Edgar has n't run down yet, with her Finns, Norwegians,
etc., and she will lead me to more material I am sure, (eaven help
me!) I found, incidentally, two rare ballads, Captain Wodderburn's Courthkip
(nearly complete) and King John and the Bishop of Canterbury, in Wisconsin ....
but unfortunately after the recorder had been returned. Are you in any
better position than you were to get this work done? by any chance? Also, Henry
Cowell gave me names and addresses of a Tahitan group near San Fransisco, a
Korean group, and a lot of Icelanders; also a member of the royal family of
Hawaii who was taught some of the ceremonial chants known only to the royal
family and which she will be glad to record. He had been nursing these people
along and they were just 'ripe,' he said, when he was interrupted. He urged
me to go after them at once, and said they'd sing twice, once for a record for
him which he would supply. But where am I to get some blanks and a little
travel allowance? Mostly in California I can either camp or stop with friends;
but even so, needs must buy gas, etc., and shoes.. tires, I am. I have nailed
some Basques around Stockton but doubt if they will sing without being paid - I
am informed they are sure to demand money. I take no responsibility for the
Basque temerament and will cheerfully pay them, or at least tip them well — if
I have some money! (Usually paying for songs or singing goes much against my
conscience.) I am going to be very busy transcribing songs against the probable
arrival in Calif. of Ernest Bloch who will I am sure check the transcriptions
for me (failing E.B. I'll ask Henry Eichheim) and preparing some articles maybe,
