She's having last year's laugh's
cry-
the sun wouldn't shine on me
nor a bird wouldn't sing to
me in [Glengariffe] Glengarriffe
no more- if I [de] did the
like of that .

Faction fights, delight in. 
People told to quit or leave land.
Deepened loyalty to kinsman, even if
the workhouse was a consequence .

Sean Mor Lacy- powerful man -
"Two o'clock & not a blow struck 
yet - his cry. He apologized about being
late to a faction fight. He'd met a 
bull; never passed a bull without fighting 
it.

Cat called Moonlighter who
always joined in a patriotic scrap
"We'll plant a tree in Oald Ireland."
