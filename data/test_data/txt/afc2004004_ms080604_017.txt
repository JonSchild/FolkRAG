J.S.:
I just stayed behind him and cried.
(laugh)

W.S.H:
(laughs)  Oh, sure!

J.S.:
And I sung that little song, I said:

Six months, ain't long, sinners-
Two years ain't no time.
Me and my poor ol buddy,
We have ninety-nine.
(speaking:)
-And one morning, boy, that old man took pity
on me; say, "I beleive I let this ol black boy go free".  So
one Sunday morning -- I thought he was calling.  I was gettin
dressed to go -ah, I used to gamble back in them days.  And. . .
I was goin on -gambling. .  to the end of the porch, as far as we
could go, and he called my number.  I say, "Uh-oh", so I knew
I was goin to get another whipping now. (laughs)   I went back
and seed whether he was calling me -- ("Little Greenwood",
Little Green One?) .  He said "Little Greenwood", say, he
say, "You got any (clothes packed down!?), that you want to
carry home?, carry home with you?"   I told 'im, say, "Yes, sir!,
(unintelligible)".  He say, "you go git 'em."   I say, "Uh-oh,
I better go now".   I done made a pretty good record there.
He said, "Little Greenwood", say, "You're too good a nigger
to be harbored down, I'm gonna let you go free this Sunday
morning".  Oh, boy!  When he hollered me out, the whole camp
stood up, right off the highway (high ridge?) there, and I
feeled kinda funny, strange- walkin out there, among all
those prisoners- none of em goin with me.  They didn't know
I was goin, and I didn't know.  Then I hollered that ol
song about . . .
(begins singing) :

Oo-oo-oo, boy!,
In the world again.

Boy if I ever, whoa, get lucky,
In the world again.

I ain't gon fool with no mo bad women,
Just a mighty few men.
(speaking:)
That'all, I left that (unintelligible), boy
but I was glad to go.
