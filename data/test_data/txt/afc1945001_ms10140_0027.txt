1. They don't need much money because their standards
of living is low.  I suppose they could buy meats
selling at 35[cents] a lb for 15[cents] a lb and a good dress for
$1.00
2.  I wonder if Crispus Attucks belongs to another race.
     Was he a negro?
3.  Discrimination?  I know that word is included
     in every negroes' vocabulary.
4.  I know we can't do nothing because Daro Miller
     fell asleep when the Japs attacked Pearl Harbor.
5.  I heard they were not going to let him be armed
     in the Army.  Who is him & why.  He is a negro.  The
     reason is the fear of his letting the enemies in for
     a meal.
6.  Are the Negroes flying?  No I guess they are [being].
