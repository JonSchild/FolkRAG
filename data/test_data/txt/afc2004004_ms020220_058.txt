both his feet! Throom! Hah, ha, ha, ha! Right out on the flo'. 
An' that bed was high to hit that flo'. Wham! Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Right on his face. He didn't have time to know...He didn' have
turn over!
But anyway, that's the only thing I seen happen -- you know, 
like that -- in our house!
TL: This was all out in Dawson?
BJ:  All in Dawson, yeah, Lawd!  All in Dawson, Georgia, when I
was small.  That was funny.  I ain' never seen nothin'. . .Nothin'
bad.
     An' other neighbors, around, the same way.  You know, they
don't -- If I'm around someone an' somethin', you know, that they
[can't] carryin' on or sayin' or figurin' to do or some kinda
'spute (dispute), "You chilren git away from here," see?  "You
children go on."  So that's jus' the way it was.  Everybody hope
(helped) everybody raise their chilren, ya see?

BJ:  Umm, no.  I, I guess a lot of 'em did, ya know.  But I
wa'n' that way.  But there is been some very cruel raisin' peoples --

know peoples have to go to 'em an' talk to 'em.  Tyin' the
chilren [an'] in sacks an', you know, hangin', hangin' 'em up
an' all like that an' whippin' 'em an' all like that, see?  There
have, there have been a lot of that carryin' on, but I never
whupped. . .'Cause they never. . .[But] in other words, in the neighborhood
