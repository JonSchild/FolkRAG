COTTON MILL COLIC
(First stanza with music.)
When you go to work you work like the devil
At the end of the week you re not on the level.
Pay day comes, you pay your rent,
When you get through you've not got a cent
To buy fat-back meat, pinto beans,
Now and then you get turnip greens.
No use to colic every day at noon
The kids get to crying in a different tune.
I'm a-goin' to starve, everybody will,
Cause you can't make a livin' in a cotton mill.
Twelve dollars a week is all we get 
How in the heck can I live on that?
I got a wife and fourteen kids
We all got to sleep on two bedsteads.
Patches on my breetches, hole in my hat,
Ain't had a shave since my wife got fat.
No use to colic, they're all that way,
Can t get the money to move away.
I'm a-goin' to starve, everybody will,
Cause you can't make a livin' in a cotton mill.
They run a few days, and then they stand,
Just to keep down the working man.
I'll never make it, I never will,
As long as I work in a lousy mill.
The poor are gettin' poorer, the rich are gettin' rich,
If I don t starve, I'm a son of a gun.
No use to colic, no use to rave,
We'll never rest till we're in our grave.
If I don t starve nobody will,
Cause you can't make a livin' in a cotton mill.
