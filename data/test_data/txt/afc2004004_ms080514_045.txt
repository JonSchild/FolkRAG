A     (continued) 
poverty life on the plantation with the - 
where they were paid ah - maybe made in cash
$50 a year, and the work on the levy camps
maybe $15 a week at the maximum for a 14 hour
day, ah, families broke up and relations
between ah men and women were strained, and
the blues came out of that.  Ah, songs like
Love Oh Love, Oh Careless Love.  And um, one - 
some of the great poetry, um, ironic poetry
[*04 . 08 . 36 . 03*]   of the - of mankind, ah, came out then.

Ah, when a, when a woman gets blue she hangs
her little head and cries.  But when a man
gets blue, he grabs a train and rides. 

[*?*]
And that was ah, ah, that was part of the 
irony.  And they personfied the blues.  Ah, 
good morning, blues - blues, how do you do.
He says I'm feeling mightywell, but pardner,
how about you? 

The blues come from Texas, the loping like a
mule.  Oh the, the blues jumped a rabbit, and
running a solid mile, and -but when the blues
overtaken him, poor rabbit cried like a baby
child.
