by Seamus & will cover the Hebrides &
Gaelic speaking Ireland -- here we might
begin with a Glasgow song in English
and (or) one from Argylshire.  Probably
there I'll use bugle.  Finally, the last
program will deal with traveling people
-- tinkers, gypsies, etc. --- from all
over. [this] This is for you & Pete --
& [will] here you should reserve the best
things from The Stewarts, from Sutherland,
etc-- that have to do with gypsies.

A most important point,  however.
Have the singers yet been paid? The budget
on the program is very low & can't be
stretched.  If they have not been paid,
what will their fees run?  You must calculate
this when you do your choosing.
Also the records must be first-rate accoustic
ally.  We are also limited on dubbing
time-- in fact on everything.
