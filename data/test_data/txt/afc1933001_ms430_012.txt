LABOR LIMERICKS

10.

Why not run a Limerock Contest? We
Suggest that you print the first one
in full as a sample and then omit the
last line on the others, asking your
members to send in their versions.
The best of these may be printed in a
subsequent issue of your journal.
Point out that in a limerick, the last 
line must be like the first and second
in meter and in rhyme.

#1. If to speak at meetings you yearn,
'This well public speaking to learn;
Lest when you take the floor,
The whole crowd should roar,

"Mr. Chairman, I move we adjourn!"

#2. Hurray, our strike is won!
The sweatshops on the run.
With our union strong
We'll march along...

..............................................

#3. Behold the inglorious scab
Who tried strikers' job to grab.
But the entrance was blocked
By pickets who mocked.
