out in the mountains.  we all had a drink outa that, two moonshiners, 
four of us, made six of us, two of them and four of us.  And us four 
had bought a quart apiece.  Well we [play edz stay ed] played there a[l] long 
time until I finally got tired and I decided there was a big [beer] 
beech tree and there was a lot of dead stuff on [it and] the inside it 
was holler.  I [deiced] deicided I'd put a match in there and make 
a fire and kinda warm [us. I told] a little.  I'm thin blooded 
anyhow, you know.  I told 'em I was.  They [was] wanted me to set
 down an' talk.  See they don't see many people back there, only somebody 
huntin' whiskey.  That's their livin' is somebody huntin' 
whiskey an' spendin' a dollar with 'em.  But I was thin blooded 
and I wanted to keep walkin' and [git] keep warmed up, you see.  There 
was a little snow on, too.  So we kep' on goin'.  I mean we kep' on 
workin' aroun' there, you know, [*I kep' on walkin'*] /roun' an' roun' talkin' [to]with 'em.  
They didn't pay me much mind.  They had all got interested in 
a subject, 'bout moonshiners....
