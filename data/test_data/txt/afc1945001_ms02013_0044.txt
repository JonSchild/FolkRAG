MINNESOTA

Rumors regarding rationing are extensively current--
motor oil stocks being latest product mentioned.
These stories often appear at conventions.  A rumor that Lloyds of London
was offering odds that war would be over in six months circulated in
Minneapolis and St. Paul to such an extent that a State OCD official
mentioned in an address that it was probably Axis inspired to reduce war
production.  Other stories repeated to but a limited extent are:  That
England is playing us for the goat; that Russia will sue for peace; that
an Allied win will sweep Communism over the world; the stock "postage
stamp-tongue cut off" tale; that Red Cross workers are overpaid and
avoid battlefield dangers; that rationing and labor-management committees
are not war essentials, but Socialist ground work.  Information that war
plant workers are making exorbitant wages and that war industries are
amassing huge profits is extensively repeated and is making something of
an impression on general public.

MISSISSIPPI

There is no evidence of rumors of any consequence.  Editorials are warning against obstructionist spirit which is manifesting itself.

MISSOURI

State has its share of rumors, most of which are
believed to originate in New York and Pacific Coast.
Publicizing of total British losses has done much to dispel rumors that
Allies are fighting Britain's battles even though Anglophobes continue
to spread anti-British stories.  A variation of an old story is that
New York bookmakers are taking even money on war being ended before
December 1942 despite long range plans of Allies.  A businessman told
the story at a luncheon-club meeting, to point out absurdity of some
rumors when analyzed, and cautioned gathering to think through every
story, determine source and decide whether it is a rumor.  Rationing
has been subject to rumors of may kinds.  Press is not entirely blameless,
since some papers have printed fanciful stories tending to create confusion.
State Director says:  "If there is any one thing which would
do more than anything else to solidify the American people, it would be
an official source of war information with the strictest sort of regulations
restricting distortion or garbling."

MONTANA

Most widespread rumor is that the bulk of our Navy
was destroyed at Pearl Harbor, and this emanates
from Navy circles.  There are horror stories of brutalities practiced
on captured American soldiers at the Pacific outposts.
