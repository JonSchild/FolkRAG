THE VAGABOND SONG (or)
THE 3-4-9 SONG

Sons of shot and powder,
Sing your praises louder,
3-4-9 ARTILLERY!
Watch our man-made thunder,
Blast that line asunder,
3-4-9 ARTILLERY!
Forward! Forward!
Charge against the foe!
Onward! Onward!
The Red Guidon will go.
3-4-9 we hail you!
We will never fail you!
Carry on to VICTORY.

Tune; Tavern in the Town [*11*]
There's a barracks on the hill,
quarry hill,
O - wouldst that I could be there still,
be there still,
And drink my beer with friends so very true. [*244 22*]
Three forty-nine, I'll always think of you.

Fare thee well - now I must leave thee -
Ever will this parting grieve me;
Now I'll remember that 'ol pal of mine,
pal of mine!
Adieu, Adieu, kind friend Adieu,
Yes Adieu!
The swamps now call me far from you,
far from you.
My heart hangs high upon Sill's quarry hill.
O 3-4-9 here's a toast to thee.

AIN'T GONNA STUDY WAR NO 'MO [*227 13*]
Gonna lay down my burdens
Down by the Riverside
Down by the Riverside.
Gonna lay down my burdens
Down by the Riverside
To study war no 'mo.

CHORUS

I ain't gonna study war no 'mo;
I ain't gonna study war no 'mo;
I ain't gonna study war no 'mo; (Repeat)  [*20*]

Gonna lay down my sword and shield
Down by the Riverside,
Down by the Riverside.
Gonna lay down my sword and shield
Down by the Riverside
To study war no 'mo.

CHORUS

HALLELUJAH! [*6*]

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Helps you shoo the blues away.
When cares pursue you - Hallelujah! [*435 19*]
Gets you through the darkest day.
Satan lies awaiting and creating
Skies of gray.
Sing Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Helps to shoo the clouds away.
