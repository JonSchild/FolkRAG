"Also, look at our vulnerability.  A small squad of parachute troops
could take over this town without a bit of trouble, just take the
water, lights, and gas and shut off transportation with a few men to
hold them.   We have no defense.   Oh, I hear that some of the utilities
have a few guards, but nothing real in the way of protection."
