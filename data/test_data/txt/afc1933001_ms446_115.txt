I told the undertaker
Please drive slow,
For this body you are hauling
Lord, I hate to see her go

I will follow close behind her, 
I was trying to be brave, 
But I could not hide my sorrow,
When they laid her in the cold, cold clay.

4
I went back to my home so lonesome
Since my mother has been gone
Oh, my brothers, sisters crying,
For my mother since she's been gone.
