Dear Duncan:

One of my current projects is a book on a Kentucky Mountain ballad-singing family with repertoire that runs into several hundred songs, a family which was a source for Sharp and many collectors.

Jean Ritchie, the best of the singers of the young generation of Ritchies, is collaborating on the book, and she will spend a month in the mountains this summer with a tape recorder collecting songs, reminiscences, etc. The book will set the extensive Ritchie repertoire in a context of family history and personal experience.

Can the Library furnish the tape for this job? Twenty reels of 1/2- hour tapes should do it. In return, Miss Ritchie and I will deposit these tapes in the Archive with a restriction that allows us ample time to finish the book. It's going to be a humdinger. 

Can you let me know about this within the next week? Jean leaves New York on the 10th of June. 

                                                       With best regards, 
                                                       Alan Lomax
