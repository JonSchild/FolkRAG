San Antonio, August 3     [*Horowitz*]

In 6 months prices will rise to unpredictable heights. Informant 
stated he plans to sell his house in El Paso, then plans to buy a house 
here at once in order that he can take advantage of present prices and 
comparatively low monthly payments. He doesn't know just what will happen 
but in about 6 months a great deal more spiraling of prices will have taken 
place according to his informants, and the Manpower Commissioner or some 
other governmental authority will have practically dictatorial power over 
business and labor. Inflation will be rapid and cannot be stopped unless 
the present laws and the OPA are given more power and "smarter" men are
placed in second line jobs. [*38*]
