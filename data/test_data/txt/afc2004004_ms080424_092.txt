TAPE:
Roll 61  Stan and Hattie  3
(Stan)  you can look him in the face.  He's a very nice little kitty cat and I
really like it.
AL:  Where did you find it?
Stan:  I found him here on my place, years ago.  I let this guy have him, he
wanted 'em all.  I let him have him, and he was very clever to let me have
him back to, you know, he's a nice guy, so. . . .   All these animals around here
that I've showed you have come off of this farm, my farm here.  I don't
get too many of 'em, I don't have that much time.  So I'll set him down right
here,. . . .very nice family of 'em, real nice family.
AL:  Where is that snake you showed me, Stanley?
Stan:  The serpent?  It's down in the shop, it's got duct over it hangin' in there.
I'm aimin' to give it to you, you can take it home with you.  It's
not finished up, go back to the back of the shop and you'll see it hanging up. . .
Right here is what the Bible reads about.  This is a sourwood(?) root(?), but
it's a serpent, come up out of the ocean and it pestered the men to death.
I'll turn it around and let you look at it, and then I'll show you the whole
details.  Now you can see that side there, you see that horn right up there
on it?  You see that horn there.  So, right here a stinger on its tail, that's
a stinger, right here on his tail.  Now right here, that's the man right there
you see. . . .you're looking at him right good there you know.  And right in there
now is the women, you see, that's what pestered the men to death, you see.
He couldn't go along with it, and that's the reason why it pestered, you know
when it come up out of that.  Now this here's his tail -- all the way back's
his tail.  If you get in the Bible, look, it speaks about a serpent a comin'
up out of the ocean, pesterin' the men.  So this is him, right here. . .he is a 
pretty bad lookin' vermant to me!  That'll be him, I'll set him right down. . . .
