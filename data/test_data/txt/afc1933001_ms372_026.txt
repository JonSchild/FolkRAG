Cal Harlan was my Brother.
also Eugene Harlan, and 
Dan Kelly. Married my sister 
Lulu Harlan, so you can see 
[tham] that I am pretty well along
in life, about 82 years. Dan Kelley
brought the words that Dr Higley
had composed, down to the Harlan 
Farm, near Harlan, Kansas, 
and he sang the song, and Cal 
and Eugene Harlan played the 
accompaniment on the violin and 
guitar. and my sister Lulu sang 
with him. and I was about 9 
years old. and I heard them, 
and have known the song ever since.
Hope these words will be  
be a help to you.
      Yours truly,
Mrs Virginia Harlan Barr.
