BJ TAPE 26, p. 2

BJ:   Oh-ha!  I forgot about that! (MACHINE TURNED OFF, THEN:)
TL:   Okay, so, "There Is More Love Somewhere."
BJ:    Let's see, can I tryin' to get it straight.
TL:   Where did you learn this, Bessie?
BJ:    Oh I learned it years ago down in Florida somewhere.
It's just -- it's one a our songs, that's all.

[*SONG*]
THERE IS MORE LOVE SOMEWHERE
(THIS SONG TRANSCRIBED EARLIER THAN THE DIALOGUE AND MAY BE FOUND IN THE FILES)

TL:   I just found me my song.
BJ:   I love that song, too.
TL:   Bessie, what do you reckon love is?
BJ:   Huh?
TL:   What do you reckon love is?
BJ:   What it is?
TL:   What is love?
BJ:   You mean to say you married an' don't know what love is?
Hah, hah, hah, hah! (SOFTLY)
TL:   You tell me.
BJ:   (LAUGHS SOFTLY AGAIN) Oh, Lord!
TL:   What's it all about.
[*LOVE*]
BJ:    Well, love is just a hidden mystery, within' your heart.
It's care; it's peace; it's happiness, an' joy. In other words,
it's straight confidence.
TL:    Confidence?
BJ:    Yeah. If you, if you don't have no confidence, you ain't 
got no love.
TL:    At all.
