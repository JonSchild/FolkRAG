There'll be light at the river for me. 

3 

When the end is nearing, what a joy to know, 
That the Lord will my helper be; 
Through the dark cold waters I can gladly go.  
There'll be light at the river for me. 

No.  15     This World is Not My Home 

This world is not my home, I'm just passing thru, 
My treasure and my hopes are all laid up on high,
Where many friends and kindred have done gone before, 
And I can't feel at home in this world, in this world
anymore. 

CHORUS 

"O Lord, you know I have no friend like you; 
If heaven were not my home, O Lord, what would I 
do? 
Loved ones beckon me from heaven's welcome door,
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. 

2 

Over in heaven's land, there'll be no dying there; 
The saints are shouting victory, singing everywhere. 
I hear the voice of those that I have known before 
And I can't feel at home in this world, in this world
anymore. 

3 

I won't have long to wait, my work is nearly done, 
I'm happy because my race is nearly run; 
I've long had my eyes on heaven's open door,
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
