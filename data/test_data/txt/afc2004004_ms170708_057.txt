HI
Harry Cox (undated tape of Peter Kennedy's. London)
Cox: (fiddle tune)
Kennedy: What do you call that, Harry?
Cox: Oh, I don't know what you call it. That's a horn - that's
a tune - some kind of a - a hornpipe of some kind. That's
a tune that an old chap used to paly, an' me father - they
used to play it. I never could get that proper. I - I - not
like - he could. (more fiddle music)
Kennedy: Have another go at it, Harry. You nearly got it then.
Douglas Kennedy: That's very good, yes. . .(mumble)
Kennedy: You nearly got it then.
Cox: (laughs) (more fiddle) I can't get it. I can't get the
touch o' that, proper.
Kennedy: Do you play the one about the ploughboy, Harry? I'd
love to hear that tune.
Cox: (fiddle tune) I get mixed up with it.
Kennedy: Have another go. You nearly got it.
Cox: I - I thought I had. . .
D. Kennedy: You haven't got enough room, have you?
Cox: (fiddle music) That's a little better.
Kennedy: That's very good.
Cox: Not much. (laughs) He used to have a lot o' different
tunes he used to play. I don't know what they were.
Kennedy: Who used to play these, Harry?
Cox: My father.
Kennedy: Your father, Robert. . .
Cox: Yes. I've got this - that's his fiddle I've got there now.
