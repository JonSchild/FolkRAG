Fisk 2, 7

Mourner, let your heart just catch on fire
Deacon, let your "  "  "  "  " (3)
Fire with the holy ghost.
Ever felt that?
When I was a sinner, the Holy Ghost come on
down & that your heart catch on fire.

[Ramble round, (2)]
Land of God (4)
Well, city called a heaven (4)
When the blood comin' a runnin'
"        it run to you
"     "      "      "  me.       


[*I learnt that song 
in a revival last year. 
I heard it when I was 
a little boy, but I don't 
reckon I know what it 
mean till I got up some size. *]
