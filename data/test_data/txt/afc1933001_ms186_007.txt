Mr. Lonnie Odum
St. Joseph, Tennessee

Allow me to thank you in behalf on the Library of
Congress for the amazingly beautiful collection of records
you were so kind as to help me to make. If things go well
I plan to suggest that the Library release an entire album 
of the Sacred Harp pieces recorded at Birmingham so that
the general public can become better acquainted with this
noble American music.

Attached is a complete list of the Sacred Heart pieces
recorded by me during the convention, along with an estimate
of the cost of suplication of the recordings. Please note
that certain ones are recorded in the Court House and others
in the studio. Those made in the studio will naturally be of
accoustically superior quality.

Allow me again to thank you for your fine spirit of 
co-operation.

Sincerely yours,
