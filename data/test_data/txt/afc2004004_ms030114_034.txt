REVEREND GARY DAVIS, INTERVIEW DECEMBER 1968  TAPE TWO
-----------------
Q: Tell me about Candyman?
A: That song came out in 1905 in a carnival show.

Q: How come you only use two fingers to play this guitar?
A: Because that's all you need.
Q: How many fingers do you think Blind Blake used?
A: I ain't got nothing to do about what Blind Blake used. I'm telling you what
you need.
Q: Do you think guitar students should use two fingers.
A: That's what I use.
Q: For guitar students though? 
A: Teach them the same as me.
Q: Does two fingers give you a certain sound? 
A: It is a certain sound. You're going to talk about it you see. You
don't give the rest of your hand time to do nothing -- to play with all of 
your fingers.
Q: Did you record that ICE PICK BLUES in the "old days".
A: No -- Oh yes I did. I n the old days when I played for the Perfect Record Company.
I went to a church onetime, introduced myself to the preacher. He asked me --
why don't you go to the MINISTER'S COUNCIL and aske them to give you an
appointment as a preacher? I said -- "Me!" -- Yeh - you!
Would I belittle myself that way - No!
Q: When is the time for a guitar player to play in public?
A: God never called anybody to preach when he didn't have any words to say.
When I'm out going working , asked somebody let me preach that place.
I sa --My God uh hmm.
That was quite an insult to me.
It's no use offering yourself to somebody. If they want you -- they'll call you.
You can go and find alot of puppies, you understand. They all belong
to the same dog. When you lay eyes on these puppies you can tell which
one[?] is[?] going to be on the top. Youcan pick that one out. You [?] 
can see something in that one you don't see in the rest.
Don't you go picking yourself out to the people. It's them pick you out.
Q: Is it hard to play for people sometimes? 
A: That's when they call you sometimes it very tough.
Ain't no easy job to sit down and play no guitar no how. Some of the people
that look at it think its easy -- because [?] looks easy to you.
