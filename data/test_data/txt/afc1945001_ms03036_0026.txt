Meat packing plants and meat dealers are profiting, that is why
meat prices are high and we don't have enough meat.
Skilled Workman, St. Paul, 8/11

Defense workers are making too much money.  90 cents an hour for common
labor is too much.  People will be spoiled for after the war because they
won't save their money.  They are spending their money on booze. [*7a*]
Watchman, St. Paul, 8/11

We are against England because England sold Czechoslovakia down
the river.  England is a big shot that will try to have America fight their
battle.  We would not have a war if England had some backbone. [*2*]
Bohemian Common Laborer, St. Paul, 8/11

England double crossed Czechoslovakia. It is all England's fault
that America is at war, but now we got to go through with it. [*2*]
Bohemian Skilled Workman, St. Paul, 8/11

The Jews are responsible for the war. [*6*]
Housewife, Osseo, 8/11

Sugar rationing is not necessary; the warehouses are full of
sugar.  There isn't enough storage space for the new crop.
Farmer, Osseo, 8/11

There is plenty of sugar; rationing isn't necessary.
Farmer's Wife, Osseo, 8/11

England wants us to fight their battle for them and they are saving
their own necks and people and are not doing anything. [*2*]
Doctor's Wife, Osseo, 8/11

I wouldn't be surprised if Russia made peace with Germany and then
we would have to fight the whole world ourselves.
Farmer, Osseo, 8/11
