            Sugar and gasoline have occupied the top positions on rationing 
rumors, although other food items (like coffee, tea), shoes, wool clothes, 
and so on have had some attention from the rumor spreaders. However, 
since the middle of July, rationing stories have been declining in number 
and popularity. The last few that have come in have had a new slant on 
general rationing:
            From Hyde Park:
                        If it were not for the fall election, gasoline and other 
                        materials would be rationed now.
            Or:
                        I heard that gas rationing will not go into effect until 
                        after the elections.

            With the decline in rationing stories, there has been an increase 
and sudden interest in spy and sabotage stories. This change apparently has 
been related to the change in public interest from rationing talk to discussions 
of the recent rounding up of spies and the various grand jury investigations. 
Just as spies and saboteurs have taken over the front page of the 
the newspapers, and rationing, the inside of the paper, so have the spy and 
saboteur rumors come to the foreground. For instance, we have the following 
examples:
            From the South Side Negro Area:
                        I have heard that at the Elwood powder plant near Joliet 
                        where the explosions took place that it was discovered that 
                        there were twelve guards or policemen who had false badges.
            From Hyde Park:
                        The Naval Military Police in Hyde Park who are armed and 
                        in uniform, are really helping the FBI to hunt and run down 
                        spies. It is said that one has already been caught at the 
                        Harvard Hotel.
            From Highland. Park:
                        A man who has a summer house on Cape Cod kept a couple 
                        living in his lodge while he was in New York during the 
                        winter. There had been constant talk of New England fishermen                        
                        refueling and supplying U-boats with goods, so he went 
                        down to investigate. Upon arrival, he found that his store- 
                        house supplies had been greatly diminished, and he eventually
                        discovered that his couple had been aiding the enemy with goods.
            From Hyde Park:
                        An army officer who was sent to a camp near New Orleans
                        found that his duties were very simple and that he did not 
                        have much to occupy his time. He was beginning to wonder 
                        about this and about the strange atmosphere of the camp, 
                        when suddenly there was a big blow-up in the personnel of 
                        the camp and all of the highest officers were sent away.
                        It was rumored that they had been working hand-in-glove with 
                        saboteurs and enemy agents operating in and about the Gulf 
                        of Mexico.
            From South Chicago, there comes a sabotage story of which we have 
had several versions, but the main facts of the story are, in each case,
the same:
