     I hailed 'er.  "Hello, Miss Mae Lizzie!"  Didn' see us.  I

     Said, "Aw right."  She looked.  She see how Pinkey, she kept,
she had a shirt.  She kep' on to board (?) an' she said, "Ain'

     I said, "Yes, ma'am!"  I said, "Pinkey's doin' fine.  We
goin' to town; goin' to the mill."  An' kept on walkin'.
     "Uh-huh..."  That's all she said.  An' jus' stood there an'
looked.  Well, us [just turned] turnt [to ? as she] the corner as she was
lookin'.  She went -- I was goin' to the mill -- she leave that
house an' go over there, an' ask Susie Mae an' them.  Those was
the chirrun.  N-not the ol' lady Susie Mae, [the] Leola, uh, 
Leola's chil'.  An', uh, big-sized chirrun.  Ask 'em, "Wasn'
your cousin Bessie there?"  An', "Hadn't she come?" I just
spoke to 'er.
     An' they said, "Yeah!" Th-th-that I was there, stayin'
with them.  I been there 2 or 3 weeks or more, ya know. 
     An' so, she say, "Uh-huh. Well, your cousin Bessie ain't 
gonna be here long."  An' brother, I wasn' there long, I'm

"But she, she she have to do sumpthin' diffrunt from what I know."
