LOOK-A YONDER
Look-a yonder, (2)
Lawd, I see King Jesus comin', 
Walking down, Lawdy, 
Got on his travelin', 
I mean shoes, Lawdy, 
Got on his travelin',
I mean shoes, chirrun, 
Got on his travelin' shoes. 

Look-a Yonder, (2)
I see my mother comin'
Walkin' down, Lawd, she
Got on her travelin',
I mean shoes, chile, 
Got on her travelin', 
Sho' 'nuf shoes, Lawd,  she's
Got on her travelin' shoes,  
Look-a yonder, (2)
I see my father come
Walkin' down, Lawdy, he
Got on his travelin',
I mean shoes, Lawd,
Got on his travelin'
Sho' 'nuf shoes, Lawd,
Can't he travel, Lawd,
Got on his shoes, Lawd,
Can't he travel now, 
Got on his shoes, Lawd,
