stealing into some barns, on the road going into some farmers
barn, open the door canny...what they call skippering,
that's what they called French Leave, or stealing it, stealing
in and then going away afore the man came out in the morning
and he didn't know. We used to lie down in amongst the straw
and....Sometime we was catched with the working men, near put
[*at*]
a pitch fork in us one time. That was the farm near Barnham
Furness, coming on to near Barnham when we went to this farm
one night and we opened the doors canny and we both went in
amongst the straw and...Oh we was both lying snug together -
this girl and I - and, of curse, the working men come in in the
morning and the was forking the straw, as it were and they
very near put the fork in us and I get up with an awful howl -
I let out an awful yell. He says, "Who's that?" I says "It's
me." He says, "There must be more than yourself." I says
"Another - party here. There's another girl here." "Oh, my
God!" he says, "I very near put the fork into you." He says,
"How did you comein here?" I says, "We stole in." "My God!"
he says, "You'd better knock across," he says, "You'll be
needing your breakfast now." So he says "You'd better clear
out of here. But," he says, "Go to my house," that's the
workmen's house - he was a kind of cattleman. So he says,
"That house across in the other side of that field there, you'll
get a good breakfast," he says "But," he says,
"I'll be up," he says, "In a short time. I'll be up behind
you. So I goes up and we gets a good, good breakfast.
