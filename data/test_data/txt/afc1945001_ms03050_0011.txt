SOUTH CAROLINA
August 15, 1942

SPECIAL REPORT ON RUMORS HEARD FROM AUGUST 8 UNTIL NOON AUGUST 15, 1942

1. On August 10, 11, and 12, rumors of serious clashes between white and 
Negro citizens in the northwestern section of South Carolina were rife in the
Columbia area. They were heard in five different places on August 10; in six 
places on August 11, and three on August 12. Several newspapers later published 
stories of a clash in Greenwood about which an air mail letter was sent the 
Bureau Chief this week. Publication of these stories giving apparently accurate 
stories of what actually occurred in Greenwood put an end to the rumors current 
in the central section of the State. 

Each time the rumor was heard in Columbia it came from a man in working 
clothes who said he did not know the details of the difficulties in the 
northwestern section of the State but that he "understood" that several persons
had been killed or badly injured. One of the men heard discussing the race 
clash told fellow passengers on the bus that all the "white people around 
Greenwood have armed themselves and the Home Guard Company is patrolling the 
streets." These rumors have not been heard since August 12. 

2. A young woman, an office worker, was heard telling a group of friends
on Friday, August 14, that she had been informed by friends that Negroes in the 
Columbia area were holding frequent meetings at night. She said that Negro 
women were taking an important part in these meetings and were reaching agreements 
to demand higher wages from their white employers. This rumor has not 
been heard elsewhere.
