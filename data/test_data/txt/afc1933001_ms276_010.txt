We are sending you herewith a card on which we
ask you to give us the name and address of one of your
fellow workers who, you think, might join the union if
he knew more about it.  We will send him literature
about the UFWA and the CIO - paid for out of the Educational
Fund - and endeavor to get him to become a
member.  Please attend to this today.  In building up
your union, you are strengthening your own positions as
a worker.

We urge the members at this vacation season to be
specially careful not to fall behind in their dues as
this will make it hard for your union and for you.
The union rule requires us to drop a member who is
three months behind in his dues and to charge a $2
reinstatement fee when he joins again.  As the UFWA
will hold a national convention in Washington in
September and representation will be based on membership,
it is specially desirable that every member keep
his card paid up.

Speaking of dues, did you ever stop to think what
you owe to the devotion of the dues-collectors?  Without
their faithful work - and they don't like asking
for money any more than you do - your union would go
out of existence.  So why not make their work easier
by hunting up your collector each month and paying
your dues before he (or she) has time to ask you fo
them?  If every member would do this, it would lighten
immensely the work of these self-sacrificing members.

Mrs. Hannah Newby, tireless in her devotion to
the union, has retired from the Library service, but
says she intends to keep up her union membership.  We
wish her many years of well earned leisure.

Members are urged to contribute items for the
L.C. News Letter to Paul Boswell, Main R. Rm., or to
