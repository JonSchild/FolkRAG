Lomax:  The first time I ever heard that story
              was in the Kentucky mountains. [He was] Only they
     tell it on a fiddling feudist name of Callahan-
              he broke his fiddle just like James MP did.
              [That's not all I heard in the highlands]
              But that's not all I've heard in the
              West of Scotland to remind me of the Kentucky
              mountains. Back yonder in the lonesome
              valleys of Kentucky where hymn books are scarce ) the folks live out their hymns & sing
              them in unison line by line - [illegible] lonesome [illegible],
              [the] slow tunes, making you think that life is short
              & eternity lasts a long time - and up here in
              the highlands they [illegible] do the same thing
              in Gaellic - [illegible] the liner-outer is called
              the praesentor - cue Record) and the music is grand –
              noble - sombre as the mountains that frown into 
                                                    the sea –
                   Up.   At red cue mark - fade
                    at 55 seconds –
