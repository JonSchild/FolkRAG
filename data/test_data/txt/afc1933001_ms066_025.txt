when I send in the list of 
records I wish duplicated, 
I'll forward the list through 
you, so that you can mark it 
off your list as a fait accompli. 
As yet we have been  unable 
to find our list of records 
which we have deposited in the 
Library. In case you think it
desirable, you might mention 
that the first several hundred
records were given to the Library
when Alan and I were travelling
and paying our own expenses.
This suggestion is meant only 
to aid in softening any repercussions 
on you.
Sincerely your fiend,
JohnA. Lomax
