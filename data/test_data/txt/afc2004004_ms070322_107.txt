I know that the facts of my
script are absolute fictions
On Torey they're very poor &
primitive, inbred, idiotic,
bad fishermen & sailors who
stay abed till noon because
they are afraid of the sea
and their turf is so bad
the kettle won't even boil
but will finally warm the
potatoes after 3 or 4 hours.
My story could never have
happened, in fact has nothing
to do with the heroic western
island life, but is a sort of
phoney stage Irish setting for
the songs, using as much
folklore as I can possibly
absorb.

But my appetite is low &
I feel more like vomiting
