BJ TAPE 20, p. 43

TL:     Really?
BJ:     Yeah, close to a hundred years old.   He's in his 90's.   An'
ah, when his daughter came home, other daughter wht-- that was in
Fladah?   An' the peoples had told her how good I was to 'im an'
she didn' know me.   Well, she's my bosom friend from then on.   She
was -- she drank -- but she wasn't quite like that other sister
was.   You know.   No, no, she -- she stick with that old man.   Yes,
she did.   An' she be talkin' now, sometimes the peoples, don't care
how                    she say, "I'll never forgit, ah, Bessie, how she
she was, ah, he'ped my daddy.   My daddy's been dead long ago!   Before
I got from Florida."   She was down in Miami an' she came back.   She 
brought her husband with her.   She married down there an' so. . .
An' he died since, ah, I know it then, when I was with him on 
his, on his dyin' bed, too.
       An' so, I was with the old man.  Old man was passin' out
an' he's just shakin' my hand an' thankin' God because he, he
was a fall (?) from God.   He tol' me that.   That hurted me again.
When I went to talkin' to 'im about the Lawd.   He says, "It's 
so far (fall?) from God."   Then he tol' me about the church he
was in an' the fault he found with the preacher.   An' that made --
the devil tol' him, jus' like he had with me, ya know,  "Don't, don't
fool with them 'cause they ain't no good."   'Cause that preacher
was wrong.   Ya see?   That, that's why one person can throw a
thousand [other] off the track.   Ya see?   An' one person can draw
a thousand to the track, ya see?   An' so that's what it was.   An'
I talked to him about that.   An' we prayed an' we had -- An' also,
I had preachers to come there an' pray with him.
TL:     Oh, you did?
BJ:     Yeah.  Other preachers.
