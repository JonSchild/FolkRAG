A Modern Yankee Doodle

Gertrude Barnum

Yankee Men they had their way
And thought it fine and dandy
Locked the women in all day
And stopped their cried with candy

Chorus
Yankee Dodle, Doodle Doo
Yankee Doodle Dandy
Said to women: "Who are you?
Be glad to get the candy."

Yankee women caught right on
And thought it quite unhandy
To have no say and get no pay
They threw a hate on candy.

Chorus
Yankee Doodle Doodle Doo
Yankee Doodle Dandy
You'd be sorry if you knew
How sick they grew of candy

Yankee man, said Yankee maid
With you no words we'll bandy
Hand to use the front door key
And we'll send back your candy

Chorus
Yankee Dude what can you do
Yankee Doodle Dandy;
We like freedom same as you,
And won't be hushed with candy

We mean to roam the great wide world
We mean to ride a pony
Stick a feather in your cap
And dine on macaroni.

Chorus
Yankee Dude what can you do?
Yankee Doodle Dandy
We mean to live on solid food,
And you can keep your candy.

Yankee Dude now helps the maid
To mount upon his pony
Likes the feather in her cap
And shares the macaroni.

Chorus
Yankee Doodle, Doodle Doo,
Yankee Doodle, Dandy
Is glad to have his girl along
They both enjoy the candy.
