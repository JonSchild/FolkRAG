SIX JOLLY WEE MINERS
Six jolly wee miner lads, miner lads are we,
We've travelled brae Scotland, this country round and roun',
We've travelled east, we've travelled west, and all aroun' the town,
For to find out the treasures that lie below the ground.

Some hae got money, an' some hae nane at a',
They that's got money, the bottle they'll a' draw,
They'll fill their glasses right up to the brim, as the toast goes roon' and roon',
Here's my hand to every wee collier lad that works below the ground.

I'll knit my love a gravet, as doggie as can be,
An' the colours I'll put in it will fairly tak' his ee,
His chums a' will go up to him an' say: "Where did you get that?"
"Oh, I got it frae my wee doggie moll an' what dae ye think of that?"

I'll build my love a castle, a castle of high renown;
Neither kings, queens or earls will pull my castle down.
The king loves the queen, and the emperor does the same;
Here's my hand tae every wee collier lad that works below the ground.

Mrs. H. Cosgrave
