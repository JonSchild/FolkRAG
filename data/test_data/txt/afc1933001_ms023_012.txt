Dear Sir:
Replying to your circular letter of November 27 
requesting words of tunes of songs or ballads 
that are popular among the inmates of this institution.
I have made inquiry along this line among our 
inmates but my investigation has not disclosed 
any such songs or ballads sung by any of our 
inmates at this time.
I will keep your request in mind, however, and 
if I am able to develop any information in this 
connection I will be glad to inform you.

Very truly yours,
J M McCauley
J. M. MC CAULEY,
Superintendent.
