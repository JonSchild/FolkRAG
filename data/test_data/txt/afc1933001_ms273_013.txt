8. To initiate the program of experimental documentary broadcasts
in the field, I suggest that the sum of $5,000.00 to
cover travel expenses for actors, services of a director and
etc. be set aside. Between five and ten programs can be put
together with this money. The only director in the field of
radio who I feel is competent to carry out this work is
Mr. Nicholas Ray, who is at present with the Columbia Broadcasting
System.

The total amount for this program for a year's work will
be approximately $30,000.00.
