"The government bureaus are getting a lot of criticism as being inefficient
and concerned with too much red tape.  The Town Hall broadcast week before last
and an article in the last Readers Digest both attacked inefficiency of the 
government bureaus, and I have heard both incidents discussed a lot.  Business
men say that there is so much red tape we can't afford to do business with
the government.  Aug. 5 - Accountant   Iowa 8
