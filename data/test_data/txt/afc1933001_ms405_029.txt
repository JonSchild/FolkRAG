Once in New York City I attended a banquet given by the alumni of 
Columbia University. Someone present had heard of my interest in Folk 
Songs and insisted on a talk from me.  esponding, I retold the ancient 
gag of having grown to manhood believing damyankee was one word. Being
by birth a Mississippian, my mother from Alabama and my father from 
South Carolina, I could justly claim intense feeling on this score. 
In closing I recited ---- ballad of The Unreconstructed  Rebel, in- 
cluding the stanza: 

I hate the Constitution, this great  epublic, too, 
I hate the Yankee nation and everything they do. 
I hate their nasty eagle, and all their flags and fuss. 
Those dying, thieving Yankees I hate 'em wuss and wuss. 

I must confess that I got a good hand. The Columbia crowd stamped 
and laughed at the brazen lack of patriotism of the lines. 
But there came a serious aftermath. Another visitor from the 
Middle West took me into a lonely corner. Trembling with indignation, 
he told me that he resented what I had said. I earnestly claimed that 
the war was over, that "we had worn ourselves out whipping you," that 
I couldn't fight and was a mighty poor talker. He wouldn't be appeased; 
so there was fought the hitherto third Battle of Bull Run.
