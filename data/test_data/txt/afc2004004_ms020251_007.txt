PRETTY LITTLE GIRL
37
This is simply a skip, just something to be playing, very much
like "Just from the Kitchen."  Just skip around, change partners
and swing, choosing whom you think is pretty.  Although it is
about a girl, a boy can be picked.  It can be skipped crossways
or in a ring.
CHORUS:  Pretty little girl, pretty little girl
That come to play with me,
Pretty little girl, pretty little girl,
Her name is Marjorie.
When I get a-grown, gonna marry this girl
And raise a family,
I never have saw such a pretty little girl
That come to stay with me.   (CHORUS)
Her hair is black and her eyes is brown,
Her teeth is white as bees,
I never have seen such a pretty little girl
That come to play with me.  (CHORUS)
Them big, round hips and great, big legs,
And arches in her feet,
I never have saw such a pretty,little girl
That come to stay with me.  (CHORUS)
We gonna have a girl and a boy
Just as company,
I never have had such a pretty little girl
That come to play with me.  (CHORUS)
My mama says she's a cute little girl,
My papa says she's sweet,
I never have had such a pretty little girl
That come to play with me.  (CHORUS)
