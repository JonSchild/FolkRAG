The first essential, therefore, is choosing the performers
and I feel that these people should be brought
from more or less isolated communities or cultural 
groups. They should be put under the direction of some
person who understands their culture and will be interested
in helping them develop their own ideas of entertainment,
rather than super-imposing on them his own unsophisticated
notions. The selection of these performers
and the development of their folk plays will require a
minimum of six months of preparation before the Fair opens.

In The Street

What I want to suggest here is a revival of certain
techniques of popular art that have withered away in cities
and among so-called respectable people. Driven into
the back woods by the radio and the cinema, popular art
has tended to become the monopoly of professional virtuosos
and big corporations. The World's Fair can, by falling
back upon the ancient techniques of the strolling
player, the Comedia del Arte, the wandering minstrel, 
the medicine show and the parade, help to bring art participation
back to the people at the same time make
the World's Fair the simple and merry people's festival
that it was in the Middle Ages. 

As evidence of the potentialities of these street
techniques, even in the shadow of modernistic architecture
and stream-lined exhibits, let me tell you the story
of the young man with the kazoo at the Texas Centennial
in 1936. Officials of the Centennial admitted that the
most popular, and at the same time the least expensive
entertainment item in the whole Fair Grounds was a certain
young and ebullient Jewish salesman who set up shop
on an improvised stage in the open air, directly between
the impressive Ford exhibit and a magnificent reflecting
pool. He had a piano, a cheap amplifier, a box of kazoos
and a ready wit; and his audience was always larger than
that of either of his more dignified and expensive rivals.
In reality, he was nothing but the 1936 version of the
medieval jongleur who, with his somewhat hoary jokes and
his ability to successfully invite audience participation, 
went straight to the simple essentials of the human desire
to be amused.

On the basis of his technique and those which he
suggests, a whole phase of the World's Fair program should
be built. People come to a fair, despite the educational
