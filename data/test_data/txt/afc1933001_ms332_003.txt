19 B SETEINBERG (Refugee)

Q: ... tell us how you went to Hungary - where you went from there, etc. etc.
A: I am Hungarian by birth but a part of Hungary where I was born was taken
     over by Czecho-Slovakia. After I continued my studies in C-S at the Technical 
     University. I went back to Hungary and spent a few years there as a chemist 
     in a factory. from there I went to Holland and from Holland to England to
     France then back to Holland then to Germany. Finally in 1933 Hitler came
     to Germany and I left Germany where I was teaching in a University after
     that I went to Austria where I worked in a concern and from there to Mal (?)
     where I spent two years. From M. I came to this country where I am for 
     two and one half years. I know all of Europe and part of the Far East
     and found U.S. still the best place I have seen so far.
Q: Before you came to this country you had heard a lot about it. Do you think
     as much of it as you thought you would. Some Europeans have a funny impression
     of the U.S.
A: My impression is that scientifically and technically the U. S. at least is as
     well developed as any country which I have seen so far and I have no criticism
     whatever.
Q: One of the things that is happening in this country is the curtailment of 
     speech. In Universities professors who are liberal in their ideas,..
     didn't that happen in Europe?
A: I still stand for free speech. Everybody has an opinion he must be free
     to offer because the other people must be able to think in the terms of
     somebody else too. I think the right of free speech ought to be preserved.
Q: Did you have a difficult time leaving Germany at the time Hitler came into
     power?
