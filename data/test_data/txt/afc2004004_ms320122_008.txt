singing his own trouble. That's why it's French. French 
music that's not written. You sing anything you want.

MR. FOUGET     Or you . . .

A. LOMAX       Well you were telling me 
before something and I, I could, can't quite remember but it 
was very interesting about how women got all, married early 
and they had a lot of children. They got kind of worn out 
and stuff like that. Remember? They, they had a hard road 
to hoe somehow out here sometime, in the old days, remember?
MR. FOUGET     Yeah. Well, they're life is 
so hard, you know. And naturally, yeah, they got married 
young. You know now, take a family 9 or 10 in the family 
there, that corn bread didn't last very long. So they'd 
like to go on their own. And you didn't have to have much to 
go on your own then. Because I remember, I was mostly 
raised by my grandpa but we was five in the family, five 
growing up. And our grocery bill for the, for the whole 
year was $52.40. And my grandpa told us, he says, been 
some slipping there somewhere. Next year we're going to have 
tighten up a little bit more. Now just imagine, for a whole 
year the grocery bill, you know, we'd, we'd buy on credit 
until it, we'd sell our cotton stuff. And then we'd pay our 
grocery bill.
A. LOMAX          Oh, I see.
