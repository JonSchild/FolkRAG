Sunday evening - 
I've been editing tape all
week - a job like weaving - that
is completely absorbing, rather
mindless, [but consuming of time
like] time consuming. Now
after 8-10 hours a day for
a week I'm almost done -
about 3 or 4 minutes over and
about to make final decisions.
Robin is still in bed, but
singing now. Finally got a
doctor to giver her chloro-myecin
& she began to mend. Our joint
medical bill in England so far
has been at least $150 no wonder
they needed socialized medicine.
Have accepted BBC offer tenatively. 
Have written Elizabeth asking whether
she'd like to resume our relationship.
Very worried about Anne.
