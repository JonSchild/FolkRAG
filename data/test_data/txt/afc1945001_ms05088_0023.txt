Recently during one of those discussions on, "The second front, to 
have or not to have", I had an opportunity to hear an entirely new slant
on the situation.  A fried of mine entering into the conversation said, 
"I know it sounds fantastic but I heard that the reason we haven't started 
a second front as yet is because Roosevelt and Churchill got together and
decided to wait a while and let the Russians and the Germans kill each 
other off -- the more dead Russians and Germans, the better."
