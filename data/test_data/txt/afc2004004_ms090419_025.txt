I'm gonna take the boll weevil
Put him between two blocks of ice,
Boll weevil told that man,
"I'm livin a millionaire's life,
          Because I have a home
          Everywhere I go

I'm gonna put him in a sack
Send him away in a baloon,
Boll weevil told that man,
"I'll be back when the cotton bloom,
        Because I have a home
        Everywhere I go.
