Rumor: 1.  
During a conversation with a colored man, described as 27 years old,
5 ft. 10 in. 140 lbs., who was dressed in working clothes, at Fifth 
and Michigan Avenue.  As we were discussing various subjects this man 
stated that he had heard from different persons, there was very much
dissension between the white and colored soldiers, in regards to the 
way they were being treated, but did not enlarge on the topic of
discussion.  This was one reason he stated he did not want to go into
the Army.
