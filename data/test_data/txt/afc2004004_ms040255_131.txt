The story of "My King has landed at Moidart" (Thainig
                     mo Righ air Tir am Muideart)

They were getting these sand eels when somebody came past and
told them - did they hear that the King had landed - and with
the delight they had they stuck these in the sand and they
made the eightsome reel.  They had the eight, you know.
The shanks of the spades - that was their partners. And one
of them composed this:

"Thanig mo righ air tir am Muideart 
Righ nan Gaidheal"                                                  (in Sar Obair)
                                                                                 (Beauties of Gaelic
                                                                                   poetry)
Thainig an righ air tir am Muideart
Thainig thu Thearlaich
Thainig thu Thearlaich

Righ nan Gaidheal
Righ nan Gaidheal                                             (Jacobite song)

              I think Gaelic is the most beautiful language on earth. 

LOMAX:  Why?
              Because to us we understand it and the meaning of it
              goes right into you. (Stuttering) The kindness
              that comes from the expression.

LOMAX:  Interjects: (CUT)

               Well, for instance... (stuttering)
               If I was in love with you and telling you in Gaelic
               how much I loved you - well, I can't describe it!!
               Well, if I had a child now, telling that child how much
               I loved that child and how dear that child was to me.
               It is great in Gaelic (SKIP)

               ... "Oh, my darling, my dearest, my beloved everything
               on this earth. You know (Upward inflection) my precious
               - that doesn't go altogether (She does it in Gaelic)
