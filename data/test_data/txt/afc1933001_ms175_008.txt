Dear Mr. Lomax: 
Mr. Jack Scher of the Chicago Writers' Project, and Mr. and
Mrs. Stuart Engstrand have informed me that you are recording various 
aspects of musical America, and they suggested that I write to you, 
telling you something of my work. 

I am enclosing two clippings from the Carmel Pine Cone (California). 
I especially request that you read the article titled "Barstow," 
which I wrote myself. I am also enclosing a photograph of the four 
instruments I have so far developed, adapted to a system of 43 tones 
to the octave, containing the materials for all ancient and modern 
folk musics, scale materials, that is. 

I have been working on these ideas for eighteen years.  For the 
past five years I have holed in, in California, trying to complete 
the instruments I felt were essential to a continuation of the work. 
The highlight of my endeavors, as far as recognition goes, was a 
theory of music at the British Museum, and worked with the Irish 
poet, W.B.Yeats, in an interpretation of his version of Sophocles' 
tragedy, "King Oedipus." All my work in music concerns the inherent
music of spoken, or semi-spoken words. And this I try to preserve in 
passion, next to Irish legend itself. 

I hope to be in Chicago through the coming winter. I am endeavoring 
to find some support for my music, and just at the moment I am 
also searching for some means of livelihood. 

If you are in Chicago any time soon, I would be very happy if 
you would look me up. 
Sincerely yours, 
Harry Partch
