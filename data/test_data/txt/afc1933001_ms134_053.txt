Dear Alan:
This is the unofficial communication to remind your
secretary that I want a list of all the songs and bits you
took yesterday.
I don't even know whether you got  "Your
father and your mother, love, etc"--but, after witnessing
your other achievements, I suspect you did.
Second--don't forget to find out if the "Philadelphia
Press" is on file there. It merged with the Evening Ledger
in 1914, and the "People's Forum" (which was usually on page 6)
was discontinued. We have complete files in the Phila. Public
Library at Logan Square, Phila.
Third--the "Pennsylvania State Champion Ballad Singer"
(Peter Cooper, "Casey Jones") work[e]s in the same office with
my dad, is in his glee club, is noted for not being able to
carry a tune, and doesn't know how he got into the contest,
anyway! He is being teased unmercifully, Dad says. I just
'phoned Dad and asked him to find out if Cooper knows any
ballads, really. Dad isn't sure yet, but  doesn't think so.
How's that for a slap at the Folk Festival?
Thanks, over and over, for the advice you gave me, and for
the resultant pep that makes my fingers itch, even on a sultry morning
after a most exciting day. Hope you got to Washington all
right and awake.
Sincerely yours,
Kay
