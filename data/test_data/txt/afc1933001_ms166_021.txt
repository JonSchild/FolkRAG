So he rode and he rode on his milk-
white steed.
Till he came to London town.
And there he heard the St. Pancras
bells ring
And the people all mourning around,
round, round.
And the people all mourning around.

"Oh! what is the matter", Lord Lovell he cried,
"Oh! what is the matter", cried he.
"The Lord's Lady is dead", a woman replied.
"And come called her Lady Nancee
cee, cee.
And some called her Lady Nancee."

So he ordered the grave to be opened wide,
And the shroud to be turn-ed down
And there he kissed the clay cold lips
And the tears came tricklin' down,
down, down.
And the tears came tricklin' down.

Lady Nancy she died as it might be today.
Lord Lovell, he died on the morrow.
Lady Nancy, she died of pure, pure grief
Lord Lovell, he died out of sorrow, ro-
sorrow.
Lord Lovell, he died out of sorrow.
