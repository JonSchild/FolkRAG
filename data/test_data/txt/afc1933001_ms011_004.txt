John A. Lomax, Esq.
60 Fifth Avenue
New York City

My dear Mr. Lomax:

It is I who am surprised that you should
not have heard from me in Detroit, because I
sent you a letter to general delivery there,
as soon as I received word from you. And in
this letter I expressed my belief that what
I had received was an incomplete
letter. I expect to be in Washington between
the fifth and eighth of December.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music
