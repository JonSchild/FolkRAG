Dear Nesuhi:
It is now quite a long time since any publishing royalties have been
paid to Alan Lomas covering the music contained in the several Lomax albums
which you released. I gather that you assigned your publishing rights to 
Hill & Range, and several letters to them requesting payments and statements
have brought no response. Would you please see that these payments are
made immediately, as per the contract.
Sincerely,
Paul A. Rosen
