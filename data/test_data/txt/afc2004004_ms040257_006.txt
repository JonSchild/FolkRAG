Dr. Allan Macdonald                                    Skye
My father used to sit with the children on his knee
and sing them to sleep.
My grandfather used to do that too.
I remember my grandmother too.
She was dull of old songs.    I was too young to pick
them up.. But she was from Lochalsh.      She was a MacRae
and she was full of Gaelic songs.       She used to sing us
 to sleep you know.     There is another one - there is 
another one.....

(Reel 7)      Dr. Allan MacDonald: (contd.)
Skye was the cradle of piping with the MacCrimmons.
They all learnt the piping fro Skye - all those that 
have it now.    It come - it originated in Skye...
from the 15th/16th - 1500 until about 1822 - generations
after - ten generations of the MacCrimmons.      There were 
ten generations of the same family of the MacCrimmons - 
I expect it would be a son - the best of the younger
generation had to follow on.   It was not really the 
father to son...

LOMAX:       Were they the pipers to the King?
DR.MACD:    They were pipers to the MacLeods of Dunvegan.    Where they
                       came from nobody knows but we know they were from
                       1500 on but possibly a long time before then.
LOMAX:         And everybody in Skye recognised that... that...
DR.MacD:      Everybody in SCOTLAND ......
CALUM MACLEAN:      They were recognised as THE pipers. 
LOMAX:         Do you have any songs about Charlie being in Skye or anything
