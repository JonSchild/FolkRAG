          He wen' up there.  An' say this time he open the door, the
lights went out.   There wasn' a soul in the church.   Ha, ha!
Wasn't a soul in there, ha, ha, ha!
TL:      Was that real?
BJ:      Yeah, that's real.   He says it scared him so bad he didn'
know what it was.   'Cause he go up there an' open the door an' all
the lights jus' went out.   The time he open the door, he could see
there wasn' nobody in there.   An' next time he looked, the lights
went out.
TL:      Did he ever find out what happened?
BJ:      Ain't nothin' happened.   He, he just outrun the devil!   He
forgot it wa' rainin'.   He left there runnin'!
