AL:  These mountaineer had wise hands.   They could whittle their way,  they
could chop their way thru the wood with their axes and make everything they 
needed to....This mountain culture was made with a broad ax and a sharp
knife.  They hewed out their houses with an ax. and they made the utensils
for the house and the toys for the children with their knife-wise hands.
Seeing these hands at work today, and seeing all these marvelous toys that
the fathers,  mothers made for their kids...You made all the things you 
actually use in the house that way,...
 Stan:   Yeah,  made the forks,  spoons,  ladles,  bread board...
AL:   Show us one of these...domestic tools, you've showed us mostly toys.
 Stan:   Well, layed down things there shucked corn with. 
AL:  Show that.
Stan:  This is a corn shucker,  shucked corn with.   And down here.  nw  this is
the way to shuck corn  (Technical) .....Corn shucker, and dad made a lot
of 'em and I've made quite a few of 'em,  and you couldn't buy any of those
at that time,  and if you could buy 'em.   you didn't have the money.   So
I'll show you how ya done it.  You  (unint) your corn this way thru that,
 and you pull her down,  there you go.  And then you'd pull her over this
way.   When you got it down like this, you took your hand and you broke it
off.  And then you'd get another one.
AL:   I haven't seen you use the corn shucker a darn bit!
Stan:   See, the corn's dry, it's much harder to shuck than it is....(unint)
...see you run it thru here,  and then you pull it til you got it started, 
and then you pull it there like that.   And a lot of times it helps to pull
it again, like this.   And when it's  (unint.)..it's harder to shuck.
So that's the way you do it,  and that's the way we made it.
Hat:   And we had corn shuckin's.
Stan:   And we had corn shuckin's, and then when it'd have the most red  (unint)
