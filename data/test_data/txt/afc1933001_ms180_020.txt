Mr. H. H. Bond, President
The Fort Valley State College
Fort Valley, Georgia

Dear Mr. Bond:

I am glad to learn from your letter to Dr. Spivacke
that the Fort Valley Festival was successful and
that Mr. John Work was able to make several records 
there.

I want to tell you again how sorry I am that your
original plan did not go through and that, in addition,
I was not able to go myself to the Festival.
I hope to receive a full account of it from Mr. Work.
In the meantime, my best wishes for the continuation
of your valuable activity.

Do you think that you have a sufficient number of
singers located throughout the State to warrant a
visit of the recording truck to various parts of
Georgia? If so, I would like to have some information
about them.

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
