objectives of the Library of Congress in mind. These objectives 
can be summed up briefly as:
1. For scholarly purposes.
2. For record release.
3. For use in documentary radio programs and in building
potential documentary/radio programs [on] from transcriptions in
the field.
While, for example, the Archive possesses a representative
and fairly complete collection of Negro ballads which could make
the basis of a scholarly study of that subject, too few of these
records are acoustically good enough for pressing or public release.
It might be said that there are no publicly commercial
records available of these extremely interesting ballads. On the other 
hand, while the Archive has a large number of fine old banjo records,
the material is so scattered that it would not serve as a
basis for the study of banjo styles in the southern mountains. Again while the Archive
has a great deal of fine material pertaining to various types of 
Southern Music, we have absolutely no songs material from the
Northwest or the Rocky Mt. Area.
