Dear Alan,

Concerning Bessie and group, first the movie business.
Apparently you misread Ed's communication; the $1000 fee is
for the Monterrey Festival, not the movie which is being
financed entirely by Ted Carpenter and conceived of as a
documentation, with the hopes that sufficient good material
will come out to make a film. He is perfectly happy to turn
over all rights etc. to the performers but has no dough for
now except to barely cover essential expenses. I read him
your note over the phone and he choked slightly and said
he'd write you direct spelling out what he could and could
not do; perhaps you have heard from him by now. He does turn
out good quality stuff; his last film won seventeen international
prizes but he points out has sold two prints and he
can't even afford to make a copy for his own protection;
prints have to be made from his master copy. He tells me
he has lined up three Oscar-winning cameramen who are donating
their time, but somewhat sourly points out that this may or
may not mean good results.

As to the UCLA fee, this was, I believe, arrived at
by a simple process of paying everybody the
same pay scale -- thirty-five dollars a day -- this includes
Seeger, Maybelle Carter, Archie Green and everybody else.
(This in line with Pete's campaign to even out the
pay scale for folk festivals sponsored by non-profit making
groups.) I don't really know if this is right or not, but
I do know that the UCLA Festival could not have gone on as
it has without some drastic step like this. It's odd, but the
college administration has fought the festival every step of
the way on simple business grounds; they were convinced that
we were out of our minds to set anything up this elaborately
and absolutely positive that the festival would run up an
enormous deficit. They are, of course, being disproved now;
most of the Festival is already sold out, and we are
hopeful of doing a better and more profitable (for the performers)
job next year. I'm enclosing a copy of the program,
by the way, for your interest.

The real plum that Ed pulled off for Bessie is the
thousand dollar fee at Monterey; this is twice as much as
the Lost City Ramblers are getting, and certainly the best
fee I have heard of their being able to make on the Coast
at least. Money is difficult out here; college concerts,
for example, are usually either free to students and financed
from student activity funds or they charge a maximum of fifty
cents admission. Coupled with the size of the college auditoriums, 
most of which are ridiculously small (Valley State's
auditorium, for example, holds four hundred students -- their
current registration if 5,000 moving rapidly up to 10,000)
this situation means very little money to spread
around over the various costs. The only way to make anything
resembling big money out here is to move into the enormous
halls like the Shrine, the Hollywood Bowl and the Santa Monica
Civic; there simply are no medium size auditoriums.
