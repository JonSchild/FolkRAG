Mr. Keith Kane, Chief
Bureau of intelligence
Office of War Information
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Kane:
In confirmation of my telephone conversation with
you I am requesting certain reports on rumors having
to do with Anglo-American relations. At your suggestion, 
I phoned Mr. Eugene Katz, who stated that
specifically I should request of you the rumor
reports on New Brunswick and Portland prepared by
the Surveys Division. In addition he suggested
that we send a person from our office to the
Special Services Section where he may study in
detail its rumor collection.

I would greatly appreciate receiving the reports he
mentioned. Within a few days a member of our
Division will get in touch with Miss Sherman, who,
I understand, is in charge of the rumor collection.

                                                 Sincerely yours
                                                 Robert C. Tryon
                                                 Robert C. Tryon, Chief
                                                 Psychology Division
