Dear Mr. Lomax,
     First may I ask you to accept my
thanks for the pleasure you give us in
your programmes "Song Hunter". They
are, indeed, thoroughly enjoyable.
     I listened and viewed with particular
interest last Tuesday, for you included
my fellow countryman Harry Cox,
of whom we are justly proud. But, as
you will appreciate, there are others
in Norfolk who know and sing very old
songs, and for some time I have been
trying to get Frank Collinson and Jack
Dillon, with whom I've had the pleasure
of working many times, to go along to
Norfolk to get these songs recorded
before it is too late.
     Every year I take my holiday in my
native County and am never tired of
listening to my old friends singing them
for my benefit. I therefore take very
great pleasure in referring you to the
"Vernon Arms", Southrepps, Norwich, Norfolk,
(near Cromer) where the brother
of the Landlord Ben Baxter - name of Harry
Baxter - will recall them for you and 
indeed, play for you on his fiddle the
