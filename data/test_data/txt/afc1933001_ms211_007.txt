am enclosing. Here, faced with this unexpected situation I do not have
even a copy of the old Cowboy Songs
from which I might select substitute
material. I am up against a
difficult situation. Will you
help at once by
1. asking Waters if he can recall
any Cowboy stuff that might
take the place of "To be in Texas"
and "Strawberry Roan"
2. Consult yourself to the same
end for material for both 
books.
3. The stuff I threw out of the
old Cowboy Songs book is I think
in a separate folder stacked
over in the corner to the right
as you go into your office
doorway
4. Some of Alex Moon's songs
