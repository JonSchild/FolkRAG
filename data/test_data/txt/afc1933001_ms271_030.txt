WE GOT TO OPEN UP THAT *WESTERN* FRONT
By *?*
(December 1942)
Tune: Jericho

Now it may be France or Norway,
That we cannot tell,
But no matter where we start our drive
We're gonna give those fascists hell.

Our planes will come like thunder,
Our ships will sail the seas,
*We're gonna open up on the Axis boys,
Axis boys, Axis boys, Axis boy
We're gonna open up on the Axis boys.
And give ole Hitler Hell.*
The commandos will pave the way for us
On *our* road to victory

Chorus:  *We're gonna* open up that *Western* front,
Second front, *western* front,
And give those fascists hell.

Then the people of conquered nations
Then they hear that rolling tide
Will arise and smite one mighty blow-
We'll be fighting side by side.

Watch our United armies
Batter down the foe,
Make those fascists yell and howl
from Berlin to Tokyo.

(Chorus)

There'll be no more old Hitler,
No more Hiro Hito,
That bald-headed Mussalami,
He was never in the show.

(Chorus)
