They've taken Epie Morrie then, sin better could nae be
And they hae rid i Carranside as fast as horse could
flee
-
There mass was sung and bells were rung & they're 
awa to bed
And Willie & Epie Morrie in ain bed they were laid
-
He's taen the sark froe off his back and kicked
off his shoon
And thrown away the chawmer key & naked he
lay doon
-
Haud awa fra me, Willie
Before I lose my maidenhead I'll fieht wi you
till day
-
He's kissed on the lily briest & held her shoulders
twa
But aye's she grat & aye she spat & turned to the 
wa.
-
Haud awa,
Before I lose my maidenhead, I'll try my strength with
thee
-
All thru the nicht they warsled there until the licht o day
And Willie grat & Willie spat but he could not stretch
her spey.
