I surely don't blame the audience but there is a time-keeper I am afraid we must hurry on.  In fact we are having to telescope the next two numbers both of which symbolize the mounting confidence and optimism of the Negro as is nourished on this spiritual food.  You find this triumphant not creeping in, in spite of all the suffering and sorrow it's most inspiring and I'm sure you will be very glad to listen to a short joint rendering of the next two spirituals, I'm so glad trouble don't last always, and "We're climbing Jacob's ladder" -

It's a common-place that this accommodation of circumstances and this Christian tradition set the place and the Negro's eye on the other world and gave him perhaps another worldly and in these days what we call an escapist philosophy.  But we must remember that the slave really always had his eye on freedom of the body as well as the soul.  There was that frequent phenomenon of the slave rebellion and of the still more frequent phenomenon of the fugitive slave and I think the escapist tradition of which we complain is perhaps more typical of the reconstruction than really of the slave period itself.  Because during the reconstruction we had this rather cruel blocking of the hopes of full freedom and the great disappointment that came from that.  Now of course the slave didn't get his democracy from the Bill of Rights.  He got it from his reading of the home justice of the Hebrew prophets and his concept of the Wrath of God.  Particularly his mind seized on the experience of the Jews in Egypt and on the figure of Moses, the savior of the people, leading them out from bondage and therefore there is no more musically beautiful spiritual, no more symbolic spiritual than "Go down Moses" -
