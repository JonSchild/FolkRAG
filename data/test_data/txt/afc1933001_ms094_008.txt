J. FRANK DOBIE, SECRETARY AND EDITOR

Texas Folk-Lore Society
UNIVERSITY STATION
AUSTIN, TEXAS

May 10, 1942

Dear Lomax:

    Cheer up and quit "knowing you done wrong." The jury heard
the evidence, and as judge I merely transmit their verdict -
not guilty. We had one of the best meetings we ever had.
Everybody said so. We all got together on the way home -
Mrs. Randall, Johnnie Faulk, and his wife, Frank Goodwyn, Mody
Boatright - Zenzig, too, though he does not know any more about
the Texas tradition than a hog knows about a sidesaddle. We
talked and enjoyed memories and were all feeling good when
we got to Austin about three o'clock last Sunday morning.
The best proof on earth of the success of a meeting like ours
is that people feel expansive and in a good humor with themselves.
Because they don't write to you, don't imagine that they are
disgruntled. It is trouble to write and everybody is busy. If
they were mad at you, they'd be more likely to let you know.
Yes, sir, it was a bully meeting and you pulled it off in fine
shape.

    What you say about letting the younger men have the way is
exactly what I think. This makes twenty meetings I have acted
secretary to, and one reason I feel so good over this last one
is that I have absolute confidence in the young men emerging.
Fellows like Faulk and Goodwyn don't come on every spring.
Mody Boatright is fine, too. I thought his talk one of the
best given. I am sure glad he is president. As I look back,
I can't agree with you that the time has been characteriezed
by "inefficiency on this inside." In the volumes I have
edited for the Society probably 300 individuals have cooperated
by writing. It has been my aim to bring in the people of the
land - not just school teachers, as in the American Folkl0re
Society . The people have been interested and cooperative.
They and not academicians are what give vitality to our organ-
ization. Vitality is what distinguishes it from other organiza-
tions of the kind.

    We men all enjoyed being with you and Mrs. Lomax in your
home and want to thank her as well as you. I am sorry we were late
to dinner. It wasn't my fault that we got off from Austin late.
And I wasn't any more unhappy at the dinner than Dexter Hamilton
was !!!!!

    I wrote him last Tuesday but have received no reply from him.

    My plan is now to get ten men to give $100 each and to
dedicate the book to them. We already have two of the ten -
Ed Crane and Hobitzelle. I know two in Forth Worth than I can
get. I think I'll add Stanley Marcus to the list, for he has
put up $100 in addition to turning over the Book Club of Texas
to us. You did some mighty good work there.
