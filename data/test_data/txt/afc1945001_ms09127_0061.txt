Rumors

I has not been long ago when
I heard a rumor that the allies or
the United Nations were receiving more
of our products than we were
recieving but the government
informed us that it was quite
on the contrary and that it was 
only a rumor and that we
should not listen to rumors
or pass them along because
rumor can cause plenty of
trouble.
