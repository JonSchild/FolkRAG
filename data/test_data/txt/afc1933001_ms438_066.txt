De Kalb Blues

This song was named for the East Texas town from which Lead Belly
was sent up with thirty years for murder. The guitar accompaniment
is full of grim black thunderous notes like
a death march. One listens and 
feels vaguely full of foreboding.
[The grouping of the three sets of stanzas that follow
is L.B.'s own. He has sung them thus on three different
occasions. The first set is that most often sung.
