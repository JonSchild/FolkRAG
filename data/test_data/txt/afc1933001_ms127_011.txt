of guilt. All he said was "Oh," or the equivalent and that was that. But
of course I couldn't refuse Miss True's suggestion, paralyzed though I was
at the prospect of facing what I remembered as a blank wall.

So I went in and spoke my little piece, with the idea of getting information as
to which foundation or individual I should address by letter later. Dr. 
Wilbur brightened up when I mentioned that the only field in which recording
had been consistently undertaken over a long period of time and really adequately
handled was the Indian, under the Bureau of Ethnology and the Indian
Bureau. At the moment, I swear, I had momentarily forgotten that Wilbur had
been Secretary of the Interior and that the Indian Bureau is part of the Dept.
of the Interior - it was so long ago since I'd thought of Wilbur at all.

He said that last year Julius Rosenwald told him he had a request for money
for this purpose from a University in North Carolina (I think Chapel Hill)
and Rosenwald had said: "What is this stuff they say is disappearing so
fast and must be caught quickly? Do you know anything about it? Shall I
give them some money?" At that time Wilbur knew nothing of the matter and
said so. Something I said, however, now made the connection in his mind
between this request and his own experience in setting up the Great Smoky
Mountain National Park. He told me he visited there and was struck with the
quality of the people, apparent despite the squalor of their surroundings.
But, imagine my utter astonishment when he said: "Well, I'm leaving Sunday
for the annual meeting of the trustees of all the foundations (where the
field for the following year is surveyed and divided up to avoid duplication, as
I understand it) and if you can get a memorandum in here to me day after  tomorrow,
I will be glad to present it. Someone has got to do these things!"
I thanked him, hoping my surprise was n't apparent in my manner, and rose to
go. He kept me amiably to show me a map of illiteracy in the U.S. and to
swap a story or two. What with the effort to conceal my amazement at his
interest and to avoid fizzing with enthusiasm like a bottle of champagne, I
was quite dazed when I got out to the car. Of all the people I know, R.L.W. was
the very last one I'd have [chosen] expected to be caught by anything as picturesque as
f-s recording, laboring as I have [for so long] under the impression that his
interests lay in the chillier aspects of science alone. (This is the kind of
sentence Mrs. Duvenech disapproved! & with cause!)
Well, there I was. I knew C.S. had made a very similar overture to the foundation
and been discouraged rather pointedly. I knew also that his dream of an
enormous undertaking with himself at the head of it would make him feel I should
divert the opportunity of presenting such a memorandum to him. Not only was
there no time for this but I did not feel that a separate organization needs to
be set up, nor that a possible donor would feel that the undertaking would justify
the additional administrative expense necessary in a separate organization.
Also I felt what the situation called for was an informal and picturesque presentation
rather than the scholarly one which nobody can do better than Charlie.
All this is extremely confidential, of course; but I felt I must explain it because
it seems necessary to me to avoid mentioning to C.S. that this proposal
has been made. My first thought was to send him a copy; but he would be mortally
offended by my failure to mention him. I could n't help it, I simply could n't
see it his way. I said what I did about you to counteract the impression that
Librarians are narrowly conservative and covered with dust, and that Chiefs
of the M-D- are necessarily personally unpleasant people; but it might have been
better to omit even so much about personalities, the more so as my own feeling
about the matter is entirely impersonal. As I thought the matter over, I simply
could n't see any other way for it to be done.

I don't know whether you have realized it but I was removed from under C.S.'s
wing in March to do a much broader job not centered around music exclusively.
