Sunday - The anal itch has come back
rather violently, but I think
I know what it is at last.
When I was with Robin
actually embracing her, loving her
with all my heart, loving her in
spite of the fact she did not love me,
I noticed that for the first time
in [my life] years there was no sensation
there except a pleasant lack of
it.
But in Northampton and
especially here the itch has returned
It comes especially in the morning. 
Rather in place of a morning erection
At least now I have no morning erections.
There's also another side -
the side of surrendering. I always
lay abed with Robin not caring
