Dear Miss Berry:

Thank you for your kind letter.  I would greatly
appreciate, and regard as an important contribution to
the Archive of American Folksong any material relating
to French folk music in Vincennes.  I should be 
particularly interested in obtaining accurate transcriptions
of the songs sung by Mrs. Caney.  I understand 
that you have done a great deal of work in this
field, that you know Mrs. Caney's songs extremely
well.  Any material which you have that might contribute
to the classification, identification and study of 
Vincennes songs would be of great value for the Archive.

I regret that you were not in Vincennes at the time
that I visited Mrs. Caney and, therefore, I have not had
the opportunity of meeting you.  If you are ever to be
in the East I think you would be much interested in
visiting the Archive and I certainly should be delighted
to receive you.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
