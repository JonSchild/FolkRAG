To the Members of Local 28, UFWA:

As we stated in our letter of June 27, we are
going to send you from time to time a report concerning
union matters, in order that you may keep in
touch with your organization.  We hope that one result
will be that more of the members will take an interest
and an active part in the work of the Local so that
the burden shall not be carried by a small group.

We renew our urgent invitation to all the members
to attend the meetings of the Executive Committee,
which are held at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesdays, as a rule,
in Room 30, Main Building.  Come and join in the discussion
of union matters, express your opinion and
help solve the problems of the Local.

We are glad to be able to report a cordial response
to our call for voluntary contributions to our
Educational Fund.  The final figures are not yet in
but, if the present rate is kept up, the Local will
have funds each month for substantial activities in
keeping our own members informed as to the labor
movement and in spreading literature among non-members
with a view to persuading them to join.

In this connection, if you are not receiving
the CIO News semi-monthly (monthly in June, July and
August) notify the secretary (Marcia Harrison, Catalog
Division), as this is the best labor paper in the
East and you don't want to miss it.  If you change
your address, inform the secretary at once.

With these letters to the members we plan to
distribute literature of interest to working people.
This does not mean, however, that the union necessarily
endorses every word of everything we distribute.
We believe you are able to do your own thinking and
are interested in anything that concerns labor.
