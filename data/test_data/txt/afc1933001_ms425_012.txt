AMERICA, THE BEAUTIFUL

Oh, beautiful, for rolling plains
Where fertile acres lie;
The home of men who feed the world--
Why must her beauties die!
America! America!
Why must the sons of earth
For rightful gain seek but in vain
In this land of their birth?

Oh, beautiful for Law and Right
Proclaimed by heroes dead;
Where Peace and plenty filled the land
And multitudes were fed!
America! America!
Redeem thy pledge to men
That all may be content and free
And justice rule again.

Oh beautiful for pioneers
Who cleared thy fertile soil
And reared they sons to build thy fame
With hard and honest toil.
America! America!
Restore thy hope again;
And raise them to their rightful place
Among the sons of men.

PEACE HYMN OF THE WORLD

(Tune: Battle Hymn of the Republic)

Mine eyes have seen the splendor of the promis of the Lord,
Men are beating swords to plowshares in accordance with His word,
The music of His footsteps by the nations now is heard,
His peace is marching on!

CHORUS:
Peace and friendliness forever,
Peace and friendliness forever,
Peace and friendliness forever,
Good will and peace to men.

Lift high the shining banners with Good Will in every fold,
Let the angles sing it over as they did in days of old,
To every land in sorrow the glad story shall be told,
Good Will and Peace to men!
