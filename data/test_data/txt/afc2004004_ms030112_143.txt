They were on the top floor. I went there a number of times at Tiny's house you know. He used to teach lessons there cause a lot of people didn't know the way up to the Bronx and he decided that it was better for him to go to 110th street, Tiny's house that where she was.
LARRY:
So Lead was living there at that time.
MRS. DAVIS:
Yeah, they was in the same building but different apartments, you know.
LARRY:
