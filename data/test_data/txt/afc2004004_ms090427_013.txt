The Folk Culture Study in Coahoma County, Mississipi -- 11

stratification of people in the towns.  The churches differ in form
of worship from one to the other.  The lodges which collapsed in the 
depression struggle feebly to resurrect themselves.  The burial
society, which is a form of insurance, offers none of the social
values which characterized the lodge.  The middle class lost many of
its members in the collapse of the cotton boom.  Those who remain are 
simply middle class people stripped of leadership claims or influence.
There is greater standardization.  The radio and the joke box have
made for a standardization of music tastes.  There remains a little of
the river, much of the railroad, along with the confused beginnings
of the highway culture.
