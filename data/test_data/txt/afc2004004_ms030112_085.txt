MRS. DAVIS:
Well, I think he was grown when his mother, his father passed away long before his mother. But his mother, he remembers his mother very well because he say used to work in tobacco back in Durham, and he was a little boy. He kidded me so bad, he said when his mother passed away he had more people piled up there because they thought he had money, you know.
LARRY:
Yes, he told me about that. Cousin Jane and Cousin John.
MRS. DAVIS:
Came up after his mother passed away.
LARRY:
Yeah he told me about that.
MRS. DAVIS:
He can remember things from way back.
LARRY:
I guess he and his mother was kind of close, I guess it was his mother that helped get his education, or music or whatever it was.
MRS. DAVIS:
He wasn't so much devoted to his mother as he was to his grandmother.
It was his grandmother because he said his mother would curse him
out, all the time.
LARRY:
His mother would?
MRS. DAVIS:
Curse him out the day he was born, cursed him out all the time
