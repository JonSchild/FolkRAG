King Oliver, Con'd. He was called Bad Eye--had a cataract. Heard
him in 1909 when I was standing around the Twenty-Five's. Heard
music. It was Bad Eye. Everything stopped in New Orleans when
you heard music. That was when I first noticed Bad Eye. He played
hot, but he couldn't play as much as Freddie Keppard. This style
was going around like wild fire.

George Bakay (or Baquette), first jazz clarinet. Now in Philadelphia
and is legitimate--just a corn-fed clarinet player. Played in "Burning
Icebergs" and "Pretty Lil." Was with Bill Johnson when his
Creole Band was first around.

Frankie Duzen--one of the first jazz trombone players.

You can play hot and it won't be playing jazz. You can play a
hot mountain number and it won't be jazz. Hot means something
spicy. Jazz is a style that can be applied to any type. Dirty
is what you call low down.

"Beat the box" means play the piano. "Play the box" means play the
guitar. "Co? it and kick it" --take a metal mute half way out of
the horn. "Kick it"means use a free lance idea of swing. Jazz
is a  name that has no meaning at all. I started using the word
"jazz" in 1902. That was to show the people the difference between
ragtime.

[*Dance Rhythms*]
Stomps--a little bit slower tempo than jazz. I used these terms
to baffle the public. I used the word "bump"--"Tank Town Bump."
"Creep"--something that was very soft and smooth. You played it
in the parlor and couldn't hear it in the kitchen. You would have
to "creep" in. "Scrawnch"--I first heard it when Cecil and Laurel
Scott of Springfield, Ohio took it from a dance they used in Ohio.
(Cecil Scott is now playing with Teddy Hill--a good tenor sax player.)

Roy Palmer, beat trombone player. Very good natured guy was was
never on time. His main idea was to become a first class auto
mechanic. He was always greasy on the job. Used to bring his
broken down car everywhere. When he was on the stage in my bands,
used to pull the curtain so you could only hear the trombone and
not see him. Used to have a sign on his window--"Music taught on
all Instruments" but he couldn't play nothing but the trombone.
Didn't accept steady jobs very much. Wanted to do gigs' "gig" is
a very short job. You always had to bet his trombone out of  hock
before he could play. Ugly fellow, very funny. No doubt the best
that ever lived on a hot trombone. Geroge Brunes {Breines} was very much
respected, but Palmer was his idol. Palmer now out of the business.
He always wanted to be doing something else, 'specially fixing
machines. Always talking about how he fixed his automobiles.

George Brunis was original trombone player with the New Orleans
Rhythm Kings. Used to be with Ted Lewis. Played solo on the "Tin
Roof Blues". Learned his stuff from Roy Palmer. He played more
than Ory and better. [*Still alive, Palace Hotel, 45th St., N.Y.C.*]
