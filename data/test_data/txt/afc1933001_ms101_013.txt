Dear John Lomax:
Thank you for forwarding to us the recent letter from Mrs. Christine Eggleston of Buffalo, N.Y. We are handling your recommendation about the collection of the tunes by referring it to Professor Harold Thompson at Cornell who may have student collectors from the Buffalo area. As I indicated in my last letter, we are attempting more and more to assist local institutions to bring their own archives into being, and one way of doing this is to refer local inquirers and informants to people on the various university campuses.
In connection with this last, the Librarian has asked me to represent Library at the forthcoming inauguration of the new president of Rice, so that I shall be in Houston on April 10. I, of corse, want to see you in Dallas after that date if you are going to be there and we can then, I hope, talk of the possibility of cooperating with Southern Methodist.
Your new I have seen and like very much. It was well worth-while doing and I don't believe that the delay in publishing will affect sales in any way since interest in the field continues to hold up strongly. We will add it to the list of books which we recommend to the general inquirer.
With best wishes,
Sincerely yours,
Duncan Emrich
