17 December, 1934,

Dear Sir:

Your letter of November twenty-seventh reached me here after completion of a four year detail as Commanding Officer of the Naval Prison at Portsmouth, N. H.

I regret that I know of no songs at Portsmouth which could be classed as strictly prison songs. The routine there called for assembly in the auditorium three nights per week three quarters of an hour in advance of the showing of sound pictures. On Tuesdays and Fridays the men sang the popular songs of the day. On Sunday evening they sang the old- time religious songs, and this latter type were sung with very evident devotion. The men really enjoyed them as did the guests. But at no time were there ever any songs such as you seek. Our aim was to make men forget as far as possible that they were completely sit aside from the world. Rather our endeavor was to restore self-respect and self-confidence and to better equip the men to take an honorable place in society when released.

Yours very truly,

J. A. Rossell
