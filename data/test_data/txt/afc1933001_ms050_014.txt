Mrs. Minta Morgan
Bells
Texas

My dear Mrs. Morgan:
    In the last letter you wrote to me, you complained
that we didn't bring our machine back to Bells and do
further recording before we left Texas. The truth of
the matter is that we had no machine at that time. The
Library of Congress wired us for it in Lubbock and we
returned it direct to Washington from there.
    Miss Terry would certainly have enjoyed seeing
you and your boys again, but in driving back to Washing-
ton we didn't come close to Bells. Someday we'll be back
to see you. Meanwhile, believe us always gratefully and
sincerely yours,

P. S.
    Were you able to get the music written down for
the one or two songs I mentioned?
