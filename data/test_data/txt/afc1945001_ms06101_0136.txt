Richmond, Va., Monday, August 3, 1942
It was reported to me in Richmond that tank cars were being
used to carry oil from Greensboro, North Carolina, which is a rationed
area, to Tennessee, which is an unrationed oil area. The story was
told to illustrate how unnecessary it was for North Carolina to be in
the rationed area and how unplanned and foolish the whole handling was
of the oil situation.
