Eddie Ricenbacker

Eddie Ricenbacker started his career 
at the age of twelve.  Even then he was a 
reckless youth.  Eddie decided to become 
a flyer because of a very funny incident.  

One day as he was driving his 
automobile very fast he got stopped by 
a police-man who was very angry and 
told Eddie that he ought to fly above 
the street if he wanted to go so fast. 

Eddie laughed and said that 
this was a very good idea.  Eddie is 
now one of the best flyers that we 
have.  Many times Eddie was given up 
for dead but he always returned alive 
and raring to go again.
