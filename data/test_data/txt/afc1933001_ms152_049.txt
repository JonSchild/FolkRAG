My Dear Mr Lomax -
   Remember me - Mrs. Bryant
of Evansville Ind.
   Just happened to turn on
the radio this P.M. and
imagine my surprise
when I heard your name
mentioned.  Well I listened
in and heard you sing
"The little brown Bull."
   So you can sing you said
you would sing for me
some time.  I am so
sorry I have been missing
