Dear Sirs:

I should like to request permission to use in a choral
fantasy on American folk tunes for men's voices some of the
following tunes and words from American Ballads and Folk Songs
by John and Alan Lomax:

Rosie (page 62)
Sourwood mountain (page 276)
Shortenin' Bread (page 234)
This Train (page 593)

The proposed work would not consist of separate "arrangements"
but would be of extended and free nature. Acknowledgement of the
source of these tunes would of course be made. I hope it will
be possible for you to grant this permission.

Very truly yours,
Richard Donoram
