The wish rumors described above, while reflecting certain character
traits, are also potent as weapons. The complacency they induce obstructs
the war effort at times as much as deliberate sabotage. "Rationing is unnecessary." "We will all have synthetic tires soon." "The salvage campaigns
are just designed to make us war conscious. They are not really
needed." "The war will soon be over." All of these get in the way.

The seriousness of the problem of rumor as desired above naturally
gives rise to considering the need for counteraction. Thus far, only a few
tentative steps have been taken specifically in this direction. The rumor
clinic newspaper column in Boston has been copied elsewhere. There are general anti-rumor campaigns, but the problem of neutralizing specific rumors
requires careful consideration.

How can we get relevant information insufficient quantity to satisfy
people's interests without threatening national security? How an we prevail
against completely unfounded rumors? Programs must be worked out
thoroughly and carefully based upon fullest understanding of the problem,
for the following is not a unique case:

"Mr. F said that he had met a guy who worked in one of the largest
hospitals in New York and that this guy told him he just got a 
call from the hospital that the whole staff had to leave at once
because a terrible disaster had happened. Mr. F inquired as to
where the disaster was but the hospital employee said he knew nothing 
more. Mr. F said he became very surprised because he hadn't heard
anything on the radio about this. He further said that after he 
left the guy he turned on the radio but still didn't hear anything
about the disaster. He said he was very worried over this because 
maybe it was so bad the radio and newspapers couldn't mention it."
(New York, August 13)
