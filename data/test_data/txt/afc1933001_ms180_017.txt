Gentlemen:

Would you be kind enough to send me a
notation of the funds paid me during
the current taxable year so that I may
give the Bureau of Internal Revenue a 
proper accounting of my income.

A self-addressed, stamped envelope is 
enclosed.

I would appreciate your getting this 
information to me before Saturday.

Very truly yours,
