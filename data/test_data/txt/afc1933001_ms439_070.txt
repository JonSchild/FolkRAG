Dick-Licker's Holler

It was soon one mornin', I could not lay back down,
I was lookin' right at her, was standin' in hermornin' gown.

I say, sweet mama, I hate to see you cry,
But you know your man, baby, was born to die.

It was late on night when I made my round,
I found my baby and I blowed her down.

I went back home, Lawd an' I went to bed,
I put my pistol under my head.

It was soon that mornin', jus' befo' day,
I went to de depot tryin' to make my get-away.

The sheriff overtaken me and I was dressed in black,
He put me on the train and he brought me back.

When he overtaken me he put hand-cuffs on my hands,
When he brought me back, says, "Nigger, ain' you de man?"

My dear kind friend, I mighty glad to see you,
I got something to tell you, don't let it fret you.

I met your wife an' another fello,
They was down in de alley mighty close togetho.

(He was talkin' to his friend to git him in trouble)

What they was doin' old boy I couldn' tell.
But I know good and well they was raisin' Hell.

Dicklicker could sing that song an' he didn' care. Yassuh,
that was a nigger didn' care about nothin' an' nobody. Settin'
in jail there he jus' kep' a holl'in' that ol' song."
