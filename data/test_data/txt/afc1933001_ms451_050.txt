Built me a house in Baltimore
16 stories high 
Every story in [that] my house
Full of chicken pie.

Sing on the mountain hill
    "     "     "         "            "
    "     "     "         "            "    [*below?*]
    "     "     "         "            "
I done had my fun.

What makes your head so read?
