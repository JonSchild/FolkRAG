Fisk, 20. 13.
We want the mourners [you] to be here at sundown [by sun-up]." Well. I didn't have more'n but two miles to
go, and it didn't look like to me I'd [would] ever git there -- looks like the weight
of the world was on me -- and I started out. And I met one of [the] my
playmates [plowmen] comin on a mule -- he was riding-- and he looked at me [, and] he say,
"You prayin, ain't you?" Say, "Yes." And he just moved [off] on.
Now let me tell you -- they say, "Oh, that's all foolishness." Of
course, it may be all foolishness to you, but tain' [it not] foolishness to me.
I couldn't drink water. I couldn't eat. I couldn't rest nowhere [anywhere] I
went. And that Saturday night I went to the church and they say mourners [that prayer]
prayer meeting there was just two or three brothers there when I got there.
And they said, "Here's one mourner [more] -- we're gonna start." And they started.
And I got to saying, "Lord, have mercy," and when I found myself,
I's sayin [said], "Thank God. Thank God."
And I want to tell you all I didn't stop -- everywhere I go I wanted
everybody to know it. I went to town & [down to] everywhere, and that was the
glades [greatest] and the happiest time ever I felt in all my life. My hands looks new to me. My feet
felt new. The light shined brighter. The people looked better. Everything
looked better. And it just felt [looked] like to me then if I could throw my
arms around the world [it] and carry all to Heaven.
[*mounting
fervor -- liquid tone of
love in the voice --
his old eyes flashing
soft fire -- His moustaches
quivering with emotion.
The sweet voice of a boy --
breaking beneath the deep
harsh tones of the old man's voice*]
