My dear Mr. Lomax:

At a recent meeting of the Committee instituted by the
Conference on Inter-American Relations in the Field of Music,
called last October by the Division of Cultural Relations of
the Department of State, there was felt the need of a subcommittee
on popular and folk music upon whose advice we might
rely in furthering knowledge and study of the music of the
United States and Latin America. I am writing to ask you if
you will be good enough to help us by serving on such a subcommittee,
along with Messrs. Ralph Boggs, Benjamin A. Botkin,
Robert Winslow Gordon, George Pullen Jackson, Mrs. Irma G.
LaBastille, and Miss Eleanor Hague.

Dr. Charles Seeger will serve as chairman of the subcommittee
on popular and folk music and, as soon as we have your
acceptance, will communicate with you regarding problems and
suggestions.

I should greatly appreciate hearing from you at an early
date, so that Dr. Seeger may proceed to consult you concerning
certain items on the agenda of the above mentioned subcommittee.

Very sincerely yours,
Wm Berrien
William Berrien, Chairman
