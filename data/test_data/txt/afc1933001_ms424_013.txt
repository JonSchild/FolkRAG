MARCH! MARCH!

(Sheet Music - G. Schirmer Co.)


March, March, march, march,
March, comrades, march along,
March, March, march, march,
March, a hundred million strong!
On through dark and battle's roar!
On where none has dared before.
On to pay the age's score,
March, march, march.
Forward, comrades, march, march for ever,
Up with the break of day,
Out on the trackless way,
Ours the will that must and can,
Ours to crown creation's plan,
Ours to win the world for man:
March, comrades, march!

March, March, march, march,
March, comrades, march along,
March, March, march, march,
March, a hundred million strong!
One in vision, one in will,
We shall carry Zion's hill,
God is in His heaven still
March, march, march.
Forward, comrades, march, march for ever!
Up with the break of day,
Out on the trackless way,
Ours the heart to dare and do,
Ours the promised land to view,
Ours to build the world anew,
March, comrades, march.
