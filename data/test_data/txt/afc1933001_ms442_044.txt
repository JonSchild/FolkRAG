Po' Howard

"Ol' Howard is dead an' gone," and nobody is [sad] sorry for didn't the
[pa] "po' boy" [with his last breath command Lead Belly] leave Lead Belly here to
sing this song; and when Lead Belly plays [the Spanish] "the
Spanish fandang" and sings, nobody can be [sad] [sorry] sad sad because
first Lead Belly, then his guitar, and [at times] then both of them
together [talk to your toes] talk to your [feet] toes. "If you can't
dance, your foot's gonna pat."

Lead Belly learned [this song] "Po' Howard" [when] along with "Green Corn" when
he was fourteen and used to follow [around] [the countryside] two
[young] [fellows] young courting fellows who [had] carried a guitar and a mandolin
and played for [the] dances around Mornjingsport. That was before Lead Belly had a 
guitar of his own, [and] when he [used] couldn't sleep at night for thinking
about one.
