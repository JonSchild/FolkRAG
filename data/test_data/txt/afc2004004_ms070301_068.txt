I can't hear myself for all this
noise -

He'll skin a flea for its hide
& tallow & never bury its bones

--

That's your conceit of it.

Well, God is good & the devil isn't
bad either!

God Almighty's a real gentleman!
(Sean says they'd never say that in Ireland)

I'll leave him to God & he'll
play the devil with him.

A pig in the stye doesn't know
the pig on the road -

Butter to butter is no relish.

- -

Three [x] without rule - a [wife woman a] pig,
a mule & a wife -

A woman has an excuse readier
than an apron -

You'll have a ring on your finger
& not a stitch on your back -
