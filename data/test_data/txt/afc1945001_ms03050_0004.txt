SPECIAL REPORT ON RUMORS HEARD FROM AUGUST 3 UNTIL NOON AUGUST 8, 1942

During the period covered by this report rumors heard in the
Columbia territory have been less numerous than during any similar period
since the United States became an active participant in the war. Immediately
after Pearl Harbor rumors were so prevalent that as many as half a dozen
could be heard within a twenty-four hour period. As time passed, however,
there was a marked decrease in the number of rumors heard on the streets 
and those which were circulated were less fantastic than those heard
during and immediately after December, 1941. 

Since August 3, six rumors have come to our attention and some
of these have been heard several times in different sections of the
Columbia territory. 

1. We have heard repeatedly on buses, on the streets, and in stores
and other gathering places, rumors to the effect that great numbers of
troops are being sent from Fort Jackson to ports of embarkation. In each
instance the person stating the rumor said that the troops were being
moved in connection with the establishment of a second front by the allies. 

The first time this rumor was heard was on Monday, August 3, when
a woman passenger on a bus told a woman sitting beside her that a friend
of hers who was married to an army officer was giving up her apartment and
disposing of her furniture. The officer was leaving within a week for an
over-seas destination. The woman to whom this statement was made said she
also had friends who were making similar arrangements for the same reason.
