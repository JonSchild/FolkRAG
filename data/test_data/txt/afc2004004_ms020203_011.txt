[*His m-in law hates him*]
Say it look like putting him in prisoner won't do him
no good.  [Look like] Say they ought to kill him.  Just kill him.
Say, oo"  She ain't got a bit of use for him.  She's down there 
now.  She just hate him.  She nor none of her sisters don't like
him. ...He don't pay them a bit of tention in the world.  Don't
even go to the house.  (High delighted laughter)
[*George never goes to church*]
A:  Would he ever go to church or anything like that?
V:  Never does.  Never does, If people pass by up there where he
stops at, he have no certain place to stay--he spose to be livin
out in the country with his mother; he calls that home but he
comes over town and sleeps on folks porches sit up out there in
yard when its hot in the summer time - and people pass there
goin up there to the First Baptist church go right by up there
where he hang out at he holler an tell em all "You all goin'
to church ain't yuh?"  Yeah George you better come on and go wid
us today."  "Naw I won't go up there.  Ask you all just give God
my love.  Tell him I'm still here."  He's funny, you know,
and everybody just laugh and say, "George, there ain't nothin'
for you but torment.  [You] The Lord wouldn't have you nowhere.  He
wouldn't have you to take the folks suitcases and carry them
into heaven.  He wouldn't have you to do nothin' round the gates
He wouldn't have you do nothin' up there because he isn't
going to have you in the path that leads into heaven."
He don't never go to church.  I never have known him to be in
church in my life and I been knowin' him for years & years.  He's just not goin' [no matter] don't care what goin' on up there.
