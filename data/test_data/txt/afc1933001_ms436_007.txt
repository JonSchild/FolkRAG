The first thing I did was to inquire was there any piano players in town.
This was down on Beale street you have heard so much about.  They told me
that he best piano player in Tennessee was right in Memphis, guy named
Benny Frenchy, probably the best in the whole country.  Well, that kind 
of frightened me.  I wouldn't even try to touch a piano until I could
hear Benny.
He played generlly in a place called the Monarch Saloon, run
by a white fellow by the name of Mike Haggerty, the toughest guy in Tennessee.
When the police locked some [in] of the visitors or hand-arounders 
or gamblers that gambled in his place, why he would walk into the station 
and say," Turn them out and don't bother none of the people that hang 
around my place."  And the police department didn't have any trouble in 
getting prisoners out immediately.   The Monarch was barricaded, too, 
barricaded with steel and iron to keep the policemen out and they had 
strict orders not to go back in the gambling room and there was no way 
for them to go back there and come out alive.  I think the saloon was 
supposed to close at one o'clock, but that didn't mean a thing to the 
Monarch.  All they would do was to pull the shades down and keep going 
all night long.
Now Benny Frenchy, he had certain days he came to the saloon 
and he was a natural drawing card.  Everybody would come down from Jim 
Kernan's honky-tonk, one of the lowest on the water front, all the toughest 
killers and prize fighters of low calibre that would probably kill for four 
bits.
And when Benny would show up, all the low class whores would gather 
round and say," Oh, play it, Mr. Frenchy, play it".  And everybody would be
[standing around the piano and how these girls would be kicking ?]
