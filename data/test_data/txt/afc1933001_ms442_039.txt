[In] [?h] [the] [d??ad] During the World  War and the [daced] decade [?] previous, [there] [?] the business of "ballit" Negroes. [Many Wandering singers, many of them itinerant ministers, made a good [businness] thing of [selling] [*hawking*],for a price that ranged from a nickle to twenty-five cents, copies of the songs [that] they sang, printed on one side of [colored] sheets of vari-colored paper.
