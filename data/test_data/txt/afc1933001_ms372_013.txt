it was his favorite song.Nor,did he "forget" to give my publishers and
me permission to make known this fact and use it on our printed copies of
Home on the Range. And he THOUGHT to autograph to me the steel engraving
of himself that now sits on my piano!

Mr.Lomax took a crack at my stationery--a Christmas gift,years back,from
a friend.If my friend saw me unseated atop a bucking broncho,xxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx riding high,wide and handsome,that,too,is none
of Mr. Lomax's business!

I ride no worse that I write.And,if my Home on the Range was "timely",to
again quote Mr. Lomax,well--most of the Guion compositions have been "timely".
Lucky me!
