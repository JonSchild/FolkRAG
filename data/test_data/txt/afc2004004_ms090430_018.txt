   In spite of the service of the river to the soil, however, some of 
the lands have been cultivated to clean crops and have become deficient in
certain plant foods, particularly nitrogen.  The levees in holding back the 
river hold back also the rich deposits of the Mississippi flood waters.  The
loam soils yield from one-half to one bale of cotton per acre.  The buckshot
clay soil is considered the most productive cotton soil in the Delta but more
difficult to cultivate than the loam.  When climatic and cultural conditions
have been favorable, yields of two bales per acre have been obtained from
buckshot soil.  The poorest soil in the county is waxy swamp clay, which has
been little cultivated, principally on account of its undrained condition and
because when drained it requires the addition of ground limestone and green 
manures to bring it to a satisfactory level of productivity.

The People
   Bolivar County is almost wholly agricultural, with cotton as the 
exclusive crop, and the organization for production the plantation system 
at its best.  Eighty-three per cent of the male gainful workers in 1930 were
engaged in agriculture, approximately 73 per cent of the land area was in 
farms, and 86.6 per cent of the crop land harvested was planted to cotton.
In this same year the County produced 176,998 bales of cotton, ranking Bolivar
County first among the cotton producing counties in the state.  In 1934, 
12,432, or 95.6 per cent of the 13,000 farms in the county were producing
cotton.  In 1935 there were 2,443 white farm operators and 10,560 Negro farm
operators in the county.  Of these, 1,756 (72 per cent) of the white and 
10,127 (96 per cent) of the Negro operators were tenants.  Landowners are few
