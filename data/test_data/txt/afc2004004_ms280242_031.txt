     He was a gruffy old farmer who wouldn't part much money for
the boys, and they made a laughing stock of him. They went and 
stole his milk and butter. He wouldn't give ye a match or a drink
of water if ye'd go to the door. You could hear them singing
these songs going on at theplough, with the seagulls and the
birds at the back saying, "Whhssh man, come oot o' that. What
do ye strak aven aboot that!"

Jimmy Raeburn:
1) My name is Jimmy Raeburn, in Glasgow I was born,
My hame and habitations I'm forced to leave with scorn,
My hame and habitations I'm forced to gang awa',
Is to leave the bonny hills an' dales of Caledonia.
2) Early there one morning, just by the break of day,
When we overheard the turnkey, unto us he did say,
"Arise, ye helpless convicts, arise ye ane and a',
For this is the day we stray away from Caledonia.
3) We all arose, put on our clothes, our hearts were full of grief.
Our friends, they all stood round the coach, they could grant us no relief.
Our friends, they stood around the coach, their hearts were broke in twa,
So see us leave the bonny hills and dales of Caledonia.
4) Far-weel, my aged mother, I'm vexed with what I've done,
I hope that none will up to you cast the race that I have run,
I hope you'll be provided for when I am far awa',
Far far frae the bonny hills and dales of Caledonia.
5) Here's to my honoured father, he was the best of men,
Likewise to my sweetheart, young Kathleen is her name
Nae mair we'll walk by Clyde's clear stream or doon by the Broomilaw,
Fareweel, ye bonny hills and dales o' Caledonia.
6) But e'er we chance to meet again, I hope it'll be above,
Where hallelujahs will be sung to him who reigns in love.
No earthly judge will judge us then, but He that rules us all,
Fare-weel, ye bonny hills and dales of Caledonia.

     Jimmy Raeburn was a Glasgow man, whose father was a publican;
and for some stealing he done he was put away on an island for it.
The old fellows of fifty or sixty knows it, but not the young
class of people at all. . . ..
