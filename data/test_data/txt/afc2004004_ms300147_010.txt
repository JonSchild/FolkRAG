on the no It was the
other number I had in mind
the union song I wrote
so don't give me credit
for the 16 tons you can
change it to unknown
no. I'll record the other
no. & send to you I'm working
on several other to. Sorry
I made a mistake on that no
But I was feeling Bad & all in 
that night. & wasn't thinking
so you can make a change
in the 16 tons number
           Wishing you the Best
            of everything
