Efficient government services are impartial, exact, well-organized, 
they don't have personal favorites, or whimsical hours of
work. They have reasonable regulations and rules.

Arbitrary and inconsistent wage rates and hour schedules
ungear good government service. Oppressive and badly organized
overtime saps the stamina of government. Inadequate equipment
and difficult working conditions hamper honest diligent
effort, imprison the incentive of conscientious employees.

The plague of good government is maladministration.

Federal workers want the government service to be a good
service.

Good government is the strength of democracy. Good government
is sensitive to public needs, quick to react to them. When
the arteries of government harden, when its response to public
needs is feeble, when administrative senility sets in, democracy
is in danger.

Vigorous, sensitive, democratic government services are the
first defenses of democracy.

Defenses are not mechanical however. The infantry that does
sentry for our democracy is made up of government workers.
Their welfare is a measure of the effectiveness of the defense.
Their morale is the gauge that measures the morale of democracy
itself. The welfare of the public servant describes the well-being
of the public service.

The United Federal Workers of America seeks only to make 
it possible for government workers to do their work without
friction and get a decent satisfaction from doing it. The government
worker, like everyone else, wants to enjoy his work.
He makes no apology for this. He wants only to work under 
decent conditions, to be able to earn the right to promotion, and
to be able to correct his just complaints.

It Works This Way

In the interest of the federal service and the federal servant,
the United Federal Workers of America proposes practical machinery
for the settlement of grievances.
