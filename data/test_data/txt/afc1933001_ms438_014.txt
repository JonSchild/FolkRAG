Send Down Yo' Han'

Since the men do most of the sinful signing, one seldom hears the woman's side pf the case. In the blues it's forever "that. mis-treating' women," but in real life the women get most of the hard knocks and the men most of the gravy. A man can be faithful and admired because of it, but a women is suspected at once of being evil-hearted, Lead Belly the exception to all rules, expects his women to be no more faithful than himself; he does, however, believe the all women are obligated to him in certain respects, in the same way, perhaps, as artists of the Italian Renaissance believed that wealthy were obligated to support them. This blues, with its magnified guilty accomplishment, probably grows out of such a feeling.
