     . . .  I can. Every Saturday and Sunday, just about.
     How do you explain that?
     Love it. Have to go every weekend . . .                   tuned up just
right.
     How does it make you feel when you sing?
     Feels good. I enjoy that better than anything else. . .
     Were you raised pretty hard by your Daddy? Did he really make
you mind.
     Oh, yeah.
     How'd he do that?
     He used, he used a hickory on us . . .
     You all sung at home, did you, between times?
     Sung, we sang at home . . .                                  sing at home,
everything. I done the same thing when I was raisin' my kids. We'd
sing at home. . .
     But you like to do a lot of other things around here. I hear you're
a big square dancer.
     Oh, yeah, I do a little square dancin'. I do more coon huntin'
than anythin'. I'm a big coon hunter.
     When do you go huntin' and where do you get 'em?
     Well, I do all the huntin' in south Georgia and south Alabama in the
wintertime. Don't do much huntin' through the summer months, but do
lots through the winter months.
     Do Sacred Harp and coon huntin' go together--two sides of a different
thing?
     Well, that's my, that's what I love anyway--all the Sacred Harp and
all the coon huntin', all the same thing.
