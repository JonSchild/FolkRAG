[*(Sonny)*]

Well, Bill, let me tell you one now. I knowed a fellow
once, he was bad about lyin on people. In other words, a lot of
people try to make peace and and lot of people try to break peace.
Well, Sam was [?] peace-breakin, just lyin, you understand. This
time he told the neighbors a lie on John's wife.

So John called him one mornin--they had always been friends--
John called Sam, "Sam, come here." Sam goes up there--"What you
want, John?"

John say, "Now I told you to quit lyin on me, didn't I?"

"Yes, you did tell me, but I ain't lied. . ."

"Yes, you did," says John, "You lied on me and lied on
my people, now you done lied on my wife. I'm gonna kill you." John
had a Winchester with him. Sam didn't have nothin. So John out with
that Winchester, shot at Sam. Doggone, Sam taken off right down
side the ditch and through the bushes and John took that 30:30
Winchester and cut a limb off right above Sam's head. Then [he] Sam taken
off running, sure enough.

As Sam moved across the field there, he jumped a deer.
Him and that deer--you know a deer can naturally run--him and the
deer was running side and side and Sam [talking to] ask the deer, say,
[“Deer,] "[y]You been meddlin in John's business, too?" The deer was
runnin so fast, he was gruntin--"UNH*UNH*UNH*UNH!

Sam say," I says, is you been messin in John's business?"
You know, when the deer couldn't get away from Sam, he's scared,
so he went, [BA* ANH] "BAA---!"

Sam say, "BAA--, hell. If you been messing in John's
business, you better take that damned chair off your head and
[come on here.”] get moving!"
