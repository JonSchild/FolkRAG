=DONA GAL.=                                        Louise Henson
#3/4
Were a lone Dona Gal in the rain and
Hail got to drive the-se do-ggies down
The trail it's rain or shine sleet or snow 
me and my Dona Gal are on
The go. Yes rain or shine sleet or snow-
Men and my Dona Gal are bound to go-
#3/4 humor whistle
Get a long
Little doggie on your way.
