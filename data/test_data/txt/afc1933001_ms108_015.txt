of France breathing stronger in
him than any other class I've watched
[Military service, by the way, is compulsory
from twenty to twenty-two.
They earn 50 centimes a day (about
1 1/2 cents) and work like the devil]
But God, they're so French. And
being so, they're about the most
romantic army I've nearly ever
met. With even the common soldat
wearing light blue capes that
nearly touch the ground and a
navy blue beret pulled way down
over an ear, you can imagine
how they'd stride about. Elizabeth
and I picked us up five at the
Carnival ; hence this discourse.
And we nearly got us a whole
military band at the Bastaille des Fleurs
at Beaulieu ; in fact we would
have gotten them if we hadn't
been with the others who took
us away with firmness. Elizabeth

is getting prettier daily and she
just drags 'em in..
    
If I weren't so tired I would
search my soul about my sudden
succumbing to the military tradition.
But E. and I are looked on
so generally as whores we are glad
to find someone to talk to. I don't
know why we are so conspicuous,
but good women fairly draw their
skirts aside when we pass. These
soldats have been very nice to
us, and between all five, I
think we have a fairly good
cross section of the French [yoiatli] vlins. Remind
me to tell you about Benhamon 
some time. "I swim like
a fish," he says, and he is so completely
convinced of his own intelligence
that you practically [think] agree with
[so too] every statement like that. And smooth as the devil.
He'll ask you to sleep with him
one minute and have you convinced
that that's [in] only a French conversational
amenity the next.. Elizabeth
& I stood for him one night,
