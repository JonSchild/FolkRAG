Nert [had a kind of] had a burned hand, and he used to wear a kind of a stocking over it.
[*insert in preceding page*]
He was seemingly simple to me - I think he was a half wit. [*[*]In fact I'm
sure that he was.[*]*] He would laugh and go on [*[*]and he wanted to have some kin
[so he would have some] kind of (an) importance in New Orleans and he wanted to be [noticed] known as such. All of
those boys in New Orleans dressed very well, [but] what I meant to say is they all had the [very] real tight trousers [in]
those days - When they'd get into their trousers why they'd fit 'em like
a sausage. [*[*]Of course, Burtenards and Wagner's were their tailors and
they knowed  just how they wanted their clothes and they'd fit 'em that
way.[*]*] I'm telling you it was a very very seldom that you could button [up a
person's trousers] the top button of a person's trousers - They had
to leave the trouser's top button [og the trousers] open and they had a suspenders,
and, of course, they really didn't need any suspenders [*[*]because they was
so tight fitting and[*]*] but it was one of the fads, that [that they would take one
suspender down as] they would take [let] one of the suspenders hang down as they
(would) [take a walk that they had adopted] would walk along with a walk that
they had adopted from the river which they called shooting [the] duh agate. [Well]
Well, Nert would come walking along shooting the agate and leave his shirt open [ope]
in the summer time so you could discern his red flannel undershirt. That 
was considered a [real] big thing with some of the [women] real illiterate
women - If you could shoot a good agate and had a nice high class undershirt
and [a] flannel shirt with the collar turned up, boy, I'm telling you [you] were liable
to be able to get next to that broad. She liked that very much
     ? How did they walk when they shot the agate. [We]
     M. Well of course, by not being able to walk, I can't explain it to you
But I tell yuh [this about the agate] it was a kind of a very mosey walk, wid holding [you held] two fingers down,
of [with] one finger on each hand, [*(*]the front finger next to the-- in other
words, the index finger -[*)*]
