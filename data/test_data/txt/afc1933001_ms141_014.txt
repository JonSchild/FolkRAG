Dear Doctor Umble:
     
I should like to know why Mr. Bontrager and
his friend refuse to make more recordings. If
this is due to any mistake made by my wife and
myself in dealing with these elegant old Amish
gentlemen, I should like to know in detail what
mistake or mistakes were made, so that I shall
not repeat them in the future.

I am delighted to hear that you found the 
duplicate record useful and if there is any way
in the future that the Archive can assist you in
your studies of Amish music, please let me know.
It might be possible that we could lend you a
simple recording device with blanks if you ever
had occasion to make a series of recordings of
the music of this interesting Protestant sect.
If you are interested in knowing the policy of
the Archive regarding the loan of recording
machine and materials, I suggest that you read
Doctor Harold Spivacke's article on the Archive
in the March 1938 issue of the Southern Folklore 
Quarterly.

Very sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge,
