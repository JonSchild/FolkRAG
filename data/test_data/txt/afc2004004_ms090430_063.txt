The State spends more for fertilizer per acre of crop produced than any other
in the South. [*]End.*]

Johnston County is one of the oldest counties in the state. Its development
before the Civil War was slow. In 1850 there was a population of
little more than 13,000 people, of whom about one-third were Negroes. The
plantation economy was not developed and there were few slaves in the area.
In 1860 less than one-fourth of the land area of the county was in cultivation.
The growth of population, the development of agriculture and the commercial
importance of the county have all occurred since the Civil War -- in fact since
1880.

In 1900 the County ranked as the third cotton producing county in
the state, with a crop of 20,466 bales. From 36 acres of tobacco in 1880 the
among of land devoted to this crop had increased to 3,985 acres, and a production
of 2,651,760 pounds, in 1900. The county ranked 19th among the cotton
producing counties of the state. There were 4,452 farms in the county in
1900 with a total area in farms of 371,000 acres. In 1930 there was a tobacco 
crop of 20,453,561 pounds, but by this time the reverses had resulted in
the loss of many farms.

Revival has again been under way as the New Deal programs have
entered the county. The controlled production and prices have been of
valuable assistance, and money has begun circulating again. Loans to farmers
removed the imminence of loss which many farmers faced. In the years
1934 and 1935 the extent of readjustment was reflected in land sales. Banks
and insurance companies began unloading the land which they had accumulated.
