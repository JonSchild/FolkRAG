TURN THE PAN
This tape is incomplete, but the game of Turn the
Pan is probably similar to Spin the Bottle, except
that it is played with a tin plate spun on the
floor, in the midst of a ring of children. The
one who is "it" must give a pawn, that is be
chosen to recite a poem, sing a song, act like
a chicken, jump like a frog, etc.
