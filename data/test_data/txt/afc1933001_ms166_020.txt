1/ Lord Lovell, he stood at his castle gate
A combin' his milk white steed.
When came out Lady Nancy Bell
A' wishin her lover God speed,
speed, speed.
A' wishin her lover God speed.

"Oh! where are you going, Lord Lovell", she cried.
"Oh! where are you going" cried she.
"I'm going, my Lady Nancy Bell,
Strange countries for to see, see, see.
Strange countries for to see."

"When will you be back, Lord Lovell", she cried
"When will you be back," cried she.
"In a year or two or three at most,
I'll return to my Lady Nance, cee, cee.
I'll return to my Lady Nancee".

He had not be gone but a year and a day,
Strange countries for to see.
When languishing thoughts came into his head
Lady Nancy Bell he would go see, see, see.
Lady Nancy Bell he would go see.
