[*(WAGES - PICKERS)*]
TL:    How much did you get per hamper for beans? How much did
you get paid?
BJ:    We-- I tol' you at first that sometime we get to -- at that
time -- they get 50 an' 60 cents.   Until the second pickin'.  Then
they go to 75 an' 80.
TL:    Oh, on the second picking you get more, huh?
BJ:    Yeah.  Oh yeah, 'cause....

[*(WAGES - GRADERS)*]
TL:    How much do the bean graders get?
BJ:    Oh, they gets--I don' know, but, but they gets more than we
do.  Ya see, 'cause they gets paid by the hour. [By the hour]
TL:    By the hour?
BJ:    Um-hum.  Yeah.
TL:    I thought [th] you said they got paid. . . 
BJ:    The bean --the green (sic) graders. You see, they not pickin';
they gradin'.
TL:    Oh, I thought you said they got paid by the hamper anyway.
BJ:    We do, in the field.   [Why] But they get paid by the hamper and
by the hour.  Ya see what I mean? And when . . .
TL:    They get paid by the hour, too?
BJ:    Tha's right, yessir.  You see, 'cause, ya see, they got ta
grade them beans, an' den they get so much extra on the hamper.
So that's [why] reason I said they gets paid by the hamper.  Ya see?  They,
sometimes make, make high as, ah, ah, 20 and 30 dollars a day,
accordin' to how much they grade.   An' one person try to beat the
other'n an' git as, as many hampers as he can get an' he git his,
ah, git his, ah, ah, extra on [them] his hampers, ya see?  An', an' I
have known them to get as high as 30 cent extras on, on, on the
hampers.
TL:    Well, this was even when jobs [ere] were hard to get?
