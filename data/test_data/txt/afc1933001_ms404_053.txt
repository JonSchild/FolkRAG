I must have been translated. My
consciousness fully came back
to me when the mail was
delivered [to me] the next morning.
My letter was in a [big] long, important
looking Macmillan [letter] envelope containing
a contract for the book. Also
it held a check for two hundred and
fifty dollars. And that's the
how of American Ballads and
Folk Songs, and the moment
[where] at which I turned the corner to
where a little light was shining.
