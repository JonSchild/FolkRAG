Dear Mrs. Hunter:

    The Archive of American Folk Song is sending 
me to Indiana in April to make recordings of Indiana 
Folk-Songs. I have studied your Brown County
Collection, and I should like your permission to revisit 
your informants and make records of the ballad
and folk-song versions you collected from them. If
your experience has been like mine, you must have been
forced to leave many possible informants unvisited and
still others whose stock of songs you felt you have not
exhausted.

    I should greatly appreciate any suggestions
you would care to make in regard to work in Brown County, 
or in Indiana in general.

    As you undoubtedly know, the Library of Congress 
has set up the Archive for the purpose of helping 
students in the field, and I am sure that we will
be able to cooperate to the fullest extent.

    Sincerely yours,

    Alan Lomax
