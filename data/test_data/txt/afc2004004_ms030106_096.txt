I'm the windin' boy, don't deny my name,
I'm the windin' boy, don't deny my name,
Windin' boy, don't deny my name,
Pick it up and shake it like Stavin' Chain,
I'm the windin' boy, don't deny my name.

Windin' boy, don't deny my name,
I'm the windin' boy, don't deny my name,
I'm the windin' boy, win to fame,
I shook that thing like it's game,
Windin' boy, don't deny my name.

I seen that gal, she was sitting on a stump,
I seen that gal, she was sitting on a stump,
I seen a gal sitting on a stump,
I screw her 'till her pussy stunk,
I'm the windin' boy, don't deny my name.

I met that gal, met her on the grass, 
I met that gal, met her on the grass, 
I met that gal, met her on the grass, 
Took that snake right from her big ass,
Lawd, I'm the windin' boy, and don't deny my name.

Dime's worth of beefsteak and a nickle's worth of lard,
Get a dime's worth of beef steak and a nickle's worth of lard,
Yes,  a dime's worth of beefsteak and a nickle's worth of lard,
I'll salivate your pussy 'till my peter gets hard,
I'm the windin' boy, don't deny my name.

Every time the changing, changing of the dog-gone moon,
(ba-ba-la ba-boo)
Every time the changing of that dog-gone moon, 
Every time the changing of that  moon, 
The blood comes rushing from the bitch's womb,
I'm the windin' boy, yes, I don't deny my name.
