Dear Mr. Lomax:

In looking over some letters the other day, I came across a
letter from you written last spring just before I left for the
University of Minnesota to spend the summer. I recall now that
I intended to write you a note telling you why I could not
help with the recording of further hymns at that time, but the
matter completely slipped my mind. I hope that it will be
possible for us to get together to do some further recording
sometime during this year.

Professor Stith Thompson, president of the American Folklore
Society, has asked me to write a brief paper on the Amish and
their hymns. This paper is to be read in the annual meeting
at New York during the coming holiday season. Would it be
possible for you to bring some of the records to the meeting
and play them for the National Society in connection with the
reading of my paper or at some other time? I have been given a
certain allotment of time on the program and would be more than
willing to yield a part of that time for the playing of one or
more records. I think probably that will be more valuable than
anything that I should have to say about the hymns or about the
Amish themselves.

Naturally, since the time between now and the last week in December is growing short, I would very much appreciate an
early reply so that I can arrange my paper accordingly.

Very sincerely yours,

John Umble
