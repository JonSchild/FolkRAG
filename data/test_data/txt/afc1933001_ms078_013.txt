Dear Professor Davidson:

    Thank you for your kind letter of January 10. I see no
reason why I should not come up from Texas and be with you during
your regional folk-lore conference. At least, for the two days for
which you particularly wish me, I will come. I must add, however,
that had you stipulated that I had to make a formal address, I should
not have accepted thenoffer. I really expect to enjoy your informal
conference and will, of course, be glad to talk as you suggest. I
expect to be here for another month, after which, you can reach me
at 7456 San Benito Way, Dallas, Texas.

    Sincerely yours,
    John A. Lomax
    Honorary Curator of Folk Song
    Library of Congress
