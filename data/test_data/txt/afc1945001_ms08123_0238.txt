A nave flyer was forced down on one of
the small islands in the South Seas while
returning to his base.  While he was on the
island he put his pearashout on the beach
so the patrol flyers mite see it and drop
supplys.  He sheared his supplys with the
chief of the island.  When the flyer was
picked by a patral boat, he left his parashout
with the chief.  For a time afterwards the
chief put it on the beach and got supplys
from the patral plane, untill they got 
wise to the chief.
