What does it take to be a man?

Len Chandler knows 
it takes more than the 
"half a chance" everyone's 
so generous with. 
"If you give a guy just 
half a chance," says Len
"he might become just half 
a man." "To Be a Man" is 
just one of twelve original 
compositions in this, Len 
Chandler's new Columbia 
album. It is a powerful song 
-a song with a vital message. 
You grasp its strength because 
Len has an uncanny 
way of projecting each song 
so that you really feel it. 
You're joggled by the rumblin' 
and grumblin' of the 
"Takin' Me Away From You 
Train," a song of farewell-
for-awhile. You 
are stirred by the 
indignation of the "Time 
of the Tiger," a fervent 
rallying-call for social protest
...and reform. You melt as you listen 
to "Nancy Rose." (The tender words 
were meant for Len's wife, but will be 
understood by any man who loves his 
woman deeply.) You chuckle—a bit 
guiltily, perhaps—at the pungent lyric 
of "Hide Your Heart, Little Hippie," 
a lightsome spoof on conformity. 
And 
when you hear the outrageously 
satirical "Missionary 
Stew #2," you'll want a second 
helping. This is Len's recording 
debut. What a coming out!
