[*RACIAL EQUALITY*]
BJ:      (Cont.) A man was talkin' at one end of the bus station the
[other] yesterday; he had a time.  He had to stomp his foot to get the
man to understand him!  Yeah, he was goin' with it!
     But, as I started to say, ah, they, they ah ah, they, the colored
peoples and the, and the nationality of peoples -- I ain' talkin' 
about the na -- about the nation of peoples -- all the country,
to my idea an' my belief, everywhere in the world, I b'lieve we
should realize that peoples is jus' peoples.  An' you human, an'
you got to die.  You're born, like I told a white lady here not
over long ago, says, "We ought to realize an' know that God don't
think no more of you than he do of me."  Now, that what we oughta
see. "If God loveded you," I, I, was talkin' to the white lady then, 
"If He loveded you more than He did me, He wouldn't let you have
to even birth a baby.  He'd a-let your children jus' come on up
to ya, before ya.   You got to git it like I git it; you got to go
through what I go through; you got to shed blood; you got to die."
You know what I mean, "For that chile."  Tha's right, "You got
to stink jus' like anybody else."  Ya see what I mean?  Tha's,
tha's, tha's true.  Everything is right. But if God thought any
more or any diffrunt in it, why, He would make it diffrunt.  Ya 
see, He said, "I have no respect for person."  Ya see? An' then what
He...an' you cain't get a baby in,in this worl', to be born
without a man, that is a bone. You know.
     Now, you can get a baby without a man, far [as] I know, but
it won't be no bones in it. Ya see.  Because a man is a man,
An' a man is, is bone of the baby.  Ya see? An' tha's why, an'
the baby's should look up (?) to the man.
