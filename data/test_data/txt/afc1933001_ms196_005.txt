THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
MEMORANDUM

Date: April 20, 1948

To: Dr. Spivacke
From: Duncan Emrich, Chief, Folklore Section
With reference to: ATTACHED LETTER

[*RECEIVED
APR 22 1948
LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE*]

The attached letter from Mr. Lomax at Decca Records requests
shipment of seven records (checked in telephone conversation) to
Jascha Heifeitz to be used by him as source material for the arrangement
of music for the violin.  The commercial aspects are apparent.

All of the records have been issued in our album releases,
but the specific use to which the material is to be put indicates a
need for clearance within the library.

This request is similar to others which we have received, notably
from teachers and students in schools of music, to which our answer has
been noncommittal.  This particular request points up, however, our need
for a policy in the matter and decision on it might well be incorporated
in the Librarian's administrative memorandum to us which is still under
consideration.

For myself, I should like to recommend that our folk song resources
be made freely available for purposes of this sort and that the records
desired by Jascha Heifeitz be forwarded to him.

The titles are:

Pretty Polly (Friends of Music Album)
Roll on the Ground . . . . . . . . . . Record No. 8
Five-String Banjo Tunes  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10
Harmonica Solos    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19
The Golden Willow Tree   . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  31
The Two Sisters   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  33
Holy Babe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   49
