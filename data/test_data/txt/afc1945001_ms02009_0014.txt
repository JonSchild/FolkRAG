ADVISORY SERVICES FOR PROJECTS
Owing to the complexity of the tasks confronting a rumor control 
project, it is important to have a balanced central Advisory Board.
This Board should include responsible community officials; security officers; representatives of civic and service clubs; women's organizations,
labor and farm groups, consumer groups, and all minority groups in the 
community; technical experts such as persons from the psychology or sociology department of local colleges or universities; newspaper and radio
representation.

Though the emphasis in the organization of rumor control projects 
is on their responsibilities as information centers, rumor analysis
may point to an undesirable condition about which something can be done.
Where improving such conditions would eliminate rumors which tend to
interfere with the war effort, the project must consider improving such
conditions part of its business. It should, therefore, have an its Advisory 
Board professional social service workers alert to the possibilities
for community action.

With respect to informational programs, the local project is in 
the best position to fill the community need. For blanketing the non-local 
rumors, the Officer of War Information is prepared to cooperate and
finish material on the basis of analyses sent to the Office.
