Sally Doncha Grieve
[The Biggest Thing]

4/4  I just got my ar - my call, 
I run down to the ar - my hall,
Sal - ly came a run - ning like a can - non ball, And l
told her not to grieve af - ter me. 
Chorus
It's when I'm gone, Sally don't you grieve, It's 
when I'm gone, Sally don't you grieve, It's 
when I'm gone, Sally don't you grieve, And I
told her not to grieve aft - er me.
