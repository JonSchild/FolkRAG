[*/*] as I said the mountains, there are 70,000
square miles of beautiful tangled green
hills allowed this British tradition this time + space
to re-shape itself.  While it was being cut
to pieces by the industrialisation of Great
Britain, it was finding a new home here, 
reforming itself, taking on a new life on
the frontier, of life out of the corn
fields and out of whiskey stills and out of 
the feuds and out of the loneliness of 
living and the difficulties of living in a 
new land.[*\*] [*06.13.02.01*]   Most people don't understand 
Americans because they don't know how
frightening it as been to leave home
completely and pull up your roots and face
the wilderness, because the wilderness was
exhiliarating and terrifying, especially
difficult for the women of course but the 
mountains provided a little bit of space
time for a new culture to grow [*\*] and the
results are I think splended things that
have made life much better in this country
and I think are going to be a factor in the
future culture of the world.

For instance the Australian aborigines I 
understand favourite music is country
music.  In the war, World War II when we
were reaching out to broadcast to China
back of Chang Kai Check's battle lines, we
used my Kentucky mountain fiddle records,
solo unaccompanied fiddle and the Chinese
loved those records, that was the one thing
we could find that they liked.  They didn't 
like jazz at all, they like that solo
unaccompanied fiddle.
