"What do you think about this Nazi saboteur trial?"
"Pretty bad.  We were talking about it down at the office.  If a 
few of those babies were able to get in here as easy as that crew 
did I bet the country is filled with 'em.  They have probably come 
in from Canada, South America and everywhere else.  It wouldn't 
surprise me if they would lay low for awhile until the heat's off 
and some of this publicity has quieted down; then in accordance 
with prearranged plans probably set off explosions on these defense 
jobs from one end of the country to another."
