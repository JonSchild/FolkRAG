bands defile to one side. Sometimes a
quarrel arises and the two groups fight.
But all the time the vaxines and the sans bas and
the singers raise their voices higher and higher,
the two rhythms and the two melodies gaining
rather than losing in strength from having
encountered one another.
The coronels are the most interesting military
officials I have ever seen. They crouch in
front of the bands, backing down the road
like so many crabs, scowls of urgent self-importance
on their faces, growling out
directions to the vaxiners. They point at the
ground imperiously and the vaxiners sew
the earth with their heavy seeds of sound.
Whether the intent is to use the earth as a vibrator
or not [I do not know], or whether the
phallic vaxiners are supposed to be sewing the
earth I don't know. What the vaxiners
do however is to crouch, dancing all the
while, until the mouths of the bamboos
are within a few inches of the earth.
And the dust rises up with each roar
