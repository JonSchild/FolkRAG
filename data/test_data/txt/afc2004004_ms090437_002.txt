GHOST STORY.
One Sunday me and my girl had a faling out and I laid down, I couldn't go
to sleep. I was thinking over affairs about fallng out with my girl and
I couldn't sleep. And I laid there, I reckon [until]  about 10:30.-- the old
[watch] [?] stopped -- and I heard looked like men what just jumped on
the counter and walk[ed] and stomped, throw down [jars] dishes + pans and things. I
just looked like to me as breaking show-cases all to piece and one th n g. Well,
I had raise up and looked. [And the room] But you know when it's light in the room where [he lives] you is, you can't
see in the dark; I never could see nothing, but I heard [it] tell and
I know the next morning, I went in there the things was just like I left em, didn't
been nobody in there but I heard something. (laughter)
A: Wel, why do you reckon there was a ghost in there? Was anybody 
killed in the store?
S: I reckon so. If it was anything like a ghost, I reckon it was the
old[nly] time the people [what] used to live there come back. If they are
any such thing as a ghost, That's what it was, I guess.
A: But your father [did] told you not to believe that?
S: Yes, and when he come back and I told him, he just laughed. It
tickled him. He say, " Goddamn, I told you," he say, " I don't believe
in anything like that but, dmn, all you got to do is lay
awake one night and you'll [sure] sho hear it."
