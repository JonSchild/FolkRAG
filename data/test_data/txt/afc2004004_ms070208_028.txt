I had to shoot a woman one Sunday - she
was pullin' another woman's hair & hittin' her
side of the head with a knife. I said "Quit
hittin' her?' "Yeah" I said I mean it , qut hittin' her." I'm gonna show
the world you ain't a damn thing but
talk" She come around the table at me with the knfe.
I touched the trigger & knocked her
a double somerset. She hollered when she fell.
She said, "Ladies & gentlemen, they'll sho 
shoot you." Went to Memphis & got
well & come back in a couple of months.
