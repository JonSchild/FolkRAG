Monday. Woke with a lake
of whiskey in my belly still
undigested.

At 11:30 the goddam Citroen
wouldn't start. Pushed it
with the help of a friendly
Englishman. At the garage
left it for Â£ 12 of work.

Would like to stay in England.
The idea of an Irish ballad
opera sends me.  Perhaps it
would be the gesture of independence
that I'm waiting for. Actually
when I behave as I did last
night it's because I have
a complete scorn for my own,
father-dominated work.

Met blond Hamish Henderson today; who
[be] is the nicest person I have met in
the British Isles. The Scots have
the fine combination of work & passion
