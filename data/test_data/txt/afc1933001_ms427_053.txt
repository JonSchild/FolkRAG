I wish I was in de land ob cotton
Old times dar am not forgotten,
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.
In Dixie Land whar I was born in,
Early on one frosty mornin'
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land,

CHORUS:  Den I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray! Hooray!
In Dixie Land, I'll take my stand
To lib and die in Dixie;
Away, Away, Away down in the south in Dixie.
Away, Away, Away down in the south in Dixie.

Dars buckwheat chakes an' Ingen batter,
Makes you fat or a little fatter,
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.
Den hoe it down an scratch your grabble,
To Dixie Land I'm bound to trabble, Look away!, Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.
