BJ TAPE 10, p. 5

AL:   Did you ever hear anything like:
Po' farmer, po' farmer, po' farmer,
They git all the farmer made;
His clo'es is full of patches
His head is full of holes,
Stoopin' down pickin' cotton
From off the bottom bolls.
BJ:   Hum-um.
AL:   Po' farmer, [p]...
Ever heard that one?
BJ:   Hum-um. It's cute though; I like it.
AL:   Po' farmer, po' farmer
They git all the farmer made.
Didn't they ever[y] sing any of these farmin' songs?  All that
farmin' you did, they musta had sone.
BJ:   Well, I guess they did.  But I can tell I didn' sing about that
"Po' Farmer," Po' -- I don' know that. "It's Hard to Be a Farmer."
[*RE "Diamond Joe"*]
But ah, this um, ah, song about [Dinah an] Diamond Joe, that's,
that's the patches, ya know.  You know. Did ya?
I heard that'n long time ago.  You know that'n, "Diamond Joe?"
AL:   I just heard a little piece of it one time.
BJ:   Um-hum.  I'd like you to git -- to pick your box to that
some time some night an' learn it.  Ah, it's old. Le's see, how
it -- I forgit. Le's see, I used to sing it, too. Let's see:
