December 28 1933

My dear Dr. Kepeel:

Dr. Holland has shown me your note to him dated the 21st but
received only yesterday, and also handed to me the one addressed to me:
both reporting the resolution adopted by your Executive Committee on
December 19, as follows:
RESOLVED, That, from the balance available for appropriation, the
sum of five thousand five hundred dollars ($5,500) be, and it
hereby is, appropriated to the Library of Congress toward support
of its program in the fine arts, previously aided under Resolution
X 965.
Your note additionally makes clear that of the above grant "the
Committee intended $2,500 to be used for the photographs of early Virginia
architecture, and $3,000 for the purposes of meeting the expenses
of the campaign of Mr. Lomax and his son in the South during the coming
year": that campaign being for the acquisition of further material to
be added to the Archive of American Folk Song, under development in the
Music Division of the Library.

I need not assure you that both these grants are highly welcome
and very cordially appreciated.

Very sincerely yours,

Librarian
