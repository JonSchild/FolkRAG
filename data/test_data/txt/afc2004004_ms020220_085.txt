white lady that owned the plantation, she said, you know, to
bring 'em in town an' she'd buy all the huckleberries they'd 
bring.
     An' so, this big baptizin's gonna be there Sunday an' Mama
wanted to git me a lil' dress, so she went out to pick huckleberries. 
An' Mama, as a former say (formerly said), she didn't
know nothin 'bout no rattlesnakes, ya see? An' ah, as she came
back up, [upper] other country there, back in Smithville side there,
where I was born, an' she had never seed one, but she had heard
talk of 'em. An' ah, all this time, she yet hadn't seed one.
'Cause they believe if they kill one, they wouldn't -- But they's 
dangerous-lookin' things; they                            .
     An' so, we was in this woods pickin' huckleberries. Right

up], you know, in in, front of me there, see? An' ah, so this thing
got so, kept on kickin' up so much a noise, Mama say, "I hear
some kinda big bug." I'll never forgit it. 
     An' this bug got too loud for Mama. Guess that was jus'
the will of God, ya know, My time hadn't come, that was all. See, he 
was settin' fer me; he was settin' for my haid, ya see? An' my
head didn' move, ya see; I was jus' pickin' the berries. An'
when he set for sumpin', it that thing move, he gonna strike
