A Lonesome Soldier 

There was a young negro Soldier over 
in Palestine in the Y.M.C.A., 
sitting there looking very dejected and 
downhearted.  
A hostess came up and said to him, 
"Why don't you write to somebody?"  
He replied, "But I can't write."  
She said, "Well I'll write it for you 
if you want me to."  
"Allright", he said, "but I don't know 
what to write about."  
"Here you are in the land where 
Christ was born," she said.  
"You should be proud."  
The soldier began his letter, 
"Dear Mom, ... Here I am in 
the land where Christ was 
born, and I wish to Christ 
that I was in the land where 
I was born."
