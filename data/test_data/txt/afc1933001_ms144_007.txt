Mr. Alan Lomax

New York City

Dear Alan:

The postscript in your last letter pleased me no end! Keep up the good work!

I did not expect that the acquisition of he commercial recordings of folk-music would be a simple matter. But even if certain records are not immediately available, your bibliographies will not be wasted at all. They will serve as necessary want lists at the proper time.

Whatever you do, refrain from dumping quantities of records on the Library at the present time. Our present staff cannot cope with it at all - cannot even check the shipments for acknowledgement! We are just now finishing the count of the initial shipment from Columbia. We shall of course welcome gifts from Musicraft, Gamut, etc., and a systematic acquisition of folk-material. But no dumping - please!

If you see anything at Bloomfields which you think we should have, list them properly and I shall recommend purchase immediately. 

You did not enclose father's letter regarding Gamut but I had already arranged a satisfactory formula with Mr. Wolfert. I have wired father asking his opinion but I shall in the meantime get the Librarian to approve it. 

Sincerely yours,
Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
