Mr. William H. Webber, #2


     We wish to offer this suggestion for your very
careful consideration. Why would it not be feasible 
and practical to utilize some person or persons in your 
OWI field offices to supervise this work of public opinion
surveying? If public opinion surveys are to continue 
to be a vital part of the work of the OWI, then
it would seem to us, from our experience here, that volunteer
helpers will be independable, unskilled and
likely to fall down at the very time when you most need
their help.

     Why not designate somebody in these field offices
and utilize his services a part of the time for this 
work, some trained newspaper man who knows how to get
the job done.

     Perhaps this sounds like the self-centered suggestion 
of an old Inquiries Bureau man trying to save
something that he has helped to build up. Perhaps sub-
consciously there is some of this involved in what I 
say. But I still maintain that the hit and miss system
of enlisting volunteers to do this service for the Government
and to make it effective, will prove very disappointing.

     Listed below are the names, addresses and comments 
of the persons who cooperated in Kansas City on the rumor 
collection:

     1. Dr. Leon N. Brams, dentist, Professional Building,
Kansas City, Missouri -- Dr. Brams said the work
was interesting and that it would not be too burdensome
if he were not called upon too often. He said that he 
would try to do it when needed, if his practice would permit.

     2. Jesse S. Williams, chairman of the Kansas City 
Industrial Union Council (CIO), Gashland, Missouri, a suburb
of Kansas. He also can be reached by mail at CIO
headquarters, Rial to Building, Kansas City, Missouri -- 
he is employed as a mechanic at the Butler Manufacturing
Company, which has war production contracts. he found
the work interesting, but said he was uncertain at times
just what constituted a useable rumor. He said he could
make similar surveys if they did not come more often than
