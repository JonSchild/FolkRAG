MEMORANDUM

TO THE CHIEF OF THE
FROM
Music Division

Mail
May 22, 1939

Attached is a notice from the Railway Express Agency and a letter from Mr. Lomax
in regard to a shipment from Mr. John A. Lomax of phonograph records belonging to the
Library of Congress. The "C.O.D. Charges" of $500.00 are obviously the result of a
misunderstanding for this sum represents the valuation. I suggest that the express
company may be informed of their error so that storage charges will not be charged while
the matter is being adjudicated.

I have already written to Mr. Lomax about this, and his answer is attached.
Harold Spivacke
