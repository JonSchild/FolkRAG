Dear ALAN,
Caedmon have written asking for 5 more records in the series
which is all very exciting. They have sent cheque for 250 dollars to start
work. We still have no sight of the disks over here but we have seen the
excellent reviews which they have been getting in.
Before starting work on these next 5 the EFDS Society needs to know
the position with regard to royalty and copyright as my employers they
will obviously expect a share.
(1) As yet I have received no Royalty statements from Caedmon or
from you, though I imagine it is too early to expect the advance to be
paid off. I would like it clarified with yourself and then Caedmon
that I shall receive half royalty. It would be best for them to send
statements to both of us.
(2) I see by the booklets which my father brought back from the States
that there is a copyright notice beside each tune marked Lochrae Music.
I have written to Caedmon about this and they have replied that this is
your affair. Could you tell me the story behind all this so that there is
no misunderstanding over our mutual agreement (I don't envisage any
difficulty as we generally see eye to eye). I expect you were just too
busy to sort out more than getting it copyrighted for safety sake. But
now we are getting enquiries about this from EFD, BBC and the artists
themselves. Before we can start approaching artists again we must sort
this one out.
In our contracts with the artists we stated that we would arrange for
music publishers to send artists songwriters contracts for signature and
that they would then be paid direct (you wrote this in yourself). Are you
suggesting that Lochrae Music should do this for the States and that I
should find someone over here to do it for United Kingdom and Europe?
