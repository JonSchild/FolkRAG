the woman was boss & 2 houses
where the man was boss.  Came
home with both horses & no dogs.
Now for Chavella & what will 
become of us.  God knows.  I'm lost.
Why?  Is everyone lost?  Is everyone
gnawed by the shame of being alive
or do I see only the reflection
of my own shame & boredom in their
guilty seeing eyes?
