FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

Tune-On Wisconsin

Farmer's Union, Farmer's Union,
Hear the call to arms, 
Step into the ranks for justice,
For the man who farms.
Hear the bugle! Hear the Bugle!
Rise with all your might.
Fight Farmer-Union Soldier,
Fight! Fight! Fight!

Farmer's Union, Farmer's Union,
Raise your battle cry.
Break that line of opposition,
Every foe defy.
Stop that gambler, speculator,
Old line parasite.
Fight Farmer-Union Soldier,
Fight! Fight! Fight!

Farmer's Union, Farmer's Union,
Drive ahead with speed,
Dogs will growl and humans bark,
To try your way impede.
Turn your light on, keep the bright on
Give her gas on high.
Fight Farmer-Union Soldier,
N'er say die.

Farmer's Union, Farmer's Union,
U.S. is awake,
Drive ahead co-operation
Make the old-line shake.
Cling together! Cling together!
Break the old-line gang.
Fire Farmer-Union Soldier,
Bang! Bang! Bang!

A GREETING
What's the matter with------------,
He's all right.
What's the matter with------------,
Out of sight.
He has a smile and he brings good cheer,
And we are happy when he is near.
What's the matter with------------,
He's all right.
