BJ:  I heard a boy say, ah, ah -- Boy; he's a man, said once,
said, "He take ya gitar, an' he play it for ya."
AL:  The devil?
BJ:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Play it for ya.  An' teach you how to play,
you, you know, uh, and ah, den do sumpin' or other to ya.  I

anything ya wanna play!
AL:  Somebody told me onetime that the devil clipped your finger
nails for ya once and from then on you had that devilish movement
in your fingernails.
BJ:  Ummmn!
AL:  He'd take a knife and pare your fingernails.
BJ:  Um-hum.

hear folks say that every. . .
AL:  When that man says on the record that he's the devil's
son-in-law, that's what he really means, doesn't he?
BJ:  What?
AL:  You, know, there's a guy on a record that. . .
BJ:  I know.  I heard it.  He -- You know where he at now?  He's in Connecticut.

AL:  Peter Wheatstraw.
