TAPE:  
Roll 15   p. 5

(Man) and your a Baptist -- that don't make a bit of difference.
We just simply explain the plan of salvation -- if Christ died
that you and I might be saved, and can be saved.   So that is
our main mission, our Holy Mission to show others -- that there
is a better life waiting out there -- in this life let alone
the beyond.

AL:   The churches, do they take up collections for you?

Man:   We never ask for a dime.

AL:   Your not paid for the. . . ?

Man:   Yes, we're paid--thru our records and our tapes, we sell
them; and then we never ask when we are invited to a church.
And when we make an appointment at that church, we never say
that it takes this amount of money for us to go to your church
for a program.   The Lord will provide our beings. . .And they
take up a free will offering, if they want to give us a quarter,
fine, a dollar, great, but -- five would be better, wouldn't
it!  (laughs)

AL:   Now we said before we came over that we were gonna let
Cai (?) do all the talking. . . .but you all are Church of God, huh?
That's you background. . .

Linda:  Yeah, that's our background.

AL:   I remember those songs as being -- there were lots of very
lively clapping songs, you know, where you played the tambourine,
and shouted in the song.   Do you know any songs like that?
