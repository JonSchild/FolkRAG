Dear Mr. Spivacke:  I enclose
you herewith the first letter I 
received from Miss Mae Gowan,
President Department of Art Education
National Educational Association. In 
considering the acceptance of 
this invitation it occurs to me
that Alan should be [??] to
run the machine and illustrate 
the music, after I have talked 
briefly.  I want you to consider
some such plan anyhow, 
We ought to make this occasion
something of real 
moment for the Folk Song Archive.
