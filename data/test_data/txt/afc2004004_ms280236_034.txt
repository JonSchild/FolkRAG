wasn't prepared to pay anything, So they said, "Alright,".
Well, in any case, he hadn't got any money on him. So
they said, "Alright. We'll get in touch with your
relatives." So then they got him to write to relatives
to say that they would pay a certain amount of money
for him to get ashore. Well, as it happened, there
was a chap down there, lives there now, thought there
was something queer aboard, you know, and it was his
business to see that there wasn't anything queer aboard.
So he rowed off, and he heard somebody
knocking regularly aboard the boat. So he took it in
his head to go aboard, and sure enough, there was his
Lordship Nuffield. He said, "What the hell are you
doing here?" He said, "Well, they locked me up." So
he got him ashore, and when the chaps came back with
the -- having got in touch with the relatives and waiting
for the money, -- it was somewhat late in the day, and
the bird had flown. . . . but he'd nearly had it.
Lomax: They were pretty tough hombres weren't they?
Robts: They were, yes.
Lomax: Are there still pretty tough guys down there, Bob?
Robts: I think so, in their way. Stubborn as hell, you know.
I like Suffolk people because there's something very
solid about them. If you want a chap to do something,
you can tell him, explain it to him, you can persuade
him, ask him, and he'll sit there and listen to you,
and he hasn't got a comment to make on it, in fact
He'll agree with everything you say. So you say, "Well,
right, let's start." He'll say, "Well, we'll see about
it tomorrow," . . . .meaning he isn't going to do it.
I mean you can waste your bloody breath, and you can do
what you like, you'll never drive a Suffolk man to do
a job; and they say the Suffolk horse is the same as the
Suffolk man. You can lead 'em, but you can't drive 'em,
never. I always think the men are something like the 
horses -- the horses are some of the strongest in
England, you know. They're a special breed. Have you
ever seen a Suffolk punch? I don't know what his
poundage is, but he's a particularly fins looking animal.
But if you whip a Suffolk punch and try and drive him in
the shafts or in the plough, you won't get him to do
anything at all. They just stop. You might as well save
your breath. The men are just the same. They used to make
very good soldiers in the old days, in the days of
Infantry fighting. Because those types of people, the --
in the days when they used to fight in squares, I mean,
they were just stickers. Not brilliant, not like the
