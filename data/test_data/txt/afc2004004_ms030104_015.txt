Even the men don' have-you don' have to look bad any more.
Let our hair grow out an' they'll slick ours back.
Farin' sumptuously.
Aooooh, God is tired of it.
Jes like he was tired of Dives.
An' there's somebody always in your way when you farin' so sumptuously,
That God wants you to pay some attention to.
While you're getting along so well
There's somebody at your do'. [You]
You know you get us to talkin about doin mission work
An' we'll work our heads off an' do foreign mission work,
But community missions an' home missions...
Somebody here tonite got a husban' who's a sinner in the house,
Oh, Glory,
An' you better not say anything to him.
Somebody here tonite has a son in the house
Who's a sinner an' you better not say anything to him.
Somebody here has a daughter tonite
In the house an' she better not say anthing to her[e].
But they talk about doin' mission work.
God Bless Your Soul.
You wanna do some mission work, go on back home.
Get down on your knees.
Tell God about what's goin' on at home.
While you farin' so sumptuously there's somebody right aroun'
You know it jus' makes me sick, you know
See big folks ridin' aroun' in their long automobiles
An' there's a woman that lives right next door,
She has to get up every mornin’ an' get her little knapsack
An' then [t]here she go in the rain, sleet an' snow
Down to the surplus commodity house
An' have to get down there an' stan in line for 2[-3] and 3 hrs.
Shivering in the cold and rain
An' get sack up an' put [in] it on her back,
An’ here she go wobblin' on back home
