Mr. Alan Lomax,
Music Division Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Alan;-
     The arrangement you mention will be entirely satisfactory.
Mean while I will accept a small W.P.A. job which has recently been
offered me.

     If weather continues good we might record easily until
Christmas. If rains set in early however there are several good 
neighborhoods of congregational singing that we could not make.

     If date had to be decided on immediately, it might be safer
to say spring.

     Please let me thank you for the interest you have taken
in this work for me.

     Best wishes for you and Elizabeth.

                                      Sincerely,

                                              {{signed: Ruby P. Tart}}
