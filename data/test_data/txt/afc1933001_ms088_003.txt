Thank you, Jerry, for coming
to our rescue with your suggestions.
I have found one
ex-Presto engineer here who
I think will undo the kinks
which the bumps of travel
seem always to put into those
small machines. Don't you
and Alan worry. Miss Terrill
and I will do our very
best and get from this machine
all that is in it. Also
we promise not to add
greatly to your burdens
