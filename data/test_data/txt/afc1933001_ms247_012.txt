good trail days stories. Our greatest
error, I think, is that we did not 
record [make] more talk from our 
performers.

For your private information
strictly I tell you that I have 
just signed and returned to 
the music division the fourth 
set of expense blanks for money
I paid out on my last trip 
for the Library, completed November 
20, [1939] 1940, a year and two months 
ago! I made out the expense 
account immediately after Mar. 20, under the 
explicit directions of the accounting department.
I made two substitutions before 
I left Washington in response 
to orders. No item has ever 
been questioned, though I believe 
I am to get back only a 
portion of what I paid out.
