Dear Mr. Lomax,
It appears that I am always away from Tucson
when your letters arrive.  I am again truly sorry,
but as I explained to you in my last letter the
tape copy would be sent to you as soon as our
engineer had some available time.
The six tape masters we have were recorded in
two track stereo at 15 ips.  The enclosed copy is
monaural at 71/2 ips.  The copy features various 
selections taken from the masters.  There are
approximately 19 selections but some have noise
factors which were a result of the the artists
hitting the microphones in some instances.  In
all, we feel the recordings are very good.
[*!*] If you wish to purchase the masters let me know
and I will send you a price.
Yours truly,
Phil Dering
Business Manager

[*Alan - He never explained why the 
           recordings were made,
           though we asked him.*]
