Vera Hall,  reel  8,  page 12 . . .

V:  He works on the railroad.  He makes pretty good money.
He's been on the railroad, I reckon about twenty five
years I believe.  He's been working on the  railroad long time,
He makes good money now.  They pay  good on the railroad now.
So he got him a ni-ice car , Lincoln.  And got a motorbike, too.
But he can't be no preacher, cause he been livin this
kinda life all those years.  But he smart.  He  got him a heap
of sense.  He's a mechanic.  He can fix cars and things like that.
And he can get holt of a right smart of money and he just
gets out and run around.  But I don't think that's right.  That'S 
the reason nobody down there don't believe in him, bein nom 
preacher . And beat his wife like that and she ain't doin anything
but just stayin there where he leave her.  Betcha I wouldn't stay
there (LIGHT LAUGH)  not if he gon come back there and beat me.
(MORE LAUGHTER IN WHICH E JOINS)  I wouldn't, I wouldn't be there. 
I always say that I never would quit my husband, which I 
didn't , but"I ain't gon stay there now and let you come home
and beat me.  No sir!  I might be there one time when you come
back , but I won't be there the next time. " 
But she is.  She's a good woman.  She stays there.  She
just looks bad and down hearted all the time.  Don't have any
nice cl othes to wear to chruch, much money as he makes.  I
think they ought to do sumpin to him, though, makin all that money
and don't buy his wife [any] no better lookin clothes than that! 
Just throwin it away , I reckon.  (INFINITELY WISTFUL) 
E:  Just throws it away. 
V:  Yesmam.  Just throws it away.  He don't drink, I don't
