CHORUS:

We are the true born sons of Levi,
We are the true born sons of God,
We are the root and branch of David,
We are the bright and morning star.

When Moses planted Aaron's rod,
That very night that rod did bud,
When Moses smote the Egyptian water,
That very night it turned to blood.  Chorus.

We wore the robes of spotless garments,
And on our breast the blazing star,
And in our hand we bore the scepter,
O, will you come and join our band?   Chorus.

When Joshua and I passed over Jordan,
Lo, these twelve stars were lifted high ;
To the high priest and our grand master,
We bore the Ark of God alone.   Chorus.

It was in Gallatins the Ark did rest,
And his record before she was still,
The seven trumpets of ram's horns sounded.
They sounded so loud before the Ark.   Chorus.

MESSIAH'S KINGDOM

By reading the scriptures.
And sure that book is true,
It points to John, the Baptist,
His work it plainly shows.
And at the time appointed,
The messenger appeared,
Did preach Messiah's Kingdom,
At hand, as we have heard.

His mission was from heaven,
