[mother can't bring herself to forgive Frankie because she's killed Frankie has
killed her only son and a sole support Frankie the] In the [way]
[sensible] realistic way of ballad-makers, Lead Belly wastes no tears or
trouble on Albert after he's spoken his last words.  He realizes
that the ones to be pitied are the survivors of [a] the murder : Mrs.
Johnson who can't forgive or forget because Albert was her only
son and sole support, and Frankie, [who was a] cook in the white
folks' kitchen, [* who had killed the man she loved because he was ungratefully unfaithful.*]
There is one complete hiatus in the course of [this to] this.[remarkable]
[song] ballad, that is all the more interesting because it is so startling
-- the explanation that precedes the  thirteenth [[?]]stanza
where it is plain that Lead Belly [has] accepted, without  understanding,
[the] a traditional [a] rhyme[z] and [has explained] explained
this rhyme in the first way that occurred to him. It may be that he offered
this explanation for the first time before a white audience
in the North and, noticing their laughter and applause, left
[it as] the idea alone without thinking any further about it. [In
the same place]  [at that] In the same interval he emphasizes and reitterates
the friendly relations that existed between [Frankie [?]] his
Negro characters and the police[m].  This [same] emphasis occurs
again [incongruously] in "Ella Speed." [and] In both instances it represents  a carryover
from Lead Belly's conversation. He insists nearly always, when
he [mentiosn] mentions a white man , especially [a police[] an officer
of the law, that he, Lead Belly, is [well thought of by that]
that white man's dear friend.
