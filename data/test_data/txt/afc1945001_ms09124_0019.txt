Flying Tigers

A Japanese pilot cruising along is intent upon one thing, destruction; destruction of cities, hospitals, and destruction of lives. He hears a droning and is startled to see a winged shark like demon screaming at him, jaws open, intent upon his mark. A long line of tracers peaks down at the [[??]] and suddenly the sky seems to erupt with a charge of metal debris.
With grim satisfaction, the light of slowly dying in his eyes, a young member of the China division of the famous Flying Tigers looks on as the bomber falls into the sea. 
Yes, the Flying Tigers are doing a fine job in China; stopping raid after raid no matter what the odds. Fighting to the last round of ammunition, even to the last moment of life, fighting and dying, so that this world will be a better place to live in. Hats off to the Flying Tigers of China
