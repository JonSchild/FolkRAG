I heard a record called War TIme
Blues and it said. "This War will soon
be over if Uncle Sam would use his
plan let him sneak in Hilter Bedroom
with his razor in his hand."

The radio broadcast said, "that all of
use will probilly be killed in two years."

A group of girl's were talking and one
of the girl's said, she read in the paper
that the war would be over anytime
from 2 to 5 years."
