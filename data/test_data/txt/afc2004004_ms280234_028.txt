2) All on that Monday morning the boys said they'd be free,
All on that Monday morning it was made known to me,
They swore they'd go the distance as at Oxford Road they stopped,
Andbring the van right to a place where it was easy stopped.

3) It's true their only object was to smash the prison van,
When the prison van was opened, cheers were raised along the line,
Some escaped, but three were captured, Larkin and O'Brien,
On a cold November morning for the sake of our motherland.

4) Three brave men were executed in Donegal's land,
"God save Ireland," they cried proudly as they faced the gallows high.
"God save Ireland," they cried proudly, for our cause we are to die,"

5) Sixty summers have passed over since their blood for us was shed,
With love and devotion Ireland clasped them to her breast.
And if ever a truth by any man written be,
He can give the pride and privelige to the bold Manchestre Three

6) So they died for Ireland, but amongst their very own,
Far across the Irish Ocean, far across the raging sea,
In cold graves unconsecrated sleep the bold Manchester Three."
