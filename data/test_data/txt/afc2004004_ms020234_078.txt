there workin' an' won' even make a fire, if, if there be laid
one.  Won't even sweep a floor.  'Cause they don't figure __________.
Ya see?  An' if you git down sick, an' somebody say, "You
done work yourself down," an' all that, I say "See?"  Well, you,
you just worked down.  You got to watch that, ya see, an' see do
they care for ya.  Some mens don't care if you work yourse'f to
death.  An' some mens will tell you to "let that alone an' rest."
"I think you oughta let that alone.  Let. . .an' rest.  You can't
do everything all at one time."
TL:  Well, what happens if you get a man that lets you work to death?
BJ:  You got to consider yourself.  An' don't do it.  That's all.
You got to consider, that's all.  You got to consider yourself
an' don't do it, 'cause you see he don't care.  Y-you can try.
You can jus' try.  Work, work yourself 'till you fall down; you just
try to, ya know?  I mean, jus' try to jus' ac' it sometime.  Like,
"I just cain't move another step.  I'm so tired."  An' if he
don't care about you work, ya see, he don't care nothin' about
ya.  He don't care -- He ain't feelin' for ya.  I mean, he
come in there an' you is been workin', he know it.  Perhaps he
didn' have much to do that day or, or come in early, you. . .An'
he don't care -- An' all that do be done; he ain' moved nothin' an'
ain't got -- He'll walk down the street with somebody else
laughin' an' talkin', you yet got to go out, you yet got to go to
the sto', you yet got to cook, an' then he come in:  "I'm hongry!
Ain't you got nothin' to eat done?"  An' don't give a rap how
much you work today.  Watch that stuff.  See?  Watch an' see do
he care for ya.  See?  Watch 'im.
