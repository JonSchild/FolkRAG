Ballad of a Lumberjack

By PINE CONE

M. Labor 
Jan 7, 1938

Work your head off little scab
Take a striker's place and grab
But remember little fellow
That the world knows you are yellow
And the time will come when you
Wish that you had joined the "crew."
C.I.O. ten million strong...
That's our goal... it won't be long...
Solid as the old Gibraltar
C.I.O. will never falter
C.I.O. will point the way
to a better, brighter day.
Pause a bit before you grab...
Think it over, little scab.
