somehow or 'nother.  An' she caught that a knoll a dirt an' she had
got the, ah, lifted from everywhere -- she was swimmin'. An' ah,
an', snakes, she said, snakes an' the 'gators an' everything
was there.  You could just grab a addigator an' keep movin' on 'im,
if ya wanted to.  'Cause he was tryin' to find somewhere.  He ain't

it an' she climbed up to it an' find she could git up on it an'
not knowin' what it was.  But yet she was in water, you know.

the next day, said the water started fallin'.  It fell like mad;
it jus' wen' on down, you know.  'Cause Palm Beach was t-- was

said that she prayed so that she wasn't even hongry.  Yeah, an' I
know [,I knew] 'bout how that was.
