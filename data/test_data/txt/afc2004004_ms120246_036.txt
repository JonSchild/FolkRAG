the chicken was briefly rubbed over 
Fl's and Fl's wife's head & then the
chicken was killed as usual & the
tufts of feathers stuck to the wall
Everything washed.  A white sheet
is spread in front of E's table 
& M's food.
Before the marines came they used to
serve the lois in calbash & in holes in 
the ground.  They were no great peristyles
like Ti Cousin's. No loi never ate off
a plate before & now they want good
dress & glasses & expensive cups.
R. protests that the service we have
just seen is more genuine Guenê
than others in Theoline's homefort
& that the houngan knows more 
than Theoline wd know in 100 yrs.
All she knows how to do is
to dress nice and spend about 2
3 hundred dollars.
The food is all [walsing?]
