Mr. Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archives of American Folk-Song
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C. 

Dear Mr. Lomax:

          Your recordings of songs known by Mrs. Jennie Devlin,
of Gloucester, N. J. on June 20 is a source of much satisfaction
to her and to me. As you know, I have the texts
and tunes of all of her songs, the scoring having been done 
by Miss Janet Grimler. We anticipate publication within a
year, but it is pleasant to realize that the songs will be
on file at the Library of Congress indefinitely, regardless 
of what happens to Mrs. Devlin or to our ambitions.
          I should, however, like to have the songs reserved for
a period of two years, with a renewal option at the end of
that time, in case publication would be deferred. May I
also request a limited use of the records, as I understand
that frequent playing is injurious to them? I shall want
to use them myself in the fall, and would not want you or
your staff to feel restricted in their use, either, for
I am most appreciative of the aims and achievements of the
Archives.
          Please let me know if such reservations are acceptable
to your department. 
          With thanks for your kindness in coming to Gloucester,
                                                   Sincerely yours,
                                                   [Kay Dealy]
