[Bob sang another rollicking, dancing
play party tune [the refrain
of] which ran:
Charlie he's a nice young,
Charlie he's a dandy;
Every time he goes to town
He brings them girls some candy.
The higher up the cherry tree,
The riper grows the cherry;
The sooner a young man courts [the] a girl,
The sooner she will marry.

Then followed a jigging [stories?]
When Bob would cut the
pigeon wing, knock the back 
strip, or do the double shuffle
while an admiring crowd stood 
around.

[He was my boyhood hero.] I used
to chant his song as I galloped
[se] my pony [?]  over the Bosque
Hills:
Bobby he's a nice young man,
Bobby he's a dandy

He always wore the best clothes with
money jingling in his pockets, and
big clanking spurs on his heel]

On Saturdays Bob and his 
bunch of [?] would go to
Meridian, the county seat, and spend
the day [?] drinking in the saloon
and playing pool or poker. As
darkness fell the group would 
mount their ponies at the hitching rack
where they had stood patiently all
day. Inflamed with liquor
they would spur their mounts
