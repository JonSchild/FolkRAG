Chas Wooley
He comes, he comes the judge severe 
The 7th trumpet speaks him near
His lightning flash, his thunders roll
How welcome to the faithful soul

Camp Meeting
He comes, he comes, the judge severe
Roll, Jordan, Roll
The 7th trumpet speaks him near
Roll, Jordan, Roll

Negro
O roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
I want to go to heaven
when I die
To hear old Jordan roll

White
At his table we'd sit down
Christ will gird himself and serve us
With sweet manna all around.

Negro
Gwine sit down at the welcome table
Gwine to feast off milk an' honey

White
My soul shall shine
Like the morning star
In the new Jerusalem

Negro
My little soul gonna
shine like a star

White
I have some friends before me gone

Negro
I've got a mother in the snowhite fields

White
My home is over Jordan

Negro
Deep river, my home is over Jordan

White
I'm glad that I'm born to die
From grief and woe my soul
shall fly.

Negro
I'm glad that I'm born to die
From trouble here my soul
gonna fly.
