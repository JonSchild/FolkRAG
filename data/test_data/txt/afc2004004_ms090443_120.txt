AL:Who was"they?"  Bad men in the levee camp?
WB:Bad folk in the levee camp.  See you have people--now you take the
big     guy, they called him Race Rider.  He had money by the briefcase-full.  
He had 4 guards, four bodyguards.  He as on up to West Memphis, Lake 
Powell, Memphis, McGhee,     , St. Joe, Natchez, Betty  (?)  and
all those places where they gamble at.  He got four body guards.
Now he went from much poorer than I am now cause he was starving. 
At the levee camp, you couldn't tell what kind of pants he had on, so 
many patches on them you  ouldn't tell what color the pants was.  He
was starving at the levee and then got lucky and won $6000 dollars.
And he's been going ever since. 

AL:Is he still going around?
WB:Well it's been--I haven't saw him since about '69. 

AL:Thy call him Race Rider?  (Yeah.)  Because when he comes into a 
gambling situation, he's going to rule it?
WB:When he comes into a gambling situation if he can get you one time,
he just about got you broke, because he bet you $5000, $6000, $10,000
dollars.  Well now, that's the way he makes his money.

AL:Well you said you were running away from somebody or some situation.
WB:Well it was in the camp, you know, where I be gambling.  But it
wasn't Race Rider.  No Race Rider was the man that tote alot of money
and had body guards.
