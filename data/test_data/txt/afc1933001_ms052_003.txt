Mr. Paul G. Brewster
Oakland City, Indiana
Dear Mr. Brewster:
I am very much interested in your song the 
"Battle of New Orleans" which appeared in the
Southern Folk Lore Quarterly of September 1937.
Would you be willing for me to include it
in the second volume of "American Ballads and
Folk Songs" which I am preparing for publication, 
of course, with due acknowledgement of the sources.
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
