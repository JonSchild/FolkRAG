Jokes
I. Two soldiers were talking in
 the barracks at night.
     "Tom, I see your feet sticking
out from under the covers. Why
don't you pull them in?"
     "Listen, I don't wan't to put
them cold things in bed with me."

II. "What couldn't you do if I
cut your ears off?"
     "I couldn't see."
     "I said your ears."
     "I couldn't see, because my
 ears hold my hat up."

III.  Sentry on guard duty and 
a woman comes up with
some donuts.
     "Halt who goes there."
     "Friend" with donuts."
     "[D] Friends pass, donuts halt."
