TOILERS ARISE!
Words and music by E. Carpenter

Toilers arise! the long, long night is over
Faint in the east behold the dawn appear;
Out of your evil dream of toil and sorrow;
Arise, O Toilers, for the day is here:
From your fields and hills,
Hark, the answer swells,
Arise, O toilers, for the day is here.

By your young children's eyes so red with weeping
By their white faces ages with want and fear
By the dark cities where your [children] babes are creeping
Naked of joy and all that makes life dear;
From each wretched slum
Let the loud cry come;
Arise of toilers, for the day is here.

Over your face a web of lies is woven,
Laws that are falsehoods pin you to the ground
Labor is mocked,  its just reward is stolen,
On its bent back sits Idleness encrowned.
How long while you sleep,
Your harvest shall it reap?
Arise, O toilers, for the day is here.

Forth, then, ye heroes, patriots and lovers, 
Comrades of danger pverty and scorn
Mighty in faith of freedom your great Mother
Giants refreshed in Joys new rising morn
Come and swell the song, 
Silent now so long:
Labor is risen! and the day is here.
