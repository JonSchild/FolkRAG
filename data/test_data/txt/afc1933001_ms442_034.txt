Red Cross Sto'
Some Negroes, at least, weren't carried away by a patriotic desire to enlist during the last war: this Negro man shows a wise animal suspicion of the strange agency which was "mixing ev'ything in whisky an' wine" and sending men off to be made up into soldiers. He is beautifully indifferent to his wife's desire to make a hero of him and the dialogue is authentic both as to diction and manner.

Chorus:
I tol’ her, “No—o,
Baby, I don’ want to go,
Yes, an’ I ain’ goin’ down to no Red Cross sto’.”

Says, “Daddy, I come here to set down on your knee,
Ain’ you goin’ down there to fight for you an’ me?”

Says, “Daddy, I jes’ come here because I’m your wife,
Ain’ you goin’ down there to fight for you an’ yo life?”

She came back there an’ shook my han’
Says, “Can’t you go down there an’ fight like a man?”

L.B. Speaks: “Better get away from here, gal, ‘cause you know I ain’ goin’ to no Red Cross sto’. I ain’ never been down there befo’ an’ I ain’  goin’ down there now.”

L.B. Sings: She says “I come here ‘cause they feedin’ mighty fine
Mixin’ ev’ything up with whiskey an’ wine.”

She says “Daddy, they feedin better than I ever seen,
Feedin’ ev’ybody offa po’k an’ beans,”

She come back here, says, “They feedin’ offa ham,”
Says, “Get away from here, gal, I don’ give a damn.” 

Chorus
I tol’ her, “No—o,
Baby, you know I don’ want to go
Yes, an’ I ain’ goin’ down to no Red Cross sto’.”
