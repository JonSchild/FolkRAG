MurrayL I'm a wee rovin' lassie.

Identical to Blanche Woods - with exception of last verse, where 
the first two lines are reversed...

Barbara Allen:  Mrs Muray:

1) In Scotland I was born and bred,
In Scotland I was dwelling,
Till I fell in love wi' a pretty fair maid,
And her name was Barbara Allen.

2) I courted her for seven long years
Till I could court no longer,
And I fell sick and very sick
And I sent for my true lover.

3) Barbra Allen she was sent for
To the place where she was dwelling,
And as she drew the curtains back
"Young man, I think you're dying."

4) "Dying, dear, what do you mean?
One kiss from you will cure me."
"One kiss from me you never shall have,
Though you're dying, dying, dying.

Weel May the Boatie Row:  Mrs Murray.

1) Weel may the boatie row and weel may she speed,
Weel may the boatie row that wins the bairnie's bread.
The boatie rows, the boatie rows, the boatie rows, fareweel,
And muckle luck maintain the boat, the mackerel and the creel.

2) We're sure to                           our fishes we got nine,
There's three to boil and three to fry and three to bait the line.
Chorus:
3) When some day Jock and Jim meet there, up, in
They help to gar the boatie row and lighten our work here. (Ch-)
