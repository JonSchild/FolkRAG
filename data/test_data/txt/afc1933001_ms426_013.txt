FIGHTING FOR THE OLD FARM PLACE

Tune-Tenting on the Old Camp Ground.

We are tired of war on the old farm place,
Watching her slip away,
Trying like slaves her debt erase,
Dreading foreclosure day.
Many are the homes that are weary tonight,
Longing for the war to cease;
Many are the hearts looking for the right,
To see the dawn of peace.
Weary tonight, weary tonight,
Weary on the old farm place.
Weary tonight, weary tonight,
Weary on the old farm place.

We've been driven from farms and the country dear,
Into the city cold.
Living our lives in dread and fear,
A story that can't be told.
Many are the hearts that are broken tonight,
Longing for the farm again,
Many are the tears, flowing in the night,
Of those who tired to win.
Crying tonight, crying tonight,
Crying for the old farm place.
Crying tonight, crying tonight,
Crying for the old farm place.

We are battling tonight on a storm tossed sea,
Struggling to save the wreck,
Of farms and homes and liberty,
The greed of gold to check.
Many Union soldiers are ready to die,
Women as well as men.
Many valient souls will not deny,
The cause of right 'gainst sin.
Fighting tonight, fighting tonight, 
fighting for the old farm place.
Fighting tonight, fighting tonight, 
fighting for the old farm place.
