To Cousin -
      Chavela and I found him in his slippers
in one of his fine houses. A huge man - 6' 4" 
and massive to match.  He seems the most
 powerful creature & one of the most hiugly 
men I have ever seen. A deep voice a 
head with a flat back, huge jaw, quiet 
& completely sure of himself. He speaks more 
freely about vandvo than any Haitian I have
ever met. Us he treated tolerantly. 
We went the round of his houses.
