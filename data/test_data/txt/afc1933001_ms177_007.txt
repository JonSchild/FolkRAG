Captain Thomas Howard Carpenter
Lewes, Delaware
Dear Captain Carpenter:
I recently saw a clipping from the
Philadelphia Ledger containing a story
about your interesting life.  It occurred
to me that you might possibly have picked
up some old-time sea songs and ballads in
the course of your travels, particularly
material relating to Delaware Bay.
If you know any such material or know
where it may be obtained, I would greatly
appreciate this information so that we 
may add these songs to our large collection
of American folk songs in the Library of
Congress.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
