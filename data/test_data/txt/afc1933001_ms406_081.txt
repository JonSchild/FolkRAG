with its noise and efficiency and speed makes singing impossible. The isolation and loneliness found in frontier conditions, have bred the folk songs and ballads of America. Wherever men have worked in situations in which their entertainment depends on their own resources they have inevitably turned to song as one form of solace. When they grow tired of singing all the songs they know they make up songs. Naturally the songs are of their lives. This is certainly true of such types of songs as cowboy songs, the lumberjacks, miners' songs, railroad songs, the songs of the forty-niners, the songs of the Great Lakes, the songs of the Erie Canal, etc. Men living without books, newspapers, in remote communities without social advantages have made their own in the form of ballads or songs. Some of them ave of such merit as to live, and it is these that we are able to preserve. The ballad making of the Negro goes on and his beautiful spirituals are unique in the literature of the world. His songs when better known will doubtless win an equal place in the of mankind.
