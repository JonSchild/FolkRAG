Rumor Report
September 29, 1942

   The rumor report will be out, as you know, tomorrow or
Wednesday.  Can I have from you, please, a list of those special
people not included in the regular list of 164 who receive the
weekly Intelligence Report, who should receive this particular
issue.  I have already made provisions for it to be sent to Allport
and Knapp.
