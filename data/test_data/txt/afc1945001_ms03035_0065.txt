                and Michigan Avenue. As we were discussing various subjects this man
                stated that he had heard from different persons, there was a very much
                dissension between the white and colored soldiers, in regards to the
                way they were being treated, but did not enlarge on the topic of 
                discussion. This was one reason he stated he did not want to go into
                the Army.
