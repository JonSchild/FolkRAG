from her.
Shirley and the children
came tonight for a trip with
us down to Port Aransas.
Chris will come there for
them.  I wish you might
be along.  Johnny works
near there and will come down.
I have mentioned some important 
business matters in recent
letters, which are due a reply.
Also, I shall not any longer
send you enclosures unless I
have some sort of acknowledgement.  
When I pour water in 
a hole in the ground I want 
to hear a splash so as to know
it struck bottom.
Lovingly,  Father
