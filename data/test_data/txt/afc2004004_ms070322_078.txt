always feel guilty because I haven't
handled these things. Actually, what
I resent in Robin is that she doesn't
care enough about the talent & temperament
that I have to care about
pampering it a bit. I'm always deferring
to her. Then I hit her. Or make
demands on her. But not agressively
enough so that she really hates me.
O well. The stars outside have
the answer. I'm tired.
-- Glad we came here. The Cornish
coasts are beautiful. The direct
Atlantic breaking hard against grey
granite cliffs. The green land
with only a fringe or rabbit pasture
coming to the edge of the cliffs & 
the curves of the land, soft, feminine
& as full of surprises & charms as
the flesh of a woman or a child.
