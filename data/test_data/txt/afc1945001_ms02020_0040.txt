Mr. John B. Kaiser, Librarian,
Oakland Public Library,
Main Library Office,
632 - 14th Street ,
Oakland, California

Dear Mr. Kaiser:

            The two most popular topics of conversation in
Allendale, which would be of interest to the Office
of Facts and Figures, are, the housing situation and
the rubber drive.
            Almost daily we are asked if we know of any rentals.
Borrowers report that they have been approached by
trailer owners who wish to rent backyard space for a
camp. Home owners say that real estate people come to
them and ask to list their places. They could see nothing
to be gained even though they were able to sell at a good
price, as they would then have to hunt for a place to live.
It is reported that families are living in small store
buildings which have been empty for a long time. We have
had a number of out-of-the-state new borrowers, from Missouri,
Oklahoma, etc.
            In regard to the rubber drive, people were glad to give
any scrap rubber they had, but sometimes remarked that it
would cost more to reclaim the rubber than it was worth.
Some also said they would give up their tires, gladly, if
need be, but they did not think the making of artificial
rubber had been speeded up as it should be.
            Scattered comments heard by the staff:
"People are talking more. Intelligent, thinking people are
becoming more stirred up about the war--not exactly with
patriotism, but with anger at 'bungling, waste, and greed'
in higher places."
"A man cannot do his best work when he works eight hours a       [*7-b*]
day seven days a week with no vacation. But we're not complaining, 
when we think of the poor boys over there who are
being shot to pieces."
"We should help beat Hitler first, then Japan. In the meantime 
the Pacific coast will have to 'take it'. We are spread
out too thin."
"The war can't end now. Manufacturers would lose too much
money."
                                                       Respectfully submitted,

                                                                 LaVon Schreiber
