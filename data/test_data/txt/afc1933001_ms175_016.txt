Dear Mr. Partch: 

Your work sounds extremely [inte??sting], 
and I hope some day to 
hear you talk about it, face to face. 
Human speech, particularly as spoken 
by people rather than poets, is in 
some ways music richer than our 
musicians can comprehend. I wish you 
could hear some of the magnificent 
human documents on records here in 
our collection. Somehow, though, it 
seems to me that for the moment we 
need songs which are simple and direct 
and courageous, rather than subtly 
exploratory. 
Sincerely yours, 

Alan Lomax
