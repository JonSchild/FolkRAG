To judge by the decay of my
routine handwriting it has
destroyed my character ????

Afterward I tried to find Ennis
who had never come & around whom 
the plot was constructed, [but he] He
[t] was sitting at a radio banquet.
He's a fool. But of course I like
him because he's talented while
I feel myself not.

Anyway I'm happy alone in
bed & I did cruise the streets
tonight like a high school senior
and try to pick up girls. Accosted
two & they didn't seem absolutely
repelled. Good night, every
lover of this crazy country.
I might be solid but time
enough won't be given or
granted me.
