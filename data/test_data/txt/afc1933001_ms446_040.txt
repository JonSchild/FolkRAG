21

The rich man slept on his velvet couch,
And dreamed of his silver and gold,
While the orphan lay on a bed of snow,
And murmuring, "So cold, so cold!"

When the morning dawned the little girl
Still lay at the rich man's door,
But her soul had fled to it's home above,
Where there's room and bread for the poor.

No more she stood at the rich man's door,
And crying, "So cold, so cold!"
With a crown on her head and a harp in her hand,
She sang in a house of gold.

POOR  PILGRIM SORROW

I am a poor pilgrim of sorrow,
Cast out in this wild world to roam,
I have no promise of the morrow,
I have started to make heaven my home.

CHORUS:

Sometimes I am tossed and driven,
Sometimes I know not where to roam,
I have heard of the city called heaven,
I have started to make it my home.

I know I am weak and unworthy,
My heart is so prone to sin,
But Jesus the Savior Almighty,
Has promised to take me in.    Cho.

My mother has reached the bright glory,
My father is still wandering in sin,
My brothers and sisters won't own me,
Because I am trying to get in.    Cho.
