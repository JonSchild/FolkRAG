                                                 10.
     An' Mister Higgens tell me, "Mike, you convict on two crime----'reportin' yo' ((name wrong)) an' sellin' duck. Boy, ain't you know xx you can't sell no duck now we got so much law in de land? An' you got a licence, ain't you?" No? Well, dat make three crime --- you convict on three. Boy, dat look serious."
     Den de magister turn an' talk low-like to de sheriff. I jest can't help but hear what he say:
     "Sheriff, 'fore I left Bucksport, dat de second nigger I work. Dat man don't give you no trouble."
     Den he turn to me an' say,
     "My fine is twenty-five dollar or thirty days. Reckon he'll have to take you to de gang, Mike. You got twenty-five dollar, ain't you?"
     But I ain't hab nothin'. So I stay in de jail. I does hate to go to dat gang, but dey ain't nothin' else to do. When night come on de sheriff give a order for to hab me ready for de gang at four on de mornin', dat dey gwine make a start 'fore day clean.
     An' I lie in my bunk an' think. Nobody up dat time of day, so no chance of anybody seein'  me goin' off in de gang. An' Before I close my eye, de fowl crow. By sun-up we is started an' been way down yonder about eighteen or twenty mile from a town next Carver's Bay. Dat mornin' I ride till I so tired I don't know whether I is sleepin' or walkin'.
     Dat been Christmas week!
     De head man of de gang arrange with ole Mike. He tell me for to assist de cook. Cut de wood an' tote de water, an' wash up de dirty dishes. Two days gone by like two month.
