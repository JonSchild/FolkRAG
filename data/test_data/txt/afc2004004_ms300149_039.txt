Dear Mr. Lomax,
I gladly received the 
check 11.25 Friday. It surely
was appreciated and your kindness
too. Mr Lomax when we made
those tapes for you at the Davis
home one night. The one that
notified me didn't explain just
what it was all about If so
I could have taped you some 
songs that are around a hundred
years old that isn't on records,
and I also have some songs
that I wrote my self. I'm
very sorry I didn't get the
right understanding before I made
the tapes for you so I could
have taken my old songs,
Mr Lomax if you are in
this community again please
look me up. You could find
where I live very easily. I 
live 5 miles south of Hillsville 
Va. On Route 52 about
