Summary of Criticism

As compared with other collections and analyses of rumors this study by 
means of the intensive interview has certain advantages. It determines 
the number of rumors known to each person. It begins to yield an 
understanding of the effect of the rumor, the proportion of rumor believed, 
the roles of prejudice, information, tension, and social participation. 

From the investigational point of view the study is well planned, and 
the results informative. 

Its chief weakness lies in the complete lack of relation between the 
study and the vital problem of rumor control. It leaves the translation 
of findings into action programs to others who have not the experience 
or insight that the interviewers have not acquired, and the 
report does nothing to help those entrusted with rumor control.

I recommend that no more studies of this type be conducted until the 
machinery of rumor control is sufficiently organized to dictate the 
nature of the investigation, the classification of results, and the 
method of the report.

I recommend further that Special Report No. 21 be compared with R. H. 
Knapp's report on rumors having national currency (September 1-15). 
The latter is a much less expensive study, more superficial, but 
equally practical.

Detailed Comments

Summary: The statement that "the people with the most information 
are most prolific in rumors" does not quite 
capture the finding which is that the alert, active, 
participant, semi-educated person seems most likely 
to yield the most rumors when questioned.

The point that about 70 per cent of the rumors are 
believed should be included in the summary.
