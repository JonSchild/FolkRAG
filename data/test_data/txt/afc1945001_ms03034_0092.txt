Dear Dr. Allport:

Thanks for your communication of October 8th
and for your suggestions and criticisms embodied in it.

We all deplore the omission of credit to Knapp 
in the release which you saw. A subsequent rewrite of the
report, however, mentions Knapp and the Boston Rumor Clinic
in the body of the text and it is this latter form which
will receive the widest circulation.

It is true that we didn't discuss methods of combatting
rumor in any detail. The purpose of the report
which we sent you was perhaps not complete known to you.
Principally, its objective was to interest the operating
bureaus of the organization in this problem as one to which
a reasonable proportion of their time should be dedicated.
This objective has been secured and in this respect the
report is a success, although its deficiencies from a
scientific point of view are, as you point out, manifest.

Again, thanks for the trouble you have taken to
put us on the right track--one which I assure you we will 
make every effort to follow.

Sincerely yours,

Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
