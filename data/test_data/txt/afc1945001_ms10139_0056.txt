    A soldier returning to camp from a furlough
found the following letter waiting for him

M is for the many times you made me
O is for the other times you tried
T is for the tourist cabin week ends
H is for the hell that's in your eyes
E is for the everlasting love light
R is for the wreck you made of me

Put when all together and they spell
Mother, that's what I'm going to be
   The soldier answered the letter with this
reply:
F is for your funny little letter
O is for the answer to your note
T is for the tender accusations
H is for ----- you hope that I'm the goat
E is for the ease with which I made you
R is for the room we  used so free
  Put them all together they spell Father but
