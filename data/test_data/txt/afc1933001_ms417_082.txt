LET THEM WEAR THEIR WATCHES FINE

You factory folks who sing this rhyme,
Will surely understand
The reason why I love you so
Is I'm a factory hand, you know.

While standing here between my looms
You know, I lose no time
To keep my shuttles in a whiz
And write this little rhyme.

We rise up early in the morn
And work all day real hard.
To buy our little meat and bread
And sugar, tea, and lard.

We work from weeks end to weeks end
And never lose a day.
And when that awful pay day comes,
We draw our little pay.

We then go home on pay day night
And sit down in a chair
The merchant raps upon the door
- He's come to get his share.

When all our little debts are paid
And nothing left behind
We turn our pockets wrong side out
But not a cent can find.

We rise up early in the morn
And toil from soon till late
We have no time to primp or fix
And dress right up to date.

Our children they grow up unlearned
No time to go to school
Almost before they learn to walk
They learned to spin or spool.

The boss men jerk them round and round
And whistle very keen
I'll tell you what, the factory kids
Are really treated mean.

The folks in town who dress so fine
And spend their money free
Will hardly look at a factory hand
Who dresses like you or me.

As we go walking down the street
All wrapped in lint and strings
They call us fools and factory trash
And other lowdown things.

CHORUS : O, let them wear their watches fine
Their rings and pearly strings
But when our day of judgement comes
We'll make 'em shed their purty things.
