Rumors
   About six months ago a rumor
was out about Hitler being dead.
We know it was a rumor because
it is out again.  Some of these rumors
are a injury to our country.  One
person can say something about a
thing they wish were not true.
As it passes from person to person
it changes or something is added.
By the time it reaches the last
person, or the person who stops 
it, it has all together a different
meaning.   Rumors are a help to
our enimies.  There are spies
stationed throughout our country
to start these.  So, when we
first hear of one, weather it is true
or not, let's stop it!
Rhyme
If we want to win,
Now we must begin
To buy those bonds & stamps
To help light up our lamps.
