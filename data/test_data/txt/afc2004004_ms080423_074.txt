AL:   I hear they'll kill ya if you start messin' with them, tho.
Witt:   Well, they claim that Shelton Laurel (??) 's a bad place,
but I've always got along good with them.  They're awful
nice people over there.     (TECHNICAL)
AL:   Mr. Witt, what kind of tobacco is this?
Witt:   I don't know, it's just (unint.) is all I know.
Tech:   It's real (?) tobacco or wrapper(?)?
Mr. Witt:   Huh?
Tech:   Is that used for a fill(?) or a wrapper?
Witt:   Well, they use it for both, I guess.   It'd have to 
be a good tobacco.   They just pick out the best leafs for
wrappers.  Then they pick out the worst, and they go in
the fillers.
AL:   The tobacco harvest is on here in Madison County, in
the edge of the Smokeys.   We're right in the middle of it.
The hands(?) of tobacco march down the hillside like ghosts,
and Mr. Witt here is working his hillside farm.  This is the 
kind of country where, they use to say, the coves(?) are so
narrow that you have to pry 'em apart so day can break, and
the animals here, the tow(?) animals have to have their legs
short on one side, so they can move around the hillside, is
that right Mr. Witt?
Witt:   I guess it is.
AL:   What about the potatoes, what do you do about potatoes
here?
