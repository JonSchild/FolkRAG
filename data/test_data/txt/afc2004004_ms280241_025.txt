Jean: Of course. There were times you had to watch yourself.
Yousee, travelling about is alright if there's two or three of
you together. But nowadays, it very seldom happens.
Lomax: Of course, there are laws against travelling people, too,
aren't there?
Jean: The only law against them is that they're not allowed
to camp any place that's forbidden. But you have the same
protection that every other body has.
Lomax: I thought you couldn't stay more than so many hours in
a place.
Jean: You might come to a market-stand where it says only 24
hours is allowed. But you see, old camping-grounds are done away
with. That's why the people's not getting out about travelling
around. They've done away with all the market stances, and the
greens and places that used to be a "accomody" (?) which come under
the crown, and when it's accomody you can stay on it as
long as you like. But now that's all done away with. They've
taken them over for developing new places on. You get a lot
of great experiences if you rode upon the road at times. You
would have to watch.
Lomax: Do you remember any of these stories as old as Jerusalem?
Jean: I used to mind them, but not now. Old, old stories. Stories

Lomax: It would be wonderful to hear one.
Jean: I remember stories back away. . .I expect they happened

girlie, and her brother was a wee boy when it happened. They
had their eagon, of course, there were two or three wagons, and
at that time the people made what they called bathies, - that's
a carpet for your door. And it wasn't the people of the locality
or the farmers or anything. They did come from Aberdeen some
place, and one man came in first, and my granny was just a young
woman, and she'd a sister. She was a blonde, an actual blonde,
the first blonde that ever I seed. She was just about 16 - a
small made-up girl, very blonde, and she was living with her
sister, and they had come to this place. This man came in -- he
wasn't a farm-servant, and he'd a gun over his shoulder, and he
spoke away nice enough for a while, then finally started to make
advances to the young girl. It was only a start, you see, and of
course, when he made these advances, the girl was angry. So when
she grew angry, her sister saw that he was being rude to her, so
she told him to lay his hands offthe girl. The girl of 16 was
getting very frightened of him. So he wouldna take her telling.
So she lost her temper and she hit him with something, and he
