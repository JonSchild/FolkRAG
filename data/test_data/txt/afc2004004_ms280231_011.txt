TAPE 10: EWAN McCOLL.
Cooper of Fife:
1)  There was a wee cooper who lived in Fife,
      Nickety-nackety-noo-noo-noo,
      And he has married a gentle wife,
      Hey willie wallacky hey John Dougal Alane
      Qoo rushety roo roo roo.

2)   She wouldna work, she wouldna sew,
      For spoiling of her comely hue.

3)   She wouldna bake she wouldna spin
      For spoilin' o' her gentle kin.

4)  Noo the cooper has gane to his wool pack
And he's laid a sheepskin on his wife's back.

5)  "O, I'll not be shaming your gentle kin,
But I must whelp my ain sheep's skin.

6)  Now ye ha' married a[b]gentle wife,
Just find ye the wee cooper of Fife.

Maggie Lauder:
1)  Wha wouldna be in love wi' bonnie Maggie Lauder
A piper met her going to Fife
And spiered what wast they called her.
Right scornfully she answered him
"Begone you highland shaker.
Jog on your gate you bladder skate,
My name is Maggie Lauder."

2)  "Maggie," quo' he, "And by my bags,
I'm figdin fain to see ya.
Sit down by me, my bonny burd,
And faith, I winna speer thee.
For I'm a piper to my trade,
My name is Rab the Ranter.
The lassie's look as they were daft
When I blow up my chanter."
