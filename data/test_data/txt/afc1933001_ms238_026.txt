Dear Father:
The book came, was autographed and mailed
to Mr. Hill. I have been working 15 hours a day
lately. I think that we had better go directly to
San Antonia and meet you there. I hadn't realized
I am on the first day's program.
Mr. Armstrong wrote me a letter the other
day reniguing the engagement. Said he couldn't 
promise the crowd. I was frankly delighted. I
don't want the date, May 16. In fact, I don't
want to do any more work after the 10 until I
get back to Washington.
The letter about the old lady in Commanshe
is very exciting, but it came too late for me to
make any plans about a recording machine. We'll
talk about that when I get there. It's too early 
to make any plans for recording this fiscal year
since we haven't heard from the appropriations.
The McClousky lady sounds interesting.
Sounds like you should send her stuff on your
Ballad Hunter program for use in her school. I
guess I won't get to see her since the Waco lecture
is off.
I expect to see you in San Antonio, and to
stop in Dallas between the lecture and the wedding.
I don't know yet what plans are, but we're going
to hit the road for the mountains somewhere after 
that.

Much love,
