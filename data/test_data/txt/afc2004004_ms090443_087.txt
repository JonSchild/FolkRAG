W.B. Tape 1 / 2

Lake Bald mouth, La. and he had an agent on the place named Danny Hill.
So we moved out there, right by the church, sitting there now. There I grew up
and started goin to school. And after I started going to school, we moved
from there over on the hill. Times got tough and my daddy would go out
and he'd kill this and he'd kill that. There wasn't no hunting license
then, you could kill anything you wanted to. Much more game then there
is now. He used to go out when the creeks got low, & in that mud he'd
get catfish, g_________, all kind of fish. He'd bring them home, put
them down in the barrel in the salt and salt them down, and he'd take
them out and wipe them and hang them up and they'd call that dried fish.
And we'd have something to eat back then.

And 19 and 18 we went to White Hall, Arkansas. Over there with the 
flu, the influenza, they called it. Killing people by the housefull.
Every body in the house I was living in -- with my Uncle Phil -- everybody
in that house was sick but me and Aunt Ely. And my Daddy, he went and 
took my mother one morning, and he told her Aunt Ely wouldn't half feed
me. But everybody else was sick. We had onions cut up in the coffee 
cans and everybody would put their own t______ in, drinking
their own thing , and everybody had their own can. That was for that cough
and for that fever and for that flu. But somehow God blessed me and I took
not to get down sick. I had to be the one to do all the running. They
had the store quarrentined and they wouldn't let anybody in the store.
So one morning I went to the store, my daddy sent me there. I went to 
the store and I got some Gennonda sausage, they called it dolly
sausage then, long, good, with plenty of streaks of meat and streaks of
fat, like that big round gut. I came back and brought it to the house
