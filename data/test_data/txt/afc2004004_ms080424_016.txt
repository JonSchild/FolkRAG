Stan and Ray Hicks  2
hung out with.  Well, he said, "reach your hands out!"  And he reached
out and he rubbed ther and he says "You go back home, you un go back
home. . .I'll hire you."  My hands was tough. . .and that's the way they
hired you now, and then you had to go at it, like Stanley says.  You
had to go and shoot your legs around.  A jumpin, a swampin'(?) them
roads or anything, . . . and then on the little old farms here, like
he said, when you hit an oak cradle.  You had to be wet, he argued
with me I'd been in the creek.  That's what they argued him, he'd been
in the creek, 'you ain't cut no oaks, if he wasn't with ya, you ain't
cut none, you been swimmin' in the creek!'  Sweat would run down in
your shoe tops.  Well, if you didn't cut, and make 'em a lot of oak
cuttin', they'd send you home!  And then some men would say, "now I'll
try you out," a stranger that heared about you, and he sent for you.
"Now I'll try you out, and if you  can't speed up, can't you cut no
faster than that. . . Now if you can't speed up, I'll just have to dishire
you"
Stan:  Now, I cut a many a oaks, in hard times, as Ray is talkin' about,
real hard times, so I had to go a bit fast myself.  I was trained up
that way, and it's pretty hard to slow down, you know.  And I cut oaks
all over this moutain here and you'd have to cut a hundred dozen a day.
100 dozen a day, if you couldn't cut 100 dozen a day, they'd probably
send you home.  And you'd get 75 cents.  And diggin' (unint) and stuff, you
know, hard times, talkin' abut hard times, it was hard times.  And you
know, my mother, was out to parch corn, to make coffee; parch chestnuts
to make coffee, there ain't no chestnut anymore, you know, the (unint)
killed them.  And we eat corn meal gravy, corn meal bread is what we
had.  But dad raised a lot of wheat, had one of these things ya bowed(?)
