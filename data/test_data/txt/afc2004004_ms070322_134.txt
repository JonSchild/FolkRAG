she was terribly tired & discouraged
from a dreadful hard year of barnstorming
& she clung to me needed love & I 
gave her all I could - Discovered
that I need now to love in order
to feel much in an embrace
Both English women I slept
with have starved rich feeling
behind - distasteful - a rather
violent sexual odor bad diet -
Joan, herself, is wonderful woman
& I told her my troubles & she
behaved magnificently. But she
wept when we parted, clung to me
a bit & I found out how Robin
must have felt. God, I'll never
do that again! Poor Robin!
What  a fool I played!
