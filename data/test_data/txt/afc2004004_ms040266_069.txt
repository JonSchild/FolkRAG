Dear Mr. Lomax & Miss M[owison?] -

Having for a long time been an admirer of your most revealing programmes - I am now asking for a particular favor? - 

Would it be feasible to let me hear once again - & jointly allow me a tape copy of curtain songs? 

I am specially & primarily interested in ancient [Easkeira?] [forms?] of harmony, that you have found survivals of in western Europe -

1 Could you possibly allow me to hear + have the song of the (15 Albanian Colonists Heu[?] you recorded in Calabria - (50th programme) This, I should value, most greatly - 

2 The song of Byzantine origin of which you [guided?] a part from Puglia region (6th programme) 

3 The ?Saidinan Harmonies from Genoa region (6th programme) shepherds singing. If this would be possible you would be doing an exceedingly great favour - I should of course emphasize, that my object is solely private study, & not
