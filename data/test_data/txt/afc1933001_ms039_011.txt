Dr. Herbert Putnam
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Dr. Putnam:

With further reference to the purchase of a 
recording machine for the Library of Congress and to
expidite its delivery, I think that in order to be
sure that the "Presto" will do our work satisfactorily,
that I be instructed in running it and that the microphone
is the best available for group signing, I should
ask for your authorization of my travelling expenses to
New York City and return to be met by the Library and
chargeable to the appropriation, "Increase of the Library."
This request is made after conference with the
experts in the Music Division and with the Business
Office.

I can get a two days leave of absence from my
other work and will gladly donate my time in the behalf.

Very respectfully,
J. A. L.
