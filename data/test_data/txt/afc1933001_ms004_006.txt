JOHN A. LOMAX  - ROUTE 4 BOX 341 FOREST HILLS - DALLAS TEXAS

May 24th, 1933.

Mr. Carl Engel,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Engel:

I have received two long letters from 
Mr. Garwick.  I am handing you herewith a copy of 
the last one.

Among the men I interviewed while in 
New York, this man impressed me as the most dependable 
because he has had the actual experience with 
trying out the recording machines under all sorts 
of road difficulties.  Of course, he has something 
to sell and wants to sell it.  You will notice that 
he has made a substantial reduction in price over 
what has been quoted.  Another important and favorable 
change is in the weight of the machine, which 
must be carried in a light car, because we will travel 
far away from concrete pavements.

You are busy with ten thousand other 
calls on your time; but I do wish that you would 
write and let me know what prospects you have found 
of securing a machine for my use this summer as I 
travel back to Washington.  To freshen your mind 
again, I plan to visit the chain gang camps of 
Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and the negro 
districts of New Orleans, Vicksburg, Memphis and 
St. Louis and any other of the river towns that 
seem worth while, stopping at as I journey by river 
steamer from New Orleans to St. Louis.  Of course, 
I expect to find interesting voices in the groups 
of negro workers on the steamboats on which I travel, 
as well as among the negro roust-a-bouts at the 
places where we stop en route.

I again assure you of my deep appreciation 
of  your courtesy and kindness during my stay 
in Washington.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax,
John A. Lomax.
