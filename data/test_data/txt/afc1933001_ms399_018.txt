Elmo Newcomer's Dance Calls--- b

(First Figure)

Pardners to their places
Like mules to their tra ces
Put your hands in your pockets
Turn your backs to the wall
Take a chew of tobacco
And balance all
Swing your pardners
Corners all
Now your pardners
And promenade [aaa] hall

First couple out to the couple
on the right, and round up four.

Elbow hug and Chinese swing
Sandhill twist and a double swing
On to the next and the next 
couple fellow

(Note: repeat clear around till the
last couple has finished)

Balance all
Swing your corner and swing it
with[a] a smile
Grab your honey and go hog wild

---------

(Second Figure)

Everybody dance asspretty as you can
Swing your corner with your right hand
Pardner with your wrong
Grant right and wrong all night long
Watch your pardner, watch her close
When you meet her, double the dose
Hang your dogs and kill your cats
And double the do sew with rrufff onrats".

Lawd, Lawd ain't we got fun?

Dance up, boys, and don't be slow
All these girls and r'arin' to go
All you gals who don't wear socks
Shake your hipa and rattle your hocks

Meet your honey and promenade home

(Third Figure)

Swing on the corner like swingin' on a gate
Now your honey and pull your freight
First couple out the couple on the right
Lady around the lady and gents so low
Lady around the gent and the gent don't go
Swing with your right and now your wrong
Docy ladies all night long
On to the next, chase the possum, chase the squirrel
Chase that pretty girl around the world
Ladies docy, gents cut a shine
Swing your sweetheart and I'll swing mine
On to the next and the next couple follow
Chase the possum, chase the skunk,
Chase that pretty girl around the chunk
Ladies docy and gents go gee
Swing that pretty girl and then swing me

(And so on until the last couple has gone around)

Everybody dance
Swing your pardner and p romenade
the hall for the last time.
