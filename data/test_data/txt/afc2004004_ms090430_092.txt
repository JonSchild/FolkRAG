and the servant group are the only classes of employment which have shown
any noticeable increase.

A distribution of occupations of rural Negro workers, made on the
basis of a study of rural Negro families in Davidson County, (1) shows that 31.6
per cent of the family heads are engaged as domestic servants, 4.0 per cent
as skilled workers and foremen, 7.2 per cent as semi-skilled workers and
20.1 per cent as unskilled workers.

Education

Public education for Negroes in Davidson County was begun 70
years ago, but opportunities, despite recent developments, are still below
standard. There are 91 schools in the county, 54 of which are for white
children and 37 for Negroes. Twenty of the 37 Negro schools are of the one-
teacher type, whereas only 4 of the 54 schools for white children are of
this type. Of the two-teacher schools, 8 are for Negroes and 6 for whites.
The preponderance of white schools is to be found in the three or more
teacher types; the preponderance of Negro schools is in the one-teacher
type. (2) About 20 per cent of the white teachers are college graduates. Ten
per cent of the Negro teachers likewise have collegiate degrees. For the
year 1937 there were no Negroes employed in the rural school system who had
an advanced degree or a year or more of graduate work to his credit. (3) Salaries
for Negro teachers are only about half of that paid to white teachers in
both elementary and secondary schools. The average salary paid white men
teachers is $136.30 mostly; Negro men receive $60.00; white women teachers
average $102.14 per month and Negro women teachers $53.40. (4)
