Pals working at Brooklyn Cooperage.  Wanted to be with the
bunch,  to be ambitious after leaving the strawberry farm.
(This was at the age of 15)  Made from $2.50 to $3.00 a week.
Put nails on the sugar abrrels, paid 25 cents 100 barrels.
This was in New Orleans.

After my trips I came either to my god-mother or grand-mother.
Whatever happens in a family, all you have to do is take some

Eddie Hunter,  god-mother's second husband.  Had two sons,  Eddie
and Morris.  Eddie was the fightingest sone of a gun I ever seen.

Married a prosperous man who was a good butcher.  He tried to
get me to come into the markets at four or five o'clock in the
morning, but I wouldn't go.

In New Orleans, thought somebody did some black magic to me and
I was referred to Sona.  In this case it happened that I was sick
and they needed a pianist but they didn't ask me.  He walked into
