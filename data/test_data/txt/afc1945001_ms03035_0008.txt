Not a rumor, but a bitter complaint which the Government might
well take cognizance of, comes to us from hundreds of people who have
visited this office recently in connection with the certain discretionary
powers granted employers in hiring, without birth certificates, certain
skilled men.
Unfortunately this easement was widely misinterpreted. It
intensified discontent. Most people merely read into it a chance to go
before some tribunal and get the long sought birth certificate. No matter
whose fault it was, the ruling provoked a great deal of ill feeling which
revealed itself in this office in hundreds of cases in the remark:
"This is a pretty country. Here I am, born here and just
unlucky enough to have been born in a jay community where they didn't
bother to register births, and I can't get a job, and I knowhundreds of 
persons who are not Americans who HAVE jobs in those same plants."
