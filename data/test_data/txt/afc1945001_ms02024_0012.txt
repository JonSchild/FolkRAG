Dear Miss Barker:- 

So far as I know, the only talk 
I have heard that might be called rumor, during the 
week, is this from a young man from Florida, who was 
in Atlanta seeing if he could arrange to get into the 
service.  In substance he said: 

Germany has 100,000 men in Argentina 
who can be called into service in a few hours when the 
time comes to move against this country.  

Sincerely, 
W. B. S.
