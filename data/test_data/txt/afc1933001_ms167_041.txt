Captain Hardison
Naval Air Base
Anacostia, D.C.

Dear Captain Hardison:

Everyone who heard the program Monday
night was very enthusiastic about it. I've just
received a charming letter from Mrs. Roosevelt,
herself, expressing her appreciation for it. I
hope that it will mean, in the end, more music
recreation for enlisted men in the military services.

Thank you for your personal kindness
to me and for your help in making this evening
a successful one.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
