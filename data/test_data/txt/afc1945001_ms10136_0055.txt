I  There was a young boy who went into the 
Army, he was just about 21 years of age. One 
morning he awakened and found that the 
clouds seemed to have burst. He looked around 
and seemed in dismay, he didn't know really 
what to do. He walked up to the Colonel and 
said, Is it permissable to use an umbrella 
today, sir?

II  Let's shoot the Japs for craps
Let's shoot the Japs for craps
Let's cut 'em, shoot 'em
Knock 'em in the head, and 
boot, boot, boot 'em
Let's shoot the Japs for craps

III  Sh--ee e, don't talk to loud, sh-h-h don't laugh to loud, 
sh-ee e, don't shout to loud, 'cause a slip of the lips 
might sink a ship. 

IV  Everyone says "remember Pearl Harbor", but don't forget 
the Japs, they were their too.
