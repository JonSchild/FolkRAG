Wednesday

Dear Alan,

Your father dictated his
letter to me. He had a pretty
bad spell of pain today
following a day of gloom
yesterday. I don't know whether
despondency brings on the pain
or simply is part of the
symptoms. Dr. Kindley says
the pains are due to the 
hardening of the arteries which
too much fat has caused to
work too hard. This is the
first bad spell for a month.
Your father has cut down on
his food somewhat, as to quantity
and fat content: he hasn't been
bad for sweets since I've known
him. He is easier now (mid-
afternoon), though he had me
frightened this morning

We were glad to know that
Bess is with you for a while -
and I hope she and Shirley and Patsy
