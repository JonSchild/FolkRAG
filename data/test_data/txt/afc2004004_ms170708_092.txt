10.
Who should I see there but one of my shipmates,
Wrapped in a blanket, far colder than clay.

He asked for a blanket to wrap round his head,
Likewise a candle to light him to bed;
His poor heart was breakin', his poor head was achin',
For he's a young soldier cut down in his prime.

We'll beat the big drums an' we'll play the pipes merrily,
Play the dead march as we carry him along.
Take him to the churchyard an' fire three volleys o'er him,
For he's a young sailor cut down in his prime.

At the corner of the street you will see two girls standin',
One to the other did whisper an' say,
"Here comes a young sailor whose money we've squandered,
Here comes a young sailor cut down in his prime."

His kind-hearted mother, his (hesitates) kind-hearted father,
Both of them warned him about his past life;
For along with the flash girls he would wander,
Along with the flash girls, I was his delight.
There's another verse I think. That's the tune. I can't
remember it.
(various mumbles)
Lomax: They want the Oyster Girl, Harry.
