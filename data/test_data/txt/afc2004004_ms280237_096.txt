So up jumped the herrin', the queen of the sea,
He sang out, "Old skipper, O you can't catch me."
In this stormy old weather, windy old weather,
When the wind blow we all pull together.

Up jumped the mack'rel, with spots on his back,
He sang out, "Old skipper, you're on your own track."
In this stormy old weather, windy old weather,

He sang out, "Old skipper, you'll run her ashore."
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather,

He sang out, "Old skpper come square your main tack."
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather,
When the wind blow we'll all pull together.
