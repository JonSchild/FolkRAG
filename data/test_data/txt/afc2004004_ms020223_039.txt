way, see?  We really in union together.  But there will be some,
ya know, will look will look at self.  I'm talkin' about self, you know,
like Mary was that time when, ah, when the Lawd, ah, went
to this, this home in, in this ah, in this ah, this woman jus'
kep' on fixin' an' preparin' good things in the kitchen, ya
know, for 'er.  An' this ah, other, other one, she didn't -- she
still stood around there an' talked to Him.  An' then, after a
while, He -- the lady come to the door an' asked Jesus, 
Her Master, would You 'scuse her an' let her come an' help me.
An' He tol' 'er, said, "She has done the good part."  Said, "She
choose the best part."  See?  The best part of it ya see, is servin' God.
But she was in there on self, fixin' this dicty an' pride, ya
pride.  Pride what turn out all things, ya know, from God.  An'
so, that's what -- Jus' some of 'em be in the Church that way;
they be lookin' at ya.
     I notice [that] when some come down sometime to bow.  We ask
'em, "Y'all please come an' bow," ya see.  There's no harm [in] to
bow, ya see.  We jus' -- Some time ya have to fo'ce an' beg 'em,
ya know, like that.  An' so, an', "Come an' bow," ya know.  An'
they jus' don' wanna be pray for; jus' bow in honor; just show
honor an' respect to God.  An' so, some of 'em will come an' bow.
They got on a pretty dress an', boy, you see 'em puttin' them
dresses out an' gettin', you know, so it, so it, so it won't get
dirty!  Ya know.  Hah!  Don't none of it [git] gi' to 'em.  They ain't got sense
enough to know that God don't wanna give 'em that dress, he'll
give 'em more.  Ya see, an' they ain' got sense enough to realize
that, ya know.
