Dear Dr. Spivacke:

We have recently made a rather revolutionary
advance in our amplifiers which permits us to make our large
equipment exactly as good in quality but decreasing the weight
tremendously.

The weight of the amplifier-speaker case
is cut to 30lbs. and is lightly smaller. The recording turntable
case is cut to 35lbs. Instead of two interconnecting cables between
cases there is only one.  For field use this seems like a decided
advance since the quality of the big machine is retained.  There
is no change in price since our costs are not materically affected.

This information is being passed on in advance of
actual production of these units since we still, to be frank, have
half a dozen of the standard type which will be displaced by this
new type exactly the same in appearance and size but about half as
heavy.

I am going on a southern trip which will take me
through Washington Jan. 17. If you have an interest in seeing this
outfit, I can demonstrate it to you then.  We have had work under
way along these lines for a long time but were never able to get
quality until a couple of weeks ago.  Since then we have put the prin-
ciple to thorough test and it seems perfectly sound and straight-
forward.

Sincerely yours,
Lincoln Thompson
