A                                       Joke
A group of soldiers were conversing happily
about certain places that they intend to go on their
night off. A sergeant upon approaching the
men asked if any of them were good at shorthand. 
Five of the men believing that all they
had to do was take down dictation answered
that they were very good at it. The sergeant beamed
and said "all right boys. come on, the cook
is shorthanded on dishwashers and you boys
seem to be anxious to help out."
