job and new shock absorbers. Â£40
& new tires to come.
Cut tapes this afternoon.
Fell in love with S. Ennis piping
again.
Telegram from R's folks - 
Come on home for operation. She
 asked me what I thought &
I urged her to go, explaining
quietly & calmly that I didn't
feel that she loved me & wanted 
me very much & that I felt
I was being wronged in staying & would 
leave before too long. She seemed
sad but, as usual, said nothing.
Told me that she didn't feel that
I really liked her - this is
always what E. said. Perhaps
this is the feeling I always give
- or perhaps they are alike.
Anyhow I am confident & calm
& serene somehow. 
Have faced my trouble a bit.
