MRS. DAVIS:
(TO LOW TO HEAR)
LARRY:
My wine!
MRS. DAVIS:
That's right. You should have had a guitar long before
you did.
LARRY:
Right, I was buying my wine and I just couldn't get my
guitar and then that one day I was walking down 7th Avenue
and found a guitar and then begin.
MRS. DAVIS & LARRY JOHNSON AT HUNTINGTON
MRS. DAVIS:
I think he did cherish his Gibson.
LARRY:
I think I only played that guitar man, I was when he
picked it up it was panting for him. I don't think I really
ever played it. I never really wanted to because I knowed in
myself how much it meant to him and I just and it was another
thing about me keep trying to play one of his songs. Like I said I never
could, he was so good I always admired him so I didn't even,
a lot of his songs I didn't even attempt to play, I just
don't feel I would do it justice you know, and he played it so 
well.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well, anyway, after he wrote a letter asking if he would
sell Gibson, he'd come and get it, and I would never sell it.
