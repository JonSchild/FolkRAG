We have to learn how to take care of ourselves in all things.  Because
there are somethings you can have behind closed doors won't do for the doors
to be opened to have these things get out.
But when anybody come to me to teach them things (blues) I teach them
anything they want to know.  My place when they pay me to teach them.
Than after that's over there ain't no more about that for me.
I'm subject to mistakes.  All of us are.  Sometimes you think you're going East and
you're going West.  That's the way it happens with all of us sometimes.
Mistakes is the best stop in life.  You know too much
you understand, than you done made a mistake already.
You be too perfect than the mistakes have already made.  But you go try
to do a thing and make a mistake to start off with than that's the
best start in life.  It gives somebody a chance to correct you.
You can go on a job and know too much about that job a the mean will not
hire you.  'fore he sees that you know too much for him to tell you.  You'd 
be hard headed on that job.  HE's put you down and take somebody who knows
nothing.  And they always get the job.  That's right.
