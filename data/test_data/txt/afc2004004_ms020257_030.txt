BJ  TAPE 43, p. 28

AL:  Do you mean we started out as lepers?  cheaters and swindlers?
BJ:  Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
AL:  That's a hard line. . .
BJ:  Yeah, a hard line, eh?  No, ya go ta git harder than the
God say, "You."  He, He got some of the greatest Christians
among white folks you most ever seed.
He say, "I ain't got no Heaven for ya."  That what -- We had
a big discussion about that once in the church."   ?   A
rich man?"
     I say, "All white folks ain't rich."  I say, "Some of us,
some of us settin' here right now, is rich.  Completely rich!"
Ya know?  Ya can be rich without a dime!  An' you can be poor
with all the money you got.  It's in ya heart; that's what it
is, and in spirit.  I got this here, ah, ah, I got on a black
dress an' you ain't got nary a one to put on.  Just, like you
say a while ago, high-sholder; "I'm better'n you; I can spend
more money'n you; an' I can do this an' I can do the other'n.
An' then, anything I point my finger at, I can git it.  I can
do this-that-an'-the-other'n."  It ain't the, the money, the
natchul money that you got.  It's 'cordin' to how you count
it.  Now, He says, "the lover of money, is the root of evil."
Not the money.  You see.  If you love that money so much [till] until
you think that hit's too good for anybody else, but then I
shouldn't have it an' nobody else shouldn't have it but you,
an' you'll kill me about my money, see?  You just as soon see
me dead, rather see me dead than give me money.  Then you love
it, you really love it.  You go in that bank an' you take an'
you back out there an' take a chance with' your own life an'
even the next (girl ?) life, with that you didn't make.  See.
