table we git th at; i f there wasn't, we git what they
give us.  That's the way we r aised.  I know lots of times
my grandmoth er used to go to church an bring back a gan g
of preach ers an eat up the best food.  The rest of the
children would be skeered to ask for it.  I wouldn't.
I'd git to the table, I'd call out "Maw" - I called
her Maw all the time -- I'd say, "Maw, I'll thank you
fer some chicken!" (he laugh s)  It always would make me
m ad fer anybody to gi ve me t his answer, "Eat wh at
befo you," an I'd go to cuttin up.  (What would your 
m eals consist of usually?)  We-l-l-l -- whatever they'd
give us.  Ef it would be cornbread and cabbages, it would
be that.  An ef it be butter an bread, we git that.
Ef it be butter, molasses an bread, we git th at.  Ef it
be bread an milk, we git th at. That's all.  Company
always generally git th e best of the food.
     So far a I know, according to the statement of
m y gr andmother, I taken the sore eyes when I was three
weeks old.  An th e doctors put something in my eyes
cause ulcers to grow over my eyes an cause m e to go
blind.  (Could you have anything done abou t your eye es?)
No, I don't h ardly think that I could.  Accor ding to 
the statement of the doctor, the older I git, I migh t
overcome it.  Then he said I might not n ever overcome
it.  (Do you recall, as a child, when you first discovered
th at oth er people could see and you could not
see?)  Only time I'd think about that, you understand.
