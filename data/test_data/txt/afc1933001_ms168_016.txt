APPLICATION FOR LEAVE

Write your name very distinctly in the space at the top of Card "A."
Number your applications consecutively, i.e., the first "No. 1", the
second "No. 2", etc. This is important.

Strike out the kind of leave not desired. Make plain figures. Submit
all applications to the Chief of your Division, who will forward
them with or without his approval.

Do not write on Cards "B" and "C." Card "B" will be numbered
to agree with Card "A" and returned to you. It should be preserved
for record.

Write the word sick in upper left-hand corner of card when the
absence is because of illness. A certificate of illness should accompany
every card so marked. The certificate must be signed by a physician
(1) whenever absence because of illness exceeds a period of three consecutive
days, (2) WHENEVER THE EMPLOYEE HAS NOT BEEN CONFINED
TO THE HOUSE.
