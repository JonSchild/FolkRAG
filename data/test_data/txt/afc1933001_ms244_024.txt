Dear Father:

Quotation from a letter just received from Burl Ives:
(except for the profanity addressed to the Columbia Broadcasting
Company):

"I told them to call up CBS for the sources of the songs
which I recorded. They evidently did not do this, because they
called me up and asked me where I learned these particular
songs. I told them I learned them from you, so if they made
this mistake it is their own fault."

I have written Burl that I feel he has an obligation to
follow the matter up. I will also write a hot letter to some
of my friends at Columbia and let you know the result.

The recording machine, along with forty records, will be
shipped to you today. I know this trip will be a fruitful
one. I suggest that on your way over you stop by San Antonio
and see a fiddler that Railroad Smith has found there, one of
the best I ever heard. He will take some talking to before
he will record for you, so perhaps you'd better write Railroad,
who is his lawyer, right away and get him to get in touch with
the man. If you can guarantee that the records will be acoustically
perfect, an evening of the best huapangoes and corridos in
San Antonio would be fine; but no more than that, because Brownie
McNeil is going to dorour corrido job for us, I think, very
thoroughly. Don't forget the little lady near Comanche. I will
write Irene Whitfield and ask her whether there are any existing
singers around Lafayette that you might spend an evening with
on the way over. I will try to get an answer out of her in time
to reach you before you leave Dallas.

I hope on this trip that with each informant you record a
little of their life history so that if we plan to use the
material on the air we will have a background of speech. If you
just record your own interviews with the people it would be what
we want. I am going to get Jerry to write you some hardbitten
words about recording quality, because there is no reason that
