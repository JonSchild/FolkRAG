II. Heard August 10, 1942 at New Rochelle, New York.

A soldier friend of mine has written me about his army
life out west. It seems he is being trained for desert warfare.
They are supposed to do everything in the way of war 
fighting in the open sun, in tanks, jeeps, etc. And the temperature
there in those California deserts runs as high as
115. It is hotter there than in Egypt, and he tells me it's
pretty tough going but they are being trained right. I guess 
his unit will be sent overseas to Egypt or Asia soon. [*1*]
