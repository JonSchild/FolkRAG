Reel 82, Tues. Evening - St. Simons Island. Ga.

LIL' DAVID
A spiritual

CHORUS:
Lil' David, play on your harp,
Hallelu, hallelujah,
Lil' David, play on your harp,
Hallelu!

Lil' David was a shepherd boy,
He killed Goliath with a shout for joy.     (CHORUS)

Lil' David's harp had a hundred strings,
Every one string had a golden ring.         (CHORUS)

I told you once, I told you twice,
There are sinners in hell for shootin' dice.  (CHORUS)

I told you once, gonna tell you again,
You won't get to heaven in your sin.         (CHORUS)

If you don't believe I been redeemed,
Follow me on down by the Jerden stream.  (CHORUS 2)

We got mothers gone and fathers, too,
The              declared our days are few.   (CHORUS)
