You three times seven an' you know what you want to do."

Lead Belly Speaks:
He commence a-jivin' Alberta,

"I ain' never loved (anybody) babe,
I ain' never loved (anybody) babe,
How in de worl' you think I should (you)?
De women these days don' mean no one man no good."

"They'll spen' yo' money,
They'll spen' yo' money,
I swear to God, Lawd, they'll soak yo' clo's,
Git mad wid you an' chunk yo' truck outdo's."

"What makes an' ol' lady,
What makes an' ol' lady,
So crazy 'bout a right young man?
'Cause she know she can take him an' raise him to her han'."

I got a new way o' spellin',
I got a new way o' spellin',
O Memphu--uh-us, Tennessee, --
Double e, double t, Lawd, double n, x y z. *"

Lead Belly Speaks:
This here's de las' word he said to Alberta,

Lead Belly Sings:
"Take me, Alberta,
Take me, Alberta,
Set me down on yo' rockin' cheer,
If the blues overtake me, I can rock on away f'om here."

[*In our experience this is] *One of the
most popular of blues stanzas. The last
stanza, too, is common.
