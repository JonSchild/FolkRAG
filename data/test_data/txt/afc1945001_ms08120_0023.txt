The Russians have swept from victory
to victory, over the Germans.  They 
have re-captured Karkov and Rostov.  There
seems to be a rumor afloat saying, "Russia
wants all of the Baltic states after the war, 
and thinking nothing about what her allies
may want."   Does this mean that Russia
is out of line with her allies?  Russia had these
Baltic states before the last world war.  There 
is something mysterious about why Stalin didn't
go to the conference with Churchill and Roosevelt
at Casablanca.  Russia has a peace pact with
Japan that is probaby the reason.  There seems
to be an Atlantic Charter saying that none of
The United Nations are seeking to aqquire territory,
but Russia is - This is bad propaganda.  It
plays right into Hitlers arms.
     It seems that China is hungry for some help 
from the United States, which is being done
by scientific developments.  The Library of 
Congress is microfilming - different articles and
sending the photographs to China.  One hundred
feet of film weighs less than one pound.  Libraries
like these are to be set up in Chentu and
Kunming in China.
