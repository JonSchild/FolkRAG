Rumors
Rumors are one enemy of war.
Many mothers and fathers
get letters from their
sons and tell everybody
where they are. That is a 
way in which to let the
enemy know where ships
are and when there leaving.
There may even be a spie
or traitor right among
your own crowd. So when
you get notice from your sons
or brothers don't tell anyone
where they are, or when they 
leave. Some people hear or
see things and then tell
the next persons and it 
goes on and all it is nothing
but somebodys imagination,
so remember "A slip of the lip
Might Sink a Ship."
