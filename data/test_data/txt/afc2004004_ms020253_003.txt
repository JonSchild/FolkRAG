TL:  What's that, you got white hair?

BJ:  Hit turns white and then it turns back black.

TL:  It turns black again?

BJ:  Yeah, right back again.  Every time I think it's gettin' pretty --
I love grey hair, but, see, all the time, when you see your hair look
white up in the top here, that ain't grey hair; that's white hair.
Just turns that way.  Tha's white hair.  So the peoples say it's a
lucky person, real good luck, successful.

TL:  If your hair is white, then?

BJ:  Hit jus' turns, up in the top.

TL:  It turns white?

BJ:  An' then hit'll turn back, but --

TL:  I never heard of it turning dark, though.

BJ:  It does ["does" underscored].

TL:  Does that happen to a lot of people you know?

BJ:  I don't know, but Mama says it's that way on my father's side.
Says it [strike through "just"] turns, the hair turns.  An' when you get grey, it
starts here, starts on the edge.  Then you gettin' grey.  An' long
as you see that white up there in the top -- I was lookin' at it the other 
day when you was fixin it -- as long as you see that white in the 
top, tha's just a lucky streak.  My husband was -- when I was 29 
years old we married -- my husban' have just white, white all 'bout.
Then sometime you look at it again an' it kinda darkish brown, gettin'
back again.  And mine turned white ["white" underscored].  My mother got a white patch
right up on the top, over her right eye, up there.  It's the 
prettiest thing you 'most ever seen.  Now her hair's grey, 'most
all over, ya know, near about, but a few black places.  But that
white is diffrunt -- it's silkish, right silk white.  An' it's a
pretty thing.  I'm tellin' you, tha's pretty!
