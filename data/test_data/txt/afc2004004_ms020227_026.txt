BJ TAPE 12, p. 24

AL:  He was a gambling man?

BJ:  He was a gambling man, bully man, you know, an' everything.  Great gambler.  An' he wo' (wore) some clothes!  That why they call 'im Few Clothes.  'Cause they, 'cause they had a word about it, you know, "That man wears a few clothes!"  That mean he wear anything he want, you know.  He's a real dresser; that why they call him Few Clothes.  He, he, he sure was.  I'm tellin' ya.

An' so that was a reg'lar warnin' to me to leave those peoples alone.  An' I left 'em alone.  I jus' had to come out boldly an' tell 'em.

That's what -- ah, a lot a things what now, that man was talkin' the other day in the church:  You have to pull out an' leave things sometimes, that you know is dangerous.  The Lawd say, "If your right eye offen' ya," you know, "Pluck it out.  If your right hand, cut it off," you know.  You know, that means, say, don't care how close it is to ya, how good it is fer ya, an', you know, it mean you man be takin' care me.  But if you offen' me, I'd best let ya alone.  That's right.  So they was really offendin' me, very bad, ya know?  Much bad, hah?  Ha, ha, ha!  I'm tellin' ya!

AL:  You don't remember the tune of the Polk County Blues by any chance, do you?

BJ:  Um, no...

AL:  I've never heard the song; I've just heard about it.

BJ:  I've heard... I know... I cain't remember, jes', jes' know "Polk County."  I know they sing... It's jus' like all them rags, I suppose.  Know they say, "Nobody know Polk County like I do," tha's all.  Or sumpin' that way.  It goes that way: "I done searched Polk County through an' through."  That's all I know
