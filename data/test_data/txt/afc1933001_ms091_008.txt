Denison Texas. Wed.
Kind Friend got the book today and
will take good care of it and return
it to you. Have been fracturing some
from the papers I had. She [?] sure
laugh at me. Have to raise the
roof to get any old time squall to it.
Have done any hollering and c[???]
driving for some time and will
have to get the tickle and cough
out of my throat. Will write to
some friends in Arizona about
some old times. Will come by
some weekend soon. Might
be in Dallas this weekend.
Got to sell some more fruit trees. Sears
Roebuck used lots last year. Henry Stephens
