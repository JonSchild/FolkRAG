Homesteads - on the wall - 
the Roman wall -

Slept with S last night.
She said, "It's been a long long
time since anyone was interested in
sleeping with me." I kept thinking
about Robin, in bed with someone else.
Kept knowing the old sorrow, but
now a little less bitter, a few miles 
away and nearly over. It was 1/2
an artificial feeling & the real 
joy & real pain are ahead and
I am only sorry I'm tired &
sort of old feeling in advance.

We stayed in the Hadrian Hotel.
Nice. Traveling salesman & a foreign
looking steeplechase salesman in
the bar. Up at 10:30, make apts
in London by long distance. 
Rather im with I for living
