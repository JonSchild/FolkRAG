Um------,
Cho.You Better come on in my kitchen,
It's gonna be rainin' out do's.
When a woman get in trouble,
Ev'body throws her down,
Lookin' for yo' good friend,
An' can't be found, Cho.
The woman I love,
took away my best friend,
Some jumper got lucky,
Stole her back again, Cho.
Mama, can't you hear that wind howlin'?
Oh, how the wind do howl.
Cho.
The woman that I love,
I crave to see,
She's up the country
Won't write to me.
But she'd better, etc..
I went to de mountain,
Fur as my eyes could see
Some other man got my woman,
Lonesome blues got me,
But she'd better, etc..
My mama dead
Papa way up the
Ain't got nobody
To love an' care for me.
