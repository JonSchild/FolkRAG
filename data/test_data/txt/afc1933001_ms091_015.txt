Before answering questions on the reverse side of this page, the applicant should read chapters IV and V of the Tire Rationing
Regulations carefully. Unless the applicant qualifies under the requirements of these chapters, his application cannot receive
favorable consideration.
Due to the critical shortage of rubber available for the manufacture of recapping materials, only an extremely small number
of tires can be retreaded or recapped. Many important needs will have to go unsatisfied. The burden of establishing need
rests on the applicant.
Questions should be answered carefully and fully. The applicant should be certain that he has presented every reason that
justifies his use of the vital rubber supply of our country.
A List B applicant should point out particularly why he cannot obtain other means of transportation, and in what way his
use of the tires will further the war effort. He may include with this application, letters or documents which help to establish
his need for tires and the importance to the war effort of his obtaining transportation.
