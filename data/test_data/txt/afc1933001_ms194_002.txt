Dear Duncan,

The attached is for you.... Father [ xxx ] tells about the time 
he got a letter from a lady asking for a report of all the
songs found along highway 101.  She was to read a paper at
her club... Seriously, though, a [ zzzz ] mimeographed speech of
yours could get a hell of a circulation in women's clubs and
school essays if it was ready to send out in reply to the
scores of letters like this that come in....

Sorry I didn't get to see you when I as in
Washington a few weeks ago. It was a matter of running in by  plane
singing for this doggone benefit until two in the morning and catching
the eight o'clock plane back... Don't you treat me that way
on your trips to New York....Where in hell's Jelly Roll?..
