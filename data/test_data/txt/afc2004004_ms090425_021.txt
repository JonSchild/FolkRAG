Fisk, 20. 6.

Two angels came from Heaven
And rode that song away
Tow angels came from Heaven,
and rode that song away;
And the Lord will carry
My spirit home.

He rose, He rose, He rose, He rose,
He rose from the dead.  He rose, He rose, He rose, He rose,
He rose from the dead.
He rose, He rose, He rose, He rose,
He rose from the dead.
He rose, He rose, He rose, He rose, He rose from the dead;
And the Lord will carry my spirit home.
A long time ago.

Oh, I know my name be written in the Kingdom, Hallelu, hallelu.

Oh, I know my name is signed by the angels, Hallelu, hallelu.
