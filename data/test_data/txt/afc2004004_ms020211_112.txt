My God Is a Rock in the Weary Land

Chorus: My God is a rock in the weary land, weary land, in the weary land,
             My God is a rock in the weary land,
             Shelter in the time of the storm.

Well, you go 'way, you long-tongued liar, oh yeah,
We don't want you headin' this band, oh yeah,
Well, we don't want none but the true born souls,
That was washed in the blood of the Lamb.

Repeat chorus:  My God is a rock in the weary land, etc.

Well, stop and let me tell you 'bout the Chapter One,
The Lord God's work had just begun.
[*? Check*]
Well, stop and let me tell you 'bout Chapter Two,
[The Lord God] The God's gon' keep his eye on you
Well, stop and let me tell you 'bout Chapter Three,
The Lord God dies on Calvary.

Repeat Chorus: [My God is] And I know He's a rock in the weary land, etc.

Well, stop and let me tell you 'bout the Chapter Four,
[*OK*] The Lord God visit among the poor.

Well, stop and let me tell you 'bout the Chapter Five,
The Lord God brought those dead, alive
