OFFICE OF THE REGIMENTAL COMMANDER
FORT SILL, OKLAHOMA

12 February, 1941.

Colonel I. Spalding, G. S. C.,
War Departmetn,
(Miscellaneous Branch)

Dear Ike:

Your letter of the 6th reference army songs arrived this
morning.

We have only the Vagabond Song (or The 3-4-9 Song), Tavern in 
the Town (Parody), Hallelujah, Ain't Gonna Study War No 'mo - to contribute
and these are attached hereto.

Our men sing on all occasions - on the march - in barracks -
in church - and at various clubs - including, Hunt - Rotary - Lions etc.
But unfortunately they have no romantic military background which could
be a surprise for originality. They love the Caisson Song - The Red Guidon -
and The Mountain Battery, but lean much to Colored Spirituals - such as
the ones attached.

The Regiment is rolling along beautifully - but we do need some
help along recreational lines - A Post Exchange - and a Hostess House.
These projects I believe are awaiting action in Washington. Our movie
theatre is filled at every show.

With best regards, I am

Sincerely yours,
A. L. P. SANDS,
Col., 349th F. A.
