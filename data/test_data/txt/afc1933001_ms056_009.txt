of me came to you because I am not a technically trained musician. While I recognize the reasonableness of this point of view, I want to show you that I have other qualities partly compensatory. Something, too, you could show the Librarian should he again, for any reason, become disturbed about me. You certainly have always given me evidence of your friendship and confidence. In Alan, too, for that matter

I can at least promise to quit sending you so many letters to decipher. We are quite ready to start when the machine comes. Miss Terrill and I both hope Mrs. Spivocke will soon be well. Giver her our love

Sincerely
John A. Lomax
