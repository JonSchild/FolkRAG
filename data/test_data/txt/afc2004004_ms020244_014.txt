SOME OF THESE DAYS
A spiritual

I'm gonna eat at the welcome table,
I'm gonna eat at the welcome table some of these days,
(God knows that) I'm gonna eat at the welcome table,
I'm gonna eat at the welcome table some of these days.

God is gonna stop these long-tongued liars, etc.

God is gonna bring your sin before you, etc.

I'm gonna tell Him all about my trouble, etc.

I'm gonna tell God how you treat me, etc.

God is gonna set this world on fire, etc.

I'm going home to live with Jesus, etc.
