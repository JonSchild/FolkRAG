Dear Mr. Lomax:

You have already given me permission
to use any of your ballads in the high
school anthologies I am preparing for the
Macmillan Company, and have indicated
that the fee for each will be $10. Now
I come back asking for permission to reprint
in the American Literature volume
your chapter entitled "Cowboy Songs," from
Cowboy Songs and Frontier Ballads published
by Sturgis and Walton. Will you
please indicate what fee you would expect
for this item?

The publication of the books has
been delayed two or three times, but now
the Company expects to get them out soon
after January 1, 1943, depending somewhat
upon war conditions and the paper market.

Very cordially yours,
[* E. A. Cross *]
