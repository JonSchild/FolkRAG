remember me as the person to whom both
you and Mrs. Lomax were as kind
as to write in the summer of 1935,
on seeing the little article I wrote for
the National Altrusa magazine on folk-
songs.  I owe you an abject apology for
not answering your second letter.  My
mother became more ill and died shortly
afterward.

Last summer I spent in England, reading
Cecil Sharp's books in the library of the Cecil
Sharp House, and attending the summer
season of the English Folk Dance & Folk Song
Society in Stratford.

It looks now as if I will reach Washington
(driving) by July 5th.  Since I don't
know any place in Washington except the
Wardman-Park Hotel, that had best be my
address for that week - at any rate.
You may rest assured I shall try
not to be a nuisance to you -
but there is nothing of interest there
