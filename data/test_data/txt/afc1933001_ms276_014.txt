Proposed statement:

PROMOTION POLICY
of the
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS

It having been represented to the Librarian by Library of Congress
Union, Local No. 28, United Federal Workers of America, that
the members of that Local desire a clarifying reiteration of policy
relative to promotions, the following statement is submitted for
the guidance of all concerned:

It will be the continued policy of the Librarian to fill
vacancies and newly-created positions by promotions from within
the staff. In the future, the principles enumerated below
will underlie the execution of this policy:

(1) Notice of any vacancy will be posted in every division
for a period of at least seven days, during which time
any employee of the Library may submit an application
for the position.

(2) Vacant positions in any particular division of the Library
will be filled from within that division, whereever
the qualifications of subordinate employees make
it possible; where not, equal consideration will be
accorded applicants from every other division of the
Library.

(3) In every case where applications for any vacancy have
been received from within the Library Service and where
the Librarian then intends to appoint from without,
notice -- together with the names of Library Service applicants
-- will be given to the Library Union, Local
No. 28, U.F.W.A.; and no such appointment will be made
within three days after notice has been conveyed to
the said Union.

In giving effect to the principles of this policy, no action
will be taken inconsistent with the Rules and Regulations
of the Civil Service Commission, insofar as they now are applied
to the Library.

By direction of the Librarian.

To date no reply has been received from the Librarian.
