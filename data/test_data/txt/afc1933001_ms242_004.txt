Dear Father:

Your trip with Mrs. Tartt has been approved and the only reason we could not make it include the Amarillo jaunt is that there is no machine available in the Division except the one I am about to take with me today to Mississippi where I shall be for about ten days recording revivals.

Doctor Spivacke is scheduled to write you as soon as your trip with Mrs. Tartt has passed the last hurdle. Your machine should be on its way to you in a week or ten days. If you can arrange through Owens or the Dean of Extension to use the Owens machine for the trip, I think we can handle the expenses. I am terribly sorry that it was too late to do anything else, but there was simply no other machine available

Very truly yours,

AL a                     Alan Lomax
