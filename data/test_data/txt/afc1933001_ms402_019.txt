NEGRO SPIRITUALS

     Usually only subjects of grave scholastic moment are discussed
before the Modern Language Association. Here is found academic
tion, academic precision, academic safeness, to a depressing degree.
Any appeal to the emotions is as rare as rare as showers of rain in 
the Sahara Desert. I had felt timid and fearful at bringing before
this body a simple recital of examples of literary beauty without
any attempt at cataloguing or dissecting them. My reading under
these circumstances must have been clumsy and ineffective. I recall
that my embarrassment was so great I hardly lifted my eyes from the 
paper. My surprise and pleasure was complete when the papers was 
greeted with hearty applause from listeners, many of whom were in 
tears. Among those who came forward to congratulate me were two 
publishers' agents who wished to issue a small de lux volumns containing
the text of the lecture. But I wished to save it for future 
platform trials. Since then I have repeated its text probably a 
hundred times before college audiences.
