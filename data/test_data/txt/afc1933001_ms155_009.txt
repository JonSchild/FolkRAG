Educating the Sharecroppers

Here are a people who are the seeds of the "Grapes of Wrath", living from the hunger incomes of cotton in Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana and Alabama - the sharecroppers, tenant farmers and pickers.

Negro agricultural workers have never had a school like this where they could learn the ABC of administrative agencies and legislation affecting their conditions and lives. How to run their locals, get their benefit checks, improve their contracts - these will be subjects for study courses at the UCAPAWA Cotton Sharecroppers' School.

UCAPAWA is bringing schools to the fields to face the needs of the field workers in cotton, sugar beets, fruits and vegetable crops.

There is a clamor from the fields for workers' education. Contributions from friends of the field workers will make the     beet labor and the sharecroppers schools a reality.

Help us bring schools to the fields, send your contribution to UCAPAWA's FIELD WORKERS SCHOOL FUND.
