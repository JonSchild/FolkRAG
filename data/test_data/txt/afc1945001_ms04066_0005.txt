"I saw two Jap kids about 20 years old in a car stopped at a gas
station out here near Bountiful at midnight the other night. There was
something wrong with their car and they were fixing it. The attendant
wasn't helping them, but it was midnight and they had no business being
out on the highway that time of night." Salt Lake City, Utah. 8-4 (21)
