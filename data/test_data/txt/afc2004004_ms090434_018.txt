HOME AGENT NOTES
GIVES CARE CHICKENS-
"Birds to be slaughtered
should be kept without food for
24 hours to empty the crop
completely, and to empty to a 
large extent the intestines."
says Miss Eudie Kavannaugh,
Home demonstration agent.
"Cleaning in this way is made
much easier, particularly where
the bird is left whole for roasting.
Regardless of the method 
of killing, the bird should be
suspended with head down to
insure maximum bleeding.
"Most birds killed on the 
farm are dressed by the scald methods.
Scald picking calls for
water 190 degrees Farenheit.
Birds should be held in water
15 seconds. This high temperature
makes it hard to pick a bird
clean without rubbing the skin,
and the places where the skin
is rubbed turn dark. The slack
scald method is the most satisfactory. 
Birds are held in water
from one-half to 11/4 minutes at 
125 to 130 degrees.
"The animal heat should be 
removed quickly after the bird
has been dressed, to check deterioration.
The best temperature
for this is from 35 to 40
degrees. If birds are being
dressed for freezing, all animal
heat should be taken out of the 
carcass before it is frozen. If no
refrigeration is available, the 
carcass may be cooled in clean,
cold water, iced if necessary,
and left 3 to 4 hours, before 
the bird is cut up for frying or
broiling. This method of cooling
should not be used where birds 
are to be frozen."
