"The Russians will destroy those oil fields before they ever let
Hitler get hold of them.  Don't worry about that.  They'll burn 'em up and

"They're sending our boys to North Africa after only ten weeks 
training at Camp Roberts (California).  They used to keep them at least
three months, but they've got so many coming in now that they get the old
ones out in ten weeks before the new ones come in."
...

"They accepted a fellow up at Fort Douglas (Induction Center) the
other day who only had one arm.  And another fellow  who was blind in one
eye.  Why, I worked with a fellow who has worn a brace on his back for
years, but they took him.  He's in Camp Carson, Colorado now -- with the
Engineers.  Brother, they'll get us all in there before very long."

"Japs are running all over the streets of Salt Lake all the time
-- all hours of the day and night.  I thought there was supposed to be a
curfew on those __________."

"I saw two Jap kids about 20 years old in a car stopped at a gas
station out here near Bountiful at midnight the other night.  There was
something wrong with their car and they were fixing it.  The attendant
wasn't helping them, but it was midnight and they had no business being
out on the highway that time of night."
