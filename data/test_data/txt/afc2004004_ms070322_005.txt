This keeps me horribly unhappy
a good deal of the time, but
because of analysis just completed
and because it is impossible for
my optimism to always be damped
I am happy between rejections.
Tomorrow we will make 
the last of 3 mildly successful 
broadcasts on BBC together &
then I don't know. But I
must write at least a page 
a day in this book until it
is empty. It's a fine fat
blue book and, if I am
lucky in love, its blue
sky color will be prophetic.
However, all with me depends
on love and so far I have been 
always unlucky.
