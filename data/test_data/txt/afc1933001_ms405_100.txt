Part of Big Sing's Trench Blaces[?], Louisiana

When I was a-stealin' 'cross the deep blue sea,
Lawd, I's worryin' with those submarines,
Worryin' with those submarines,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Raining here, stormin' on the sea,
"Woman I love, honey, do write to me,"
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

The women in France hollerin', "I no compris,"
Women in American hollerin', "Who wants me?'
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

We went to Berlin, went with all our will,
Lawd, if the whites don't get him, the niggers certainly will,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Wind a-blowin', big bell sadly tone,
Many a solider, Lawd, is dead and gone,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
