Washington, D.C..
Nov. 25, 1938.

Darling, 

Forget what hurt you in yesterday's letter from me.
Your two notes x reached me this morning and since then I
have been going about in a misty daze of contentment. As
you might suspect, however, i hav not x yet gone to a zxzxzxzx
psychiatrist, but I shall go tomorrow zxzxzxzx and find out 
as soon as I can what is wrong, if anything, so that I
can bring you home zx zxzxzx for a New Year's gift. I feel, 
though, that out of fairness to us both I should see what
is the matter before I involve you x in a lot of unhappiness.
And you must consider how it will be living again with
me and all the problems that involves before you decide to 
give up your freedom in Mexico, where you seem to be so
intensely happy, so hungry for good food. I may involve a
lot of time in Washington and a lot of stuffed shirt nonsense
that may not appeal to you at all and instead of the kind
of adventure, excitement and color you find in Mexico
there will be the American lack of passion. I have no confidence
that the South American trip will materialize at all
since it seems the state department has no money yet to do
such things and therefore you must not let this sort of thing
influence you. Of course, if I didn't feel that we would
have a lot of such trips together I would not stay on at the 
Library, but I have so many chances at this focal point to do zh
things that will provide pleasure for both of us that I
hate to cut the ties. There is besides the zx prospect of
a big job involving a very sizeable and pleasant income not
so far off and when I wander around the country and see so many
people out of jobs and suffering from the disease of unemployment
I begin to think myself a fool for not sticking pretty
tight. If this playwriting or this or that book comes through
that's a different matter, we can have all sorts of independence.
How about it, let's make writers out of ourselves, 
writing together, doing research together and sox on. Is
that prospect still an impossible one for you to face? I think
we can really begin together again and that my attitude will
now be entirely different. Please write me at leangth about
this.
Last summer, as I wrote you, perhaps, has made me realize
how important this job of folk-lore is. I have new experiences
every day that further convince me of how crucial the stuff
we had in the Archive can be if properly used and there is
so damn much to do. Do you want to help me or do you think
that is impossible for you?
Sometime during the weekend I am going to talk to Harold and 
see if I can get out of him a definite commitment on New York
and school. I think I might be able to manage to get about
a hundred a month out of him and possibly zux tuition out
of some fund or other and that then we could live very comfortable
there for six of nine months and you could go to school
too if you like in the same sort of way that Sergei did.
If you are interested-- this would be about February-- please
let me know. I want to know more than that you want me. God 
damn it I've wanted you for long that I'm now almost 
innured to the wanting, so -- oh Hell, darling, it's so damn
