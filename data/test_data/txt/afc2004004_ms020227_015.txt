and Frank?"  You know, they, they could be there an' not, ah,
not they -- You know, jus' like the girls dancin' with other boys,
they could be dancin' -- I didn't want them to see me neither.
You know?
     So I look in I didn't see Melvin an' Frank at that [time].
An' ah, so I got near about to her, I reckon 'bout as close as
here from that door, I turnt the boy loose.  I said, "I want..."
'Cause 'Lizabeth -- Marchin' on an' dancin', they figure
was goin' to the table.  You know, to the place where they buy
things, ya know.  Buy fish an' bread an' anything what they had,
folks had to sell to eat.  That was the set-up, ya know, that
was the, the rank they had.
     An' so, they was headin' over toward that table.  I, I walked
over there.  Jus' as we got to the table, they was jus' a-laughin'
an' talkin'.  An' I looked at 'em.  I said, "This is Rosalie house?'
     Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Rosalie was -- my daughter name
Rosalie, too -- she was outdone she didn't know what to do!
     I said, "Do you mean to tell me..."  Sumpin' about they, they
wanted 'em to come out there an' they comin' right on back.
     I said, "well, 's all right.  I jus' wanted to let you know I
know that you was here."  And I cut right out.  I said, "I'm goin'
back home."  I mean I went home!
     And from that day to this, I ain't been on a floor to dance...
I jus' couldn't make it.  Sumpin' tol' me, nohow, said, "It's time
for you to knock off." See?  "Ya daughter big enough to dance; you
take (pride in -?-) dancin', you stay off the flo'...An' I ain't
been on another/n, ha, ha, I'm tellin' you, never!  
     I felt jus' like a cut dawg.  But I was so glad that I see
her first. Ha, ha, ha!  God!
