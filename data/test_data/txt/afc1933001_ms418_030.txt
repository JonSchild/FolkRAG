Fred Lequier's
Call for Help

(By MICH. LOCAL 15 IWA)
(Apologies to Lena Lewis, Smohomish, Wash.)

Mr. Green received a letter the other day
From Fred Lequier, and this is what it had to say,
"Dear Mr. Green, I've been offered another job it seems
A better one than I ever dreamed.

The Devil said he would give me the job down in the brimstone of Hell
And if you will go with me, there we could start another A. F. of L.
But it seems about me--the old Devil doesn't know what to do
That's why I'm writing this letter to you.

He said for me he was going to keep the fires white hot,--maybe for a joke,
But I'm telling you right now I didn't like the way he spoke
It looks to me like he's going to hang around
Just to see what will happen there beneath the ground.

I wish you would make up your mind--come go with me,
Then we will show the old Devil what a Hell can be,
There we can have a C and J union, a longshoremen's too,
A miner and maybe a few others that will be new.

Instead of just one union like that C. I. O.
We will have hundreds and hundreds, you know
And every time a scab joins one of them he'll think he's in luck
But he'll find every one he joins will cost him more than a buck.

For down there we can get all the scabs we wish
They are thick as leaves on a bush.
And they will work for a penny a day or nothing at all
When they are gone and there will be plenty of others at our beck and call

I'll be waiting to hear what you say
For I want you to be sure to send an answer today
Make your mind up and make it up quick
I hate to say it, but I know I'm licked.

It is only to you that this I confess don't you see
We will take a trip far below
So hurry and pack your grip and come with me
Down where we can run things to suit ourselves and thank God there'll be
no C. I. O.
