San Antonio, Texas, 
August 3, 1942

Young woman Government employee:     "Russia is about to go under.
She has called in the Navy and the Marines to help her".  Question:                        [*34*]
"Where did you get that"?  Answer:  "Over the radio".  (Comment:  She
doubtless did not quote the radio report correctly, garbling it in the 
first statement made by her after hearing the story).
