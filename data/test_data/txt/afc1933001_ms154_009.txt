Dear Mr. Lomax:
We are in need of a elementary school song. We
should like to have a lilting cowboy melody since that
seems to fit our state better than anything else we
can use.

I am enclosing a copy of the one circumstances
has bestowed upon us. No one likes it but we can't
do better ourselves.

If there is a charge for this assistance, please
state the amount in your answer.

Hoping for your cooperation, I am,

Gratefully yours,
Rose Martinelli
