boiling in bay for years
I was the happy occasion

- A musical vertigo -
polkas [demanded by 
the old folks], jazz insisted
on by young boys
especially a certain gentleman
jitterbug who brot
a guitar base fiddle like
for 2 hours, directed
music, [as bed] howled
for hot music even
when mother sang
Polish wedding song
