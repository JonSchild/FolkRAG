Dear Mr. Strunk:
We brought Aunt Molly 
Jackson out from New York last
week and recorded 54 of her songs
from the Kentucky Mountains. She
is a typical ballad singer and her
songs make a valuable addition to
our list. Also we have recorded
75 songs of Huddie Ledbetter. All
these songs have been recorded since
January first on the 54 records
listed on the enclosed statement. I 
realize that I have incurred this
expense without any authority from
you and I shall be governed without
protest, or any right of protest, by whatever
decision you come to. You will get
the records just the same
