Mr. Alan Nomack,
Folk Music Program,
C.B.S., New York City.

Dear Sir:

I thoroughly enjoy your programs of American
pioneer music, especially the one last Tuesday 
morning when I heard a tune that was
almost the first my ears ever listened to;-
"Blow Ye Winds of Morning". My dad would fix
his easy chair in front of the fire place, stir
up a good blaze, take me on his lap and then-
"he was killed and scal-ped by the bl-o-o-o-dee 
in-ji-ins," how I would shiver and shake
and then join in the "blow! blow! blow!" I can
remember the chorus words and tune but the
verses and their music evade me; can I obtain
them somewhere?

My father was born in Ashland, Ohio in the early
40's, his folks coming from Pennsylvania; then
during the reconstruction period following the
Civil War he and his father worked as carpenters
on the new railroad and while in Indiana met my
mother. They knew just about all the old tunes
of that part of the country. We were a musical
family and truly enjoyed ourselves.

Yours very truly,
Geo. Lee Kramer
