My dear Mr. Lomax:

Many thanks for your nice
letter.

I am very glad you like
the spirituals and only wish
you could see the Negroes as
they sing them. As hard as
the white people try (and they
do wonderfully well) they can
not get the marvelous rhythm
and (some thing) that touches
my very soul that the
originators of the spirituals
put with their singing and
shouting. I guess you know
that the shouting is taken


2
from the generic African dance
and is the rhythmic movement 
of the body and not the mind.

I am mailing you the names
of the thirty who sang when
Mr. John Lomax did the
recording July 16 - 37

I would have had all of the
material written up for you
mother (as I promised her I would)
but sickness prevented me.
However I am at work again
and just as soon as I can I
will correct as well as I can the
titles of the spirituals and send
