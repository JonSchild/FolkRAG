Mr. Harold Spivacke, Acting Chief
Division of Music
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

    I have just got back to town and hasten to say,
in case we don't meet, that I am exceedingly sorry to be out
of town on the two days you mention, for I certainly do want
to talk over with you those Lomax records which Miller and I
are trying to have Columbia dub over for inclusion in the 
Carnegie Music Set.
  
   As this letter cannot reach you until after you 
have left Washington, I shall try through Carleton Smith to 
get in touch with you somehow in the meantime.

               With best wishes, I am
                               Sincerely yours,
                                Eric T. Clarke
                               Eric T. Clarke

ETC:S

P.S. I've just learned where you'll be from Carleton
so shall re address this letter, hoping you 
may decide to remain over for Monday 
morning. If you do I'll fit my time to 
suit yours.  E.T.C.
