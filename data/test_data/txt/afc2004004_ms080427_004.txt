APPALACHIAN JOURNEY

[BACKGROUND SOUNDS, MUSIC]
                      AL     These wonderful green hills have been
the seen of one of the most exciting and productive cultural
experiments of the last two hundred years.
                      People came bearing strains of the north
adventurer, of Celtic fantasy, of the Protestant revolution
that helped to free mankind from the old tyrannies of kings
and emporers.
                      Every valley produced a new mix of the many
strands of British culture, Scotch, Irish, English, Welsh.
And in this grand setting all were influenced by the
civilized Cherokee town dwellers who taught them how to grow
tobacco and corn and squash and how to play the mouth bow.
                      But the Indians found that there was no end
to the pale faces and no end to their greed for land and
gold.   And so the long and tragic war broke out and drove
the Indians west on the trail of tears.
                      :        They marched most of the Cherokees
across into Oklahoma and killed lots of women and children,
you know, on them marches.
                      AL     Are you proud of your Indian blood?
                      :        Yes, sir. Definitely.
