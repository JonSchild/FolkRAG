 The baptism of the Jesus - Bande Obeisance
 - Thomar- habitation Braleton March 25
Thomar told me that the baptismal
service would be held at five o'clock.
When we arrived, the gate [in] [from] leading
into the habitation was arched over
with woven palm fronds into which
paper flowers were interlaced. Nobody
had come and nobody came until seven
so we amused ourselves in other ways.
A candle [was lighted] flickered before Guide's cross
in the house of the Braves.  On top of the
cross [a new] there was a new baton.
[*the cross was covered with a red mouchoir*]
Thomar, the gauga, the master of the
band, took Baron's bottle of clairan which
has a cross inside it. (Baron Samedi's
Baron Cimitiere, Baron de la Croix.s)
and making me lay hold on it
saluted the North & the East
