At a meeting of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Beverly
Hills on August 4th, an attorney stated as a fact that the FBI is
much concerned over sabotage in aircraft plants and shipyards and
it fears a serious outbreak of sabotage if and when the Nazis
take over Southern Russia. Heard by this office August 7th.
Stories of Japanese atrocities are being played up by the
local press, and in one instance a young man about to enter the
army expressed concern over rumor that the Japanese had been tearing
out the tongues of American prisoners. (August 7th., 1942)
Stories are in circulation that the Japs are receiving
preferential treatment at camps. One story is, "the Japs are getting
high wages for the work they do." A daughter of a hardware
merchant who made the foregoing statement said she knew for a fact
that the Japanese were receiving special script books with which
they were able to buy non-essentials not included by the Government.
She was very critical of the fact that both the rich and
poor Japanese were eligible for these script books. (What she
did not realize is that the Japanese receive script books for the
work they do, and there is no relation to their own personal finances.)
In recent weeks a local clergyman has been assuring
the people that the Japanese have been committing atrocities of
all sorts.
Another story receiving wide distribution was told by a
Long Beach lawyer on August 8th, that is, "Motion picture actors
get the easy jobs and you know who runs Hollywood--the Jews."
