Man:  Surely
AL:  Lots of times
Woman:  Yeah.  Feel what you sing, I mean.
AL:  No, I mean you've actually felt the spirit when you
were in church, carried you off. . .
Woman:  Oh yes.
AL:  How does it come to you?  Does it come to some part of
your body, or does it come in your heart?
Woman:  It's in the heart. .and in the soul!
Man:  And the fact is, it's like the song said, it's all
over you!
AL:  And then you laugh and you jump, and you. . .
Woman:  She hollers!
AL:  What do you do when you get happy?
Woman:  I. . .uh. . . holler a little bit (laugh)
AL:  And talk in tongues?
Woman:  No.
AL:  That happens in your church though, doesn't it?
Woman:  Well, there are different kinds of what they call
Church of Gods, some speak in tongues, some handle snakes,
and we don't do that.  (laughter)
Linda:  It's a different kind of Church of God, it's not
Pentacostal.
AL:  Oh, I see.  But you felt it too, Madonna, haven't you?
