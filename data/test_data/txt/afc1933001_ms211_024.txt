Dear Alan:  This in reply to yours
of January 21 which reached me
the day following my last letter
to you in which I enclosed a
small birthday remembrance and, in
addition, some pointed observations
on your manifest failure
as a satisfactory correspondent
of your father. As a further
reminder I do not know
whether you received the table
of contents on the copy of Strunk's
notes in Ballads #I. The cost of
corrections, as you will note,
