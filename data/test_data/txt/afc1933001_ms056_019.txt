Port Aransas, Texas,
3/26/1939.

Dear Mr. Spinocke:
This bunch is my present choice, though you might wait until I hear from San Antonio again. I'll shoot the letter on as soon as it comes, at least by the middle of the week. By then Mr. Thornbush will have information enough to make his own choice direct. I hope he will take over at once
