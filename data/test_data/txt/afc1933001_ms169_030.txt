Dear Miles:
It was a pleasure to hear from you and
I have passed the change of address on to Dr. 
Seeger. If anything should come up, I'll keep
Dr. Hayek in mind, and as for yourself, don't
fail to come to see me when you are in Washington.
By the way, did you know that we have sponsored
some recordings in your state, with the
able assistance of Dr. Leland Coon. You might
take a look at the records and keep your eye
on the project (from the folklore end). I think
they could stand some help. That's entirely off
the record, of course.
With kindest regards,
Sincerely,
Alan
