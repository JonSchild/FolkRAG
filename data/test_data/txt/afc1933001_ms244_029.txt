I have yet received no official
notice of my trip
and have no authority to
pay out money for the
Library as I have already
done. Before I start
to Alabama I wish to
know about your agreement
with Mrs. Tarttâ€” 
how she is to get her money,
etc. I do not think she
has any to advance.

The microphone and
the microphone stand do
not match. Jerry didn't
send me my level which
I left with him. We very
much need all his
recording suggestions.
