"We are just getting started on this business of rationing and price regulations.
Before long we will be unable to get sugar and coffee at any price.   Its only
a matter of a short time until the Government make gasoline rationing a nation wide
affair, and there is no sense in doing it in this and other states where we have 
plenty of oil and gasoline"â€”Oklahoma City, August 4.  [*28*]
