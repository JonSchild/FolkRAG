Syracuse, New York

Dear Mr. Gorman:

For Mr. Davis, I am responding to your letter
of October 5th, since the question of rumors is one
which comes under the responsibility of the Bureau of
Intelligence, of which I am in charge.

We have heard from Mr. Warren B. Walsh, of
the Syracuse University Rumor Clinic, to whom we have
replied as per the attached copy.

We will undertake to send you, just as soon
as it is released, copies of the material promised to
Mr. Walsh, and we feel certain that you will want to
take into consideration its recommendations in the
formulation of whatever plans your newspaper has for
the treatment of rumors.

Sincerely yours,

R. Keith Kane
Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
