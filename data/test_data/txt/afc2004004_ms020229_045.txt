An' so he had never, had never -- ministry (?), not none (?).
Dr. Brian was, was, carried himsel'f, ya know. (?)
He come to the field?  Ya see him comin' now, maybe on a hoss.
Next time ya may see him comin' on, in a road cart.  Next time,
broo!  Right through there in a car.  Ya never know where he at.
Some time ya see him walkin clear down side a the field.  Ha, ha,
ha, ha!  You just don't know how he comin'.  An' when he comin'.  He's
just...That, that's true.  Right on down -- I say
because he had three plantations.  An' he didn' want nobody to , to
'rest nobody on his place.  See, but he wasn't bad.  Ya see, he
jus', he jus' don't 'low 'em.  He said that his father given him
places an' he want all his hands to be lovely an' to live
good an' do good,ya see?
All right.  But if him an' a man fought out, he fights 'em.
Fist by fist.  Don't want no-nobody, no police, have nothin' to
do with it.  Said, "If they whup [me] 'im, it's all right."  [Jus' -- it] He said, "It
don't make no diffrunce."  An' he will whup [whoever] him, he want [him] 'em
to take the same way.  Now, at's the natchul way he was.  He's a big
scoundrel, too.
So he got a, ah, a lil' Geetchie (BAHAMIAN) came in there
from somewhere down about Brunswick, down in here,.  Ya know, they
don't like the upper part a Georgia, nohow.  But how -- he,
he got with a woman or sumpin', but anyhow she brought him up, up
in there.  Lil' sho't fella.  An' he come up there an' that boy
was wit' -- He, he work all he could, ya know, what he knowed
how ta do.  But he didn't know how to plow.  Didn't know nothin'
'bout no plowin', ya know?  An' ah, 'cause, sho' enough, they
ain't no plowin' down there.  Ya know, not like that.
