they heard after that [that] hit was the same man workin' in their
yard...Workin' there fer them.  A white man, he worked in, around
the yard, he took care a all, all the place for 'em.  They had a
big place around there, a large place.  An' he's [the one]a white man.  He 
wasn't rich or nothin' like they, they was, but he's a white man.
An' he put his face black.  'Cause Mama an' them said they got
over to it, an' you, you know, they heard it through, I mean,
he musta told somebody.  But then hardly didn' find it out, he was
the one.  But they didn't have killed nobody for it, to they knowin'.  They
may have.  'Cause 'cross that river was nasty an' bad.  No doubt.
