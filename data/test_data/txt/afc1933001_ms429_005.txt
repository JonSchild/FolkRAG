JUST FOR FUN

Tipperary--

It's a good time to get acquainted,
It's a good time to know
All the hustlers and the live ones
That are here and make things go.
Good-bye, chilly shoulder!
Good-bye, glassy stare!
When we all join hands and pull together
We're sure to get there.

Smiles--

There are smiles in Old Kentucky,
There are smiles in Idaho,
And you'll find them down in dear old Georgia,
And in every part of Ohio.
There are miles of smiles in Minnesota,
And in Michigan and Tennessee, 
But the smiles that grow in North Dakota
Are the smiles that look best to me!

When You Wore A Tulip--

Are you a camel, or aren't you a camel?
And say, do you have a hump?
Do you sit at the table
As straight as you're able,
Or all down in a lump, lump, lump?
Are you a lizard, a lounging "lounge lizard",
Without any starch in your spine?
For if you're a lizard, a lounging "lounge lizard",
Then go somewhere else to dine!

Auld Lang Syne--

We're here for fun right from the start,
So drop your dignity!
Just laugh and sing with all your heart,
And show your loyalty.
Let all your troubles be forgot,
Let this night be the best,
Join in the songs we sing tonight,
Be happy with the rest!

North Dakota Is My Home--

North Dakota is my Home! Where the Indians loved to roam.
Ki-yi! Ki-yi! Wh-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!
Where the gopher flicks his tail!
