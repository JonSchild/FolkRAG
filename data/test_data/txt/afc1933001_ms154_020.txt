I am assuming this is a natural request because I have been "open house"
to you, and you to me.

I was more sorry you were ill and I knew it over last Tuesday's broad
cast even had I not had the disappointment of your not being at Helen's
party.  I hope you are now feeling yourself.

Mr Robins was at Helen's party and I do not know whether he had a 
good time, or no; but he has a whimsical sense of humor and much for it to
feed upon.  Elements he would not recognize were that Helen's entire family
and all her students had either had the grippe or were toppling over with
it.  Helen, herself, just wobbled through, but chose to keep the date because
it suited so many friends.  It DID NOt suit Dr. Thompson not Prof. Louis
Jones and it did not suit you, which was sad.

Thank you ever so much for the songs you sent.  I'll follow up the
Chester address as soon as I am released from captivity.  I had an electro-
cardiograph yesterday which may explain why my heart doesn't yet lie down
after my trip to Providence.  I hope I can dismiss the subject.  But I'm
particularly near the phone these days, you can see, and the radio announcement 
should bring in a crop of lines and addresses by phone or letter, if you
think proper to write a letter which can be read over the local station.  I'll
tag every address I get, if you like, "Through Alan Lomax".

Best wishes every day, from
Helen Flanders
