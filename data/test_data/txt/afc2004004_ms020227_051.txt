BJ:  Why, they just diffrunt.  They, they are more healthier chilrens, you know.  When ain't nothin' happen to 'em with the milk.  They're more healthier chilrens an' they easier to mind.

AL:  What?

BJ:  Easier, to mind.  Un-understandin'.  Yeah, when they comin' up.  These children nursed off this goat milk an' cow milk an' mon-monkey milk an' all them kinda milk that they don't know what they drinkin' theyself?  Real disobedient children.  You has a time.

The Lawd says that a baby has a sincere desire, you know.  He wont (want) that milk.  You see, that's what he supposed to have, too.  It's human milk.  He's supposed to be human?  Supposed to drink human milk.  You see?

BJ:  Never have.

TL:  You never knew anybody but your mother and you?

BJ:  Um-hum... That's all I know of.  Definite.  Never heard of 'em say that they had milk all the time.  Some of 'em dry up too soon.  They dry up too soon, they have to wean the baby.  They don't have no milk.  Plenty of people.  An' some of 'em go on,
