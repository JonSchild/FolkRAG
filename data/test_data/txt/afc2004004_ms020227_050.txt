I says, "It sure ain't."

Said, "he can have bof of 'em."  He had done given 'im one, decided I could give 'im one; he wa' gonna keep the other'n.  An' said, "The baby ain't got no teeth."

I said, "No, he can't eat."

Said, "He can have bof of 'em."  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  I'll never forget that.  He said, an' so...

An' so, but anyway, I nurse all of 'em 2 years, you see?  Every one I had.

TL:  How did you go about weaning then?

BJ:  Well, ah, sometimes ya put castor oil on it.  If they nurse that off -- you know, that ain't gonna hurt 'em.  You know!  an' so... an' red peppers.  Sometimes they'll,  ah, holler, an' you... You don't put that much; lil' bit; just let it burn.  But I weaned Baby George with, ah, with them ol' pills what they call uh, uh... Uh, what you take... N.R. Tablets?  You know what N.R. Tablets?  They are bitter as gall!  They cleans off ya liver.  I takes 'em every one in the summer, now, when I can't git no herb medicine.  But they're bitter!  I just rub a little across on there.  Boy, it's so bitter!  An' he just take that; he don't want no more.  He push it back, ha, ha!  An' then I give 'im sumpin' to eat, see?  I weaned him, that way.

Joe, I jus', he just got tired a nursin', I reckon.  'Cause he got big 'nough tell me to sit down.  "Sit down here!"  Huh, huh, an' nurse 'im.  An' so...
