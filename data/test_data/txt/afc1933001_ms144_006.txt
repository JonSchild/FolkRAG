Decca has what's left of their masters--- about forty--- and I should like, with your permission to consider buying everything Bloomfield's has---if they turnout to have a large stock---for the Library. I should also like to visit Port Washington, Wisconsin, where the records were pressed, next summer and see what they have left.

I learned this afternoon that Downes has definitely bought the Labor Stage show "Evening of Negro Music" for the world's fair. Lead Belly was featured in this show -- at my suggestion-- and the rest of it stunk--although it did get good reviews. I feel a little sore at Downes for not having at least let me know about this or mentioned me in connection with it and I wonder whether a letter from you might not help. One more thing before I close this long--and what must seem to you---exhausting letter. Miss Knott has scheduled her show significantly for he end of April. I wish there was something that we could do about keeping it out of the fair. I am sure there isn't, but I wondered what you thought.

Enclosed you will find a couple of letters that may interest you. 

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax

P.S. I can now notate simple tunes, sing all intervals at sight and write fair phonetics.
