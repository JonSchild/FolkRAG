never take calimun see? An' so...I told Dr., ah, Murchison (?)
about it that night. An' then he said, "Don't take no calimun." 
     He said, "All right." Gave me calimun there. Before he left
there, I think, I was goin' to the top a the house an' comin' back
down! I don't know where I was goin'! Just in the bed, though, but
thatâ€™s the way it looked like I was doin'.  Looked like I was just,
I was -- boy!, I was too sick. An' ah, so they looked at the other,
the lil' ol' red-lookin' capsule that he left there. An' ah, one
of the ladies, Miss Janie, she dead now, she said, "Calimun's in
them things." Said, "Must be calimun."
     So Mr. Jim got on [that] the ol' mule an', boy, by the time
he got to town good, he, he was there! He s', "You musta give
her calimuns."
     He say, "Yeah, I gives her some." [but I didn't guess] 
     He say, "Come back an' give her s -- she's
gonna die." He come back an' he tol' 'em then, "The doctor tol' 'er
not to take calimuns. She had blind staggers when she was little."
He come to gi' me a dose a croton oil. The thing hadn', hadn',
hadn' disolved good. That thing was killin' me. (STORY CONT. P. 49)
