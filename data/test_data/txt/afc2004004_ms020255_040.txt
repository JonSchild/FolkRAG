     Man, I cried 'till I. . .I said, "I'm gonna do sumpin', peoples.
Sumpin' got to happen."  You know it?  An', an' I went up then an',
an' wrote to Mr. Singleton.  I had jus', I had done seen 'im then,
see?  I wrote to him.  An' I couldn't git no hearin' from 'im.
He done moved from Waynesboro further over there.  Couldn't no
hearin' from 'im.  An' I myself thought a these things.  You know,
what he tol' me about, this devil wizard weed.  I said, "I don't
know what ta do with the stuff.  But I'm gonna do sumpin' with
it, if I fin' it."  We went on down to the trash pile an' over from
the trash pile, right on the water?  It jus' layin' there, jus' --
It grows on water, ya know, near water.  I said, "Gather up plen'y." (?)
     We had sent Pinkey down, down the railroad track ta git
some wood.  She'd tote wood.  Jus' do anything like that, ya
know, hol' 'er mouth tight, an' don't talk, tote that wood an' den
BOOM.  Throw it down an' she'd go back an' git more.  Jus'
like a ox, you know.  Anything she had learnt to do that way, at
home, she'd do it.  Just fast an' a heap of it, ya know.  So she
was totin' wood, from the railroad, ya know.  Ya know, gittin'
cross ties?  Where the folks go 'way.  An' Pinkey brought, 'd
bring that wood to the house.
