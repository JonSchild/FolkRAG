old friend -- Miss Ca[?]ey -- 
helpful as she has been -- 
could hardly give you the
sequences.  She is invaluable
in giving you the atmosphere.
I regret I was not there
at the time of your visit.
I am finishing an opera
on the 1777-1779 period in
[Kashkashia?] --- [?]
If I could afford it I would
go to Washington, and to see
you before I produced it.
My work involves Indian, French
Continental soldiers, slave, Spanish,
English etc --
Very sincerely
