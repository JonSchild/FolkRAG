How About Appointing Yourself a "Rumor-Warden?" 

from FORTUNE August, 1942 issue (pg. 113)

Every nation Hitler has conquered, he has first demoralized with rumors. He's trying the same game on us --- and his agents are diabolically clever. For they make a rumor that was born in Berlin sound as if it were truth straight from the White House. 

Will you help smash this potent Axis weapon? Will you appoint yourself a "Rumor-Warden" to stamp out rumors injurious to us? 

As a business executive, you are ideal for such a job. 

Your standing in your business and your community gives weight to your opinion. 

You have a wide circle of friends and acquaintances. 

Your experience has trained you to analyze and weigh statements, to demand that facts substantiate claims, to sense significance in casual remarks. 

You would recognize the Berlin influence behind a rumor more quickly than most people. 

Will you do this -- when anybody tells you one of those "straight-from-the-feed-box" tales, point out to him why spreading such gossip is bad medicine for our side? Ask him in the future to test every such story against these questions:

1. Does it hurt morale?

2.  Does it make you distrust your government, business, labor?  (Divide and Rule is Hitler's policy.)

3.  Does such a rumor end to discredit our Allies?

4. Who would benefit most by spreading this rumor -- our
    enemies or the United States?

If your rumor-spreader is a good American he'll catch on-- and keep quiet -- and pass the caution on to his friends.

And you will be doing your country an invaluable service.
