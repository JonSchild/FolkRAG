Dear Mr. Lomax,

Mr. Fisher has asked me to write you with reference to the Music portion
of the First Latin-American Conference of the School of the Air.
Will you plan an hour and one half of "Folk Songs", by you, and the Golden
Gate Quartet, as a demonstration of the kind of music that is used on the 
School of the Air..
As soon as you have the program lined up, will you let us know, via Air
Mail, so that we may include it in the Programe..
Thank you,

Sincerely yours,
Jane Waring
