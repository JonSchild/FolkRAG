routine tasks, an understanding of the importance of following directions, the ability 
to remember, all are part of the personal qualifications necessary for a good rumor
reporter.

Rumors travel along social networks. It is important, therefore, that reporters 
be drawn either from all networks of the community or from people who are in a 
position to observe such segments. In order to keep track of rumors among Negroes, 
it would be important to have Negro rumor reporters. However, in order to keep track
of rumors among some of the wealthier circles, members of the hotel workers and bartenders 
and waiters unions might be recruited to supplement those within the group
who would be willing to do the reporting. 

Once recruited, reporters should be given special training. First, they should
be trained in detecting a rumor. Ideally, a rumor has three major aspects: (1) it is
offered as a fact, not an opinion. (2) it carries the implications of a private, reliable 
source of information, one not available to the general public, (3) it has a 
specific, rather than a general reference. These three features distinguish rumors
from all other forms of orally transmitted materials. It is often difficult to get
a clear-cut expression in just so many words of all three phases of the rumor characteristics,
but if one or two features are clearly present[ed] and the other(s) [are] implied,
then the communication should be considered a rumor.  As soon as possible after the
rumor has been heard, the reporters should write the rumor down word for word as it
was given.  Wherever possible, the context of the conversation should be presented so
that the rumor can be interpreted most satisfactorily.  In addition, the rumor reporter
should be careful to record with each rumor the date and time, the place and circumstances,
and also as much basic information about the person who passed the rumor and
the people to whom it as passed, as he can give reliably.

It is suggested that the reporters be given a series of practice sessions where 
a few people present some sort of dramatic sketch in impromptu fashion, with the re-
