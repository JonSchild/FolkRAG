Dear Alan: You omit discussion of the
only point I tried to make, viz., that
as part owner of the material in question
I should like to be consulted before
you engage to sell it. My first
information comes through the half-
sneering, snooty letter from the
NBC people. From your own account
you [have] had been at work
on this project for some time.
What I have done or not done
to deserve your entire disregard
of my rights in the matter I
cannot imagine. A letter from
you setting out your point
of view would assuredly have
had my immediate attention. And
that letter should have come before
and not after the event.
