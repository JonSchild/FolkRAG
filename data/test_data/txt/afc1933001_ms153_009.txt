Dear Moses Smith: 
Please don't worry about the discount business, but 
pass the order on thethe department to be filled in the usual
way. Last year, I asked for the same thing and was surprised 
and delighted to get the discount. You seem to be doing a 
grand job. Happy New Year. 

Sincerely yours,
