she tole me.  Thass what ball me up.  Jes like you tell me that you
love me, an then go an tell someone else that you love him.  An then
you go an tell anothah man that you love him.  You got a dozen men
told that.  Some of them men gon kill you.  And some of em will
kill you.  I'm gon show you bout the sense a man's got.
If a man ain't go no sense, he's sure to kill you.  But if a man's
got good sense, he'll let you pass on by.
     Yo u take a woman like that:  She soon git to the place
she can't git no man to pay attention to huh.  Them thangs follow
huh jes lak watah from a leakin bucket.  An she'll find huhsef needin
hep from somebody real bad.  An every man in the neighborhood
knows all about huh.  If she git  a man wurth while, she'll have to 
git up an leave, go cross states.  Where nobody don't know anythang
about huh, fo she'd ever git any man who'd do anythang fur huh.
Thass right.  It's one of the wust things ever was fur you to ruin
yo'sef.
     If you got a man that you don't want, treat that man
nice anyhow.  That'll hep you to git the man that you do want.
Don't say anythang to that man.  Be careful wid him -- mo so than you
would wid a man you keered anythang about.  You see?  Cause he don't 
hardly feel that you love him nohow, you understan, from the way that
you treat him.  Bettah do yo bes fur him.  You ought to do mo fo him
than the one that you love.  Cause you have to do it to keep yo side
up.  Man fin out too much about you, you know he gon tell somebody
else if he don't kill you.  An thass gon ruin you wid othah men.
