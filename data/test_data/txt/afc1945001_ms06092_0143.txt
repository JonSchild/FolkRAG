I've heard that construction at Camp McCoy is very wasteful.  Carpenters
aren't attempting to make efficient use of lumber.  Instead of cutting two-
foot pieces from short pieces, they're cutting two-footers and smaller
pieces from 10 and 12 foot planks.  Much good useable lumber is wasted, and
emergency transportation of lumber by truck is made necessary. --
