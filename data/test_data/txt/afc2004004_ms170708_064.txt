Cox: My father used to sing that, yeah. (pause) He used to
sing that one. (pause) Do you want - would you like to hear
another gypsy girl like that, an old song, fairly; I got it
off an old gypsy.
Kennedy: What, about the orphan gypsy girl that told her
fortune?
Cox: There's three verses. No, this here is about a squire
an' a gypsy.
Kennedy: I'd like to hear that one.
Cox: What, this here? You want to hear the old squire?
(laughs)
Kennedy: Which squire was this?
Cox: I can't tell you which. But I'll show you how it go.
Like that - o' course you can sing it higher if you wanted to 
but I never did.
One spring morning early a young squire was straying,
Over the beauty that nature gave birth.
The old folks were            for the young folks were playing,
And there he beheld such a dark gypsy lass.

Struck with such beauty, he seemed most delighted,
He forgot his descending and family pride.
But let her be what she may, either wealthy or lowly,
He swore by the powers he would make her his bride.

Now here's to your horses, you carriage an' splendours,
Here's to your horses an' the green wooded dell.
Behind the campfires two bright eyes were shining,
And that's where he first saw his own gypsy girl.

Stay with me now, in a few months I'll marry you.
The smoke shall be your descending and shall be your guide.
May I tell your fortune? My dearie, I know it,
The fortune I crave for is you for my bride.

Do you wish to insult me by your grand proposal,
Do you wish a poor girl in misery, be seen?
Through dirt an' through mires an' I am light hearted,
You may ride upon my                      that stands on the green.
