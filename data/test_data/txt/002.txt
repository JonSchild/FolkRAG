the Earth. The other three sides are devoted entirely to music --
music representative of all of humanity and music which represents
the best of humanity. We believe that public availability of a two-
record album identical in content with the flight record will stimulate
listeners to examine our civilization and culture and consider how we
wish to be represented to the Cosmos. In addition, it may be for many
people a first exposure to some of the diversity and quality of human
music.
Under its protective cover the flight record will have a probable
lifetime of a billion years. It is unlikely that many other artifacts
of humanity will survive for so prodigious a period of time; it is clear,
for example, that most of the present continents will be ground down and
dissipated by then. Inclusion of the musical selections on the Voyager
record ensures for them a kind of immortality which could not be achieved
in any other way.
We would like you to be a member of the final musical selection
committee and are very pleased that we will have access to some selec-
tions from your unique collection of ethnic music. In each case we will
need a release from the copyright holder. We feel we have an obligation
In return for your important assistance to prominently acknowledge that
assistance. We will be sure to include your name and affiliation in the
draft of any NASA press release about the record.  (We expect such releases
around the time of launch in late August.) I would also like to invite you
to prepare a few paragraphs for the commercial record liner or booklet,
and — if there is a book on the Voyager record — to consider preparing
all or part of a chapter on the rationale and significance of the particular
selection of ethnic music which we will have made. I am enclosing a small
token of my esteem.
With all good wishes,
Cordially,
Carl Sagan
