II. Lewis Jones' reports give us a good portrait of Mr. Mangrum, an important
middle class Negro, interested in music; general community activity during
the cotton picking season; sources of information about secular musicians
and secular music.

III. Last summer the following material was recorded with full documentation:
1. A very ordinary and unexciting Baptist revival service.
2. A group of old fashioned "hally spirituals" sung by the older
people of this same Baptist church.
3. Song singing by this same group.
4. A Holiness Church service in the northern part of the county.
5. The songs of a blues fiddler and a blues guitar player.

To complete our picture of the musical life of the county from
the functional point of view we need the following material:
I. From non "folk group"
A. (1) Attitudes of whites towards Negro folk music
(2) Accounts by white residents of the history of Negro musical
life in the community.
(3) General musical activity of the whites.
B. This same material from the Negro middle class - especially those
persons concerned with cultural activity in the county.

II. Printed and recorded music available
(1) Accurate bibliographical data on song books, sheet music, etc.
in the area. Accurate data on records in jute boxes and private
homes.
(2) Study of the use and absorption of this material by the folk 
group. Attitude of the folk toward written music, song 
sheets, song books, records, ect.
