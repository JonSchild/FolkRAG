The Drag man song

Here goes Cuttie the drag man
from South.
With his Pal long boy with 
a cigar in his mouth.
2
From bumming to hustling.
From Scrapping to to corning.
And meet the gold diggers.
But dont never tell them morning
3
Here comes young Margret.
She had work very hard.
She had work for a drgman.
In the white folks yard.
4
She pass with her bag
With the grease on the top
Unless long boy is in sight
She dont never stop.
