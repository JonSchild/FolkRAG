Cursing so much it echoed -
Arrah looks now you're [nev] teaching
the innocent echo to swear!

Cursing & swearing -
By all the red petticoats &
checkered aprons between Dingle
& Tralee  --
? - 
Sorrow a know I know
Sorrow fly away with him

Widow's Curse
No leaves wd ever grow on the
tree he was hanged on - no
grass ever grow around it -
No sun ever shine in the door -
[No] The lads wd never sing about
the demesne & no heir
for estate
It never came true!
