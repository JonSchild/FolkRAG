Dear Sirs: 
We are publishing next year a novel by Shirley Ann Grau for which the 
tentative working title, very likely to be changed, is FINISH, GOOD LADY; and 
in the course of the novel on two separate occasions Miss Grau quotes from old 
tunes, as it were, on the basis of versions that she recalls from her childhood, 
and she's not at all certain as to what the exact source may or may not have been 
or what it is she is quoting; although she does know that in the case of two there 
are versions that Alan Lomax has recorded in "Southern Folk Music". I enclose 
herewith tear sheets from pages 142 and 293 of her novel, in which she quotes 
respectively from "Johnny KooKoo" and "Death, Spare Me For Another Year". If 
you feel that these are in effect direct quotes from the Lomax recording and 
would like us to credit one way or another, we'd appreciate very much your letting 
us have word from you. 

Yours faithfully, 
for Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.
