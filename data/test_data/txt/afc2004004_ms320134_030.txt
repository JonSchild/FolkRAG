their job.  And he was an African [creo] right there in
Louisiana.  He's described in all those we have.  Girls were
crazy about him.  He was a light hearted fellow.  He went
everywhere and amused everyone.  And he became the person
that everyone wanted to have at their dances, black and
white.  And he was making satirical ironic songs in the
Caribbean fashion about all the things that were happenings.
They weren't necessarily songs about, I mean there were
great satirical pieces, ironic pieces.  And when he hit you
with a line that line might stick with you the rest of your
life.  It would certainly make a big difference in what,
what went on next, because everybody in the neighborhood
knew who was in it, even if he didn't mention you by name.
I mean that's, that's every, that's all over the place in
the West Indies and in Africa.  The bard makes a point in
his songs about something, somebody is out of line.
Somebody is doing too much.  Some girl is too loose or some
guy is too, too, too, goes too far and doesn't keep his
promises. 
     I remember in Haiti one time a girl was
wronged by a man in the community and she went to the local
song maker and he made a song that was taken up at mardi
gras and he left town that day and never came back.  He
couldn't face it.  He was too tough.  So she got justice
through music.  And Amadee could deal out justice that way.
