Come, all brother sailors, I hope you'll draw nigh
For to hear of the sad news, it will cause you to cry.
Of the noble Johnny Gallegher, who sailed to and fro,
He was loston Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.
"Oh Johnny, my dear son, in the dead of night
I awoke from a dream which gave me a fright,
And to Traverse City I beseech you not to go,
For you'll never cross Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.
Oh mother, dear mother, those dreams are not true,
I will shortly return and prove it to you,
For the Lord will protect me wherever I go
And I'll cross o'er Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.
It was in October in '73,
We left Beaver harbor and had a calm sea,
Bound away, Traverse City was our distination to go,
We were crossing Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.
We left Traverse City at nine the next day
And down to Elk Rapids we then bore away;
We took in our stores and to sea we did go,
For to cross o'er Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.
At nine that same night a light we did spy
That is Beaver Island, we are drawing nigh,
We carried all sails, the Lookout, she did go,
We were crossing Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.
Oh, Johnny got up and he spoke to his crew,
He says, "Now, brave boys, be steady and true,,
Stand by your for halliards, let your main halliards go,
There's a squall on Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.
The Lookout, She's a-running before a hard gale,
Upset went her rudder and overboard went her saidl;
The billows were foaming like mountains of snow,
We shall ne'er cross Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.
Siz own brother Johnny, It grieves my heart sore
To think we will never return to the shore; 
God help our poor parents, their tears down will flow;
For we'll sleep in Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.
