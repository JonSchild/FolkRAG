has fitted it up for her study hall. The whole Standefer
bunch ma e me feel awfully badly that I had not called them
about your short stay. They said that they would have come
back Sunday night if they had thought for a minute that you
all were leaving so soon. I would have called but you seemed
tired and I didn8t know whether or not you wanted to see a
lot of people. Owen also fussed because he did not get to
talk with you and Glen too, so I am in bad all around. And
a saw Mrs. Charlie Guy, whose husband is the editor of the
paper here, at a tea yesterday and she said her husband had
remarked that he heard you were in town and would like to
have seen you. So you see you disappointed your public as
well say our family by your haste.

Bess had a nice long letter yesterday from a girl 
in Chicago who she says is her best friend. She asked Bess
to come back to school that way and they could travel from
Chicago to gether so maybe if the Potts trip doesn't work out
that one will. Bess has already lost some weight and is so
helpful with the children. She tickles me reporting in her
solemn worried way over the evil doings of my children and
inwuireing if she handled the problem in the correct manner
from all angles. She has started in on her recipe hunting
and making of strange messes in the kitchen and on the whole
I could not ask for a more satisfactory child.

Please hurry back and stay longer and let me hear
from both of you often.

Lovingly,
Shirley.
