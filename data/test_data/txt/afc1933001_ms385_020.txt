        "Well," said the Senator, "let's go one back where the guinea's
'potrack.' Supper and Mrs. Bryan will be waiting."
        As we started to the car a cool, evening breeze fanned our faces
reminding the Senator of a 'norther.'
        "We used to have a Negro cook who would make down his bed at the
first whiff of a norther, singing as he tucked himself in:
                'Spoon up to my end,' says Tom O' Lynn,
                The winter is cold and the cover is thin,
                Spoon around and around,' says Tom O' Lynn"
        "There's more of it and also there's a lot more to another song
that same old Negro song:
                'Lulu, my coal black Lou;
                I never say a Nigger I loves like Lou.'
The cowboy says were singin' days," added the Senator.
