Gentlemen: 

Supplementing the "rumors"  which I sent to you as of August 8,
I submit the following,  heard by me up to noon today, August 15:

San Marcos, August 9 - 

"The big Army camp that was to be built near here is all off
now -- the county judge says so definitely."

San Antonio, August 12 -

"They shipped 800 men out of Duncan Field today for Station X.
They (civilian mechanics) were ordered to take only woolen
clothes, and it said that they were to embark at New York.
Everybody is sure they're going either to Ireland or Iceland."

San Antonio, August 13 - 

"A big batch of planes came into Duncan Field this week for
repairs.  It's going to keep every man working overtime, 
with no leave, until they're all finished up."

San Antonio, August 14 - 

"I went down to the tire rationing board to apply for tires
and it was just like to get sugar.  But I don't think I'll
have any trouble.  There's plenty of tires."

San Antonio, August 14 - 

"I overheard two men talking on the smoker.  One said that
he'd heard the warehouses in the big cities were so full
of tires they couldn't take any more.  And the other man
said, yeah, and all this gasoline rationing was just fixed
up so that some government officials could make a big killing
on their own."

Very truly yours
