Sept 23. London

Finally made my escape from 
Scotland, after incredibly sterile
dreamlike weeks. I'm too
weary inside to work & everything
takes too long.

I worked out a  plot for my
ballad opera and made the
mistake of choosing the eviction
subject. Rejected by London
& had to begin all over again.
Did finally do the Prince Charley
subject of wandering in the highlands
set about it with detestation
for Prince Charley, but had to
drop that. He is an incredible
character at 26 gallant & generous
& I had to write a good script
about him. Finished the script
at 7:30 AM the 21st - Left Glasgow
