you can't just go around here loosin' (?) around, you gotta be tough!
These city slickers, they wouldn't live long in these mountains,
(unint.).  I've had 'em up here, they cant make, ain't no way!
But I've growed up into it.  And talkin' 'bout the panic and hard
times, I've been thru 'em!  It does me good, I think about it and
laugh about it.  You go out here sometimes, now back years ago whe
I was first married, I'd go to my job to work and I'd have to get up

(unint.) apples, eat my breakfast and go on to work.  Not many times,
but several times. . . .
