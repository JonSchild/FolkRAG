store there -- the grocery store and the drugstore almost com-
bined-- they brought her to the next store there.   Well, a 
crowd of us colored folks was in there 'cause it was cold, an' it had a  
big heater in this store -- you know, they go over town an' jus' 
all around that fire -- An' they brought her in and laid her 
down an' called a doctor.   [Looked] Like [there wasn't] every a doctor'd [they] beed
[could] called. Dr. [Barry] Brown wasn't there an' they had a time to get 
a doctor.   An' so they still was keepin' that -- there was a white
man was keepin' that stuff to her nose an' all that.   An' so
she was layin' down, an' they had a chair, an' they had some
cushions around [on] with the chair on it, y'know, like a pillow, had her
braced up there.   An' she was so sick. An' one of [the] them white
men  [said,] spoke, said "Some of y'all ought take off her"-- see, she
got them tight clothes on.   I wanted to put my hand on her, I was
frightened an'     didn' know what to do, ya know.   An' this
boy was in there.   So I went [ov' there] on by the children, to take
lose her clo's.    An' I look around, ask some of the womens what's
gonna happen.   They look at one another like they was afraid;
some a them was old and some a them was young; there was a crowd
there; I didn't know none of 'um.   So, ah, an' this boy, he's the
same one.   He come there and ask some of the women.   He look
around an' none of the womens wouldn't he'p, so he walk right
over there.   An' he, um, then I took lose the            -- the hip
on the skirts, y'know.    Tall lady an' she did have a tight thing
on 'er -- a co'set.    An' I said, "She is got on a co'set."
An' he didn't say anything.   He an' I had to lif' her up.   Tha's
the closest I ever been to him.   But jus' I felt like I [so] could stay
there an' be with that woman the [whole] all day long.   Ha! Ha!   It
was on mind to wait on that woman the whole day long!   He didn'
know anything how I -- liketed that guy!   An' he taken this
knife an' I helped with the co'set, y'know, pullin' it up like
that, an' he taken  [it that] his knife and cut -- oh! but that was
a release to her!   That done her a lot of good, ya know.   An' he
said, "I'm glad a that."   So. I didn' say anything.   You know,
fanned her then.   An' he [held] kep' that stuff to her nose 'till the
doctor come. . .Tha's the closes' I been near to him.   An' that
was jus' all there was to it.   That was really joy when that [ol'] fat
lady fell down!
