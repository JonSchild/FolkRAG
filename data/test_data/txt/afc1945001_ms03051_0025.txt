Memphis, August 15.
We are not going to have the present Administration meddling with and
upsetting our racial relations down here. They are responsible for any
trouble that may be brewing. If we were left along to handle the
situation, it could be done without any lasting bitterness and with the

Washing is a rat run. What with all the confusion and contradiction
it is next to impossible to get anything done. (Businessman)

Practical business is over the head of most Washington bureaucrats. 
(Businessman)

We'll have gasoline rationing after the November elections.
