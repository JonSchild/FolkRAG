The Minister from Haiti
1818 Que Street
Washington, D. C.

My dear Mr. Minister:

    This will present to you Mr. Alan Lomax, son of the Honorary
Curator of our Archive of American Folk-Song, who is about to make
a visit in Haiti in the interests of the Library's collection of
recorded folk-music. In Haiti Mr. Lomax will be associated with
Miss Zora Neale Hurston, holder of one of this year's Guggenheim
awards. Mr. Lomax has previously worked with Miss Hurston in
Jamaica and the Bahamas; it is confidently expected that his
present expedition will result in an important contribution to the
Archive.
    Be assured, please, that the Library will keenly appreciate
any counsel or courtesy you may care to offer Mr. Lomax.
    Faithfully yours,

    Chief, Division of Music
