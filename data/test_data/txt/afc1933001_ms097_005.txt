Dear Mr. Spivacke : My checks came 
yesterday without your personal intervention 
& keep wondering how long 
I should have waited!! Thank you. 
a thousand times! If at any time 
I have [left] allowed my real feelings to 
become unpleasantly aware to you, I ask 
pardon. 
I have been thinking that I would 
write and tell Dr. Evans my experience
 in collecting my four last accounts, in 
the hope that he might be able to prevent 
others from an experience similar 
to mine. Do you think I could 
do any good? Or what do you think.
Please return the extra copy of my report 
on the Abilene, Ft. Davis, Pecos trip, March 
8 - July 10, which I sent to you.
Sincerely always, John A. Lomax
