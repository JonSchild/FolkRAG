BLUES - 1
(SLOW PIANO BLUES BACK THROUGH THE WHOLE RECORD)
SID:  Well, one of the reasons that I started playin' the blues was from-uh
just feelin' bad, lack of money. . .and-uh, fact of the business, [I]
couldn't find a job around at that time to make no extra money ---
workin' on the farm, plantations 'n' things like that. . .'Course some 
people say that the blues is  a-uh cow want to see her calf, but I
don't say it like that.  I say it's a man that's got a companion
and she turn him down (things like that happens, you know), and
that's wha' I gets the blues from --- when I want to see my baby,
'n' want to see her bad 'n' somepin happen [so] I can't find her ---
an' that gives me the blues.
So what do you think about it, Kid, you must have somethin' to say
about the er-uh reason why you have the blues?
KID:  Well, K'll tell you, Sid, it really worries me just to think [how]
I used to have a sweet little girl, you know, name' Estelle?
