SUBJECT: Rumors Amongst Italians in New York

Rumors that circulate amongst the Italian population of
New York present at least two characteristics which make them particularly
interesting. These are:

1. Simultaneity of the same rumor in different loci
of the metropolitan area.
2. Discrepancy between the intellectual formulation
of the rumor and the intellectual capacities
of the rumor spreader.

Italians dwell in several different sections of the metropolitan 
area, yet the same rumor appears on the same day in places far 
away, for instance, in Brooklyn, in the Lower East Side, in Hoboken and 
in the Fordham District of the Bronx. This phenomenon seems to indicate
that these rumors are artfully spread by some form of organized
agency.

These rumors are usually far above the mental capacity of
those who pass them around. For instance, I heard a barber, a fruit
vendor and a bootblack repeat a keen criticism of the Atlantic Charter
in terms of the actual Indian situation. Obviously none of these 
people had the educational or the intellectural possibilities to formulate
this criticism spontaneously.
