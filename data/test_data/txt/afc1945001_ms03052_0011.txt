Probably the most frequently heard discussions during the current week revolved around the rubber situation, rubber rationing, etc. Individuals were not particular critical of any particular phase of the rubber situation. Comment seemed principally to center around the authenticity of the various reports that appeared in press statements and Mr. Average Citizen really wanted to know:
1. Is there a rubber shortage?
2. If not, why not a loosening of restrictions?
3. Can rubber be produced satisfactorily synthetically?
4. If so, why is not something done about it other than conferences, committees, and conversation?
5. Can not some one in authority decide which, if either, is the best synthetic process and get busy along that direction?
