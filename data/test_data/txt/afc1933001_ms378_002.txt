Rain or Shine

We're alone, doney gal, in the rain and hail,
Got to drive them dogies down the Trail;

We'll ride the range from the sun to sun
For a cowboy's work is never done,
He's up and gone at the break of the day
Driving the dogies on their weary way.

A cowmboy's life is a dreary thing
For it's rope and brand and ride and sing
Yes day or night in the rain or hail
He'll stay with his dogies on the Trail.

Chorus

It's rain or shine, sleet or snow
Me and my doney gal are on the go
We'll travel down that lonesome trail
Where man and his horse seldom ever fail.

We'll whoop at the sun and yell through the hail
But we drive the poor dogies on down the Trail
And we'll laugh at the sun, the sleet and snow
When we reach the little town of San Antonio.

Chrorus
But it's rain or shine sleet or snow
Me and my doney gal are on the go
Yes, rain or shine sleet or snow
Me and my doney gal are bound to go.
