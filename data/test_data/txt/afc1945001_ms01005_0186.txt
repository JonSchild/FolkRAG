Mr. R. Keith Kane                   -2-                        October 8, 1942

                In conclusion, I might say that this immediate response
given to the subject of rumors at the policy level has been extremely
heartening and justifies BOT's attention to the subject.  If we can
only get someone equally excited about the Negro problem - - - - - -!
