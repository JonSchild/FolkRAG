On the following day, substantially the same statement was overheard
in a drug store where a group of women were having lunch. On this
occasion one woman stated that a portion of a regiment in which a friend
of hers was serving had already left Fort Jackson and the remainder of
the organization was scheduled to leave by the end of the week.

The same rumor later was heard in six different places on the
streets of Columbia and in each instance the organization figuring in
the rumor was the 118th Infantry, a unit of the 30th Division. 

2. On Tuesday, August 4, a young woman office worker was heard
telling an associate that a concentration camp was to be established at
Batesburg, near Columbia. She said that ground already was being broken
for the camp and that 1,500 soldiers would be stationed at the camp for
guard duty. 

This rumor has not been heard again. 

3. On Tuesday, August 4, five men were killed and two were injured,
one fatally, in a plane crash at Columbia Air Base. On the following day
a man on a Columbia bus was heard telling a man beside him that "That
isn't the only accident they've had at the Air Base in the last few days.
In fact, they've had lots of them they just haven't let people know about."

On Wednesday, August 5, the same rumor was heard on a street
corner in Columbia. A young man was overheard telling an older man (both
of them were well-dressed and apparently white collar workers) that many
of the pilots at the Columbia Air Base were too inexperienced to fly the
planes turned over to them and that numerous accidents occurred but that
Air Base officials were surpressing the news.
