Sunday morning. Tomorrow at seven
we land, and I shan't be very sorry.
One of our worst nights, Elizabeth and
I discussed not even coming back
at all if we couldn't make it back
by New Orleans where we wouldn't
have to cross the water any more.

Father so far has been medium
decent, only cornering Elizabeth
once to tell her all about
me and to ask if he had another
red-hot Red on his hands. Poor child,
she sure is in a spot. But we've
had marvellous times so far. We
saw the Gulliver picture in N.Y., [I]
really the best movie I ever saw. It
seemed to have wandered in by mistake
at some down-town movie-house. E. & I roared;
everybody else was very still. I love you so much;
give my love to Nick & Jean & Ruth & Charlie - Bess

ple to put me in touch with other
left young people and to tell
me as much about the political
set-up as they could. One is
to the director of a huge folk-
music archive in Prague, which
he says is the center of folk-music
activity in Europe now.

Sunday
The sea is like rough-cut marble
now, marvellously lovely with
streaks of white foam and
the sea folded back from the
boat in pale, pale blue-green
