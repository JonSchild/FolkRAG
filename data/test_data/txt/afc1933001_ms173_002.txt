Dear Alan:

We are now informed that Leadbetter is on the critical list at
the hospital and will not be able to go to Mexico. I have
asked Joshua White to go in his place, however, and he has
agreed.

As you know, the Quartet and White will be on the plane leav-
ing here the night of August 11th. You are to join them on
that plane at Atlanta. 

I am having the Accounting Department send you a cash advance
of $110.00 for expenses in Mexico City. This represents $15.00
a day. I am sending in this letter blanks for an accounting.
Will you please fill these in properly as you go along and turn
them in to me with your hotel bills, at the end of the trip,
since I have to send them to the United States National Defense
Council.

Your fee, of $250.00, will be paid to you on your return from
Mexico.

I note your request for routing on your return, and am advising
Mr. Bryant of it.

I look forward with pleasure to seeing you in Mexico.

Cordially yours,

Sterling Fisher
