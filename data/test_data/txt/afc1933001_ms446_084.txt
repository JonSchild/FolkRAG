69 

Through wind and storm, and rain and snow, 
Both night and day I have to go,
To fill the appointments I have made, 
Or find a place to lay my head. 

The rolling current beats with force, 
And ofttimes drives me from my course-- 
But he who is the sparrow's care, 
Protects and drives away my fear. 

Sometimes with hunger I grow faint, 
And toil on till I'm almost spent,
Without a friend or helper night, 
But Him who hears the raven's cry. 

But still I hear a glorious voice, 
Saying, Arise, in me rejoice ! 
Go to the earth's remotest bound, 
I'll be thy friend when foes surround. 

And when my work is done below, 
I hope to glory I shall go, 
And take my lofty, distant flight, 
To dwell with Him in endless light. 

Meet all my loving brethren there, 
And in God's kingdom have a share, 
And shout and sing forevermore, 
Where pan and toil are felt no more. 

No. 69 

The time is swiftly rolling on, 
When I must faint and die ; 
My body to the dust return, 
And there forgotten lie. 

Let persecuton rage around, 
And anti-Christ appear ; 
My silent dust, beneath the ground, 
Will no disturbance hear.
