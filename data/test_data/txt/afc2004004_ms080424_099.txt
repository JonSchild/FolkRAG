Roll 63  Stan Hicks  2

(AL)  Where you got your victuals, wasn't it?
Stan:  Yeah, we hunted for what we had to eat.  We had to hunt to eat,
and if we didn't hunt and get meat, we done without eating.  'Cause we
didn't hunt just for the sport of it, and we didn't hunt just to kill
the stuff.  We hunted to get the meat, and we'd dry it, what we called
making 'jerkel'(??) out of it.  And you could put your piece in your
pocket and you could go all day and just take it out and cut off a
piece and eat it when you waht.  You see, that's the way Daniel Boone
traveled.  You dried it, made jerkel (?) out of it, they called it
jerkel(?).  Dad, he dried several beefs you know, and hung 'em up,.
And us younguns kept to 'em, get some off of 'em and eat it.
AL:  Let's go over and get Stanley's picture dancing.  This was when you
were at the National Folk Festival, you were the big hit that year.
Stan:  Yeah, that's when I was up there, and I was in pretty good shape
then.  I could get ahold of the women, you know, and get on goin',
but now, you get old and stiff and can't get around like that.  But I
could get around pretty good, that's been about 5 years.  And that's
my brother over on the right, older than I am, the one next to it there.
And over there is where I rode the wagon train ten years, you can see
the wagon train in that picture next to it.  And that's my mules down
there, and that's my sister on it, that's her in there. . .(technical). . .
Now I used to get around pretty much, years ago.  But you know the older
you get, the less you get around, and the less you want to get around.
AL:  Of course you've got a big problem right now.
Stan:  Yeah, yeah, I've got a big problem.
AL:  Tell me about it.
Stan:  Real big problem, got my wife, she's got the Parkinson's disease,
