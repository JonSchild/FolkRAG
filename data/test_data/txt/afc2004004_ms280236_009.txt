1) O the light dragoon come over the hill,
The moon was shining brightly,
There was a young lady for she took him by his horse,
Because she loved him dearly,
Dearly, oh dearly,
There was a young lady, for she took him by his horse,
Because she loved him dearly.
2)She took him by the milk white mane,
She led him to the stable,
"There's hay and corn for your horse, young man,
Let him eat while he is able."
3) O she took him by the lily-white hand
She led him to the table,
"There's cakes and wines for you, my dear,
East and drink now you are able."
4) O she ran upstairs to make the bed,
O to make it soft and easy,
How nimble she jumped into bed
For to see if it was easy.
5) O the light dragoon he ran upstairs
He put off his army trousers,
How nimble he jumped into bed,
For to do what he was able.
6) They laid abed till the clock struck ten,
The trumpets they were a-sounding,
With her spirits high and her belly low,
And she ran into her mummy.
7) O where have thou been all this long night?
Inquired her anxious parents.
"O, I've been along with the light dragoon,
because I loved him dearly."
Lomax: Do you think that's a true song?
Joe: Yes, well, I don't know. Some folks, some folks don't like
to hear that one.
Lomax: There's nothing wrong with that!
