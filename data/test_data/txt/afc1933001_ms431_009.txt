THE RICH MAN AND THE POOR MAN
(Tune: Old English Air)

There was a rich man, and he lived in Jerusalem,
Glory Hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.
He wore a silk hat, and his coat was very spruc-i-um
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.

CHORUS:
hei-ro-gee-rum, hei-ro-gee-rum,
Skin-a-ma-link-a-dood-li-um,
Skin-a-ma-link-a-dood-li-um,
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.

And at his gate there sat a human wreck-i-um.
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.
He wore a bowler hat, and the rim was round his
neckium,

Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.

The poor man walked for a piece of bread and chees-i-um.
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.
The rich man answered, "I'll call for a police-i-um."
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.

The poor man died and his soul went to heav-i-um.
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.
He danced with the saints till quarter past elev-i-um
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.

And there he dwelt in Abraham's bos-i-um.
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.
Fraternalizing there with scores of other Jews-i-um
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.

The rich man died, but he didn't fare so well-i-um.
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.
He couldn't go to heaven, so he went to hell-i-um.
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.

The rich man asked for to have a con-o-sol-i-um.
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.
The devil only answered, "Come shovel on the coal-i-um
Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.

Now the moral of this story is that riches are no
jok-i-um.

Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.
We'll all go to heaven, 'cause we're all stony
broke-i-um.

Glory hallelujah, hei-ro-gee-rum.
