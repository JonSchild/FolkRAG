Dear Alan: Aunt Mollie
was fine, especially "with
his old boots and leggin's", as

Your Company has struck
the best idea, - to take the radio
to the folk-singer rather than the 
opposite. I am glad that you
will have no rival in knowing
where to [find] locate material and singers. I believe the
Negro that you and I [could] know
would make a marvelously interesting
program, if you would
let him talk without rehearsing
(between his songs). Think of Cleon
Rack or Henry Trewellen!

I am not well
over
