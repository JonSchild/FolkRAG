Nimrod:  Yeah it does. . . .and none of my family never went
to no doctors hardly.  We just gathered herbs, mix some,
take it, teas and so on.  We never hardly went to a doctor.
Since I been in Knoxville, I reckon they sent me down there
one time to the doctor.  They didn't do anything much, they
x-rayed me and talked about scarred up lungs, stuff like
that.  I just come home and started taking my own medicines.
AL:  You got some awful old people in your family. . .
Phyllis:  There is, yeah.  My grandfather lived to be 103, my
daddy's father and he died on my seventh birthday. . .There
was nothing wrong with him, he just quit breating.  He was
real old.  And my dad's sister, I think she's about 96 or 97
now, still going strong and I have an aunt, my dad's sister,
who, I think she's about 84, 85, she plays the banjo and goes
hunting, and walks 20 miles a day, and gin sings. . .gin singing.
