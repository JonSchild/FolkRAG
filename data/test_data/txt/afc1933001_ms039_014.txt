University of Kentucky
Lexington, Kentucky

Dear Professor Dantzler:

My trip to Kentucky has been greatly delayed
on account of trouble in getting a satisfactory recording
machine.  I cannot say now just when I will be there,
but I do expect to attend the Modern Languages Association
Meeting at Richmond, where I will be glad to talk to you
about recording machines..
