AMERICA, THE BEAUTIFUL
Oh, beautiful for rolling plains
Where fertile acres lie; 
The home of men who feed the world
Why must her beauties die!
America! America! 
Why must the sons of earth
For rightful gain seek but in vain
In this land of their birth?
Oh, beautiful for Law and Right
Proclaimed by heroes dead;
Where peace and plenty filled the land
And multitudes were fed!
America! America!
Redeem thy pledge to mon
That all may be content and free
And Justice rule again.
Oh, beautiful for pioneers
Who cleared thy fertile soil
And reared thy sons to build thy fame
With hard and honest toil.
America! America! 
Restore thy hope again;
And raise them to their rightful place
Among the sons of men.
G.R. Ingram

SONS OF THE SOIL - ARISE
Men of the soil, we have labored unending,
We have fed the world upon the grain that we have grown.
Now with the star of a new day ascending,
Giants of the earth, at last we rise to claim our own.
Justice throughout the land
Happiness as God has planned;
Who is there denies our rights to reap where we have sown?
Men of the soil, now the torch we have lighted,
Kindles fire in every land where rings the harvest song.
Shoulder to shoulder in courage united,
From every race we come to join the tillers' mighty throng.
Earth ne'er shall eat again,
Bread gained through blood of men.
We have sworn to right forever more the ancient wrong.
Men of the soil, we are coming in judgement
To tell the world till justice reigns, there is no liberty
We, in our strength are arising as prophets
Marching on to show the world the dawn that is to be.
There's a lightning in the sky,
There's a thunder shouting high,
We will never stop until the sons of men are free.
