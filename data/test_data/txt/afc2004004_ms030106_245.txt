The Todolo(Todelo or Toe delow)-- down in the ballroom, the guy would pull
up his coat and the girl her dress to a certain degree and they'd screw on down
to the floor and when they'd come up they'd hug up together and shake on down.
Trucking- came from the George Hunch- part of the repertoire of the eccentric 
dancers.
The Lindy Hop- started in New York after Lindy hopped the ocean.
The Slow Drag-
The Ping Pong-
The One Step, two-step, schottische, waltz, mazouka-
In Ohio another slow dance called the" Scronch".
I seen guys start off in N. O. loaded down with diamonds and bales of
money, the next year broke.  I learned from this.  The big guy would by it by the
can, wouldn't buy a card.  If you wasn't a hop fiend you were supposed to be very
brainy.  Be talking sleepy all the time and rolling Bull Durham cigarettes.
Could see dope in the district with the doors wide open and the policemen didn't
care.

Jelly Roll took a job on aboat as a mess boy so that he could cheat a gambling.
On the Nachez.  Poker game started.  JR started cheating.  Broke the game.  If
them guys had caught me as dumb as I was, they would have thrown me in the
river.  They would be the biggest strong guys [I] you ever seen.  If they went a 
little slow, they'd throw the whip into them- boy!  " On there cap'n boss".
If the bail of cotton would fall over board, the guy that was responsible
better jump on in after it.  They'd throw him a rope.  They wasn't nothing but
roust about, wasn't from N. O., must have believed they were still in slavery.
