Toast to Preachers.  O.C. King.

Once this preacher was going to be insulation.
He was riding along in the coupe car - -
Baptist, Methodist, and Sanctified preacher.
The Baptist preacher said,
"Let 's stop and take a drink."
The Methodist said, "Let's do so."
And they all got out and walked in the jinte.

The Baptist preacher, he called for a pint.
The bartender, he threw it to him.
The Baptist preacher passed him the buck.
He knocked the top off,
And he began to drink.

The Baptist preacher say, "God made man.
He made him big and stout,
And left a place for his rail
To hang out."
He drank and he passed to the Methodist preacher.

The Methodist preacher say, "God made woman.
He made her big and stout.
Jesus Christ sewed her up
Until the thread give out."
He drank his drink.
He passed it to the Sanctified preacher.
T
The Sanctified preacher say, Glory, Halleluyah,
It makes me shout
Just to think of the place
Where the thread give out."

Railroad Men Go to Town.
Will Stark.
Once there was a railroad crew, you know.  They was out a long time
till payday.  And they didn't have much money, and they wanted to to go
to town see some girls.  And they went to a place and asked the landlady 
and wanted to know how much was it to stay with a girl.  It was 
a dollar.  They'd a old Latin nigger amongst them, and he figured up
one fellow has 60Â¢, the other had 40, going till they made up five or
six dollars.  And he asked how long it was to stay overnight with a 
girl.  Said five dollars.  Says, "All right."  Says he wants to stay
all night with a girl.  And they didn't have but five dollars.  He 
tookd the five dollars, wanted all of um, you know to get service.
