     "We hope by our survey to stimulate an interest in absenteeism that will result in the establishment of a standard of what number of absences for illness normally should be expected in a given number of employees," Mr. McRury said. "Then we will have a basis on which we can show by positive figures whether absences are increasing.
     Basis for Comparison Lacking.
     "The basis for a comparison is lacking now because few employees were aware of the full importance of the loss from absenteeism in the days when business was not too good and the pay roll was frequently so heavy that savings from voluntary days-off were not unwelcome. The truth is that the figures available on absences from work in the past are rather skimpy, because many factories were not interested enough to report detailed compilations on the point."
     The war industries in the New York area who reported concern over absenteeism for the Industrial Conference Board survey supplied the information in confidence, Mr. McRury said, and he could not disclose their names.
     Investigators of the problem expressed the opinion that inquiries of individual manufacturers would not reveal the full extent of the problem because of the understandable tendency of any company not to announce publicly any difficulties that might delay war orders. In any case, calls at war industries in New York city and its immediate vicinity today found none ready to say that absenteeism had reached disturbing proportions with their own companies. 
     Several volunteered the information, however, that it was a really serious problem with other companies in other cities.
          One Hears Many Stories.
     "I live in Fairfield, Conn., which has become known as the bedroom of Bridgeport because so many Bridgeport workers live there," one man said. "And the stories you hear up there about unjustifiable absences are enough to worry any one. I hear that one Bridgeport plant is actually giving our tickets for a money prize as workers file in on every shift. If a worker misses no time, he has a better chance to win the jackpot. Bingo! Just like that."
     England and Australia also are having trouble with seemingly unjustified absenteeism. Mr. McRury said today that in conducting that Conference Board program the investigating staff noted the success of one Australian war plant, employing women, in installing a beauty parlor on the premises. By letting the girls off for half or three-quarters of an hour for a beauty shop visit days of illness were cut dramatically. It seemed to prove the girls had been playing sick for whole days to keep appointments to have their hair done in beauty parlors far from the factory.
