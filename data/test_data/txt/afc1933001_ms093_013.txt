I asked for 25%
of the copyright
receipts. J.A.L.

April 17, 1942
Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax:
Your son, Mr. Alan Lomax, has advised
that I write you about securing
permission to use a tune, Stewball,
which appears in your American Ballads
and Folk Songs (pgs. 68-69) in a work
either for band or orchestra which I hope
to write sometime soon. I have several
folk tunes under consideration, some of which
like Stewball, are not in the public domain.
Use of one or all of these controlled tunes
will depend upon the willingness of the
respective copyright owners to grant
me permission to use their material.
May I hear from you soon?
Sincerely,
Gail Kubick
