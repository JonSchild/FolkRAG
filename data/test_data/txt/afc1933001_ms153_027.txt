Dear Mrs. Wright: 
I greatly enjoyed your interesting letter regarding 
square dancing in the North and South and have put it on 
file in the Library of Congress Archive of American Folk 
Song as a useful document. 
My reason for asking for information over the air was 
the establish contact with people all over the country interested 
in folk songs and to assist in our project of building 
up a National collection in Washington. I should like 
very much to record the tunes you learned in northern New 
York and to find through you other fiddlers and singers in 
that region. Once these records are in the collection of 
the Library they have all sorts of uses for artistic, educational
and historical purposes. Would you be interested in 
helping out? 
Thank you again for your charming letter. 
Sincerely yours, 

Alan Lomax
