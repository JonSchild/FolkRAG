Synge Aran Islands

This grief of the keen is no personal complaint
for the death of one woman
over 80 years, but seems to
contain the whole passionate
rage that lurks somewhere in
every native of this island.  In
this cry of pain the inner
consciousness of the people seems
to lay itself bare for an instant
and to reveal the mood of
beings who feel their isolation
in the face of a universe that wars
on them with winds + seas. They
are usually silent, but in the
presence of death shriek with
pitiable despair before the
horror of the fate to which they
are all doomed.
