Old man -2

When I got to lay down and die-AAH,
O Lord, O Lord.
(THE OLD MAN BEGINS TO SOB IN A PASSION OF SORROW.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
(THE CONGREGATIONS MOANS WITH HIM...
You know I can't help from loving you
Beacause you loved me, yourself,
Long before I knew what love was...
And when my time has come,
I've got a king's crown in coming glory.
And when I come down to the river,
Help me to pull off my war coat and enter
I'll enter in the name of the Lord
And make my enemies out a liar...
(A WOMAN BEGAN TO SHRIEK STEADILY AND RHYTHMICALLY,
PITCHING AROUND IN THE ARMS OF THE USHERS LIKE 
A FISH ON A HOOK AS THE OLD MAN WAILED OUT THE
LAST PHRASES OF HIS PRAYER IN A HIGH PITCHED
CHILD'S DESPAIR...

(THE REVEREND H.T. JAMES OF LULA AROSE AFTER THE CONGREGATION
HAD SUNG "A LITTLE TALK WITH JESUS" AND PRAYED FOR TEN MORE MINUTES.
HIS VOICE AT THE BEGINNING WAS A RICH CONFIDENT BARITONE BUT AS
HE REACHED THE CLIMAX OF HIS PRAYER HE WAS HOWLING A HIGH NASAL
CRY THAT SHIVERED YP YOUR SPINE, MAKING LONG MUSICAL YELLS
THAT TORE THE HEARTS OF THE WOMEN...

O lord
Don't leave us.
Don't leave us.
Please suh, don't leave us.
PLEASESUH
Stay here on the streets with us.
Keep alcohol out of our mouths,
Keep the old bitter beer out of our lips,
Havemercy on us.
Walk beside us as a light,
Guidx our feet as our protector.
O---o----o----o-- Lord
(A SOUND LIKE A SIREN, WAVERING, MOUNTING...
The congregation is on its feet...
Please suh,
Bless thy manservant tonight,
Please sire, God, hear us,
Please suh, throw out the life line,
And now Lord, will you, Please suh,
Please suh,
Get ready to go on home with us,
Get holt of the steering gear
And guide us down the road.
O----o-----o------o Lord,
When the war is ended,
When the battle is well fought,
And the victory is won,
Please suh,
