Dear Professor Chappel:

The Archive of American Folk Song, has this year received
funds to enable it to duplicate some of the best collections of records
in private hands. I recall that a number of years ago you bought a
recording machine, and I presume that you have made a good many fine
records. Would you be willing for us to duplicate these records for
our collection, and on what basis? Of course, our object eventually
is to make them available to the scholarly public.

We have acquired an excellent duplicating laboratory, and are
now in a position to help preserve recordings of all kinds.

I should like, at any rate, to know about your work because
it may be that we could be of some practical assistance.

Cordially yours,

Alan Lomax
