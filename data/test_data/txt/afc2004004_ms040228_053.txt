[*Penguin / Broadsides*]

A new song called 
Canada Heigho!!
Its of a merchants daughter lived in her prime of years,
She fell in love with a sailor bold, its true she loved him dear,
But how to get on board with him this lady did know,
For she longed to see that lovely place called Canada heigho.

She bargained with the sailors all for a purse of gold,
Immediately they did comply to put her in the hold,
Saying we'll dress you up in sailors clothes the Captain will not know,
And soon you'll see that lovely place called Canada heigho.

But when her lover heard of it he flew into a rage,
With him the crew and passengers were unwilling to engage,
I'll tie your hands and feet he said and overboard you go,
For you ne'er shall see that lovely place called Canada heigho.

Its when this lady heard him her heart was filled with woe,
She said you false-hearted young man why do you say so,
I left my friends for love of you, not one of them did know,
And now you wish to drown me going to Canada heigho.

But when the Captain heard of it he wept most bitterly
Saying if you drown this fair one sir, hanged you must be,
I'll leave her in the cabin whilst the stormy winds do blow,
And soon we'll see that lovely place called Canada heigho.

After ploughing the raging sea the weather got calm and clear,
The Captain fell in love with her and married her we hear,
Now she's dressed in silk and satin and bears a gallant show,
And now she's a Captain's lany in Canada heigho.

Now all you pretty fair maids a lesson take by me,
Always follow your true-love when he is going to sea,
For if there is one who proves false some other will prove true,
Now see what honour I have gained by wearing of the blue.
