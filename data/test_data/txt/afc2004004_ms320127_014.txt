W.M.   -13

like, I like this, my, my one purpose in playing music is to
meet and great friends, old people, young and alike.  I,
I've met a lot of wonderful old people.  I've learned from,
from them.  And they always say the older the wiser.  And
you can, you can get some good information and real tips on,
on, from being that have been here a little bit longer
than you are.

LOMAX  Would you give us the words of one
of the best of the songs and translate it a little bit for
us?  Like one of the songs about hardship [UNCLEAR]?

W.M.  Most, most of them, it, it's that
maybe a girl that went, went, something went wrong in her
love life and she left him for somebody and he's crying.

LOMAX  [UNCLEAR] . . .in French and then
tell us in English, one song.

W.M.  Well, now you got me on the spot.
I, I know so many that it, it's hard to pick out one.

LOMAX  Pick one that you [UNCLEAR]

W.M.  Like [FRENCH] sung like I'll pass
in front of your door, I'll wave, I. . . .

LOMAX  Say it in French first.

W.M.  [FRENCH]  And that, that's the
actual words to the song.  You just sing that to the tune.

LOMAX  What does that mean in English?

W.M.  I passed in front of your door.  I
waved bye.  Nobody answered my wave.  Oh, how my heart
hurts.  That, that's, that's that in a nutshell.
