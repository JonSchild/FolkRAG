classes of people. The interviewer will use rough rating scales in 
evaluating whatever pertinent personality characteristics may be 
involved in individual diagnoses. The interviewer will collect
sufficient information about his informants to permit the application
of the following diagnostic formula:

R = Interest (latent attitudes + specific interest + personality)/
News (objective availability + subjective satisfaction)

In the above equation
R = the amount of rumor

Interest may be determined by such factors and ratings as:
prejudice rating, index of social participation, index of in-
terest in war, ratings on allies, degree of in-group identifica-
tion, ethnic characteristics, classes, etc.

News may be determined by such factors as: newspaper and radio
analysis in the community, rating on level of information, rating 
on confidence in news, degree of satisfaction with news coverage, 
ability of the news to explain a person's tensions to himself.

It is hoped that the study will produce what might be termed second-hand
case studies of the "secondary interviewees", which will permit the
application of the same formula in a generalized or mass sense.

Following the pre-test it is propose to construct a short questionnaire
based on the rumors collected during the pre-test. This questionnaire
will be used interviews of as many persons as possible in each 
community. The data thus gathered can be used to check he reliability
of the information given by the informant families and individuals, as
well as to supplement the total qualitative picture.

Nature of the Sample. Two seaboard communities, New Brunswick, New 
Jersey, and Portland, Maine, will be studied intensively. These two
were chosen because they are roughly equivalent in size and in their 
proximity to large metropolitan centers. Both are largely engaged in 
the production of war goods, thus providing the homogeneity useful in 
handling the small sample planned. Yet the two cities are far enough 
apart geographically to avoid possible limitations due to local 
idiosyncrasies. 

Three interviewers will work for two weeks in each city. 


Relationship to Data Collected by Other Field Staffs. During the first
week of this study, other field staffs which are operating on a national
scale also will collect rumors. The results of this study may be ex-
pected to be of value in interpreting the total rumor situation.

Dates of the Study. Pre-test, in both New Brunswick and Portland, from
July 28 to August 1. Interviewing in the two cities from August 3 to 
August 15.
