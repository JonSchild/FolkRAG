Don't call Lillian where she live
For not one all you cut out Coya belly.

All you goin out talkin, but this thing is very funny
Gus come down here, t'inks he gonna get a lot of money

Two kerosene pan of oil,
Make Donald have Dulcie big with child

Yes, they ma' talks 'bout Mariam an' me nine,
That's the first white man I see a knods drum

Tipperary - mumbled
[I am a] All you young working men 
[All you young]
[I am a]
[I think laborer]
I think should be happy,
