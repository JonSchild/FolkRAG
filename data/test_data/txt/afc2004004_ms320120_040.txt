REVON REED   -13
REED  Been a challenge and a dare and at
the same time something that some people didn't think could
be done, you know.  And always pessimism on us.  Some said
that the language itself would be dead 45 years and that was
35 years ago and it's more alive today than its ever been I
think, as a second language.  And the Cajun finally got his
pride back and his original language.  And that's one of the
reasons that I came back in 1946.  Influenced a little bit
by the Spanish-American, New Mexico, where I'd been
teaching, where I saw they were guarding their own culture
and language almost [hearsay] when we tried to bring down
the barrier of the Spanish people in the ground school.
They rebelled violently against it.  Came down here in
Louisiana and found it just the opposite.  They were looking
forward to it almost.  And everybody thought that was a,
just another dead language, almost a dead relating language.
And until 1946 when your GIs came back from World War II and
saw the value of a second language did they start more or
less fighting for it.
     So here I am after twenty-one years, still
kicking.  And I hope to go on to tackle [UNCLEAR] more.  I
enjoy it.  It's an imense pleasure to me up to now.

REED  Yes, I would say more like a 
[UNCLEAR] type thing.  Some of the stuff we can't translate
in French it got to come out in English, you know.  Sort of
