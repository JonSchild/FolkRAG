Things that I have heard about the war.
1 - Hitler is dead.
2 - The U.S is losing more men than they are admitting
3 - That the U.S is going to invade France by way of the
Carribean Sea.
4 - That Germany will be the first ones to surrender.
After the Germans surrender we will have to put
an end to the Japanese.
5 - That the war will last for five years.
