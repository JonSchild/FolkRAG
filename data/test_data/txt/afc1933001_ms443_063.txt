[The Shreveport Jail] ?

L.B. Speaks: This here's a song [I made up] about [the] de Shreveport jail.---
An' when de judge sentence you, you down in de valley.---
I made this song when I was down on Angola.-- I was down in de
valley so low I could not [here] hear them Shreveport trains blow.
I was in the field workin' hard , late one even'n. -- I'gin to 
think about Shereveport, Lou'siana.----I think about how de
lawyer done me.--- I think about how the sher[r]if put me in jail.
I begin to sit down [then] there an' make up me an' ol' song.----

L.B. Sings: Way down in de valley
In the valley so low,
'Til I jes' could not hear that
Evenin' train whistle blow.

When you write me a letter,
Please send it by mail,
You can send it all over,
That Shreveport jail.

Oh the Sher[r]iff, he will 'rest you,
Bound you over in jail,
Cain' get nobody
To go yo' bail.

[Spoken:]
L.B. Speaks: You git a lawyer for your friend. -- An' when you come to find
out yourself, you'se somewhere wid a thousan' years in de pen.

L.B. Sings: Send for yo' lawyer,
Come down to yo' cell,
He'll swear he can clear you
In spite of all Hell.

Git some O' yo' money,
Come back for de res',
Tell you to plead guilty,
For he know it is bes'.

There sit de judge-- you ain' thinkin' 'bout him-- you got to go
befo( de judge---- he done turnt you loose, got all the money dat
