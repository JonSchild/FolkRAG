Joke

A soldier from up North returned
to an Arkansas camp from his
first weekend leaves.
"The slow Southern drawl is right
up my alley," he reported with
delight. "You ask a little Rock girl
to kiss you and, before she can

To Market, to market
To buy a rib roast â€” 
Home again, home again
Shrimps on toast!
Meat rationing
