John. Lomax, Esq.
University Station
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This will acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt of
your recent wire and of your letters of the 6th and 8th.
Your report I have forwarded to Mr. Engel, who will make
the necessary cuts and changes. I am sorry to have had
to make so urgent a matter of this, but after two unsuccessful
attempts to reach you I begin to fear that you
might not receive my reminder until after copy was due
at the printers.

Work on the printing and mailing of your letter to
prison officials can begin just as soon as you send us
your draft and list of addresses.

With kindest greetings to Alan and belated congratulations
to you,

Cordially,

Chief, Division of Music
