Dear Mrs.Hillery:

I was very pleased to know that you are interested in bringing
the Folk Song Festival to our city.This type of thing,as you
know,I am very interested in and would do everything possible
to help make a success.

Here at Sslden Park we can acco[m]modate about 2,000 people.There
is plenty of parking room and plenty of area around the 55 acre
track.

Radio station W G I G has a studio here at Selden Park and I am
in charge of that.I am sure that W G I G with 5000 watts AM and FM
would spare nothing in helping to put the show on.

I have talked to the county Administrator who has pledged his support.

If you can give us the dates you wish our program can be so arranged 
and scheduled that you will have the use of our facilities with
unlimited time.The cost 10 per cent of the gross receipts.

Trusting that thisn will meet with your approval and looking to hear from
you very soon,I am

very truly yours,
