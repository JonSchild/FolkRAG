I. Relations to Russia are complicated by Britain. 

38. "Britain is telling us what to do about the war. That's why we're not doing anything to help Russia." (Minnesota)

39. "You know a friend told me something the other day that I think is about right. He says that they are just playing Russia against Germany, letting them decimate themselves; b ut if it hadn't been for Russia, last year, England would have fallen; they would have had the English fleet, and the Axis would have licked us sure by this time." (Louisiana)

40. "I understand that England has about three or four million well trained soldiers. They are claiming that if they sent their soldiers to aid Russia, Germany would invade England and capture it without much trouble. I Agree with some of the boys at the plant that we should send a few million of our soldiers over to England and tell them that we will guard England for them and then they can send their soldiers to help Russia. It seems to me that the English are looking out for England and for themselves." (Colorado)

41. "England doesn't want the war to end now b ecause Russia would be too powerful and have too much to say at the peace conference." (Ohio)
