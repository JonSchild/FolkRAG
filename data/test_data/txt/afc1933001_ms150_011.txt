Dear Mr. Lomax:

In connection with our weekly American School of
the Air broadcasts on American Folk music, I wonder
if it would be possible for you to borrow for us
some of the orchestral scores owned by the government?
We should like to be able to have the Columbia Broadcasting
System symphony play these works on the broadcasts.
I am thinking particularly now of Virgil Thompson's
arrangement for orchestra of "The Buffalo Skinners" that
was used in the motion picture "The Plow That Broke the
Plains". If possible we should like to have you bring
the score and parts with you when you come to New York
next Sunday. I hope you can think of number of other
government controlled works of this nature that we may
use in the future.

Sincerely,
William H. Fineshriber, Jr.
Program Division
