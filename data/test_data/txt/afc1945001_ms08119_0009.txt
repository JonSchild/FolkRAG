Jones, Richard
There was an Irish-man
and a Jew. Both who were
inducted in the army. Because
the Jew could not forget the 
business he had just left 
he would not fight. 
The colonel put a sargent
over this Jew and with-in
a few weeks the Jew
had many medals for
good fighting.
The colonel asks the
sargent how he got 
the Jew to fight his 
answer was this. "I
told him, your in 
business for yourself 
now."

The other day
I got into
a horse and 
buggy and I 
wanted the
driver to 
take me to
the meat
market but 
he couldn't
get the horse
to go.
