        Sometimes desire to be authoritative and complete leads to
a complexity of presentation in the course of which the [hub] of the
argument is overlooked. [and] As the following [illustration] illustrates, under such
circumstances, there [is] may still be no answer to the rumor, we still don't know whether
the scrap rubber will be used.
                "RUMOR--Much of the scrap rubber recent collected will
                never be used.
                "FACT--In last Sunday's Rumor Clinic, John I. Taylor, Jr., 
                of the Conservation Department, New England Regional
                Office, WPB, 17 Court Street, Boston, pointed out that so
                much of this scrap rubber still is seen in piles about
                New England because reclamation plants, even though now
                processing scrap rubber at the rate of one ton every
                minute, will be working the remainder of this year before
                they can utilize all the scrap collected. The rumor has
                been more widespread than was at first apparent and now
                from Mr. Taylor's office comes this further information:
                'In practically every case the scrap rubber piles are being
                held for disposal of the government. Representatives of
                WPB, all of them thoroughly experienced in the scrap rubber
                business, are inspecting scrap yards belonging to leading
                dealers in every section of the country. Their reports
                indicate that nearly 100 percent of the dealers so far
                visited have either sold or agreed to sell their whole
                stock of rubber scrap to the rubber company of the RFC,
                and to start the scrap on its way to rubber reclaiming
                plants as soon as the Rubber Reserve Company issues shipping
                instructions. Dealers have been told by the Rubber Reserve
                Company not to load freight cars until full shipping instructions 
                have been received. As a consequence many scrap
                piles now belonging to the government remain unmoved in
                dealers' yards."

        One well-known rumor column started its masthead with the following:
"Some of the most dangerous, false[,] rumors now in circulation are examined
and answered by competent and official authority in the ----- ------ today.
A lead like this [greatly] implies that the rumors are very dangerous and
that not all of the[m] most dangerous are being selected for answer. That

citizens must be very alert. We cannot urge too strongly the need for
