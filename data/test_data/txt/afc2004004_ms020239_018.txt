TL:  You use the bark for children?
BJ:  I use the bark.  I just cut the bark an' cut it down.  Don't 
cut it up; cut it down.
TL:  Down?
BJ:  Yeah.
TL: 
BJ:  Well, let it down, when you cut it.  Jus' don't, don't cut it. . .
TL:  What happens if you cut it up?
BJ:  Well, jus', that's jus' what I was jus' trained to do that.
I don't know what, what the trouble is, but that's what they say,
always cut it down.  You want sumpin' to come down, see?  You want
the worms to come out.  You don't want 'em to go up.
     An' so, then ya take it an' ah, then ya take, an' boil it an'
make a tea out a it.  Or either make syrup.  An' make -- put it
in syrup?  An' make ah, candy out of it, see?  Boil it first then
put syrup into it?  An' make a candy for the chilren to eat.  See, it's,
the same way you would -- an' they jus' eat it then, ya
know, 'cause it don't taste good.  But they jus' eat it then, 'cause
it's candy, see?

of it.  See?
