     All material dealt with by a local rumor control project is to be considered 
"confidential" in the strict sense of the term. Material should be released only 
through the project director, or as specifically directed by him. It should be 
recognized that phones are choice conversation pieces and give an individual an
opportunity to show he is on the inside and knows many things that others do not
know. He should be especially careful to avoid using his position in the project in
this unwarranted fashion.
     Where the need for guidance or aid is felt by an established local rumor
control project, remember that the Office of War Information has been dealing with
rumors on a national scale continuously. If local projects need help with local rumors
the OWI is in a position to provide aid.
