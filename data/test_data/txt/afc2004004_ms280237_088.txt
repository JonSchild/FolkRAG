TAPE 91:::::::::HARRY COX.
Stormy Old Weather:
1) Up jumped the herring the queen of the sea,
He sang out, "Old skipper, oh you can't catch me"
Rerain: In this stormy old weather,
Windy old weather,
When the wind blows, we'll all pull together.
2) Up jumped the mackeral with spots on his back.
He sang out, "Old skipper, you're on the wrong track."
3) Up jumped the sprat, the smallest of all,
He sang out, "Old skipper come haul your trawl haul."
4) Up jumped the crab with his great long claws,
He sang out, "Old skipper, you'll run her ashore."
5) Up jumped the rooker his back hard and tough,
He sang out, "Old steward, you will burn the duff."
6) Up jumped the mackerel with spots on his back.
He sang out, "Old skipper, come square your main tack."
That's all I know of that.
Lomax: Where does it come from?
Cox: I don't know where it do come from. It keeps following song
like that. The herring, the queen of the sea. That's the start. The
Queen. I think that's the landing one.
Lomax: And was this sung by fishermen round where you lived?
Cox: Well, I have heard them sing it. It's more of a sea-going song.
Theres the whiting with silvery eyes comes in somehwre.
Brisk Young Ploughboy.
1) It's of a brisk young ploughboy, he was ploughing on the plain,
And his horses stood down in yonder shade,
It was down in yonder grove he went whistling to his plough,
And by chance there he met a pretty maid, pretty maid,
And by chance there he met a pretty maid.
2) So the song that they sang as they walked along
"Pretty maid, oh you are of high degree.
If I should fall in love and your parents they should rpove,
O the next thing, they would send me to the sea."
3) So when her aged parents they came for to know,
That her love he was a ploughboy on the plain,
They sent for the pressgang and pressed her love away,
And they sent him to the wars to be slain.
