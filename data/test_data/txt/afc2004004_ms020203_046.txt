V: I did. I always did sing, sing the play songs that we
played. Something like "Young Speckled Lady" and "Did you
Go to the College"--- they'd always want me to sing it
or say it, when it was something have to be led, they want
me to say it.
A: What are these songs you were just talking about?
V: Young Speckled Lady. Well, we'd ring up all in a ring,
ketch hold of hands and I'd start singin, well, we'd start
skippin...
There's a young speckled lady,
Shool-do,
She's just from the country,
Shool-do,

Golden needle
and a brass-eyed thimble.

O Miss Matty
Fly Way over yonder.

You, too, Miss Sady,
You, too, Miss Mattie...

We'd play like that and when I'd call those names of those
children, they'd fly from this side to that one. They'd be
just flyin when I called em like that. Everybody would say
"Shool-do" and I would give out the words. We'd play that for
a long time and then we'd play--"Ridin in the buggy". I 
did love that song, I used to do.

I'm ridin in a buggy,
O yes, o yes,
It's a golden bright buggy,
O yes oyes.

Stop still and let me tell you,
Now choose you two partners.

And I wants a good rappin
