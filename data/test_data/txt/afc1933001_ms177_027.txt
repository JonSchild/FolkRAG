Mrs. J. E. Bright
304 Riverside Drive
Santa Paula, Calif.

Dear Mrs. Bright:

   Your letter of December 1 has been 
referred to the Music Division for attention
and report.

   I greatly appreciate your writing
about the songs that your grandmother
knows.  Would it be possible for you
to send copies of the texts of these
songs to Alan Lomax, Assistant in
Charge of the Archive of American
Folk-song, so that he may judge of the
value of the material?  It certainly
seems worth recording, and I hope you
will, if possible, write down the
tunes as well as the texts.

   We certainly are interested in
obtaining old folk songs.

   For the Librarian of Congress,

      Sincerely yours,

      Harold Spivacke, Chief
      Division of Music
