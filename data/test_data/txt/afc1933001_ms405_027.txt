And when no one was sick and the girls didn't have dates, there
might be a singing at home: Mrs. Gant, who taught them their songs a
and their love of singing, and who knew the saddest songs; the oldest
daughter, Glyda, who pretended to turn her nose up at the ballads
but could sing "The Old Lady from Tennessee" better than anybody else
in the family; Foy, who could pick the guitar as well as a man and
used to remind them of their times; Ella, who was twelve and knew
all the old tunes, especially the "funny ones"; the three boys, who
mostly sang the blues, the cowboy songs, and the jailhouse ballads;
Mr. Gant, who had one song, "Bangum and the Boar," over which his
rights were almost personal; and then on the beds, leaning against
someone's knee or breast, were the tow-headed Gant kids, listening,
falling asleep, and waking up to listen again.
"The singing kep us so happy, we just couldn't go to sleep,"
smiled Mrs. Gant.
Gant songs in this book: "Tee Roo, "Adieu to the Stone Walls,"
