TAPE:  Roll 22  Burton Cove p. 1
(Technical)
Woman:  How about you singing "Four Nights Drunk?"
Woman:  Alright (sings):  "I came home the other night as drunk as
I could be/ Now I saw a horse in the stable where my horse ought
to be./  Said come here. . ."  No. . .maybe you could grow in the
patch. . .cabbage. . .that started up singing a better head than a
cabbage patch.(???)  Cass, why don't you sing that preacher's song,
"Jerusalem Mourns?"
Cass:  "When I first come to. . ."  . . . .
AL:  The important thing is that after the song is over, kinda chip
in a little bit.  I shouldn't be chipping in from the back, come
in and say something:  (unint) or talk about the thing, that's
the best thing, thing about what to say. . .
Woman:  Yeah, we could think of plenty to say about that, about
love.
Cass:  Well, I didn't have my car then, and I'd get me a girl maybe,
walk around with her, some man would come around with a car and
beat me out of her.  So I'd have to go around a long time before
I found another one maybe.  And when I'd meet up with a girl, we'd
go chesnut hunting; we'd start up a ridge, chesnut hunting, sit
down and rest, talk.  Lots of quirrel runnin' up trees and things.
Sing some old love-ballad songs.  We'd talk about how we loved one
another and all.  And, that was the way we courted back then.
Had a good time.
