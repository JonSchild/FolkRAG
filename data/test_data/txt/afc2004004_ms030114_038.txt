Oh Delia why don't you run, here comes the high sheriff with a 44 Gatlin' gun.
All the friends I had are gone.

Take old Delia to the cemetary, bring me a rubbered tired hack.
Put her in the ground, poor girl she could never get back.
All the friends I had are gone.
Q:  Why did the sheriff shot her?
A:  He didn't get a chance to shoot her!  She did get kind of hard-headed,
she wouldn't run.
Q:  Did alot of people sing that song in the South?
A:  Yes.
     Delia I'm bound to take you life,
     You've caused trouble between me and my wife.
     All the friends I had are gone.
Q:  Did Blind Boy Fuller sing tunes like that?
A:  I never heard him sing this.  Fuller didn't know nothing.  He wasn't
a guitar player.  He would have been something if I could have kept him
under me.
Q:  How come he didn't stay with you.
A:  He felt like going out on his own.  I couldn't just exactly tell now.
Q:  What about BABY, LET ME FOLLOW YOU DOWN?
A:  That came out in 1925.
Q:  Tell me about WEST COAST BLUES by Blind Blake?  What's the trick to play that.
A:  IT's the bass you touch that makes
it roll.  It ain't that hard.  Blake could play that thing.  He could play.
Q:  What advice would you give to guitar students.
A:  You know you can't give a two weeks old baby peas and corn-bread.
You got to give it what its able to eat.  Lot of people come here wanting
me to teach them things but they're not able to stand up to it.
Q:  What about Soldier's Drill?  When did you write it?
A:  Let's see - way before I got married the first time.  Before I knew anything
about marrying a woman.  Way back.  1918.
