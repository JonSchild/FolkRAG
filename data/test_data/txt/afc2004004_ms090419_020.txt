Now this preacher he live right in the community
where he's pastoring. He was a man raise a lot of hogs. One of
his deacons, his main deacon, would slip over there every once
in a while at night and steal one of the preacher's hogs.

And this [preacher] deacon had a little boy. He never carry
that boy at church. Make him stay at home[x] on Sunday. Didn't
buy him no clothes to go to church in. So the little boy found
out his daddy was stealin the preacher's hogs, and one Sunday,
when the preacher was taking dinner with deacon, the little
boy sat down in the yard, playing, looked up and seen the preacher
coming. He started to sing. . .

Poppa stole the preacher's hogs,
We got plenty plenty pork now.

So the preacher stopped, you know, and listened. He
thought he caught it at first, but he wanted to make sure. So
he walked a little closer and the little boy was watching him
under his eyelids and [continued to sing] kept on singing. . .

Poppa stole the preacher's hogs,
We got a plenty-a pork now.
The preacher walked up--"Howdy, son."
"All right. How're you, revrun?"
"What's that song you singin?"
"O it ain't nothin--just a little song I sing."
"Well, would you promise to come to church tonight
and sing that song?"
"Yessir, I could come out there and sing it, but I
ain't got no shoes to wear."
Say, "I'll buy you some shoes."
Say, "I ain't got no suit."
