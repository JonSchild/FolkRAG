THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND
My parents reared my tenderly, they had no child but me,
My mind being bent on rambling, with them could not agree,
So soon became a rover, which grieved their hearts full sore,
I left my aged parents, I ne'er will see them more.

There lived a wealthy farmer in the country close by,
He had a lovely daughter and on her I'd cast my eye;
She was noble-minded, tall, beautiful and fair,
With Columbia's loveliest daughters she truly could compare.

I told her my intentions was to cross the main,
And asked if she would be true to me until I return again;
Great drops of tears stood in her eyes, her bosom heaved a sigh,
"Dear Youth," says she, "fear not for me, my love will never die."

But somewhere I have heard or read that which I cannot believe,
That distance breaks the links of love and leaves the maid to grieve;
I fondly clasped her to my breast and kissed away the tears,
And I swore by Him above the skies that I would be sincere.

According to agreement then, I went on board the ship
And to the town of Glasgow I had a pleasant trip;
I found that gold was plenty there, and girls were free and kind,
And my thoughts began to cool a bit for the girl I left behind.

For Dumfries town I next set out, that hospitable land,
Where handsome Jennie Ferguson she took me by the hand;
She says, "I've gold in plenty and love for you I find."
And the thoughts of gold destroyed my love for the maid I left behind.

She says, "If you'll marry me and say no more you'll rove,
The gold that I've got is yours, and I will faithful prove;
But friends or relations that you have left behind,
You never, if you marry me, again must bear in mind.

To this I soon consented, I own it to my shame,
For what man can be happy when he knows he is to blame?
It's true I've gold in plenty, my wife is somewhat kind,
But my pillow still is haunted bu the friends I left behind.

My father in his winding sheet, my mother, too appears;
The girl I loved seems by their sides, a kissing away their tears;
Of broken hearts they all have died and now too late I find
That God has seen my cruelty to the girl I left behind.
