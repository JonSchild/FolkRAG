Yesterday afternoon on the I.C. train I overheard two middle-aged 
women talking about the War. They were about 50 years old and well-dressed.
I judged that they lived in South Shore.

One of them was saying that she had heard from a friend who had
it from a reliable source that our government was holding a large part
of our Army in this country because we were planning to invade Russia as
soon as the Red Army beat the Germans.

The other said she hadn't heard that this was our official
policy but that she thought it was a good policy since obviously we would
have to fight Russia after this War.

Then they talked about their children. One of them was worried
because her son who was married was soon going to be drafted. The other
said that she had heard that if one knew the right people one could always
get an Army Commission. They both agreed on this and went on to talk
of the sons of friends who had received Commissions.


When I was making a purchase at one of the department stores I
overheard two middle-aged saleswomen talking. They were discussing the
fact that starting the next week deductions would be made from their pay
to purchase War Savings Stamps and Bonds.  One said to the other "Between 
bonds and hospital insurance, I'll have to go without lunch to make ends
meet."

The other said, "That's right. But wait until they start the
Liberty Loan drive."

The first said, "Do you think they're going to have one?"

I could not overhear any more of this conversation. It seemed
to me that these women were very unfavorable to having deductions made
from their checks for Savings Bonds.
