Lomax: Where they handsome people?
Jean: The brawest looking people.
Lomax: Women beautiful? Any famous beauties among them?
Jean: Oh yes.  Very nice looking people amongst them - there
was that.  My father's mother herself was a small woman, but they
called her Bonnie Annie when she was little.  She was yellow -
haired.  But she had a family of seven sons alivec- she had
sixteen of a family - but she'd seven sons alive, and everyone
of them was very, very handsome.  Not that I ever saw but one,
for they all died before ever I seed them.  But what I've heard
hundreds of people talking about.  Lovely to look at - everyone
of them.  But they all died at a very young age.  My father was
very, very handsome.
Lomax: What did he look like?
Jean:  He was tall, broad-shouldred, and a manly looking man --
but a weakness for drink.  Very fine-faced.
Lomax: When you say he had a weakness for drink....
Jean: Well, as far as I'm led to believe, my father couldn't live
without it.  That's what killed him at such a young age.  You see
he had been very drunk at a very bad night, and he went into the
graveyard and lied down.  Well, he knew he was safe after all.
Then he catched a severe chill that killed him within 24 hours.
Lomax: Your mother - I suppose whe wasn't too surprised when he
died so early.  She'd been expecting it from the way he lived.
Jean: Well, of course, my mother had always been feared of it.
And naturally she liked her husband.  Because after I grew up, I
began to ask about my father amongst other people, and men has
told me how good he was.  He was that good living, even suppose
he was a drunkard.  He'd very fine manners -- very refined he was.
He wasn't a rough man even suppose he was a drunkard.  And
very good to children.  And if there were twenty children at a
fire and he'd only one apple, he would halve it amongst those
bairns - that was his nature.  And he would help any other body.
He was very good-natured.  Never quarreled.
Lomax: Your mother must have picked him out among hundreds, didn't she?
Jean: Oh yes.  My mother was a handsome woman.  Anybody could tell
ye that.  And my father was a handsome a man.
Lomax: Did her family oppose them getting married?
Jean: Oh - they didn't want him because he was a drunkard.  Then he
was ten years older.
Lomax: I see.  But your mother didn't care.
