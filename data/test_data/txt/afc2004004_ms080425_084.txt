[Man   this]    (TECHNICAL)

[McGraw*] [Man]:    This is a spring that's next to Holly Springs Church.
This is the reason the church is named Holly Springs.
There's a spring here on this side of the church, and
there's a big one on the other side of the church also.
The one on the other side furnishes two houses.   This
one here has furnished several houses, and there's
always fresh water.  The young people would come down
here at recess and hold hands and get a drink, . . . 
and they'd get to walk with a girlfriend to the spring.
It's good water . . .  we cleaned it up 2 or 3 (?) times.
(TECHNICAL) . . . This is clear mountain water from HOLLy
Springs. . . . .   There has been no cultivation here, and no
houses close (?). . .  These are poplar trees and hickory
trees, and it's very pretty in the springtime.

AL:    It's very pretty now.  Out on the hill you got I-20
don't ya?

Man:    I-20 and 27 crosses right here.   Canyou imagine this
church, settin' on the valuable property it's settin'
on -- right next to two great highways, and there's about
8 acres there that won't be made into anything but Holly
Springs church and cemetary. . .The original church was
a log church, settin' right over here where the picnic
table is now.  This church was built in 1903.  It's a
Primitive Baptist Church and they have service here about
once a month, on the fourth Sunday of each month.
That's the reason a lot of the singin's are held at
Primitive Baptist churches, because the church is vacant
three Sundays a month. a lot of them has it on the first
Sunday, [an the] 2nd Sunday, and 3rd Sunday, and 4th Sunday
