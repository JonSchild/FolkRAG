Dear Mrs. Roosevelt - 
I wrote to you a few 
weeks ago and received an acknowledgement 
from Miss Thompson. 
This time, I confess, 
I write in much the same 
state of mind as previously.

Perhaps I am allowing 
myself to become obsessed 
with a relatively unimportant 
phase of the war we must 
fight; it does seem terribly 
necessary to me, though, to 
correct the "un - thoughtful"
