Lomax: But some of the diddling has words to it, I notice.
Like "Warp and Row." or one of those tunes.
Jean: "Warp and Row" did you call it? It's "Hop and Row."
"Hop and row, hop and row,
Hop and row the viddies o't.
I didna ken I had a wife
Until I had the viddies-o". . . . . .That's pipe airs, too.
Lomax: Isn't there another part to that song?
Jean: O there's lots to that song, and some people has it
different, you see. I canna remember it.
Lomax: What makes a good singer?
Jean: Well ---- if you have the proper airs. If your air's nae good,
I don't think you could make a good singer. Aye, of old songs.
You've got to have the natural air.
Lomax: You have to have a terrific ability to remember things, too.
Jean: Oh yes. But still, if you have the airs born in your blood
it canna help but come out if you hear it, if you've the ear at all
Lomax: How long does it take you to learn a song?
Jean: It doesna take me long to learn a song. Even when I was
young I could learn a song anytime. If I heard the air once. Once
I got the air thew words were nothing. I'm no saying now - because
my head's nae sa clear now. My head's thicker. Last night Peter
asked for an Irish song and I wouldna care -- it's not what you
would say an original song - and that song was my favourite and
I've sung it thousands of times - and look - i tried about a 
hundred times to sing that song, and he wanted it because he liked
it. . . .and I couldna get that song. Started a bit - forgot a part --
got that part then forgot the other bit!
Lomax: Now when you were a girl you'd learn the air - then how
would you learn the words?
Jean: I maybe heard some of the old people singing a song. I'd
listen and then I hummed it two or three times. I would lock the
air to myself. Then once I had the air I would start to get the
words and maybe go to them and they would say the words, and I
would write it down.
Lomax: You'd write the words down - you wouldn't memorize them by ear?
Jean: Sometimes. But I would write them down, too.
Lomax: I've met people who could learn a song the first time they
heard it - the whole thing. One repetition and they had it.
Jean: Only heard it once sung? O they had a master mind then.
Lomax: Long ballads, too!
