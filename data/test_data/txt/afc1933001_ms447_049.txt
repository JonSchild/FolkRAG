I FEEL LIKE MY TIME AIN'T LONG

1 Oh, de hearse keep a-rollin' somebody to de graveyard,
Oh, de hearse keep a-rollin' somebody to de graveyard,
Oh, de hearse keep a-rollin' somebody to de graveyard,
O Lord, I feel like my time ain't long.

2 Oh, my mother outrun me, an' she gone on to glory,
Oh, my mother outrun me, an' she gone on to glory,
Oh, my mother outrun me, an' she gone on to glory,
O Lord, I feel like my time ain't long.

3  Oh, hush cryin', Mary, you'll see your brother,
4  Lord, I know I'll see him resurrection mornin',
5  Oh, look a-here, Mary, I am the resurrection mornin',
6  Oh, the bell keep a-tonin', somebody is dyin',
7  Oh, my father outrun me, an' he gone on to glory,
8  Oh, my brother outrun me, an' he gone on to glory,

Climax to a sermon:

We're going home, where they ain't no shedding tears,
Where you can't hear the hum of sewing machines
Making the winding sheets for the dead,
It's home, home,
Don't have no backbiters,
Where liars can't go,
Where every day is Sunday and the congregation ain't never
dismissed,
It's home.
Got no high sheriff to ride in it,
No deputy to serve warrants.--
Many of you got a mother,
And ev'y morning she walks out on the battlements of glory.
A few more rising suns
And the silver tune'll be heard in my heart.

Now wait till I put on my gospel shoes,
Gwine to walk about Heaven an' tote de news.
When I gits to Heaven gwine take my stand,
Gwine to rassle with my Lord like a natchal man.

Two milk-white horses side by side,
Me an' my Jesus gwine take an evenin' ride;
Gwine to argy wid de Father an' chatter wid de Son,
Talk about de old world I come fum.
