This am the second strain of the "Animule Dance."

Well, the lion came through the door,
Ugh, you can tell that lion was posilutely sore,
"Let me in the hall?" What you gwine-a do?
I'm gwine-a break up this dog-gone animule ball; yes."
['{']
"Don't you think I want to dahnce,
Give me one more chahnce,"
And the lion give a roar,
Tore down that door,
Broke up the animule ball.

Yes, the monkey holler, "Run, I say."
Wild cat did the Bom bocher,
Tiger did the mooch,
And the elephant did the hootch-a-ma-cootch,
That panther [bear] did that eagle [?] and began to prance,
Way in the jungles at that animule dance.

You see, the "Animule Dance" was a number that was ages 
old. I wrote the number and ten thousand claimed it.  I don't 
believe it's ever been published, I don't guess it ever will be 
published. Or [But] maybe it will. Since so many claimed it, I 
thought I wouldn't try to claim it, but there is nobody ever 
been able to do it so far but myself.
Question: When did you write it?
Morton: Oh, that was wrote around 1906, right after the 
"New Orleans" was wrote and the "Winding Ball." Of course, that's 
an unknown tune right now, "Winding Ball", but it was a very big 
hit for [at] the time in New Orleans around the tenderloin district. 
That was one of the numbers I made a lot of money on, - "Winding 
Ball", - and I also made a lot of money on this number, too, which 
is known as "The Animule Dance." Of course, that means "animals."
