THE SEARCHLIGHT          3

Kilowatt Jitters
     The glum looks and the chastened demeanor
of our old pals, E. G. Bennett, Power Trust
fixer at Ogden, Stan Stephenson, Build Utah 
artist of Salt Lake City, and several kilowatt
executives, had us rather mystified last week.
     We could find no immediate reason for 
their troubled brows and their apprehensive
glances. But the riddle was cleared up when 
we learned that William C. Lewis, Jr., special 
investigator of the Securities & Exchange Commission, 
had paid a return visit to our lovely
city and had been seen gazing toward the 
Kearns Building in a contemplative manner.
It was believed that Lewis might be surveying 
the possibility of further kilowatt financing
of political hopefuls. The boys just weren't
sure what Bill had in mind.
     It's a good thing for the Government to 
look in on the kilowatt crew and its undisclosed
political agents once in a while. It keeps the 
lads in a repentant mood and tends to pro-

more a little involuntary purity in the Kearns
Building.
     The consent injunction, entered into with
such alacrity a few months ago by Mr. Gadsby's 
company, does not preclude criminal prosecution
of several worthies who rate themselves
as leaders of Utah's "best people".

     Investigation disclosed that outfits like
Utah Copper Company, Wild Willie O'Connor's 
smelting concern, ZCMI, and other wilful
corporations doing interstate business, have
violated Federal statutes prohibiting political
contributions.
     We wonder why the Department of Justice
hasn't shown a little interest in that phase of
the case? Does the Government propose to 
forget the misdeeds of Utah's ruling corporations
until after the war? Or, is Justice not
only "blind", but also deaf in that particular 
ear?

Rehearing Sought By Phone Company
     Arguments by the Telephone Company in
its petition for a rehearing in its toll rate case
were heard by the Public Service Commission
during the week. Since no new evidence was
submitted by the Company it is anticipated the 
Commission will deny the petition.
     The decision of the Commission against 
the Company in that case put an end to flagrant
discrimination against Utah toll users
as compared to interstate patrons. The estimated 
savings to the people of Utah total 
about $120,000 a year.
     A sample of the Company's discriminatory
charges was the rate of $1.25 from Salt Lake
City to Grand Junction, Colorado, as compared 
to a charge of $1.60 from Salt Lake to Thompsons,
Utah, a point about 70 miles west of
Grand Junction. In some instances California 
and Nevada points enjoyed lower interstate
tolls from Salt Lake City than St. George and 
other distant communities in this State.
     The Company's answer to the complaint of
the Commission include its gloomy fears that 
the Japs might gain the upper hand in the war
if the Company's rate structure were disturbed.

     The Commission didn't even smile. It 
seemed coldly indifferent to the Company's 
claim of international aspects in the case. It
was unanimous in its decision to leave that 
$120,000 a year in the flattened pockets of overexploited
Utahns.

costs down; maintain lower prices and higher
wage levels; operate clean and attractive
stores; and do a swell job of merchandising.
The anti-chains could follow the same line
with profit for themselves and the public.
     Anyhow, if the anti-chain boys get away 
with this Tax stunt to cripple their competitors,
we're going to insist that the Legislature
slap a heavy tax on the Tribune, the Telegram,
and the Deseret News. We don't like the competition - 
even if it is inferior. We propose
to claim that "Independent" newspapers cannot
survive without equalizing tax on the 
big boys.
