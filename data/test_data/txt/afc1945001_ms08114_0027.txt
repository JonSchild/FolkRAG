Hitlerism
Question: Why do the Germans have to go over into
Switzerland to have their teeth pulled?
Answer: Because they are not allowed to open their
mouths in Germany.

Der Furer
Fe Fi Fo Fum, Hitlers end will come,
Because he seems to be mighty dumb,
Then he tried to attack the United Nations,
He found out he had attacked a congregation,
So we're going to send him on a vacation.

Fe Fi Fo Fum, Hitlers end will come,
For only a paperhanger could be so dumb,
As to think that the world would holler heil,
When the proper word is heel.

The German army can march and tramp,
While the U.S. buys bonds and stamps,
Which puts our money in the proper place,
To pitch a tank in der furers face.

(John) - John Long.
(Official) - Do you think you are suitable for the army?
(John) - No, Sir.
(Official) - Why?
(John) - Because I am cripple.
(Official) - How did you walk before you were hurt?
(John) - Like this: (he walks straight).
(Official) - You will make a fine soldier because
you are not cripple now.

A Joke
I saw a man who were always crying,
I asked him why were he always crying,
He said he lost no. 17 stamp and rocks
were hurting his feet.
