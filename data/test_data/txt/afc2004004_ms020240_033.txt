there an' eat an' enjoy, together.  Some of 'em; that's right.
All right, most of 'em got a habit this way: When they husbands
not home, see?  We all sit [to] at the table together.  See.  An' when
he comes, then they don't say anything about it, see?  But I say

But I treat 'em in that way, but some peoples I don't know an'
some with some folkses sometime, ya know, that I know, an'
I don't know them, they, they act sideways to ya, you know, when
they go in a sto'?  An' make ya sick.  They jus' act, ya know,--
