Dear Mr. Massicotte:
It was a great pleasure to meet you and to
lunch with you in French with cabbage soup.
I hope that if you ever come to the United
States you will allow me to do the honors
for you in Washington. In the meantime,
thank you for helping to make my visit in
Canada an extremely pleasant one.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge of the
Archive of American Folk Song
