Dearest Father and Deanie, 

I had a wonderful time taking care of the children while Shirley
was away, running the house, working on and with the new girl, who
seems to be doing fine, and coping with all kinds of emergencies including
a leaking toilet, a sandstorm and the incident of Susan's having
eaten several Virginia Creeper berries which are rumored to be poisonous.
No ill effects observed from my handling of anything, thank goodness.
Shirley left in such a rush-- ,she was going out under the underpass in 
forty-five minutes after Chris asked her to go that she hardly left any
instructions at all and I did it all by myself which was quite pleasing
to my egocentric soul.

Since she's come back life has toned down slightly. It's been
terribly hot, and we've mostly either gone to the movies or swum to combat
it. I hear from Shirley that it's nothing on central state weather.
I hope by now it's cooled off a little for you. Last Sunday we went out
to Buffalo again and xxxx took the children. Neitherof them are at all 
scared of the water-- Susan puts on her little blue lastex satin trunks 
and kicks and paddles with her hands much better than Patsy used even
when she washer age. And Patsy churzns the waves for fully five strokes
at a time with what she terms the side-stroke, and jumps up and down or
splashes the little boys the rest of the time. 

The latest development on our block is Bobby Scoggin's soda water
stand. He made a dollar off of it yesterday mostly from beleaguered
neighbors, and he and Patsy are planning to go into the business together. 
Patsy is going to make candy to sell, at least if she can get her mother
to furnish materials. I have my doubts personally.
