Dear Mr. Knapp: 
We in the Bureau of Intelligence of the Office of War Information are particularly interested in your letter of June 24, since it relates closely to one of our most important functions. We will greatly appreciate being supplied with all the information you can provide on opinion and morale in Massachusetts. 
Mr. Cornelius DuBois has asked me to suggest that all material be sent to the Special Services Division of the Bureau of Intelligence. We will see that it gets to the hands of those best able to make use of it. 
Sincerely yours, 
Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
Mr. Robert H. Knapp, Chairman 
Division of Propaganda Research
