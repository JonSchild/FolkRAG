Mr. Duncan Emrich
1615 Grant Street
Denver, Colorado

Dear Mr. Emrich:

If you can move fast, perhaps I can arrange a recording trip for this
summer. In this fashion, John A. Lomax can bring the recording machine to
Colorado, show you how to use it, and how to carry on field work. We can,
I believe, help you with some of the expenses. Perhaps you and father might
travel together for a time, depending on how the funds hold out. We can not
finance a trip from Colorado to Alaska, but I do want songs from that area.
If you could plan a furtile recording trip for the end of the summer or early
fall, which would include the recording of mining songs, good and especially
bad, I should like to take a recording machine to, and the types of material available
to be recorded from live folk informants.

Perhaps if nothing more comes of this, your working with father in Colorado,
for a week or two, that would be fine for this year. Then, in case the Guggen-
heim should come to you, you could do recording for the Library in this connec-
tion.

Please answer my letter at once, so that I can make arrangements for
father to bring the machine with him when he comes.

With kindest regards,

Alan Lomax
