Mr. Alan Lomax

Dear Mr. Lomax:  
   I have just been listening to your most
delightful program of folk songs and I think you may be
interested in seeing the use I have made of such songs
in the enclosed poem.  You will observe that I have
taken a few liberties with the words in some instances.
   I wrote this poem in an effort to make use of the ke-mo
ki-mo song which I have never heard of except through my
father who is now eightynine years old.  It may be familiar
to you however.
   Your programs are a valuable contribution to the education
of the nation and I hope I may continue to hear them for
a long time to come.

Sincerely yours,

Lexie Dean Robertson
