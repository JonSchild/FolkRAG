[*A*]

When we were in the war about four 
months, a neighbor told my friend that 
her son, who was in the army, was a prisoner 
of the Japs.  My friend asked her how she 
found out and was told that her son wrote 
her a letter, but only certain things weren't 
censored.  However, in the letter, she was told 
to save the stamp.  Mrs. (Blank) thought this 
odd because her son never showed any interest 
in stamps.  She steamed off the stamp and 
underneath it her son had written that his 
tongue had been removed.  My friend was shocked 
with this news and it took her some time to forget 
it.

It was while we were visiting my friend's 
aunt, that we again heard this story.  However
this time it was told by a different person, 
word for word.

It is serious to spread rumors.  However
to fight the enemy, we must know the
evil about them.
