I've never seen it so that they only had one.  And the style we
played during that time was little bit different - we didn't have large
bands.  Anybody that got the job, of course, he offered the job to
different people.
Q.  Somebody would tell you there was a parade and what would happen then.
M.  SOMEbody would say "Okay - they didn't call me Jelly Roll then, they
called me Winding Ball.  Say "W.B.", there's a parade coming up an such
and such a club and such and such a club have this date.  Now if you
want this, I can get it for you.  Well, of course it would mean
$5 for the leader and 2 1/2 or 3 dollars for the men. So by being a leader,
in that case anybody could be leader - all you had to do was to get
the job and then get the men.
Q.  How would you go about getting the men?
M.  We'd find em very easy.  We'd go right in the tenderloin district - 
right at 25's or round then - say "Boys, I got a job Sunday" You'd
always know in the last few minutes anyway.  You'd never know in
front, because it won't really an organized band - they wouldn't hire
those big organized bands.  "Boys I got a job.  You want it?" "What is it?"
"Parade" "When?" "Sunday." Everybody say. "count me in.  I'm in on it."
They wasn't in on it for the money so much but on account of the
drinks they could drink.  Every time the parade would walk four or five
blocks, why they'd have a keg of beer, sandwiches, whiskey and all kinda
drinks.  So that's what they really in on it so they could get drinks 
and have a good time.  Of course, they called it a ball.  And of course
we'd see plenty fights.

The boys would throw _______________ at one another but they
never try to hurt a musician.  It was fun for us to see a guy get beat
up sometimes.  So all we had in the band as a rule was a bass horn
one trombone, one trumpet, an alto and
maybe a baritone clarinet and
