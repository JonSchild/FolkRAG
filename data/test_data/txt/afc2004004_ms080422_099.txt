Tape: #897 cont. Nimrod Workman 9

You'll see yourself, she pu[t]s salt or. . .or anything, she
fills it up with water and I ask when she wants the beans, 
and I t[a]ke 'em out, throw 'em in and pack 'em.  I won't let
her. . . . .  anymore.  Had the high blood you know. . . . . . 
I like to do anyt[h]ing but sit down in one place and do
nothing.  I just can't do that.
AL:  You were telling me before that you had dreams and
believed in dreams.  Have you had a dream that came
back to you again and again in your life?
Nimrod:  Oh yeah.  I don't know why. . . . . .I dream a dream
maybe three times every year.  I dream of flying, and I 
get up there and my arms, just as easy as a bird.
Sometimes I light on top of a high rock,all the way up.
and look down and wonder how to get down.  And I wake up
in that dream.  But I've dreamed that dream 50 times, at
different times and areound 3 times maybe.  And I've
o[f]ten wondered about it.  Just get up there and I thought
people would get out there and watch me fl[y]ing, say, why
he can fly.  I don't know why people dream dreams like that.
But it's some kind of warning about it. . . . Bible speaks to
you in dreams. . . . . . . . .oh, I've dreamt different kinds of
dreams.  I dreamt a dream, before I ever got into singing,
and before the union come out, I dreamt a dream where I got
out of the mines, and I thought I'd got into something
where I could just make money and go ahead. . .(end of tape)
