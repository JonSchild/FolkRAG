Story 

I. One day a man went into a resturant about 12:00 
in the afternoon. He ordered a lunch and when he 
had finished eating it, he took out a small pill box 
from his pocket, emptied the pills onto a piece of paper 
and then started filling the small pill box with sugar.
 After he had done this he paid his bill and went out. 

II. On March 20, 1943 a man started a rumor that on 
that day, midnight soap & soap flakes  would be 
rationed. It didn't happen though.

III. A Sergeant was inspecting the barracks of some "Rookies"
which where in his charge. He walked up & down the
line of beds all nice & neat, under one bed a dirty
pair of shoes were looking out. The Sergeant said Whoever's
shoes these are, are going to peel potatoes the rest
of the day." Every "Rookie" went to his bed, and looked
at his shoes; The Sergeant also went to his bed to see
if they were his, not expecting the shock of finding
that they were his. Anyone who wanted the Sergeant
for the next new hours found him peeling potatoes.
