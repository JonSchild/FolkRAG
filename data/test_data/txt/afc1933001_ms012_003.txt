J. E. McCauley
On Thanksgiving Day 1924, J. E. McCauley wrote to me from Seymour, Texas: 
"After staying in Rochester, Minnesota (Mayo Clinic) a good many days--x-rayed four 
times, five blood tests and three electric baths, a good many examinations and probings, 
they told me they could do nothing for me, told me if I had any unsettled
business had better see to it and wind up my affairs as my time was drawing to an 
end. I laughed at them, told them was good for twenty years yet but they didn't
think so.  Somehow I just can't believe my time is as near up as they think.  While
they say no medicine will do me any good, but to drink four gallon of water per
day.  I told them I was raised in Arizona and it was a shame to waste water by 
drinking so much, but try ever so hard I just caint go but two or a little better
--------------.  We bought a turkey and all the fixtures and have had a real
feast today-------.  I didn't know but this might be my last Thanksgiving so we
celebrated.  Mother asked me what was most thankful for.  I told her sure was 
thankful the night was not any longer than it was. ------- Well I lost my vote on the
Governor of Texas but saved her on Silent Calvin Coolidge.  I feel we will have
fairly good times for the next four years, am hoping so any way.
Your friend,
J. E. McCauley
