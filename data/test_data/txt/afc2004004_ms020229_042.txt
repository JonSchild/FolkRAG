So, I said, "I hope he don't come across [them] there when I'm out
there.
An' so.  He said, "Well, I sho' seen him out there lookin'."
All right.  One or two days later, I seed 'im.  Rosie had gone
for some water.  Me an' her was hoin' together.  An' I was hoin'.
An' 's was hot.  It was A-1 hot.  An' they gi' ya an acre an' a
half or an acre, ya know.  They ain' gonna gi' ya no acre.  Hit
was at least an acre an' a half.
AL:  Jesus!
BJ:  Oh, yeah!  An' so...
AL:  Can't you check on 'em that way?
BJ:  Oh, yeah, you can check on 'em, but what need of it?  They said, they say it's a
acre.  That's all a that.
AL:  You can't argue with 'em?
BJ:  Aw, you know...They ain' no use to argue with 'em 'cause if you do
you just, just leave there an' go somewhere else, but they doin'
the same thing.  What diffrunt in it?  But they used to like it (?)
'cause [he] ya git over it, [he] ya git over it so fast an' so quick, ya
know, an' so good, if ya know how.  An' so, he come across that
day.  It was sinful.  An' I wan', wan', I wa'n' no Christian no-
how, an' so...I seed 'im comin'.  The sun was hot an' everything
got hot when the, when the, the closer he git to me.  Hotter everything got.  So I
stopped wit' the hoe an' waited for him.  [Jus'] Stood up [wit'] on' lean on
[the end of] the hoe.  He come out there.  An' I jus' [stood] stan' up an'
lean on the hoe like that, lookin' at him come, on out there.
He says, um, "Hit sure is hot out here, ain't it?"
I says, "It sure is."  I says, "It's hot as hell out here
an' this damn hoe, you can't hoe with it; it's dull as my ass.
I cain't do nothin' with it.  I'm gonna sit down on it."
