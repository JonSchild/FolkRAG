Miss Lexie Dean Robertson
Rising Star, Texas

Dear Miss Robertson

Thank you for your charming letter and for
the enclosure " Beggars Minstrel" which I enjoyed
very much. I regret to say that I did not know before
who was the Poet Laureate of Texas. My most cordial
greetings to you.

Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
