[*217 cont.*]

AL:   What was she before she was a Denson?

Uncle Bob:   She was Berdette.  My brother got a song
on 422, called Burdette, named after my mother. That is
Whit Denson--Sydney Whit Denson.

AL:   And one of your kinfold is one of the big teachers
of Sacred Harp.

Uncle Bob:   Well, my daddy taught over 200. .

AL:   What was his name?

Uncle Bob:   Seburn, he revised the book back in 1911. He
put altos to all the songs -- you can see it in the book--
alto by S. M. Denson.

AL:   Did he ever explain to you when you were young why the
Sacred Harp book was so important and why he believed in it
so much?

Uncle Bob:   Well, I don't know. . .  I grew up in it.  My
daddy's music school. . I knew him in teaching, it was in the
7 shades, a modern book called "Star of Bethlehem" and he'd
been off teaching then.   I was 4 years old at that time and
when he came home, he had his money tied up in a handkerchief,
didn't have any green paper money in those days. That was
85 years ago- I was four years old.  That's 85 years- they
didn't have no paper money.

AL:   I suppose he got about a quarter a lesson, something
like that? Quarter a person?
