Reverend Roe.  Reel 13.  P. 5
so any man can be saved under any condition, and that condition is
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
A:  Reverend, what do you hope to see when you pass on out of this
world?
R:  I hope to go to a better world.  I have that confidence in God's
word[, and] that there is a land, there is a place prepared for the faithful.
I believe that.
A:  What do you think it will be like there?
[*What heaven will be like--the just will judge the unjust.*]
R:  Well, I tell you, my honestly belief is it'll be this world, at least
a great part of my life after death will be right here.  And the Bible
teaches that that [you] we'll reign with Christ here a thousand years, and
it said the saints shall judgethe nations.  They'll set on thrones with
Christ in Jerusalem.  That's the Bible.  Well, that's gonna happen;
it's coming to pass.  I believe that because the Bible teaches it as
God's word, and I believe that the righteous will sit on thrones and
they'll judge the world.  And I believe that if you're saved, if you've
been a man that thought you was better than I and have mistreated me
because of that i-dea, I believe you'll be just as far below me in that
day as I am you now.  If you liked it and wanted it to be carried on
and use your influence in that way, I believe you'll reap what you
sow.  --[Yeah] Hunh!-- I don't wish it so.  But if it's so, it's just true.
I wish no man harm--No--I'm very well satisfied at the humble place
that I occupy in the world.
[*Rev. Roe is above the predjudice*]
I've adjusted myself to conditions because
I know one thing--no man can live happy and peaceable until he can
adjust himself to the conditions around him.  I don't see myself as
part of it.  I see myself as one trying to make it better.  I'm [leading] ??ing
out of that atmosphere.  It doesn't touch me.  The prejudice and all a
that is something aside from me.  I'm satisfied with God.
I could go off [here on that] yonder and get in[to] a cave on the hillside and have
my food and my clothes [and stay out there] & be happy.  That's just the way I feel.
I'd like to meet you, and I'd like to talk with you and I'd like to
