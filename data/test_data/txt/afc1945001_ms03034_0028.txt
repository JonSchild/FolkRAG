Dear General Hershey:

I enclose a memorandum which we have received from
Mr. Robert H. Knapp, Chairman of the Division of Propaganda
Research of the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety.
Mr. Knapp reports widespread rumors in Massachusetts concerning
draft dodging on the part of Jewish men. He feels that these
rumors are extremely dangerous and that some effort should be
made to counteract them. He has asked us for information to
use in such refutation which we are unable to supply.

I am informing him that we are bringing this matter
to your attention.

Sincerely yours,

R. Keith Kane
Assistant Director
In Charge, Bureau of
Intelligence
Office of Facts and Figures
Office of War Information

General Lewis B. Hershey
Selective Service System
Washington, D.C.

Enclosure
