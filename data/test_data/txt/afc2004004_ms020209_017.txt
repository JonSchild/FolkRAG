Broadside Magazine, in its May 1966 issue, reviews the Southern Festival of
Song (sponsored by SNICK) and Mabel Hillary:
"Mabel Hillary, from the Georgia Sea Islands, has a gorgeous voice . . .
 When she sang the whole place lit up.  She's so free and easy and so 
damn musica.  She did a "Hard Hearted Hannah" with Len backing her up
that made you want to stand up and yell . . . . "

Hoot Folk Music Magazine, reviewing a CBC taping, reports: 
"Brownie McGhee introduced us to Mabel Hillary, who comes from the 
Georgia Sea Islands, and was heard by Brownie first at a folk festival
in Carolina. Her Blues Ain't Nothing But A Good Women Gone Bad and How 
Long Blues were excellent, deeply felt blues pieces . . . ."
