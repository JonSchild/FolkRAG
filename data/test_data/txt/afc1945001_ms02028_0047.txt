Conduct of War, Continued.
Employment official, 8-15-42: "I have heard several comments on the amount of 
publicity about the English ruling family. There has been quite a lot of it in
our papers locally, and the comment is that 'They're spreading it on a little 
too thick.'"
Employment official, 8-15-42: "In our contacts with employers it is not at all unusual to have to sit and listen to the employer express his opinion that this administration is coddling the unions to the point that the war effort is adversely affected."
Banker, 8-14-42: "Politics are holding up the legislation that is most important and the people are becoming impatient with it."
Housewives with men in service, 8-14-42: "We are giving too much attention to the election and politics, when we have more important issues at stake."
Banker, 8-14-42: "There is a lot of criticism of the high wages and profits in war production."
Banker, 8-14-42: "There is a lot of criticism of the high wages and profits in war production."
Banker, 8-14-42: There is too much red tape and too little coordination in the defense program."
VFW official, 8-14-42: "People are a lot more aware of the dangers of the situation than they were, but they need a few more shots in the arm like we have had the last week or so."
Employee of Veterans' organization, 8-14-42: We will never get any place until we have universal service. There is no excuse for letting capital and labor and the farmer make exorbitant profits. They did it in the last war and they are doing it all over again. All these cost plus contracts ought to be done away with. Contractors are minting money."
