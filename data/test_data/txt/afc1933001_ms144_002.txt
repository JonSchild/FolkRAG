Mr. John Umble
Goshen College
Goshen, Indiana

Dear Mr. Umble:

Mr. Lomax has referred to me your letter
of March 21 in which you ask for the loan of
a recording machine during the first week of
April. I regret that the only machine available
in the Library at the present moment is
in need of repairs and replacements. These
repairs, however, will take some time and
will be impossible to send you the machine 
at the time you mention. If you can rearrange
your schedule so that the recording
will take place in a month or two, please
let me know and I shall be very glad to go
into the matter further.

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
