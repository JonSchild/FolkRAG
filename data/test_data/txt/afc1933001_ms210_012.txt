[I as]
that at any time I have spoken
or written, I ask your pardon.
As my child it was
fitting and right that I should
feel concern for you, attempt
to guide you, but it was not
fair to you that I should
make you the special
object of my regard.

And I'll wonder if you can
understand clearly what
is written between the lines
of these clumsy sentences.
You will never know, unless,
indeed, you one day have a
barefooted, adoring son of your
own, just how my heart
throbs in all tenderness for
you. 
Father
