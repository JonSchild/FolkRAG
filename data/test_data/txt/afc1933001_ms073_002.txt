Dear Mr. Lomax:

On behalf of the Governing Board, I have the
pleasure of notifying you of your unanimous reelection
at the Annual Meeting of the Board on July 25, 1940, as
an Expert Consultant of the National Committee on Folk
Arts.

In accordance with our constitution, members of
the Committee and Consultants are elected every other
year for a term of two years. THe present election
covers the years 1940 and 1941.

As you see by the enclosed announcement, our loan
exhibition, Masterpieces of American Folk Art, has been
extended to continue during the period of the New York
World's Fair. We hope very much that you may be in
New York before the end of October so that you may be
able to visit the exhibition, which contains some notable
examples of early American folk art and is considered
the most significant one yet held. It would be a
pleasure to welcome you here and to have an opportunity
to discuss the whole work with you.

Believe me, for the Governing Board,

Sincerely yours,

Ruth Burchenal
Secretary
