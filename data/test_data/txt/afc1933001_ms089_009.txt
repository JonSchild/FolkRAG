Dear John:

The book arrived and I am delighted. Thank you for what
to me will be one of my best Christmas presents, because
the ones you cherish are the ones you like the most.

Not living as we have among the isolationists you can
hardly grasp the sense of spiritual uplift I have felt
since Sunday. There is no divergence of opinion now
as to what this country has to do no matter how long
it takes. Feeling was beginning to run pretty high here,
even endangering long term friendships, so it is nice to
have it gone even if it did take a tragedy to bring it
about.

    Yours sincerely,
    Barrett Wendell
