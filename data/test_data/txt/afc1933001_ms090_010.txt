Mr. John Lomax,
7456 San Benito Way,
Dallas, Texas.

Dear Mr. Lomax:-

    I have finally succeeded in locating a first
edition of COWBOY SONGS to replace an early edition (not
first) that someone borrowed from my home library. I am
sending this book to you under separate cover and would very
much appreciate it if you would autograph it and return to
me as I would like to have your signature.

    Please don't date this and remember that my
first name is spelled with two "ll"s and two "tt"s.

    Incidentally I wrote your son, Alan, to ascer-
tain if you were in Washington or Texas and I got quite a
kick out of his answer, as he asked me where I found this
first edition as he had never even seen one. May try to scout
up a copy for him with my compliments, if I am lucky enough
to find it.
 
    All the best wishes for the New Year. Postage is
enclosed for return.

    Very truly yours,
    Elliott Shapiro
