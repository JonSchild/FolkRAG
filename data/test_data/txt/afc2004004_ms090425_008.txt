Fisk, 20. 6.
Two angels came from Heaven,
And [rode that song away] rolled that stone away;
Tow angels came from Heaven,
And [rode that song away] rolled that stone away;
Two angels came from Heaven,
And [rode that song away] rolled that stone away;
And the Lord will [carry] bear
My spirit home.
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose up from the dead.
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose up from the dead.
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose,
He rose up from the dead.
And the Lord will [carry] bear
My spirit home.
A long time ago.
