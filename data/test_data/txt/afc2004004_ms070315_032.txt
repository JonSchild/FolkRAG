When they first cleaned up this country, they
cleaned up the land in high spots - as near
the river as possible, because that's the 
way they got supplies -
The levee system began in New Orleans
about 1767. The levees here grew up like Topsy.
This levee dist. org until 1884
runs from Memphis & Vicksburg, Miss.
In the old days [the] a levee of 2 or 3 
feet could protect a piece of land
because the river formerly spread over
the whole basin. The levee is still 
being built higher & higher all the time.
In 1897 the levee broke at 32 ft.
We held the water in '37 at 50.
