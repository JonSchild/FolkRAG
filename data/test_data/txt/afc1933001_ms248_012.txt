complete waste of effort and
good black ink.

The bacon I had sent
to you the other day, as an
added birthday present, I
think is of excellent quality;
the sausage only so-so. Regular
meals, regular sleep, frequent
hours of quiet meditation on
your own hearth alone will
quiet your jangled nerves
- more than all else [in] under the
"wide and strong sky."

Patsy & Susan are here - Shirley
with Chris in Mobile - headed
to almost certain disaster as the
New Deal dominated by the 40 hour week
and John L. Lewis are decreeing, and
also Mr. Harry Hopkins.
