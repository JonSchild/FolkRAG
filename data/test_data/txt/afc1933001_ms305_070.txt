U.S. PROGRAM
OFFERS FOLK,
SWING TUNES

Library of Congress Radio
Recital to Include Relics
Of America's Musical Past

By GLENN DILLARD GUNN

How does it happen that the LIbrary
of Congress, which has been
defined by its new Librarian, Archibald
MacLeish, as "the nation's 
most" important repository of culture,
is about to introduce to the
school children of America a program
which will feature, in part 
the entirely plebian and conspicuously
uncultural development of
music known as "swing"?

This seems a contradiction perse,
a kind of reductio ad absurdum,
which only the avid and
self-centered "world of the air"
could accomplish. Why does Columbia's
American School of the
Air bracket swing and folk song
on the Tuesday morning broadcast
which is addressed to the
school children of the country.

Relics of Musical Past

Why does the Library's brilliant
folk song investigator, Alan Lomax,
consent to divide his program
of pioneer music with Lyn
Murray, Columbia's arranger and
director of popular music?

Lomax is a scholar who discovers
musical relics of our exciting
past and from them recreates the
spiritual lives of our ancestors as
they carved a nation from the wilderness.
There was, for example,
Davy Crockett, famed for the
prowess of his rifle, a great Indian
fighter, a hero of Andy Jackson's
campaigns, and, in odd moments,
one of Tennessee's sweet singers.
Lomax will tell the story of how 
Davy's vocal echo of the fiddle's
voice, "high, shrill and far away,"
became a famous mountain folksong.

Folk Tunes Scheduled

Many of our vanished frontiers
will be visited by Lomax next
Tuesday, when he will bring his
guitar to Station WABC, in New
York, at 9:15 a.m. (E.S.T.) to chant
the cowboy's "Whoopie-Ti-Yi-Yo,"
a whaler's chanty, a railroad

workers song, some Negro spirituals,
a Georgia "holler," and other
better known folksongs of the
Southern mountains. If Loman
were to be alone on this program,
not an eyebrow could be raised.
But now will come Lyn Murray to
swing "Hop Up, My Ladies," one
of ancient square dances Lomax
has discovered.

Just what service to culture this
will perform is a matter for conjecture.
Of this much one may be
certain. Murray will be as proud
of his swing version of an ancient
American folk tune as his colleagues
are of their borrowings
from Ravel, Debussy and Tschaikowsky.
