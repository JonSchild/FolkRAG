Mr. John A. Lomax
Huntsville, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

We have ordered the records for you and
they should reach you soon.

I appreciate Miss Terrill's co-operation
in this venture and I know that her work will
prove very useful to all of us.

I have ask Mr. Henderson to make the
lists you requested and shall send them
to you as soon as they are ready.

I am surprised to hear that you are still
in doubt about the Gamut matter because I
settled that with the Librarian immediately
and thought that I had notified you of this.
I did write to Mr. Wolfert and Alan about it,
and I am sure that everything has been arranged.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
