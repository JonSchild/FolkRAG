MRS. DAVIS:
When it went on bad basis, couldn't get along, if he goes one place let her go the other and when he comes back it'll be all right. Thats a good idea.
LARRY:
Just like the other night, I went to see my wife and she had to remind me that we been separated for a year. She told me she says All you do is want to be around your friends, I say why don't you try to be a friend of mine then.
MRS. DAVIS:
What did she say.
LARRY:
She didn't have nothing to say and then she say, you know we been separated for a year. Sure enough, With two of them I done all right, it took me a year to get over them fighting I did with you. But these last two I been to England, I put out two albums and about two or three different films and I say I really hadn't thought about me and you being apart these years.
MRS. DAVIS:
Didn't have that kind of time you so busy.
LARRY:
No cause I had to occupy myself from going crazy and I did. I tried, I studied music very hard and I tried to get my hands on everything.
