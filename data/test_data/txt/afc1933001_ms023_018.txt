Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter relative to songs "made-up" and sung among our girls has been received. As far as we have been able to ascertain such songs are not current among our girls. We make a great deal of music in our school of letters ad in our cottages, but have not heard of this form of activity.

Very truly yours,

Kenosha Sessions
