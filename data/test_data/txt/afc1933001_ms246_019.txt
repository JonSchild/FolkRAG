Dear Alan:  You can't get
"colorful" records on such
short notice. In two days
travel outside of Dallas I
could have got some that would
have curled Mr. MacLeish's whiskers.
I'm not well, but I'll
get all the records possible for
you, following your most helpful
and thoughtful suggestions.
No more records from Jerry as 
yet.  I thank you especially
and emphatically for your last
several letters, in particular for
your patience and forbearance
with me.
Lovingly
Father
