Dear Mr. Lomax,

EDINBURGH LABOUR FESTIVAL COMMITTEE.

I wish on behalf of the above Committee to express our 
apologies for the unfortunate difference of opinion which occurred 
at our 'Ceilidh'.

You will, I am sure, view the matter with an understanding 
mind when I explain that we were all very tired and strained 
by a hectic week as you yourself must have also been.  We wish 
to assure you that the Committee was in no way distrustful of your 
motives and was in fact pleased that you favoured us with your 
attention.  I hope that we can now consider this matter as 
merely an unfortunately incident which is best forgotten.

With sincerest apologies and best wishes for the future.

Yours Sincerely,
R. Donaldson
R. Donaldson, Secretary
