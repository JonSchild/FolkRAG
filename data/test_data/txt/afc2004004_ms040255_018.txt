interest to the student of old 
customs.
I have a son living 
in London. & if you think 
there might be anything to 
interest you, perhaps you would 
like to contact him. -- He is 
very interested in such things.  
his address is. 88. St. George's 
Drive. S.W.1. Tel: Victoria 0193. 
but it's difficult to catch him.
8.30 am is the best time.
Yours truly.
