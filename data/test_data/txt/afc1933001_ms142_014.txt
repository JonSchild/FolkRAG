Mr. Alan Lomax

All these men are anxious to know more about our recording activities
here and I suggest that you play them the exhibit set of duplicates
which is now in your possession.

I trust that your wife is fully recovered from her illness and
that you are enjoying your stay in New York.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,


Harold Spivacke
