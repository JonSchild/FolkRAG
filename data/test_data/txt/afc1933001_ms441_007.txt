Sometimes I think, Lawd, she's too good to die, good to die;
Sometimes I think my baby too good to die,
O, Lawdy, (times) I think my baby too good to die,
An' sometimes I think she oughta be buried alive.

Blues I got make a new-born baby cry, baby cry;
Blues I got make a new born baby cry;
O, Lawdy, blues I got make a new-born baby cry;
I pray to de Lawd that you were born to die.

I'm gwine tell my baby 'bout hotichoke, hotichoke*,
Gwine tell my baby 'bout hotichoke, 
O Lawdy, 'n-a** tell my baby 'bout hotichoke,
Gwine tell my baby it's a Hell of a note.

I'm down in mind, worried mighty bad, mighty bad,
Down in mind, worried mighy bad,
I done told you, down in mind, worried mighty bad,
I done los' every woman I had.

[Somebody's in town, Lawd, playing' de loopty-loop,
Somebody's in town playing' de loopyy-loop,
body's in town playing' de loopty-loop,
How come you do me like you do, do, do.]

Aw, Lawdy!

Got a range in my kitchen ain' doin' me no good, me no good, 
Range in my kitchen ain' doin' me no good,
O Lawdy, range in my kitchen an' it ain' doin' me no good,
Got to fin' somebody to burn my coal an' wood.

Let me be your biscuit, 'till your biscuit roller come, roller come,
Let me be your biscuit 'till your biscuit roller come,
I done tole you, be your biscuit 'till your biscuit roller come,
 I can roll more biscuits than your biscuit-roller ever done.

Lemme be yo' side-track 'till yo' main-line come, main-line come,
Be yo' side-track 'till yo' main-line come,
O Lawdy, --------(play guitar) -------
I can do more switchin' than your main-line ever done.

"I'm gwine to town what you want me to bring you back, bring you back?
Gwine to town, what you want me to bring you back?"
O Lawd -------(plays guitar)-------
"Just anything you think yo' baby like."

Lemme be yo' hammer 'till yo' hammer come, hammer come,
Be yo' hammer 'til yo' hammer come,
O Lawdy, be yo' hammer 'till yo' hammer come,
I can nail mo' nails than yo' hammer ever done.

*"Hotichoke", artichoke, L.B., with a good deal of prompting, said that this Blues was made when artichokes became common; but the truth is that he has no more idea then we do what this slang means.
