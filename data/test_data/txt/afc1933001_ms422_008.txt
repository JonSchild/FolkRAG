FARMERS UNION BOOSTER SONG
To the Tune "Marching Through Georgia"
Gather in a circle all and sing a Union song,
Sing it as they used to sing with voices loud and strong,
Make the old room echo as the music rolls along,
Hip! Hip! Harrah for the Farmers' Union!

Chorus:
Hurrah! Hurrah! Our Union leads the way,
Hurrah! Hurrah! Our Union's sure to pay,
So let us all take courage, and shout aloud
Hip! Hip! Hurrah for the Farmers Union!

Here we learn of many joys and also many mistakes,
Some will stick successfully and some will fail perhaps,
But we're always ready to shout aloud and say,
Hip! Hip! Hurrah for the Farmers Union!

What we do in the Union will be heard of all our lives,
Some come out by themselves and some will bring their wives,
But we're always ready to fling our hats and shout,
Hip! Hip! Hurrah for the Farmer's Union!

Wisconsin's turn has come at last, it's going over big,
We'll leave the slackers all behind and let them growl and dig.
So let us all remember to boost the Union strong,
Hip! Hip! Hurrah for the Farmers Union!

NO WOODEN SHOES FOR ME!
Tune: It Ain't Goin' to Rain No More.

Oh—we're living in the U. S. A.
We'll fight to win the day,
Production cost we'll make them pay
Or we'll feed them straw and hay.
For the East wants all our food too cheap,
For the West don't care a heap,
Our taxes keep on getting steep,
But the farmer dasn't peep.

Chorus:
Oh, they're carving a pair of wooden shoes,
A pair for you and me.
They might shove them on in Italy,
But they can't slip the slipper on me.

The grain gamblers have got a hunch,
They've felt the farmers' punch.
We'll give them crackers for their lunch,
Until they join our bunch.
We'll make the packers like our game,
They think we're kinda tame.
We'll shake those birds up just the same,
We'll win or bust a hame.

The Union's made a mighty fight,
To win the farmer's right,
The enemy is sitting tight,
She's left them with her might.
For the farmer's waking up at last,
They'll go off like a blast;
Wall street will think she has been gassed
Our slavery will be passed.

Old Washington is stirred up now,
The rubes have started a row;
They'll give us what we ask for now,
Or we don't push the plow,
For they are carving a pair of wooden shoes,
A pair for you and me.
They might shove them on it Italy,
But they can't slip the slipper on me.

BRING BACK THE SMILE TO THE
FARMER'S FACE
Tune: Bring Back My Bonnie to Me.

A shark worth a whole lot of money,
Met a farmer a struggling to win,
He loaned him his coin, ain't it funny?
A sad story now to begin.

Chorus:
Bring back, bring back, bring back the smile
to the Farmer's face.
Bring back, bring back our farming to its
rightful place.
The man had a good grade of cattle,
They made him some good money, too,
He bought registered stuff for the battle,
More money he borrowed——did you?

This farmer, he always expected,
A good crop would sure come this fall,
He'd keep his good credit respected,
The thing didn't happen at all.

His neighbors of course drove a good car,
And why should he drive the old Ford?
He'd fixed the old top up with coal tar,
He felt it had paid for its board.

Soon music you'd hear from the twilight,
The radio never was still,
The furnace kept going 'til midnight,
Expense kept climbing at will.

And now he can't pay off the mortgage,
His taxes and interest past due,
He's going to lose all from shortage,
And who do you blame, tell me, who?

AN INVITATION SONG
By O. M. Stucker, Ellendale, North Dakota
(Tune: Casey Jones)

I.

Come, all you farmers that would like to see
This starvation system in Eternity,
Come, bolster up your spirit and do the thing that's right,
And help us to eliminate the parasite.
Come, join the mighty army that is passing down the road
To relieve the poor old farmer of a heavy load,
Of a debt that's heaped upon him that he never can pay
From the dawn of all creation till the judgement day.

Chorus:
The farmers Union is a mighty army,
The Farmers Union is a mighty throng,
The Farmers Union is a might army,
And it's marching on to victory a million strong.

II.

Oh, the Farmers Union, it has come to stay,
It is growing stronger and stronger each day.
It has got the big business worried and it's got them on the
jump,
And we hear them crying mercy, what an awful bump.
We have fed the mighty railroads and we've seen the mighty
trust
Scale the heights of fame and fortune till we're about to 
bust.
But we call them on the carpet just the day before we're lost,
And we tell those mighty monarchs to produce, we must have
cost.
Chorus:
