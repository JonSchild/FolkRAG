1940                   DR. WILL AND DR. CHARLIE                       45
to launch their careers at a time
when surgery, armed with anesthetics
and antiseptics, was entering new
fields. Dr. Charlie has given a modest
account of how he was "projected"
into operations on the thyroid gland.
A big Norwegian came in with a
goiter so large it forced his head 
back. Dr. Charlie had to improvise
a technique. It was highly successful;
he perfected it and by 1935
more than 27,000 goiter patients 
had passed through the Mayo Clinic.
   Other surgeons began to learn of 
the amazing work being done at
Rochester. Dr. Will, when barely
40, wrote a report of 200 gall-bladder
operations which so astounded the
editor of the Annals of Surgery that
he journeyed west to find out whether 
the author was a liar or a genius. 
He found the two modest brothers
operating in a way which met or
surpassed the standards of the finest 
Eastern hospitals. A dozen gallbladder
operations were performed
during his visit. Two years later Dr.
Will reported on his first 1000 gallbladder
cases. Thereafter squadrons
of medical men came west to watch
the Mayos work. Physicians sent 
their most difficult cases. They came 
themselves when in need of major
surgery; and, as one of them put 
it, "We always bought round-trip
tickets."
   To meet the needs of their growing 
practice, the Mayos surrounded
themselves with the most competent
associates they could find. It was 
said they "induced 500 members of

the world's most highly individualistic
profession to live and work
together in a small town on the 
edge of nowhere - and like it."
Faced with the problem of treating 
patients as an organic whole, and at 
the same time giving them a specialist's 
care, they assembled under one 
roof experts in almost everything,
combining the work of many on a 
single case.
   Mayo fellows come from every
state in the Union, from Heidelberg
and Cape Town, Uruguay and Iceland.
Some 1500 of them have spent
three years or more in Rochester,
then carried the Mayo tradition 
not only all over the United States
but also to the remotest medical 
outposts. One became chief surgeon
to the King of Siam. Another serves
the Maharajah of Mysore. Others
operate in Antwerp, Shansi, Oslo, 
and Jerusalem.
   Although the Mayo walls were
covered with awards, citations, and
honorary degrees the brothers blushed
to hear themselves described as
"modern miracle workers" and their
Clinic called "the eighth wonder of
the world." When speakers referred
to some new procedure as "the
Mayo operation," Dr. Charlie would
call it "the Hippocrates-Mayo operation," 
to indicate their debt to 
predecessors.
    The Mayos made the clinic a 
democracy, giving one vote to each
staff member of five years' standing.
The placed themselves and 
all their associates on regular salary,
