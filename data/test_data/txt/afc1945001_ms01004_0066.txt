Dear Mr. Irving:

We shall look forward to seeing you on
August 2 at 10:00 o'clock in the morning.

Although this office is still located at
515 22nd Street, N.W., Room 701, we will probably 
be moved to the Social Security Building, [Room] Third Floor
by the time you arrive.  Possibly you should telephone
the morning you arrive to be sure where we are.

Mr. Katz, who is in charge of our Special
Services Division, and Dr. Likert, who is in charge 
of our Intensive Surveys Division have also heard
from you.  I have asked them to be here at my office
at 10:00 o'clock August 3 to meet you.

Sincerely yours,

R. Keith Kane
Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
Office of War Information

Mr. J. A. Irving
Research Secretary,
Committee on Morale,
Office of Director of
Public Information,
Ottawa, Canada
