Birmingham, Alabama,
February 9, 1940

Mr. Allen Lomax,
American School of the Air,
Columbia Broadcasting System,
New York City.

My dear Mr. Lomax:

I have often heard your most
interesting program of the School of the Air,
depicting American folk and songs and lore, and
feel sure that you will be interested in hearing
of an artist who would be a valuable addition
to your staff.

The enclosed folder will give
you information about Mary Gillen, who has often
been called "The Human Story Book".  Her negro
dialect is perfect, and in this day of imitation
which does not ring true to the ear of those
accustomed to real impersonation, you will find
Mary Gillen a "natural".  To quote one of the 
negro race who said, "Miss Ma'y sho do know the
cut and grade of a nigger", no word of praise
could say more.  One of her original tales called
"The Hanging" is a true masterpiece, and should
be recorded for posterity.

If you would like to contact
this gifted woman, you will find her at this
address:  Mrs. Mary Gillen Tucker, 226 Liberty
Street, Jacksonville, Florida.

Hoping that you will follow
up this suggestions, and with best wishes, I am,

Sincerely yours,
Katherine C. Kilgore
Mrs. Katherine C. Kilgore,
1114 South 16th St., Birmingham, Ala.
