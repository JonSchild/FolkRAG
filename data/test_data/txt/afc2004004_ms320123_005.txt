Can:  $10/month.  They said "you mean $10/week?"  I said
     "Oh no!"  I was getting $10/ month when my daddy died, my
     mama  died the year after, and they didn't have no jobs,
     so one guy knew that I was pretty good in the field, and
     he hired me.  It's not far from (unint).  xxxx I stayed   
     there a long time.  I worked for him $10/month, and he would
     give me the whole Saturday off, and they would feed me of
     course.  Then from then on they started cutting wood.  I left
     from there, they started cutting (unint) wood.  I worked awhile
     then I joined the CC(??) i went down for six months.

       about the Fontenots, how I could learn everything about the
       Fontenots, but I never wrote for the book or nothing.

AL:  You have kinfolks arun Basile and Mamou, and (unint)

    auntie living in Basile, then I got some cousins.

AL:  And then you're a kin to Amadie Ardoin.

Can: No I'm not.
