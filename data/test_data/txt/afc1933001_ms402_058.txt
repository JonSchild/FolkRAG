          No mo' he'll wanner 'way fum honce
          Fur now he's soaked in penitence
          An' weepin'-eyed he strows back home
          No mo' to stray, no mo' to room
                                                                         (Chorus)

     I have seen many Negro naptizings. My friend, John B. Jones,
sent me from Houston, Texas, this account of one:
     The scene was set in a rocky gorge, the banks of which were
festooned with overhanging cedars, the sparkling pool of clear water 
being so surrounded that the place formed a natural amphitheatre. In
this spot were grouped a large crowd of negroes, the women and children
dressed in bright colors. The gorge rang with their merry laughter
and light-hearted chatter until the minister, a solemn-faced, deep-voiced, 
white-haired old man, lifted his hand for silence. Then the
crowd sand as only Negroes can sing, a spiritual where the terrors of
death and hell are described in a way to startle the imagination and
almost to chill the blood. Next, a visiting preacher prayed, with the 
audience joining in with vocal approval, from time to time repeating the
words that happened to impress them most. As the candidate for baptism, 
ten or twelve in number, approached the water-side where they were led
out, one by one, by a deacon to the preacher standing in the middle of 
the pool. The crowd sang:
          Let's go down to Jordan, let's go down to Jordan,
          De clear ribber Jordan is mighty deep;
          Let's go down to Jordan,
          De old ribber Jordan is mighty deep; 
          But 'ligion is so sweet.
