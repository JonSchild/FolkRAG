Rumors and Rumor Campaign

In two long sessions, yesterday and today, we undertook
to give Rostan the background material on rumors with which to
formulate an OWI rumor policy and an OWI rumor campaign.

As it looks now, Rosten will probably suggest following:-

(1) Cool encouragement to voluntary rumor clinics, based on
instructions being compiled by the Bureau of Intelligence.
These instructions will inform local rumor clinics how to
gather rumors, arrange them and pipe-line them to Washington
for further analysis, also how to stimulate adult
discussion and information campaigns locally about rumor
(probably something the Bureau of Special Operations
will get behind).

(2) A series of suggestions to various types of magazines for
articles on rumor and rumorists, ranging from the Readers'
Digest level to the pulp magazine level.  Rosten is very
fertile in ideas for the magazine trade and has already
formulated a baker's dozen which seem to me, at least,
to be very saleable.

(3) An OWI issued exposition of rumors [and] hows and whys, based
on Special Services rewrite of the "Rumor in Wartime" report.
Rosten is working on our manuscript now and agrees
with our recommendation that the rumors about rumors are
[about], perhaps, the most dangerous aspect of the rumor
problem, that almost every government official, even at
the local level, should have a better understanding about
rumors, should know that Washington is doing something
about them, should not run a temperature each time a new
rumor is encountered.

(4) Rosten will talk to Ken Dyke in order to put the rumor campaign
(if it is to be thought of in those proportions) in
the right relationship with the security of information
campaign.  The groundwork for this has already been laid
in many conversations with Betty Carter, Campaign Division
assistant assigned to this subject.
