I think that the story
is a little fantastic because if 
Hitler was dead more people would
know it and if they were planning
a raid less people would know
about it
  Another rumor that is running
around town at high speed is the 
one about the food being wasted
in Army camps while "some poor
family is starving" Women said
that they are going to join the WACC's
so that they can have meat , more than
three pairs of shoes a year and silk stockings
