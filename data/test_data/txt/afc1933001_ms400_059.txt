Chain Gang Negroes - Page Seven

result of plots. Negroes do not trust each other. In speaking
of the two races, one warden claimed that a dozen Negroes were
easier to manage than one white convict. Perhaps the reason for 
this characteristic is found in this bit of Negro philosophy:
"Listen, honey, I got six months outa de year to tends to my
business an' de other six months to keep outa yours."

For punishment usually the solitary cell or the lash that
the Negros call the black heifer or Black Betty. They sing an
axe cutting song personifying Black Betty, making her a woman:

"Oh, Black Betty,
Bam - ba - lam.
Oh, Black Betty,
Bam - ba - lam.
Black Betty where'd you come from?
Bam - ba - lam.
I came from Corsicana
Bam - ba - lam."

And so, on and on, keeping quick time with their swinging axes.
I have scene Black Betties hanging by the door of the men's
dormitory, a grim threat for broken prison rules. The lash is
commonly about four inches broad, so as to burn rather than cut
the flesh, and four or five feet long. I saw no one whipped.
I found no one in hospitals as a result of inhuman punishment.
In Mississippi and in Arkansas, I heard of frequent whippings.
A farm-superintendent in Arkansas complained of a sore right
shoulder because that day he and a helper had whipped eighty
cotton pickers for grabbing off so much trash with the cotton
as to injure its market price. Some wardens claim that whipping
for misconduct is more humane than solitary confinement on bread
