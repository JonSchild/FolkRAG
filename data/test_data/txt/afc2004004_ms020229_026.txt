[out] 'roon' dere.  I reckon they's all countrymen, ya know.  I reckon
they thought they's gonna break the rug.  An' when, when he
said that, they -- one went one way an' one went another'n.  
Ain't nobody said nothin' to nobody.  An' I met lot a friends
I know, ya know, 'way back, ya know, a long time ago, old peorples.
I met three or four of 'em, anyway.  An' ah, I was talkin' with
them about it.  They said, "Yeah, honey," say, "It's been really
rough aroun' here."  They say, "But I go to town when I git ready.
'Cause I ain't botherin' none of 'em an' jus' wave m' han' at
'em an' go on."  Said, "They ain't never bothered me or nothin'" an' said, 
[s-said] "But they've been the devil around here."  Takin' peoples
farms; takin' peroples cars, but...
Burnt this ol' man's barn up.  Burnt up his tractors, every-
thing, out there.
AL:  What?
BJ:  This ol' man that went -- this, ah, colored man I tellin'
ya about?  Burnt his barn up, tractors, all his, ah, stuff he
had in there -- gas.  Had to git -- he had his own gas out there,
ya know.  You know, git it in them tanks.  An' all like that.
All that, just blowed up, an' everything.  An' th-- ah' ah --
But, look what they done:  Opened the lot gates so the
mule could git out...The mules got out...An' burnt up every
thing, all the food an' all the feeds, you know, the meal an'
the corn an' oats an' stuff they had in there.
AL:  Some cracker slipped in there and...
BJ:  That's right.  Tha's right...They seed 'im, too.  Runnin'

in there.  Th-they see when he ketch 'im, I reckon.  'Cause after they caught,
