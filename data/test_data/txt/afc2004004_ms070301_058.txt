And when Pat came ovr the hill, his coleen fair to see
His low but shrill, the signal for to be
O Mary the mother cried
There is someone whistling sure
O mother [you know] tis the wind you know
That's whistlin thru the door
    With my fa diddle lau-da la
    "       "       "    "       "     "  lee
    "       "       "    "       "     "
    "       "       "    "       "     "    "

I've lived a long time, Mary, in this wide
                              world [I] my dear
But the door to whistle like that I never 
                              yet did hear
But mother you know the fiddle
Hangs close beside the chink & the wind upon
                              the strings
Do playing the tune I think
â€“
The dog is barking now, the fiddle can't play the
                                                         tune
But mother you know they say dogs bark at the
                                              light of the moon
But how can he see the moon when he is old 
                                                        & blind
Blind dogs don't bark at the moon you know
Nor fiddles play with the wind
