I took delight in old songs. I liked 'em. I do now.
I like an old song.  I'd go anywhere if I heard anyone
was going to sing up the old songs.  Now its hard to
find one.   I wouldn't listen to a song what they
make today.  I'd never take one up to learn, cause
there ain't one worth it.  They ain't my line.  I've
learnt olden tunes, & the old fancies aways. & that's
what I've got to keep in.  And they can do what they
like - but they ain't got it. They can't sing a song, not
with any sense in it.  Not like I can.

The first pub I started to sing in was the
Union Tavern when I was about eleven, &
went along with my father.  They kidded me up
to singing there.  I sung 2 or 3 songs, & sent
round the hat.  I got a few pence, copper or two
Then I gradually worked into it as I got older.
When I used to go into these here pubs they would
never let me have a rest.  "Give us a song" that's
how they'd start

Your father was nice to you, was he?
Ah yeh, he was alright.  Yes, we were alright there,
crawling about.  He never done nothing to us.
