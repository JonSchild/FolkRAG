or three days after that, it don' eetch ya, don't bother ya no
more.  Ya jus' stand it 2 or 3 days, it don't worry ya no more.
But them first 2 or 3 days, brother, gi' you a fit!  An' if you
dig it, then you got so's.  Lot a folks, they neck, jus' eat up,
jus' got to put sumpin' around they neck, 'cause they done scratched
it, ya see?  An' it jus' goes in there, jus' [big] makes so's, that's rigght.
An' you stand it two, three days, you know, it don't even worry
you.  
     An' you can see it, when the people be goin', an' on them
trains, you know, with them, ah, then hauling cane:  They
have trai-- ah, cane trains, [bight] run on all aroun' diffrunt places:
they load the cane, now.  And ah, used to they'd have, had big ol'
tractor things.  [All so (also?) many] Also, when the tractors was going, you'd see
[see,] the dust so bad until you, you cain't hardly see it.  The
man what drivin' had to wear, uh, goggles, you know, all over
they face?  An' jus' aroun' here, jus', ow, don' know what color
he was.  You don' know wheth' he white or colored.  Black as,
aw, ya never see such a black!  'Cause that stuff jus' settle, 
that cake settle, just cakes on the face.  [He] They have to wear them
goggles so [he] they could see.  They, when [he'd have] they got to keep the goggles
wiped off, ya see.  B'cause that dust would fly.  Ooh, that muck
dust is sumpthin' else.  Great smokes of dust.
     An' it's funny there, ah, when ya have your clo'es out.
They be as white as they can be an' that dust can just fly,
fly!  An' after it over, you shake 'em.  Jus' shake 'em a time
or two, it's all off; don't worry ya, any more.  But, an-anyway,
it don't stick, like, lessen it's wet.  An' it wet, it
ain' gonna fly, quite natchully.  Ya see.
So that's jus' ah, ah, jus' a peculiar place of that way.
