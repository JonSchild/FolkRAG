Two employees at Remington Arms in Denver: 
"I understand that England has about three or four million well trained soldiers.  They are claiming that if they sent their soldiers to aid Russia, Germany would invade England and capture it without much trouble. I agree with some of the boys at the plant that we should send a few million of our soldiers over to England and tell them that we will guard England for them and then they can send their soldiers to help Russia. It seems to me that the English are looking out for England and for themselves."  [*8-7 24*]
