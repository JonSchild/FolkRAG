schemes with the results of the different analyses being used in different
ways. At this time, no uniform classification scheme will be suggested
because of the special emphasis which will develop in each community for
the local rumors. The Office of War Information will advise those
Research Directors who desire guidance in this.
        The Bureau of Intelligence of the Office of War Information maintains
a continuous rumor study., All non-local rumors should be referred to
them for treatment. A first processing of non-local rumors in the field
by the local rumor control projects would be highly desirable. It would
provide local information people with some general perspective and relieve
the Bureau of the pressure of the additional material requiring analysis. 
The Bureau of Intelligence is responsible for completing these analyses and 
making the appropriate recommendations to the proper agencies. Though the
Bureau will provide Research Directors with special information concerning
the classification schemes to be used with non-local rumors, it should be
understood that this class of rumors must not be used in local rumor campaigns
except at the express direction of the Office of War Information.
