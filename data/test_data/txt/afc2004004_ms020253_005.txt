TL:  And they mostly rolled it up or did they leave it hang out?

BJ:  No, they rolled it, when they go on to churches an' things.
But they wropped (wrapped), they wropped hair mos' of the time.
With strings...They take strings an' wrop their hair.  Jus' like
I've got this hair now.  Jus' take me a string an' wrop it.

TL:  A whole lot of them like that?

BJ:  All [underscored] of it, all over, as much as you want.  Then when you take
it loose, it's straight.

TL:  Oh, yeah?  Is that what --

BJ:  Sure, you put string on your hair now, they think you ain't
got no sense.  Heh, but I know that wroppin' hair [underscored].  It makes your hair
grow [underscored], great goodness!

TL:  Does it really?

BJ:  Yeah.  And when you take it loose, then, see, it, it's
already straight.  It never does be, you know, unstraight.  Yeah,
you can take it loose.  Jus' wrop it.  I can wrop my own hair now,
if I wanted to.  Jus' wrop it up.

TL:  Well, I'll be darned.  They used to wrop it up to make it
straight, then?

BJ:  Yeah, an' it be -- an' it grow, too.  An' that take care of the
ends [underscored] of it.  The wind don't never get to the ends to break it off.

TL:  The wind, huh?

BJ:  Yeah, the wind what breaks the end of the hair off... Yeah.
'Cause you see, your hair don't come out from the root; it breaks
off from the end.  See, the roots continue to grow.  But your hair
breaks off on the end.  An' it's, an' it's easy to break off, ya
know, when, when, 'cause the wind an' the cold, ya know, and all
like that ya' know.

TL:  The weather, hum?
