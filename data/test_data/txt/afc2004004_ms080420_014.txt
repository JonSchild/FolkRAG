kept alive one of America's oldest and beautiful folk
traditions. We're on Sheepback Mt. looking down at
Maggie Valley, the absolute capital of American square
dancing. The man coming toward us on his tractor is one
of the captains of square dancing, Kyle Edwards, who's up
here clearing himself some down, so he can build himself
a new house. We're gonna have a talk with hin, he's a 
wonderful man. Kyle, come on down here and talk to us.
What you doing up here?

Kyle:  We're fixing a pad here, build a log cabin for
me and my family.

AL:  You look like you're pretty professional with this
machine, this bulldozer.

KYLE:  Not really, I love to do it. My boy says it's my
hobby.......For about 20 years.

AL:  That the way you make your living partly?

Kyle:  Yes sir.
