Lubback, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thanks so much for you letter of October 1st. I attach
the list of selections which I made, and would be very grateful
indeed if you would send me your notes about them by air mail
special delivery as soon as you can. There is now considerable
urgency in making a final compilation of this series.

I shall certainly be most careful with the handling of all
the records, especially the originals. You can rest assured that
no harm whatever will befall them.

I am returning to you now the manuscript which you let me
see the other day, and which I have copied. I enclose a copy
for your own use as it may be useful to you.

I feel sure that this is going to be a very successful series,
and I am looking forward so much to beginning its preparation with
your records.

With all good wishes,

Yours sincerely,

Felix Greene

P.S. I have been in touch with Leadbelly and he has sung some
songs for me. He is coming again on Wednesday, when I
shall make some recordings of him. I have not, therefore, included
any of his songs on the attached list, with the exception of the
"Governor Allen Pardon Song" which I believe he sings rather better
in your record than he is able to sing now.
