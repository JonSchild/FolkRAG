safely [ashore] to the [island] land. After a few days she
and the elephant became [greatly] quite attached, and
she abandoned her plan of going away in
the collapsible canvas boat which she had
in her pack, for one of a simple life on the
island. "However before we decide on this, we
must be sure our progeny will be Aryan,"
she announced. "This island must be peopled
by Germanic stock, to join with
Deutschland in her triumphal march Eastward.
May I see your family tree?" "There is
only one on the island," replied the slightly
bewildered elephant. "I have carefully stumped out
every other." "A true German!" she cried,
embracing him fondly. "We will live here
forever in its shade, and our children will
grow up with their noble ancestry always
before them. What a matchless opportunity!
Every day they may view it with pride;
every day they may reflect on the purity
of their stock."

So they lived together very happily until
one day the Hitler Jugend maiden decided


that, due to the fact that she was going to have
twelve children, she had better prospect for
another island to which to send the oldest ones.
"Our own land will soon not be able to support
its population - at least not over six
more," she said, and without ado she embraced
her husband affectionately and sailed
away in the collapsible canvas boat, leaving
the elephant rather astonished and
waving her farewells from his stance under
the palm tree.

She never came back. The elephant
often speculated as to what had happened
to her; but in a few years gave that up
in order to engage in serious reflection
on his wife's oft-repeated words, "Ein Volk,
ein Reich, ein FÃ¼hrer.' He always [wondered] held it to be
extremely important to keep abreast of current
political thought. He lives all alone now with
the palm tree, and I understand he [concluded] has recently concluded
that his island [must be] [to] is the embodiment of the Ideal German
State.
