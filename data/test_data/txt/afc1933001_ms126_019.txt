of the songs as well as the name of the communicant and
I shall send them to you. I feel confident that I
have them here in Chapel Hill with me.

will you please send me [the] a list of all the
songs I have deposited in the Library, together with
the number you have [placed] used to designate
the record containing the song. In my dissertation
I want to include this information. Moreover,
I should like to have at least three verses of
each song transcribed onto an aluminum disc
so that I can let the musician who is to transcribe
these lines have the discs to work with.
Since I am going ahead with my dissertation
now, I should like to have these records and
the other information as soon as possible.

Mr. Spivacke has agreed to put a three-year
restriction on these records. I promise to
release them just as soon as my dissertation
is out of the way. If I am able to go straight
through with my work, as I now hope to do, I
may need only a two-year restriction. 

May I hope that you do not have too much
trouble making these words and the records
agree. If so, it may be possible that I can run
up to Washington some week end to help straighten
them out, that is, if my "ship" comes in.

With all good wishes, I am

Cordially yours,

AC Morris
