(Piano)     That was the "Kansas City Stomp." You  may
notice that in playing jazz, the breaks are one of the most
essential things that you can ever do in jazz.  Without 
breaks and without clean breaks and without beautiful ideas
in breaks, - you don't need to even think about doing anything
else, if you can't have a decent break, -- you haven't got a jazz
band or  you can't even play jazz.
Questioner:  Show us a good break, Jelly. (Piano)
Morton:  That is what you call a pretty good break.  For
an instance, I will play just a little bit of melody of something 
and show you.  (Piano)  That is what you call a break.
(piano)   Maybe I had better play something that you can understand 
more, for an instance "Strutters' Ball."  (Piano)  I 
made those breaks kind of clean because the fact of it is
everybody know this tune and they know how it is played and
they know where the break come in. Without a break, you have
nothing.  Even is a tune haven't a break in it, it's always
necessary to arrange some kind of a spot to make a break,
because without a break, as I said before, you haven't got jazz--
and your accurate tempos with your backgrounds of your figures
which is called riffs today.  Of course, that happens to be a 
musical term, riffs.
Question:   What's the difference between a riff and a 
break. Aren't they about the same thing?
