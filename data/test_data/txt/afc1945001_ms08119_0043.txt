1 A man was found dead in an apartment. He had no shoes on. When the detective came, he remarked, "He
must have used stamp No. 17."
2 A week ago last Saturday a friend of mine told me 
that, starting at midnight that night, clothes woudld be rationed
and so she bought herself a lot of clothes that night. 
3  Some people think that just to have the ration stamps gives
them the food without paying for it.
