SONGS OF HARION STRIKERS - JULY 1929

(Tune: We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder
Page 62 - Y. W. C. A. - Song Book)


We are building a strong Union,
We are building a strong Union,
We are building a strong Union,
Workers in the mill.

Every member makes us stronger,
Every member makes us stronger,
Every member makes us stronger,
Workers in the mill.


THE PICKET LINE

(Tune: Polly-wolly-doodle)
Page 59 - Old Favorite Songs)


The Union is the place for me,
The place for working men
Who want some time to sing and play,
And money we can spend.

Chorus: On the line, on the line, on the picket picket line,
We'll win our fight, our fight for the right
On the picket, picket line.

I am a Union man because I want a living wage,
We'll stick together, we'll fight together,
We'll get that living wage.

Chorus: On the line, on the line, on the picket picket line,
We'll win our fight, our fight for the right
On the picket, picket line.

The man who scabs is the man who's yellow
And is a sight to see,
We'll kick him out, we'll keep him out,
With the picket, picket line.

Chorus: On the line, on the line, on the picket picket line,
We'll win our fight, our fight for the right
On the picket, picket line.
