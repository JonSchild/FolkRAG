there, too. They would have the pipes playing and people all
dancing and they'd have a jolly feed and a good dram. Oh
those were the days.
Lomax: How many brothers and sisters did you have?
Davy: I have my oldest brother was Jimmy Stewart. He was an
old African soldier - Boer War - he was in the British Legion
Pipe Band in Aberdeen, and he dropped dead on parade one
morning at a big parade held in Aberdeen about twelve years
ago. So that was the oldest brother. All through the African
wars. Then I had another brother - Robert - he died about
five years ago in Inverness. He was a great piper, too. The
other one was Donald - he was younger than Robert. He died in
Peterhead. He was a god piper too. A long time - he come all
through the '14 war. Then there was Johnny. Johnny lives in
Aberdeen. He'd be about 65 now. But he was never no musician.
Hecouldn't play nothing at all. Maybe sing a song, but he
could never manage to play accordions or pipes or nothing.
He never put his mind to it. Then my sister, my eldest sister
was Margaret - she was married to a man called Jamie
Muirison - lived in Aberdeenshire, and went hawking with the 
motor-car every day, had the motor-car instead of a horse, and
used to gather rags, scarp-iron, every kind. She died, too,
two or three years ago. Then there was me - no - my sister
Christina. She lived in Fetterangus, Aberdeenshire. She'd be
62 or thereabouts. Then there was a sister Susan.
Lomax: Did she marry a tinker, too?
Davy: Yes, but lived now in a house for years. They're travellers
live in Fetterangus. House there. Big family - all married. Some
of the family's married to farmers up there. One of her boys is
married to that great accordion player Jean Stewart. Often
heard her on the wireless. That's Kevin McClory's aunt is
married to my sister's boy, Donald Stewart. Then there's a sister
Susan. She lives beside myself in Dundee. She's a big family too.
5 or 6 sons and they all play accordions, and her man, Old
Jock Hutchinson - a good piper - but unfortunately he was away
about fifteen years ago and never come back. Because he was an
awful man for the booze. Now and again he comes round Dundee,
but goes away and you don't see him for five or six months.
Goes across to Ireland and goes back - pearl fishes all the
rivers for pearls. Then there's myself. I'll be 57 on 1st of
April. And another girl married in Aberdeen. Her name is 
Jeannie. She's married to a man called Jimmy Higgins, lives in
Aberdeen. Both travels, -- cart, out buying rags and scrap-iron.
Lomax: Jeannie is your sister? Jeannie Robertson?
Davy: Oh no, Jeannie is my second cousin. Her mother was a
cousin of mine.
