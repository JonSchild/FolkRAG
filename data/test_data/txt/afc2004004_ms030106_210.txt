They had a market right under our place - the hotel.  I couldn't
stick with him (Zack) because he was stealing my money.

A.  Why did you stick with him at all?

M.  I didn't know that at all.  He was so crooked.  I was trusting everything
to his honesty since he was a home boy and I had always known
him, well, maybe, to be straight.  So Zack was a tough man to get
along with because he had those dollar and a quarter steaks and I didn't
care so much for steak - especially those big ones, like he did and
my wife used to cook em for him - every morning when he came to work,
he had that steak.  But we had a lotta money and money was no object.
In fact I used to keep a top tray full of bales of bills, sometimes
as they were ones and twos and fives and sometimes tens.  But they'd be
in bales.  Once I told a fellow that I had a trunk of money and I brought
him in the hotel to show him and I just opened the top tray and he
was so excited to see the top tray full of bills, he just decided the
trunk was full.
A.  How were you and Anita getting along?
M.  We was getting along well.  It's a day that I can't like to bring back
because I never realized how happy I was until after I left her.  There
was nothing under the sun that I ever wanted that I didn't get during
that time, but 2 things.  And those two things - one of em was a 
yacht and the other was a cow.  I never did have a cow - I wanted that
and I wanted a yacht, but after I looked up the pric for yachts I said
I couldn't handle a yacht and upkeep was tremendous.  But outside of
that everything was swell.  We finally moved around the corner from
12th and Central to Pico St.  We had a private apartment there because
her mother didn't care for the hotel so much.
     I always lived with her and her mother.  It was the group because
she personally looked out for her mother, in spite of the fact that 
she had seven other brothers.  But they always depended on her to look
