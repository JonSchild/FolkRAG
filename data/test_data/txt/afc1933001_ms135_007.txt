July 1, 1938.

Mr. Art Ford,
c/o Connor Mill,
Laona, Wisconsin.

Dear Mr. Ford:

Sidney Robertson has written me at length
about the songs that you and your family and
Charles and Bob Walker know.

I am coming to Wisconsin this summer to
make records of Wisconsin folk songs for the
Library of Congress and I want to come to see
all of you and record the songs that you know.
I would like to know when you are going to be
at home and what would be the best time for me 
to drop by and call on you.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
