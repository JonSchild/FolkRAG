My dear Mr. Kane: 

I am enclosing the results of the survey 
of rumors in circulation from August 10 till noon, August 
15.  You will note that I have segregated the rumors so 
as to show how many individuals made reports.  I had quite 
a number of people working on this but many said that they 
did not hear any rumors during the week.  I am sending in 
these reports for what they may be worth though some of 
them may not classify technically as rumors.  

Very truly yours, 
Tommie Dora Barker
