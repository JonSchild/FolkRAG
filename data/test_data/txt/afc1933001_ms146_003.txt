Mr. Alan Lomax - Page 2                                                               June 1, 1939



above everything else at the National Music Council, the last meeting of which
we had last Saturday and Davidson Taylor attended as usual. I believe that
deep down he is one of our best allies and one of the most sincere men in the
music profession in this country. Therefore the news about his proposal delights
me and I should hate to have you give it up. I don't think there is 
another man in this country who could do the job as well as you can. You might
need aid for certain special subjects but this should be easy to obtain. You
can always call in consultants and I assure you the Library will stand by you
in such a project. In fact the whole thing might originate here but this is a
detail we can discuss later. At any rate I suggest that you ask Dave Taylor
for a delay of about a week in view of the White House performance. I am sure
that he will understand the situation and give you this extra time. If you
want me to, I shall gladly write him and explain.

I do not think that he plans a full time job for you and I feel sure that 
some arrangement can be made with the Library so that you can handle both
things. If it pays well you might even make a weekly trip to New York. We
are used to such things in this institution and often encourage them.

3) I suggest that you accept the American Writers Congress' invitation.
In fact anything like that will help us right now and do not hesitate to have
yourself introduced all over as the Assistant-in-charge of the Archive of
American Folk-Song. Such publicity will be mutually beneficial.

5 and 6) I shall recommend payment of all the bills you have sent, including
those for the two singers.

You can well imagine what a shock it was to hear of the Carnegie Foundation's
refusal but I know you will be with me when I say that we are not licked yet and
that we have just begun to fight. I have already communicated with the Department
of the Interior and made an appointment for the first of next week to discuss the 
possibility of a mutual duplication project. But even at best this will only
be a make-shift and not very practical for the many small orders which we can
expect. I have sent out several feelers but it is too early to say just what
line we should [proceed] follow. You may rest assured that I shall keep after this until
we succeed.

I imagine that the Council will send you your grant very shortly. Having
called them so often I hesitate to bother them again.

I shall await work from your father before answering the WPA request for
the use of the Mississippi records.

Please let me know immediately when you will be here and if you keep your
evenings free I should like to arrange for a private performance or two.
Regards!

Chief, Division of Music

P.S. Please do not mention the Carnegie Foundation matter to anyone. I should
not want the Seegers to hear about it, especially as he seems worried about his
own job at the present moment. Anything may happen soon.
