COMPANY "C" VICTORY SONG

We will hang the old Mikado to a cherry blossom tree,
We will hang the old Mikado to a cherry blossom tree,
We will hang the old Mikado to a cherry blossom tree,
As we go marching on.

Glory glory we are raiders, glory glory we are raiders.
Glory glory we are raiders, and we'll go marching on.

We will take the rising sun and we will set it in the west
We will take the rising sun and we will set it in the west
We will take the rising sun and we will set it in the west
As we go marching on.

CHORUS OVER AGAIN.

We will take the little corporal for a one way ride,
We will take the little corporal for a one way ride,
We will take the little corporal for a one way ride,
As we go marching on.

CHORUS OVER AGAIN.

We will bury Mussolini in a big brick tomb,
We will bury Mussolini in a big brick tomb,
We will bury Mussolini in a big brick tomb,
As we'll go marching on.

COMPANY "D" MARCHING SON
(Far, Far Away)

Around her hair she wore a purple ribbon,
She wore it in the springtime and in the month of May
And if you ask her why the hell she wore it --
She wore it for a Raider man who's far, far away.
Far away (Far away) -- Far away (Far away)
She wore it for a Raider man who's far, far away.

Around her thigh she wore a purple garter;
She wore it in the springtime and in the month of May.
And if you ask her why the hell she wore it --
She wore it for a Raider man who's far, far away.
Far away (Far away) -- Far away (Far away)
She wore it for a Raider man who's far, far away.

Around the block she pushed a baby carriage;
She pushed it in the springtime and in the month of May.
And if you ask her why the Hell she pushed it --
She pushed it for a Raider man who's far, far away.
Far away (Far away) -- Far away (Far away)
She pushed it for a Raider man who's far, far away.
