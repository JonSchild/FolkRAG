My dear friend:

    Alan Lomax will be on the program at the meeting of
the Texas Folk Lore Society to be held in San Antonio the first
week in May. If you wish him to come by and sing and talk
about Folk Songs to a Waco audience, he will be available, either
just before he speaks at San Antonio or immediately thereafter.
It is only incidental that Alan is my son. I do not think that
fact influences my judgment when I tell you that he puts on a
grand show. His youth and personality, his charming ability to
sing folk songs as they should be sung and the wide variety that
he is able to offer, all combine to put his show over. I guar-
antee that he will not disappoint you. His fee is $100.00 for
one engagement.

    I believe I told you that I am not a great admirer of
the President of Baylor and I feel sure that he thinks far less
of me. This is an unfortunate circumstance at the present mo-
ment, but I have to tell you the truth. I'm sending, also, a
note to Mrs. Witt, but I doubt whether she has the time or incli-
nation to help with the venture. As the Lomax name is pretty well
known, some of your musical organizations might make some money
out of the project. Don't bother to answer this letter if the propo-
sition comes to you at a time when you're not able to take it up.

    Sincerely your friend,
    John A. Lomax
