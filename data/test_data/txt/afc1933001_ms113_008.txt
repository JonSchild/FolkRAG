Dear Bess:

I am sending you a copy of my disserta-
tion which I originally presented to your
father, and which he left in the Archive.
I suppose you should still regard this as
his personal copy, and therefore on loan
from him to you. I have recently been in 
touch with the University of Nebraska
Press in regard to the possibility of re-
printing the book; but unfortunately the
type has been distributed. The only solu-
tion now would be to have it reprinted by
offset, or revised and republished. I am
glad that you can find use for it. 

Are you getting any war songs these
days, and is there any way of my having
dopies?

Please accept my heartiest, though
tardy, congratulations on your marriage.

With best wishes,

Faithfully,

B.A.Botkin, Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
