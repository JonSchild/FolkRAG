Dear Mr. Lomax:

The song that Miss Dennis asks about is not
in the Missouri collection, nor have I ever heard of it before.
The person likeliest to know about it, after yourself, is probably
your predecessor in the Archives, Robert Gordon. He was at one
time much concerned with railroad songs. But I suppose whatever
he collected is still in your hands as Archivist. And I do not
know his present address. The next best chance is, perhaps,
Carl Sandburg.

I'm sorry that I cannot trace this item for you and for
Miss Dennis. I'm busy these days (being retired and a Carnegie
pensioner) getting my Missouri collection ready to print.

Sincerely yours,
H. M. Belden
