Taylor our cataloguing problems, have
read all the W. P. A. written project
copy - I will have to go to a painter -
[?]. It is easier to keep on than to 
stop.
I appreciate your tolerance and
cooperative attitude. I do have
a lot of problems hard to explain at 
long distance - especially car
trouble $200 (min. estimate)
this summer.
My next address will be Detroit
To Mr. Newsome, 217 Wood - 
Ward Ave.,. You might read me
the date on my last voucher.
Yours,
Alan
