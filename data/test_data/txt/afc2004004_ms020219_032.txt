BJ TAPE 6, p. 30

BJ:     [I guess] They sang all kinda blues an' things...They had, they had a,
a regular, ah, ah song, ah thing about the beans.   About, about
about, "The wuss mistake I ev -- " I, I don't know it all; I
can't think of it now:
               "The wuss mistake I ever made
                When I bo'd (board) the train for the Everglade..."
Ha, le's see, "They was down there..."  Le's see, said, "They
was ah...they was pickin' an' they was pickin' beans.  Yeah:
               They was pickin' peas an' pickin' beans,
               It's the wuss -- the biggest -- crowd that I had ever
               seen..."
That, that where the Nicodemus (?) come at, too.   An' um, I, I
jus' can't think 'bout it, all that.   Anyhow, that, I, I'll
git that.   I got it somewhere in my trunk.   But that's home.  I got
all that written down.
AL:    Have you?
BJ:     Uh-huh.   I got all that written down.   An; ah, an', an' this
thing about myse'f, I got that written down, too.  When, when
I come out from ah, this, this drinkin' business, ya know.   An'
seed myse'f.   I got that written down, too.

[*BJ'S TOAST*]
AL:    Is that a poem or.?
BJ:     It's a poem.   That, ah, about myse'f.   That's written down.
Ah...it's a...poem I made.   And, I used to love to sing all 
the time; I didn't care what I was singin'. I used to study
toases (toasts), just study'm. Ah, meanin' in it.   'Cause they
was bad; they was toases.   ['Cause] 'Co'se they's -- these lil' things
that folks call toases, I, some of 'em, I don' call anything.
Ain' nothin' to it.   "Good luck to ya," an' "Puttin' the bo'l
(bottle) to ya" an'           .  We say, "Toases;" we say it.
