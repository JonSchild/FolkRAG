Warden
Louisiana State Penitentiary
Angola, Louisiana

Dear Sir:

Some time ago I wrote to an inmate at the state penitentiary
by the name of Oakdale Carriere and I have as
yet received no reply from this man and since the matter
is of government business I would greatly appreciate an
attempt by your prison to try and locate this party.
Would you be so kind as to give me whatever assistance
you can, and I am enclosing an air mail envelope for your
convenience. Thanking you in advance, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
