Mrs. Ruby T. Lomax

Dallas, Texas

Dear Mrs. Lomax:

    The disks, both blanks and recorded,
arrived safely, and we are very glad to have them.
From a preliminary hearing it would seem
that some of the Negro spirituals are ex-
cellent. I hope to give you a more detailed
report later.

    It is good to hear that Mr. Lomax is
improving. I hope he gets time to work on
his Adventures of a Ballad Hunter. If I
can be of any help, please let me know.

    We are having a very poor spring so
far, though we have found time between the
cold and the rain to put in a victory
garden.
 
    With best wishes to both of you,
    Faithfully,
