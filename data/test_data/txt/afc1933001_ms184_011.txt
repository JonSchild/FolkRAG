My Dear Sir: I am writing you in 
regard to the songs that I forwarded you some time ago.

I would like very much to have
the three copies of the songs as per the agreement that
you asked me to sign. You stated in your letter that you
would send me the records of my songs.

I realize that I am a prisoner,
and I wrote those songs with the purpose of helping my
future life, but it seems as tho there is a lack of co-
operation somewhere. 

I sent in the last statment on
May 20th, or 22nd, and I was as prompt as one could be,
therefore I would like to hear from you as soon as poss-
ible.

Hoping that this matter will be
adjusted for our mutual benefit, I beg to remain,

Cordially

CASEY SMITH.
