Major Eugene L. Harrison
Fort Bragg, North Carolina

Dear Major Harrison:
Good friend Colonel Ike Spading [?] [?] your
songs to me. I'm very glad to have them, and would
greatly appreciate your keeping in mind the fact that
I would like to gave copies of any other songs which
crop up in the regiment from time to time. 

Very truly yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
