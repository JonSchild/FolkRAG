My dear Mr. Lomax:

Thanks so much for your note from Mobile.

Your records have been received, and we
shall, of course, leave them untouched until
you arrive.

I have written recently to Professor Smith.
This is, however, the busiest time of the year
for me, and I have, as yet, had no opportunity
to complete the account of the work of the Archive,
which he has asked me to send him.

Your son John teleported today for information
about Alan. I may as well repeat here what we told
him over the phone--that our last report from Alan,
in which he speaks of his marriage, was received on
the first of this month, and that the Librarian has
approved his continuing in Haiti until an unspecified
date in April.

Faithfully yours,

OS:ep
