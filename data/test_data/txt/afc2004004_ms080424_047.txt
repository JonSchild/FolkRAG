TAPE: Roll 49 Stanley and Ed  2
Stan: He finally got one workin' you know.
Ed: He never get one of these...
Stan: Not what you think...(Not one of your things?)
Ed: Where we was at , he said "(unint.)"...I'm gonna get a G.
Stan: There you go.......
Ed: You see the way this works Stanley?
Stan: Yeah I see the way it works.
Ed: Got my finger right down through there...rub them notches...got the 
G goes over down that way.
Stan: What's it do the other way when you get to it?
Ed: If I want it to go the other way, I just slide my finger off, rub my 
thumb against the other side on the other side over here.
Stan: Probably I could learn to operate one of those things...
ED: I'll bet you could...It's vibration that stick someway or another...
Techn: Ed, could you show us again how to do it?
Ed: Oh well, you start here with your finger like this, you rub it 
down the side like that...and you rub these notches at the same finger 
...that transfers ...holds the vibrations one side and transfers it to 
the other side of the stick. If you want it to go the other way, you 
let your finger off of it, rub your thumb down on this side, and that 
changes the vibration to the other side of the stick, and it'll turn it 
the other way. Simple little devil to operate after you learn, but 
it's a problem to learn.
AL: Does science understand how the thing works?
Ed: No, scientists have tried to understand about it, some of the top 
scientists they just can't...They know it's vibrations of (unint.) but 
they don't know why rubbing one side will run it one way and rubbing it
