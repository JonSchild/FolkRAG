2) I'm sorry, my neighbours, I married this fair one,
She favours the neighbours and none of her own.
She goes out every evening to balls and to parties,
And leaves me here rocking the cradle alone. (Cho.)

3) And come all you young fellows that want to get married,
Take my advice and leave the women alone,
For it's by the lord Harry if you ever marry,
They'll leave you there rocking the cradle alone. (cho.)

Mrs. McGrath.
1) O then Mrs. McGrath, the sergeant said,
Would you like to make a soldier out of your son, Ted?
With a new fur coat and a big cocked hat
Now Mrs. McGrath, wouldn't you like that?
Refrain:
With your too-ri-a, fol-the-diddle-a,
Too-ri-hoo-ri-oo-ri-ha. (2)
Love and the cracker-o.

2) Now Mrs. McGrath lived on the sea shore
For the space of seven long years or more,
When she saw a big ship sailing into the bay
"Here's my son Ted, - whishee - clear the way."

3) O then Captain, dear, where have you been,
O have you been sailing on the Mediterreen?
Or have ye any tidings of my son Ted,
Is the poor boy living or is he dead?

4) O then up comes Ted without any legs
And in their stead he has two wooden pegs,
She kissed him a dozen times or two,
crying, "Holy Moses, it isn't you!"

5) O were you drunk or were you blind
When you left your two fine legs behind?
Or was it the working on the sea
Wore your two legs from the knees away?

6) No, I wasn't drunk nor I wasn't blind
When I left my two fine legs behind.
But a big cannon ball on thr fifth of May
Took me two fine legs from the knees away.

7) O then Teddy, me boy, the widow cried,
Your two fine legs were your mummy's pride.
Those stumps of a tree wouldn't do at all,
Why didn't you run from the big cannon ball?
