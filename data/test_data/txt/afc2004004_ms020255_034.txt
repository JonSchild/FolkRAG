on 'is tail.  An' said a voice spoke.  He say he say it.  He
don' know whe' (whether) the bull say it or not.  But he say he
say it.  "Which one a these bags would you choose for a doctor?"
     See, all his work was done.  Now all he had to do was choose.
An' so he say he stood there an' look an' wonder what mus' he do.
So he jus' reached out an' got that in his mouth.
     He say when he bow his head an' come riz up, i' was a man.
Say he said, "You choose the right bag.  If you'd choose that'n
on my haid, you'd done very well."  You know, he'd been good
all right.  "If you choose that on my side, you'd been a half-hand
doctor.  On the tail, you'd been the tail end of every
thing."  See?  That's the same thing it i' with the moon.
Same way; ya got to be right.  Got to choose the right things;
if ya don't, ya won't git it.  Now, he  coulda did -- whatsoever
that he'd a-got he'd a-had that until he died an' that'd been
all the wuss, 'cause no mo' ta come.  See?  Same thing I tell ya
about the bone.  Whatsoever you make yourself, that what you are.
An' tha's it.  An' he got that; he's the head of it.
     An' he said that when he opened that thing, said it looketed
to him like sumpthin' in it like ground up, parched, rabbit
tobacco.  See.  An' he kep' it.  From the devil.  Said it looked more 
like the devil, you know, that dust.  But 't was ground up, likem
rabbit tobacco, see?  An', an', this ah, and he kept it where 
he had to keep it; he didn't tell us where he had to keep it, that
was his business.
     But that man was out this world.  He was a medicine.  An'
he would learn folks ta be, ta, ta do things, but they had to
go through something.  All that nasty mess.  An' ah, so, he tol' us
this, though. . .
