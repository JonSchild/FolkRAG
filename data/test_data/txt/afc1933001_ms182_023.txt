Mr. Thomas W. Anderson
4708 Woodland Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio

Dear Mr. Anderson:

I regret to say that since I am not connected with a publishing
house and have no experience as an editor, that submission of your manuscript
to me would be somewhat risky on your part. If, however, the material is
concerned with folklore, I would be more than delighted to look at it and
give you my personal opinion of its value. I assure you that this would be
no imposition.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
