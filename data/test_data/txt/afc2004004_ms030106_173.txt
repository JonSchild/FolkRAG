Orleans with the Indian bands.

Now, here is the way they would sing when they would
be dancing. They'd form a ring and one would get in the
center and he would start his kind of a Indian dance and he'd
be singing, throwing his head back and downward and
stooping kind of over and bending his knees and doing a 
kind of jug dance, I'd call it. And they would say: **

T'ouwais bas q'ouwais

The whole bunch would answer back:

Hou tende
T'ouwais bas q'ouwais
Hou tende 
T'ouwais bas q'ouwais
Hou tende

See, they would have a kind of a rhythm with their heels, like 
this: 

T'ouwais bas q'ouwais
Ou tende
T'ouwais bas q'ouwais
Ou tende
T'ouwais bas q'ouwais
Ou tende

Ala caille llo lo
Ala caille wo

T'ouwais bas q'ouwais
Ou tende
T'ouwais bas q'ouwais
Ou tende

When they would say other things, they would stop for a
minute and throw their head back and say:

Ala caille llo
Ala caille wais
