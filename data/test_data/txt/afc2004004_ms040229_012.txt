Deliver me love from the

       Notes on K. McLeod
         Herdsman might
The band -teacher- beginning the day
with a fiddle-
     Ye (teacher) [?] of other folk what brought
ye here today- My curse on gloom. It
war was a bad teacher- let us to the 
fiddle and the dance-  [It is]  Is it not 
a great sin child of my heart to be
packed into a hole like puffins
when the sun is not down and the
birds so frolicsome.
[?] grown stronger and more mysterious
toward midnight- Sweet is the lark at 
dawn, but sweeter the owls at midnight.
