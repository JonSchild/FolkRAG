"My father [couldn't write his own name] had no
learning. He could write his name - that's all he 
could do - just put Robert Cox. He went fishin' 
for 17 years alongside an old shipper in Yarmouth, 
he couldn't write nor yet read. Yet he learnt 
these songs - and the different tunes they got now 
are all wrong." 
         (Sea Song) - 14th of November frm Yarmouth (93)
"If youre in a country place, I think that is the 
best. You get out in the open, like in a field, and, 
oh, the lovely sunshine coming down onto a man! 
Lovely, you can lie down and have a nap, & 
nobody to come nigh you. You can lay down 
there & go to sleep, nobody 'll never wake you 
up, because there ain't nobody nigh you for a mile
(Country song)

Lomax: What kind of man was Napoleon, anyway?
Harry: Well, I don't consider him bad.  He begged the
father's life s&he granted it.  He couldn't have been
so bad as all that.  'Course, he was the enemy
of England.  He was going to sweep everything.  But
it was Nelson that stopped him.  And that's where
Nelson's song comes in, "The [Hereo] Hero of the Nile."
