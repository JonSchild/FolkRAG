B:  I was once--I went huntin' for a bear, you know.  That
was few years ago, and uh--got my gun and I went out,
so I set down.  They told me, say, you have to--if you
[looko]
lookin' for a bear you have to look for him by his
tracks.  So I looked around and I seed couple bear
tracks, so I said,"Well," I said, "I'm just gonna walk 
around here and walk up and down here,"and so I didn't
see no bear tracks, see.  So I walked up the log and round
and round and different places, then I come back down
the same log, then I went over 'bout well, say a hundred
feet from there and I set down on a stump.  So I set down
there and I was settin' there , restin', so after while
I looked up and I seed this bear, see, and he was--and
he'd done found my tracks where I'd went along and 'stid
of me findin' his tracks he found my tracks.  So he
goes up and down--the same log I went down so I said to
[*Dramatically - almost a whisper*]
myself I said, "Now, wonder whut is he lookin' for?"
So I seed him kep smellin' round, you know, and lookin'
round. So I says, "Well," I says, "I--now I know what
he lookin' for," I says, "I'm sure he lookin' for tracks,"
I says, "But he ain't seed no tracks yet."  I says, "I'm
gonna lay him a few tracks now, brother!"  And you know
I got up and started out, see (laughs through rest of
sentence), and--and I laid him some tracks plum down to
where I live--you know what I mean--about five miles from
there, see.  I put him down aplenty tracks, intween there
and where I was.  (Laughter)  All right, Sonny Boy,
what you gonna do?
