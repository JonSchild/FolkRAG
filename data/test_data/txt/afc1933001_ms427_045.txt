THE YEAR OF JUBILO

Comrades, have you seen the banners that are floating in
the air?
And have you heard the sound of singing in the nation
ev'rywhere?

Chorus:  Don't you look behind,
Look straight ahead, O ho!
For it must be now
There's a good time coming
In the Year of Jubilo!

Young and old, they join the chorus of the best of song
we know,
A song that's called "A good time coming in the year of
Jubilo!

Chorus:

THE ARKANSAW TRAVELER

O h, once upon a time in Arkansaw,
An old man sat in his little cabin door,
And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear,
A jolly old reel that he played by ear.
It was raining hard, but the fiddler didn't car,
He sawed away at the popular air;
Tho' his roof-tree leaked like a water-fall,
That didn't seem to bother the man at all.

A traveler was riding by that day
And stopped to hear him a practising away;
The cabin was a-float and his feet were wet,
But still the old man didn't seem to fret.
So the stranger said: "Now the way it looks to me
You'd better mend your roof".... said he;
But the old man said, as he played away,
"I couldn't mend it now, it's a rainy day."

The traveler replied: "That's all quite true,
But this, I think, is the thing for you to do:
Get busy on a day that is fair and bright,
Then patch the old roof till its good and tight."
But the old man kept on a playing at his reel,
And tapped the ground with his leathery heel.
"Get along," said he, "For you give me pain;
My cabin never leaks when it doesn't rain."
