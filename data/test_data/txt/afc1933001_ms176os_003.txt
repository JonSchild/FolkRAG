inhering in it.
   I now have the assistance of a very
fine voice in my work.  It is cultivated, to be
sure, but I am hoping its owner will be
able to retain the virtues of training without the
artificiality.
   I expect to make some records with him
soon, and because of the generous tone of
your letter I want to send you two of those
I plan to make.  They will contain "Barstow,"
the hitchhikers' inscriptions, a psalm, and
two of three short Chinese lyrics.
   Would you kindly return the article on
the hitchhiker inscriptions?  I have only one
copy left, and with the record of "Barstow"
it will probably be of no further interest to you.
With best regards,
Harry Partch
