The editor of a county weekly newspaper in Jamestown, North
Dakota on August 7, during the course of our conversation mentioned that
a friend of his had just come back from the West Coast and that he was
very indignant with the way unions were conducting the work in the factories
under their jurisdiction.  He stated that the men caulking seams on
ships would come to a joint and when this happened a special caulker had
to be called to caulk the joint which at times necessitated a delay from
thirty minutes to three hours before the men could go on and all the
time the men caulking the regular seam were perfectly capable of caulking
the joint in question.  Also, he stated that men painting the ships  [*E3222*]
could not move their own scaffolding and that when a certain section was
painted, the painters would have to call for the manager of the common
labor union and if no labor was available, they would have to wait a
protracted period of time until such common labor was available to move
the scaffolding probably five or ten feet so the painters could continue
their job.  Painters were receiving anywhere from one to two dollars and
a half an hour; common laborers receiving 60 to 90 cents an hour.[*15*][*N.D.*]
