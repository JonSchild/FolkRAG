About "4 Pence a Day." The
old gaffers in The Mechanics Club, when the
old time miners came to sit everyday &
moon over a coal fire, thot the song
was from T. Raine. Old Langstaff, a
fine local poet reciting a rather fine
[multonic?] piece about time & death,
took us to see T. Paine, the gt.
grandson of the local poet
