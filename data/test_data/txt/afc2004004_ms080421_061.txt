Roll 40 Hicks 2

AL: Are you trying for some land with the bear hide? (???)

Stan: Well, my great-grandpa, he willed us most of his land. 
Then he traded the rest of it fora black and tan dog, and 
a (??) and a sheep hide. Some of them asked him, my grandpa
told me this, some asked him why he traded for the sheep hide.
