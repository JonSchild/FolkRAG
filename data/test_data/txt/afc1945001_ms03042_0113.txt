Mr. Joseph B O'Connor - 8/17/42

Glens Falls 8/6/42 The local draft board seems to have its own ideas of inducting persons, regardless of the general instructions or information which have recently been put out in the daily papers. [*1*]

Glens Falls 8/6/42 The rationing of gasoline is handled on a rather foolish basis. Many salesmen who must operate automobiles to cover their territory effectively are given "B" coupons. This results in undue hardship to them and also seriously affects business. Opinion is that these men should be allowed to have sufficient gasoline to carry on their business  as long as it is available.

Poughkeepsie 8/7/42 Relative to the heavy demand of the armed forces for doctors, the following story is told: A doctor from this area who was called to the service was put to work painting a camouflage at camp. When the signal, indicating that a person was ill or had been injured was given at the camp, the doctor stopped his painting, and after washing his hands, proceeded to the infirmary. Upon arriving at the infirmary, he found that he was the sixth doctor in line to treat the patient. He said after this he would not stop to wash his hands but would head for the inf[*i*]rmary on a dead ruun to be sure he got his hands on the patient first. [*1*]
