Dear Mr. Lomax,

Since you have enclosed the words to "The Last Great
Roundup" in one of your collections of cowboy ballads I thought you
might like to have the story of it.  It was published in a collection
of Centennial songs last year and credit was give C.W. Byron.  I can
remember Bro. Byron and have sung this song in numbers of camp-meetings.

In the Nineties Rev. Byron, who was an Englishman and a one
time circus clown was helping my grandfather Rev. W.L. Harris, (Uncle Levi),
in a series of protracted meetings.  In Scurry County "Uncle Kin"
Elkins, a cowboy rancher of that section was converted.  Later in the
meeting he prayed a prayer so typical of cowboy 'lingo' that the
preachers called to him after the services and as nearly as he could
remember his prayer they wrote it down.  I secured a copy of that
prayer from Rev. W.H. Harris daughter.  (He was a son of W.L. and was song
leader for the services).  The prayer was as follows:

"Oh Lord, round us up in one great round-up
and rope us with the iron of truth and mark us
with the Cross of Calvary:
So when we start on the last great drive
Grant that there shall not be any cut-backs;,
As we appear before the Head Boss in the
Green Pastures of Eternal Reward.... Amen.

The three preachers decided to write a song based on this prayer.
They all claimed credit for the words but to Rev. Byron went the
credit line for the music.  "He was also a ventriloquist, I remember).
