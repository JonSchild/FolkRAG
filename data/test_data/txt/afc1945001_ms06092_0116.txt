   "The C. O. out at Utah Supply Depot asked the contractor who is
doing some construction work there if he would help out by letting his
crew work a day or so for the Depot unloading cars.  The contractor said
he'd be glad to if it was necessary.  The C. O. told him they had 400
cars to unload and the stuff was piling up $25 a day demurrage on each
car because they hadn't been able to get the stuff into the warehouses. 
The contractor wanted to know just how long it took how many men to unload
a car so that he could judge how long it would be before his men could go
back on the job.  The C. O. called in some expert to find the answer and
he didn't know.  Neither did the guy below him or the guy below him.
Nobody knew.  They finally got hold of one lieutenant who knew.  It took
something like five men one day to unload one car.  The contractor did
a little figuring and found out the 400 men could unload 400 cars in
five days.  The stuff had been sitting there for about ten days whereas
the Depot had had 400 men working on it all the time -- that is, they
were supposed to have been working.  When the contractor found this out
he politely told the C. O. to go to hell.  He showed him where they could
have done twice the job in the time they had been fooling around with it
if they hadn't been afraid of a little work.  It was probably news to
the C. O., too, and I imagine he did a bit of hell-raising himself.  It's 
just one of the things you hear, you know, but there's plenty of truth
in.  I know damn well those guys out there don't break their backs earning
that money the Government's paying them."
