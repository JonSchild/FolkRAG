"Two Jazzy Ones"
1) Two whores came down from Canada town
To buy some whiskey and wine
The conversation run like dis
"Your cunt is bigger dan mine."
"You is a liar," said de odder one,
"Your cunt is big as de moon.
The ship went in and sail around
And never come out until June."
Tickle me belly, neck smells
      my slimy flu
Git away you son of a bitch
I'm is one of de whoring coons."
