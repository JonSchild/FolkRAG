Dear Huddie:

I can't tell you how much I appreciate your last two letters and how sorry I am to know that things are not going better with you.  It seems to me that you might be able to get bookings through the new theatre league and other groups.  I've been listening to your work songs and I think they're going to sell extremely well if we cut two or three of them out where you and the quartet weren't together.  I am coming to New York this weekend and may see you.  Send me the name of Blind Lemon Jefferson's best friend.  Much luck to you and Martha.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
