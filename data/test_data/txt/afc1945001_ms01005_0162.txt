Rumor Report

Attached are two copies of an expurgated rumor report.
All references to BOI procedures have been deleted; so, too, have
city names and other positive references possible of news interpretation.

I believe that this should be issued not as a Bureau of
Intelligence release but as a Bureau of Publications and Graphics
release -- to inspire articles, movies, graphics, booklets, and
speeches combating rumor. Its release by the Bureau of Publications 
and Graphics will avoid the publicity which might come from
its release as a BOI report.

I suggest that this be reviewed by someone in the Central
Office before it is approved.
