Control Programs--Information
                 Once it has been decided to blanket a given field of
rumors with information, all outlets available to the project can
be used. These will include newspapers, club publications, lectures,
radio interviews, pamphlets, school projects, library displays,
discussion group materials, etc.
                 Newspapers can offer invaluable aid by contributing
columns called "Did You Know That?" or "Things You Ought to Know,"
providing colorful and dramatic information designed to fight
rumors without specifically mentioning them.

The Continuing Program
                  In addition to the special educational campaigns worked
out on the basis of informational gaps, the continuing purpose of
a rumor-control project may well be to toughen people's minds
against rumors and the repetition of rumors.
                   There are several simple rules which the rumor-control
groups can help to publicize as a major and permanent campaign.
These rules are:
                   1. Never repeat a rumor.
                   2. Do not repeat a rumor verbally, even to deny it.
                   3. If you know the facts which can spike a rumor, cite 
                       the facts promptly.
                   4. If you do not know the facts which can stop a rumor,
                       ask the rumor-teller where he got his facts.
                   5. Don't give a rumor a break.
