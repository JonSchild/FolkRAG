ON THE ASPORTATION OF THE
SCONE STONE

Since David with a pebble in his sling
Goliath slew, now with this heavier stone
A little nation marks the opening
Of a like unequal battle for its own
And splits the atom of Earth's greatest throne.
This though perchance it prove like David's
fling
But "juvenile delinquency" yet may bring
A like result-the giant overthrown!

Scotland knew better than to ask for bread
Merely to get (but took!) a stone instead,
England's stony response full well foreknown.
Far more, O England, than the Scone stone's
gone,
And all the King's horses and the King's men
Cannot set up your Humpty Dumpty again!
