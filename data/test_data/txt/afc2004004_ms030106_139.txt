They had a piano right in the saloon.  I think the
saloons had to close at one o'clock, but that didn't mean 
anything because all they would do was pull the shade down
and keep [em] going all night long. They had a piano right into 
the saloon. Upstairs they had a dance hall that went maybe
once or twice a week. Nothing went into that saloon but
pimps, robbers, gamblers. Aw it's a shame to think about 
how those environments that I really just drifted into. 

Questioner: Tell us about some of them, Jelly. 
Morton: Oh, well, I will tell you about some of 
them. I want to tell you first about Bad Sam and that bunch. 
So every time -- it seems like Benny Frenchy had certain dates to
come at the saloon and when he would come into the Monarch
Saloon that would be the natural drawing card. They would be, 
well, say from that bunch of honky-tonk bunch down at Jim
Kerman's on Winchester and Front on the river in Memphis, 
which was one of the lowest honky-tonks - tough killers
hanging around, prize fighters of the low caliber that would probably
kill you for an argument. 

Well, when Benny would show up, there would be a type 
of those low class whores and some them that was a little better
class; but they would have a way of dancing when he play 
that would run right directly up to the wall with a kind of a 
little bit of a shuffle and slap their hands together and kick
back their right leg. Say -- "Oh, play it, Benny, play it."

Questioner: What did the call that?
