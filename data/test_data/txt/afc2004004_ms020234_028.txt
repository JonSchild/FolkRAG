        An' I'm glad, ya know, that, ah, I don't take nothin' like
that on my brain, 'cause then I b'lieve you go crazy. That what
run some peoples crazy; they'll try to get too full a things; they
wanna do this an' they wanna do that; they...

[* "COMING TO YOURSELF" (RESPONSIBILITIES) *]
        An' they say they love John an' they love Susie, they love
Paul...They don't love 'em all like that.   You cain't love 'em
all like that.                you cain't.     An' when you, when you,
when you...This man preached this, ah, sermon yesterday about, ah,
"You shuck (shaken) up."   You know, "You [always] all shuck up."   An'
that's what you be's, too.   You be all shuck up there.   When ya,
hah, when ya like that, ya don't know what you wanna do.   You see?
When you're with John, you jes' love John; when you're with Jack,
ya love J-Jack.   An' you tell Jack that ya don't like John; an' ya
tell John ya don't like Jack.   You just shuck up, see?   An' you
don't know what ya wanna do; you in bad shape.   So 's best to 
consider with yourself.   'Cause if you could just learn to have
something -- I don't know what -- peoples say if ya talk to yaself,
you're crazy, but I find it['s] to be a wise thing.   All my life,
I talk to myself.   An' so, I find it...That comes out a whole lot.
Um, say you's talkin' to the devil.   You is talkin' to the devil
if you wit' 'im.   But if you ain't wit' the devil, why, you ain't
talkin' to the devil.   So I find it a wise thing to get to yourse'f
an' consider, "What mus' I do?"

[*(THE PRODIGAL SON - WHOLE TALE)*]
BJ:       Ya know when the prodigal son had lef' home?   You read that
in the Bible?   About the prodigal son?   You haven't?
TL:       No.
BJ:       Most everything I ask you about the Bible, you ain't read
it!  Ha, ha! But the -- But the prodigal son, you know, he was ah, he was
a [fahwa] fah-- he was a fahwa'd boy (forward).   You know what a fahwa'd
mean?
