LOMAX NARRATION #4   -14

in 19, one of the songs I recorded in 1934 and that. . .what's
that. . .stop a minute.
     One of the great finds of the 9. . .
     :  Start over again.
LOMAX  Okay.  The most remarkable song for
me that we recorded in 1934 in Louisiana was a, was an
outlaw cowboy song that goes [SINGS FRENCH]  And here comes
the payoff, the verse speaks about going to town with a jug
of whiskey on the palm of his saddle and pistol in his
pocket looking for trouble.  Je, let's see. . . .[SINGS
FRENCH].
     That's it.
     Okay, it's the bottom of page 9.
     The anguish that touched life, the, the
anguish of black life that infuses these tunes of Canray's
and of little Armede Ardoir. . .move across the cast and class
line into Cajun music and gives it that tragic quality
that's so touching and that you hear over and over again in
all these Cajun fait de do songs.
     I think that's it.
     :  That's the end of the recording.  This 
is the end.
[END OF RECORDING]
