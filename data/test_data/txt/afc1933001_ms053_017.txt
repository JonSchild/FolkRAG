Dear Mr. Lomax:

Greetings!

Would greatly appreciate your permission to reprint
for our PIONEER DAYS EDITION some of your cowboy songs and
poetry from your book: "COWBOY SONGS AND OTHER FRONTIER BALLADS,"
which we reviewed two weeks ago.

I wrote to your publishers but they said I should communicate 
with you direct for permission.

Of course, we will give you and your volume credit, and 
should you care to do so, send us one of your photographs in cowboy
outfits and we will give you quite a send off.

Our mayor, Harman Peery is known throughout the Intermountain
territory, as "The Cowboy Mayor". We could include a statement of what
he thought of your book, if you like.

The idea is, I think a Pioneer Days edition should contain
some cowboy verse, don't you? And I'd like to give you free boost, too,
because I liked your book immensely.

Sincerely,
Glen Perrins
