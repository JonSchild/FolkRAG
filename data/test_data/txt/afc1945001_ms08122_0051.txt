     This is a story of a gallant
Chicagoan fighting in Guadocanal,
keeping guard over three wounded
buddies. He held off Japanese advances
until reinforcements arrived.
Struct with malaria four times
he came out victorious, and today
he is on his way to New York
City to receive the "boxer of the year"
award which he so richly deserves.
