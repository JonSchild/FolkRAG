Mr. Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folk Song
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have already discussed informally with you and Mr. Spivack
my great desire to own copies of the records in your possession
of shanties sung by Capt. Richard Maitland. I understand that
since they were made by the WPA, it would not be legal for the
Archive to sell them for cash. I should like, therefore, to
propose to you a different method, namely, that you exchange
these records for other records of folk-songs which I own at
present or could secure, provided we can agree upon records 
the Archive wishes to possess.

I also understand that if you were to secure a duplicate set
of the records from the WPA for the purpose of bartering them
with me, it would be necessary for you as sponsor to furnish
two blanks in the place of each record.  I should therefore be
prepared to exchange with you on the general basis of two commercial
records for one of Capt. Maitland's, with any adjustments
on account of variations in size and value of the commercial
records which we might mutually agree upon.

Records which I would have immediately available for such
exchange are:

Three 10-inch double records of arrangments by R. R.
Terry of shanties, very well sung by John Goss and
chorus.  Included are Haul Away, Joe, The Drunken
Sailor, Fir Down Below, Hullabaloo Balay, Sally Brown,
Hanging Johnny, Whiskey Johnny, Sailor Likes His Bottle-O,
Clear the Track, Blow the Man Down, Tom's Gone to Hilo, 
Lowlands, and Highland Laddie.  There are two others in
this series which are being ordered for me from England.

I also have four 10-inch double records containing songs
of Old California.  Among them are two excellent
American folksongs I have never met elsewhere--
Hanging Out the Linen Clothes, and Hangtown Gals.

I have five 10-inch double records recorded from Negro
singing in Trinidad and Jamaica.   These "Calypsos"
are topical songs, mostly composed around local incidents
and personalities.   About 250 of these records
have been placed on sale, most of which are now hard
to find.
