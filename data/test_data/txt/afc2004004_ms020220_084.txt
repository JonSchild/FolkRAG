don't remember everything that she said an' did, [ya know], but I 
know I was walkin' when Mama an' them come home. They all was
talkin' then, jus' making great 'mire-rations (admirations). So
ever since then I...I jus' went on an' walked.
     An' 'cause I remember one time, Nehni (PRONOUNCED, AT LEAST,
NEE'-NIE) -- that's one, that's one a my uncles, too, but we call
him Nehni; his name Nehemiah -- an' ah... -- he's a grown man,
ya know, but we jus' call 'im flat by 'is name -- an' ah, Nehni
said to me one day -- I was sittin' on the porch -- an' I

Papa but my grandpeoples then, 'cause they always stayed [in] at the

I was little. An' so I said, "Jim an' Aa." I called Mama Aa
'cause her name [is,] is Abbey, ya know. See, that's, that's God's
name. Her name is Abbey Lou Frances. But down in the South, they
call 'er Frances. Back up home, they call 'er Abbey. Um-hum, 
see?
     An' so, I said, "Jim an' Aa's gonna tote me." I 'member
jus' as well.
