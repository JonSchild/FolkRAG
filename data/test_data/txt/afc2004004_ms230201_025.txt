The Kid:  You know they put a law in Arkansas---N o
HITCHHIKING.  An' one afternoon I were hitchhiking,
tryin' to get a ride to Little Rock an' a fella
stopped by the name of Mr. Cuff.  He was one of
the baddes' ones down through there.
Natchez:  Yeah, he really was.
The Kid:  So he say, "What you doin' hitchhikin', boy?"
 I said, "I'm tryin' to get home to work."
 Well---"[? do you work] Where do you work at?  Who
 do you work for?"(Harshly and loud)
(Slyly and soft) "I work for Mister Charley Hulen."
And [????] he said--"Come on, I'll take you there."
(They all three laugh, all three of the blues men,
chuckling as if they shared an old, old joke,
burdened with irony, but bearable out of long
acquaintance)
Any other time. . . .
Natchez:    Or if you worked for any other man. . . .
The Kid:  . . .or if I hadn' been workin', I'd-a got a whuppin'. . .
Natchez:  Yeah, that's right.
The Kid:  . . . an' went to jail.  Or went to the levee. . Or went
to the farm.
Natchez:  That's it--- went to the farm and worked for no pay.
The Kid:  Since I worked for Mister [Calley] Charley Hulen, he taken me
there. . .
Natchez:  Old Cuff was scared to bother you because you was one
of his uh-uh-uh-mens.
The Kid:  Right! But
