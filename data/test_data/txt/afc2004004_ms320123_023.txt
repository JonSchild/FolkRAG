You couldn't get in their unless you behaved very properly
too.
CANRAY
Very properly.  Just like-I remember one time that I went
dancing in Soileau.  I didn't know they had a old guy that
had some ugly ways.  And so far as I know it was a bunch of
boys, it was in the summertime.  So we went there with just
some shirts you know, pants.  They didn't let us in 'cause
we didn't have no coats.  You had to have a coat.  They had
all kinds of ways. . .I remember when my daddy and them was
playing those dances-you'd better not go in and invite a
lady for a dance unless you had a handkerchief.  They would
roll their handkerchief, it was always a white handkerchief
like this here, invite the lady.  So you wouldn't get here
dress dirty.  If you go in the summertime you better be sure
to have two handkerchiefs, 'cause the one that you want to
dance with the lady with had to be white and clean.
Otherwise they wasn't gonna dance with you.

Could you dance, you know, belly to belly, or did you have
to dance with her. . .
CANRAY
(unintelligible)  In my time it wasn't too bad but long time
ago they tell me they had to (laughter).  They used to have
their ways, them old people.
A. LOMAX
You had to ask the mother's permission for the daughter to
dance or did you?
CANRAY
No.  You could go and ask the daughter to dance if you had
your handkerchief ready, it was alright.  But as far as. . .
A. LOMAX
Did you walk the young home after the dance?
CANRAY
Sometime, if they had somebody to-they had to have an old
person with you.  Like sometime after the dance there,
