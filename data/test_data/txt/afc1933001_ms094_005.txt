Dear Mr. Lomax:
Thank you for your letter of April 8.
I note that you would agree to our printing
Mr. Kubik's setting of Stewball "for cash
payment or for a percentage of the royalties."
We suggest that a payment of $15 would be suitable
in the circumstances. If such a disposition of
the matter is agreeable to you, we shall send
you our check promptly upon receiving word from
you to that effect.
Faithfully yours,
Gustave Reese

I agreed to this. 
J. A. L.
