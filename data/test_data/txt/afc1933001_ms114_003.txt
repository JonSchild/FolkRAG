Bess Dear
Forgive my not having 
written sooner about plans etc.
The reason for delay is that
mine have gone completely through
the mixture pot, and until 
yesterday even hours ahead
were uncertain.
I'm dreadfully sorry but 
I won't be able to make
Bryn Mawr until sunday
Sept 30 and on that date
we can move into the halls.
So unfortunately I won't 
be able to room chez vous

at Low Buildings. Geo has 
gone and got sick and wants
me with him until the last
moment possible. Also
I'm involved at the 
Presbyterian Hospital myself
over cough et al. and won't
be able to finish up there
till next saturday. And
I'm taking care of some of 
P's lit affairs so events
all combine to keep me
here. I tutor vaguely with
Polly's husband in between
pleasures and pains and
god help me through the
hour of darkness amen.
