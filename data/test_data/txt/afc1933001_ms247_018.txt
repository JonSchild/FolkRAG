Dear Alan
I've got, at your 
suggestion, all the radio
crowd interested in your 
project and I'm hopeful 
of a lot of material that 
wont have to be travelled
far (will cost you nothing)
The Dallas News studio
has bought from the Library
my radio programs and 
proposes to use them this 
winter.  That ought to 
stir up some interest
Tell me when the 
records reach you
Lovingly,
Father
