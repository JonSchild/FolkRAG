[*END OF THE WORLD PREDICTED; FULFILLMENT*]

Then He said, "This world," an' it mean here, says, "Come,"
ah, that hit, that, "Comes a time that the day is gonna burn as a
oven." The whole day, ya see? Then He burn up every root an'
braNch of, of sin. Not one stone left upon another.
An' then, after the thousand years is over; then they wanna
know what is a thousand years? How long a thousand years, ah, is?
Who, who knows? The souls be burnin'. Ya see, the hell's on
fire; people'll be burnin' then. See, that thousand years. An'
then it go to say, "A thousand years may come an' go." Ya 
see? May come an' go; it didn't say it was. But, God said a
thousand years is not but a day with Him. See? So therefore,
we don't know how, soon it will be an' how, how not.
'Cause it says six months -- Ya see here? An' I learnt
everything it say here about it done come to pass.
It comin' on fast, fast. An' the horseless chariots, you know.
An' it said that was, ah, ah, that was comin'. And the, and the,
and the men would begin to thing, you, you know, would begin to 
think -- to act -- as wise as God. Tryin' to act as wise as God.

no, ain' no, ain' no chance. Ain't no chance in the world. But,
see, it's jus', just the same thing now, will, will be now, as it
was in the day of old, ya know? In Nora's (Noah's) time, too.
'Cause those men tried to build that temple, that place,
all the way to the heavens, see? They build it so high until he
change their language, on 'em, see? When they call for brick,
it would sound like "mortar." When they call for mortar, it
would sound like "bricks." Right there where He changed their
language, see? An' split up the diffrunt language, among, among
one another. An' then they left there an' went diffrunt parts,
