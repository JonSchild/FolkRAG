the birthdays my family's been having. I love you both very very xxxxx
dearly, and if I had it to do all over again I think I'd pick just the
same family I did before. Dearest love from all of us.

Dearest Family: 

Hav ng read over the opus above I rise to take my place 
at the machine. I have been in a daze of tiredness since returning from
the trip I left so many ends dangling that had to be picked up and then
spent the week end on the darn bills and the presence of Burgy in town
nearly finished me. It has been so hot for Lubbock and then I have had
to do a lot of work on the baby clinic that our Welfare League is sponsoring.
Bess has been a darling and I have absolutely decided against 
letting her go down to Dallas for the second semester. Why we have just
started in enjoying each other and the amount of work to be done on the
clothes problem for next year is outof the question. And we can't do it
until Bess loses some more (already eight pounds and such a difference)
We took in a couple of sales this month and filled in several gaps and
discovered that Bess can wear one of my dresses with alittle letting out
and that spring suit that umpty sent me this material for from the Bahamas
and that will be a large help for her. It is so much for us to
try on and consult and brag over her figure.

The trip was such fun but so very hectic that I nearly lost
