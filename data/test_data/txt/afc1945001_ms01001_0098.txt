Some types of rumors can safely be counteracted directly. 
These are the rumors which do not represent any very strong emotional 
connection for most of the people who transmit them. In this category
are preposterous items. Items which tend to strain the credulity of 
the listener, are the best material for direct counteraction. While 
there may be a temptation to feel that this type does not need counteraction,

time tend to be believed in some portions of the community. Some items 
based on belief in magic, superstitions, astrology, can be attacked 
directly. Many people half-ashamedly believe in this type of material, 
on a tentative basis. While there are those who immediately discount 
superstitions, if they recognize them, many cherish them secretly. Direct 
counteraction can expose the superstitious and magic aspects of rumors and 
put the xxx weight of community pressure and the current confidence in 
science against the rumors. Those people who reject modern objective 
approaches will continue to believe in their omens. But the large number 
of people who are "on the fence" can be affected on this front. [Some of these
rumors are relatively harmless and should be ignored, but those that seem
 to interfere with the war effort can be attacked directly.]

made clear to the public, however, that rumors will not be answered by 
providing individuals of good will with letters attesting to the facts. The 
cooperation of reference librarians should be secured and publicized to
