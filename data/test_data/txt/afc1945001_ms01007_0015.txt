Chinese Placed
Under Stilwell
U. S. Given More Power
In War; Rockwell With
MacArthur in Australia

WASHINGTON, March 19–(IP)–
Responsibility for directing the war
against Japan assumed all-American
aspects today when Lieut. Gen.
Joseph W. Stilwell was placed in
command of two Chinese armies
on the crucial north Burma battlefront.

The War Department announced
that Stilwell was appointed by
Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek
–a move viewed as a show
of Chinese confidence in American
command on a front where the outcome
of the battle affects China
most directly.

Other Major Defense Moves
Stilwell's elevation followed by
two days the designation of Gen.
Douglas MacArthur as supreme
Allied commander in the southwest
Pacific. With Maj. Gen.
George H. Brett, MacArthur's No. 1
deputy, in command of the United
Nations air forces there, the task
of bringing about the downfall of
Japan thus falls primarily on
American military leaders.

Meanwhile, the navy revealed
that MacArthur's party on the
perilous air journey from the
Philippines to Australia included
Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell
who will be assigned "an appropriate
command," probably on sea
duty. Rockwell was in charge of
naval and marine forces still fighting
in the Philippines. These forces
number about one-third of the
regular U. S. Army troops in the
Philippines, the navy said.

Corregidor Dash Indicated
The communique gave the first
official inkling that MacArthur's
party put out from Corregidor
fortress, at the entrance to Manila
Bay, rather than from Bataan
Peninsula.

An afternoon army communique,
reporting on the situation in Australia,
said that on March 17–the
day MacArthur arrived there –
army bombers raided the Japanese-held
airport at Koepang on the
Island of Timor and damaged runways
and installations.

For the moment, the heavy
fighting apparently was in Burma.

The Allied forces in Burma face
a two-fold task. They must prevent
the Japanese from cutting China's
new lifelines to India and must
thwart an enemy invasion of India
which, if successful, might be the
prelude to a junction of German-Japanese
forces.

Will Aid Coordination
Military observers said Stilwell's
appointment would clear the way
for a greater degree of coordination
among the British and Chinese.
They said he is perfectly suited to
his new role because of his long
association with the Chinese and
his close friendship with Chiang.

The Chinese generalissimo recently
made Stilwell his chief of
staff and it was presumed he would
continue in that capacity, although
the War Department communique
did not say so.

The communique said that Stilwell,
as commander of the 5th and
6th Chinese armies – 150,000 to
200,000 men–will operate "in conjunction
with the British forces in
Burma." In this he will cooperate
with British Gen. Sir Archibald
Wavell whose forces are battling
the Japs in Southern Burma. He
will not be subordinate to Wavell
whose present India-Burma command
is largely a British rather
than a United Nations one.

Depends Upon Supply Line
He will be under Chiang who, as 
Allied commander of the Southeast
Asia war theater, is charged with
the defense of Northern Burma and
its vital Burma Road. Japanese
capture of Rangoon has eliminated
that southern port of entry to the
famed road and China now depends
upon a supply line from India connecting
with the highway.

Dispensing with the usual rules
of procedure, the senate today unanimously
confirmed the nomination
of Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright,
commanding the American
forces on Bataan Peninsula,
to be a lieutenant general in the
army.

Wainwright, who succeeded General
MacArthur in command of the
Philippine forces, was thus promoted
from the rank of major general.

Chandler Asks Action
Sen. A. B. Chandler (D., Ky.),
chairman of the military affairs
subcommittee on army nominations,
placed the nomination before
the senate a few minutes after it
was received from the White
House. 

Under customary rules, a nomination
must be considered in committee
and then placed on the
executive calendar. Chandler asked
for unanimous consent that it be
considered immediately.

"Under the circumstances, I have
no objection," said Senate Republican
Leader Charles L. McNary,
of Oregon, who is usually a stickler
for formalities.

Exchange of Blows in Battle of Australia

NEW YORK, March 19–(AP)–United Nations
fliers, bombing shipping at Rabaul (1), scored a
direct hit on a Jap cruiser, following the action at
Lae and Salamaua (2) where 23 Jap ships were
sunk or damaged. Japs were reported advancing
overland from Lae toward Port Moresby, after
heavily bombing the port (3). Darwin (4) was again
bombed, as was Tulagi (5), "stepping stone" in the
Solomon group. Allied fliers bombed the Jap airdrome
at Koepang, Timor (6).

Jap Fleet Battered at Davao
Until Bombs Ran Out, Says Raider
Brett Aide, Survivor of Philippine, Java
Battles, Tells of Heroic, Against-Odds Fighting
WITH THE UNITED STATES
AIR FORCES IN AUSTRALIA,
March 19 – (INS) – Capt Frank
Kurtz, world famous Olympic diving
champion of Los Angeles, described
to me tonight how he and
a small band of American fliers
fought a virtually single-handed
Far Eastern aerial war against the
Japanese for three months.

Kurtz at present is aide-de-camp
to Lieut. Gen. George H.
Brett, deputy supreme commander
of the United Nations in the Southwest
Pacific under Gen. Douglas
MacArthur. Formerly, however, he
was liaison officer of the U. S.
air forces on Java, and took time
out to pilot his flying fortress during
the critical phases of the campaigns
in Java and the Philippines.

Member of Davao Bay Raid
Kurtz was a member of the formation
which raided Davao Bay,
on the Philippine Island of Mindanao,
in the attack described by
airmen as the most successful to
date in the Pacific war.

He told it this way:
"We flew over in a tight formation
of fortresses after having received
intelligence that a heavy
concentration of Jap warships was
based at Davao.

"That was a gross understatement.

"I have never seen so many warships
anywhere.

"We had wonderful success and
definitely sank their flagship.
Never have we had such a successful
run–it was mincemeat. We
sank at least six ships, all either
heavy cruisers or battleships, before
we ran out of bombs.

"I am confident the whole fleet
would have been sunk, if only we
had had enough planes and bombs.
We raided the enemy under the
heaviest kind of antiaircraft fire,
but we were determined to smash
them this time.

"We had previously attempted to
batter the Jap fleet with bombs
but were foiled by low-hanging
clouds which obliterated our targets."

Recalls Attack on Clark Field
Kurtz went to Manila last October
and was stationed at Clark
Field, then the army base for
heavy bombers. The first Japanese
bombing attacks on Clark Field
destroyed Kurtz' flying fortress,
and killed 12 of his highly specialized
crew. Only Kurtz and his
navigator, Eddie Oliver of Smithers,
W. Va., managed to escape.

Kurtz was sombre and grim as
he related the death of his co-pilot,
jovial, fun-loving "Tex"
Gray of San Marcos, Texas.

"I was in the operations tent
when the first Japanese formations
appeared over the mountains west
of Clark Field," he said. "Tex and
the gang were standing by the
ship, preparing for a mission over
Formosa (a Japanese island midway
between the Philippines and
Japan, proper), when the first
bombs hit."

(Editor's Note–This is the first
indication that the U. S. Air Corps
planned to carry aerial war to
Japanese territory in the early days
of the Pacific conflict.)

He continued:
"The co-pilot and crew ran from
the plane toward the shelter. Hours
later I picked them up where they
had fallen. Tex and our mechanic,
Sergt. Burgess, were leading the
others toward safety when a bomb
exploded in their path, killing all
of them instantly.

Days Like Nightmares
"The following days were like
nightmares. We were operating 24
hours a day on missions that at

[column3]

any other time would be called
impossible.

"Maj. Donald Gibbs, formerly of
March Field, Calif., our squadron
commander, took off from Clark
Field on a secret mission under
cover of darkness. We never heard
from him again.

"When bombing raids near Clark
made operations there untenable,
we shifted at night to a new
secret base. Even that was soon
knocked out by the Japs and since
we were anxious to keep our ships 
in the air–and fighting–we made
a strategic withdrawal to Darwin
for repairs and much needed rest."

Kurtz and his companions in the
Philippines have stories that make
your hair stand on end.

For example, he tells about the
time his close pal, Lieut. Boyd
"Buzz" Wagner, was sitting around
the fortress at Corregidor with a
young flight surgeon when Jap
bombers passed overhead, pausing 
to drop a few tokens of their hate.
The young flight surgeon paused
suddenly in the middle of a sentence
and fell over dead, with a
tiny piece of shrapnel through his
heart.

Even from Darwin, Kurtz and 
his fellow fliers continued to fight.
"Our orders were to hijack and

[column 4]

we carried them out," he said calmly.
"We learned quickly that
Christmas, New Year's and Sundays
meant nothing to the Japanese, so
we practiced the same technique."

Shifted to Java Battle
From Darwin, Kurtz was shifted
to Surabaya, Java, but he emerged
without a scratch. Discussing operations
there, he said:

"Our combined attacks on the
Macassar and Tarakan straits were
other grand victories for our boys.
For seemingly the first time, the 
incessant American and Dutch
bombings threw the Japanese into
complete confusion, probably upsetting
their Java invasion timetable
for weeks, and giving us more
opportunities to keep hitting them.

The air operations in the Java
area were on the widest scale in
the history of modern warfare,
Kurtz declared, with the bombers
and fighters ranging great distances
from their bases, loaded to
capacity and operating on the narrowest
margins of safety.

Kurtz departed from Java in the
last flying fortress to leave the
beleaguered island. One of his last
acts was to telephone his wife, the
former Margo Rogers of Omaha,
who is living there with her parents.

He put in the call from Surabaya
while the Japanese landing forces
were coming ashore on the beach
only a few miles from his hotel
headquarters. Just an hour before
the Japanese took over the town
he got aboard the last plane.
