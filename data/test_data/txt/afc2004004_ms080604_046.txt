A.L. :
      I wish you'd tell us some more about how Mr.
Charlie Salas and all those people carried on.  See, nobody
knows that, nobody's seen it but you.
W.B. :
     Well. .
A.L. :
     Recount it.  Just like you did before.
W.B. :
     Mr. Charlie, George Miller, Mr. Weathers. .
-what them other two men's name?
W.S. Hart:
     Blair?
W.B. :
     -Blair.
B. Gordon:
     (Benny Dean?)
W.S.H. :
     -Benny Dean.  Mr. Tate.
W.B. :
     Tate.  They had camps from Miller's bend,
that's up there back (awhile ago?) on the levee, all the way
down here when they was building this levee.  They come in
here.  Some used mules then, some had dirt wagons and tractors
pullin 'em.  Some had bulldozers, some had (road graters?),
some had scrapers --they just had different things.  One big
man was gettin over (their middle man?).
A.L. :
     But you gonna tell us how it was a free
penitentiary.  That's what you. . -you were startin to tell us
about that.
W.B. :
     Well, now that's all it was.. --well I
wouldn't say free.  I'd say a priviledged penitentiary.  When
you worked and go in, you wasn't locked up.  But, other than
that, it was just like the penitentiary.  They paid you what
they wanted, they'd give you what they wanted you to have,
if you didn't do it, somebody's gon beat you up, and it
wasn't exactly like. . -well, it was a free penitentiary
just like I said. .
