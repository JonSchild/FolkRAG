Dear Harold,
     I've been asleep ever since I got to
N. Y. - from 12 to 14 hours a night.
I've have done not a jot of work.  Tom-
morrow I'll stir about a little bit and in
the meantime you can reach me at 158
E. 26th St. (not 258).  Hold my mail.  I'll
be home Friday or Saturday unless you wire
hurry.                                    Alan.
