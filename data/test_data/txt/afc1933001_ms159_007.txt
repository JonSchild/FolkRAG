Dear Mr. Babb:

I'm sorry I couldn't answer your letter about
the "Rock Island Lines" song sooner, but radio an
archives work have kept me extremely busy. The song
you mention has never been published, and will appear
in print for the first time when Our Singing Country,
by John and Alan Lomax, [thi] published by Macmillan Co.,
60 Fifth Avenue, New York City, this autumn. The words
were recorded on a phonograph record in Arkansas by
John A. Lomax, who had a group of Negro workers sing
it for him. The record itself is now in the Archive
of American Folk Songs at the Library of Congress.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
