Mr. Leslie Waggoner,
Chairman, Board of Regents of The University of Texas,
c/o Republic National Bank
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Waggener:

Your kind and appreciated letter of the 15th inst., enclosing a copy of that most flatteringly phrased resolution of The Board of Regents provoked by my resignation as a member of the faculty of The School of Law, has called to mind a story by my father about an old timer of convivial predelictions, whom he knew in the early days in Johnson County. One evening he attended a party in the “cross-timbers” East of Cleburne. A friend met him on the street next day and, observing that he was wearing two black-eyes and a generally well battered face and skinned nose, asked him what had happened to him. Retorted the old timer: “I went to a party last night. I furnished the liquor and the neck. The fellows did the choking.” In this instance I furnished only one of the ingredients for the Regental party of July 9th. I regret I did not have the opportunity to furnish the other as I am persuaded that had I done so the Regents under its benign influence would have provided the anti-prohibitionists with a most persuasive argument for the demon, denominated “Rum” in that the real truth about the possessor of the neck would have been revealed.

Lest my attempt at levity be misunderstood, permit me to add that undeserved as I know I am to be the recipient of such an encomium as that contained in the resolution, nevertheless I must confess that I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. A fellow, if he is human, dotes upon such praise even if he merits it not. You and your collegues choked the neck of me but not in the manner of the oldtimer’s associates above mentioned. The pressure applied to my glotis was not from the fingers and fists of “the fellows” but from the emotions stirred up within me.

Sincerely yours,
[E?]
