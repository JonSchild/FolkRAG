Dear Ed,

Alan and I have checked the folk estimates
and we find that the diference of $180.00 comes
from the fact that you are comparing a preliminary
estimate with one that provides for 75 extra
disks. The original estimate was for $509.00 the final
project for $180.00 more. I don't know how you
got the impression that this was for express charges,
must have been a typographical error.

Will you order a 50 cycle roller from
U.S. Recording Co. Charge it to Revolving fund. 
it should be a 50 cycle Roller for a Model
K Presto Machine enabling it to run at 78 R.P.M.

I don't know what to do with the
dead batteries. Harold says we can't
abandon (?) them and they certainly are not
worth shipping back. What do you think? 

More soon -

Jerry
