"I was up in Waterloo last week and the guy in the garage said he could
get me all the new tires I need for $25 a piece. No need to hurry about getting
them though because there will always be bootleggers with new tires. You can even
get them still wrapped in the original paper. Course by winter you will have to
pay $35 or $50 a piece, I imagine, but you'll still be able to get them." Traveling 
business man 8-8-42.  [*Iowa 8*]
