tell Laz'rus, I'd say, "Now, you see somebody [talk to me."] talkin' to me --" 
I'd have a way of showin' 'im that I tired of talkin' to 'em.  
You know, they'd be actin' like they want to come to my house 
or co't me or sumpin' like that, I'd have an eye always give 
Laz'rus.   An' Laz'rus'd come in and call me,  "Come on, what you 
mean down here talkin'!   You come on here, le's go home!"  
I'd say, "Ah, there wa'n' nothin' to it; ain' nobody. . .jus' havin' 
fun."   Jus' act like he was sumpin' to me.   Ha, he wa'n' nothin' to 
me at all!   That was jinnik (gimmick) I had.   I didn' wanna be 
bothered with no body.                       No, I didn' 
wan' -- An' so I'd look at him and look at him.   Some mans would 
say, "I don' wan' 'er nohow; that man all sore up there."  See?  
That was fun.   Good.   Ha, ha, [it] he was a good to me, I'm tellin' ya, really 
good.
TL:          I had a deal like that up in Albany.  I had four of them 
takin' care of me.
BJ:          Yeah! [L??]  I had that one takin' care of me, I'm tellin' 
ya.    An' so, tha's the way I went through it that way.  An' I 
had a real -- I had it; I had it goin'.
             But gettin' back to Eva; I didn' know what she's up to.  
After this boy had 'rested these peoples and gone, she still hang at 
me by comin' over to see me.   So one day she come an' she say, 
"I tell you what I do," she say, "I give you fi' dollars to come 
over tonight.   Jus' to enjoy yourself.  Sos you could injoy your-
self."  An' so, I couldn't hear that 'cause I had heard too -- 
I [had] done been there a good little while then.   I didn' know 
too much about the place.   So I wouldn't promise her that.  
An' so a boy they called Big Boy, he was sick -- he was crippled -- 
an' he took care of the garbage an' things around there, ya know, 
in the place, puttin 'em, you know, away.   [An' so] Tha's all he could do; they hired him 
for that.   An' so, he come in [ther] one day an' tol' me, says, "Eva [tried] tryin' 
to get you to come [on out] to her house."  I said, "She sure is."  So he said, 
"She must be ill, 'cause she come to me an' ask me could I ask 
you to come [on out] ov' there."  Says, "An' I asked 'er why.   An' so she tol' 
me."    An' I'm tellin' you!  I said, "Why, my mind never even made up to 
[until] tell 'er I was comin'."  I said, "I'm not goin'."  An' so he said, "Well, don' go.   But if this 
person say[s] anything to you," he says, "You talk nice."
