Experiences of the AYC Puppeteers

     The AYC puppeteers are doing a pioneer job of touring rural districts,
educating the farmers about peace, jobs, security, etc., through the cultural
medium of the puppet show. These reports from the groups tell of their experiences 
and their impressions. Listen to them speak!

The Alabama Team (Negro) invaluable and unprecedented.

"The question of raising funds in Alabama is not feasable.  We 
have had collections of 45 cents and 95 cents respectively. The
farm audience which we perform to, which are the type of people
you want us to reach are too poor to eat, much less contribute 
to us. We must, therefore, have financial aid as soon as possible
and this should be immediate."

"Performed for the Epworth League at the Thurgood EME church
in Birmingham. Collection, 95 cents. Peace discussion resulted
in the minister offering his car to take a delegation to Chicago."

"We have had performances in the following places. On Sunday,
July 21, we performed at Miles Memorial College to a student body
of young rural people and teachers who teach in the rural parts
of Alabama. On Friday, July 26, we participated in the district
conference of the Methodist Church in Bessema, Ala.  where we lead
a discussion on peace and discussed the possibility of sending a
delegate to the Chicago Peace Mobilization. On Saturday, July 27,
we performed in Burgin Springs, Ala., about 50 miles from Birmingham
at the Shelby County meeting of the Farmer's Union. On Sunday,
July 28, we spoke at four churches about our show, and made arrangements
to give the show next week. On the same day, we gave a
performance at the Thurgood M. E. Church to a group of young people
who were very interested in the question of peace, and decided to 
send a delegate to the EPM."

"At the Allen Temple AME Church we got a heartening response to
our talks on peace and an interest in our show."

"Performed for Bessemer, Ala., a small industrial town for the mining
camps in the area -- 22,000 negroes, of whom 40 have the right to
vote. Invited to address the Civic league. Result - a plan to
organize the town for the EPM by a door to door campaign with peace
petitions, and to hold a mass meeting in one of the churches, all
under local auspices. They plan to use this as a base for the
formation of a local federation of the SNYC."
