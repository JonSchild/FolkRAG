Rhyme
Victory
you tool ten paces turned your finger moved
You fired first by ten seconds so he died
And all the world that he had known and loved
Died with him first to satisfy your pride
You cannot know you were not born and bred
No love hath skill and honour you allowed
A trigger to avenge you. He is dead
