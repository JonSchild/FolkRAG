News Review

At the present stage of the 
war, the Russians are losing ground 
which they had regained. It seems 
that the Germans always have their 
victories in the summer, and the 
Russians in the winter. The present 
bombing of German conquered Europe 
brings up the thought of a second 
front to releive the pressure of the 
Germans on Russia.

The war in Tunisia is becoming 
something like the war in Russia. 
General Rommel is attacking the 
British at the Maretch line while 
a few weeks ago the British were 
attacking the Germans.

In Australia Gen Mac Arthur 
expects an attack by the Japs soon.

Here in America the war has 
hit every American citizen. Shoe rationing 
canned goods, meats butter and many 
other things has stunned Americans.
