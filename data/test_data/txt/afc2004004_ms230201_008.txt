Natchez:  Yeah, that's the point.
The Kid:   The blues is a kind of revenge... You want to say somepin
                signifyin'-like---that's the blues... Uh-you know, we-all...
                we fellas had a hard time [and] in life and there was things we 
                couldn't say or do. So we sang it. 
Natchez:  Well, how do you express those things you sing?  How
                do you sing a thing like that?
The Kid:  Like a friend of mine workin' down on the railroad... A long
               time ago.  I don't remember when it was... He used to sing 
               a little number called
                       
                         (Sings) O ratty, ratty section,
                                     O ratty, ratty crew,
                                     Well, the captain's gettin' ratty, boys,
                                     You know I'm gonna rat some, too. 
   
               He couldn't speak up to the captain (or the boss)--he wasn't
               doin' anything; just layin' up an' sleepin'; but they had to 
               work---so it give him the blues and he made up [xx] a song he
               could sing. 

Natchez:  That's right.
The Kid:  I say it's signifyin' and gettin' your revenge through songs.
