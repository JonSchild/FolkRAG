Dear Dr. Spivacke,

After a very stiff, 501 mile, drive over the mountains to Cincinatti Mrs. Lomax and I found a very sloppily run and stupid hill-billy show masquerading under the title "Folk Festival". I recorded only two songs while the festival was in progress and they were hardly worth the acetate. Lunsford, as you might have expected, rather boycotted me, and, after the festival was over, dashed away with the hope that he would see me in Washington. He gave me not one scrap of information about who was folk-singer out of the huge drove of yodeling, crooning, Alabama-mooning Kentuckians he had assembled. I was able, however, in the course of the most horrible exhibition of Anglo-American, blond, blue-eyed sentimentalism and musical gaucherie that I have ever endured to single out a few genuine informants. As a result I have made four visits in the past four days which have brought to the Library 28 very good records. High spots: A very complete version of Fair Charlotte, one of McAfee's Confession, neither of which we had recorded before, both rather rare pieces of Americana; two very [ar] rare banjo pieces having to do with the Coal Mines at Coal Creek, Tenn., The Coal Creek March and the Coal Creek Pay-Day; ten fine records of the best banjo player I have met up to date, playing and singing, Child, English and American ballads and blues, the Pretty Polly being a masterpiece; a group of new Ohio fiddle tunes. Two of my informants were taken quite unaware[s] by my visits and swore that they knew many more old songs and would be able to supply them when I came back to see them. 

I am, therefore, extremely well pleased with my trip so far, from the point of view of material. [And] The prospects seem very interesting. Paul Brewster has, of course, already paved the way [fro] for me among his informants and Dr. Tho[*m*]pson has arranged for me to record the traditional hymns of the Mennonites and Amish communities of Northern Indiana, communities I had intended to visit but in which I feared it could be difficult to [find] gain [a] friendly help. Expenses have been very heavy. A dead battery, s[*e*]veral puntures and trouble with some [myster] as yet mysterious portion of the alimentary tract of the Plymouth have wasted my substance [*f*]rightfully. Will you personally see to it that my [sla] salary comes out or has come out to me muy pronto.

The express shipment of my records and so on came today. [andxxer so I can report and that everything is quite happy so far]. I do want to warn you, however, that I may be very broke by the end of ten days [or so] and may need to call for ten or so to tide me over. If you have any suggestions, make them now.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax

P.S. I have forgotten the reason for this letter, which is to ask you to have Dr. Putnam mail me a letter of introduction to whom it may concern % this address.
