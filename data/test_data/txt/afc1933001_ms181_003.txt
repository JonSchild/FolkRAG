is an authentic country variation which
I picked up here in this state a few
years ago. On its 'folk' use it followed
directly on the songs chorus.
We have other scores finished and half
finished, even an opera, but the Army has
hooked the composers and we won't do
much about them till after the War.
I'd like to get Charlie Seegers idea of
those things too. He and Ruth might
be interested in trying their own hands
at this kind of stuff. 
One of these days we'll meet
Yours
