Spain - con'td

The town without the bay would be
stuffy dirty nothing.  This is like
N. Mexico.  But the people are more
direct & friendly in an impersonal sort
of way.  I can't stand it that they're
living under Fascism.

They fish here & eat everything they
find -- all that I saw in the market
would be trash fish in America &
thrown back.
