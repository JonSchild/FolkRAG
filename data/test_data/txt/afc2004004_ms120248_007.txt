possessed by this loa he was quickly led away and brought out of his pos-
session, since Taureau, regarded by the group giving the dance as a Petro
deity, could not properly come to a rite for gods of another "company."
Or again, whereas the second list names Maît' Ossange and Maît' Batala
as Rada loa, the first list places them in the Petro group.  The Erzilie
gods are put in both categories, while Gran' Siligbo, designated in the
first list as Petro, was assigned to both "companies" by the person who
gave the third list, and named as a Rada deity by the one who gave the
second.  Furthermore, the third list, that of the singer, comprises loa
whose "names" are undoubtedly the result of the acceptance by this man of 
certain phrases from his songs as valid designations of gods, especially in the case of such names as "Aizan Marché Loko", or "Loko Kisigwé."  It
is not without interest to speculate on this as a possible mechanism by
means of which new names are added to the vodun pantheon.
          Only one of the lists specifically assigned gods to other than
the Rada and Petro categories.  One of these was termed Guinée and included
the following names of deities:

                               Kaplaou                       Congo
                               Enwizo                         Loa Sinegal
                               Wangol                        Cangaron
The other was the Ibo group, accorded two names, the Loa Mondongue, and a
loa named Ibo Iele.
                        More variable, however, than classifications of the loa are
accounts of attributes and interrelationships, and details of their worship.
Yet certain traits and functions of the gods and aspects of their ritual can
be set forth.  One way in which the Haitians determine such matters is by
reference to the songs sung in honor of the gods.  Again and again the texts
of such songs were cited as authority, suggesting that they are the "holy word"
