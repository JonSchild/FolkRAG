a statement of the balance of his expenses
for transportation and for 
hall rental after deducting receipts 
at the door, and that I would recommend

g. I receive the enclosed letter and 
statement from Mrs. Wilson.  Very likely 
Mr. Wilson reported inaccurately what 
I said to him and both seem 
to have forgotten the charges 
at the door.
h.  I have today written an entirely 
non-committal letter to Mrs. Wilson,
reporting what I said to Mr. Wilson 
(except for the door charge).  When I 
talked to Mr. Wilson I estimated the 
total charge on the Library (if allowed_
would be around Fifteen Dollars.
