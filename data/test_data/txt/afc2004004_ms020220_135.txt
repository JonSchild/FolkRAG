     An' so, I ra, ah, the next morning after the storm was over with,
we all got up an' I looked -- I paid attention. That house was
just as straight as it could be! It came to the back, ya know,
jus' stood it right up. The do' closed good. And the jise was
back up there. I guess the Lawd jus' straightened that up!
It ain't none of them paid that no mind. But that was a beautiful
thing to me...But I didn't try to drive that car no more!
     So we went on then. We stayed on there [un]till we finished
the work an' everything. An' we come back to th' mainland, which
was the Miami side, goin' on back to the Lake. I went to the
Lake after that. An' ah, I told 'em about it, ya know, about
three months later. An' that tickled me so bad! An', an', an'
my husban', he said, "I know sumpin's wrong with that car wheel."
     I said, "See," I'm away this time (?), ya see, jus' knowin'
it, you see. I said, "See, if I'd a-told him then, he'd a-'clared
there's sumpin' was wrong with the car, you see. He never did
notice that [the] house was almost down, an' anything else! But
that was funny. We had us a whole bunch, just me an' one (?).
     An' so, anyway, when the storm did come, the house was straightened.
[When] One day I went down to Kagsamon to mail some letters an' on my
way back I -- I always liked to sing an' whoop, ya know, comin'
through the woods an' on the roadside. An' I was comin' [on] there,
jes' a singin', An' so, ah, there's a car behind me, an' so.
An' ah, I wanted to cross that lil' drain, lil' thick place,
before [the pass] he pass me. But I hurried up, 'cause I didn't know who
was in it, ya know? Strange place, too. An' I did; I hurried
on acrost it. An' when I crossed it ah, this car come up an' 
hit was the man that owned the place, you know, where we wa'
workin', Mr. Wiliams. So he asked me if I wanted a ride.
