My dear Miss Miles:

I plan now to drive through Birmingham enroute to Livingston
to make records of the singing of Mrs. Tartt's group. If you
can join me on that trip, so much the better. "Miss Terrell" is
still travelling with me. Give my special regards to Mr. Clark
and tell him that I am planning to come by and make records of
the singing of his sister in Mullins,

Yours sincerely,

Honorary Consultant and Curator
