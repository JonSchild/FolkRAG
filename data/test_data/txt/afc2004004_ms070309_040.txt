Songs - Jubilees
Some long meters.
They would sing the long meters as well
as they do today, even though they did
not read music. [Even though] They had
no priviledge to learn, but like myself
picked it up and sought it myself.
"I never heard an odd word in my life -
[my] the widow woman who reared me
[never] was a pure woman."
The catch in the breath is a recent
thing. The old fashioned minister wouldn't
do that. They would swing out in the 
scriptures & go out of themselves.
 The body can be used as a trumpet by
the spirit, Mild, meek, humble and 
obedient spirit is better than a 
rowdy mind. "I saw one man one 
time - the spirit taken him in such
a course - until the [spirits] officials
had to sit him down - look like he gonna die."
I have seen Them fall out."
Shouting - patting their hands
- walking the aisles
- jumping lightly up and down
