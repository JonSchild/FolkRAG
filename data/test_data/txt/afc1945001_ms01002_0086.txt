9. Having been officially designated as a Rumor Clinic, the head of the Clinic may proceed to announce the fact to the press and to publicize the work of the Clinic to the public within a reasonable area in the vicinity of the institution. (This publicity should be designed to attract to the Clinic brief reports from citizens on rumors which they think are significant. These reports, via mail, telephone and personal visitation, constitute the grist for the Clinic's mill. It should be made clear in the publicity that the Rumor Clinic is engaged in making analyses of rumors on a sampling basis, not attempting to answer all rumors.)

10. The Rumor Clinic should designate a small group to set as an "intake committee" to go over the letters and reports with the object of bringing to the weekly conference the sampling of rumors constituting the most significant and most widely circulated ones. The report from the "intake committee" would provide the basis for the meeting's discussion.

11. The weekly meeting would divide the selected rumors into two main classifications: 

(a) The rumors to be reported to Washington, and
(b) The rumors which can be handled by the Clinic locally in terms of available data and information.

12. A weekly report following the form attached containing not more than 10 annotated rumors shall be sent by the head of the Rumor Clinic to the Rumor Clinic Section of the U. S. Office of Education. D. C.
