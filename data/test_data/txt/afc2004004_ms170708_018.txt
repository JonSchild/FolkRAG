Come rowing by the tide,
There she beheld a bold fish-a-man
Come rowing by the tide.

"Morning to you, bold fish-a-man,
How come you fishing here?"
"I came a-fishing for your sweet sake
All on this river clear.
All on this river clear.
I came a-fishing for your sweet sake,
All on this river clear."

He lashed his boat up to the stem,
And to the lady want;
He took her by the milk-white hand,
For it was his intent.
For it was his intent;
He took her by the milk-white hand,
For it was his intent.

Then he pulled off his morning gown
An' gently laid it down.
There she beheld three chains of gold,
Hang dangling three times round.
Hang dangling three times round,
There she beheld three chains of gold,
Hang dangling three times round.
