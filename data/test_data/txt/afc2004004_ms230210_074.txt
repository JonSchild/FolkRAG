Vieux Fort...interview with old man Vic Vitalis Victor. 

Summary [o]: I am not from Africa, but [he] I know[s] [he's] I'm an Africa.  These
songs were taught me by my father and mother. (how does he feel
when he hears a drum) It moves me deeply.  It makes me want to
dance.  I remember my father and mother and sometimes I weep.
(who taught him the meaning of the words of katumba) My father.

tells his story back to him now -- and the old man confirms it...

the same thing.  Guinee is some one who comew from Africa, when we
live here they call us Congo. ... [He avoids the question about ]
Even if the songs are sung by non-Africans, it has no significance.
(There probably are certain secret rites at Vieux Fort Katumbas --

times in these wakes) (Do your children take an interest) Yo
desole (they're crazy about it. When they hear the drums, they
are overwhelmed.
