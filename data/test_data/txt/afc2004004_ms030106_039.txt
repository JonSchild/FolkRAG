In New Orleans, why, we'd [would] often wonder [then enter] where a dead 
person was located. At any time we had somebody that was
dead we know we had plenty good food [with] that night, plenty ham
sandwiches, cheese sandwiches, with mustard slapped all over 
the bread [place]. Those days I belonged to a quartet, and, of course,
we specialized in spirituals for the purpose of finding 
somebody that was dead, and we could sing um [them], too, I'm telling
you. The minute we'd [would] walk in, of course we'd have our
correct invitation and we'd be right to the kitchen where
all the food was. Of course, the dead man or the dead woman
would always be laid out in the front, and they'd [would] be by
themselves most of the time - they was dead and there was no 
other reason to be where there was living people. Well, I
guess one of those spirituals--I guess would kind of sound
good, let me see. (Piano)
[*Fade*]Steal away, steal away,
Steal away home to Jesus.
Steal away, steal away, steal away,
Steal away home to our Lawd.
One of our favorite numbers was this one:
Near my God to Thee,
Nearer to Thee,
And when my heart will be
Nearer to Thee--
Question: But you would be thinking about that ham, wouldn't 
you?
Morton: I'd thinking about that ham.
Oh, nearer my God to thee,
(We'd [They] would be sad too, terribly sad.)
