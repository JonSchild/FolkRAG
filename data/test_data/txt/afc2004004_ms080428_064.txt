A  This man Nimrod Workman, ah, has a memory that
goes back ah to the dawn of British time.  He
spent 45 years ah in the coalmines.  He was
one of the people that brought the union into
the mountains, but yet he knows ballads that
come from the beginning of the Middle Ages.
One of them is a story of what he calls
Bangham and the boar.  Originally it was Sir,
Sir Lionel.  Sir Lionel rode, rode out, he
heard a woman screaming, he rescued her from
a wild boar, and, and ah then the giant
appeared and he had a battle with the giant
and finally defeated him.  That's the origin
of the story.  But, ah, like many American
balladeers, Nimrod had reduced it to a simple
pungent incident.

Q  And he's taught it to his daughters.

A   And he's taught it to his daughter, Phyllis,
who um sings it for us, while Nimrod listens.

And then they - to them it's very vivid
because, ah wild boar hunting still goes on,
they know the wild boar is about the most
dangerous animal in the woods, and even the
old ah wild hogs are pretty dangerous if you
have them cornered.
