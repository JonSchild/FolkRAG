immigrants have come, or by the communities themselves.
In my previous memorandum to you, I included a
list of statistics on the foreign groups to be found
in the city of New York and I will assume that you have them
in mind in the course of this discussion. But besides these,
the following groups in other parts of America can be called
upon for colorful folk materials:

The Basque shepherds of Montana;
The Pennsylvania Dutch;
The Finnish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Swedish
          and Danish groups of the lake states;
Franco-Americans from Vincennes, French
          Canada, southwestern Louisiana, Southwestern
          Missouri;
The Scotch-Gaelic group from Cape Breton
          Island, Canada;
Bahaman Negroes from Florida:
Slavic groups from Pennsylvania and the
          Middle West;
A ban of singers from the Virgin Islands
          and another from Hawaii.

Naturally the native folk groups would occupy the
foremost place in the programs of the American Folk Theater
and I have emphasized the exotic and sophisticated
portions of the program only because they had not been
mentioned hitherto. I should like to repeat that this
theater can function either along side of the concessions
and street performances suggested above or help to take
their place in case the Fair decides against them.
