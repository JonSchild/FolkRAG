Dear Mr. Spivake:

I never intended for
the messenger to ship the records
to Mr. Green without specific
instructions and permission from
either you or Mr. Waters.
I told him about wrapping
them, about listing them carefully
before wrapping, etc.,
but I did not dream that
he would ship them without
having permission. But
the fault is entirely mine
and no blame whatsoever for
the messengrs. I should be
able to talk plainly
