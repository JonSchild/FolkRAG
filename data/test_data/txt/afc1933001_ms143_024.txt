Mr. Alan Lomax
124 West 12th Street
New York City

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was pleased to receive your note
promising news in the future and,
having long heard of Bridgeport in connection
with phonograph records, I suspect that it
will be good news.

Have you any marked catalogs or other
bibliographies you can send me for formal
recommendations? The first shipment of the 
Columbia sets is almost complete and I should 
like to begin to plan a further campaign along
the lines we discussed.

Sincerely yours,
*signed: Harold*
