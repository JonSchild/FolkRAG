"ELEANOR CLUB" RUMORS STIR RICHMOND, VA.

Governor Denies Servant Group Is Involved In "Evacuation" Plot

RICHMOND, Va. - (ANP)
Declaring that Negro leaders with whom he has worked have been "loyal and patriotic citizens," Governor Darden said last week he has received no authentic reports of the prevalence of "Eleanor clubs" rumored to be flourishing in Virginia and other parts of the south.
The Eleanor clubs, named for the President's wife, have as their objective, it is reported, a "wholesale evacuation from southern kitchens of Negro servants."
Also commenting on the situation, the Richmond Times - Dispatch said: "It isn't true; at least there hasn't been a word of truth in the report of organization of such clubs in southern cities in which government agents have conducted their investigation."
Governor Darden declared he had read editorials in Norfolk papers and Richmond papers and a statement on the situation made by City Manager Charles B. Borland, of Norfolk, and said he could not imagine anything more unfortunate at this time than a move designed to divide the races.  The governor further stated:
"Subversive activities must be watched wherever they appear.  However, it is a mistake to assume that these activities have any special relationship to either color or race."
Norfolk was jittery before Tuesday's blackout, City Manager Borland disclosed.  After it happened and nothing occurred, however, he said, authoritative sources began to place blame for unsettled racial conditions on rumors and propaganda.
