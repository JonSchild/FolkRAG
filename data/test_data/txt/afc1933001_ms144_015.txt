Mr. Alan lomax
124 West 12th Street
New York City

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I heartily approve of the purchase of the Paramount records. Will you please ask Bloomfields to send me a simple statement offering "225 Paramount disks selected by Mr. Alan Lomax at (15Â¢) fifteen cents each". I think that with this bill I can get the order sent up immediately.

As you probably know by now, I worked out a formula with Mr. Wolfert which met with the Librarian's approval. I also asked him how many franked labels I should send him for his gift to the Library.

Will you please let me know who owns the Vocalion and Decca Recording Companies. Are they subsidiaries of the American Recording Company?

Your plans for this summer are wonderful but for the life of me I don't see how you can possibly do all that in less than a year. You seem to forget, if you see Miss Flanders, you must do so before July and still you suggest going to Michigan at almost the same time. When do you expect to work on the new edition of the book? Personally, I shall be very satisfied if you succeed in completing a good New England trip this summer.

You can come to Washington at any time convenient, but please let me know well in advance so that I may be sure to be in town.

Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music

P.S. I shall hand your voucher to Voorus but I somehow doubt that your "unspecified" taxi rides will be paid. Your per diem is supposed to take care of that.

P.P.S. Needless to say, your list of the numbers of the Paramount records was not enclosed. Therefore, fearing that they are lost I suggest the other procedure for obtaining them.

+Please ask Hammond or Wise. In the case of independent companies, send me the names & addresses of the presidents.
