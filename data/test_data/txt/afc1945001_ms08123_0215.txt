The other day a letter came
in from my cousin Frank , who in in
the army at Fort Jackson. He told
me in his letter how his friends
treated him when he first came.
He said that they woud put a
bucket of water over the door and
when he walked in, the water would
come down on his head. Then he
told me how he would get in
bed and big nails would be in
his bed. He said that he would make
so much noise that sergant would
hear him and put him in the
guard house peeling potatos.
