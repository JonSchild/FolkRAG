(Were there other children living on the farm near you?)
Yes...Some. (He drowses off again)
(I believe you're too sleepy, Reverend Davis?)
Uh-uh! How could I be sleep, setting up heah smokin!

(He stood on the corner of 138th and Lennox all night 
the night before, singing, playing his guitar, and taking up money
in his tin cup, pinned to his overcoat.  H e tells me that he
never sleeps at anyone else's house -- he doesn't trust anyone
that much.  He will sleep sitting up in a chair, however, although
he never admits that he has been asleep, I've sat and watched
him snore away by the half hour.  I have the impression that this
habi t of cat-napping in chairs -- and he prefers a straight
chair to an easy chair -- is the result of his mistrustfulness,
and his nocturnal habits.)  (H e slept quite some time at this
point, and then woke up)
What is you doin now?
(I'm just sitting here wondering, and wishing I knew
more about you.)
I try to give you anything there is about me.  I try to
give you everythang about me.  You don't seem to think I is.
You don't seem to think I is.
(I know you are, but I think yo u have certain 
reserves -- like everybody.)
Certain reserves...?  (h e laughs'
(You know that you have.)
A-a-a-a-a-a..... Miss Lizybeth, you is a terrible
woman.
