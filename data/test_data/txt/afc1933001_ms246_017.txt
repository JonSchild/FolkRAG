Dear Father:

It's fine to know that your trip to southern Texas was such a success, even though you weren't able to get hold of "Explosion" !  The Brown Bowen tune, if the story is as well recorded as I heard it is in San Antonio, would make a whole radio program by itself, and the Mexican material is just what we need.  I think the best thing you could possibly do would be to go to New Mexico with Peter Hurd.  You might be interested to know that we have held off our work in New Mexico for a long time because Arthur Campa, Professor of Folk Music at the University of New Mexico, has had a Rockefeller grant to do work in that state.  So far, however, having received some funds he has produced zero results and [??see] no reason why we should delay further our explorations, in that central territory.

I have two additional suggestions: (a) that you get as much cowboy stuff as possible.  Ask Dobie again for contacts in the region, and make as many records of cowboy talk as you feel are important.  Our mutual friend Bill Kittrell knows of two r three cowboy singers who he says are very good,  I will also send you the names of some of Woddy's relative in the Panhandle area whom you can look up.  (b) It would be worth your while, I think, to get acquainted with a few of the radio performers who work in Dallas and to get from them their versions of American folk song.  In the past couple of years I have found some of these people to be extremely good source for American folk songs.  They very seldom sing them on the air, because they are felt to be not commercial, but oftentimes they know good tunes if you will give them a chance to remind themselves of same.  One of the best square dance callers I ever heard in my life was the other night over some Dallas radio station.  The simplest thing to so is to call on the program managers of the stations in Dallas and [F??t] Worth and ask them for a list of their local people.  

Jerry will forward you your records today and I have just recieved news from the Librarian's office that another $ 150 has been approved for your further work, bringing the total now to $300 in all.  If you foresee that you will need more money I will see what can be done about that.
