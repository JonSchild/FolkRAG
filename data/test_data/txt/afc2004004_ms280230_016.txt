Wi' My Rovin' Eye.
1) For as I gae'd doon by Aldergate I met a bonny wee lass,
For she winked to me wi' the tail of her e'e as I went walkin' past.

Refrain:
Wi' my rovin' eye,
Fol-a-doo-a-di,
My rovin' di-dum-derry,
Wi' my rovin' eye.

2) She took me to her sittin' room a wee bit doon the town,
It was there we brought a bootle cot and then we both sat doon.
(Ref.)

3) She took me to anither hoose, a wee bit doon the burn,
It's true what Robbie Burns said, "A man was made to mourn."
(Ref.)

4) I'll gae home to Achternachty, contented for to be,
For the losing of my five pound note with the lassie in Dundee.
(Ref.)
