HEAVY HIPTED WOMAN (TAMPING SONG)

Wasn't that enough, boy?
Run a monkey man blind.
See a heavy hipted Woman,
Jes reel and a rocker behind.
Oh, look how she walk, boy.
So big and fine.
Oh, look how she walk, boy.
ay she kneel and she rock-a behind.

Oh, wasn't that enogugh , boy?
Run a monkey man blind.
See a heavy hipted woman
Jes reel and a rock heuh behind.
Look how she walk, boy.
Way she hold her beaten mine.
She's a heavy hipted woman.
