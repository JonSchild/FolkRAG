#2 Mr. Lomax

turntable difficulty straightened out you may not have any trouble with the 
pickup head.

Sometime I wish you would send just the amplifier into me so that I can go 
over it. This service will not cost you anything but I will ask you to pay 
the shipping charges.

I hear that your book is out and that it is very interesting. I must obtain 
a copy as I know I will enjoy reading it.

I just had an outfit come back that had been nine months on the West African 
coast, all the way from the Sahara Desert down to Angola. It was in freezing 
temperatures and at times the humidity must have been terrific as most of the 
parts are encrusted with rust. They brought back what I believe is the 
finest collection of records I have ever heard. They have from three to four 
hundred records, and every one I heard was perfect. They have records of 
music that has never been heard before. I have the instrument and I have 
made several perfect records with out a single adjustment, being made. I 
admit that this is not exactly the same instrument I built for you, but yours 
you will remember is the first of what we call the protable, mordern battery 
powered outfit.

I saw Mr. Engel the other day and he told me he had given up his active 
contact with the L.C., and that a Mr. Oliver Strunk has succeeded him. You 
know doubt have heardof this before this time.

Very truly yours,
W.C. Garwick
