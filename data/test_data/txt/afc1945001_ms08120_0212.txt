If I had a dime I'll tell you
what I do, I will go to the store
and buy some stamps to.

If you want to win this war
you got to buy some bonds, because
winning this war its not any fun.

People kicking about this
war, but they still sit at home
with their legs cross.  If they get
a job in a war plant and do their
best, I know Uncle Sam will do
the rest.
