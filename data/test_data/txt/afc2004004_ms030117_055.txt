Thass truth.
     Lots of us, heap of times, is aftah the thang that
we want mo than the thang that we need.  Lots of times a woman gits
holt of a good man, she don't know how to treat that man.  She

Treat him nice fur what he have in a way.  I mean he couldn't tell
whether she love him or no.  Then when she git one that she do keer
somethin bout, then you might see by how she keep hersef closer wi d
