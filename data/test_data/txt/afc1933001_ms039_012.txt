Washington, D.C.

My dear Professor Lomax:

I have been in conversation with Mr. Bell who is in charge of our Kentucky Writers' Project and he tells me of your interest in Kentucky folk lore and that you anticipate being in the state next month to do some recording.  I am very interested in this matter and would like to get in on the recording of speech in this state.  The University has allowed me funds to purchase recording machinery and I had anticipated getting to work at it shortly.  I should like to interview you about the matter, if you please, among other things the best machine to get.  I wonder if you will be in Washington around January first.  I am coming up from Richmond after the sessions of the Modern Language Association and should like to have a few minutes with you.

Yours sincerely, 
L. L. Dantzler
Head of the Department of English
