Mr. Alan Lomax
Library of Congress, Archive of American Folk Songs
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was extremely sorry that when I was in Washington
that we were both so busy that our free times didn't
click. I got tied up in a conference the day after
I talked with you and couldn't even get out to telephone
you. When next I called you were not there.

Our last issue for the publishing year which we have
called "America Discovers Its Songs" is going to roll
off the press in a day or two. I will see that you
get a copy at once. We have certainly had our difficulties
finding a problem and were not particularly
successful, as you will gather. The issue was lots
of fun for us to do and I think will have some value
to the schools. I will be interested to get your
reaction to it, however.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely yours,
Frances M. Foster

Columbia Broadcasting System Teacher's Manual you were
good enough to let me have. Thanks.
