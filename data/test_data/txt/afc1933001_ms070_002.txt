Miss Mary Flescher
1609 Campbell Street
Commerce, Texas

Dear Miss Flescher:

It fails to me to answer the inquiry you
addressed to Dr. Spivacke on April 18. Since
you have already spoken to Dr. John A. Lomax,
the help we can offer is considerably learned,
for we should have referred you to his immediately.
The cultural insight and bibliographical assistance
to be found in his books are very valuable,
particularly in respect to Texas and vicinity.

Listed below are several titles which, in a
general way, may prove useful to you. We cannot
loan them to you, unfortunately, but perhaps you
can get access to them elsewhere.

Let me assure you that if you ask specific
questions, we shall be glad to render any service
possible.

Sincerely yours,
Edward N. Waters
Assistant Chief,
Division of Music
