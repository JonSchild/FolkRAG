Dear Richard:

We are including one of Horton Barker's songs --
to wit, "The Farmer's Curst Wife" -- in an album of 
records intended for distribution to all the Latin 
American Republics.  In introducing his ballad, I 
wish to give a very brief note about his life and 
wish to impose on you to the extent of obtaining a 
few sentences about him from you.  Would you be so 
kind as to write me a brief note about him and in it 
tell me how long he has been blind, whether or not 
he is living as a ballad singer, just how famous a 
singer he is among his own people, etc.

Thanking you for your kindness, I am
Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
