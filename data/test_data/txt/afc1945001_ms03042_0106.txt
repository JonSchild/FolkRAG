        New York, N.Y.                                                       August 15, 1942

FROM:  Edward V. Needham, Manager
              Albany, New York

SUBJECT:  Survey of Rummors

     Following is a list of rumors which seem to be prevalent in this area:

1. Gasoline rationing not needed because of lack of gasoline supplies or transportation facilities, but has been put into effect at the request of the F.B.I. to facilitate their counter-espionage work, inasmuch as F.B.I. has difficulty in following movements of saboteurs who make use of automobiles in their movements about the east.

2. Did you know that originally there were 9 saboteurs, but the reason no one hears about the 9th one is because actually, he was an American Spy who went to Germany and attended a saboteur school, and in this way, was able to come with the real saboteurs to the United States; that is how the F.B.I. knew about the whole plot.

3. Someone told me (unwilling to disclose source of information) that they have a school in Germany where they train their spies how to act like refugees in order to enter the United States.

4. The only people who will be able to get fuel oil this winter are those who have small children.
