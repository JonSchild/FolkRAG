Tape:  31  R. Hicks

there is my firewood           (blank)
come right on down then and we'll go right on down to the house and you'll
be welcome in.

AL:    Show us the spring house. . .

RH:    OK.  And right here now is like as a sayin' is, is the blueberries.
They done gone, this is a, this is in September, I believe the eighth today,
and they done gone; a few yit, the birds eats 'em.  And that's the wild
blueberry that they dry.   (Pause)   Just come right on down.  That thar now
is the, [is the,] is the what we call the cellar:  the cellar which you keep
your food in like a chipmunk for these big snows don't you . . . 

(Could you shows us that again, Ray?)

RH:    Huh?

(Show us that again right there.)
. . .

RH:    That's the cellar now.  Now back a few year ago we had to bury
our food in the ice.  We call 'em . . .                    And so one feller asked me,
he says, "Ray, how do you git through them snows?"  I says, "I keep my
food binned up like a chipmunk."  And if you don't, you. . .
And I've see'd a few chipmunks starve and froze to death and mice and
rats.  And     that's the cellar now that come on and was built from the old
wood.   Now the old wood was built out of dried sawdust and sealed, and a 
apple in that, until you eat it, had a flavor, cured it, mellered in that
sawdust.  They call 'em  a cellar             there for a while then up
in my time they got to smokin' my grandfather's woods got to smokin'
his pork meat   in it, and they called 'em from then on a smokehouse with
white hickory wood to give it that hickory flavor.

AL:    Now show us the spring house.
