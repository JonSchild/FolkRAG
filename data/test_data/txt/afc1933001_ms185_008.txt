Dear Alan: 

Late last week I received a letter 
from Miss Thelma Simes, Music Department, 
Logansport City Schools, Logansport, 
Indiana. As I told you when I wrote 
you two weeks or so ago, Miss Simes is 
extremely anxious for you to talk on a 
program the Indiana Schools are preparing 
for October 22. I asked you in that 
letter to get in touch with Miss Simes 
yourself. 

She now complains that she has not 
heard from you, and that her program must 
be completed by September 1. She is still 
anxious to have you talk, and wants to 
know what your total fee will be. 

I am telling Miss Simes that we shall 
urge you once more to write her, but 
please do so promptly so that she will 
know the Library has kept its word about
notifying you. 
Sincerely yours, 

Edward Waters, Assistant Chief 
Division of Music
