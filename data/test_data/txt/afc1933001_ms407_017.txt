[lovely] beautifully, They were attentive and most respectful.
I thought I saw one of guinea pigs twist his face into a 
smile, but perhaps I was mistaken.  As for the two gold 
fish in a big glass bowl, I fear for them.  They were deep 
down under when Father Silva sprinkled the bowl.  One brown 
wrinkled old lady near the end of the procession suddenly 
drew [produced] an egg from her bosom and held it out for baptism. Father Silva 
looked a bit surprised, though he quickly recovered and 
blessed it adding the due quota of holy water. 

The last animal was sprinkled and the ceremony ended 
abruptly.  No proper benediction or song followed.  The crowd 
drifted away. 

"I could not catch the Spanish words of your blessing," 
I said afterwards to Father Silva.  "I saw you glance at your 
ritual.  Does the Church officially recognize this custom?" 
"Oh, yes," he answered.  "And the words I repeated 
are a prayer to the Lord to bless each animal to the end 
that it may fulfill the purpose for which it was created." 
"I understand," said I. "the hens should lay more 
eggs; the canaries sing more sweetly; the goats be more 
tractable to their drivers; the concerts of the tom-cats 
on the back fence not so long drawn out; the roosters, -" 
But Father Silva raised his hand, smiled a friendly [smile] protest 
and walked away.
