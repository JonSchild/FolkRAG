the nail on the head better than you could think, and this
"Meal and Ale" happened here, and this chap, Meldrum, he was
left Craigie's and went to             and I always -                       's
the farm down here.....(cough) ..... and [I met him at the end
of that road.] [The first thing I did at the farm was to...
was to begin and pay my accounts. I usually went up to the 
shop and paid them there first.....I was going out the end of
that road, and this lad was away from me, this Meldrum, now, 
you know.] He was still fearful on for this girl, but he
never made anything of her[, and I met him at the end of the
road, and] [s]She was staying again with me...you know what I
mean by staying...she wasn't going away from me...then she
wasn't going away from me...you'd fee a girl every half year
at that time, and fee your single men every half year, and
your married men every whole year.....I met him [in] and law and
I was kind of pleased to see him, and he just immediately
began about this girl. He knew that she was staying again
and, Lord, "If I you see would put in a word for [her] him, and what I could 
maybe help him a wee bit", and Lord, he says to me, he says,
"I even got drunk at the farms, usually onywey I've never
tasted onything", - you see he meant that I could tell her
that...and it was, oh, purely that he was on for this quean
that he was keeping so square, d'you see, and if I could only
put in a word for him, [and I stet said to him,] "Lord, Jamie, - 
Jamie was his name, you see - Listen, Jamie, there isn't 
nothing I wouldn't like better." "Man", I said, " I would
fairly dae the courting for you, but I dinna think it would
help you muckle...[..but, Lord, see here, I wish to peace
I could dae the work for you...I would fairly manage, [seein'] sin -
do you see]...

[Well, our usual...this was at the twenty-eighth of May,
and then] our "Meal and Ale" came on, maybe at the beginning
