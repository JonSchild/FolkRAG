-7-  Rumors, 8-9 to 8-15  New York  8-18-42

     Jamaica 8-9 (Delicatessen owner):  "Henderson is a rich Jew,
plotting to put all honest men out of business so his brothers can take
over."

Materials and Salvage
     New York 8-13 (Women's club leader):  "There is entirely too
mush scheming to give junk dealers big profits from salvage.  If half of
the effort that goes into helping such men make tremendous profits were
put into direct salvage action, there wouldn't be any shortages of scrap
steel or iron or rubber."
     New York 8-14:  "Save your hands and stop cutting up tin cans
for this so-called 'salvage campaign'.  All the cans are just used to
make cheap bottle tops for beer bottles and soft drinks."
     Brooklyn 8-13:  "I hear the big mail order houses have tons
of rubber tires in warehouses and can't sell them to anyone.  The Government
doesn't really want to buy such stuff."
     New York 8-11 (Small manufacturer, metal novelties):  "So we have
supplies of light steel, tin plate and others.  Lots of us have piles and
we can't sell, and we can't use.  What good is the stuff going to do anybody
lying around in piles?  I offered the WPB - they don't want it."
     New York 8-15 (Businessman):  "Confidentially, I hear there are
really over one million unemployed in the City of New York today on account
of material shortages and lack of contracts.  The Government is full of
men who hate New York and they are working together to keep materials out
of New York as much as they can."
     New York 8-13:  "The steel shortage could be ended tomorrow if
the steel companies would put all their mills to work.  They are holding out
for bigger profits."
