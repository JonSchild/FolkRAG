it up with, you know the stuff.  While he was gone, I ruck up leaves
and (unint. . .there is. . .around here). . . and dad couldn't see too good
(unint.) and I set it fire.  And when it come up and the barn stuff(??)
got around their nose and all round there, they just jumped up and
took off and run away with the sled and went into John Moss's mill
dam. . .you know, where the water's at, to cool down, like flies were
biting them.  It was hard times, you know, that's the way you had to
live, and growed up that way.

AL:  Stanley, why don't you ask Ray wheter it's as easy for him to
gather herbs as it used to be. . .
Stan:  You used to get the herbs pretty easily didn't you back then there?
Ray:  Well, yeah, it was a whole lot easier, then another thing, it was
more land to get it off of.  And now, it's gettin' about over, if you
don't cultivate it, raise it.  The people had to have a place to
stay, and it was either herbs to go, or people, or animals.
St:  Now these days and times, see you've come in and bought the land away
and got it posted and all, and you can't even break a twig off, you
can't do anything like that, if you do, the law (unintelligible). . .
AL:  What's happened to the beech?
Ray:  Well, the beech, that's were I use to go to gather so many herbs.
We all did, that's what saved us in the depression, 1929 and up in
the 30s and on up in the 40s. . .was the wild cherry bark, that sold
so much of it.  And ginseng, and other herbs. . .white hall(??), , that's
what I started when I was a little boy, got a scar here on my kneww
where I cut it with my pocket knife.  That's what I started on.  My
dad took me back there, and my sister, and learnt me to cut.
