Dear Dr. Keppel:
With reference to the grant for the promotion
of our Archive of American Folk Song, Dr. Lomax is starting
on his field work and should have an immediate remittance
of the first quarterly instalment of the $3,000 granted.
If feasible, we should be glad to receive the remittance of
at least that sum; or more conveniently, if practicable, the
entire sum, to avoid the necessity of repeated requisitions.
Faithfully yours,

Librarian

Dr. Frederick P. Keppel President
