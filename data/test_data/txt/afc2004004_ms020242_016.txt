Mamie?  I went by that day, walked -- they didn't even know I
was there. See, that car come in down there sometime, but they

Hum-um. It might do good, but it wouldn't do good for a Christian, 
I know, wouldn't hurt them. It might drive a sinner. See? But
it wouldn't do no good for no Christian person, 'cause they would

     But I, I don't think there's no need a tryin' a drive 'em

come overhead an' talk to ya, he come anyhow. That's way that is. 
I'd rather for one jus' to speak plain to me than to try to scare
me. I know that's what I t-- do anytime, when anything be, go to 
feelin' funny around. Just sit down there an' say, "Now, you 
tryin' to scare me 'cause you know I ain't, I ain't no spirit
yet. I'm in the flesh an' I cain't stand ya." I talk to 'em
