REFRAIN:
Goodbye, everybody,
Goodbye, sing hallelujah.
Goodbye, everybody, (REFRAIN)

Goin' away to leave, I'm sorry to tell you, (REFRAIN)
Goin' away to leave, you can't go with me, (REFRAIN)

Goodbye, all you people (REFRAIN)
Goodbye, all you people, (REFRAIN)

Jesus sittin' at the sacrament table, (REFRAIN)
Passin' the bread and the wine to the members, (REFRAIN)

Goodbye, everybody, (REFRAIN)
Goodbye, everybody, (REFRAIN)

Goin' away to leave you, I'm sorry to tell you, (REFRAIN)
Goin' away to leave, you can't go with me, (REFRAIN)

Goodbye, all you sinners, (REFRAIN)
Goodbye, all you sinners, (REFRAIN)
