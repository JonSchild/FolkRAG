Rumor Project No. 2

This project outline seems to me excellent and in good
enough shape to put to the field immediately. I suggest that you
bring it up at the staff meeting on Monday and that we have
Webber put it to the BPI field people forthwith.

What is the status of the methodological outline for the
further study of rumors? I believe that we should have it ready
not later than the 29th for introduction into the agenda of the
Planning Committee immediately the forthcoming rumor report is
issued.
