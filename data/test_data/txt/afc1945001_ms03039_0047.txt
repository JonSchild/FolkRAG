Nebraska
August 8, 1942

young women and townspeople are giving wonderful assistance in many sections by
getting out in the harvest fields), others too busy in various kinds of defense
work, and they are concerned more with the war effort and its immediate and
future effects.  The general feeling is that we must not relax our efforts in 
the production lines, in the fields, in the purchase of war bonds, and in getting
vital morale back into use.....in fact, in any of the small ways we are called
upon to help.

Apart from this report....yet in line with sentiment trend, is a
growing impatience and dissatisfaction with the seeming inactivity or slowness
of the local Martin-Nebraska Bomber Plant to swing into production.  The
general feeling is that something is wrong....something is holding up production,
and it is fast reaching the point where even employees are becoming dissatisfied
and are openly expressing their desire that "perhaps the Government should step
in and run it, or at least try again to find out what is wrong."

The picture seems to be this:  For quite some time, the Martin Plant
officials experienced difficulty in obtaining skilled labor, and one reason for
this seemed to be that they were reluctant to pay the wage scales comparable to
surrounding states.  After a time, this was ironed out and higher wages are now
being paid, although there still remains a need for those in the skilled category.
However, at the present time, the difficulty appears to be that they cannot keep
those on their payrolls busy enough to make them thoroughly satisfied and content.
Many are complaining about this state of affairs, and it is rumored they do not
hesitate to say they are dissatisfied and what to make a change.....that the production is so slow they are not kept busy and that they would prefer to go elsewhere
so they would not have to make pretense of keeping busy.  This is substantiated
in part, not only by the workmen themselves, but also by reports now
