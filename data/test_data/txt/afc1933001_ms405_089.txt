Reminisces 

Old-timers in Haskell, Texas, yet point out to strangers the
location of a famous emporium for the thirsty which bore this invitation
to patrons, The Road To Ruin. These four ominous words were painted in
black letters which reached entirely across the broad expanse of pine
boards that constituted the front of the saloon. In those early days
signs were made to be read at long distances.

The grim truth, the reckless flaunting of the results of
riotous life, carried by the warning words, brought rich rewards to
the proprietor of The Road To Ruin. Among the cowboys it became a 
famous place to "wood up for a long drouth." Through its broad, open
doors, to match the wild spirit of the saloon man, groups of cowpunchers
would sometimes ride their horses inside and up to the bar and take
their drinks while seated in the saddle, [while] so their hor[n]s as rested their
front feet on the brass rail of The Road To Ruin.
