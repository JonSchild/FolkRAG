Songs of Many Lands
America, The Beautiful
1. O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain.

America! America!
God shed His grace on thee,
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.

2. O beautiful for pilgrim feet
Whose stern, impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness

America! America!
God mend thine every flaw,
Confirm thy soul in self control,
Thy liberty in law.

3. O beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife, 
Who more than self their country loved,
And mercy more than life.

America! America!
May God thy gold refine
Till all success be nobleness
And ev'ry gain divine.

4. O beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years,
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears

America! America!
God shed His grace on thee,
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.

Auld Lang Syne
1. Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never bro't to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne?
Refrain
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne;
We'll tak' a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne.

2. And here's a hand, my trusty frien,
And gie's a hand o'thine;
We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet,
For auld lang syne.

Home on the Range
1. Oh, give me a home where the buffalo
roam,
Where the deer and the antelope play,
Where seldom is heard a discouraging 
word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

Refrain
Home, home on the range,
Where the deer and the antelope play,
Where seldom is heard a discouraging 
word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

2. How often at night
When the heavens are bright
With the lights from the glittering 
stars
Have I stood there amazed,
And asked, as I gazed,
If their glory exceeds that of ours.

5. Where the air is so pure, the
zephyrs so free,
The breezes so balmy and light,
That I would not exchange my home
on the range
For all the cities so bright.

Ain't Gwine Study War No More (Spiritual)

1. I's gwine to lay down my burden
Down by the riverside, down by the
riverside, down by the riverside;
I's gwine to lay down my burden, 
Down by the riverside
To study war no more.

Chorus
I ain't gwine study war no more,
Ain't gwine study war no more,
Ain't gwine study war no more,
I ain't giwne study war no more, 
Ain't gwine study war no more, 
Ain't gwine study war no more.

2. I's gwine to lay down my sword an' shield,

3. I's gwine to try on my long white robe,

4. I's gwine to try on my starry crown,

5. I's gwine to talk with the Prince of 
Peace.
