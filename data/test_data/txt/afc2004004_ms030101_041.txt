She show me her napkin as red as 
cherry
That couldn't entice [him] me in
She showed her tie, was yaller 
as gold
And that would entice me in

St. Jamsey Hospital
One mornin (2) through the St. Jamsey
                     hospital
"   in May
Who should I saw but my dearest
old daughter
She was wrapped up in linen and
carryin' away
Dear mudder (2) when I did forsake you
"   you hear my cry
My poor bones are breakin'
"    "   hearts are achin'
For I am a young child cut down
in my prime
