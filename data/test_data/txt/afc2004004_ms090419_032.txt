Really Black. . . M. C. Orr. . .

You people will have to excuse me for being so black.
It was eleventeen of us brothers in our family and the older
we got the blacker we got.  The youngest brother was named 
invisible. He's never been seen. Maw had to sprinkle talcum
powder on that boy to tell where to spank him at. It was so 
many of us black children in the family till one morning paw just
got tired of it and told maw, "You better pick out the best looking,
because I'm gonna drowned the rest of um ."I reckon that must

I was born there wasn't nobody home but me and my paw. My maw was
up town shopping. Maw come home and looked at me, say, " He ain't
like me. " Paw say, "He ain't like me. " You know, it made me
so devilish mad, I started to pack up and go back.

but I'm married. I got a wife so big and fat and greasy I have to
put ashes in the bed at night to keep her from slipping out. We got
one of the cutest, one of the slickest, one of the blackest little
coal-oil stoves you've ever seen. You peoples know times is hard.
The harder times gets, the harder sumpin to eat gets. Take a
little common thing as pork chops, cost four dollars a ounce.
You know that's too much to pay for pork chips. Pinto beans,
three dollars an ounce. That's what you pay for pinto beans.
Chitlin's --four dollars a yard.,That's too much to pay for
hog bowels. Times is so hard the ladies can't buy powder
to powder their face, have to powder with flour. I was out this
