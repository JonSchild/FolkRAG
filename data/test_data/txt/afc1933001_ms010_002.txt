Dear Mr. Lomax:
     I should very much appreciate it if you would let us know what 
your plans are, about when we may expect you to return to Washington, 
and where mail will reach you until then.
    We have had a recent inquiry which we do not seem to be able to 
answer.  The inquiry is as follows:  “Will you kindly furnish free 
the correct definition of the word Doggie, as it appears in the song
‘The Last Round UP'.”
     I am enclosing herewith copy of the song so that you may see the 
contexts.  Any information that you may be able to provide, I shall
be glad to forward promptly to inquirer who has been advised that we
would have to refer the question to you.
With very kind regards I am

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music
