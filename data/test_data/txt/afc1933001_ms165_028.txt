Three Lectures Given by Georgia McNally

"Adolph Hitler via the Viking Trail to America"
(PUBLIC AFFAIRS)
It is an old custom to follow the pioneer trails
to the Goal of Desire, hence these Northern Folk
have reason to believe that Hitler seeks the Shetlands,
Orkneys, Hebrides and Faroe Islands as stepping
stones with bases in Iceland, Greenland, Labrador
and Newfoundland from which he might conquer
North America. Vivid descriptions of these
islands, and their possibilities for such use.

"The Hebrides - Home of the Scottish Clans"
(HISTORY AND TRAVEL)
Their history, myths and legends - Flora McDonald, 
their Joan of Arc. The Isle of St. Kilda,
the bird refuge, the gannets and sea birds. The
influence of their men on international affairs. "A
Man's a Man for a' That."

"Shall We Lose Culture - the Flower of Civilization"
(POETRY, MUSIC AND ART)
Music, poetry and the allied arts can save us
from savagery. An ancient and high culture still
exists, lighted by the torch of pure christianity unpolluted
by politics and greed in the Hebrides.
Songs in Gaelic and the reading of her own poetry
from "BLUEBELLS AND MYSTIC ISLES," written
while there. The marvelous and strange coloring
of land, sea and sky.
