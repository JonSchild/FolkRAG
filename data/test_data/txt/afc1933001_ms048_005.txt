Dear Mr. Spinacke :
Please get the postage 
due package mentioned on the 
enclosed card The Presto people 
may be sending something of use
to Alan. I do not recall that 
I ordered anything.

I think any copies 
I make for my Ballad Book 
will be good enough for Library
use and of course they will 
be Library property in case you
furnish the[m] blanks. I am entirely
willing to work that way or
to furnish the records. So on
