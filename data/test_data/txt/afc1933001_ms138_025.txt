Mr. Alan Lomax

Ironwood, Michigan 
Dear Mr. Lomax:
     I am not disgusted with you at all, rather sorry that you had a lot 
of trouble. Please re-read my previous letter about taking things a 
little easier. Your plans at the moment, for instance, seem to me terribly 
ambitious. Anyway it was Mr. Waters who had to do all the work because, 
due to an illness in New York, I did not return until last week.
     There is little new here except that the British Broadcasting Corporation 
sent us a marvelous letter of appreciation and authorized us to use 
it in any way we see fit.
     Eric Clarke has at last arranged to visit me at the Library (I saw 
him in New York). He will arrive about October 25 but I do not believe 
it necessary for you to be here at the time. I should appreciate, however, 
a list of a few of the best (acoustically) records so that I can give him 
a demonstration which will counteract his prejudice. Please do this immediately 
so that I can impress him.
     I still have not recommended any extension of stay for you but since 
my original recommendation said “about” two months, I do not expect any 
trouble on this score. However, if you can tell me exactly on what day 
you want your leave in Chicago to start, I shall be glad to recommend.an 
extension just to keep the records straight.
With best regards,
Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
