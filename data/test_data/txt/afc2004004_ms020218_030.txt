to do with him -- my daughter was got on [a] that yellow plum tree.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  I 'member that!  The first time I ever
remember sumpin' comin' in to me, an' it broke.  'Cause he's
a man you see.  He know how to take time with me, you know,
an'...take...turn...an' git stuff for me to knew (?)
an' [all] like that kinda thing, see?
AL:  He sort of taught you as he went along?
BJ:  He taught me as he went along.  He didn't try to break
in to me; he was a man, you see.  Um hum.  I remember that was.
Then you know another thing? A lot of people say that you
know all about things like that.  But you do and you don't.
I'm sure of that.  He used to tell me about doin' different
things, you know, doin' that, you know? An' I tol' him one
night, I say, "I can see no sense in it."  Thought he was
doin' it jus' to be doin' it.  He said, "You don't?"  I said
"No."  He said, "Then (sit through the fireplace a little ?)
      He said, "You mean you don't see nothin..."
I said, "I sure don't."  You know what I was then? I was
7 months gone with my baby.  All this other power had done
passed over me, see? An' he looked on me.  An' he learned
sumpin'.  He liked me a lot.  Right then.  I didn't know
nothin' about no -- you know, no feelin' with no men.
AL:  You hadn't felt anything?
BJ:  No, suh.  The doctor say it jus' nerves. The (womb's ?)
come back over you and close back up. Just inherited, you see.

An' I didnt (spin?).  I hadn't spinned, you know?  Tha's
what it is.  I hadn't.  An' so, he tol' me, so he start from 
my feet and come to my head, until he find a weak spot on me.  
An' boy, I shout with joy that night.  Ha! Ha! Ha!  When he 
find it, I shout with joy!  'Cause there's a weak spot on
Everybody, ya know, there's a certain weak spot.  Now, that's the difference;
if that been a boy, he wouldn't knowed it, you see?  But
he just say it's sumpin' else.  He jus' figured there's nothin' to it, 
or sumpin' like that, ya see? An' no doubt
when [the] time [come] they wouldn't a knowed it,
ya see.  A long time -- I knowed all right -- but -- he sure
did.
[*repeat*] 
I'll never forget that!  I said, "I don't see no sense in
doin' it at all.  You're just doin' it jus' to be doin' it."  An'
