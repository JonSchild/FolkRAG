Bessie Jones, Reel 2, 6/26/61 Song 2
 
WASH IN THE BEAUTIFUL STREAM
A baptizing song

Oh, Naman did led
That Simon serene,
They went to the beautiful stream,
And he felt that he was lost
And he shouldered his cross
And he washed in the beautiful stream.
CHORUS:
Go wash in the beautiful stream,
-ful stream,
Go wash in the beautiful stream,
Go Naman, go Naman,
Go down and wash,
Go wash in the beautiful stream.

If you feel that you're lost,
Just shoulder your cross
And get in to the beautiful stream,
If you feel that you're sick,
Just come to Him quick
And wash in the beautiful stream.
(CHORUS)
