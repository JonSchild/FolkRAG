Rumors I have heard: 
Clothes would be ration
This month after Easter. 

The war would probably 
be over in 1944 or 45. 

Hitler is dead. 

That very shortly
boys who are seventeen
would be drafted. 

That a third ration 
book would be issued
next month. 

That Britian says that 
we are suppling the ammunition
and they are taking the 
credit instead of the United States.
