SENATOR ELMER THOMAS

THE AMERICAN INDIAN
THE INDIANS OF ALASKA AND THE 
NORTHWEST

Senator Thomas is Chairman of the Senate
Committee on Indian Affairs, and has been a life
long student of the Indians of Oklahoma and of
other Indians. Recently he has made a trip to
Alaska where he has gathered new material which
will be welcome news to those who have heard his
previously successful talks chiefly about the Indians
of Oklahoma.
