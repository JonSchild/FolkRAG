Dear Alan:

I have just emerged from a School of the Air confab in which 
it was decided to have our usual Preview on Tuesday, October 1, from 
10:15 to 10:45 P.M. It will consist of "teasers" from all five of the 
shows; and the general subject of Latin America. That leaves us with 
the task of selecting something from the February 4 and 11 programs for 
our sample. All we can do, I think is present one, Alan Lomax, singing 
(with a group of kids) something like "Adelita"; and follow it with an 
orchestral number of the same type. Explanations of the two series of 
programs inbetween. We can get the use of some actors, so perhaps you 
would like to do a little dramatic introduction to our song, then sing 
it, then have the kids join you. Total time allotted for you, the kids, 
and the orchestra is 6 minutes. And---thanks to a little well-timed 
arguing, I can get $50 for your time, trouble and expenses.

Actually the Preview should fit in nicely with your plans, for 
your first show comes off the following Tuesday. I think you might use 
the same kids for the Preview that you plan to use on the October 8 
program. I will start looking for an appropriate orchestral number on 
Monday, so the sooner you let me know what you want to sing, the better. 
Personally, I don't think we'll have much of a problem.

Our first orchestral script is all finished ----just to 
make you fell guilty !

Cordially,

Bill
