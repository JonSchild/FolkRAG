55A1       Yen Valou
Loi to whom the song is
especially addressed: Papa
Sobo.

It is customary to sing three songs to each loi in turn and to
the flags when they are brought out; but in this ceremony
this custom was not adhered to, possibly
because the ceremony was brief and comparatively unimportant.

It should be noted that most of the songs were not completely
recorded from beginning to end and that not all the songs of
the ceremony were registered. This was due to the fact that
I had only five ten inch records left out of the forty I had
brought to Haiti.

Sobo 'mander im geve,
Nous mander drapeaux,
Sobo 'mander un geve,
Drapeaux ca elue,
(This is repeated three times to make a complete 
phrase
stanza.)
(Then later)
Sobo kesuu mander un geve,
Li mander drapeaux,
Sobo Kesou mander un geve,
Li mander drapeaux,
Drapeaux ca elue,
(Later)
Atisu mander um geve,
Li Mander mander drapeaux,
Atisu mander un geve,
Li mander drapeaux,
Drapeaux ca elue,
Ago, ago,----
