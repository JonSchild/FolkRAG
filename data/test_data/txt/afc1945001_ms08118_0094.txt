Anecdote 

Two Soldiers

Two soldiers were killed in battle. 
When they got to St. Peter he gave
one a harp and the other a pic and
shovel.
The one who got the pic and shovel
said, "How did you get a harp?" "You
thief."
The other one said "Yea!" "I know, but
I'm smart."
The one who got the pic said, "what
do you mean you're smart?"
