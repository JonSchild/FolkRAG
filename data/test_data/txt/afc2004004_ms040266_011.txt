Dear Mr. Lomax,
     I presume you have heard of
me from Mr. Legman (France) in regard
to the collecting of sailor's shanties.
      I had a letter from him
recently in which he tells me of your
suggestion for conveying shanty material
across to him. I have commenced getting
the versions together and should have
some ready within the week. He suggests
I should either send them to you through
the post or get someone going to London
to contact you. Well, as a matter of
fact, I myself have been invited to
give a second "lecture" on Shanties
and Shantying by the English Folk Dance
& Song Society, Cecil Sharp House, London
on the 13th (Friday) of January. Would
it be possible to contact you there, at 
Cecil Sharp House (about 7 p.m. I think)
so that I can hand you the material or
would you like me to call at your address?
I will probably arrive in London about
3p.m. and return the same evening on
the night train (10.45 Paddington).
     I have been collecting shanties
for many years now, being an ex-sailing
ship man, and have often wondered how
to contact you. You see Doerflinger
mentions the book "Our Singing Country"
and refers to a song "Haul away my Rosie" &
others in which I am interested. Although I've
searched a few reference libraries I
haven't managed to get a copy. Perhaps
you could help me? Until I hear from you,
I remain,
Yours sincerely,
