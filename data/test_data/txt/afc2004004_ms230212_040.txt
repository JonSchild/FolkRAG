Everybody mark time
Let us walk that
Help? Me
Answer that in time
Let us go to the river
There has water
Tell them, Mama
Come and see me there
We are going to drink rum
We shall eat
We shall take a rest
We want a little pause
All men hungry-
They can't do anything
The rope is burning their hands
Look at their state                                      [Voice-"Give it salt-water",etc..]
Everybody nothing
Tell them
Tell them mama
Adeline sick
Adeline sick
Everybody mark time
Everybody support
Answer that in time
Tell them hi-oh
Tell them mama
Let us go
We are coming
Where is the shell
I want to see it [her, him]
Blow it for me
