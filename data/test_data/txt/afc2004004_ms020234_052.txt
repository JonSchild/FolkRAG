BJ TAPE 20, p. 49

BJ:      'Cause he got to go to work.  You see?   An', an' first, 
an' knowin' it, didn' worry it.   Radio or anything, 'cause you 
know, he, he  helped put me to sleep.    (THIS IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND,
PROBABLY BECAUSE OF WORN SPOTS ON TAPE.   ALSO A FAULTY 
REPAIR IN THE TAPE HAD TO BE REDONE DURING TRANSCRIPTION, DURING 
WHICH PROCESS A WORD OR TWO WAS CUT OUT OF THE TAPE.  DH)   Instead 
a wakin' me up.  He'd go to sleep!
           An' then, I'll tell ya another thing:   He sit -- Like I sit 
here talkin' now, over Bible things, or jes' a conversation.   It 
could be one, 2 or 3 men.   Nothin' but men, sittin' there talk'
with me.    An' George git up to go to bed, George don't say 
nothin' but ease on out.   He goin' to bed.   But I been known he 
gone to bed.   An' we sit there an' talk, sometimes say, "Where is 
George?"
           Say, "George asleep."   Hum, hum!

[* (GEORGE-- TRUSTING BJ) *]
          He never say, "Why did they stay?" or "What did they talk 
to you about?"   Nothin'.   George said. . .
TL:       Really?
BJ:       Yeah.   Yeah, never.   I -- He have never tol' me, but I heard  
'im tell peoples an' I heard folks tell me many a-many times, 
George say he, he don't worry about me; he trust me anywhere. 
Any time with any body.   Sometimes people pass me, me be with George, 
say, "I picked up your wife today."   I be comin' from the pay 
house (?) or comin' from anywhere, be workin' where. . .Say, "I 
picked up your wife today an' brought 'er home."
An' George say, "You better not pass my wife walkin', hah, 
an' don't pick 'er up!" You see?
TL:        Really?
