Wilton, Conn.
3/27/1935.

Dear Mr. Shunk:

The $8.84 twice paid Express
charge on the recording machine
from Washington to Wilton
is yet unadjusted. The agent
here has heard nothing except
through me.

Miss Ruth Benedict, Editor
of the American Journal of Folk-Lore
has sent to me the Mellinger E. Henry
[of] Biography of American Folk Songs,
undoubtedly a valuable and useful
work. She wants the Library
of Congress to publish it. Have
you any funds that might
be used for this purpose
