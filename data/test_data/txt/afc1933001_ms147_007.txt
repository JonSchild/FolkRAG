Dr. E. C. Beck
Michigan State College
Mount Pleasant, Michigan

Dear Doctor Beck:

   I have delayed this long in writing you again
because I hoped up to the last minute that I would
be able to come to Michigan as I had planned.
Work at the Library will probably keep me in Washington
until the end of August, and by then I presume
you will be away from Michigan on your vacation.

   The material which you can make available to the
Archive will certainly be among the most important
collections in the country and I still look forward
with great eagerness to collaborating with you in
putting the voices of your old lumber jacks on permanent
recordings.  In this regard, if you can tell
me when you plan to return to Mount Pleasant, I
feel sure that John A. Lomax or myself will be able
to visit you at some time in the coming fall.

   I did not know before a few days ago that you
and my father are old friends and if I am not able
to come myself, perhaps his coming would mean a
very pleasant get-together.  He has asked me to send 
you his very best regards and to ask you whether you
would give his permission to use the version of
"Little Brown Bulls", which I recorded last summer, in
his forthcoming book American Ballad and Folksongs,
No. 2.

   I look forward to hearing from you again.  Please
accept my apologies for such a long delay in replying
to your last letter.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
