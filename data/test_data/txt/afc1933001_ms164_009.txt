Mr. Hans Christian Adamson
Central Park West at 79th.
New York City, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Adamson:

Here are four or five tunes that should serve your
purpose well, I think. They should be "slow, draggy and
mournful". All of them appear in Cowboy Songs by John A.
and Alan Lomax, MacMillan Co., New York, 1938.

Whoopie Ti Yi Yo, page 4.
Doney Gal, page 8.
The Old Chisholm Trail, page 36.
The Cowboy's Dream, page 44.
The Trail to Mexico, page 52
Night Herding Song, page 60.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
