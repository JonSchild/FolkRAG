May I add that there are a lot of people who have their name on the church rolls,
there are a lot of people who frequent the church building, who in the judgment
shall find themselves sent to Hell.
MY LORD.  MY LORD
In fact the church-the church building, is a nice place to go to Hell from. 
WELL..ALRIGHT.  PREACH.
You know it certainly, it look-looks better, it sounds better to go to Hell
from the church than it does to go to Hell from a dive.
YEAMEN.  YEAMEN.  THAT'S RIGHT. 
A man get shot down in a dive,, o-o-o-h his people come to the eulogy, the funeral
an' they stood around and they lament, they're sorrowful, they're broken because
their relatives, their loved ones, met death in a dive.
YEAMEN.  THAT'S RIGHT.  YEAMEN.
But we who only have our names on the church rolls, we who only pretend to be 
what we really know we're not, we who really have not been regenerated or born
again, are good for Hell out of the church.
YEAH.  YEAH.  THAT'S RIGHT.
If you think with me for a moment, you'll recall that David with all-ll of his
experiences with God, with even having said of him by God that he was a man after
his own heart, David got uneasy on a certain occasion, about who was go in' to
Heaven and who was goin' to Hell.  An' he said, "Lord, who shall stand in that [thy]
holy hill, and who shall dwell in thy holy place" 
WELL..WELL YES
