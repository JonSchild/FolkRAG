Reverend Roe.  Reel .3.  P. 6
we had the old blue-back speller, you know, and I could read most
any book I picked up, you know.  That old speller, you know, back there,
you know, it would give you the definition of words, so that's all I
had.  I'd see the white boys going to school and lot of them would 
help me -- they like me because I was good-natured.  They would play
with me because I was funny and good-natured, and they let me look 
at their books, and some of them would show me things in the books, and 
things like that.  Of curse, that helped me a good deal, and I made 
friends with them.  The white folks at home that I was telling you 
about - Lee, the home where the old lady lived? -- they would never
have a play amongst the white for young folks without inviting me.
I'd go there as a serving-fellow, and help them.  Those white boys
and white girls were just as familiar with me as if I'd have been
their brother.  I've known when Mrs. Lee would send me in the room
to make Molly get up to come and cook breakfast.  Yes sir, I went in
there and go'd up to Molly, and Molly'd say, "Getout!"  She'd be
hitting me, and I'd grab her by the leg and pull her out the bed and
run.  All fair's in fun, you know.  She knew I meant no harm, and they
know'd me.  Yes sir, I was just like one of the family.
