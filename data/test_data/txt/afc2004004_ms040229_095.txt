If you are manly don't be gloomy

If you wish to be praised, die;
If you wish to be dispraised, marry

A cow will spoil a fold, a woman a township

The nature of a hen, a sow & of a woman
To take their own way

Teaching the turbulent woman is like strokes 
of a hammer on cold iron

Whom God will not instruct, man cannot
teach

The end of the day is no less in God's sight
than the beginning.

The nut has a cap on, there's rain a -coming
The owl is mourning, floods are coming

The tenantry are stronger than the Lord
The tribe stronger than the chief
Goe back to the old Highland [position of] concepts
shd be made substance of the arg between
yg man and mistr
