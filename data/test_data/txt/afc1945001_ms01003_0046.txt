EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
OFFICE FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To: Mr. R. Keith Kane  Date: April 22, 1942
From: Charles Siepmann
Subject: RUMOR

You asked me to rough out an agenda for the discussion
of rumor research. I think I can quite briefly state our needs.
They are much as follows.

We badly need information on:

1. How widely current rumor in general is throughout 
the country.

2. What specific types of rumor achieve approximate
nation-wide circulation.

3. Areas of special infection, i.e. in what kind of environment
does rumor mostly tend to circulate -- industrial
areas, east or west coast, rural areas, etc.

4. What type of rumor is getting around.

5. What correlation if any, is there between current rumors
and current Axis propaganda lines.

6. What kind of person in what kind of environment is
most susceptible.

7. How and where various rumor types start. (If this can
be discovered).

We want the above information to pass on to networks
and local stations as a basis for general directives on the 
handling of rumor.

In addition, we are anxious to get your help in gathering
in from Government agencies (Department of Justice, Army, Navy)
types of rumor which they regard as dangerous.
