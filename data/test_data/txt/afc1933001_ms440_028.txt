Mr. John A. Lomax,
Wilton, Conn.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Since receipt of your letter of February 12th I have been trying to find out some- thing about Walter Boyd, the negro who, according to your letter, was defended by Mahaffey & Keeney charged with murder in the District Court of Bowie County in 1917.
The firm of Mahaffey & Keeney dissolved a number of years ago. Both are still living in Texarkana but neither can remember any-thing at all about this case. 

The case of Boyd vs. State, 
No. 5040, is reported in 203 S.W. 900. He was tried by Judge H. G. O'Neal who is now about 80 years old and living at Atlanta, Cass County, Texas. J. D. Baker was Sheriff at the time. His home is still here by he spends practically all his time in Dallas and I have not been able to see him. It is extremely doubtful whether Judge O'Neal will remember anything about the case at this late date. Boyd's appeal was dismissed with the following notation: 
"DAVIDSON, P.J. Appellant was allotted a term of 20 years in the penitentiary under conviction for murder. It is made satisfactorily to appear by the affidavit of the deputy sheriff and jailor that appellant made his escape from jail by over-powering the jailer, and was later captured. He did not voluntarily return, but was arrested. The motion of the assistant attorney general to dismiss for this reason will be sustained. The appeal therefore will be dismissed".
