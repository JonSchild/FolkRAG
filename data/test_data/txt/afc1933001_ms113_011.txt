Dear Dr. Botkin:

Alan recorded for the use of the Office of War 
Information a record of Tampa longshoremen singing 
various stevedore work songs.  We have made a copy of 
that record and the original I think should be deposited 
in the Archive.

The record is coming to you under separate cover 
and all the necessary information is written on the 
jacket.  I hope you will like it.

Maybe [I hope] this gift can be reciprocal -- you know, 
an eye for an eye!  We certainly do want those records 
we ordered.

Sincerely yours,
Bess
