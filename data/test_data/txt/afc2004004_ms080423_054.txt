Male caller:   . . . I think the fuse is getting (down?) by now,
don't you?   I want you all to stand up.   We're going to have
an old fashioned handshake.  If the devil don't like that. . .
I want you  Just stand up, if you're not acquainted with that
one behind you or beside ye, I want you to get acquainted 
right real quick.   We're going to sing, "I saw the light."
Do you remember the day when you saw it?   (Lots of assenting
voices from the audience.)   When the light shined up on your heart 
and your soul---lost, condemned and doomed to eternal hell.
That light shined up on you.   Oh, what a difference it makes,
don't it?   Them's going to do the verse and we're going to
do the chorus, real loud.   We're going to jar this ceiling, 
can we do that all right?   O-kay.   I saw the light.   Let's 
go now, all right?

                          _______________________________
                          Praise the lord, I saw the light. (repeats)
                          No more darkness, no more night.
                          Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight.
                          Praise the loard, I saw the light.
                            (Second verse unintelligible, chorus repeats. )

MAN CALLER:   I believe we can sing that just a little bit louder.
Just one more time.   Don't you think?   Excuse me but. . .(unclear)
. . .I believe I will, all right?   (Low levels, unintelligible). . .let's
sing that just a little bit louder.
