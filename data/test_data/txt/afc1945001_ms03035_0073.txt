Rumor: A housewife, 35, said to me that she had been told by a friend who 
had just received a letter from a soldier in a camp in Tennessee
that some of the soldiers were deserting the camp due to a lack of
food and the way it was prepared, and also due to not having any
equipment with which to train.
