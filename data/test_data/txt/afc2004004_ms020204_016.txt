Vera Hall,  reel  8,  page 7 . . . 

V:  She realy did.  She didn't care what I said or what nobody
said.  She wasn't ready and she didn't come.  I just believe
she didn't come till she knowed she was ready herself. 
A: There are some people that will pretend, aren't there, Vera.
V:  Well, a lots of times I have seen people that I thought
just got religion because the other one got it, because I have
heard um say, I know if she get  religion, I'm sho  gon get one.
So I don believe in that kind of doins  .  So they've got
a lot of them in Shilo Baptist church just like that--- now
(700) those girls down at Parker place, there's [*3*] of um , 
I don't remember their names, but their mama bought them new
dresses when they got religion and the other girl , Miss MAriah'S 
daughter, she didn't have a new dress and she said  "Well, all
right I bet I'll have one for the baptizin because I'm gon 
get religion.  And so sho nuff, she come up, --  today Saturday,
they gon baptize tomorrow-- she got religion today way fo'n 
time for  the sto's to close in town and she got religion and
she told some um that her mother could get her dress now
cause the stores aren't even closed to be ready for baptizin
tomorrow.  So I don't believe in that religion.  Nobody didn't
believe in it.  But the pastor, he baptized her.  He says,
"I can't hep it, says-uh, I can't hep what youall think, I
can't hep what the mother think, said, the Bible say' Whosoever
come in my name, take um, judge ye not, say, let me judge.
I can't judge um. Say, evy tub gotta set on its own bottoms. 
Say, this chileis got to die for herself.  If she think
she can live with what she doin--- I'm gonna do what God command
