discussion concerning your immediate need of bettering
facilities for your field work. I see that you
ask for as much as $350.00 for the proper equipment
of your automobile. I understand that you are at
once having the work done and wish to furnish receipted
bills. I expect to see Mr. Leland on Friday of this
week and then can in more detail take up your more
extended interest in further studies of the same character
as those you now are carrying on for the Library
of Congress."

You can understand that the ideal arrangement for
me would be the one proposed by Mr. Stevens. Now that
The Carnegie Corporation has agreed to advance the
funds necessary for expenses, I am wondering if Mr.
Stevens would be satisfied for for the present, at least,
to advance only what is required in addition for the
maintenance of my family. Since Mr. Putnam seems to
think in his letter of January 6th to me, that some
complication may arise in this matter, my own opinion
is that we should clear up this point immediately,
either through you or through Mr. Leland. On the same
day that I wrote to you, I also sent a similar letter
to Mr. Leland, to which he has not as yet replied.

In my wire, as you will also see, I suggested
that if necessary, I could come to Washington. I
should, however, regret very much to make the journey
because of the expense and time involved unless the
project was seriously imperilled and my presence there
could aid in clarifying the situation.

I note what you say concerning the extension of
the work in other fields. In think in a little time
that we can get larger movements started and I am
naturally very pleased at your suggestion that
I should direct the work. Mr. Stevens told me, by
the way, that in my project I "was working down his
alley;" that he was intensely interested in seeing
the job thoroughly done. Through him I think you can
hope to expect very much.

In order to save time, I am sending a copy of
this letter to Mr. Putnam and am also enclosing herewith
a copy of a letter that I am writing Mr. Stevens
in reply to his favor of January 2nd.
