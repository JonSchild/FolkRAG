Dear Father,

Your advice about the book came a little late.  The publisher asked me to submit a sample chapter before we mail the contract and right now I don't have the time to bother with it.  I've got to scratch around to find some quicker way of earning some money.

The Texas-ex banquet was, so far as I was concerned, only a mild success.  I was much too tired to go and told them so in advance.  I went to bed over the weekend with my first chest ailment of the season.  Tom Connally made a very funny speech.

I'm awfully sorry to hear the news about Chris and I'll write Shirley at once.  I guess everybody will be in the same or other boats pretty soon heading for some foreign shore.  it looks like Shirley will stay in Dallas with you where she may be able to earn some money rather than go out to Lovett.  Should think you all could console her better than her Dust Bowl friends.

It's good to hear that you're in your natural element again on the lecture platform.  I'll call Charles Seeger who has become one of the Silver Burdett managing editors and ask him to write you about that.

Bess tells me that she has a regular office and expects to get a regular salary soon from CBS.

There's no more news at present about the trip.  I'm awfully sorry about that.  Will let you know just as soon as it's definite.

I'm holding the Emrich letter for my files unless you want it back.  I'm going to write an apply for membership in his Board.

Best Regards.  Much love to you and Deanie,
