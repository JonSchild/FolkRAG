to justify its demands.

ILLINOIS

One rumor is that Government is about to take over
private bank deposits; another is that war bonds will
be worth less in ten years then now and should not be bought; another that
the Government is conspiring with Russia -- fanned by Dies' statement -- and
the Government demise of the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad is
just the beginning.  Because of influence of Chicago Tribune, Hearst
press and undercover isolationist groups in continually giving currency
to rumors and even manufacturing them State might be considered to have
a rather acute rumor situation.

INDIANA

Rumors concerning Pearl Harbor and our war production
effort have all earmarks of organized propaganda.
A new line is being taken now in use of smutty stories which
most people like to hear.  These stories range from disrespectful
stories of White House and its occupants to inanities about shortages
and daylight saving time.  Rumors to effect that it is necessary to have
political pull to obtain an officer's commission are current.  Another
rumor which concerns Selective Service states that men with wives and
children will certainly be called into service within a few months.

IOWA

State apparently has its fair share of rumors
floating about as evidenced by a recent editorial
in a Des Moines paper, which traced a story of Japanese mutilation of
prisoners to three unconfirmed sources.  Because exact cause of recent
explosions at Burlington ordnance plant has never been given to the
public, there are many rumors of sabotage.  Mother of a young draftee
reported that her son who, before his induction, was imbued with patriotism, 
having put all his savings into defense bonds, had now become
supercritical and bitter against commercial institutions which he felt
were exploiting the men in uniform.  Being alarmed that such a change
could come over the young men in a very short period, the mother suggested
the possibility that some of his bitterness might be caused by
subversion elements.  Generally, however, there are a minimum of rumors.

KANSAS

Some arch-critics of the President have convinced a
few poorly informed persons that the President will
ban all Congressional and State elections this fall.  Such rumors are
of local origin and usually of a strictly partisan character.  Anti-New
Dealers have stated quite openly that Nelson's plan for joint management-
labor committees is a Communistic brain-trust scheme to sovietize
American industry, but few people have listened to such gossip.  There
is no tangible evidence that these reports emanate from subversive or
actively disloyal groups.  Number of unthinking sixth columnists in
State is probably relatively large, but the deliberate rumor-monger is
exceedingly rare.
