Lomax: That's a beauty, that's a beauty, Harry.
Cox: That's what you tell me, When I get away you'll say, "Tthey're
a rotten lot o' muck."
Lomax: What?
Cox: When I get away, you'll say, "They're a damn rum lot o'
songs, they are."
Lomax: (laughs) What about The Firelock Stile, Harry?
Cox: You got him on it, ain't you?
Lomax: No, we didn't take that.
Cox: Didn't you take that?
Lomax: No.
Cox: Didn't you?
Lomax: Didn't record it, no.
Cox: No, well, yeah. You want to get what you want now I'm here,
you know I don't when ever you'll see me any more.
Lomax: Go right on.
Cox:
So come all young men, come listen a while,
I'll tell you what happened at Firelock Stile,
When a stump of a nail catch hold of her clo'es.
She fell down and she did expose her old
Rumpatum tooral looral addity
Rumpatum tooral looral day.

A gay young buck was standing by,
The sight of her quim, that dazzled his eye,
She said, "Young man, I feel amazed,
To see a young gentleman stand and gaze at my
Rumpatum tooral looral addity,
Rumpatum tooral looral day."

She said, "Young man, if you mean what you say
Twenty bright guineas in gold for to pay,
Twenty bright guineas in gold for to pay,
And then, young man, you may fiddle away on me
Rumpatum tooral looral addity
Rumpatum tooral looral day.
