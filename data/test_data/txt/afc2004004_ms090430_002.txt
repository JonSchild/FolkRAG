A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF 
THE YAZOO-MISSISSIPPI DELTA

          In his account of the explorations of Ferdinand 
DeSoto through the Mississippi Valley and across the Father 
of Waters, the narrator, Garcilasco de la Vega gives to us 
the first recorded account of a great Mississippi River flood.
          DeSoto had previously, in 1541, cross the 
Mississippi, which he called the Rio Grande (Great River) 
and travelled through what is now Arkansas and Louisiana 
and 1543 had returned to the mighty river. Here, either near 
Helena or the mouth of the Arkansas River, he was attacked 
by Indians and later beset by a great flood.
          "The water took forty days to reach its peak 
and it was a beautiful think to look upon the sea where 
there had been fields. On each side of the river, the water 
extended across twenty leagues of land, and all of this area 
was navigated by canoes and nothing was seen except the tops 
of the tallest trees."
          He records that, according to the Indians, these 
floods occur every fourteen years, and that they are caused 
by heavier winter snows in the mountains of the North followed 
by heavy spring rains. 
          This mighty flood came down in March, 1543, and 
did not recede until late in May.
