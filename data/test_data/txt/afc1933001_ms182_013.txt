Dear Sir:

24156 - Ogdel Carrier

I feel sure your letter of May 7th refers
to the inmate carried on our records as above.

This man was released August 7, 1937 and
we have had no subsequent contact with him.

He resided at Church Point, Louisiana and
it is quite possible that you could reach him there.

Very truly yours,
DD Bazer

D. D. Bazer,
Warden
