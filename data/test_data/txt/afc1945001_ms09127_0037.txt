4.  My mother was in the butcher shop last
Monday and overheard a conversation
of which couldn't help overhearing
between the butcher and the man who
delivered the meat.  This man was telling
the butcher of how pretty soon we 
Chicagoans will soon be without meat 
and this butcher answered telling him
that soon we will be without any
food at all with all this rationing
going on. 
5.  As my father was on the train last
Sunday with his friend, some men
were telling them that we better get
ready soon and be on the lookout for
an attack in Chicago and also N. York.
