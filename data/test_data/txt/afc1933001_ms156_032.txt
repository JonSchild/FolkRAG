Mr. Alan Lomax
Columbia Broadcasting System
New York, N. Y. 

Dear Mr. Lomax:
As the American Library Association as no doubt written you, it is the 
custom for the speakers at the annual meeting to submit the script for 
their talks for publicity releases and for printing later in library 
periodicals. 
I know this is going to bring up something of a problem with you since 
you will be bringing in musical interpolations. It hasn't been the 
custom to have a stenotypist at this meeting and anyhow I believe that 
would be unsatisfactory. 
We should like to have your talk go down in history as it were, but if 
you can't think it is practical, please let me know. 
Is it your custom to distribute any mimeographed sheets to the audience 
and if so, do you take care of this?
If you have any biographical data or printed material about your work 
with the Library of Congress, we shall be glad to have it for publicity 
purposes.
Do you want us to do anything about hotel reservations?
Sincerely yours,
Lesley Newton
Chairman
