Dear Alan:

Greetings to you and the wife from the slums of Bloomington.  I plan to be in Washington several days within the next few weeks and wonder what the slums of Washington can offer.  In case you care to send a note in the mean time, address me at Ohio University, Athens, Ohio.

Cordially yours,
Robert E. Allen
