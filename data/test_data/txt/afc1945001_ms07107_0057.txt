The chief surgeon of Henry Ford Hospital advises us a man told
him August 5 that an Australian who came over here recently on official
business said that  in one Australian city thee were 8,000 American Negro
soldiers and several thousand American white soldiers, and that
considerable conflict existed between the groups owing to the attitude
of Australian girls toward the Negroes.  Australian girls were said to
prefer the colored to the white because they think the Negro "funny and
happy-to-lucky and regard him as a better dancer.  White soldiers are
said to resent this no end.  [*Michigan*] [*9*] [*Aug 5.*]
