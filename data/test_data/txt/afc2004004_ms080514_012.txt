A     For some reason I've always been attracted
to old people.  When I was just a kid, ah
there was an old woman that lived nearby
that needed company, and I used to go and
play solitaire with her, ah, on her lonely
afternoons, and I liked her better than
anybody I knew.  She ah, she was such an old
dog.  I mean, she  chewed snuff and spat in
her spittoon.  She had ah fun all the time, and
she taught me how to play solitaire, taught
me to love to play cards.  And that's the way
that ah culture's really transmitted, from
older people to kids. 

Ah, Margaret Mead once told me that um, that
when an older person ah put her hand on the
arm of one of her grandchildren, his or her
grandchildren, that she really passed on the
whole culture.  Some how it goes right through
the skin,  through body communication.  And of
course that 's the way the arts live, whether
they're fine arts or folk arts.  They all live
by direct communication. [*]*]  You can't learn to
be an opera singer unless you sit in the room
and listen to an opera singer sing, and he
says:  Hold your body this way, do it this
way, and so on.
