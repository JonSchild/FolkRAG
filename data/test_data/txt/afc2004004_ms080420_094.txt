TAPE:  Roll 26
Burton Cove, cont.  p. 1
Sheila:  That's what Cass used to ask me when I was single.  Every
time he seed me talking to a man, he'd start rubbing his neck,
I'd see him standing off in a crowd rubbing his neck, doin' down
like this, wanting to know if I had met the one I'd have my head
cut off for. . .before I'd let him get his cut off, that's what the
story is.
Woman:  Well you finally did, didn't you!?
Sheila:  Well.  I don't know.  (laughter)
Woman:  See, I put you on the spot, didn't I?
Nell:  I don't believe I seed anyone tht I'd have my head cut off
for.
Sheila:  Not before I'd seen their's cut off!
Nell:  That's right, I don't think there's anybody that'd do that.
Cass said that he would, but he never did, and never will.
Sheila:  That reminds me of "Fair Ellender" and "Brown Girl".
Woman:  . . . . Sheila, that he telled, you know, about, gonna go up
yonder and eat them apples, big red apples and things?
Sheila:  No. . . .
Woman:  And I told him one time, "Now Cass, you'd better eat all then
big red apples you can get down here, you may need some up there!"
Cass:  I tell 'em, they'll be big, round cherried, (unint) plum
(unint), watermelon aside, great big pumpkins and all.  I told
Mr. Ray that one time, he said "Eh, you got to (unint)!" (Laughter)
