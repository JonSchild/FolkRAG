Mr. [?ish] Halls songs?
Also we are interested in perhaps 
buying one or two of the records 
listed of square dance music, only
we should hear them first to see 
if they are right for some of our 
American dances - not necessarily
square.  The best way, I suppose,
would be to hear them in Washington,
if we could arrange it, but I
am not sure when that would be.
I never wrote you about borrowing
the recording machine, for the one 
who was to use it is now in the 
Navy.  Perhaps we can work
out something later, however.
With all best wishes to you 
and Mrs. Lomax,
Very sincerely,
Olive D. Campbell
