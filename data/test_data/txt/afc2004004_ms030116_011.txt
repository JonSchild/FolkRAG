wear out the patience of those that see me. I never ast anybody for anything. 
They give it to me. Sometimes I don't go out atall.  Jes stay home
an read my Bible. Some time I go out not expectin to git anything I git
mo than if I do try.
     I don't always stand around the same corner. I'm not much hand fur
standin. I'm movin bout all the time. Good many times I'm talkin bout the
Lord. People love to talk about the Lord. Some time I'm mo in the spirit
of talkin than playin.
     People think I'm independent. They say I got mo than I need. I have
not. I don't have anything. Yet I don't low nobody to interupt me when
I'm talkin. I act independent. Let people play wid you too much, they'll
think you're nothin but a play toy. Won't respect you.
     I don't like people to walk up to me an yell, "Hello, Rev. Davis!"
You know me. What you wanna call my name fur? Walk up an say, "Hello
theah. How you?" You may be in trouble. May not want anybody to know who
you are. Don't call the name. I notice that white people don't do that.
But ouwah colored people yell, "Hello Harry!. . .Hello Dick!. . ." You
may not be on no dodge, still you may not want your name called. It ain't
ettiquette. Lob-lobby. "I seen you at a party. So-an-so was theah." People
take an stir you up wid jes anybody. I don't like that. Anybody do that,
I say, "Yeah, I know you, gimme a quarter." Ask em fur money. That'll
git rid of em. There's some people I'd ruther have a dog's company.
I know what a dog will do. He'll bark sometimes. He'll lick himself
cause he ain't got no hands to wash himself. Give a dog a piece of bread
en he'll leave you alone.
     (I'd ruther fur you to take a pistol an blow my brains out, Miss
Elizabeth, than to deceive me. I got the uttermost confidence in you.)
