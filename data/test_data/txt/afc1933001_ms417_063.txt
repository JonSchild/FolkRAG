I Hate the Capitalist System

same dam thing .... because you caint fight something you hate
till you are fighting for something you love.
    I love my wife. I love my home. I love my neighbors. I
love the working folks. I love everybody in this whole wide
world. And I love them so much that I would fight the daylights
out of you if you tried to mistreat them, or rob them, or take
their groceris away from them, or cheat them, or drive them off
of their farm, or out of their house .....
    But all of that ... that's the Capitalist System. All the
same, I hate it with all my guts, and will spill them alongside
of some road somewhere, rather than --- stand like a stump-broke
heifer and be raped like a sheep --- by a man that insults the
name of Christianity by making donations to churches, and the name of
Democracy by making slaves out you if you trust him to his word,
or the name of Americanism --- which he shouts at the top of his
voice in the headlines of his newspapers, his radios, his movies,
his news reels his magazines, and his senate, and congress, and
chamber of commerce, and Business Mens Clubs, and his Preachers
who --- preach the doctrine of 'Greed' -- and for a salary from the
rich people.
    I am sure that the reason Sara Ogan hates so terrible, is
because she loves so much. When you get to where you love everybody
and everything, you get sort of like Jesus, you commence to
cry, #Woe be unto ye rich! Ye fornicators, ye money changers, ye
liars and dogs, and hypocrits, ye sissies, and sex maniacs, and
thieves ..... it would have been better for you if you'd never
have been borned.....#
    What does Sara Ogan Love that makes her Hate so terribly?
