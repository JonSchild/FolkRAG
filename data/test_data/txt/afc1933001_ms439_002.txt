Dallas, Texas.
March 27, 1935

Mr. Alan LomaX,
Dear Sir;

We hope that his will be some
service to you.

This is the best we could do. Ive
have wrote it over and over so this is
the contents.

We started it two different ways. You
can fit it to suit you. 

This is as much of that song as
my mother could think of. You will find it
on the end of one of these sheets of paper.
I am not just back to the my self yet but
I am thankful to be better.

Arthur M. Ridbitter

P.S. I hope it isn't too late.
