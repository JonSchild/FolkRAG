a storm battered cathedral at one side and 
the sea at its doors [l] somehow this is a 
brighter sea than the one that encloses
La Goave in a dull blue Carribean - a grey
eyed mulatto with a delicious smile; then
St. Luis and a glorious drive along the 
edge of the sea and straight up 
and down huge hills to [Papillon] Cavaillon in the 
dark; by this time I was too sick to 
see anything or do any but grit my teeth
& resolve not to vomit; a flat brushy
country with goats & sheep and the
houses single (as it had been ever
 since we hit Aquin) surrounded by
fences of bamboo: droves of people &
mules on the road coming from Aux
Cayes & at last on the lush plain of 
the south itself with large fine white 
& well-kept single cayes the nicest
country houses I have seen itself;
a surly young corporal of gendarmes
at Aux Cayes refused a bed & Revoli &
I staggered up [to] the road to an old
harridan's house -- Md La Port√© --
