A beauty parlor operator in St. Paul. The manager
of this establishment has a shop in the loop district.
She has about eight girls working for her. Her trade
consists of a fairly good cross-section of all types of 
women, many of whom are wives, mothers, sweethearts and 
sisters of men in service.

Two policemen in St. Paul whom I contacted promised
their assistance. I kept constantly in touch with them;
but they had nothing to report, because they said they
are not in a position to pick up the kind of material
desired.
