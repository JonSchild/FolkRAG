Since I grow quarrelsome when
she refuses me and soft when
I'm away from her too long. Yes -
today after a lot of prodding she
told me she will probably go home
for her operation. That will be
the end - and a good thing - the
relationship has every aspect of
E's except that E. loved me
more while Robin is, of course,
less neurotic. Perhaps she has
never loved me. But I have &
indeed do still love her. Her voice,
her eyes the touch of her hand,
her perceptiveness all fill me
with delight. Then with longing.
Then I stretch my hand out to
the back of the fruit & touch
a thorn. She says she is always
afraid I'll strike her. But it
never has been true. That's all gone
