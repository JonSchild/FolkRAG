No. 35

THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
COPYRIGHT OFFICE
WASHINGTON, D.C.

Steps Necessary to Secure Copyright Registration in the United States under the Act of
March 4, 1909 as amended

For works reproduced in copies for sale or distribution:

1. Publish the work with the copyright notice. The notice may be in the form "Copyright, 19___ (year date of publication) by ___ (name of copyright owner)."
The name of the copyright owner given the notice should be the true, legal name of the
person, firm, or corporation owning the copyright, and no other. The use of a fictitious or
assumed name, or the name of an person other than the copyright proprietor, may result in
the loss of the copyright protection.
Please see the back of this sheet for additional information as to the form and place of
the notice. The date in the copyright notice should agree with the year date of publication.

2. Promptly after publication,* send to the Copyright Office, two copies of the best edition
of the work, with an application for registration and a money order payable to the Register of
Copyrights for the statutory registration fee. As to special registration of photographs, see
below.
In the case of books (including pamphlets, leaflets, or single pages) which have been printed'
from type set or plates made therefrom, or by lithographic, photo-engraving, or other process,
the copies deposited must be accompanied by an affidavit, under the official seal of an officer
authorized to administer oaths, stating that the process of manufacture of the book has been
performed within the United States.
This affidavit is not required in the case of a book of foreign origin in a language or languages
other than English, nor in the case of a printed play in any language, as such works are
not required to be manufactured in the United States.
Only one copy is required to be deposited in the case of a work by an author who is a citizen
or subject of a foreign state or nation and has been published in a foreign country in a language
other than English.
In the case of contributions to periodicals send one complete copy of the periodical containing
the contribution with application and fee. No affidavit is required.

For works not reproduced in copies for sale or distribution:
Copyright also may be had of certain classes of works (see a, b, c, etc., below) of which
copies are not reproduced for sale, by filing in this Office an application for registration, with
the statutory fee of $1, sending therewith:

(a) In the case of lectures or other oral addresses, or of dramatic or musical compositions,
one complete manuscript or typewritten copy of the work.
(b) In the case of photographs not intended for general circulation, one photographic
print.
(c) In the case of works of art (paintings, drawings, sculptures) models, or designs,
or drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical character, on photograph
or other identifying reproduction of the work.
(d) In the case of motion-picture photoplays, a title and description, with one print
taken from each scene of every act.
(e) In the case of motion pictures other than photoplays, a title and description,
with not less than two prints taken from different sections of a complete motion
picture.

In the case of each of the works here noted, not reproduced in copies for sale, the law
expressly required that upon publication two complete copies of the best edition shall be deposited.
These should be accompanied by an application for registration and the statutory fee.

*The date of publication is defined in the statute as "the earliest date when copies of the first authorized
edition were placed on sale, sold or publicly distributed."
