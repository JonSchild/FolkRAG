My name is WB and I'm here this morning for the telling of the story of my life. 
My name is WB and I was born 19 & 11, the 
23d day of Dec. I lived in a one-store 
town that they called Priscilla. 
I was born on a man's place by the name of 
Coleman Brannen back in a pocurn orchard 
next to a creek. My parents were Lili 
B. My father was Tom B. We lived there 
till I was 3 year old. I used to go out in
the field when I was 3 y.o. and [ask] tell 
my mother – I didn't call her mother 
then, I called her Lili – I said Lily 
if you give me some titty I'll 
help you pick some cotton, and she 
sat down on the sack and she let 
me suck the tity. And I tell her 
[*?*] you better go and pick cause I ain't gonna 
pick no cotton, cause I'm going back to the 
house. [DL] It was kind of rough 
then, back in those [old] days, the 
food would run out and one morn 
I was hungry & I [said now] was sittin down with just for a 
napkin on – they had f.p. then 
they didn't have heaters like they 
have now, they had f.p. – and I
was sitting down on the f.p. with 
just a napkin on no shoes, no nothin' then
