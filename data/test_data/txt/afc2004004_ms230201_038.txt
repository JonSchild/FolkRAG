40.
The Kid:  I knew him, knew him well. 
Natchez:  One time it was a Negro and a white man standin' by a railroad
                 track crossing' just as you get in to town.  Standin' there
                 and talkin', you know...an' the white man was tellin' the
                 Negro what [xxxx] he wanted him to do.  Well, they was a 
                 Negro comin' drivin' a wagon with one grey mule and one white
                 mule [to} hitched to it.  So this Negro drove up to the crossin'
                 an' the railin' was kinda high there an' the wheel hit that
                 railin' an' the mules couldn' pull it over. So this Negro kep'
                 sayin, " Get up! Get up!" And the white man holler up there
                 and asked him, says, "Hey, do you know that's a white mule
                  you talkin' to." 
                  "O yassuh," This Negro say, "Get up, Mister Mule!"
(At this point Sib goes off in one of his fits of wild and wonderful
laughter. The Kid laughs and then remembers a parallel story...)
The Kid:  What about that Prince Albert tobacco?
Natchez:  I've heard of that....
The Kid:  Yeah, you couldn't go into a store down there in Mississippi
                and [xxx] say, "Gimme a can of Prince Albert." Not with that
                white man on the can. 
Natchez:  What would you say then?
The Kid:  Give me a can of Mister Prince Albert...
(Sib, who is just recovered from the last story, goes staggering 
around the room, beating the air weakly with his arms and 
shaken with a fit of crazy laughter...Finally Natchez says,
quietly)
Natchez: Yeah, man that was the way it was down there around those 
                little towns, around Gould and Dumas and Yonkepin and GoatShed,
                all down [it] in there. It was the blues.
