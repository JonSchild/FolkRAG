TL:        Did you dry it in a loft first?
BJ:        No, you don't has to; it already dry before ya pull it.  
From the field, ya know.
TL:        Oh, you let it dry right in the field?
BJ:        [Tha's right.] Well certainly.  If you don't [you can't use it.], it be ruint;  You can't use 
if it was green corn.   Period.   You [got]has to let it dry, stay 
in the field until time to pull it. . .An' it be already dry, stalk an' all.
TL:        What did you do, you took all the corn off and then you 
just put it in a barrel or something?
BJ:        Oh yeah.  We put it in big sacks.
TL:        What did you use that for?
BJ:        For plantin' again. . .For plantin' [ol']over big plantations of 
corn again, see?    At that time there weren't no corn shellers then, 
I mean around that part, but after that, they began to get ol' corn 
shellers.   [You see, then you] And they just put it in that corn sheller and have 
sumpin' under there to catch it an' when it get full, you just 
pour it in[to] your sacks, then.   Have it more easier an' quicker, 
see?   So sometimes, you ain't got a corn sheller an' I have. . .
my corn sheller go from house -- from farm to farm.   To all the 
neighbors around there, see?   He'p one another -- I mean from 
farmer to farmer, not from plantation to plantation.   But from 
farmer to farmer, all in one place, ya see?   An' so we jus' -- 
was work that way.   But huskin' corn; I have husk corn up in 
Maryland; they still doin' that, up there, hustlin' corn. . .We 
would call it home "pullin' corn."   But in Maryland they got a 
lil' knife jus' made for that purpose; jus' go to 
the corn and clip it right offa the stalk.   See?   An' we jus' 
pull with our han' at home.   But in Maryland they got lil' knives, 
[jus' made for that purpose.] call it huslin'.  Jus' [go on] run right in there and, schwit!, 
[jus'] pull it right off.   Tha's the State of Maryland.   I be up 
there a few years ago.  When I say a few years ago -- about 
12, 14.  An' Ah, take it off the cob.   In Maryland they throw it down in the fiel' an' just 
pile it an' leave it there 'cause they have so much corn there, 
in the State of Maryland, and Delaware, I see.   [Cats come up]They plants corn 
[with Deeres (? probably referring  to John Deere tractors, called
"John Deeres" in the country)] for dairies, 
an' everything else.  An' their 
hosses.  Then they have it for [sours] silos, y'know.  A mound of high 
things.  They put they food, they stuff in for they stock.  They
call it for [sours] silos.  That corn ain't quite dry in the field but that don't
