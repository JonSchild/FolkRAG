Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter of Dec. 31 was forwarded to me to New York and had to
travel back with me. Hence the delay in my reply.

The offer of Mr. David Stephens, on behalf of the Rockefeller Foundation,
is most gratifying and fills me, of course, with elation; especially
the thought that provision could be made for the support of yourself and
your research during a number of years.

I do not know whether you have been advised that, in the meantime, the
Carnegie Corporation has favorably acted upon your application, and that Dr.
Kapellmeister informed Dr. Putnam that the sum of three thousand dollars had been
voted for this project, the money to be paid through the Library of Congress.

It would seem a pity if the Carnegie grant should be lost because of the
Rockefeller offer, or vice versa. And yet it would see, necessary to ascertain
at once how high a stipend the Rockefeller Foundation would be likely
to vote and for how many years. The Carnegie grant is for one year only, at
present. It might conceivably be arranged to have the Carnegie money apply
to the inevitable needs for equipment, clerical help, and similar things,
if the Stephens offer would take care of your personal needs. I must confess
that, while it is my hope and wish to see you personally freed from all
obligations so that you can devote yourself freely and entirely to your work,
I view our project as a whole of even greater dimensions. I should like to
see the possibility of really establishing and conducting a department of
American folk-song in the Library, with possibly other workers in the field,
under your direction, exploring other regions than those in which you are
preeminently at home.

If the importance of this whole project can be sufficiently impressed
upon the authorities of the two foundations, perhaps we may obtain the means
of salvaging, at practically the last minute, much of what otherwise might
be irretrievably lost.

It would have been helpful could we have discussed these problems here;
but so long as you are not likely to be in Washington within the near future,
I shall appreciate your writing me fully what you think we better do about
the Carnegie grant and the Rockefeller offer.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music
