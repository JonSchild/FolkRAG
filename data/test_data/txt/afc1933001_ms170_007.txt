Dear Alan:
A bad laryngitis which kept me in bed for a week prevented me
from writing sooner.  I enjoyed your letter immensely mainly because
I felt that its style indicated that you had recovered your old
sweet disposition.  If staying a little longer will make you feel 
even better, by all means stay!  We shall miss you at Fenton’s
party but it is not important enough to deprive you of more rest if
you need it – and you will need it before embarking on 1941-42.
First of all let me give you the news both good and bad.  The
House passed our bill and included the $15,000 (all of it) for re-
cording but omitted the $3,200 position. The Librarian is trying to
have it inserted by the Senate.  They allowed me only two positions
($2,000 and $1,440).  If that is all we get finally, I shall recommend
that the $2,000 job, originally supposed to go to our reference section,
be assigned to the Archive.  We can then use your present position for
an assistant who can also take dictation and typewrite.  So we shall
have plenty of money for recording (over $25,000 with what we get from
the State Department) but our staff situation is only slightly improved.
At any rate, keep your fingers crossed until the Senate acts.  But
even if we lose there, I still have a few other plans which may work.
We have received so many requests for equipment that we could use
seventy instead of seven machines.  I inspected your proposals, most
of which I am ready to approve.  Some of the items mystified me, how-
ever.  I do not remember that we promised Berg twenty-five records
but we can discuss that when you return.  Furthermore, I do not like
some of the projects such as Peter Seeger’s and your trip to Arkansas.
I think that you should go to South America as soon as possible.  If
you put it off too long, you will find yourself in the equatorial
jungle in mid-summer.  Moreover, many others are going on similar
missions and I think that you should be one of the first.  In fact, we
are lending a machine to Lincoln Kirstein at the Librarian’s request.
He is leaving for South America early in June but has promised to
