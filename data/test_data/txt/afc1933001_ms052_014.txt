Dear Mr. Lomax:
  I realize full well that you should have heard from me long before
now. I plead no excuses for neglect of writing except laziness and
work. These two reasons may be contradictory, but i never studied
logic (thank God!) and so I can spout paradoxes to my heart's content.
  Now, let me try to reassure you on the Coyboy book. As you may
know, the work is all done. The melodies look good and they are certainly 
correct and singable. Before the music proof was sent back to
the publisher, I made every effort to see that the text in the printed 
page and the text under the music were in perfect agreement. And not 
long ago I received a short note from Miss Prink stating that the
Macmillan Co. realized the importance of this feature and that they, too,
were doing their utmost to eliminate all unsatisfactory complications.
At the present moment there seems to be no reason to doubt the book's
popularity and usefulness.
  By now you and Mrs. Lomax should be thoroughly acclimated Europeans.
I've often wondered whether you are glad or sorry you are not toting a
recording apparatus along. No doubt you are taking plenty of notes (at
least mental) about any music you may have heard. If you convert them
into a literary account you would catch the interest of thousands of
readers.
   I don't suppose there is any news of importance that you haven't received.
The work here continues unabated, but we have really had a banner
year. Wait till you see the Chief's report - and that before very
long.
  Lois has not been very well of late. This morning she had a operation
for mastoid infection, and before she leaves the hospital her tonsils
and adenoids must come out. So I guess she has a rather long period of
convalescence ahead of her. Otherwise, the family is all well, and even if we don't write often, we do think and speak of you often. So I hope
both of you keep on enjoying that richly earned vacation.
Best regards to Mrs. Lomax and yourself.
