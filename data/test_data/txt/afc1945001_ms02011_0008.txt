        The Research Director will develop his classification schemes for categorization
of local rumors as the program develops. Inasmuch as it is the function of analysis
to provide the basis for the educational programs it will be important for the Research
Director to work closely with the Education Director in deciding what types
of analysis would be most useful to the latter. At the same time, the Research Director
will want to analyze the material in such fashion as to give the Project Director
greatest understanding of current developments within the community. In the light of
the varied uses to which analyses will be made, it may be necessary to develop two
or three different classification schemes with the results of the different analyses
being used in different ways. At this time, no uniform classification scheme will
be suggested because of the special emphases which will develop in each community for
the local rumors. The Office of War Information will advise those Research Directors
who desire guidance in this.

        Since rumors arise out of conditions where information is not satisfactory in
the light of the needs of the people spreading the rumors, the analysis of this material
should provide the first approach to the evaluation of gaps in the over-all information
program. Information must be available in sufficient quantities to satisfy
the interest and need of the people of the community. Where interest is very high,
a given amount of information, though satisfactory for another topic where interest
is lower, might be completely unsatisfactory. Where areas of special eagerness are
revealed, the analysis of rumors should lead directly to the development of a special
program designed to blanket the field, privde the sort of information which would
clear up the breeding ground for the rumors so that the rumors will die a natural death. 
        Rumors will often reveal unsatisfactory community social conditions, calling
attention to the role they are playing in the social community and the contributions
