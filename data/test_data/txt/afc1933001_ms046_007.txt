Dear Professor McKay:

I could not rightfully claim any ownership of "Mustang Gray". The music to the other three songs you mention, even if they are in some degree folk-songs, I think can be copy-righted as has been done by my son and myself. In your case, however, we're glad to release our claim in your favor for the purpose indicated in your letter of June 10. We hope you will make reference to the source of the music, or some acknowledgment that will call the attention of your reading public to the two books from which you borrow. At best, books on folk music do not have a large sale unless they be such tunes as Casey Jones and Home on the Range, which acquired such wide appeal.

With kindest regards, I am

Sincerely yours,

Honorary Consultant and Curator
Archive of American Folk Songs
