FRIEND:
I really can't remember all of it BROTHER DAVIS say SLEEP ON, B. DAVIS, SLEEP ON.  I get this poem, see how I get it all together say There was a man, was once a man I know that didn't see --(twice or quite) a thing, The man I'm talking about B. Davis is his name. He would go around to and fro, preaching the gospel wherever he would go, telling people all about Gods------(?)

I can't think of it, because I, but then on the end where I sing, I sing so one day, something I can't understand so then I start, I sing

Sleep on B. Davis, Sleep on, Sleep on and take a rest.

Its very beautiful I tell it in front of the church. If I remember something. I told it to other people, they say that is very beautiful, say why don't you try and get somebody
to put that on to a record or something. Maybe I will. But it will only take a minute all I have to do is. Did Brother Davis know your wife?
LARRY:

FRIEND:

LARRY:

FRIEND:
