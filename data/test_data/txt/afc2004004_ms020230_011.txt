BJ:      Ah, ah, you know.
AL:     Oh, they just put them out on the beach in the sun, don't they?
BY:     Um-hum. . .They lays 'em up on the hill, an' side.  They ain' no
beach, 'cause they wasn' no beach at my home, you know.  They jus'
lay 'em up on the hillside, up aroun' [you know] them big - up [in the] there,
an' they scratch a hole.   I reckon they scratch a hold.   Anyhow,
they lay 'em jus', jus' in the dirt, little bit.   An' the thunder
what, what, what, what, ah, ah, hatches 'em.
AL:    Thunder?
BJ:     Thunder.
AL:    You'd better not come around there or the thunder will hatch 
you.
BJ:     Yeah, I bound it will, too.
AL:     If one of these female 'gators get after you. . .
BJ:     Tha's right.  Sho' will; they'll kill ya.  Um-hum.
AL:    Ow, they'll kill ya.
BJ:     Yessir.  Ah, Ah, that, that's what Paw an' them, Paw an'
them said.   When it thunder, you can hear 'em ring like bells.
Just ring, the way -- they mus' hit together, I reckon.  [They] Say jus'
ring.   An' they do that until they hatch.  Thunder hatches 'em.
          Wh-what else that thunder hatches?   Uh, it's sump-- Oh, the
turtles aigs, don't they"   Yeah.  Thunder hatches the turtle
aigs, too.   That['s] says why ya can't get 'em done.
          An' thunder hatches the guinea -- Well, guinea an' turtle 
are [kin] lil' kin, mus' be.
AL:    Yeah, I think they're kin.
BJ:     Mus' be.  Of the same family.  Um-hum.    An' ah, un, I don' know
nothin' else, though.   I don' know what hatches the snake aig.
'Cause I don' know -- but I know he lays his in the ground, too.
