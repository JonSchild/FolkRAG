RACE DISCRIMINATION-NEGROES
A. Trouble is brewing.
1. "There is going to be trouble the way this negro issue is
headed." (Alabama)
[B. In part, the trouble is due to Government action.]
2. "We are nearer race trouble in this section than we have
been since Reconstruction days." (Tennessee)
3. "At lunch the other day I heard 4 business men talking
about the race problem and they agreed that after we won
this war we'd have another civil war right here at home
to settle the Negros once and for all." Mr. Y.: "I should
say so. They say that the police are equipped with special
arms to use during blackouts in case of Negro uprisings."
Mrs. X.: "Yes, and on the other side you hear that the
Negroes are so scared of blackouts that they disappear and
barricade themselves in their houses." (Virginia)
4. "There have been uprisings among the negroes. Policeman
patrolled up and down the alley back of my friend's house
all last night. (Servant houses are built on the backs
of Dallas lots pretty generally) Texas
5. "There's a lot of talk about the Negroes. A friend of
mine called me today and said a mob of Negroes in Suffolk
have bought up all the icepicks in preparation for race
riots." (Virginia)
6. "The attitude of negroes has certainly changed. They are
defiant driving automobiles, in buses and such places. OH
yes, they stay within the law but--" (Tennessee)
7. "We're in for a change as far as the negroes are concerned 
and its going to mean blood-shed. The negroes are content,
if they were just left alone." (Tennessee)
B. In part, the trouble is due to Government action.
8. "The federal government is going to try to use negroes in
the Army to subdue the south and impose a second reconstruction
on us." (Alabama)
9. "The present administration is catering to the negro vote
and its going to cause trouble." (Tennessee)
10. "Violence is inevitable if the government insits on
stationing negro troops down here." (Alabama)
