at poor Elvirs Smith--there she slaves day after day, talking in washing and looking after those babies while that good-for-nothing Joe lazies around a pool hall in town. (Shakes head and rocks busily)

SARA.....I know it. Well, I just wouldn't stand it, if I were she. I'd just make him get out.

G'MA.....Well, It's pretty hard to say what you'd do, when you have a bunch of little children. They're just awful fond of their dad. Isn't much Elvirs can do I guess, but just keep goin'.

SARA.....That's just what I've been saying--men to get the best of everything. When I think of Tom driving into town to unconcernedly and me carrying all that water--I get so angry!

G'RA.....I know you do, ppor child. I declare it minds me of poor Lulu Jones that used to work for me. She'd get up mornings in the coldest weather and build the fires, then go out and do the milking and the chores and then come in and get the fires, then go out and do the milking--and that lazy good-for-nothing Sam a-lying in bed until breakfast was ready.

SARA.....(Slowly) WELL, of course--Tom always gets up and builds the fires and I never helps with the chores. But he should have thought of that wood and water this morning. If He'd stayed home and helped, I could have gone along to town.

G'MA.....Of course you could. But men never think of those things. I 'mind poor Lizzie Hunter. She worked like a slave on that farm and she wouldn't be in town from year's and to year's end. Rueben even bought her shoes and brought them home to her. He always got them a size or too big so they would be sure not to be too small. Bought her calico for dresses, too, the old scallywag--and a sight they were--seomtimes, too.

SARA.....How awful! Of course, Tom  ould never think of that1" Imagine him buying a pair of shoes for me. (Laughs and looks at trim foot.) But he didn't need to go without even asking if I wanted to go along. 

G'MA.....Course he didn't. You'll have to learn just to go along, whether he asks or not. My lands, my second cousin Almiry always went along to town with Lemuel. She had to, poor soul, for he'd get that drunk he would be lying in a ditch if she weren't with him. Winter or summer, rain or shine, she'd have to go. Many's the times I ve pitied her ridin' into town in a lumber wagon early on cold mornings. She darsen't trust him to take a load of hogs to town. He'd not have a cent when he got home.

SARA....Oh! Grandma, how do women bear such things? How do they? Why, I haven't anything like that. Tom doesn't drink--he isn't lazy. You know he works awfully hard to get a home. I guess I haven't much to bear when I think of those women. Only why do women--any women have to bear things like that?

G'MA.....Because they are women, dearie. And there are things that make up to them.

SARA.....What could make up to those women? Just worry and work and no lesaure at all. I hate tothink of people not having any happiness at all. What makes up to Elvira for Joe's laziness? What made up to Lulu Jones for Sam lying a-bed or to Lizzie Hunter for wearing horrid clothes and staying home slaving, or to your cousin Almira for her husband being a drunkard.

G'MA.....Well, seems as if we can all be thankful for something if we set our minds to it. And it's
