ANNC'R: No questin about it, America has always been a violent
country. Her men violent by necessity and violent
because they were feeling their democratic oats.
Her punishment of these men has been just as violent
when they stepped out of line. So in every little
county seat there's the county jail and in every
county jail there are some old boys who just ain't
been treated right. Tonight on Columbia's Back Where
I Come From, we'll step inside the stern walls of
steel and concrete to hear what stories and songs
Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Huddie Leadbetter, and
Joshua White and his singing guitar have gotten
together on the subject of the lonesome old jailhouse.

LONGING FOR FREEDOM (AND UNDER)

Sometimes because I wanted a place to sleep out of
the rain and cold and sometimes because they said I

all kinds of tales out of these jailbirds and all
kinds of singing too. (MORE)
