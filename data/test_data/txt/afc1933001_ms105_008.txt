Serious-Minded
In College, Six
Men Rise to Top

Columbia, Mo., April 10 (AP). -

The world never knew about the
Areopagus society at the University
of Missouri in 1905, but has come
to know all the members.
Six seniors, (all Phi Beta Kappa)
men, organized the society to exchange
ideas on the serious problems 
of life. All have realized the
ambitions born in those early days.
The members were Benjamin
Anderson, Merrill Otis, Wallie Hurtwitz,
Charles Williams, E. W.
Clausen, and John Kurtz.
Today the roll reads: Dr. Benjamin
Andersen, economist of the
world's largest bank, the Chase
National of New York: Federal
Judge Merill Otis of Missouri;
Prof. W. A. Hurwitz of Cornell university,
one of the greatest living
mathematicians.
Prof. Charles Williams, director
of the extension division of the
University of Missouri; Attorney
E. W. Clausen, chief of the legal
department of the Southwestern
Bell Telephone company of St.
Louis. Kurtz died eight years ago
after serving as head of the public
utilities commission of Missouri.
Andersen, Hurwitz and Williams
have international reputations. Anderson
taught at Harvard before
entering the banking field.
