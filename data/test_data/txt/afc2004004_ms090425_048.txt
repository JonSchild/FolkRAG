Sholy He Died on Calvary

Makes me sorry, think about Jesus,
Makes me sorry, think about Jesus,
Makes me sorry, think about Jesus,
Sholy he died on Calvary.

Chorus: Calvary-----,Calvary-----,
Calvary-----, Calvary----,
Calvary-----, Calvary----,
Sholy he died on Calvary.

Don't you hear the hammer ringin? . . .

Don't you you hear the saviour groanin? . . .

Can't you hear him callin his father? . . .

Makes me sorry to think about Jesus. . . . .

Makes me sorry think about dyin. . . . .
