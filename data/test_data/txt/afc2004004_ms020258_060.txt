Leader:  The rope hung him.
Player:  Where's the rope?
Leader:  The knife cut it.
Player:  Where's the knife?
Leader:  The hammer massed it.
Player:  Where's the hammer?
Leader:  It's buried 'round the old church door, and the first
             one I see his teeth, I'm gonna give him three or so
             pinches an' three licks.
     Now all the children keep their mouths tightly closed (with
hands away from face) while the Leader tries to make them laugh
so that they will show their teeth.
