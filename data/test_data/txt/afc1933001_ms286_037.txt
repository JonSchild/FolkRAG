People in a new country. A lot of adventures
and solid citizens
Working with their hands. 
Isolated by stretches of woodland, not
swamp,
Inheritance of culture -to keep or discard.
New problems, new experiences to mould 
the old stuff - to shape the new.

Democrats - each man the judge of his own
conscience, own artistic standards-
These people brot with them the pre- democratic
literature of people all over Europe.
Negroes, whites, French, Spanish, Germans-
people of all races faced with similar experiences
reacting in similar ways.
