Reverend Roe. Reel 4 - p. 4.
cross-roads, they used to call it Blackburn, and strung him up there
on the tree.
A: How old was this boy?
[*He was 13.*] 
R: He wasn't more that thirteen or fourteen years old -- long in there.
A: Well, what did the white folks say about that--you must have heard
them talk about it--what did they say they did that for?
[*Keep the nigger down.*] 
R: To keep the nigger down. Let him know he couldn't play with white
children. That's about all I know.
A: And tell me, Reverend, what did the Negroes say among themselves
about this kind of a thing?
[*God will make a way someday.*]
R: Well, they get among themselves and talk about how bad it was, but
they said, "God will make a way some day." About all we could say.
[*The boy's father was watched.*]
A: Didn't this boy's father want to go and do something about this?
R: Oh yeah, but they'da watch him; why, if he'da just grunted, they
would have tiven him the same medicine -- if they'da heard him grunt.
After they do that, and they'd come and get you -- come to the colored
folks'es house, you know, and tell you, "I come after your wife to
work for me, wash for me today." And if she didn't feel like it, why
she had to go. It was that way with most all of the renters and things
like that, you know. Now after you got a place of your own, maybe,
they wouldn't be quite as bad. But I tell you, you sure had to walk
straight. It was all right as long as you worked for the white folks
and didn't bother no white person, didn't do nothing against them.
But if they come after you to work for um, you have to go.
[*Resistance? Resignation?*]
A: I don't see how'd you ever get over that feeling, Reverend, if it
happened to you once in your life -- if you'd seen those things, I
don't see how'd you'd ever get shut of the feeling.
R: Well, as you say, it goes with you a long time and it's might deep-
seated, but when a man comes to be a real Christian, borther, he'll
get out of it. You know, it'll all leave you. The Bible tells you
