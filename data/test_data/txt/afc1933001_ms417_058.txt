HARRY SIMMS
Harry Simms, 19 year old organizer for the National Miners Union, murdered by a thug of the Southeastern Kentu ky coal companies.
Harry Simms and Green Lawson, a union member, were walking up the railroad track to Gatliff where they were going to collect a group of Brush Creek miners and march down to Pineville to welcome a delegation of writers, Mary Vorse, Waldo Frank, etc. Arlin Miller and Red Davis, gun thugs, passed the boys ona gasoline track care (there was no road.) They stopped the car, backed it up to where the boysstood. Miller drew his gun, shot simms in the stomach. Davis covered Lawson, then searched him and found a 45 automatic. Both boys were put in the track car and taken to Barboursville, 8 miles away. Lawson was clapped into jail. Harry simms sat on a roc outside the Bardoursvill hospital with a bullet in this stomach for an hour because no one could be found to stand his hospital bill. Finally the father of Red Davis agreed to pay it. Simms was operated on but it was too late. He died shortly afterwards.
