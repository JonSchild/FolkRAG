Mr. Thomas H. Benton
3616 Belleview Ave. 
Kansas City, Mo. 

Dear Mr. Benton:

I am glad to hear about the work you 
are doing for Decca, and I will write to 
Jack Kapp for a couple of pressings of the 
songs, and I'd like to hear your new
ones when they are done. 

About the Ozark trip, we have a
recording machine in Galena, Missouri, in
the hands of Vance Randolph, and perhaps
he'd be able to record your fiddlers for 
us if they are somewhere near him.  Let 
me know if that sounds like a possibility. 

It would be swell to see you if you 
ever get to Washington, and the Seegers 
feel the same way about this.  Thanks for 
writing. 

Sincerely yours, 

Alan Lomax
