1572 —   Dyin' Mercy Blues — Tampa Red
                 a very pretty guitar solo
1588 —    Frankie Jean
                  about a horse she had when
                  she was young —
                  interesting talking piece.
1591 —    Tell Me What Kind of Man Jesus Is
                  sanctified record, quite good.
                  When I Lay Burden Down — ok.
1619 — swell guitar solo.
