Cajun Tunes

(We are now at work in the Cajun country, a region that
extends roughly from the border of Texas to the Mississippi
through the extreme southern part of Louisiana along
the old Spanish trail. It was settled, as sentimentally
recorded in Longfellow's "Evangeline", by the French refugees 
from Acadia [in] or Nova Scotia in Canada. They have
preserved remarkably untouched until the present generation 
of school children their own dialects, customs and
music. The music that is played at dances in this country,
usually by a fiddle, guitar and accordion band is quite
remarkable and most certainly indigenous. Some of the best
of it has been recorded by Victor and Columbia in the last
five years and these records have sold well both in their
own country and in Canada. Since all the native bands
have become money-conscious, no matter how bad they may be,
and since they think we are trying to make records of their
playing for commercial purposes, since the best of it has 
been recorded, we have neglected the accordion orchestras. )

Instead we have interested ourselves more in the French ballad
survivals and the lyrics indigenous to the country.

One ballad of the whore-house with a fine melody,

Twenty-four French ballads and Cajun lyrics which are at
present being transcribed by a folk-lorist acquainted with the
dialect of the region.

Four fiddle tunes, two square-dances, one mazurka and on [walt] 
waltz.

Two tunes played by the St. Martinsville band (the town 
where Evangeline is buried), which plays entirely by ear.
(We would like to remark here that the recording of this
band, more a test of our new recording outfit than anything
else, made in the open streets, with a large crowd of onlookers,
was entirely satisfactory, whereas previous attempts
with our discarded Garwick set had been just the reverse.)
