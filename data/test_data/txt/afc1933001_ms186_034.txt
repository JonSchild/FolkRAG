Galena, Mo.
Sept. 24, 1942

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I don't know the Miss Gertie [*write*] Colvin mentioned in
your letter of Sept. 16, but I'd like to record the
ballads she has found. I am broke now, however, and can't
go to Versailles, Mo., unless somebody pays my expenses.
If Miss Colvin can come to Galena, I'll show her how to 
run the machine and turn it over to her, or I'll send the
machine to her by express, or whatever you think best. 

Since I have been rejected by all the armed forces
and the Army Specialist Corps, it appears that I shall be 
free to do as I like next year. I'd rather collect folksongs
than anything else. If you can get me a $1500 fellowship
I'll cover the whole Ozark area, and do a job that will
make their eyes stick out.

Sincerely yours,

Vance Randolph [*write about status of project*]
