Dear Carlton, 
I gave your rather rabbitty Mr. Glazer
enough records to listen to.  He was quite secretive 
about his paper and about his conclusions.  Even about 
his conclusions about the records.  I was busy and 
so saw little of him
Last week I suggest to Chas. Todd and 
Robert Sonkin of CCNY, good recordists and speech men,
that they try their hand at a survey of minority 
music in NYC, since no one else seemed to be working 
on it but Mitchell and he mighty slowly.  The people 
were there to advise -- Cow ell, who knows the music
and the problems and the NYC field for it and transcribes 
like a whiz-- Sachs who knows the instruments -- yourself 
looking for singers and anxious to push folk-song.
New Yoek is a rare field and I should
think money was to be had if you really went to 
twon to get it.  We could furnish blanks and equipment and 
backing would be easy to find.  Like to hear what you 
think.  Might begin with Latin-American survivals in NYC?
Let me know when I can be of help about 
the program. To tell you the truth I was a little 
miffed at the rush way you suggested that we work it 
out last week.

Best regards,
Alan Lomax
