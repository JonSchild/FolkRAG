[List of] American Folk Songs on Commercial Records
[Compiled by Alan Lomax]

After listening to three thousand odd commercial
records of white and negro songs and tunes from the
South, [I have] Alan Lomax compiled this list of three hundred and
fifty representative titles. [in order that the interested
musician or student of American society may explore this
unknown body of Americana with readiness.]  They represent his personal choices of the material made available to him.  The choices
have been personal and have been made for all sorts of
reasons.  Some of the records are interesting for their
complete authenticity of performance; some for their
melodies; some because they included texts of important
or representative songs; some because they represented
typical contemporary deviations from rural singing and playing
styles of fifty years ago; some to make the list as
nearly as possible typical of the material I examined.  I
feel sure that I have heard only a quarter of the interesting
records; for example I was able nowhere to find a large
group of Okehs or Gennetts to audition.  Many records have
been passed over because at times the auditioning process
has had to be hurried.  But I have come away from this
listening experience with the certainty that american
folk music, while certain folklore specialists have been
mourning its decline, has been growing in new directions
to compete with "thick" commercial music, and that it is
today in its most "distorted" form in a healthier condition,
roving the radio stations and recording studios
than it has been or ever will be in the notebooks of
collectors.  No better indication of this can be found
than in the scores of contemporary ballads and songs,
some of them songs of protest, that can be found in this
list.

Many of these records are out of print.  It seems
to be impossible in the present state of confusion that
exists in the files of commercial recording companies to
say which records are in print and which are not.  As a
general rule the most modern records are the easiest to
obtain.  [I will deeply appreciate] He will welcome any suggestions for or
additions to this preliminary list.
