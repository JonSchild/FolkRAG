So she dressed herself up all in that her best,
And her pockets had been well lined with gold,
You should see her trudge the streets, with a tear all in her eye,
She was searching for her jolly sailor bold, sailor bold,
She was searching for her jolly sailor bold.

So the first that she met was a jolly sailor bold,
"Have you seen my pretty ploughing boy?" she cried;
"He's just across the deep and he's sailing for the fleet,
And he said, "My pretty maid, will you write, will you write?"
And he said, "My pretty maid, will you write?"

So she sailed till she came to the ship her love was in,
An' unto the captain did complain.
She said, "I'm come in search for my pretty ploughing boy
Who was sent into the wars to be slain, to be slain,
Who was sent into the wars to be slain."

So five hundred bright guineas she then did lay down,
An' so freely she told them all o'er,
Until she got her pretty plough boy all in her arm
An' she hugged till she got him safe on shore, safe on shore,
An' she hugged him till she got him safe on shore.

She set those bells to ring and so sweetly she did sing,
Just because she'd saved the lad that she adored, she adore,
Just because she'd saved the lad that she adored.

Lomax: Have a drink on that one. That's a beautiful song,
wonderful song.
Kennedy: Don't you have another verse to that Harry?
Happy is the day when all true lovers meet,
And their sorrows and their cares are all o'er,
But cursed are the wars that send many a lad to sea,
And their true loves never see them any more.
Cox: I have heard it. I have heard that before off somebody, now
you mention it.
Kennedy: I thought you sung that.
Cox: No, I don't know that.
Lomax: Harry, what war is this that they're referring to in the
song?
Cox: What, this here, what you want to talk about?
