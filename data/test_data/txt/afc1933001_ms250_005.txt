Dear Alan: Thank you for your
penciled letter. If Nicholas
Rey had felt any proper regard for
you he would not have taught copyrighted
material to anyone for [pirate?]
up until they had cleared it
with you. The situation, as I
see it, is precisely of a piece
with the Burl Ives incident. It's
all right for your friends to
steal. In both instances I wish
you to realize that they are
stealing principally from
you. I wont be around much
longer. If you are willing
