Norfolk, Va., August 8,  1942

Mr. Y, resident of Norfolk: "At lunch the other day I heard 4
business men talking about the race problem and they agreed that after
we won this war we'd have another civil war right here at home to settle
the Negroes once and for all." [*69*]

Question: "Is there a lot of talk like that going on?"

Mr. Y: "I should say so. They say that the police are equipped
with special arms to use during blackouts in case of Negro uprisings."

Mrs. X: "Yes, and on the other side you hear that the Negroes
are so scared of blackouts that they disappear and barricade themselves
in their houses." [*69*]
