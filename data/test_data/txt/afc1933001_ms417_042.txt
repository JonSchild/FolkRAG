NO MORE MOURNIN'
No more mournin', no more mournin',
No more mournin' after while, 
And before I'll be a slave, 
I'll be buried in my grave, 
Take my place with those who loved and fought before.
No more cryin', no more cryin',
No more cryin' after while, 
And before 'll be a slave,
I'll be buried in my grave,
Take my place with those who loved and fought before.
