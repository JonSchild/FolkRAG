TAPE: R 83 cont. 7

singing, you can't use music with, on account of your chords
don't correspond with your playing and all--it's just all
together different. But I tell you, if you ever go to one of
'em, you won't never have to be asked to go to another. Those
people travel, I'd say, 500 miles to come to 'em. ......We
have one of 'em, where Ernest is talking about, at Riverside,
Pilgrim Rest Church ou there, they had one last Sunday. That
church is an old log church that's in the reservation over there.
And I don't know whether they have any denomination in this
Sacred Harp singing or not 'cause everybody and his brother
comes to 'em.... regardless of what church they attend, when
they have A Sacred Harp singing, they all pile in there......
some of my fondest memories is around Sacred Harp...and
they'd sing it and play it and have all day eating around...
I enjoy it.

AL: You know a song about it?

Doodle: Well, this here is one that is more or less of a made
up thing. Us kids, when we was real young, mother and daddy'd
take us to church, you know kids back then, they down there
behind the church, they never went in the church. There wasn't
room for us and we didn't know the songs either and we got to
listen to them and I made me up a little ole song, and Terry
Bell, I think was the first one I ever heard do it, but I learned
part of it from..........something similar to it. (he plays).

And sings a wonderful take off on S.H. singing about the Fourth of July.
Verse: Says my rooster is a crowing and my taters is a growing and my cotton I done laid it by.
Well then ain't a bit of telling, I could have a watermelon, gonna cut it on the Fourth of July.
Then does so-fa -- funny END OF TAPE
