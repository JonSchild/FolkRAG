3/IV
night when they went out they prayed for the devil, they
prayed and believed in him.  They thought he was a god, he was
a god, he was a god, he was a goddle, a goddle, and they
thought that the devil was more powerful than...than god was
himself.  And they went out.  It's about 100 years ago, close
on a hundred, about 70 to 80...100 years ago that 
this took place.  And they...they thought that the devil was
more powerful and they believed what he said, what he said to
them was more handy and powerful than shat the goddle was...

(Jimmy are there any haunted houses round your home town?)
Yes, and when it went up...and when the devil he appeared to 
them the next day, they next day he appeared, no he appeared to
them in the afternoon, in broad daylight, in broad daylight
on the top of the hill, a place called Langies Brays, Langies 
Brays, Langside hill, and said, he shouted and he put his 
arms right around and this hill looked down on
the top of Portsoy, called Langies Brays, and he cries "Bonny
Portsoy you're all my ain," And he put out his arms right
round...he put his arms right round all the hale toon, right
round...the devil put his airms right round the hill toon, he says
"Bonny Portsoy, you're all my sin."  Me put his airms right
round the whole toon.  An awful sight, his arms going right
round the whole village, and he says, "Bonny Portsoy, you're
all my ain" And he vanished right out of sight.  The devil
appeared to them and that was quite true and I believe that
it happened right enough.  They talk about it long thse brays,
Longside Brays or Longside Hill.  They call it Langies, Brays
