AL: Andyoutaught this one to your daughter? What's the
name of it?
Phyllis: I've always called it the devil and the farmer song.
(SHE SINGS)
There was an old man and he lived nearhell
Rum tum tiddly day*   [**this line repeat every verse*]
And he had an old wife and she whipped him well
Rum tum a tiddle tum a tiddly day**
The old devil came into him one day
Said one ofyour family I'm taking away.**
Please don't take my oldest son
There's work on the farm and it must be done
Cat around to the gates of hell
Said stoke up the fire, we'll scorch her well
Two little devils come with a ball and a chain
She kicked back her foot and knowcked out their brains
Three little devils sitting on a wall
Said take her back daddy, she'll murder us all
Old devil wagon cross the hill
Said if the devil don't have her I'll be damned if I will
Just come to show you what a woman can do
She'll whip out the devil and her old man too
Old man a walking cross the hill
Said the devil won't have her I'll be damned if I will

Nimrod: .....a big crowd of us, nineteen.....oh the house,
we had two, built separate out of logs. One was four rooms,
the other was 3 rooms, had a big kitchen, and we had a fireplace
that was about 7 foot wide, and it had a big iron
rack across it, and had hooks on it to hang your kettles on
it for cooking, and the kettles was on kettles.(?)
