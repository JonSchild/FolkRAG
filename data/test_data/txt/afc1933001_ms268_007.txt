Colonel I. Spalding
Chief, Miscellaneous Branch
War Department General Staff, G-1
Washington, D.C. 

Dear Colonel Spalding:

     General Devers has asked me to forward you the
songs requested in your letter of February 6th. I am enclosing
two songs with music which are used by the 41st
Engineers (colored) and the words of two songs which
are sung by two individual soldiers in the 9th Division.
Neither of these men are able to write music, and neither
knew what tune their songs are sung to. The soldier
who sings the song about the Irishman sang it on a radio
program which the National Broadcasting Company staged
here. Before the National Broadcasting Company allowed
him to sing it they carefully checked with their New
York office to determine whether or not the words of
this song were sung to a tune which had been 
copyrighted. They were unable to do so.

     If more time were available it might be
possible to have a band leader write the music for
this song. There is not now time to accomplish this
and have the song reach you by February 12th.

                      Sincerely yours,

                                            {Eugene L Harrison}
                                             EUGENE L. HARRISON,
                                             Major, (Cav) ADC.
