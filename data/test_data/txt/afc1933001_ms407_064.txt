[?] of 
George Lyman Kittredge
Harvard 

Childe Allen 
(A very ancient ballad, never before published, and 
in a very fragmentary condition). 

How two Harvard students 

1
It fell upon a Wednesday night 
When the leaves were budding fain, 
That two young clerks of Cambridge town 
Were walking all alane. 

make plans for an evening 

2
"O shall we to our bukes, Willie, 
As fast as we can gang, 
Or shall we awa to Little Copeland
Wha reads the lads amang?" 

and decide to seek one G.Lyman Kittredge 
3
"We wilna gang to our bukes, Willie, 
Nor yet to little Copeland
We maun awa' to Sir Lyman's Ha' 
By Sir Lyman's ain command." 

They arrive 
4 
And when they come to Lyman's Ha' 
They tirled at the pin 
x x  x   x    x    x 
x    x   x 

and enjoy with others their patron's hospitality 
5 
And some they pulled at the weeds sae brown
And some at the white weeds sma' 
And all the tune that bonnie bird knew, 
"Childe Allen tarries lang." 

An envious voice imputes this absence to unseemly revelry. 
7
Then up and spake the youngest clerk
Sat a Sir Lyman's knee, 
"Childe Allen's drinking the blue-red wine 
In the Dunster Hostelrie.
