I have read the two letters from Miss Thelma James
with interest but regret that I do not believe the Library
can initiate any project in this matter. Miss James'
project has a connection with the war effort but this
is an indirect one and I feel that the Library should
initiate only those projects which have a direct relationship. 
On the other hand, I suggest that you hold
this correspondence until you become attached to the
Office of War Information. Then refer the matter to
Mr.  Nordholm, who is in charge of the recreation work
for the Joint Management Labor Committees in the war
plants for the War Production Board. If the War Production
Board were to ask us to take a hand in this
matter, it would make all the difference in the world.

Respectfully,
