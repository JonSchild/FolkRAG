Dear Sol:

A pause in the field work permits me to answer yours of the 24th.  I can't do
anything until I return in August about providing the theoretical conclusions so 
far derivabll[ee] from the paper.  It would take I think about another 40 pages to
survey what I have found out so far from this coding system. Can you wear an article
this long with a sixable number of diagrams.

I should also like to know about how long it would take to get the article
published once you had all the material in your hands.

In answer th your readers question, Columbia was enthusiatic about the possibilities
of the coding system because it has to do with general aesthetic and emotive patterns.
It indicates the persistence and power of these patterns operating through time 
and space. If you'll let me know the answer to my questions I'll get don to work as
soon as possible upon my return.

Yours sincerely,



Alan Lomax
