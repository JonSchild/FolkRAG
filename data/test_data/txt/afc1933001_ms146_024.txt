Dear Mr. Taylor:

It has occurred to me that the outlines I have
sent might have seemed a little vague on the score
of suggested titles of songs, etc.  The reason for
this omission was that I wanted to make the outlines
as brief as possible, and I saw no particular point
in making final or semi-final decisions about the
songs until the material for the broadcast was
finally decided upon.  Naturally, too, the programs
were only a selection out of a large group of possible
programs, and if there is material in which you are
interested which is not included, please let me know.

In outlining the two series that I did, I 
avoided a great deal of contemporary social documentation
which someday I hope the songs will be given
over the air.  As I told you, my experience in
collecting has been with poor farmers, workers, etc.,
in the main.  It would perhaps, be interesting to
emphasize this contemporary background on the programs
and use more social documentation than I first
suggested.  I should have discussed this problem with
you before I left New York, but it had not occurred to
me then. 
I hope to hear from you within the next tow or three 
days.

Very sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
