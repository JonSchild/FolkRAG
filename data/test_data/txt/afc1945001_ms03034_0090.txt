Dear Dr. Allport:
Wilma Shannon has passed on to me your excellent critique of our recent rumor paper, with which it is hardly possible to take exceptions. 
I feel certain that all of us will be able to do a better job next time as a result of your suggestions.

Sincerely yours,
Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
