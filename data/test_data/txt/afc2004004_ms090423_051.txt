Attitude Toward the Enlightenment of the Negro: and 
Hopes for Child 

The town, the radio, newspapers, awareness of their plight, 
and the larger worlds of experience create within some plantation 
people a more ambitious perspective in so far as race consciousness, 
education, and hope for the future. One informant says, 
"Us colored folks just now really getting the light. The farm 
bureaus give information concerning raising our own food stuff, 
hogs, cows, and talking about the "living at home plan". And 
another thing they come out and give pitcher shows at the church, 
and come to your house and can your meat for you in tin cans. Now   
the colored person got a chance. The daylight just been turned on. 
What we got to do now is git us something of our own."

The plantation people are becoming increasingly interested in 
the education of their children. "I learned long time ago the 
vantage of education. I ain't got but one child; that's the main 
reason I ain't got no more, cause I'm going to see her in school. 
Naw sir, I don't even include her in my crop. I wants her to make 
the 12th grade and I'se taking out insurance for her to go off to 
college."
