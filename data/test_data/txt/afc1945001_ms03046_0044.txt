"RUMORS RELATED TO THE WAR EFFORT"

I. Rumors heard between August 3 and August 8, 1942:

A. Rumor No. 1 was heard twice in Oklahoma City on August 3 and
August 4, 1942; both versions essentially the same.
1. "Did you know that these Defense Bonds we are being asked to
buy are not going to be paid back in cash in ten years?
They're really going to be refunded at a lower rate of
interest."

B. Rumor No. 2 was heard in Oklahoma City, August 3 and August 5,
1942.
1. (First version) "A fellow told me that anybody that had
$100.00 didn't have to go without tires, and you wouldn't 
have to buy stolen tires either. The fellow said that most
of these tire dealers just put new tires on their own cars
making used tires out of them, and then they could get their
own price for the used tire."
2. (Second version) "It's pitiful the way they're getting around

there's plenty of deals that are legal because they can sell
