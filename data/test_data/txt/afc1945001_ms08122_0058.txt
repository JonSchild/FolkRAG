     There was a company of
soldiers out on manovers and the
sagent went out into the woods.
There was no one there but bushes
trees and logs. He cried out attention
and all the bushes trees and logs
got up and stood at attention.

     There was a German Aircraft
Carrier out at sea and while the
airplanes were out on manovers
American Bombers sank it, while
half of it was sticking out of the
water a german airplane came by
and the radio operator to the
pilot to land because he heard
it was only a rumor.
