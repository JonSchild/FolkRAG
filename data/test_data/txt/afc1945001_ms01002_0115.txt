e. Other possible means of securing rumors include Columbia
Broadcasting System Station Managers, the local Committees 
of the War Bond Drive, the Regional Directors of the Social
Security Board (each of whom has a staff of from 25 - 150
and has already signified a desire to cooperate in such an
undertaking) etc. etc.


B. An Analysis of the Rumor Content of the Axis Short-Wave.

This would be a compilation (by the Enemy Sources Section)
of all material on the subject of gas and rubber rationing
which has been transmitted through the Axis short-wave. Spe-
cial emphasis will be placed on radio station "Debunk" which
is the principal source of Axis inspired rumors.

This study will furnish us with occasional insight into the 
process of rumor birth. In addition, it may substantiate
the hypothesis that most Axis short-wave rumors originate 
with domestic sources and are merely selected by Axis prop-
agandists for use by their U. S. agents.

C. An Analysis of Authoritative and Miscellaneous Statements on
the Subject of Gas and Rubber Rationing.

This would be a compilation, including a quantitative and 
qualitative analysis, (by the Domestic Sources and Miscel-
laneous Sources Sections) of all statements on the subject.
This would show which phases of the subject had been in-
adequately dealt with or not dealt with at all. It would
highlight conflicting and confusing pronouncements.

D. An Analysis of the Standard Media (Press, Radio, Magazine, and
Film) for Rumor Content.

The Media Division would compile all rumor-bred items on the
subject transmitted through press, radio, or file. This col-
lecting will parallel that of the orally transmitted rumors 
(see "A" above).

It will test the hypothesis that the standard media (and those
who control them) serve not alone as the end-point of full-
grown rumors but also as the birthplace of new ones.
