                                                    down on the Cherokee who by the way
                                                     were,  in a way lots more civilised
                                                     than they were in many ways.

                                                      The Cherokee lived in towns and
                                                      they had a central government, they
                                                       even had a feminine parliament and
                                                      they were, had a, the Cherokees also
                                                       were extremely accomplished military
                                                       people so they were hard to defeat
                                                       but the pioneers outnumbered and
                                                       outgunned them and they burned the
                                                        farms, threw children into the
                                                       blazing fires, they killed every man
                                                        they could find and sold many of the
                                                        young people and the women off to
                                                        slavery so the Cherokee power was
                                                        forever broken and the hands of the
                                                        pioneers were forever bloody and
                                                        they remembered that although, and
                                                         it bit deeply into their conscience.
                                                         Well I am sort of wandering now, but
                                                          anyway we got him into the . . .

MAN                                                Oh they brought some fiddles with
                                                         them of course but they weren't
                                                         nearly as common as we had an idea
