and bass and snare drums - bout 7 or 8 pieces would be all we'd have.
And, boy, talkin bout noise.  You never heard no 60 piece band make
as much noise as those few guys could make.
Q.  What would you play?
M.  Sometimes I'd be playing trombone - sometimes bass or very seldom snare
drums, because we had a pretty tough guy round New Orleans - Joe White.
He'd always be playing snare drums and he was a good Snare drum player.
So I'd always be playing one or the other.
     And, of course, everytime when we'd get a few blocks we'd get plenty
to drink.  I didn't care so much for the drinking part.  No, I didn't,
but I did like to see the way the boys act - beat up the horses - 
get drunk and say "I can pick up the horse" and grab his front legs
and hold him up and all that kind of a stuff and the girls would
be waiting for us to pass their doors and give a general hurrah and
everything like that - why, it would be really a swell time.  And
we had fun - a kind of a fun I don't think I've ever seen anyother
place.  'Course there may be as nice a fun, but that particular kind, there
was never that kind of fun anyplace, I thinks, on the face
of the globe, but New Orleans.  And we had that every Sunday, so we had
mostly a job every Sunday.  And sometimes the big leaders would get a 
job - fellows like Manuel Perez or Buddy Bolder or some of these
fellows - When they'd find out, it would be a battle of music on the 
street.  I'll dare say that the first time a battle of music was ever
waged was in New Orleans in those parades.
