Federal Writers Project,
Indianapolis, Ind..

Dear Mr. Myers,

I take this opportunity to thank you and the Federal
Writers Project of Indiana for the interesting sheaf of
folk songs you have sent to the Archive of American Folk
Song. It will be added to our Indiana File.

The foreign groups you speak of In Indianapolis interest
me very much and , if I have the opportunity, I will come to
Indianapolis to interview them on my way back to Washington
in October.

Thanking you again for your many courtesies, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
