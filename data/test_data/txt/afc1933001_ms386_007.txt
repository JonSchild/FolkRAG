Roscoe McLean, who [san] hollered
this "holler" and contributed other
lovely folk songs to the Folk
Song Archive, for more than a 
year has been in the tuberculosis
ward of the Florida
Penitentiary. Recently I talked
with Roscoe - he could only
whisper as he peered through the 
woven-wire netting, sobbing his
despair. [Roscoe] He will never sing
again. Soon he will join Allen
Prothero in, we hope, a happier existence, and with him sing
and join him in singing
"Pauline" and "Jumpin' Judy"
