tion and accumulation for the period amounts to $2,236,177.46, or an 
amount equal to practically one-half the 1928 obligations and to only 
$337,822.58 less than the total obligations of the district as of 
October 1, 1942.

During this period, 1928-1941, the Board was compelled, in 
order to carry out its obligations under the terms of the Flood 
Control Act of 1928, to expend for rights-of-way and costs incidental 
thereto more than $1,000,000.00 and in addition has put and kept the 
levee in an excellent state of repair.

Also through judicious and timely refunding of callable issues 
the average interest rate on current obligations has been substantially 
reduced.

The average interest rate on the bonded obligation in 1928 
was 4.59.  The average rate on present outstanding bonds is 4.07 
per cent.

The reduction in the tax rate too may well be mentioned.

At the beginning of this period the advalorem rate was, for 
the counties of DeSoto, Tunica and Coahoma, 7.50 mills and for the 
back counties of the district 5.36 mills.  The acreage tax was 3.60 
cents per acre.

The present tax rate is, for the front counties, 3.74 mills 
and for the back counties 2.67 mills.  The acreage tax has been reduced 
to the minimum allowable, 2 cents per acre.

It may also be noted that the assessed valuation of the 
district has been substantially reduced during this period.

It is of course probable that some further reduction in the 
rate may be made from time to time, as the demands for rights-of-way 
and other obligations lessen, but it must be remembered that maturities 
of practically $177,000.00 per year and the coupon interest must be 
met through the next 14 years, or until 1955, as shown by the tabulation 
in your financial report.
