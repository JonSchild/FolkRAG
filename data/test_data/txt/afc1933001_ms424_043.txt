EVENING

(Page 7 - Bryn Mawr Song Book)


Evening is calling the birds to their shelter
Each poises on out-stretched wing,
While Nature is hushed, with our hearts deepest feeling
To you, Bryn Mawr we sing.


The sun is departing spreads gold thine own color
Across the whole glimmering west,
Though thousands pursue the bright glitter of riches,
Bryn Mawr, thy gold is the best.


YOUTH
(Manuscript)

(Obtainable Affiliated Schools for Workers, Price .5Â¢)


Myths of the past
Have lost their power,
Time flying fast
Brings a new hour.
Nations despairing
Need a new creed,
Seeking and sharing
Youth, youth must lead.
