3. 
Ring-a dat big bell -
In Ab'ham's breas' at las'.
(Chorus)

Some of the Negroes' best poetry in his spirituals is embodied in single lines of stanzas:
Did you ever hear de hammer ring
Did you ever hear de hammer ring
Did you ever hear de hammer ring
When dey nailed poh Jesus down?
Chill'n dey nailed poh Jesus down.
Dere's a silver spade for to dig my grave
An' a golden chain for to let me down
Don't you hear de trumpet sound?
In de mornin'.
Seven stars in his right hand
Save me from sinking down
All stars move at his command
Save me from sinking down.
Oh, he call you by de lightnin'
And he call you by de tunder,
And he call you by de middle night cry.
Oh, come home, come home, come home my fader's children;
Come home, come home - an' he ain't got weary yet.
De Lord has been here an' love come tricklin' down,
My Lord God-ermighty come a steppin' down,
Come a-steppin' down on a sea ob glass.
Dere's a long white robe in heaven for me
No more sunshine fer to bu'n you; no more rain
Fer to wet you.
Ev'y day will be Sunday in heaven.
Sweet music in heaven jes beginnin' to roll,
Goin' feast off'n milk and honey.
My feet got wet in de midnight dew,
An' de mornin' star was a witness, too.
If you doan b'leave I bin redeem,
Jes follow me down de Jordan stream.
I went down in de valley to pray,
My soul got happy an' I stayed all day.
