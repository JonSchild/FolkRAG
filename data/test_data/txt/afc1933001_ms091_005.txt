Judith said "a steam of men
were in to see him Sat, Sun &
Monday" and he had not had a
chance to get well - I phoned
that night & talked to all of
them - one at a time, even
Judy, and John was better.
I'm advertising my one vacant
room for six [?] & staying
close at home - Very
few have some by - my
couple want be here but one
month and Sun anxious to rent
the one that is vacant.
He heard Alan. I'm glad
you told me. Mrs Blair heard
him & phoned me to listen
in. I sent your letter to John
& wrote Sue. I enjoyed his
praguous & don't want to miss
one - I talked to Miss Parker
at the University the other day.
You can easily tell there have
been many students who have
gone to war or schools elsewhere.
Much love, 
Alice Pedigo
