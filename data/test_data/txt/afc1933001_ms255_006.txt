[Hunduo?] dance - Where a tall man dances
around until he gets down as low as a baby
I went one night to se 'em [?] "scamping"
but I got scared and never [went] did go back.

Song of the Rice Field
Joseph Hickman

Eh In de country [where] I was born  (3)
Oh Rice was my native home

" I plant the rice within the groun'
  An' de rice growed up in time

I water de rice, I water it by night
An' de rice did grown by de moonlight

When de rice grow it grow by night
When [de] I water de rice, de rice looks nice.

When I [go to] cut dat rice, I'se cut it at night
Rice got dry an' I tied it up.
