Tape:   Sacred Harp Interviews   5

That was the kind of teacher he was.

AL:    Punishment for children was pretty severe in those times, 
wasn't it?

Chester:    It was, if the crime was pretty heavy, it was a 
heavy hickory whip.  Yes, I've had it myself, several times.

Chester:  I was mean in school.  When I was in school, I 
was just as mischievous as I could be, but I'm glad I grew 
out of that. . . . .  I deserved them.   I deserved every one I 
ever got.  I got plenty of them from my daddy, too.

AL:    When you're singing Sacred Harp songs, what do you 
mostly be thinking about?   Some of the songs are very sad 
and melancholy and lots of memories come up.

Chester:    Oh yes,  Welll, when I'm singing a song, a lot of 
times, the words mean so much to me.   I get a lot of joy 
out of that.  And a lot of time, the harmony, if you got 
good harmony, and the words can pile together--oh, it 
does something to you, make you enjoy living.

AL:    Have you ever been to a colored folks meeting and heard 
them sing spirituals?

Chester:    I have been to two kinds of black people's church.  
One of them was the Holiness, and they didn't sing SH; then 
I went to an old time Baptist, and they sang SH; just like 
we do.

AL:    What do you [sing] think of black people's singing?
