"Sure, Japan was supposed to be weak. Her ships were all
supposed to be top-heavy, but we found out. You can't bluff a Jap. You can
lick him, but you can't bluff him. The only way to do is knock him down a
couple of times and then bluff him, but don't try to bluff him first. You
can't bluff a Mexican either, or a Greek. Japan has got the ships and the
planes and we built them -- with our scrap-iron. And she's got the men to
run them, and you can't bluff 'em." Salt Lake City 8-6 21
