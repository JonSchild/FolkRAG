So come all you women in Barningham,
And listen unto me,
And don't you spend your money aways
While your husband is on the sea, boys, sea,
When your husband is on the sea.
Lomax: I bet the women didn't like that one, Harry. They sang it in
the pubs, didn't they...?
Cox: I didn't care a lot about it, but I heard it sometimes. They
did hear it when we got started, whether they like that or not, they
heard it.
Lomax: But I didn't think women ever wore horns. You said in the
song...
Cox: I - yeah, I know. I don't understand what is is...
Lomax: You think it's strange, do you?
Cox: Yeah. I don't - that was made up right, I suppose. I dunno. .
Lomax: You must have another one or so like that, Harry - kind of a
little juicy - a little racy.
Cox: (mumble)
Lomax: ...we have only a French lady in there, you can sing anything
you like.
Cox: I do - I do know...my songs, they're rough songs, some of 'em.
I don't like to try it.
Kennedy: The French lady's got her ear to the loudspeaker.
Cox: The Barley Straw, they had that - we done that here, you know.
An' they put that on, I've seen that bugger. I watched
on the wireless.
