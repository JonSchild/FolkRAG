                            The Prevention and Control of Rumor

I.   Personnel

     1.   The responsible head of this work must be an individual with
           maturity, good judgment, and common sense.

     2.   The responsible head as well as his staff must have a minimum
           knowledge of the psychology of rumor.
           There is an urgent need for a new manual on this subject. Until
           it is prepared the following references are the best available.
           They should be read carefully:

               a.   Hart, Bernard, Psychopathology. The MacMillan Co. 
                      New York, 1927. p. 94-124.

               b.   Knapp, R. H. The ABC's of Wartime Rumor (mimeographed)
                      report from Harvard Morale Seminar, obtainable from
                      R. H. Knapp, 18 Tremont Street, Boston.

                      XXVI p. 1-15.

II.   The Advisory Board.

      It is essential that the advisory staff be competent and active. This
      staff should include three types of persons. Since the treatment of
      rumors often involves considerable delicacy of judgment, it is important
      that advisors be available to protect the executive against his individual
      blind spots and habits of thought.

      1.   Technical advisors. In this group should be included psychologists
            or psychiatrists. A background in social psychology, and abnormal
            psychology is essential for a full interpretation of the rumor
            phenomena encountered.

      2.   Representative advisors. Since rumor agencies are often confronted
            with problems of the highest diplomatic complexity, it is necessary
            to have a wide representation of religious, labor, business, racial
            and cultural organizations. All appearance of partisanship must
            be avoided.

      3.   Prestige advisors. These persons are selected because of their
            prominence and influential position in the community. They lend
            the dignity and respectability so imperative for its successful
            operation. In addition they may often serve as the authorities
            who are quoted in the refutation of rumors. It is desirable to
            include in this group representatives of the local army or navy
            command, OPA, OCD, etc.
