Dear Mr. Lomax:
  
    I have been investigating the possibilities for bring-
ing Alan here, and up to the present have unearthed two
plans. One is to get a part of the fee from the University
Committee on Public Lectures, planning to make up the rest
by a small admission charge to the recital. The other is
to sell Alan to the Community Concert series as a bit of
lagniappe toward the end of their season. The second plan
is, in my opinion, preferable, not only because it would
assure Alan's fee, but also it would inevitably procure
for him a much larger audience than he would have otherwise.

    I'll try to report progress as I learn more about
what can be done here. McGinnis and Brooks and I are quite
eager to bring Alan, and I am confident an appearance can
be arranged.

    Cordially yours,
    Henry Nash Smith
