AN EXAMPLE, IN TERMS OF RADIO PROGRAMS, OF THE FOLKLORIST'S
APPROACH TO AMERICAN DEMOCRACY

The same approach may be applied to films, publication
programs, community festivals, theatre, etc.

1. A program to be entitled "Listen to Our Story". A dramatization
of the local history of certain specific towns, communities,
counties, or cities out of the materials in the Library of Congress.
This program is to be broadcast directly to an audience assembled
for the purpose of hearing it in the auditorium of the local library
and inviting the rest of the nation to listen in if it wishes.
This suggestion of the Librarian's appeals to me as one of the
most potentially successful ways of getting away from the coldness
and impersonality of all radio.

2. A program to be entitled "Out Our Way". A documentation of life
in America transcribed in the field with the sound truck and put
together at the dubbing table in the Library. A series of American
portraits drawn by themselves and having the directness and the
authenticity by the real people and real sound rather than sound
effects. America can get to know herself through a program like
this. It should be made in small towns and shipped to small towns
radio stations for use in their sustaining hours.

3. A program to be entitled "Our Singing Country". The story of
America in terms of its popular and folk music and the lives of
the people who made it. A criss-cross-pathwork of American lives
in music, designed for the morning hours and housewives.

4. A program to be entitled "The Language of Freedom". The central
idea of such a program to be American tolerance of all languages,
creeds, and colors. The materials for the program to be drawn from
the experience of various minority groups in America. Each program,
an exhibit of the story and culture of a national minority group
broken by a dramatization of the contribution of some member of this
group toward the growth of democracy in the world.

5. A program to be entitled "Their Weights in Wild Oats." This program
is to build the notion of Americans as fighters for democracy and
as rootin's, tootin', hell-raisin' fightin' democrats. All the
characters of this kind in American history from Gentleman Jim
Jeffries through Stonewall Jackson to Andrew Jackson and Davy Crockett
should have their stories told. A program for kids could be built
out of this material, although it might be better to use for the kid
program mostly material about scouts and trappers and western men
of various kinds.
