Note on Holiness.
This singing begins at the top of its but - the tones
are hit right on the bottom following the piano scale - the rhythm
is always heavy & almost oppressive - the voices are harsh
and strident - there is no melting liquid character here -
everything is aggressive, [pianistic?], in a fighting positive
mood - nothing {?ende?], graceful or nostalgic even
with young singers.
