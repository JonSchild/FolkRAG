WE'RE WINNING
Tune--Old Black Joe
Gone are the days when the farmer thought alone,
Gone are the ways when they managed one by one,
Now we unite to fight a brother's fight,
In unison we struggle now to win the right.

Chorus--
We're winning, we're winning, each day brings victory,
We'll never stop 'til dawn of day brings liberty.

Old plans must stop, where the farmer sells his wheat,
Soon will be gone, the speculator cheat,
Farmers must gain his business own control,
By selling through the co-op plan, the farmers goal.

Gone are the days when a farmer was a Rube,
None dare to treat him like a country boob.
Business will fail unless the farm succeeds,
We dare not let the farmer's cause grow up in weeds.

IF WE JOIN
Tune--Coming Thru The Rye
If a farmer join a farmer,
For a mutual cause,
Grafters fuss, exploiters cuss,
And find a thousand flaws.
Every good cause has its battle,
Face the foe like men,
Show you're made of solid metal,
'Til the victory's won.

Business men may join together,
For an enterprise,
If the farmers join together,
How the grafter crys!
Everybody organizes,
Let the farmer too,
He has just as many rights
As the other people do.
