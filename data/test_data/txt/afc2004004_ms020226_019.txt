An' ya har'ly ever hear talk of the-- the reg'lar homers; I don'
know 'bout the-- 'cause they ain't no big fields of this stuff
together -- but the regular homers who have big gardens that
way to sell or whatnot -- they don't have it, that much they have
to haul it in trucks, of course; they can haul it in a wagon or
a bugg-- you know, a lil' in town an' sell it --
but I mean, they don't go an' git no poison mess an' put on it.
They can take sul-- the real sulpher.  Now, a lot of 'em use the
natchul sulpher.  You know, what they have?  That's not gonna hurt
anyone, see?  An' lot of 'em use ah pure ashes.  You know, the
embers from the wood.  See, that keep all bugs off there.  That
what we used to do.  Mama used to save those ashes, an' soot.
You know, take the soot from the stove.  An' clean out the stove.
We cleans out our stoves.  Clean out the stove, clean out the
stove pipe.  'Cause sometime the stovepipe gets so full a soot, that
[you know,] hit won't draw good.  An' we clean that out.  Well, now,
all the soot an' stuff you can save, you know?  Ah, we put into the
bottom of things; put ashes on top of it.  That's good.  An' cover
it; keep it dry.  When the bugs git on the greens, ya just go
out there an' sprinkle it [on] over the greens, see?  An', an' put a lil'
bit a salt on ya greens sometimes.  Jus' [a il'] pure salt.  Over
cabbage an' collard.  An' bugs will come off.  Cause a bug
ain' stay there an' eat the -- worms an' everything.  It'll clear
'em up.
   But now they even got sumpin' that we made.  "We invented this
an' 'vented that."  An' that mess don't go wit' everybody.  Some-
some time it could make 'em sick.  Yeah!  Some time it ain't good
for your system.  'Cause what, ah, what don't hurt you liable to
kill me.  An' tha's, tha's jus' the way it's goin'... So... I'm sure
