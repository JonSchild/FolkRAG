Amasa - Sept. 22 - 
Clean, bare little town,
grey and deserted, surrounding
the Finnish Co-op - the
people grave, intelligent and
well-informed like the other
Finns I've met - the old songs
are going but their intelligence
persists - the houses have
books & toilets - even in
the country, the floors are
of hardwood and the farmers
talk like they'd been
to college -
Frank Vita is the local
