4  Take a mu'le, take a jack 
    Take a li'nin' bar for to li'ne this track.

5  On the mud line, on the sa'nd,
    On the mud line, get a man.

7  Run on down yonder to the third johnny head and touch it easy,
    Quick, make haste, I hear the train comin'.

9  Little ri'ce, little be'an,
    No me'at to be se'en.

10  Hard wo'rk ain' e'asy,
      Dry bre'ad ain' gre'asy.

11 Oh, Jo'e, Joe Li'ly Butt,
     Oh, Jo'e, caincha pi'ck it up?

12   Now, wait a minute, you stop right there,
Now, put your guns on your shoulders,
And come walkin' back.
They pass by me, they goin' the other way, now back.
They get up there and touch the joint just a fraction,
Just a fraction,
Go on to the next one and touch it just a fraction,
To the next one now and just barely move it.
I want you to just barely touch it,
Touch it just a little bit,
Just something another like a fraction.

SINGING LEADER

13   All right now, boys,
       Let me tell you 'bout tampin' ties this time.

LEADER AND GANG

       Have to ta'mp 'em kinda slo'w.

15  Jack the Ra'bbit, Jack the Be'ar,
      Caincha mo've it, just a ha'ir.

16  Sis Jo'e, don't you he'ar me now?
       Sis Jo'e, don't you he'ar me now?
