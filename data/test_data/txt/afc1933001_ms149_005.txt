New York, N. Y.

Dear John:

Remember I spoke to you one time about a labor song book and asked your advice about the inclusion of certain songs which have appeared on commercial recordings? I have now accumulated about fifty documentary songs of this kind and I am still doubtful about the best way to get sure copyright clearance for all of them. I have written Satherly, Capps and one of the people for the addresses of the singers and composers as the case may be, and I expect to write each individual for his permission, but I am sure there are various other complications in regard to the copyrights on the songs which I would like to take up with someone who knows more about it than I do.

I would greatly appr[?]ate your sending me the name of the person you once mentioned in this connection so that I can know on time when I go New York next Monday or Tuesday. I should also like to see you at this time and discuss various matters which concern us both.

Let me know where I can reach you in New York, and what time Monday or Tuesday would most suit your convenience. With very best regard I am

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax, Asst. in charge of Archive of American
