Dear Mr. Thompson:
I am sorry that we misunderstood each other in regard 
to the belt. As I understood you you said that you had 
several spare belts around your shop that you could let 
me have one for nothing. Certainly the belt that you sent 
me has been considerably used. I shall await another letter 
from you in this regard.
The pulley which was sent by mistake has been put in 
the mail, and must have reached you by this time. The 
afternoon you visited me here must indeed have been a sanguine 
for I certainly believe I heard you say that you could send 
me an amplifier, motor, and speaker for $5 plus shipping costs. 
However, I have decided to take the amplifier and the speaker. 
Please put them in the mail at once and make the bill out to 
me not the Library. We do not especially need any two speed 
motor, but if you decide you could let us have a GIS for 
$5 or 6 included in the shipment.
Enclosed you will find the recording needle you kindly 
lent me. Thanking you again for your repeated courtesies. 
I am
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
