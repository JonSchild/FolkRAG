of your "Introduction," not for revision -
just for my interest in
the project.  I had written you
and Ruth and Macmillan that
I was not to be referred to
as to matters affecting this
book, though I did think
that perhaps you, now and
then, would recognize my
justifiable interest and would
occasionally keep me informed
as to the progress and content.
I still wish the book dedicated
from us to Will [?Hagg].  My 
article on him has met
with wide favor.
   Lovingly, as long as I last,
and then your
   Father
