CASEY JONES

The workers on the Union Line to strike sent out a call,
But Casey Jones, the engineer, he wouldn't strike at all.
His boiler it was leaking, and its drivers on the bum, 
And his engine and its bearings, they were all out of plumb.

CHORUS
Casey Jones kept his junk-pile running,
Casey Jones was working double-time,
Casey ones got a wooden medal
For being good and faithful on the Union Line.

The workers said to Casey, "Won't you help us win this strike?"
But Casey said, "Let me alone, you'd better take a hike." 
Then someone put a bunch of railroad ties across the track,
And Casey hit the river with an awful whack.

Casey Jones hit the river bottom,
Casey Jones broke his blooming spine,
Casey Jones was an angel-o-no,
He took a trip to heaven on the Union Line.

When Casey Jones got up to heaven, to the pearly gate,
He said, "I'm Casey Jones, the guy who pulled the Union freight."
"You're just the man," said Peter, "Our musicians are on strike;
You an get a job a-scabbing any time you like."

Casey Jones got a job in heaven,
Casey Jones was doing mighty fine,
Casey Jones went scabbing on the angels,
Just like he did the workers on the Union Line.

The angels got together and they said it wasn't fair
For Casey Jones to go around a-scabbing everywhere.
The Angels' Union, Number Twenty-three, they sure were there
And they promptly fired Casey down the golden stair.

Casey Jones went to Hell a-flying,
Casey Jones?" the devil said, "OH fine,
Casey Jones, get busy shovelling sulphur,
That's what you get for scabbing on the Union Line."
