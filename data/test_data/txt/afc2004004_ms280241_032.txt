Jean: O he's very clever. Got a good head. He's a big stout
man. Strange as it may seem, the first time I saw you you were
very much like him - not his family, but his brother.
Lomax: Nobody knows where my family comez from - maybe we're
related to yours - God knows.
Jean: No, but strange as it may seem, you have a resemblance
to his people. He's terrible stout now, but his voice is there
because last year we saw him for the first time and he was
there singing. He came up and sat down and started to sing, and
my girl looked at him in amaze to think that a man of his age
could sing so well. To me it was nothing, because I knew, and 
he would be about sixty. He's no teeth. And I said, "Geordie,
you've never lost your voice. You sing well without your teeth."
"It makes no difference to me," he says, "without my teeth."
His voice was just as sweet and lovely as ever.
Lomax: Does he sing in the same slow and leisurely way that you sing?
Jean: Yes - if it's a sentimental song. Of course, he has
hundreds of songs.
Lomax: Why didn't Hamish go to him?
Jean: Hamish got his name, but I don't know if he got up there
or not. His sons can sing, too - very good family.
Lomax: Music seems to run in your family. How far back can you
trace your family?
Jean: Oh, I couldn't trace them, but I know they're a very, very
old family. As fas as I know, the first ofnthem come from the 
highlands of Perthshire. On my mother's side.
Lomax: That's the Robertsons?
Jean: No, the Stewarts.
Lomax: And they've always been musical people?
Jean: All musical. They'all could sing - all had good voices.
Lomax: So you're not exceptional. You're just normal. And your
grandmother was a Stewart?
Jean: No, my grandfather was a Stewart. My other grandmother on my
father's side was a Stewart, yes. She was called Annie Stewart.
But then, of course, there was the Highland Stewarts and the 
lowland Stewrts, you see. She was supposed to be a different
Stewart from my mother.
Lomax: And they were all people that lived in or around Aberdeen?
Jean: Well, my mother's people lived off and on in Aberdeenshire.
And my father's mother she came more from the Huntley side.
