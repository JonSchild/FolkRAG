BJ TAPE 7C, pg. 18

At least the girl that cut it for me.  But I wanted her to jus' 
put it over, ya know?  An' I cut -- Had it cut in here.  Forgot
all about it.  An' when I sent it home, she was so proud of the
dress.  She said, "But I had to git me a gimp" -- she calls these
things what, what we call a dickey?  An' she calls it a gimp.  She
sayd, "I had to get me a gimp to wear with it 'cause, Gal," --
she calls me Gal -- "Gal, you know I ain' gonna wear no low
necked dress."  Ha, ha, ha!  That shows, ya know, that they didn't,
they didn't wear their necks out or nothin' like that; they took
care of themselves.
An', an' they wo' these heavy undershirts.  Winter and summer.
Winter and summer.  Those heavy ones.  And...

as the sun can git to ya an' burn ya, why hit you know, your, you

see?  An' so that's what they did.  Dey didn' never...hum-hum.
You never see them naked.  At no time.  The womens or neither 
the mens, as far as that concerned.  Ah, they never did.  They
have on their good clo'es all the time.  They jes' sit an' patch
an' sew an' patch it nights an' days to keep them clo'es -- you know
if it wasn't anything git torn, they'd fix 'em 'till the last of it.
They kep'...
An' then, in other words, again, they boiled they clo'es.
TL:  They boiled them?
BJ:  Boiled the clo'es.
TL:  What did they do that for?
