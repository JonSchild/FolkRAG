over here, even where Mark is over there, that's a different
territory you see.  So they'd have a little house dance over
here and just the people,  you know,  [smokin] on Saturday.
They work like horses all the week.  And then they, they'd
wash up,  you know,  Saturday they take a bath and wash up.
And we'd have an [UNCLEAR] little dance, the young.  You 
know, had a lot of young people.  Everybody had a big family
in those days, you know.  A lot of people don't believe in
big families anymore.  But every family had 7 or 8 kids, 9.
And they, they danced there 'till.  I played a lot of dances.
When I was 14 years old then I played with my uncle.  The
dances, you know, they'd pass the hat around.  Well,
sometimes you get 40 or 50 cent.  [Let me] tell you, that was
during the depression.  I played at many a dance for 50
cent.  Well you'd work all day for 40 cent then on a horse
and cotton.
          A. LOMAX       And the girls that came to
those dances, they were very well chaperoned, weren't they?
          MR. FOUGET     Ooh yeah.  Now in the center
of the neighborhood over here, now you had a daughter, like
I'd walk back his daughter to his house you know, in the
dark.  Well you [could] scratch yourself without scratching
that old itch, she's right there with you.  You could hold
her arm you know, that's about it.  She's right there with
you.  Oh you'd never see a girl with a boy alone, no, 
without a chaperone.
