   That was kind of a poor job of singin'...
but that's the words to it anway-
    ... I think you've had to struggle very hard in your life,
haven't you?
   Yes, sir. Life has not been too easy for me. I married at a very 
young age and shortly after my first marriage I was drafted into the 
Navy, spent 30 months during World War II. Goin' back home, I was
refused my job that I had before I left to go into the service, so I 
started...           and it was not the right time, it 
was not a good time to buy equipment and land and everything, so I 
ended up goin' into the automobile business, and all the time I knew
that the Lord had called me to preach and I was doin' everthin' I could, goin'
to every singin' that I could, and gettin' in... and
everythin' that I could to keep ... from preaching.
In fact, I went eight years without even joining because I knew if I
did I'd have to start preachin' publicly.
   How did you know that the Lord called you?
   Well, because when I was saved I was in the Navy, and there was
nobody there but just me and the Lord. And we had made plans that day 
to go into town for a big celebration. We had pooled all our money
together and rented an entire cafe in... Idaho. ..
...                  in the service, you had to go to some
type of church service on Sunday mornin' and everybody went to chapel.
Course the chaplains, they had the same three or four stories that they
read and they just read 'em in repetition. There were 12 men that
sang in the choir, and they sang the same songs. And when we got back 
to the barracks we were kinda, I guess you'd call it...            'em
