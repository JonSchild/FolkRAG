Dear Mr. Goldstein: 

Thank  you for your letter of August 5.  Mr. Lomax will
be in the Soviet Union until about the first of
September, but I did want you to know that your letter
had been received and that he will answer it just as
soon as he returns.  I am certain that Mr. Lomax will
grant the extension of the option as requested.

Very truly yours,

Dena Hirsch
Secretary to Alan Lomax
