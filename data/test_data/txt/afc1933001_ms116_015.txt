help carry the machine, to do my haggling for
me. His pay is ten dollars a month with room
and board. He speaks just enough English so
that he can interpret for me but so little
that I prefer to use my own French patois
whenever possible. He is proving invaluable
and I hope to get time enough in the next
few weeks to teach him to read.
So far I have spent rather more than my five
dollars a day and I have sent a copy of my
expense account up until now to Mr. Voris
for his suggestions. From now on I think I
shall manage on less, especially when I get
back into the interior. The biggest item there
will be transportation.
I suppose this letter will not reach you
before Christmas. Therefore a happy New Year
to you. Give my best regards to Messers. Spi-
vack and Waters.

    Sincerely yours,

P.S. Would you be kind enough to ask Miss
Rogers to send me some mailing labels.
I would suggest, in case either you or Dr. Put-
nam write, that you send the letter airmail.
The plane comes in three times a week, the
steamer only once.
