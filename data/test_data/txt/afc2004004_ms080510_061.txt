On my first trip for the library at
Congress with recording on a little acetate
disc machine, I spent the summer with my
wife and friends recording in the
Cumberland Plateau, in the mining country
and among other things this little mining
family recorded a little mountain girl.  It 
was late in the fall and it was cold .   She
was standing in front of the fire o keep
warm, her little thin skirt and panties and
bare feet, standing on her toes to warm and
she sang the song that has become I suppose
the main anthem of the industrial union
organisation which she had composed about
her father.

My Daddy is a Miner.   etc.,
Which side are you on

Well it was a moving experience for a folk
lorist because what this child had done and
so many of her ancestors did, was to take

lady went to pursue her sailor sweet heart
