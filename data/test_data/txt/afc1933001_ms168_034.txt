Dear Alan,

I have your letter of the 21st and am pleased to
report that I am referring it, as the expression
goes, to the proper person, from whom, presumably,
you will soon hear. If you do not, please let
me know.

With reference to the last paragraph of your
letter indicating that you are "going to do
something about your albums", I have some skepticism.
I have become convinced that you are quite as
disorganized and procrastinating a person as I
am. Check me if I'm wrong.

Yours,
Moe
