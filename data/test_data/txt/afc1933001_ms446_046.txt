Oh, to sleep and never suffer, mother, don't be
crying so!
Hug me closer, closer, mother, put your arms
around me tight!
Oh, how much I love you, mother, and how strong
I feel tonight!
And the mother pressed her closer, to her own dear
burdened breast,
Oh the heart so near its broken, lay the heart so
near its rest.
At the solemn hour of midnight, in darkness calm
and deep,
Lying on her mothers' bosom, little Bessie fell
asleep.

I FEEL LIKE GOING ON!

I have started for Thy kingdom,
I am on my journey home,
I shall reach the "better country"
And I feel like going on. 

CHORUS:
Yes, I feel like going on,
Oh, I feel like going on,
I am on my way to Zion,
And I feel like going on!

And my Savior's going with me,
Every day I feel Him near,
With His presence here He cheers me,
And quells each rising fear.

I am in the land of Beulah,
And its breezes fan my soul,
I am nearing Canaan's border,
And soon shall reach my goal.

I am dwelling on the mountains,
