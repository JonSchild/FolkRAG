Dear Mr. Dick:

I have sent the recording "There Are Mean
Things Happening in this Land" under separate cover.
It should reach you in a day or two.   "Silicosis is 
Killing Me" as sung by Pinewood Tom is on a Perfect
recording, number 6-05-51 (18733).

I am very much interested in the film which
you are making.   Is it on silicosis or on industrial
diseases in general? I would appreciate anything you
wish to tell me about it.

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
