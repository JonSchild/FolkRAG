Dear Dr. Young:

The archive of American folk-song plans to make, 
during the months of August and September a preliminary survey 
of the folk music of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota.  
The work is to be done with a portable instantaneous field 
recording machine.

Dr. Rogers has suggested that you might be 
interested in helping me find any communities, either foreign 
or native where interesting specimens of folk music might 
be obtained.

I will appreciate whatever suggestions you may make.

Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge
Archive of American 
folksong.
