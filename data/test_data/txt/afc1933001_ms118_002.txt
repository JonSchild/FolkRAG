Port-au-Prince, 
February 13, 1937. 
His Excellency, President Estenio Vincent,
Port-au-Prince, Haiti. 
Your Excellency, 
I come to you with an unusual request, the granting of 
which will both facilitate a scientific work, important to 
Haiti, and make possible the happiness of myself and my fiancée. 
As you are perhaps aware, I have spent two months in Haiti 
registering for the Archives of the Library of Congress, Washington, 
D.C., imperishable discs of Haiti's national music. 
This work, all-important from the scientific and cultural point 
of view, will occupy me some time more, since the richness of 
Haitian popular music is not to be comprehended in a day. 
At present, however, my investigations are more or less at 
a standstill. A short time ago my fiancée arrived in Haiti, 
where both of us believed we could be quickly married and spend 
a happy and profitable honeymoon. Unexpectedly we discover that 
the European custom of the publishing of bans has been perpetuated 
in Haiti and that our marriage is thus postponed for two 
weeks. This means lost time for me since I have already finished 
my work in the Cul-de-Sac and had planned to travel North to 
make recordings of that rich and distinctive musical culture. 
As matters now stand I am forced to remain in the neighborhood 
of Port-au-Prince where my fiancée can be properly chaperoned.
