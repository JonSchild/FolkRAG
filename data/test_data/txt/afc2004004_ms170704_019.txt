The Dowie of Yarrow

There was a lady in the North
I ne'er could find her marrow (match equal)
She was coorted by 9 gentlemen
And a ploughboy lad frae Yarrow
-
These 9 sat drinking of the wine
Sat drinkin wine in Yarrow
They has made a vow among they selves
To ficht for her in Yarrow.
-
She's washed his face
She's comed his hair
As oft she's done afore - o
And made him liks a knicht sae brecht
To ficht for her in Y .
-
As he walked up yon hi [sl] hi [sl] hill
And doon by the hounds [howens] of Yarrow
There he saw 9 armed men 
Come to ficht with him in Yarrow
