President,
Berea College
Berea, Kentucky

Dear Sir:

During the months of September and October I shall be
traveling in the Eastern part of Kentucky engaged in making
records of folk-songs for the Archive of American Folk-
Song in the Library of Congress. In planning this trip, I
have all along intended to visit Berea College to renew
the acquaintances I made with it several years ago when my
father, John A. Lomax, came there to lecture. I have already
written three members of your staff (Mollie Wilcox,
Gladys V. Jameson, and Ethel McLure) asking for their help
and their suggestions, but I should like to enlist your aid,
as well, in this project.

I feel sure that at Berea I can find the material for
many delightful and valuable records and will be able to
establish splendid contacts through mountain boys and girls
with mountain communities rich in folk-songs. I hope that
I can depend upon your personal assistance in furthering
the work of the Archives.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge,
Archive of American Folk-Song.
