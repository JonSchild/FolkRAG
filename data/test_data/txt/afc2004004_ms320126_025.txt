didn't speak French anymore.  But I still can understand the
French language as spoken in this part of the country, and
through the years, of course, I had stuck to the English
language.  So, I think that's as far as I got a while ago,
now if Edwin wants to come in on his part.
EDWIN
When I started school, I couldn't speak English.  Strictly
French, all the family.  We was nine in the family,
everybody spoke French.  And I had a time at school 'cause
I didn't know what they was talking about, be excused and
everything like that, I didn't know.  In fact, I had to learn
the hard way.  But I did learn pretty good.  I memorized
everything.  In other words, I didn't know what I was doing
but I'd memorise, and when they'd say "it's your turn to 
read", I'd memorise, I didn't have to have the book.
Memorise all the songs and everything.  But my mother right
now, ninety eight and she can't speak English.  She can't
speak English.

Did they punish you and reprimand you when you talked French
in the schools.
EDWIN
No.  The teacher'd whip you everytime you'd make a mistake,
she looked like she'd pick on us because we couldn't be
excused for that.  And we was little tots, if we'd done
anything that we didn't what excused was, she'd whip us,
like wetting in your clothes, something like that, she'd
whip us.  And finally daddy come over and talk to the
principal and they was able to talk to the teacher and
eleven o'clock, ten o'clock, she'd let us go you know.  And
we didn't know what it was.  And they'd kind of laugh at you,
yes.  Like crawfish, for instance.  They'd laugh at us for
eating crawfish.  Oh man, that was a big joke.  We'd go out
there in the ditch, catch crawfish and boil 'em, they'd just
make fun of it.  But as you know right now, crawfish is one
of the leading foods in Louisiana.  I don't know if you eat
crawfish, but I tell you what, they not bad.
A. LOMAX
They cost a dollar apiece in Parish
EDWIN
That's right.  I'll tell you what.  They'd laugh at us
'cause we'd eat crawfish.  "you mean you eat that much
stuff"?  But they was good, like I said, we was raised on a 
farm and crawfish was good for us.
