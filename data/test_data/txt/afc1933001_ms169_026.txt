Dear Mr. Lomax:
Sorry that I have not written you sooner about entering
into a co-sponsorship of Mrs. Barry's Indian music project.
Mrs. Barry has not responded to my invitation to discuss the
possibility of co-sponsorship. I have also attempted to get
in touch with other people connected with the WPA music project
of which Mrs. Barry is a part. All have uniformly
failed to pay any attention to my inquiries.
In view of these circumstances, it is of course impossible
for this Department to undertake the co-sponsorship of Mrs. Barry's
project. I think you will agree that the failure to reply to my
inquiries about the project indicates an unwillingness to cooperate.
This leaves me with no other choice than to infer that the Department's
cooperation and help are unwelcome to those who are carrying
on the music project.
I am still of the opinion that a systematic recording of
Indian songs in this state would be an extremely profitable undertaking.
I am only sorry that we do not have on the staff of this
Department people qualified to do the job. In the near future we
may, however, be able to undertake at least part of the task,
without infringing on the work Mrs. Barry is already doing.
I regret our inability to accept your invitation to join in
the present project. I appreciate your consulting with me on the
matter, and I assure you that I stand willing to cooperate in any
work along similar lines that may be undertaken in the future.
Yours very sincerely,
Willard Z. Park
