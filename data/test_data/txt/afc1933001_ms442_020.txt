Oh, the hesitattin' stockin's an' the hesitatin' shoes,
Aunty's in Heaven singin' the Hesitation Blues,
An' tell me how long,
Will I have to wait,
Or can I git you now,
Or mus' I hesitate?

Hello, Central, give me two nought nine,
Tryin' to git to talk to that gal of mine.
Chorus:

I ain' been to hevan but I've been tol',
Angels in the heaven doin' the Jelly-Jelly Roll.
Chorus:

Yonder comes a woman wid great big legs,
Walkin' like she's walkin' on sof' boiled eggs.
Chorus:

My breakfas' on de table an' my coffee gettin' col'
Mama's in the kitchen gettin' jelly-jelly roll.
An tell me how long will I have to wait?
Oh, give two ninety eight or mus' I hesitate?
