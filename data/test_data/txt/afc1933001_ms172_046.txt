Dear Al:

You are right in your assumption that I am the guy
you roomed with at Choate. Many years and a great
deal of water have passed under the dam since then,
but I have always been interested from time to time
in hearing your progress.

Should you upon occasion come to New York, please
give me a ring at the office and let me buy you
lunch.

Sincerely,
Thomas M. Schriber
