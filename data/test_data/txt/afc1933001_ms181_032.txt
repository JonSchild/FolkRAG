Mr. Joe Brown
c/o Postmaster, Jennings, La.

Dear Mr. Brown:

The Archive of American Folk Song is planning to make up a group
of its best representative American folk songs to be distributed 
in Latin America. Among the songs we hope to use is your performance
of "Run Old Jeremiah" which you recorded for us. We
will pay you $10.00 for the use of this record which occupies
1 10" record and we will send you two copies of it for your own
use. 

I hopr you will give us your permission to use this song by signing
and returning the enclosed form as soon as possible. All the
records will carry the legend, "For non-commercial use only" and
of course your name will appear on every record. 

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
