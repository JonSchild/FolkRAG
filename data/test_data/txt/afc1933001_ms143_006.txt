March 16, 1939. 

Dr. John HUmble, 
Goshen College, 
Goshen, Indiana. 
Dear Dr. Humble, 
I am pleased to hear that the Library duplicate of the Amish 
record has served you so well. More such records must certainly 
be made, before any really adequate notion of Amish music can be 
arrived at. Amish singing technique must, it seems to me make the 
task of notating their tunes  particularly difficult. 
Plans for my next summer's field trip are as yet indeterminate
but it appears that I shall be somewhere in the Middle West. Perhaps
at that time I could do the recording in Iowa you mention. Otherwise
I hope arrangements can be made for you to borrow a machine. 
If that arrangement is made, I should like [some] to see records which 
are [I] a little more representative than those I made near Goshen:-- 
regular congregational singing with women in the group, women singing 
some of the tunes, the same tunes sung by persons of different age 
groups and on different occasions (in order to discover the degree 
of melodic fixity) [?], the same tunes sung in different types 
of congregations, in addition to some of the Mennonite tunes themselves 
in order to point the similarity or difference of the music of the 
two denominations. 
Thank you for your kind assurances about my role at Goshen a 
year ago. With best regards to Mrs. Umble and yourself, I am, 
Sincerely yours, 
Alan Lomax
