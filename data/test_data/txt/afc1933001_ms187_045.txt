Mr. Allan Lomax
Division of Music
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Shall I give up any hope to get the records I asked for? I
shall be in dire need of some from the 20th of November. If you
have some personal ones, could you lend them to me? On Saturday,
the 31st, for the Halloween, we have a show of Haitian folk dances
at the International House and are obliged to pay very much for
two professional drummers because I did not dare to ask your Department
for a record of Congo rhythms and meet with another refusal.

Sincerely,
Suzanne Comhaire-Sylvain
