out down there named Camel.  He was a humpback--you might of knew him--
and we was building     this hook.

AL:What did he do?
WB:He raised watermelon fields.     all that.  We built this hook
from here all the way around Williams back round that way.  You know,
levee used to run stra ight but they had three drag numbers on it: 
C-9, C-8, and C-3, you know, and when they built that drag mine, just
that levee.  And you'd have to go cross that levee after they
built that.  That's when they had that there ferry landing raft and you
go across the levee and go up to the ferry.And we was working down in 
there and we come in there and we was gatherin that night.  We just
started foolin around and I shot him. 
Now he didn't die right away, but he die from it, and they give
me five years.  That's when my daddy came to jail and told me that, 
"I be your Mama lied (?).  You lesser than a man to commit a crime and
stand arrested.  Yessir, you do enough to be arrested, you do enough
to be killed.  If     shoots you then you die."
My daddy was a mean man.  My daddy had another boat (?) like the one
where I took you yesterday.

AL:Tell us about your father, all about him that you remember.
WB:Well, I said the town I took you to yesterday, he shut it up (?). 
[*?*] He shut it up more than once.  The man what stopped us and asked us
did we need anything.
That man was     master.
