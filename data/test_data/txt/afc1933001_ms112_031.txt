Dear Johhny:  Thank you for your 
kind letter. I had already written
you both a poor scrawl on your 
first anniversary. (Credit Miss Terrill
for that. I have a blind
spot in the date region of my 
brain). Shirley has been to Mobile
and back again, expecting to hear
that she is next to meet Chris
at Charleston, S.C. She gets no 
word of any sort as to his 
movements and is nearly frantic.
There has [has] probably been sabotage
with his vessel - at least terrible 
delay and confusion account irresponsible
