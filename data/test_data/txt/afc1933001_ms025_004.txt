Dear Mr [?]

If you have not already [?] present yourself, I hope you will send word to the Carnegie Corporation as to your attitdue about [?] a [?] to me in the [?] [?] Collecting work. They have asked for no letters, but I feel strongly that a letter from you would be most influential with them.

Mr [?] has acknowledged the receipt of 196 [long?] records from us. We have about 50 here in total I should think approaching 100 songs.

I deeply appreciate your kindness to Mr [Martin?} of Time.

Sincerely yours, 

John A Lomax
