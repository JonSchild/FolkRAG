BJ:   No, I mean creatures.  Squirrels and lizards and snakes.
AL:  Well, aren't rabbits creatures?
BJ:   Well, everything's a creature, as far that's concerned. We're

ALL:  Did you ever eat (dog?) ?
BJ:   Hum-um.
ALL:   Did you ever eat snake?
BJ:    If I did I didn't know it!
ALL:   Bessie, did you hear the old saying that if you eat snake
meat, it makes you wise?
BJ:   No-o. How, how it gonna make you wise if you not wise yourself?
Ha, ha, it ain't gonna git ya wise!
AL:   No, no, but the snake is a wise animal, Bessie.
BJ:   He is?
AL:   Sure, I mean he's wise enough to fool Adam and Eve out of
the Garden.
BJ:                            That time. He ain't been
wise enough to get back an' have no more feet to walk on.
