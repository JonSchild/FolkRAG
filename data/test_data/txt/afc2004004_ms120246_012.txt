someone gives him poison, he vomits - the poison 
can't stay on his stomach.

A powder - a poison 
You buy a snake                             (a piece of skin of snake, remove the bones and powder them
     a malionya (lizard)                      with other animals
     a scorpion                                   put in pois grote'
     a crapeau
        (frog)

You put in a handkerchief & when you
meet your enemy you hit him & his whole
body is covered with poison.  You may live
two or three months & your body

[*The whole body of a dead person is poison.*]
Beigneur [woune?] [usouve'?]  - you have to
watch them because they'll turn the body
upside down & catch the water that runs
out of his nose & mouth, bottle it & hide
him in his dress - a poison called
trois degouts -three drops in your [duils?] 
and the God can't save you.  [If?] you
catch a man doing that you can cut
his head off and they won't put
you in prison.
R.M.- this is called wanga, too.
