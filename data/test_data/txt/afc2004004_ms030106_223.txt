They wanted JellyRoll to register.  They'd made him an officer but
he said a dead officer isn't no good anyhow.  Drafted him in the 22-45
group- just after that, the armistice was signed- none of the big guys
went- none of the good musicians went.  We used to play benefit dances
for the soldiers and that helped keep me out of it.
     The hotel was broken up.  Anita was very jealous and sold to Blondie
Robinson.  Anything you offer- sold for $400.  Anita went to Teroma Ariz.
and opened a restaurant.  Hot stock in gold mine- went back together
and opened places in Frisco (1918).  The Jupiter (Columbus Ave. bet.
Pacific ad Jackson) which served mostly whites.  JR played and Anita
handled the bar.  Place seated 550- 10 piece band, 10 entertainers, 20
waitresses.  Earl Dancer (responsible for the discovery of Ethel Waters)
was working across the street, was the boss politician.  He mad trouble
all along.  The trouble about the dancing license.  Spent $1500 to get
a license but never could get it.  JR wrote a letter, called down to
headquarters and insisted on going.  He was kept waiting 2 hrs.  Anita
insisted on going into the office (had a pistol in her pocket)
"Take a seat."
Slapped the letter befor her.

Who's is it?"
"Mine".

"You sure Nash didn't dictate it. (Nash was a Negro attorney they hated.)
