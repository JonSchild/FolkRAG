Mrs. Annabel Morris Buchanan
16 South Boulevard
Richmond, Va.

Dear Mrs. Buchanan:

This is a very hard letter to write,
because it involves a mistake that is 
quite difficult to explain. By some mischance 
in between myself and the printers,
no credit was given to you in Our Singing
Country for the two songs you so generously 
allowed us to use, "Santy Anna" and
"Haul away, my Rosie." I am sending a 
copy of this letter to Macmillan and insisting 
that they include your citations
in the next edition of the book. I am
sure you will understand that this was
something that happened somewhere between 
my office and the final publication
of the book, because the citation was
in the original copy.

With the hope that you can understand
and forgive  this omission, I remain,

Faithfully yours,

Alan Lomax
