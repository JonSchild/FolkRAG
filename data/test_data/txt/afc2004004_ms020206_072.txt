Reverend Roe.  Reel 6.  P. 5
R: On one occasion, I used to be a Gospel singer, and i was singing at
a revival, and there was an old man as I would sing the verses of the
song, then the chorus they would all join in with me, and he would just
stand and listen at me as I was singing the verse, [he would join in] & then when they was singing he
would shout around. So finally he got so happy til he went outdoors
and [started] want to climbing [the] a trees, ["Pray God on the Heaven." (laughter).] said, he was going on to Heaven.
That was an actual experience.
[*Shouting*]
A: Well, do you feel that at such times people knowwhat they're doing? Consciously?
R: Well, no.
A: How do they keep from hurting themselves?
R: Well, I think the Lord takes care of that. God's in them.
A: Have you ever seen them ever hurt themselves when they were shouting?
R: I haven't
A: Never even seen anybody bam against a bench or get bruised or anything?
R: [Well --] I haven't.
A: Cause that's pretty remarkable when you think about it.
R: [Sure.] Sho 'tis. Well, we might know that God was present, and if the Spirit
leads you, He would certainly lead you right and not in danger.
A: Reverend, when you were coming up, when you were [still] a young man,
did the people still have what they called shouts? Wehn they circled
around and around the church?
R: Oh yes, at every service, the people would have preaching and then
they'd just have a singing service, they'd shout. Yes, sometimes, the women,
you know, would hug up, you know, and [raise] catch hands and [they'd] just sing up and shout
you know, and praise God.
A: Well, what I mean is, did they ever [have] see a time when they'd just
shuffle [and circle] round and around the church? I mean go around the 
aisles?
R: I see that sometime yet, yes sir..
