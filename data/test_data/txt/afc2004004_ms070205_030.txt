the Spring-Mrs. Kvorup
& son, Forester, Apo & self.
Apo can cure people who are cursed.
He can also curse people who insult
him. To cure a burn he brings ice from
the North to cool the burn.
1 Chipped silver coin into
the spring, [because money
is evil & it stirred up]
2 Knelt over and blessed
the spring, putting something
much stronger than money
into the water.
