Mr. Chapin, War Department 2740, Labor 
Relations Branch, tells me that an increased number of 
"White Feather" reports have been received from various 
parts of the country.  "My boy is in the Army. Why 
should my neighbor's boy be going to munitions plants with 
high pay?"  If you have had any reports of this sort, please 
let me know so that we might communicate with Mr. Chapin.
