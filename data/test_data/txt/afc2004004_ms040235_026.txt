Scissors and a needle
I would give y darling

LULLABY

To pass an evening when the men happened to be ashore,
there was always the ceilidh. Friends came visiting 
in am informal way, and before long the singing had 
started. Perhaps some one knew a song unknown to the 
others, and that was the time for them to learn it.

became a living tradition. Few could return from 
a Ceilidh without having been emotionally stirred, or 
without having learned a verse or a rhyme to carry 
away with them, such songs as this, an Oran Mor, or 
poem such as the elegy on the death of Colin Campbell 
of Glenure, the victim of the Appin murder, or which 
Robert Louis Stevenson wrote in his book "Kidnapped".
