Michigan  Detroit  Reported by five policemen patrolling
                                 Detroit beats
                                 Patrolman B
Rumor:  As I was patrolling my beat, a young man well dressed about 29 years
               of age, 5ft. 9in. tall and weighing about 160 lbs., stopped me and
               asked me for information regarding a street and number. While in
               conversation with this man, he expressed that the opinion people were
               not accepting the war serious enough. The press in his opinion was
               not endeavoring to print the true facts about war production, and also
               stating he had heard, of a large Aircraft factory which was supposed
              to have airplanes on production but has not completed one that will
              pass Government specification.

Rumor:  1.
                Engaged in a conversation with a group of men, who appeared to be
                foreigners, it was brought to my attention that people of various
                races and nationalities believe that if Russia prevents Germany
                from conquering them, the war will end within one year, and people
                working in defense plants will be without work of any sort causing
                a major disaster throughout the world.
