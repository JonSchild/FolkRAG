Dear Ed:
Attached is a copy of a very charming Negro ragtime song that
my father collected in Shreveport many years ago and which I am 
publishing in a new book. It strikes me as being print-derived
and I wonder if you would put one of your best sleuths on the
job to see if you could find any source for it. I would be glad
to foot the bill to some modest degree.

How are things? I've been over my head in complex research now
for four years and have hardly left home, much less gone to
Washington. It happens, however, that I'll be there some time 
this month and in the Library, and maybe we can hoist a glass
for ault lang syne together.

[Sincerely] yours,
