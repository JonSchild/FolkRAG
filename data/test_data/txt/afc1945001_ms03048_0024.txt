Report made August 14, 1942
Rumor Report - Week of August 3, 1942
6. English soldiers are getting the food sent over for [*2*]
American soldiers, and the American soldiers in England have to eat
inferior food.
Shamokin -- 8/6/42. Character -- good. Class -- middle. Intelligence --
average.
7. I heard that the reason the English are keeping so quiet [*2*]
about Rudolph Hess is, that, if Russia falls, they are going to use him
in making a secret treaty with Hitler, without the United States
knowing anything about it.
Philadelphia -- 8/6/42. Character -- good. Class -- middle. Intelligence --
above average.
8. I have a boy who is in the Navy, and he tells me that the [*2*]
United States and other Allied Nation sailors wont have anything to
do with English sailors. He said, that on shore leave, all other
Allied sailors avoid English sailors like they would the smallpox.
Reading -- 8/6/42. Character -- ?. Class -- laboring. Intelligence --
average.
9. English sailors are afraid to go into the same bar rooms [*2*]
where there are United States sailors.

11. The British tricked us into this war, just as they did [*2*]
the last one.
Harrisburg -- 8/5/42. Class -- wealthy middle. Character -- above
reproach. Intelligence -- average.
12. The people of the United States are dumb. I know we're in
this war now. I guess we will have to see it through. But, I don't [*2*]
know. Sometimes I think we'd be better off on the other side of this
thing. The greedy British used us once before, to get them out of a
mess, and what did we get for that? Nothing but a lot of our boys
dead and wounded, and a lot of unpaid war debts. I know this. The
British are going to do the same thing again. Why do you think there's
no second front? I'll tell you why. Because they have to wait until [*4*]
they get enough American soldiers over there to do their fighting for
them.
Harrisburg -- 8/6/42. Character -- excellent. Intelligence -- above
average. Class -- middle.
