Mr. Harold Spivacke
Acting Chief, Division of Music
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

Will you, at your convenience, please send a letter
to thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Rutherford, at
Galax, Virginia, for their kindness in allowing me to
set up the recording machine in their home and use it
there throughout two days and nights - one night until
midnight. It was here that we recorded the singing of
the "Bog-trotters Sextet", headed by Dr. W. P. Davis
(I believe you have already written to him).

Alan will probably want to go to Galax sometime.
These two letters will help to pave the way for him.

Sincerely yours,
John a. Lomax,
Honorary Consultant and Curator
