they mean to people. I have sat in native 
huts many nights in Samoa & Tahiti & 
have listened to the native songs. Such 
singing I never hope to hear again.
While in Samoa (Pago Pago) I met an old 
German priest who had written down 
some 200 or more native songs. He was 
kind enough to let me copy some 
of these songs. The whole history of the 
race is written her in these songs
(All had English translations). And yet
in my visit to the Bishop Museum
in Honolulu, I found almost nothing 
in print of the music of the Polynesian 
race. I talked to Peter Buck about it &
he claims they havn't had the money
to spend on recording machines & so 
have no music. It does seem queer such 
an intense study has been made of 
these Polynesians in every place of their 
lives - but no music where music is 
such a vital part of their existance.

Just as a secret, Mr. Clark is 
considering the possibility of publishing 
some of Pete's songs. As soon as I know 
definitely, I'll let you know. If the answer 
is negative, I have a suggestion or two
as to other publishers who might 
be interested.

Mr. L. W. Curtis of Los Angeles told 
me of your wonderful folk song collection.
How I should love to see it some day. 
Sincerely 
Elizabeth Burnett
