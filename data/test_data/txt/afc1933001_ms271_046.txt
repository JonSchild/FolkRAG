The Little Brown Jug Goes Modern
To The Tune Of "Little Brown Jug"

Moderato By
HANK KEENE

A-dolph Hit-ler, the bul-ly-in' bum, de-cid-ed the whole world he would run, he
built his ar-my in se-cret soeed, and star-ted out with his Blitz-krieg. He
first took Po-land, then he took France, he marched right thru with a goose-step dance, but the
*Allies stopped him* when they *got* their chance, *and* they'll march him back by the seat of his pants!

CHORUS

*Hey Hey* You and me. The end of that bul-ly we soon shall see.
*Hey hey How glad we'll be* when Hit-ler swings from the limb of a tree!

2nd Verse:
Then Mussolini thought that he'd jump in
And divide the world with his maniac friend,
But Hiter gobbled 'til he made himself sick
And Mussolini just got the plate to lick.
Then the facsists thought they'd carve a piece
But they got burned by red hot "Greece!"
*Italy'd* be all right we feel,
But it's shaped like a boot, and run by a heel!

Chorus:
*Hey, hey* you and me
The end of Mussolini we soon shall see,
Ha ha ha, we'll laugh with glee
When Mussolini swings from the limb of a tree!

3rd Verse:
You've heard of a place called Tokyo,
That's the place little sneaks grow,
They'll grin in your facem and if you're kind
They'll stab you in the back *tight* at the time.
But we've got a man, MacArthur's his name,
With a handful of Yanks he put 'em to shame
When he gets thru with Tokyo
Japan just won't be there no mo!

Chorus:
Ha ha ha, you and me
The end of those rats we soon shall see.
Ha ha ha, we'll laugh with glee
When the Axis swings from the limb of a tree!
