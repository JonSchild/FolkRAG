Dear Dr. Shickman:
I deeply appreciate the sympathetic and systematic
attention you gave to John Davis, who undoubtedly is
one of the heroes of American folk music.  It is won-
derful to know that he is going to be able to continue
his work without any hindrance at the moment.  The
report that you sent us will, of course, be of first
importance in case he ever falls ill in the East, but
let's hope he never does.
Meantime, many thanks to you again both on his behalf
and on the behalf of all of us who love and admire
this group of singers.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Lomax
