FARM OF MY DREAMS
Tune-- Pal Of My Dreams.
Farms of my dreams, I love you, honest I do,
You are so dear,
If I could just hold your charm without alarm,
Then I would never fear.
Since you have gone--home, life don't seemthe same,
Please come back again.
After all's said and done, there's only one,
Farm of my dreams, it's you.

Prosperous time, I love you, honest I do,
Where have you gone?
If I could just run you down, kill off your frown,
Then life would be some fun.
Since you have gone--home, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, money's the one,
Coin of my dreams, that's you.

MY UNION
Tune--Ramona
My Union--I know you got a fight to make,
My Union--I feel there's everything at stake,
I trust you, endorse you and blessed the day you taught
    me to join,
With brother and sister and those so weary, sad and
    forlorn.
My Union you'll get the best that I can give,
My Union, it's for you day-by-day I live.
I dread to think if we should ever fail or fall,
My Union, I love, you, my all.

My Union--I love to think that you are right,
My Union--You've grown to be my big delight,
You still me and thrill me and make me dream of the
    great fight to come;
When victory and sunshine shall rest on every little
    farm home.
My Union--our crown of freedom must be won,
My Union--we'll rest when all our task is done.
We are not halt or stop to count the bitter cost,
My Union, you'll save or we're lost.
