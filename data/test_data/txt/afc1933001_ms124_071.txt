Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter of August 27,relative to securing records of
American Folk Music. I shall be glad to cooperate in every
way that I can in this movement and think I know of one or
two persons that might be able to contribute something.
No doubt there are others we can find.

I am quite interested in having Eastern Kentucky Folk
Songs recorded for I think it should be the richest
section for this type of music.

Very sincerely yours,
[*Anna L. Bertram*]
