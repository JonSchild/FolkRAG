best thing to do is turn 'im on his stomach and pat 'im. See how
that work. That work with some chilrun. Then you try somethin'--
rub them ov' here in the forehead. An' that work with some chilrun;
he go right on to sleep. You see? That's keep from spoilin' han'
trainin'. An' then sometime you lay 'em on the back--that lil'
white boy I got charge of now in Fredricka, I jus' lay 'im on his
back an', an just [love] rub that lil' fanny [(mumbled here, all unsure of]
[exact transcription)] An' jus' rub him [and] round that way
way. An' jus        "Ah, ah, ah; ah, ah, ha." Heh, heh. Another [next] thing
[you know], he gone on to sleep. He       so       he just go on
to sleep. Until I got [him so] them     [he] white folks to do it, you
see? Now he's a big chile, you know, he's a good size now...But
you can start at nine months old and lil' before that.
[*nursing + loving*]
AL:     But before that, before nine months?
BJ:     You jus' have to nurse 'em and see what...
AL:     Do you hold 'em up close to you?
BJ:     You hold 'em close to you, a course. An' you hold 'em close
to you afterwards; hold 'em close to you now, accordin' to what's
the trouble with 'em,  you know. An' ??? nurse 'em, an' cheer 'em
up, an' let 'em know that they are babies, you know. Some babies  
you got to cheer. Suppose he fall and hurt hisself or sumpin', see?
Well, he didn't mean to hurt himself. Show him that he...well, cheer
him up. And nurse him up. You got to cheer him up an' let him know
he is a child and the danger. An' then teach him the danger of that,
whatever he fell over or what not, you know, like that. You got to
continue holdin' 'em close to you. An' also lay down with 'em some-
time, you know, an' play with 'em. You know, cheer 'em up. You got
to make 'em to know you and know your (spirit to all -?-) an' not
just throw 'em down all the time and leave 'em an' go do  your work
an' never be with them once. Somebody else come along and nurse 'em
up and cheer 'em up, they think more a them than they would you.
You see? I got a lot of white peoples' chilrun, they grown on up ?
             (?). They mind me better than they do their own
parents. Um, plenty of 'em. All down the street, on the beach,
anywhere. [Said] Instead of leavin' em cry; I'm comin' on to them. An' [leave] lead
'em. Because there's a certain way to cheer 'em up and a cer-
tain way to let 'em know you mean what you're doin'. But all along.
