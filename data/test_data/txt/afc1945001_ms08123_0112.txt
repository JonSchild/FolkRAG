RUMOR

NOT MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AGO, ONE
OF MY BEST FRIENDS APPROACHED ME WITH
A SAD LOOK IN HIS EYE AND TOLD ME
OF A CLOTHES PATIONING TO FOLLOW ON ONE
OF THE NEXT TO SUNDAYS.  HE ALSO STATED
THAT NO PERSON WOULD BE ALLOWED TO
SPEND MORE THAN $65 A YEAR ON CLOTHES
AND THAT IT WAS NOT TO BE DIVULGED
SINCE IT WAS FROM A TRULY AUTH ENIC
SOURCE.  AS A RESULT, MANY PEOPLE HEARD
IT AND SOME BECAME PANICKY AND BE-
GAN TO BY AS MANY CLOTHES AS THEIR PURSE
WOULD ALLOW.
