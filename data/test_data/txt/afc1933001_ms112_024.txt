various people, and [it seems to me that] that sort of thing is basic to a 
radio educational program.

I don't know why I'm going on and on this way; it's just that it's
Saturday afternoon and I'm about to knock off. Let me know how things are
going and I do wish you'd get on Charley's tail about this South American
music business; it's too bad to have all these requests go unanswered.

Much love to everyone, and do come up to New York; it would be
wonderful to see you.

Mill, by the way, wrote a beautiful program for a Navy Relief show the other
day which I'd like you to hear a recording of. He's getting a lot of government
script jobs now, and I'm going to do some work with him if I get any time. They
sure do seem to be falling all over to get competent script writers for these
propaganda shows. I don't blame them; most of the things going on now sure are
lousy. Elia Kazan, who was the M¿C¿ on Mill's navy relief show came up to him
afterwards and said he'd work free on anything Mill wrote-- isn't that something?
And it was just because [it] the thing was full of good plain talk-- the kind of
job any Almanacer could do with his left hind foot. The first half of the show 
was a dramatization of [HYM] Hyman Wolozinsky's (of the Bronx) letter to his father when all the 
neighbors were sore at his pop for signing [to] the papers to let him join the
navy. It's a real letter & beautiful. Then in the second part of the show pop met some of the people fighting
with Hymie-- a British fire warden, a New Zealand aviator, a Russian [aviator]
sailor who stood in [forn t] front of the mike and beamed and shouted off a lot 
of Russian just like in the movies, and Bart Van der Schelling who sang Freiheit.
It was a beautiful script-- if I get hold of a copy of it I'll send it along.
