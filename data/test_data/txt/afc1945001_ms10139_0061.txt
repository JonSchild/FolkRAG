H.S. Sophomore 420 Boy

1 There was a chinaman in the army, and the other soldiers
didn't treat him, they put rocks, grave ect. in his
bunk. So one day the soldiers said, we wont put
no rock gravel in your bunk more more. okay then
I wont piss in coffee no more.

2 Why is the sergent the last to get in bed - because
he haves to tucked his babies in bed.
