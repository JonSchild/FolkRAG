BJ TAPE 7D, p. 38

     Co'se I don't think ya oughta jus' a-walla (wallow) an'
tear up your clo'es, but it's a way in the Bible, an' ya clo'es
will go right out from under ya, you see?  But they don't know
how, 'cause they not used to bowin'.  Ya see?  That what I'm
talkin' 'bout, see?  If I go down to bow an' I'm on my knees an'
I, I jus' get myse'f up an' move that way.  My dress go out then
I go on down.  See, the dress is out.  I ain't got to be standin'
up pullin' an' tryin' to keep from -- let everybody
see I'm tryin' a hide; keep my dress from gettin' lil -- I wear
white, most all the time, see?  You got to be particilar with
that, in [that] a way.  But I don't have to git down there an' do that;
I just shove [that] my. . .my dress out. . .from. . .wit', wit' my knee, an
bow, at the same time.  That's a curtchi (curtsey), see?  An' go
on down.  Most of 'em does.  I see -- I jus' kinda look around an'
see 'em, most of 'em's on their knees an' their dress is standin'
right out from 'em.  They on they knees, ya see?  Don't worry.
     An' I notice back up here in, in Connecticut, I went to ah,
one a our churches -- I mean one a our churches -- an' behold,
they had pillows around the altar.  An' those lil' ol' soft
pillows.  Said, "Jesus is (?) an' givin' it to too good."
"Givin' (insurance?) too good," I said to myse'f.  "This' too
proud."  It's a really good, to get down there an' get to seekin' an'
[that,] you gonna stay right on that thing, if you prayin'; try
to keep your knees from gettin' on [that,], on [that] the floor or anything,
see?  An' Jesus got on the ground. . .Ya see what I'm talkin' about?
                                            This is too much in pride, see?  All
that's just not, just not -- it's not real good, ya know.
But yet an' still, I guess they just did it, 'cause somebody mighta
spoke about they clo'es or sumpin' like that, ya know?  Sumpin'.
