Dear Reverend Back,
Perhaps you remember that one night in September you
were kind enough to permit me to bring my stereo tape machine
into your church and to record parts of your service. I have
now completed my trip and have compiled one long-playing record
of white religious music from various parts of the South, which
is to be published by Atlantic Records. I would very much like
to include part of the recording I made that night in your church,
and by your courtesy.
Attached is a letter of contract which gives me the formal
right to use this recording -- part of your sermon, followed by
the hymn, "Salvation Oh the Name I Love." If you will kindly
agree to allow me to publish this material, I could send you a
payment of $25.
I hope you understand that my enterprize is scholarly and
cultural in nature. The presentation of the material will be a
dignified one. And I feel sure that you and your people would
be delighted by the appearance of the album and the context in
which this recording would appear.
I will greatly appreciate your cooperation in this matter,
and hope to hear from you soon.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Lomax.
