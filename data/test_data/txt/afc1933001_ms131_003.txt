Dear Alan: 

It will be possible to supply finished 
dubbings of all the Kentucky material 
collected by Miss Barnicle at a cost
of $1.25 for each double-faced ten-inch
disc. The duplicates will be on acetate.

There are in the neighborhood of eighty 
records, and deliveries can be made at 
the rate of at least twenty a week.

Sincerely yours,
Charles G. Ritter
