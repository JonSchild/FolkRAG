Tape:
890 Nimrod Workman cont.
(with Phyllis Boyen, daughter)
Phyllis: my name is Phyllis Boyens, Nimrod's youngest daughter.
I was born and raised in Chaterooga, Virginia, Mingo County,
right in the heart of the coal fields. And I grew up in the
coal camp. Daddy worked in the mines. 
[AL: How many children did you have, anyway?
Nimrod: 13 children... last I counted, 8 or 9 grandchildren,
I don't know how many great grandchildren. too many.]
AL: Is all the family interested in songs and poetry and
music and things like that?
Nimrod: They all like to listen to me and her. I have a 
few that plays guitar. They play gospel music and belong
to the holiness Church. They don't sing songs that me and
 her sing. We sing them all, from Barbara Allen out. 
Phyllis: My oldest sister, she writes and things. But it's
only gospel music. She travels and sings gospel music, and
all of her kids. And then I have a brother who writes, like
country and plays guitar. But I remember my grandmother
sang also, when I was growing up, my mother's mother. 
She was in the Church of God, she would sing all the time.
AL: Did they sing lullabies to you or just rock you to sleep...
Phyllis: no... let me tell you, when I was growing up...
Because I was the youngest, well I have a baby brother, but
I was like 8 years older than he is, so I was the baby a long
time. And dad would get me in the swing or rocking chair
out on the porch, and he would sing all the real bad songs,
