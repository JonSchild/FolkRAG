Dear Professor Hudson:

I appreciate your comments on the "Provisional Check-List of Disks". Although the time has been short, we have added nearly five hundred new disks since the check-list you examined was printed. I shall be interested to see the tunes of your forty-odd Folksongs from Mississippi, which are being edited by Dr. Herzog. You must be sure that the Library has copies. By the way, my son Alan is now in charge of the Folk-song Archive. The Journal of American Folklore asked me to review your ballads for that publication, and I am passing the job on to Alan. As a proud father, I know you will forgive me for saying that he writes far better than I. The sad part of this statement is that it is the truth.

I am heading down the road in a few days for the South and might possibly drive by the University of North Carolina. If so, you'll have to forgive me for stopping to see you.

Sincerely yours,

HONORARY CONSULTANT AND CURATOR
ARCHIVE OF AMERICAN FOLK SONGS
