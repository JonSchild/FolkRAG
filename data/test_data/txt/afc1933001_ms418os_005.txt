SOUP SONG
Tune: My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean
I'm spending my night at the flop-house,
I'm spending my days on the street;
I'm looking for work and I find none
I wish I had something to eat.
CHORUS:
Soo-up, soo-up
They give me a bowl of soo-oo-up,
Soo-up, soo-up
They give me a bowl of soup!
I spent twenty years in the fact-ry,
I did everything I was told,
They said I was loyal and faithful;
Now, even before I got old: (chorus)
I saved fifteen bucks with my banker
To buy me a car and a yacht,
I went down to draw out my fortune
And this is the answer I got: (chorus)
I thought that my country would help me,
I went out to bleed and to die,
I fought in the war for my country
But this was my country's reply:

WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED
We are built up by the union,
we shall not be moved,
We are built up by the union,
we shall not be moved,
Just like a tree
planted by the water,
We shall not be moved.
CHORUS:
We shall not, we shall not be moved,
We shall not, we shall not be moved,
Just like a tree planted by the water,
We shall not be moved!
They use machine guns and rifles,
But we shall not be moved,
They use machine guns and rifles,
But we shall not be moved,
Just like a tree planted by the water,
We shall not be moved.

SOLIDARITY FOREVER
Tune: Battle Hymn of the Republic
When the Union's inspiration
Through the worker's blood shall run
There can be no power greater
anywhere beneath the sun,
Yet what force on earth is weaker
than the feeble strength of one,
But the Union makes us strong.
CHORUS:
Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
For the Union makes us strong
It is we who plowed the prairies,
Built the cities where they trade,
Dug the mines and built the workshops, endless miles of railroad lay,
Now we stand outcast and starving
'Mid the wonders we have made,
But the Union makes us strong.
They have taken untold millions
That they never toiled to earn,
But without our brain and muscle
Not a single wheel could turn;
We can break their haughty power
Gain our freedom when we learn
That the Union makes us strong.
In our hands is placed a power
Greater than their hoarded gold,
Greater than the might of armies
Magnified a thousandfold,
We can bring to birth a new world
From the ashes of the old,
For the Union makes us strong.

ROCK-A-BYE BABY
Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree top,
When you grow up you'll work in a shop;
When you are married, your wife will work too,
So that the rich will have nothing to do.
Hush-a-bye baby, on the tree top,
When you grow old your wages will stop,
When you have spent the little you've saved,
First to the poor house, then to the grave.
