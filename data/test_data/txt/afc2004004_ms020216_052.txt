         Said, "She's not here."   Said "She gone on to the school."   She
taught school.
         So in a few minutes, she called me at the house where I was workin'
at, too.   Frankie had jus' tol' me.   An' so ah, she said, "Bessie,"
says, ah, "Is you comin' to work for me when, ah, Miss Water

         I said, "I was but I don't think I will now."  Huh, huh, ha, ha!
         So she said, "Why?"
         An' ah, I said, "Why you ask me that question?"
         "Well, I wanted to know, uh, Frankie says she ain't comin'
back."
         I said, "She just told me she wasn't comin' back."  I, I
said, "Tha's why I ain' goin'."  I said...
         She said, "Why?"
         "Because you can't get along with Frankie, you can't get
along with me."
