To the Editor:

Dear Sir: As a Sheldon Fellow of Harvard University I am engaged
in collecting the folk-songs of America, my work being at present
especially concerned with the songs of the negro,--his "reels," his
spirituals, and his play songs. I ask your aid in bringing together the
words and music of the most distinctive negro "ballets" precisely as
he has sung them and in many places continues to sing them. Almost
all negroes sing. Sometimes their songs are version of [music-hall] No.
ballads; oftener they are a crude, natural expression of his emotions,
his real life. Perhaps some are echoes of his primitive life in Africa.
He improvises readily and rhythm is a prominent part of his emotional
make-up; and his songs seem to rise spontaneously to match every
emergency of his experience. In the cotton-patch he sings:

"Fus' time I saw de boll weevil
He was settin' on de square;
Nex' time I saw de boll weevil
he had all of his family dare,--
Dey was lookin' for a home,
Jes' a-lookin' for a home."

As a teamster on the levee:

"Cap'n, Cap'n, what time o' day?
Billy done holler for his oats an' hay,--
Gwine t' harness in de mornin' soon, soon,
Gwine t' harness in de mornin' soon."

As a Mississippi riverman:

"'Long come de Katie Adam [with] wid her headlight turned down stream
An' her side wheel a-knockin', 'Great-God-I been redeem'."

Of one of his desperado friends:

"'Twas twer on a Christm[a]us morn[ing]en,
De hour [was] were [a]bout ten
When Stagalee shot Billy Lyons
An' lan[ded] in de Jefferson pen,--
O Lawdy, po' Stagalee."

In his church:

"When my blood run chilly an' col' I'se got to go,
I'se got to go, I'se got to go;
When my blood run chilly an' col', I'se got to go
'Way beyond de sun."
