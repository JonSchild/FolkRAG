A                             Joke
           I read a joke which I thought
was very comical. It was about
a man who was working in a
munition plant where they made
bombs. One of his fellows workers
wanted to scare him, so he came
behind  and yelled , "Boom" Knowing
that the whole plant was packed
with bombs, he jumbed, practically
out of his shoes. Everyone in the
plant was laughing at him and he
was the most embarassed man
there was.
