Dear Mr. Knapp: 
Thank you very much for the material sent me in your letter of June 24th. 
I am turning this material over to Mr. DuBois of the Office of War Information, and I presume that you will hear very shortly from him or from Mr. Katz of that office in regard to making use of the Morale Wardens. I think it is a very ingenuous idea and shall be interested in keeping in touch with the results you get. 
Very truly yours, 
Rensis Likert, Head
