AL:What's his name?
WB:Mr. E.H. Winn.

AL:Was he the boss then? 
WB:We were living on his place, living on his farm and they always
caught me.  See, then the law was set, you could commit a crime living
on anybody's place and they wouldn't come to your house  and arrest you,
they come to your boss's house.  They come to your  boss's house and
tell them that "I come out there to arrest Walter Brown and he done
such and such a thing."  And he say, "Go on back and I'll bring him down
there."  That was it.
But now, you know, they make out a warrent for you.  They go to your
house and they can get you and get the man [you] too, if he says anything.
But then, if you stayin on a man's place, but if the come out lookin
for you, they could pass by you and know that's you.  But they wasn't
gonna bother you.  They go to the man that you was livin on his place.

AL:You mean that they were afraid of plantation owners.  The lawmen
were afraid of them.
WB:That's right.  Because you had to get a permission from them to
arrest anybody on their place.  Like they used to tell you on [y]the
place.  Like the man was tryin to tell you yesterday about the Delta
pine land place.  They used to tell you there:  "You keep your body
out of the grave and I'm gonna keep your foot out of the jail."
["]I don't care what you do, make it back to the place." 
They wasn't going    [le]like I be trying to tell these
