Dear Mr. King,

        Evidently I did not make it clear in my first letter
to you exactly what the Music Division wants. We are making
a collection of authentic renditions of American folk songs
on records, and in process of this work we send portable
recording equipment into the field , visit authentic singers
and record the old songs they know first hand. I felt, perhaps, 
that you were a chantey singer , yourself, or that
you might know some individuals who were. In that case, a
trip to Charlestown might be arranged and in that way the
old songs might be set down accurately in a way that is 
impossible to achieve in print. What is important here, of course,
is not the voice of the singer, but the way he renders his
material. I should like to know your reaction to this proposal.

                                                  Cordially Yours,

                                                     Alan Lomax
