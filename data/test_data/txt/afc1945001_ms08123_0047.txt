Rumors
   In this national
emergency, it is very unpatriotic
to say thing that you know
nothing about.  These thing
are sometime called: Rumors.
   They cause many thing to happen
when they are told to some
people.  You must always be on
guard for them, and if you want 
to be patriotic, be shall not to 
pass them on.
