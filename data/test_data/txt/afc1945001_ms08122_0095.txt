When Henry Kaiser arrived in Washington
he was late for an appointment with the 
newspapermen.
"What happened?" the reporters asked the
man who had broken all shipbuilding special
records.
"I had to wait thirty minutes for a 
taxi," explained Kaiser.
"Thirty minutes?" a newspaperman
asked. "Then why didn't you build one?"
