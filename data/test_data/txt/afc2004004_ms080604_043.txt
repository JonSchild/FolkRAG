     You go out there in the morning, plenty
mornings you'd have to wait until it get light enough to go
to work.
W.B. :
     That's right!
B.G. :
     You'd be standing there in the dark.
W.B. :
     Standing there in the dark.
B.G. :
     And when it get light enough, then you go to
work.  And then you work in the evening, until it get dark --
you couldn't see how to come in.  Those mules just knowed they
way in, cos they didn't have no electric lights in those
times.
W.B. : 
     Till you couldn't see how to take your mules
out.  Everybody that didn't have lantern lights in they
headquarters --over at his tent (B. Gordon) and around the
commissary-- they had dynamo lights.  In other words, you
just say it was a free penitentiary.  Just say it was a free
penitentiary.  And what I mean about a free penitentiary, you
didn't to have to ask nobody could you go nowhere when you get
in, and there wasn't nobody standing out there watching you
when you got ready to leave -- there were so many men.
(PASSING TRUCK)
A.L. :
     Hold on.  You were sayin that there were so
many men?  Say that again, please?
W.B. :
     It was, ah. . many men that went there and
worked expecting payday.  And they didn't give em none -for
six or seven weeks!  And leave there without. .ah, -- he can
leave there and hadn't got nothin for his work since he had
been there but his food.
B.G. :
     Sometimes they give you what you call a drag.
W.B. :
     Yeah.  A drag.
B.G. :
     Like you pay off five or ten dollars,
somethin like that.
