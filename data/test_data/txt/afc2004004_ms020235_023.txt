Listen right at 'er -- at 'im.
     I eased back in the house before he left her.  Because he
kept along an' she kept a-walkin' to the gate.  Her, her an' her
daughter were together.  An' he said he could go with ary one of
'em, bof of 'em.  He tol' me that long afterwards, ya know.  But
anyhow, ah, he, he did let her alone.  Then they went to talkin' [out]
[there,] an' so. . .
     I said, "Now, I got to work this thing smooth as I can because
they say he's a flyback (?).  "An' I told him straight to
his head!  Hum, hum!  Not that night, but a ni -- a night or two
later.  I told him then, you know, when he come back an' forth to see
me.  I told 'im straight to his head.  I said, "Now, I heard that,
that you don't work."  I said, I said, "An' I can't go with no
now -- I can't be workin' an' comin' in an', an' know you ain't
workin'."  Said, "I cain't stay with you.  I'm not gonna do
that.  I don't work with (FOR) nobody."
     He said, "No, I ain't worked for none of 'em."  He said,
"An' I ain't never gonna work for none of 'em."  He said, "But
if I find somebody I want,"  he said, "I'll work for 'em.  I don't
find nobody I want."  I guess that's. . .I don't mean. . .how. . .Ha,
ha, ha!  So, so he said, "If I want to, I'll work."
     An' so, the next week he got a job at the cotton press.
Was peoples s-- amazed in that place!  Oooh!  They was amazed
in that place!  They say, "He ain' gonna hold it long."  Well,
he sho' helt it, le' me tell you.
TL:  Did he really?
BJ:  Oh yeah!  His mama even much told him -- 'cause they talked
to her against me then; said that, "You know she must undoubtedly
hoodoo him, 'cause he don't work."  All that kinda mess.  One lady
