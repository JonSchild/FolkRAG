Tape 89. HARRY COX.
Cox: I know that used to be sung - The Servant Maid - my
grandfather -- years ago. And they had no learning -- my father
couldn't write his own name. He could write his name - that's all
he could do - just put Robert Cox. He went a-fishing for seventeen
years alongside an old skipper in Yarmouth, and he couldn't write
nor yet read. All he used to do when he sent his bags to them was
cut off a tag and tie it on. Yet they learnt these songs - and the
different tunes they got now are all wrong....

......This part of the world. Said, "Would you mind taking up
the door ?" And he took up the door and locked the door; and she
was gone. She wanted to get rid of him. Well, he looked over his
shoulder and Miss Kipp was gone, and he stood there in this basket
in this fellow's door! That come in like that.

Lomax: And what does the rhyme say, Harry ?

Cox: What, the chorus ? All ye that want to go to London...

Some cry old hartichokes, some cry old clothes,
Some with a snuff-box just fit for your nose.
If you'd heard 'em you thought they was calling the cows,
They made such havoc in London.

London is sharp as the edge of a knife
The city is filed with fraction andstrife,
There's none so seeet as a country life
All you that want to go to London.

Lomax: That's like that "Up with the rigs and down with the jigs."

Cox: Yeah. Oh, that was a song, you see, all that carry on with
the firststart of it. When he went to London - he went off to London-
he nether got shoes nor stockings hanging on his leg, an' away he
went, trudging to London. This all happened when he were there, you
see. That's what he found when he got there. Like there was an old
bloke there, old Neave, he come from - come from just nigh there.
He'd heard that old song. He say, "That's pretty true," he say.
"You go up to London," he say, "You want to have wit about you,"
he says, "You do want wit." He want to catch a train - a certain
train there somewhere, an' - an' the bloke that was there - I don't
know where it was - it were at the station there or something - an'
he said, "You can't get that train." "I- I must have him" - he was
a rummy little old fellow - he said, "I got to get it," he said.
"I must get it." He said, "You won 't get it." He said, "If I go
and stroll through here, I'll get it." Well, he locked the door, and -
and "I never got it," he said. He locked the door and he coudn't
get out, and he didn't know another way to get there, and the train
went out and left him. "And I didn't get it," he say. "You want wit,"
he say, "'bout there.
