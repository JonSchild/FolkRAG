Reel of 9/26/61, Side 1, Song 9
[*30*]

                              MY LORD, WHAT A MORNING
                              A schoolteacher's morning song

CHORUS:     My Lord,
                      What a morning,
                      My Lord,
                      What a morning,
                      When the stars begin to fall.

REFRAIN:     You may hear the angel shouting,
                      To wake up the nation on the ground.

                       Lookin' to my God's right hand,
                       When the stars begin to fall.                     (CHORUS)

                       You may hear the thunder rolling,
                       To wake up the nation on the ground.     (REFRAIN & CHORUS)

                       You're gonna hear the trumpets sounding,
                       To wake up the nation on the ground.     (REFRAIN & CHORUS)
