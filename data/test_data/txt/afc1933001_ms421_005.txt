It's a good thing to get high wages, 
It's a good thing to do. 
It's a good thing to get high wages, 
They're a great big help to you. 
Good-bye to low wages, 
Farewell, wages small. 
It's a fine, fine thing to get high wages, 
For they help us all. 

It's a good thing to get free text-books, 
It's a good thing to do.
It's a good thing to get free text-books, 
It's the finest thing for you. 
Good-bye, poor education, 
Farewell, unschooled folk. 
It's a fine, fine thing to get free text-books, 
And that is no joke.
