to really plunge in here on all
the stuff I brought down, clean
it up, and be ready to start
for Washington, say, in March.
We've got to re-record the Negro
Play Party Songs and I could
easily get some more Mexican
stuff in Corpus and its environs
before I start. Why can't
you spare a machine for
me? What I could get in a
month is worth a new one.
Again I suggest that you
talk it over with Mr. Spivacke
then tell me what's what.

I'd like to know what you
bought for yourself out of the
Christmas money I sent you.

Affectionately, Father.
