Superintendent, Wallkill Prison
Wallkill, New York

The Archive of American Folk-Song has many records of Negro
prisoners' songs made by its honorary curator, Mr. John A. Lomax.  We
regret that these records are not yet available for duplication or
distribution.  Many of these songs, however, have been printed in the
two collections by John and Alan Lomax which, with others of the same
type, have been listed below*.
