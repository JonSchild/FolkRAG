Roll 44 Stand and Ray Hicks

(Ray) out with him, and he pulled the sack out and opened it up
a little to not let any of them out.  And she says "Bring 'em in
tuck em in there. . .I'll keep you the night, give you supper, 
and give you breakfast, and give you 15 cents to boot, a dime and a 
nickel."  And Jack said "Okay, trade!"  He stayed the night, and
the next morning he ate his breakfast, and took his 15 cents and took
the honeys home.  And he finally traveled on, traveled on, and he
got in home.  His father had passed away, his mother had passed
away, Will and Tom had passed away and his sisters were passed
away, and nobody knowed him.  Nobody knowed who Jack was, and
that's hard!  To get a livin' when nobody knows who you are!
And so he went out tryin' to find somebody that would know him
yet a livin', to help him out.  And finally, nobody never did
exactly, really -- a few kinda thought they knowed him, you see
he left young and then got old, he was old and changed his
looks.  And so he got to settle down there on the place and went
to workin' on it, tryin' to clean it back up.  It was growed up,
just like this is growed up here since I been sick.  And it don't
reasonable to me, it don't look right to me the way it once was
here, growed up the way I come up in it.  And he 'gan to clean it
up all he could, and directly, it come out a advertisement.  That
there was a feller down in (unint) down in around there that had
two tracks of property, two tracks of land, an upper and an upper
one. The house was a ghost.  It had got in, it was a runnin'
everybody off of it, I mean kill 'em, he's dead next mornin'.
He said, "I buried men til I got tired of it.  Quit sendin' anybody.
It's Death, in the house." . . .
