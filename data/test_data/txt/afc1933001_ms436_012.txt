armed with baseball bats, knives, guns, clubs and so forth and so on.  They 
asked him," Are you with that show,"
"Nawsuh, I come from Scotsboro."
"Well, it's lucky yhou aren't, because we're going to kill every 
one of them black bastards."

"Will Benbow was the kind of a fool that never thought anything was 
the matter that he couldn't talk his way out of.  I told him, " Well, you can 
stay and talk if you want to, but I'm going."
I had a couple of old blankets in my trunk and I cut them up in strips 
and made a rope and we all slid down to the bottom of the bluff.  That night 
we stayed in the hotel and didn't go back for our trunks until broad daylight.

Later on Stringbeans joined the show at Jackson.  He was the greatest 
comedian I ever knew and a verry very sweet fellow.  He was over six feet 
tall, very sleder, with big liver lips, light complected and he always wore

put mine in one time when I had so many diamonds I didn't know what to do 
with them all so I said I might as well put one in my  mouth.  People
