GD:    But you go through the world and nobody, nobody,
there ain't nobody right how come you know so much
about ain't nobody right and the thing you miss, if there
ain't nobody right, then you ain't right yourself
then you don't see nobody right.

LJ:     Then you say You right, the worlds wrong.

GD:    You see, Now the Scripture says eat no bread, before
evil eye near the __________ of this daily meal.
For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.
Make the same claim, then, if you think somebody hurt
you because you. How come you think somebody hurt
you, because you hurt somebody. You understand.
You can't get out of that, because you'll do
the same thing you'll think somebody else will do.
Then if you get people scared of you, if you scared
of people then people will be scared of you.

LR:     Thats right.

GD:    You know what I'm talking about. How come we can't
live here now, because we scared of everybody and
everybody scared of us. Now I've Travelled, I want
to talk about myself traveling.
