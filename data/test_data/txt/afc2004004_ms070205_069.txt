Newberry - The toughest
little town I have seen
in Mich - Larsen's
Luce Hotel - the young loafers,
football players, fighters around
the dreary bar, potential fascists,

had been beaten up and the
Finn Workers Hall smashed -
we showed them reds - [we]
radio stations all over the
country congratulated the little
town of Newberry - whistles
blowing at 6 AM - chased
