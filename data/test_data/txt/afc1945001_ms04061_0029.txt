On Wednesday, August 5, the same rumor was heard on a street
corner in Columbia. A young man was overheard telling an older man (both
of them were well-dressed and apparently white collar workers) that many
of the pilots at the Columbia Air Base were too inexperienced to fly the
planes turned over to them and that numerous accidents occurred but that
Air Base officials were surpressing the news.
