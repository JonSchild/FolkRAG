OLD NERO

(Bessie remembered this after hearing Hedy West sing Little Musgrove;
Hedy suggested that I record it.)

Bessie:  You know the story.  This man had a big plantation and a nice, 
very nice wife, as he though, and this young man came there.  He was a 
single boy and very nice looking, but he was sort of poor and he worked
for this man (Nero).  This man had one daughter, and the daughter was
off in school.  The boy liked the girl and the girl like the boy, but
the man thought the boy was too poor, you know, for his daughter.  He
didn't want the girl for to marry this boy, but they liked one another.

So anyway, this boy still stayed there with them while this girl
was in school.  This boy boarded right there with them, worked with them,
in the same house, with is room like a shed room off the house.  So he
knew that when this man would go hunting that another man would come and
be with this man's wife.  He knowed that.  So it got so severe that he
wondered to himself, if he would tell Nero, if Nero would,  you know, believe
him, or just how would he take it, because he knew how crazy he
was about his wife.  And he wondered, you know, would it be right to tell
him?  And he say, if he didn't tell him (and his mind was
to tell) that if he didn't tell him and Nero found out he'd knowed it
that long, Nero might want to kill him for not telling him.  So he was
just aggrieved up what to do, but his mind say he go and tell him.  He
wasn't going to let it be that Nero catch him knowing and not telling. 

So he decided that this man was there in bed with the wife 
and he'd tell Nero.  And he did, he went in the woods and told him.  And
that's where the beginning of the song is.  (I can't think how the other
verses went but I know how the story go.)  And he went in the woods and
told him, and Nero told him: Now if this is the truth you brought to me,
I ain't got but one daughter in this whole round world and her wedding
you shall be.  He knowed that boy wanted the girl. (He done come to like
the boy more than the boy thought anyway.) And he said;  If it's a lie
you brought to me, a rope and a gallows and a burying suite and a hanging
you shall be.

So the boy went on back to the house, and Nero blowed before
he got to the house; he didn't slip home.  He blowed his horn as usual,
a hunting horn, and the man heard the horn, and the man felt that that
was Nero.  He told the woman, he say: I think I hear Nero coming, I better
go.  She told him: No, that's not him, because she thought, you know,
it was too soon for him.  She said:  No, it's not him, it's my father's
boys in the woods blowing up sheep.  Because they generally blowed up
sheep in that part of the night.  And so, lie still and keep me warm;
it ain't nothing but my father's boys in the woods blowing up sheep.

So he did stay on, and that time Nero come in through the shed
room, by the boy's room, you see; he come on in and he come into the door
to where the man was in the bed with his wife.  So he told him
to rise up, rise up and put on his clothes and fight me for your life.
I wouldn't have it to say that I slayed you naked laying in the bed with
my wife.
