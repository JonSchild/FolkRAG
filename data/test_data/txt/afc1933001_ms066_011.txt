1/6/1940
Monday.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

1. Alan says that if I phone to
you I will have today in my
office an alphabetical list of all our
duplicate records, properly arranged. You
please consider yourself phoned
to.

2. The copying I am having done by
the W.P.A. people is practically a waste
of time. If you could give me [a]
some competent help, I could increase
our output at least ten fold. And
this last statement is a conservative
estimate.    Yours sincerely,
John A. Lomax

P.s. Until the storm subsides we are both
working in our hotel rooms.
