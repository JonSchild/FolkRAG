State:  Oklahoma    City:  Oklahoma City     Reported by:  Dan Hollingsworth  Policeman 

Place or circumstances in which rumor passed:  On a police beat

Description of the person:  Did not have a regular beat but in the course of his 
visits over the city, gave especial attention to 
listening for rumors.  

Rumor:  Circumstances were that a person working on a defense project had told the 
following story to a man who in turn told it to the policeman:  The man 
said that he was working on the Oklahoma City Air Deport at a salary of 
$175 a month and was fairly well satisfied with his work.  The C.I.O. 
Union came along and urged him to join the union so he could get $100 a 
week.  Things like that are going on all over the United States and this 
C.I.O. racketeering has got the country in one hell of a shape.  (For your 
information, the A.F. of L. is the only union working on this job as yet 
in the field of construction work.)
