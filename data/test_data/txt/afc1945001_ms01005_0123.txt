[*Rumors*]

Mr. Lucien Warner                                                                      September 28, 1942

Eugene Katz, Special Services Division

Assignment

Will you please, in consultation with Gene Horowitz, go to
work immediately on the Bureau of Intelligence Special Report on
rumors to rewrite it or expurgate it, in order to permit its circulation
to certain members of the press and radio, to Federal Security
Agency contributors, to field men and to other personnel outside the
Government, interested in the subject. There is no point in rewriting
what Barth has written. Your function would be that of censorship
only, plus, perhaps condensation where you think it necessary.
