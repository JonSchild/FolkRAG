Mr. Alan Lomax,

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter of February 28th has been forwarded to my 
son, Samuel P. Bayard, 14 Hilliard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Sam is now working for his doctor's degree at Harvard.  His thesis, I 
think, is to be on the subject of folk song but he doesn't have it ready 
as yet.  I hope he will find time to write you before long.

With best regards, I am 

Very truly yours,

E. S. Bayard
