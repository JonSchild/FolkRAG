[*FOOT
SKILL*]
Ah, thereby hangs a, an interesting story in
American folklore.  . . . [*[*] The solo male dance in
place with footwork - foot crossing and foot
agility and leaping and, and ah, an accent on
the lower leg is the classic dance of the
north western part of Europe.  It's the dance
that shows off the skill of the hunter's leg,
and of the, of the ploughman moving along the
furrow.  And ah, foot crossing is that sort of
action, because you have to cross your foot as
you walk a narrow - narrow furrow.  It's the
ploughman's stance. But it goes back even
further than that, because ah it, it's the
dance of people who live most of the year in
very small houses, and to dance you haveto
dance in one place.  You can't move around. [*]*] 
Ah . . there's a - this dancer here, dancing in
front of the - of an Irish ah, of an Irish ah
fire, shows that.  If he moves his arms he
might hit somebody in the face, so he keeps
his arms to his side.
