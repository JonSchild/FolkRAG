War Rumors
Rumors are serious things
for they may, if carried on, destroy
civilian morale.  Some people seem
to delight in repeating these rumors.
The people here worry about
the boys on all parts of the earth,
and the boys worry about their
friends and relatives who are now
safe at home.  [?]  in a letter to the
service men, you complain about
what sacrifices you make, or what
you can't buy when you want it, the
boys will think the home front
is on the point of a collapse.
Parents are naturally proud of
their sons in service but this is
no reason for repeating their locations
or when they are to leave the harbor
for another point.  Many idle 
words may be picked up and
be used to a poor advantage to us,
but to good advantage for the enemy.
