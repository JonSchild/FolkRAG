June 23rd__ Sat.
Wednesday - We cruised 
along the grey-mossed rocks of the
Hebrides. The sea was slate and
silver. Spent hours in my cabin
writing letters. Everything is a great
and exhausting job for me.
Dr. A. Mcalean & his lovely wife
met me at the dock - housed
with the McPhees.

That night I record Dan [McNullern?]
1st mate of the ship on which
I sailed. Slept till late.

Then Thursday had a great
halay [?] which ended at 3 AM
Beautiful records of Hebridean
group singing. A group of people
just 1/2 generation off the farm - 
like a community sing but
magnificent with old tunes
