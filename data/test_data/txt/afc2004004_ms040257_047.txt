The wind, the wind, the wind blows high
The snow comes falling from the sky
Mary Wood says she'll die
For the want of the golden city.

She is handsome, she is pretty,
She is the girl of the golden city
She is handsome, one, two, three
Come and tell me who shall be.

Here comes the bluebird through my window
Here comes the bluebird through my window
Here comes the bluebird through my window
Hi diddle um dum dee.

Take a little dance and a hop in the corner
Take a little dance and a hop in the corner
Take a little dance and a hop in the corner
Hi diddle um dum dee.

Take a little hop and dance with your partner
Take a little hop and dance with me
Take a little hop and dance with your partner
Hi diddle um dum dee.

My name is Sweet Jenny my age is sixteen
My father's a farmer in yonder green
He's plenty of money to dress me in silk
And nae bonnie laddie'll tak me a walk.

I rose in the morning, I looked in the glass
I said to myself, what a handsome young lass
My hands by my side and I gave a Ha Ha
And nae bonnie laddie'll tak me awaa.

On the mountain
Stands a lady
Who she is
I cannot tell
All she wants is
Gold and silver
All she wants is
A nice young man:

So call in my Andrew dear,
Andrew dear, Andrew dear,
So call in my Andrew dear
Andrew dear.
