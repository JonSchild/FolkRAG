BJ TAPE 11, p. 35

said to myself, you, "She didn' -- She thought that she'd a-had the thing..."  Ha, ha!

But the main part about it, I wouldn't, ah, I always have had it in my mind not -- never to give a person a chance to fight.  You know, no sense in fightin'.  It makes ya sick to fight.

AL:  Did you ever really have a knock-down-drag-out with anybody?

BJ:  No, that... the wuss ever I had...

AL:  That's the worse you ever had, huh?

BJ:  That's the wuss.  But, an' then, for nothin'.  That's what git me.  Everytime I been in a -- I been in two squalls in my life an' it all fer, each-each time started 'bout nothin'.  As I could say, I never even see what that was about to stop it.

An' so hit went on for Mamie.  Ah, that evenin' she caught the train.  An' Mr., Mr. Williams was there; he told 'er, the boys, to take 'er down.  You know, all her stuff down at the train, see.

AL:  With the hole in her head an' everything?

BJ:  Oh, yeah, well they were carried 'er to the doctor.  See?  Right there in Abbottville.  An' doctor stitched it up.  I forgit how many stitches they tuk on it.  An' she had stuff to go on.  She didn't seem to care anything about it.  She was a heavy drinker, ya see.  An' she didn't seem to care anything about that.

An' she got 'er somewhere -- She got on that train, that evenin'.  Se we all -- There's a big sto' there near the train, there's a flag station; you know, jus' a lil' place there.  With a big store there.  An' so we all were standin' up there an' ah, an' lookin' at 'er.  An' she jus' cussed Mr. Williams outa the train.  Say she wi' (wish) he wa' dead.

AL:  What'd she say?

BJ:  Hah!  She jus' called 'im nasty word an' say she wished he was dead.
