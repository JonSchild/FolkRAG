It's of a young lady who was worthy of praise;
at the age of nineteen she ended her days.

Likewise, there is a lament for a murdered cattle-drover, and 
for a volunteer who was lost in the civil war. there are 
satires on two families who – to judge by the songs – must have 
been feeble-minded.

I have heard and recorded some "play-party" songs, but know so 
little about that type of folksong that I can say nothing about it.
Some of them I have chanced to see in old-country collections, 
and the rest may be all imported from Great Britain too: they 
are all alike in style, as far as I can see.

Of the camp-meeting songs and spirituals in my collection 
I know next to nothing – that is, nothing about how widely 
current most of them may have been. Some of them I have seen 
in collections from the Appalachians and Ozarks; most of them 
are unknown to me outside of the districts where I got them. 
A few that are apparently known over a rather wide area are:
The Poor Wayfaring Stranger
The Lost Youth
Wicked Polly
The Little Scholar (or: Shepherd)
The Little Family in Bethany
We Have fathers in the Promised Land
On the Other Shore
Power in Jesus' Blood
The Power of the Lord is Coming down
Will the Waters Be Chilly?

Perhaps you can get an idea, from these rather "scattering" remarks, 
of the number and types of indigenous songs that I have found 
in the course of collecting during the past three summers. I am sure 
you will agree that the ones given in my first list are so widely 
known as to be familiar to every collector. The others I have quoted 
or referred to might well belong to the same category – but you know 
far more about that than I. The indigenous pieces in my collection are a
very small part of the whole, which consists mostly of the old British songs, 
versions of which are found all over the country.
  If there are any of these songs about which you wish to have 
more details, I shall be glad to tell you what I know – which isn't 
much, but might possibly prove helpful or interesting in your study. 
I will quite frankly admit that my interest is centered more on music 
than on texts, and that the imported old-country songs absorb me 
more than the American-made ones; which I have noted down simply 
as a matter of duty and record, as a collector should. I am not blind, 
however, to the value of specialized study of these native products; and 
if any details I can furnish you will aid in the solving of problems 
connected with indigenous folksong, I shall be only too glad to
furnish them.
Yours very sincerely, 
Sam P. Bayard
