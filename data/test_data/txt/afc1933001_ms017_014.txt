My dear Mr. Lomax:

I am returning herewith your son Alan's interesting notes.
Some of these ditties that he refers to I should be interested
to see and hear. You are certainly making good progress.

The publishers who print the "Arizona Home" which they
claim has been infringed by all the publishers who have issued
different versions of "Home on the Range", now have brought suit.
I know that you have had some correspondence or conferences  in
this matter, and I wonder whether you could shed any additional
light on this controversy. Have you at any time run across the
tune and words in your ramblings down South? Or could you say
with authority that you heard the tune and words before 1904?

This case should form an interesting test of what constitutes
a "folk song" and how it originates.

With kindest regards to you and Alan, I am

Faithfully yours
Carl Engel
