EAST COAST LINE

A song for the dances "Bailing the Jack" or "Shake it to the East"

'Way down yonder,
Hey,
On the east co' line,
Hey,
They eat syrup by the gallon,
Hey,
They eat meat by the pound,
Hey,
They eat bread by the pone,
Hey, 
She's neat in the waist,
Hey,
And she's pretty in the face,
Hey,
And if I was you,
Hey,
And you was me,
Hey,
I'd stop right still,
Hey,
And I'd shake it back.
Shake it to the east,
Shake it to the west,
Shake it to the very one
You love the best.
