el, that be miserable to a man, you see. If he ain't used to it, 
that's miserable, see. You get used to man that says, all right, 
get your jack, pull it, walk righton off; that's good. But one of 
em gonna stand right up over you and say unh-uhn, little bit over; unh-uhn, little more-- that's miserable to you. That's smore'n you know how to do it, you see, but you've got to do it his way. To
