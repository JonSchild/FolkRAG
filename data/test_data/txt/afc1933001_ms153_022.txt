A Program of the Deep South 
in Song and Story 
with 
ELIZABETH STRYKER 
Soprano 
Mrs. EUGENE BUELER, Narrator 
MRS. BLANCHE PRINCE, at the Piano 

This program will consist of Historical Narrations depicting 
the life of the Old South with Songs relating to the period 
described. 
Miss Stryker has made a specialty of the French, Spanish 
and Negro songs that have made Louisiana and the Southern 
States unique in musical history, and is prepared to give a program
of the Bayou Songs of the Deep South, Negro and White 
Spirituals, the beautiful songs of Stephen Foster and many 
others depicting the life and history of these Southern States.  
Lyle Saxon, in his book "Fabulous New Orleans," has 
given a marvelous picture of this Southern city, and New Orleans 
may well be called fabulous, for no city in America can 
boast of a history so fascinating and glamorous. This famous 
city, settled by the French and later occupied by the Spanish, 
is rich in tales and traditions, such as the story of the Voodoo 
and its ceremonials, the old street cries of the charcoal man, 
the chimney sweep, and others. 
Miss Stryker and her narrator are able to present a very 
vivid picture and a distinctive program. Many of the old songs 
have never been published. Miss Stryker is prepared to appear 
in costume such as is worn by the belles of Natchez in the 
Pilgrimage of the Original Natchez Garden Club, typifying 
the life of the old romantic South. 
This program is available for Radio, Women's Clubs, 
Churches, High Schools, and for any gathering of clubs or 
organizations.
