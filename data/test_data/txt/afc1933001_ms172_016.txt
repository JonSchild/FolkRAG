Galena, Missouri

Dear Mr. Rnadolph:

I have recommended to Doctor Spivacke, Chief of the 
Music Division, that your recording project in the Ozarks 
be implemented by the Library of Congress. The suggested 
budget includes the following items:
a) Total Mechanical costs, including 400 
acetate disks a hundred of which would 
come to you as duplicates of your 
collection for further study ...... $ 500.00
b) Total field expenses, including travel, 
living and reimbursement of singers, 
for five months ............ 1000.00
Total Budget ............ $1500.00
About $200.00 of the $1000.00 mentioned above has been 
allocated for the tips and gifts and outright payment by the 
hour for the singers. We shall leave this entirely up to 
you.
We plan to press and release at cost a certain number 
of our best field recordings and as a token payment to the 
singers involved, the Librarian has authorized the payment 
of $10.00 per side for such releases. Among these releases 
may well be four or five of your very best records. If the 
question comes up in field recording about publication, you 
can quote the above.
May I know by return air mail that this total proposal 
meets with your approval. Details can be worked out later.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge of the 
Archive of American Folksong
