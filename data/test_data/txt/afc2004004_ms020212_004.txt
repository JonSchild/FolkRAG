Dear Mr. Lomax:

Received your letter of October 15, and will assure 
you that we have no intention of mishandling the
 Georga Islander tapes. We recorded these tapes at
the request of the Island Singers, as they thought
 you might be interested in an inconcert album for
 them.

Though the tapes we have are in stereo and are of
 sufficient quality, I will agree with you that
 material organization is essentially a very important 
factor in producing a good album. Of course, 
you must realize that your monaural tape copy has
 only about one-third of the selections that were
 recorded.

If I may be of any further service to you please
 let me know.

Sincerely yours,
Phil Dering
