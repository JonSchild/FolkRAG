Miss Mildred Stocker
2450 Pingree Avenue
Detroit, Michigan

Dear Miss Stocker:

As it happens, neither of your pictures of me
are accurate. The Library sent on another recording
machine and I left Detroit about a week after I
saw you for three and a half months in the field.

I am delighted that you find your present job
so unsatisfactory because I have half an idea that
there may be an opening here in the Archive within
the next month or two. If there is, and your application
is at hand, I feel sure you will be, as the
personnel office says, "seriously considered."
Please let me know if you are interested and consider
seriously how many seasons of American folk-lore you
can stand before you answer.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-Song
