Next time you're in Indiana: Richard E. Banta at Crawfordsville, Montgomery
County (home of General Lew Wallace, Wabash College and James Buchanan Elmore,
the Bard of Alamo) should be a good source for you. Dick deals in old books
and manuscripts and helps sell Wabash College to high school seniors and 
College alumni; he has a wide knowledge of the state and an interest in 
native ballads. He used to have a considerable collection of material.
At Bloomington you might look of Guido Herman Stempel, professor 
of comparative philology at Indiana university. The last time I saw him was
three and a half years ago and his hearing was getting poor then, although 
he seemed to understand when somebody said, "Have another". He knows more
than a little bit about music and can give you plenty of good Hoosier leads 
to folk music, I'm sure.
