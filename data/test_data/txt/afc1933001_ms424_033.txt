BALLINDERY
(Ireland)
It's pretty to be in Ballindery
It's pretty to be in Aghalee
It's prettier to be in bonny Ram's Island
Sitting under an ivy och
Hone och hone och hone.

Oh! that I was in little Ram's Island
Oh! that I was with Pheli my Diamond
He would whistle and I would sing
Till we would make the whole island ring
Hone och hone och hone.
