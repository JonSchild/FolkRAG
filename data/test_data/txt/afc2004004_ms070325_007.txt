   This is a strange place to begin
a diary - in this cellar in this
whore of a town, this "gentile"
whore sold out to America.
I am more alone now than ever
in my life.  For the first time
lonely like other people with
no recourse against it not
unhappy, but knowing it's
easily close.

   The band is blasting brassy
bronx cheers at life.  Everyone looks
serious & sentimental for that
sound corresponds to the savage
anger of their dreams.

   I am soft.  Feel forty.  Less than
ever sure of anything.  About to
be a failure.  Badly defeated &
come to nothing if I don't sharpen
my focus.  Good night.  To bed.
