Ballad of a Lumberjack

By North Star Camp Crew

Old Sawbucks was a logger,
in the mighty days of old;
His word was law to all the jacks,
and when he yelled they jumped;
The logs went down the skidway
at an awful pace, I'm told;
The jacks were straining every nerve,
from to night they humped.

Full sixteen hours he drove them
for he said "it's plain to see
If they have any idle time
they may begin to think,
And the harder the jacks labor
the better off I'll be."
He kept the men in terror;
his roar would scare them pink.

All night the jacks were busy
for the bedbugs and the lice,
Kept every worker scratching
all the time he was in bed.
The smells disturbed his slumbers,
and a few stray rats and mice.
The only hope jack had of rest
was after he was dead.

He fed the men on liver
and a little Irish stew;
The pancakes were like rubber
and the biscuits were like lead.
Said he "that chuck is good enough
for any logging crew,
And some sawdust in the sausage,
Will make filling for the head."

The midday dining chamber
was a vast and grand affair;
The men ate in the forest
and the chuck froze on the plate.
The jacks were used to all this
and they didn't seem to care,
But the Union came among us 
and there's been a change of late.

The bedding now is decent
and the jacks can get some rest.
The chuck had been improved a lot
it's really fit to eat;
We're going to keep on fighting
till we finally get the best
Of fruit and eggs and butter
and the choicest cuts of meat.

Sometimes you meet a goofy guy
who fails to do his part
In the ever present struggle
for an ever rising wage;
It seems the ignorant fellow
simply doesn't have the heart
To aid his fellow workers
in the battle of the age.

A few stray stools were with us
but we quickly got their number;
We hightailed all those out of camps
we're rid of them of late;
We found when we examined them
their heads are made of lumber;
It's due to sawdust sausages
the stupid devils ate.

So let's battle on my brothers,
each one helping out his neighbor.
Let's rid the earth of parasites
and all their mangy crew.
Remember that the future
of the world belongs to labor;
The battle is a hard one
and the fighters are too few.
