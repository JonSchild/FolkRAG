Rumor:  Patient employed at the Bomber Plant informed me of the installations 
               of air conditioning and individual lockers which appeared (at this time)
               to be an unnecessary expenditure of money and vital materials. The air conditioning
               equipment includes conduits, electric motors and fans, and
               the amount of metal for the lockers, used mostly for hanging coats and
               hats, seems disproportionate in view of its necessity in more urgent
               fields.

Michigan     Detroit     Reported by
                                       Four dentists, Henry Ford Hospital

Rumor:    A Ford Hospital doctor tells me that Mr. Charles Fruehauf, Detroit,
                 went on a yachting trip some weeks ago and every time he put into
                 port he noticed the same Government boat lying nearby. After several
                 such occurences he pulled his boat alongside one day and asked what
                 this was all about. The skipper in charge of the Government boat
                 said he had orders from Washington to stand by because Washington was
                 going to take over the Fruehauf boat. Fruehauf said: "Well, that's 
                 all right with me if that is what they want." Two days later the boat
                 was taken over. The next day Harry Hopkins came aboard and took a
                 honeymoon cruise with his new wife. The doctor got this straight from
                 a Ford official.
