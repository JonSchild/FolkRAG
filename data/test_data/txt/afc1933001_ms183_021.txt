June 23, 1942

I have arranged with the officials of Camp Belvoir to record
a group of singing soldiers from that post on Thursday night at
6:30.  I have the following names of the men who definitely intend
to come:  Ronnie Stringer, Harold Baxer, Ellsworth Moody, and 
John Reynolds.  There will be, at the most, five more people, but
it will be impossible now to be definite about these names.  These
men will come at 6:30 and will be recorded from the stage of the
Coolidge Auditorium.  The whole operation should be completed at the
latest, by 10:00 p.m.

It will be necessary to pay taxi fare for these men from
Fort Belvoir and return.  The taxi costs $3.00 each way for each
taxi, making a total of $12.00.  They will expect to be reimbursed
for this expenditure at the time they come.  I don't know whether
this is possible, but it would be also nice to provide them with
refreshments.

Respectfully yours,

Alan Lomax, Assistant in Charge
