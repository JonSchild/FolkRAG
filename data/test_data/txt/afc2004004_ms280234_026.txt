Tape 67: BRENDAN BEHAN.
Jingle:
1) O there's some gets married for love,
There's more gets married for riches,
But give me the kind that marries a man
For what he has in his
Bring up the chillet and up the skillet
And beat it with a stick.

2) The man that wears the big
Prick-gelladan had a dog, ready for the job was he,
He gave it to his lady friend to keep her company.
The dog ran in, the dog ran out,
We all went to the hut,
Where do you think the little dog ran
But up the lady's g
Guttery gals, very fine gals,
For now and again they crash,
Take your stuff
Shove it up her
Arse and fish and music box
Oh play it if you can,
To hell with your ohs and bows and all - 
Here comes a policeman.

The Fenian Blade:
O come tell me, Sean O'Farrel,
Tell me why you hurry so?
Hush ye, Farrell, hush and listen,
I seek for Wexford now.
I've orders from the Captain
Get you ready quick and soon,
For the pikes must be together at the rising of the moon.

Joe Brady:
I am a bold undaunted youth and Joe Brady it is my name,
From the chapel of North Dunstreet, boys,
On one Sunday as I came.
To my surprise, who should I spy but Marino and Cockade,
Says one unto the other, boys, here comes our Fenian blade.

2) I did not know the reason why they ordered me to stand,
And I did not know the reason why they gave me such a command.
But when I saw James C arey there I knew I was betrayed,
I'll face death before dishonour, boys, but I'll die a Fenian blade.
