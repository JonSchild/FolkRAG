(stan) one, so....He's gettin' on hungry and stuff, so he goes on
out and here he comes to King's house. And he said to old King
"I'm gettin' hungry and need somethin' to eat." The old King
says "Ah ha! I got a little job out here for you to do, and if
you could do that, I'll give you somethin' to eat." Well, Jack
said "Well, but dad's gotta have somethin' to eat" so he give
Jack somethin' to eat, so he said "I got you a job." So Jack says
"but dads, what is it?" Oh he said "They've animals up here in
the woods and everything. I can't send my men up there, they'll
just kill him. If a wild hog up there, maybe you can go up there
and have a big line(?)." Jack said "Well, I'll see what I can
do" and he went up in the woods and he was just as scared of the
wild boar as I was. And he heard a somethin' come down thru the
woods. And he looked and there comed the awwwfullest wild boar
you ever seed, its (unint.) was that long. And there's an old
log house up there. And Jack took out and it was "whickuteecuck
whickuteecuck, whickuteecuck" -- it was just about to get Jack's
britches. And he went up here in this house, and the boar went
here at the bottom. The boar went down into the bottom, and Jack
shut the door! And he went back and told the King, and he said,
"Well, I got the little old thing up there, I got it up there --
but I don't know if you oughta kill it or not." And they went up
there, King's men did. They shot that wild boar. When it fell
and started kickin', it kicked the whole house down. It kicked 
the whole thing down and all collapsed. Come back and they give
Jack $100. Jack's pretty sharp, you know, he'd go around that wa
and do all these things.

AL: Ray, tell us how Jack got death in a sack, you know, just that par
