Aunt Phoebe Elliott
New Harmony
Indiana

Dear Aunt Phoebe:

The grape wine and the ballad of the house
carpenter make our memory of New Harmony a pleasant 
one.  I want to thank you again for your contribution 
to the Archive of Folk-Song and assure
you of both Elizabeth's and my personal regard 
for you. Please come to see us sometime.

Sincerely yours,

AL:ed
