Subject: HUNGER OF THE EUROPEANS

Conversation which took place in Quogue, Long Island, New York,
in a butcher shop:

All year round resident of Quogue: I am sick to death of this restricted
meat diet--just chicken and lamb and so forth over and over again.
Summer resident: How can you say things like that with the hunger and
starvation in Europe? We have nothing to complain of
and particularly in comparison with those poor people,
All year round resident: Oh, fiddlesticks. I don't believe a word
about the starving Europeans. That is all deliberate Allied [*3*]
propaganda.
