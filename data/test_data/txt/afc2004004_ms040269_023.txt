doors every now and then would
scare the life out of you, on and off-
I think I got about an hour.  And your
Play Called Brandy Andy was on that
same night, and we gained 1st
in that district, and 3rd overall.
So you see we did not lose
by changing our night.
Well, Mr. Lomax, my brother
received his check this morning
as soon as I got it.  The train fare
down was £2-17-6 and all
they allowed for same was £2.8-10
and £3..10... for Subsistance
money for two nights, And we
my brother and I are worried
about the £3 each as if we
send this back we are well out 
of pocket.  So please help us by
finding out, what is to be done
