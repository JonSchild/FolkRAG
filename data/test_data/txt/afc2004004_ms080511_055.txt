The Flight of the Bumblebee and all that.
So here we have ah the ah bluegrass player
playing ah hundreds of notes a second, playing
at demonic speed, ah, totally impassive again,
body not moving, poker-faced, and just the 
fingers going, you see.  All the blackness has
gone out of it, except in the syncopations and 
in the sliding of the hand to, to make the ba
- banjo whine and, and ah, ah get blue notes,
produce blue notes.  This man of course is ah
part Cherokee and proud of it.

Showmen delight in ah hiding just exactly how
they do things from ah the people who are
watching them.  This is also true of musicians.
Ah, they don't sell their secrets easily, and
I think that's part of the ah secret of the
claw hammers or frailing[?] style on the banjo.
The ah whole arm is moved as one piece and the
fingers are, are turned under and the string
- the melody is being picked out with the back
of the thumbnail as it goes down, down, down,
down across the strings.
