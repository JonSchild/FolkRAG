Dear Miss Lomax:

Your letter of February 27 is at hand.  I report to 
tell you that there must be some inefficiency in the 
delivery of mail to your section of the Columbia Broadcasting
System since reply to your first i inquiry was
mailed to you two weeks ago. However, allow me to tell
you again that the bibliography may be obtained from
the Division of Cultural Relations of the State Department, 
Washington, D.C.  This bibliography is included
in the Report of the conference on Inter-American 
Relations in the Field of Music and is dated Sept. 3,
1940. 

If it is possible that you will be in Washington
Saturday night, would it be equally po sable for you 
to send us a wire before you come so that we can make 
provision for you to sleep in Cory's bed?

With kindest regards to you and to your husband-to-be,
believe me, 

Respectfully yours, 
Alan Lomax
