Dear Mr. Downes:

Nick Ray and I have talked over the Fourth of July pageant for
the past several days. We have encountered a number of technical
difficulties and have, at the same time, found some exciting ideas

How much money may be spent on the production.

which a fine script might be built.

Leisler led a successful revolt against the Stuarts and governed New York,
