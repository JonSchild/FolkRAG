Hoarding is not patriotic. 
Most of us Americans understand 
that, but some of us 
don't. The meaning of hoarding 
is- A store or treasure laid 
up secretly. Many people right 
under our noses are hoarding. 
Some of the materials 
that you find people hoarding, 
are can goods, and meats 
those that will not spoil. 
We should all cooperate with 
the war effort. Don't complain 
when you can't get as many 
prs of shoes as you would 
like don't grumble when you 
can't get all the sugar, and 
coffee you want, soon as 
[whenno] we knock the
Axis on the back, we will 
go back to our old way
