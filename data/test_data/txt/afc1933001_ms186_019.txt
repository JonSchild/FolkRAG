Mr. Richard Chase
Proffitt, Virginia

Dear Dick:

I am sort of betwixt and between at the
moment, but I may be able to be of some help on
the USO camp thing later on. Fowler Harper has
resigned from the committee. I suggest that 
you communicate with Doctor Harold Spivacke,
Chief of the Music Division, who is on the
committee. In the meantime, however, my notion
is that you should try to get into work in your
own locality and establish yourself there.

Best regards to you and Mrs. Chase and
Horton Barker.

Cordially yours,

P. S. We have a request from R. C. Archibald who
wishes to have all of our versions of the "Wife
of Usher's Well" for the Mary Mellish Archibald
Memorial Library in the Allison University,
Sackville, New Brunswick. Will you be so kind as
to drop me a card giving me permission to duplicate
your version for him. These records will be used, 
of course, for purely scholarly purposes.
