Conduct of War, Cont'd.
   "There is a lot of talk going around that the contractors on government
construction jobs are getting too much profit.  They feel that on the Des
Moines Ordnance Plant $300,000 as just a handout to the contractor, was too
much.  Labor says if the contractor makes such a big profit, we will have
to ask for more too."   Aug. 7 - Federal official
