From the singing of Miss Kindness Howeth, who got it from her mother.

********************

Two little sisters fair and gay,
Sing I dum, sing I day,
Two little sisters fair and gay,
The boys are the best for me.

Two little sisters fair and gay,
Sing I dum, sing I day
The youngest was Johnny's dear
The boys are the best for me.

I'll be true to your kind love
Sing I dum, sing I day
If you'll prove true to me
The boys are the best for me.

Johnny gives the youngest a fine gold ring,
Sing I dum, sing I day
And never give the oldest a single thing
The boys are the best for me.

Johnny gives the youngest a fine beaver hat
Sing I dum, sing I day
They oldest thought hard of that
The boys are the best for me

Two little sisters walking up the stream
Sing I dum, sing I day
The oldest pushed the youngest in
The boys are the best for me

"Oh, dear sister, take my hand
Sing I dum, sing I day
"And drag me safe into the land,"
The boys are the best for me

"What care I for your hand or glove?
Sing I dum, sing I day
All I want is kind true love"
The boys are the best for me.

Sometimes sink and sometimes swim
Sing I dum, sing I day
Till she come to the miller's dam
The boys are the best for me.
