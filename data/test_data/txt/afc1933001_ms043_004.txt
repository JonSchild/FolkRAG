Dear Mr. Lomax:

We enjoyed your visit with us very much.  I have 
heard many speak of the splendid lecture which you so 
generously gave to us. I look back with the keenest 
pleasure on the day spent with you recording folk songs 
at Newberry.

Mr. Morris has been greatly distressed for fear 
that you may have misunderstood his caution with reference 
to his material.  I can assure you sincerely that he meant 
to imply no distrust of you. Since his career depends to 
so large an extent upon his own use of the material he 
has discovered and collected, he is, naturally enough, a 
little concerned about what might happen if you should 
sever connections with the Library, or if others in authority 
should inadvertently make his material accessible.  
He has a very high regard and admiration for you and your 
work, as we all have, and is keenly distressed at the possibility 
of losing your trust in and regard for him.

Following your suggestion, I have been urging Mr. 
Morris to go to Harvard next year.  He has received aid 
from the General Education Board.  If he does decide to 
go, would you write him letters of introduction to the 
men you know there?

With best wishes.

Sincerely yours,
Clifford P. Lyons
