Reverend Rod.  Reel 6.  P. 4
servant of God, And that is one thing that helps service -- is for people
to have their freedom. The minister shouldn't do all the talking. His
good old Christian men and women in the church can help him a [deed] deal by
their testimony.
You know, when you preach a Gospel,[and] if someone can show by their actions that they have
been affected and changed by the preachment [man], naturally, their acts is
a sermon to the people.
A: Reverend, you know there are some people that don't understant
somebody that shouts in the aisle and jumps and leaps and maybe walks on
benches and all of these things; you know there are some people that
think that's misconduct -- now you and I don't think so. I know
better cause I know that when people have strong emotions they have to
get them out, but what's your answer to that?
[*Shouting - why?*]
R: Well, the man that haven't never had that experience, he haven't go
on far enough with God yet to have that same experience that
that persona have that shouts. [Yet] And then we have evidence in the Scriptures
when the Holy Ghost fell on the [(Diapinnacles?)] day of Pentecost, there was a
shouting, praising God so much so until the people on the outside
thought they were drunk. That same spirit works in the hearts of
people now. Jesus promised to send it as an abiding presence
with us until the end of the [year] age. And whenever we are filled with
this spirit, we will shout. Some people have different ways of expressing
themselves -- of showing the presence of the Spirit in them.
A: Well, what are some of the ways that you've seen, Reverend.
R: Some shouts, [and] some cries, and some just [fall down in the] fold their arms and
walk, don't say anything, but you can see [this presence] the Spirit in um.
A: Have you ever seen this presence realy walk from bench to bench?
R: Oh yeah, I've seem them just go [right] right straight across the [place] benches, just enough
to catch them, just walk from bench to bench.
A: Have you ever see anybody climb?
