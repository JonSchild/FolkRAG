Reverend Roe - Reel 1 - P. 6
R: Yes'm. I knew the fellow but I don't recollect his name. He worked on a
livery stable. It was a dead-end street, up on Texas Street. A dead-end
street, and where was a livery stable and this fellow was the keeper, and
there was a patch that lay along side that road that they had to go out. And
he was in that patch, and they said there was an old burnt stump and it burned
a hole in that stump, kind of a knot-hole, it was there he lay with his
Winchester to shoot those fellows off their horses as they come by and they
never could see him. Yeah, that's what they said up there.
Well, then I left there and I came back to see my father. I stayed there a
short while, and then I left again.
A: How'd you find things at home then?
[*Back home - Then leaves*]
R: Well, everything was prosperous, was getting along pretty well. However,
they missed me, they missed my labor, you know. And they wanted me to come
back and stay at home, but I couldn't see it that way. I see that I could
have a better time, I could make more money and have better opportunities at
other places. So I left there and came to Dallas, worked there a while and
went on to Sherman, Texas. And I made that my home since, principally.
[*Sherman Oklahoma*]
However, in 19 and 2 or 3, 19 and 3, I stayed there at home, I mean at Sherman,
I bought me a place there, and times got so dull, I went on back to Oklahoma
again.
[*Marries*]
Well, I had married then, and my wife, she was teaching a little school up
there, and I's farming. I was a good farmer. I made some money there on
the farm that year. My wife taken sick and I had to send her home and it
was that year that I began preaching.
