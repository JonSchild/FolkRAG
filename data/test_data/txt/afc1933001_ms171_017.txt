Dear Bill:

I just got in from Texas and Mexico City, part business and
part pleasure. I find that no reply to my two letters to you about the 
two checks which I have never received. To remind you - 1 - for the 
M.C. appearance for that hideous banquet and - 2 - the American School
of the Air checks, which your accountants over looked in the process
of making out your stupendous income tax report. About this later item
I am not completely sure, but if you would check with Miss Hinze about this,
it was one of the last 3 or 4 checks.

Mexico is a most beautiful place that I have yet seen, and the easiest 
place to acquire a healthy bellyache. Elizabeth and I spent our time with the bellyache, zooming all over the place from desert mesa to tropical canyon.
I would like to see you. Why don't you come to the place where thing's are
happening. for a visit. We have a couch always made up in your behalf.

With best regards,

Cordially yours,

Alan Lomax
