It has not had that kind of
leadership and it has not got it
now.
The clearest and most convincing
evidence of this is the almost 
incredible mess in which the war
management is steeped - a mess
which, too obvious to be denied, is
gradually being sensed by the
people.

This feeling is well founded. It
is a fact that the real ability and
experience available in America
have been either by-passed or
barred by the administration.

Hopkins and Henderson.

There are plenty of good men
here, but they are not the key
men with the real power. It is not
necessary to call the roll to prove
this.

All one need do is point out that
the two most important figures in
the picture are those of Mr. Harry
Hopkins, who has been directing
the gigantic lease-lend operations,
at the same time acting in various
other capacities; and Mr. Leon
Henderson, who as price administrator
has almost life and death
power over our economic system.

To contend that these two men
are the best in the country for
their jobs is to be absurd.

Nelson Faint-Praised.

And so far as Mr. Nelson is
concerned, while he is honest,
earnest and hard-working, he got

more devastating all the time.

Time for Politics.

And finally, we find the president
and his aides wasting time
and energy of incalculable value
upon political activities, which
force the conclusion that their
thoughts are on the nominee of the
next Democratic national convention.

Few men can consider these 
facts - and they are facts - without
being disturbed. It is unthinkable
to acquiesce in them and it is
not in the national interests to ignore 
them.

Sickened.

Reflecting upon them, it is
rather sickening to be told that
the people must be "shaken out of
their complacency" and made to
realize that the war can be lost.

Of course it can be lost, but
THE PLACE WHERE IT CAN
BE LOST IS NOT OUT IN THE 
COUNTRY BUT IN WASHINGTON,
where confusion and incompetency
reign and politics is
smeared all over the White House
doorstep.
