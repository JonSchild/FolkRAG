2) I'll gae doon to Strichen toon
There I was bred and born,
There I'll get another bonnie laddie

3) But I'll put on my goon o' green,
It's a forsaken token,
That'll let the ploughlads ken
The bands of love re broken.

4) There's many the horse that's slipped and fell,
And rises again full sairly,
There's many a queen that's lost her lad
And gotten another right early.

5) It's aye guid fish into the sea
As ever yet was taken,
I'll cast my line and try again,
I'm only once forsaken.

6) But I'll gae doon to Strichen toon,
And toast my laddie early,
Then he will look at me
And then he will nae gae sadly.
But I'll marry a lad frae Harten toon,
His name is bonnie Robbie,
We'll take a place near Peterhead
A place they called Dunanrovie.
