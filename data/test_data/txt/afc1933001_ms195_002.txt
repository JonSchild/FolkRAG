Dear Duncan,                                 REFERENCE DEPARTMENT 
The attached letter points
an accusing finger at your division.
I should like to help the
New York public get a recording
machine started on its rounds in
New York City.  Meantime, I still
can profitably use one hundred
black twelve-inch discs and some
cutting needles plus some sort of
an agreement about duplicates.
Will you let me hear what
you have decided about this?
Kindest regards,
Alan Lomax
