Blue bells, dummie dummie shells
Evie, ivy, over,
Doctor Brown is a very nice man
He mends his patients as fast as he can.

Here's a poor window, she's left alone,
She has no money  to marry upon.

Come choose to the east, come choose to the west,
Come choose to the one that you love best.

Now they're married and wish them joy
Every year a girl and boy,
Loving each other like sister and brother,
To play the game at kissing-the-gether.

Here we go round the mulberry bush,
The mulberry bush, the mulberry bush,
Here we go round the mulberry bush, 
And round the merrie=ma-tanzie.

This is the way the ladies walk,
The ladies walk, the ladies walk,
This is the way the laides walk,
And round the merrie-ma-tanzie.

This is the way they wash the clothes,
Wash the clothes, wash the clothes,
This is the way they wash the clothes,
And round the merrie-ma-tanzie.

This is the way the gentlemen walk,
The gentleman walk, the gentleman walk,
This is the way the gentleman walk,
And round the marrie-ma-tanzie.

My faither bo't a new top coat,
A new top coat, a new top coat,
My faither bo't a new top coat,
And Alice stole the lining.

Ha ha ha, ye neednie rin,
Ye neednie rin,  ye neednie rin,
Ha ha ha,  ye neednie rin,
Ye'll get your licks the morn.
