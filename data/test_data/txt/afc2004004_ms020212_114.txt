Dear Alan:

The dates we have lined up so far for Bessie and the Group are:

-Salt Lake City. Two appearances on April 22 and 23 for a total of $200 to $250. These are both rather short appearances before small groups. No contracts. They were set up by Rosalie Sorrels, who will be turning her home over to Bessie and the Group while they are in Salt Lake City.
-U.C.L.A. A noon-hour appearance on April 26 for $200.
-Victorville. An evening appearance (on a program with The New Lost City Ramblers and Rita Weill) on April 30. Believe the contracts for this have been forwarded to you and that it was for $125 with transportation provided.
-U.C.L.A.Folk-Music Festival of May 3, 4 , 5.
-Long Beach State College. A noon-hour appearance of 50 minutes on May 6 for $50. We were not happy about this, but $50 represented literally everything in their budget, and it is a very short drive from here. This school has been very good to our performers, and books in only traditional performers. Dr. Carr has promised to over-pay Bessie by as much as possible on her next appearance, hopefully after the start of the next semester. 
-Monterey Folk-Festival of May 17, 18, 19. This is for $1000, but the contracts have not yet been received. We will send them on as soon as they are received. 

We have been pushing the people for contracts on the film and should have something to send to you shortly. 

                                                                 With Best Wishes,
                                                                    Edwin M. Pearl.
