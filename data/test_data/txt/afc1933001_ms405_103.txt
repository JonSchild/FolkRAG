ROLL THAT COTTON DOWN

I hear the bells a-ringing,
I see the Captain stand,
The boat den blows the whistle
I know she's going to land.

Chorus
Roll that cotton down,
Roll that cotton down,
Roll that cotton in Mobile Bay,
Roll that cotton down.

I hear the mate a-shouting,
"Go get out the plank,
And rush out with the headline
And tie her to the bank."
