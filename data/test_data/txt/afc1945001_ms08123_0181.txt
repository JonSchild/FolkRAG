My America. 

My America the land of the free, 
Will hold high the torch of 
liberty. 
She watches and keeps us safe from 
all harm, 
Ready to strike at the first 
dread alarm. 
No matter what her job may be, 
She comes to the front, for you and 
me. 
Over this land the Stars and Stripes 
fly
No one conquer my America, 
Say "I"
