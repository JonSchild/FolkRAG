Dear Alan:

Thought you might be interested in the following letter I just 
received from Edmund Carpenter at San Fernando Valley State 
College:
       "At the moment our plan is to film the Bessie Jones
       group using two, if possible three, 35mm cameras,
       probably Arriflexes, though we might have access to 
       one Mitchell. We have a crane and a dolly; the third
       camera would be on a tripod. One zoom lens. Black and
       white film. Mostly floor lights. The background simply 
       white or gray, and flat to pick up shadow. 
        "We have three sound studios, two designed primarily
        for film and television, the third for recording. 
        Since sound will be crucial, and since little light
        and no real properties are required, I think it would
        be advisable to shoot in the recording studio. 
        "We can run through a rehersal a day before the 
         shooting, using stand-ins, and get the film processed
         in time to make adjustments. The shooting itself can
         be done in one day, if there are no slip ups. I thought
         we would record half a dozen songs, with close-ups of
         hands, feet, faces, as well as medium and long shots."

Thanks for your letter, and I hope that you are able to catch 
the Dillards.

With best wishes,
Ed Pearl
