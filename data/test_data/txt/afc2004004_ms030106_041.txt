Of course, everybody in the city of New Orleans was
always organization minded, which I guess the world knows,
and a dead man always belonged to several organizations, such
as clubs and, well say secret orders and so forth and so on.

the man was fixing to be buried, so you could hear the band come
up the street before they got to the place where the gentleman
was to taken in for his last ride. And they would play different
dead marches, and, on leaving, this would be the march
they would usually [be] start to playing: (Piano)( "Flee as the
Bird to the Mountain."
When they would enter the grave yard--some of them would
call them cemeteries, and so forth and so on--very seldom they
would bury em [them] in the deep. They would never bury em [them] in the mud, they
would always bury them in a vault--[and] when they would leave the
graveyard, as they call it, well, [while] the band would get ready to
strike up. They'd [would] have a second line behind them, well,
maybe, a couple of blocks long, with drum sticks, base ball bats,
and all forms of ammunition, we'd call it, to combat some of the
foe when they come to the dividing line, and, of course, they'd
[would] start--the band would get started, you would hear the drums
