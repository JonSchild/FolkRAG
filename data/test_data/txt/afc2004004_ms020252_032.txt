Roll On Sweet Moment
BJ: I'll be sentenced to my home one day, won't I[?]
TL:  Um-hum.
BJ: Yeah! We're goin' home one day, ha, ha. Jus' do everything --
You know ["Rollin'] "rollin' on" mean that you gonna -- you have a 
hard time. You can't walk on; you got to roll on. Over and over,
up and down, through trials and tribulations, sickness, an' all,
disputes and whatnot. But whatsoever it is, [jus'] roll on through it;
jus' don't stop there; keep rollin', you know? 'Cause one day,
you go to come down. As sore as you're born.
Like this one here. You sing this one here, ["You Better Mind,"] before what was
on my mind -- you can write it down, see.
TL: Yeah.
BJ: [This is my real] 'Cause this the one. Now this song I does when I go up to teach a lesson.
Somehow it always follow me -- mos' all the time.
