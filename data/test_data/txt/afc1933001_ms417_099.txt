Damn trouble with this book is I hope that I don't get sued; I have used a lot of songs without getting permission from the people that wrote them, simply because I couldn't locate these people - they moved, or been moved, or drove off, or any, gone. And if any one knows where these people are, and will write me, I'll be much obliged.
