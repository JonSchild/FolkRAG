35 R. Hicks & Friends

They'd holler and scream. She'd got took, slipped off wigb the boy
that they didn't want her to marry, you see...
And then when they learnt about him, they learnt to love him; he
was a good husband. It's just the way he'd been taught, he hadn't
he wasn't quite as bad as he'd been told he was.

HP: One of our neighbors, you know, the girl ... went to high 
school, and this boy ... and he slipped out and went
to high school and stoled her out and when /they got married they
went back and told her Daddy. He jumped up out of bed, they were
galluses back then, he jumped up out of bed and got his britches
on backwards ... So ... said, "you've got
your britches on backwards." ... said, "it don't make no
difference just so I can catch you." But after they got married,
he was real good to that woman.

AL: It was hard to get married in those days, wasn't it? It 
wasn't easy.

HP: Yeah, we walked down, when we got married, me and my husband,
we walked from our house down to Walnut Mountain in Tennessee. And
I wore a brand new pair of shoes out, I wore the bottom out. And
had to climb a mountain, it was steep, he'd go up and put his foot
behind a bush ... get up the top of that
mountain there ... Walnut Mountain ...
And then we got married, and I was ashamed, I wouldn't eat nothin',
... starve to death. I never eat for three days.
... little girl /slipped these sweet ... at me
and that's why I lived.

AL: Why didn't you eat anything?
