Meanwhile time rolls on.
As I recall I paid out
something near $150[.]00 for incidental
items on the journey (see bill on file). In addition,
[to] the records I ordered from Mr.
Weisner and some express shipments
to me were also charged against
the account. No additional items
could ever have possibly come
in on this transaction; yet Miss
Rogers said to me nearly six months
ago that the accounting department
was waiting for other
items to come in.
I shall be duly grateful
if you can help me If you
can't get all the Library is due me, get
what you can.
Your friend,
John A. Lomax

My best love always to Mrs. [?]

Some relation? or friend of your family
called me by phone recently when I
was in Denver.
