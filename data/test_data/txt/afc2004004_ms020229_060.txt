BJ:  I tol' him, tol' ah, ah, Tom, that was Mary, Mary's husban', the boy that was
married to Mary -- I said, "Hand it here."  I said, "It's mine; I
bought it.  Hand it here."  I started 'cross Tom an'  that thing to git it.
     He said, "Don't aw, break it or nothin'."  Say, "I'm goin' it there to git me
a drink, too."  He said, "I'm goin'. . ." Huh!  He said, said,
"Don't break it."  Hum, hum!  Went right on off an' went into that
same house. . .That's, that's his whiskey.
     He see where us come from, ya see.  Bought it; that was his
whiskey.  Tom said, "Aw, that's that man's own liquor."  But Tom
just dropped it right down by the car, in the grass, ya see.
He said, "Pick it up."  Hu, hu, hu, hu!  I said, "Hand it here!
I bought it an' I'm gonna break it."  Ha, ha, ha!  An' he know

goin' here an' git me some.  Ya ain't got ta drink it all.  (Take
it back if ya wanna. ?)"  Said, "I'm gonna go in there an'
git me some."  Went right on to the same house!  Parked the car
there behind where I was an' went in the same house, police.  That, that
same Georgia Slim.
