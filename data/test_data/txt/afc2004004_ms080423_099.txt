TAPE:  Roll:  25  p.3

(techn.)
AL:   Why are all these mountain songs about dying, anyway?  ---
dying of love.   I mean, people don't really die of love, they just
feel like they're gonna die of love.

Sheila:   I don't know, sometimes . . .

AL:   Do you know anybody that really died of love?   I thought I was
goin' to die of love a couple of times, but I didn't die.   (laughter)

Woman:   Well all these love songs, if they didn't die from love, they
killed each other.  I never seed that person I'd want to kill for!

        :   That's like "Fair Ellender."

Sheila:   Yeah, that's what Cass kept asking me, back when I was
single.   Every time he seed me talking to some man, he started
rubbing his neck, wanting to know if that was the one I'd have my
head cut off for.    (all talk a t once)
