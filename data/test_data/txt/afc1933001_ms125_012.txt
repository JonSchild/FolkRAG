Dear Miss Haney,
    It is gratifying to learn that you are so interested
in collecting folk-songs of your section. I am much interested 
in helping all I can in your singing contest.
    You realize, of course, that to really get the best singers,
and by this I mean, the genuine folk-singers, to participate in
such a contest great tact must be excercised. It would be adviseable, 
I imagine, to divide the contestants according to age, in
say, three groups or four. Fiddlers should compete against fiddlers,
Dulcimore players against others of their kind. Groups against
groups. If it is possible to find groups of children or grown-ups
who know how to dance the Kentucky Running Set or any of the other
traditional forms, they would add a great deal to the fun. Perhaps
you could find other groups to play the old play party games-- Skip
To My Lou, Go In and Out the Window, Green [Grow] Gravel. And it is
especially important to call for traditional songs, secular and
religious, and frown a little on popular songs of the day.
    I hope I have not been presumptuous in offering so much un-asked-for 
advice. If I have , you must forgive me on the ground that I do
not yet know you.
    As to the matter of the participation of one or several counties,
I hate to advise you. It might add greatly to the spirit of the occasion
if several counties entered contestants. On the other hand it would
be possible to supravise the selection of contestants more carefully
