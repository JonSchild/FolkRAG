de man dat was daid, lyin' over in de corner on de coolin' bo'd
wid a white rag wrapped 'round his jaws, he raise up en' say,
       'Is dey done?'
       I say, "Idon' know whedder dey is done or not but I'se
done wid dis place.' De do' wuz too fur away, so I went outs
de winder. My feet got to itchin' an' my body was havin' to
move on. As I wuz purceedin' up de big road I pass by one [?] [?]
school buses whole day. 'Bout de time I went by dere house,
one o' dem men's poked a big brass ho'n out de winder on de
side where I was at and blowed ' da-ti-da-do'. (Imitation of 
taps) I wasn' expectin' nothin' like dat an' I leaned over, and
when I riz up nex' I wuz in Ardmo', Oklahoma. My eyes wuz
stickin' out an' shinin' like de spy-light on a locomobile.
I wuz goin' so fas' when I crossed the T.P. tracks in Ft.
Worth dat my shut-tail ketch afire and made me run faster.
Dat's whut call runnin' yo'self lost. Befo' I could perteck
myself I had run clear outa Texas over into Oklahoma.
