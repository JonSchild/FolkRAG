Reverend Roe. Reel 9 P. 2
A: What?
R: Jonah.
A: What does that mean?
R: You know that Jonah was the one tht God send to Ninevah, and he tried to run away, keep from going.  You read the story, 
haven't you? 
Well he said I was a Jonah.
Wel l, I -- it worried me so til I left there and went in the country out near Paul's
Valley, out to a little country town. And I promised the Lord just if He'd
just let me get settled somewhere that I'd go to preaching. And i
stopped in there, and that was the time I made a crop and my wife
taught school.
Well, so I began preaching, bu the Lord called me to preach because
there was something outside of myself and it wasn't me and it wasn't
school that just pushed me on, that just whilred me, and I just had it
to do. I began preaching there and [?] there on, I had a success;
I wasn't no great preacher, but I tried to live a Christian, and that
in itself helped more than what I could say. There's a whole lot
in you daily life, and if you a Christian, there'll be some things
you can't do. if you try, something will check you.
A: But even a preacher can have, can sin like other men, can't he?
R: Oh yeah [*preachers are tempted], he fall sometime, but he's not gonna lay [down all] there [?] if he's
a god-sent man, brother, he'll get up. yes sir, and then another
thing, he'll acknowledge it and quit it.
A: What are the temptations that a preacher is most liable to?
R: Well, I'll tell you the truth: the greatest temptation to any
male in the world is women. that's our greates temptation-because
that's [on who] what a habit it's nature. And there's so many of us that won't
abide by the laws of nature, [when we] see something, that we just
want to break over anyway, and most of us will sometime. That's the
truth. Of course, there is men that just don't want [anything of it] to acknowledge it
