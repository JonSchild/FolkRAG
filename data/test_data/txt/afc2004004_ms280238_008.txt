Cox: I...up to the present, I ain't forgot anything yet, no that I
know.  I got a good memory - fairly.  I'll try that one, shall I?
(pause).
Lomax:  You're known for your good memory, are you?
Cox:  Oh, I - I don't forget. I - I ain't lost nothin'. (laughs) I
don't forget much.  Some people forget things, you know; not I, I
don't forget 'em.  I have been mixed up sometimes with just one
line, I leave out, An' you go out o' doors, and that'll come to you
Lomax:  When you get mixed up, you go outside?
Cox:  If you go outside, it'll come to you then.  An' if you can't,
then nobody can tell you.  If anybody knows, you tell 'em, "That
ain't right", you won't have it.  Well, that ain't - I don't feel
right that way, you know.
Lomax:  Do all the children in your family have a good memory?
Cox:  I don't think...they never studied things, same as I done.
Lomax:  Why did you happen to take it up like that, Harry?
Cox:  Well, I - I took delight in it.  I was along with my father,
he used to sing these old songs.  I took delight in it.  I liked 'em.
I do now.  I like an old song.  I'd go anywhere if I heard anybody
was goin' to sing up the old songs.  Why I didn't ...now it's hard
to find one.  I wouldn't listen to a song what they make today.  I'd
never take up one to learn.  'Cause there ain't one worth it.  Not
to my knowledge.  They ain't my line.  I've learnt olden times,
and the old fancies and ways, an' that's what I've got to keep in.
An' they can do what they like, an' they ain't got...they can't
sing a song, not wi' any sense in it.  Not like I can. (pause).
