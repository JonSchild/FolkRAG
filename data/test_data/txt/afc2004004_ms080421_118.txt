(Ray:)  I'm a playin' now here on this here harmonica.  I bought 'em,
when I was a boy, the first time I tried to blow on is a little
boy, and it costed 15 cents, and this was found in an old house, maybe
where Jack stayed!  Jack could've played on it, far as I know!
That the reason, it could be 70 or 80 years old, and maybe 100.
This harp come out of Germany.  And the frets in it, of the brass,
play better yet today on the chorus part than on one you can buy
new, now.  It lasted that way, it was found in an old house.  And
I got of it in a junkpile, before they pitched it off and sold it.
This is Reuben, that I played and learnt on it as I come up with
the train.  And so, here now, I play it this way sometimes. . . .
