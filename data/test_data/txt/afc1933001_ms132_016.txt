Mr. Alan Lomax
Fort Wayne, Indiana

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Dr. Spivacke has asked me 
to sen you a note saying that, 
as the last date you have mentioned 
on your address schedule 
is April 14, we will notify the 
Disbursing Office to hold your 
check until you arrive in Washington.  
Is this satisfactory?

Best regards!

Secretary, Division of 
Music
