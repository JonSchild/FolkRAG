1 ---Hannah, doncha you rise no[x] mo',
Go down, ol' Hannah, doncha rise no mo'.
2 Ef you rise in de mornin', bring judgement day,(2)
3 You oughta been on de Brazis, 19 and 10.
They was workin' wimmen, like they do de men.
10 If a man don'know,--- ef a man don' know.
11 It's man lyin' dead on de low turn row.
      It's man lying' dead on ev'y turn row.
9 Oh, de man on de en' a-holl'in', "Bring, 'em, bring on here,"
4 Oh, nineteen ten, it was a mighty hot year,
Nineteen an' ten was a mighty hot year.
12 Go down, ol' hannah, doncha rise no mo'.
