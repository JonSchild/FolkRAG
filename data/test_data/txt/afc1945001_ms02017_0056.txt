large steel company, Alabama, Aug. 3, 1942)

"Did you know why we have not bombed Tokyo again? Because of what

in Japan?" (Street car passenger, Birmingham, Ala., 8/4/42).

who had just been inducted." (Municipal Association official, Montgomery,

he had to bend over to read the dice." (Newspaper reporter,
Anniston, Alabama, August 3, 1942.)

"There was an announcement in the newspapers by Germany that they had

(Professional man, August 7th, 1942, Birmingham, Alabama.)
