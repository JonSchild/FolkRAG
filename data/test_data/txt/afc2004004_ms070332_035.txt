PART ONE--INSTRUCTIONS TO DIRECTORS AND SUPERVISORS
I. Correlation with A Guide to Composite America
The preparation of The American Folklore Guide and A Guide
to Composite America forms a major part of the present program of
the Federal Writers' Project. The Guides will consist of cultural
and social-ethnic studies centering on the following aspects of
the American scene:
1. [Ethic and occupational groups] Social and ethnic groupings
2. Migrations past and present
3. Acculturation (or cultural change and adaptation)
4. Racial attitudes
5. Folk groups and expression
6. Cultural diversity
Together the two Guides will fill in the cultural picture
sketched in the American Guide Series. The work on the [social-] folklore
[ethnic] studies calls for close collaboration with the work on [The] A Guide
[American Folklore Guide] to Composite America. While the emphasis of the [social-]ethnic
studies is on the whole life of a community, the folklore studies
will deal specifically with folk culture and expression. The
preparation of both Guides calls for the intensive use of the
State staffs for [social surveys] primary research and personal interviews. Publication
will be separate, but collection of materials will be cooperative
in the following ways:
