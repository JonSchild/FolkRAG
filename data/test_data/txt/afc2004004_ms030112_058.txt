LARRY:
When you married Rev. Davis, you said he came around one
day playing Spiritual Songs.

MARS. DAVIS:
Oh, yes he did. He came by my house, I was living on,
I was living at 12 South _________ Street near Shaw University.
(space in tape ---- such as Test 2)

LARRY:
He came to a point himself had to accept that.

MRS. DAVIS:
Oh, yes he would talk about being blind but Rev.
Davis was a man being blind didn't worry him.

LARRY:
It didn't by the time you know him and it didn't by the
time I know him, but I guess some where along the line we going
way back maybe to his childhood somewhere, but at some point he
had to get over that he had to too survive.

MRS:DAVIS:
He was really a happy blind man, he never worried about
nothing, he wanted to know about anything how it was. I'd take
him to a movie, I'd explain all through how it was, when we'd 
come home he could tell you as much about it as I could. I never
in my life heard him worried about being blind.

LARRY:
Thats what I said, he got over it.

MRS. DAVIS:
He knew the works of the Lord. And a lot of people
