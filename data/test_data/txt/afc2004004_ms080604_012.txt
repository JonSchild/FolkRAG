the harness on my mule, I could put the collar on, but I
couldn't put the harness on. The mens would put my harnesses
on for me an I could push the collar --put it on the bottom-
uppers, and then push it up on the small part of the mule's
neck, and then twist it around on there --going on to the. . .
