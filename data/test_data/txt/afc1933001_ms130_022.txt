Dear Dr. Fagel:

I am planning a recording trip into Pennsylvania 
for the Archive of American Folk-Song.  As you 
know, the Library of Congress has established the Archive 
with a view to concentrating in one comprehensive 
collection all the folk-song versions collected 
in the United states, particularly those items that are 
or will be recorded.  Pennsylvania, so far as I know, 
has been a sadly neglected by the recording machine and 
it is most important forward step in building the Archive 
to add to it records from Pennsylvania.  I am 
sure that you will be interested in collaborating in 
this effort and I should appreciate any suggestions 
you might be able to offer.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant In Charge
Archive of American Folk-Songs
