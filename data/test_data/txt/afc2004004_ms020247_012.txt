'GATOR (I'M GONNA GET ME A 'GATOR)

I'm gonna get me a 'gator, (clank)
Oh gal,
When I come off the Island, (clank)
Oh gal,
I'm gonna bake him an' fry him, (clank)
Oh, gal,
When I come off the Island, (clank)
Oh gal,
Well, that's a big, bold 'gator, (clank)
Oh gal,
When he come off the Island, (clank)
Oh gal,
I'm gonna bake him an' fry him, (clank)
Oh gal,
When you come off the Island, (clank)
Oh gal.

I'm gonna run from the 'gator, etc.
When he come out the Island, etc.
I'm gonna bake him an' fry him, etc.
When he come out the Island, etc.
Well, that's a great, big 'gator, etc.
When he come out the Island, etc.
I'm gonna bake him an' fry him, etc.
When he come out the Island, etc.

I'd like to make that gravy, etc.
Out the big, bold 'gator, etc., etc.
