Dear Miss Schrager:

I have your very kind letter of May 14, and wish to thank you most sincerely
for your offer of securing me a scholarship as soon as I have any
definiteprospects of coming to the U.S.A. I am afraid however that my
prospects are and will remain exceedingly vague unless a scholarship can
be found in advance to satisfy the immigration authorities. I have no
relatives in America to support me and the National Refugee Service are
not in a position to provide affidavits; Professor M.J. Herskovitz of Northwestern 
has given me a moral affidavit and Dr. Donald Goodchild has a file
on my work and publications; both gentlemen have promised to help in finding
me a research fellowship on American Negro Music; Northwestern is actually
carrying my name on its "preferred list of "forthcoming fellowships--but
meanwhile more than twelve months of internment have gone by without bringing
the treasured goal any nearer. Now, since the State Department has declared
its "readiness to recognize a full scholarship as sufficient guarantee"
(I am quoting Dr. Alvin Johnson) there appears to be a little more hope, but
again this does not really help me as long as I have not secured a scholarship
fellowship or lectureship. I was advised to write Dr. Alan Lomax of the
Library of Congress whose attitude towards American Negro Folk Music is so
strikingly similar to my own, but have not found the courage to do so, even
though few jobs would please me more than under his guidance. When I was
working for the B.B.C. in London I often played the records he sent us
(Leadbelly and others), wishing that one day I could go out recording, indexing,
and transcribing that magnificent music for the Congress Archives.
Perhaps something could be done there. Please do let me have your advice.

Yours sincerely,

Ernst Bornemann
