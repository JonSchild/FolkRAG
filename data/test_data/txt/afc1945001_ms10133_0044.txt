[??????] N.M.

(1) Jap's going to win this war. (How do you know
ask another individual.) Because we white,
and colored folks are not together.

(2) How are you going to get by the Draft
Board Jim? Well I'll eat some O.K. soap
make my heart beat faster.

(3) Those Russian's fight like Hell, but
if they have kill all the Germans, they
say they have there would be no
Germans.

(4) What have the Jap's and German's done to me
not a thing, nothing, why should I give my
life, and what for, but I am going to because
I am a true American

(5) Our men are all right at home
but not in a fix these Rommel
men are.
