[Read 'Em, John]

[*fun time?*]

John was driving an old mule named Jack, and Jack got 
tired on the road. John said, "Come up, Jack." Jack just looked
around at John. So John report back to him, say, "Come up, Jack."
Jack looked around and say, "I been comin up for thirty years,
I ain't comin up no more."

John broke for the house and told old massa--"Jack talkin."

Old massa say, "You lyin, John. I believe you lyin again."
So, well, John carried him down to where old [Jack] mule was standin
in the road. Old massa hadn't so much as walked in seven years--
had John to carry him wherever he had to go. Then old John tell
that mule, "Come up, Jack."

Old mule looked around and say, "I been comin up
for thirty years, I ain't comin up no more." Scared old
massa and he went to runnin. Run till he come to a big oak tree.
Couldn't run no more. Set down to rest. And his little fiste dog
set down right b[y]eside him. Both of um just pantin. Old massa
say, "Lord, I ain't run so much in seven years." [Litt]

"Little fiste say, "I ain't neither."
 Then old massa really run sho nuff.

Who was John anyway? ... He was an old man back in slavery time, a real sensible old man.
See, he tried to get out of as much work as he could. He was smart, a smart old man.
