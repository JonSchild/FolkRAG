would like you to name
a date, meeting place and
time, preferably not too
late in the day so that I can
return in the early evening 
You mentioned in one
of your letters that the producer
was interested in seeing me
too, and I would naturally
like to see him.  Have you
a sail plan or any pictures
of the Pequod, as is she
lying anywhere near 
so that I could look
her over?  How big a
crew will she have for
the film.  This is an important
point for the tempo of
the Chanties and indeed
the selection of the Chanties
must be governed by the 
number of men on the
ropes.  A big crew will
be hauling much faster
than a small one.  All this
we can discuss when we meet 

Sincerely yours
H [?M] Rasmussen
