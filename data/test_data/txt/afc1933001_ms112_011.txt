Dear Johnny: This war is turning 
over my apple cart, too. I've 
got to hit the road again with 
my feeble "Yoodle, yoodle" Yesterday 
I tired myself out at the 
C.J.A. in Denton and afterwards 
the girls nearly mobbed me. 
Never have I had such an 
ovation. And I enjoyed it 
more than they did. Only I wanted 
to kiss all the pretty ones and 
didn't, even when they crowded 
the entire stage and  trooped 
close around me.
     
This morning Miss
Terrill hurried off an envelope 
to you before I got ready.
