Dearest Alan and Elizabeth,

It's a hot day and I'm waiting looking out over the blue bay for
two of the older girls to come up and audition The Bourgeois Blues. I had
sung it to the counsellors with much acclaim and somehow or other the kids
must have heard it because these two girls-- about sixteen and fifteen-- came
up to me in much secrecy and asked me to sing it to them. I think they suspect

to play jazz on the piano from one of the councillors here who is really
very good.

The Library certainly sounds to be a humming place right now.
Have you written Taylor? If that doesn't come through, do you think there's
any use in my coming to Washington and trying for a project position? The
documentary jobs sound wonderful and so does the Fisk University thing-- I'd
give my eye teeth for some of that work. Helen Ross has suggested that I write
to the Rosenwald Fund and see if they have jobs to fill-- she says she'll
