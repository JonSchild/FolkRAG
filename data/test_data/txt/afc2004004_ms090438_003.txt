1. One Tuesday night in April. Between 11 and 12 O,clock
A tragedy happened in Natchez. that will never be for got.
A crowd of youngsters gathered, fill of joy and glee.
when a fire of unknown Origin destroyed two hundered and three.

(CHORUS)
2. it was a sad time in Natchez,
where so many people died,
Dead bodies were piled up
Almost shoulder high.

2. The night was Calm and Beautiful, the skies were bright and fair
The Crowd was Gay and Jubilant. and knew not death was there.
They were eating. drinking, and smoking, dancing and having a time,
And in less than half hour, hundereds of people were dieing.

3. The place was once a church house, and used for the service of God,
But laters turned in to a blacksmith shop then to a dancing hall.
There,s where the people were gathered so we are informed,
And were dancing to the Music of the Famous Walter Barnes.

4. The building was crudely constructed covered over with galvanize
Tin, twenty feet wide, two hundered feet long, with one door to enter in
Satan had them bewildered and lured them into his den, 
Then sent a sudden destruction and destroyed both Women & men.

5. Fire broke out in front people ran to the rear,
Moans, Groans, and screaming were pitiful to hear.
the smoke had them blinded so they could not see;
Men, Women, and children cried lord have mercy on me.

6. They trampled on each other, in an effort to break through,
But seeing their efforts were futile cried lord, what shall we do?
The orchester continued and was playing soft and low, 
While many helpless victims lay dieing on the floor.

7. There were numbers of people there, whose name was on church rolls,
But what is the hope of a hypocrite when god takes away his soul
joined to their idols like Ephrams---estray
sitting on the seat of the scornful, standing in the sinners way.

8. some of them were refined and cultured; highly honored on
earth, claimed to have been converted, and to have had the spiritual birth
Some teachers in the sunday schools, some singing in the 
choirs; but alas like sol they played the fool, and perished in the fire.

9. After the ball was over and news was broadcasted around.
Doctors, medicines, and nurses rushed there from near by
Towns. all hospitals were crowded, some were treated at home,
The exact number of injured will probably never be known.

10. Women obey your husbands, husbands love your wives
Together raise your families and live quite lives
Shun all bad company, and dives were sinners go
The fate that happened in Natchez could be mine or yours.
