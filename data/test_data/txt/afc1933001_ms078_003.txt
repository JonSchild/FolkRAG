Dear Miss Sinclair:

     I am replying to your letter of January 2 which has just
reached me. Professor Reed Smith of the University of South Carolina,
Columbus, South Carolina has written much about the survivals 
of English Ballads in this country. I think his articles have appeared
in various folklore journals, some of which have been read before
Modern Language Associations. If he'll take the time to tell you, I 
think he can locate every one of the Child ballads that have been 
discovered in this country. If you will recall, Phillip Barry, of hoambridge,
who died recently, spent his whole lifetime looking up ballads
of the northeastern states. Much of his work has not yet been
published, but you will discover through various manuals where
to find his published articles. He was a very reliable and careful
investigator.
     Mrs. H. H. Flanders, Smiley Manse, Springfield, Vermont; 
has two books which might be interesting to you, namely: The New
Green Mountain Snogster, Yale University Press, New Haven, 1939 and
Vermont Folk Songs and Ballads, Stephen Daye Press, Brattleboro, Vermont,
1931. Folk Songs of Old New England by Eloise Linscott, MacMillan
and Company, 1939, New York, Main Woods Songster by Phillip
Barry, Mary W. Smyth and Fannie Eckstrom, Joanna Colcord's Songs of 
American Sailormen, W. W. Norton Co., New York.
     If I had your job I would go to a complete file of the 
Journal of American Folk Lore, also. Professor George Lyman Kittredge,
of course, has done more in the field than any one else.
He has retired from teaching as you know, and is now editing Shakespeare.
I feel sure he would have time to help you. I feel, also, that
the Harvard Library is your best single source. To that Library has 
flowed all of the works of Professor Kittredge and also many of his 
student's for the last 50 years.

                                                                         Sincerely yours,

                                                                          John A. Lomax
                                                                          Honorary Curator of the Folk Song
                                                                          Archive
                                                                          Library of Congress
