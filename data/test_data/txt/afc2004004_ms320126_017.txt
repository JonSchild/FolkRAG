Wasn't any insurance in those days was there?
EDWIN
No.
A. LOMAX
You just had to take whatever they'd give you.
EDWIN
Whatever they'd give you.
A. LOMAX
And how was the pay?
EDWIN
The pay was big money in those days.  It wasn't much, but
that was big money.
A. LOMAX
That's why all the Cajuns went into the oil business.
EDWIN
Well, a lot of them went to work in the oilfield because,
well, there wasn't much. . . .it was better than farming.  In
fact, you'd make more money in the oilfield than you would
make as a bootlegger or secretary.
A. LOMAX
So, naturally the oilmen had all the girls in the place
chasing them.
EDWIN
(laughs)  It's a possibility.  But the girls was pretty hard
to find in those days, they wasn't that loose, uh-uh.  Now
you got to go to Spindletop in Texas, it's a funny thing in
Spindletop, you know what Spindletop is, you from Texas.
The rigs were so close, you'd believe this, when a man went
in a hole, the other fellow had to be out of the hole, 'cos
he couldn't go in.  When this guy pulled out, he went in and
drilled awhile.  They'd criss-cross a hole.  So when one of 
'em found the oil sand he'd set casin', the other man had to
use a whipsock to go around him.  They call it a whipsock.
They come up there. . .but they'd see which of 'em got to the
oil first.
