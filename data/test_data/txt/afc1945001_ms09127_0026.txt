The Stamp Situation
It seems that the boys and
girls aren't so very interested in buying
defense stamps.  In every class I go, 
I asked some boys if they had bought 
some stamps.  Their answer was, "What
good will that do us," and that they
could buy something much more
worth buying.  It shows most of
these children don't have the
spirit that they should have. 

I have now two $25.00 bonds, 
and I'm still buying stamps.  We all
know that we would be gaining if 
we bought stamps; they are a profit to
us, and we are only doing our part to
help win the war. 

If we can't go out and
take our part out in the front line, the least
we can do is to buy at least one or two
stamps every Thursday.
