Miss Sidney Lee Hemphill
Senatobia, Mississippi
Dear Miss Hemphill,
How sorry I was to get your letter and
hear of the death of your father. Sid
Hemphill was one of the really remarkable,
original musicians of Mississippi. His 
name and his music will live on long
after him.
Enclosed is a check, which the family
can probably use in this time of sorrow. 
My deepest sympathies to all of you.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
