CAJUNS-LOMAX  -13

to defy them.  The, there was a, as we'll find out, this is
a part of the background of the Cajun culture.  Very, very
strict in relationship to sexual ideas.  Women were
sacrosanct.  And a virtuous woman of one kind and then all
the others were in another category.  And this song is a 
testament to the old Hugeugenot Catholic attitudes of, 
towards sex.
     Well on another trip going out in the country
I was looking for the black French music.  And some friends
of mine took me after dark to a church where they put on a 
kind of processional dance.  Three young men sat down and
made their music without anything but their hands, their feet
and their voices to make it.  And it sounds like something
right out of Africa.  As they sang this they paraded around
the church and couple by couple, not crossing their feet
because that would be sin, but sliding their feet along the,
along the ground.
     And it turns out that this was the baseline
for the, it's a music called [jeurez, jeurez, my lord].  And
here we find a group of young blacks still keeping the 
tradition on, on a front porch in Louisiana.
     Now jeurez leads into the [zidaco] tradition
which is the Ca, black Cajun music, quite different from the
French, much more emphasis on percussion with a, accordian
in the lead but a percussion, the, a hot rhythmic background
