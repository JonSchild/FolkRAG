     They should h ave the feelin all right, but when you 
don't see nothin befo you but hard work, what the dickens you gon
do bout it?  GOT NO OTHAH WAY TO LIVE.
     Sometimes yo husband or yo sweetheart go a whole solid
week, an don't even know what it is, you know.  To bothah you.
You understan?  Sometimes two weeks.  Ain't bothahin nobody else
but you.  Understan?  He come in.  Cos yit an still, he realize you
been doin some kina hard wuk.  H e come to you an say, "Darlin, lissun.
I know you don't feel so good but could you come to my apartment.
I done gone as fur as I can go widout you.  You stretch a lil an
let him have a time.  You say,  "Well honey, jes let me 
lay down.  I'm so tired.  In a lil while maybe I'll feel like it."
Sometimes you give ovah to him, you don't feel nowheres nesh bein
bothahed.  Yet theah is cause -- the length of time you had
went -- cause you not to be excused.  Yo care
that you have fur him not excuse you.
     (Recording goes haywire.)
      When you've done everything you can to cure a dog of
suckin aigs, kill that dog.  When you've done fur a man when you
feel lak it, an when you don't feel lak it, an h e had him some
stuff, kill that man.  But if you ain't done fur him, you ain't got
no right to kill him.  Cause you ain't done what you oughter
done.Thass right.  Ain't no use swellin up if you didn't do right.
You jes got to do whether you feel lak it or no.  Jes go when you're
call.  That bad feelin will go when you git started.  If it don't
leave, you'll soon git ovah me.  Thass all.  An ef you wear yo'sef
out, fo God's sake, weah yo'sef out wid one man or one woman!
Then you know who to call on.
