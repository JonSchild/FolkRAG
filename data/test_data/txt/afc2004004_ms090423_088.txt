night a man came in here with a red wagon he had bought." 

In regard to our study, Professor Wright suggested that we begin 
the first of November instead of the first of October because the people 
were too busy at this time and the plantation owners would be unsympathetic 
as well as the people themselves disinterested. Mr. P. F.
 Williams suggested that the study begin the middle of November. He 
thought the first too early. He said these people haven't had an opportunity 
to earn money in a long time and they are going to be intent on 
that. He offered full cooperation and asked that I call on him for any 
assistance he might be in position to give. 

Mr. D. F. Crampton, superintendent of schools in Coahoma County
pledged the cooperation of the teachers in the county. My request of him 
was that teachers spot leaders in ring games and the musicians in the community. 
I said that there would be no request for any of their time from 
their school duties. he said that he would be glad for them to give time. 
He offered to have schools arrange game fest days on afternoons just for 
us. 

The new Jeanes supervisor in the county is Mrs. Lillian S. Rogers 
who was at Indianola and worked with Powdermaker and Dollard. She offered
to be of any assistance we requested of her. Crumpton suggested the former 
Jeanes supervisor who has been demoted to a classroom teacher, as of possible 
assistance. She is Miss Ernestine Powell. Mr. Ammons, the county 
farm agent was enthusiastic about the project. He covers the county with 
his movie projector and educational films. He also has a record player. 
He suggested that we give him several of our records and he would play them 
at his gatherings and tell the people to brush up their repertoires and prepare 
themselves for our coming. He said he would not begin his community
