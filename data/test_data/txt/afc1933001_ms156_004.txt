Mr. Alan Lomax
Columbia Broadcasting System
New York City, N. Y. 

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I know your work takes you over the countryside, but I wonder 
if it is possible that you did not get my letter of March 22.

Because of the early meeting, the deadline for speakers and 
titles on the program bulletin was April 1. I debated what 
to do: thought it very likely you were not in Washington, then 
simply went ahead and chose your title.

The blanket subject for that afternoon's program is on reading 
interests of young people. So I sent A. L. A. this title: 
"Young America's Heritage of Folk Ballads". I'm terribly sorry 
to have done this, but I didn't want it to come out with just 
a noncommittal 'Address', sounding like a Memorial Day oration.

There is one more program which is given to the people who 
attend A. L. A. If you want that title changed and will let 
me know by April 10, I'll get word to Headquarters.

And I'll answer your other questions just as soon as I hear 
from you about the title.

I'm sorry to know of your illness and only hope that it hasn't 
continued.

Sincerely yours,

[*Lesley Newton*]
(Miss)    Lesley Newton
               Chairman
