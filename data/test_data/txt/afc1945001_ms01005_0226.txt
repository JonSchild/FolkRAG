Mr. Felix Fantus
139 North Clark Street
Chicago, Illinois

Dear Mr. Fantus:

            Thank you for your letter of September 23rd, which
Mr. Davis has requested that I answer for him, since the
subject of rumors is one which comes under the responsibility
of the Bureau of Intelligence.

            We feel that it would be very helpful to a proper
analysis of rumors to have a constant stream of them coming
to Washington, as gathered by local listening posts. We are
not so certain, however, that local attempts to refute rumors,
rumor by rumor, will be productive of beneficial results.

            Studies undertaken by this Bureau show beyond a
reasonable doubt that rumors are as much a product of anxiety
of one kind or another on the part of the rumorer as they are
the result of Axis inspiration. Much more so, in fact.

            A rumor clinic which has an outlet through a newspaper
or newspapers might tend to increase the public's tension and
anxiety and thereby produce more rumors.

            We are preparing a statement of our findings about
rumors for study by just such people as yourself, responsible
citizens who are anxious to analyze rumor content. Just as
soon as copies of this are available several will be sent to
you for distribution to your group.

            We trust that when you have received this material you
will consider the entire matter in the light of the new evidence
and that you will let us know what you propose to do.

                                                                Sincerely yours,

                                                                R. Keith Kane
                                                                Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
