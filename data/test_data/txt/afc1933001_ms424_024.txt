AIN'T GOIN STUDY WAR NO MORE
(Negro)

(Page 32 - Folk Songs of Many Peoples, Vol.II.)


I'm goin' lay down my sword an' shield,
Down by the riverside (3)
I'm goin' lay down my sword an' shield,
Down by the riverside.
Ain't goin' to study war no more.
I'm goin' put on my long white robe.
I'm goin' put on my starry crown.
I'm goin' put on my golden shoes.
I'm goin' talk with the Prince of Peace.


DEEP RIVER 
(Negro)

(Page 61 - Y.W.C.A. Song Book.)


Deep river, my home is over Jordan.
Deep river, Lord, I want to cross over into camping ground.
Deep river, my home is over Jordan.
Deep river, Lord, I want to cross over into camping ground.
Oh don't you want to go to that gospel feast?
That promised land where all is peace?
Oh! deep river, Lord, I want to cross over into camping ground.
