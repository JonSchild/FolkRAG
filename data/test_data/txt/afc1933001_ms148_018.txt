Mr. Frederick R. Bellmar
Glen Arbor, Michigan

Dear Mr. Bellmar:
John A. Lomax tells me that he
heard your "Gambler's Song" nearly
forty years ago when ye was a boy in
Bosque County, Texas. I would, naturally,
be delighted to receive the full
version of the song from you. I hope
you will be able to find the rest of
the "Letter Song". The melody is, as
you say, unusually beautiful and if in
the next few months you are able to
find and write down for the Archive of
American Folksong in the Library of
Congress more of your grandmother's
favorites, we should be happy to receive
them.
Thank you in behalf of my father
for your kind letter.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
