STUDENT COUNCIL

A Student Council now works with the faculty
and the D.O.C. in the administration of the school.
The aim is a maximum of administration from
above and a maximum of participation by the students.
Therefore the Student Council helps in 
determining all policies of the school, including
questions of curriculum, faculty, fees, and recreation
activities.

OTHER COURSES

The curriculum of the school is designed to be
flexible and to meet the needs of the student. If
a sufficient number of students indicate interest in
any course not listed in this folder, the school will
make every effort to secure an instructor and arrange 
for such a class.

The special class held every Friday night during
the last term at the Garnett Patterson High
School for the laundry, domestic and cafeteria
workers is an example of the school's effort to extend
its facilities to all the workers of the District
of Columbia.
