TAPE 41. . .JOHN STRACHAN.
Johnny More: (Johnny Cock)

1) There lives a man in Rynie's land
And another in Achindore,
But the bonniest lad amang them a'
Was lang Johnny More.
Hi-diddle-a-lilden-a-dee,
Hi-diddle-a-lilden-ee.

2) Young Johnny was a clever youth
Both sturdy, stout and strong,
And the sword that hung by Johnny's side
Was fully six feet long.

3) Johnny was a clever youth
Both sturdy, stout and wecht,
And he was full three yeards aboot the waist
And fourteen feet in height.

4) And if al be true that they do say,
And if all be true ye hear.
Long Johnny's gone to fair England
The King's standard to bear.

5) He hadna been in fair London
A year but barely three,
When the fairest lady in all London
Fell in love with young Johjny.

6) The word's gone up and word's gone down,
And word's gone to the king,
That the muckle Scot had fallen in love
With his daughter, Lady Jean.

7) And if al be true that they do say,
And all that you tell me.
This mighty Scot shall stretch the rope,
And hanged he shall be.

8) But out it spoke young Johnny then,
The words pronounced he,
"Well I hae strength to wield my blade,
You darena all hang me."
9) But the English lairds is cunning rogues,
And round him they did creep.
They gaed him drams o' muckle mead,
Till he fell fast asleep.
