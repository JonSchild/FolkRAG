ONCE THERE WAS NO MOON
A moan
Once there was no moon,
Lawdy, once there was no moon,
Once there was no moon,
Lawdy, I heard the angels singin':

CHORUS:
This sad old world, (3)
Lawdy, I heard the angels singin'.

Once there was no sun, etc. (CHORUS)
Once there was no man, etc. (CHORUS)
Once there was no star, etc. (CHORUS)
Once there was no light, etc. (CHORUS)
Down on my knees, etc.
One mornin' soon, etc.
Do pray for me, etc.
All around my head, etc.  (Chorus)

Down in this world, 
We are here below,
I heard the angels singin',
Trouble'll knock at every do',
I heard the angels singin'.  (CHORUS)

One good thing
My mother done,
I could hear the angels singin',
Taught me to pray
When I was young,
I heard the angels singin'.

Lawd, I feel so glad, etc.  (CHORUS)

The 10th and 11th verses are sung to the
same tune as the chorus.
