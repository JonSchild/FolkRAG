1  A Story about Hitler,
   Hitler was riding through a country
village in Austria and he stopped his 
car by the roadside where he saw
an Austrian farmer spreading manure
over his land for fertilization.  Gun
in hand, he spoke harshly, "You are
a pig so eat the manure," and the
farmer ate the manure.  Hitler said
eat some more," and he ate some more,
then Hitler slipped and fell, dropping
his gun and the Austrian scrambled
for it and stood up, pointing the
gun at Hitler, "Now Frau Hitler you
eat the manure." After Hitler  had
begun eating, the farmer dropped
the gun and started running across
the field to his farm house, calling
Bianca!  Bianca!  I just had lunch
with Hitler!!
