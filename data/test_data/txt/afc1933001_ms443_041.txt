Angola

They had thrown him out of Mooringsport, but Lead
Belly landed in Angola on his feet. Here was an environment he
was completely able to cope with, and, even though
Angola was a harder, more snappy sort of a place, than Sugarland,
Lead Belly got on well.. He was soon transferred to
Camp A where the best field hands and musicians on the farm were gathered together
by Captain Reaux, the dour little Frenchman.  There he got a 
trusty job washing, with the help of one assistant, all the dirty
clothes and sheets of the camp -- a herculean task -- three hundred, 
suits of underwear, three hundred pairs of canvas britches,
three hundred canvas coats, three hundred sheets, 
a week; then every summer six hundred army blankets.  A terrific
job it was, especially with a lazy assistant.  But he liked
the work, he liked to see the long lines of clean, striped coats
hanging in the sunshine.  It if hadn't been for his lazy helper 
everything would have been as fine as it could have been in the
pen; and Lead Belly could have endured the man's sucking if he 
hadn't gone telling tales to the captain.  When Lead Belly
heard of this, he got the man in the wash-house one day, closed 
the door and, choking him with one hand so he couldn't 
scream, slapped him with the other until the fellow couldn't stand up. He knew his assistant wouldn't 
report him, because both of them would get a whipping and they were
both equally afraid of Captain Reaux with the strap in his hand.
