When the Germans hear that 
there are American soldiers, sailors,
or marines straving in some country
they well come & attack them
because they think they are too weak
to fight or handle a gun. Our
American forces have gone through
a lot of trouble but they keep on
fighting until they die. Some of
the people at home do not think 
about that and spend there money
foolishly & do not buy bonds &
stamps that will give our men
food, clothing, medine & gun to
use. Many people should stop
and think about this war & what
they are going to go through in years
if they don't help win this war.
Stop wasting money & do some good
thing with it. Buy bonds & stamps
know.
