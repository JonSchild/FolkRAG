It seems Mortimer Miles didn't want 
to go[t] to the Army, so he thought 
he would play deaf so he wouldnt 
have to go. The next day he went 
down to the recruiting station and 
informed the doctor that he was 
deaf. Well the doctor yelled and tried 
every way he knew to get mortimer 
to hear him, But mortimer just 
wouldn't, So the doctor finnaly gave 
up and said O.K. You can go. 
Mortimer jumped up and ran over 
the door, But the doctor said wait a 
minut bub you can hear o.k.
