Although this letter is complicated, I hope it covers all the
problems and will stand as a letter of agreement between us with
no further changes or additions.  I purposely kept it loose so
as to leave you free to handle things at your and as you can.  I
also hope that you understand that I am not haggling.  When I
first agreed to this trip with Jon Kankake, I thought that there
would be two or three other dates for the group which would enable
them to accept for what amounts to a week of their time, travel-
ing and singing, a fee of $100.00 per person.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Lomax

P.S.  Since dictating this letter, we have received a letter
from Nancy Forte of the Walker Art Center agreeing on the fee
of $150.00 for the children's program at 3:00 PM, Sunday,
February 9.  The program will include all five singers and
last between one and one and a half hours.
If this letter is agreeable to you, please sign it and send it
to John Davis with the bus tickets and suggested departure  time,
making certain that they will arrive, through possibly bad
weather, in time for the concert.
