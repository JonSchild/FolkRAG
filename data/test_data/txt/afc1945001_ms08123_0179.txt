Ida Louise Scatt
He who laughs last laughs best
Company "C" had been drilled
by a very strict efficient sergeant
for many months. One day he
was replaced by a much younger
less experienced officer. The men
loudly revolted and in scorn
kept repeating the phrase "And a 
little child shall lead them"
The next morning there appeared
on the bulletin board the following
notice. "There will be a twenty mile
hike today for Company "C"; and
a little child shall lead them on 
a "big horse."
