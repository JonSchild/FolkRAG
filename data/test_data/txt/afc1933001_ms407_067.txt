BALLAD OF A BALLAD-SINGER
[* 1934-35 *]


John Lomax searched for folk song
Under Southern boughs,
'Mong the pickers in the cotton fields
And the singers in the barrel house,
And the road gangs heaving hammers high
To a work song with a golden cry.

Down in Louisiana
The convicts sing long.
Though prison walls are high and gray
Their halls are stored with song.
Such wealth John Lomax found at last
Where shackled Negroes shuffled past.

In a cell at Angola, 
Marked by stripe and bar,
There sat the self-acknowledged king
Of the twelve-string guitar,
And he could sing as long as you please
To charm the birds right out of the trees.

He was big and he was black
And wondrous were his wrongs,
But he had a memory travelled back
Through at least five hundred songs. 
When his fingers gave those strings a twang
Like a very god in heaven he sang.

He sat there in his striped suit, 
He sang like Kingdom Come.
At the end of day, when his voice was mute,
John Lomax sat dumb, 
Then wrung his hand without a word
For the marvellous ballads he had heard.

And Lead Belly said to Lomax,
"I have written a song 
For a pardon from the Governor,
Since my sentence is long; 
As I sang to Governor Neff of late
When he pardoned me from Texas State.
