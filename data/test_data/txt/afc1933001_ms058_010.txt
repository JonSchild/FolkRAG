Dear Mr. Spivacke:

Please send to me at
Merryville, La. (you may have
to use Parcel Post) 25 twelve
inch records. Before we
leave here we will ship
you 75 filled records. In
nearly every instance Miss
Terrill is including typed
copies of the words contained
on each record; also the
slang of the song and the singers.
This will be a big saving for
the Library. Writing down the
words from the record
playing is a long, tedious job.
