Ray: Now back in the last of.....(AL: Start again))....
When people got married it was rough on 'em, they would serenade
and they would try to hide it, to keep 'em from knowin' when they
got married. And when they found it out, they'd slip that night,
and 'shoot Danny night'(?). And then they'd get the man out, and
ride him on a rail, and then another one would get on his legs, and
they'd about kill him. And they rid the girl in the washin' tub.
And that's what they called serenating(?) them. And it was rough
on 'em, he wasn't able to do much when he.....
Stan: Back in the days he's talkin', I helped serenate a lot of them
(unint.). And, before you got married that way, you'd always (un-

So we went one night to serenate a feller and he hid from us.

the boy. He'll run on back, just get him, and bring him back."
You just had to get 'em and carry them out you know. They'd put
up a pretty good battle. So we had a rail, a good long rail, yOu

boys got 'em. And we took him out there, and you had to (unint)
and it's pretty bad you know, ridin' on a sharp rail...
AL: Kinda bust 'em up in the middle...
Stan: Yeah, it hurts 'em in there you know, and on the (laughs) and
so...we put the woman in the washin' tub, and put a stick to it,
so she couldn't get out, you know, over her legs....and we carried
it I'd say about a half a mile down there, and then we let her out, 
let 'em off at the rails and they'd have to walk back to the house.
And then, we'd take the dynamite, and got one without the fuse one
