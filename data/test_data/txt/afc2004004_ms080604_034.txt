A.L.:

W.B. & W.S. Hart:
     (in unison)  He'd just blow. . .
W.B.:
     Whooop!
W.S. Hart:
     Whip!
W.B.:
     And when he did that, sumpin was goin ta
happen.  (laughs)  You could go to him an tell im --I used to
go to him all the time, I said, "Mr. Charlie, I need some
money."  He'd say, "What you goin to do with it?"  And I'd say,
"It ain't none of your business, if you gon let me have it."
--I tol you I've been always crazy-- I said, "That ain't none
of your business if you gon let me have it."  "Whoof!  You know
your talkin to Mr. Charlie?"  I said, "That's what I thought
I was doin?"  He say, "Well. . what you want?"  I say, "I want
a hundred dollars."  "Ain't that much money in the camp."
I say, "See, you wrong" I say, "Cos I got more than that
in my pocket."  I used to just tease him. Said, "You're wrong,
cos I got more than that in my pocket."  He said, "Here."
-he'd give it to me.  But now, they had a song, about
Mr. Charlie and Mr. Charlie Lowranch.  And Mr. Bully George
Miller and,-- what the other man? (to B. Gordon) --
Mr. Tom (Sykes?).
A.L.:
     Let's hear it!
W.B.:
     Now they was bad men.  They said Mr. Charlie
shot Mr. Lowranch and Mr. Lowranch shot Mr. Blair and Mr.
Charlie asked Mr. Lowranch why he was there.
A.L.:
     Can you sing that song?
W.B. (singing):
Whoa!  Mr. Charlie shot Mr. Lowranch
And Mr. Lowranch shot Mr. Blair
And then Mr. Charlie asked him,
"Why were you there?"

He said, "You shootin a 30,
And I shoots a 45
And that 45 is known
To keep me alive."
