SHARON [*La*] Tuesday  August 4, 1942. 
"You know a friend told me something the other day that I think is about right. He says that they are just playing Russia against Germany, letting them decimate themselves; but if it hadn't been for Russia, last year, England would have fallen; they would have had the English fleet, and the Axis would have licked us sure by this time."
