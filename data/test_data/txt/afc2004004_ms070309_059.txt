the Nashville washboard band. Two
blind men and three day laborers.
One [?] blind man had the most complicated 
washboard outfit I've seen -

various
tin plates
and frying
pans
washboard on each side

His washboarding was as tricky as any
Haitian drummer's. [Took them] Another
of the group played a one string
base instrument made out of a lard
can - like the old African one string
instrument. Took them home afterwards
& went in for a glass of beer.
 The bartender, acting on police
instructions, wouldn't let me drink 
with them.
July 16th Lewis Jones at 12 o'clock
refused to begin [his] the trip with me to Coahoma,
deciding to wait over until Sat. morning.
More & more convinced he really resents 
me.
Edwards and I started out in the broiling
heat. The wind [sch] scorched our faces. 101
