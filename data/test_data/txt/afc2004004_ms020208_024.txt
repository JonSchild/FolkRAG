can hurt you, why, that's poison.  I'm no conjuror.  But say somebody
put something down, why, I don't believe nothing like that.
A:  Well, Reverend, haven't membersof your congregation come to you to
help them lay ghosts that were bothering them, spirits and  things?
Not conjure, but just spuernatural things, haven't they ever cometo

R:  No, not for nothing like that I never had them come to me, mostly

that porch and started running (laughter).  Yeh, and they couldn't,

somebody had cursed him.  Well, that was how children had do, that is
everybody, yessir, he believedin it, you know.
