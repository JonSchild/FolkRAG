JOHN CATCHINGS

"The most I knew about this song was just what the words
in it tell, until just this summer, when I was singing it in a
tent out in Wisconsin where the sessions of the American Youth
Congress were being held. Suddenly around the corner of the tent
comes a girl who sings the last verse along with me. 'Where did
you learn that song' she asks. 'My father and mother made that
up when we were down in Birmingham.'

"Well, so she told me the whole story. John Catchings was
a rank and file leader in the union, and was charged and convicted
of having dynamited a house. On Labor Day the union held
a huge demonstration to get a pardon for him. Brother Bryan,
a local minister helped circulate petitions for his release,
and they sang this song, which was made up by Mr. and Mrs. Joe
Gelder and their friends. Joe Gelder was at that time working with the National
Committee to Defend Political Prisoners. During the strike, which
made headlines all over the country, John Catchings family was
in great need, but other unions members around pitched in to
help them out. John Catchings is free now, and sure enough,
just like the last verse says, they're all in the C.I.O."
