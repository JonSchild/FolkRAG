1942 TURKEY IN THE STRAW
By Carson J. Robison

Oh, Adolph Hitler grabbed a tail, 
He hung right on with tooth and nail, 
When he saw what he had, then he began to swear,
On the end of that tail was a Russian bear.
The old bear growled and started in to shake,
Adolph knew he'd made a mistake,
He tried to hang on, then he tried to let go,
Now they have a new dance called Hitler in the Snow.

I saw Mussolini a-sittin' on a log,
All puffed up like a great big frog.
I sneaked up close and stuck him with a wire,
He just went ssst like an old flat tire.
I took his hide and I hung it on a tree,
The tree said - hey, don't do that to me - 
So I took it on home to my mother-in-law,
She threw me outside with the turkey in the straw.

On, a monkey and a baboon sittin' on a rail, 
Feeling mighty bad and looking kinda pale.
A little yellow rat come sneaking round the weed,
The monkey said - look, there's the guy we need.
The rat climbed up and they all begin to grin, 
Along come a feller with whiskers on his chin,
He kicked that rail and he broke it with a crack
And that was the last of the three power pact.

Oh, the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock,
And the Yanks are a-moving and they pack an awful sock.
[The ??]
The sheep are in the meadow and the cows are in the corn.
There's gonna be a scrap just as sure as you're born.
Soldiers, sailors, pilots, marines,
Tall ones, short ones, lots of in-betweens,
Powder in their guns and sand in their xx craw,
Stepping to the tune of turkey in the straw.

Oh, swing your partner, here we go
To Berlin, Rome and Tokio,
We'll put 'em in a sack and give it a swish, 
Throw [it] 'em in the river and kill all the fish.
Tie 'em to a rope and give 'em a swing,
Just like a monkey on the end of a string,
Kick 'em in the pants and sock 'em in the jaw,
Teach 'em how to dance old turkey in the straw.
