The second song is almost always a Zepaules, although 
at times a second Yen Valou is sung. If a god has come 
there may be several Zepaules, with, perhaps, a Dahomey 
or a Mayis or another dance. The choice of rhythms depends 
partly on the taste of the god, and partly on the popularity of 
one or the other of the rhythms, and partly on whether there 
happens to be a song connected with the god who is present that is 
particularly popular at the moment. 
When the moment has come for the god to be dismissed, 
he amuses himself by dancing a mazon or a congo payette, both 
secular rhythms, and departs. Each God is thus thought 
of as being honored by three songs and, indeed, this pattern 
generally applies, except where unusual circumstances. If the 
reader will examine other series of recordings, he will notice 
that most solo singers sang three songs to each loa before 
beginning the songs that belonged to another. This 
pattern was one that they supplied themselves, for I never 
interfered with them.
