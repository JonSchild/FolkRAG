STANE SANG

(Tune:   The De'ils Awa wi the Exciseman.)
A chiel cam doun tae London toun
An nicked awa wi the stane, man.
A lassie cried oot, "I'll gie ye a haun,
For it's ill tae dae it alane, man".

         A chiel's awa, a chiel's awa,
         A chiel's awa wi the stane, man.
         A lad an a lass made His Worship an ass
         An nicked awa wi the stane, man.

They hadna pulleys, they hadna raips,
Faur less a muckle great crane, man--
Yet naebody kennt, nae Bobby cried oot,
"Here, whit the hell are ye daein, man?"

They had nae lorry tae cairry it hame,
Nae steamer or aeroplane, man,
For --here's a baur--in a wee Ford caur
They nicked awa wi the stane, man.

There's spies in Biggar and spies in Perth
In Bo'ness an Dunblane, man,
They're speirin but an they're speirin ben
But they'll never get haud o the stane, man.

The Dean was fleggit, he glunched and glumphed
An blubbered wi micht an main, man.
But the Lion is rampin in Scotland again
An he'll shairpen his teeth on the stane, man.

An if ye say, "Whit's aa the steer?
Ye're acting like a wean, man".--
Ye'll mind a hauflin Davy killt
Goliath wi a stane, man,
        A chiel's awa, a chiel's awa, & c..
