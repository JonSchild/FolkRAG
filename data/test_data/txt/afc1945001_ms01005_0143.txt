Mr. Warren B. Walsh
Director
The Syracuse University Rumor Clinic
Syracuse, New York

Dear Mr. Walsh:

Your letters of October 3rd and 4th, addressed to Mr. Elmer Davis, have been turned over to me for reply, since the Bureau of Intelligence, of which I am in charge, is responsible for the analysis of rumors.

The Syracuse University Rumor Clinic, which you describe in your communications as having been inspired by the AMERICAN MERCURY article, reproduced in the READERS' DIGEST, is of extreme interest to us, and we are most anxious to have you and your association make a good beginning in this very delicate sphere of activity.

As you of course understand, the rumors themselves which your clinic encounters are the symptoms, not the cause of the diseases. War-time rumors are created, as the studies of competent authorities shadow, by the tenseness and anxiety about the conduct of the war.

Since this is the case, there is good reason to believe that widely publicized rumor clinics which attempt to refute each rumor by the information intended as an antidote will, when read by the general public, augment their anxieties and, in turn, produce more rumors.

For just such groups as your own, we are preparing a statement on rumors, along with some suggestions about how local collection and analysis of rumors. You will receive this statement in a very few days and we trust that you and your associates, along with the Syracuse POST-STANDARD, from which we have heard under date of October 5th, will take our suggestions into consideration.
Sincerely yours,  R. Keith Kane  Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
