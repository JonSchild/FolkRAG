We went for a long drive through the 
country. All the way Hamish talked
& sang; Robin & Isla replied in kind
and I was silent, largely because
the British tradition is still strange
to me & because I'm not accustomed
to be easy & glib about folklore.
Hamish is either very knowledgeable
or a real idiot, because he'll put any
Scotch song into its century in the most
ofhanded manner in the world.
Actually I am harsh on Hamish
But he talked & sang a bit incessantly
yesterday - from 1 PM until
1 AM - with a couple of short breaks
for food - as if there was nothing else
to do but sing. Indeed, there is very 
little else to do in my presence,
since I know about so little else
besides songs.
I grew gloomier & more & more
