Took pre-ty good rid-in hor-ses thats bad, Now you
tells them to look at the cham-pion, that's me, Well they

see I aint got no more out-laws to break, but I'll buy you a tick-et and
looks me all ov-er and thinks that I'm full, So they off-ers a seat on that

give you a stake, at rid-in them bad ones well  you ain't so slow, and you
bad brah-ma bull, sez I good e-nough cause I ant here to brag, But I

might do some good at the big Ro-de-o
Come a long way just to gentle that stag,
