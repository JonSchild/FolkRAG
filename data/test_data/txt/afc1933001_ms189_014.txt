I can't tell you how much
I will appreciate this kindness
Alan. Of course I'd love 
them for this club-meeting. We're
all so anxious to hear them
but if this is impossible I'd
be glad to have them as
soon as its convenient for
you to ship them - I will
remit immediately upon
receipt of bill.
What's the news from your 
Father & Miss Terrill, I never
hear any more. Do hope they're
well, & that you & Elizabeth
will have a very Merry
Christmas - Don't pass me by
when going to Texas I have 
a negro story the best yet - very
very lovely by an old Negro near
hear - wish it could've recorded
before he goes -His voice is failing
now. Lots of love for you & E

Do you have the sermon
at Brown's Chapel? It isn't listed - I'd love it.
