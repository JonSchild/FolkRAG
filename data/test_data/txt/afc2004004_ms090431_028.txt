Fisk, 8. 5. HAFFER

Call it out no mo;
Strange things happening in the land.

We tried to fool the Negro
By saying they own fight;
They have no home or country,
No [g]flag or civil right.
But the Negro did the best,
And that he did the rest.
Strange things happening in the land.

And when Uncle Sam call to him,
"Blessed here are we
To perform a soldiers duty,
Whatever it may be."
They asked us true and brave;
They said they made our grave;
Strange things happening in the land.

When our government called to him,
We gladly took up arms
Here upon the battlefield,
Bought Liberty Bonds,
Even in the training camps,
They bought War Saving Stamps.
Strange things happening in the land.

That's all there is.
A: That's a beautiful song. Very good -- I mean the rhyme coming in 
there is good and everything. It must be awful hard to do that.
H: Well, sometimes it is, depends on how much you got to say about 
it at the time and that you begin writing, your mind was clouded with 
other things. If you in a jam or you co ldnâ€™t make ends meet, it takes 
you longer than if you didn't have nothing to do but just to write.
A: Well, someti es, I guess, you hacve had to write songs in an emergency 
when you needed to.
H: Yeah, that's right ; someties that happen. For instnce, this last 
song about this song that happened on the 15 of March, I had to have 
this song for the procession and I just didn't think about writing 
it until near the time. I'm not particular satisfied with some of the 
things I had about it. Maybe sometimes when I have to write a new 
one, I'll revise it.
