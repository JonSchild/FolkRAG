An' you see, it's a lady had ca-- had been there. I knew
herex well. She was a won'erful gi—ah, woman. Lil' small,
narrow-faced woman with long hair. Looked like her hair had
taken all [the] her strength, she had so much so much hair. An' she, ah, her,
she says she was, real Christian, ya know. So when she came back --
she had been up in Georgia to see her people -- when she came
back I was seekin', ya know. So she came right ont in the field,
just two nights before I got saved -- three nights before I got
saved, however -- she came out in the field. Right before the
peoples, ya know, where I was [sittin'] seekin', ya know. Where everybody's sittin'
there waitin' on the, you know the rows, you know, they had to
wait 'till the beans get dry down there before ya go pickin'.
Jes' sittin' 'round talkin'. Some buyin' diffrunt things, you
know, they sells out in the fields. Fish an' bread an' peanuts,
whatnot. [Sumpin' to] Somebody's jus', [jus'] Jus' keepin’ yourself pacified.
She walked up there where I was, right before the
I see her cast her eye over there at the Holiness peoples. She
says ah, "Ah," she talk -- her husband named George, too, an' my
husband named George -- she says ah, "Gah-age," -- she talks
proper -- say, "They tell me, " ah, "They tell me that Bessie
is seekin', for the Holy Ghost."
George say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!" Her husband talk
right short. He walk right on off.
An' so she said... An' she, "Is that so, Bessie?"
I said, "It sure is." An' she made me fell right bad.
Right them I felt funny. 'Cause, see, I had, I hadn't got the 
Holy Ghost then. I looked at her, I said, "It sure is."
