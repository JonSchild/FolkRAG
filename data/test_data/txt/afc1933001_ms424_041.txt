BARNARD SUMMER SCHOOL SONG
(Tune: The Little Cudgel)
(Manuscript)

On wind - whirling heights where the blue waters flow
Past tall granite towers to the sea,
Stands a school where in summer the workers may go,
To study, to learn, to be free.
Stands a school where in summer the workers may go,
To learn, and to lift industry.

Refrain: See, the Barnard School stands steady
Now, together, are you ready,
To study, to grow strong for Labor?

The workers all come from the shop and the mill,
From the streets with their rush and their roar
With books and with classes, to gain knowledge still,
And go back with new visions in store,
With books and with classes, to gain knowledge still,
And go back with new visions in store.

Refrain: See, the Barnard School stands steady
Now, together, are you ready,
To study, to grow strong for Labor?
