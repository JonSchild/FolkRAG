MRS. DAVIS:
Oh yes you do. What I thank God for, it seems like he's away and he's going to return someday. Thats the way it seems in my mind. That he's away and he's going to come back.
LARRY:
Ah, I imagine together, you know, you all saw some real hard times along the road. Along those 36 years.
MARS.DAVIS:
Yes it wasn't always good all the time but you know I tried to be of good cheer all the way from the time I married him, because when you marry a person you marry for better or worse you supposed to go through thick and thin whatever happens whatever comes along you supposed to stick and thats just what I did. Oh yes I did.
LARRY:
Like I said, I told Roy and all the rest of them, I tell him I say There no one like Mrs. Davis, I say because she wouldn't let Brother Davis playing Blues, and I wanted to hear Blues just like they want to hear blues and then when I thought the thing over, you was the best thing, you was the best not thing, you was the best woman a man like him could have.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well I'll tell you, It really made me sick when he got in the music world because I know that a lot of times he'd play things whats not so becoming for a minister and so I plead hard not to get in the music world and it really made me sick to think of it.
