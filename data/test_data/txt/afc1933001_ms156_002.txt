Dear Mr. Lomax,
Enclosed is the letter you 
wrote my mother Mrs. Brown 
and the tunes of the songs 
she sent you.

As I could not be at 
home and hear her sing 
them again, I wrote them down 
as I remembered hearing 
them as a child.

I hope they prove to be 
satisfactory and that you 
can use them.

I appreciate very much
