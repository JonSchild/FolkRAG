Dear Ted:

I'm glad you've had a vacation. I certainly hope that you get
money for completing the film because, frankly, it would be a
considerable disappointment for the group if they never get to
see the completed results. My private opinion is that we are
always asking the folk to do things for us which help us a lot
and them very little. This comment is delivered as much at
myself as at you.

I would very much like to take a look at the film but I don't
think I could do a thing about it until the middle of November.
Would you plan to send it then if that fits in with your plans.

Meantime, I would like to ask you a very general question in
this context. The Cantometrics project is really paying off in
terms of good data that fits where it ought to fit.  In other
words, I am going to be able to define a lot of world culture
regions that we all agree upon with the Cantometrics method.
I want to confirm these results by taking at look at body communication
patterns of singing groups.  I will be working under the
direction of Birdwhistell, whose seminar I took and about whose
method I know something or other.  I am sure that you know as
much as anybody about the available film, and when you get a
chance, I would like you to let me know where the best pieces
of film are to be had.  What I want is to look at folk and primitive
singers in action in their own setting and photographed
in a very straightforward way that takes in audience reaction.
That's a big order, but there must be some stuff like this.

Yours sincerely,

Alan Lomax
