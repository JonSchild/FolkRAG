Dear Alan Lomax

   Thanks for your
letter in reply to my Widdicum Vare cards
   I have just heard this morning's
broadcast and enjoyed it so much.  I
know some of these old songs and
wonder now if you have heard the
old English one called "Lord Loval."
The first verse "Lord Loval, he stood at his
castle gate
"A-combing his milk-white steed."

There are many verses.  I shall be glad
to give you the words, but you may be
able to furnish the music.

Another is a southern one.  It begins
"Nicodemus the slave, was of African birth
And he died years ago, very old."

Some morning I hope to hear
