George B. Williams
4th period
Civics
It is a very strong rumor
that all the schools
will be let out May 19th
so that the boys and 
girls can go to the farm.
A chaplin preached a
forceful sermon on the
Ten Commandments,
leaving one private in
a serious mood. But
eventually he brightened
up "Anyway," he consoled
himself, "I never made
a graven image."
