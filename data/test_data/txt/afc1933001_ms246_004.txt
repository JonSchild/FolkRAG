Dear Alan: Referring to the enclosed
letter:

1. I think I can maintain my
copyright to the "Grey Goose" as published
in our Ballads and as you (I assume)
have taught it to Burl Ives. At least
I am willing to spend some money
to establish my claim to this song
against Burl Ives, Brandon Inc., etc.

2. I haven't the least idea of
how I could employ to any entertaining
or useful purpose a
"16 mm copy of a sound film copy
of Tall Tales."

3. "Strawberry Roan" is a copyrighted
song. I know its author! Brandon
Inc. must either steal it or pay for
it. The author needs the money.
