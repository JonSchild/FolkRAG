Ogden, Utah

"After election, the Army will bet the green light on the 18-year-olds.
You watch."
...

"The chairman of the draft board told me personally that they would
be taking 18-year-old kids right after the election.  My kid got his call for a
physical to report last Friday, but he left Thursday for San Francisco in
the navy.  I was talking about it to ___________________, the chairman of the
draft board, and he said the 18-year-old kids were a cinch to be called up
right after the election."
...

"You know they're going to take 18-year-old kids.  Why shouldn't
they?  England has called up her 17-year-old boys and Germany has been
using 14-year-old kids in submarines right along."
....

"We're going to see 18-year-old kids drafted pretty soon now.
It stands to reason they will take those kids before they call up married
men.  We've got three million 18 and 19-year-old boys in this country.
They'll go in alright."
....

"They're calling up the married men in Idaho now."
...

"They're taking married men with children in Idaho, already. Too
may farmers have been deferred."
