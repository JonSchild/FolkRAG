Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have just received your letter about
the North Carolina records and their proposed purchase
by the N.C. Folklore Council.

At the time my recordings were deposited
in the Library of Congress archive, the understanding was
that no use would be made of them without my permission, [*from 1939*]
for a period of five years. That still seems to me the
best disposition, which means about three more years before 
my restrictions are removable.

As soon as I got your letter I telephoned
A.P. Hudson at Chapel Hill, to inquire what purpose and
uses they had in mind for the records if they got them.
Apparently the purpose is the setting up of a state archive.
For such uses I have only  encouragement. I told Dr. Hudson
that my restrictions would not apply to such uses.

This restriction business is all fiddle-faddle
anyhow. I could wish that folklorists were, as a group, less
suspicious and legalistic about their collections and the uses
to which the collections are to be put.

I have been chasing you around the country for
well over a year. For a number of legitimate reasons, I think.
One is my desire, as chairman of the Folklore Committee of
the National Council of Teachers of English, to connect English
teachers with what you are doing in the national archive. Perhaps
Charlie Seeger has already told you about some of her of the concerns 
which we seem to have in common. I'm going to telephone you at
Hudson's tomorrow about lunch time, and see if you can come over
this way before you go back home. We are only thirty miles away
from Chapel Hill. I and singing wife Margaret would be very glad
to meet up with you.

Sincerely yours,
Fletcher Collins
