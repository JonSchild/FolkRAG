The present administration is catering to the negro vote and its

and Congress will act realistically on labor legislation. (Businessman)

Labor is running the country. (Businessman)

Inflation is inevitable with Government spending on both war essentials 
and non-essentials on the present scale. (Businessman)

Savings Accounts and money now in lock boxes in banks may be paid in
War Bonds before long. (Businessman)

Jews are making every effort to avoid the draft. (Businessman)

It is evident that negroes are being stirred up. The attitude of 
domestic servants is so different. (Housewife)

The servant problem is not so much one of scarcity but of the attitudes 
of the negroes. (Housewife)

The Germans must be suffering from diminishing manpower. A friend of 
mine in Florida saw a twelve year old German boy among the prisoners 
taken from a German submarine. He just looked like any frightened 
child would. (Housewife)

We're in for a change as far as the negroes are concerned and its going 
to mean blood-shed. The negroes are content, if they were just left 
alone. (Workman)
