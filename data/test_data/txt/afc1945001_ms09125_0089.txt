An American Victory  [*72*]

My story takes place in a recruiting
station. A boy wanted action, and
wanted to help his country all at the
same time. He went to sign up with
the navy. After he had his examination
and was posted, he was sent to the
Great Lakes Training Stations.

After he has been in training about
11 months his company got a notice, that
all men would have to go over seas.
They all packed and were ready to go.
The train was to leave at 9:30 that
night. When 9:30 arrived the young
man was standing by his mother and family
waiting for the train to come. The sailor
got on the train and rode for a day and
a night. Then they got on a boat
and sailed far away. When they got
off they found that they were in
a hot country. They were exploring
and came across a japanese
headquarters which they bombed.
They all came back home again
in the best of health.
