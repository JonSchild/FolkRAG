Then, beginning with the smallest girl, each candidate was
baptized.  Just before one was immersed they would sing:

Missionary Baptist is my name,
Missionary Baptist is my name,
Missionary Baptist is my name,

He spoke to the sea, and the sea was still.

De Lord said baptism it must be,
De lil babe in de manger;
What kind o'manner o'man is he?
He walk on de land and he walk on de sea
An' all things her obey his will,
He speak to de sea and de sea is still.
An' 'ligion is so sweet.

taken out of the water until she became calm. She was then baptized
and again underwent a weird seizure. The last man baptized was a muscular

pool. I heard the minister mutter to his helpers: "Get him out of here
before he drowns himself". As each candidate was led out of the water,
the congregation sang with splendid effect:
