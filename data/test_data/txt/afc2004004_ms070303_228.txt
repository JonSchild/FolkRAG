Come up[ an' see my Garretie.
[Written down by Hamish in Aberdeen] (Weaver song)
Come up and see my garret, come up
an' see it noo.
Come up and see my garretie, it's a'
furnished new.
A broken cup and saucer
a chair without a leg
A humphy-backit dresser
an' a bandy-leggit bed.
My faither is a wiver, he works at
the bobin' mill
He gets his pey on Friday
an' buys half a gill.
He gings to the kirk on Sunday
half an 'oor late.
He pu's the buttons off his sack
an' throws them in the plate.
(Aberdeen).
