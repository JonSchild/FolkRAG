SB:  Well, Bill, you know, when I was down south use to go out
rabbit huntin' you know, and I never did have over two
shells.  And I got to--got to get a rabbit.  Got to get a
rabbit and ain't got but two shells.  Shoot at the rabbit--
an' miss it--an'--just lay your gun down, lay your gun
down. . .I use to run so fast, run up side of him and feel
the hips, see was it fat.  If he wasn't fat I'd let him go
you know--let him go and then catch me a fat one--
