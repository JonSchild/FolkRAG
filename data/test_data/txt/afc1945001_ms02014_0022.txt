I do not believe this method of collecting rumors 
is good for the following reasons:

1.  It seems to require fairly close local checking 
and supervision if substantial results are to 
be obtained.

2.  It has the tendency, I noticed, of making the 
participant think he is being asked to sort of 
spy on others.

3.  The idea of choosing a few people to report 
rumors, if it gets about, might be distorted 
and give rise to the impression that the 
Government is using "Gestapo" methods.

I think a better method would be to enlist the cooperation 
of the public at large through establishment of rumor 
clinics as a community enterprise.  In this way, the program 
could be carried out openly with public support and not 
confidentially; more substantial results could be obtained; 
and the possible impression of Government clandestine 
procedures would be prevented from arising.
