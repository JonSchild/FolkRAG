May 21, 1934

My dear Mr. Lomax:

I have your letter of May 17th relating
your sad, sad tale. I am glad, however, that 
the tale deals mostly with the past and that
your difficulties seem to be over for the 
present.

There does not seem to be anything further 
I can do about your friend Mr. Kleberg.
I have written to the Congressman and I have
sent him a copy of the Quarterly with your
article. I have never had as much as an
acknowledgement. I have also written to his
brother in Texas, without receiving a reply.
I am enclosing copies of both letters. I
am also returning the 2 letters that you
sent to me which, I presume, you have answered. 

With very kind regards, I am
Faithfully yours,
