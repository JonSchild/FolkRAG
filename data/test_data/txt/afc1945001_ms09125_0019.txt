 Jokes

In order to keep up the good nature
of the people several newspaper and
publishing houses have been printing
jokes and cartoons about the war.
        As time went on someone wrote a 
song called " The Fuehrur's Face." The song
was not only printed and photograph 
records made but it was also put into
the movies. The idea this song (I mean
what is tells) is about the Fuerhur boasting
of himself and the German race. But
whenever the Fuerhur (Shicklebergur of Hitler)
makes the remark and time come the hiel him
they mock his name.
 Some jokes I seen in a army
magizine wore about in the camp. One
cartoon I seen was about a private first
class about 5'1' tall raising up his head to
a master sargent about 6'2' in height
and ready to fight him. At the bottom it 
said (two soldiers talking about him) Pee
Wee is not afraid of nothing since he got
 his B.T.C. stripes.
