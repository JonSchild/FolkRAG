Gal 111
It was early next morning we were still on the go
Down to the black borders of old Mexico,
When right in behind me I heard a sharp yell
And I knew that the redskins were giving me hell.
I spoke to Pattonio, drew up on the reins,
I spoke to Pattonio, the pride of the plains.
Pattonio, he answered with a nod of his head,
And his black body lengthened and faster he sped.
Then I reached the ford and tried to dismount,
but an arrow held me fast, and so I could not.
You may gaze at the arrow, hands on the wall, 
It was driven through stirrup, foot saddle, and all.
I've rode many horses all over the range, 
But none like Pattonio, the pride of the plains.
