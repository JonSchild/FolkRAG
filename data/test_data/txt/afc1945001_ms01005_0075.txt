Summary.  The statement that "the people with the most information
                    are most prolific in rumors" does not quite capture the 
                    finding which is that the alert, active, participant, 
                    semi-educated person seems most likely to yield the
                    most rumors when questioned.

                    The point that about 70 per cent of the rumors are 
                    believed should be included in the summary.

Introduction.  There is too much stress on the "frankly exploratory"
                    nature of the study. Rumor is not a subject in which
                    elaborate or expensive methods need to be used. A 
                    slightly wider sample and more use of rumor collections
                    already available (e.g. bi-monthly reports from Boston)
                    would make this a wholly adequate study on which to base 
                    a policy in rumor control.

                            I object to the implication that we must have finer
                    and finer studies. What we need is more and more 
                    utilization of such studies as are made. 

                            What is a rumor? Although the board definition is
                    desirable and it is well to record "too much rather
                    than too little," still the collection includes
                    straight opinions (not rumors), e.g. "England starts
                    it and expects us to finish it." There could have 
                   been more sifting in order to differentiate better the
                   specific rumor from the underlying attitude.

Page 2.      The checking against the FBMS is a very good idea.
                   More and more publicity should be given to such findings.

                   The section on the "Effect of Rumor" is good but too
                   brief.   It is here that the method of the intensive
                   interview should yield rich returns.

Page 5.      Subject matter. The classification by subject matter
                   should be dictated by action-policy. Thus, all rumors
                   that the Army can disinfect should be grouped, also 
                   those that "belong" to the Navy, to OCD, to the policy 
                   officers of OWI, etc.

                   This criticism shows up the principal weakness of the
                   report -- that is not geared to action.
