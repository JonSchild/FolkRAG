3. Where the rumors probably started.
4. The extent to which people believe in them.
5. The elements in the rumors which do, or do not, make for
credibility.
The interviewer will be able, on the basis of such intimate contact
with his informants, to come to some degree of understanding as to
the function and significance of rumor in the individual case and
and thus to different types and classes of people. He will use
rough rating scales in evaluating whatever pertinent personality
characteristics may be involved in the individual diagnoses. The
interviewer will thus collect sufficient information about his
informants to enable us to apply the following diagnostic formula:
R = I (Interest)
_
N (News)
R = the amount of rumor
I being determined by such factors and ratings as:
1. prejudice rating
2. index of social participation
3. index of interest in war
4. ratings on allies
5. degree of in-group identification
6. ethnic characteristics
7. class
8. et cetera
N being determined by such factors as:
1. newspaper and radio analysis in the community
2. rating on level of information
3. rating on confidence in news
4. degree of satisfaction with news coverage
5. et cetera
We hope also to gain sufficient insights into the "secondary interviewees"
to enable us to apply the same formula in a generalized or mass sense.

It is also proposed that a short questionnaire be constructed on the
basis of whatever rumors are collected on the pre-test and that this
questionnaire be administered to as many persons in the community as
time will permit. The questionnaire might be in the form of a rumor
game, "Have you heard this one?" The data thus gathered could be used
to check the reliability of the information given by the informant
families as well as to supplement the overall qualitative picture.
