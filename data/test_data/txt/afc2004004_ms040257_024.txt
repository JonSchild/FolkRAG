Mr. McLeod:

What she taught me years ago is just coming back to me
now. If I hear a snatch, it comes back to me.....Penny
Morrison, she was her auntie as well, you see - that's how we
got into this singing family....she was a wonderful old lady.
I believe she had about anything up to three hundred songs.
A widow for years and years, she had two sons and a daughter.
They worked a small croft there. She's been dead now since
1937. I wish she were here today...she was very pleasant
and jolly....very little English....they were all handed down....
....I lead a very happy life amongst them. I attend weddings and
Ceilidhs and sing songs,.....and very happily indeed....I may say, for
one that I'm very happy in the Island of Benbeculs....
