JOHN A. LOMAX
7456 SAN BENITO WAY
DALLAS, TEXAS
5/5/1942.
Dear Alan: Richard Smith and
Jonas Morris spent Saturday night
with me. Sunday morning, when they
got ready to sing, the Recorder failed
to respond. No juice came through.
I was helpless and Miss Terrill couldn't find the break. Mr.
Bennett came out in his wagon
and located and repaired the break 
in connections. Then, after contracting
and forging the enclosed bill, Miss
Terrill made some records that
I think will please you. Try to
get this money back and the other
bills paid also. A month or more
I filled out and sent in for the
second time the various statements. My Mexican
singers are nomads and are gone
