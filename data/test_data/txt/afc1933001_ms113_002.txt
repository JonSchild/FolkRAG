Dear Dr. Botkin:

Some weeks ago the Archive sent us Albums 1 through
5 of the folk music set that was released this summer, but for
some reason the texts and explanatory notes that I understand
were issued with the records never reached us. Could you remedy
this situation or forward this note along to the person who
could? Also, in Album number 2, we received two copies of the 
disk which has "Fod" on one side and "Roll On the Ground" on 
the other. Did we miss out on one records, or was this just an
added present? 

Alan tells me that you're doing a swell job in the
Archive. As you may know, I have a new job too, assisting Nick
Ray in overseas broadcasting work. I hope you are enjoying your
new position as much as I am mine. Please give my regards to
all my friends in the Archive. 

Sincerely,
Bess Lomax
