HARD TIMES IN OLD COLMAN'S MINES
Come out on strike, boys, It's all you can do. Old Colman, he's a-gittin' rich By makin' slaves outa you.
Chorus: It's hard times in old Colman's mines It's hard times, poor boy.
You get up in the morning In the coal mining shack You can throw any bulldog Right out through the crack Chorus:
You sit down for breakfast And all you have to eat It's cornbread and bulldog gravy Without a bite of meat. Chorus:
In the wintertime you live On cornbread and pinto beans. In the summertime you live on cornbread and wild greens. Chorus:
When you ask about leaving This is what you say, We're so darned poor and ragged We can never get away. Chorus:
Sometimes you have to go to work Without a bite to eat Without a pair of pants to wear And no shoes on your feet. Chorus:
You're all hungry and ragged And I am sad and blue Yes, I am so disgusted I don't know what to do. Chorus:
