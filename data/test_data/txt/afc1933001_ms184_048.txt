Dear Mr. Spivacke,
Thank you for the very 
valuable 3-volume "Check-list of 
recorded songs in the English language in 
the Archive of American Folk Song to July, 1940,"
which you were kind enough to send to me.
I'm still drilling away with 
my collection of over 300 songs picked up 
here in Ohio.  I'm working on social 
and sociological background
Cordially yours,
H. L. Ridenour
Head Dept. English.
