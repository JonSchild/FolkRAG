Its always taken an Irishman to prove that Nike was right
For there never was an Irishman that didn't love to fight,
There never was a battle that the Irish wasn't in,
There never was a battle that the Irish couldn't win,
There's thousands in every regiment, the Irish always go
They have learned their fighting somewhere and that's all we
want to know,
Oh, the Army's full of Irish, they're Irish to a man,
A bugle call is music sweet, to Casey of McAnn.
They're all a bunch of noble sons, a fighting lot of sonsuvguns
A man from Ireland never runs - he's Irish.
