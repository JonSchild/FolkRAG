Dear Mrs. Becker:

As I stated to you in my previous letter, it will
be impossible for me to settle my account except
through engagements obtained for me by whatever
management corporation has me  in tow at the moment.
I regret that my financial condition does not enable
me to settle the account in any other fashion but I
am in the unpleasant position of insisting upon this
type of settlement.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
