Dear Mr. Gouger: 

Your letter of December 26, addressed to Mr. John 
A. Lomax, has been referred to me for reply. Much as 
we would like to arrange for you to have copies of 
your grandfather's "fiddling", it is unfortunately 
impossible at the present time. We do not have the 
apparatus necessary for making copies of our records 
but we hope to be able to install such apparatus in 
the near future. If you will write us again in about 
six months, I trust that we will be able to comply 
with your request promptly. 
Very truly yours, 

Harold Spivacke 
Chief, Division of Music
