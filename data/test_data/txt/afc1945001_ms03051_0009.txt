REPORT NO. 6 (HUMOR REPORT)
TO
BUREAU OF INTELLIGENCE

TENNESSEE
AUGUST 8, 1942

Before proceeding with this report I wish to advise that no vicious or
seemingly malicious reports have come to my attention, only such generalizations 
as the people of this democratic nation are accustomed to make on
any and all subjects of current interest.

During the week I have been with various types of groups and have moved
through crowds on the streets, in the stores, at the various amusement places
such as movies, restaurants, open-air amusement places and have been more 
impressed with the absence of rumors than their presence.

Except among businessmen and their wives in social gatherings practically
none have come to our attention and the same report is made to me from
other reliable sources.

The negroes I have heard or whose conversations have been repeated to me
have been as carefree as ever with the war or racial disturbance seemingly
far from their minds.

The rumors most frequently heard and the atmosphere which makes attitudes
or apprehensions felt rather than heard indicate a latent conviction of:

1. Racial trouble or at least a change in racial relations;
2. Inflation and its attendant economic upheaval unless more
stringent measures for its control are put into effect at once;
