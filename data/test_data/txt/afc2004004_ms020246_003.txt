YES MA'AM
B. That's with that, you see that, that's pretty.   And then just go over
it again. Lil girl, Lil boy and the same thing, see. and they go downtown
and git them eggs.   And then Oh yeah and this other one about Shortenin'
Bread.   You know that already.
A. I don't know how you sing -- where'd you learn that?
B. That's home too.
A. You didn't learn it from a [record] radio there?
B. No no . That's shortenin' bread, we used to cut that shortenin'
bread, but I can't cut it now. We used to cut it. But 'um this 'um.
SHORTENIN' BREAD
B. Now that's the way that goes. There's alot more to it, it's pretty
though.   There's a cut to it, see. (cut is faster rhythm for dancing,
on "mama baby loves shortenin' bread.)
All this here is how it goes 'n I'm goin' to show you how they do it.
I like shortenin' bread 'n Mama cook it good. 'n my children does it,
I learned them. Oh yes, that's what I want to know, does you all [kno]
have John's song. That's a shout like. You know it would be a shout,
a walk shout. You know as your singin' [(]well, I won't go away from the
mike.
JOHN, JOHN, YOU WILL SEE JOHN
B. There's more in it you know, but it's pretty ain't it.
A. What do you do when you're doin' that?B.Well you [just] walk just like
you do when you walk john, you walk out.
B. 'n all of this here. I tell you why I mean to do those[here] things
like that, there's so many things that's so much tiresome in it, you know
they get tired. Some of the plays have to be with slow movement and other
movement that are hard work, you see 'n it got to be sung and that way.
'n this other,  you steps 'n you stops, I'm tryin' to think of that thing
how Mama and them used to do that thing. All the same, just like the Bible
said,
