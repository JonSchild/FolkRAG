(#1 not transcribed)

AL:  We're high up in the Smokey Mountains, one of the places
where the lore and the song and the dances of the people still
live.  We're up on Sheep Back Ridge, with our back to Maggie
Valley, the absolute center of square dancing in America.
Here comes Kyle Edwards, who calls a big square dance group
and is going to be our host this evening at the Stomping Ground.
Kyle, come on down and let's talk a little bit.  How are 
you this morning?
Kyle:  A little bit chilly.
AL:  We gonna have a good day, good dance tonight?
Kyle:  Yes, sir.
AL:  Wonderful.  What are you doing up here?
Kyle:  Fixing the cabin- it's a place to get away.
AL:  Is this what you do for a living when you're not
square dancing, and running your inn?
. . . . .How long you been running this bulldozer?
Kyle:  We been in the business about 20 years.
AL:  That's what paid for the Stomping Ground dance barn, is it?
Kyle:  That had something to do with it, it played a part.
AL:  Tell me about your family, they belong in this part of
the country?
Kyle:  Yessir.  Our family's been here for a long time- over
100 years, in this community.
AL:  This part of the country was really isolated and landlocked
