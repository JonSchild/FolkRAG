instruments with the intent of renting them to musicians
after this had happened.  And he was an excellent musician
himself, played drums and trombone especially.  And Jack

instruments to form a band.  And he hired Dave Perkins to
play the, the drums in the band.
LOMAX  When was this?
ROSE  This was 1892.  And of course

Ashield's father, a black musician and, and teacher, played
clarinet in that band.  And then the other two musicians
besides Lane were white.  And this was known as the Reliance
Band. And it had a conventional instrumentation.  That is
trumpet, valve trombone, because there was no slide trombone
in jazz yet, and the clarinet, and then the, you know, the
rhythm.  So this was known as the Reliance Band.
LOMAX  Named after an insurance company.

organizations wouldn't hire them because they were, there
was a white leader you see.  But nevertheless, for many
years he dominated the jobs in this town.  And they were,
became 7 Reliance Bands.  They were numbered Reliance 1
through 7.  And he would run from one job to another and,
and play for 10 minutes at each one so everybody would know
