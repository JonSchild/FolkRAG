(HAIR STYLES)
TL:  I'll be darned.
BJ:  Yeah, it's diffrunt from all the rest.  An' tha's just some
old, back stuff, somewhere, back in the old peoples' time.  Mine
up there, now this white place up there, now I noticed the
other day, yesterday, when I combed my hair, it ain't as white as it was
the other week, hear?  It's pretty, it's nice and pretty the other
week 'cause I hel's (helds) it up an' lookin' at it an' twistin'
it aroun'.  An' now it ain't many strands of it white.  It often
do it; do it often time.  Turn white, and again it done turn black.
But when, now this here around the edge, it's me, sure 'nuf me.
See, it's comin' on.  Tha's, tha's grey. . .Tha's grey hair.  Tha's
just what it is.  I. . .so I know it's true that one portion of the 
Law it say you cain't turn one hair white an' another grey.  You,
you know, turn it, an'. . .He turns it.  An' so tha's it.  Ha, tha's 
the way it is. . .I love, I love grey hair.
TL:  How did people used to fix their hair a long time ago, Bessie?
BJ:  Just put it jus' like everybody else, jus' like they all
fixin' it now. . .Jus' like.  They roll their hair up in here, 'cause
Mama used to roll mine, you know, around my neck, as long as I
had it.
TL:  A long time ago?  They did it the same way?
BJ:  Yeah.  They used rats in it.  You know, they call it rats.  Just take a long
stockin' or sumpin' black an' roll it up, ya know, an' make a lil'
roll outa it, insteada -- jus' like what you buy in the sto'.  On'y
they made it themse'f, outa black stockin's or black piece of cloth,
an' roll your hair up on 'em.  Looked pretty that way.  Yessuh.
TL:  Did they wear their hair real long then or did they cut if off?
BJ:  They don't cut no hair.  They jus' -- you know, very seldom
your hear talkin' about 'em cuttin' their hair.  Yeah, tha's it,
very seldom.
