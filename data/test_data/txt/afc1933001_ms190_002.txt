Dear Mr. Lomax:

The enclosed just came from President Joseph A.
Brandt of the University of Oklahoma. Perhaps,
James Pipes is the kind of person you are 
looking for. I can't do anything about a 
Guggenheim Fellowship for him this year.

Please return the material in the enclosed
envelope when you have done with it.

Joe Brandt is a discriminating feller.

Sincerely yours,
Henry Allen Moe
