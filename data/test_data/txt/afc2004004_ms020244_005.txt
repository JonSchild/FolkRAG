                          He stayed in the whale
                          Three long days and nights,
                          Then he heaved ol' Jonah
                          On sandy land.       (Cryin')

CHORUS:           That's what's the matter now, etc.

                          (REPEAT FIRST CHORUS)

                          Lawd, I wonder what's the matter
                         With the church, can't move,
                         The folks in the church,
                         They are talkin' down You.                  (CHORUS 2 & 1)




                         There are [mover] more verses to this.
                         An alternate first line to the chorus is:
                              What's the matter now?
