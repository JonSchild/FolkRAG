LOMAX:     The tale of the Lady and the glove comes from a different 
and later epoch of ballad [xxx] making. Rennaissance 
story tellers gave the story its form used by Browning in 
a sentimental 19th century version, and it was Salyersville, 
Kentucky, where it showed the fellows how dangerous it 
was to fall in love....

LOMAX:    SINGS:     THE LADY OF CARLISLE  [Tee Roo]

Now this here's a song", your ballad singer might announce 
"That should be a warning to young girls not to trust a 
man and not to listen to what men say". The ballad once 
told the story of a demon who lured a married woman away 
to her death. Later the demon became a house carpenter. 
In America the house carpenter is a popular villain, 
more so than the demon. Here is Robin Roberts singing 
the classic version of Texas Gladden the great Va. 
ballad singer.

LOMAX:  The old time love songs of the American frontier indicate 
that the Americans who faced Indians and grizzly bears 
and loneliness on the frontier were afraid of love. 
There were practical dangers. Courting the pretty 
daughter of a frontier patriarch had it's hazards, as 
this song shows...

LOMAX: 

(last stanza) He smashed my nose and my clothes he tore
He knocked out my teeth and threw me on the floo[floor]
He blakced [blacked] my eyes and he kicked me in the pants
Swear by heck I'll never take another chance,
Swear by heck I'll never take another chance...

      Of course, even worse than being chased by the old man 
was being laughed at by the girls. And if there was a 
kind of frontier folk song more popular than the Barbara 
Allen love-death variety, it was the flyting song in 
which the girls teased the boys...
