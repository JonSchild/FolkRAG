Concord, N.C.

Dear J.E.,

     I've been working hard on marketing the big 
collection of recordings I made all over the South this
summer, among them, yours. Atlantic Records is now going
to publish six albums of material, and in them I believe
I will be able to use all of your pieces. Quite certainly
I will use Johnson's Old Grey Mule, Glen's Chimes, Train 111,
and Whoa Mule, in an album of folk music for children, which
I believe is going to be the most talked about of the whole
series. I'm quite certain that Three Nights Drunk and
Columbus Stockade will go into another album in the series,
but so far not planned. As you will see from the attached
contract, I can pay you at the rate of an advance against
royalties of $20 per song. You will also receive normal
writer's royalties directly from the Atlantic Recording
Company when the records are released and sold.
     I sincerely believe that publication xx in this series
of albums which will be the first folk music albums in
stereo to be released by this vigorous and active new
company will bring your group to the attention of a very
big audience in America, and may make you a nice sum of
money. In order to push the matter forward to conclusion
I hope you'll sign two copies of the attached letter of
agreement between us and return them to me right away.
                                                   With best wishes for a merry Xmas,

                                                           Alan Lomax.
