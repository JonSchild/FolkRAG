You can go in a rich man's front do',
you can’t go in a po' man's front
do - he'll kill you - he's a Yahoo.

Yahoo song - I'm a rowdy soul

Whoa back Buck, git over, Paul
You steppin' on my cotton say, one
and all
—
Whoa, Buck, git over Lamb
You steppin' on my cotton like you
don't give a damn
—
I'm a rowdy soul (2)
I don't see a nigger in a mile o' mo
(I'm rowdy all round my red ass hole)
—
Took my gal to the party-, she sat in the steeple
My gal farted and broke my heart
and shit all over the people.
