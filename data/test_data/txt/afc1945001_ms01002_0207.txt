OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To: Mr. Eugene Katz                                          Date: March 31,1942
From: Andie Knutson
Subject:  Summary on Rumor Analysis  [*file*]

    It is felt that Part II would better read:

          The People:  How are their opinions affected
                                 by rumors; how do rumors reflect
                                 their opinions, feelings, and
                                 information?

         It Seems Probable That:
              1.  A large part of the current rumors 
                   are not consciously planned but rather 
                   are the product of unclear thinking on 
                   the part of persons who are not well 
                   informed.

                2.  The  readiness with which rumors are picked
                   up may really be an expression of the fear,
                   insecurity, or lack of information on the 
                   part of certain groups.

    Possibly a study of the relationship between reported 
rumors and attitude, opinion, and particularly knowledge surveys 
in the same area would evidence this relationship, in which event 
such surveys might be of aid in predicting probable rumor [treatments] trends.
