Yallow woman make a preacher lay his Bible down,

Tell me, baby,
Tell me, baby."

L.B. Speaks:
This man was workin' on de levee for Mister Johnny Ryan.*
An' he was one o de bes skinners **Mister Ryan had. An'
Mister Ryan done made de man mad. An' 'stead o' takin'
it out on Mister Ryan, dis man was takin' his spite out
of de mules. He was a man expert wid his line. Ev'y
time he hit a mule, he cut de hair right off an' write his
'nitials.

L.B. Sings: 
Hon-a-ay,
I'm all out an' down,
Hone-a-ay,
I'm down in de bottom, skinnin' for Johnny Ryan,
Puttin' my 'nitials, honey, on de mules behin',
Wid my line, babe,
Wid my line, babex.

I tole my baby, like de Dago tole de Jew,
Be good to me an' I'll be good to you,'***
Tell me, baby,
[Aw baby]
Tell me, baby,
Aw, baby,
Aw, baby.
Hon-a-ay!" ************
