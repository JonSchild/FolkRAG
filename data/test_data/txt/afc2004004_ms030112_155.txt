LARRY:
I went to see them the other night and both started crying when I left. It really touched me. And there telling me like Daddy when are you going to stay with us, and I say well maybe it will work itself out and I feel like it will. I feel like it will because you see my wife thinking I'm out here with a whole lot of women, you see women can only help me, you see I can't do that to my landlord and for a long time I been taking care of me you know, since I was about 17 and I found out back then, that you take that old hundred dollars she think I'm with somebody else. You see don't forget the thing about her is how she accues me. What did Brother Davis say about he that thinketh in his heart so is he.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well thats true. Thats in the Bible. He that thinketh in his heart so he is.
LARRY:
And all this accusing and all that, I remind her all the time, I ain't never accused her, She says I have no reason to, thats right I ain't even thought of it.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well as I said before, Married life is just what you make of it. If you want it to be good, you got to make it that way you know. Don't pay attention to every little thing that comes along because in life theres going to something thats not going to be good.
