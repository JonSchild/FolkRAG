F. N. F.

1. "The army uses the WAAC's as
prostitutes for the soldiers."

2. "Every time things get hot in
England Churchill beats it over to
America."

3. "The army is taking one eyeid
men with one leg. It doesn't matter
just so he has a trigger finger."

4. "Why should the Negro go to war?
The white soldiers bring up the
rear and put the Negroes in front
to be shot down while the white officers
stay off the battlefield in safety"

5. "It seems unfair that all the
glory is given to the white soldiers,
when news reels are shown on
the screen not a black face can
be seen, but all dirty works such as
digging ditches and building bridges is
left to the Negroes and they are always
shown in these types of pictures."
