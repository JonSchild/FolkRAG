Dear Rae,
My thanks to you and your staff for being so helpful
and stopping in the middle of your many jobs to make
things go well for me.

I hope that everything will soon straighten out with
Mrs. Flanders and that I can pick up the tapes when 
I am in Washington Tuesday.

Enclosed is a checklist of the Lomax recordings made in
Texas, which are on deposit with the University of 
Texas and for which transcriptions have been made
already. This, however, does not seem to me to include
the whole of our recordings in Texas. I would like
very much for someone in the Archive to prepare a list 
of those songs recorded by the Lomaxes in Texas which 
are not included on the enclosed list, thus I can make
sure that I don't miss anything. If you feel that a 
charge should be made for this service, I would be glad
to pay for the work within some reasonable limits. I
won't need the list until I return from the West Indies 
sometime in May. 

Again, thanks, and regards to you and Jim and Bob and 
Phil.
Sincerely,

Alan
