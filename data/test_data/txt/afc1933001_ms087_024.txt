Mr. John A. Lomax,
7456 San Benito Way,
Dallas, Texas.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Alan Lomax called me today concerning your
request for the BALLAD HUNTER record which contains
programs seven and eight. The record was sent to you
today.

The original supply of fifty sets of the BALLAD
HUNTER recordings have been sold to schools, libraries,
and radio stations. We have purchased a new supply and
are getting ready to launch a promotion campaign in
schools throughout the country. Under separate cover
I am sending you a compilation which lists 2,745 junior
and senior high schools which have recently reported that
that have equipment for playing 16-inch transcriptions
at 33-1/3 RPM. This list will be very helpful in promoting
the sale and use of the BALLAD HUNTER recordings.

Very sincerely yours,
Gordon Studebaker
