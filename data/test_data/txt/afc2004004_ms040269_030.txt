p.4. "Orain Luaidh".

Sister, little sister dear sister
How often were you and I on the hill!-
In a little shieling short and narrow
Without strawrope or any thatch,
The downpour about our heads, yet we would be happy.
Sister, little sister, can you get up?
You cannot, dear you will never get up.
The milk is as you left it yesterday.
The cows and calves are together
The whitebacked brown cow and her own calf along with her.
Where was there ever heard a more plaintive lowing
Than Blackie's lowing or Reddie's lowing
Or your lowing, white-shouldered Happy!
The milkmaid amissing, though it sees the cow herd.
Beloved the foot that herded them.
Dear the hand which held the cowfetter.
I scoured the waste.  I looked the pasture.
I searched the foot and head of the glen.
I searched each place where you would be sporting-
Not struggling with the boys
But sewing shirts and reading books.
I scoured the high ground and did not omit the low ground.
I climbed up the scarred mountain,
Great subhal with the brindled horses
And a little pointed hill on the north side of it.
Young man with the gun, wait till I speak to you.
I will warrant there is blood on your shirt.
It is not the blood of a raven nor the blood of a deer
But the blood of the milkmaid, you slew her yesterday.
You left the maiden of the brown hair lying.
A slender pointed knife wrought my mischief.
It shed blood and severed sinews
And rent her scalp asunder.
