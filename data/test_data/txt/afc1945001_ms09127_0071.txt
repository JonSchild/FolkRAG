[*a*] 

I've heard; 
That practically every ship that goes out
to sea comes back for repairs. 

That when Japs were surrounded by
Americans the Japs began to swear.  A lot of the
Japs can speak good English. 

That when soldiers come home on leave
from the fighting front are anxious to get back
into the fight when their wounds heal.
