he shoved her off and hit there in front of me!  And so we got on
around, and got in, and got his dad's log sled and his yoke of
ox.  And come back there and took a barrel and got a big barrel of
sour wood honey and a box full of them flitters.  And the ducks
and the duck, and the squirrel and the turkey there at the laid
up fence.  And doggone!  We got back in there with a cross-cut saw
and a rope to tie up them there three cubs to take them in.  God he
said he had to have them.  And we got back around there and doggone
we found them 12 turkeys that we though was gone, still in that
limb yet hung in a bunch of bumberry(??).  In an old growed up
field.  And we got on in and I'd go down several trips and eat a 
little of that meat.  But we got down there and he (took out)
his bullets and we run into a bunch of deer!  And I had in my
pocket settin' would have been a help seeding these October
peaches.  He had plenty powder left, he got to shooting deer with
peach seeds!  But he didn't get (unint.) so we took a little hunt,
not long, just went out back down there.  Five year after that(??)
we took a little hunt.  And got in the woods, and a fire had got
out, and burned a big slope.  And so we took a break on account of
the rising of a ridge.  And I sat down on what I thought was a log.
And Jack was on a stump below, just eatin' a little snack of dinner.
A few minutes later, it looked like Jack the stump was riding him
off.  And I'd opened my dinner, and stuck my knife over in the log.
And I hollered, "Jack, is that stump riding you off?" and he said,
"No, Ray, there's nothin' wrong with me" and doggone, when I looked
I was sittin' on a black snake!  I thought it was a log, and when
I put my knife in it put it a cross.  She was fired, and God I was
sittin' on a black snake, it weighed nearly 2 or 300 pounds!
