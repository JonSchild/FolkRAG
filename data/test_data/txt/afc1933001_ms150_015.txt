Dear Mattfeld:

I am under the impression that you still have a number of
my music manuscripts, if so, please mail them to Ruth Crawford,
9609 Fairway Avenue, Silver Springs, Maryland, as soon as possible.
If not, drop her a note saying so. I think I am going to be in
New York, or near New York, most of next week, so I can straighten
out with you the rest of our problems at that time. Charles Seeger
is going to have his scores microfilmed and sent to you soon. Ruth
Crawford and I are going to decide about her place on the program
today and I am on the track of some possible scores for the
symphonic end of the program.

With very best regards,

I am,

Alan Lomax
