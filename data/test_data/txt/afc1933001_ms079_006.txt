Dear Mr. Lomax,

   The loss is mine that you and Mrs. Lomax can't
come to see me. And I can't well get to Washington at
this time.  Worse luck for me!
    I don't think there are any doubting Thomases as
to the value fo the work you have done.
    It is to me a matter of pride that your name should
be associated with that of my Master, Francis Child.
I was almost crazy about old ballads long before I went
to Harvard.
    I have two sons with offices in Washington; both
live this side of the Potomac –– Hugh in Alexandria, and
Joseph in Arlington. My youngest son, Elie,     is in
business in Richmeond.  I have noted with greatest pleasure
that you have a son continuing your great work.

As always, devotedly yours,
Raymond Weeks
