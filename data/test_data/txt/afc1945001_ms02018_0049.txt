Report on Rumors - 8

Price Control
1.  Several people I know have been asked to move because their landlords 
plan to sell the houses which they are renting.  They feel that this may 
be an excuse so they can rent the houses to new people at increased 
rentals.  (Newspaper report.  Phoenix 8-12-42)
2.  I had some painting done recently.  The painter told me he paid very 
near the usual price for the ochre; however it contained a large amount 
of filler and it was therefore necessary to use about three times as 
much of the ochre.  They may not be actually raising prices much, but 
they are getting around the ceilings in one way or another.  (Supervisor

3.  The other day my wife asked me to bring home a package of puffed rice.  She noticed that it was a smaller size, although the price of 12Â¢ 
remained the same.  We investigated and found the last package she had 
purchased contained 8 oz., while the new one contained only 6 oz.

4.  Many items are no longer being produced or carried by stores.  My 
grocery store does not have Libby's peaches, but does have a new brand 
which is higher.  Ceilings are being evaded in many different ways.
