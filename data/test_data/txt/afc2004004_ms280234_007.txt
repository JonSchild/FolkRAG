where there was a lot of bushed. A very gentle place indeed, and 
there was some big rocks there, too, that was very wonderful
lookijg. A gentle place - 'twas full of fairies. But he was going
along and he had his head stooped and he had the fiddle with him.
His courage wasn't good because he only had the one tune, but he
didn't liek to refuse. He'd got to be kind. From this spot I'm
telling ye about out come a wee red-haired man. So the wee red-
haired man saluted him. "Well, my young man," says he, "Heading
out for a journey ?"
"I am," he says. "I'm going to a wedding. Indeed, I don't care
much for going."
"You play the fiddle ?"
"O I play the fiddle," he says, "in a way," he says," and in
another way I don't play it. I only have the one tune. So they're
tqking me to a wedding, and indeed, I'm not going with great
 courage."
"What kind of fiddle have you," the wee man says he. "Show me."
       So the wee red-haired man catched the fiddle and he looked
it over and he runs his hands across the fiddle strings and this
is what he done. (Three plunks.) So he handed her back to him
again. "Now," he says, "young man, go you on to the wedding
tonight, and there'll be no fiddle player like you the night," he
says. "You'll be as good as any as ever went into that same
house."
By gosh, he had some courage then when he heard that. Away he
went and onto the wedding and there was a very big crowd. Every
one knowed him and they knowed him to be a fiddle player that
wasn't good and had only the one tune. But they had a seat
prepared for him when he went in. He took his seat. They all
got out to dance. And that was a fiddle player ! There wasn't
a fiddle player in Ireland like him, and there wasn't a tune of
a hundred tunes but he had. Everyone wondered, and everyone
joined to speak about it, where did he get his music under God !
So here he played away, and he was raising the roof of the house
off with the music.
     So when the wedding was over he went home. And he was the
greatest fiddle player was in Ireland. So he was great all along
all his life, he was taken away many places to play. He was very
good until he took death. So then he wasn't able to follow up the
fiddle much longer. So the fiddle was hung on the wall above his
head where he was laying, and the minute he departed, he died,
the fiddle let a crack on the wall, and she went away in a
hundred bits. It was thr fairies done that. They wouldn't
allow any other one to get a fiddle because she was enchanted...

    He was a fiddle player and he was after coming from a dance,
and the poor fellow had a long way to go home. It come on a very
stormy night, and there was only the one house on this very
lonesome road, and there was no one lived in this house, only
