I Wish I had a nickle, /an' I wish I had a dime, 
[*I*] Wish I had a ginger-snap to pay that woman's fine.   * 
Baby, you don' know, you don' know my min', 
When you see me laughin', laughin' jus' to keep from cryin'. 

Gonna be yo' dog, baby, all my life, 
Cause me to leave my happy home [*baby!*] an' my wife
Baby, you don' know, you don' know my min'. 
When you see me laughin', laughin' jus' to keep from cryin'. 
Looky here, mama, see what you done done , 
You got my money, now you broke an' run 
Baby, you don' know, you don'   knowx my min', 
When you see me laughin', laughin' jus' to keep from cryin'. 

Oh, you needn' git mad, an' you needn' git glad, 
You gonna git sumpin' you ain' never had,   ** 
You don' know , you don' know my min', 
When you see me laughin', laughin' jus' to keep from cryin'. 

*  Ain' with nothin' , dat's what 

**  stick side o' de head
