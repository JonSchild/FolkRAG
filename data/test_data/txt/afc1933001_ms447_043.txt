6  Standing at the station, lookin' at the time,
Number Five runnin' by at half past nine,
From Buffalo to Washington.

7  Yonder comes the train running down the line,
Blowing at every station, McKinley is dying,
Hard times, hard times.

8 Roosevelt's in the White House, drinkin' out of a silver cup,
McKinley's in the graveyard, never waked up,
He's gone a long old time.

JOHN HENRY

Any general collection of American folk songs that does not include the
ballad of John Henry, the Negro steel-drivin' man, would not seem to us
in any wise complete. This almost epic ballad of the industrial revolution
with its lights and shadows from the tunnel workings of the West Virgina
hills, its burly and laughing defiance of the earth and the machine and of
death, is probably America's greatest single piece of folk lore. Although,
therefore, the earlier volume of American Ballads and Folk Songs contains
a long composite version, we are here printing nine stanzas and a tune
recorded near Pine Bluff, Arkansas. It is a western version in which John
Henry is pictured as the Louisiana section-gang worker. We have found no
exact parallel to this stirring air among the thirty or forty versions in the
Library of Congress Folk Song Archive.

"I can tell you all about double-jinted people. You couldn't let them be
prize fighters because any double-jinted man could knock you out. A
double-jinted man, he's got two jints to your one, he's always fat and stout
and everything, and he can just tear you up just like that, you understand.
"I knowed old man Eph Brown, which my father showed him to me
when I was a little small boy. We was down in the gin house where they
was ginning cotton into bales that weighed 550 and 575 pound. Well, it
take four or five men to put a bale on a wagon, but old man Eph Brown
just go there and, 'cause he was double-jinted, just picks up the bale of
cotton, chunk it in the wagon, git in the wagon and go ahead on home.
"Nowadays mighty few men you find 'll be double-jinted. Once I was
a boy, I was about sixteen years old and we was carryin' corn to the mill down
South. I'd always been a good knocker. I could knock with my fists, and I 
run up on a boy, he was double-jinted. Boys round in them times, you know,
was always round talking 'bout one another's knocking, and all the boys
told him, 'You know old Lightnin' is a good knocker.' I could run and
knock. I always tried to be the winner. We wouldn't hit the side of the
head, we would always hit on the breast and in the short ribs and along the
arms. I used to jive 'em by hittin' 'em in the grind, slap 'em with the back
of my hand that way, causin' 'em to bow. Then I'd meet 'em with a blow
in the breast when they'd bow.
"I went up to this fellow, and he looked awful funny, he was bracin'
for a knock. He said, 'Look here, Lightnin', don't you want to knock?' I
said, 'No, I'm out here grindin' corn today; I don't want to knock.' He says,
'Oh, yes, you gotta knock me.' I says, 'Oh, no, I ain't gonna knock.'
I kept lookin' at him and he looked so fat and his arms so big, I says,
'What is you anyhow? You double-jinted?' He say, 'Yeah.' I say, 'Christ,
man, you I'm goin' knock you? I'm single-jinted; I don't knock with
no double-jinted man.' If he want to knock with me, I'm gonna knock with
with a piece of stovewood or something; I ain't gonna knock with no double-jinted
man.
