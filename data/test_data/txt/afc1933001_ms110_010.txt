Dear Johnny: There is no other place
in my knowledge with so
 much [?] as this one and every
 bed on the sleeping porch adds 
the final touch of comfort. As I 
write a mocking bird sings 
happily from a tree near 
my window. You can't buy 
such blessings.

Of course you know that
 I enjoyed hanging around you. 
I think I [?] a compliment 
for refraining from teaching you
 how to [?] (with certain exceptions!

Lovingly,

Father
