Mr. Alan Lomax
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was glad to receive your wire accepting the October 6th engagement
in Newark, N.J. for $100 plane fare from and back to Washington.

The Griffith Music Foundation In Newark, New Jersey holds its all
day conference on music activities for New Jersey on that day. They 
want you to give a program called, "Songs of America" with explanatory
comments and guitar accompaniment. Your program should take twenty
minutes to half an hour.

The Griffith Music Foundation brings the best musical attractions
and does a constructive job in adult education, - particularly in the field
of the arts.

I am glad that you could accept this engagement and hope it will
prove a pleasant experience.

Sincerely yours,
Roxanna Wells
