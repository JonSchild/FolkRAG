thanks to the Farmer's Union for this verse -

On his coat he wears a union button,
He wears it in the winter, and summer, so they say.
And if you ask him why the decoration,
He says, I'm in the union and I'm in to stay.
In to stay, in to stay,
And he wears it milking cows and mowing hay.
'Round the town he wears a union button,
He says, I'm in the union and I'm in to stay.
