Mr. Joseph F. Smith
Department of Speech
University of Wisconsin
Madison, Wisconsin

Dear Mr. Smith:
The records I have made for the Library of
Congress have been confined to music - folk-songs,
chants, "hollers", ballads, etc. I have, therefore,
referred your inquiry for dialect records
to another department of the library which may
be able to give you some worthwhile information.
Sincerely yours,

Honorary Consultant and Curator
Archive of American Folk-song
