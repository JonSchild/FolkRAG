The Devil stole a pumkin,
and he roled it to town,
you could hear it thunder
when he throwed it down.
Chorus
July the rain-low
July the fly
if August ain't a hot month
I pray to die.
Chorus
I been roling, on the county so long
Every Body on the county
call me roling Stone.
if any Body ask you. Who compose
this Song Just tell James Dixon
Called Rolling Stone. [End.]
