No matter what the world say about you-
Preach the word.
Don't be discouraged-
Preach the word, everywhere you go.
Preach it
in the morning.
Preach it 
when they shut doors in your face
God will make room for you.
God will open doors for you.
Preach the word.
Be a messenger for God.
Preach it 
everywhere you go.
Preach it wxxx
with tears in your eyes.
If you sow in tears
You shall reap in joy.
Likey, Isaiah, I heard him say,
"For time's sake, I won't hold my peace
And for Jerusalem's sake, I'll not rest
Until I
Out here in the 
Out here on the
Out yonder,
All kinds of crimes and follies is going on.
Preach the word.
The word of God.
Preach the word.
It'll save somebody's soul.
Preach the word,
Everywhere you go.
How can we hear without a preacher?
Somebody must have ears.
Somebody must hear.
Somebody, my friends, must preach.
And somebody must hear.
Faith come by hearing.
Hearing the word of God.
And my brethering-ah,
I'm glad,
More than forty years ago
God made me
One of his messengers.
I told him I wasn't prepared.
I told him I was too ig'n'ant.
I told him I didn't know how to go.
But God said, "You go
And I'll go with you.
I'll take part in what you say."
And, thank God, I'm happy tonight,
For being counted in that number,
A messenger for God.
