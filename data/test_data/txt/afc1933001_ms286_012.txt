Folk Lore Collecting

   Perhaps, the primary characteristics of folklorist is that
all folk-lorists must eat.  This is one of the reason
why there are so many breeds of folk-lorists -
why so many folk-lorists are amateurs - begin
amateurs and remain amateurs.  I must explain this.

   The total body of folk-lore - tales, songs, dances,
superstitions, riddles, patterns of thinking --
have been the property, as long as there has been
a study of folk-lore, at least - of a group of
people who were, at best illiterate and, in our
modern time, underpriviledged, and at worst,
hungry, uncomfortable, and all the rest.
