to Uncle Gene, but she got to her gran'maw.
An' so, anyhow, after I was born an' she done come to 
Dawson, nen (then), nen, I was a big girl; I was big girl. I
was 8 years old. They carried me up there to see; she wanted to 
see her chilren 'cause, [they] see, Abbott an', an' Georgia, ah, was
born when Mama left there. But the other chillun wasn't born, 
ya see? Aunt Lilla had five. An' so we went on up there.
That's when I hurt my laig runnin' from that man with the
long hair. I know I tol' ya about that, all that long, I couldn't
stan' it. Had too long hair, that's all!
Us went on up there. We stopped, ah, ah, in Smithville. In, ah,
in That where I hurt my laig, runnin'. Anyway, that's 
where I tell ya about the man tried to rob my grandmaw an' them?
(I TRANSCRIBED THIS STORY FROM TAPE LAST FALL - D.H.) Us was
goin' out to the place tryin' to find Mama, Mama's sister's
house; the man carried us the wrong way, an', an' ah, Grandmaw
spoke...
AL: You told it to Toni?
BJ: Yeah. I know I did. An', an' my gran'maw...an' my granmaw done
spoke an' say, "Daughter," say, "If we had any money," said,
"We'd get a hack." You know, didn't have no cabs, then. An' no
sooner she said that, that man ducked right around that corner,
an' lef' 'em. An' Mama [was tellin'] kep' a-sayin', sayin', said, "Look like we
on our way to Shooberg Creek." Said, "Look like Shooberg here."
Hadn't been there in years, ya know, but it was night an' she jus',
jus' 'sembled how it, how it looked. She said, "Well,
I haven't seen the graveyard," said.
An', "No, I know 'zactly where Lilla stay! I know Lilla!"
That what the man tol' Mama.
She asked him did he know 'er.
