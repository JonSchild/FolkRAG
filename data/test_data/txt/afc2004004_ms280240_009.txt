Jeannie: My mother, she'd a lot of old songs. She wasn't what
you would call a singer, but she had the airs to the songs.
Lomax: When would she sing a song like that?
Jean: Well, she'd sing a song like that when she had no worries
or nothing. When she'd be about the house when we were little.
Lomax: You didn't understand all that when you were a little
girl. You couldn't have understood what all these sad love songs
would be about.
Jean: Well they impressed me so much. I had a keen ear for to
get them. But none of the rest of the family sings. I mean, my
mother when she sang those songs, she also told them to you like
a story. She interested you to listen to them.
Lomax: How would she do that?
Jean: She justmade a little story - turned the song into a story.
Lomax: She would tell you about a girl that this and that
happened to?
Jean: Yes, she told us about the girl it happened to.
Lomax: Do you remember how she explained it?
Jean: She'd just tell us that this girl had been in love with
a man and he was in love with her. And finally, after she had
fell with a child to him, he deserted her, and she was broken-hearted
over him because she still loved him, and he'd tooken
up with another girl and throwed her over.
Lomax: She wouldn't tell it about any special girl
Jean: Just the song she spoke about, and we was all ears. Maybe
some of them didna listen, but I used to listen.
Lomax: Would you imagine yourself in the story?
Jean: No, I never imagined myself in the story, but I liked to
hear it. That was one thing that I did like to hear, was an old
song turned into a story. And really, these songs did come from
true things, ye see. I mean, they were usually made up, but it
was really true. These old songs was really made up of true
happenings.
Lomax: You mean, she could tell you the facts and backgrounds to
some of the songs?
Jean: Yes she could. Because these songs actually did come from
the real thing.
