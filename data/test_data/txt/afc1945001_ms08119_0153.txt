Anecdote

A man was helping a lady file her income tax. 
He asked her if her husband brought home the income. 
She immediately answered "no" I have brought it home 
for the last 23 years. "Well" he said "in that case we 
will put him in a division all by himself" To this she 
replied "Not that big cow, he would not fit in one." The next 
question was "Does your husband make you go to work?" 
"No" she said "he just gets me up and I go on my 
own free will." "Then does your husband have the 
meal ready?" "Oh! Oh! dont ask such a question" 
"Why" asked the man. Well with what food we have, 
he makes for supper, but there is nothing left for me. 
By this time the man was getting mad. He gave her 
the papers to take home and said "File out your 
own income tax lady, and forget about your husband.
