     (You prefer not to talk about these things?)
     NAW. . .I jes say. . .yuh yuh yuh yuh. . .(Head sinks down
on his breast and he sleeps)
     (I don't want you to talk about anything you don't want 
to talk about, Reverend Davis.) (He wakes up immediately)
     I'll talk bout anything you want me to talk about,
understan.  But what I'm fishin fur. . .You don't know what's in my
heart; neither do I know what's in yours.  But heah is one thing about it;
I believe what's in my heart is in yours.  I believe all will come together
as one hand of people in a socialized way.  Make no exceptions.
     (I believe that time will come.  It will have to come.
We can't tolerate so much cruelty in our human family.  We will
have to band together and cast out those members of our human family
who treat others cruelly. By some means. . .When you said earlier
that you might be killed for talking about these things, do you
mean that literally.  That yo u really might be killed for saying
some things?)  (He does not answer.  He seems to be sleepy and 
mistrustful today) (He sleeps a spell)
     (Do you ever expect to go back South, Rev. Davis, to
stay there?)
     No Ma'am!
     (You'd rather stay up here?)
     Yes'um.
     (Why is that?)
     (No answer. Then) I feel I can be mo happier up heah.
     (I feel that myself.  I found that I could not
visit and talk with my colored friends down South without getting
us all into trouble, or getting someone killed.  So it's better to 
live up here.)
