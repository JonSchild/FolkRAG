MEMORANDUM
From Alan Lomax
To the Chief of the 
Dr. Spivacke, Chief Division

December 14, 1940

Dear Dr. Spivacke:
Due to extremely heavy correspondence during the 
past year, my Archive mail now amounts to at least two trays
full, not counting miscellaneous papers which I can't file at 
all.  I very urgently need a section of filing cabinet, three 
or four trans deep, to take care of this problem.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
