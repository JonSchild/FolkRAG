Division of Music
January 19, 1939


     I recommend that Mr. Alan Lomax be authorized to transfer
his activities to New York City from February 1, 1939 to June 1,
1939, on a half-time basis during which period he is to receive
half of his present salary.  I recommend further that, while in
New York City, Mr. Lomax be authorized to negotiate for the
rental of a recording studio to be used in making records for
the Archive, to encourage gifts to the Archive from commercial
recording companies and others, and to carry on research for the 
Archive as directed by the Chief of the Music Division.

      I recommend also that Mr. Lomax make periodic visits to
Washington (possibly once a month) to report on his progress and
that he receive railway fare and per diem for there trips as
well as railway fare for his initial trip to New York and his
return to Washington in June, to be charged to Increase.

           Chief, Division of Music
