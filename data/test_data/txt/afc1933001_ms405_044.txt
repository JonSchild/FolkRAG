ED NICHOLS' STORY

I just went up to Cleburne and got up against a brace game.
But I had nigger luck. I believe I could a-drawrd to a cowship and
caught a pair of oxen. I'd got 3's but would hold them and draw to
a sider and would always catch a card to make my 3's a four. Three
times I got four ones, you couldn't beat that. I won that night 800
and odd dollars. I was playing with a bunch of regular gamblers who
would cold deck or cross left a stranger. The waiter, in cold decking,
brings in a fixed deck and the dealer swaps the decks while the bunch
is taking their drinks.
I was riding around from one town to another sporting. I would
put up my horse in a livery stable and stay as long as I wanted to.
I started the next day after I won the money to ride from Cleburne to
Waco. Night overtook me in the cross timbers. I came to a cabin that
night after late bedtime. It was sleeting and snowing. They had a
fire in the fireplace. I asked to stay all night. I slept in a side
room. The bed filled the room so that you had to jump up to get your
breeches off. You couldn't sit down on the side of the bed. The woman
was barefooted and so was the kids. The next morning they were ashamed
to come up to the fire in their ragged clothes and I had to beg them.
If I do say it myself I am good-hearted. I heard the woman say before
I got up that she was afraid she didn't have enough coffee to make the
stranger a good cup. But there was enough. They had only one plate.
They had corn dodger, and a little grease and molasses. They had butter
and milk for in them days range cattle gave everybody plenty of milk
