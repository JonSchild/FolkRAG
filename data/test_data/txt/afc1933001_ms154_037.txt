My dear Mr. Lomax;
Mr. Augustus D. Zanzig, of our National Recreation Association,
has written me most enthusiastically about your collection of Negro
folk music and as I expect to be in Washington the week of March 10,
I hope it will be possible for me to hear these records.
Immediately upon my arrival in Washington I will get in
touch with you and come at your most convenient time.
Thanking you in advance for this courtesy and with kind regards,
believe me
Sincerely yours,
Clarence Cameron White
