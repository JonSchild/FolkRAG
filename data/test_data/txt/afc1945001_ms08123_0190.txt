decided to take it upon himself to knock that off the map. It was a fight to the finish, and getting that Jap was no easy job, but in the end ole Pvt. Rox got him. He was excited he forgot he had been shot in the shoulder. He went to pull his landing gear out, and to his supprise his arm would not budge. Then there was a crash, and there was Pvt. Rox in his burning plane with no one around to get him out. So with all this private smartness he wasn't smart enough to wait until someone was around to help him before he tried to bring down a Jap plane.
