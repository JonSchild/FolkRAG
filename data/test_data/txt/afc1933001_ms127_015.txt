Further apologies: But I wonder whether someone there would feel like taking
a little time to do a favor for Henry Cowell? I would ask Mr. Seeger but he
is so very busy just now. Henry contemplates writing a book on rhythm and is 
under the impression that this has not been done but would like to make sure
what there is and whether he has been forestalled. Our conversation was so
full of things and the hour seemed so short that he did n't devote much time
to explanation of what he plans, but from what I know of his interests it would
probably deal with the development of rhythmic resources among primitive peoples
such as the Balinese & etc. I can't see Henry again for a month; and as he can
write only a single letter a day and has a great deal of routine business to
transact because he has had his finger in so many pies, I undertook to make this
inquiry for him and ask someone there to write him direct or else relay the
information through me. (H. C. , San Quentin, California, is sufficient.) He
can receive any number of letters.
If someone would take a hasty glance through the volumes on the subject of
rhythm to see whether anyone has dealt at all exhaustively with primitive
rhythmic systems, he would appreciate it enormously, and I feel it would be a 
great kindness. Also I think any time one is able to spend furthering Henry's
work is likely to prove a good investment from the point of view of musicology.
Many thanks....
