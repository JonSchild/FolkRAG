Dear Friend:

We are attaching an appeal directed to all organized labor
and progressives to assist us in helping the migratory workers of
America, the sharecroppers of the South and the sugar beet workers of
the Rocky Mountain area.

THE GRAPES OF WRATH book and movie have publicized the conditions
of many of these people throughout the nation. Our Union has
153 locals among these people in mountain states and Canada, with a
total membership of 75,000.

We are not appealing for funds to help us organize. We
are appealing for funds to help us educate leaders among these people
who have already been active, so that these people may help themselves
through union organization.

These workers are largely paying their own way out of their
meagre earnings in developing their organization, but they do need
help to educate and train leaders. We urge that you do two things:

1. Contribute as much money as you can to help us meet
the expenses of these three schools, and

2. Through personal letters to individuals and groups with
whom you have contacts, request that they contribute
as much as possible.

Sincerely yours,
uopwa 27
Donald Henderson
Donald Henderson, General President

P.S. America's migrants, sharecroppers, beet workers and
other agricultural workers are the problem of the entire labor movement
and not just our union. Their unemployment and low wages undermine
wages and jobs everywhere and weaken the entire progressive and labor
movement.
