Dear Dave:
     I am sorry I did not see you in New York, both, for 
holiday reasons and because from what Nick tells me, your 
opinion of "BACK WHERE I COME FROM" is not what it should be. 
Our mail, of which the two enclosures are typical, seems to 
me clearly indicative that our audience is so far a rather 
articulate and highly critical one, who feel that the program 
has something very important to say. I think it has too, and I 
can't understand why your attitude towards it has changed. I 
believe in it enough to want to continue working on it in spite 
of the difficulties that my new job as radio fellow will entail, 
and I'm going to hire an assistant to take care of some of the 
details of my several small concerns, and incidentally, stop this 
eternal problem of clearance of BACK WHERE I COME FROM. That's 
a mechanical matter which I can hire the disposition of. Before 
taking this step, I'd like some (friendly, unofficial, nor in the 
slightest contractual) assurance from you that BACK WHERE I COME FROM 
has a clear road ahead for some time. Morally and artistically, I 
feel it should have, although, I know it's many problems for all of 
us. I also know if it's many strong points. 
     I've had a grand Christmas, flat on my back, lolling about 
and gossiping with old tried and true friends. My best wishes for the 
New Year from Elizabeth and me to you both.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                             Alan
