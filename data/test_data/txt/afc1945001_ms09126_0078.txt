Remember Pearl Harbor!

I think that most mothers that had a boy or
boys at Pearl Harbor at the time it was bombed
that were killed or injured should try to forget
Pearl Harbor. Would you feel gay if your only son
were killed by some danger they didn't know
existed. Could you go to some party or show and
have a pleasant time, knowing that your son
was buried somewhere in the Philippine
Islands and that you would never see him
again. This may be the wrong attitude toward
Pearl Harbor.
