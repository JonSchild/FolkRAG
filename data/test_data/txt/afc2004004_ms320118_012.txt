Canray:..... I remember when I was born and raised there, 
Well them wolves really had a bunch of money and they had
everything. And like a black man, they didn't want him to 
have a good horse to ride or something like that. One of
the biggest messes.... I remember whenever a brown boy would
go somewhere at night, and they go around them big shot
places at night....Everybody was walking, or riding their
horse.......While I was born and raised there, that old man
there, he didn't want a black man to have a good horse or
nothing and whenever he would see one with a good, nice 
riding horse, or something like that, he attacked Fremou(?)
one time, I believe with a post or something. Tried to his
Fremou(?) cause Fremou had a nice horse or something. People
wouldn't imagine...just like myself, that when I started 
going to school....what we had was 3 months of school....I
stayed stupid all my life....Where Alphonse lived, our teacher
would go around there, teaching. From then on, she would move
to my territory, and teach. You had to be kind of sharp to
make a grade in two years. And you know what they would teach
them, and themold....some of them would believe that too,
them old rich fella would go and say, don't send that little
nigger to school. All he's gonna learn is to go and make a
check, and he gonna send himself to the penitentiary. Send 
him to work...I'm telling you what I know. But Inever had
too much of a hard time, cause my daddy was a musician, long
as I ever known him.
