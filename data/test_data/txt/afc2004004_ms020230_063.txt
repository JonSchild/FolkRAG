everything over there.  An' goin' down through the field with that
thing!  "Hey!  Come 'ere!  Come 'ere!"   Everybody callin' 'em!
"Soda water man!   Peanut man!"  All kinda things; it's just that
way.
       So the peoples, that way, makes good.   I'm tellin' ya, it's
really good.
TL:   Salt water man, do you say?
BJ:   Soda water.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, they, they call it "soda water," most of
it, but hit's a drink, you know?   You, you wouldn't say, "Coca-Cola
man;" you wouldn't say, "Pop man," or whatnot.  Because they
sellin' all kindsa drinks.  An' say. . .An' they come an' bring ya
all kindsa diffrunt drinks.   An' they, they have buckets of these
drinks with ice in it.
       An' some of 'em high enough to have beer in there with ice
in it, on it, in the cans, ya know?   An' in the bottle, too.  [Jus'] They'll
tote it right on down the field.   So there you go!   The devil
come in there, in, too, ya know.  He comes in there with his
stuff.  An' ya don't care where ya see a crowd, he's there.  An' 
they have that beer in there.  Ha, ha, yessir!
TL:   Did many people drink beer in the field?
BJ:   Well, a lot of 'em.  Those that drinked it; if they wanted to 
drink it, they get some. . .
TL:   Did they get drunk?
BJ:   No, oh no.  Never had it; never seen it.  Never seen [one]
none drunk in the field.  Because [they ain't git] when they git -- [Those] Them fields
too wide an' open, ya know?   Nobody lay there in the hot sun, that way,
ah, go. . .But I guess if they want to get drunk, they go to the
jook -- [up] or to the, ah, where, where they could [get drunk] enjoy it.
TL:   They wear it off, though, in the fields?
