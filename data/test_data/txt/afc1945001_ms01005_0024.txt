Mr. William H. Webber

Field Representative - Alabama
Daughters of Eleanor Clubs

We have heard reports and rumors
of Eleanor Clubs among Negro domestic
servants in the South for some months.
Prior to your telegram of August 21,
we had made an extensive check in
various parts of Alabama to determine
the authenticity of the reports.
Following receipt of your request we
made a follow-up check at various points.
At no time have we found any first hand
or concrete evidence of such organizations
among Negro women.
Reliable Negro sources formed the greater
part of our contacts for this check.
