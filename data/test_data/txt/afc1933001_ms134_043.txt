variety of such places could, of course, be almost
endless. For example:

The French Quarter of New Orleans with the
marvelous Creole food, drink, songs and stately
and elegant dances of that by-gone day;

A Pennsylvania Dutch tavern drawn from the
culture of that as yet large and flourishing enclave
in the Pennsylvania hinterlands;

A Haitian house with voodoo dances, the exquisite 
Haitian cuisine and the tempestuous history
of this island for dramatic materials;

A real Western saloon with cow-boys, miners,
gambling sharks and gay ladies, serving venison
steak and whiskey with saddle nails for chasers;

A down-Easter fish house with the shanties
and the ballads that have grown up along the New
England sea coast;

A Mexican patio with hot tamales, tacos and
tequilla vendors where the ballads and religious
festivals of Northern Mexico and Southwestern United
States would provide the color and entertainment;

An Acadian Fais-do-do hall with crÃªpes-suzettes
and French wine, with music and dances that are
still performed in Southwestern Louisiana, Southeastern
Missouri, Western Indiana and French Canada;

A Negro church social out of the back country
with preaching, praying, singing and the type of
dance that is allowed in Negro churches (you must not
cross your feet at any time);

A Hawaiian house without steel guitars or ukeleles,
serving poi, baked fish and okolehao. 

Now I should like to sketch the way in which these
concessions should be set up. Two examples:

1) Square Dance Hall - This concession should be
built as follows:
