My dear Mr. Brock:

Let me acknowledge with appreciation the check 
for $500.00 which was received this morning, representing
the study-aid grant award to Mr. Alan Lomax for the
study of anthropological and linguistic methods of 
musicological research at Columbia University in 1939-
1940.

For the librarian,
Very sincerely yours,

Chief Assistant Librarian
