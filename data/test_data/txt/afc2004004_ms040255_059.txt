He is a pupil of Willie Hunter, the blacksmith, and Dean of all 
Shetland fiddlers, and, in my view, the pupil is nowadays at 
least as good as his master. 

This particular tune is more or less a musical joke, describing 
the pompous march of a fine fat fowl to a ripe and juicy midden, 
where, after a bit of scratching, she lights on a few tasty morsels, 
which cause her almost to crow with delight. It is very well 
suggested, both in the music and in this particular playing. The 
recording was made in the little village of Scalloway last Christmas. 
The tune is seldom used for dancing. 

3. GREENLAND REELS 

There are two tunes on the disk, which I return. Again 
they are played by Taamie Anderson, this time without accompaniment. 
Both these tunes came to Shetland round about a hundred years ago, 
when the whale fishing was in full swing. In these days hundreds 
of Shetland fisherman joined the whaling ships from all the ports 
in the East of Scotland, which pushed North into the Greenland sea 
beyond Weddell Island. There they met both Danish and Norwegian 
whalermen, and very often they had a session of playing their tunes 
to each other. The two tunes on this disk were brought back in 
this way. I haven't been able to trace their origins in either 
Denmark or Norway. It is quite possible that hey were in fact 
composed by Shetland fishermen on the spot and named aftr a place 
and a character. The tunes, I am assured, have more than a family 
resemblance to the Norwegian "Halling", believed to be the ancestor 
of all Scots reels. 

These two tunes are (a) Willifiord (sometimes known as 
Villaford) and (b) Oliford Jack (also known as Olifiord Jack and 
Olafirth Jack). It is worth noting that, in addition to the 
origin of these tunes, they illustrate particularly well the 
traditional Shetland style of fiddle playing, which tends to be 
more legato than the normal Scots reel style, and is also markedly 
accented on the first beat of every bar. 

A yellow pencil mark roughly indicates the end of Willifiord 
and the beginning of Oliford Jack. This, too, was recorded last 
Christmas at Scalloway. 

These tunes are always played as a pair, and are in great 
demand at all Shetland dances.
