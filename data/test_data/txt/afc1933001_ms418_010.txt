THE WORKERS' CRY OF FREEDOM
"Women's Auxiliary Theme Song. Tune:
Marching Through Georgia.)

The men are in the factories sitting in a strike, we know,
Holding down production so that we can get more dough.
The Union's organizing, and we'll see that it is so,
Shouting the Union forever;

Chorus:
Hurrah, hurrah, the Union makes us free;
Hurrah, hurrah, it's all for you and me.
Organize your brothers and we'll win the fight, you'll see,
Shouting the Union forever:

The women got together and they formed a mighty throng.
Every worker's wife and mom and sister will belong.
They will fight beside the men to help the cause along,
Shouting the Union forever:

Homer Martin is the leader of this might band,
And we'll stand behind him for the future of the land;
We won't give up the battle 'till we get our just demands,
Shouting the Union forever;

When the battle's over and we're back to work once more,
There will not be a single scab inside the factory door;
the men will wear their buttons and the bosses won't get sore,
Shouting the Union forever:

ON TO VICTORY
(Tune: On Wisconsin)
On to victory,  on to victory, right down to the plant;
Round the work-shop we will picket, and we'll hold our stand,
Rah, Rah, Rah!
We're no quitters, all sure hitters, work with heart and soul.
STRIKE, fellows, FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT, and we'll win our goal.

CHEER UP, FELLOWS
(Tune: Notre Dame's Victory March)
Cheer up, fellows, we're  here for a fight.
We'll stick, boys, any time, day or night.
We want you to know we're here for our rights,
Down on the picket, picket line.

If you're in trouble, please let us know.
We'll save your families from all the foes.
We brigades have an "Ace in the Hole",
So: ONWARD TO VICTORY!
