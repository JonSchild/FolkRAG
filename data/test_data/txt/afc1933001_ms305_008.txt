Wade Ward (above) is the
brother of Uncle Crockett Ward.
He plays banjo, in the old-time
way, for the "Bog Trotters," and
does a solo number now and then
in their entertainments. The banjo,
though an instrument developed
by the American negro
and related to one of the native
African instruments, long has
been indespensable in a mountain
square dance group. Like all the
others in the group, Wade Ward
can sing many of the old ballads
himself, and like the others, too,
he just picked up the banjo because
everybody there learns to
play or sing or dance well enough
to contribute to the general entertainment.
