Reel 16-3 --  Colin's Cow (transition)
  Colins wife was taken away
by the fairies + [her neighbor] Colin
used to milk his cows & [she] he
sang
   (1) I will not sleep
        "   "     "      "
        "   "     "      "
        Until what has been taken
        away from me returns

   May Colin's Cattle of my love
   "         "          "        "    "  heart
   "         "          "        "    " give me
           plenty of milk
      without any [?] tethers

In the olden days if the calf died - they
used to make an effigy of the calf
with the skin on it so the old cow
would smell it + give the milk
 
pause at 1:45
   (2) Many a time I am heartsick
        And tears in my eyes
        As I think on my loved ones
        And what's away from me
       Cho[rus]
2:45
Cho[rus] repeats twice
[twice] to
to 3:45
(Milking continues for 10 sec to 4)
