I phoned Peggy (Seeger) to tell her I
wouldn't be going to her concert. And when
I told her I had shingles, she was horrified &
said that her brother nearly went blind when
he had it! And that night & all day Sunday
I was flat on my back, I had these simply
dreadful pains in my head that almost
paralysed me every time I opened by eyes
or tried to move them, and I wept into my
pillow thinking I was going blind, and as
it was Sunday, we couldn't get hold of the
doctor. I was scared to death, and I
thought I'd never see your face again.
Aren't people morbid when they're sick!
Anyway- I'm fine again now, except
that the rash tickles me mad, & I have a
strange constriction in my chest & cotton wool
knees. But, dear forgetful friend, I did
need a letter. Everyone in the family was
out working - except for the weekend, thank
heavens, - & you know how frightening it
is to be sick alone. And depressing. So
why don't you write?
