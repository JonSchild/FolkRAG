Mr. Alan Lomax
Washington, D.C.

that is the first printed copy of the song we have found,
and obviously to be considered traditional or in the public
domain, we must show publication or dedication prior to 
that date.

Ramos states in his affidavit that he is a Mexican,
and that he composed the song himself in 1915, but did not
publish it until 1927, when he immediately filed it in Washington.
He states further that the music is new and original,
that the words are new and original, and both words and music
were composed by him. He also states that he and his company
sang the song on tour in 1915, up through 1927 while on tours
in Mexico and in many southern States, including El Paso,
Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, but that he did not actually
publish it until 1927.

We have heard that it was actually published by him
in 1915, but have been unable to trace this rumor. Other vague
information is contained on page 5 of the Hollywood Reporter,
for October 17th, 1936, under a Mexican dateline, to the effect
that Ramos had sued one Fuentes for infringement of his copyright
on "Rancho Grande", and that the Court had dismissed the
suit, holding the song was in the public domain. We do not
know what jurisdiction this case came to trial in in Mexico.

What we wish to find is some evidence that the song
is traditional and folk lore. Your kindly assistance will be
much appreciated. We are also writing to your father.

Our case will appear in Court again on April 18th,
but if you secure a definite lead we may obtain an adjournment
of a couple of weeks further.

Sincerely yours,
William H. Darrow
