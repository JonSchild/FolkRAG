I never set no store on money. I never was no trouble bout it. 
When that go it go, I never think no more about it. (Laughs)
Money never troubled me. [Sentence???] They were hard times, many a time I've heard him say.
Lomax: This business of sending people to Australiafor14years for
pacohing. That's just incr dible; it's so cruel. To send a man 
across the sea from his family for killing a cople of few ducks 
or a deer. 
Cox: Well, that's how there ?  ?   ?  ?  lying about used to do. 
That was done.
Lomax: I guess in your father's time they were punishing people pretty
severely for poaching, weren't they?
Cox: Oh, yes, they were on the lookout always for them. They would 
search em', see if they had a net or anything on ['om] you. These old woods they
had man traps, you know. They [are] were in [old] the museum now. They
were where I seen em. They'r good old traps, you know. They're
about that length---they got three, two old jaws, and three 
spikes on em, about that long. (L: surprised; How long?) About
that. (L:[two three] a couple inches long.) And they got two springs, they
got spring at both ends, these traps./You get in andthen[And then] you can't get
your leg out./ And if they catch your leg you're settin there feet just won't get out.
Po-chin at night, they got you. Yhuywent in there. They used
to set em. The old traps in there now. You got your leg in,
that would come up here somewhere, and this old spike went in
your leg, there was two springs andyou con't bear against your
leg andyou couldn't get out anyhow, not nicely. There was one 
at each end. (L: Probably break yo rleg.) Likely they would.
Good old traps they were there. I seen em. Man traps.
