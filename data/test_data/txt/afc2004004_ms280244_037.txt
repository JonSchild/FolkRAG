sing...
(What did they accuse you of?)
They caught me for singing that slur against the..against the
British army. It was...it's no supposed to be sung in the British
army, it's no supposed to be sung nowhere,no of them. Not supposed
in the street there. It was when I got up in the street there
they caught me. I don't know for here but they held me up in the 
North, there and...I got off for ten shillings of a fine.
(What wouldhappen to you if you sang it in the army?)
Ah, you'd get worse...you'd get shot
