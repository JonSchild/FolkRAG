Dear Mr. Lester:
Dr. John A. Lomax writes me that he is
submitting a request for a renewal of his grant for
work in the field in connection with out "Archive of
American Folk Song". I need scarcely support it by
an assurance of our belief in the skill, enterprise, 
and sincerity of the work that he is doing and in
the importance of the results.

I therefore, of course, very earnestly 
hope that his application will succeed.

Faithfully yours,

Librarian
