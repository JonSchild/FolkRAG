work more hours & move
effectively. The only trouble 
with these Irish is 
that they take more treating 
than any group I've
struck. It may be that 
I'll need another $50 
advance. At least you 
can help extensively by 
airmailing my salary
to me at Charlevoix,
as much in advance as 
you can arrange.
Yours
