For the past seven years the Library of Congress has
sponsored field recording of American Folk Songs under the
Archive of American Folk Song. Recently, a grant was secured
from the Carnegie Foundation to install equipment in the Library
of Congress for duplicating the four thousand or more field
phonograph folk songs so secured. Through this equipment, copies
of these records will be available to the general public at cost
of duplication. A check-list of the songs in the Archive is in
preparation and will be published within the next two or three
months for general distribution.

Transcribed and reviewed by contributors participating in the By The People project at crowd.loc.gov.
