AL: Bessie, were there any Negroes in your county who ever fought
back against [xx] the                                     ?
BJ: Against the...? Oh, yea. Plenty of 'em fight . Ya hear
talk of 'em. You know, ah fight with the people, you know, that wa'
not, not for the treatment they got [xx] but from the, from the, 
if they come [xx] an' try to beat 'em up or sumpin' like that,
you know some of 'em'll fight for they life. An' git -- aw, if
they git killed. An' if they have to run away. I hear talk
of plen'y of 'em doin' that way, you know.  Leavin' a [xxxxx] place, be-
because they had, they, because they had hit that man.  Or had to
beat 'im up. An' they leave.
There's a man there in Fitzgerald there was a, oh, was a policeman.
He walked bent over. Almost face -- almost to the ground. Be-
because a man broke his back.
AL: How did that happen?
BJ: I don' know how it happen, but he told us that a colored
man broke his back. He still was a policeman. An' he said, uh,
uh, [xx], an' he's scared of 'em. He, ha, ha, ha! [xxx] In a way
of speakin', though, he, he jus' didn' [x] 'low 'em no more chance
no more. You see, you know, he, he's, he's rather shoot. An'
his back was broke. Colored man broke his back for arrestin'
him for nothin'. So.
Anyway, I said that, so this day, always was some of 'em.
S-somebody's gonna do sumpin' some time. But some of 'em jus'
gonna leave ya, an' go on away from around ya. An' some of 'em,
ah, ah, really will fight back. An' some of 'em'll fight back
an' go ov' yonder to the next white person an' tell 'im about 
it. An' that white person'll back up for ya. You, you, you
know, go an' talk to 'em; wouldn't let 'em bother ya. They just
be good an' back all the way through, see? Some is better'n
