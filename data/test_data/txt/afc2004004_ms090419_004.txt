Greensnake had a yardboy working for him . He told that

he saw that halter was choking that hoss and he hollered to the yardboy, 
say, "Pull that halter off that hoss so he can drink some water."
Yardboy said, "Mister Greensnake told me, whatever I ever do, don't
never do that."

halter off. The stallion cut a somersault, turned into a catfish, 
jumped into the sea.

This yardboy ran back up the hill, told Mister Greensnake

turned into an alligator eighteen feet long, got in after the
catfish and run him all over the sea.
