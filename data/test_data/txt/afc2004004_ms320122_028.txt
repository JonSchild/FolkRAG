CAJUN/MR. FOUGET   -27
A. LOMAX  Uh-huh.
WOMAN  I go to the dance, my mama was with
me.  Oh yeah.  I never go by, with just my boyfriend.  I had
to. . .
MR. FOUGET  You could walk. . .
WOMAN  She have to come.
MR. FOUGET  You could walk with a girl
and bring her back, you know, at night, like this, you know.
But don't scratch yourself because you'd scratch that old
lady.  She was right there, right behind you.  [LAUGHTER]
A. LOMAX  How did you happen to meet him
and fall in love with him?
WOMAN  Well, I live in [Henessey,
BoBridge], and he came cut some sugar cane.
MR. FOUGET  I, I'd haul sugar cane to the
refinery every year.  I'd go over there.  That's how I met
her.  But I had made up my mind I wasn't going to get
married.  I wasn't going to get married never.  Anyway, I
went over there and I saw her and right away I knew I was
going to marry her.  Funny thing.  I even came back here but
I had to go back.
A. LOMAX  Well what did you think when
you saw him?
WOMAN  Oh, it was like him. I love him the
first time I saw him.  [LAUGHTER]
