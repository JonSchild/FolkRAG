The Old Chisholm Trail

New stanzas would sometimes grow out of such a song fest.

Early one morning "Curly" Duncan and I started for a ride from 
his ranch house in Burnet County, Texas. Suddenly Curly spurred his 
horse away from me, chanting as he did so:

"Come on, Lomax, we're off to punch dogies, 
Got nothing to smoke but a little bunch of stogies, 
Coma-ti-yi-yippy-yippy-yea,
Coma-ti-yi-yippy-yippy-yea"

Here is a group of stanzas which doubtless grew up in much 
the same was as Curly Duncan made up his stanzas. I printed these stanzas 
in order first in Cowboy Songs, 1910. They have been printed many, many 
times:

Come along, boys, and listen to my tale, 
And I'll tell you of my torubles on the old 
Chisholm Trail.
 
Coma ti yi yippy, yippy yea, yippy yea, 
Coma ti yi yippy, yippy yea. 

I startedup the trail October twenty-third
I started up the trail with the 2 U herd.

Oh, a ten-dollar horse and a forty-dollar saddle,
And I'm going to punchin' Texas cattle.

I woke up one morning on the old Chisholm Trail,
A rope in my hand and a cow by the tail.

I'm up in the morning before daylight
And afore I sleep the moon shines bright.

Old Ben Bolt was a mighty fine man,
You'd know there was whisky wherever he'd a-land.

My hoss throwed me off at the creek called Mud,
My hoss throwed me off front of the U 2 herd.

Last time I saw him he was going cross the level, 
Kickin' up his heels and a-runnin' like the devil.
