Dear Mr. Haygood:

     Thank you for your nice letter. The application
blanks have gone out to the people concerned with a plea
for speed.

     Mr. Lomax is in the hospital for a few days. He
was very happy to see your letter and sends you his best
regards. He, too, hopes to get a chance to see you before
the army claims you.

     Thanking you for your kindnesses, I am,

     Sincerely yours,

     Secretary to Alan Lomax
     Division of Educational Services

P.S. I am enclosing a letter to Mr. Weaver, which was forwarded
       here in error.
