No. 61 

Come now, my dear brethren, I bid you farewell,
I'm going to travel to preach the gospel-- 
I'm going to travel the wilderness through ; 
Therefore, my dear brethren, I bid you adieu. 

To think of our parting, doth cause me to grieve, 
Though well do I love you, yet you I must leave-- 
My Jesus commands me, and I must obey, 
Therefore, my dear brethren, don't grieve after me. 

May heaven protect you, be Jesus your guide, 
In the wave of our Zion, may you all abide ; 
Though we live at a distance, and you I ne'er see-- 
On the banks of sweet Canaan, acquainted we'll be. 

There all things are plenty, the leaves growing
green, 
And the parting of Christians, no more will be
seen--
No troubles nor trials shall enter that place ; 
But there we shall join in a song of free grace. 

Farewell to all sorrow, temptation and pain ! 
I'm going where Jesus forever doth reign ; 
I'm going to Jesus, 'tis Him I adore--
With saints and bright angels, to dwell evermore ! 

And when we meet Jesus, in the mansions above,
Where angels in glory, are fill'd with His love-- 
O !  then I shall look, for the mourners now here-- 
How glad we shall be, to meet each other there !

See the Christian, in that day, 
Take wings and flay away-- 
Glad to hear the trumpet sounding, in that morning, 
Crying, O Lord !  how I want to go
