MEMORANDUM
FROM ARCHIVE OF AMERICAN FOLK SONG DIVISION
TO THE CHIEF OF THE MUSIC DIVISION
November 21, 1942
To: Dr. Lyman Bryson
From Harold Spivacke
"Recommendation to the Librarian of Congress of [?]
Subject: [Memo from] Alan Lomax's re Study of Czech Folk Culture in the United
States by Mrs. Svatava Pirkov√° Jakobson
The proposed study of ["]Czech["] culture [would make] is an admirable
scholarly project, [and ,which] which would probably set a high standard for similar studies of
the folk culture of minority groups in the United States. Since, however [the] at present
[policy of] the Library of Congress is committed to a policy of [the undertaking of only such]
folk song collecting [expeditions as are] directly connected with the war effort and
since [it is] the war-time implications and applications of Mrs. Jakobson's study are not clear from Mr. Lomax's memorandum
[exactly  how the results
of Mrs. Jakobson's study would be of immediate use to the war effort], I suggest that
[should like a more explicit statement on] the following questions [points] need more careful
analysis and explanation:
1. Apart from the long-term use of the data in the publication
of the complete study mentioned by Mr. Lomax, what specific short-term use
of the data is intended?
2. In what media and by what methods are these data to be directed
into the regular war information channels?
3. How will use of the material serve the immediate minority
problems of the war effort as distinguished from the general minority problems of American
life?
It seems to me that such a study, however excellent in itself,
in order to be of practical value would have to be related to an over-all
program of the Office of War Information for the education of minority groups
in terms of national unity plus cultural diversity.
Such a program is of extreme interest to the Library of
Congress and one to which I believe the Library could contribute effectively.
