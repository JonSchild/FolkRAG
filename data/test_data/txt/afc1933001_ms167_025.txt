Dear Mr. Hudson:

Here are the books you requested on fiddle music.
They'll be good for a starter.

Ryan's Mammoth Collection, 1050 reels and jig tunes.

Tolman, Beth, The Country Dance Party, The Country Press,
Weston, Vt., 1938.

Let me know if I can be of further assistance to you.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
