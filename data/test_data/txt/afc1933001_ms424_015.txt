Onward Brothers, march still onward,
Side by side to carry on.
Though the night be dark and hopeless,
We are coming toward the Dawn.
Women, children, slave about us,
Hard the toil and grim the strife,
But our souls still sing within us,
Dreaming of a better life.


Olden sages saw it dimly
And their joy to rapture wrought
Living men have gazed upon it,
Standing on the hills of thought.
All the past has done and suffered,
All the daring and the strife,
All has helped to mould the future,
Make man master of his life.


Still strong deeds and brave are needed,
Still the toil for freedom's cause,
Let us all join in together,
Fight against the master's laws.
Let us strive for love and justice,
Brotherhood - true Freedom's sun.
Let us never yield or falter
Till the victory is won.
