BJ TAPE 20, p. 50

[bj:] BJ:       Tha's right.  An so that's just. . . he trusted   that's all.
So that's why I say I never wanna git another [?] one.   You know, just
like him in every respect.   Ya see?   Not in that way.   'Cause some
of 'em is so indifferent.   An I git somebody that cain't trust me,
I don' wanna be with 'im.   I, I don't stay nowhere I ain't trusted.
I don't like it.   I jus' don't 'preciate it.   'Cause I wanna trust
you an' I want you to trust me.   Tha's all.   If you cain't trust
me, I know good an' well there ain' no need a me tryin' a trust
you.   Because there's some untrusted in your mind somewhere.   Ya
see?   You figure that you would do it an' ya think I would do it.
That's what I think.   That's, that's the way I feel about it.   So.
I say I never'll git another'n just like George all the way through,
hum-um.   Not never.   No.
TL:       Bessie, when you met George,did you know all these things
about him right off the bat?
BJ:        I didn' know anything about 'im.
TL:       Well, how did you decide you liked him?
BJ:        I don' know.    I jus' come to like him come to like him a lil'.
(?)
TL:       You don't know what it was, exactly, [but] that you liked about him, at
first?
BJ:        I didn't like nothin' about 'im at first.
TL:        You didn't!
BJ:        Um-hum.
TL:        Oh, That's right.   When you saw him on that stoop and you
thought, "Oh, my gosh, what          !
BJ:         Yeah, ha, ha, ha!    Oh, goodness, I didn't like nothin' about him [before] at first.
Period.   Ha, ha, ha!
TL:          Did you find out all those things about him before you
