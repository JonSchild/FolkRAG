the San Juan Mission, located 
several miles out of San Antonio,
part of which has had continuous 
use as a church for more 
than 200 years.  Our singers
are the descendants of Indians 
with some admixture of Spanish
blood.
Will you kindly have 
your Secretary mail me 
a copy of the last report 
of the Library?
Sincerely,
John A. Lomax.
