King Jesus is the solidx rock,
[*2*]
And don't you see
Way up between the heaven and the earth,
Think I heard my saviour says,
And don't you see....

My mother used to sing that all the time, all the time...
Specilly when she was cooking or washing or something...
Thqt was one of her favorite songs.. A home in the rock...

[*Mother says*]

She says that her mother used to sing it... I used to ask
her where it was from and she'd say "I don't know where my
people get it from. My mother used to sing it when we's
little and I still remembers it. I know I don't know it all.
It 's just so old. I just sings what I know because I love it."
She used to sing it all the time and so did I...
That's mean that she's got religion and when she die she's goin
to heaven. SHE REPEATS THE WORDS ) That means that I'm going to
have a home when I die, going to have rest, going to heaven 
when I die...
A: How old were you when you first remember a song?
V: When I start to payin attention to what a song was when somebody
was singing it was around nearly eight years old I
believe because I can't hardly remember my life long in five,
fo and all like that I can't remember anything. Don't remember
nothin what went on--what I heerd the people say--say we used
to play this and used to do this back when we was children--
I'd hear the grown peoples talkin that but I couldn't remember
nothin' back...
A: What did your mama say? What kind of a little baby did she 
say you were?
