mostly to cider - Used to
be I'd eat a whole cow, 
the calf too small for me, but
now cider's enough -

He keeps a bottle by his
chair & one by his bed &
is well sozzled all the time.
But merry as a quig, lively,
unaffraid, full of the
pleasure of life, kissing all
the women - kissed women
in pubs, in cars, sang lovely
bawdy songs always positive
said he'd never [been] had
a moment of fear in his
life - Regretted nothing. Once
find a folk song collection
