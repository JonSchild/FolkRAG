BJ  TAPE  7A,   p.  45

did, ya know?  Co'se I did, too, when I come to learn to pick
it, [Ihad a] them long sack, 'way back [like that] out there.  That's 50-pound
sacks, ya know?  We'd sit an' make those sacks.  An' git this
stuff they call Audenboro,  that's thick cloth.  And sit down at 
nights and make those sacks, on the machines.
TL:     Did you make them...?
BJ:     No, my mother.  My mother an' my aunties an' diffrunt ones,
they'd make those cotton  sacks.  Oh, boy, make  'em good.
See, they double the bottom.  You know, on account a draggin'
on the ground, to keep from gittin' holes in it?  Sometime they
put a piece of ah, ah, some kinda leather on, on the side that
goes to the groun',  to keep frm draggin' holes in it so quick.
Else ya have to patch it, ya see?  An Papa, he had those 75-
pound sacks all the time.  He knew what he got,  ya see?    An' he
picked that.  He done did it so much, so he knew when he, when
he had that, ya see.  Seventy-five.
TL:     Well, does the whole family join in and all pick cotton
together?
BJ:  Yes, ya know when it fer  -- When it time to pick cotton,
[a big ah,] if you got a family, ya know,  ya all picks. Tha's why a lot a
chilren at that day, when I was comin' along, couldn't go to
school,  ya know,  ' cause,  ya see,  the cotton lasts sometime
' till 'way after September.  You see?  
An' ah, an' [these] be
scrappin' it  -- Call scrappin'  cotton.  That's when it ain't
so much in the fiel'.  Ya have to go an' git all that.  Ya
pick the last cotton to make ah mattresses an' pillows an' things.
But they give that to us.  Yeah, they was real nice folks.
