BJ TAPE 3, p. 19

what this word here mean, hit tell you to go over different places an'
you find it. Maybe'way back in Genesis; you might be in Revelation.
You see?  Go right back there.  Those words come together.  Jesus
say, "In the bottom of the book I come."  That mean all the way,
you know.  He, he's just as far back as He was -- as, as He is now.
Goin' ahead, see?  His blood went as far back on the cross as it
is now goin' forward.  What I mean by that, he saved as many back
as was dead before he come in this worl', you see, as, as ah, as
"those that believe in me."
The same thing I was sayin' a while ago, he said.  "An' all
that believe in Him," see.  They wa'n' -- they didn' know; they
jus' believed in 'im, and done all they could.  You know, they
would burn those things, ya know.  Those doves and things, to
see was they right.  But they believed in it, ya see?  And ah,
His blood was jus' as fer back as it is forward.  He saved 'em.
Tha's why they said that the res -- that the first reseurrection --
that many was come out of the grave an' was seen by many.  A
lot of folks say there's no spirit, but it is.  The whole thing's
spirit.  The whole, entire thing is spirit. Ha! Tha's true.

BJ:     Oh, yeah, than the Baptist.  'Co'se, co'se they got sumpin'
to take it with, ya see?  But if you ain' got nothin' to take nothin'
with -- If you ain't got nothin' in a gun, you cannot shoot.
You see?  Ya jus' got a gun, pointin' atcha, ya know.
