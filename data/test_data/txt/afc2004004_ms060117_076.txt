Dear J. D.,

As I gather, the Diego Martin group is the only one that has not 
signed its contract. I think you should tell them that the night
that they recorded they signed a document which gives me all
rights to the tapes they made for me; that is, rights to use the
tapes in any way I so choose. What I am now trying to do is replace
this document with a proper recording contract which will
give them full protection. If they would prefer me to use their
recordings in any way I choose without their receiving any further
royalties or payments, they can signify this by refusing to sign
the contract which we are offering them. This contract, drawn
up by Procope, is a better-than-normal arrangement for amateur
and unknown recording artists in the Caribbean.

The reason that you have not heard from me is that your letters
haven't reached me until lately. I have been in Jamaica preparing
the collection for deposit at the University; however, illness
in my family required me to return here suddenly, and I am
going to complete the work here as I have time for it.

In your bill submitted on the 19th of September, you did not account
for the $50.00 that I gave you earlier in the summer nor cash that
I handed you when you were travelling around getting the contracts
signed. I think these amounts should be deducted. Also, please
tell me how many completed texts and translations you already have.

Your inclusion of all members of the singing groups on the contracts
-- although democratic in the extreme -- is going to cause
an enormous amount of administrative difficulties. I am not
even sure that the University will accept these contracts. I am,
therefore, going to write all the groups concerned and ask them to
elect one person to receive payments and royalties for them. Otherwise,
the arrangements will be too unweildy for the record company,
publishing company of the University to administer. In completing
the agreement with Diego Martin, I hope you will make the same
point. All the other contracts in the file were made by one person
only. Somebody has to trust some person somewhere.

I look forward to receiving the Diego Martin contract as soon as
possible and to paying you for the work you have done. Please
forgive the businesslike tone of this letter. I am in the midst
of paying bills, answering mountains of back correspondence and
getting my very complicated life in New York moving again. The
whole thing is a very big bore. You will be glad to know that the
fellowship I was hoping to get last summer has been awarded and
that, for two years beginning next spring, I will be involved in
getting the coding system developed further. Maybe I can use some
areas in the West Indies as a sort of field station for the project.

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
