Soldier, Won't You Marry Me?   Sung by Russ Pike with guitar,  Visalia,
California, 1941,  Recorded by Charles Todd and Robert Sonkin.

   This satiric dialogue between a sophisticated soldier and a somewhat
naive lady has been universally popular in this country,  as in England,
the country of its origin.  Girl scouts,  isolated mountaineers,  New
England lumberjacks,  college glee clubs - - all sing is with equal
enthusiasm.  The "Okies",  the wandering migratory workers of the Southwest, 
have carried it to the beet-fields and orange groves of southern
California

Jennie Jenkins      Sung by Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Ball with guitar and
mandolin, Rugby, VA.,  1941.  Recorded by Alan and Elizabeth Lomax. 

   Rugby, Va., is not a town or even a village,  but a community of
mountain people,  scattered among the folds of the green hills of 
southwest Virginia.  One sunny afternoon last fall I drove up one of  its
green valleys,  along a narrow road,  looking for the home of the
E. C. Balls.  I dod not have to be told that I had found the right
house,  because there on the front gallery were the two of them,
Mr. Ball with his big guitar in his lap,  singing together.  

   This song,  of English origin,  has been found in many parts of
the United States.  It is a song of courtship.  Often at rural 
entertainments of earlier days a pair of lovers would sing it together
with many blushes,  much to the amusement and delight of their
auditors.
