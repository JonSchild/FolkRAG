"The warehouses, I understand, are bursting with
sugar.  After the fruit is all done, and we aren't able to can it,   8-3-42  70
they will let us have all the sugar we want, when it's too late.
There's no use wasting sugar on canning now, as if you don't use
enough sugar, the fruit will spoil.  We'll have to pay high prices
for canned fruits this winter, and I don't think it's necessary."
