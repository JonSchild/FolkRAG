   There was an old couple
once who lived out in the
country.  They didn't possess
a radio therefore they had to go
to town in order to secure news.
   One day the farmer went to
town.  He stood around with
the crowd.  All he could hear
was "Pearl Harbor".  So
when he returned home, his
wife asked him for the news.
He said, "all they are talking
about is some bitch named
Pearl Harbor".
