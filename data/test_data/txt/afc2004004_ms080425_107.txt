Woodward
Roll 236.
    I'm Martha Woodward from G            Alabama. I want to tell you a little
bit about my life, where I was brought up, where I was born. I was born in
C             County Alabama. I was one of eight children, and we had a pretty 
hard time. We had to chop cotton, we had to pick cotton, and I'd do a little
bit of plowin' too. My father died when I was seven, so we had a pretty hard
time. We didn't go hungry because we raised our food, but we didn't have any
clothes. Then when I was about 20 I married George, George Woodward. And
we had a good life. We started off . . .                                               company
about five or six years ago. And George and I had a pretty good life. We
used to go to the new-book singin'. That's what the Sacred Harp people
call the new-book singin', seven-shape notes instead of four-shape. And
one day we decided, we'd heard about Sacred Harp singin', and we decided
we'd go to a sing. We didn't they even had it anymore. And we decided to
go, and we fell in love with it. I love that note-singin', that fa-sol-la.
It wouldn't be singin' to me if we didn't sing the notes. And another thing
I like about it--we've made so many new friends. We've made just lots of
new friends and not one of these friends that we've made did I know before I
started goin' to Sacred Harp. And I love it, I don't want to ever quit. I
don't think we'll ever get too old to quit.
     When did you start playing that on the banjo?
    Oh, I started playin' the banjo after I retired, I was past 62, I'll
tell you. And I never had any lessons, I learned it myself, from a book,
I didn't have a very good book. And I played not like anybody else 'cause
I don't think anybody plays as well as I do, and I have my own style,
but I love it. And I also have a guitar and a dulcimer. And I do the
banjo on the sound(?). . .               recorder, and then I go through and record
