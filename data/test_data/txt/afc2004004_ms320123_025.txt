The one who got turned down would go and tackle the other
man.
CANRAY
Uh-huh.  I remember in Lake Charles there, they had two guys
that they almost killed their selves.  One guy went and he
invited a girl there and she said she didn't want to dance.
So he left and he went and invited another lady and they
started dancing.  And she got up and started dancing with
somebody else.  I wasn't at the dance, but I knew both of
them guys.  And she started dancing with another guy there
and he saw that-he went there and told her:  "You go sit
down".  She said "No.  I'm not going."  He started slappin'
her.  Her brother came in there and opened a big knife and
they started cutting one another.  "You ainn't gonna slap my
sister!"  They cut one another until they both fell.  Two
weeks they was tryin' to kill one another.  Just for that.
Oh yeah, they was terrible about that.  And then (laughs),
when I was comin' up, nobody never could find out who would
do them things, but you would do them kind of things.  When
I was young, some of them young guys they used to go and act
stupid, you know, they was actin' so stupid-this fellow that
was actin' stupid, they would take a handkerchief and a 
safety the pin and tie it to his back (laughs), then he
would go and start dancin' (unintelligible), and everybody
would laugh at him and he wouldn't know what they was
laughin' about.  When they would point it out, they would
want to know who done that, nobody would tell him.  So
whenever they says "They had a handkerchief pinned on me".
Well, them old people would tell 'em right away "Well,
that's because you was actin' stupid, you know"

(whispering to camera) He's looking at right at you all the
time so move as close. . . (to Canray) You were starting to
tell us about Mardi Gras.
CANRAY
Oh yeah, uh huh.  The Mardi Gras. . .
A. LOMAX
The Black Mardi Gras, how did they run the Black Mardi Gras?
CANRAY
Oh, they used to run it on the horseback.  Oh yeah, it was
always on the horseback.  And like the musician, they
didn't have too many musicians.  They always had, sometimes
an accordion player [?]
