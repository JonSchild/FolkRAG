Employment in war effort industries:

It is rumored in this city that confusion is being caused by a type of employment broker. The employment broker operating as an individual persuades employees in the factories manufacturing firebrick to leave their jobs. This, is of course, is a war effort industry. The broker profits by a fee, and promises a better job to the employee.  [*50*]
