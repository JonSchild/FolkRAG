Reel of 10/12/61. Side 1, Song 1
[*31*]

I COULDN'T HEAR NOBODY PRAY
A spiritual

CHORUS:
I couldn't hear nobody pray,
I couldn't hear nobody pray,
'Way down yonder by myself,
I couldn't hear nobody pray.

REFRAIN
In the valley,
I couldn't hear nobody pray.
By myself, Lord,  (REFRAIN)
On my knees, Lord,  (REFRAIN)
Calling Jesus,  (REFRAIN)

(CHORUS)

In the morning,  (REFRAIN)
On my knees,  (REFRAIN)
In the evening,  (REFRAIN)
On my knees,  (REFRAIN)          

(CHORUS)

All alone,   (REFRAIN)
[*?*] Mo' I groaned,   (REFRAIN)
All alone,  (REFRAIN)
[*?*] Mo' I cried,  (REFRAIN)           

(CHORUS)

In the valley,  (REFRAIN)
On my knees,   (REFRAIN)
'Round myself,   (REFRAIN)
Calling Jesus,   (REFRAIN)          
(CHORUS)

(REPEAT CHORUS TWICE MORE)

No, Lord,   (REFRAIN)
Oh, Lord,   (REFRAIN)
On my knees,   (REFRAIN)
Calling Jesus,   (REFRAIN)
Oh, Lord,                           

(CHORUS)
