                               JOHN STEALS HOGS.

Old master had a miller named John, so [and] he had a lot for [lots of] the hogs.  Old master said, I been
missing hogs every night.  The last one I seen in the hog
lot was John.  said, "John, I believe you're stealing my hogs."  "O h, no," says,
"Oh, no, "Says, "Massa, I ain't been stealin your hogs." Well, that Sat
night, John 'cided to slip off and take him a little shoat. So the first shoat
he grabbed, old Massa Higgins had him, caught him at the gate bringing the
shoat out.  So Old Massa told him, "well, John, I'm gonna make 
you eat up every damn bit of this hog you been stealing all this time, so, you can't eat up all of this. So Old Massa made old John go to the house and so he went
to the house and he told his cook to cook him a pan of corn bread.
So his cook cooked the pan o corn bread." And he put the hog
in one of these old pots that you cook in--a washpot. Stewed him down.
The first thing Old John grabbed was his head and he shook, shook the  [???] of his head et the head up, he took the middlings and he fold em just like you do like a falpjack and he took then there ham and he knocked the gristles
off and the end of them and he turned and say, "Captain, if you'd give
me any more'n this n it would have killed me."
