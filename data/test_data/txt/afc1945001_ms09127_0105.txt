MINET, LOUIS     A
Rummor
It has been rummored that Hitler is not 
feeling well, and that he is under a 
doctors care, and has made very few public apperances.

"Grey Hair at 33"
Chicago hailed a fighting hero, both of 
the ring and the battle front, whose 
hair turned grey over night, as he 
fought off the Japs on Guadalcanal, 
protecting some of his wounded bodies.

"They'll never bomb this place"
The Nazie didn't think it could be 
done, but the war birds of England & 
United States proved it different, as they 
poured tons of bombs into the heart 
of Berlin.

"Someones Rockin My Dream Boat"
Thats what Hitler is singing now 
as his forces are setting new track records 
on the Tunisa & the Russian fronts.

"Jap Ju-Jistu Dosn't Work So Good"
Stories have come back from the front 
saying that, the Jap's trickyness is of no 
atvantage, and when it comes to hand 
to hand combat, the Americans usually 
win, and Ju-Jitsu dosn't help the Jap much.
