1664 A. cont'd
Louis failed and he finally got a job at a  
place in New York called The Nest, ran by John
[Carey] {&] he wrote this number as a kind of 
theme. [&] and named it.  No, Luis Russell is not a
sissy.  He wrote this number [&] called it 
"The Call of the Freaks," finding that there
was many [?] in the city of New York,
that were so low they would do any-
thing for a dollar [&] a half.  [Laughter]
When he start to playinâ€™ this thing, why
those -- they'd start walking.  They all
became to know the tune -- they'd throw
their hands way up high in the air and 
keep astride to the music, and walkin' --
and of course they used to have a little verse
in there that goes like this -
"Stick out your can
Here come the garbage man."

Those freaks would be marching, I'm telling
you.  They'd sticks themselves out in the rear.
