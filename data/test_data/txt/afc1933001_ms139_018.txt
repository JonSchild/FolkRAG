Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thank you so much for your note of November 17th,
enclosing the receipt. This has come in while Mr. Greene
is away on a short trip, but he will see it as soon as he
returns in a day or two.

In the meantime, however, I am sure you will be interested
to know that the first of the series of six programs of Negro
music which Mr. Greene is compiling here, has now been definitely
scheduled to be broadcast on Christmas Day, and we shall
send on to you the reports on it as soon as we
hear anything here. In view of all the valuable material
which you so kindly made available to us, however, we feel
sure these programs are bound to be a success.

As soon as Mr. Greene completes the work he has been
doing on these programs, we will return your master copies
of records to the Library of Congress. This should be by
the end of this month at the latest.

Yours sincerely,
Annette Ebsen
Secretary
