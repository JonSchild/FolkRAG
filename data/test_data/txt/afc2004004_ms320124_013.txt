     LOMAX       Well now when you went to [La
Rochelle what did you, what, what did you, back to France,
what did you see?  What were your big experiences?
     ANCELET       Well I was in la, I was in La
Rochelle for a, for a festival there that was designed to,
to highlight the two Arcadias and the connection with La
Rochelle.  Of course, La Rochelle was where the folks in
France sailed out of to go to the new world.  And when we
were, when, while we were in La Rochelle we went to the
countryside.  And La Rochelle it was, it was an urban
center.  It was very difficult to pick up anything.  But in
the countryside, outside I, I once again saw people's faces
that looked familiar.  You know, familiar facial type
features.  The language was just about exactly the same
between [LeDunne, [UNCLEAR] and up around the, the central
western coast and, and going inland, it was just remarkable
how close the language was, people talking like my
grandmother.

[Platue], isn't it?
