"I hear Pravda has broadcast to the Axis that by the
end of the year they'll be faced by 15,000,000 men, 80,000 airplanes, 
26,000 tanks, and I believe it's right. Roosevelt asked for 60,000
airplanes this year and he's getting them. Our main trouble is shipping.
No idea as to when the "Second Front" is to be opened."   [*8-4*]
