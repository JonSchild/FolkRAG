Kilts an pan-loafs on the flaer,
Lairds an lawyers roun the chair;
--Barely wis a hunner there,
    That wadna bend the knee-o.

Heid-yins blaw an heid-yins greit:
"Canny, noo!  Lat's be discreet!
We maun neither meet nor treat
        Wi Johnnie Destinie-o."

But Hugh MacDiarmid's taen the dais,
An the glower is on his face.
He's no up to gie the grace
          Or sing a melodie-o.

London parrots, flee awa!
Flee awa ye Yankee craws!
Wheesht your blether!  Wheest your blaw!
         Lat's hear Destinie-o.

Johnny's lowpt on ti the boards.
Man, ye'd sweir a thoosan swords
Had ripped awa the wab o words
           --An brocht in claritie-o.

"Gif there's sax or sevin here
Wull redd us o these....auctioneers!
Ah'm your leader.  Ah'm your fiere."
       Says Johnnie Destinie-o.


Tummle bench an tummle seat!
Fowr score Scotsmen on their feet,
Whunstane faces, een like sleet:
       "We will follow ye-o!"

Johnny's raised the Fierie Cross:
Thurso Toun to Solway Moss,
Berwick Law to Wester Ross
       Is aa for Destinie-o.

Scotland rises to a man
Ilka tounsman, ilka clan:
"Damn your Eisenhower Plan!
        Damn your militrie-o!

"No a single Jock is gae'n
To fecht a fecht that's no orr ain!
