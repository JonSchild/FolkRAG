Dear Father,

I'm so far behind in my correspondence that I hesitate to write at all.  But my mail has not kept up with me during the last couple of weeks.

I left Harold promising to get you and Miss Tart started right away, and I have just written him again to urge him all speed.  I'll be back in Washington on the 10th, and see that it is done then, at the very latest.

Elizabeth and I just spent a very exciting week in Coahoma County, Mississippi, which has the highest ratio of Negro population of any county in America.  I'm extremely please so far with the collaboration with the Fisk people.  It seems to me that we establish very close contact with the Negro community on very short notice, working with these people.  Whenever we ask about work songs, they say, "Why don't you go to parchment?"

I'll send the clipping to my new secretary in Washington to have it photostated, and have her return it to you.

Sorry to hear about your thumb, but keep writing me.  Much love to you and Deanie.

Sincerely,

Alan
