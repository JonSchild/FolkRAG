Wicklow & Kerry by Synge
People want to stay in the madhouse 
because its so much pleasanter than
their lives-

Lonely old man - all I know to
make is tea, and tea is destroying 
me. 
- Didn't I hear you, and you etc.
- after doing something
- the poorest, lone most, wildest dreariest
- he never owned it
- I have a noise in me head, you wouldn't
hear a noise by side of it -
- wishing black hell would siege
