BJ TAPE 7A, p. 123

one night.  They don't tell me their business; I don't ask 'em
their business; I don't try to know.  That's they business.  Say
him an' her got in an argument one night.  So she said she 'cided
she jus' act big an' grown.  An' so she, she cursed 'im.  Um-um.
And Mattie says, says she was sittin' on side a the bed, ah,
sittin' on side a the bed in a chair.  She was, she's a great, a
good seamstress.  An' Mattie said when she knowed anything, she was 
in the bed.  You see?  Just, just, just that quick.  He just turned
around and said unto her; jus' picked 'er up, an' so. . .He wouldn'
hurt 'er, but she was knowin' that she's in the bed, but she's
comin' in the bed; that's what she said.  So he picked 'er up an'
brought her this way then throwed her down in the middle of the
bed!  Ha, ha, throwed her right down in the middle of the bed!
An' walked to the door.  Said, "Now, don't cuss me no more, 'cause
I might hurtcha."  Ha, ha, so from that day to this day they
had no mo' trouble!  Scared her to death!  Heh, heh, heh, heh!  Ain't
never. . .An' he was goin' by the chair.  She 'cided she'd do
sumpin' big.  She said if she'd a-got away with that, ya know,
no, no doubt she'd a-went on further!  An' she know -- she don't
know how he picked her up outa that chair!  An' she go on an'
firs' she know she was comin' down to the bed, Heh, heh, heh!
You know.  An' didn't touch 'er.  Jus' walked on there, [see, see,] when he, when he,
he jus' walked on out, went out the do'.  Said, "Don't cuss me
no mo' 'cause I'm liable to hurtcha."  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That was
so funny.
     An' so Mattie said to him, said, "Tha's enough.  I, I,
know I do it no mo',"  she said.  So that's the way it is; just
quit it.  Tha's all, jus' quit it an', an' go on.  Yes sir, just
that way.  They all get along nice now.  Jes'. . .I'm glad for 'em.
