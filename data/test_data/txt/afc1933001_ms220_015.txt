loaned to your man (I forget this name)
in New York?  And tell me
what he proposes to do about
the album?  I have no contact
except his letters.

7.  I have had no letter from
Mr. Wetherald since his scimpy
offer sent to me inQuebec.
The R. C. A. keep asking me for
information about songs as
if I were a regular employee.
Soon I plan to send them
a plain, unvarnished, complete
summary of my opinion of
their arrogant presumption.

8.  You'd better sit down soon
and decide whether you would
really enjoy spending a year or so
in a University - no camouflage
this time.  Lovingly,
Father
