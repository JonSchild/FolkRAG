July 13, 1942.

Mr. Keith Kane
Intelligence Division
Office of Facts and Figures
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Kane:

Enclosed is a list of the rumors
which were reported to this division by our
new organization of Morale Wardens -- volunteer
workers whose duty it is to note trends
in public opinion and report rumors.

It is interesting to note that peace
rumors have fallen off over the month of May,
while anti-semetic and anti-British rumors are
notably on the increase. This is no doubt a
reflection of the darkened military outlook
since the month of May.

This list of rumors is not to be
released to the public or incorporated in
radio programs, etc. without the permission 
of this office.

Yours very truly,

Robert H. Knapp.

Robert H. Knapp, Chairman
Division of Propaganda Research
