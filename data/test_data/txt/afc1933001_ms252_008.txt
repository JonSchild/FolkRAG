for any specific suggestions about how
I can help. I am not writing
to her as I once did because
she [she] seems to find letter writing
a burden and I do not
wish her to feel that it is
her duty to reply to my letters.
Then, too, I begin to hurt [when] at
her long silences; so I selfishly
try to remove the possibility
of feeling slighted and
I do wish her to feel free,
believe it or not. This is not
a confidential letter.

From Mike's garden (in
back), financed by me, you can
pluck this morning
1. Irish potatoes - plentiful
2. Turnips - in abundance
3. Snap beans - bushels. Miss T. is canning
them.
