therefore, robs her of the full half
of her vacation and on top
of that brings disappointment to 
Johnny and Miss Terrill and 
Shirley. I beg of you to 
make us all happy, including 
Bess, by shifting dates
or programs or something.

Now, if you are calling 
me unreasonable or stupid 
or selfish or dictatorial, please
be fair enough, at the same 
time, to recall that i gave up 
Bess to you in my feeling for 
your loneliness last Christmas,
when, as a matter of fact, I 
very much needed her.

To the last I'll hope that
you'll drop in sometime during 
Christmas, Lovingly, 
Father.
