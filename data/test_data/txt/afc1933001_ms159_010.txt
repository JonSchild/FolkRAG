Dear Mr. Lomax:
Mr. Wetherald asked me, in his absence, to see that the
correspondence with Miss Lockerby, which you were sending,
was turned over promptly to our Accouting Department, and
to notify you at once what was being done.
The letters arrived early yesterday afternoon and were immediately
acted upon. Our Accounting Department advises
me that they wrote to Miss Lockerby, apologizing for the
trouble she had been caused, and asked that she at once
send the check in question to us via registered mail (the
registry receipt would be her proof of having had the check).
Immediately upon its arrival here, another check, properly
authorized and executed, would be dispatched to her. Her
reply is now being awaited, and action will be taken as 
promised.
It is certainly regrettable that you should have been subjected
to this embarrassment and annoyance. Please accept
our apologies.
Sincerely yours,
Helen M. Metcalfe
