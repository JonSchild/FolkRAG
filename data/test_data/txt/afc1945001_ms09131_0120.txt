1. There was a fight between the German & Americans 
on some island, I believe, and the Americans were retreating. 
One of the had fallen just about 200 yds. from the enemy, & 
an American soldier stopped retreating, saw that his leg had to 
be amputation, & did this regardless of the fact that the 
Germans were almost upon them. The Germans were so 
impressed that they held fire until the Americans finished 
the amputation & carried the other soldier out of sight. 
2. "Slap the Jap."
3. The mother of a baby on Guadacanal told me that 
the Japanese prisoners weren't such bad fellows. A lot of 
them know English, so they have some good conversations.
