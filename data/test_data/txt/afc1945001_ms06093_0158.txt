I've heard that a building in the Camp McCoy area, not on any highway or side
track requiring specific placement of the building, was found, after construction,
to be twofeet from the place it was to have been set. An army inspector
came around, and finding the building out of line, ordered bulldozers
into action, and, the building was pushed over so as to destroy it. The
wreckage was burned, and a new building started on the proper site. No
effort was made to move the building. -- Milwaukee, August 7  [*23*]
