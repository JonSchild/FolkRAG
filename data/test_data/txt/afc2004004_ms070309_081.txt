"Universality is the rule and
the problem of the comparative folklorist,
once the material is collected,
is to examine the variations of the
material and determine the reasons
for the variations." -

The reasons for variation of a
particular unit of folk lore lie in the
effect of varying historic-cultural complexes
in the unit of lore, presumably.  In
order to determine the reasons for variation
one has to understand the inter-relations
of the unit of lore with this historic-cultural 
complex.  The determination
of this interrelationship is not feasible,
in large measure, for the folk-lore
materials current in the past.  [It] This
may, however, be possible for living
folk-cultures, convenient to our
study.  Once we have determined,
so far as possible, the reasons for
the preservation, decay or growth
of particular units or complexes
