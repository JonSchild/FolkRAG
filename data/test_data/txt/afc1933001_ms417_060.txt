SARA OGAN'S
I HATE THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM

I hate the rich man's set up.  I hate the rich man's frame up.
I hate the rich mans way of looking at things.  I hate the greed
of the rich guys.  I hate the murder and the war and the killing
[of the multi-millionaires.] they hire cops to do.

But what the hell's a feller a gonna do about it?  I'm sure you
hate it, too.  You hate it as a Christian.  And you hate it as a
working man, or a working woman.  And you always have known it was
all mixed up and all haywired, but you didn't know what the hell to
do about it.

This next song tells you what to do about it.  Tells you why
to hate the Rich Man's Rule, and the Rich Man's Whip, and the Rich
Man's Chain around your leg.

If you are in debt, or if you are broke all the time, or if you
are past forty five, and caint see which a way to turn, or if you
are young and ambitious and full of piss and vinegar, and would
like to be out a showing your good gal a real good time, but aint
got the money . . . . . then you hate all of that, and you hate the
damned old rich folks that has got all of your money wadded under
their pillows, and in their banks.  Why caint you enjoy life?  You
caint enjoy life, because in these days, money is king, money is
power, money is anything, money brings you everything, and you aint
got none . . . . . so you hate something, but you dont know what it is,
or what to do about it.

Sara knows what she hates and she knows what to do about it.
