September 9, 1942.
Rumor picked up by Mrs. Galvin - dictated by Mr. Huse:
A group of neighborhood children were gathered in
Chevy Chase and the son of a local air raid warden stated that
his father had told him that he, the warden, had been notified
officially by the Air Raid Precaution System to which he
belongs (either Montgomery County or D.C.) that he should be
prepared to watch out for violence by Negroes the next time
there is a blackout. He also mentioned in this connection
the rumor that the Negroes have bought up all the ice picks
in the local hardware stores.
