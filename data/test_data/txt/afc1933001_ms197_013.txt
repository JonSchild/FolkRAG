Dear Alan:
   I just received your letter of January 11, and 
I am answering hastily because any delay would be unfair
to you. At the moment we do not have one dollar in our
budget for recording folk music or for most other types 
of acquisitions for that matter. The Library took a cut
this year in its appropriations for the increase of its
collections, and most of the money is going for current
strategic materials. You may rest assured that I shall
remember this kind offer of yours, and if I see any
change of getting funds for folk songs, I shall communicate
with you again.

Regards,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Music Division
