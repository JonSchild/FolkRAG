BJ TAPE 20, p. 58

BJ: That's his mind, ya see. Ya see. An' a woman, she has so many. Ya see?
TL: Like what?
BJ: She jus' got so many. A woman think twice while a man thinkin'
once. At all times. See. At all times, ya see. She thinkin'
twice while he thinkin' once. An' there's sumpthin' about that.
Ya see. Because she's a 'cumulator. That's one thing. See. An'
ah, and a man is not a 'cumulator. He's on'y a seed. He's jus'
a bean. Ya see. An', see, that's all he is. He haven't any-
anything else. A woman did-didn't come from dirt, you know. I 
guess you know. A woman didn't come from dirt, ya see? She come from
flesh. Ya see? An', an' that's why it says she's soft, [ya see] she's...
an' everything of that type? But in that flesh was a bone, you
see. An' [in, an'] in that bone was, was marra (marrow). You see.
An' she's a livin' bein'. You know what I'm talkin' about. As,
as I say, I wanna be liked (?), regardless of what ya
do. If she go out there in the street nekked, she's a livin'
bein', because, first thing, peoples'll say, "You see that naked
woman?" You see? See, she's carried about. Man'll go out there
an' tomorra it's, hit's over, it's forgotten. An' if you live
good, [while, you,] why, it's, you, you still livin'. An' it's -- they talk
about that years ta come. If you live bad, they talk about that
years to come. The man, they hardly, they, they, it passes away.
You know? Early. They may speak a his, how he used ta could
sing or how he used could play, to do, but a whole lot a his being today,
they don't mention. If he done real bad, if he got drunk a time
or two, if he got in jail a time or two, they ain't sayin' (nothing )
about it. But a woman, why that ol' woman, she's danger! She did
this; she did the other! See? She's a 'cumulator. See?
