What did you mean by that, Reverend Davis?)  Well, as long
as I am here, in this present world, here, we'll have a
lot of things come about to cause us to shed tears.  You
understand . . . You ain't gon laugh all the time.  You ain't
gon be on the mountain all the time.  You gon have yo hand
on yo face sometime, crying bout it.  You got to do everything 
a little, you understand, until the time come for you 
to make your departure from here.
