Dear Alan: I am sending you herewith some information
about several people who have applied 
to us in recent years for projects involving recording 
techniques. There are fewer of them than I thought
when I talked with you in Washington, since I find that 
we do not keep records beyond two years of unsuccessful
applicants for fellowships. I do not know whether any 
of these will suit your purposes, but you are welcome to 
use their material, which I hope you will return when 
you have finished, since these are the only copies we
have in file.
The Fund has not gone into the field of 
foreign minority work in this country, and I do not 
think it would be of any use to include this sort of 
thing in your general application.
I, likewise, enjoyed meeting you in the 
flesh after our indirect contacts, and I look forward 
to seeing you when I am next in Washington.
Sincerely yours,
WCH:MLU  Billy Haygood
