12B      Boy      Negro

1.  I heard that boys who work on
    farms will not be drafted as
    soon as boys who don't live on
    farms.
2.  Knock the pants off the
    Japs with War Bonds
3.  The difference between a Jap &
    a Germany is that a Jap
    has a yellow streak down his
    back which is customary of all
    skunks & a German has a
    white streak down his back
4.  The use of your tongue might
    sink a ship.
5.  Dont make unimportant long
    distance calls unless it
    is necessary because it
    might delay an important
    war call to Washington or someplace
