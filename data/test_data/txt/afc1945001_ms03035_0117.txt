Rumor:   While talking to several men at a public gathering in Rochester, Mich.,  
                an official of the Ford Tank Plant stated they could get out twice as 
                many tanks if the Government inspectors and personnel men knew what they 
                were supposed to do and would cooperate with the factory officials. He 
                stated that most of the ordnance men were smart, cocky Jewish fellows who 
                got the jobs thru a pull merely to keep them from being drafted and they
                continually show their authority by holding up orders and O.K.'s on detail 
                technicalities which could be speeded up by a little more cooperation 
                between the two rather than turning them down or sending them back thru 
                the line just to show that they were Government men with this authority. 
                This causing very poor morale between the men who actually make the tanks  
                and are more than willing to do their share in producing same.
