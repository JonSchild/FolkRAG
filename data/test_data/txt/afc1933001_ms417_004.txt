-2-  One Big Union

Allof this didn't soak in on me right off the bat.  I kissed
the good wife and kid 'goodbye' and pitched out down the road to
California.  I didn't even know where California was.  I didn't
even know what California was.  I'd seen the pretty pictures, and
heard the pretty songs about it, and heard every body was headed
that a way, and I says to myself, dam my hide, if I want to see
any body I recognize at first glance, I'll have to go to California.
So I went.

I left Gray County in a cloud of dust mixed with a west Texas
Northerner...in the month of March 1938, and I got to Lubbock
and I froze up....froze both legs by the side of the road a trying
to catch a ride.  Couldn't walk.  Just drug myself off down
the road like a dog [that had been hit with 3 flying machines and
two caterpillar tractors.]

But I thought more right then, and clearer, and faster, than
I ever thought before, and I says to myself, "Somethings dam shore
out of kelter with this old world, I dont know just what.  But
I'm a freezing my tail off alongside this road, and every five minutes
a big car rolls past --- a big fast traveler, a high roller,
and an easy rider, with just one passenger, and a high hat driver.
And -- I know dam well if I was a drivin' down that road, and it
was a blizzard on, and I looked out at the side of the road and
seen a po' boy all hunkered up and froze up stiffer than Abe
Lincoln's Statue, I'd throw on them dam brakes, and torow open my
door, and say, Hey boy, get yourself in this car, what the hell
are you trying to do, commit sideways?"

But the cars didn't stop.  The dam things just buzzed right on
down the highway, 60, 65, 70 miles an hour, with plenty of room in
the back seat for somebody.  I hoped that somebody would be me.
