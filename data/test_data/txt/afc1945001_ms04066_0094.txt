August 4 - The next comment came out in a casual conversation with another 
Omaha man who has been a Federal employee for many years........is intensely 
patriotic and a fine gentleman: "I can't agree with the consideration extended 
those saboteurs under our laws. I have heard lots of people say the same thing....
.... they have no business to be given the rights of our laws. They should have 
been shot immediately, regardless of enemy retaliation, and nothing said about it. 
Until we come to deal with those devils as such instead of human beings, the better 
off we will be." [*13*]
