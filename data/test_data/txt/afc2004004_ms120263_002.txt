30 Gansevoort St
New York City,
15 May 1935.

Dear Lomaxi,
It is a great pity that we 
three together didn't see Zora
Hurston. I finally found her and
is she delightful! I have asked
her to come on this trip this
summer, if that suits you also
— thus putting off Kentucky until
Xmas. It seemed such a good
opportunity for us to have a
negress — trained anthropologically,
artistic by nature and as hoppity-
skippity-crazy-mad as we are
about folk song and folk dance.
She suggests that we spend some
time in the islands off Savannah
(She says this place is crammed
with negro song and lore — [The
Golden Coast of Suale that I was
looking for last summer]
