Mr. Alan Lomax
  121 West 3rd Street
              New York 12, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
     I am very sorry that your recent trip to the South did not
permit you time to work in Georgia; however, since you plan to return 
South sometime soon and had requested information on what you
might possibly find concerning the recording of negro railroad songs,
I would like to offer whatever help that I can.

     When the A.A.R. originally asked me to check to see
whether or not we had old maintenance gangs, etc., which might provide 
the kind of music you want to record, I found out from some of
our division engineers that there are several old darkies still around
who might provide just the thing you are looking for. The supply is
not great, understand, but there are a few who might be worth your
time.

     If I can be of any help on your subsequent trip, please call
on me.
                                           Sincerely yours,
                                        Ronald L. Coleman
                                                            Editor
