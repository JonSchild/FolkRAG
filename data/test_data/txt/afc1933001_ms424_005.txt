(Page 161 - Old Favorite Songs)



My country 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing;
Land where my fathers died!
Land of the pilgrims' pride!
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring!


My native country thee,
Land of the noble free,
Thy name I love:
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills;
My heart with rapture thrills
Like that above.


Let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song:
Let mortal tongues awake;
Let all that breathe partake,
Let rocks their silence break
The sound prolong. 


Our fathers' God to thee,
Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing;
Long may our land be bright
With freedom's holy light;
Protect us by thy might 
Great God, our King!
