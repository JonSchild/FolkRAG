Some of them more. Just depends on the experience. Well,
they get that and then the better food. All the food we got
was brose and tatties and you know what I mean. Brose and 
tatties and the like of that stuff. Well, they wouldna take 
that now.
     Oh, yes. I'd rather have brose than porridge.
     Well, it was the place where the servants lived. That
was where you had your bed. . . . . No, no, no. . . . . . The women. . .
(He laughs) . . . . . The bothy was the place for the farm
servants, you see. - such as the like of me. . . . . But oh, no,
no, no. The women slept in the house. The farmhouse, you
see. . . . . . . . . . . . Oh, well, yes. Occasionally you know, in
the dark evenings. You just slipped across, or maybe the
boys slipped across to them if the boss and the missus was
away from home.
SONG
Ae nicht an' I went to Glasgow to spend my penny fee
When a servant girl gave me consent to bear her company.
I said I was a stranger and did not Glasgow know
But she said there was no danger if along with her I'd go.
I quickly went into her room. We were marching down the street.
I never dreaded any harm though hundreds we did meet.
Some of them was passing by. I heard them whisper - say -
Ae Jocky Hawk has his little Moll, but he will rue that play
It's down Jamaica Street we went, straight down to Broomielaw
Where the organ chiels played up right weel and fiddlers ane or twa.
I asked them to take a glass round and they took it all right free
And ilka ane drunk great success to my little missie and me.
The ball went on wi' marse and clay till it was getting clear
There was a cry come from the door "All hands on deck appear"
The landlord he did pounce on me till grey broke on dispatch
Seeing, Jock, you ha's no money, you maun gi'e up your watch.
My watch and money they be all gone, my speoghan and my knife
And it's a wunner that they didna charge my very spunk o' life.
