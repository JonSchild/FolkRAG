Dear Neal,
First, thanks for sending and making the mouthbows.
Shirley tells me she has written explaining why I didn't
write, because of the fire. And you can understand how
upset my life has become because of this. But please excuse
me for not writing to thank you.
About the contracts I sent you. As I wrote in my letter
to you, if you felt uneasy about the copyright business, all
you have to do is strike out those paragraphs that deal with
the copyright, etc. Perhaps Jimmy could advise you best on
this. But we do need to have the contracts returned, and so that
we can pay you for the songs we are using on the first set 
of records. So will you send the contracts off right away
please?
All the best,
Alan Lomax.
