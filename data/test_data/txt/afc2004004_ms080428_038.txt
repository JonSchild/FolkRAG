this absolutely delicious because it is 
very close to the conditions that they grew 
up under, Ray and Stanley and the singer 
Frank. You will see that in the scene.

There was a halcyon period at the beginning 
of mountain settlement and the rivers were 
clear and the lands were fertile and there 
was a big market for their hogs and they 
were turning the corn that they made into 
wondrous whiskey, that there was an endless
market for it as well on the frontier and 
on the highways that fed the growing 
frontier so at the beginnings the mountains 
prospered and then as time went on various 
kinds of economic interests moved in and 
the timber began to be cut away and the 
best lands began to be grabbed and coal 
companies came and monopolised all the 
mineral rights and the miners were turned 
into underground slave heroes as we will 
hear in another part of the broadcast.

Gradually the edge was taken off the 
prosperity and the land grabs by big 
interests were terrible and so soon the 
whole area was turned into wage slaves. [*Intro to Ray Hicks story on wages*] We 
have Ray Hicks (and we should have him here) 
telling the story about how he worked for 
$1 a day and his father for 50 cents a day and 
his grandfather for 25 cents a day and 
his father for a nickel a day.   There is 
that long and bitter history and they had 
to walk, if they were going to be married,
