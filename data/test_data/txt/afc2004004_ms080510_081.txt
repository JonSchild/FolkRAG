A:  This is a ballad about adultery, about ah, a courtier betraying his lord's ah lady, and bedding her, and about the little foot page that runs to warn him.  And ah... Old Nimrod ah dramatises it, the whole story, with his action, a very rare thing with ballad singers anywhere.  I suspect it's a gypsy trait, because we have things like it among the gypsy singers of Scotland.

Q:  Is there a particular reason why the Scots-Irish should have chosen passionate - ballads about passionate love?

A:  Well I think there's a reason for the American Scots-Irish choice of ballads of, of passionate love where the lovers come to no good end, because ah, ah, sexual ah... because ah extra marital sex was really a sin in the Calvinist tradition, a terrible sin, and ah it was preached against, you could be [ONE] for it, very much condemned, and the - there was a real uptight morality in this whole Presbyterian tradition.  So, ah, men and women could sing about it, just so long as ah, as the protagonist came to a bad end.
