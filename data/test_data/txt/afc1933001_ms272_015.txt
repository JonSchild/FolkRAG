Flying Trapeze
Oh once I was happy but now I'm forlorn
Lide an old coat that is tatter'd and torn
Left on this wide world to fret and to mourn
Betray'd by a maid in her teens
This maid that I loved she was handsome
I tried all I knew, her to please
But I never could please her one quarter so well
As the man on the flying trapeze.

Chorus:
Oh, he floats through the air with the
greatest of ease
This daring you man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful,
All girls he could please
And my love he puloin'd away Chorus:

This man by name was Segnor Von Slum,
Tall, big and handsome as well made as Chum,
When e'er he appeared, the halls loudly rang
With cheers from the people there,
He looked from the bar on the people below
And then he looked at my love,
She smiled back at him and shouted bravo
As he hung by his ear from above. Chorus:

I once went to see if my love was at home
I found there her father and her mother alone,
When I asked for my duck they soon made it known
Thattshe had bolted away;
She packed up her box and eloped that night
with him with the greatest of ease,
He lowered her down from a two pair back
To the ground with his flying trapeze. Chorus;

One night I went out to a popular hall
Was greatly surprised to see on the wall
A bill in large letters which did my heart pall
To see that she was playing with him,
He taught her gymnastics and dressed her in tights
To swing with the greatest of ease,
He made her assume a masculine name
And now she floats on the trapeze. Chorus:

Chorus:
Oh, she floats thro' the air with the greatest of
ease
Thou'd think her a man on the flying trapeze
She does all the work while he takes his ease
And that's what's become of my love.

Last chorus Casey Jones:
Casey Jones! two locomotives
Casey Jones that's a going to bump
Casey Jones two locomotives there's two locomotives
That's going to bump.

Casey Jones

Come all you rounders if you want 
to hear
A story about a brave Engineer.
Casey Jones was the Rounders name
A high right-wheeler of mighty fame

Chorus:
Casey Jones! mounted to the cabin
Casey Jones with his orders in
his hand
Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
And he took his farewell trip
To the Promised land.

The caller called Casey at a half-past
four
Kissed his wife at the station door
Mounted to the Cabin with his orders
in his hand
And he took his farewell trip
To that Promised land. Chorus:

Put in your water and shovel in your
coal
Put your head out the window watch
them drivers roll
I'll run her till she leaves the rail
Cause I'm eight hours late with that
western mail. Chorus:

He looked at his watch and his watch
was slow
He looked at the water and the water
was low
He turned to the Fireman and he said
We're going to reach Frisco
But we'll all be dead. Chorus:

Chorus:
Casey Jones! going to reach Frisco
Case Jones but we'll all be dead
Casey Jones going to reach Frisco
We're going to reach Frisco
But we'll all be dead.

Casey pulledup that Reno hill
He tooted for the crossing
With an awful shrill
The switchmen knew by the engine
moan
That the man at the throttle was 
Casey Jones

He pulled up within two miles of the 
place
Number four stared him right in the 
face
Turned to the Fireman
Said Boy you'd better jump
Cause there's two Locomotives
that's a going to bump.
