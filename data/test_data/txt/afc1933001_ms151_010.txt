Thanks for clear letter

November 15, 1939
Mr. Alan Lomax
Division of Music
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
Miss Eleanor Weinstock has referred your letter with regard
to the recording I need, to me.
I am enclosing a copy of the letter which we received from
Mr. Hamilton, as well as the one which Miss Weinstock wrote,
on his instructions, to the U.S. Recording Company in
Washington.
Will these arrangements be sufficient, or is there something
further that we should do to procure this recording?
Very truly yours,
Sheldon Dick.
Sheldon Dick
