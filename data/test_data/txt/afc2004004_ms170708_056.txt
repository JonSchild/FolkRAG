Lomax: Oh yes. You were telling us those toasts a while ago. Would

Kennedy: All the world's as round as a wheel. (pause)
Cox: Yes.  Oh well, all the world's as round as a wheel,

May no one in Sutton ever want for bread.
Lomax: That's a great one. And what's your one about sharp as a

Cox: Oh. The Lord above once sent down a dove
With wings as sharp as razers,
Cut the throats of all the blokes
That served bad beer to sailors.

Lomax: Oh yes, we'd like to hear 'em. We're not - I'm not in a 
hurry. What are those?
Cox: You - there's old wheelcatchers' song you never did hear.
Lomax: Wheelcatchers?
Cox: Mm. Used to go. . .
