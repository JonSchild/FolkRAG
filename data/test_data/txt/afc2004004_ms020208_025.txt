you eat something, didn't you -- something like that.  And may be they'll
hit it, you know, may be they did eat or drink something at such-and- 
such a time like they said.  Well, they got you then. They fix you up
a little stuff and get a lot of money out of you. As long as people
can pull you out of money on a thing, brother, they'll use it. They go
on and all like a that. Lose something, she tell em where to find it,
and they find it, no fooling.
A: You think she really can do this.
R: She did it. There was a woman came by one day and had lost a dollar, 
it was a silver dollar -, and she told her, says, "I lost a dollar 'tween
here and town." And she just talking, she says, "Well, you lost that dollar
down in that little cover down there." And she went back down there, 
she looked and she didn't see it, and se went back and said she didn't
find it. And she said well, it's under something; you go back. And
she went back there and kinda looked under the cover, and sure enough,
(laughter) the dollar was laying right under there.
And the woman lost a -- somebody stole her horse up there, and she
asked her about it. She told her, "Well, now, don't you worry about
the horse." She say, "That horse will come right by your house; there'll
be a man driving it." And it wasn't but a week, I think, after that
before that horse went over by her and she stopped it, got the load,

And then, that glass company over there, they lost a typewriter and a 
adding-machine, and they came over there and asked her where it was.
And she told them it was out there in the country in the haystack. And
they went out there and they scraped around there, and they didn't find
it, and they come back. They said, "Now what about this?" Well. she
say, "Now you dig down there; it's down there." So they went back, and
sure enought they had dug a hole there, and set the thing in there and had that hay over it. And they found it, found it down in there, and
