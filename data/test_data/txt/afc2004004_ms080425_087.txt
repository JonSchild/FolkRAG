(Mr. R): A measure bar divides the time in a song. If it's
4/4, you'll have a measure bar after four quarter notes, 
or two half notes, or one whole note, or a half rest,
and a half... something that equal to 4 over 4. Then
a phrase bar is a little broader, and that's the end
of a phrase. For instance, "When we been there ten
thousand years bright shinin' as the sun" -- that's
a phrase. Two broad bars, at the end -- indicates the end 
of the song. These are your notes from 13:
a whole note is an open face note with no stem --
that's a whole note, it gets four beats. A half note
is an open face note with one stem. A 1/4 note is a
black note with one stem...and with one flag is the
eighth, two flags is the sixteenth, and with three flags
is the 32nd. A dot placed by a note adds half the
length of that note. On page 14 we have rest equivalent
to each note. A whole rest is a strong bar under
the third line.  A half rest is a strong bar above the
third line. These are the names: semibreve, minim, 
crochet, quaver, semiquaver, and demisemiquaver.
An octave is an interval of 8 degrees. This is an
octave. This is your key note, and when you hit your
key note again, that's an octave. There are seven tones
in the scales, and then the 8th one is an octave above
the first one. And then we have an extended scale, 
where you can add lines below or lines above as the
case may be. That's called extending the scale.
We have three different modes of time in the Sacred Harp.
We have common time, and triple time, and compound.
