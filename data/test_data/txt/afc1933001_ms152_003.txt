Mr. Alan Lomax.         #2.

I enclose the words of two of these songs, as far as I was able
to make them out.   "Three Friends' Advice" I take to be a lampoon
directed at lesser religious groups in Trinidad, from the
point of view of members of the Established Church!

If this suggestion of mine appears feasible to carry out, I
could list for you all material I was able to locate in the
field of American folk-song, and you could then indicate what
you would like to add to the Archive's collections. I am in
Washington fairly frequently, and we could transact these
little deals over a period of months or longer, if that proved
necessary or desirable.

Needless to say, I earnestly hope that an exchange can be
arranged. 

Sincerely yours,

Joanna C. Colcord
