TAPE 79: JEANNIE ROBERTSON.
Go Away From my Window.
1) Go away from my window, 
Don't bother me, 
Go away from my window, 
Don't enter in. 

2) I'll tell my brothers, 
I'll tell them of my sins,
Go away from my window, 
Don't enter in. 

The Cuckoo's Nest: 
1) There is a full bush in our kale-yard, 
There is a full bush in our kale-yard, 
At the back of yon bush there stands a lad and lass
But they're busy, busy wearing at the cuckoo's nest.

It is thornt, it is sprinkled it is compassed all around, 
It is thornt, it is sprinkled and it isn't easy found, 
She said, "Young man, you're plundering,"
He said it wasn't true, 
But he left her with the makings of a young cuckoo.

It's hie the cuckoo, ho the cuckoo, hie the cuckoo's nest, 
It's hie the cuckoo, ho the cuckoo, hie the cuckoo's nest, 
I'll gie anybody a shilling and a bottle o' my best
That can ruffle up the feathers of the cuckoo's nest.

Lomax: What king of song do you call that?

Jeannie: Well, I'd just say it was a song with a kind of                   in it!

Wi' MyRoving Eye:
1) For as I gaed doon the Overgate I met a bonny wee lass, 
For she winked to me with the tail of her eye as I went walking past.
Wi' my roving eye, fol-a-doo-a-di,
Wi' my rovin' di-dum-derry, wi' my rovin' eye.

2) She took me to her sitting room a wee bit doon the toon, 
It was there we poured a bottle oot and then we both sat doon.

3) She took me to another house a wee bit doon the burn. 
It's true what Robbie Burns said "A man was made to mourn."

4) I'll gae hame to Auchterady, contented for to be, 
For the losing of my five-pound note with the lassie in Dundee.
