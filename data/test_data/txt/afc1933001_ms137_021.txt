Request of Alan Lomax,
   Assistant in Charge
   Archive of American Folk Song

     Attached is a suggestion from Mr. Alan Lomax that
the Library pay Mr. James W. Green, ballad singer, $15 for
the ballads he has contributed to the collection of the
Archive of American Folk-Song. I recommend that this be
paid and charged to the appropriation for the Increase of 
the Library.
