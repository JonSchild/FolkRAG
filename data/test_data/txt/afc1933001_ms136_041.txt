Fair program is really coming through and 
that anytime soon, I could find a lot of 
important material for it in these intervening 
two or three weeks.
Of course the Presto is not bad especially
with sapphires on the new discs (superb
I think) but we do need and require a 
better piece of equipment than they offer.
I suggest a 16" 33 rev/sec
turntable as a possibility and the best 
cutter they have.  Also it may be difficult 
to plug a $15 mike (dynamic) into 
an expensive outfit. [Well] If we buy 
Presto, strongly urge them to cut down 
on overall size.  There is no sense in their 
machine being as large as it is.  Use of metal
tubes, perhaps.
I hope you like my report.  I'll write 
again tomorrow
Yours
Alan Lomax
