June 14, 1938

Mr. Robert E. Allen,
Ohio University,
Athens, Ohio.

Dear Bob:

I'm departing the slums of Washington 
for the summer sometime in the first two weeks of
July. Couldn't you manage to get here before that
time? We have a good many things to talk over, besides
which I'd just plain like to see you again.

Please let me know when you are going to 
arrive.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
