for I knew they would appreciate 
having your splendid collection of 
interesting material as well as 
the dedicatory phrase to Brother,
contained in its front pages.
I shall look forward to the volume   
with your portrait of Brother.
You really gave a splendid picture 
of him in the Atlantic.
Thanking you for all members of 
our family and with kindest wishes
for the welfare of yourself and 
your dear ones   Sincerely yours 
Ima Hogg
