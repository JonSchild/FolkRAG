in the park the other day. (WE SAW AN ALBINO IN THE PARK, AND

that way; they just born; sumpin' or other happened, they just
born red, or, an', an' ugly-lookin' skin. Ya see.

families an' some would pick 'em by the way they [thought] think the
boy would be an' whatnot an' all that ol' kinda stuff. But all
that ['s got to] stuff is be passed away now 'cause they got where they
pick for theyself. But they foun' out, the people foun' out that
they don't know nobody by lookin' at 'em, know what I mean? Not
all the time. You know, some , some things, if you, have a,

some things, but you don't know that person. An' that person
don't know hisself. See. He don't know his own self. See.
