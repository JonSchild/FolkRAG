A [?]hi. Irish Ballad
My name it is Clevis
    Calligan
That name I'll never
    deny
I left left my aged
parents in Ireland for
    to die

But now I'm dying innocent.
    gd christians pray
           for me
That G will save ol Ire
    and m' soul for eternity

   A Chicago song
     from
Mrs. A. B. Burns
