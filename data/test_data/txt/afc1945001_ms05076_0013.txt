Liberty, Missouri, August 4 ---- I hear our American
army generals are too old and lacking in aggressiveness
to launch an offensive war. Japan keeps on moving in on
the Aleutians, into China and south toward Australia and
the Allies do little about it. Looks like we got too many
political generals and mossbacks. What people in this
country want is to quit marking time and take the offensive
somewhere in this war. [* 11 *]
