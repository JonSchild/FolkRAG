can and I better go to Columbus and try that.  So I went down
and I got me a job.  Well, they sent me to a doctor.  And these
doctors, one was talking to the other and he said, that man's
lungs have broke down.  He's got something wrong with his lungs.
And they come bzck in, both of them, said Mr. Workman. . . I say
yessir.  They say, we can't OK you for work.  I said What's
wrong?  They said they's something wrong with your lungs.  Your
lungs have broken down.  If anything happened to you. . .
you're not able for this work. . If anything happened to you,
it'd be enough to break this company up, they'd be on us
doctors.  They said, what did you work at before you come
here?  I said, the coal mines.  They said, the coal mines,
huh, huh.  He said, that's what it is, coal dust in your lungs.
He said how long did you work up there?. . . . No wonder. . . .
. . .He called it pneumacosiosa(?)  He didn't say black lung. 
He said, you go back to the coal company, they woun't put
you back to work.  I said, I know they won't, the told me
they won't.  He said, you go back and tell them you want
compensation.  They should pay you compensatoin.
(Jump & HOLLER)  I said, they told me they didn't pay no compensation, there wasn't
no such thing as black lung.  They said, they telling you
wrong, you go back there and jump and holler.  So I went back
and jumped and hollered to the boss. And no, they wouldn't
pay nothing like that.  There wasn't no such thing.  And I wrote
that song.  (He sings 2 lines, then tape ends.)
