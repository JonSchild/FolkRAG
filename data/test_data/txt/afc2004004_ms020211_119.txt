Dear Mr. Lomax:
I received your letter of January 3, but not in time to delay
the sending of the contract and to include the new fee.
The one hundred and fifty dollar fee ($150) is fine, also the
suggested type of program is just the kind I had hoped they
would be willing to tackle.
I feel you must be confused as to the administration of this
program and the CAC concert.  The Sunday, February 9 program
is to be a free children's program, open to the general public.
It is held at three o'clock in the afternoon, and usually lasts
one hour, or an hour and a half, but no longer.  The workshop
and concert on February 8, to which you referred, are under the
sponsorship of the CAC, our volunteer organization, and are not
administratively connected to my office.  Mrs. Josefson, a member
of this CAC, asked that I contact you to arrange this Sunday
program, as long as the performers would be in town.  Perhaps
this somewhat simplified explanation will clarify the organization.
Please, let me know what to do regarding the contract, as I am
unfamiliar with such procedures.
Sincerely,
Nancy Forte
Assistant Curator
