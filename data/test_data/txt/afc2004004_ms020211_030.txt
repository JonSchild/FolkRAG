Dear Mr. Lomax:

I would appreciate your help in the following:  The
Georgia Sea Island Singers, who performed for the childrens'
program Sunday, February ninth(9), were pain by us.
A check  was prepared for the total of one hundred and
fifty dollars;  however, before the performance the request
for cash payment was made and they were given cash
instead.  Unfortunately, the check was not endorced, and 
in order to straighten out our records, we need a receipt.
Would you be so kind as to send the same.  The money was
give directly to Bessie Jones.

We were delighted by the performance and would like to
send letters of thanks to all the members of the group; 
would you please send the addresses where they can be contacted?

Thank you for your consideration in these matters.

Sincerely yours,
[* Nancy Forte *]
