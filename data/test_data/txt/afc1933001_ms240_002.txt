Dear Alan:

Denver University has me down
to speak July 21 on "The Folk
Song Archive of the Library of Congress"
You made a talk on the same subject
just before the Southwestern group
this spring. Kindly without delay,
instanter, forward me a copy of
your address and any other material
about the Archive.

Somewhere sloshing about
the Library is Johnny's Father's
Day letter to me. Please, if possible,
retrieve it, and forward it
to me. Bess leaves Sunday.
I've been ailing again though
at present the hunger gnawing
at my vitals keeps me going. I'm
determined to reduce. 
Father
