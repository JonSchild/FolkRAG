What the War Means to Us

We are in the midst of a
terrible war. None of us likes wars,
but this just had to come about.

As you and I know there are
many items rationed. Some of the
things rationed are shoes, food
and maybe a few more things.
Many of us say that it is not
necessary to ration these items.

You should along think about
these questions. How many of
our boys, sons, and husbands
are going each and every day to
help us enjoy freedom of speech,
freedom of the press, and
freedom from want.

You answer should be there
are hundred and hundreds of sons,
brothers, and husbands, that
are going to the army, navy, or
some service to do their job.

These men are out there fighting
losing their lives, or becoming
cripple, deaf, and otherwise [*Folder 124*]
