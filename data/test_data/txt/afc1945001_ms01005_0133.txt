Correspondence re. Rumors

Attached are a batch of letters, mostly in your name,
sent to the latest group of would-be rumor clini[t]cians. I believe
that the stand we take in these letters — asking rumor clinics
to hold up their work until they receive our material — is the
proper one to take.

The material which I propose that we send them will
consist of the following:

(1) Several copies of the expurgated rumor report

(2) An outline of action to set-up a rumor clinic which
will (a) gather rumors, (b) catalog them according
to criteria used by us and helpful to us in future
rumor analyses, and (c) explain to local newspapers
why it isn't a good idea to publicize rumors and
rumor clinics without baldly telling them not to
inspire such collections

(3) Suggestions for discussion groups among editors
about the nature of rumor, its care and feeding.

Rosten will, I feel pretty sure, follow this line in
his recommendations to the director and will, in addition, suggest
to the proper liaison officer that our rumor material be taken
over by the Office of Civilian Defense for guidance of such rumor
activity at the local level [that] as may come to its attention.

I strongly recommend that word be passed along in the
mailing room and to Mr. Davis' secretary that all communications
from private individuals and defense groups on the subject of rumor
be channeled to this Division for response in order that OWI's
responses in all cases shall be the same.

?: Is it all right to release the expurgated version
with its present face sheet which gives a Special Services report
number and the name of the Bureau of Intelligence? Or would you
rather have a new face sheet made reading simply "Office of War
Information"? I ask this question because of your announcement
of a change in policy at the Friday meeting.  [*Will Mrs. Curran
kindly advise Miss Sherman on this?*]
