to see some of their gorgeous 
Easter parades and 
celebrations.  So we are 
here through Sunday.
Monday we go on to 
Florence for three days 
where I have an old schoolmate;
then to Venice 
for a couple; next to 
Milan.  From there in 
to Switzerland for a 
week or so, and on back 
to Paris.  As for me 
I am finding myself 
an indifferent sight-seer.
Museums and the 
like are beginning to

an eye for a quiet spot 
where I can sit awhile 
and look at the landscape - 
the cost of France or some mountain
retreat in Switzerland.
May then 
I can settle down and 
do some work.  I have 
been a real loafer 
ever since I took the 
boat in New York, 
Feb. 9.  Again I can
sleep and I haven't 
missed a meal. Each 
of us have had a tooth
