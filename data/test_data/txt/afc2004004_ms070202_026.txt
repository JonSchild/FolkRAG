but the same thing was true when Theoline
lead and her voice broke constantly -
as a general rule so far as I can see
so far age seems to take precedence
in leading the voo-doo songs - I 
noticed that Elize lead at the gateau

Anita has the reputation as the
queen singer of Port Bendit - 
Dr. Reiser - 

Cults: 
Maji is Petro
Simbi
Petro - Logane
Gede - Miragoane
Arada Franc - North 
[*Damballa, Legba, Gede, Simbi songs sung.*]
Ibo !
Congo ?
Nago ?
Mayis  
Mazou
Yen Valou -- not danced in North.
[*North prefers Mayi, Zepol, Magan solely [to] dance types, not cults*]
Dahomey - just a dance
In the north possessed with Marassa - not on the Cul de sac
