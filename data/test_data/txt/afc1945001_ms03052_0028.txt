Gentlemen:

At the request of Mr. James B. Marley, Regional Director of the
Social Security Board and Defense Health and Welfare Services, I 
have kept notes on rumors in any way related to the war effort which
I have heard since Monday morning, August 3.  They are as follows,
with place and date heard, noted:

Gainesville, August 4 - 

"They are going to build a detention camp and a shell-loading
plant near here.  This thing around here is going to expand."

Gainesville, August 4 - 

"An Army camp about this size (Camp Howze) is to be at 
Cleburne.  It will have over 100,000 acres.  Survey work is going 
on now.  I understand it will be an armored division kinda like the
one at Killeen."

Gainesville, August 5 - 

"The Army won't let the farmers harvest their crops, but the 
Army is burning some of the crops in order to clear the land."

Gainesville, August 5, -
"Our congressman has a lot of pull.  I understand he got
through a release for building three houses here--the three built
by Mr. Bellew."

Gainesville, August 5 0 

"They are going to expand Camp Howze from what was intended,
but don't know how much."
