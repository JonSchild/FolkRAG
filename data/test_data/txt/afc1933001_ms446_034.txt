May our hearts be tuned to sing,
Praise Him, love Him evermore,
He's the God whom we adore.

WILL MOTHER KNOW ME THERE?

When I reach my home eternal, reach the city
bright and fair,
When I stand among the angels, will my mother
know me there?

CHORUS:
Yes, I know that she will know me in those mansions
bright and fair,
Mother's love can never forget me, and I'm sure
she'll know me there.-- Chorus repeated.

I have changed with changing seasons, I am bent
with trials and cares;
Do you think she will remember, will my mother
know me there?--Chorus repeated.

Oft for me my mother wrestled when she used to
kneel in prayer;
Do you think she has forgotten? Will my mother
know me there?--Chorus repeated.

Mother's face has been a beacon o'er a sea of deep
despair,
I shall look for her up yonder, will my mother
know me there?--Chorus repeated.

THE SONG OF MOABITES

Come all ye knighted sons of Moabites,
And learn to do as I have done,
You might have a brighter mourner
Within the New Jerusalem.
