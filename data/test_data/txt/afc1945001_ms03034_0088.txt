Dear Dr. Allport:

Enclosed is a copy of the Bureau of Intelligence report on rumors, embodying as you will see when you examine it, not a little of the Boston material.

The purpose of this particular report was to put an end to a lot of "old wives' tales" about rumors within the Office of War Information, and to state the less fallible of the hypotheses held on this subject.

In any case, it is quite a superficial canvass of the subject. In the future we intend to study specific rumors more intensively than was possible in the time available for this study.

Any suggestions which you may have or any disagreements with our conclusions which you may wish to register will, of course, be very much appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
