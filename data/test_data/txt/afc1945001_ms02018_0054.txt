Report on Rumors - 4

Labor Shortage

1.  I have heard that fifteen-year old girls are working on hay
balers.  (Supervisor of training for auxiliary police in Maricopa
County Sheriff's Office.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.)

2.  It is feared that dairy herd owners will cut down their herds
because they cannot get milkers and other dairy labor.  And there is 
already a shortage of liquid milk in the State.  (Secretary of state
milk producers association.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.)

3.  Farmers who have been renting land are not renewing their leases for next year because they cannot obtain farm labor.  (Farmer 
on street.  Phoenix, 8-12-42.)
