     They had got 'er ta where that she would kinda, you know,
sit still some. She wouldn't run around as much as she usta.
They had put 'er in, Ol' Southern Jain, Fitzgerald Jail.  All parts,
diffrunt places around there, Ray, you know, 'till somebody
come an' git 'er.  Says a wild woman, crazy woman.  She
wasn't crazy; she jus', you know, in that, on'y; on'y at times.
You know, when them things would git on 'er, a spell would git on
'er, she'd walk.
     Well, anyway, they tol' me all an', ah, said, "Bessie, I
wish you'd go look at Pinkey."
     I wen' in there an' looked at Pinkey.  An' there she was.
In that shape.  I pure cried; it hurt me so bad.  An' then they
tell me what Aunt Mae Lizzie did.  An' how she did.  I thought it
was so silly!  I said, "Y'all let the woman jus' come to the
house an' do all them things?"  So they musta been spellbound or
sumpin', an' couldn't help theyself or something.
     Dey, far as they remember -- they don't know when she started
messin' wit' 'er, ya know.  An' not on'y her; she was gonna do it
of 'em.  They had a well on the porch.  An' the bucket got in the
well one day.  The water wasn't tastin' good so they quit drinkin'
the water.  An' they begin to, uh, uh, jus' wash in it.  An' one
day the bucket fell in the well.  An' in fishin' the bucket out
the well, they fished up a ball, big ol' round ball a, rag ball
a stuff.  An' worms was stickin' out that thing; they say everywhere
you could look, like a bait head, a worm head, was stickin'
out that thing.  They got that out the well.  The well was on the
porch.  Ain' no tellin' how long some a 'em had been drinkin' or
whatnot.  Jus' confound  the whole house.
