"A Rumor"
I have heard a rumor that
our colored boys are not being justly
treated by the white.  That even at
this time of war and destruction the
colored soldiers; who are fighting
bravely to defend this country, and
the white are yet predjudised.
It has been rumored that the white
servicemen center send the state
left over foods to the Colored 
U. S. O.
