"Once more again, holy farther, that we come be fore the, thanking you, holy
farther, for our last night lying down and this morning early rise, finding that our bed
were not my cooling board and cover were not my winding sheet, my pillar were not my dying
piller, and my dressing room were not my grave,, and were able to see your darling sun
rising and now she is on her way Behind the western hills, and no that you have all the
power in heven and in earth in your hands.  So here us lord, and ride like you use to ride
and drop a crum of love in the mits (midst) that it might spread abroad in our harts.  You 
no, holy farther, that you heard Daniel in the lion den and the three hebrew children in
the fire of furnish and John on the ile of Patimos:  but I am one of your poor, meek and
humble servant down in a mean land and country among howling wolfs and tented (2 - temptin
devels, living on borried land.  But we no that you are a well of warter in a dry place
and bread in a starving country; and we ask you to let every [starving] sinner man and
women's let them no they have got to die and can't live always,and their house is on fire
and gradully burning down.  Now,after remembering all, remember poor unworthy me, hoe (who)
feel the least of all;now,Lord, when we have done all in this world that I can do and
my vorse (voice) have been hushed up throu the land and country, my trakes (tracks)
is been blown out by the cool wen (wind), and my tung have froze to the roof  of my
mouth; when I am done riding midnight trains, and doors have been closed in my face the
last time, give me a happy time in death where I can pray your name forever.  Amen."
