b) The mule skinner who built the levees, the railroad enbankments, the foundations 
for cities in the South, voices his weariness of the sun and the heat and 
the dust. The tune is one of the standard folk-tunes of the South.

LEVEE CAMP HOLLOW
Oh, L-a-w-d, don' 'low me to beat 'em;
Got-a beg along.

(Git up there, Rosie!)
(Gee, back there, Dancer!)
Oh, L-a-w-d, they don' 'low me beat 'em;
Got beg 'em 'long.

(Tighten up a little bit!)

Oh, L-a-w-d,
If my good woman had-a-been here, good pardner,
I wouldn't a-been here a-stumblin' and fallin' tryin' to make it back home.

(Git up out that mud there!)
(Look out there; I'll knock you to your knees tirectly.)

Oh, L-a-w-d, I'm goin' back, good pardner, one day before long;
I don' need no tellin', -already know.

(Look out there, Dancer!)

Oh, L-a-w-d, I got a whole heap to tell you, good pardner;
                    oh, Lawd, when I get home.
L-a-w-d, I been stumblin' and fallin' tryin' to get away.

(Look out, mule!  Git up there!)

L-a-w-d, if my good woman had-a-been here, good pardner, I'd-a-a
                                       I'd done been gone.

She'd brought my good shooter, good pardner, and a box of balls.

(Look out, Roodie!)
(Git up, Jerry!)
(Look out there, Paul!)
(I don't want to kill one of you this mornin!)

Oh, L-a-w-d, the cap'n got a pistol and he wanted to be bad;
Must be the first one he ever had.
