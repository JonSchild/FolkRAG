note the operation of at least two of the typical 
Freudian mechanisms.

a.  Projection.  This mechanism consists in imputing
to another person or group a secretly desired,
but forbidden, act and thereby gaining vicarious 
gratification.

Example:  It was recently rumored that in one
New England town located near an army camp sixty
high school girls were pregnant as a result 
of associating with soldiers.  Such a story is 
listened to eagerly as a vicarious sexual experience,
but at the same time the moral sense may 
assert itself in condemning the condition.

b.  Rationalization.  This mechanism consists in
finding reasons for a course of action actually
determined by other unacceptable motives.

Example:  During the last war, rumors were rife
among the German soldiery to the effect that
Belgian civilians had organized for guerrilla
warfare.  This no doubt served to allay guilt
feelings over Germany's violation of Belgian
neutrality.  Again, there have been widespread
rumors in Germany in recent times relating how
the Jews are anatomically different from other
humans, are, in fact, not quite human.  This
again is no doubt motivated by an attempt to 
escape quilt feelings and justify abuses.

VI.  What factors determine belief in rumors?

Ordinarily, rumors are not widely transmitted if
they are disbelieved.  Accordingly it would be well to
investigate the determinants of belief.  We shall distinguish
the following factors.

a.  Evidence.  Any rumor is related, however distantly,
to some known facts.  These facts may be 
meager or abundant, equivocal or univocal.  We 
shall call them collectively evidence.

b.  Wish.  Almost any rumor presents a proposition
about which we have some feeling, i.e., we wish it 
to be ture or false.  In some instance this may be
intense, in others negligible.

c.  Threat to security.  Any rumor exists in a context
of reality.  It is clear that at times, it may
be dangerous to the security of an individual to
accept or reject a given rumor, due to the actual
surroundings in which the person finds himself.
