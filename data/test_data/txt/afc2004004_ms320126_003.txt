This group is known as the Hackberry Ramblers.  We have been playing 
for quite a number of years, in fact, this is our 
fiftieth anniversary.  We started back in March of 1933, and 
at that time Edwin Duhon, who was an original member, and 
myself, we had another member by the name of Alvin Ellender.  
We got together in Hackberry, Louisiana, and that's the 
reason the name "Hackberry Ramblers". At that time we 
started broadcasting over station KFDM, which was comin' out 
of Beaumont.  We broadcast out of Lake Charles by remote 
control.  We started at that time and we have been playing 
ever since, except for a span of about six or seven years 
that we had quit for a while, just got tired of playing and 
we stopped.  But now that we're all retired, we have gotten 
back together.  Crawford Vincent, here, joined the group in 
1940, late '40, and he has played on and off since that time 
with us.  Now Edwin had to leave for a period of about six 
or seven years.  When we first started, he played about a 
year and then he had to leave because of the fact that he 
went to work in the oilfields.  Of course, he got married 
about that time which meant that he had to have an income.  
We weren't making too much money at that time.

Was the idea that you'd have a group out in Western Louisiana 
that would do French songs and Cajun songs?

Well, when we first started, really, I started playing what 
we called the Hillbilly numbers, and Edwin had been playing 
the Cajun numbers.  So when we joine, in other words, we 
kind of developed the two different styles, with Cajun and 
Hillbilly.  At that time we called it "Hillbilly".  Of 
course now they call it "Country".  But, we did develop the 
two styles, and when we started playing, at that time they 
had the accordion bands, and they usually had an accordion 
player, a fiddle player, and a triangle; and that was about 
the extent of the bands at that time.  And when we first 
started we took the place of an accordion band, and we 
weren't too sure if we're were going to go over, we were, 
two guitars and a fiddle.  We made a hit, and from then on 
we continued playing.  We played throughout Southwest 
Louisiana.  In fact, in '36, we played for Montgomery-Ward 
here in Lafayette for a year.  We played on Monday,
