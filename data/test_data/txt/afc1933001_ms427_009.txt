BREAD AND ROSES
(Sheet Music – Published by Woman's Press)

As we come marching, marching, in the beauty of the day,
A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray,
Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses,
For the people hear us singing,
"Bread, and Roses, Bread and Roses" .

As we come marching, marching, we battle too, for men,
For they are women's children and we mother them again.
Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes
Hearts starve as well as bodies:
Give us bread, but give us roses.

As we come marching, marching, un-numbered women dead
Go crying through our singing their ancient song of bread,
Yes it is bread we fight for.
But we fight for roses, too.

As we come marching, marching, we bring the Greater Days;
The rising of the women means the rising of the race.
No morethe drudge and idler; ten that toil where one reposes
But sharing of life's glories:
Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses.

BROTHERHOOD
(Page 179 – Tune: "Die Wacht am Rhein"
Old Favorite Songs, – Wanamaker – )

The crest and crowning of all good
Life's final star is Brotherhood;
For it will bring again to earth
Her long-lost Poesy and Mirth.
'Twill bring new light to every face,
A kindly power upon the race;
And till it comes, we men, we men are slaves
A nd travel downward to the dust of graves.

Come, clear the way, then clear the way,
The fear of kings has had its day.
Break the dead branches from the path,
Our hope is in the aftermath
Our hope is in heroic men
Star-led to build the world again.
To this event the mighty ages run.
Make way for Brotherhood;
Make way for Man.
