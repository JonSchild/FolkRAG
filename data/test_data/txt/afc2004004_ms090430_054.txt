by average Negro farms is ginned by the company designated by their
creditors or landlords. The Lonview Gin directs its services to Negro
farmers who control the marketing of their own crops. Its patronage for this

Other Negro Communities
There are several other Negro settlements scattered about the
county. It is more comfortable for living and for ownership when the
Negroes live in communities. Gurley is one of these rural settlements. Most

the county can be induced to place a school near the community. In Gurley
the school is in the settlement, and is named for the Negro farmer who gave
the land on which it was erected.

In the Whiteburg Precinct there are two communities growing up
around the Cedar Grove and Pleasant Grove churches. Some of the most prosperous
Negro farmers in the area are located there. One or two own more
