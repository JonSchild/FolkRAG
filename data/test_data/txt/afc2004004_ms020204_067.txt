I have been in Bessemer-- this made me think--- and uh
my mother was outa town. I couldn't get a letter . I could
write a letter but wasn't nobody there. And so that was when
this "pression or something was on. Anyhow -food you could get
it if you was able to get it. But you just didn't have anything

home-- I know moma could-a got some-- but she was outa town--
and so I was there in Bessemer Alabama, my first time there
and last, I don't think I'll ever go back there again. So
I was out of money and I was rooming there with a lady, staying
there awhile, That was directly after I lost my husband.
