BJ TAPE 18, p. 48

"He sho' did!"  Ha, ha!  Don't care who died, he [had] have a heart
attack.  They all [gii ailin] (can ail ya); ya git so sick it
look like ya gonna die every minute.   As long as that don't attack
that heart you st-- you still livin'.  Jus' soon as attack that
heart, you's a dead buddy.   S-s-so!   I don't see no need a doctors
puttin' that [mess on' medicine] mess out toward heart attacks. (?)
Ha, ha, ha!  I said -- Peoples believe that, ya know.   Some folks:
"Oh, he jus' had -- He had a heart attack.  Ooooh."   Why, I said,
that's crazy!  I say everybody, everybody. . .heh, heh!  Never see
one die yet that didn't have it.   When they shoot 'im in the haid.
If it jus', if it jus' can make it, his heart can stand it, the
doctor can cure 'im.  That's right.  As long as don't mess with
it.
     That's the end of it.
