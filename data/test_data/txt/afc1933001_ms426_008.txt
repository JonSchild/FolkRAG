THE FARMER'S FAMILY

Tune: Sweet Adeline.

(Wife sings)
I like the farm,
It has a charm,
I'm up at morn, always quite worn,
I know it's gone, all we have done,
You're the breaking of my dream, old farm of mine.

(Husband sings)
Good-bye, old plow,
I don't know how,
To make it win-this seems a sin.
I've done my best-with all the rest,
Some one else can try and bust, old farm of mine.

(Grandma and Grandpa sings)
Oh happy day, 
It used to pay,
We had a smile, it was worth while.
The East has struck, it broke our pluck,
Now it's good-bye in our gray years, farm of mine.

(Boy sings)
No farm for me,
I'm going free.
I'm old enough to see it's tough.
Eight hours a day with better pay.
Take your galling slavery, old farm of mine.

(Girl sings)
No place so drear,
I only fear,
I'll have to slave, just like a knave.
I'm going to flee, to some city.
Good-bye eighteen hours a day, old farm of mine!

(A Union Member sings)
Just stop, my friend,
The long road bends,
The Nation's roused up to our cause.
We're winning slow, it's always so,
Soon you'll claim and sing its praise, old farm of thine.
It is decreed,
You shall be freed,
For home and right we dare to fight.
Old Glory waves, justice still saves,
Soon 'twill be earth's brightest spot, "old farm of
mine."
