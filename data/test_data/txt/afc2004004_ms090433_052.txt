A:  Not everybody's a musician, I suppose.

E:  No, they ain't looking for that.

A:  Well, what kind of guys did you meet on the road?  Every kind of guy?

E:  All kinds.

A:  Good guys and bad?

E:  Some good guys and bad; some guys are friendly and some aren't.

A:  Some guys will steal a penny of a dead man's back.

TITANIC TOAST.

Time when the Titanic went down,
This ship's on that Titanic.
And time, time again begun to sing
And he'd about begin to think.
And Shine over dinner and the barroom floor
He says, "Captain, oh captain, we're getting low."
He wrote a sign out, kick out the barroom door.
When the ship was going down,
When the Titanic was going down,
It sank and Shine was on the face.
There's a white girl, she fell out the ship
She said, "Oh Shine, oh Shine,
Would you say it's a full moon?"
Shine say, "You got a good stuff with you,
That I know,
But there's better stuff on the other show,
And keep it."
