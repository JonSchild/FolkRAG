on before the Festival opened, but 
Mr. Seeger promised that I 
should have copies of all his 
recordings. In Arkansas I 
recorded nearly a hundred 
songs from one blind mountain 
woman of the Washita region
 - more than 20 being Child Ballads 

The machine is there now 
in the hands of Professor [Rowell?] 
who is making more records. 
I shall pick it up next 
week and bring it in to Washington 
after making recordings 
in Indiana and Kentucky. I 
should be able to deliver it by 
Sept. 15, I hope in time for [?] 
Mannis of Florida also you 
may Expect my request by Sept 1.

Yours Truly,

John A. Lomax
