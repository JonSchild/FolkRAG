Dear Mr. Lomax:

We should like to have a little more data with respect to
the old song "Oh, Didn't He Ramble".  In your letter of
October 29th you advise that the tune was the "The Ram of
Derby" and was sung by the Conestoga Waggoners, etc.

I should like to know if you have some information available
as to where I could find this song or at least a
familiar chorus printed some time prior to 1902, the date
of copyright of the Cole version.  I have no reason to
question your statement about the age of this song, but it
will help immensely in settling the present dispute if some
earlier publication, either words of music or both, can
be found.  If you have such information or can direct me
to it, it will be greatly appreciated.  If it is desirable
to have some photostat copies made of some data in your
files, we shall, of course, be glad to stand the expense.

Thanking you in advance for any assistance you may be able
to furnish, I remain

Very truly yours,
H C Darnell
Manager of Copyright Section.
