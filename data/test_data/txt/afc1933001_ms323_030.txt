fees are required for persons using materials in the Arts
and Crafts studios, and for boating, riding, and movies.
The inclusive fee is the same as the minimum residential
fee for regular vacation guests; it therefore represents
a real opportunity to enjoy the famed Silver Bay
vacation hospitality and at the same time to embrace
a highly desired Recreational Institute. A descriptive
folder of Silver Bay may be had on request.

Members of the Institutes who desire to have their
families with them should write for special rates, indicating
the number of accommodations for which quotations
are desired. Such rates will be as low as is
consistent with good service. Members staying three
weeks will be refunded four dollars on their tuition fee.

VACATION-RECREATION ACTIVITIES . . .

Members of the Institutes are invited to participate
in as many of the following activities as they desire.
Competent direction is given. The facilities are unusually
