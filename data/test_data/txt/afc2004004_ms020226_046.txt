I said, "What is you got to do with it?"  An' I pulled out behind... ha.

An' so Gertrude went in her room an' she -- When I got back she done gone in her room.  That time she, ah, she stayed there a lil' way.  I said, "Well!"  I wa' walkin' up an' down.  I said, "Arizona, I feel like eatin'."  I'll never forgit that!

Arizona said... I said, "I didn't know I was hongry."  I said, "I sure..."  Said, "Gertrude made me hongry."  I was talkin' that way, and... but, but 't was funny.

She done put some plasters all about on it.  She come to the do'.  I thought she come for another fight.  I ain't say a word; I looked at 'er.  I was gonna kick 'er then; I was gonna get outa hurtin' 'er.  But I didn' wanna hurt 'er 'cause I know her condition.  I didn' wanna hit 'er.  An' so...

AL:  What was the matter with her, honey?

BJ:  An', an' she walked up in the do', she says, "Gi' me your hand."

I, I said, "All right."  I had out my hand, 'cause I was gonna knock her down good if she started anything.  An' so... An' I had 'er hand, she said, "Damned if we didn't fight, didn't we?"
