OLD-TIME LOVE SONGS

Ask a Southern ballad singer for "Barbara Allen" or "Lord Lovell"
or another of the old ballads, and he will be likely to say, "Why,
that's nothing but an old love song." This means: (1) The plot is,
usually, a love story and was felt by the singers to have a close
relationship with their lives and loves. (2) Strictly religious
singers would not sing it or tolerate its being sung in their homes.
(3) It was sung at "courtin'" parties, or in circumstances in which
the song had a meaningful connection with the emotions of the singer.
The people of America who preserved these songs and the rural people
who still sing them have never felt that these ancient ballads were
particularly ancient; nor have they valued them as such. Instead, as
we have tried to point out in our notes, they have kept these songs
because they felt their near and moving reality.
