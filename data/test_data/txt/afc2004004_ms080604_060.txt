A.L. :
     But you had to put out - when it came to
carryin stuff.  You had to work real hard, did't you?
W.B. :
     Oh yeah!  You had to work for what you earned
but, me being block-headed, you know, I could learn quick,
you know.  I started in the kitchen as a back flunky, . .in the
six months time I was swing cook.  And in nine months time, I
was second cook.  In a year's time, I was chef cook. Yeah.
A.L. :
     And there was plenty of money to be made out
of gambling besides cooking there.
W.B. :
     Oh!  Lord. .
A.L. :
     Are you a good gambler?
W.B. :
     I used to draw a hundred and twenty-five
dollar check and walk downstairs an shoot it!  And run it out.
Then I quit gambling and a started to lending money, dollar
for dollar.  And when I left from (unintelligible), I had
about twenty-three thousand dollars.
A.L. :
     Did you ever hear of anybody singing when they
gambled?
W.B. :
     Singin?
A.L. :
     Yeah.
W.B. :
     I tell you what, on the quarter boat?
--where they was gambling?  It was a whole lot quieter than
we is here.
A.L. :
     I see.
W.B. :
     Cos it was money betting.  You don't get no
record where they (knitting?), you don't get no record where
they're gambling.  All the records you made, you make sure
they ain't betting nothin!
