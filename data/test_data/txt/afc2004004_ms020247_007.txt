                      Wake up, Joshua, wake,
                      Luke and John, Lawd,
                      'Cause God's children do not
                      Sleep so sound.

CHORUS:     Dead and gone, Lawd,
                      Dead and gone, Lawd,
                      All the friends I had
                      Is dead and gone.

                      My poor sister
                      Died a-shouting,
                      All the friends I had
                      Is dead and gone.

                      My poor mother
                      Died so happy, etc.               (CHORUS)

                      I had a brother
                      Died so happy, etc.

                      Wake up, Joshua, wake, etc.

                      Don't sleep sound, Lawd,
                      Don't sleep sound, etc.

                      Some of these mornings,
                      Won't be long, Lawd,
                      We gonna come up
                      Out of the ground.               (CHORUS)

                      [The dead and gone, Lawd, etc.]
                      I had an auntie
                      Died so happy, etc.               (CHORUS)
