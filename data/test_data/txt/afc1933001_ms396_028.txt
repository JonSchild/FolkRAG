ADVENTURES OF A BALLAD HUNTER
John A.Lomax
I couldn't have been more than four years old when I first heard a cowboy sing and yodel to his cattle. Something had waked me where I slept on my trundle bed. A slow rain fell in the darkness outside. I listened to its patter on the pine shingles above me, and through the open window I could hear the soft musical tinkle of water pouring from the eaves and striking the gravelly earth beneath. These sounds come back to me faintly through the years, a foggy maze of recollections; and my heart leapt even then to thstcries of that cowboy trying to quiet, in the deep darkness and sifting rain, a trail herd of restless cattle:
Whoo-oo-oo-ee-oo-oo, Whoo-oo-whoo-whoo-whoo-oo
Oh,slow up,dogies,quit your roving round,
You have wandered and tramped all over the ground;
Oh,graze along,dogies,and feed kinda slow,
And don't forever be on the go--
Oh,move slow,dogies,move slow.
Oh,say,little dogies,when you goin' to lay down
And forget this forever a-siftin' around?
My legs are weary,my seat is sore;
Oh,lay down,dogies,like you've laid before--
Lay down,little dogies,lay down.
Whoo-oo-oo-ee-oo-oo, Whoo-oo-whoo-whoo-whoo-oo
Again came the crooning yodel,most like the wail of a coyote, only restful and not wild. Over and over and over the fresh young voice of the cowboy rang out in the long watches of the night,pleading with the cattle to lie down and sleep and not to worry;
It's my misfortune and none of your own,
For you know Wyoming will be your new home.
I listened a long time to the restless moving of the milling cattle,the deep muttered lowing protests against the discomforts of the storm and rain, longings for their home in far away Southwest Texas.
