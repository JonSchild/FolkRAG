But for politics we'd have a decent Organization
of Air Forces - There have been
more of the same kind of mistakes that happened
at Pearl Harbor, only we don't hear of
them openly.  The Army and Navy have sound-
detectors to spot airplanes, sure - they had
them at Pearly Harbor too - theoperator heard
planes and reported it - the Army said they
weren't theirs and the Navy said they weren't 
theirs, but nothing was done about it and the
men left their posts without doing anything;
it will continue to be so until their is an
organization of Air Forses.
