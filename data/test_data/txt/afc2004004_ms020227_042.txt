Has to keep that... Uh-huh.

TL:  Does she have milk right now?

BJ:  Uh-huh.

TL:  Even at 70 years old?

BJ:  Oh, yeah.  Milk-breasted, ya see?

But after all, ah, if she continue on, if I continue on, nursin' a baby or puppy or anything, why, it come more an' more, see?  It git jus' like it was if you was first nursin' a baby.

AL:  You can nurse babies or animals, either one?

BJ:  That's right.  Animals, either one.  I have nursed puppies, myself, many times.

AL:  When their mothers...?

BJ:  Tha's right, um-hum.  Nursed puppies.

TL:  Have you done this with animals?

BJ:  Yeah, puppies, little puppies.  Yessir.

TL:  Bessie, if a woman is milk-breasted and doesn't use her milk will it go away on her?

BJ:  Well, if a woman is milk-breasted it won't go away.

TL:  Ever?
