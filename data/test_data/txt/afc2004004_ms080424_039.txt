Roll 46 Jack's tale cont. 1

Ray: So Jack, he left the house, worked there and his nerves, he
got stuck, got carried away, and just stuck on that job there
where he got that property. He just happened to think that it
might help him to just get out on the public road and look around
a little that day, and see what he could learn, and what was goin'
in that long a time. So he gotta goin' a little piece, and he
heard somethin', and he turned his head, and he heard goin',
"a rickityrack, bumpitybump," ... He listened, and he walked on
 a piece and seed a old woman a comin', just awful, just drawed
plum down. There was just hides and bones, there wasn't a bit of
flesh about her. They just dried to it like an old dead trees.
And she was a comin', when it'd go "bumpitybump" her nose was
a hittin' her knee (technical)....and then the bones was screekin'
in the joints, there was no oil in 'em, the grease had left, dried 
out. And so he said, "Hello there ma'am." She says "Hello! They 
been a tellin' me all down the line that some blame rascal has got
Death tied up in a sack! By Jane Does! I've been wantin' to die,
it seems like it's been a million years! And I can't die, Death
is tied up somewhere!" And so Jack, that made him think -- he
was gettin' in bad shape. He went back and got some boys to climb
that tree and they cut that sack loose. They said it was up in
there, good as it ever was, not a bit decayed or nothin'. They
brought it down and when Jack opened it, pulled it open, and Death
come out, he was the first one that fell dead! And that's the end
of Jack. (technical) With my thinkin' now, to think back in my mind,
-- they was different minded people than we are today and back.
Them people was, they lived different, back at that time (Technical)
And so they had different ways to go at it, to make (cut)
