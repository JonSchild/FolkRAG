Fisk, 18. 3.

Hoowaw hee,
Hoowaw hee.

Last night,
Night before,
24 hours
At my door.

I got up,
They want in,
Hit um in the head,
With the rolling pin.
Hoowaw hee.

I ain't gonna count
But one more time,
That's gonna be
When the sun goes down
Hoowaw hee.

1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7,
Hum on the baker's
Ship comes sailin'
Hoowaw hee.

Florence Rembert is my name. I am 11 years old. From Canginaw

Tin, tin, double tin,
Forty-five, fiftin.
There's never been a priest
So I can't see them,
Hoowaw hee.

All in here holler
"Blackbird".

I ain't gonna count
But one more time.
That's gonna be
When the son goes down.
Hoowaw hee.
