Dear Mr. Spivacke:

You must not misunderstand
my letter to you about
Alan's Christmas Holidays. I simply
recalled that many corporations
met during the Holidays, or they
formerly did, and I hoped 
you could let Alan off from
attending this time, provided your
plans for his services for the
Library were not seriously disarranged.
Never at any time or
for any reason do I wish
to interfere with your dealings
