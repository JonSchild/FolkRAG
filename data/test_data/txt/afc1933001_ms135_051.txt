Mr. George Palmer Putnam
10042 Valley Spring Lane
North Hollywood, California

Dear Mr. Putnam:

We are sending you by express collect twenty-eight records
which were selected for your use by Mr. Alan Lomax. As you already
know, these discs require the use of special fibre or casein needles.
Casein needles are sold in most stores under the trade name of BCN
needles.

The records which you will receive are aluminum discs and may
prove very unsatisfactory acoustically. Our latest records, however,
are made on acetate discs which are more satisfactory as they are
almost devoid of surface noise.

After listening to these records, you will probably be better
able to furnish us with a more specific description of the type of
material you want. We may have something suitable and available for
use among our latest acetate discs.

The restrictions on the use of many of the records have been
placed on them by collectors and singers because of the lack of protection
afforded such material by the present copyright laws. If you
should be interested in using any of the restricted records, I shall
be glad to investigate the possibility of obtaining permission for
their use.

You may retain the records for a month, or more, but we should
appreciate their return by the middle of September. Please do not
hesitate to call on us for any further information. If we do not
have appropriate phonograph records, we may be able to find what you
want in our large collection of published material.

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
