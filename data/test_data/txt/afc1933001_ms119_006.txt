Port-au-Prince, Haiti
March 5, 1937

Mr. Alan Lomax
Plaisance, Haiti

Sir:

I have your letter of March 4, 1937, which arrived this
morning, in which you request the Consulate to let you
have $20.00 to tide you over until you receive some money
from the Library of Congress.

I am sorry to advise you that the Consulate nor the
Legation have funds available for such a purpose, and
personally I have certain obligations to meet this month
that will not permit me to help you at this time. I suggest
that you try and get a bit of credit there until your money
arrives which should not be long. In case you are unable
to do this let me know again and I perhaps will be able to 
scrap up a few dollars.

Sorry that I can not furnish you with brighter news at
this time but I am certain that you will be able to find
a way out. You make friends so easily with the natives.

Please give my best regards to your wife.

Sincerely,

Joseph H. White
