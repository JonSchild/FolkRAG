BJ TAPE 7B, p. 18

I walked on in the church an' sat down. An', you know,
they hadn't seed me. I walked on in there an' I sit down. An then
they all went to talkin', jus' talkin'. I told' me, "They
don't know. What I had been through with." I'd been through
with sumpin', ya see?! And what the Lawd give me...

Well, that night, when they started seekin'. Diffrunt
ones was seekin', diffrunt ones. I mean, after, de-devotion'
service? They started seekin'. Diffrunt ones was seekin'. So
my mother's husband's daughter, she looked like she was gonna git
saved in spite of all. She jus' fell out. An' boy, she was
tremblin' under the power! Oh, she fell out! Sumpin' showed
me: Stop.

I looked up -- I was on my knees -- I looked up, I said,
"Lawd, save her. 'Cause I ain't fit to be saved." I'll never
forgit that. I'll never forgit it. Said, "Lawd, save 'er...
'Cause I ain't fit for it. It ain't fer me. I ain't fit."

But I st-- I couldn't git off my knees. I still stay on
down there. See, I was ashamed to git up an' let the peoples see
me git up when [an'] everybody's down there seekin'. I seeked on. An'
for...an' to...so, so He come on to me then. The power come wit'
me an' all an' I begin to seek. I seeked and I seeked on.

So, when I knewed anything, myself, I -- Someone's sayin' to
me, said, â€” now ol' devil he, he musta knowed it. Devil right
there witcha, brother! He say, "If you git the Holy Ghost," said,
[If you git the Holy Ghost,] "Don't fall out like that. Don't do
that. You jus' git it fr-- you know, stay right there an' git up an'
[deleted] tell 'em you got it." That's wa' Satan; [I'm sayin'] he wa' right there! With
every point he could get. Tha's right!
