Mr. Harvey J. Bouck, Chairman
Lecture Committee
Kalamazoo Teachers Lyceum
Kalamazoo, Michigan

Dear Mr. Bouck:

I believe it would be possible for me to come  some time in October
or November to lecture to your audience, and a fee of $150.00 plus travel
would be satisfactory. There are a number of things that I might talk about:
for one, "Documentary Recording" which would include demonstration of folk
song recordings made in various parts of the United States and also documentary
records of community life made in the United States. These records cover the
period of America's preparation for entry into the war, and include Negro
ministers, cowboys, Indians, mountaineers and so on, and well demonstrate the
racy eloquence that the people of this country have. Otherwise I might talk
about songs of the American frontier, which is just another was of saying
American folk song. Such a talk would briefly and vividly sketch the interconnection of such folk song types as cowboy songs, railroad songs, ballads,
spirituals, etc., and it might be called "American Music, Home-Made" or something
of that sort. Another perspective on the same body of material would
be "America Through a Microphone", the story of collecting folk songs in
various parts of the country with illustrative records.

I am rather tired of the lectures mentioned on the back of the
attatched circular, but it gives certain autobiographical material from the
press agent's point of view and therefore I thought you might like to have it.

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
