Nov 24 -
Left London reluctantly - Drove into 
darkness. Wipers went out in an hour. 
Fog. Wet windshield. Tilshead, where 
Aunt Fanny R lives, in the heart of 
an artillery range. Beer in pub while 
big bonny rosy soldier talks about 
field-artillery fire.
Aunt Fanny was away, sick at 
her daughters. Found her, still 
merry, a grey robin, laughing 
over the pleasures of her life. She 
told me she had worked in London 
as a serving maid for a shilling 
a week - good houses a sh six p - 
and a maid who went out at 
night wd get the sack. Her father's the source of her songs: she 
remembered too or three because they were 
so funny.
