LOMAX NARRATION #4   -13

     As a, strictly chaperoned at these dances as
any young white lady.  Here she is in, in her, among her
widowed memories in her Catholic shrine with the pictures of
her children, her husband, round her, talking about her
Indian ancestry.
     An historian tells us that this part of
Louisiana was actually settled by mixed bloods of [choctaw]
ancestry who came from Alabama before the 19th century.  And
found new homes out on the prairie.  They were  white,
black, Indian and mixed.  And the main name was Fonteneau,
like Doris Dean, like Canray.  And it's here in this, at

amazing to be able to pinpoint the origin of a song style.
And even more so to see the original processes still at work
as an Indian, a French Arcadian, and a black Cajun fiddlers
swap an old tune.  A new black-white-Indian music was born
here, hardy enough to survive war and social upheaval.
