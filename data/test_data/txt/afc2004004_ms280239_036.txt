TAPE 46. JOHN STRACHAN. . . . JULY 17th, 1951. . .ABERDEEN

The Stoutest Man in the Forty-Twa.
1) Behold I am a soldier bold and only twenty-five years old,
A braver warrior never was seen frae Inverness to Gretna Green.
When I was young my father said he would put me to a decent trade,
But I didna like that job at all, so I went and joined the '42.
Chorus:
The wind may blow, the cock may crow,
The rain may rain and the snow may snow,
But ye winna break in Jock McGraw,
He's the stoutest man in the '42.

2) The sergeant when he 'listed me, he winked his eye and then says he
"A man like you so stout and tall'lln ne'er be killed by a cannon-ball,
The captain then, when he came round, he looked me up and he looked me down,
Then turning to the sergeant, "O ye scamp, you've 'listed the bleach-field out on tramp." (Cho.)

3) At our last fecht across the sea, the general he sends after me,
When I got there and my big gun, of course, the battle it was won.
The enemy all run awa', they were feared at the legs o' Jock McGraw,
A man like me so tall and neat, ye can ken yoursel' he could never be beat. (Cho.)

4) The king then held a grand review, we numbered a thousand and sixty-two,
The kilty lads come marching past, and Jock McGraw come marching last.
The royal party grabbed their sticks, and a' begun to stretch their necks,
Cries the king to the colonel, "Upon my soul, I took that man for a telegraph pole." (Cho.)

The Shepherd o' Rynie
1) At Rynie I sheared my first hearst
Near
My maister was richt elder fecht,
But laith was I to lose me fee.
Lilten owren owren a-dee,
Lilten lowren owren-ee.
