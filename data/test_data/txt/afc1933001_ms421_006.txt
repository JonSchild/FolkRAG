YELLOW DOG

(Tune: There's a Long, Long Trail)

There's a long, long fight before us
'Gainst that dog of yellow hue,
'Gainst that "Yellow Dog" that keeps us
From a freeman's due.
There's a fight and we shall win it;
We shall fight both night and day
Till the "Yellow Dog" will leave us
And go down a long, long way.

When we've gained the long-sought
vict'ry,
And we've won the freeman's right;
When we go to work with freedom
And the future's bright,
Then we'll sing a song to Labor,
To the friends that helped us through,
To the ones that led us onward
We will pledge our faith anew.
