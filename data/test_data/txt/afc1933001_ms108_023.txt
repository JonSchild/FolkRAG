He and Mr. Patterson spent the afternoon telling me about
European politics. Three days ago, they said, everyone in
France thought that they would be in a war by today.
Now, since Hitler is not going into Tscheckoslovakia
immediately it seems, they think the war will [be]
not come before April. But everyone thinks there'll
be a war this Spring, and God, France is arming.
You hardly see anything but soldiers. If a war comes
I'm going to get in it, I'm afraid. I just couldn't
go home and miss the excitement. If I can get a
job of course -
    
I've got lots more to tell you, but I have to
stick this in, before I fall completely asleep. Elizabeth, 
it's for you. Everywhere I go, I see clothes that
are just made for you, and for which I just
haven't the money. If you've got any to blow, do
you want to entrust me with it? There's an
Indian store here with the most exotic striped
mousseline-de-soie blouses and with very plain
exotic black dresses with beaten silver jewelry
at the neck. In Le Levandou they'll make you hand-
quilted peasant dresses for [about] from $5.00 to $7.50 looking
something like this: [sketch] only more so if you get
my meaning. Quilted all over, they are. I got me
one. Would you like any wooden jewelry; some of
the prettiest I've ever seen is in Le Levandou. There is also
a place here where the Rooshian nobility make gorgeous
Rooshian clothes. So, lovely, if you've got any money, I
would certainly like to spend it for you. I don't seem to have any
myself. My dress & my guitar & a few odds & ends of presents have momentarily
cleaned me. Write at once about this, if nothing else. My address stays the same. Much, much love to you both
