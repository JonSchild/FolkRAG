[*Rte 1 Como*]

Dear Miles and Bob,
Attached are some letters that I want you to sign and return
to me right away, so that I can sell the songs you recorded for me and
get you some money for them. Please sign [both copies of] two copies of
the one addressed to Miles and return at once to me in the enclosed
envelope.
Also get Mattie, Ida and Jessie to sign the other letters and send
them back.
Please hurry so that i can get the business settled as soon as
possible
 Your friend
Alan Lomax
