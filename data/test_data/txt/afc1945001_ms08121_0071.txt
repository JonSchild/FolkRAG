Thoughts We Think

The night the night the wind will blow,
Where in every crack will seek the snow.
I gaze around the barren field
Where many men die unhealed.

We gave our boys we sent them over
Through and under the Cliffs of Dover.
To the Pillipeans & Guadalcanal
Where every one is some ones pal.

Why come the tragic wasteful was
Why say the axis lets have more.
So they not think of love so dear
And we might have it over here.
