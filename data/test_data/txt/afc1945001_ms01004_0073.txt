Rumor              Dr. Barnes' listening post - Cleveland, July 15
page 5 - On The "Special Privilege" Defense Worker          [*[1942]*]

"The attitude of the average citizen whether rich or poor is
very bitter.  One of the best evidence of public hostility
is the number of stories in circulation about soldiers,
relatives, and men in ordinary walks of life beating up
insolent defense workers.  The number of such stories
is as great that it is evident many of them are
stock episodes.  My studies in public opinion, however,
have convinced me that the stories of this kind, because
they are so often apocryphal, are the more convincing.  It
simply means that the pubic demand for true stories,
representing the arrogance which they so abhor, has outrun
the supply and that improvised episode must be substituted."
