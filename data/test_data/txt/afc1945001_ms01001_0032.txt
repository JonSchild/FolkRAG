censorship keeps the newspapers from printing. The newspapers must be
asked to explain, when publishing a delayed story, why the story could
not earlier be released.
If people keep to themselves what they see in the normal
course of their day, impose upon themselves the same sort of self-
discipline that newspapers are expected to apply, rumors will not
develop. The flow of rumors depends, in part. on people's confidence
in their news sources. It is not enough for this country merely to
have the most reliable information sources, this fact must be known
by the people of the country. The people must have confidence in
their normal sources of information or else rumors will run riot.

and the members of the Advisory councils should be made known
