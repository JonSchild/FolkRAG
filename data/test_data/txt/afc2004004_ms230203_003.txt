KID:  ... we grew up together.  In other words I wanted to loved her and axed 
her mother for her an', well, she turned me down, an' that caused me 
to sing the blues.  You see, I-I couldn't get her, see, I thought-that's 
the reason I thought of the LITTLE SCHOOL GIRL*, see, 'cause me an'
 this girl used to go to school together (you know), an' then er-well, 
her parents thought that I wasn't the right boy for her (y'un'erstan'), 
'n' wouldn't make her happy 'n' ev'ything, an' so they turnt me down an' 
then I just got to sittin' down thinkin' (y'un'erstan'), an' then I 
thought of a song an' I started to drinkin' an' then I started to
 singing.

SID:  Well, what'd you drink?
