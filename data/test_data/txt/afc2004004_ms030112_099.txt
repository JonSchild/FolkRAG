Davis says How the Hell, my wifes come up and do a number with me, I was full of sleep, I ran up and did the best way I could. I wasn't expecting you know, I said let me know when you was going to do that thing. But you know him when he get a notion to do a thing he going to do it right then. I went up and I sing it was good, I was half asleep. I was in Philadelphia at the Second Fret you were right, we were there for two weeks.
