But you know that jes killed me to [keep t] think that he was gittin worse 
an I had to keep tellin him he was gonna be all right. An I know all the 
time he wouldn't. The doctor kept tellin me, say, "Don't tell him. If you 
tell him he prob'ly wouldn't live three hours." An so -- I jes couldn't 
tell him, but it sho worried me not to tell him. I'd jes want to tell him 
but I couldn't. He never did want me to know nothin an not tell him. I 
figured if I'd wait till the last minute to tell him, then he'd think I 
knowed all the time. So I sposed to not tell him either way cause I 
didn't want him to think I'd kep it all that time. So I jes stood it anyhow, 
but that was the hardest thing to do. He kep gittin weaker an weaker. 
He wanted me to do fur him all time. He didn't want nobody else to do 
fur him. He kep sayin, "I know you're tired of stayin in this house. Why 
don't you go out sometime an go to the ball-game?" I said, "Naw, I don't 
wanna go." So Naomi an Paul come an stayed wid him one night fur me to go 
to the ball-game. It was a night game. It happened that the game got over

chair. I had laid his pajamas on the bed an tole him when he got ready to 
go to bed. He hadn't never went to bed. The minute I walked in the do he 
jes bloomed up -- so glad to see me. He said, "Now Baby you can put me to 
bed." I said, "Well how come you ain't in bed?" He said, "I din't want 
them to put me to bed. I wanted you to put me to bed." So then I went an 
put him in bed. I said, "Well, I'll never leave you again." I said, "I 
don't care who stay heah an how bad you want me to go I'll never go again." 
I'll stay right heah with you. I'm not goin out the house. The onliest 
time I'll go out the house I'll git Tiny or Sister to come stay wit you 
an I'll run do my shoppin an I'll come back. Outside of that I'll never 
leave you." An he said, "Well, I don't want you to leave either. I jes 
knew you was tired an I wanted you to git out." I say, "I'm not tired. 
I'm not tired. Not one bit." I jes don't know how I made it to lift that
