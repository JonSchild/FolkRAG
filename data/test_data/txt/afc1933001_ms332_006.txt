19 B STEINBERG p. 4

Q: Could you tell us a little bit about conditions in [England] Europe before Hitler
     came so we can get an idea of what not to do - just a general idea of things
     that brought Hitler about?
A: I was very often wondering myself if it is possible to understand what
     brought Hitler about. It [is] was incredible and still is incredible to me.
Q: Isn't there more or less of a regimentation of science?
A: I don't think so. I don't know what. I think mainly miscalculations,
     stupidity and shrewdness on the part of Hitler.
Q: Do you think Hitler runs the masses?
A: I have never seen him nor heard him.
Q: Do you think Hitler was helped by the curtailment of basic freedom?
A: Definitely. He never could have existed if he hadn't done this and that was
     his first step.
Q: What would you recommend that America should do outside of the armament
     to defend Democracy in America?
A: Make it clear to the population of the U.S. what kind of life people in
     Europe do live under the curtailment of freedom.
