Rumor

There is a rumor going around
that they are going to ration
clothes by the first of next month.
With this rumor going around
causes so many people to buy
extra clothes which they do not
need. I saw an article in the
paper last week where a thief
broke in a lady's apartment and
stole one hundred slips and so
many numbers of other kinds of
clothing so you should not pay
attention to all of the rumors
going around because most of
the time you get the worst deal.

Quite some time ago, there was
a rumor going around that they
were going to turn the Rosenwald
building into a hotel for
the soldiers to stay.
