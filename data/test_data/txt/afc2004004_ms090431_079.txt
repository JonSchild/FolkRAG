Fisk, 15. p1 WILL STARK
FORCED [A]LABOR ON THE PLANTATION.
We had to go. These people were helping out of here. If they sent for 
servant of you and a Mr. Clark or a Mr. Hobson or any of these people 
and they wanted some out of town to chop (?) the cotton or plow, it
makes no difference who he was, he must go. They wo ld go into the

-- that fine have got him. Somebody found out and reproted it to the 
government some way or other, that's what I heard about.

S: No sir, that ain't goin on much around here now. It ain't goin
around here not now much. 
The place where  I am now I hear tell a tale about a man wanted one of
