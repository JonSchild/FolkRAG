April 14, 1964

Dear Alan: 

 Jim Smart left on a vacation las week and asked
me to answer your letter of March 31.

According to the Recording Laboratory Work Order,
dated July 7, 1961, the recordings of Texas Gladden and
Hobart Smith were duplicated for you on 4 full track 10"
tapes at  15 ips, at a cost of $60.00, plus $1.80 for packing, 
mailing and insurance. Your check for $61.80 should be sent
to the Recording Laboratory.

Jim also reminded me to again call your attention 
to the Library Administration's recent policy regarding tapes
procured for commercial use and public release: "The Recording
Laboratory is authorized to charge, in addition to the basic
laboratory fee, a surcharge of $150 per hour's playing time
(or proportional charge for less than one hour)." We 
realize that you are trying to help old friends but the Laboratory
must follow instructions.

I hope all is well with you and that your project
is progressing well. With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

(Mrs.) Rae Korson
