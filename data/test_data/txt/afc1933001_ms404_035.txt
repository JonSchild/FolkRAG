Alan could catch only liberal segments
of the two hour long service. Every seven
minutes a disc [plate] must be turned, ever fourteen 
minutes [a new] an [unused] unused one inserted. A crowd
of white guards hang over him as he 
worked, while I superintended the microphone. 

No one responding to Sin Killer's 
plan for repentant sinners to come
forward, the service was generally ended. 
His farewell to his alter men was brief. 
The iron doors clanged, between him and the convicts,
Soon he was standing close by me as Alan 
replayed the evening's recordings [he had just made]. Three 
hundred convicts leaned forward to 
listen- more intently than to the preacher. 
Leaning over with his ear cocked downward to the machine 
the Reverend Sin Killer missed no 
sound. When his [the] last word had passed out
of the loud speaker he turned to me and 
said: "Mr. Lomax, for a long time I've been
hearing that I'm a good preacher. Now I know it."
