TAPE 44...MRS MURRAY? BLANCHE WOOD, and JAMES WISEMAN. 

I'm A Young Bonny Lassie: Blanche Wood:

1) I'm a youjg bonny lasie and my fortune's been bad
Since I fell in love wi' a young sailor lad.
I've ben courted too early by night and by day,
And the lad I lo'e dearly has gone far away. 

2) My friends and relations have all joined in one,
To part me and my love they've done al they can,
To part me and my love they've done their own will,
But the more that they hate him I love him the more still.

3) When I look to yon high hills, it makes my heart sair,
When I look to yon high hills and my lad is nae there,
When I look to yon high hills wi' a tear in my eye,
And the lad I lo'e dearly lies a distance frae me.

Lord Thomas and Fair Eleanor: Mrs Jessie Murray.

1) Fair Ellen has got houses and land,
The Brown Girl hasn't got none.
So, if you take your mother's advice
You would bring the Brown Girl home.

2) He dresed himself in scarley 'ray
All mounted o'er with green.
And every town that he rode through
They thoght he was some king. 

3) "Come ritle-me- title-me, mother," she cried,
Come ritle it all to one.
Shall I go to Lord Thomas's wedding
Or will I stay at home?"

4) Many-a one's been your friend, Fair Ellen,
Many-a one's been your foe. 
But if you take your mother's advice,
To Lord Thomas's wedding don't go."

5) She dressed herself in scarlet 'ray
Al mounted o'er with green.
And every town that she rode through
They thught she was some queen.

6) When she came to Lord Thomas's gates
How loudly she rung the bell,
There were none so ready as Lord Thomas
To welcome Fair Elean in.
