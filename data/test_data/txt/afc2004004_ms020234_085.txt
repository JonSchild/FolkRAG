BJ TAPE 20, p. 82

BJ:  Um-hum. . .An' so, an' at last, one day, ah, I was ill.  Some
where we was, an', I think it was, ah; it's, yes, it was at
Millen.  Um, we done sumpin' or nother an' dis, ah, an' this white
boy -- white man -- he, ar, he opened this jar?  An' ah, he could,
he could open it.  And ah, I tried openin' it.  I said, "You
can't open it; le' me open it."
     He said, "I can open it," said.  An' he opened it.  An' so. . .
Anyhow, I started to say, "Now he near 'bout stronger an' me. . ."
In my mind.  That's a crazy idea!  In my mind, I was thinkin' I was
stronger'n that man.  That was a crazy mind.  You know.  Jus'
'cause he's a white man, I figure he, he's, he's, I was stronger
'an him.  
     An' ah, I used to have a, an act a tellin' on 'em, you know,
anything, when I go. . .They say, "Well, how come I couldn't do
it?  How come I couldn't, couldn't lift that?  How come I
couldn't, um, open that or move that?"  You know, in that way.
"See, you move it like it's nothin', just like that.
     I say, "I don't eat light bread."  Hum, hum, hum.  Ha, ha,
ha!  I says, "I don't eat light bread."  Ha, ha!  I says, "You just
like the wind."  Hah, light bread!  " 'Cause you liable to 
be blowed up side a post anytime."  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  I used to 
tell white mens that.  I said, "You, you know, when light bread --
in the mornin', ya git up eatin' light bread; dinner
time, ya eatin' light bread. . ."  Hah!
     So, I have noticed it, though; hit's true.  You can tell, ah,
white or colored, that the, the, eat strong things, they'll, it
makes 'em strong.  Well, there is some white mens, brother, I'm 
tellin' you, they strong.  But you watch, if he eats, he eats
right food.  He eats boiled food; he eats, ah, right kind a bread,
