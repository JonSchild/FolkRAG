to one's self. A rumor may be told in order 
to increase the prestige of the teller, to entertain 
an audience, to engage another person in conversation.

b. Reassurance and emotional support. Here the 
rumor may be told in the hope that the hearer will 
be able to deny or disprove it. Again, it may be an 
appeal for sympathy. Finally, it may be a way of 
reducing one's own emotional tensions by sharing 
them with another.

c. Projection.  A rumor may be transmitted because 
it "externalizes" fears, wishes and hostilities
having their origins in unperceived or illdefined 
sources.

d. Aggression. The rumor may be transmitted in 
order to injure some third party i.e., slander, 
gossip, etc.

e. Bestow a favor. A rumor may be passed on in 
order to curry favor with or bestow a favor upon 
the hearer.

V. What determines the content of rumors? 

It is characteristic of rumor transmission that it 
shapes, distorts, and selects certain facts and phantasies 
in such a manner as to bring them to a final 
optimal form. The factors determining these changes 
we have called determinants. We have divided them into
three main classes, namely, perceptual, cultural, and 
motivational factors. Under perceptual factors, we 
include the characteristics of "mind in general" which 
limit the accuracy of perceiving and reproducing 
rumors. We may note the following:

a. Quantitative limitations. No rumor may exceed 
in length and complexity the memory span of the 
persons transmitting it. Characteristically, rumors 
are short and simple.

b. Rumors tend to make a "good story." Rumors 
tend to assume a form which makes them most easily 
understood and remembered. This is done in several 
ways, i.e., by introducing humor or striking details, 
by eliminating qualifications and complexities, 
by simplifying the plot and circumstances, 
by introducing familiar persons and situations, and 
by exaggeration.

c. Names, numbers, and places. These are typically 
the most readily distorted parts of any rumor.
