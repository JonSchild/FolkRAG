the devil may he said to have taken possession
of the earth. It even times day and night
through Vindv√©di St. until Christ is well
risen to protect poor shivering men from
evil until the devil is finally beaten.
The major] officials are officials of a real
army setting out with masques and the
rest of the usual primitive paraphanalia
to beat the devil. The majors dance [their]
make their tin jens flash in the air like
so many spears, showing all the world how
agile and how ready to fight the devil
they are.
Of course the whole thing may be colored by
the notion of the rejuvenation of the earth
by the being that dies and is brought to
life again. The only person I have asked
says simply that vava is in honor of
Bar dieu.

Another person I asked this morning said
that the vava bands are interesting in making
the jews run away. The majors with their
batons are prepared to beat them.
