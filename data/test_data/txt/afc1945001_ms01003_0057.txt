[*Rumors*]

June 10, 1942

Mr. Carl W. Vandagrift
Assistant Program Director
Westinghouse Broadcast stations
Fort Wayne, Indiana

Dear Mr. Vandagrift:

For Mr. MacLeish I wish to acknowledge your
note of June 4th, and your description of the rumor being
circulated at the General Electric plant at Fort Wayne.

It is our experience that rumors of this kind
cannot be profitably treated through radio broadcasts
which tend rather to increase the circulation of the
rumor than neutralize it.

The only concrete suggestion we can make to you
toward the refutation of this rumor is to instruct your
staff at Stations WOWO and WOL to combat it personally
by reasonable and logical argument every time they hear 
it and that you suggest it to the personnel people at the
General Electric plant that they do the same.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.
We appreciate hearing from you in the future about
any other similar attempts to undermine the war effort
in your neighborhood, whether these efforts are conscious
or unconscious.

Sincerely yours,

R. Keith Kane
Assistant Director
In Charge, Bureau of
Intelligence
