1) If maidens were sheep and they would lie on the mountains,
    Look how the young men they could go and lay with them,
    Oh sing fal-the-ral loodle, Jack fal-the-ral day.
2) Oh if maidens were blackbirds, they would build in the bushes,
    Look how the young men they could spoil their young nestlings.
3) Oh, if maidens were moorhens they would build in the rushes,
    Look how the young men they could use their short brushes.
4) So it's early one morning young Johnny went creeping
    Right into the bedroom where Polly lay sleeping.
5) My dearest Polly may I come and lay with you?
    She smiled and replied, "I'm afraid you'll undo me."
6) My dearest Polly, I will not undo you.
    She smiled and replied "Then you may come to bed with me."
7) My trousers fit tight, love, I cannot undo them.
    She smiled and replied, "Why don't you take a knife to them?"
8) My knife it won't cut, love, it ain't worth no more than a cinder,
    She smiled and replied, "There's a knife on the window."
9) His mortals fell off him and into bed tumbled,
    I'll leave you to guess how this pretty pair tumbled.
10) Six months had been over and nine months set asunder,
    For the child it was born with two knives on the window.
11) Six months had been over and nine months set asunder,
    For the child it was born with its full regiment number
    On his long fol-the-riddle-i-do (2)
    Hang down to his knee.

lomax: Do you sing this in the pubs with Arthur?
Joe: Oh yes, I've sung it in the pubs. Some people don't like them,
don't like them sort of songs, you know.
Lomax: In the old days they were quite alright to sing anywhere,
weren't they? I mean, in the old dyas, at a country dance, you'd
sing those, would you, with the women present, and nobody minded?
Joe: They didn't used to mind -- and of course, praps they would 
today, like they are.
Lomax: They were more broadminded when you were a young man, were they?
