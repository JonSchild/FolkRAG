Of [couf] course Lead Belly[, as eve] has been much influenced by his
environment, musical as well as social.  He began life, musically
speaking, with the square - dance tunes and plays of the first section of this book,
where the Negro was certainly indebted to the white man , with a few
ballads like Frankie and Albert, The Boll Weevil, , with one or two
blues and a holler, with [one of the or two] a few rag-time tunes that were beginning
to seep back into the country, with [aw s] a work-song or so, [and with]
[a great stock of spirituals and] with "Cajun" dances for the accordion,

His favorite song , we hate to say, is "Silver Haired Daddy,"
