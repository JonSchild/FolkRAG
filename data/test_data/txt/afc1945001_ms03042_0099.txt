III. Heard in New Rochelle, New York on August 12, 1942

It takes a very long time to send troops from the 
United States to Australia. They never send them direct,
but in a roundabout way. When they leave the West Coast,
the ships sometimes cover as much as three or four times the
actual distance, because they zigzag around in different 
directions for hundreds of miles trying to avoid enemy ships.
Now, they are sending troops to Australia by way of New York
City and other Eastern Coast ports. I think they send them
around South America or by way of Cape Horn, Africa. [*1*]
