From THE HOUSTON POST, D CEMBER 20,1939
(Interview with Irvin S.Cobb by Jay Rose)

(EXCERPT()
"He said that he and Mike Hogg had an interesting visit
with John Lomax the other day.  Mr.Lomax is the noted collector of
Southern folk songs.

" 'Lomax and J.Frank Dobie are the two most valuable
citizens in Texas,' he said, 'but the state will probably not realize
that until 60 years after they are dead.'

[*This is just for you.  J*]

"He also had high praise for another Texas writer,-
John Thomason.  Mr.Thomason, he said, is the best portrayer of battle
scenes since Stephen Crane and Ambrose Bierce."
