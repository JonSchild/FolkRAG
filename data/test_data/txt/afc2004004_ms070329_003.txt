Dear Miss Flanders,
The song "John Maynard" which
 Mrs. M.E. Sullivan wished to have is as
 follows:-

John Maynard
(1)
'Twas on Lake Erie's broad expanse,
One bright midsummer day.
The gallant steamer Ocean Queen
Swept proudly on her way.
Bright faces clustered on the deck,
Or leaning o'er the side,
Watched carelessly the feathery foam, 
That flecked the rippling tide.
(2)
Ah, who beneath that cloudless sky,
That smiling bends serene,
Could dream that danger, awful, vast,
Impended o'er the scene â€”
Could dream that ere an hour had sped,
That frame of sturdy oak
Would sink beneath the lake's blue waves
Blacked with fire and smoke.
