THE SOUTH TODAY

But Southern folk melodies have not sprung chiefly from any of
the sources mentioned.  In the creation of folk-songs, the white man
and the brown must yield the palm to their brother in black.  It is
the Negro--ashamed through his teachers and preachers and the half-
educated class may be of this output of the black race--who has created
the best of the folk songs and folk music of the South.  Yet save for 
the "spirituals" (pure folk songs in themselves), little attention has

The strength and power and the beauty of the spirituals have been 
acknowledged by thousands of audiences, who have listened to them in
"The Green Pastures" and in the open, "Porgy and Bess."  Now Roark
Bradford of New Orleans is writing the lyrics for an opera already
accepted for presentation at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York

words, the music, are all based on the Negro version of the tragic
and moving story of John Henry, the steel-driving man.

movement of the songs must be slow and tortuous like the movement of
the mules.
