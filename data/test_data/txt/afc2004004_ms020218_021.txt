the stile. You know, they had, used to have a fence. An'
they had those steps come across that fence? Mama an' Leo was comin'
ov' that fence. An' she didn' pay the dog no mind barkin'.
I seed Mama. An' [she] see, she didn't see it. I b[r]ayed it out!
I said "Huh-huh!" [She say, "] "I tell you, what's the matter?" Say, "You
gonna take that stuff!" That time Mama heard 'er,  you see?
Didn't know what it was, but Mama was runnin' in the house.
Mama say, "What's the matter with you, gal?" She'd heard her.
Mama say, "What's the matter with you, gal?" An' Betty was
struck. 'Cause Mama was in the do'. It was five miles from
where I stayed. Sumpin' jus' didn' let Mama--Mama said she
couldn't sleep all night. An' so she told Leo, "Le's go [out] in
there an', you know, he'p Betty start 'er with the quilts, or
see 'bout it. Jus' see how she gettin' on or sumpin' ." You 
see? An' that what it was. God wasn't inten' her to kill me
an' that chile.
AL:     What did your mother day and do? What happened then?
My God.
BJ:     Well, she called ['er] outdoors an' talk with 'er. Betty
go...I seen Betty shakin' her hand and talkin' to her. An' I heard
[then] Mama say, "Well, I brought her here--" in the, in the worl'.
"An what she 'gets, she gonna bring in the worl'." An' Mama
come in the house an' say, "Git your clo's, Bess; le's go home."
See, she never have call me Bessie. My name's Elizabeth an'
she call me Bess. (That [why] why - the white) folks call me
Bessie. Say, "Git your clo's; le's go home." An' Mama really 
was mad. She was jus' too mad. An' so, an' I just got my
clo's an' went on back. An' left the m'cin sittin' right there.
One by the winda where she was standin'; one sittin' on the 
table...an' Lor' he'p [me] me, I seen the judgment.[-?-] I got
home...I used to wear them white underskirts with big lace
around it,  you know at the tail. I got on home; walk on home; I went around
the house; and ah around the house an' made water, an' when
I did like that I looked on the underskirts and saw it. An'
Leo called Mama. Imagine how I felt. An' Mama said, "She
better not get sick." That what Mama said when I walked in the house.
An' she said, "If she do, she goin' a' jail," said.
Said, "Either I kill 'er." She was talkin' about Betty, y'know.
