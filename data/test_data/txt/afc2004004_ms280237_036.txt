2) So as these sad tidings the old miser did hear,
All on this young sailor he cursing would swear,
Saying, "No more will that young man go plough the sal t sea,
And before tomorrow morning his butcher I'll be."

3) Soon as this pretty fair maid heard her father say so,
She filled her eyes with tears and her heart full of woe,
I wish you were near me, my own Willy dear,
O how quickly I would warn you of the dangers that's near.

4) So she dressed herself up so rare and complete,
For she was determined her Willy to meet,
She had pumps on her feet, and a cane in her hand,
And she met her dearest Willy as she walked down the strand.

5) O Willy, O Willy, from this place you must flee,
For my father he's intending your butcher to be.
Go quickly to Dover, I will have you go there,
In less than eight and forty hours I will meet you there.

6) Then up spoke this pretty maid with a tear in her eye,
Saying, "I will have you or else I will die."
Straightaway she then gave him two handfuls of gold,
And walked down the strand like some young sailor bold.

7) As this pretty fair maid walked along down the strand,
She met her own father saying, "You are that man."
A sword from his side then he instantly drew,
And into his body pierced it quite through.

8) Soon as this old miser saw what he had done,
He tore off his hair and his fingers he wrung,
Saying "Wretched cruel monster, what have I now done?
I have killed my only daughter, she is the flower of London."

9) And then this old miser, he took it so hard,
He leaned on his sword till it pierced through his heart,
"Forgive me," he cried, as he drew his last breath,
And then closed his eyes in the cold hands of death.

10) Soon as this young sailor heard of this affair,
He came quickly to Dover and died in despair,
There was father and daughter and this young sailor bold,
All died an untimely death for the sake of bright gold.
