Dear Dr. Botkin: -
You were very kind to have written as you did
about the Writer's Project material. I hardly felt that it could
Mr. Lomax generous offer, I saw no other way out. Thank you so
much for all the trouble.
Todays letter from Mr. Lomax convinces me that I was right
on still another count, as Harpers,Atlantinc and New Yorker had
returned the recent story of mine which he'd sent them. He writes:
"They're wrong and I'm right". Bless his loyal old heart! I realy
have nothing that's important to say, but because he`s all for
the Southern negro, and because of the climate of sympathy in
which my efforts are drenched he mistakes it for good writting.
Iam sorry for him to worry with it but he`s not only kind but
determined and so I have to agree.
Doc Reed and Vera Hall have just brought me their checks
to have cashed for them. Doc can neither read nor sign his name
and he either hasn't confidence in the people on whose place he
lives, or he owes them and wants his money for other purposes.
I ask no questions but sign for him with some other witness and
send him away rejoicing. Today he has $12.50 and Vera $2.50 and
they are both very happy, and ask that I thank you.
I appreciated the message from Mr. Seigmeister. He sent me
a collection of his ballads. I wrote in care of this publisher and
have often wondered if he got my letter.
May I trouble you again to send me Mr. Lomax letter. I like
to keep them.
Many thanks for your kindness. I shall look forward to seeing
you again some day when things have gotten back to normalcy.
Very sincerely,

Riley [ ] Tartt
