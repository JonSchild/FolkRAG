Civics  2nd 

[*a*] 

A private had just finished placing some flowers
on the Colonel's desk when a Lieutenant came up 
to him and shouted "who told you to put those
flowers there?"  The private meekly replied, "the
Colonel did, Sir."  The Lieutenant smiled weakly and
said, "pretty, aren't they?" 

A Lieutenant came up to a poorly clad Private
and shouted, "look at your suit, your a disgrace
wearing it!"  The Private stunningly replied,
"I don't like it either Sir, I wish I had one
like yours."
