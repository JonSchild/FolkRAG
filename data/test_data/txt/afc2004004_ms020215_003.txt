[*HIDDEN MEANING OF "BUZZARD LOPE"*]

AL:   Ah, how do you say things with song?
BJ:    How do you say things with song?
AL:   Well, you remember you were telling me about how you can say
things in song that you can't say.
BJ:    Oh, of co'se, tha's right.  How, how people does, ah, does
say things through songs that, ah, [that] they want to say, but they,
you know, they talk what they say through a song.  So that's what
I was tellin' you b'fore.  Like that "Ol' Fiel'," ya know that
I was tellin' you about?  Say, "Throw me anywhere," that's
from the Buzzard Lope?  An' it says, "Throw me anywhere in that
old field," because they knew that was what they were gonna do
with 'em, you know, when they died.  They jes', you know, they
didn' bury people as good as they do now, of course.
AL:    Bury who?
BJ:    The slaves, of course, you know.  An' um, jus' fix 'em up an'
carry 'em out an' throw 'em in the ol' field.  Tha's what they
called it, ya know, 'cause they didn't figure that they was um, 
they didn't call it the graveyard, an' so they jus' tellin' 'em, tell 'em
they didn't care how they do 'em, jus' so Jesus loved 'em.  See?
So this where the"Buz' Lope" come in there.
AL:   What about Jesus, ah, in the field?
BJ:    Well, Jesus, he was buried in the field of Golgotha, ya see?
An' tha's why they called it th' "old field," ya see.  Jesus was
buried in the Field of Golgotha.  An' ah, tha's, ah , you'll find
that in the Bible there, where he was buried out in the Field of
Golgotha.  An' Tha's why the old peoples called it the "old field,"
until they come up in the more different things, would call it
different things.
