Broadcasting House,
London, W.1.

Dear Lomax,

We have been listening to your last series of broadcasts on the third with great interest, and remembering that it was your programmes in Spain several years ago that set us off on folk music recording.

We wondered also if you might be able to spare time to come along and give a lecutre, or a series of lectures, at our Coffee House.  I am enclosing a copy of last winter's programme to give you some idea of the scope of our work.  Our audience is by no means a local one, but comes from all over London.  Each talk or recital lasts approximately an hour, and they are at 4.30 p.m. on Sunday afternoons, and 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday evenings.

Unfortunately our lecture room is very small, (it is simply a large drawing-room) and because of a limited audience we are only in a position to offer a nominal three guineas per lecture to cover expenses.

I know that you are extremely busy but if you should have time, and are interested, it would be a very great pleasure to have you along.  Perhaps you could give me a ring at the Coffee House some morning between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m..

Yours sincerely,
[signed]
D.J. McAuley.
DJM/JEB.

P.S. I should have mentioned that our next programme will commence on approximately Sunday, 3rd February, and should go on until the end of March, so that from the point of view of publicity we shall have to have our programme fixed in a little over a week from now.
