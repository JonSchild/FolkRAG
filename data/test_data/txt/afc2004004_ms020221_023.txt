That was a good time, ya hear? Wooo, gee! Yeah, that was a good 
time! Them folks was there. Looked like it, it... all the folks
jus' left -- Sister Phillips, one woman, an' two men.

An' here how I come through: I come through between three
churches. Ya see? Sister Phillips was Church of God in Christ,
