Boothe Merrill, a college friend,
first gave me the dance song,
Old Saint, in Cheyenne, Wyoming
 on [*the*] July fourth, 1910.
We were both studying the great
Frontier Day Celebration held each
[*year*] summer in Cheyenne.  We
met unexpectedly and joyously
one night as we faced each
other in the entrance of a
noisy saloon.  Boothe was going
out one swinging door, I
going in through the other.  We grasped hands
and chanted together the
last [*line*] verse of our old college song:
"The eyes of Texas are upon you till
Gabriel blows his horn."
