Roll 60 Stan and Hattie 3

(Stan) wet it -- it has to be soaked overnight so it'll be soft. And then,
this piece is off of the banjo, so you put the hide in there...that's never (?)
hook and then there's a metal hook, And you push your hide thru and your wire
goes in this piece right here, so the hide can't come on just so far, Then,
when it dries out good...they always said, "get 'em as tight as a banjo hide"
...you had to have it real tight. And I'm gonna try to play "Ground Hog" on it..

AL: Tell us all about the ground hog, how the folks used to eat 'em and (...)

Stan: I eat 'em myself, they're real good meat. they're about like beef...but
f they've got kernels under the front legs and you have to cut them out. If you
don't they will taste strong. But the old people that eat possums and
ground hogs -- they wouldn't eat a possum till they put it up and kept it
awhile, as much as a couple of weeks and fed it milk and bread, because they
eat everything they could find, you know. And coons is very good meat, awful
good meat. My grandpa and the other fellow he hunted with, they'd sell a coon
for 50c at a little old cafe. This old man couldn't get none, he had a little
old fast dog. It was about blind, and old and all and it couldn't do nuttin'
more, so he just killed the dog and dressed it out and to it to the cafe.
And him and my grandpa would buy it there to get somethin' to eat, and this
man ordered a coon. He said to the waiter, "that's the best coon I ever ate
in my life!" She said, "Well, it's that old big fat coon you've got." ANd
him and my grandpa went out behind the house and he said "Drum! Drum, I've
called you a many times and you've never come. God bless you for comin' this
time!" and run his hands down his throat and puked the dog up. And it's good
to...like that now, so I'll play you "Ground Hog."
