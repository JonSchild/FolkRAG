or more will it be possible for me to make 
or to have made, copies of about 
150 songs from the records we have 
turned in so I can use these
copies in transcribing the music
for a second book of Ballads?
1. This plan would enable 
me to go abroad with this job
completed. 
2. I should have no further 
claim for prior [?] of the 
records; hence, you could 
turn the public loose on 
them so far as I am 
concerned. 
3. Whatever expense the Library 
thinks I should bear in getting
these copies I should assume 
without demur.
4. This matter is of first 
rate importance to me
