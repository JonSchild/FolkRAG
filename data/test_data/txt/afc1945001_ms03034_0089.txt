Rumors

I talked to Knapp, Allport's assistant in Boston, on Saturday, preferring Knapp to Allport because of his Massachusetts state listening post apparatus.

Knapp said he thought he would be able, through the Bartenders' Union, to bring together twenty or thirty bartenders on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday night, and get out of them the answers to:-

1. What subjects do people talk about which they shouldn't talk about in the interests of the war effort?

2. Within their own categories above, what recent specific bits of information have they heard which they shouldn't have heard?

Knapp understands that if this information is to be of any use to us, it must be in our hands by Friday morning.
