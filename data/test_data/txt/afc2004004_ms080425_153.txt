#246    Tape:   Sacred Harp     6

Chester:    Beautiful, beautiful.  They don't sing exactly like 
we do all the time.  They got mixed up or maybe some of them 
will join inlater. . .

AL:    How about when they're singing their own songs, how 
does that impress you?

Chester:    It's good.  I love to hear them sing.

AL:    You think Sacred Harp sounds as good as what they do?

Chester:    Well, I think SH is the best.   SH is the best to me. 
There's a lot of people can beat me in singing, but not a 
whole lot of people who can beat me in loving it.    . . . . . .
