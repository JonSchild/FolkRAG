War and Rumors
Rumors always arise furing periods of tension; and war creates
new tensions and increases the normal tensions in an community. Rumors
apread during wartime because people are under special emotional strains.
To any community, War means military news, losses in battle,
drains on manpower, shifts in production, the influx of strangers (workers
or soldiers), dislocations in family life, heavy taxes, abrupt adjusements
to shortages, rationing, changes in transportation, etc., etc. In adjusting
to these strains and stresses, people are predisposed to repeat and
listen to rumors.
The uneasiness and anxiety which is inevitable during war can
best be eased by a continuous flow of news about the war and all of its
aspects. The antidote to most rumors is information -- clear, complete,
honest news.
But even the most complete and accurate information about the
war, with its multitude of details, cannot prevent rumors from springing
up. For war sharpens public interest, and focuses public attention upon
problems about which full information cannot always be given promptly,
or upon situations so complex that even the publication of all of the
known facts does not provide simple, reassuring explanations. War itself
fosters the conditions in which rumors flourish.
