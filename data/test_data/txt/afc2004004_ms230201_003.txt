             Good mornin', little schoolgirl,
             Can I go home wid you?
             Can I go home wid you?
             You can tell your mama and your papa
             That I'm a little school-boy, too.

So her parents thought I wasn' the right boy for her,
you understand, an' so they turnt me down an' then I just
got to sittin' down thinkin' and then I thought of that
song an' I started to drinkin',..and so that give me the
blues and I started. 

Nat chez  Bill]:  
Well, now what do you think about the blues, Kid?

The Kid:
The blues have hope me a lot. when I have [the]
trouble, the blues the onliest thing that helps
me.  That's the onliest way to ease my situation,
when I have trouble 'bout the rent and so forth
and so on like that. 

Nat chez:  
[Bill] Well, what about places you didn't have to pay no
rent like the plantation?

The Kid:  
I still had [s?] troubles, I mean women troubles.

Natchez: 
[Bill] Well, the thing I think about the blues is--- it
start in the North,-in Chicago, New York,
Pennsylvania.  It didn't start in the Eastm neither
in the North.  It started from the South. 

The Kid:  
Yeah, it started from slavery, what I'm thinkin'.
[Natchez] But[xx] you agree with me that the blues helps a 
man out?

Natchez:  
Yeah, for the feeling'...[I] you feel much better...
