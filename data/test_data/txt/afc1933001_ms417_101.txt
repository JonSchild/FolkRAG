A TOAST TO AN OIL BOOM TOWN
Here's to old Pampa, Texas, where th' north wind blows, Got th/ fu------est women that ever wore clothes Where th' Oil Boom's over, and th' wheat's blowed out, But the c--k minded people still wander about, Where the big new sheriff with his laws, by god, Puts the E X gamblers to tillin' th' sod, Now if you come here from Oklahoma to try to get rich, You better leave Pampa, Texas, you son of a bitch. By My dear sweet brother in Law A. J=, in whose company a many a time I have heard some mighty purty music on a set of rusty springs, and woke up next morning with one foot in the slop jar and the other one in the dresser drawer.
Whim, whim, and the mule throwed Tony!
