Conversation heard on a bus:

"Russia is going to fall within the next 60 days the way 
things are going; the reason is that we don't have enough ships to 
get her the equipment and supplies which she must have in time to 
do her any good. This German submarine menace has been more successful 
than people realize. The Axis are sinking our ships faster than we 
can make them. It wouldn't surprise me if Russia would make a 
negotiated peace with Germany pretty soon because she has just 
about come to the end of her rope." [*Denver, Colo. 8-6-42     24*]
