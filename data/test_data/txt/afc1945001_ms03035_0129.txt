                    RE: Rumors

             While listening in on a conversation, by a group of men in 
the vicinity of 3rd and Fort St. I heard them discussingsa subject 
pertaining to the ARMED FORCES of today. This subject involves a
situation which arose during WORLD WAR #1. These men stated, that the 
soldiers of today are very much interested in preventing this condition 
from arising again.

[*Patrolmen B.*]

             1.   As I was patroling my beat, a young men well dressed about 
29yrs. of age, 5ft. 9in. tall and weighing about 160lbs. stopped me and 
asked me for information regarding a street d number. While in conversation 
with this ma, he expressed that [*the*] opinion people were 
not accepting the war serious enough. The press in his opinion was not 
endeavoring to print the true facts about war production, and also 
stating he had heard, of a large Aircraft factory which was suppose to 
have airplanes on production, but has not completed one that will pass 
government specification.
