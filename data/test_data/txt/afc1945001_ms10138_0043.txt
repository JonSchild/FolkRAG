What I hear, and what people talk about, 
concerning the war, doesn't interest me.  
The only thing that matters is: I wish the 
war hadn't started, but since it is started, 
I wish it will be over soon, so that 
my two brothers can come home safe.  

It is very crazy to try to find out what 
people think about the war; because 
what they think doesn't matter.
