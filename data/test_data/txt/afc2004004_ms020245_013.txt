The world can't do me no harm.

Oh, some said John the Baptist
Was nothin' but a Jew,
But the holy Bible teaches me
That John was a preacher, too.

John had religion,       )

Noah got religion, etc.

I'm proving my religion, etc.

Well, you may talk about me
And scandalize my name,
But since I know my soul is saved,
I'm certainly not ashamed.

This is a good religion, etc.

Oh, watch the secret-keeper,
That one that bring you news,
He'll come in your house and bring you news,
And keep you all confused.

This is a good religion, etc.

I would not be a deceiver,
I'll tell you the reason why,
I know my Lord gonna call me,
I'won't be ready to die.

I'm proving my religion, etc.

I know I got religion, etc.

Oh, you may 'buke and [stun] scorn me
And scandalize my name
But I'm goin' down on bended knees
And pray just the same.

I know I got religion, etc.

This is good religion, etc.
