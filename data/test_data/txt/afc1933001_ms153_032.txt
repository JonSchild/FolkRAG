Division of Music
January 16, 1940
I recommend that the position of Mr. Alan Lomax be
reallocated to P2 ($2600). He has for at least a year
and a half served as Assistant in Charge of the American
Folk-Song, a unit in the Music Division. His
present duties include the following.
1. The preparation and carrying out of recording
expeditions for the Archive, a task requiring a very
specialized knowledge of American folk-poetry and folkmusic 
as well as of American culture in general.
2. General reference work in the field of American
folk-lore in the form of correspondence and personal consultation.
3. The care of the Archive collection and catalogs.
