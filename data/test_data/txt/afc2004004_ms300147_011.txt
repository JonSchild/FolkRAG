Dear Bob:

As we discussed, I would like to suggest to you that the following
changes be made in the proposed agreement with Alan Lomax.
      (1) Concert appearances made by Mr. Lomax, as
            opposed to lectures, should be specifically
            set forth as being outside the scope of the
            agreement;

     (2) I believe that there should be at least 120 days'
          notice prior to December 31, 1961, of any desire
          you have to extend the agreement beyond that
         date, and I believe a reasonable minimum
         earning figure should be established which would
         make the optional right you have void, unless
         Lomax had earned at least the minimal amount
         prior to expiration of the initial term;

     (3) Although I believe it is implicit, is it possible
          to have a "best efforts" clause inserted?

     (4) With respect to paragraph 3 of the contract, I
          would like to see the word "reasonable"
          inserted before the word "opinion" in the
          fourth line;

     (5) With respect to paragraph 5, all costs incurred
          should be subject to the prior approval of Lomax;

    (6) With respect to paragraph 7, please provide 
          that statements and payments are made to NRB
          Associates, Ltd., as agents for Mr. Lomax; as
          we discussed, I would also like to see in this
          paragraph some statement to the effect that
