more swimming pools, things began to
pick up.  Then Came the Steel Workers
who looked like steel workers.  All
shapes. Worn bits of people. And
big hunks of slag & wives & children
Filling the street.  Very serious.  Then
applause & the whole square was
suddenly filled with berbers, crinkly
haired brownskined & poor - all men
And they meant business.  They
wanted independence & the right to
work & learn trade & have a family
they weren't kidding.  After that
a thousand banners floated in the
dusty hot air as [all] the [delega]
delegations of all the workers
of France followed in support of
the aspirations of their African
brothers.
