by the missionary priests before the '49ers came there.

COPPER O'FIFE
The New England Scotch sing of the poor copper who had promised never to beat his
gentle wife. But when she refused to cook for him because work was beneath her,
the wily Scot wrapped a sheepskin around her and beat that. She cooked.

SCHLOF BOBBELI

Harrisburg.

This Irish-American vaudeville song, popular since the '60's, tells of the poor hod-
carrier who loved the bottle so that he fell off his ladder and was killed. At the
wake, his friends mourned him in so lively a fashion, that a whiskey bottle fell on
Tim's head. The lovely aroma revived him.
