A rumor brought to the attention of this office by civilian
and military personnel at Lowry Field, as well as members of our 
local police department, is to the effect that Japanese families
recently evacuated from California are living within a mile of
Lowry Field. Because the Government has taken such precautions to
guard Lowry Field it is considered strange that they would permit
Japanese evacuees to locate in the vicinity of this military
area. (This rumor heard frequently for the past few months.)
