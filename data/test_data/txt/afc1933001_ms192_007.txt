*LIBERTY SHIP WHISTLE*
SUNG TO THE TUNE OF "THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL"

WE GET UP IN THE MORNING, STAND ALERT AT SIZ
AND IF YOU'RE NOT THERE, MAN, YOU'RE IN A HELL OF A FIX!
THEY'LL DROP BOMBS ONUS, AND TIME FISH, TOO,
ALL THAT KEEPS THEM BACK, BOYS, IS THE ARMED GUARD CREW!

C  LET THAT LIBERTY SHIP VISTORY
H  BLOW HER WHISTLE FOR ME!
O  LET THAT LIBERTY SHIP VICTORY
R  BLOW HER WHISTLE FOR ME!
U
S

WE MARCH DOW TO THE CHOW HALL, EAT CHOW AT EIGHT, 
STAND UP FOR INSPECTION. START CHIPPING THAT PAINT
IT'S CHIPPING AND PAINTING, PUTTIN'IN OVERTIME
IT'S OVERTIME WORK, MAN, WITHOUT AN EXTRA DIME.

WE MAN OUR GUNS, YES, WE SHINE 'EM UP RIGHT
MAKE SURE THEY'RE READY IF THE DEVIL'S IN SIGHT:
WE'LL THROW SO MANY BULLETS, SO FAST AND STRONG, 
PUT 'EM IN DAVY JONES' LOCKER, WHERE THEY BELONG.

THE MARINES AND THE NAVY AR A SEA GOING CREW;
YOU GIVE US THE STUFF, FOLKS, WE'LL TAKE IT THROUGH!
THROUGH STORMY WEATHER, THROUGH ICE AND SNOW, 
WE'RE SEA GOING DEVILS, I WANT YOU TO KNOW!

SO PASS THE AMMUNITION! SEE WHAT WE CAN DO!
WE'RE FIGHTING DEVILS, OF THE ARMED GUARD CREW!
WE'RE READY AND WAITING FOR THE RISING SUN, 
WE'LL SAIL BACK HOME, FOLKS, WHEN THE BATTLE IS WON!

SO REMEMBER THIS STORY, IF IT DON'T RHYME RIGHT, 
FOR IT WAS WRITTEN ON A STORMY NIGHT!
THE WIND IS BLOWING, RAIN FALLING, TOO,
OUT ON THE WILD ATLANTIC WITH THE ARMED GUARD CREW!
