Well the girls would start: "Play me something, there, boy, play me some blues."

They would start playing in this way: (Piano) - (slow, sentimental, sleep)

I could sit right here, think a thousand miles away,
Sit right here, think a thousand miles away,
Since I had the blues this bad, cannot remember the day

Tell me, baby, what you got on your mind,
Tell me, baby, what you got on your mind,
I'm eating and drinking, having a lovely time.

Let me be your wiggler till your wobbler comes,
Let me be your wiggler till your wobbler comes,
You tell your wobbler what your wiggler done.

I never believe in having one woman at a time,
Repeat.
I always have six, seven, eight or nine.

She said, "Babe, oh Ba-ha-by, (Babe o ba-ha-by,
You're about to set your sweet papa crazy.

Sometimes they'd have good-looking women of all kinds, beautiful women. Some was ugly, very ugly. Some looked like they had lips, look like bumpers on a box car. I'm telling you they had all kinds of men, dressed-up, rags, rags looked like ribbons on some of them. Some of them with big guns in their bosoms. It was a law in New Orleans that any one could carry a gun if they'd want to - almost. Of course there was just a ten-dollar fine, so it didn't make a very much difference.  And if they found you ten dollars, why your sentence would be 30 days in jail, and possibly they'd put you in the market, to clean up the market in the morning. And most of the prisoners would always run away.
