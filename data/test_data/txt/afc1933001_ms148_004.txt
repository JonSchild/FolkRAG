FREDERICK REAMY BELLMAR GLEN ARBOR MICHIGAN

When diamonds chance to crown the deck, 
'Tis then man play for gold.
And heavy sums are lost and won
By gamblers young and old.

When clubs are trumps we play for war
On sea or on the land
And horrid deeds are often done
When clubs are in the hand.

The last trump of all we turn up is a spade 
Which is ruled by the hand of time. 
It finishes up this game of life
Through (in) every land and clime.

No matter how much a man may loose,
No matter how much he save,
He'll find the spade turns up at last
To dig the gambler's grave.

The fragment of the other one which I'll try to complete for
you, is as follows,-only what I can remember:
I wish I were a scholar,
And could write some find hand,
I'd send my love a letter
Which she could understand.
I'd send it o'er the waters
Where islands o'erflow ----------
