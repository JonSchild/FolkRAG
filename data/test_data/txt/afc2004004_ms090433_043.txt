been recording, like Mr. Merriwell up in Chicago sent to him of em.

(end of section)

They'd get them and they'd record, they'd play blues for em.  They didn't know that old melody.

A:  How would he contact them down in Memphis?

E:  Well, he'd have some boys write up talent for him, you see.  Now he got a boy in Saint Louis, he write talent for him.  I don't know anything about writing talent here, but I think that someone in Memphis write up talent for him; I know they do.  The man living here would book them out and have them on the road.

A:  Would these musicians that you know make pretty good money?

E:  They used to make good.

A:  What kind did they make?

E:  Well, when they recording there, they got $25 a side for a record, that's $50 a record.  But now they be $7.50 a side, $15 a record.

A:  That's all you get?  What about the royalties?

E:  Well, they won't give no royalties now, not unless you're blind or afflicted; they don't give no royalties.

A:  Why is that?

E:  I don't know.  The records just got cheap; they cut from $25 a side to $7.50 a side -- that they just cut em out; they cut the royalties off.  But still they want you to record; there must be something in it.  They wouldn't want you all the time if they didn't want you to record.

A:  Well, what about the songs?  Who owns the songs when you get together and record it?  Do they put your name on it?

E:  They put your name on it.  You never sing the song unless your record, not about music, you see.

A:  Outside of records, how would these midgets and characters that you talked about make their living?
