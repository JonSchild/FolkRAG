counties of West Virginia). In the regions directly to
the east of the ones familiar to me, there should be a
good deal of folksong still surviving--I make a guess at
this, based on the experiences I've had in the corner of
the state, since I've never made a trip into this easterly 
territory--and I believe the same could be said for the
country northwest of Pittsburgh. In the latter part, I
have heard of singers and songs, but have never got to
collect anything but a few dance-tunes.

    Have you made, or do you contemplate making, any trips
into West Virginia? In view of what I've found in a few
neighborhoods of three West Virginia counties bordering on Pennsylvania,
I think the statement made by Miss Karpeles in her introduction 
to the Sharp Appalachian collection (that that
state did not seem to be a good field for research) is ridiculous. 
Some of my best stuff has come from the Virginia 
side of the Mason-Dixon line, and surely there must be
great amounts of it in the remoter parts of the state. The
same amounts, and the same sort of old traditional lore
may be available in many parts of Pennsylvania yet, I believe--
that is why I am glad you are thinking of making
a trip into the state!-- but I hope that you, or some other 
expeditionaries may get a chance to do some exploring
in West Virginia.

    This sounds, when I read it over, as though I wanted
to "sidetrack" you from entering the territory where I've
been collecting. That is not true, however; I simply do
not know, now that so many of the singers with whom I was
acquainted --(and the best singers, at that)--have died,
