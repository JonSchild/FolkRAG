â€¦ All I know, one day they tole us he was comin. My father had
sent someone to tell him to come down an play for us. He loved music.
I just wanted to see him. He came an played for hours. He sat on the
porch an played and played. We had a big house an a big, big place
covered with Bermuda grass. Thass why we had so many children from
all the neighborhood. They come an played ball an everything. Thass
all you'd see from the porch -- that an an the[p]x pond. Big pond where the
cows drank at. We was close to the woods then where we could play in
the shade. I was six years ole. After he come that time I just couldn't
wait till he got back again.
How long was it before he came again?
Oh. Bout a mont or two.
How old was Huddie at that time?
He was married.
He was a grown man and you were just a little girl six years old. Do
you think you fell in love with him, Martha?
I did. I'm sho. (she laughs) I never did know until I got big. I jes
wanted to see him. You know, jes crazy to see him. But I didn't know
what it was or what it was like. I didn't know whether it was the music
or what. But after I got grown I knew it wasn't the music. I knew then
I was jes crazy about him. But time come for him to play I jis I didn't
want a chile to [tech]xxxxx tetch me. I didn't want em to bother me. I jes
wanted to see him. I'd stand right where I could see him -- look in his
face. I stayed right there [u]x till the time came for him to go.
