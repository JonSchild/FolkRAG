The coal just - the material just didn't leave
town, ah, the people had jobs for the
processing of what it was that they produced
there.  And so, ah, in the eastern mountains
where mill conditions, where therewere mills
and industries rather than coalmines, ah, you
get a - quite a different picture than in, in
the coalmining area of Virginia, West Virginia
and Kentucky.  And there nowadays,  now that
there's the unionists come in and normalised
ah conditions a bit, there's a real flowering
of all kinds of mountain culture that we're
seeing in these ah, these ah episodes of film
that we've taken.
[*17.09.06.00*]  Ah. . .one of the things that's bothering the
people most there, however, is the buying up
of ah, of the land, and, and pushing the people
off their own, out of their own forests and 
off of their own terrain.  The government buys
up land for public parks, doesn't leave the
people on it, insists that it's more important
for the - that the land be used for
recreation for the people from the hot
lowlands than ah for the living of the people
who inhabit it.
