Dear Bill:

     I hope you have not seen the horrible picture in the
leaflet that Columbia Artist s Bureau have got out. I have
asked them to withdraw the monstrocity from circulation, but
in the meantime, have mailed them a number of not too unpleasant
photographs of my map. I wish you'd have the publicity 
department substitute one of these for the sweetness and light
pictures they used last year. I'd like to begin thinking about
scripts and could think much better if I had a copy of the
Manual.

     See you in New York next week.

Best regards,


Alan Lomax
