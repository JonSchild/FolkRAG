boss over your brothers
A man [who] was not
a citizen who was 
not a Nioh [m]  - 
You sing on all occasions
at work & everywhere
If you don't plow
I'll sell you to the butcher

A young man wd have 
a special song that no
one but his beloved wd understand -
If a song is not
pat. or heroic, it wd
be a love song - the
girl always comes in -
Special or songs fore
every part of the year
best man is always godfather
of the children -
