exploitation of your unique material -

I am giving you my work address & number - because IL is where I spend most [time] plus radio - (until I can afford to return to Macedonia & Africa for musical purposes)

Yours sincerely,

(Lady) Loina S[??] Browne -

P.S. Incidentally, & in care you are interested - I have got a recording on paper, made last year of some nice Sudanic Kora (lyre) playing which ties up with what you alluded to, in your first programme of the style of banjo playing in the Apalachians -
This recording was made during the first visit, last year before they became sophisticated [??] the French West african Troupe - if you would like this recording together with the (people's own') ethnographical comments you would be welcome to a copy -
