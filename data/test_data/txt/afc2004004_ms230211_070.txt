musicians about who are in fine form.
            Such was the group Cadallo brought to my house for
the evening.  I brought together another such group to
accompany the Tiger (T.178-180).  Errol Hill used a larger
orchestra of this kind on his Independence Day programme at
Queen's Hall.  To my mind their music is the equal of
anything in this hemisphere for fire, originality and charm.
T.42.3 Castillian
Flute too close on orig. Levels on the bottom track vary
badly.  End too abrupt.  Nonetheless a very exciting piece.
4 Paseo - The levels go all over the place - because of the
problem of the flute.  I hadnt found out the fiddle yet.
There is also one spot when someone hit the controls and
ruined everything - which will have to be cut out.
Nonetheless,  perhaps because of the spontaneity of the
set-up and [the ?????????tiality] of the miking makes this the best piece in the
whole collection.  It will have to be barbered but it will
make a great side.  Best +++
42.5 Castillian - Fine!!
Wary levels - but can be made great.
6  Gallevon - all flute - a bit monotonous, but a nice record.
7  Paseo - The best balanced record.  Moses, the fiddler, came
in to his own here.
8  Interview: Nothing much.
9 Warrap - Sung by Guerra, with orch.  Real folk song, for
cross wake, weird, but not a very good recording.  To play
