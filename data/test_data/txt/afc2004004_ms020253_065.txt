BJ:  It's a sin.  It sho' is.  If you cut it off -- this is diffrunt --
I have cut mine, but it's a sin.  I ain't cut it since I knowed
better, but I have, I sho' have cut it.  'Cause I used to wear it
in the boyish bob, they called it.  You know?
TL:  Oh, did you?
BJ:  Um-hum.
TL:  Did you like it that way?
BJ:  Yeah, I liked it.
TL:  Remember the other day, when I walked in and you were straightening
your hair?  When did they start using those combs?
BJ:  Oh, I don't know.  Years ago, when they first started bringin'
them out.  Around 1916.  Around there.
TL:  Oh, yeah?  Then always as long as you remember people
wanted to straighten their hair out, huh?
BJ:  Well, some of 'em does an' some don't.  Some wouldn't touch it.
TL:  Some like it better?
BJ:  Some like it better that way?

hair.  God jus' ain't pleasin' 'em.  Ha, ha, ha!  Everytime the
white folks' hair is curly, they run them same hot combs
through their hair an' get it good an' straight, then they curl
it.  Boy, it's pretty then, too.  They take it down; it's really
curly.  They got -- it's a difference -- I see the white peoples
tryin' to get curly hair; the colored folks already got curly
hair.  You see?  An' then they, they try to get theirs 'un
straight.  An' tha's jus', God jus' ain't pleasin' em, tha's all it look like
