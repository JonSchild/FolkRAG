Anecdotes

   There was once a man and
his wife both died about the same
time.  They were now in front of
Saint Peter in Heaven. 
Wife: My husband hasn't been
very good in his life, but I have
been the best I think you
should let him into Heaven
on some of my goodness.  Then
she found things wrong with
heaven.  She told Saint Peter
where she thought some of
the things should be placed.  
Saint Peter:  Servant take this
woman to hell.  The husband
seeing his wife going to hell
he started after her.
Saint Peter:  Man how long have
you been with this woman.
Husband:  About 20 years.
Saint Peter:   Well you can stay
here you have been in hell long
enough.
