Spanish Tunes

Miss Jovita Gonzales of St. Mary's Hall, one of the foremost
authorities on Mexican border folk-lore, trained her sadly
Anglo-Saxon pupils to sing twenty of the game-songs, nursery
rhymes, etc., that she had learned as a child on a ranch at
the border of Texas and Mexico. She was forced to use Anglo-
Saxon children because none of the little Mexican girls in
St. Mary's Hall would take time to learn them. Some of
these rhymes are Spanish in origin, some Mexican, some of
mixed parentage. Some of the melodies are very fine.

In Little Mexico in San Antonio we found a group of Mexican
children who consented to sing for us their game-songs. The
record they made, of eight tunes, some of them modern as the
telephone , some ancient as the Moor's conquest, was particularly 
fine.

Near one of the oldest Missions about San Antonio we brought together 
a group of country folk one afternoon. There we
recorded thirteen love-songs and ballads which so far as we,
Miss Gonzales and our informants knew had never hitherto been
recorded.

I might remark at this point that the Library will be able
easily to get together a large collection of Mexican folk-tunes
sung in the proper manner from the recordings of commercial
concerns. Thousands of records are pressed and scores of
thousands sold of the indigenous, popular tunes, ballads and
love-songs. Whether there are many types of Tex-Mex folk-
songs not yet recorded we do not know. Certainly we feel
safe about the game-songs.
