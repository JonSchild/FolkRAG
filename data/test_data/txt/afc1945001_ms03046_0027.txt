State: Oklahoma  City: Oklahoma City   Reported by: Geo. E. Roland, Dentist
Description of the person: Maintains an office in the downtown Medical Arts
Building and caters to upper class dental trade.
Rumor: There were no rumors collected from this source which had the three qualities
set forth in your directive. While the dentist appeared congenial and interested 
in cooperating, showed an eager interest to report further on the
subject if necessary, in my opinion, this contact would not be the
best possible source in future activity.
