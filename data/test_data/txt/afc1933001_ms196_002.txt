Dear Harold:

Under separate cover a check has been sent from
Decca to the Archives, in the amount of $6.90.
The check is to pay for the following records
to be sent to Jascha Heifeitz, 1520 Gilcrest
Drive, Beverly Hills, California.

The records are as follows:

LC #1702 - Pretty Polly - FM
      #8 -
      #31 -
33-#49 -
19 [#11-1] A Fox Chase
      #10 -

I wish you would give this your special rushing
through, Harold.  If there are any shipping costs,
let me know and I'll pay them.  Jascha Heifeitz
is going to arrange some of this material for
fiddlers.

When you get the American Amplifier machine,
watch especially for over-recording difficulties.
It has a tendency to peak and the result is a
curious echo effect.

Yours,
Alan Lomax
