Untwine you tail, Ma Jinjin,
Untwine your tail,
Go dow  to the village and get some culture,
And unwind your tail...

MaJinjin must have been some hoity-toity La Rose person some time ago.  
This song ridicules her...

Moin pas jamais we king ni un zed endans, (3) (she doesn't know how to spell)

She's got a chicken efoor in her hand
And she thinks it'sa pen.
