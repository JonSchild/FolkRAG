Fisk, 22. 5.

Anything my grandmaw would sing-- she'd sing that and she would sing
"Glory, Glory, Halleluyah."

A: Sing that.

W: My soul is marching home,
Glory, glory, halleluja.

She'd sing that--

Glory, glory, halleluja,
Glory, glory, halleluja,
Glory, glory, halleluja,
My soul is marching home.

A: And what about your auntie-- you told me yesterday your auntie 
sang a lot.

W: Oh, first hymn I got out of a book, my auntie give it out. And
that was "Am I Born to Die?" I was five years old. When my auntie
give that out, I was five yearsold. She was sitting down in round like
the old folks did at that time-- round a fireside-- and git sitting
down and from that they got to singing, and from that they got to
praying and shouting. My auntie give out "Am I Born to Die?" And
they sung it and she prayed. Well, that's what we're doing now--
gitting on our knees and praying. And she got to her turn and my
daddy, he sund, "Ther's a Fountain Filled with Blood, Flowing from
Emmanuel's Veins."
A: Sing "Am I Born to Die?" the way your grandmaw sang it.

W: The way my auntie sung it?

A: Yes, the way your auntie sang it.

W: Am I born to die?
Am, Am.
I is born to die,
To lay this body down.
Oh-h, lay this body down.

That's the song.
Would your father get jealous of her doing all the singing?
Well, he sung. He sung, right on behind her. They was all good
