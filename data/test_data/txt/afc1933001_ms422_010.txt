About every two years a fever
attacks the people of our nation. An
epidemic rages over the state, the
last stage of which is an election in
November. During its early states
the symptoms of political fever are
varied. Its victim breaks out in a
rash that causes him to enter into
quiet disputes with his neighbors
over technicalities rather than fundamentals
He argues over every candidate
that offers himself as a personal
saviour of the people and the
sole protector of their welfare.

As the fever grows, quiet arguments
develop into heated disputes.
The fever sufferer recall every bad
thing, real or imaginary, that his
neighbor across the way ever did to
him. The longer the fever rages the
more frantically its victim searches
his memory for forgotten differences
against his neighbors to explain their
ornery attitude in failing to support
his own favorite political candidate.

And then comes the election! After
a summer of hating his neighbors
because they do not agree with him
on every petty candidate, the victim
of political fever goes to the polls,
marks an X after the name of the
candidate who has promised to carry
all the voters' burdens, and then
trudges home. The morning after
election, the voter wakes up with a
headache and discovers that in spite
of the fact that his pet candidate
has won, he still has the same economic
system, and his problems have
not been solved.

For over a century and a half the 
people of the United States have
pinned their faith on political action
as the one way to let someone else
do for them the things they can do
only by organizing and shouldering
the responsibility of working out together
their own solution to their 
common problems. In the past we
have been content without changing
the profit system. It is not persons
who are responsible for poverty,
rags, starvation, and homelessness.
It is a system based on the profit
motive that makes a few enormously
wealthy at the expense of the many
who are the real producers of wealth.

Sometime we will learn to vote for
a change in the economic system. We
will not be content simply to change 
the drivers of this crazy economic 
machine that we call Capitalism.

Every citizen of this country has
a duty to perform. He should study
political issues, he should study the
economic system, he should study and
discover the plan of an economic
system that can end bloated wealth
on the one hand and naked poverty
on the other. And he should not fail
to state his views at the ballot box.

But his duties do not end there.
This job of changing the economic
system is a day by day task. All
farmers, regardless of differences
in political views, are still farmers. And
all farmers, regardless of differences
in political views, have the same
problem demanding the same solution.
While they may disagree in the 
one field of action, they can unite in
another.

Section 14, Article 12, of the By-Laws
of the Farmers Educational
and Cooperative Union of America
provides that no discussion of a religious
or partisan political nature
shall be discussed in a meeting of the
Union, and that any member guilty
of violating the Article may be expelled
after the second offense. This
Article was included after many
earlier farm organizations had been
wrecked because of political dissension.
The founders of the Farmers
Union recognized that there were two
definite spheres of action by which
the economic system could be
changed. The one was political action.
The other was economic action.
The Farmers Union is an economic
organization, working towards a 
change in the economic system
through educating in cooperative
principles and building cooperative
business.

We can work together in building
the cooperative movement and striking
at the root of an economic system
that has as its sole purpose
making money for a few private
owners and depriving the many of
the product of their toil. Through
the building of cooperative business,
owned by ourselves and operated for
ourselves, we can replace private,
wealth-concentrating business, with
collective wealth-distributing business.

We expect our members to take
an intelligent part in the political 
activities that affect their welfare.
But we expect them to do so as individuals,
not as members of the 
Farmers Union. A farmer can be a
