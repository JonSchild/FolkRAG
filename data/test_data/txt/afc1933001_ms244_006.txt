Dear Alan:

The other day Mike and I, Johnny
and Margaret, stopped by to
see Ivan Hand. He announced sagely
that he had at last concluded
that "Crime doesn't pay. I'm walking
the straight road now and
wont turn [b??] back," Iron
Hand declared earnestly, over
and over again. See his references
to you and Edward
in his letter which I enclose.
There are two or three precious
new lines in the songs he sends.

As an unbiased investigator
of Negro folk stuff (which
you most certainly are not)
you've got to steel yourself,
bring an honest man, against
the tendency of Fisk, Ernest Branson
