an' come. Just like I have done for peoples, peoples have done 
for me.   An' some bring whole hams an' bring high as 13 chickens, 
at one time!   Ha, ha, I'm tellin' ya!   An' bring me great, big 
Fridgadaire.   I didn't even have one.   Great, big one.   Just give 
it to me.   You know?  I. . .

[*HOW GEORGE HELPED AROUND THE HOUSE*]
TL:      What's the nicest things your husbands -- the men in your 
life -- ever did for you?
BJ:       Just, just. . .I couldn't name it hardly, let me tell you the 
truth!   So many great things, ya know?   He'p me when I needed 
it.   That's, that's, that's the main ting an'. . .an' ah. . .
TL:       What kind of ways did George help you?
BJ:       Well, in any way. . .he could.   Every way he could.   Ah, he. . . 
cooked for me when I was sick.   In other words, the main ting 
of it:  When my baby was bo'n, nobody had to wash [about the house] m' clothes. 
George washed [it] 'em hisself. My mother was there, an' if she knew 
anything, George had the clo'es on the line.   I don't care how 
filthy they was, he washed them.   He washed my baby's diapers an' 
everything.   And then, if I go to work an', an' leave some diapers 
in soak[in'] -- I never keep diapers in the house; I hates that, an' 
ah, an' ah, baby's diapers covered about in the house all over 
the floor; I don't like it a bit.   I work for many people that 
way.   When I go int they house, they got a diaper here an' a diaper 
yonder.   It just don't make sense!   It just don't [make] -- An' you 
got a commode in your house!   I didn't have no commode no that 
time.    An' I jes', ah, put mine in a tub.
