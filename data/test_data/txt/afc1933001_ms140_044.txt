D. One or two people manipulating hand or finger
puppets of the simplest type calling for no formal
stage. These people would move about within the
court and have only the minimum of equipment with
them. The plays they put on would be necessarily
of the simplest sort and while it would be easier
to appeal only to children, some effort should be
made to develop the sort of performance which would
interest adults. The possibility exists here of
allowing the audience to participate in this activity.

IV. Live Exhibits

Within the horseshoe of the exhibit building, there may
be provisions for booths in which there can be live exhibits,
i.e., demonstrators, carrying on some portion of
the work. These exhibits would show two things: first,
how the article exhibited is made; and second, how it is
used in a recreation program, for what groups and what
activities. The following live exhibits have been suggested
to the committee:

A. Sports and games equipment. One or more persons
making fencing and archery equipment, or model sail
boats or airplanes, or any of the table games such
as ping pong, box hockey, checkers and chess.

B. Puppets and Marionettes. These would range from
the simplest hand and finger puppets to the most intricate
string marionettes.

C. Musical instruments, including instruments for
rhythm bands, secondary basic instruments such as
shepherds' pipes, ocarina, harmonica, banjoe, ukelele,
calura flute and also the more complex string
instruments.

D. Dramatic properties and equipment such as sound
effects, scenery, costumes, and story telling equipment.

E. Nature crafts, including the use of trees, flowers,
rocks, leaves and other natural materials.

F. Photography, ranging from the production of equipment
to the taking and developing of photographs.
