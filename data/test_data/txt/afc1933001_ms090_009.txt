at least. Who knows? as soon 
as we are sure nobody is going 
to bother our negroes, we might 
even get to go to see you sometime.
 I'm going to be a little
uneasy about that for a while,
though. Fir the present they 
live in the little room over 
the cellar, which is just outside 
our bedroom, you know, and 
eat in our kitchen.
Well, I realize this letter is 
mostly about them! We are 
evidently full of what we hope 
will be out good fortune, and 
can't keep our minds. off of the subject
With much love from us 
both and hoping you will come to 
see us very soon - 
yours affectionately - 
The Calloways.
