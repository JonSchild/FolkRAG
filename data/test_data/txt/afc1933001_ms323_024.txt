BASCOM LAMAR LUNSFORD

"Minstrel of the Appalachians"
Lawyer, Farmer and Folklorist

   Mr. Lunsford is founder and director of the Annual
Folk Festival of Asheville, the oldest festival of its 
kind in the country. He has long been a leader in the 
national folk-art movement, being at present a  member 
of the Executive Committee of the National Folk Festival.
His collection folk-songs ins one of the largest 
personally collected, in the country. He recorded from
memory 316 folk-songs for the Columbia University
Library. He has made records for Brunswick. A 
selection from his collection was published in 1929. The
University of North Carolina will soon bring out a 
definitive edition of his very late collection.
   The title with which he is dubbed, "Minstrel of the  
Appalachians," is significant, for his lore is of folklife
itself. He was born, raised, and has always lived
in what is considered the very center of our country's 
richest folk-art tradition, and was among the first to
understand the cultural importance of the native folk
music and dances. He resides at Leicester, near Ashevile,
N.C.
