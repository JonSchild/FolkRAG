you see when Prohibition was tough. An' he liked me pretty well, you see.  An' Ise
a bad hand when Ise around him-- he poured out the whiskey by big glasses-- he'd
pour me out one or I'd drink it or die.  And maybe [after] I'd have to drink two or three
I'd drink two or three an' I'd hold up till I'd out of his sight before I'd get
staggerin' an' cuttin' up.  Sometimes we'd git six gallons an' we'd get with a half
of it, we'd break it up.  He'd make us drunk an' we'd break the rest up.  Well, he
