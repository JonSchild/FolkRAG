The French have gone and the Yanks have come
Say the Sai-gon child-ren,
We live in war like our natur-al home
Say the Sai-gon child-ren.

The Yankee comes when the French retreats
Say the Saigon children,
We play the game of War in the Streets ....

You smash and burn, smash and burn ......
Viet kids are quick to learn ......

"Seek and destroy! Seek and destroy!"......
What a line for a five year boy ......

We needed rice and you gave us a stone.....
Stone in the hand is easy thrown ......

Napalm burns through the forest cover .....
A jeep will burn if you turn it over .....

Take your PX and leave us alone,
Say the Saigon children.
Vietnam is our natural home,
Say the Saigon children.


PLEIKU, Viet Nam-The children of most world
societies grow up playing at war. It's different
in Viet Nam. Here some of the kids grow up
working at it.

They are suckled during firefights. Teethed on
rifle cartridges.

And they can kill or be killed before growing a decade
old.


August Moon

Slow

Au- gust moon my Au-gust moon In the
still- ness of the rice the bo- dies lie,
my Au-gust moon.

(break) (end)

August moon
my August moon
in the stillness of the
rice
the bodies lie,
my August moon.

August moon
my August moon
nobody knows where
nobody knows why,
my August moon.

August moon
my August moon
their tears are colder
than the frost can cry,
my August moon.

August moon
my August moon
forget if they live 
forgotten if they die,
my August moon.

August moon
my August moon
in the stillness of the
rice
the bodies lie,
my August moon.
