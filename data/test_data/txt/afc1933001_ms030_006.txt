2116 Liberty Street,
Allentown,Pa.
July 11,1935.

Dear Mr.Lomax:

I regret that you could not have come earlier in the
season as I had rather expected you would from your initial letter.
However,for the rest of the summer and most of the Fall I shall
be on the road myself with a recording machine taking down
Pennsylvania folk songs and tunes sung by my friends with
Professor Le Mon of Bucknell University as my associate. For this
reason,and much to my regret,I will not be available to render
that assistance to you that I had hoped that I would be able to.

I shall answer your letter in accordance with the
[*questions*] you asked in your last letter:

1.The name of the Columbia University professor who
made records of the Pennsylvania Folk Festival at Allentown is
George W.Hibbitt.

2. He and Mr.Garwick,representing the company that
manufactures the machine,made a complete set of records of our
festival--some thirty-five.Those that I have heard vary in
clearness,but all are very good.

3.No records were made of the National Folk Festival
at Chattanooga to my knowledge.

4.Unfortunately I witnessed only the performances
of the last two days and found them very interesting.I might say
that Miss Knott is doing a fine job against great odds.

5.None of the ballads are from Col.Shoemaker's
collections.Those that the miners sang came from my book,"Songs
and Ballads of the Anthracite Minter" published in 1927.Some of
the Pennsylvania German songs are in print though not with music.

6.Col.Shoemaker was to have brought his four
mountaineers but was prevented from doing so.I imagine you would
have no great trouble finding these mountaineers though they are
pretty old and scattered in four mountainous counties.

Sincerely yours,
George Korson
