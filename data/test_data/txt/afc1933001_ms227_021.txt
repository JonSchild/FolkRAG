Dear Alan:  Undated, hurried,
unplanned, almost incoherent 
in spots, written a gummed-up
type-writer, both amusing and 
vigorous, came your letter 
this morning.  I'm dammed 
[if you If] if I don't believe 
you would make yourself 
write to me oftener could you 
only know what [they] your letters mean to 
[my] me.  You always fed Fedelis 
when he was hungry.  Cordially
I think each letter of yours 
adds at least a month to 
my life.
