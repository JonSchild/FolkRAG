AL:      Did you say he tied her to. . . ?
BJ:       He tied her to the organ.  Yeah, whupped her wet.  You know,

You know, some of those ol' patriarchs, you know, did that.  Tie
they chilren up. They -- He has 2 big boys, good-sized boys.   An'
Carolyn was good-size, too.  So jus' take ['em'] 'er down that mornin'
an' take [me] Mino down, [they don't do it.] an' whup Mino & them good.  They jus' tie ['em uo] 'er to [up,] or--
jus' lash 'er to the organ.   An' the organ -- all organs -- they
made like that, got a thing in here; they tie it -- tie 'em to
that organ.   Some of 'em keep that rope down in that organ.  'Cause
most of 'em had organs.  That was the style in those days, ya know,
like pianas now.  An' they tie 'er to that organ an' whupped her

laughed at me no more to my knowin'.  Hah, I didn't know it!
          But I ain' had no more fights, no more troubles, with no more
school chilren, nowhere.   'Cause I hadn't been havin' none, nohow.
At Hickory and Elm, we didn't have any, any kinda trouble like
that.  I went to Hickory an' Elm School.
