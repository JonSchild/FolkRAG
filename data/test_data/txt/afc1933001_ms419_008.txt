LIGHTS IN THE QUARTERS BURNIN' MIGHTY DIM

Lights in the quarters burnin' mighty dim, partner, [*28*]
Lights in the quarters burnin' mighty dim,
Must be killin' poor Shanty Joe.
Please don't kill poor Shanty, don't kill poor Shanty Joe.
Captain, can't you see this four o'clock risin's 'bout to kill poor me?
Captain, can't you see this four o'clock trouble 'bout to kill poor me?

MUSIC---Prison Moan

PRISON MOAN*
* A hymnlike tune used as a prison holler.

1 If I had a-listened what my mother said, [*26*]
I would 'a' been home sleepin' in my cold iron bed;

2 But I bein' hardheaded an' I would not min',
Yes, they caused me here with all this time.

3 But if I overcome this trouble I'm in,
Lawd, I never no mo' will live in sin.

4 When I was a free man I had plenty friends;
Now I'm in trouble, an' they won' come in.

5 Lawd, in struggle I'll stretch my hands to thee,
Lawd, in trouble, no other help I know.

6 But if Thou withdrew Thyself from me;
I would wonder where then shall I go.

7 Lawd, if I could hear my dear old mother
When she pray for me once again!

8 Trouble have caused me to weep, an' it's caused me to moan,
An' it caused me to leave my happy home.

MUSIC---Eadie

EADIE
1 Go way, Eadie, you dirty dog, [*23*]
Wo, Eadie, go way;
Go way, Eadie, you dirty dog,
Wo, Eadie, go way.

2 Go way, Eadie, quit worryin' me,
Wo, Eadie, go way;
Go way, Eadie, quit worryin' me,
Wo, Eadie, go way.

3 Told you once and I told you twice,
Wo, Eadie, go way;
Told you once and I told you twice,
Wo, Eadie, go way.
