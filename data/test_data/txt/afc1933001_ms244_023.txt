As for the Alabama trip I say
nothing - except with that uncertainty hanging
over me I have been unable to
make any plans for the past 
several months. I can't make
'em now, for I shall do nothing
that might hurt the chances to
earn a dollar for dear Mrs. Tartt.
But this is the last limb I shall
ever crawl out on for the Library
of Congress and what I think of
the Executive ability of the Music
Division would make a finely
grained sifter out of an asbestos
curtain.

A wealthy oil Texas-Ex is
going to print 50,000 copies of
my Will Hogg story for
distribution to all Texas-Exes.
With this whoop of vanity I
bring these few feeble remarks
to a close. â€” Lovingly,
Father
