Mr. E. O. Holland, President
The State College of Washington
Pullman, Washington
Dear President Holland:
This is in reply to your letter of April 29 addressed to
Mr. MacLeish. As you have already heard from Mr. MacLeish,
we are delighted to learn of your interest in our project and
look forward with pleasure to the day when we can work out a
definite plan for cooperation. At the present time, however,
we are far from the consideration of state or regional depositories.
We hope to make available duplicates of our folk-song
recordings next fall but have not yet developed our program
specifically far beyond this. Several series of
electrical transcriptions and direct broadcasts are now under
consideration but we should welcome any suggestions you may
care to make.
Very sincerely yours,
Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
