Dear Alan:

1. This week I have had luncheon
with Mr. Latham of [Macmillan?]
and Mr. Luce who controls Time,
Life, Fortune and the March of Time
He put you down for a personal.

2. Could you send me some
other leads for my trip to 
Washington in case it is ever
authorized?  You must have 
some from your broadcasts.
Mrs. Smith here in Dallas I
think may prove helpful.
I am phoning Mrs [West?]
tonight, not having any word
