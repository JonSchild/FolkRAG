     But then, if anyone is, like I say a while ago about the 
oyster shells.  Oyster shells is really good for the backache?
Good for you when you're down in energy.
TL:  What do you do?  You grind the shell up?
BJ:  Yeah.  You [can]jus beat 'em up.  After they parch.  You can't
beat 'em up before they parch so well.  But after they parch,
you can jus' beat 'em up.  So take, put 'em in...
TL:  Don't they hurt?  Oyster shells are sharp.  Don't they hurt
you?
BJ:  How do you know hurts....
TL:  Don't you beat 'em into powder, like?
BJ:  Yeah!  You, you don't know how they gonna hurt you an' you,
you gonna put water on 'em an' drink off it.  You ain't gonna
take the shell.
TL:  Oh, you mean the oyster, itself?
BJ:  The oyster shells, not the oyster...The oyster shells, that 
the oyster come out of, see?
TL:  But, honey, they're like rocks!
BJ:  I know they are.  An' ya put 'em in a stove an' they'll
