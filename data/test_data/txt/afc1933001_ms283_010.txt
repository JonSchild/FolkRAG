Well, they could lie about poor land, too, when trouble came down 
hard....
They'd say the land is gettin' so poor you have to 
get nine pattridges to holler bob-white here these days. 
The land got so poor the sun wouldn't shine on it. You couldn't 
even raise a grass widow on it. The cuckleburrs would pick 
your pockets. It got to where the grasshoppers had to hop three 
times to break even. They built a church-house and had to send to 
town and get fertilizer before the people could raise up a hymn. 
The [corn] cotton grew so low that the bumble-bees had to get down on their 
knees to suck the honey off the blossoms. The farmers got to 
the place once that if they had been selling freight trains for 
a dime a dozen they couldn't even have bought the echo of a whistle.
.... They talk along... Why I heard an awful racket down in[t] the 
field the other day..
     Uh, hunh, what was it...
     Papa Boll Weevil was whippin' little Willie Boll Weevil 
because he couldn't carry two rows  in the place of one....
Boll Weevil - [Hard on We Po' Farmers.....]
[Then the boll weevil....
The ballad itself with the folks helping out....]

Well, there's a [scrap?] of the America I've been listening to 
for the past 7 years - an America well worth listening to!
