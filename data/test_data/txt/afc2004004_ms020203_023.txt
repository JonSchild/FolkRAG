But he just won't cut his hair for nothin'. Some time he
plat it and then again he comb it and let it standup.
He had it wrapped all summer before last. He says it makes
him strong to wear his hair long that way . . . Lots of mens
ask him, "Say, Rich, what fault you find getting a hair cut
man?" I don't want narun. My hair ain't botherin' me.
Is it botherin' you?" "I just don't want to see you that way."
Well, you don't have to look at me." They just think he's
funny. He's got good sense. He just stays in that attitude all
the time. He always got sumpin funny to say. No matter who
say anything he got something funny to anser. How he think
it I don't know. He's a sight. I reckon he's down there
side the track. . . right today--
