R. Keith Kane, Assistant Director
Eugene Katz, Special Service Division
"Hush-Hush" Campaign

In a memorandum of March 22nd, addressed to Jack 
Swords and myself, you say, "Why not suggest to the Bureau 
of Operations a 'Don't Gossip' campaign?"

Enclosed is a very complete, well thought out and 
thoroughly professional campaign outlined in great detail for 
such a "Hush-Hush" campaign as you suggest.

I suggest that this be passed on to Mr. William 
B. Lewis for its valuable suggestions in this direction.

It is the property of Mr. Arnold Barach, Campaigns 
Branch, Division of Information, OEM, Washington D.C., and 
came to him from the 11th Naval District, San Diego, California. 
Mr. Barach sent it to us yesterday.

Note to Mr. Lewis is attached for your signature.
