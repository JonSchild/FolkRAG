Mr. E. Milby Burton, Director
The Charleston Museum 
Charleston, S. C. 

Dear Mr. Burton: 

The Archive of American Folk-Song 
has quite a large collection of Haitian
drumming records which I made on the 
Island in 1937. We are much interested 
in making this material available to 
the people who are interested but we 
have no means of duplicating the records 
even for our own study. Your request 
will be placed on file and when we have 
the equipment it will be considered. 
Very sincerely yours, 

Alan Lomax 
Assistant in Charge
