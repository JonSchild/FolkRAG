The Kid:  
In other words, the middle buster lays the rows.

Natchez:  
That's right, it makes the rows. 

The Kid:  
An' those guys can make em' just as straight as an arrow.

Natchez:  
You ain't jokin'. 
The Kid:  
They disc the land down flat and then they set a stake down here...

Natchez:  
And one man starts and he keeps [xxxxxxxxxx] that stake between
those two mules and goes right straight to that stake. 

The Kid:  
All you need is one row and they take the others from that one...

Natchez: 
(Who has been remembering [what is was like to work and] how he felt
 about working and living down South, how much it was like a 
 prison for him, seems to change the subject...)
      That's right, Kid, but the thing I wanted to get at is 'bout the
 feelin' of those things that's just like a man in prison an' 
maybe he's got fifteen or twenty years.  In prison. Git no pay. 
An he's got to take whatsonever they give him to eat. An' whatsonever
clothes they give him , he's got to wear that an' when those
wear out he's gotta patch 'em up [and] an' do roun' ...What about
things like that?

The Kid:  
(Who has been thinking about his time in Southern prisons, mistakes

down South is much better for colored people. I mean down there
