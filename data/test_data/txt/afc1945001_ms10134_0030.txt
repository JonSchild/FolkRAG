3/11/43 - From a Negro Member of 
Coast Guard - A former
Howard student in Men's
Lounge

He said a Marine told him that he
could tell when a English or a Russian
convoy came into port. The English ships
come in carrying ballast in the form of 
sand. Russian ships always bring some-
thing in exchange for materials they
take back, even if only matches. A
great number of barges carrying sand
means, he says, the Marine
said, always means an English convoy
came into port recently.
