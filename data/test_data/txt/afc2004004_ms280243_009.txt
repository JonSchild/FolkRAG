Lagan Love: Margaret Barry: 
1) Where Lagan stream sings lullabye 
There blows a lily fair, 
The twilight gleam is in here eye 
The night is on her hair. 
And like a love-sick leman she 
She has my heart in thrall. 
No life I own, or liberty 
For love is Lord of all. 

2) And oftimes when the beetles horns 
Have lulled the eve to sleep, 
I steal unto her sh-- 
And there, adoring, peep. 
Whereon the cricket sings it song, (cricket singing stone) 
She stirs the bogwood fire, 
And there she sings sad sweet undertones, 
The song of her heart's desire.

Johnny Todd: Isla Cameron. 
1) Johnny Todd he took a notion 
For to cross the raging tide, 
But he left his true love behind him 
Walking on the Liverpoolside. 

2) For a week she wept full sorely, 
Tore her hair and wrung her hands, 
Till she met with another sailor 
Walking on the Liverpool sands. 

3) "O fair maid, why are you weeping 
For your Johnny gone to sea ? 
If you'll wed with me tomorrow 
I will kind and constant be." 

4) "I will buy you sheets and blankets, 
I'll buy you a wedding ring, 
You shall have a gilded cradle 
For to rock your baby in. 

5) Johnny Todd came home from sailing, sailing on the ocean wide, 
But he found that his fair & false one was another sailor's bride 

6) Now young men who go a-sailing for to fight the foreign foe, 
Don't you leave your love like Johnny, marry her before you go.
