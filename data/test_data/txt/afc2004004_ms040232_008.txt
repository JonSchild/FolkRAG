Dear Mr. Lomax,

When I received your kind letter of 22nd Inst, I at once took it along to Mr. [Alberc???] Barr, Schoolmaster, here, who is the best interpreter in Galloway of English Irish or Scottish Folks Songs.  You raise a very difficult and puzzling question.  Our hills in Galloway have all Gaelic names and we must have had a [??] and folksongs of our own, but where are they? [When] that a Scottish Historian was searching in the [Vatican?] for Scottish literature & presumably for Scottish or Galloway folk songs I approached her to see if she had discovered anything relating to Galloway
