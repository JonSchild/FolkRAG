General Rumors.

            In addition to the rumors which we have obtained from the above sources, 
we are listing the following ones as of possible interest:
            1.   Business girl - "My fellow was here on furlough last week. He says 
all of the ships going out are now equipped with invasion boats instead of lifeboats 
because we are about to undertake a second front."
            2.   Postal employee.- This man brought in to the office two letters from 
his nephew of Italian parentage, stationed in the Coast Guard on the west coast, 
in which the boy urgently asks that his and his brother's guns be sent him because 
"there is only one gun furnished for 20 men and some of the boys have been injured 
because they have had to deal with men who were armed when they were unarmed. They 
told us to write home for guns."
            3.   Mother of young officer with excellent educational background, worried 
because her son had been sent out of the country with what she considered an excellent 
offensive training but no defensive training which would equip him to defend 
himself in personal warfare. This boy was in heavy artillery.
            4.   Wife of man in U. S. camp - "____________ says that there is a lot of 
complaining at the Post about the food. He says part of it is probably because 
the mess is in the hands of some inexperienced cooks, but he says they are not 
getting top grade meat and they wonder who is getting it since the folks at home 
write that they can't get any either."
            5.   A young lawyer just returning from a train trip east - "I ran into a 
fellow on the smoker who was a small manufacturer, who was generally very critical 
and who concluded that taxes were going to be so high that efficient management of 
his plant would do him no particular good, so when he was in circumstances where he 
would ordinarily send a telegram or letter, he now used long distance because he 
figured he might as well spend his money as give it to the Internal Revenue Department."
