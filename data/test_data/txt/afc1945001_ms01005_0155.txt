count to discuss whether President
Roosevelt was right or wrong in refusing
to press and radio permission
to publish, until after he returned,
the news about his trip.

Certainly, some White House advisers
make a strong case for his
decision. They say three press association
reporters were taken along,
and that thus there was no blanket,
continuing censorship. They say the
news was withheld until after the
trip for two reasons: First, to protect
the President's safety on the
theory that enemy agents might
have figured out his itinerary had
the story been published in each
community or had it been released
soon thereafter. They say, in addition,
that it would have been physically
impossible to provide train
space, visiting facilities at plants,
and so on, for a large number of
press, radio, newsreel and photographic
representatives.

Results Unfortunate

All that's a matter for debate-
and nobody ever won a decision
from the President in a debate of
that kind. His word is law.

But some of the unfortunate results
that resulted from the decision
are not debatable. They are clear.
A few examples will be related here
of the rumors that raced through 
the land. And some, but not all,
may be news to the President.

Take the most serious rumor of
all. This one got going in an Ohio
city. Railroad men observed that a
special train was coming through,
and that it was far off any scheduled
train's time. Who started the resulting
rumor isn't known. But the
rumor was that the train was a
Presidential special rushing the
President to the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester.

Absurd? Of course it was to any
one who'd seen the healthy appearance 
of the President in recent
months. But it did circulate. Residents
telephoned newspapers. The
newspapers, which had been told
that the President was making a 
coast-to-coast swing but which did
not know his itinerary, knew what
the true facts were. But all they
could say was that the rumor was
untrue. They could not state that
the President's train had gone
throuhg the city. They could not
say where he was. And, with such
negative information it's pretty hard 
to kill a rumor

The Political Rumor

There was rumor No. 2. It popped
up in a dozen places. The President
was supposed to be conferring
here and there with political
leaders. Some informants telephoned
newspaper offices in Los Angeles,
swearing up and down that
the President had had coffee on his 
train with Helen Gahagan, Democratic
National Committeewoman
from California. Well, the President
killed that at his Thursday
afternoon press conference by saying,
and resaying, that the only politicians
he saw at any time were the
eleven Governors of the eleven states
through which he passed.

Rumor No. 3 told a story of an
innocent bystander. This was telephoned
to one newspaper by no
fewer than four plant employees.

Rumors Rife on Roosevelt Trip

(Continued from page one)
Their versions differed somewhat.
But all had heard that a self-
conscious workman had been appointed
to represent workers in the
plant in speaking to the President. 
He had rehearsed his act through
and through. But, when the time
came to approach the President, he
lost his nerve when only a few feet
away and turned and ran.

The story went on that plant
policemen and secret service men, 
unaware of what had happened and
taking the stand that their job is
to protect the President first and
ask questions afterward, pounced
upon the unfortunate man and gave
him a good shellacking.

The President was asked about
that rumor and he said he'd never
even heard of such a thing, Stephen
T. Early, White House press secretary,
said no such thing ever happened.
But again a rumor persisted,
when a little light shed by press
and radio would have squelched it
before it had spread out of the city.

There's another example. This
story may have been started as a
gag. It was so good that listeners
forgot they had heard it as a manufactured 
funny story. Soon it was
being told from California to the
East Coast as an actual happening.
Sometimes the scene was different
and the facts varied.

The story was that a workman


who liked his liquor was startled to
see the President walk by his machine 
in a war plant. The President
stopped to shake hands. The
workman, after work, passed up
bars to rush home and tell his wife,
"What do you think happened to
me today?"

His wife, used to fanciful stories,
said sarcastically, "Oh, I suppose
you shook hands with the President."

He said, "That's exactly what I
did; wait until you se the paper
this afternoon; they'll have my picture!"

Came the afternoon paper. No 
picture. Not a line about the President.
Just a last line from the wife:
"Well, you're drunk again." And a
protest from the husband to the
paper: "Don't you think it's carrying
things too far to suppress news 
about the President?"

That complaint, incidentally, was
heard by many a paper from many
an indignant subscriber.

The papers couldn't answer satisfactorily;
they couldn't even give
out confirmation that the President
was in town.

All they could do was to wish 
somewhat wistfully that voluntary
censorship hadn't made things so
tough on them and that they were
able to perform the greatest function
of a free press, which is:

Keep the people informed and
save America from lies and rumors.
