through the 8th will be the period for the nation-wide collection of rumors.  All field staffs, Surveys, Polls, BPI, Correspondence Panels, Listening Posts, and every cooperating group, will be called upon. Starting August 10th, Media and Sources will analyze news for the three-week period July 27th through August 15th.  August 25th at 10:15 A.M. the Committee will re-convene for the first discussion designed to integrate and improve interpretations of analyses which will then be under way.

     Curl will make available to the other members of the Committee copies of the categories and classification scheme used by Sources in Government source analysis.  Martin will review this listing and add any category found useful in Media analysis which may not appear in the listing used by Sources.  This listing finally derived should prove helpful in the original approach to the collection of Rumor by Surveys and Field Staff.
