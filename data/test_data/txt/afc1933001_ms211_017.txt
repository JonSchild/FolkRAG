no faint reference or jibe from any
one of them. Must genius thus
flourish and flower with no
sustaining [we] sentiments of appreciation.
See how my
classmate, the oldest Senator in
years of service comes across!

For the fourth time I ask:
What did you buy for yourself
out of the money I sent you
for Christmas?

For the second time I ask:
Did you give the Oxford Book of
Light Verse permission to use my
(our) stuff? If not, I go after them.

I should also like for you
to tell me if Bess seems happy
in her life at Bryn Mawr? Has
she a fair chance of getting marks
that will not prove too discouraging
to her? She has written us very scantily
of her College impressions.

Affectionately,
Father
