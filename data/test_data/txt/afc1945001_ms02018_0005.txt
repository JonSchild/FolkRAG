Anti-Japanese

1.    Two Japanese who were picking cotton tried to escape; they were
        shot by soldiers who then ordered the other Japanese to dig graves
         and bury them on the spot.  (Told by elderly man on the street.
        10/7/42)

2.     A soldier was taking two Japanese to the prison camp at Lordsburg,
         New Mexico; one of them tried to run and was shot by the soldier.
         The soldier was taken up before officials to give an account of 
          the incident, and was practically given a medal for his part in
         it.  (Attorney.  10/6/42)

3.     The Japanese in the prison camp at Lordsburg, New Mexico, are
         not worrying about being interned because they believe that we
        will be under the rule of the Japanese in two months.  (Government
         employee.  10/7/42)

4.     A women went to a grocery store and was handling some of the
        tomatoes to see whether or not they were overripe.  The Japanese
        attendant in charge told her that when the Japanese took over the
        country, she would no longer be able to handle the fresh fruits
        and vegetables.  She then went to the refrigerator, took out a
       quart of milk, hit the man over the head with it and killed him,
        and no action was taken against her.  (Attorney.  10/7/42)
