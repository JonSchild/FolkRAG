Shuttles of Commerce
(Tune: Come to the Fair)

The shuttles of commerce are threading 
the sky,
Oh, oh, wings o'er the world,
They're binding the world into one as 
they fly,
Oh, oh, wings o'er the world. 
Oh, the web they are weaving, it
flows through our hands,
Our lives are enmeshed in its swift-
gleaming strands,
And we work with girls of all lands
As we fashion the fabric of commerce.
So into the loom we will weave our 
goodwill
Oh, oh, wings o'er the world.

The quivering currents, tho silent as
light,
Oh, oh, sing round the world,
They blossom with sound when we harness 
their flight,
Oh, oh, sing round the world. 
    Oh, the words we send out toward the
    East at the dawn
    We hear from the West ere the daylight 
       has gone
    And the world is girdled with song,
    As it sways with the rhythm of commerce.
So each in our own tongue will breathe
     our good-will
Oh, oh, sing round the world.

There's Something About a Worker

There's something about a worker,
" " " "
" " " "
That is fine, fine, fine
There's something in his bearing
Something in what he's wearing
Something about his features
All a-shine, shine, shine.
He may be a little inspector,
He may be a big die-maker,
He may be a common worker
On the line, line, line.
But the worker's healthy chest
Seems to suit the ladies best;
There's something about a worker
That is fine! fine! fine!

Over All the Lands
(Tune: Anvil Chorus)

Over the prairies and over the mountains
and up from the cities that front the
sea
Out from the mills and the mines and the
forests is rising the call that shall 
set men free.

Chorus:
Over all the lands it sounds
And over all the waters.
Earth and the fruits of earth
For all her sons and daughters.
No more each for each alone
But undivided, with heart decided
We rise to claim our own.

Men in the grip of the farm and the
factory
Women the dr[e]udges of kitchen and mill,
Children bereft of the playtime of
childhood
Have claimed for their children the 
promise still.

Repeat Chorus. 

Typewriter Song
(Tune: Marching Thru Georgia)

Rap-a-tap, rap-a-tap, rap-a-tap, all day
No, this is not a little boy, a soldier 
at his play
'Tis a busy business girl, rap-tapping
all the day,
To keep big Business marching onward.

Chorus:
Day in, day out, she earns her daily
bread
Week in, week out, a busy path she'll 
tread
She must have nimble fingers
and she must have nimble mind,
To keep big Business marching onward.

Clickety-click, clickety-click, the
typewriter's merry song,
Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, the telephone
all day long,
"Now won't you take a letter, please?"
the Big Boss now chimes in
To keep big Business marching onward.
