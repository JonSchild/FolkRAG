Instructions for "Rumor-Collecting" Assignment

WHAT IS A RUMOR?

For the purposes of this experiment, we'll define a rumor as
any story related to the war, its effects, or the persons concerned
with it which you, yourself, have not sen published or heard
broadcast in its entirety, or for which you have no other proof.

Usually the story is second-hand.  "I heard that..."  "A fellow
told me..."  "A friend of mine read an article.."  The rumor
may sound surprisingly like actual fact, and it may even be based
on fact.  But it can still be a rumor if any of the facts are distorted
in any way.

So you will have to develop the habit of listening closely,
and considering carefully any conversation you hear about the war.
And if you're at all doubtful about whether anything you hear is
a rumor, jot it down and send it to us.  Leave it to us to decide.

WHERE WILL YOU COME ACROSS RUMORS?

The most important thing is:  Don't ask people if they've heard 
any; don't tell anyone you're interested in the subject.

During the next week, you'll probably find yourself talking
about the war or related topics o several occasions.  In such conversations,
simply keep your ears open for anything that may be a 
rumor.

You may hear them at the beauty parlor or barber shop, or in
a streetcar or bus; the grocery clerk or delivery man may pass one
along; your friends or family may tell you some story or report
they've heard; you may overhear one on the street, in a restaurant,
at any public place; some party you attend may produce several.

WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET ONE?

Jot it down on one of the enclosed cards, and with it jot down:
a. the approximate age of the person from whom you heard it
b. the sex of that person
c. the approximate economic level of that person
d. the place where you heard the rumor (home, restaurant,
        on the telephone, bus, party, etc.)
e. the town and state
f. your name
g. the date you heard it

A sample card is enclosed.  If you hear the same rumor more
than once, use a separate card each time.

We are enclosing a pack of cards -- maybe too many and maybe
too few.  If you find that you will require more, obtain some at the
five-and-ten (and bill us, of course.)
