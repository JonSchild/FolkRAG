Kate Smith Will Sing
for the King and Queen

Kate Smith and cowboy songs by a
Washington man, Alan Lomax, were
announced today by Mrs. Roosevelt as
attractions completing the White
House musical program for King
George and Queen Elizabeth.
Miss Smith, a Washington girl, will
represent radio. Mr. Lomax is son
of John A. Lomax, Library of Congress
specialist on American folk
songs, who made the first collection of
cowboy ballads.
Marian Anderson, Lawrence Tibbett,
a Kentucky mountain quartet, a WPA-trained
Negro chorus from North Carolina 
and a group of white dancers from
the same state, make up the remainder 
of the program. Mrs. Roosevelt's
aim is to show extremes of American
music.

The British wool dress in which the
First Lady will receive Their Majesties
was given a preview. It has elbow
length sleeves, slightly flared skirt, flat
white pique bow at the V-neckline,
white pique piping around the collar
and a darker blue leather belt; skirt
length about 15 inches from the floor.
With it Mrs. Roosevelt will wear a 
blue straw hat trimmed with white,
and dark blue shoes and gloves.
Corn bread will be on one of the
White House menus for Their Majesties, 
Mrs. Roosevelt also revealed, and
WPA guide books will be placed in
their suite.
The War Department today issued
marching orders for 6100 troops for the
royal welcome. One of the greatest
shows of military force seen in the
Capital since World War days.

Two hundred Marines and 50 blue
jackets will form two facing lines from
the railroad platform to the Presidential 
Reception Room at Union
Station. Tanks, armored cars and
cavalary will escort the party from the
station to the White House.
