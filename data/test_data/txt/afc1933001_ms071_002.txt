Dear Sir:

     I am very anxious to get the records of those Mexican
folk songs that I helped Mr. Lomax get, and which you and Mr. 
Lomax promised more than a year ago to send me. You probably
have some of my letters on file.
      I want to get them at once, for I am preparing a school
reader for publication, and I need some of them to go in it.
While I would like to have them permanently, I would take them
temporarily on the promise to return them, if I can get them
no other way.
     The important thing is that I need them now.
Yours truly,
J. A. Rickard
