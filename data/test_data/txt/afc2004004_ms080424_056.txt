Time Code:
Tape:  Roll 51, Ray and Stan Hicks    5
Ray:  Well, when he told him, he layed it out, and a lot of times
that'd ruin it(?) with 'em you know.  But he told this otherun,
and this otherun told him to ask for him a piece you know.  And so
he went and got his and told and she says "Let me tell you!  I ain't
no damn whore, I dont fool with all of ya!  Now it's just a few,
I aint no damn whore!"  And that was the way she felt about it.
AL:  What happened when a girl got pregnant before she was married
and had a baby?
Ray:  What happened was. . . .there wasnt many that happened that way,
they watched it careful, but, when this few did let down, while
their 'flyers was on em'(?) as they said, . . .They were rough, all
the neighbors would go in and he would just have to marry her!
And then slip off and leave. . . .they made 'em marry 'em back then.
But some of them slipped off, but the most of them learnt to love
one another and stayed together to raise a family.  I know several
ones that's livin my age now, and a lot of them got married before
it got out on em. . .you see, before the youngun was born.  You get
married and it didn't get out on 'em, it didn't hurt the man like
the girl it did you know, it hurt her at that time.
AL:  Did she get put out of the house?
Ray:  No. . .well some would, some would just let them out of the
house, from the parents, run 'em off, yeah.  But the most of them
just kept it, and tell her to never never fool with another one,
they'd watch her close. . .help raise the kid. .when it got out of
her.  But it didn't hurt the boy, you know, . . . .but the girl, it
just hurt her. . . .The other boys didn't want to marry a girl that
had done started a family.  Stanly knows that.
Stan:  There was one feller that I know (unint.) that happened to
