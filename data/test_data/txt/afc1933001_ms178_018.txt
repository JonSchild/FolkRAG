Dear Mr. Lomax:

It is some time now since we heard from you in regard
to the material you were going to supply for our promotional work
on TALL TALES. We have withheld educational release of this film
for some time now awaiting your material, and would greatly appreciate
your letting us know as soon as possible as to when we may
expect same.

I hope you are going through with it. It would prove
quite awkward for us to have withheld release awaiting the material,
only to learn that you do not expect to do it.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,
BRANDON FILMS, Inc.
