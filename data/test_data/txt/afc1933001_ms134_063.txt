bibliography, which is now on cards but
a part of which is to be published by the
Hot Record Society of New York City,
might be of some value to you. If
this is the case, I would be happy to
mail it to you. However, since it
represents, in its present form, a great deal
of research, I would prefer to keep it
in my possession rather than have
it relegated to a pidgeon-hole where
it would find no use. If, then, you
have a definite use for the bibliography,
please write me.
Yours respectfully,
Melvin C. Oathout
