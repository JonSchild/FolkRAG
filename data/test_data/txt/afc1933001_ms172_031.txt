Dear Mr. Lomax:
     After a brief study of various mountain 
communities in Tennessee in the light of the
study you want to make I believe that Spencer,
Tennessee, and its vicinity would be the most 
likely location.
     I enclose herewith a brief piece of copy
about Spencer out of our files. This description,
of course, confines itself mainly to the
physical features of the village. If you will
call at our office in Nashville first, we can
give you a fairly good description of the cultural
background. We can also recommend persons with
whom you should get in touch, or if you like, a 
member of our staff can accompany you.

Sincerely yours,
William R. McDaniel
