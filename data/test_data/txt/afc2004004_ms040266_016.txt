Dear Alan,
I thank you for your
letter and enclosure.
I am happy that little Miss McNeil
will get a pleasant surprise one
of these days, and I am sure when
she does, she'll be up that
Creachan brae like the wind 
to tell me about it. I am glad
also that Miss Morrison is to be in
one of your programmes. It would
never do to let he feel jealous
of Miss Morrison. Thank you
Alan, and God bless you.

?,
Annie Johnston
