Dear Mr. Spivacke:

Thank you for your letter of June 15. I would like to spend the
afternoon of Thursday, June 29, in the Library of Congress. Would
it be convenient if I called at your office between one-thirty and 
two on that date?

I understand that Mr. Lomax is here today, and I expect to have a 
talk with him later on.

Very truly yours,
R. P. Wetherald
