RHYTHMIC ACTIVITIES

Little children can only walk, hop, skip, gallop, slide or run to music,
therefore, do not teach special steps, but use rhythms that will arouse a desire for
self-expression. The mood and story of the songs are expressed in the rhythm play.
Let them do "what the music says" as a result, activities will grow from the urge of
music. Free rhythmic activities will have the greatest value in the first three
grades and use only such singing games as have words and music calling for much
activity. The leader should try to determine at what age a game will give the greatest
pleasure and most results, thus centering each at the point of greatest value.
