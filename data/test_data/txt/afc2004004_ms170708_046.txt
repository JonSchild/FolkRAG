Kennedy: Would you like to give us that one?
Cox: Well, I'll try, if I can think of it now. I don't know. I may
get hung up somewhere. I'll see if I can think of that.

One day as I was walkin' down by a riverside,
There I espied a pretty fair maid, an' the tears fell from her eyes.
Last night was a dark an' stormy night, an' these words said to me,
"My love is on the raging sea, bound for Amerikee."

My parents they had riches great, John Riley he was poor.
And because - 

That's wrong. I'm wrong. (pause) I'm wrong now.
Kennedy: My parents. . . ?
Cox: 
John Riley - 
My parents they had riches great, John Riley he was poor.
'Cause I loved John Riley, the one that me adore.

No, that's wrong. I know what it is now.

John Riley was my true love's name, he lived down by the sea - by the quay,
About the finest young man that ever you did see.
My parents they had riches great, John Riley he was poor,
Because I loved John Riley, the one that me adore.

(pause)

John Riley was my true love's name, he lived down by the quay,
An' about the finest young man as ever you did see.

My parents they had -

No, that's wrong. That's wrong now. "My                                he
was poor." That's wrong.
Kennedy: What's the one about the - The Bold Fisherman. Isn't that,
Down by a riverside. . .?
Cox: Oh, yeah.
Kennedy: I'd love to hear that one.
Cox: I'd love to hear that one.
