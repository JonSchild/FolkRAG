Jokes We Can Do Without

Many people crack jokes about the war, 
about Hitler, Mussolini, Hirothio and many
other things that concern warfare.
But as far as this war is concerned there is
nothing under God's sun to joke about.
Surely everybody, mainly our soldiers, sailors
and marines enjoy and need a few jokes here 
and there to keep up the moral, and to get
our minds off war.
I know most of us, in, fact all of us dislike
Hitler and his bunch, and are hurt deeply 
by his treacherous killings and murders
and while we're waiting for him to be conquerde 
we like to joke about we imnagine our 
boys are doing to him, But this certainly is 
nothing to joke or laugh about we must fight 
and pray very hard to win this war.
Some jokes are funny, some not so funny 
some are immoral, unquotable, some are clean 
and cheerful, but [know] no matter how funny 
there are or how they make you feel it can’t 
win this war, especially a joke about war.  
A joke never has won a war never has won any
war, and they won’t win this one.
