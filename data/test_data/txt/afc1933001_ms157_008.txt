MAY 16, 1940

Dear Alan-Lomax,

   I cannot thank you enough for the labor and effort in
getting to me the list to be added to the June issue of PROCEEDINGS.
Fearing lest Professor Peach might think it un-clear., I spent the hours after
receiving it in making a complete copy, then dashed the original And the
copy into the mails.  Professor Peach said this addition would exceed the budget
allowed him for the June issue; that he will have to announce your list will be
published in September.  What a grand list it is!  I had led him to believe
it might be large, but it was beyond what he could plan for.  Had we had it
earlier, something already in the press might have been shortened.  Anyway, just in
typing a copy, I realized what a list and what a labor it was and I wish to
emphasize my appreciation and also my delight that you had so many items from
such good singers.

   About two weeks ago I visited the Brandon singer, who is over 80.  She
welcomed me most cordially and meeting her was such a pleasant experience, to say
nothing of hearing and recording songs, that I thank you very much for putting
me in touch with her.  Her daughter had said "either she will sing for you or she
won't" and neighbors of whom we asked the way, asked if she knew we were coming,
"because she is queer."  None of this showed up.  I was with her some two or three
hours and Miss Olney most of the next day, because I had to drive on to speak at
Goddard College.  I'm convinced that Miss Olney can do a major job in collecting,
now.  She has a long list of songs from a singer in Jeffrey and Mrs Sullivan has
recalled many more than she seemed likely to come across with, although we had
from her the longest list we had made in Vermont.  It leads me to think her
eligible to the fieldwork you had thought Mr. Jennings might do.  If there is
a prospect that a Vermonter should be, this summer, collector for the Library of
Congress with a machine they furnish, and the expenses of such work, I would strongly
propose Miss Olney.  For the lifting, probably a student from one of our colleges
on W P A funds might be furnished.  Miss Olney drives a car.  There is work for
me and work for another collector--preferably with a better machine than mine.
When Dr Spivacke told me of the Carnegie grant to the Library, I have thought
him direct, as well, but I have in mind that you know Miss Olney's nature and
abilities, and will tell him what you think, in this plan.

Sincerely yours,

Helen Hartness Flanders
