INTERVIEW WITH S. L. MANGHAM (Continued)

(This visit to Mr. Mangham was made with the purpose to question him more
closely on his music interests.)

The only musical group in which I am interested now is the Harmony
Club.  It has thirty members, most of them are members of choirs of the churches
in town.  It is not confined to singing, but it is also a social club.  We
meet and have a social affair once a month.  We have plays occasionally, but
singing is paramount.  We have to give them something else to keep them interested.  
The music they sing is semi-classical and spirituals.  They would
rather sing semi-classical music, but people went spirituals.  These white
people mostly want spirituals.  One problem with a group like this is that it
is always changing.  There are only six or eight of the original group founded
fifteen years ago now in the group. For that reason we can't attempt anything
difficult.  The things we do have to be easy and popular.
(In reply to the question concerning the type of music played by
the bands in the early part of the century, he went indoors and brought out
the books he had preserved.  He explained that they bought sheet music and
bought the blank books and pasted them in.)
Pieces in the book were listed by title.
