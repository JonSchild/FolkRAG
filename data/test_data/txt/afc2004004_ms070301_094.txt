The policeman said I'll fetch him
up, it will cost him three pond
I'll summons him for trespassing all
on the squire's ground.
But when the squire came to know
he laughed & held his side
He often joked with the landry
maid which never did deny'd

When the keeper's wife she came to know
in frolics she was keen,
She [send] sent the keeper's britches to
the landry-maid to clean
But the landry maid did
naught but laugh saying all
jokes they must go free
She took no affront and the britches
burnt (burnt) which ended
all the  spree.
