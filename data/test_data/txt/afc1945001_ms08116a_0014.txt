Tuskegee Institute - Sophomore - Negro Female

Discussion between several enlisted men
who are aviation mechanics and flying
officers.

When are you leaving Lt? (Enlisted man)
We're just like the bear we ain't going nowhere
Hilter or Tajo doesn't want to see 
our faces - maybe if we would
bleach we could get some where.
Enlisted Man - Just what do you mean Lt?
Their is absolutely no place for us
to go. In other words they just don't 
want us. (Flying Officer)
Enlisted man - Why don't they want you?
Are you good?
Flying Officer - That's it we're too damn 
good.
