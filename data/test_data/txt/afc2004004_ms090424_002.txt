 make me satisfied-  papa can't make me --  mama can't
 make me--  nobody can't make me--

"Sometime"

There's a good old man-  sometime-  sitting in the corner â€”
smoking his pipe---  his cob pipe----  his castille----
in New Orleans---   over and over

Is played by going from one person in the ring to partner in 
the center, and continuing to next person in ring and alternating.
