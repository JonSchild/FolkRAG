gonna be anybody speaking French anymore, and that's bad.
You know, I seen they had some old guy and his son, they
went to a place and they didn't know how to speak in
English, they bought some food.  When they came to pay, they
had to go in the kitchen, in the cafe and point at what they
wanted, and that don't make sense at all, when everybody
around here is supposed to be speaking French.  But I
understood something about the French language like over
here.  Our French.  And you go around New Iberia and 
Genrette, those places there, it's French, but they got
diffrent words to some diffrent type of thing.  Then I
notice in France, its the same type of thing.  Like you know
that probably.  The old languages-you can speak one language
in French and then you meet some other people further down
somewheres else.  They got a different whatever you call it,
a dialect.

Is the Black French that's you and Bois-Sec speak, is that
different from the Cajun?
CANRAY
No.  It's the same.  And you take, when you get around New
Iberia, Genrette, them places there.  The white and the
black is the same language like we are around here.  Like,
let's see, over here, we talking about we gonna go
somewhere.  The way Alphonse and I and the white, we gonna
say "On va. . .(french phrase)"  And over there in New Iberia
and those place there they gonna say "On va coulee".
A. LOMAX
Listen, would you play us two or three of your favorite
tunes and sing a little bit?  To end off our little session
today?
CANRAY

A. LOMAX
Oh you know, two or three of things that you want to do.
