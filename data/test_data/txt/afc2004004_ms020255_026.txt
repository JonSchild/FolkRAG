start a-playin'.  Now maybe they jus' be wich your fingers; I
don't know.  But they say it's really true.  Say you can learn to
play organ, piana, anything.  Jus' at that.  But you uses them
certain words, ya see.  An' ah. . .
TL:  What do you say?
BJ:  I don' know what all they say, but I know you got to use
"God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost," an' an' whatcha
wanna do.  I know that.  An' nen (then) they say "Sure -- As sure
as God's sun shall rise."  See, the sun is got to be in, see.  An'
then you, then you ask certain questions.  
      Say, but they say anything that you want to go from you, if
it's a disobedient person, ya take that finger an' ya turn to
the south -- I mean to the wes' an' you carry it from you.  See?

do that, an' then, an' ah, dis, ah, whatever it is will go from
ya.

can feel it.  You can feel your fingers.  You can feel your fingers
give, for everything.  An' you can. . .
