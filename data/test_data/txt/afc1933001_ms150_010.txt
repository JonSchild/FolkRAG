Mt.Pleasant, Michigan

Dear Dr. Beck:

I am preparing a series of non-commercial
broadcasts on American folk music for the Columbia
Broadcasting System's American School of the Air. One
of the programs will be devoted to songs and ballads
of lumbermen. Rickaby, in his book,"Ballads and Songs
of the Shanty-Boy," writes of Billy Allen. Can you tell
me if there has been anything further written about him,
and if the origin of The Little Brown Bulls is definitely
known? Are there any biographies, diaries, or stories
about lumberjacks that would contain more than straight
informational material about the process of lumbering
and would give more about the men and their recreations?

I would appreciate any references you might
be able to send me. 

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song.

[*There is nothing further known of Billy Allen so far as I 
know. Stewart Holbrook's HOLY OLD MACKINAW is the best 
lumberjack book I know, and it is fairly authoritative.
If you haven't read it, you have missed a treat.
Lewis Torrent, Hackley High School,Muskegon,Mich., will
be happy to answer any of your questions. He is the youngest 
son of one of Michigan's pine barons, and he knows the ways 
of the lumberwoods. Paddy Miles, Big Rapids,Mich., has
written something of what you want and it was printed in the
newspapers. He probably will send you a clipping. You may
use my name when writing to them if you care to. Also Bill
Duchaine, Escanaba Press, Escanaba,Mich., may have some clippings
for you.
