     It's not so cruel.  Then too again, it's a terrific
feelin.
     (You think it's something cruel to the woman?)
     Well. . .It's jes a bad feelin.  For you know, jes like
if you stick a splinter in yo han, that hurts, don't it?  Well, you
know jes bout what I'm talkin bout then.
     (You think then that a male organ is like a splinter,
or something that hurts you?)
     I see I have to come plain to you, seein you don't
un derstand what I mean.  You take a young girl that come up an nevah
knowed nothin bout a man in huh life, an give huhsef to a man to be
used fur his satisfaction.  Well, you know, quite naturally, you
know, she's tight.  Now you know that.  Now she couldn't jes lay theah
an take it with all ease.
     (There might be something painful i n it that one time.
But do you regard this as something that might be generally painful
to a female?)
     Not as much as it would to huh.  That hurts.  You see, if
it was jes tight at the end, aftah you got in, it would be all
right.  But it's tight all the way up.  An if it's tight all the way
up, it hurt all the way up.  See what I'm talkin about?
     (But if the man and woman are the same siz. . . ?)
     Naw.  They're not the same size.
     (You would think they could be fitted together, since
that's the scheme of nature. . . ?)
     Naw. That's not the same size.
     (You think men are much bigger than women?)
     Yeah.  You see, heah's the thing about it.  You take a 
woman that nevah have had a man in huh life.  It's gon hurt huh an
him too.  It's gon hurt him too.  But it's gon hurt huh wuss.
