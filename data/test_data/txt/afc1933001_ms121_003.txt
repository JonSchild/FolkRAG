May 15, 1937

Dear Reiser:

I hope that Revoli explained why I didn't come out to see 
you before I left Haiti.  It was a question of either making the 
boat to New York or seeing you and naturally the deal had to go 
against you.  As Revoli may or may not have told you, our last 
week in Haiti went so fast and furiously that during the last 
four or five nights none of us scarcely slept a wink.  Zandor, 
Martinique, Wou etc., ....June 25, 1937 
I must begin another set of apologies almost a month later.  I 
have been helping father edit the revised edition of his Cowboy 
Songs, working about twelve hours a day and have had no time to 
think about Haiti or my obligations to you.  But the manuscript 
went away in the mails a day or so ago and I have caught up on 
my sleep, and this morning have made for you a couple of duplicate 
records of some things I thought you might like to remember.  I'll 
send these two records under separate cover and leave the customs 
officials to you.  It is the only sort of present I can afford to 
give you now, since my salary here at the Library has not begun to 
come in and Chavella and I are living at the bottoms of our pocketbooks, 
but I hope you will feel that the records show my appreciation 
of the way you helped me in all my straits.  Later on, when 
the Library installs a really good duplicating device, I'll send 
you some duplicates we both can feel proud of; but at present 
these are the best we can produce and are emphatically not for 
public display but for the pleasure of Cecile, Anna, Don Fred, 
Ciceron, Lieutenant Auguste, George, Madame Theoline, and yourself.  
I have tried to calculate what would give the most people 
the most pleasure.  If there is something essential that I haven't 
sent, write me and I'll be glad to supply it.

Elisabeth and I had an exciting time on our departure from 
Haiti.  After a frantic morning, we finally got all our parcels 
on the Haiti, just as she was lifting her moorings.  At Cap Haitien, 
we stayed overlong at the Citadel, and on reaching the wharf, waw 
the propeller beating up the white at the Haiti's stern.  Luckily 
for us, an American yacht happened to be in the harbor and her master 
at that moment ascending the wharf from his little runabout.  
He popped us in this speed boat, and we ran the Haiti down and managed 
to make her slow up enough so that we could leap from deck to ladder. As you can imagine, we were persona non grata to the officers 
for some time.  At Port de Paix we showed Calixte's letter to 
the Port officials and were taken on a tour of the town, whichwas
