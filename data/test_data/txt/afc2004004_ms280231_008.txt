"And the little girls had numerous songs for accompanying their 
games, like. . . 

Poor Mary sat a-weeping, a-weeping, a-weeping, 
Poor Mary sat a weeping on a bight summer's day. 
O Mary what you weeping for? 
I'm weeping for me lover. . . . 

"And when the boys were choosing sides, they would all swing 
their arms to a rhythmic chant, and those that finished with their 
palms upwards would be counted out until finally the numbers 
were reduced to one person whose palms were facing down. . . 
FLIP - FLAP - FLOP - BANG!
"In our street the policeman was looked upon as the enemy of the 
children, and they had songs about him. . ." 

On the Croft, on the Croft, 
Where we played pitch and toss, 
Till a copper come and chased us away, 
So I got a piece of lead and I hit him on the head, 
And the sly little beggar ran away. 

"At November, the kids would go from door to door for some kins 
of Xmas treat. . . 

"Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat, 
Please put a penny in the old man's hat. 
If you haven't got a penny, a ha'penny will do, 
If you haven't got a hapenny, God Bless YOU! 

"And the little girls would play a game bouncing the ball and 
cocking one leg over it. . . 

One, two, three o'Leary, 
Four, five, six o'Leary, 
7, 8, 9, O'Leary, 
10 O'Leary catch the ball! 

"And a number of songs about soldiers. . . 

When I was young I used to be 
As fine a man as ever you'd see, 
The Prince of Wales he said to me 
"Come and join the British Army." 
Toodle-oodle-oodle-loo, 
Me curses on the labout [layabout] brew, 
That took me darling boy from you 
To join the British army.
