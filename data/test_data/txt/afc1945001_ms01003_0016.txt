[*Rumors.*]

Report on Assignment dated April 1st:--

Mr. MacLeish asked all Board members to discuss 
with Mr. Bell any propaganda rumors that have come
to their attention.



[*Apr 9*] The problem of rumor identification and collection
was discussed with Ulric Bell and he was told that the Bureau
of Intelligence does not at this time have reliable rumor 
collection facilities. For Bureau of Liaison purposes it was
agreed that certain general rumors known to be prevalent would
be brought into focus for detailed treatment in magazines
anxious to cooperate in the counter-propaganda effort.
