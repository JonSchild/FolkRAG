TAPE: R-5 cont. Appalachia 17
[*Hard to understand*] like the (?) on each side of me. But I was by myself,
my soul was.... looking down at it

AL: But you weren't scared though.
Ray: Was you feeling good, Caz? Was there any pain about you?
Caz: I don't know how long they kept me up there, kept my soul
and spirit up there, but it warms, put it back in there you know?
My soul's cold, coming out to get warm.......Now it's cold.
AL: But you don't belong to a church or anything., you're 
all by yourself in what you believe?
Caz: I'm by myself. What I believe in I believe in myself and
don't have to have nobody tell me. I believe in God, of course,
I believe in Christ. I seen him. That ain't no lie.
AL: But you don't believe in preachers and people that sell
their religion.
