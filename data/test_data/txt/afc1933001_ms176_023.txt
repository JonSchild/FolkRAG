Dear Mr. Lomax:    Re: FOLK SONG FILMS

Last summer, Willard Van Dyke and I started a little project 
for the production of films dealing with American Folk Songs.  The modest
budget and cooperative basis cause us to go into production at odd times
in accordance with the spare time of cast and crew;  Accordingly, although
we were in correspondence with you, we just couldn't work things out in the 
first file so that we could collaborate with you. 

The first one (one reel) called TALL TALES, is ready for 
distribution to the non-theatrical field. It will also open at the Belmont
Theatre in New York City within ten days on the program with Steinbeck's 
"The Forgotten Village".

Our plan is to distribute TALL TALES during this winter and 
spring and judge from results as to whether to try to set up a more ambitious
project for a series of films. We are aware of many errors in the 
first one and hope to gather opinions which will help us improve the next
ones. 

We would like to ship you a 16mm print for screening, and 
comment.  It would be very helpful if you could find the time, when next
you get to New York, to discuss the possibilities of working with us as 
consultant for the future productions. 

If you could see your way clear to writing a very brief
Forward to TALL TALES, we would love to use it in the film for its non-theatrical 
release. We would use the introduction right away on a flier
and in the film. The objective of the Foreword should be to stress the place
of American Folk Songs in the history of our country, and to tie in a reference
to the "tall tale" type of song. 

The songs are:  'Strawberry Roan', 'Grey Goose', and 'John 
Henry'. The cast is Burl Ives, Josh White, Winston O'Keefe and Will Geer. 

I hope you will tell us to ship a print immediately and that 
you will help us with a Foreword. 

Sincerely yours, 
BRANDON FILMS, INC.
