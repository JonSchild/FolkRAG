Why can't the women get silk
stockings from Japan? 'Cause they
got all the worms in the Army.

Why couldn't the Nazi (pronounced
nasty) goose produce the
golden eggs?  Because it didn't 
have the propaganda.

Sergeant with the imprint of a
kiss on his cheek walks in his home
saying, "Sorry I'm late dear, but I had
orders to keep in close touch with the
general's daughter at her coming out party."

Williams Field, Ariz.  A soldier,
disturbed over a personal affair, picked up
the phone & in his excitement dialed the
wrong number.  When the party answered, 
the irritated chap began voicing his woes.
   "Wait a minute," the voice on the other
end interrupted.  "Do you know who you
are talking to?"
"No," replied the soldier.
   The voice then informed him that he 
was talking to Col. Bridget, the Commanding
Officer.  There was silence.
   Then the private asked, "Sir do you 
know who are talking to?"
   "No," replied the Col.
