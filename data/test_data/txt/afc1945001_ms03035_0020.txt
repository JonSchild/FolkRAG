Mr. William H. Webber
Office of War Information

Dear Mr. Webber:

Referring to your letter of October 3 on the persons co-operating
in the recent rumor collection, we had the assistance of the
following:

Dentists: Dr. Robert S. Gregory, 22010 Michigan Avenue, Dearborn Mich.
Dr. D. Ballinger, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Mich.

Drug Store: Mrs. Thomas Cogan, proprietor, Oakwood Pharmacy,
301 Oakwood Blvd., Detroit Mich.

Policemen: Police Commissioner John H. Witherspoon, Detroit, Mich.

Chamber of Commerce: Harvey Campbell, executive vice-president,
Detroit Board of Commerce, Lafayette Blvd., Detroit Mich.

Labor: Frank Davis, president, Lincoln Local No. 900, UAW-CIO,
7335 Livernois Avenue, employed at Lincoln Motor Company

Beauty Parlor: Charles of the Ritz (manager, Comer Syprett),
Himelhoch Bros., Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Mich.
Bert M. Grim, 308 W. Grand Blvd., Detroit, Mich.

In no case was there any objection to continued cooperation, but
because of the unfruitful collection by drug store and Board of
Commerce it may be well to experiment with a drugstore in another
area and a Board of Commerce perhaps located in some other city.

This kind of job requires careful handling. The job also will
necessitate sitting down and explaining the difference between
opinion and rumor, for despite the fact that as much interpretative 
material in your instructions as could be passed along was given to
those participating, results show inability to differentiate between
rumor and opinion.
