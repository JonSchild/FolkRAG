Mr. E. C. Ball
Rugby, Virginia

Dear Mr. Ball:

     I had not known of your request for records
before and I shall try to attend to them at once. The
difficulty is that we have no equipment for making
these duplicates and I cannot promise in this regard
without consultation with my superiors. If there is
further delay please know that I am doing the best I 
can for you. Your records have always been a pleasure
to have in our collection.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
