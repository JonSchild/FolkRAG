Miss Kay Dealy,
3315 North 16th Street,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Dear Miss Dealy:

I am going to Bucknell for Saturday,
Bryn Mawr on Sunday, and would like to
spend Monday with you and Granny in recording
her folk song material.

Let me know at once if that date is
possible for you or if Granny will sing
for me sola.

Very truly yours,

Alan Lomax
