I'm Alabama bound, 
I'm Alabama bound, 
Ef I don't sink or turn around, 
I' m Alabama bound. 

Oh, de preacher preached, (2) 
Great Godamighty, babe, 
An' de    an' de teacher teached. 

De preacher in de stan', 
Passed his hand around, 
An' de deacons in de amen corner holl'in', sweel gal, 
"I'm Alabam bound."  

Alabama bound, (2)
Ef I don't sink or turn around, 
I'm Alabama bound. 

On de road agin, (2) 
Ef I don' be lucky, boys, an' win, 
I'm on de road agin. 

He'p me sing dis song, (2) 
I want all you boys to know,
He'p me sing dis song. 

Oh, de preacher preached, 
Sister turned around, 
Oh, de deacons in de amen corner, holl'in', sweet gal, 
"I'm Alabam bound." 

Doncha want to go, (2) 
An' see the great big gulf, 
Of Mexico. 

I seed you comin', 
Ap'on in my han', 
I heered you  cryin',  "Have mercy, Lawd, governor,
On my man." 

Repeat eigth stanza. 

Wonch be like me, (2) 
Make out wid whiskey, drink yo' beer
An' let yo' wimmen be.
