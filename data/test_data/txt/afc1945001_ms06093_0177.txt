The following rumor was overheard on a Denver street car
when two women were talking over the war situation: "We are
patterning our Government after England in every war movement
even to the terms used by England. We now call our good old
American "bootlegging" the "Black Market" because that is what
it is called in England. We call our women's Auxiliary of the
Army the "WAAC's" because England has a "WAAC's" and of course
we will have to send our boys over to do England's fighting."
