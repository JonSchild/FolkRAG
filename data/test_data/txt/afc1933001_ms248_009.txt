Dear Alan:

Your letter of March 10 is one
more illustration of the high price
we have to pay for our Democracy -
delay, waste, passing the buck, futility.
What is needed at key points
is a few men - he-men - who aren't
afraid, to keep things moving. I
see no reason under heaven for
not referring your request to
Leon Henderson for his decision. That's 
what he is hired for. Your letter
was a good letter son, in fairness to
me, you might have mentioned
that I was giving my time, "free,
gratis and for nothing." Of course,
