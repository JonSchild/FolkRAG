DOIN' THE DEMONSTRATION
Words  Lewis Allan
Music   Earl Robinson

Listen to that sudden shout,
See the people start to sprout
Somethin's brewin'
Somethin's doin'
Hear them marching all about

Listen to that sudden Roar
Thousands strong and thousands more
There's a meetin'
On the street 'n
I know what that meeting' for

CHORUS

Now's the time to together 
This is anti-fascist weather
Save your  voice and good shoe-leather
For Doin' the Demonstration

Now's the time for all good people
Shout it out from every steeple
Til all who walk and talk and creep'll
Be Doin' the Demonstration

In Paris, London, and New York
It's takin' the world by storm
It's Shaking the sash
Offa Hitler's mustache
And the buttons of Goering's uniform

Oh won't it make a great sensation
When it hits a facist nation
The democratic population
Father
Mother
Sister
Brother
Cousin 
Baby
Uncle 
GRANDMAW

DOIN' THE DEMONSTRATION!
