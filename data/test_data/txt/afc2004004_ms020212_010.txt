Dear Friends,
I have just come back to the office after a one-week
 vacation and find a letter from Sid Davis
in Atlanta. Now he tells me that he does not
have the money to pay the group, so you will
not be going there after all. I am sorry the
date had to be cancelled like this, but there
was nothing we could do about it, since contracts 
had not been signed yet.

I'll write you both a longer letter when I
have more free time.

Love to the group,

Alan Lomax
