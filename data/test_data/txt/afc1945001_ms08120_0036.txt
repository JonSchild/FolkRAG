War Stories

The postman said, to a
lady "You had better buy your shoes
before APril, because tehre won't be
any leather soon for de feet."

Why does Hitler change
his stockings three times a day, be-
he smells de feet. 

Over the door there is
a sign saying "Fifty miles to
Gal." A man thinking it meant
fifty miles per gallon bought a
gallon, but he only got about eight
miles. He went back and asked
the gas man why. The gas man
said, "Fifty miles to Gallon,
Texas".
