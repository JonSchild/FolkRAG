Dear Mr. Whitlock
Received your letter and the enclosed articles that I had become anxious about guess I became to apprehensive about them but I know you understand why I was. now I am enclosing another article that I just received this week that was in a Wichita Paper a very good written article 
I think and when  you read it I want you to send it t this Aunt of mine who lives in San Francisco her address. Mrs. Virgie D. Barr-839 Post St.
Apt - 104 - San Francisco 9 - Calif c/o Fay L. Barr.

Now I am going to send [you to] her your letter and I am sure she can send you the information you want on how the words of this song should be now my self I perhapes sing them from memory and have no doubt got some of the words in wrong. I know you will enjoy hearing from her. She is the one mitioned in the last article  my fathers niece. she was raised in the family as her mother died when she was born. I will write to her at once so you will be hearing from her very soon.
