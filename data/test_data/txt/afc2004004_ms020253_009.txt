been doin' this thing.  Jezebel an' all that crowd, they all doin'
it.  All the spo'ts (sports), an' so they...The Law said, the Bible
speak of where they would polish they nails, see?  An' then they
would, uh, rouge they lips.  An' then, ya know...an' their face,
an' like that.  Well, that was the mark of who they were.  See, they
was spo'tin' women.  They'd go out to meet them, but a clean,
a pure, woman, they didn't do it, ya know?  A woman who kept herse'f

TL:  And this has always been that way, with everyone you've met, hum?

BJ:  Yeah, they would rouge -- but they meant for diffrunt things

your nails an' your lips an' things to be polished, He'd a made
'em boa'd or leather, one.  'Cause they, ya know.  He'd a put in
leather, or sumpin', on 'em.  An' that's why, you know one time
Moses was goin' in their talkin' -- he was talkin' to the Lawd,
