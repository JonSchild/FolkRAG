An' so anyway, he never got a chance to say anything to me.  
I didn' wash no more, see.   I was busy.   I was too busy to wash next

[went on] after that,   It went on I never did work for him never

offered Eva, [an' all] y'know, ten dollars.   Eva want me down then; she

evenin' -- because I wouldn't go, ya know.  An' she raise a 
                         She jus'       ; she jus' said; she jus' cussed out

[*potatoe picking*]
I worked at Mister Scott's.  Sometimes he would pick up potatoes.  
That was a man, a colored man named George Scott, had a lot of 
potatoes.  I'd go there an' he'p him pick up potatoes when I 
wa'n' doin' nothin, 'cause I just on'y worked to Clara's just one 
meal.   An' so anyhow, tha's jus' goin' out to he'pin' them.  
I picked those potatoes so Miss Alice would have plen'y.   I wouldn' 
even charge ['em] 'im.   I tol' 'er I'd pick up on halve, ya see?   An' 
so, I pick up so devlish many of 'em that I wouldn' take [the] all the 
[whole] half, you know, see.   'Cause we didn' -- Miss Alice didn' 
need so much, didn' ha' where to put 'em nohow.   An' then I gave 
to Catherine, I give her some nice potatoes.   He had a big field, 
[he did] a potatoes.  I pick 'em on halve, at least that way you can bury 'em, you
know.  But I didn' wanna   hid?   'em cause I knowed Miss Alice 
couldn't go see about 'em an' the people just eat 'um up, tha's 
all they would do.   An so anyway, I had a gre-at big box.   Almost 
like a piano box, jus' like that, an' I put a lot of straw 
in that box an' different ol' bark an' stuff, an' pack the potatoes
