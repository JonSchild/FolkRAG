in some cases the first lines.
A few others are: "Put your foot on the treddle and shout
for joy", and "You jes' as well git ready cause you got to die";
then "Lord I feel like I've got to go over Jordan", and "Didn't
you hear dat turtle dove moan, lightnin' flash, thunder roll?" (Good
one). "God Knows I'm the One Born by the Spirit" (not so old).
"It's Raining, Raining, Work on the Building for the Lord,". Then
more familiar ones are the following: "Hearse keep a-rollin', bell
keep tollin'; Somebody's dyin'," and "God's gonna build up Zion Wall."
A woman in town (through from the country) loves to sing and
act, "You got to clear the line before you call, coz, God is angry with
us all," etc. The same woman and her daughters sing, "Who Built the
Ark? Noah, Noah," etc, lots of verses and very interesting the way they
sing it. One verse facinates me, only I cannot write it:

I met a mister hypocrite de other day
He's always up and never down,
He's always right and never wrong,
Says jes' so the sinners lives, jes so he die,
Jes' so the tree fall, jes' so it lie.

My Lord, who built this ark", etc
But the rhythm's the thing and they call Noah, Nora, they need the r.
All these Negroes do not live in the same neighborhood, most of them
have met each other through me. Whenever I find one worth a song and a
voice I corral some of the others and get them to sing it together. So
they don't all sing the same songs well. Tho; they can catch on enough
to follow, but "Who Built the Ark" belongs to Mary Jane Travis.
