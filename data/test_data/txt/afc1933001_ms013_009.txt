My dear Mr. Lomax:
Thanks for your letter of the 13th and the interesting
report on your latest excursions.
I shall try to see Congressman Kleberg within
the near future and will tell him about the project.
I shall appreciate your keeping us posted on
your prospective tour, so that we may have your mail
or telegraphic address.
Faithfully yours,
Chief, Division of Music
