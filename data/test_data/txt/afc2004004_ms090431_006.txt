Fisk, 5. 3.
set my heart on fire.  Lord (Lord), Lord (all right), Lord, I'm not gonna
make it no more.  Oh, You promised You'd lead me (yeah).  Oh go over
here.  Oh, oh, (Lord), speak back in your plow.  Oh, yonder where there
are more in Christ (yeah), no more heartaches (yeah), no more sorrow.
Oh, get me home.  Let me sit down, rest for a minute, that's enough for 
me (all right).

Prayer by an Old Man.
Oh, I know my coming days, to cheer my dying hour, to triumph over [Mister] monster
Death and all its rightful power.  Joyful is all this drink I have, my
feeble lips do sing.  Where is thy boast and victory, great, and where,
Oh Death, thy sting?  It's in Your presence I come.  It's mydesire to 
pray, but I can't pray without Your help.  It's my desire to come to 
Thee, but I cannot come without Your assistance.  Because I can't get
myself in that childlike simplicity that would make my coming acceptable
to you.  But I [can] acknowledge that I have sinned by commission
as well as omission and You're so sympathetic, and You have so much
patience with me, and I must show from past ad present treatment from
You that if [You] we come and deny my sin and turn from The[e]m that You'll
own me again.  We'[ll]re [all] any here in Clarksdale and while we are here, we
all glad to know You're here, because we're walking with Yuh.
                        *               *                  *                    *
You calls me, and I call You.  Oh Lord, over here on business of the 
kingdom.  Oh, Lord, don't You let me pray to the people, but help me 
to pray to You this evening.  Oh Lord, for the people come to cotton
