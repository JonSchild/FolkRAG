Early Days

BOSQUE COUNTY

In the early days of central Texas, when the open prairies
were covered in the spring with tall, waving grass, intermingled with
a multitude of wild flowers, when in the lowlands along the streams
grew thick forests of oak, elm, pecan, cottonwood and willow trees,
all the water in the branches, creeks and rivers was beautifully clear.
Ploughing up the land and cutting down the trees have combined to stop
the flow of many of the small streams and to convert the lower ones into
long, muddy ditches. The beautiful gravelly shoals over which the water
gurgled at every bend are now usually covered deep in mud. Gone along
with the sparkling clear water are the schools of small fish that once
flashed and darted in the smallest brooks. You found them in the fountain
spring at the foot of a mountain where the trickle first started its
journey to the Gulf of Mexico. Old settlers called flowing water living
water. All water was living water in early Texas.

The Bosque River which splits Bosque County into halves, was once
the loveliest of all running water. From mouth to source it was fed
by many springs and small creeks from which gushed, except after heavy
rains, limpid water. So clear was the water of the Bosque that white
pebbles could be seen on the bottom fifteen feet down, easy marks for
young ambitious divers. Throughout its length a garland of trees marked
its course, the river "bottom" being from one to three miles across.
Hence the name, bosky, or treey. It waters were alive with fish, the
woods a harborage for squirrels, coons, 'possums, and rabbits, the region
a paradise for boys who loved to swim, fish, or hunt.
