RUMORS COLLECTED FROM AUGUST 9 TO 15, 1942

(To facilitate comparison, we have listed rumors in the same order, under the same subject headings, as in the first report, dated August 14.)

Great Britain
New Rochelle 8-14 (Businessman in station, seeing troop train.): "Those soldiers are going to Boston to sail for England. We are opening a second front the first week in September."
New York 8-9 (Stenographer): "Let's not fool ourselves about this war. We are taking it on the chin in behalf of England."
New York 8-14: "The British generals are cowardly, stupid aristocrats. If Rommel were in the British army he would still be a corporal."
Brooklyn 8-12 (Irish-American): "Don't make me laugh. The English are no more democratic than the Vanderbilts. Even the Germans have a more democratic army - that guy Rommel worked up from buck private."
New York 8-11 (Housewife): "My sister's boy is in New Caledonis. What's the sense in our Army guarding such a God forsaken place? The enemy has never been there. Nobody wants it." (Followed by description of place, then this comment): "Such islands are all held for the British. They want native slaves, so our boys are supposed to hold such places."
Yonkers 8-13: "The British stopped fighting the day we entered the war, and they won't start again as long as we are willing to do their dirty work."
