[*NEIGHBOR'S ATTITUDES TO 1ST BABY (THE KAKS)*]
BJ:     Umm, yeah, it was, I suppose. You k now, I didn' 
unnerstan'. See, I like to [eat] ate so much clay -- I like to
eat chalk, at that time -- an' I ate so much clay, they
(reeked clay off me, ha! ha!, when she was born. An' that
made it kind of a                     . I start -- it was all
night long. But I didn't have no doctor. Had a midwife. You
see. But I had a good one.
AL:     Were you scared?
BJ:     Scared? A course.
AL:     I mean, had your mother told you anything about...?
BJ:     Oh yeah, oh yeah. She tol' me good about how they
do it then. An' when the pains an' [them] ah come she sent and got
the midwife, an' she, she knew a good thing to give me -- to
he'p me release the pains, y'know, like that. But ya had to
come through it. An' ah, I just thought I was gonna die a' course
[(on the floor    ?)] there wasn't nothin' else...Mama thought
I was gonna die, too. They take her out [fro] to the gate, y'know,
to keep her from hearin' me, 'cause they thought I was gonna die.
[But] 'Cause I tol' em all, I tol' em all, I said, "I'm leavin' here." I 
knowed jus' as good -- I said, "I'm leavin' here." An' at the 
time I never thought I'd see my chile. I was standin' up right
out that bed; they couldn't keep me in there. I was much
strong. You know I had [a son] to send [to] get Cassius
to [have a home] help 'en hol' me. See, he hadn't [a had one'cause] held me I'd a broke
my [name to] neck or the chile's neck or sumpin'. So, anyhow, he [have one] help me, an' so. I tol'
'em, said, "I'm leavin' you." Ha, ha...an' it seemed like I 
was jus' goin'...jus' goin'...but, um, that was jus' it.
[An] An' then, what happened to me after that. Three days
after my chile was born, all the girls' round there -- you know
they wanted to see he baby, y'know. Of course. An, ah, all
the womens around there -- those days they raisin' girls to 
be kaks -- they call 'em kaks.
AL:     What that mean?
BJ:     Kak mean up-to-date girl. That don't know nothin 'bout no boy.
[man] A Kak is a girl that don't know nothin' about no man.
An' so, they was raisin' them girls to be kaks, you see? An' 
there was Ellen Sanders an' Emma Brown an' several more around
