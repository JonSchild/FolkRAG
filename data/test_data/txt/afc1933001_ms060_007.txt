Mr. John A. Lomax,
80 Wine Ave.,
Hyattsville, Md.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have your letter July 17th, and enclosed
herewith the ox-driving song, which I think is complete
with the exception of two lines of one verse, and it appears
that I cannot find anyone who knows these two lines. Perhaps
you can make up these two lines with words that will in some
way fit in. I have one other course that I am going to try
and would like to know when is the latest date you will have
to have this song, furthermore, I would like to know when you
are coming this way again as I would like to sing the song for
the record if it could be so arranged and would like in the
final wind-up to receive a record of this song.

I am glad you sent Sylvester Johnson a Bible.
John the Baptist is OK.

Sincerely yours,
HR Weaver
