     When I left Washington for the Great Lakes
States in the summer of 1938, my intention was to make
a [?] rapid reconnaisance survey of [all] three; Michigan,
Wisconsin and Minnesota.  When I returned in the first days
of November, I had [been able to look into many of the fascinating 
fields of folk music in Michigan] been able to complete a representative
sampling of most of the types of [folk-song] Michigan folk-song
and [do] no more than
visit local folk-lorists and collectors in Wisconsin and Minnesota.  
Michigan had proved [so to be the] itself to be the most
[complex most] richly varied area for folk music that I had ever
visited, combining as it did the lusty tradition of the Northern
woods singer with an infinitely varied pattern of immigrant
European, Indian, and even [Southern] Appalachian and [???????] Southern Negro
music.
