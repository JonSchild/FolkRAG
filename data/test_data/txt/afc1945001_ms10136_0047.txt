1. You could fly Uncle Sams fastest
pursuit plane
And man a 30 ton destroyer in attack
But the only trouble with you my boy
is your face will still be black
You could sit behind a desk at the
white house
And do it with diplomatic knack
But the only trouble with you my 
boy
Is that your face will always be 
black

Heres a toast to the Negro
In the good old land of the free
Where they sing God bless America
And hang you to a tree
They say that our rights are equal
Regardless of their race
And right around the corner
Jimcrow slaps you in the face
So let us drink this hearty cocktail
and raising our glasses on high
Take not the bitter cup from your lips
Till victory is won or we die
Socrates once said that
the recognition of ignorance
is the beginning of 
wisdom
