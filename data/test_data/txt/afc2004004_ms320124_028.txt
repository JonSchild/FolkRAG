always referred to in the [diminutive,] always referred to
as a second class thing, something to be forgotten,
something to be put on the shelf and, and the sooner it was
forgotten the better.
LOMAX  Just like hillbilly music. . .

dance hall where the people were only paying enough
attention to know when to put their next foot down while,

themselves in Newport, 1964, 17, 17,000 people, according to
Dewey Balfar, cheering and clapping, giving him standing

stuff that back home was considered nothing but Chinky
