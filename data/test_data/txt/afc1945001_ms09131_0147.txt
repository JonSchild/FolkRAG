1. The myth (Or is it?) that Schichllegruker has a 
large number of new sender [him] men under him who look
just like him so that in the event of his 
death or disappearance the next model in line 
could step up & fill his post.

2. Third party in American for 1944
Candidate: Eleanor Roosevelt.

3. A plane filled with many passengers of all 
different nations was having trouble getting
around high mountain. There was a Pole, 
a Finn, a Frenchman, an Italian, a 
Greek, and an Englishman in it. They
decided one of them would have to make the 
supreme sacrifice & jump out to lighten the 
weight of the load. 
The Pole went to the door and yelled, "Long 
live Poland!" & jumped out.  That wasn't 
enough so the Fin  followed suit. Soon 
the Frenchmen fell out crying "Vive la 
France!" Everything went smoothly but the 
plane was losing altitude soon again.
