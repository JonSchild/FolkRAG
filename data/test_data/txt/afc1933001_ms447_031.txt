Slowly, with deep melancholy

64. "Oh, bur - y me not on the lone prai - rie." These
words came low and morn-ful-ly From the pal - lid lips of a
youth who lay On his dy - ing bed at the close of day.

He had wailed in pain till o'er his brow Death's
shad-ows fast were gath-'ring now; He thought of his home and his
loved ones nigh As the cow-boys gath - ered to see him die.
