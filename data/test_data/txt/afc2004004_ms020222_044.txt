BJ TAPE 7C, p. 42

HE DONE JUST WHAT HE SAID

1) He done just what He said,
Yes, he did; yes, he did; 
He healed the sick and he raised the dead,

REFRAIN: Yes, he did; yes, he did;

CHORUS: Now, you can tell the world about this,
You can tell the nations that I'm blessed, 
Tell them what Jesus have done,
Tell them about the Comforter has come,
And he brought joy; yes, he brought joy
To my soul.

REPEAT VERSE #1 AND CHORUS

2) Before I stay in [Heaven] Hell a- one day, (REFRAIN)
I'll pray and shout my soul away, (REFRAIN) (CHORUS)

3) He done just what He said, (REFRAIN)
He raiseded Lazarus from the dead, (REFRAIN)
He stopped the sea (where the sun is raved ?), (REFRAIN)
A dying sinner He died to save, (REFRAIN) (CHORUS)
