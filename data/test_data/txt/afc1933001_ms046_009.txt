Mrs. Genevieve Chandler
Murrell's Inlet
South Carolina

My dear Mrs. Chandler:

Miss Terrell and I are starting South Thursday.  We are 
coming by easy stages and may not reach Murrell's Inlet before 
Friday afternoon late or sometime Saturday.  On second thought, 
it will be Saturday, or perhaps Sunday, since I want to come 
by Columbia to see Miss Montgomery and possibly make some records 
there.  Please do all the needful things in anticipation of our 
arrival and particularly look out for a comfortable room during 
our stay.  We'll talk about the stories and the pictures, etc., 
when I see you.

Yours sincerely,
