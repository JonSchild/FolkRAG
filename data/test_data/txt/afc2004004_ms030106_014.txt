[Jellyroll - No. 3]  (Steno. notes) after 1640A
14
When I was six months old, my god-mother would take me 
from my mother and in absence of mother would pass me off 
for her child. It seems like she got a special kick out of 
this because I was a very good looking baby. She helped to 
name me the christened name of Ferdinand, which was named 
after the king of Spain- but the king of Spain didn't do 
anything, it was the queen, Isabella.
One of these afternoons in borrowing the baby now known 
as Jellyroll Morton, she (was known to have) loaned me to one of her 
acquaintances, some type of sporting women. (She) This lady displayed me 
in saloons, setting me on the bar, and so forth and so on, etc. making [my] admirations. 
[*(?)*]She passed me as her baby. There, Through some kind of fracas 
or riot, she was arrested. The officers decided not to (take 
the baby and not) put the baby in jail with her and her associates, 
but she raised so much hell (and refused to relinquish 
the rights to her baby) and so that the young Ferdinand, which is named 
after the useless king of Spain, was thrown right in jail(.) 
(That is supposed to be me) at the age of six months.
The inmates were singing and making a lot of noise from 
time to time. It was there where young Ferdinand got his 
first musical inspiration. The inmates would be singing and
 as long as they would sing it would keep the baby happy, and 
the minute they would quit, I would go into a frantic rage 
[and] (but) when they would start up again and sing I would smile 
along with the singing. That was my first inspiration.
