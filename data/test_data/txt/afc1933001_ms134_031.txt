Attached is a memorandum from Mr. Alan Lomax suggesting that he be sent
to the Lake States - Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota - for a periods of 
two months to record folk songs for the Archive.  Mr. Lomax estimates the 
cost of this trip at $965.  I recommend that Mr. Lomax's request be granted 
and that the cost be charged to "Increase."
