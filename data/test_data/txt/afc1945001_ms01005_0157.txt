Movie on Rumors

I learned yesterday that Walt Disney will release in
two or three weeks an anti-rumor cartoon, called "Chicken Little."
Chicken Little, it seems, feels a drop of rain on his head and
cackles that "the sky is falling."  Soon the barnyard is in a
mess because of this rumor.

OWI may or may not, when its movie bureau has examined
the release, employ it as part of the anti-security or anti-rumor
campaign.
