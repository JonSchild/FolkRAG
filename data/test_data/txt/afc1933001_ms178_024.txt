Washington, D.C.

Dear Alan:

I am surprised that I have to write to you again regarding the check
which you issued to us on December 6, 1941 and which check was returned
because of insufficient funds in your bank account.

I felt that my first reminder would certainly cause you to immediately
issue a new check to cover the bad one.

In my letter of January 19th I also called your attention to the fact that
you owe us the sum of $20. for publicity, which was to be paid in connection
with your Newark, New Jersey engagement. This $20. is only part
of the total of $96.17 which you owe us for publicity.

As you know, we at present have no further lecture engagements booked for
you, and so I must request that you remit to us the full $96.17 at this
time.

We feel that we have been extremely lenient and cooperative with you, and
know that you will appreciate same and remit to us the total of $96.17,
which will cover the check and all publicity material.

Cordially,
Merritt H. Coleman
