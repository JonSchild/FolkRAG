Now you notice when this young man is playing
bluegrass gu - guitar, notice when the young
man is playing um fiddle here, he's gone back
almost to classical violin technique.  There's 
[*Bluegrass (cont)
(where?
check!)*]
no more raspy sound in the fiddle bow.  He's
producing incredible notes, number of notes
per second, with very short strokes - one note
per second - whereas with Tommy Jarrell and 
others, you get very much more of a blues
rhythmic type of playing.  And look at the banjo
player.  He's still again, and it's all in the
right hand - all in the right hand - with 
[*16.  11. 49*]
unbelievable speed.  But, ah, he's got a
fantastic ah kind of stop time syncopation
going for him that makes your breath stop.
It's really like seeing ah, a great black
jazz musician ah play the - ah,  you know, play
his horn. 

So ah, bluegrass is launched and ah it's as 
popular in East Germany and in Tokyo today as
it is here.  Country music, the favourite
music of the Australian Aborigine, and of ah, 
of the working class, the dispossessed class
everywhere.
