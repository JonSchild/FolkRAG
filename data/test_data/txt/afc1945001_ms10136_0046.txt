1. A gorilla was seen leaving the army
outfitting post. One soldier turned to the
other and asked how he got there. The
other replied "All I know is that he
passed his physical."
2. One of our former students wrote back giving a detailed account
of an experience he had at the Marine recruiting station. He
went to this center to volunteer his services playing with
the Marine band. The officer in charge told that the young
 man very frankly that they did not want Negroes in that
branch of the service. At this the young Negro lost his
temper and hit the white officer. He served a short jail
term. However he is now in service of the U.S. Navy
3. A friend of mine who has been in the army about two
months, wrote back saying some of the Negro sargeants
seem to go out of their way in being mean to the
newly inducted. It seemed the little bit of authority
had gone to their heads. He also mentioned the fact that
so many of the men were very illiterate and he had
to write several letters back home for them. This illiteracy and
ignorance seemed to be more dominant in the Negroes
from Mississippi.
