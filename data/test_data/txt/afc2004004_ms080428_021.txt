                                              cut.

          MAN                            This thing with Stanley is that, he
                                               plays the Dolls Harp [*Dulcimer*] and then does
                                               Starward mountain and that, there is
                                               a little devacation there we can do
                                               a little bit with mountain lyrics,
                                               Cripple Creek and that kind of thing
                                               and some of those songe that you 
                                               like a lot Ok?

          INTERVIEWER               Yes,  But with the,  I have great  
                                               difficulty following the, some of
                                               the Ray Hicks stories because they
                                               are,  I mean I have difficulty with
                                               the accent but it is also a very
                                               particular kind of language isn't 
                                               it?

         MAN                             Yes it is.  In fact one of the 
                                               leading experts on American speech
                                               thinks that Rays language is the 
                                               language that was spoken, or his
                                               accent is the accent of the original
                                               settlers [*Ray's language*] and I think we can put into
                                               the film an English speaker from out
                                               in the Norfolk broads, it is almost
                                               exactly like Ray Hicks speech. [*good sync*]  He
                                               has a sort of gulping glotal stops
                                               at the end of it, but that is not a
                                               nervous habit, that is an old time
                                               way of talking.
