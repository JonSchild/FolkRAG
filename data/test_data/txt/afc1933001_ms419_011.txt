BURL: I wrote to my mother to send me a knife,
For the lice and the chinches had threatened my life.

WOODY: The bugs, they swear if we don't give bail,
We're bound to get lousy in this lousy old jail.

BURL: As to gamblin' and stealin' I never shall fail,
And I don't give a durn fur lyin' in jail.

WOODY: And now I have come to the end of my song,
I'll leave it to the boys as I go along.

(CHORUS STRONG TWICE)

ANNC'R: With Woody's song of how he sung his way to a pardon from the Texas penitentiary, we bring to a close this visit to the lonesome old jailhouse in the company of Woodie Guthrie, Joshua White, Lead Belly, and Burl Ives. There isn't anything you see that Americans haven't made songs for including songs for opening penitentiary gates. And every Monday, Wednesday and Friday Night at this time, Columbia Broadcasting System will bring you a program about the songs and stories that the American people have made for their own amusement. The program is called, "BACK WHERE I COME FROM", and is written by Alan Lomax and Nicholas Ray, directed by Nicholas Ray.
