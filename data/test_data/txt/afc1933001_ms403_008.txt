threw us in and let us swim back to the boat. Music controlled our
lives and our home. Our father played the fiddle and mother the Jew's 
Harp. Of an evening we would all gather around and sing. We had a mighty
good time by ourselves but often other folks would gather on our stern deck
and we'd have a sure-enough jollification. As I said, we were blessed
with comical parents and many of my father's songs especially were nothing
but nonsense, just to be funny and make us laugh." Capt. Nye doesn't mind
getting along in years. He is a large, jolly old bachelor and says that
he is supposed in his old age as much by his ability to sing as by the
food that he eats. When I left him he cautioned me, "Remember these
songs and ballads are not to be abbreviated. To abbreviate [them] kills
them. Use the whole song or none at all. They are sacred to me for my
mother's grandmother sang many of them. Perhaps, though, you can't see
things just as I do. I'm not supposed to see as you do, for my mind is 
Canal."
