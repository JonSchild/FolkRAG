[66] I was in the publishing business.  Too much work for me to do.
Hired Harrison Smith.  The son of a gun was jealous of me and
wondered why I was making a lot of money.  I decided to form a
monopoly--decided to put my money behind a lot of bands.  Wanted
to make headquarters in Los Angeles.  Smith said he could type
but he couldn't.  I found later he couldn't do much counting
either--put him behind the music counter.  I was making arrangements
at this time and composing and I really needed it quiet.
He complained that when I kept the door closed, I was high-hat.
He didn't like the idea of his having to announce people.  I 
wanted him  to handle the headquarters in New York and I would give
him 50 per cent of the entire firm, but it must be in my name. 
I assured him I didn't want to make an office boy of him.

Everybody was writing to me for bands, radio, people were after
me and he was interested in doing me out of everything he could.
The manager of Brown, De Sylva, Henderson liked Smith.  Smith
was fooling around in publishing at the time.  Had a little office,
if you went in you had to go in first and back up to get out and
then go in again.  I finally kicked him out.  I had arranged the
contract as equal partners to show him I just needed some help and
to have confidential help--I wanted to give him a good break.

Used to drive him to Brooklyn.  He bumped into a man, an old man,
light complexion and he would be talking with this man and I would
have to wait.  Once I heard him: "Say, Harry (Smith), you know 
such and such a woman. She's no good.  If it wasn't for me, she
wouldn't have had a quarter.  But through me, [she's] she has some
trucks and is doing business with the subway."  He said: “You wait, in a month she won’t have anything.” He was a regular
powerful guy.  I was going to shoot him on sight any place I seen him.

Harrison would always stop at this place before going home.  He
said once that this woman we were talking about lost every cent
she had.  I started thinking about that.  I think he had this guy
working on me in the meantime.  Found out that Harrison was stealing
some of my tunes.  If you told him to rhyme "ham" he would
probably say "Pontchartrain".  He was the poorest excuse for talent
I ever seen.

Harrison was stealing stuff to give to Danny Winkler and the
De Sylva, Brown, Henderson firm.  I asked:  "What is the idea of
taking my music out of here and giving them to the music companies?"
I told him I had the record to prove it.  He was a liar that
wouldn't admit to anything was truthful.  I said the contract
didn't mean anything if you're not fair and I have the goods on
you.  "Now you in this firm to steal my material to sell for peanuts
for someone else and I'm trying to go in the millions.
"Why," he said, "all this stuff is in my name."  Fight started;
superintendent of the building was near and heard the brawl.
