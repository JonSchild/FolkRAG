When the derned ol' fools stampeded, — an'
t[o]' make the story brief,
I got yanked clear out the saddle, an'
the next I knowed, Bill, he
Was a-fightin' off them critters — kind o'
sprawled out over me.
Well, the rest is dim an' hazy, fer I'd
surely had a spill,
But I owes my life — Lord bless 'im! — 
to that same "Ten Dollar" Bill!

No, he ain't no raving beauty, but he's
got a heap o' sense — 
More 'an heaps o' these here humans —
without meanin' no offense.
He is guant an' lean an' wall-eyed —
just a runty, rusty scrub.
But I reckon how yuh're seein' where
he ain't no common club;
Heaps o' folks have tried t' ride 'im — not a
soul exceptin' me;
An' whenever I come nigh him, he's just
tickled fit[t] t' kill — 
Lord, I wouldn't take a thousand cash
for ol' Ten Dollar Bill!
