Fielding told on Tom Jones:

" I never did get in no trouble in Dallas an' I lived there eighteen 
years, in Dallas an' Fort Worth--'cept one time. Some ol' [whores] ho's tried
to do me sumpin'.  I'se in there wid 'em talkin' an' my buddy wid me,
boy by de name o' Bob Timmons. They ask me for some money, an' I say,
'Naw, I wouldn' give two bits for you.' That made 'em mad, look like,
When I started to leave, I went out down a long hall an' some o' them 
[whores] ho's come outa one door on this side an' some outa 'nother do' on that.
An' they had brick-bats an' ol' broken pieces o' chamber an' one ol' [whore]
ho' had an axe an' she was comin' down wid it on de head of a barrel--jus' 
achin' to cut my head off. They asks me, say, "Where you from anyway,
big boy, comin' in here an' talkin' like that? You mus' think you the 
president."

I had my h[i]an's up in de air an' I was thinkin' about mama an' papa an' my happy home an' I beg 'em, say, 'Please, let me off this time. I 
wasn' aimin' to make you mad. I'[m]se a stranger here an' don' mean no harm.
Please let me off.'

Dat ol' [whore] ho had d[o]e axe kep' comin' down on de barrel-head, 'Sho', boy, 
we goin' let you off,'lookin' like she want to put dat thing in me.
My buddy was standin' out de do' an' wasn' sayin' a thing. De [who's whores] ho's 
had me hemmed in an' I thought [dat was de las] it was my last. Den de ol' landlady
come out, thank de Lawd for her, an' tell 'em, 'Don' bodder de man. He
ignornat. He don' know no better. Let him go' long.' D[a]ey move back a 
little an' I lef' outa dere. I flew. Ain' been back dere since, neither,
ain' never saw those ol' [whores] ho's no mo'. An' I know 'xac'ly where dat
[whore] ho' house is, right down by de ol' Union depot in Dallas, Texas."
