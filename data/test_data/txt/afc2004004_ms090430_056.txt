The church is an important institution in Madison County. In addition 
to the Baptist and Methodist churches there is an active Seventh Day
Adventist group, with a school supported by this denomination. Young people
in this area appear to get certain recreational values from church activities
and even from the revivals. It does not appear, however, that this
release is related to any more deeply religious feelings and behavior then
are to be found in other areas. The church is in the young people's pattern
of recreation and many of them attend frequently, and particularly the night
services.

The Schools
In 1936-37, 74.8 per cent of the white and 75.7 per cent of the
Negro children 6 to 20 years of age were enrolled in school. White Negro enrollment
was slightly higher, the average daily attendance was lower. Average
daily attendance was 71.4 per cent of enrollment for Negro children and 78.6 
per cent for white children. The difference in the length of the school term
between white and Negro schools in Madison county is not large, and the length
of the term is only about 7 months in rural schools for both groups. In
1936-37 the elementary rural Negro schools has terms of 139 days and the
elementary rural white schools 141 days. In this respect Madison County compares
favorably with the rest of the state, the average term of Negro elementary
schools for the state being 127 days, or about 6 months. One Alabama
county reports a school term for Negro rural schools of only 90
days, or about 4 1/2 months, and for white elementary schools of 103 days. In
Huntsville the elementary Negro schools closely approximate a nine-month term.
The term for Negro and white elementary schools in Huntsville is the same,
176 days.
