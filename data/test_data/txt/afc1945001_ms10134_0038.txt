3/4
I was at the hairdresser last
night. My operator was talking
to some one about her [ ] son
being rejected from the army. She
said he weighed about 340 lbs and
the reason was because he never
disapated. He was [also] always in
bed [at] by nine or nine thirty.
   The operator's son told his mother
that other fellows there at the induction
center said "I certainly wish I were as
fat as you, since over weight is one
[ ] means of being rejected from
the army."
   Other customers in the beauty
shoppe were talking of the rationing
of canned goods. The said that was alright but
really they just didn't see why the
meat had to be rationed. After all why
should we help feed England when
they haven't paid their debts of world
war I. Still we give and give to England
and get nothing in return.
   From the language used by these 
people I think these people were not
educated - at least only to a small degree and
they expressed their ideas in a very crude
way.
