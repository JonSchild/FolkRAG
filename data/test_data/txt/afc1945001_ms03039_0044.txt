 a very bad effect on the farmers in the locality in which the statement was made
due to the fact that the farmers were fearful that the Army would take over their
farm and operate them and thereby deprive them of their property.

It is my opinion that this is the worse type of statement that a Selective Service man
could make because in my experience in coming in contact and talking with farmers
they are type that is willing to do anything that is necessary to help the war
effort but they do not feel like men in official positions such as Selective
Service should make such statements unless there is some basis for it.  A statement
like this may have such effect on the farmers that it would cause them to
slow up on producing all the products that they can in view of the fact that a 
rumor was started that their farms might be taken away from them.
