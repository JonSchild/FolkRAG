AL: What was your dream, Bessie?
BJ: You mean when I was small?
AL: Um-hum.
TL: The first one you were talkin' about.
BJ: You mean the first one I remember an' then it scared me. I 
dream about a buzzard. He was 'way up in the air. I reckon it's
a buzzard -- [he wa'] a great big ol' bird. 'Way up in the air.
An' he was callin' [me]: "I want 'Lizabeth. I want 'Lizabeth!"
An' I never will forgit that! I was lil'; [an'] I was scared to death.
I wan' -- All the next day I could see that ol' buzzard 'way up
in the air callin' me. He jus' flyin' overhead: "I want 'Lizabeth..."
     You know what I believe the causin' of that was? It was near
Christmas and and um, it's time for Sanny Claus, you know, to
come, which we believed Sanny Claus, you know. And so, then, um,
the, the...Some of the chilren dressed in some kinda funny --
some big chilren what knew there wa'n' no Sanny Claus -- they
dressed in some kinda funny clo'es an' they would come to the
window, you know, about, I guess a good while before then. But that
[it] was on my mind it was Sanny Claus at that winda. And they
shaken the winda an', an', an' asked 'em was 'Lizabeth in there,
ya know. " 'Lizabeth in there? 'Lizabeth in there?" [All far away] That funny way,
ya know, an' I could see all that lil' stuff all over their
face an' all? An' we just run. They [an'] called John Henry, you know,
diffrunt children that was in the house. An' that stay on my
mind. I b'lieve that's why I had that bad dream. That ol' 
bird was comin' down, hah, hah, a great big black thing. Hollerin'
