When [he] they overtaken him, he was dressed in black,
Put him on de train an' [he] brought him back; *
Taken him down to de Dallas jail,
Judge, he said, "I'll never fail."

First thing he done, he fell upon his knees,
Said, "Judge, I have murdered in de firs' degree."
De judge said, "Yes, no need of cryin',
You welser#get hangin' on your min'."

Billy the Weaver, chimley sweeper, **
He the man, rove through the lan';
You can always tell when he ain' satisfide,
He always catch some train an' ride.

*or "When he overtaken him, put hand-cuffs on my hands,
When he brought me back, says, "Ol' nigger, ain' you
de man?"

#L.B.'s own spelling of "well as to".
** According to Lead Belly "A chimley sweeper", is a murdering
man, who carries a knife and a pistol every day. [*The original
Billy smoked opium.*]
