JOHN PEEL

1. D' ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay?
D' ye ken John Peel at the break of day?
D' ye ken John Peel when he's far, rar away
With his hounds and his horn in the morning?

CHORUS - 'Twas the sound, tantara, tantara, tara, tara!
And the cry of his hounds which he oft times led,
For Peel's view halloo, halloo
Would waken the dad or a fox from his lair in the morning.

2. Yes, I ken John Peel and old Ruby too,
There were Ranter and Royal and Bellman and True,
From a find to a check, from a check to a view
From a view to a death in the morning.

CHORUS-

3. D' ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay.
Who at Trout beck lived in a by gone day?
D' ye ken John Peel, he is gone far away
We shall ne'er hear his voice in the morning

CHORUS-

WEARING OF THE GREEN

There's a shining little Island
And its people love it well,
A spote by nature gifted
With her most enduring spell
Like an em'rald set in sapphire,
With a diamond here and there,
It gleams across the water
With a charm beyond compare.

CHORUS - You will know it by the mountains
By the valleys and the fells,
By the lakes of sweet Killarney,
Where the blue of heaven dwells,
You will know it by the Shamrock,
Dearest emblem over seen,
And know its men and women by the
wearing of the green.

It is famed in song and story,
'Tis the found of wild romance,
The native home of minstelsy
Whose measures all entrance,
Tho' the bards who made such music
As the world can ne'er forget,
Are sleeping long in silence
Still their songs are living yet. 

CHORUS-
