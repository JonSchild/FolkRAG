sible for more deaths among Negroes than any other disease. Syphilis, pellagra,
diarrhea, and homicides are relatively much more important factors in Negro
mortality than in white mortality. The rate for syphilis has shown a rapid
increase within the last four years. This increase is largely statistical
and due to the recent campaign to diagnose and treat venereal diseases. In
1934 the rate per 100,000 population for Negroes was 5.2. In 1935 this rate
had increased almost seven-fold to 33.5. The years 1936 and 1937 saw further
increases of 52.3 and 62.8 per cent per 100,000 population. The white rate
during these four years increased from 3.4 per 100,000 population to 11.4 (1)

Syphilis is commonly referred to among the Negroes in the County as
"bad blood". One woman said of her neighbor:

You noticed how her face was all broke out with bumps,
that's bad blood, and this summer her legs were a sight --
just broke out in big sores. Well you can't 'spect to
run with any "low dog" and not get your blood bad.

Pellagra is a cause of death is three times as frequent among Negroes
as among whites. Diarrhea, like pellagra, is responsible for a much greater
number of deaths among Negroes than among whites. Within the last two years
there have been no deaths among whites attributed to this cause.

The present cultural instability of the younger Negro population
reflects itself conspicuously in the homicide rates. Homicides are responsible
for 22.4 per cent of 100,000 of deaths among Negroes and 2.9 per cent
among whites. (2) Negroes carry guns and knives and use these weapons freely
among themselves. A father, in frank and concerned comment about his chil-
