Down by the Maudlin Green:

1) It's here am I a sailor boy just newly come from sea,
My ship lies at the anchor in the harbour o' Dundee.
Your face it is the fairest that ever I have seen,
Fair maiden, will you walk with me down by the Maudlin Green?

2) With a roguish smile upon her face, the lass answered me & said,
"Kind sir, I'd go along with you, but you know that I'm afraid.
The paths they are so slipery and the night so cold and keen,
And you know it wouldn't do for me to fall down by the Maudlin Gn.

3) With some kind words and promises the lassie gied consent,
We wandered here, we wandered there all on pleasure bent.
Till after day we met aboot yon lovely scene,
I'm afraid the maid had mony's the fall down by the Madlin Green.

4) Soon my time for parting came, my ship she hoisted sail,
No longer could I meet any girl and tell a pleasant tale,
I sang farewell to old Dundee where I had happy been,
And I left my girl alone to walk down by the Maudlin Green.

5)  As I lay in my berth one night when weary watch was done,
I dreamt I was the father of a darling little son,
And there his mother, there it's plainly could be seen,
For she was weeping bitterly down by the Maudlin green.

6) But when my boat's put in again at the harbour o' Dundee,
I'll search the town all up and down, for my girl I can see,
I'll ask her to forgive me, for a rascal I have been,
And we will make it up again doon by the Maudlin Green.

7)  Come all you jolly young sailor boys, a warning take from me,
Never douch a poor young girl and leave her in poverty,
To court a girl, then sail away, it's neither calm nor clean,
And never do as I have done down by the Maudlin Green.

Lomax: What does "douch" mean?
McBeth: To knock her down - keep her down in low estate.
Lomax: It doesn't mean to have intercourse with her?
McBeth: Oh no, no.  It means to keep her in poverty, in ragged 
state.  It means like - leave her in a state of despair.
Lomax:  Where is the song from?
McBeath:  It belongs to Dundee that song.  About a sailor boy.
In fact it originated in Dundee.
Lomax:  Do you know who wrote it?
McBeth:  Oh I don't know who was the author of that song.  It's an
old ballad - but it's not a bothy ballad.  It's a sea-going song -
a sailor's song.  But it's an old Scots song - an old ballad.
