Your mother's a very nice woman, but
she has flower on her face & her house
is full of novels & novels are full 
of un truthes - she couldn't have
been more than 8 or 9 at the time.
This was the little girl who had
eaten herself under the table
at the birthday party.
Sins - 
Putting yr face out of the
house

That same little girl from the time of 18
months used to be taken into communion
& held there for 5 hours.
