My lef' eye jumpin'
An' my right eye standin' still
They's something goin' on wrong
And I don' know what it is 
-
If I was a catfish
Swimmin' in the deep blue sea
I'd have all you women
Fishin' after me 
#
Lord I went & I layed head my head on some of r r track 
I got to thinkin bout Black Mattie
and, I had to snatch it back
Well, the sun gon [don t] shine in my
back do' some day
An' the wind gon' [blow] rise & blow 
my blues away
-
Say, I low you pretty mama, I tell
the world I do
I don' love nobody in this whole
roun' worl' but you
