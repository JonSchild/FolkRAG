Billy de Weaver

(L.B.'s version of the ballad written down by Martha, his wife.)

My dear kind friend, mighty glad I met you,
I got something to tell you, don't let it fret you,
I say your wife and another fellow,
Standing on the corner mighty clost together.

What they was doing I could[o]ent see,
When they say mai they broke and run from me,
It was late last night when he made his around,
He found his baby and he blowed her down.

Then he went home and he went to bed,
Put his pistol right under his head,
He could[o]en lay down for dreamin' and he coulden sleep for crying,
The woman he murdered keep worring his mind.

Put on his shoes and his overcoat,
"The deed I done is a hell of a note,
It ain't no need of me hanging around,
I better ketch some train and leave this town."

He went depo, look upon the sign,
The train he rides is marked upon time.
He caught the train and it run so slow
The sherrif overtaken him in Jerryco.

When he owtaken him, he was dressed in black,
Put him on the train and brought him back.
Taken him down to the Dallas jail,
Judge, he said,"I'll never fail."

First thing he done, he fell upon his knees,
Said, "Judge. I have murdered in the first degree."
The judge said,"Yes no need of crying.
You welser [*(well sit)*] get hanging on your mind."

Billy the Weaver , chimlely sweeper,
He the man that rove through the land.
You can always tell [when] whinhe aint satisfide,
He always catches some train and ride.
