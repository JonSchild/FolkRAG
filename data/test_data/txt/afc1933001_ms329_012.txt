The drunken poem.

1
Cathren was a hoering gal.
That come from san antone.
She had a stocking cont.
And a tong of hair and bone.
2
Peg Davis drifted from the south
With Bains and Grants townsend.
And said he had been a horing boy
In his hot glambling land.
3
I will Fuck that horing girl said he.
For just a ten spot round.
I will Fuck her till she does her best.
To pitch out the bed on the the ground.
4
We jerke her trousers from her ass.
And said that hoe unwon.
She hit a star trail for the roof.
Then pitch out the bed on the ground.
