Dear Mr. Baumeister:

You recently filmed the Sea Island Singers for a
documentary in the South.  As their city friend
and non-paid manager, I strongly feel that your
offer should be higher, especially because they
are poor people and should not be exploited without
adequate compensation.  I suggest a fee of $100.
I am holding the contract which they sent me until 
I hear from you.

Yours sincerely,

Alan Lomax
