He had watched me writing and drawing [pictures] for fifteen
minutes 
A minute later he was gone like
a squall & with him half the crowd.
The dance stopped.  He had said, "You
got to cut out all that shit. For Christ's
sake what's the matter here. You people's
so dumb you give the white man a chair
to sit and write down everything the nigger
does in Haiti. You got to cut out all this shit
etc." Revoli took me by the elbow and we went
from there, Revoli explaining that we'd have a fight
on our hands if we didn't. Everyone was protesting
that the man was nothing and that I should
pay no attention to the incident, but they were scared.
It was Friday night and in [the] Aux Cayes bamboches
are permitted only on Sat & Sunday nights. Everything, 
except the Congo rhythm, seemed degenerate
to me. Possession, x so serious & not so seriously
considered. The tambours flimsy and tinny, poorly
made. The hounfort of one dirty, disorderly room.
The altar with only a few pebbles and no offerings
of wine to the loi --The old mombo had kept
back most of the 5 gds for her own use, at least
she served very little liquor to the crowd. --
