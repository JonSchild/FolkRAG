Dear Alan:

As you will note by the letterhead, I am no longer at
NRB, but they have forwarded on to me your letter
of March 26th.

Unfortunately, I am not in a position to handle this
for you at this time, and so I am returning both your
check and the proposed contracts.  In any event, in
order to copyright this material you must have a
transcript of it to file.

I hope to see you very soon.

Warmest regards,
[* Paul *]
