Monsieur le Colonel:
Mr. Alan J. Lomax of our staff is about
to visit Haiti on a special mission for the Library
in connection with its Archive of Folk-Song. Although
he carries a general letter of introduction,
I understand that he would especially benefit by a
particular one to yourself.
Trusting that, should he have occasion
to seek your good offices, you may be able to extend
them, I beg to be
Faithfully yours,
Herbert Putnam

Colonel Andre,
Garde d'Haiti
