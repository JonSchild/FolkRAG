Dear Professor Cox,
                                  In compiling the second volume of American Ballads and Folk Songs
my son and I plan to include a version of "The Vance Song" collected a summer ago
in Kentucky. The text version of this is, however, incomplete, and I write to ask
your permission to reprint five or six of the stanzas from your book. We will cer-
tainly appreciate your help on that score.
                                                                                                 Very sincerely yours,
                                                                                                  John A. Lomax
                                                                                                  Curator of Folk Song
                                                                                                  Library of Congress

        King regards always to you,

July 28, 1939.
   Dear Mr. Lomax:
                                    It gives me genuine
    pleasure to grant this request.
                                    Sincerely yours,
                                            John H. Cox.
