which would aid a commentator, or could you give references
for those you would send which I could probably obtain
either in the Evanston or Chicago music collection?

4. Can your records be played on any victrola or would we
need a playback or other kind of machine?

5. Are there expenses connected with borrowing your records
which have to be considered?

As arranging a Ballad Hour and publicity for it will take careful advance
planning if it is to be well done. I will be most grateful for as prompt
a reply as possible.

I will welcome other suggestions for a public library's use of your
ballad collection either during Book Week, at Christmas, or in connection
with some other nationally observed week or day if my idea is not practical
and you have other ideas which are.

Sincerely yours,

Beatrice Sawyer Rossell
