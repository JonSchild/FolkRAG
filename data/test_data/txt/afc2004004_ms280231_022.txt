REEL 12: HAMISH HENDERSON.
John McLean:
1)  Hey, Mac, did ye see them as ye come down by Gorgie,
Awa' o'er the Lammerlaw and North of the Tay,
Yon man is coming and the whole town is turning out,
We're all sure he'll win back to Glasga the day.
But joiners and hodders are all marching frae Clydebank,
Come on, noo, and hear him, he'll be ower thrang yo bide,
Turn oot John and Jimmy, leave your cranes and your muckle gantries,
Great John McLean's coming back to the Clyde.

2)  Argyle Street and London Road's the route that we're marching,
The lads frae the Broomielaw are here tae a man,
Hi, Neil, whaur's your hadarums, you big hieland cheuchter,
Get your pipes, man, and march at the head of the clan.
Hullo, Pat Malone, sure I knew you'd be here so,
The red and the green, lad, we'll wear side by side.
Gorbals is his the day, and Glasga belongs to him,
Great John McLean's coming back to the Clyde.

3)  Forward to Glasga Green, we'll march in good order,
Will grips his banner well, that boy isna blate,
Aye there, man, that's Johnnie noo, that's him there, the bonny fighter,
Lenin's his fiere, lad, and Liebknecht's his mate.
Take tent when he's speaking, for they'll mind what he said here,
In Glasgie, oor city, and the whole world beside.
Och, hey lad, the scarlet's bonny, here's tae ye hieland Schonny,
Our John McLean's coming back to the Clyde.

4)  O weel, when it's finished, I'm awa' back to Springburn,
Come hame to your tea, John, we'll soon hae ye fed,               
It's hard work, the speakin, och, I'm sure he'll be tired the nicht,
I'll sleep on the flair, Mac, and gie John the bed.
The whole city's quiet now, it kens that he's resting,
At hame wi' his Glasga friends, their fame and their pride,
The red will be worn my lads, and Scotland will march again,
Now great John McLean's come back to the Clyde.

"Saw Ye the Cotton Spinners", which is a song of the 1848 rising
is a song which has its origins very very early in  Scottish hisory.
You could find words for it from nearly every period. It's a vry
old song. The words that come to mind most readily of an earlier
period are the Jacobite words: -
Who wadna fecht for Charlie, who wadan draw the sword,
Who wadna up and rally as the royal prince's word.
