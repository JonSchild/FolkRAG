An' it had a whirl in it, ya know.  That water was comin' an'
goin' -- goin' to the river, somewhere.  An' big ol' creek; call
it Battle Creek.
       An' ah, an' I hit the heel!  Aw, I mean you talk about somebody
runnin', but my bow legs wen' up there runnin'.   I wen' up
that heel (HILL). . . !   An' when I looked back, the peoples, you
could see 'em divin' in that water.   Them boys was gettin' in that
water.   'Cause, see, when she hit over here, she went straight on
under, under that bridge.   It's a good thing it wasn't a long --
co'se them boys would caught 'er, though.   [It's]There's some swimmers
around there.  They got 'er out.
       I reckon, by the time she out, I was home.  I wen' home.  I
tol' Mama.  Mama [said] said, "What the matter?"  I told 'er.  An'
so, then, she wan'ed know where 'Lizabeth was. I looked down the
road; that excitement was down there.  Everybody was goin' down
to see what's the matter!  Ol' Car-- I throwed her in that water!
       An' so! They got 'er out.  She -- You know, I don't know
whether they rolled 'er or whatnot, but they got 'er out, before
she got too much water in 'er.  An' then they take 'er an' carried
her; comin' home she was wet as a rat when they passed by there.
       Mama ain't never whipped me about it or said anything about
it.  'Lizabeth told 'er how it was.  An' so.
       An' they tol' Mr., Mr. Winters, her, her father. An' he whipped
her.  He sho' did; he whipped her good.  'Cause he didn't know this
was goin' on, all the time, ya know.  She was pickin' on me.  An'
he didn't 'low it, ya see?  An' he give her a good whippin'.  An'
say -- [AFTER an'] after' all that time an' near drownin' she
got. . . !   Well, she. . .she ain' never. . .Huh?
TL:    She got whipped, too.
