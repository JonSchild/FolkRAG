At a certain army camp one
morning, a husky sergeant walked
up to a group of men and said
"I want some volunteers to do
a little work for me."  Two men
stepped forward.  This led to
the volunteering of three more men.
The sergeant looked at the
these men and told them,
"You volunteers go over there
in the shade and take it easy.
And you others, get busy and
clean up this mess around
here and then help the cook."
