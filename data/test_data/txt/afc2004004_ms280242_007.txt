TAPE 88A- DAVIE STEWART.
Davy: It's a wee story with fairies you'd like to hear?
Anne: Yes.
Lomax: But a real one from the old people. Not from a book.
Davy: This is real and true I'm telling your girilie. Now this
wee story I'm going to tell ye happened way back about 70 or 80
years ago. It happened away in the highlands of Perthshire.
There was a woman and a man and they was tinkers, you know, and 
the man was a tall young man and he had two little children. A
wee girl aged about 6 and a wee boy about 3 years old. And the 
man was a very good piper and he wore a kilt - hieland dress. And
the woman, she was hawking with her basket, going to big houses
and getting sometimes tea and sugar from the ladies of big houses,
bread and stuff. But they'd an old pony and cart, and they were
camping at a place called Pitlochrie, that's in Perthshire.
Anne: They were camping, they weren't living in a cottage?
Davy: No no, just camping out. And the man used to go away playing
the pipes all day, with his kilt and his hieland dress - he was
a good piper and a good looking young man - and the woman was a
good looking woman herself, young woman. And she says, "Johnny,"
In the morning you should go and play the town of Pitlochrie and 
get a few schillings," she says. "It always helps."
"I will," he says. "What are you going to do?"
"O," she says, "I'll go myself and I'll get as much as will keep
us over Sunday for the children."
     So the man gets his kilt and his hieland dress on, and tunes
his pipes at the camp in the morning before he left and kissed
his wife. "Are you on the road?"
"Aye," she says.
"Well, come on. I'll see you to the road then." So they went
together down the road - they'd four miles to go to town, you see,
and they're camping at an old hill, a sort of ruin, and there's
no houses at all on this road. They were camping way out among
the whims and the brackens. There was no houses at all up this
road. Moors and hills, like. The town was down below in the
valley, this town of Porthockrie. It's a hielandmplace.
     Now it being a fine summer's day - it was a Saturday - and
the man and the woman goes away down the road with a basket,
and she leaves the bairns at the camp. There's some other woman,
an older woman, but no friend of their's at all. "O," she says,
"Mary, I'll watch your bairns."
"Alright," she says. So she just took one bairn, the laddie, with
her, because some of the people would pity a wee boy and give
him some clothes and stuff. So, coming near the town the man says,
"I'll stop and play all the big houses first, and I'll play the
big hotels after" and he says, "I'll meet you at the end of the
