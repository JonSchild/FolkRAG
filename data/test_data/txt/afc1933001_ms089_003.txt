the last time stating that he was glad to
say that payment would be made soon.

All along, however, it seemed that
because I had made such a large
number of records (the best in all my career for interest and quality, 
I believe), I stand to lose what I had paid out
for singers, machine repairs, rental on 
batteries, etc., etc â€” expenses absolutely necessary 
for securing any records whatever.
But in every statement made to me by
Miss Rogers, Mr. Waters and yourself I
was told that there was some balance in
the account that I should certainly receive.
The amount I paid out for
the Library was approximately $150 00

Will you please take up this 
matter afresh and let me know what 
you can do about it. Alan was in
no way involved in the transaction.

Always sincerely, John A. Lomax
