Uncle Cavy Crockett Ward 
(seated above) has many a night 
played his fiddle while his wife 
(standing beside him) sang the 
old ballads of the mountains. 
Uncle Crockett is a huge man, 
broad of shoulder, but his big 
hands and blunt fingers can bring 
fine music out of the fiddle. He 
plays second fiddle with the "Bog 
Trotters." Mrs. Ward doesn't sing 
with the group now-a-days quite 
so often as she used to, but she 
knows scores of the old songs with 
which many a family frolic has
 been regaled. 

LOCALE AND TIME 
BASIS FOR NAME

Ballard Creek Bog Trotters 
Just Got Together

The wail of a pair of fiddles, 
scraping together on "Sugar Hill" 
and "Fall on Your Knees," with 
a woman's voice singing clear the 
words of the old songs, comes from 
the little board house on the banks 
of Ballard creek in the mountains 
of Southwestern Virginia.

The fiddlers are Uncle Alec Dunford
from up the road half a mile,
and Davey Crockett Ward, and the
time was 15 years of more ago.
Next Tuesday the pair of old-
timers will put their "Bog Trotters"
on the air for thousands of listeners
to Columbia's American
School of the Air (WDBJ-CBS,
9:15-9:45 a.m., eastern standard
time).

Just Got Together

That evening was just like many
another winter evening of those
years, not long after Uncle Alec
had moved down on Ballard creek.
Uncle Alec was a fiddler and
Crockett Ward was a fiddler, and
when the new neighbors got together
they found they had learned
a good many of the same old tunes.
Crockett Ward's wife was one of
the best ballad singers in that
country, and his brother, Wade,
could strum a banjo, and his son,
Fields, was learning a new-fangled
guitar.

Everybody could play or sing or
tell some of the old tales, for when
the family gathered around the
stove on those winter evenings,
everybody contributed something.

These old ballads and nonsense
songs and dance tunes which outsiders
have been making such a
fuss over these last few years are
just a part of his life to Uncle Alec
Dunford.  Perhaps that's why this
grizzled mountaineer was chosen
from all the hundreds of fiddlers
and ballad singers up and down
the Appalachian range to interpret
"squar' dance" tunes on
January 9 to the thousands of
listeners to Columbia's American
School of the Air to be broadcast
from WDBJ studios Tuesday.

Born in Hills

uncle Alec was born and is growing
old in those mountains of
Southwest Virginia.  And since he
was eight he has been playing the
fiddle and learning from this singer
and that the old tunes of his
people and the new ones they make
up for entertainment or to perpetuate
some event which has stirred
the depths of community life.

Grizzled, bald, his face deeply
lined with kindly wrinkles, Uncle
Alec is typical of his generation in
those regions. His speech is an 
exceedingly slow drawl, with accent
broad and preserving a strong flavor
of the Scottish dialect of his
forefathers.

Times have changed in the
mountains during Uncle Alec's
days. The section is rapidly losing
its distinctive characteristics.  The
region received wide publicity some
27 years ago when the Allen clan
shot up the court at Hillsville, 13
miles from Galax when Uncle Alec
lives killing the judge, the prosecutor,
and the sheriff, a juror, and a
spectator. The Norfolk and Western 
railroad sent a branch line into
that territory, a furniture factory
was built at Galax and textile mill
at nearby Fries. And now the great
Blue Ridge parkway, scenic drive
from Northern Virginia down the
crest of the Blue Ridge into western
North Carolina, is rapidly
nearing completion and passes not
far from Galax.

The people have changed with
the changing times, too, Uncle Alec
says. They don't sing the old tunes
and dance as they used to.

"That's the fust thing I can
rememberâ€”the old time music
a-bein' played," he says. "When I
was a-growin' up." and he tells of 
the home frolics where all the family
and the neighbors gathered on 
winter evening, and everybody
played and sang or recited something,
or cut a dance for the rest
to applaud.

Not In Their Feet Now

"It just don't seem to be in the
young one's feet now-a-days," Uncle
Alec comments.

Uncle Alec lives just outside the
town of Galax, which takes its
name from the abundance of the
evergreen plant, galax, in that
region.

Many of the older listeners who
hear him and his "Bog Trotters" on
the American School of the Air
January 9 already have heard Uncle
Alec play, and sing though he has
never been on the air before.  In
the twenties, when mountain tunes
first came into general popularity,
Uncle Alec played and sang many
of them for several phonograph
companies, and says his record of
the Irish ballad, "Barney McCoy,"
sold half a million copies. Royal-
