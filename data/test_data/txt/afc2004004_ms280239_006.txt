And I would say "Yes." "Oh well," he says, I'll sort them
for you in a fewminutes." And of course, all these people
were very expert at these, that are necessary for carrying
on life, as you might say, mending boots, or mending anything---
they could give him a hand to it. As a matter of fact, I could
do it myself when I was 14 or 15. I could sew a patch on a
shoe or anything like that. But the jobs I couldn't do, I went
to somebody who could do, and he would even leave what he was
doing himself, he would stop it and he would do the thing that
I wanted done. And I went home quite happy. And well, perhaps 
I could do something else for him in return. If there was a
sheep lost on the hills, or anything of that, and I was a young 
boy and he was an old man, well, I went with my dog to try and
find that sheep for him. And that was all in the day's running.
And at the time of shearing sheep, or the like of that, well, 
the young fellows they liked the job and they only wanted just
an opportunity of doing it.

Lomax:  Was there any such thing as hunger ? Did people go hungry ?

Calum:  Well, I don't know of it. No, I cannot say there was.
And if it was known that anyone was hungry, he wouldn't be
hungry for long. The neighbours would provide. I'be never known
a time when there was general hunger. No - I don't think anybody
ever really suffered from hunger. The times were hard, certainly,
but I don't think anybody would suffer from hunger in a
community like was in the Isles when I was a boy. It would be
unthinkable for anybody to feel hungry and others having something
that would help him.

Lomax:  Was there ever any crime in the Islands at all. Was
there any violence ? Was there -- do you remember a murder or
a------,?

Calum:  No. no.

Lomax:  Or a fight ?

Calum: Well, fights were quite a natural thing at times in those
days. They had ,...well, especially on market days, well, all
differences were settled. Fights were quite common when they
got --- when they got some whiskey in their insides and the
rougher element of them got the upper hand, so to speak. Oh, yes,
I. . . .

Lomax:  What would they fight about ? Girls ? Or....

Calum:  Oh, about any thing at all, just differences of opinion.
You see....
