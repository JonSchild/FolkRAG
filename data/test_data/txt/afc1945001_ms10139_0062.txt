1. Hitler was being interviewed by some foreign correspondents on
his country estate. As they were walking along they came to rather
deep gully. The first correspondent went down into the gully
and came up with his fingers holding his nose because
there was a skunk in the gully. The second correspondent
followed suit and also came up with is fingers holding
his nose. When Hitler turn came to cross the gully he went
down into the same. The skunk came up holding its
nose.
