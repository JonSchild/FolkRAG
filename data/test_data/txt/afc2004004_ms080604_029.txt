(laughs)

A.L.:
            And what would happen after you sing that
song?

W.B.:
            Well, some of em was like I was.
A.L.:
            Yeah?. . .

W.B.:
            Some of em was like I was.  If I didn't feel
like goin, I didn't go, you know.  I was just that crazy, you
know.  I felt I like I was bad and fast as anybody toted a
gun, you know.  And I been like that all a my life.  I don't
meet nobody no faster than me, and I'm 66 years old.  I don't
tote a gun now.  But, when I was in levee camps, --you know
like you'd get up, they didn't have no bathrooms or nothin,
you know.  Yo would have to get up to go outdoors at night.
And if I got to went outdoors, I carried my pistol.  And if
anything happened, somebody found somebody -- or somebody
found somebody soon, you know.

A.L.:
            Push the trigger and tell the hammer to hurry!

W.B.:
            Oh yeah!  And I was shootin a thumb-cocker, and
I could shoot as fast as a double-action.  I could slap it
just as fast as anybody.  Just like that.  You ain't got to do
nothin but just hold that trigger and knock that hammer back,
you know.  It's gon fire every time it falls.  You know, I was
in Last Chance, Arkansas.

A.L.:
            Where was that?
W.B.:
            Last Chance, Arkansas.  They had a levee camp
--like that levee set there(points ahead), like these
buildings over behind the levee-- that's where the camp sit.
Over behind the levee.  And I had just got there, it was
payday, and they was gambling.  And man, you found women's
clothes, meal, flour, sugar, coffee and everything.  They
decided to shootin, and folks started to run out back up
