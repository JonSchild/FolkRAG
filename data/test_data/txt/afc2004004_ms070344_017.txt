Donald O'Sullivan - spare, grey, ascetic,
two [amplifiers?] to hear well, really knows
Gaelic folksong, libel suit over
book review, when listening to Kitey of
Loves almost told love story, wonderful
editor, bad poet, disappointed over
political career has done a number
of unpractical books while he has 
a perfect headful of knowledge of a
wonderful sort about the most 
delightful musical love in the world.
