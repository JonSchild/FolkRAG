Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads

them "doughguts."  The next step, as any linguist will agree, would
be "dogies."  So the late Captain George W. Saunders, who was head
of the San Antonio stock yards for many years, once explained to me.
Cowboy Songs [made known] popularized the word "dogies" and first printed the
expression "Git along, little dogies," most familiar from its use in The
Last Round Up.  N. Howard Thorpe of New
Mexico holds to the opinion that
dogie came from the Spanish word
dougal, meaning the short tie rope [to 
for] to keep the young calf away
from its mother while the family
milk is taken. [to] Popular usage
transform the word dougal to the
calf itself.  Hence "dogie."  [Perhaps?]
Indian sake.

of "Whoopie ti yi-yo"]

The East has met the West in Cowboy song literature, and has
sucked up its treasures, except perhaps a vagrant melody here and
there and now and then a fresh couplet to such a song as The Old
Chisholm Trail.  Only a few million acre ranches yet survive. The
trail drives ended with the discovery of barb wire and the coming of a
sea of nesters who ploughed up the plains.  Broadway now produces 
cowboy songs 
attempting to interpret this life.
The West now at all.  But as long as red blood
runs the rough words and the plaintive lonely notes found in some of
the old tunes will move the heart of man.
