Ross Lockridge,
 Union Building,
 Bloomington, Indiana.

Dear Mr. Lockridge,

          Your contacts in Indiana proved most useful to me
and your letters of introduction made my path a very smooth one.  I
only regret that I had to hurry back to Washington so soon and did not
have time to purse more of the many leads I had in Indiana and to in-
spect the folk-song material on file with the Writers Project in
Indianapolis.  You are certainly well liked and much admired over the
state and your letters were open sesames to the homes of the folk-singers.
When I return to Indiana, I hope to be able to express my appreciation 
for your efforts in behalf of the Archive personally.

                                                                              Sincerely yours,


                                                                              Alan Lomax
