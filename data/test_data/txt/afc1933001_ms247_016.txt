scrawls and reply to my direct 
queries.
4. To tell me what you like best 
in the records we [are] have forwarded.
Some are faultily recorded, due
in most cases, I think to varying
degrees of loudness in these 
new records you have sent us.
We found 78 revolutions got the 
best results.  I [there] hope you 
will enjoy Frank Goodwyn's 
King Ranch Mexicans.
5. For the typed notes and catalogue
your thanks are due direct - in 
a special letter - to Miss Terrill.
And by all means you should 
send - special letter to each of 
the main performers. 
Lovingly always,
Father
