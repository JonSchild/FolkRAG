down here a minute!"  and he got down.  "God, but Ray, that's
sour would honey!"  And so we walked up the hill and there was 
this big red cedar.  (unitelligible sentence) It got one hive of
bees in there, a swarm we called it.  It swarmed and there's
hives all in that tree.  And it come a hurricane or tornado thru,
a day or two before it busted it.  And doggone it was running a
(unint.) of honey down that hive!  And I got tickled off of it.
I got tickled and staggered over and I's tall, 6'7", and I
staggered over, and there's a shrub bush about 3 or 4 foot higher
'an my head and I knocked it laughing, and hell, they fell
flitters (?) off to eat the honey with! God. . .you talk about

And there was around fifty ducks was swimmin' in that river,
and he said "But damn Ray, I got to have them!"  I said, How
in the devil are we gonna get them."  Well we got our shoestrings
out and felt into our pockets, we had some other string in our
pockets.  He tied them together and tied his (brichet?) legs
and said "I'll swim under there and tie their legs together and
they won't know!"  And he got under that water and swimmed
under there, and got 'me tied together.  And when he come up
amongst that bunch of ducks that'd be a quackin' and hollerin'
and 'wound up and he had all 50 of 'em tied up, wound
together!  And his britches, when he was standin' there talkin'
he britch lookd (unint.) quackbkbkbk, and let em out and
had 35 (unint.) of fish settin' in there while he was on to that!
