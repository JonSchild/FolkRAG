     ELIZABETH STRYKER studied voice at the New Orleans 
Conservatory of Music and Dramatic Art.
     She was born in Chicago, tho practically her whole life has
been spent in New Orleans.
     Miss Stryker received her grammar and high school education
at Miss Louise McGehee's Private School for Girls in New Orleans.
     A Southerner by adoption, in this select school she was able
to absorb all the influences, customs, historical background and traditions
of the old South and the unique French and Spanish influence
of America's Most Interesting City.
     With this background she has made a specialty of Southern
songs and is prepared to give a program of the Negro and White
Spirituals, the Bayou Songs of the deep South, the beautiful songs of
Stephen Foster, and many others typical of the French, Spanish and
Negro songs that have made Louisiana and the southern state unique
in musical history.
     Miss Stryker is prepared to appear in costume such as is worn 
by the belles of Natchez in the pilgrimage of the Original Natchez
Garden Club typifying the life of the old romantic South.
