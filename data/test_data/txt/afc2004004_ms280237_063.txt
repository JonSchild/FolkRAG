bull was comin' - I felt somethin' funny for a minute there.
This old bull was comin' along, runnin' along, blowin' a snout,
an' there was I hangin' on this here bit o' wood tryin' to get
over there, an' I couldn't get over.  I - then I woke up - I was
certainly glad I woke up, for he right agen me.  He'd a had me.
My hat, talk about feelin' funny.  That put the change over you,
I tell you; I was a-scrattin' there, tryin' to get this bar
[?] out of the way.  I should ha' done it if he'd let me a-went.
I was goin' to run past him, an' he turned round.  He come
snorin' an' blowin'; I - I ran as fast as I could, an' I - I
couldn't get over.  I hung on this here bit of wood, kickin'
there.  I couldn't get over.  Never did get over.  Then I woke up
like, after that.
Lomax: That's a damn funny...
Cox: That made me feel somethin' funny, he damn near got me.  Do.
That it did.  (pause) That made me - you know, I - how you feel
when you wake up (pause)
Lomax: That's a very interesting dream Harry.  Do you happen to
remember any more?
Cox: No.  That frightened me, I tell you.  I still remember that
bugger, 'cause that was - that sort of scared me.  I was
certainly glad when I woke out of that.
Lomax: Wonder what that means?
Cox: - don't know.  That's somethin' in your mind, or somethin';
it ain't workin' right. They tell you they don't
I don't know.  You go some way about sometimes in that
time, don't you? (pause)
