Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am glad to hear from you again, and regret that I did
not get to see you and your wife while you were in these
parts.

I appreciate what you tell me of Mrs. Griffin. I plan to
go to see her sometime soon, and I shall take, as you suggest,
a copy of a publication in which I have used her name. I
regret that her kinsfolk have misled her in the belief that
we are all making gobs of money off our folk-song collecting.
So far as I am concerned, my collecting has been a constant
outlay with nothing at all coming in.

And now about the song. I shall be glad to have you use the
song which you speak of in your letter. The only one which
I should not like for you to include is the "King's Love
Letter" ("Lord Derwentwater").

I have passed my preliminary orals at Chapel Hill and plan
to return next year to finish my work for the doctorate grind
if it is at all possible. At the present time I am doing my
best to master the German language sufficiently to pass the
reading knowledge examination.

If perchance you should come through Florida again this summer,
be sure to look me up. I should enjoy talking with you again
concerning our common interests.

With warmest personal regards, I am

Sincerely yours,
Alton C. Morris
