Assistant, Archives of American Song
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

   We have in our magazine a section of "Interesting People in the
American Scene," in which we carry stories and photographs of Americans
who are engaged in interesting and unusual activities.  We would like to
use a story on your work in recording American folk songs, and we feel
that a picture of you making a recording in a typical mountain cabin,
by the fireside, would be most appealing.

   Since we have photographers in all parts of the country, we could
take a picture of this sort on your next trip to the mountain country.
Will you let us know when you plan to leave Washington on your next tour,
and if you have an itinerary we would like to see it, so that we might
get in touch with one of our photographers and arrange for this picture.
We would like to use this as soon as possible.

   Do you by any chance have any pictures of this sort in your files?
Perhaps something would be available, and if it is, will you let us see
any previously unpublished prints along these lines?

Sincerely yours,

Eleanor Stierhem
Interesting People Section
