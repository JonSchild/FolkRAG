The Ram of Darby (cont).

The wool growed on this ram's back
It growed into the sky
The eagle built her nest in it
For I heard the young ones cry.

The man that butchered this ram, sir
Was up to his knees in blood
The man that held the basin
Got washed away in the flood.

The blood did run twenty-four miles, sir
(I'm sure it run no more.)
It turned an over-shot mill, sir
That never was turned before.

The man that owned this ram, sir
He got very rich
The man that wrote this song, sir
Is a lying son of a bitch.

CHORUS:
Father de riddle (Fol? sounded like father to me!)
     "         "     "
Father de riddle de ri do!
"            "     "          "   "    "
