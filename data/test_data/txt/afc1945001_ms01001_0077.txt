Some of the rumors reinforce general anxieties, for example,
the most obvious one which serves to diminish confidence in our security:
On August 10th, this was heard in Montclair, New Jersey.

"I really have this information thoroughly substantiated.
A German submarine recently was captured and there was
found on it a fresh loaf of bread with a wrapper from a
Mantauk, Long Island, New York, bakery."

On August 11th, this was heard in Columbia, South Carolina:

"A German submarine was captured off the Carolina coast.
On the submarine were found loaves of bread in wrappers
from a Charleston, South Carolina bakery.  In the pockets
of the crew were found stubs from the Victory Theater in
Charleston, South Carolina."

On August 12th, this was heard on a train on route from Atlanta to
Birmingham:

"In the pockets of the crew of a German submarine captured
in the Gulf of Mexico were a menu from the St. Charles
Hotel in New Orleans and stubs from a movie theater in 
New Orleans."

The Rumor Clinic Column in the Boston Sunday Herald on August 23rd, carried
the following:

"I think the newspapers should have published the news 
two weeks or so ago of a submarine landing its men on
Fishers Island (off Long Island) -- raiding attempted
perhaps.  Also, as I heard it, they were all captured.
In one week I heard it from four people, once or twice 
removed from someone who knew directly of it.  A few
days later an officer said there were tickets stuck in
one of the German's pockets from a play running in New
York.  Also American bread on board."

The latter column also includes the statement from the Naval Office of
Public Relations in Boston:

"Someday, someplace, somebody will really catch up with
this submarine with a crew that possesses tickets of admission 
to local theaters and has on board bread distributed
by local baking concerns.  This same submarine has
been reported from dozens of points on the coast , points
as far removed as Bar Harbor, Maine and Galveston, Texas.
It might be interesting to turn back the pages of history,
and note that the same 'submarine,' fully outfitted with
theater tickets and other material furnished 'locally'
made the rumor tour during the first world war.  The answer
