Sir Hugh

One day (2) I was goin' to school
I bounced my ball so high
My ball gone over in Vicoria yard
Till no one could hear when it follow

–––––

Come in (2) you brave little boy,
" and get yo ball
O no (2) I cx come in
Enless than my schoolmistress 
follow

–––––

She holds me by my little white 
hand
She leads me o'er the wall
And if my schoolmistress do ax her
for me
Just told her that I am to 
sleep
