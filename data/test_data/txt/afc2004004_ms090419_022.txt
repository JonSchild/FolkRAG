I was out to a dance one night and, whilst I was out
there to this dance, a big racket come up. Guy come up wid a gun,
say, I'll kill you, I'll kill you!" Backed off, you know, and
cummenced shooting--Bung! Bung!

I commenced running and I were running so fast until
I outrun the sound of the first shot two miles and a half and so,
when I stopped, I heard that first shot again and I [I] thought
that man was still shooting. I [run] lit in to runnin' again , got to my house[, q] . Quick
as I hit the steps, I said, "Annie, open the door." Look like it
took three weeks for her to open it. I sit down to rest my feet, but
they were so hotI called for a bowl of ice water to wash um in.
Had icicles on my moustache two feet long. I went to bed, take
six hours rest, got up and walked to the door and [heard] along came the sound
of that gun shooting its first shot.
