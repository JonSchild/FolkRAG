Mr. Allan Lomax

Dear friend,

I am sending you the
song you asked for, and
am also thinking of the
old ones I used to sing.
If you ever come back to Ky
and happen around I will
be glad to sing some of 
them for you.

The machine I own
is a Brunswick cabinet
style. It is a very good
machine. I used the needles
 you sent, but the records
did not sound good at all.
