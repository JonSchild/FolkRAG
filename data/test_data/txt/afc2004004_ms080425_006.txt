Man:   Well, that's wonderful. You mind if I sample some
of your pickles.

Man:   Miss Panford (?)   Is this your lunch?   Do you take 
lunch to all the Sacred Harp singings in the vicinity?
I wish we had more loyal supporters like you.  Is this
your sister?  You couldn't tell that you two are twins

Woman:   No, you sure couldn't.

Man:   Do you sisters always share a spread together?  That's
great, that's wonderful. . . . Look at Alan slipping a chicken
leg over there.   . . . . . . You all want to get a shot down th
the table.

Alan:   Is that your chicken down there?

Woman:   That's my sister's chicken.

Alan:   She's your twin. . . you do this every year?  How many
people do you come prepared to feed every year?

Woman:   Oh, several hundred.

Al:   How long did it take you to do all this?

Woman:   I guess 2 hours, maybe a little better.

AL:   That's the way women come to dominate. . . they
got the keys to the bedroom and the kitchen.

Man:   You always start cooking a day or 2 before?

Woman:   I sure do.  I can't cook it all in 1 day.

Man:   Do you raise a lot of your food. . in gardens?
