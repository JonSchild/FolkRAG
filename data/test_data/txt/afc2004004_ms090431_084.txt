Fisk, 15.  6.  WILL STARK.
Say I don't wear no button [up] shoes;
My feet too large for a 'gator.
All she want is a pan of pea'n and
A great big yam potato.
A rowdy soul, rowdy soul,
Don't make no difference if [that] I work or no.

Last year was a good crop year
For cabbage and tomatoes.
Oh, I didn't raise much cotton and corn
But great God -- potatoes.
Rowdy soul, etc.

I think that's about all I can think of.
A:  Something about Whoa back bus?

Whoa back, Bus;
Gi' back lamb;
You step on the cotton
Like you don't give a damn.

A:  Somebody told me that that was what you call a Yahoo song
S:  Yes.
A:  What does that mean, Will?
S:  The white folks would just sing in the hills.
A:  Well, is that when you --

Doggone luck, doggone luck;
I don't know my what from my fingers.
But I got too much blood
To 'sociate with the niggers.

I can't think of it.
A:  You wouldn't sing that song when there was a white man?
S:  Yeah.  As a general rule they don't work no poor white folks anyhow; they'd git.
A:  You wouldn't sing that when there was a poor white?
A:  No sir, no sir.  I wouldn't sing on account I wouldn't want to hurt his feelings.  Anyway he wo uldn't like it.
A:  That song is one that the colored folks learned from the white folks?
S:  Yessir.
