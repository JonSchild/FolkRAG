First he sang and played "Rye Whiskey" with one brand new couplet:

"A good drink of whiskey won't do me no harm;
I wish I had a bottle as long as my arm."

Elmo Newcomer's Dance Calls
and Fiddle tune words

Interpolated verse in break downs.
Cotton-eyed Joe--

Hold my fiddle and hold my bow
And knock the devil outa Cotton Eye Joe.
Ooh--oo--oo--oo etc.
I'd a got married twenty year ago,
Had it not been for Cotton Eye Joe.
Ooh--oo--oo------
I'd a got married six or seven year ago,
Had it not been for that little word No.

Some folks say that a Nigger won't steal 
But I found three in my cornfield.
One had a bushel and one had a peck,
And one had a roas'n-ear around his neck.

Rawhide fiddle and cornstalk bow,
Look out over there for Cotton Eye Joe.
How in the world do the old folks know
That I take sugar in my coffee, oh?
Long-tailed buck an' a short-tailed doe,
But I take sugar in my coffee, oh.
Ooh--oo--oo etc.

Turkey in the Straw--

Went out to milk and didn't know how,
I milked a goat instead of a cow.

Saw a turkey settin' on a pile o' straw,
Winkin' at his mother-in-law.

I went out to milk an' I didn't know how,
I milked a goat instead of a cow.

Picked up a rock and whacked him on the jaw,
And he kicked up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.

Unfortunate Puppy--

Why can't a white man dance like a Nigger,
Oh, just because he can't cut a figger.
Doggone a rye-straw, doggone a riddle, oh,
Doggone a little boy playin' on a fiddle, oh.
