"Mr, Alan Lomax."
         "Dear Sir,"

It was very exciting to hear from
you, and to know that you all are
enjoying the song my friends and I
recorded.
Thank you for trying to markiting 
them, for if they go on record it will
mean a lot to me.
     I hope before long you will have
good news for me, for right now I
could use some cash (smile)
                           Season Greeting
                             Viola James
