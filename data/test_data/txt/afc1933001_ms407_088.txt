Great Godamighty

     Lightnin's eyes blazed as he sang. He was the leader of
a quartet of black convicts brought from their cells into the
vacant hospital room where Lightnin' stood leaning forward towards
the recording horn, his three companions in a group just
behind him. His color was deep black, "a blue black, bad nigher,"
the stolid guard whispered to me. Lightnin' was still
young--not yet thirty--serving his second term for serious 
crimes. As his body swayed with the rhythm of the singing his 
figure seemed a black Apollo in grace and beauty.
     Lightnin' was leading a song describing the days when
convicts were leased by the state to owners of large cotton and
cane plantations, sometimes to be driven under the lash until
they fell from exhaustion, many, according to rumor, dying from
sunstroke amid the sun-baked rows of corn and cane, in "dem long,
hot summer days." The song pictures what went on in the minds
of a gang of field workers, one of whom was about to be punished.
     The negroes see the "Cap'n" riding up on his horse with a 
bull whip in one hand and a cowhide in the other. They work
faster. "Better go to drivin'," says the song. After each excited
ejaculation, the chorus rings out, "Great Godamighty!"
          "Ridin' in a hurry.
               Great Godamighty!
          Ridin' like he's angry.
               Great Godamighty!
          Well, I wonder whuts de matter?
                Great Godamighty!
