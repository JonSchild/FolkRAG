Dear Mr. Archer,
The other day Peter Kennedy played me some of the
songs you have recorded for him, and I must say I was
delighted by the quality of the singing.

I wonder if you would like to call me up some time
when you are in London and come by my flat for a drink
and some singing. I shall be at home most of the time
for the next two or three weeks.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax.
