I see by the map that you are
practically on top of the WARAO (Orinoco 
delta).  If you see any in Trinidad -- I 
understand the they go there now & then
to trade for supplies -- tell them to go
home & not acculturate like good Indians.
Seriously, I understand that Indians from
Venezuela do come to trade in Trinidad.
Maybe you can get some of their music.
Anyhow it's worth looking into.
