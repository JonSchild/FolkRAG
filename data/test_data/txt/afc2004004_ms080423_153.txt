'lasses and stuff, and this feller he come to the house to eat with
us, you know.   And, uh, he was eatin' away, and he had pants on.

    SH:   Back in the old days, you know, people was awful bashful,
worse than they are now, you know, ain't more  . . .  too many people
ain't very bashful, back then  . . .        terrible bashful.   So this

you know,  . . .                                                  we had 'lasses and
