-14- Rumors, 8-9 to 8-15 New York 8-18-42

 New York 8-9 (Union leader) : "Washington is engaged in a concerted
drive to force New York workers to take lower wages. We will have unemployed 
unless we either force recognition of our wage rates, or give in to the 
pressure. Army and Navy officers as a group are bitterly anti-labor." 

       New York 8-14: "Must I move to Mississippi to get a job, and take 
half the wages I would get here? What right has the government to best down
our wage rates by loaning money to build new clothing plants in the South?"

     Brooklyn 8-13: "Workers in the defense plants are taking it easy.
Why in Detroit they say men don't work more than tow honest hours in an eight
hour day."

      New York 8-13: "The 5 1/2 cents an hour increase given to the
General Electric Company workers will cause demands in other industries. 
GE wages rates have always been high and since war production began, the
wages have been climbing. Now the wages will be way out of line. Workers
not engaged in what is called essential war work will not accept such 
discrimination without protest." 

    New York 8-12: "The War Labor Board will find excuses to raise
any wage rates that labor fights for. That formula of matching the increase 
in the cost of living is the bunk --look at the General Motors case." 

  New York 8-13 (Retired businessman): "Labor is cashing in on this
war, and unless the rise in waged is checked the post-war period will have 
an inflation such as the world has never known before." 

Ship Movements, Etc. 

       Brooklyn 8-15: "There are about fifty British ships in the 
Navy yard this week." 

        New York 8-12: "More British ships are here for repairs that 
ever before. They came from the Mediterranean."
