"If we allow of the differences in population...in the first 
quarter of this year we produced a little less than two and a 
quarter times the volume of army munitions that you did and about
twice the weight of combat aircraft....Of every hundred occupied
men and women in this country about 55 are working for the government 
either in the armed forces or in factories or in other
branches...Perhaps you can compare the two countries best if I 
say that to reach our present level you would need to have very 
nearly 40,000,000 people working for the government."

It is interesting to not that in spite of statements which 
may be seen as contradicting prevailing misconceptions, the rumors persist:

Review of the Radio DEBUNK's axis propaganda shows very close
parallel to the tone of the anti-British rumors. Illustration of the 
similarity is the pairing of H with the following excerpt from July 7th's
broadcast: 

"They are saying that as long as we supply your subjects with
everything they need to live, free of charge under the lend-lease
law...(Unintelligible for a 1 point) that this war will go on forever.
I can't blame your subjects for recognizing a good thing
when they see it. if I were a Britisher on your Island I would
want the war to continue on till dooms day."

These rumors serve the enemy well in inspiring disunity within
our midst. The United Nations concept, so necessary for successful
cooperation, depends on confidence in our allies. The anti-British stories
are wedge-driving character. They follow in psychological warfare the
military tactic of isolating enemies that they may be attacked and eliminated singly, if when combined they are too strong.
