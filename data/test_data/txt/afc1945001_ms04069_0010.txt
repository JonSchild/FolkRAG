            "The Navy is outbidding all these other depots for men and getting
them.  Why, they go to a surveyor who's working for $37.50 a week and offer 
him $60. That isn't helping things because it just speeds up one project 
and slows down another.  I know the different depots have an agreement not 
to take each others men, but I mean they go to men in private industry and 
outbid the others.  And out at the Supply Depot about 40 men quit to go with 
the Navy.  It was in their contract that they couldn't quit except for cause.  
Well, their checks had been coming in anywhere from nine days to two weeks 
late so they took this as their "cause" and resigned in a body and went to 
work for more money at Clearfield (Naval Supply Depot).     [* 8-5    21*]
