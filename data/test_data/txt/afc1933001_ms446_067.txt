Though often you request;
He'll give you grace to conquer,
And take you home to rest.

Rock of Ages, shelter me!
Let me hide myself in Thee!
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side that flowed,
Be of sin the perfect cure;
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

Not the labor of my hands,
Can fulfill the law's demands;
Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no respite know,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked come to Thee for dress;
Helpless look to Thee for grace;
Black, I to the fountain fly,
Wash me, Savior, or I die!

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes are closed in death, 
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne, 
Rock of Ages, shelter me!
Let me hide myself in Thee!
