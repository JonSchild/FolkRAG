Dear Mr. Rosen: 
Thank you very much for your prompt 
attention to my last letter requesting the 
revision of your bill. We still have to 
make one more request, unfortunately. The 
revised bill of October 6, 1939, order number 
21202, carries an expressage charge of 
$2.89. Will you please send us the receipt 
for this particular item? 

As we requested before, please address 
it direct to the Superintendent of Buildings 
and Grounds, Mr. William C. Bond. 
Sincerely yours,
