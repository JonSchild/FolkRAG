The Listening Post
 No. 1

Two weeks ago our reporters began sending in material on what they were hearing.  
The reports that have come in are very interesting.

They show that:

(1)        There's a lot of discussion about sugar rationing.
             Example:  
             ". . . There was enough sugar in the warehouses to take care of all of our 
needs for over a year and 'they' are about to ship a great deal more in very soon.

(2)         People are spreading stories about spies.
              Example:  
               "There was a fire in a plant making war materials and when the fire extinguishers 
were turned on, the fire burned even better.  They discovered that twelve 
out of fourteen fire extinguishers in the room were filled with gasoline."

(3)          People are spreading stories about the war.
               Example:  
              "The reason the British are retreating in Libya is that so many men in their 
forces are getting desert blindness and can't fight."

(4)          People are spreading stories about the part different groups are playing in 
the war.
               Example:  
               "Most of the Jews are to [leave] blame for this war.  Hitler was right in kicking out 
all the Jews, although he should not attack the other countries who were not bothering 
them at all."

               Watch for material of this kind, as well as for any other things you hear and 
report them. We are very appreciative of the material that has been coming and we 
hope that you'll continue to send in your reports regularly.

               The Listening Post will come to you twice a month. Persons who do not send 
in reports will be dropped from our mailing lists.
