9. To initiate the program of experimental documentary broadcasts in
the field, I suggest that the sum of $5,000.00 to cover travel
expenses for actors, sefvices of a director and etc. be set aside.
Between 5 and 10 programs can be put together with this money. The
only director in the field of radio who I feel is competent to carry
out this work is Mr. Nicholas Ray, who is at present with the
Columbia Broadcasting System. The total for this program for a
years work will be approximately $ 30,000.00.
