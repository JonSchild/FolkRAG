N.B.  This study is far from complete.  No
approach was made to problem of rumor among special
groups, e.g. it is likely that people who are
uprooted and transported to new communities are
especially susceptible to rumor -- not having a 
stable and appropriate reference frame to check
stories against.  This would mean (apart from newly
inducted soldiers) that migrant workers, women newly
introduced into the labor markets, etc., should be
given especial study.
