Reel of 9/26/61, Side 2, Song 21

OH LAWDY, DON'T LEAVE ME
A spiritual

CHORUS:  Oh Lawdy, don't leave me,
Oh Lawdy, don't leave me,
Oh Lawdy, don't leave me,
Lawd, I gotta be on my way.

(REPEAT CHORUS)

I would not live a sinner,
I'll tell you the reason why:
I'm afraid my Lawd may call me
And I won't be ready to die.  (CHORUS)

I head the train a-comin',
She's comin' around the curve,
She's pullin' all her steam and power
And screamin' at every nerve:  (Cryin')  (CHORUS)

Oh, when I was a sinner,
I loved my distant whim,
But when I come to find out,
I was on the road to hea'n.  (CHORUS)

(REPEAT CHORUS)

Yes, when I was a sinner,
A sinner just like you,
I bowed down at the altar,
Stayed there 'till I come through.  (CHORUS)

(REPEAT CHORUS)
