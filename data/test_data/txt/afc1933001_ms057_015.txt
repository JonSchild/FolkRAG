Dear Mr. Dornbush:

I have received your airmail letter,
stating that you have never heard from me, and telling
me that it will be impossible for expenses to be paid
for more than four of our Cowboy organization.

In the first place, I do not understand why you did not
hear from me, for I wrote you a long and uninteresting
letter - and mailed it April 10th. In this aforementioned
epistulary effort I rambled on at some length about the
history of our Cowboy aggregation, the source of our 
numbers, and even went so far as to enclose a couple of
pictures showing the aggregation before they began to
acquire a middle-aged spread. So perhaps it is just as
well that it went wrong in the mail., Maybe  didn't put 
enough postage on it, and Mr. Farley's cohorts are holding 
it up there. I know that I did not add the "N.W." to the
Street address; so perchance it went South East.

But all that is neither here not there now, for under the
set-up you have, it will be impossible for the San Angelo 
Cowboys to be with you. We have a rule of long standing
and one that we never deviate from. It is not an original
one, for I believe that the Three Musketeers used it to
advantage; but we never sing, play, cavort, or harrass
the public anywhere unless the entire 7 are on tap.

We appreciate the honor of being considered, and want to
thank you, as well as our friend John Lomax,- who in a
weak and probably misguided moment, recommended us to
you. I hope that if in some future time we can be of any
service, that you will not hesitate to call on me. 

I know you will have a highly enjoyable program in June,
and wish you every success.

Very truly yours,

H.W. Broome
