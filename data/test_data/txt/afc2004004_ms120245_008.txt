a dead [per] man, growling and snarling -  you'd
best give Baron Samedi whatever he asks for or
he'll break your neck   - likes black roosters & anything 
else -  sometime you have to stuff his nose
and ears with cotton and gag him & lay him out
like a dead man before he'll be quiet.

All the foregoing are gros neg'

Baron Samedi is the last to come in the formal ceremony.
After they have come in the order shown,
then any loi the people want can be called, any song
can be sung.

Again Yim√© is the particular loi of R.P.'s family
on his mother's side, from Mirabelais when anyone is
sick in the family Agasu comes down from the mountain
and prescribes without being called for __ a woman
- lives in the sweet water -
