Dear Duncan,

I'd like to have a copy of this record for my own
files. In the meantime I've told Miss Colcord, who is a wonderful
lady, whose private collection ought some day to
come to the Library, to come and intone to you....

Ask Mrs. Korson to look in the collection of old
Paramount records I bought for the Archive and see if
see can find a copy of "One Dime Blues" sung by Blind Lemon
Jefferson. I want to reissue it for Decca and probably the 
only copy is in your files. Mine has been stolen. I'll pay
for the overtime... Also an old Brunswick "Pretty Polly"
by Doc Boggs... If they're found, call me and I'll arrange
to borrow them for dubbing...

How're things?

Alan Lomax
