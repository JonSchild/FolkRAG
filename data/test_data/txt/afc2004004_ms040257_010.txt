Cairistiona: Nach freagair thu, Chairistiona?

E ho hi ri
Ho ho i sa bho ro ho
E ho hi ri

Nach freagair thu Chairistiona
Na'm freagradh, gu'n cluinninn fhein thu
Thug mi bliadhna an Cuirt an Righ leat
'S gad chanainn e, thug mi tri ann
Chi mi luingeas 's a' Chaol Ileach
'S iad ag iarraidh Cairistiona
Tonn gu bean innse dhi.
     Gus a cur 'san talamh iosal
     Sios na leacan gu Ile
     Tuille 's a thug mi'n Gleann Comhainn
     An fhairge trom 's an caol domhain
     Chan ioghnadh leam a bhi dubhach
     Ged a dh' fhaodadh cha dean mi'n gnothach
     Cha bhi taire 's deanamh romham.

A phiuthrag's a phiuthar (O Little sister)  Flora McNeil
This song is about a girl who was stolen by the fairies
and her friends did not know where she was until her
sister saw her resting on a knoll which was actually
the fairy dwelling and she heard her sister down below
singing this song: -
Sister, O sister, hear thou my plaint
And I in a little bothy
Low and narrow without thatch, or rope
Holding the thatch
And the rain of the bens raining down on it.
