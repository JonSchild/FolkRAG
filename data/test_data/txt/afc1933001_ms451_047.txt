Jay-bird pull a two ox load,
Sparrow, why not you?
My legs so long and slender, love
I'm feared I'll pull into.
'Feared I'll pull into,  my love
'Feared I'll pull into,  my love
'Feared I'll pull into,  my love
'Feared I'll pull into,  my love.
Snowbird died with whooping cough
Crawfish died with colic,
Jaybird died with a sick headache,
Inauiring the way to frolic.    Cho.  I. & II
When I get one dram
Then I want two
When I get on a high lonesome
I don't care what I do.  Cho.  I & II.
