(Ray)  and that was part of the Cherokee removal.
AL:  Delanaga, Georgia.
Ray:  That's right.  And I'm 3/8th Cherokee, I got it from both
sides.  And them fairy tales(?) I guess is pretty close.  And my
granddaddy was a full Indian -- greatgranddaddy was buried in a 
gold mine over there.  Goes into my wife's people, had Indians.
And then also on my mama and dad's side.
AL:  What about the gold rush song?  How does that come in, what's
the story?
Ray:  Well, I just put it together, about the first gold rush, about
Parks(?) stompin' his toe and kickin' off a gold rush.  And
about Jenkins Hollow andthe mint.
AL:  Well, this was the first time that gold was actually mined in
the eastern America, wasn't it?
Ray:  Well, it was one of the first gold rushes.  Over there at the
college, where they displays the gold, were the mint stood.
Delanaga money is worth more than California gold, today.
AL:  And that was really the end of the Cherokees, because when
the gold was found the Cherokees and the Indians had to go.
Ray:  Yeah, well the Cherokee nation fought the Creek(?) Indians with
Andrew Jackson, then he turned on them.  Thought they'd move 'em
to California, . . .to die on poor land.  Yet they moved into (unint)
and they wanted to marry(??) them again.
AL:  Well, I want to hear that song now. . .
