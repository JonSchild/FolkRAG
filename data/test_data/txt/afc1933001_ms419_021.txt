Tune - Little Brown Jug.

Here-Belisha stands for war,
Then we have Sir Samuel Hoare;
But can they save the country yet
With a couple of whores in the cabinet?

CHORUS:

Ha, ha, ha; he, hee, hee,
Go and lobby your M.P.,
Ask him if he's ready yet
To pull the chain on the cabinet?

Then we have Sir Emmett Browne,
You stand up to speak and he sits you down;
But can they save the country yet
With a little bit of brown in the cabinet?

(CHORUS)

How long as the Chamberlain
Without being emptied down the drain?
But can they save the country yet
With a chamber layin' in the cabinet?


This is the song that the crowds sang outside the Houses of
Parliament during the Czech crisis (September, 1938).

All those named are British cabinet ministers except Browne,
who is Speaker of the House.
