4.

Just as soon as the sun recognized its Maker,
Why, it clothed itself in sack clothing and went down,
Went down in mourning!
"Look at my Maker hangin' on the cross."
And when the sun went down,
We seen the moon,--that was his maker, too,
Oo-oo, he made the moo-oon,
My dear friends, yes, both time and the seasons.
We seen, my dear friends,
When the moon recognized Jesus hangin' on the cross,
I seen the moon, yes, took with a judgment hemorrhage and bleed away.

2 Good God, the dying thief on the cross
Saw the moon going down in blood,
Saw it go down and bleed away.
I seen the little stars, great God, that was there;
They remembered Jesus when he struck on the anvil of time;
And the little stars recognized their Maker dying on the cross;
Each little star leaped out of its silver orbit
To make the torches of a dark and unbenointed world.

3 It got so dark until the men who was puttin' Jesus to death,
They said they could feel the darkness with their fingers.
Great Godamighty! they was close to one another,
And it was so dark they could feel one another,
And feel one another talk, but they couldn't see one another.
I heard one of the centurions say,
"Sholy, sholy, this must be the son of God."
'Bout that time we seen, my dear friends--
The prophet Isaiah said the dead in the graves would hear His voice and
come forward--

4  We seen the dead getting up out of their graves on the east side of
Jerusalem,
Getting out of their graves,
Walking about,
Going down in town,
Oh-h-h, way over on Nebo's mounting!
I seen the great lawgiver
Get up out of his grave and begin to walk about, my dear friends,
Walk about, because Jesus said it was finished.

5  I shouldn't wonder, my dear friends,
That the church will save you when you get in trouble.
I heard the church so many times singing when you get in trouble,
The church would sing, How can I die while Jesus lives? *
* Here the pastor sings a hymn beginning with these seven words, and the men join in.

6  I seen the horse come steppin' on Calvary's bloody brow,
Pawing, my dear friends, with thunder in his train,
And the lightnin' was playing on the bridle reins which Death had in his 
hands.
He come ridin'! He come ridin'!
And the dyin' thief looked Death in the face,
Caught sight of the object side of the horse,
He saw a new name written there,
