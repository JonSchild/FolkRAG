Both of us were sorry fools.

Such early experiences added to my self-consciousness and restrained
any disposition to egotism. Perhaps also through them I afterward found 
extra pleasure in the two following incidents:

"Look on us a time," they seemed to say, "and space shall be no more." 
 Two fainted and fell from their patient mules the day we went down,
