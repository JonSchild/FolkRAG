Mr. Eugene Katz
Office of War Information
Library of Congress Annex
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Katz:

Dr. Allport has already written you his
comments on your recent confidential report on
rumors. I do not have his comments before me at
the moment but in the main, I think we concurred.
While the report succeeds eminently well as an
introduction to the subject of war time rumor, 
it seems to me to fail both in presenting any
new appreciable amount of information or in suggesting
means whereby rumor can be controlled.

We were very much gratified here to
find that you had made such extensive use of the
reports coming from this office.

Very truly yours,

Robert H. Knapp.

Robert H. Knapp, Chairman
Division of Propaganda Research
