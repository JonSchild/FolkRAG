by the stream that has poured throu
me there 17 years that I never
enjoy anything anymore - and
there is always the shadow of
old man, John H., to rise &
confound any impression I might have
that I am doing well something on
my own. I keep on & on because it
is difficult to stop...

London is a monstrous town.
Like all monsters, it's heart & brain
are rather small - Regent St.,
Harley St., Oxford St., Westminster,
Piccadilly, Trafalgar, Temple Bar -
almost everything is comprised in
these points or near them - for
instance you find the whole of the
British film industry - producers
distributors, technical equipment
on Wardour st - a narrow passage
way above Piccadilly about 8 blocks
