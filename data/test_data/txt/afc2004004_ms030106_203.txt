They sang songs - Daddy Dear and, let's see, trouble of it, I can't 
remember off-handed on account of the years getting mixed up.
"When the Midnight Choo-Choo leaves for Alabama" is one we were singing.
It seemed like they would hold a number a long time - they'd sing a 
number maybe for a year or two.  I'm Crying Lot For You, Melancholy Baby
was still quite prominent at that time, 1917.  There's a number we
used to sing at that time - (____ Liza Jane)
It was kind of a little comedy song - the whole coast went for that.
(more singing)  We used to sing that little number - I forgot the name of
that tune.   And then they had a lot of popular tunes they used to sing.
Of course, I brought all of the tunes most of the tunes, myself, from
Chicago.  We didn't have an awful lotta tunes they sang out there, but
I brought a bunch of music with me and started the people up and the first
thing I did, I wrote a tune called The Cadillac Rag - I've forgotten the
tune now.  It's quite a hard tune - used to play it on the piano - 
and it was one of those things where the singer would sing it and I'd have
an answer in it and the Cadillac Rag got to be kinda pretty fair.
