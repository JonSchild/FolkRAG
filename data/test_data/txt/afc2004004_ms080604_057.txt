Now the (Arthur Harder?), I was a (taxi-tender?) on the
(Arthur Harder?) a good while and when she used to get right
there (points to river), she had a (cribbin?) whistle, and
Captain Mike (Moore?) was the pilot, and he'd reach up there
and get it (makes motion like grabbing a line), and they said
he used to say, "Womens, womens, womens -your man's in town!"
(whole group laughs)  Yeah!  He sure could blow it, boy.  he
could blow it!

     And that man on that Arthur Harder, he knowed
how to blow that whistle.  He was kinda deformed -one of his
legs trembled, and he put him a strap on his whistle.  And he
would put his foot in that (stirrup?).  That man knowed he
could blow that whistle.  Right there was Mississippi river.
I helped 'em to cut the spillway back in yonder.  To turn the
current away from here.
