MEMORANDUM ON STUDY S-68
A Study of War-Time Rumors in Two Defense Communities
General Purpose of the Study
To make an exploratory excursion into the problem of studying war-time 
rumors. Special effort, however, will be made to throw some light upon 
the following hypothesis: That in a given news area or in a potential 
news area, the amount of rumor increases as news decreases or lack of 
news becomes apparent.
Plan to be Experimented With
To determine in two defense areas on the Atlantic seaboard:
1. What kinds of war rumors are currently in circulation.
2. The extent to which these rumors have penetrated into the 
population, i.e., the broad classes and strata which show 
the highest and lowest sensitivity to rumors.
3. The probable sources of these rumors.
4. Possible explanations of why people accept and spread 
rumors in terms of such factors as:
a. Inadequacy of news in the sphere of interest in which 
the rumor belongs.
b. Various personality characteristics of the informant, 
e.g., prejudice, level of interest in the war, degree 
of confidence in the news, degree of social participation, 
etc.
Note: For purposes of the study rumor is arbitrarily 
defined as any story concerning the war which has 
not appeared through any of the usual channels of 
communication.
The Communities Selected
It is proposed that New Brunswick, New Jersey, and Portland, Maine, 
be studied intensively. These seaboard communities are roughly 
equivalent in size, similar in their proximity to large metropolitan
