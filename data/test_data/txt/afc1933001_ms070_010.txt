Mr. John A. Lomax - Page Twi

better if you told me your feeling about it.
This publication will probably be carried through this summer sometime
so I would like to hear from you soon regarding both that and permission
to quote the songs in the Donald Ogden Stewart book.
I am going to see Alan next week if he is in Washington and will talk with him further about this.
With best wishes for the continuation of your excellent work - and
I have an order in for "This Singing Country" already.

Very sincerely,
Earl Robinson
