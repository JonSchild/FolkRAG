Fairfield Templebar 4343
Thursday - June 28th - Oban. Sunny.
Blue sea.
June 28th - Shepherd's hey over hill
to Glasgow
   Returned London. Saw Bolton.
She'll betray me.
   Courted some girls. Found Pip
who was as fine as I thought. I
need marrying, but not her.
   Finished the English album
with Pete Kennedy & got kicked
out of my house.
   Back to Glasgow, girded 
my loins & am now starting into
the Bothy country under the dubious
guidance of Hamish Henderson, 
who is a good poet but makes
me awfully uncomfortable.
