A (continued)
And here Doodles is in his element. Um, 
there's a preacher, there's a, ah, local 
ah businessman and Doodles the garage mechanic 
and the singer, spending the afternoon at a 
rabbit hunt. And they are still using ah 
hunting sticks - they call them tally-hos, and 
I realised I - as I looked at this, that we 
here had a, a carry-over of something 
absolutely from the Dark Ages, from, from the 
distant past, because once upon a time the 
ancestors of these men didn't have guns that
they have now, they hunted with sticks. And 
Doodles tells how he could knock a rabbit off 
at 50 yards with a, with ah, a stone and ah 
when he ran out of shells, when he, when he 
was a young boy, he could, could get one with 
the end of his stick. And ah so every man has 
his rabbit stick.
