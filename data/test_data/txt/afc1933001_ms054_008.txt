Mr. John A. Lomax
Port Aransas, Texas

Dear John Lomax:

Since I have long felt that Christmas cards were unappreciated,
I haven't sent them out in years. That does not mean that my wife
and I did not notice the interesting card that you sent us. As a 
matter of fact the sudden death of my Mother shortly after Christmas
more or less disrupted all my correspondence at that time.

Wonder of wonders!- Alan Lomax's ill-fated recording machine
has turned up in the Stolen Property Room of the Detroit Police Department.
I do not know anything about its condition but it gives
us that extra machine that we were hoping for. Secondly, as you
undoubtedly know, Alan will probably go to New York the end of this
month and I have dissuaded him from taking the new machine with him.
Instead I suggested that he rent a studio in New York. All this
adds up to the fact that we are about ready to place at your disposal
a portable recording machine and accessories. If you will please let 
me know how long a trip you want to make and the general regions you
should like to cover, I shall be very glad to make the proper
recommendations to the Librarian.

The Music Division of the Library, with its various charming
officials, look forward to the presence of Miss Tirrell and John
Lomax at any time and for as long a time as they might wish to spend
in Washington.

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
