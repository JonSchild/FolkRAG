Yesterday I spoke at Denton for half 
the fee the College offered you.
Again, I must offer my poor
wares to the public in order
to keep the wolf from the door
or begging my children for
bread. The War is cutting off
my income until your
father is scratching a head
where the hair used to be at.
The C.I.A. girls almost mobbed me
yesterday when I played 'em your
"Git along LIttle Dogies" and Carl
Sandburg told me in his deepest
chest tones: "I'd rather hear that
gypsy woman sing than Mary
Anderson. Play that record again."
I did.

Chris is ordered to sea and
poor Shirley is frantic. Temporarily
we are to take the children.

Leon Henderson has I think in his latest
order shut off our hope for tires. I
await your orders.
