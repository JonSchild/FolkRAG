TAPE 35: ABERDEEN JULY 16TH.  John Mearns and John Strachan

Green Grows the Laurel - John Mearns. (2.20)
1) I once had a sweetheart but now I've got none,
She's gone and she's left me to weep and to mourn,
She's gone and she's left me, but contented I'll be,
For I'll get another far better than she.
Chorus:
O green grows the laurel and sweet falls the dew,
Sorry was I love, when parting with you,
But by my next meeting I hope you'll prove true,
And change the green laurel to violets so blue.
2) She wrote me a letter, four sweet, rosy lines,
She wrote me another, all twisted and twined,
Keep your love letters and I willkeep mine,
And write to your sweetheart and I'll write to mine.
3) She passes my window both early and late,
And the looks that she gives me they make my heart break,
And the looks that she gives me ten thousand times o'er,
You are the sweetheart I once did adore.
4) I oft-times do wonder why young maids love men,
I oft-times do wonder why young men love them,
But by my experience I now ought to know,
Young maids are deceivers wherever they go.

Glenlogie - John Strachan (2.15)
1) There were four and twenty nobles stood at the King's ha'.
And bonnie Glenlogie was flo'or o' them all.
2) There were nine and nine nobles rode roun' Bankley fair,
And bonnie Glenlogie was flo'or of them there.
3) Doon cam' Jeannie Gordon, she cam' trippin' doon stairs,
And she's fallen in love with Glenlogie over all that was there.
4) She called on his footboy that stood by his side,
"Now who is that young man and where does he bide?"
5) "His name is Glenlogie when he is at hame,
And he's o' the gay Gordons, and his name is Lord John."
