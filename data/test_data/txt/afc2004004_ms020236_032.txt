I could be wrong -- but to, my idea, they be all that way.  
Ya see?   I mean jealousy.   Don' want no -- Yeah, jealous and prudish an', 
you know, jus' don't [let] want nobody to their house an' all that 
kinda ol' stuff. . .Jus' jealous an' act crazy, tha's [all.] what I mean.
           But this guy, he was very friendly; he was a hard worker 
an' everything.   But I, ah, I left this guy, y'know.   I had 
never left home by myself; I hadn't a been but ov' the fields 
to Fitzgerald, you know, [at that time] in that neighborhood, 
at that time.   An' so, I wasn't goin' back over to Cassius; 
I just meant not to go [aft' I had lef'] back there.  An' so I sent my 
chile to my Mama, to Millon, Georgia -- I tell ya about it, 
she was there three years -- an' ah, I sent her to Millon an' 
I sent to West Green with a friend of mine that used to live 
with I an' Cassius, an' I knew she was in West Green, an' so,
 I jus' sent my daughter all the way to Millon to Mama by a 
friend of mine -- another friend; she was goin' to Mama.   An' 
that was a real break to get her there.  'Cause I was ready to 
get from around this guy altogether, but I didn' want to carry 
my young one about, not knowin' where I'm goin.  So I jus' took
 it easy until I got a break.   So when this lady was goin' to 
Mama, that was a good hope.   I sent my chile; it didn't cost 
nothin' for her to ride, ya know.   So she went on to Mama an' 
I stayed around there about two, three weeks later.  An' I, ah, got,
[was goin'] . . .you know... [I was goin'] wi' a lil' change in my [hair] han', I went to 
the white boy that I was raised up with, what was like jus' 
peoples; was like a first cousin; he's a Weasle.  I went [there] back 
to Olly, name of Olly, I went up there to (beg ? ) -- to the car at least where 
he was sittin', [to] in the car (an' believe I tol' him I want) some money.  
An' he [handed] let me have it to me right then, jus' reached in his pocket 
an' handed it to me.  I [was sittin' on the step; almost conked out] said to myself, I'm gone now.  
Ha!   I went on down there to, all,         where the train, an' 
I went to West Green.
           Goin' to West Green, though -- I [don't know how to] hadn't never traveled,
didn't know how to get there; I jus' thought I was goin' to Wes'
Green.   When I got to the station I asked the man [at] for the
ticket -- to West Green.   First thing, I was so scared this guy
was gonna miss me, an' come behind me.   I wasn't used to no
fightin [an'] or no, nothin' like that, [no whuppin'], I had thought
