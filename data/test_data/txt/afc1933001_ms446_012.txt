International Student Service

International Student Service was founded in 1920 to
help meet the physical and educational needs of European
university youth, left stranded after the World War.
Students in this country and elsewhere raised more than
two million dollars to help their fellow-students in
Europe. In recent years new emergencies, the war in the
Far East and the plight of thousands of student refugees
from the totalitarian countries added to the burden of
relief. At present International Student Service is making
every effort to assist student refugees from Poland, 
Czechoslovakia, Germany, and other countries who have fled
from death and the work gang.

Relief, however, is essentially a secondary function of
International Student Service. Even in the early twenties
it became clear that what students wanted above all was
an understanding of their own problems, educational and
social, economic and political, national and international.
Numerous international study conferences were organized.
Foundations and individuals both in the United States
and abroad made possible the publication of a series of
studies on problems of higher education and on attitudes
of students to political problems.

The present war did not interrupt this work, nor has
it succeeded in destroying its results. Clear in thought and
strong in their conviction, those who work for I.S.S. 
continue to make a modest contribution to a world built on
compassion and reason.

In the United States, I.S.S. is developing new 
opportunities for placing its experience at the service of the
American student. It is now well understood that if the
needs of the youth of a nation are not met, that nation is
jeopardizing its future. Youth in the United States is not
finding proper outlets for its energies nor adequate 
opportunities for useful employment. There are no complete and
satisfactory reasons for this failure. But it is certain that
the problems of youth cannot be divorced from the 
economic and political problems of the rest of the community.
I.S.S. proposes to take a prominent part in helping students
to understand these difficulties and to devise methods for
solving them. To this end it will sponsor discussions, de-
bates, round tables, seminars; talks by prominent speakers;
conferences, regional and national; work camps, offering
an opportunity for putting into practice the ways of 
democratic living. I.S.S. hopes to publish a students' magazine
and will edit reference lists on current literature.

I.S.S. believes these services will make it possible for
students to find a balanced view of this troubled world,
where widely different systems of thought are competing
for their attention.
