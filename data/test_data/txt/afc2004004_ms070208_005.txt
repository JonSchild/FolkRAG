There was a 50 verse song about the grasshopper -
before the boll weevil - right comical - used to
have a song about me.
"If you be a skinner, be sure that you can
Before you go to work for the blackeyed man."

Mister Charley Toventz [Loventz?] - my father started
him in the business - had six brothers - all
dead but two - Charley & Blair - live
in Memphis - 

Mr. Charley [Sibert] Siler killed the Mercy Man -
omit (Humane officer out of Memphis tried
to stop Siler from working mules with
sore shoulders - called Mr. Siler X)

I've handled labor for 46 years and
I've never had to cripple one yet -
Some of 'em were mean in the early
days - had to make 'em do what you
wanted them to do - - -
The singing was done in the wheeler
days - you hardly ever hear these late
niggers sing - after machines came, they stopped -
Wd sing now & then during the
day - then late in the evenings - never
sing in camp.  Very little singing last ten or
12 years -
