Barry: Well, - I had nice teeth, and mehair, of course, was
longer than that, you know, nice, and it was all ringlets, because
I used to keep it very nice, you know. I used to keepy myself nice,
tasty, you know, dressed up. Well then, I met him and he invited me
up to the house. So he said, "Will you come up to the house? I'd
like to have a talk with you." So he says, "You're a grand singer."
Well, I am So I went up to the house, andmet the sister and 
introduced me to the brother, and the sister was a very fine
girl. - Mary, they called her. So I went into the house, and talking
away, - had a great time, you know. Then he invited me, says, "There's
a place there, you can lie with my sister, if you like; there's a 
room there. You can keep it  to yourself." Then I sat around and sat
around awhile, and some way and another I hadn't as much sense as
I have now, you know. If I had as much sense as I have now I believe
I wouldn't have went so early - well, in the line of marriage, anyway.
Well, he asked me -- he didn't ask me straight away to marry him. --
I wasn't expecting that. Then that other brother was nice, you see,
was a tall fellow, too, with nice features, you know, -- but they
didn't interest me so much. And he wasn't goodlooking either, you
know. But that's it, see. So we sat around and talking - and he
didn't even ask me to marry him - he got the brother to ask me!
And I very often wondered at that. Why did he get the brother to
ask me when he hadn't the courage to ask me himself? Don't you
think so?
Lomax: Very strange.
Barry: It was, wasn't it. When you meet a girl and you start
asking "Will you marry me?" "I will or I won't." I mean to say,
that's it. Then when you have to get yoru brother or sister to ask
these questions. . . .
Lomax: Maybe he liked you so much he didn't want to risk asking
you yourself. It might have hurt him too much in his heart to
be refused by you.
Barry: That's it, you see. I always wanted to find out. The
meaning of that. And I've just been told it by you. I couldn't
even think that out properly. Why should he get his brother to
ask me to marry him when he himself was going to marry me?
Lomax: What did you think when you heard that?
Barry: I thought of nothing, like.
Lomax: Were you pleased?
Barry: Well, it didn't come into my mind. I said that's very curious.
And I went around a bit, and that's it, you see. When the brother
asked me he said, "Would you like to marry Paddy?" I thought - I
says, "Marry Paddy? Why?" He says to me, he says, "He asked me
to ask you to marry him. Will it be alright?" I says, "I don't know."
