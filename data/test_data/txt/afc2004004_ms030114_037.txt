You buck up to me, and I buck up to you way down in Georgia.
The big camp-meeting took placeat the color of the race way down in Georgia

I was a small kid, no more than three years old when that song came out.
Q:  What about SAVE UP YOUR MONEY?
A:  Let me see about that.  That came out in 1905.
Q:  Were you using finger-picks when you began playing the guitar.
A:  Oh no, I started using them about 25 years ago - or longer.
Q:  When you made those old PERFECT recordswere you using finger-picks?
A:  Yes.
Q:  Do you think its better to use finger-picks?
A:  It saves your fingers.

     I think 've heard three Blind people play guitars that I know of.
That was Willie Walker and Sammie Dooley and myself.

     Do I play guitar?  No, I play with one!
     You don't hear anybody play guitar like that.  You see that don't you.
     I don't play like nobody.
Q:  Could you play RAG MAMA, RAG.  I never heard you do that.
A:  Do you know why I hardly never do anything like that?  Because its
cheap guitar playing stuff.  I don't play no cheap stuff.
Q:  Tell me about the tune GOIN' TO GERMANY.
A:  I heard a white girl downtown singing that song.  Downtown in the village
a couple of years ago. Before I moved off of Park Avenue.  A little girl
sung that and they didn't have nobody who knew how to get that thing together
with.  They didn't know how to get that thing stuck together - so I
said "let me have your guitar, I'll show you how."
 
You know some people who don't have a thing don't know how to do it.
Q:  Where did DELIA come from.
A:  That fellow I was telling you about, he's dead and gone now.  His name
was Porter Irving.
Q:  Did he write that song?
A:  I don't know where he got it from.
Q:  Where was her from?
A:  He was born in South Carolina from where I come from
Q:  When did you learn it?
A:  In 1912.
Q:  What are some of the words from DELIA (ALL MY FRIENDS ARE GONE)
A:  Ols sew woke up one morning, found all her pigs dead.
     Old Sew said to the bull, run!  we're bound to move our bed. 
     All the friends I had are gone.
