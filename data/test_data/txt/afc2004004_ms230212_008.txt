[Notes.  This song seems not only somewhat inconsistent in lyrics,
the meaning seems obscure.  Note that words like
"Déyso" & "Zis" have been interpreted as proper names.
Note that there is a village called Delices [Délis], near
La Reqine where the recording took place.  It is possible
that when the singers say "Déyso" they may mean "Délis O."
The closest creole term the translator knows to "Zis" is
"jik"; & "jik" means "right" as related to distance in
place.  So that "Zis la ba la ba" may well have been
a corruption of "jik la ba, la ba," which translates --
"right over there, over there."

"Pappy O" is a dear way of addressing a man -- especially in
the middle to old age group.  A close creole word is "pappiyon,"
which means "butterfly," or "moth."
