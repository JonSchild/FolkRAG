FARRELL - 
The Yogoslavians are not all against the Axis.  The
Chetniks under Mihailovich are all in the eastern part, in Serbia.
The Dalmatians and Croatians are quiet and many are with Italy.
"The Dalmatians, they're yellow," laughingly to husband, who is a
Dalmatian.  Farrell has Serbs, Dalmations, Croatians, all mingled
and inter-married.
