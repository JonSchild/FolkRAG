Kennedy: Is it?
Cox: It's about as old as I am. (more fiddle music)
You don't know what that is. (laughs) (mumbles)
Kennedy: What is it?
Cox: That's Transports:
Come all you wild and wicked youths,
Come listen unto me. . .

I know. I can't get high to that. You never heard that, ha'
you? That go like this here.

Come all you wild and wicked youths an' listen. . .
No. "Wherever you may be", I think. I don't know if I got
that right. "Listen unto me. . ."
Come all you wild an' wicked youths an' . . . wherever you may be
I pray now attention an' listen unto me.
The fate of a poor transport as you may understand,
The hardships they do undergo upon Van Dieman's Land.
You heard it?
Kennedy: That's Van Dieman's Land.
Cox: Yeah. That's a long song.
Kennedy: And your father used to sing that all through?
Cox: My mother used to             that. She used to sing that.
Kennedy: Do you know all the verses?
Cox: Yeah. Several.
Kennedy: It's a long one?
Cox:
Chained some unto a harrow, and some unto a plough. . .
Then there was - there was two songs taken from that. There's
another one. A different one. I've heard some o' it. Yes, I
know that, this one. That's a long one. Young Edmund, you
have heard that tune?
