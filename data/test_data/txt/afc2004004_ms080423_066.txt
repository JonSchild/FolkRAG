dead/  He's still alive.    well, well, well God's not dead/
He's still alive/  I can feel Him in my soul/  I can feel him
in my feet/  I can feel him all over me.   / Well he heals me
when I'm sick/  God's not dead (repeat 2x)   / I feel him all
over me./  Well he saved me when I's low -- God's not dead
(repeat 2x)/  I can feel him all over me/  Well he talked
to me this morning -- God's not dead (repeat 2x)/  I can
feel him all over me.
