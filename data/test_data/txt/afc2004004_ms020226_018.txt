have many a them now. But I heard people say they used to carry
them out an' -- all that stuff out [can't use it, an' let, ah'?] in the fields an' let -- strew
it. Now, who diseases ain't that? Layin' out there? See what
I'm talkin' about? Ya don't know whatcha eatin'.
   An' ah, but ah, I know that ah everything is changed. They
don't have much a that now, so I'm sure they ain't much a that to
be[in] done.

ah, they're diffrunt from any other thing -- any other green --
to eat. An' if you don't put the right kinda sal-- ah, season --

in the stem. Ya see? An' then you go cook it. A lot a folks

the way it-- it's what's in it. And, and, and, and, ah, you
know, and, and how it's raised, ya see? Just like -- A lot of
folks will jus' raise a thing jus' so fast [and all kinds ways. You take]

take it's co'se. Just let that pasture go on. Let is grow right.
