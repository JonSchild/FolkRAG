Now you talkin about cross-eyed peoples, I have saw
some crosseyed people!! I saw a man was so crosseyed that when
he cried, tears run down his back. . .

Well, Bill, look, have you ever seen a man they call
pop-eyed. . . You know, eyes boodge out, stick out like a crawfish
eye on a stem.

Yeah, I know what you mean.

Well, I saw a man with eyes so near up the top of his head
that when he get ready to see, he have to pull his hat off!

She was so cock-eyed that when she cried the tears
run down her back. She was so black till--I want you to know
she was the blackes[y]t woman I ever seen in my life---she would
just spit ink and when she blow her breath, it wouldn't be
anything but coal dust.

Talkin 'bout my girl, his girl's legs is so little and thin
look like she done swap leg with the kildee. But my girl's leg
everybody here tell you they's so big and got such a purty shape
that you start [at] a nickle down that ankle and it'll be big as
two dollar and half 'fore it get to the knee. . .
