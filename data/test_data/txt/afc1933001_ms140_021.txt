Dear Major Walker:

We shall be very glad to place a limited
number of records of American ballads at the disposal
of Miss Margaret Valiant for use in California
later this month. You understand, of course, that
these records remain the property of the Library of
Congress and will be sent as a loan.

Sincerely yours,


Chief, Division of Music
