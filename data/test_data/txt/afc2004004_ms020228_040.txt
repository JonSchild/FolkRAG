Then...springtime!   Papa foun'  that shoe!   An'    that was funny to

wasn'  nothin'  else for me to say,  ya see?   "Cause  they ain't  never

TL:     Bro.

BJ:     Yeah.  Gan.   (BECAUSE OF HER ACCENT IT COME OUT HALF-WAY BETWEEN
"GANE"  AND"GAN."  IN ORDER TO MAKE FOR EASIER READING, I HAVE TRANS-
SRIBED THE CORRECT SPELLING OF "BROGAN,"  AS I HAVE DONE WITH SIMILAR 
SLIGHT PHONETIC DIFFERENCES OVER  " STANDARD AMERICAN."  I.E.:   "SAID"
OCCASIONALLY COMES OUT XXXXX  HALF-WAY BETWAIN  "SAID"  AND  "SAYED." D.H.)
