That was in our family, too, but the bowels embalming verse
I got from print - from the Folksong Journal.  That also exists on
at least one broadsheet.
Lomax: Did your father sing that?
Lloyd: Yes, it's rather a common song in Lincolnshire.  Four or
five versions are in print and all from the Lincs. district.

Trees Are Growing Green:
1) As I was a-walking down by yonder church wall
 I seen four and twenty young men playing at the ball.
I asked them for my own true love, but they wouldn't let him go,
And my bonny boy's young but he's growing.

2) O mother dear mother, you've done me much wrong,
You've married me to a bonny boy whose age it is too young.
For his age is only twelve and myself scarcely thirteen,
Saying, the bonny boy's young but he's growing.

3) O daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong,
I've married you to a bonny boy who is a rich lord's son.
And a lady he'll make of you, that's if you will be made,
For that bonny boy's young but he's growing.

4) Well, so early in the morning at the dawning of the day,
They went out in the yellow field to have some sport and play.
And what they did there she never will declare,
But she never more complained of his growing.

5) At the age of twelve, then, he was a married man,
At the age of thirteen he was father of a son.
At the age of fourteen his grave was growing green,
And that was the end of his growing.

Lomax: What do you take that song to be anyway? I don't
understand the cultural contect.  Fourteen is not too young with
us? What's the real significance of that song?
Bert: I don't know.  Of course, the age varies in versions.
Lomax: Is this song a succubus do, you think?

The Cutty Wren:
1) "O where are you going?" said Milder to Malder.
"O we may not tell you," said Fessel to Fose.
"We're off to the woods?" said John the Red Nose,
"We're off to the woods," said John the Red Nose.
