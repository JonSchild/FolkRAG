Dear Mr. Randolph:

Do you know a Miss Gertie Colvin in Versailles,
Missouri? She has asked us for the loan of a recording
machine for recording ballads. Do you think it will be
possible for you to record her material for her. I can
see no point in sending two machines to the same area.

I am making some plans for a series of folk song 
fellowships to be submitted to the Rosenwald Foundation
for 1943-44. Would you be interested in continuing your
work under the terms of a Rosenwald Fellowship - about
$1500.00 plus material costs? My notion would be to 
cover the whole Ozark area if you have not yet been able
to do so. Let me hear from you about this in full. How
is your work coming along?

Sincerely yours,
