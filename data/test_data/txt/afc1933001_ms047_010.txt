in his political theories, he
is intelligent. Those two qualities
ought to help him along even in

My best regards to Mrs.
Spivacke and to all the
office [?]. Did [?]
ever get off to Macmillan
his Ea[????} Song preface?
No word has come to me
from Macmillans on their
print.
The Library of Congress means
far more to me now that
you are where you are.
Your friend,
John A. Lomax

Send to Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston, [S.C.] Ala., and
to Mrs. Minta Mangun, Bells, Texas, that parchment
acknowledgement of gifts to the Library of Congress, in each case numerous
records. Also to the Charleston, S.C. lady, whose name
escapes me.
