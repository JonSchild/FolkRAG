1.  I heard men in the street corner say that
the United States was going to beat the hell
out of Germany, Japan, Italy, but this was going
to be a long war, [I am] that we were going
to win.

2.  Some said that we were in a badder
condition that we think (in other words we are
losing the war)

3.  A teacher said that the United States does not
know how to fight.

4. But I myself think we are going to beat in a
long run.
