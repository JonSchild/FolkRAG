St. Simons Island, Ga.

Holy greetings to you all in Jesus' name. I am so glad for 
salvation in my soul today. I hope the same for you all. 
Please remember me in your prayers. 

I was just thrilled over our great trip to Minnesota. It 
was so nice and the people was so warm in every way, although 
the weather was cold. But the great welcome and loving and kindness 
of the folks made it very warm to us. I would love to go 
there again, and also "Newport," and I want to thank you from 
the very bottom of my heart for helping us to get over  __________. 
I love the way it is, for if I don't get much money I just want 
to spread the titles around of the good news of old times, and 
it seems like everywhere we go everyone loves us, and that means 
lots to me. 

I want to ask you, do the BMI know about all of the other 
songs on the other records? If not, please note them and mail 
them to the BMI, and it will help me. And please take care of 
this for me. They want to know every song on every album name 
by name; and if you can, please make me one whole record by 
myself sometime, some day. 

Please kiss Anne and Dena for me. Tell them I hope to see them. 
I wish I did not have to stay here, but I am tired now and I 
will make it somehow. My children say tell you you are the 
best man on earth. They talk about you all on their jobs and 
any where. So write.soon. 

Yours in Christ forever, 
Bessie Jones
