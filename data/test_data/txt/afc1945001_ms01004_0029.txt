of readiness. We know the strategic points on which to focus effort, key
people who can assist in studies, people who may be employed as volunteer
workers, and we have many avenues of contact for gathering information.
Our thought was that our equipment in the way of intimate knowledge of
Chicago together with facilities for the study of its people would enable
us in a particularly favorable way to undertake significant studies of
public reactions in this area to the war.

            In forming the Committee on Communications and Public Opinion,
we had in mind three objectives stemming from the combination of talent,
experience and facilities. First, the Committee has set up a curriculum
designed to train students to become specialists in the field of communications 
and equipped as public opinion analysts, propaganda analysts, specialists 
in race relations, students of rumor, myth, and informal communication, 
content analysts, and so forth. The second objective was to make
available our knowledge, experience and judgment to organizations, governmental 
and otherwise who might wish to call upon us for information and
counsel. The third objective was to inaugurate a series of research studies
bearing specifically on the reactions of people to the war. It is this
latter part of the program that I wish to speak of specifically since it
provides the frame-work of the proposal.

            Operating with funds generously supplied by the Social Science
Research Committee of the University of Chicago out of their limited
budget, the Committee is currently engaged in the following research studies.
