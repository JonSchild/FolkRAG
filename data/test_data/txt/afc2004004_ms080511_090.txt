That never happened while in Britain it -
itself, because the provincial life is held
on there in a way.  But Scots, Highlander,
ah, Lowlander, ah, Irish, Protestant, Catholic,
Welsh, ah, Suffolk, Cornwall, all come
together to pool their resources, and, ah,
with a big touch of the tarbrush have made
a new ah British musical culture that has a 
power of its own, independent of its origins,
independent of all the tragedies that produced
it.  It has its own firepower, its own growing
strength, and it is burgeoining now.  I  could
tell you, having just come back from there,
watching all the revival forms, watching
mountain women in their bouffant short skirts
freeing themselves from the, from the ah
strictness of their grandmother's life, ah,
whose skirts always came clean - clear down
to their shoe-tops, showing their legs off
in front of their proud male relatives, and
their marvellous new precision dances that 
[*17.16.53.00*]  could match ah, ah, the can-cans of Paris,
ah the bluegrass orchestra playing as, as, as
hot as ah, as a five piece New Orleans
jazz band, with ah new kinds of songs
