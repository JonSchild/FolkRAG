Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thank you for your interesting letter and kind comments about
our Bulletin and Society. If you have no objection I shall run
in our next issue your statement about Dean Hunter's article. I
shall also have a notice about you recent book.

I was glad to get from you the statement about the organization
of our state society. Your part in that organization is well
know to our old members, but some of our more recent members may
not know of it.  We are approaching our tenth anniversary, and I
was thinking that then it would be very appropriate to have at
our meeting and in our Bulletin an account of our organization
and work during the ten years.

If you ever have any articles or comments or notices that
you would allow our Bulletin to use, we shall appreciate your
sending them in.  It will be an honor and pleasure for us to
have you at our annual meeting.  I am sorry that we do not
have any funds to bring outstanding folklorists to our
meetings.  If you can arrange to be with us at our annual
meeting, we shall be honored to have you.

Your sincerely,

Edwin C. Kirkland
