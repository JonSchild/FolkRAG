San Antonio, Texas,
August 5, 1942
It is rumored that General McArthur has appointed a young
United States soldier, a West Point graduate in his late 20's,
Brigadier General of Infantry in Australia; that the news was
published in the home town paper of the young man, and was hushed up
by the War Department in the fear that the people in the United
States would think that General McArthur had very little leadership
to choose from, and was forced to place very young and inexperienced
men in commanding positions.
