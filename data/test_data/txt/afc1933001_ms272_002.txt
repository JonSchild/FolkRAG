Dear General Denig:

Thank you very much for sending me the song material used by Carlson's Raiders.  It is most interesting and just the kind of material which we like to have for our Archive.  I sincerely hope that some day one of Marines' recording machines will be in a position to catch these men while they are actually singing these songs.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Music Division
