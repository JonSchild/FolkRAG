Zion Traveler Church

They had a fine meeting.  Rev.
West certainly preach. The pastor 
took in 11 for membership.
The chorus furnished music
through out the program. They
sang very, very, nice.
Mr. Kyles will finish gathering
cotton this week,  They are
wrecking the land as fast as they
can.  Oh, the carpenters are
working too.
Good news at last Mr. Kyles
did get my house to fix it.  Mr.
Robert Dees and his helpers did
fine work.  It looks much better
inside.  Mr. Dees says he believe
in doing good jobs.  Mr. Dees
don't stop his work to talk. He
talks and works right on.  Mr.
Dees deserves what he makes.
He is a fine white carpenter.  Oh,
after they finished George, Edward 
and I had a time cleaning
off the yard taking those bricks
away.  They knocked down our
chimney, build us a flue and
bought us a heater.  I don't know
why Mr. Kyles don't give me my
present if he go much longer he
will have to double it.  He gave
us a new year bag but it didn't
come up to our anticipation like
those Christmas bag be's.
He gave the tenants a big time
Wednesday night before Xmas.
I didn't go.
Mr. Edison certainly has cleaned 
off the lake bank and planted
wheat and it is up and looking
green and pretty.
Mr. Jackson and Mr. Joe Shull
are looking after the places.
Mr. Edison took a trip Christmas 
and those turn rows certainly 
had a big rest.
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson Williams
are announcing the arrival of a 
fine son born Friday, Jan 2.
They gave it the name Wilson.
The proud parents are being
showered with congratulations
and wishes by their many
friends.
Mr. Celia Tucker is very sick.
She isn't improving very much.
Her children are here at her
bedside doing everything they
can for her.  She lives with her
daughter, Mrs. Ernesteen Davidson. 
They have my sympathy 
towards this matter.  I
have a mother and she has gotten 
of age.

ALL'S NOT PEACHES IN

per year in Georgia average 
$306 - slightly more than
one third the national farm income

No Lynchings In
Mississippi; 39
Escape Death
Here are the figures on lynch
ings for the United States for
1947.
Number of Lynchings.. Accord
ing to the records compiled in
the Department of Records and
Research of Tuskegee Institute.
I find that 1 person was lynch
ed during the year.  This is 5
less than the number 6 for
1946; equivalent to the number
1 for the year 1945; 1 less than
the number 2 for the year 1944;
amd 1 less than then number 3
for the year 1943.
The lynch victim was Willie 
Earle, a 24-year -old Negro
charged with stabbing and robbing 
a white taxi driver.  He 
was taken from jail by a mob,
which mutilated his body with
knife and bullet wounds.  The
state in which the lynching occurred 
was South Carolina.
Borderline Cases.  There were
3 borderline cases which are
not included in the total number 
of lynchings for 1947 because 
to date sufficient evidence 
concerning them has not
been obtained.  These cases are
as follows; Joe Nathan Roberts,
at Sardis, Ga; Red Marks, Tobe
Marks, Joe Wickerson and an
unamed Negro at Oakwood,
Fla.; and Charlie (Bud) Smith
in or near Angier, N.C. 

Capitol Dome
(By U.P.)
You could have frozen from
the ice in the house of representatives 

during President
Truman's state of the union
address.
And while we're speaking [fig]-
uratively --
You could roast from the republican 
heat generated by [?]
president tax brainchild.
This was not what the G.O.P.
had expected.  And the republican 
leaders see it all as a 
grand political move to put the
G.O.P. on the well-known hot
sport so far as taxes are concerned.  
And at the same time
