68 

In many a thing I did adore ; 
Of all I ever did possess,
I know religion is the best. 

And when my work id done below,
I hope to glory I shall go--
Meet all the saints who're gone before,
Where pain and parting are no more. 

And while the ample ages roll, 
We'll unite both body and soul, 
To be immortal and complete, 
And worship at the Savior's feet. 

But O alas !  on the left hand
Will stand a cruel, wicked band, 
Crying alas !  it's we are undone,
Our lamps are out--our race is run. 

No. 68 

O if poor sinners did but know, 
What I for them did undergo. 
They would not treat me with contempt, 
Nor curse me when I say, Repent. 

Give credit now, to what I say--
And mind it till the Judgment day-- 
Of God I'm sent--constrained to go,
To call poor sinners here below. 

My loving brethren think it strange,
Why I should leave my dearest friends, 
My children oft ask where I am,
And when I will come home again. 

From dearest friends I'm come away, 
Sinners to call, in this their day ; 
But O !  how many do I find, 
Who scoff and treat me so unkind !
