Alan Lomax.

Herewith is the gist of this review:


We have here an admirably conceived work, which,
although done with the greatest care,
is within the reach of everyone.  The authors have 
transferred to written notation the most attractive
and most characteristic anthology of phonograms from
the most valuable Archive of Washington.  ..  The anthology
can be used according to their wishes by anyone,
be they composers or scientists, for their
studies and inspirations, be they students, housewives
or radio performers.  That is ..they could be used if
it were not for the notice, absurd in my view, "All 
rights reserved",  which seems capitalistic and
unjustifiable.  The Lomaxes have used material belonging 
to a public institution, and it matters little
that it was collected byn them.  It was for that reason
they were appointed to remunerative positions.
This public material is published, but it becomes
"reserved"!  I do not wish to understand such a 
state of affairs.
