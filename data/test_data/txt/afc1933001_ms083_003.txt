Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am sorry to have to bother you again, but the
lawyers are after us to settle up this matter of the release
of AMERICAN BALLADS AND FOLK SONGS. I hope you
will keep the matter in mind and, as soon as you can get
in touch with Mr. Alan Lomax, will see that he signs the 
release prepared for his signature and will send it on to us so
that we in turn can forward it to the lawyers and clear
the files.

Sincerely yours,
June E. Stone
Secretary to Mr. Brett
