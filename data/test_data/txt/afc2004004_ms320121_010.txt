Tape 1356 cont.  Mrs. McGee    4

AL:     But Dennis had to move around a lot you say?
Dennis:     I moved around because I wanted to.   I want to change
place and get the best, but I nver find the best, I always
find the worst when I move.   Except when I came here.   When
I bought this place here, I put up my barbershop here, I make
$100, 125 a week with my shop.   Yeah, I make a lot of money,
a good living.   I paint that and make all repairs. . . . .
Mrs. McG:     Should have done that when we got married, we could
have educated our children, and give them what they need.
But he didn't want that.   Had to ride around and go around
the country, and farm here and farm over there, didn't do
nothing .
AL:     Life wasn't very easy for any Cajun women in those days.
They all got married too young. . . . .tell me about it.
Mrs. McG:     No, it was bad. . . . yes, that's right.  I got married
when I was 15.   Of course I was too young, 15 years old.   And
he was 32.
AL:     Life was hard on women in general, wasn't it?
Mrs. McG:     Yes.   Well, they didn't have no washing machines,
they had to wash the clothes on washing boards, and heat
some water in the black pot outside, I did many washings like
that.   A lot.   It was hard on me.  And every 2 years I had
a baby.   Everywhere I move I had a baby.   That's the truth.
Two years apart, of my children exactly two, the first two
are fifteen months apart.   All the others are 2 years apart.
