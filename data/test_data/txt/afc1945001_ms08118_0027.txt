Anecdote

One day a lady wet to the grocery store to
get some groceries, and she said to the
grocery man: "Will you give me a
pound of butter," and he answered: "You'll
have to take care of this because this is
your last pound of for this month. She
answered with a smile "I have solved
that problem, at dinner whenever we
have a guest I always heat the knives."
