News of the War

    I read in a paper about
 the Germans trying to launch 
 a pincers movement against
 Allied troops in North Africa.  
 The Germans intend to march 
through France, then come 
through Girbraltar.  The other
 Germans will come through 
Spain and attack the Allies
 from the rear.  If the Germans
 succeed in this, they may
 possibly cross the strait
 of Gibraltar, and this will
 allow them to accomplish
 their aims.
       Meanwhile  the Allied
 troops are awaiting the 
Germans and they are whipping
 the Germans in this 
territory, so that when the
 other Germans hear about 
the Allies victory over these 
Nazis, they won't bother to 
attack as they had planned.
