Dear Mr. Engel:

Since January 1 here are 
some of the misfortunes that 
have come my way:

1. Alan and I have each undergone 
operations followed by a stay 
in the hospital. In addition, I suffered 
a recurrent attack of malaria 
acquired last summer on the 
Convict Farm at Angola, Louisiana.

2. Our car was stolen (transmission 
and doors were locked), 
stripped even of its wheels, and 
we lost heavily in personal supplies
