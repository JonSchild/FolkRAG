DearMr. Rickard:

I have the manuscript and I'm sending it on to Macmillan
Company in New York. I had hoped to to take it up in person, but
I'm not able to make the trip. A little later, I will, and talk
the matter over if they don't come to a decision before then.

With sincerest regards, I am, 

John. A. Lomax
