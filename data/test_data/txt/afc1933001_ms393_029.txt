The songs of the the Negros are full of love for people, they are lonely for people, and they are full of hunger for people and gentleness and kindness in this world.  These songs rose up out of slavery, out of misery.  They jumped up out of the levee camps, they jumped down in turpentine camps and down in the back alleys.  The people got happy and made them up in churches, the people go high and made them up at dances; they rose up out of tough people and good people.  Some of these people were so mad that they could kill you and when some of these people had the quiet blues, they were so quiet you could hear them think for miles away.  Some of these people could look past poverty and misery, they could look clean through the darkness and despair and ignorance and see something on the other side.  The old folks said "On the other side of Jordan."  These songs rose up without them having to think about them, because they were lonesome for more kindness and goodness and richness than they could find in life right where they were.

And the last song in the program is going to be "Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham."

Encore "Run Sinner run"
