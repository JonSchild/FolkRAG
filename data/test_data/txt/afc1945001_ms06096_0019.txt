Seattle, Washington
August 7, 1942
There were 9 planes at Dutch Harbor (PBY's) 2 on the runways and 7 on
scout duty, when attack came on June 3. Two on ground demolished, 3 of others
finally lost. No pursuit planes at all in area. Civilian employee of Army
just returned from Alaska says enlisted personnel of Army are worst rumor mongers
and tale carriers up there.
