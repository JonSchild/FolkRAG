We are engaged in TOTAL WAR. To win this type
of war, we must go "all-out", we can't do it "with one
hand tied behind our back". Rumors tie [one of] our hands.
The one about war bonds not being redeemed, makes people
unwilling to buy the bonds and tends to encourage inflation;
the one about waste at army camps makes people resentful and
unwilling to contribute to salvage campaigns; those about the
Negroes, the Jews, the British, prevent full cooperation
for the united front for victory. Rumors are dangerous sometimes
because of the information they spread, and most of the
time because of the misinformation they spread.

Rumors should be looked at in at least two ways.
The recent study by the Office of War Information shows that
[on the one hand] while rumors have meaning for the state of people's
information, they also reflect aspects of people's morale
and attitudes. To eliminate rumors, we must provide the
needed information and we must also attend to the psychological
factors that were underlying the spread of the rumor.
The rumor, "While American boys are fighting in many places
of the earth, British citizens living in this country escape
military service" might be "answered" by the facts concerning
eligibility for the draft and the inclusion of British in
our selective service system; but it SHOULD be approached
