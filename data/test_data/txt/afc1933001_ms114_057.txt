My Mother was Irish-----O'Moore way back, Father-English. How often I envy my sister NOT her beauty but her BIG [sha] share of Mama's Irish--- )

DON'T come in mid-summer. Indian summer HEAVEN here.-[?] July! With every good wish from all except Frizzle--- (and who knows ? Maybe her spirit too salutes you! Zackie found only a big handful of creamy , curly feathers-----it sounded like a f fox. Kinder queer that she has just gone and you said you wanted to see her!) Almost every  negro has one or more. They scratch up cunjur bags and, protecting  you so fill themselves with poison that THEY ARE TOO POISONOUS for food ! I had a time buying mine. She was named 'Eleanor' for the woman who reluctantly parted with her. Wish you were here to end the story right . In the story 'Frizzle' died too. [but]---

Well I'll start again to say 'Good-night'----
