Dear Bill:
It is now three o'clock Wednesday evening
and I am just starting to find the people for
the program. I may come dragging back about Monday
or sooner, but in any event, I suggest that you
schedule a dress rehearsal and etc. with Miss Gillis,
W.J.S.V. She doesn't sound any too happy about it.
I'll write you or wire you when I have definite news
about everything.
Alan
