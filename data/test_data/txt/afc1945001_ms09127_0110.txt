A
War Anecdote    

The Japs are very tricky soliders as 
one Marine knew.  While on night patrol 
in the jungle depths, he heard sounds of 
men approaching.  He challenged them and 
was answered in very good English: "It is 
only a Marine officer returning with a 
platoon of men.  Restrain your fire."  
The Marine fired immediately at the 
voice, because he knew no challenged 
American would answer like that, so he 
blasted the very correct Jap.
