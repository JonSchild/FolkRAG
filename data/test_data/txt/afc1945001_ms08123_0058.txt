1.  There is a rumor going around
that Hitler is dead, this is because
he has not made his last two
speeches.
2.  There is a rumor that Hitler is
taking brain treatments from a
famous brain specilist who was
called to Germany and hasn't been
heard of since.  It is also said
that this brain specilist was once
taken before five men all looking
like Stalin.  One of the men took
brain treatments.
3.  Another rumor I have heard
is that the Germans take the
dead bodies of Jews and use
them to make fertilizer.
4.  Another rumor told is that
quantities of horse meat is being
sold at retail groc. in place of beef
in the Chicago area.  The only
horse meat sold here is at pet shops
to be sold as dog food.  Remember
Chicago is the greatest meat packing city
