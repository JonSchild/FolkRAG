She's more dear than anything in the world that you have .ANd
if you had to leave or something, die; you say don't let
this bother you now, don't aggrevate your mind. You just
live on like you have and you can come to me. There's a place
in Heaven where we can rest. That meant great things, you 
know, in the rememberings of people. And they depended on 
it, not like they are today. Now they'll say, there ain't no
law, that's old stuff, that's fogey, but that's what God
had put out for the people when they felt bad. It was a
real deep remembering in their lives. And when they felt
that way, the wife would say, well, he's gone, I can go to him.
He can't come back to me, but I can go to him. It helped
them mountain people......yeah, they would sing that in the
Baptist churnch and they'd sing it at funerals, and old
people would gather up and sing it. They thought it was
a great song, it was a great song..... it is a great song.
And you never hear nobody sing it, they're all dead and gone.
Ain't noone I know of now that sings that song.

AL: Do you sing Lay my Body Down,......?

Nimrod: No, I used to sing that.......I know so many, I 
guess a million songs. I do a lot fo em, Travelling Creature.

AL: You have a song about Thomas with the nails in his hand.

Nimrod: Oh yeah, that was an old one. You know, the Lord
spoke to Thomas and Thomas, he was a doubter. He said, no,
it can't be the lord, he's dead. And he said, Thomas, accept.
