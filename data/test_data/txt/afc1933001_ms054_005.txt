act of Congress.

I write especially to inform
you that unless you and Alan,
either or both, tell me that you can
loan me a recording machine
I shall be forced to buy one, the
product of which I shall not feel
obligated to turn over to the Library
of Congress. Also, I wish
to inquire whether you think the
Music Division of the Library, with 
its various charming officials,
could stand the strain of the presence
of Miss Terrill and myself for
a few months? A little later,
when the fishing is not so good
and the fiddler crabs too busy with
their bodies to furnish their nightly
concerts, we may come up.

Till then, and later, believe me, in high
extreme, believe me, always sincerely, John Lomax
