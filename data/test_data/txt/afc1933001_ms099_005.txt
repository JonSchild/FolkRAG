Dear Mr. Lomax:
                              I thought you would be interested in this letter.
                              It is difficult for me to understand how anyone who loves folk music and presumably the common people who are responsible for folk music, can feel, this way about liberals and progressives, and can dismiss these millions of people in such light fashion. I am sure you do not agree with this point of view.
                      
                               With kindest regards,
                             
                                                 Sincerely yours, 

                                                        (Signed)

                                                  James A. Dombrowski
                                                  Executive Secretary
