 Then some of us sometimes talk to much about what we got.
Then when you be talking you gonna lose, and cause somebody else
to lose. [_________] say I want you to listen to this, if you go,
whatever your name, by yourself, go by yourself, you come
out better. If you kill a man, then you kill him by yourself.
Don't you carry nobody else with you if you kill him. Cause the
rest of them are gonna put it on you and you gonna go to the chair,
you understand. Hear what I'm talking about. Hear that man?
LARRY:
I know that.
GARY:
Don't never kill a man with somebody, kill him by yourself.
If you going to kill him, kill him by yourself.
LARRY:
Hmmmm
GARY:
You know how to take it when you kill him by yourself.
You know its all on you, you understand. But you with somebody
else, and they help kill him you understand, they put it all on
you, that ain't right either.
LARRY:
You going to tell a good lie, You rehearse that lie about
two or three weeks before you tell it, that way you won't 
forget it.
GARY:
That's right. One time a man found some money one time,
in a five gallon ____ told somebody about it he had to give
