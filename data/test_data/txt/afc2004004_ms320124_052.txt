ANCELET  His music has got a lot of energy
in it and it's, and it's high and low and, and it changes a
lot.  Whereas, it, it's not the same in both communities.
:  Yeah.  A Cajun dancer like a smooth, a
smooth music, something that you can dance and, and, and you
keep the beat, you know, right.  And when they start, like
dancing, well then it's going to keep on 'till the last.
You're considered a good musician if you can do that, you
know.
ANCELET  That's right.  You know the
different kinds of prac, dance, dance hall practices are
indicative of this thing, too.  In Cajun dance halls they
would go and spread cornmeal or flour or something on the
floor to make the dancing, the dance steps slip along
smooth.
:  That's right.
ANCELET  Where in the black community they
never did that.
:  Uh-huh.
ANCELET  You were supposed to be able to
catch your step to be able to move fast and jump and, and. . .
:  That's right.
ANCELET  . . .that kind of thing.  Does that
make sense?
LOMAX  Oh yes.
