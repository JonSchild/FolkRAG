English.

A boy upon arriving home after
six months in the army, found that
his mother had prepared her menu
for the days in which he was going
to be home.  It included all the 
dishes he loved.  In this menu there
were Chicken Pie, Turkey, Steak, Apple
Pie and cheese, and Lemon Cream Pie.
The mother was sure that he would
be pleased so she asked him how
he liked it.  He told her all these
dishes were just what they have in the
army, but he would "love" to have
some beans.
