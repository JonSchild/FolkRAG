Lomax: It's very peculiar that after all this time you didn't
get your teeth fixed in. You could have.
Barry: I could have.
Lomax: I don't understand. It's the most important thing in a
woman's face, the teeth.
Barry: That's it, you see.
Lomax: It matters to you as a singer, too.
Barry: It is. You know, I've only eight teth in my mouth altogether.
Just 8 teeth. Four in the bottom.
Lomax: You must not have looked after them very well.
Barry: Well, I had a very nice set of teeth, you know, when I was
sixteen. And then they started to decay.
Lomax: You must have been beautiful in that day, Margaret.
Barry: You see, the thing is, I never looked into that affair.
Lomax: Didn't you care whether you were beautifl or not ?

Lomax: You're a very handsome woman now, you know.
Barry: I just tell you, you see. I suppose they may say it among

whether I was good-looking or bad-looking. And I never got that word
from them. Even anyone like, never told me that I was nice-looking.
Lomax: Now, Margaret, I don't beleive that. I don't know why, but
I don't think you're telling me the truth.
Barry: Well, I am, because I've never got anyone to tell me yet.
Lomax: Well, lots of men tell very plain women that they're
beautiful in order to make them feel good. You know that. That's
the habit of men. And I can't understand how they wouldn't tell you --
as you're a handsome looking woman, with a good figure and a good
head of hair and all that, that they didn't tell you you were
