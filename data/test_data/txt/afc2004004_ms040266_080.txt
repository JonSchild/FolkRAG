me to go to Holland for a course in Morris Dancing. We both suspect that the society must feel ashamed whenever your name is mentioned, and from our observations at your lectures at the Westminster Library, feel that they have too many "horsey" members, with the benevolent -squire-patting the yokel's head idea.
I work at the Air Ministry, London. The department has a large music circle. With the aid of my friend, I should like to introduce American and British Folk-Song to them, but I naturally have to illustrate any talk; as the circle is a private group, am I allowed to use your recorded songs? I have been told at the American Embassy of international strife and bloodshed if I use American material; a postcard from you would leave my conscience clear.
May I also remind you that you talked about allowing me to record some Conyers Recordings you carry with you? And to conclude this lengthy letter, may I thank you for bringing to the BBC your wonderful programs. I assure you that your last series caused much comment in my workplace; a remarkable thing, among Civil Servants! I intend to introduce them to Bozie Sturdivant singing "Aint no Grave".

Yours Faithfully
