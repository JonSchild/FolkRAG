BALLAD O THE RIEVIN 
O THE STANE
O, the Stane, the Stane, the Stane o Scone,
The Stane o Destinie,
O, whar did it cam fae
And whar did it flee,
It's fa took it this time?
And fa's got it nou?
The yane that had it last time
Canna get it nou.
Some tell it cam frae Ireland,
But lang it bade at Scone,
Till Teddy Langshanks snitched it
That daurna snitch the croun.
Syne, lang it bade in London toun,
Royal Dowps on it did rest,
Till a skeelie Scot reift it awa
Sae Geordie's sair " distresst ".
The Dean o Westminster, he was there,
And he did fidge and fizz,
An made muckle maen for the Stane was gane
That aye he'd thocht was his.
The Dean's awa to seek it,
Til the " ends o yerth " he's gane-
O, whatna collieshangie
Owre an orra lump o stane!
Awa, guid Dean, and seek it !
-G n your word means oct ava-
But I dout the lips o the Scoto-Brit
Gied just the usual blah..
Meanwhile The Times does thunder
And the ither jackals yap,
And the polis o the kingdom
Bizz round in a fearfu flap.
They explorit ilka avenue,
Unturned left neer a stane,
Till in the end they had to send
For the Man wi the X-ray een.
Frae the Lawlands o Holland they brocht him,
And the bobbies' sperits rose-
" We'll no be lang," the Inspector sang,
" Nou we've got the Wizard of Oz!"
