On [the] [upper] one side of Frank's horse swung a dozen frying-sized chicken, balanced on the other by a dozen dressed squirrels, [he had] killed that morning as the robbed the fields of ripening corn bordering the Bosque River bottom.  On his saddle horn in front of him he held a huge [sack] basket of fresh-picked black-eyed peas.  I rode on a sack, one end of which held a huge watermelon, the other stuffed full of roasting-ears, fresh young corn just ready for eating.  Previously in front I carried dozens and dozens of fresh eggs gathered from the barn trough and back yard.
