                      Quincy, Massachusetts

   SUBJECT:   On Rumors Current in the Quincy Area
                      From August 3, 1942 through August 8, 1942

A neatly dressed man called at this office on August 14, 1942 
and requested information as to what amount he could expect to receive 
in the form of Old-Age Benefits when he attained age 65. He stated 
that he was 40 years of age and had never worked a day in his life. 
The provisions of the Social Security Act were explained to his 
apparent satisfaction.

He very leisurely but purposely digressed to other subjects 
not directly related to this program. His manner was arrogant and 
he had all the earmarks of a "wise guy."
