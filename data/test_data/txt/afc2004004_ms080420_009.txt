Time Code: #2 cont. Tape: APPALACHIA MAGGIE VALLEY

Kyle: Oh yeah, it's family oriented, family style, at
least our style is. We've got...well, it's a freedom
dance, where you're able to do your own thing. You get
out there and enjoy yourself and have a good time. And
it's for all ages and no other sport is. And we got it
developed to an art.
AL: Well, that all began [with] in Baskam with [?] Lunsford, didn't it?
When he had the festival in Asheville, and then he asked
you all to train teams that competed. Before that, square
dancing had been an informal community event, and it then
became competitive. Isn't that what happened?
Kyle: Yeah, that's the way we got started in competition,
in this part of the country and, I think, more or less all
over the United States. It started right here in Balkam and
Hayware County. But it's always been a family thing, where
you could go in the back room and if you didn't have 2 couples,
you could still have a square dance with the mountain style.
And it goes back for a lot of years.
AL: When did the clogging start? They used to have square
dances, and then there was clogging. Those two were separate
things. You had solo cloggers and that still exists in the 
mountains, and all over the country. But it was here that
clogging actually was combined with square dancing, isn't
that right?
