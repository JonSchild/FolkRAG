of light and air and sunshine.
  Please give my love 
to Mrs. Terrell Lomax and 
to Miss Bess Brown — I
will be writing to both of
them soon — Mrs. Lomax
has written me such gracious
letters and I ungraciously
have not even replied. I hope
you explain charitably to
her this letter-writing
weakness of mine.
  Much love to you both.
I have missed you terribly
— the flashing gaiety of
Mr. J. A. and the tender
understanding of Mr. A. J.
Affectionately,
[M?]ary Elizabeth B.
