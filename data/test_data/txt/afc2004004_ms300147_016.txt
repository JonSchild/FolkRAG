Dear James,
     Everybody who has heard your tapes has been most
enthusiastic, and I'm sure I'll find a market for it.
The delay has been caused by the difficulties of
listening and dubbing the stereo tapes, for stereo is
new even here in New York. Thanks for the notes about
the two songs.
     I'll be writing again soon. Keep your fingers
crossed! All the best to you and the boys,

                                                Alan Lomax.
