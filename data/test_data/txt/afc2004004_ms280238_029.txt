Annie Johnson: And what did you say then?
Mary Gillis: I wasn't saying much --- less I would give her a

knife because 'twas too dangerous.
Lomax: What about other little jingles and dandling songs?
Marry Gillis: O, there was nothing like that to be found.

Lomax: Do you have any of those, Annie? Do you have one of those
dandling songs?
Annie Johnson: That song. . . .
Lomax: Do you have another?
Annie Johnson: That was a test piece. . . . and they were singing it
like this. . . (SHE MIMICS). . . Oh, very, very bad!
