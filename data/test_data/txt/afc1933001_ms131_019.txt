Dear Mr. Lomax:

    I am glad to know from your letter of March 12
that you will be here for our meeting, and I assure you that
you are still on the program - very much so.
    I have just finished mailing out 100 invitations
to members and other interested persons, and am now writing to
some people who, I hope, will sing for you. Just now I am on
the trail of some singers (one in particular) here, but don't
know yet what luck I'm going to have. I'm glad you'll be here
a day or so before the meeting; that will give us a chance to
talk over plans and to make an itinerary. Doubtless there are
songs in Brown County, but, strange to day, none of mine have
come from that section.
    Thank you for accepting our invitation. I am
looking forward to meeting you.

    Sincerely yours,
    Paul G. Brewster
