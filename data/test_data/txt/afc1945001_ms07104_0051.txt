Anti-Russia

1. I can't understand why we love Russia so much. It will never 
do anything for this country. We will never win the war by 
helping Russia--the only way we can win is by helping ourselves 
and quit scattering our forces all over the world. (These 
statements made by unknown white person in poorer district of 
Phoenix. 8-8-42)  [*2*]
