DERAR Miss Terror and family;
And here comes MAY. It is 
a long time between drinks.Please when(if) you come (and you 
must) via Murrells Inlet bring along the paper tothe CLUB so 
I can read about the nicknames.I want one or two and I know you've
the[n] cream in your collection.

The trip to SANDY ISLAND  ,ox cart and all  , will be arranged.
We'll have a basket which I will give Lillie time to 
fix. If you will we'll bed you down at Hermitage.Just quiet
and saves pennies. Papa would be made happy. He don't want
ME because I have three boys and he is unfortunately built 
not to enjoy youth.-----I must have that trip to remember you
all by when I'm a grandmother rocking babies by the fire and 
singing;
"Mama's gone to wash
Papa's gone to plow
Bye-o-baby
Baby WOULDN'T go to sleep."
This morning I played A.W.O.L.to hear Allan's program and 
it didn't come on.Time changed again?
Dr.Putnam was in twice this spring(His daughter has one
piece standing in museum here) He said among other things that your Allan has the 
most beautiful, spontaneous, flow of language of any young man he
knows just from college.  I have enjoyed few things more than
the program of R.Road Work Songs. It was a gem--a jewel.  The
one about the Canaler was fine too but the reception not so
good.They should ALL be repeated.
Say you are coming don when
Love from
The Chandlers.

Rev. Pinacle still around.  His successor
helped raise my Big Tom and will give us any thing in
his heard.  I will line him up
