brothers commissary.
Natchez:  Did you ever work for Charley?
The Kid:   Sho, man, yes.
Natchez:  I worked for him, myself.  He was a bad man to my idea.
                He was a fella that didn't [x] 'low a man to quit
                a job unless he told him to or unless he got tired
                of him and drove him away.  Is that right? 
The Kid:   That's the way it was.
Natchez:  An' I-I couldn' hardly describe him, you know what
                 I mean?  It's hard for a Negro to talk like a white
                 man anyway.  Fact of the business, he was one of those
                 real Southerners an' he had a voice there that'd
                 scare you to death whensonever he'd come out with
                 all that crap... He'd walk out there with his shirt 
                 sleeves rolled up. Didn't care how cold it was...
The Kid:    Didn't make any difference what time it was...
Natchez:   Night or day, didn't make any difference...He'd make
                 you get up all different hours of the night...
The Kid:    Yeah, Bill, and they still have that old eight hour
                 shift down there, you know what I mean? (Laughing)
                 Eight hours in the morning and eight more in the afternoon.  
                 That make sixteen hours a day.
Natchez:   That's right, too. Yeah, it is. And we'd be singin'
[The Kid]   to them mules...
                      I asked Mister Charley
                      What time o' day?
                      He looked at me, [xxxxx]
                      Throwed his watch away.
