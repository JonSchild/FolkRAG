Rumors of War 

Ever since the first news that
food was going to be rationed, 
people began to buy and stock 
their cupboards up with can goods. 
Finally, the day has come, where 
no can goods could be purchased 
without a ration book.  So the words
have begun to come forth from 
the mouths of people, that we, 
who live in the United States, 
will starve before this year is
ended.  But each day something
that is now on the ration list is 
being cancelled off.  Our government
still has enough freedom to say
that people may eat and not starve.
