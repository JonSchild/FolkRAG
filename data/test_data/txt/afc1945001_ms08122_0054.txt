A              A Story

When my god father came
home on furlough he told us
a story about his captain. 
About fifteen men were crossing
a little pond and one
of the fellow's started to go[ing]
down so the captain went after
him, the captain saved this
soldier but he never did come up.
My god father said that they 
all turned back to the camp
and reported the bad news
and the next morning they
were going to start out again.
