Dear Sir:

I am the manager of the Bessie Jones Georgia Sea Island
Singers and understand that you have made tapes of the
singers. I would like to know for what purposes and
under what terms the music was recorded, as the singers
do not have much information about it except that you
had promised to send the tapes either to me or to
Prestige Records. As yet, neither of us has heard
from you.

Please let me hear from you at your early convenience.

Very truly yours,

Alan Lomax
