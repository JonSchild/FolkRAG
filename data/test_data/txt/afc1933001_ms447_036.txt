Men at Work

CHORUS
Way, haul a - way, Haul a - way, my Ros - y.
Way, haul a - way, Haul a - way, my John- sy - o.______

1 You talk about your harbor girls
Around the corner Sally.

Chorus:
Way, haul away,
Haul away, my Rosy;
Way, haul away,
Haul away, my Johnsy-o.

2 They couldn't come to gee
With the girls from Ruble
Alley.

3 I once had a French girl,
But she was all a-posy.

4 Now, I've got an English girl,
I treat her like a lady.

5 When we sailed into Glasgow,
I met a bonny lassie;

6 She was handsome, young, and
fair,
And sweet as 'lasses candy.

7 Oh, once I was in Ireland
Digging turf and praties,

8 Now, I'm in a Yankee ship,
A-hauling sheets and braces.

9 Oh, once I had an Irish girl
And she was fat and lazy;

10 And next I got a German girl
And she was fat and grazy,

11 And now I've got a Yankee girl
And she damn near drives me
crazy.

12 Then we sailed away from Liverpool,
Bound for Rio Janerio;

13 We loaded cargo there, my 
boys,
And we took it mighty easy.

14  Now, we're homeward bound
again
And we're feeling mighty easy.
