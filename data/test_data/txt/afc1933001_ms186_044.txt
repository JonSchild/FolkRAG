Box 12
Falmouth, Michigan

Dear Mabel Christie:

I should very  much like to receive 
from you a list of the old songs and ballads
that are traditional in your family.
Naturally, I should be delighted to obtain 
copies of whatever material that you know
is truly folk-song. 

Thank you very much for your letter.

Sincerely yours,
