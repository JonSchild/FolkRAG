Sweet sound of voyaging comes
from the props and the
swirling up of the Minch waters
Today all way round this
lovliest of the Hebridean Islands
in sun & in mist, the songs
have echoed, bird lifting
upon the wave songs & now
a girl is singing them as we're
rolling out of the harbor.
   Once - tho -
off to Glasgow London
Paris - from the purest place
the sweetest people I've
ever met. Hope some of 
its lodged in this [rocky?]
limpeted heart.
