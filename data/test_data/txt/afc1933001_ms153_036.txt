take Monday, I'll go. No sooner is her back turned than the
witch spits on the floor and takes Monday. The whole thing,
beginning with the teakettle, is repeated over and over again,
until the witch has taken Sunday, and then the daughter herself.
The mother goes about calling Monday, Tuesday, Wed., etc. then
comes to the witch and asks about her children. Witch - they're
not here. -- Mother -- I'll come in and look anyway-- You can't
come in - your shoes are too dirty. --I'll take them off--Your
feet are too dirty -- I'll wash them --They'll still be too
dirty -- I'll cut them off -- They'll bleed -- I'll tie a rag
around them. -- You still can't come in. Mother forces her
way past the witch, who runs off, and finds the children amid
general rejoicing.

We also used to play a game in which three of the children
separated from the others, then came to meet them, singing
Here came three knights a-riding, riding, riding, Here come
three knights a-riding, a ranson, tanson, tee, i, o.
What are you riding here for, etc.
We're riding here to get married, etc. After some further
business which I don't remember very well, they pick out three
girls for their brides and go off with them.

I hope you will find these memories useful

Yours sincerely,
Mrs. H.G. Landon
