Chris got his five days extension and left yesterday early for 
Lubbock to wind up some business and then to come by and see
his mother.  I expect him Thursday.  We still may come to Houston
either Friday or Saturday afternoon, andmay bring the
Chubbocks with us.  I will let you know if I have the chance. 

I have finished the course and doing another

Love, 
Shirley
