5. Frank Goodwyn is going with me
to visit some singing Mexicans
far out in the mesquites of the
King Ranch. Especially I am
to record all the cattle cries
of the "bush-poppin'" cowboys.

6. Will need a convertor,
but I'm temporarially borrowing John Foulk's
outfit. As soon as I hear
from Mrs. Tartt I'll
have you ship a convertor to
Livingston. Few country homes or churches
of that section have electricity.

7. Well, everything might 
be worse!

8. The SMU people wanted you
back on their regular course, I'm glad
to tell you.    Lovingly,
Father
