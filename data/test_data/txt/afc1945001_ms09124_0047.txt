The Negro has come a long way in 
the last fifty years, if slowly.  There is
still a long way to go before equality is
attained, but the pace is faster, and
never faster than now.
For many years we had picked the
cotton, done the housework, carried on
strong shoulders heavy burdens.  Beyond
these limited opportunities there are
now new horizons.
We are not ashamed of working with
our hands, of an honest day's work,
honestly done.  But a progressing 
world now offers many of us a chance
to prove ourselves in serious jobs and
occupations.  These are the things we do,
these and many more.  We are 
doctors and lawyers; we are the skilled
and unskilled laborers who man the
war industries; we are the clerical
help and the white-coated porters; we
are Americans.  These opportunities
and the promise of still greater opportunities
in the future are our stake in America.
