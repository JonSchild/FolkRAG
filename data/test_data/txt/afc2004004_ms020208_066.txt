Reverend Roe. Reel 16. P. 1
I said, we had a watch meeting on the last night in the year. They
all on their knees praying, and when the bells ring and the gun begin
to shoot, why, then they get up and go to singing a good song and
shaking hands.
My father, he wasn't treated so bad like Mother. But Mother, she was
treated pretty bad at times. First she was whipped and then my oldest
brother, too, her first child, he knew a  little bit about
slavery, and when they whipped Mother, she would fight. Why, they'd
just have to tie her, and he saved even a lash with some of her blood
on it and kept it, you know, for years  after Surrender.
They would drive e m, you know, from one place, you know, to another.
Carry them to the auction block, you know, to sell em; have their
hounds, and things. And now on one occasion there was an old man
there, Old Man Singer, and he had a lot of hounds, and she said she
have known him, Old Man Masinger, to make one of those women at that
hound, have intercourse with her. She said she had known him to do
that. They'd drive em, you know, from one place to another, and as
they git up, at the auction block, you know, they'd git up, them that
they want to sell, you understand, and they'd carry em from, haul em,
to thr auctionnblock where they gonna auction em off, and a lot of 
white folks had to buy em, and they'd stand em up on the auction block.
And sometime they'd take your clothes off, and look you over [up], and see
how you was built up, and everything, and the officer, you know, they'd
sell it to the highest bidder. That was pretty bad.
A: Would your mother cry when she was telling you these stories?
R: Oh yes, quites often, yessir, very often. And we'd get mad, and
we'd want to kill somebody.
A: What did you say?
R: We'd get mad and say we'd kill em [?all likea that] but we was just kids; we couldn't
do nothing
