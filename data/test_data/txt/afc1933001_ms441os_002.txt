Mr. John A. Lomax
Wilton, Conn.

Kind sir:

Replying to your letter of the 12th, I am enclosing herewith copy of record of No. 42738 - Walter Boyd, about whom you inquire. You will note he had one escape charged against him, but that he was recaptured the same date and all punishments and lost time was immediately set aside by the Board.

Trusting this gives you the information desired and with kindest regards, I am. 

Yours truly,
Lee Simmons
General Manager,

LS/w.
Encl.
