in particular, has shown the sustained interest in a well-taught course based
upon a wide selection of materials (WXLC's library was open to the teacher.)

I have also been designated Public Relations Officer for the Alaskan
Sector and in this capacity have been editing "The Aleutian," of which I trust
you have been getting copies. This is about to be abandoned for a larger
magazine with the same name but covering all service men in the chain, from
Attu to Kodiak. I have fought for months for this Army-Navy-Marines-Coast Guard
periodical, concerned solely with this region, and I hope to be able to write
you within a few weeks that first publication date has been set.

One last matter--please send me details of the composing contests of which
we spoke. I shall give them wide publicity if they warrent your recommendation.

On all the above and anything else that concerns Alaska about which you
want to know, please do call on me for any help I can give. As you know, all of
my enterprises are designed to include the Army and I spend so much time in Army
posts that I can provide most information on them that you may want.

My very best to Frank Keppel when you see him, the fine people in
Special Service's Music Section, and, most of all, the warmest of personal
regards to you.

Sincerely,

Bill Price
