One Day for Recreation: (Macarronic)
One day for recreation
I spied a charming fair maid
She was singing like an angel.
I whispered soft and easy. . . .
Her amber locks most neatly
Hung down her back and fair waist
I asked her was she the fair one
Or the bright silvester lady?

She answered me most daintily
I fear you are a rake.
Indeed I am no rake
I'm a pupil of Jack Gleason.

I asked her who her father was
I knew I stood in danger.
If I had you in a near grove
Your handsomeness do tease me.

Her silver looks so charming. . .
You'll give me stockings afair. . .
And then she sang most charming
My darling, I am fond of you. . . . . . . . . .
