   In 1928 her first book was published, RED
HEELS, whose popularity has carried it through
ten editions.  Next came her I KEEP A RAINBOW,
now in a third edition) published as
winner of the Book Publication Award of The
Poetry Society of Texas;  and upon her appointment
by the Texas Legislature as Poet Laureate,
her latest book, ACORN ON THE ROOF, was
issued.
   Among the periodicals in which her poems
have appeared are:  Goodhousekeeping, Ladies'
Home Journal;  Century, Country Gentleman,
Southwest Review, Kaleidograph, Contemporary
Verse, The Buccaneer, Holland's Magazine, Poetry
and the Play (England), The New York
World, The Texas Federation News, and many
others.
   After RED HEELS was published, Lexie
Dean Robertson began making public appearances
and reading from her book.  Her fame
as a reader has spread until she has had engagements
in all parts of Texas and in various other
states.  During one of her programs a member
of the audience remarked -- "Why, she wouldn't
need to be a poet -- with her personality she
could get on the stage and recite the A-B-C's and
make a sensation!"
