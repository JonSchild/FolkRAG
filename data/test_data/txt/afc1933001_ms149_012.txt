Dear Alan:

Your letter of September 8 and the record list were forwarded to
me from Sandy Spring as I left there on September 4.

When we last met, I understood that your father would probaly stop in 
Washington his return from Canada, and that you would let me know
when he arrived.   I had no address got him other Lake George, 
New York, and you had indicated that he was stopping there only a few
days so I have had no further correspondence with him.

I also expected to hear from you as to whether or not C.B.S.  had any
objection to your recording for another company. 

As to your father's proposal for recording a set of cowboy songs, it
now seems that Union has blocked any possibility of our doing this. 
As you know, we sent a recording expedition south to record both in
Atlanta and in Houston.       The national Uniona, in spite of the local
chapter giving its consent, stopped the recording of any but Union
member; consequently, our expedition did not go beyond Atlanta, and, 
of course, their recording program there was much requested. 

In the meantime if you can give me an answer to the first two questions
I would appreciate it very much.

I enjoyed very much my two visits with you and I do hope that we can
get something started this fall.       With best regards to your father and
Dr. Spivacke. 

                                                       Sincerely yours, 
                                                               R. P {lllifr}
