PIANO IN CHURCH
Yessir, I think we're entering into a new world. We're in it already--
jazz age. I came along at a time when the church people
thought it was a terrible sin to have music -- pinao in church, you
know, piano-- they thought that was the Devil. 
A: When did i t get to be the fashion to have a piano in the church?
H : In the Twentieth Century, after 1900, along around I think 1918. 
A: did people have fights over bringing pianos into the church? With
some of the older crew?
H : Yeah, big church fights when that idea became prevalent that they
anted a piano. Sometimes when it was brought about, a lot of people wu ld
quit the church because they thought the church was going into sin.
[T]they just didn't want any piano -- and it hasn't all together died 
out yet. I know of one theyput on a big church argument, worried
about pianos.
A: What would they say?
H: People would go North and come back with that idea. Well they
claimed that they was gett ng away from the old (                  ),
that they were trying to turn the church into a barrelhouse -- that's
what they called them then, they call em juke houses now, but then
they called em barrelhouses. 
A: What did the barrelhouse mean?
H: Well, that name originated from the whiskey barrel. They tho ght
that the people wanted to be wicked and do wrong and have whiskey, 
so they called that a barrelhouse. Yessir.
A: Do you remember any cases that ever happened on a levee-camp of
different events, fights, maybe killings, or anything like that that
ever hap ened?
