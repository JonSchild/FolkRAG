JOHN A. LOMAX ROUTE 4 BOX 341 FOREST HILLS DALLAS TEXAS

two weeks behind the walls at Huntsville, Texas. Later we made 
a second trip to the one big Central Convict Sugar Plantation
of Louisiana, located at Angola on the Mississippi River. Plans
for the remainder of the year will take us to the penitentiaries
of Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and, possibly,
Georgia and the Carolinas. All the farms we have visited are 
owned and operated by the states. The convict lease system
does not prevail.
Folk songs and Folk Literature flourish, grow-- are created,
propogated, transformed-- in the eddies of human society, particularly 
where there is isolation and homogeniety of thought
and experience. These communities of negro men and negro women,
shut out from the clamor of the world, thrown back almost entirely
on their own resources for entertainment, lonely, few with any
background of reading, naturally resort to song. The Negro
race is notably musical. Rhythm dominates his movements. A
bootblack makes his work go easier by playing a tune with his 
brushes. Groups of Negro laborers often have a chosen singer
to lead them in any concerted physical effort. Instances
occur where the leader does no labor, only sounding the rhythm
for his companions. All the managers of convict farms we have
visited except one encourages the laboring negro to sing as he
works, not only because singing keeps him more contented and 
happier but also because more work gets done. And through this
singing more songs are bred and old ones are polished and 
lengthened.
