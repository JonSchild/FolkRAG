Dear L. W.,

   There has been some delay in my writing up
the Rosenwald project which will include an application
for a years fellowship for your folklore work.
I shall ask for only $200 for office help since I
am afraid they would not be willing to spend more than
that on such an item. Perhaps when you make your own
application to them, you might personally put in for
more explaining the reasons.

   There is one point that I think we should both be 
clear about from the beginning, and the reason I am writing
you is that I want it clear. the records that you
make under the terms of the Library project must be deposited
in the Archive collection along with what portions
of your field notes you are able to work up, by
the end of the year. All of this material will be given
a publication restriction on request from you, and thereupon 
will not be used or, I suppose, even played by anyone 
without your express permission. If, within the collection
you make, there should chance to be three or four beautifully
sung or performed examples of American folk-songs, the 
Library might request your permission to publish this material 
in the course of its regular (I hope) release of records.

   I am going ahead with the preparations of the whole project,
but I would like a note from you signifying your willingness
to work with the Library on the terms outlined above.
Naturally I am delighted that it will be possible for
us to work collaboratively. Best of luck.
