to watch that.  I'd have give anything in the world to have
a picture of that, you know.  It's few people ever seen that
in my life.  And, and you know, they'd make a great big rat
bed, you know, yeah.  And, and them things was bringing
stuff here and that other one would meet it down on top.
The others never did haul nothing.  Them others, she'd meet
them you see and she'd catch it and she'd go place it, you
know.  And that old thing would jump up and down on it just
like a human.  Now I seen that.  That's the god's truth.
Them little things can work, yeah.  Yeah.

:       You figure that's how come they ain't,
they never [UNCLEAR] reproducing.
 
HARDIN      That's a, that's the reason them
little rats are jump, are working all the time.  Then
[UNCLEAR] jumps up on them beds, you see, and them muskrates
will go and build another bed, you know.  That's the reason
that I, muskrats never did repute. . . .

:       Reproduce.

HARDIN      Re, re, yeah.  Them damn [UNCLEAR]
stand on the bed, yeah.  I believe that.  Yeah. Because
them muskrats was working so much they didn't breed you see.
That's right.

:       Working so hard they ain't got time to
screw.
 
HARDIN      Well, it's the god's truth.  Yeah.
Yeah, they, they don't breed, you know.  They was working
too much.
