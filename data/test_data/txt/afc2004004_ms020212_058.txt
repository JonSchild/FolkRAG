Dear John and Bessie,
I am delighted to hear that you are going to go and work with Guy
on the Sea Islands.  I think that helping him there will be of
great usefulness to the group.  The most he could pay you all was
$150.00 plus your living expenses while you are there, and travel,
I believe.

The gentleman from Atlanta called me to other day and I agreed
with him that, since he cannot afford big fees yet, he would pay
the group $300.00, plus round-trip bus fare, plus five per cent
of the gross from the concert as something extra.  I think it
is important that you do this engagement even though the payment
in not what it was in California because it will help to get you
known in your own state.  He promised to send me contracts and
I will send them to you when I have looked at them.  I did not
feel it was proper for Bessie to go back there again on her own
when it was financially practical for the whole group to get
known to the Atlanta audience.

I talked to Ed Pearl on the phone and he cannot begin to arrange 
a tour for you until the people are back in school.

Bessie, please send me, if you have not already done so,
copies of all the clippings about the group, so that I can
think about making up a brochure to send around to get you dates.
 
I'll see you all in October in South Carolina.  Until then, all
my best.
Regards to everybody,
Alan Lomax
