Lomax: Whixh song do you know that's absolutely true, that
you're sure of?

Jean: They're all much the same to me. They all sounded the same
to me when I was little. All a story - and we was all ears, but
I was the only one that really did learn the songs.

Lomax: Why was that? Were you the youngest? Closest to your
mother?

Jean: I was the youngest child at that time. Being older, I don't
think they'd pay much attention. They maybe did learn bits of 
the songs.

Lomax: Where did your mother get the songs?

Jean: My mother picked up the songs off her older people, and 
they had really wandered about a lot, and they had picked up the 
likes of these.

Lomax: How do you mean wandered, Jeannie?

Jean: Travelled a lot in summer-time.

Lomax: In caravans?

Jean: Yes, and then always some old person that you heard singing
songs. I know when I was young I heard old people singing songs,
and I had a keen ear to pick them up. I wouldn't leave these
people alone till they sung it to me. Course, I could read and 
rwite, and some of them couldnae, and I used to write it down,
and sing it myself - get the air and then sing the song. That's
hoe I used to pick them up. Aye, if it was outside, ye hadna time
to pick them up. They may be only 24 hours beside ye. But most
of my songs came from my mother.

Lomax: Did she sing at the camp-fire at night, too, when other
people were listening? Or did she sing for you children in the
house?

Jean: My mother -- we'd always homes, you see, and my mother
often used to sit and sing to us at night to keep us in about;
sing and tell us stories. There was maybe three of four of the
people in, and you'd hear them tell stories, and sing the old
songs and one thing and another.

Lomax: Didn't some of these songs make you feel terribly sad?
