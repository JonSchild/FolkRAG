Writings of Mattie Dear

I first want to thank the Lord
Jesus that I am yet alive.  My
health is very good, only my feet
is very sore from walking so
much.  But I am not walking as
much as my Heavenly Father
did.  But yet is a wonderful blessing
to be on this side.
I was blessed with the opportunity
of being at my own church
Sunday.  Pleasant Valley M.B.
C., of Alligator pastored by Rev.
C.R. Raymond of Shelby.  Enjoyed
good service.  Prayers service
was conducted by the officers.
Rev. Raymond preached on
"Shall be like a tree."  He sure
explained that tree.  O, it was
sweet.  I do love good services.

Now about Alligator and her
surrounding.  Everything is very
quiet and we are having good
services.  But some of us is going
contrary to God's will.  It was my
aim to go to Clarksdale Saturday
on the train, but I got left.  But
Mrs. Lutissie Claborn say to me
on the street, "Mattie, don't you
want to go to Clarksdale?"  I says
to her "Yes Mam!"  Then she say
"Come go with me."  I thanked
her.  It was a fine thing to treat
everybody right.  But let me tell
you that the hand that rocks 
the cradle rules the world.  Believe
it or not.
Now let me tell you Jesus
watches, and He is Master of
this house.
I had a business trip Monday
to Clarksdale and I chance to go
to Mr. James Robinson's store
and got my beautiful chair he
given me.  O, it is so sweet of him.

IRVIN NEWS
By Lucy Ward
Dear readers, how are you enjoying 
this rainy day?  One thing
there is nothing that can be done
about it but be contented with
what comes.  and we will be more
better off than what we are.
Well, dear readers, how many
of you have started gardens?
Not I for one, but I want to
plant me something to eat in the
vegetable line, for I really like
that line you call the vegetable
line, don't you?
Readers, our beautiful Irvin
spot is doing just fine, in our
preparation for our this year's
crop. Our manager is really getting 
the farm business lined up
for another good crop.  We hope
it will be a good one again this
year, but any way each of you
just look forward to that end.
How about those good fresh
eggs? My hens are laying just
fine now since the strike is off,
and I am really proud of it, too.
I came home today and found
my husband with a bowl full of
eggs, all well beaten and filled
with clabber girl baking powder,
and you can imagine just how 
full his pan was.  When he put
them in the hot grease, he had
more than he could manage in
his pan.  But that was cooking,
too, and he ate it.  I don't know
how good it was.  He said he had
made a failure.  One thing I do 
know, he didn't offer me any of 
it.  And one good thing he did
not have those eggs to buy, and
I was proud of that, for he had
just a pan full of them.
