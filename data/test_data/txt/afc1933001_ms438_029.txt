"My dear, kind friend, mighty glad I met you,
I got something (to) tell you , don't let it fret you.
I saw your wife (and) another fellow,
(
They was down in de alley might(y) close togetho."

("He was talkn' to his friend to get him in trouble"..Lead Belly.)
"What they was doin' I couldn' see,
When they saw me , they broke an' run from me,
What they doin' , boy I couldn' tell,
But I know good an' well they was raisin' Hell."

. . . . . .

It was late last night when his made his around ,
He found his lady an' he blowed her down;
Then he went to bed ,
Put his pistol right under his head.

He couldn' lay down for dreamin' couldn' sleep for cryin' ,
The woman he murdered ,  keep worryin' his min';
Put on his shoes an' his overcoat,--
"This deed I done is a Hell of a note."

"It ain' no need of me hangin' aroun',
I better catch some train an' leave this town."
It was soon that mornin', jus' befo' day,
He went to de station to make his getaway.

He went to de depot , look upon de sign,
De train he rides was marked up on time;
He caught de train an' it run so slow,
De sheriff overtaken him in Jericho.
