beautiful down there, I'm tellin' ya, now.
TL:     Bessie, for these 5 years, did you live in your own house
or did you live in these houses that were everybody's house?
BJ:     I tol' ya, I had my own room.
TL:    Your own room?
BJ:     I lived, I lived [I lived]  in that, in, in that muck, in, in that
crowd, I guess, about 3 weeks, until I got me a room.  First time
I git me a room; I jus' foun' a place; I jus go on in it.  I
caught a room em-empty one, one night.  You know, where a crowd
had moved out of, an' found other places.  An' so there wasn't nobody
in that room.  An' so, an' I jus' wen' on an' got that room.
An' I was in that room when I met my husban'.   Ha, ha, ha.  I had
my own room.
TL:     This was in somebody else's house?
BJ:     Oh, hit, hit be in other people's [homes] hom-- houses.  'Cause they
furnish them ol' houses where you live in.  Tha's all.  You didn'
have to pay no rent.
TL:     Oh, you don't have to pay rent?
BJ:     No, hum-um.  Not for them houses, 'round Cannell (Canal)
Point, at that time.   Ya see.  But in Belle Glade, of co'se, they
had to pay rent, a little rent, ya know.   'Cause that's a town,
see.  It's a real -- it's a city, like.
TL:     But not out in the country in those great, big, ol' houses?
BJ:     Hum-um.
TL:     You didn't have to pay rent?
BJ:      Hum-um.
TL:     Well, how did you ever keep a room for yourself, with all
those people?
BJ:     I kept mine.  That's all.  Nobody lived with me.
