KEEP YOUR HANDS ON THE PLOUGH*
(A hymn of the Holiness Church)
(sung by the sect that believes in foot-washing.)
Got my hands on the gospel plough
Wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.
Chorus: 
Hold on, hold on;
Keep your hands on the plough,
Hold on.
Took Paul and Silas, put 'em in the jail,
Had no one to go their bail.
Paul and Silas, they begin to shout,
Jail doors open and they walked out.
Peter was so night and neat, 
Wouldn't let Jesus wash his feet.
Jesus said, "If I wash them not
You'll have no father in/this lot."
Peter got anxious and to Jesus said,
"Wash my feet and hands and head."
