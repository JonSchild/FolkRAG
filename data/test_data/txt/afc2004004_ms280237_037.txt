Last Saturday night, young Nancy lay sleepin',
Last Saturday night, young Nancy lay sleepin',
And into her bedroom young Johnny went a-creepin',
With his long fol the diddle ri do right down to his knee.

He said , "Lovely Nancy, may I come to bed to you?"
He said , "Lovely Nancy, may I come to bed to you?"
She smiled and [she] replied, "John, I'm afraid you'll undo me,
With your long fol the riddle di[d] do right down to your knee."

"My breeches fit tight, love, I cannot undo them,
My breeches fit tight, love, I cannot undo them."
She smiled and [she] replied, "John, you must take a knife to them,
With your long fol the riddle di do right down to your knee."

"My knife [it won't] will not cut, love, it ain't worth a cinder,
My knife [it won't] will not cut, love, it ain't worth a cinder."
She smiled and [she] replied, "John, there's two on the window,
With your long fol the riddle di do right down to your knee."

He picked up the knife an' I unlaced his breeches,
He picked up the knife an' he unlaced his breeches.
He unlaced his breeches an' into bed he tumbled
With his long fol the riddle di do right down to his knee.

Before daylight of the mornin' he crumpled Nancy's nightgown,
Before daylight of the mornin' he crumpled Nancy's nightgown,
Before daylight of the mornin' he crumpled Nancy's nightgown,
With his long fol the riddle di[d] do right down to his knee.

Now six...
Now nine months bein' past, it fell on a Sunday,
Now nine months bein' past, it fell on a Sunday.
A child it was born with a [mark] knife mark in the window
With a long fol the riddle di[d] do right down to his knee.

Lomax: What does a knife mark in the window mean?

Cox: Buggered if I know.

Lomax: Harry, what does it mean, pretuned?

Cox: Pretune? Get rid of.

Lomax: No.  But you said, "he performed and she pretuned".

Cox: Yes, well I suppose she [had to] er, gettin' herself rid o'
it.  That's how I'd put it.
