Dear Mrs. Oakdale:

The Archive of American Folk Song is planning to make
up a group of the best representative American folk
songs to be distributed in Latin America. Among the 
songs we hope to use is your performance of "O Chere
Fite Fille", which occupies less than 1/3 of a 12" 
record.  We will pay you for the use of this record 
$4.00 and send you two copies of it for your own use.

I hope you will give us your permission to use this
song by signing and returning the enclosed form as
soon as possible. All the records will carry the
legend, "For non-commercial use only" and of course
your name will appear on every record.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
