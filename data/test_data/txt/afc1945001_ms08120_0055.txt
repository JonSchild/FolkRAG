K. P. Duty

There were two fellows in the army
that looked alike, but still they weren't
related. They had to take turns
taking K. P. Duty. This one time
it was the other fellows turn
to go on K. P. Duty, because the other
had jsut finished his. This one
couldn't be found, and the sergent
was waiting ansiously and came
a took the same one by mistake
and he had to do the dishes [?]
So never [try] have some one look
like you in the Army.
