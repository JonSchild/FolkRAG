Rumors

The OWI rumor platform has undergone another change since I
last memoed you about it. Details will not be forthcoming until Monday
or Tuesday, after Rosten's return from Boston. In the meantime, however, 
Rosten has passed the word around to OWI that all rumor communications 
are to be sent to the Bureau of Intelligence and, in addition, has
asked me to advise Miss Harriett Root, of the Bureau of Operations,
Tempo "V" to send to us here all rumor communications directed to her
from the public.
