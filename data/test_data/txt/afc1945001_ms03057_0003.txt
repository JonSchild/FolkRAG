Gentlemen:
I had, repeated to me, a rumor heard in 
Huntington, West Virginia on August 3rd. The 
report was being circulated around that area that 
colored soldiers were being sent into battle first. [*5-1*] 
The person who repeated this rumor to me 
said that she heard it several times in 
Huntington. 

Very truly yours,
