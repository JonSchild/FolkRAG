should and I know his way has cost us all very much in financial ways as well as others. He was so distressed that you did not stay longer when you were here last and asked me time after time whether you had failed to enjoy yourself and why. So I tried to explain you to him and not I try to go the other way around and probably you think I am a mutt with my ravings. But I do know that Chris enjoys all my family and that he has a deep respect for you, a high regard for your intelligence and enjoys thoroughly being with you. And if you will accept my word for it htat is so. 

We are still searching for a house we can make a deal on that we can afford and one of the main reasons is to let there be a place where you will be comfortable while you are here. The general hulabaloo does not worry me in the leat but I know I do not make you comfortable and so I can't help worrying. I will let you know when we make progress.

Well it's too hot to do more. I will stop and let you rest too.

Love to you both,

Father spent a week with me and the effect on him was salutary. We went to Port A., Kerrville, + Austin. Being President of Texas Folk Lore Society seems to give him a new lease on life and interest in old friends etc. I'm about to settle in Austin. Trust I'm not poison ivy on a/c of this paragon stuff.         -Joham-
