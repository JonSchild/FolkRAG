Dear Duncan,

Would you be kind enough to write me a page of notes about
the folklore activity in the Library of Congress for 1946... I'm doing a
survey for the Book of Knowledge Annual about folklore in 1946 in the
United States and I don't want to leave out of this any thing
important about the Archive. Might include a copy of the latest
catalogues, because I'm going to review the entire set of the Library
Records, past and present... Also how about one of the pictures from
the Korson trip, showing a recording machine in action, etc., Is that
possible. The photographer will get credit, etc. But I need the facts
from you... The information can be very brief, but I do have a deadline
and would like to hear from you right away...

I haven't sold my book yet the way I want to sell it. Scribners
turned the idea down, probably because I didn't have time to see your
friend myself. However, it was durn nice of you to put in a plug for me.
Why don't you ever call me up when you're in town.... I can be reached here
at Decca during the day....

Yours,
Alan

By the way if you have any clips on folk festivals, etc., I'd like to borrow
them for a couple of weeks for this article.
