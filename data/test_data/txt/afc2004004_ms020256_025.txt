She couldn't cure 'er!  She told Charlie what to do.  That one
good thing about her: If she can't do ya sumpin' an' she,
if, in her power -- whenever she go through with it; when she go in
that room an' come out -- she tell ya where to go.  Ya know?
"Ya go to                              ."  Ya know?  "Ya go to sech-an'-
sech a one." She know 'em, I guess: she must know 'em.  She tol'
t' go ta the seven sisters -- I mean the five sisters in Columbius,
Georgia.  An' that where he went.
     So that's why I jus' see her, an' know her as well as I did,
an' ta see them white folks out there!  Car parked 'way down
the other side (a that road ?) an' walk up there.  An' that's
them white people; that's them peoples I know there.  I sings for
em'. I'm tellin' you, I, I know 'em!
That's their business.  Ya see what I mean? If they can he'p
theyse'f, he'p yase'f.  We don't know what they got to to through
with.  Nobody knows nobody.  What all, ah, ah, obstitches
(obstacles) that ya have to go through with.  An' how, sometime, 
it is, ta git over, the way you got to git over.  They some of
'em here now.  MacNorra.

BJ: Jus' MacNorra.  That's the one here now.  (Bigger than
that ?) Them white people got plen'y of chillun.
They look white; they are white.
AL: But this was kind of unusual it happened [right] down 
there in...
BJ:  It did; it happened right in Millen.  That's right.
AL: Tell me about [it] the MacNorras.
BJ: Ah, he, he mighta had hisself fixed when he got killed.
But, ah, anyhow, he was goin' with this colored woman, Miss Melissa.
