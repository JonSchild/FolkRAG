March 19, 1938.

The Library of Congress,
Attention: Dr. Spivacke,
Mr. Alan Lomax.

Gentlemen:

Herewith, in rough draft form the narrative which I spoke
of when I saw you recently, and dealing with the activities of the
Folk Song Archive. It is, obviously, one which will have to be smoothed
out, somewhat, as to form, etc. But, it has been put together hurriedly.

I would much appreciate constructive criticism of the same,
and any pertinent suggestions, as I am very conscious of my limitations
when it comes to handling this subject.

Originally, I included numerous names of persons, such as
Mrs. Dusenburry, Mesdames Chandler, Tartt, and so on. These I have
deleted. I have retained the reference to Mrs. Wilson, and wondering
whether that also might be cut out. For, it might be, it
strikes me, these ladies might not care to have their names used so
publicly, as in a possible running of this material in some publication
of a different character from the Library's reports.

Your suggestions here, would be welcomed. Again, as to "the
Gant family." Should the name be used? The personal reference to Mr.
and Mrs. Alan Lomax, in closing grew out of the information from Mr. Lomax.
I do not mean to presume and, of course, this should be deleted, if
that be his wish.

One more request: As to refernces such as: "Natural parent
of "swing,'" and the like. Would this one technically correct? Aside
from the play on words.

Yours very sincerely,
Lee L. Robinson
