Dear Mrs. Landon:
It is a great pleasure to receive letters like yours
in which games and songs are so clearly discussed. I am
certain that you must know a great deal of material and I
hope you will jot it down and send it to me at the Library
of Congress to be incorporated in our National Archive
of American Folk Song. You cannot imagine how valuable and
interesting such material can be until you see it.
Again thanking you,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
