My dear Mrs. Peckenpaugh:

Your grandfather, Reverend W.L. Harris, must have been my pastor
when I was a boy in Bosque County, Texas. He and his family lived in
Iredell in Bosque County. I knew the entire family well, including his
very old father, Reverend Jesse Harris. The boys and I used to go
swimming together. I recall Marshall, who was somewhere about my age,
and the oldest son, who afterwards became a Methodist minister. I
believe he was named for his father. Reverend Levi Harris had a powerful
voice when he would let it go on some of the Methodist revival tunes
so common in those days. I have often wished that I could get a list
of his favorite songs - I mean the songs that he sang, the words of which
were not included in any published book.

The story that you tell of the origin of "Rounded up in glory"
is of extreme interest. I picked up the words as published in my book
somewhere, and a few years ago, Mr. Oscar J. Fox, of San Antonio, set
the words to music for solo singing and also for group singing. The
song is published in sheet music form and can be obtained in the two
forms from Carl Fischer, Music Publishers, Cooper Square, New York
City. Any music dealer in Corpus Christi could order copies for you.

I shall include your story of the origin of this song in any future
publication of it and shall also leave a copy on file in the Library of
Congress. I am wondering if you sent me all of the old cattleman's
prayer. It seems very short. I'd be glad to have any additions whatever.

Thanking you for your letter, I am

Sincerely yours,

P.S. The only words that I have hitherto known to "Rounded up in
glory" are printed in "Cowboy songs and other frontier ballads", which
I think you should find in your public library.
