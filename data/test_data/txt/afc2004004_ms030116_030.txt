Rev. Davis II -- Reel 2
Rev. D:  Noooooo!  I never takes time to prepare no sermon.  I jist git
the Bible an read it an put it up.  Then God give me whatever He would
have me to have out of it.  I never think nothin of a man settin down
an preparin a sermon.  He's takin God's job out of his hands.
Eliz:  Of course, a great many ministers sit down and write their sermons
out.
Rev. D:  Well I'll tell you right now what they're doin.  They ain't doin
a thang but tryin to ignore God.  Thass right.
Eliz:  Do you feel that God will inspire you and fill you with that
you should say.
Rev. D:  I know He will.  If you give Him a right-of-way with you I
know he will.  I won't say I feel it.  I not only feel it I know he will.
He always has.  Never has failed me. Lots of times I stood before a
congregation I didn't a bit mo know what I was going to say than this
git-tar here.  Fore the time come fur me to stand God give me a 
message.
Mrs. D:  That's true.
Rev. D:  [Don't do no good to prepare anything to put befo the public.
If you prepare a sermon God don't want you to.]  It's nothin to nobody 
preparin no sermon.  You prepare anything God don't want you to put befo
the public He'll take it away from you before you can git it together.
They call that a self-made preacher.  You can tell em all that I said
so.
Eliz:  I think you're right about it, Rev. Davis.
Rev. Davis:  I know I'm right.  Now heah where they git the ground at:
Paul said, "Study an show yoursef a proof of a minister that
workmen (?) need not be ashamed divinin the word of God as truth. (?)
This heah thing bout studyin:  Study in the way to push God forward.
