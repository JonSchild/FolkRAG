Kansas City, August 3 ---- This talk the British
are putting out about a second front in Europe is a lot
of propaganda. They are just trying to pacify the Russians
and keep them fighting. British leaders know they
are not ready for for a second front and won't be for 
months to come. They have no real intention of trying 
now. Why, they can't even hold Rommel in North Africa,
let alone start another front now.         [*11*]
