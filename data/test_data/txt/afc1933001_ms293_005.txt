ALAN LOMAX
brings you the folk songs of America

FOR the last seven years Alan Lomax has been listening to the the folk songs of a young
nation. Instead of a notebook he carries a recording machine and in his travels he has
captured the voices of the American people. Together with this apparatus he has visited the
penitentiaries of the South; he has journeyed over the rough mountain rods of Eastern
Kentucky, explored New England farms and Michigan lumber camps, recorded voodoo ceremonies,
listened to songs on the sponge docks of Nassau. All of these records have been added to the splendid collection that was started at the Library of Congress by his famous
father...between the two they have gathered something like 10,000 songs.

His interest in the music that is indigenous to America goes back further than twenty-five
year old Alan Lomax can remember. Before he was born, John A. Lomax, his father, had
already had published his book of famous "Cowboy Songs" and had lectured and gathered
folk-songs throughout the country. Being brought up in an environment such as this, he could
not resist its fascination.

Fresh from the study of philosophy at the University of Texas in 1933, he joined his father on a tour of Southern prisons. Since then he has had time for little else but folk music. His
activities have included collaboration in three books with his father, "American Ballads and
Folk Songs," "Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Lead Belly," "Our Singing Country." He has
lectured at Universities and Union Halls and has edited an album of folk records. Last year he
won great acclaim for his programs on "Columbia's School of the Air"...the first serious
program of folk music ever attempted on radio. He wrote, conducted and sang on the series.
One of these has won the award for the best educational program in the field of music for
last year. For three years he has managed, single-handed, the Archive of American Folk Music in the Library of Congress.

His approach to music is social. He is interested first in the people and then in their problems.
From their songs he gathers material that he considers "a part of human life." Folk
music is created through struggle...the struggle for freedom, the struggle for opportunity,
the struggle for food. It is in sections of the country where strife and hardship are an everyday
feature that Lomax goes to find his tunes. He has heard and recorded the life stories of housewives,
jazz musicians, Negro convicts, lake sailors, mountain midwives and many other
strange and original people whose lives are the stuff of which folk music is made...and it
is a great folk music...as great as that of China or Russia.

He has heard the stories, he has learned the songs. With his records and his guitar he
brings his listeners closer to America, the real America...close to the singing country that
he believes America to be.
