Dear Mr. Lomax,
The University of Chicago Folklore Society is currently
planning its fifth annual folk festival.  We had hoped to
present Vera Hall, and introduce her music to the audiences
of the "Urban Revival."  We were sincerely grieved to hear
of her death.  You, who knew her personally, undoubtedly
felt it far more deeply than any of us who knew her only 
from the magnificent artistry of her recordings.I 
can sincerely say that no artist has ever moved me
more deeply nor revealed such great beauty.  We would
still like to present something resembling her
style of music at the festival, since this 
"old-fashioned," one might almost say classical aspect of
Negro music is little heard today, drowned out on
concert stages and phonograph turntables by the louder and
more flamboyant virtues of the Blues and the Gospel sounds.
We feel that you, in your great experience in the field
and in scholarship are the person most likely to be able
to recommend to us a singer who can, in his or her own way
and with id or her own personality, fill the great gap
left by Vera Hall, and take the place with which we
had hoped she would have honored us at our festival.
We would greatly appreciate your help.  Thanks. 
Sincerely and Respectfully
