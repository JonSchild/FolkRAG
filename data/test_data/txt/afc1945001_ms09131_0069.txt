War like learning is one which should
be considered with greatest care. A war is
one of destruction and suffering among people
but also brings to our minds the fact that we
learn as a result what was done wrong.
This some people do not take into consideration. Only
one thought prevails, that of winning which determ
whetr on not a country remains free or furth
destruction.
Moral, one of the greatest essentials for
keeping people in high spirit during any crisis
is one which is greatly hampered through the
work of fifth-column activity and through
great menace propaganda.
