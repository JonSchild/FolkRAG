My mama, she told me, and my
daddy told me, too.
They's some of these women gonna be
the death of you

My mama, she dead, and my
daddy give me away
That's the cause I'm a strollin' 
chile today
Slidin' Delta Blues, an ol' 
song a fellow made it up
years ago.  Fellow come from
the hills to the Delta playin'
this. Jap Lay . Thirty years
ago.  He's dead now.
