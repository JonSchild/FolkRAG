Dear Lomax:

I have been hearing that you have, since
graduation, been making a number of very fine
studies and recordings of songs and folk lore in
such widely-scattered parts as Texas and Haiti.

Right now, I have been doing some work on
Haitian mysticism, Voodoo and Obeah. I am antici-
pating a trip to Port-au-Prince and the Haitian
hinterland some time next spring. I have been work-
ing with Father Williams, the late celebrated anthro-
pologist and expert on Jamaica and Haiti. In visiting
Haiti, it is my purpose to seek out as much of the
truth as it is possible to find in actual field trips
on the Voodoo ceremonies, dances and songs, as well
as the secret rituals. No authentic, comprehensive
study of this has been made. Father Williams' works
treat more with the psychic phenomena of Haiti. Of
course, we are all familiar with the mental aberra-
tions of William Seabrook in his "Magic Island."

I would be much in your debt if you are
able to assist me in any way in the above, as I
understand you, yourself, have been to Haiti, and
possibly may have some additional contacts to mine
there. I should also be pleased to hear any record-
ings of Haitian music that you may have made in field
trips. I get down to Washington now and then, and
could arrange to stop in. Anything that you can do
will be of great help.

Sincerely yours,
Thomas Perkins III, '34
