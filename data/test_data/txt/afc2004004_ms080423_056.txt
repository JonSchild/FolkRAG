of the Shelton family and her name is Wilma.   The lady standing next
to her, she come out of sling shot China (?) a long long time ago.
Her little eyes used to turn up on the sides and we got 'em straightened 
out and we fed her a lot of gramhock's (?) grease.   And that straightened
her eyes out real good.   Her name is Linda.   She is the youngest daughter
of the family.   And this lady standing next to me, if it a hadn't been
for her they wouldn't have been no Shelton family.   And I'm declaring
to you, they say they're from Flagpond (?),  really they're not, they're
from Devil's Fork.   We're going to have to change the name of where
we're from, because an old man over there told me that the devil
wouldn't have that fork, so we're going to have to change that.

You may not think that is her her hair, but really, it is.  Ain't
it Linda?   We went to K Mart with her and she bought it. That's
her hair.   Her name is May-donna, the mother of the Shelton family.
This young man over here, bless his hear, his face look like. . .
(unclear). . .it got three bodies, don't it?   It really does.   But
he's a good bass player, he really is.   He hails from the great city
of Morris Hills, up on Bruce Branch (?)--or Bruce Creek?   Well,
Bruce Branch and Bruce Creek are the same thing.   (SECTION ENDS)
