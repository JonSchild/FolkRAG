2
ordinary horse sense and put
aside something for a rainy
day, after you have paid
what you owe.  To me freedom
and independence are
two of the finest things that
life can bring to one under
any system of government
You can't have either with strings
of bill collectors on your trail, or
the consciousness of 
broken promises to pay nagging
at your conscience
   We do not even know where
Bess is.

Lovingly,
Father
