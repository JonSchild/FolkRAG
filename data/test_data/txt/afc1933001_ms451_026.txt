They put a black bonnet above his head,
They put a rope right in his neck,
They put handcuffs on his hands
Balls and chains on his foot.

The people begin to cry,
"Umm-mm-mm,
Um-mmmm-mmmm,
Poor Batson he is dead and gone."

The clear blood run out of his eyes,
Nobody they couldn't see his face,
Had a tongue stuck out of his mouth
Six inches long.

A rubber-tired buggy,
Decorated horse,
You know they brought Batson to the grave-yard
Says, they brought his family back.

His wife walked up to the grave,
Fell down on her kness,
Says, "Lord, have mercy,"
Says, "Batson, are you gone?"

Batson's wife began to pray,
Pray as hard as he could
Prayed so much until it looked like
The Lord done answered her prayer.

I thought I heard somebody say
A while before she left,
Says, "You're goin' leave me,
But I'll meet you some lonesome day."

Batson's little girl cry
Batson's little child cry,
That's all he asked them people,
"Take keer of them two little girls."

Um-mmm,
Um-mmm-mmm
Um-mmm,
The tears run out of his eyes.

Think I heared somebody say,
Bye-bye, Batson, bye-bye,
Bye-bye, Batson, bye-bye,
And I believe he's dead and gone.
