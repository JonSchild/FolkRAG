father of said Alan, for all your modesty
in claiming him for your own.

Mrs. Edgar Witt has been
kind enough to offer her home for
a gathering of people particularly
interested in folk music after
Alan's appearance. As I told
Dr. Armstrong only today of this,
detailed plans have yet to be
made and of course such will
of necessity center around Alan's
plans. Dr. Armstrong is writing
Mr. Henry Edwin Meyer, Georgetown,
Texas who as you know
has made over 200 arrangements
of old folk tunes - has published
some and is readying others for
the press. We hope that a group
from Southwestern University will
come with him. If he doesn't
get to come, I really do think it
would be worth Alan's time to
stop by to see him. If that is possible,
have him write Mrs. Meyer.
I presented him before a group
here in January and his program -
music and lecture - was well
received.
