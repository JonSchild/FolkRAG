Gentlemen:-

About 6 weeks ago your Mr. Lomax recorded for you two songs by the colored female inmates of this prison. We are very desirous of obtaining a copy of this record if available, and the inmates will very much appreciate your sending us same.

These songs were sung by Jessie Mae Shelton, Lillain Nickson, Corenne Hill, Linnie Holt, and Lubertha Youngblood, and the songs were "When it Rained" and "Straightenum".

Thanking you for your consideration, I am,

Yours very truly,

J. E. Brock

J. E. Brock, Warden
