Mr. John A. Lomax
University Station
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

                   Enclosed is the Letter of intro-
duction which you hope will get you
into prisons.  I hope that it will      
also get you out of them.
               The small size records have been 
orders and should reach you very
soon.  


                                             Sincerely, 



                                                         Harold Spivacke
                                                           Chief,  Division, of Music
