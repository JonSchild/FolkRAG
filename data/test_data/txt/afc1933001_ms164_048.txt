Dear Bill:

          In case you're worried, I am worried too!
          Here it is Monday morning and no script for next weeks 
program, and I don't have an idea in atleast three hundred
miles. I'm completely empty of ideas. However, I'll go home
and commune with nature and try to think of something. What I
think of now is to have Burl Ives again.

          The French-Canadian program again concerns me. Barbeau
recommends: 1.  Phileas Bedard, 73 years old, from country near 
Montreal for a fee and expenses, speaks no English, a very great
folk songer. 2.   Madame Bolduc, Montreal, who is too fat to travel.
I've heard her records and she's very fine. I still think you'd
better send me to Montreal if you want a good program and send me
to arrive, Thursday 19th. The problem of importing singers from
Canada, according to Barbeau, are extensive, involved, the problem
of American money in advance, passports, and the possibility of all
kinds of misunderstandings. There are very good folk singers in the 
neighborhood of Montreal and Ottawa and even though I am foot sore
and somewhat weary of soul, I think we'd better go there and do the
broadcast. Will write you again Tuesday or Wednesday, and, [I]in the
meantime, I'd like to see whatever mail there be.

                                                                    Sincerely,
                                
                     
                                                                     Alan
