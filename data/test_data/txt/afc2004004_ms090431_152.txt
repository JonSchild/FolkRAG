words for Pullin the Skiff, given by little girls at 
Friars Point. Given by Mgt Wormley, as
the children wouldn't sing these lines for me.

My mama, my mama
Didn't wear no drawers
I saw her pull them off
She washed them in alcohol
Then she hung them up side the wall
They stink like alcohol
She gave them to Santa Claus
He said, "Uh-uh, I didn't want these funky drawers."
Aunt Lucy said, "Sho is good and juicy."
Uncle Ben said, "Sho is hairy."
