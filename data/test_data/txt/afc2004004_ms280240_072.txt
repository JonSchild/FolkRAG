was a tearing time.  That's when they got their wages - their
money.  That day was called the tearing day.  Well, they had a dance
that day.  A ball -- and he would way, "Well, what about going to
the dance tonight?"  And he would take her home.  He'd say, "I'll 
take you home, I'll see you home.  "So when they were going home.
that's the way they'd go.

Lomax:  Then he'd ask if he could come up that night, come up
the ladder?

McBeth:  He'd say that, yes!  "You'd better watch," she says.  Throw
a stone, Throw a stone.  I'll know that you're here.  Get a ladder
and climb up to the top of the window."  Sleep in the farmhouse ---
the same house oas the farmer.

Lomax:  How would you get the ladder down?  Would he have
someone out there to take the ladder away for him?

McBeth:  To take it away.  There was always a garden there.  Apple
trees or something, and about a quarter to twelve, go up at
that time.  See, the servant girl got a knock from the foreman.
That's the man who carted the first pair of horse.  He'd give a
kick at the door - say  "Get Up!" - that was to make their food and
everything.  They got their breakfast at half past five at that time.
And he'd let her out the kitchen door to the barn door.

Lomax:  Did that ever happen to you, Jimmy?

McBeth:  It did happen one time, but I'd never do it again.

Lomax:  Why not?

McBeth:  Because I got a bit nervous.  I got a bit afraid.  that
I'd get catched.  I'd do it too often.  and get catched.
There'd come a night that I would get catched if I wasna careful.

Lomax:  Is there a song about anything like that?  An adventure
with a farm girl from the bothy?

McBeth:  Well - Bogie's Bonny Bell.  I'll have a go at that.

1)  It's a ploughman I engaged to work for meat and fee,
     It was near Boghead o' Kearney - it was there I did agree.
2)  Now Bogie had a daughter, her name was Isabel,
     She's the primrose of this native land, and none could her excel.
3)   One night as for a ramble, she choosed me for her guide,
      To watch the small fish swimming in Kearney's Burnie side.
