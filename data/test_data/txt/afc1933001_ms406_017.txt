1932

1

     During the late Spring of 1932, at the nadir of the general
financial collapse my fortunes reached their lowest ebb since the day
I left college. At these two periods of my life I was in each case
worth less than nothing. I was heavily in debt, I ha no job when I 
graduated from college. I did possess youth and health, while in
1932 I was barely recovering from an exhausting illness. Moreover my
children, Alan and Bess Brown were yet dependents.
     I had reached New York City on a long lecture trip with John, Jr. 
as the driver of my Ford car. We camped by the roadside and did our 
own cooking. My lecture fee reached a low limit of $5.85 for a 
single engagement. Cowboy songs had gone almost into a total eclipse.
     One morning I drifted into the offices of Macmillons at Sixty
Fifth Avenue, Mr. E. H. Lotham, a big hearty, wholesome man, whom I
knew slightly, received me with gracious courtesy. I told him timidly
that for years I had hoped to edit a collection of American folk songs
but that until at that time I had never had the leisure to round out
a collection that had been growing steadily for more than twenty years.
Mr. Lotham had told me more than once of his fondness for the crude
output of the cowboys contained in my two books of Cowboy Songs
published by the Macmillons. Both these books had had a study if
slow sale for several years. I watched Mr. Latham's face as I 
unfolded my story I was desperate and I think he realized it.
     "I like your plans," Mr. Latham said, "but we cannot tell in
advance how we will like the book you will submit. Have you any
sample song?" I was ready for just that question. "I can't sing 
them," I said eagerly, "but let me read you these."
