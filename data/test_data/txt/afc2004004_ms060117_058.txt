Dear Alan, 

The Albany show has been heard here and much liked, but
we feel that it is wrong for BBC in its present form. While it
is to be judged, obviously, as programme - at the same time the
listener over here cannot bring to it the sort of background
knowledge which the American audience possessed. Laurence
thinks it would break down well into a 30 to 40 minute show
provided that it was broken up, a commentary added by you, and
a certain amount of tidying up done here on the editing.
If you can manage to do this for us - I think we can certainly
place it. I could airmail the take to you from London and you
could break it up and record the commentary for us wherever you
are. The final joining and editing could be done at this end
on your recommendations.

Would you let me know what you think about this idea?

All the best,
Yours
[Geoffrey?]
