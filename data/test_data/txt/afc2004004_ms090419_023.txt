[*What the old folks say - the old black bear 
considered the ugliest one of the animals.*]

Once when the animals were having a convention and
they run out of water, the rabbit got up and said, [â€œThe ugliest]
"I motion the ugliest man in the house get up and get some
water."..The bear jumped up and grabbed a chair, say, "I come
here for a meeting, I didn't come for foolishness."

Once I went visiting my grandaddy and the mosquitoes
were plenty bad down there. I tied the cow out in the pasture and
that evening when I went back down there after her, the mosquitoes
had et the cow up and were sitting there on the stump, ringing the
bell for the calf.

 You know I used to go out rabbit huntin a lot and
I never did [carry] have over two shells. I got to get me a rabbit because 
I was hungry and ain't got but two shells now. If I shoot
at the rabbit and miss it, I lay my gun down and run up side
of him and feel [if] his hips, see if he fat. If he wasn't fat,
I'd let him go and [go] catch [me] a fat one.

One time the dogs and the rabbits had a convention and they decided
not to run the rabbits. So two rabbits standing up in the road
one day--they was talking over the business probably they'd been
doing--so one rabbit looked way down the road and he seen a poor
old dog coming. He say, "Look here, ain't that's a dog comin
yonder?"
[*End Mistrust*]
Other rabbit say, "Well, sir, don't be figgety.
We was all in convention. He's not gonna bother us."
"Yeah," he say, "But, brother that [poor] son-of-a-bitch
liable not to been in that convention!"
