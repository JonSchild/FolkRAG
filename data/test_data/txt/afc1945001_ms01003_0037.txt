Dear Colonel Dickinson:

Thanks for sending the note from
Mr. Palmer. I have passed it on to our Intelligence
Division.

By the way, the consensus of opinion
around here is that the Service Flag and Emblem be taken
care of by private enterprise and that the less done about
it officially the better. I take it this is your opinion
too.

Very truly yours,

Thomas Mabry
Asst. Chief, Graphics Division

Lt. Col. C. Roy Dickinson
Selective Service System
21st & C Sts., N. W.
Washington, D. C.
