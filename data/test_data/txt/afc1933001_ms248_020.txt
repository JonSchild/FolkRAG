This cuts out New Mexico and is
about 500 miles shorter than
the car trip I proposed. I think
I can get local friends to drive me
to all necessary places.

We went to a square dance
place the other night and, despite
a jittery floor, got two fine
dance records with gorgeous
calls and hollers. I have heard
nothing on the radio or by
Victor and Columbia that
compare with them.

I'm off tomorrow
for a week with Johnny
and Shirley.
As always,
Father
