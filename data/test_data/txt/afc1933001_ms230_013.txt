Dear Alan:

I saw Frank Dobie last
week. He is [Pearitory?] and I am 
now President of the Texas Folk Lore
Society. We want you to come
to San Antonio next spring - date
to suit you - to talk before the
annual meeting of the Society
about Negro [?] songs; also
to sing some of 'em, if possible -
that you have found in
Texas. If you can stay over for 
a few dates, I'll arrange for
you to be paid at the University,
the A.& M. College, S.M.U., T.C.U.,
etc. You can save time by flying
down and back.
