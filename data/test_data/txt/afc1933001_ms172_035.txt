MEMORANDUM
FROM
     Archive Amer. Folksong     DIVISION
TO THE CHIEF OF THE 
     Music     DIVISION

July 22, 1941

     I forward to you herewith the Broadside Collection of Mr. Sam
Henry, of Londonderry, Ireland, which he has been kind enough to
gather together for the Archive collection. In the accompanying
letters he states that in assembling this collection he has 
spent $20.00 for typing services and I recommend that he be reimbursed
for this. Naturally you will send him an official letter
of acknowledgement.
     I suggest further, that the songs be bound in about three
volumes and shelved in the Archive, because the material will be 
of constant use in reference work on our large collection of 
Irish ballads in American song.
