Young Una, you were a rose in the garden
You were a gold candlestick on the queen's table
You were talk & music. wandering this road 
before me
My grief on a sad morning that it was not I who
married you.

Una, girl, friend, golden tooth.
Honeyed little mouth that never told falsehood
I had rather be in bed with heaping kisses on you 
Than sitting in Heaven on the throne of the trinity

Gentle Una, it was you who disturbed my mind
Una, it was you who went between me and God
Una, scented bough, girl of the twisted hair
Better had I been without eyes than even to 
have seen you.

He is later celebrated in a poem written
by Hugh O'Rourke's wife who fell
much in love with him
