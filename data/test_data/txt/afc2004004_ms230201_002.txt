Old Natchez:   (speaking in his quiet, slow and sombre way)
                       One reason that I started playin' the blues
                        was from feelin' bad..lack of money,.an',fact
                        of the business, I couldn't find a job at that
                        time on the planation to make no extra money.
                        Course, some people say that the blues is [a] ---
                        cow want to see her calf; but I don't say it
                        like that.  I say it's a man that's got a good 
                        woman that turn him down.  Things like that happen,
                        you know. [--] I want to see my baby, want to see
                        her bad and, somepin happen, I can't find her---
                        an' that givesme the blues...
                        (Turning with a smile to Sib, the Stutterer, the
                        slightly addled one with the eternal clownish
                        grin on his face, Old Natchez says, gravely---)
                        So what so you think about it, Sib? you must
                        have some reason why you have the blues.
Sib:                  Well, I tell you, Natchez, it really worries
                         me to think I used to have a sweet little girl,
                         name Estelle. An', you know we used to go to
[school]         school together and grew along up together. So
                         I wanted to love her and I axed her mother for her an',
                         well, she turned me down, and that caused me to 
                         sing the blues.  I couldn't get her and that's the 
                         reason I thought of the blues...
