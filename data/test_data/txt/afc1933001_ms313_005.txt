Designs need not be ostentatious, but ill be the finest that 
contemporary culture can produce, and will be a further explanation
of the place of rural people in modern society and their
integration with urban life.

FUNCTION
The building will function as a common meeting ground for all
people. The purpose is primarily to counteract social maladjustment,
and to place the community on "speaking terms." Additionally,
it will be instrumental in injecting "new ideas"
-- i.e., news of the existence of a world outside at the free
will of the community.
     It is assumed that in all cases the building will function 
as grade school during the daytime. Although the building has
been established for purposes beyond the grade school, it is 
equipped with classrooms and services to maintain same. It
is, therefore, obvious that the school boards will make every 
effort to participate.
     Thus the issue of consolidation of inadequate one-and-two
room schools may be solved without becoming enmeshed in local
political issues and county tax problems.
     The building also will serve as local office for some of
the following activities of the Department of Agriculture:
Soil Conservation Service, Forest Service, Farmers Home Coporation,
Resettlement Administration, AAA, Farm Credit Administration,
Extension Service, and Bureau of Home Economics.
These services thus will be drawn experimentally into the
mechanisms of community life.
