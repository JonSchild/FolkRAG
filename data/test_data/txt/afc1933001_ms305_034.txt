        War hysteria is being worked
up. And the jingoes will try hard to 
break the cultural front of democ-
racy in America. 
        This is nothing new. In 1900 an
American sculptor declared that "we 
can and must produce an art second
to no other." Big industrialists were
calling for a navy second to none. 
Both demands were voiced in the 
same spirit.
        The sculptor, William Ordway
Partridge, has just finished working
on a monument to Dewey's naval 
victory at Manila. he claimed that
artistic "inspiration sprang from the 
intense patriotism of the people."
But the people, who had generously 
supported the Cuban struggle for in-
dependence, only to be bitterly dis-
illusioned when American armed
forces were turned against the Fili-
pinos, did not recognize the face of 
democracy in the this monument to im-
perialism. They failed to respond to 
the subscription campaign for replac-
ing the temporary plaster model of
the triumphal arch, set up to cele-
brate Dewey's homecoming, with a
permanent marble arch. Six months
after its erection, the arch was carted
away from its place on Fifth Avenue
to New York City's dump heap. 
        In those turbulent years the vital 
new forces in American art rose with
the democratic upsurge of the people
against their enemies at home, vari-
ously described as "the trusts", "the
interests" and "the invisible govern-
ment" who grounded down the masses
and pushed them into wars of con-
quest against other peoples.
