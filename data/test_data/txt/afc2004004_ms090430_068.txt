Four Oaks seven teachers were North Carolinians and one was from Washington,
D.C. The significance of this nativity statement is that a large percentage
of the teachers are not indigenous to the local community. Few live in the
communities in which they teach except in Selma and Smithfield. The consolidation
of schools has removed an institution from many small scattered communities
and concentrated them where they have little relation to the patrons.
As schools they have been formalized and improved according to the best educational
standards, but as local institutions they have less of a functioning
relationship to the local communities.
