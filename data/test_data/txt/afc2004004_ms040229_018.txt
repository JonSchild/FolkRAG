p.37-8- the [expert drums of the
Little Sister ?] song of Alan McDonald's
and Flora McNeil's.  Very good tune to
use for lament of mothers in eviction

p.83 She had been in the fairy 
mound for a day & a year as she thought 
heavily, but in that time a
sapling oak had grown up
& decayed.  And now she wandered
by the port of the Corrie her old 
landmark looking for the clachan
where her people lived and the cattle
that they had reared.  But there 
was nothing to be seen except a few 
stones peeping out through a tangle
of nettles and rushes & bracken.
