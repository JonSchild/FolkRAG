that Mr. Spivacke referred to me
and others that I have heard
of around Beaufort, S.C.
You might forward our
next mail - if any - to
Winecoff Hotel, Atlanta,
Georgia. It's hot, but we

You and Elizabeth might
continue to pass yourselves 
off under "John A. Lomax 
and party."  That Senate debate
after 4:30 ought to 
be worth while. Bon 
voyage to all your projects.
Father
