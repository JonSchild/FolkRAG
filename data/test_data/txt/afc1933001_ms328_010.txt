Caudlesworth.

Come all you of Caudlesworth
Come set you down and mourn
Our colenel he is captured
The news already come
The yankees from Sandy
Upon us they have run
They've captured all our boys
And broke up all our guns.

Major Cheyneyworth he fought them
Made them all retreat
I wish you might have beenthere
To have heard the horses feet
Although they reinforced
And back again they came 
The weather being cloudy 
There fell a heavy rain.

All around our houses
Like murderers they did creep 
A-firing on our boys 
Wile they lie there asleep
They fied on our colenel 
Some twenty rounds or more
Expecting every moment
They'd bring him to the floor

His waist a-being slender
And he a-being small 
He wasn't to be hit
By an abolition ball
Come rally to your posts boys
All ye that's left behind
We'll all join together
Some pleasure for to find.

Our captain he's gone out 
To see a little fun
Cheer up my brave boys
And shoulder up your gun 
And we'll show the villyans 
If they come back again
Can't capture Gladesville
Ever' time it rains.
