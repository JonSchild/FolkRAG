my impression of the war that we all 
are getting now is that we are fighting to maintain [for]
something that we do not have and that
something is Democracy, However I am
inclined to believe that there will be
a better and different type of Democracy
when the fighting is over and things
are again in normal condition, there
on the other there are reasons to be impressed
otherwise and the soldier upon returning
home may be treated as they were after
World War I. No need for discussion of that,
we all know what happened.
