Allan, 
       Man's name is Angus Cameron, editor for
Little, Brown & Co., 60 East 42 Street. Assume
he's written to you by now. If not, know he'll 
be grateful for some word from you.
        Please if you can, find time to write out 
50 to 100 words in synops' form. Know a Knopfs'
fellow who's interested. (Might as well get a book 
of folk-songs published before the folk perish).
        Has Elizabeth gone through the nasty business
yet? Give my best wishes to her and to the rest of 
that charming gang out at Arlington. If 
you will, give Botkin and the Flynn or Flenn fellow
(friend of Botkins' I gathered) greetings. Both
were very affable chaps; appeared to be very intelligent,
the kind of people who'd make enjoyable colleagues. (Not
college colleagues ). 
                                           Yrs,
                                                    Gital
