Corporal - "Yes"
Private - "He's down at the crossroads
turning around."

Wake up, Americans! Your enemies
are already awake.

If you have done your best, be con-
tented. If you are contented and have 
not done your best, you are plain lazy.

"Jesus died to make men holy. Americans
will live and die to make men free."
"Food is the first front, soldier the 
second front."
"All work and no play will feed 
the world the American way"
"You can't force the American people 
and succeed."
"Fight the good fight with all your 
might American's."
"Fight the American Way."
