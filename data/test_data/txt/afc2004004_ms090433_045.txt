Fisk, 3.  13.  DAVE EDWARDS.

here, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, different places, Florida, all the different places.

A:  What place do you like the best?  North or South?

E:  Well, I just liked some places.

A:  You don't have to be afraid; go ahead and tell me why you liked it there.

E:  Well, you just -- everybody is the same when you get to like.  They don't have no (sufferers?); they just go on and do that.  But the South, they don't do that.  We all go to the same hotel, eat at the same table here, but the South don't do it.

ARMY BLUES.

Now, folks don't on the bumping,
Ride s bumping town and country;
Go on folks on out to the bumping bee.

Lawd, I bumped in town
Lawd, I ain't gonna eat any lean meat now;
Lawd, them bumpers turned around.

Uncle Sam, heat that woman;
You sure can pick your man.
Uncle Sam, see that woman,
But he sure can pick your man.

Lawd, he taken he'da carried him;
Tomorrow got the land.
We aren't in a chain gang,
But Uncle Sam can do to him.
He would take that jitterbugging
Put him right in your own county, too.
