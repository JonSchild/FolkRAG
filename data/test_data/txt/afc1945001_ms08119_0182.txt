Joke (anecdote)

There were two soldiers
in a regiment who looked alike
you could hardly tell them
apart but they did not know
each others name. Many times
one would one to know the
others name from curiosity,
but never asked the other.
They both were in the same
regiment, bunked together and
had to guard together. The funny
part of it was that they never
drilled together, for at drill
they would hear the names.  (over)
