Dear Mr. Lomax,
While I was away in Pittsburgh
one of my boys, wishing to be helpful, sent you
an urgent telegram asking for the release of some
Folk materials. I fear you have a wrong idea
of the nature of my project. It is not a
commercial "cashing in" on somebody elses
work and vision. I am writing a Folk Song
Symphony in 7 movements for Chorus and
Symphony Orchestra. For 2 of these movement
I wish to use Folk Song Materials from
the two Books you and Alan have compiled:
From "Cowboy Songs" (p. 48) "The Dying Cowboy", and (p. 417) "The Cowboy's Lament."
From "American Ballads and Folk Songs" (p. 580) "Moanin."

I feel you ought to know that it will take
me 6 months to complete the work for
which I will get $500 00/xx ,,, $300 00 of which
I will have spent out for Copying. Nor will
the publisher make any money either - for the
reason that big Symphonies are not
commercially self sustaining - But culturally
need to be done.

I planned the work to further the very task
[work] which you yourself have successfully
devoted yourself - that of acquainting our
people with their own Folk Song.

I need a definite decision from
