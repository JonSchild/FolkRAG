Rumor:   A member of a club at a luncheon in the Fisher Building stated that he
                had been given good information that there was absolutely no tire 
                shortage necessary; that we have plenty of tires and rubber to last 
                five years if the Government would quit playing politics with the large 
                rubber companies and allow the synthetic rubber to be produced. He
                stated that one could buy all the tires if the right parties were 
                contacted and the gas rationing was merely a bluff and would never be 
                put into effect in Michigan, and he said that one had to but look at 
                the traffic which is just as heavy now as it had ever been and no one 
                even the officials themselves were paying any attention to the 
                Government's request to conserve on tires and rubber. This man was a 
                small manufacturer and failed after war was declared due to the fact 
                that he could not get materials. He seemed to be a rood citizen with 
                possibly a little bitterness thru his recent experience.
