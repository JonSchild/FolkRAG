Used to be bad niggers run up an' down the 
river - when they'd get in theese camps. tell me 
who they was - Charley Moody, was the bully 
of the Stream - Al Warner (Robertsville) - 
Jim Smith - Abe Cole, baddest of em' all - earned
his cap an' ball all the time - run the river.  drinkin 
& gamblin + shootin. Will (Cameron?), bad nigger is Boruan? scared Abe Cole.

Abe Cole went run to Coahoma & shot at the agents,
made em' get on their horses-
I was in the sheriff's office when

There was a terrible insurrection in this 
County - Clarksdale was the center - &
they had speakin' about movin' the courthouse -
people had to go cross the county to go to court-

You ain' goin' cur. is you?
I'd touch the trigger  & tell the hammer 
to hurry!

When I killed them 3 white men 
they said - "or Geo is worth a million
Hell he's worth the state of Mississippi
