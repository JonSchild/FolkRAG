A COWBOY DANCE SONG

My name is Sam, an' I don't give a dam;
Ala boys, give the fiddler a dram;
Swing the girls, an' let 'em go;
Rattle yer hoofs, an' don't be slow!

Doodle doo-de-doo, Doodle doo-de doo.

It's faro, monte, crack-a-loo
Grip ther fins, an' trot em through;
Balance! and all pass by;
Grab yer pardners on the fly!

Doodle doo-de doo, Doodle doo-de doo.

Some like girls thets purty in the face,
An' some likes girls thets small 'roun' the waist;
But give me the girl with a chubby fat han'
An' a dimple in her cheek like a hole in a pan.

Doodle doo-de-doo, Doodle doo-de doo.

She ranges on the Live Oak branch;
The purtiest heifer at the ranch;
With the hazel eyes an' golden hair--
An' try to steal 'er if you dare!

Doodle doo-de doo, Doodle doo-de doo.

Oh, I'm as happy as a king!
Fer we'll be married in the spring;
When grass has come--you bet you! and,
We'll start us up a little brand!

Doodle doo-de doo, Doodle doo-de doo.

Later, as I climbed up the rocky hill, again headed for Dening I heard her

sing cheerfully,

Give me a girl with a chubby fat han' an' a dimple in her cheek like

a hole in a pan.
