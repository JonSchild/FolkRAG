"Down at the Naval Aviation Base at Peru, (Indiana)
 they have incompetent young officers running the whole show. 
My brother-in-law is superintendent of construction and he 
says they are a bunch of dummies. How do guys like that get 
commissions?    Just a lot of politicians, if you ask me." 
Indianapolis, August 7          [*7*]
