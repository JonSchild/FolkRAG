- 10 - Rumors, 8-9 to 8-15  New York  8-18-42
New York 8-13 (Businessman): "It is extremely unfortunate that alleged evidence of 5th Column activity, with pictures showing arrows pointing to war plants, were published and then denounced by Washington. It places the civilian who is mindful of the war and on the watch for evidences of sabotage in a very confused position regarding his duty."
New York 8-13 (Street photographer): "I believe those pointing pictures were genuine but the Army got scared about how much we would worry so called them fakes. Don't tell me some of those wop farmers wouldn't help Hitler. You can't trust them."
New York 8-13 (Salesclerk): "My brother thinks all the spy stories are just the same as the ones about the arrows on the ground. They are most all fakes to get us war minded about the nazis coming over here."
New York 8-9 (Teacher): "We don't know anything about spying. The Axis has thousands of people here getting secrets and sending them to Berlin or Tokyo, but we haven't got a single man in Europe or Japan to do the same for us."

Price Control and Rationing
New York 8-11 (Taxi driver): "Those ration books they claim are counterfeit are genuine. Thousands have been stolen by people who work for the ration boards. Nobody wants to obey that law -- it's like Prohibition."
Buffalo 8-14 (Jewish salesman): "How is anyone going to make a dollar next year? A friend of mine just came from Massachusetts and says practically all businesses are closing down in that State because of gasoline rationing and other restrictions. How are we supposed to live? I know I can't possibly stay in business, I can't even drive my car. And I thought that was one of the things I was fighting for."
