A Diversified Farming And Industrial Area

Johnston County, North Carolina

North Carolina is divided into three principal areas distinguished
from one another by geographic characteristics, composition of population,
and types of agriculture. Extending eastward from the Tennessee border and
embracing about one-fourth of the area of the state is the Mountain Area. The
second area, which is generally called the Piedmont Plateau, comprises nearly
one-half of the state. Where it joins the mountain region the terrain is of
rugged hills which gradually pass to gently rolling land and on to a flat
area where it merges with the third division, the Coastal Plain. This area,
which comprises the eastern end of the state and includes one-fourth of its
area, consists of a vast plain stretching from the sea coast into the interior
of the county. The veteran boundary, where it joins the Piedmont Plateau, is 
a line of pre-historic sea beach. Johnston County is situated on the western
edge of this Coastal Plain.

[*Johnston County, North Carolina*] stands out in bold contrast to the single crop and plantation
counties. The area has never lent itself to plantation development. Cotton
is one of its commercial crops, but its place is subordinate to the more
profitable cash crop of tobacco. The farmers do not depend wholly upon either
crop. They raise a part of their subsistence, and they may share their time
or devote themselves exclusively to non-agricultural pursuits in a manner impossible
in areas dominated by a single commercial crop. One result is a
different Negro population distribution and orientation to the total social
economy. This reflects itself in their educational outlook, their standards
