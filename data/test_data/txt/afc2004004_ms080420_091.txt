TAPE:  Roll 25  Burton Cove p. 1
Cass:  Yeah, this song's I guess about 200 years old.  George
Washington sung it, (unint) chillun up on his lap. .and have fun,
it's a funny song.  He'd trod(?) 'em and sing 'em away, about
200 years ago.  I was up in New York, and they've left his bed
just like he made it up when he left. . . .(Sings):  "How's
I went down to dark, be a long market day/ Buyed the biggest
sheep that was ever fed on hay, to my fa, to my fadiddledee/
Wool on this ram's back reaching to the sky/ The eagle's built
her nest for I heard the young ones cry, to my fa, to my fa diddle
dee/ . ."
Sheila:  How would you like to be (unint. . . .) one of them girls (unint)
Cass:  Yeah, chillun and all like back then when George Washington
(unint.) and trodding it on their knees and singing that now. . .
Woman:  I heard that song started out -- I think it was Ireland, when
the sheep people brought in the sheep, into the cattle country.
You know, a cow doesnt have any upper teeth -- they twist grass off
with their tongue.  When the sheep came in they got close down to
the ground, and the cattle couldn't graze then.
Nell:  Starve them to death -- that's why they hated all them sheep
herders -- they tried to kill 'em and run 'em back into the country,
farmers did.
Woman:  You know, I didn't know that cows didn't have any upper
teeth till I was way up old.
