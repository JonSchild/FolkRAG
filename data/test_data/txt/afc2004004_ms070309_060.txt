on with our trip if we had to work
[so] with human excess baggage. Told
Miss Valien the same -- she agreed. Felt 
much better. Rest of evening with John
work getting his records ready for 
deposit and trying to work out 
his problems - mostly of incompetence,
laziness & lack of initiative on 
his part. Violently hot all day
in this filthy & ugly old town.
July 15. Life certainly moves fast.
Last night Pres. Jones and I talked
till 3 AM about his plans for 
community work in the South directed
at the race problem. He asked me to 
come in to set up a Nashville center
of folk lore work. Told him it  [we] tonight
it would cost $14,000 a year. He 
said he would go after the money.
Also wrote a new outline
for the trip. Tonight heard work
conduct his summer choir. Some 
good stuff - particularly one of the Golden
Gate's records copied phrase by
phrase & slowed down. Spent the
latter pt. of the evening recording
