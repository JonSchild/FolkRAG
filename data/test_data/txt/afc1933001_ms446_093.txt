No. 2     Give Me the Roses While I Live 

Wonderful things of folks are said
When they have passed away; 
Roses adorn their narrow bed
Over the sleeping clay. 

CHORUS 

Give me the roses while I live, 
Trying to cheer me on; 
Useless the flowers that you give
After the soul has gone. 

2 

Now is the time for words of praise, 
Handshakes and friendly smiles; 
Words that are spoken while here we stay
Always are well worth while. 

3 

Let us not wait to do good deeds
Till they have passed away; 
Now is the time to sow good seeds
While here on earth we stay. 

4 

Give me the handshakes in this life
That come from a heart of love; 
Don't wait till death shall call me away
To do deeds that you call love. 

5 

Kind words are useless when folk lie
Cold in their narrow bed; 
Don't wait till death to speak kind words, 
Now should the words be said,
