In the west of Ireland, and all over Ireland, frequently a
travelling person will call in at a house for a bite to eat.
They're always welcome, and the woman of the house will put
down the kettle, make some tea, maybe boil some eggs - whatever'd
to be had in the house. On this particular occasion, the
travelling man came round, of whom the man of the house didn't
take a very good view - he probably had seen him before - maybe
in a public house or somewhere. But the woman of the house, with
her usual hospitality laid out the table for him, and placed a 
big lump of butter -- a term we have in Ireland misconn?, being
the huge pat of butter taken from the churn, and laid on the
dresser; and she cut a big lump from this butter and placed it
on the table in front of the traveller. The old man, of course,
had taken charge of the cradle; he was rocking the baby in the
cradle, and when he saw all this butter going on the table for
the stranger whom he didn't like, he began to sing a little song
for the baby; and, at the same time, speaking to his wife
through the song. . .
SINGS: "TOO MUCH BUTTER."
Translation:  Take the slender end off it,
Ho-a-ho.
Take the two sides off it,
Ho-a-ho.
I'm giving you a sharp cry, oh woman of the three butters
That didn't just give him the ration for one person.

Out in Connemara in the old days, quite a lot of people were
rhymesters, and it was no trouble to them to make a little verse
on any subject that cropped up. This story has it that a young
man went home, and when he arrived home his sister told him that
a young dog, a pup his father had, had strayed, and of course,
they knew that their father would be very cross when he came home
and found the pup missing. The son immediately sang a song to
his sister advising her to find the pup quickly, or else.
SINGS: "THE LOST PUP."
Translation:  Certainly, Mary, if the pup has gone from you,
you had far better be dead when father arrives,
Because he'll make a poem that'll take the flesh from your bones,
And wouldn't he be right without having his dog?
You'd better tackle Joyce county and the lofts of Glen Hoghlain,
And search - - -
And you might get a little information
From those women who sell seaweed at Achronn.
