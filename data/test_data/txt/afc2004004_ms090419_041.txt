The Three Suitors...
It uz a man had a nice girl, you know--he raised her up 
nice-- and he told her, "Now daughter when you marry I want you 
to marry a rich man-- a man who's got something." She say . "All 
right. So they had three men asked to stay at the house all night--
a lawyer, bookkeeper and a tramp. Understand, lawyer, bookkepper, and a tramp. 
They didn't have but two beds and the girl slept with her mother 
and father and the tramp and the lawyer slept together. So way in 
the night these three--- the lawyer and the bookkeeper commenced 
talking. Say, "which way you going." Say, I'm going to New York. 
When I get there I have a little case to win down there. Pay me 
about $75,000." Old man say, "Daughter, that's the man you oughta 
marry." The bookkeeper say, "When I get down here and get 
out all my cotton and corn, I'll be worth about a 150 thousand [doll]
dollars." Old man, say, "Daughter, that's another one you want to 
marry." So the tramp, that made him mad---so he says to this 
man next to him, say, Man get off my prick. He said, Where your 
prick at? He said, Under you and outside that other fellow. 
She said, Ma, that's the one I want.
