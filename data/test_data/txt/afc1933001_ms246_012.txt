What are your suggestions?  I don't
feel like I am able (without you) to
stand the hardships of the South
Louisiana country.  Peter Hurd
wants me to bring the machine
a little closer to New Mexico
where he has located a lot of
stuff and I plan a trip to
the Panhandle, perhaps, for more
cowboy stuff.  I'll do whatever
you say -- if I can.  But the
machine is getting rusty in
the joints.

Lovingly,

Father
