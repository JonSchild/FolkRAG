Dear Dr. Spivacke:

We are returning herewith the photostatic copy
of the songs recorded by Mr. John Lomax at Parchman,
Mississippi. We should like very much to have you
send us the 780 cards containing the titles of all
the recordings made by Mr. Lomax while he was on the
Writers' Project so that we may have them copied.

Faithfully,
