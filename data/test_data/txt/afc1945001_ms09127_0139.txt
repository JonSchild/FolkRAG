Buck Pvt to his buddy
Buck Pvt "I think the cook has found a
substitute for rubber in these pancakes."

New Guinea Speaks
(from the Englewood News)

Lyin' in a foxhole,
Where minutes seem like years,
Where every now and then a shell
Goes whizzin' past your ears.

Here it's always hot as fire,
Or rainin' fit to bust;
The ground is either gooey mud,
Or dirty, chokin' dust;

You've got to keep real quiet,
Watch every brush and tree
Or get your bloomin' head blown off
By some Jap you didn't see.

Now it doesn't sound so pleasant
To hear me talk this way
