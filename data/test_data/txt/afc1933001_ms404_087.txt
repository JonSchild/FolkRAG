Marryville, Louisiana, will be
known in folk song annals
mainly because we found
there the ox-driving song of Mr.
Herman Weaver.  In addition to
giving us this song- he helped us
to secure all the other tunes related
to Marryville and vicinity.
But Mr. Weaver's one song has
been for us ample return for
the work we spent in this 
section of Louisiana.
