A

1. The more bonds and stamps you 
buy,
The more germans and japs will 
die.

2. Lets buy more bonds and stamps,
To keep our country free from saps.

3. While our boys our fighting on the
battlefront,
Let us do our part at the homefront.

4. The japs and germans are not alert,
Because they take their commands from
Hitler, the jerk.

5 .We are bound to win this war,
if  we all do our parts and then some
more.

6.  Until the boys have won,
They won't give up their gun.
