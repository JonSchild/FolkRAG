REMINISCENCES [*1936*]

[*Letter of Mrs. Ruby Piers Tartt*]

Livingston, Ala.

Dear Miss Miles:
A long distance call affects me like meeting a friend passing
through on a train. My mind's a blank until it's too late. I was so
sorry not to have been more help when you called, but to save me I 
couldn't recall the songs I've heard and enjoyed so many times.
There is a very old feeble-minded Negro who sings a couple of
songs that I cannot catch. They sound like they came out of the heart
of Africa. Then he sings one that goes like this, and he is the only
one I've ever heard sing it:
"Lord, I'm a-climbin' Mount Zionie, Zionie wid dat glory in
my soul."
Another one of his is: "Rocky my soul in de bosom of Abraham." -
and "Oh my brother do you love Jesus".
Then still another old Negro sings the "John Henry" songs,
"Boll Weevil" etc - is clever as can be, plays a harp and does a barn
yard and train imitation. He really is an artist.
Doc Reed sings "Slow down Chariot and let me Ride" beautifully.
Another lovely one of his is "John saw a nuther (?) man in de middle of
de air". Then a more familiar one "Thank God Almighty I'se free at
last" and that's when I weep! "Come Down Death" and "Travelin' Shoes"
are two of his others, also "Trouble Oh Lord is so Hard. Nobody knows
my trouble but God". Also: "Don't you Want to go to that Beautiful
City?", and "Soon One Morning", and another old one is "I'm goin' home
to die no more", of course these are the titles they have given me, or
