I - I have heard from several people that the Red Cross is unfair and that it would not give a needy soldier something without change.

II - About Sergeants in the Army - it is said by soldiers, that Sergeants are tough and mean and they don't always use the nicest language.

III - I have heard that because we are so busy feeding our allies we will not have enough for our people here in the future.
