I have learned from Samuel Bayard that the Barry Collection at 
Harvard amounts to about 180 cylinders, 76 of which are the early 
Edison type, according to Bayard unplayable on modern machines.  
These records are, so far as he knows, unrestricted and in charge 
of the Librarian of Harvard University.
I suggest that you write and ask for a temporary loan of the 
records, so that we can duplicate them for our collection.  The 
cost of duplication would amount to $153.00 for the duplication of 
dictaphone records themselves.  If Harvard College asks for a set 
of duplicates, the cost would be approximately $200.00.
I recommend immediate action on this matter.
