-3- Introduction

Anyhow, if I do any fightin' --- I reckon as to how it'll be
for th' poor people, and by God, not for you Rich people.

The best thing you can sing about or talk about is the Truth,
but looks like they wont let you do it. Wont let you get up and
say what you think.

Rich folks songs dont last long, 'cause they dont know what
to sing about. Bunch of sissy stuff. Bunch of silly stuff about
boots and saddles and cigarettes in the dark and a drink of whiskey
for two. They try to get too fancy and pretend too much. And they
get so all fired lost they couldn't find their eat with both hands.

Least, that's what I believe --- and this is a fee country.
