One night about a week ago, my friend and I were
coming home from a show. It was about 3:00 Sunday
morning. The street-car was almost empty, just two
women besides us. As we were riding along the women
started talking about the expected clothes rationing
One told the other about going to buy three complet
outfits and several fur coats. The other lady came back
saying that she was going to get five new dreese and
two sports coats and just one suit as she was kind of
low this month. My friend and I were startled, gosh!
these women sure must be up in the bucks, and so
they kept on talking about their gems and finery and
finaly we came to their stop, well they still were on
this side of the conductor and had not paid their fare
yet. and as they started to get off he asked them for it.
They rumaged around in their hand bags but failed to find
and funds. So at last we realized that between the
two of them they didn't has 16Â¢ for carfare.
