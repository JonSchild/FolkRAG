Assistant Regional Representative

SUBJECT:  Cooperation with Office of War Information August 3 through 8 

     The writer was one of several appointed by Mr. G. R. Parker, 
Regional Director, to cooperate with the Office of War Information
August 3 through 8 on a "study of rumors".  

     The entire period was spent in the towns of Huntington, 
Logan, Beckley and Bluefield, West Virginia.  During this period no 
rumors were heard.  I am unable to account for this.  The War was seldom
mentioned, and at no time did the discussion of the War get away from 
the current news topics of the day.  

R. S. Marshall
