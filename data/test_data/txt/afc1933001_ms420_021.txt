The MURDER OF HARRY SIMS

Comrades, listen to my story, 
Comrade, listen to my song,
I will tell you of a hero
That is now dead and gone,

I will tell you of a worker,
His age was nineteen;
He was the strongest Union man
That I have ever seen,

Harry Simms was killed on Brush Creek
In nineteen and thirty-two;
He organized the [Y.C.L.] miners,
(Also the N.M.U) He was union through and through.

(Repeat:)
He gave his life in struggle 
That was all that he could do 
He died for the Union 
Also for me and you

Harry Simms and I was parted
At five o'clock that day,
"Be careful my comrade",
To Harry I did say;

"I must do my duty",-
Was his reply to me-
"If i get killed by a gun thug,
Don't grieve after me."

(Repeat:)
"Just remain a faithful worker,
Dear comrade do be wise,
Help destroy this [Cap'talist] lousy system,
Don't fail to organize."

(Harry Simms was a pal o' mine.)
