they have to beg me to be easy. If I have to talk too hard.  
No, I don't mistreat em.  I love em too good.  I can't let em off
fur nothin, cause I have to talk too hard.  Grab em when dey feel
good an grab em when dey don't.  That's the bes time I love to
grab a woman, when she say, "Honey, I don't feel good.2  I say,
"That's all right.  Come on."
(Why is that the best time to grab them?)
You enjoy it bettah.  They can put up a pitiful
mouth.  They beg you to let em alone.  That's the very time
I'm gonna have em -- then.  That's the bes time, when they don't
feel so good. Git a good job out em, you understand, cause dey
don't wanna be bothahed wid you long.  Be glad when you quit.
(Do you think it's pleasant when they like it, too?)
Well, it is pleasant, too, but you understand, when
they like it, it feel so good, then you don't fell like workin
the next day.  I know what I'm talkin bout; I been married twict.
That used to be my favorite, every day an every night for six
months.  Dogged if she didn't show me sumpin.  I'd come in sometime, so tired,
so tired.  I'd have to wake huh up.  Heah I had done work all day in the street, an I'd have
to work all night.  I'd say, "Good God Almighty!  Heah, honey, take
this money an let me sleep."  She'd throw it back at me.X  "I don't
want that!"  Mmmmmmm-mmmm!  "Jesus, what mus I do?'  "Talk to me,
don talk to Jesus!"  One thing a man hates is, "Well, if you don't,
another man will."  Mmm!  That makes me mad.
(That hurts your feelings, doesn't it?)
WHAT YOU TALKIN BOUT?  I don't want no woman to tell
me that no time.  No, no.  Don't come tell me nothin like that.
I'm mon put my fist in one's mouth ef she tell me that too.
(Did yo u ever hit a woman?)
Mmmm. . .I ain't ever hit but one or two in my life.
