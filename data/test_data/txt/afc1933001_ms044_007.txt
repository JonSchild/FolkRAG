I herewith submit for your approval a list of the materials
needed in the furthermore of the work of the Archive of American
Folk-Song up until July first. The discs and needles will be used
in the preliminary transcription of the music of the folk-songs
contained on the discs. The permanent discs should not be used
in playing for students of music who wish to hear them. An estimate
of the needs of the Archive for 1937-1938 is in process of
preparation.
