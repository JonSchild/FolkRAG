Mr. Doyle Joyce
Vincennes
Indiana

Dear Mr. Joyce:

I want to thank you again for the assistance 
you gave me in Vincennes and for the 
fine folk-material you helped me to record.  
Mrs. Caney is certainly an unusual informant 
and your work with her seems to have been most 
understanding.

I will return your ms. in a week or so.

Sincerely yours,

AL:ed
