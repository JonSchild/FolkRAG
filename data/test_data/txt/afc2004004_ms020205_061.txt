teachers did, you know,  then, and my wife had been teaching and I 
assisted her in making that report each month, and a woman came to
take her place after she had to leave and go home, and she invited me
out to help her pastor - I'd been accustomed to that, you know.  I went
outthere that night and I stayed til I guess around eleven o'clock, and
I started home.  I was bachelor;  my wife had gone, you know, and I
