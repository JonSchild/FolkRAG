August 6 - The following comment is from an Omaha contractor, a
gentleman who comes from a family of contractors of several generations, is a
very conservative type, and highly respected. He has been building some of the
defense homes on the Bellevue project near the Martin Bomber Plant (Omaha).
He comes in daily contact with the plant's employees. He said: "I'm told the
plant is employing around 4000 people and they have turned out one bomber. It
seems to me that 4000 people should turn out more than that. And another thing,
I don't see why the Government is building all these defense plants in Nebraska
when they don't seem to be able to get the materials to produce." 13
