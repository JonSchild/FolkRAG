in his music and work he did not have
time for pals, although he was friendly with
every one. Some of his first pieces he learned
to play were,  There aint no corn bread here,
Baley take me back, and Frankie was a good
woman.

Hudie's mother and father were poor
people. They worked hard on the farm to make
an honest living. They had a standard record
through out Harrison County and Louisiana 
as being good honest respectable people. They
live for their son prayed night and day, for
him to be what he is today.

That song.

Mama did you bring me any silver?
Mama did you bring me any gold
What did you bring me dear mother
To keep me from the gallows pole.
Son I didn't bring you any silver
Son I didn't bring you any gold
I just came here to see you
Hang on the gallows pole.
