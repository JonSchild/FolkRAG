Reverend Roe - Reel 2 - P. 5

around there. I visited some of their homes and talked to them. They didn't
think about going to church."
That man, the gambler, was teaching the children. Hm, Hm! We find lots of
things that would surprise us, going out like that, you know, way out in the
rurals sometimes.
A:  People sort of brutallize about their experiences. They just don't care
any more.
[*Sunday school missionary*]
R:  They just don't care. Well, they forgot. Well, they don't have no one to
preach the Gospel to them. They don't see anything but something wrong,
wherefore, they forget about. . . That's why they did need the preacher there.
Now, then, I continued, you know, going and preaching. Finally, the Baptist
denomination, they kinda took holt to me because of my faithfulness, and they
made me a Sunday school missionary. Why then, I travelled around and got
acquainted. So pretty soon, a church, a little church, called me, it had six
members. . . Well, I taken the church, and I was ordained there. And I run a
revival there, and I taken about eighteen people, and I had a minister to
baptize um for me, to be my pastor, and then I made me some deacons and things
and got going.
[*Dream about establishment of church*]
And I'll tell you about that -- I belonged to the Bethlehem Baptist Church at
that time and they refused to recognize the call and ordain me. And I had a
dream, and in the dream I went down in a kind of a swampy place and there was
a stream of water. And I walked around that stream, and sometimes there would
be nice clear holes of water and then where it would run over, you know, and 
there'd be a little stream with muddy roots and things stagnant in it. And
I'd find another clear hole and it would go like that, and I looked up along
the banks - it was high banks - and I'd see, cedar trees growing. I went up
and got one of those cedars and I carried it down in the south part of town,
and I set it out where that was in a dream, and it grew and flourished.
