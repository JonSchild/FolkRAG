there and they hate all strangers. This country 
is on the edge of open fascist attitudes. 
Friar's pt. saw the Lula Holiness people
in the street with guitars, tamborine 
and revival. Joe Williams, extraordinary
young guitar player there also - recording
artist for Decca. Mr. Mason, the
druggist helped me make recordings.
The only music in the crowded Negro
section of Clarksdale that night was 
made by two harp blowers - one a 
moronic 6'2" fellow Slim from C. -
the other, a blind man from Como in 
Tallahatchie Co.. In the country  jooks
near Friars Pt. the young people danced
jitterbug to jook box jazz.  Ellington,
etc.
July 19. The Jones, Wormley and Allen 
came in right across the tracks. Long
talls with Jones - who is as lazy as a 
fool. In the afternoon a fine interview with
blind Turner Johnson from Como - under 
the blue blower on the harmonica I found
a very religious man who plays the blues 
but thinks they're wrong if you mean
them. In the evening I recorded him.
