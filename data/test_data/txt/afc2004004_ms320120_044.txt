roustabout, the oil fields and the Merchant Marines, for

[INAUDIBLE].
REED  Oh yes.  I would say 90% of the
monthly checks come from off shore.
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE]  What kind of a party
do you have?  What, what's the nature of this party here?
REED  This party, it's spontaneous.  I,
I've yet to plan, if that's what you mean.  It's a 
spontaneous thing with different faces every Saturday.  I
never know who's going to come here.  There are different
groups.  Now we have a few locals.  When they first started,
and incidently, it was like a half hour, an hour, and then
we went up to four hours, back to three hours.  Might have
to go down to two.  But it's just sort of a spontaneous
thing.  You see groups coming in.  And then they, they get
together and sort of trace their roots and then have what we
call reunions.  It's getting very popular.  The [UNCLEAR]
clan will meet tomorrow at [UNCLEAR] and all of that.
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE]
REED  Pardon?
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE]
REED  I, I think. . . .I think, like the
other ethnic groups. . .move back a little bit [UNCLEAR].
