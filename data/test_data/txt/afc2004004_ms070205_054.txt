of huge swelling laughter
- a miner for 49 years
in the same mine -
looks like a great redfaced
bear, kindly & ready to 
take of himself - a lump
of strength - knows a 
lot more songs than he
sang but they are all dirty
and he was solid, firm
tho friendly in [the] his
refusal to sing them -
He says he can stop blood with
his formula of Mary, Jesus
