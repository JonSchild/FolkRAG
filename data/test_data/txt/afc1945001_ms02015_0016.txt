Rumor committees should:
1--  Secure broad cooperation within the community.
2--  Analyze conditions in the community.
3--  Keep a continuous study of elements in community morale as indicated by rumors
4--  Foster unity within the community
5--  Encourage and improve general programs of information
6--  Explain the meaning of rumors in general
7--  Combat specific rumors when analysis shows it to be desirable
8--  Educate people to clear thinking and rejection of rumors
9--  Eliminate rumor mongers

Rumor committees should NOT:
1--  Spread rumors
2--  Make people anxious or guilty about what they may have said in the past
3--  Make people suspicious of their neighbors or afraid for personal security
4--  Be identified with any one self-interested organization.

Rumor spotters should not feel the need to stop rumors. Their job is to report 
them in.  Their role in the educational campaigns may be considered, from time to
time, but essentially they are to be observers, at least at this time.
