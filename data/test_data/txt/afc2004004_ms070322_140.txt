Wed. June 20.
While the Lochmar cruised down
the Eastern shore of the Hebrides I sat
in my tight cabin below decks and
typed. Letters to Australia. Duties.
Contracts. A bloody awful business.
I'm sick of possessions. Possessions
& my possibilities are making me
sick. Aches in various portions of
me and no joy in what's to
come.
An 1/2 hour out of Loch Boisdale
And the outpost of the Gaelic world.
A fine afternoon. Round the horizon
all kinds of weather. A great
mountain of cumulus to the East
matching & overshadowing the low
rocks of green & grey that is Uist
to the West. Long low clouds
runing over the island. And
back toward the sun
