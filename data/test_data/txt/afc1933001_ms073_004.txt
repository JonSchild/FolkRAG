Dear Spivacke:

You need never "shudder"
on my account for any
reason. I'm mild as milk
these days. Vide Alan!

I wrote to Alan that I
could use a machine ahead of
time. But don't hurry anything
for me.

Would you object to my going
to Chicago at my own expense and
on my own time? You can always
be entirely frank with me, as
you should surely know by this
time. Always sincerely,
John A. Lomax
