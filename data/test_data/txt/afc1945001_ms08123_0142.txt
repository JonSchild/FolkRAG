A friend of mine works in 
a dress shop downtown  Last
Saturday night there was a 
rumor going around that clothes
were to be retained after twelve
mid nite.  People not stopping
to find out whether it was true
or not tried to buy everything
they possibly could.  The store
was supposed to be opened
until ten o'clock, had to 
close early because they could
not handle the people.  When 
people did stop and think or 
bought a paper to con[?????] this
rumor the dress shop looked
like a cyclone had hit it.
