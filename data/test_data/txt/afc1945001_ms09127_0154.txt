Some of the rumors that I have
heard about the war are, That
Hitler is dead, The Japs torcher
their prisoners for information, and
some times just for sport, The 
Allies are going to attack Germany
through Spain & Italy, and ther's 
also a rumor that Japan is so
strong that they can hold out for
years & years.

I also heard a rumor that
down in Texas we have such a
large airplane hanger, that they have 
to have weather forcasters in side
to tell how the weather is going to be.
and they say its cloudy most the 
time inside, and it rains an alful
lot.  If a bomber wanted to taxi across
it, the men say it would have to 
refuel before reaching the other end, 
and one time they even lost a 
new pursuit plane for three days
because it was so cloudy.
