Dear Alan: I am glad to know that the shift
from the cloisters to the factory
is being made so successfully.

About the forthcoming request: I am
sure if it came in as a general fellowship proposal
rather than as a project, there would be no hope 
of its being considered before our regular fellowship 
awards are made in May. If it comes as a
general project request and if - and I am sure you
realize that this is a big if - the Board regards
the request with favor, the time of its beginning
would not be a deterring factor. I add this note
of caution because, as I told you in Washington, the
whole project is considerably outside the sort of
things the Fund has been doing in the last few years,
and I frankly do not know what the Board's reaction
will be. I think a letter from the OWI would certainly 
prove useful, as the more support you can get
the better.

Is there any further news from Johnnie
Faulk?

Sincerely yours,
Billy Haygood
