This statement means that you
and I owe Macmillan $152.83 on
the Lead Belly Book.  Subtracting this $152.83
from our joint $166.66 gives you and
me a total income from our work on this 
book of $13.83.   Lead Belly has 
received from the book $333.33.
Maybe Miss Barwick would
be interested, though I hardly 
suppose she, in view of her letter
to me and her constant coldness,
can ever think well of me.

Macmillan will not
demand payment of the $152.83
though they have that right now--
under the contract.

We have a small balance due November
30, on the Ballads.  I sent the statement
back to get what seems an error corrected
and will forward it to you when it is 
returned.
