I hope these remarks do not seem
discouraging from your point of view but
I am sure that if you are able to 
discuss the position with us personally
you will understand our point of view.

I am going away just now for
a much needed rest & don't expect to
be back until the end of January or
the beginning of February, when perhaps
we may see you in Edinburgh.

Yours Sincerely
J.L.Campbell

President, Folklore Institute of Scotland
