DALHART, TEXAS.
6/6/42.
Dear Mr. John: I got the book from my nephiew
Malcomb Stewart, Jr., and wrote the song off---
It has about 14 verses, and the best tune to
any of them, including the much over-rated ' ' OLD ''-
Paint'...  Got a good write-up in the Dalhart Texan
and a very good one in the Amarillo News and Globe,
in re:  "LIFE MAGAZINE''.... I THINK THAT LATER ON 
WE WILL GET MORE PUBLICITY IN REGARDS TO "LIFE"..
THIS BUNCH AROUND HERE LOOKED LIKED THAY HAD ? ? ? ?
IN THEIR PANTS, WHEN THE 'LIFE' CAME OUT, IN
FACT, SOME OF THEM COULD HARDLY TAKE IT.  YOU KNOW 
SOMETIMES THOSE THINGS ARE AWFULLY PAINFULLY, BUT
OF COURSE THE DOCTOR SAYS, THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE.
I WOULDN'T TAKE $5,OOO.00 for the "LIFE MAGAZINE'
WRITE-UP.
Your friend, 
Jess
