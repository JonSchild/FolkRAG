I know one man, they called min Chuckaluck [Same] Sanders and you [can] could see him
one day [he'd be] all broken up and bent up, walking with a stick -- and tomorrow
he'd be walking better than you [can] would walk, see. And the next day [when] --
you see him like he could hardly make a day -- just all messed up, just chuckled up, and tomorrow he'd be
running and walking straighter you can. He done a lot of dirt and
they arrest him and, after they arrest him, when they went to hang
him -- he [wasn't there] done so much they have to hang him -- and [On a street in Dallas] when they tripped the gallows & he fell [in] --
it was a bale of hay.
A. Do you know that to be true?
E: That what they say -- that's what my [folk town] foreparents say -- I don't
know nothing about it, but they say they know that for the fact.
