[*For your files, Mr. Lomax D.W.G.*]

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE SOUTHWEST REVIEW--

David Guion says--my
HOME, HOME ON THE RANGE
WHERE THE DEER AND THE ANTELOPE PLAY
is none of Mr. Lomax's business!

So, let Mr. Lomax and his Lead Belly sing the song they say is their own
discovery. The rest of the world prefers and sings mine!

Yes, even the late President Roosevelt and the beloved Will Rogers sung
and loved my HOME ON THE RANGE. And aren't John Charles Thomas,
Lawrence Tibbett, Richard Crooks, Norton Downing, Bing Crosby and all
the G.I. Joes, Marines and Sailors singing it too? Well, here's more
research work for Mr. Lomax!

I say, few, very few, have heard of Mr. John A. Lomax's Lead Belly.
Fewer care! It's a song they love and not the guy who writes and
records it. And, as for the shekels it does, or does not, bring in --
well, THAT is for Mr. Lomax to fuss and stew about. And therein lies
the real fly in the ointment!

Yes, Mr. Lomax, Mr. Lead Belly, Mr. Oscar Fox, Mr. Bob Swartz, many others
and, yes, a bunch of dead men all had a fling at it. But, it took one
David W. Guion to walk away with the HOME ON THE RANGE pie! That is
what sizzles my co-workers! And the amusing thing is that I, one
David W. Guion, gave all of these gentlemen, dead or alive, a chance at
the big fat plum! Well, they tried--and I now give them full credit for that!
