BJ:  I don't know what's the causin' of piles.  Some folks say
it's too much of pepper an' some say it's one thing an' some say
it's another.  I jus' don't know what's the causin' of it.  But I
[*(Pepper)*]
do know too much pepper's not good for it. . .Ya know, um-hum.  I
used to use so much pepper 'till the doctor stopped me.  But I
didn't have piles, but he jus' stopped me.  Ya see.  He said one,
the pepper -- too much pepper do ya -- one harm, it'll do ya another'n,
some other kinda harm.  I used to eat pepper off the bush.
Didn't care how hot it was.  Sometime I jus' take pepper an' bread
an' eat it.  I could eat it.  But now I can't eat it.  So, ha, so,
been off it so long, until I - that I don't wanta
eat it, nohow.  I find, ya know, that it's better for me.  See.
The doctor tol' Mama it'd make my blood too high, to eat too much
pepper. . .Yeah.  I was young but I just loveded pepper.  I [used] just
to eat it.

BJ:  Yeah.  Puts too much pitch to ya blood.  If ya blood already
good blood, an' then hit, that pepper make it, make you so fast, ya know?
