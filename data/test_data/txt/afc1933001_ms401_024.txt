I'm goin' down by de doctor's shop,
Jest as straight as I can go,
See if I can't find some instruement round
              dat place
Dat'll run my husband blind--

        Love my darlin', oh!
      I Love my darlin', oh!

She only found two marrow-bones,
She made him eat them all.
And he says, "Now my dear wife I'm blind
And just can't see at all."--

        Love my darlin', oh!
      I Love my darlin', oh!

Says, "I would go to the river and drown myself,
Honey, if I only knew the way."
She says, "No, my dear, come and go with me,
Mother 'fraid you'll run astray"--

        Love my darlin', oh!
      I Love my darlin', oh!

She got away down on the river side,
She wanted to see her old man drown.
He says, "My dear, kind wife, I cannot drown
Unless you shove me in"--

        Love my darlin', oh!
      I Love my darlin', oh!

She gits way back, takin' a long, runnin' start,
She goin' shev[r] her old man in,
Old man stepped just a little one side
And headlong she jumps in--

        Love my darlin', oh!
      I Love my darlin', oh!

Old man being so kind-hearted,
Knowin', too, de sweet wife could not swim,
He reached right back and he got a long pole
And he shoved her further in--

        Love my darlin', oh!
      I Love my darlin', oh!

Says, come all you young, hasty women,
Take warning after me;
Don't never try to down a poor old man
Says he's blind and cannot see-

        Love my darlin', oh!
     Two-eyed ride a babe (sic)!
