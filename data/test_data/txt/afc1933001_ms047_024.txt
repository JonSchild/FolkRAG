Lubbock, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Many thanks for your kind letter of August 19 which I
shall answer in detail later.  In the meantime, please send
the recording machine immediately as we have ordered the
converter and want to try it out.  Will you please send the
moving-picture camera too?  Alan is preparing to leave on
September 1.

Best wishes.

Sincerely,

Acting-Chief,
