                                      I WANT TO BE READY TO WALK IN JERUSALEM

CHORUS: 
I want to be ready, (2)                          (
I want to be ready, my Lawd,               (     (2)
To walk in Jerusalem just like John.    (

Well, the tallest tree in Paradise, 
Walk in Jerusalem just like John, 
Well, the Christians call that the tree of life, 

REFRAIN:
Walk in Jerusalem just like John,            (CHORUS, ONCE)
I'm gonna walk, walk, walk and talk,   (REFRAIN)
I'm gonna walk, walk, walk, and talk,  (REFRAIN)     (CHORUS)

If you don't believe I've been redeemed,  (REFRAIN)
Follow me down by Jerdan stream,  (REFRAIN)       (CHORUS)

When I was a sinner just like you,  (REFRAIN)
Bowed at the altar and prayed until I come through,  (REFRAIN)
                                                                                          (CHORUS)

I wouldn't be a liar, I'll tell you why,  (REFRAIN)
God's gonna call me and I wanna be ready to die,  (REFRAIN)
                                                                                      (CHORUS)
I'm gonna walk, walk, walk and talk, etc.                  (CHORUS)

NOTE: B.J. advises during transcription that the line "and prayed until I come through" is correct.
