When he was nine, [in knee pants] his spindly legs out of
knee pants or less, Track Horse was always preaching, and singing 
and taking up collection  in the abrrel house next door.  The rounders,
the gamblers and their sporting women, amused by his antics, would
throw pennies and nickles at him and he, running home, would unfold
[his] the sweaty fist with its treasure, [?] [?] story before his aunt.  
She would [always] say, "Lawd, chil' you gonna be a big preacher some
dat jes' like your daddy.  The preachin' bloods in you, sho , an'
such a young chil."  This remark with elaboration and counterpoint 
she would repeat [to] at the church sociables and picnics, while her
nephew [smiled proudly] at her skirt grinned with pride.
[The boy, Track Horse, had good reason to want to be a
preacher] A few months later his father came to the aunt's house
for a visit [He had come in] with the tales of a summer's triumphs,
of fat collections, of [crowd] crowded mourners' benches, of the 
discomfiture of many-a "jack-leg", local preacher.  He brought with
him a pretty, bright yellow woman, his new wife, Track Hore's step
mother.  She had made a great deal of the little boy, saying she
didn't know what she'd do with two preacher mens in the family.  That night
he woke up and heard some people singing.  He was all stiff all over
and couldn't move, He called his father and then he saw a great congregation
of people [in] dressed in white.  A tall man walked up and
gave him a book and said; "I want you to lead these people."  And
then there was more singing.  He had had a vision , so his father 
told him, and had been called to preach.  Nobody had ever heard of 
so young a child being favored by the Lord.  The women all made much 
of him and hsi aunt, who was ordinarially strict about such things,
let him stay home from school all week.  For Track Horse was [preparing]
preparing his first sermon.  Next Sunday he was to preach.  His father
had arranged it with the pastor of the Hard Shell Baptist Church,
where which the boy had only recently joined with the testimony--
"I have made it up in my mind to change. " The father and son
read the Bible together all week, hunting for a text, and then, [they]
having decided on one of the father's most famous , Track Horse
learned one of his father's sermons , period by period.  Now that
Track Horse had seen his vision, his father treated him quite as an 
equal . They nodded and talked, the bass and the treble trying
to be a bass, until Track Horse would begin to grow drowsy or his 
Aunt would come [in] pnd pull him away to try on some part of his
new outfit, She was immensely proud of him , would listen with shining
eyes while he recited his sermon , [standing with] his new clothes 
hanging on him by pins; but she was jealous that his father had
taken away from her the little boy.  "We better let God tend to his
own business," she would sigh while Track Horse tucked his chin
in , declaimed.
