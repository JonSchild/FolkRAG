One day while Hitler was being driven in the country, his driver ran over a dog in the road.  Hitler instructed his driver to go and express his apologies.  The driver left and after a few minutes returned with an armful of hams, apples, etc.  Hitler looked at him in surprize and asked, "What did you say to him?"  The driver replied, "I said Heil Hitler, the dog is dead", and he said, "Thank God" and gave me all these things.
