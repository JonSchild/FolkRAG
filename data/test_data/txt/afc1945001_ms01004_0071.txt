Dear Mr. Katz:

I wrote you on July 4th, in connection with the
activities of the Committee on Morale, which was set up some weeks
ago by the Canadian Government. The Committee on Morale wishes me
to visit Washington to discuss with various interested persons our
mutual problems. Mr. Hadley Cantril suggested that I should call
on you during my visit to Washington.

I shall arrive in Washington on August 2nd; I
should appreciate it if I could come to your office on Tuesday,
August 4th, at 10 a.m., to have a discussion with you about the
type of work you are doing. If this time is inconvenient for you,
I should appreciate it if you would let me know.

I am looking forward with anticipation to meeting
you on my arrival in Washington.

Yours sincerely,
J.A. Irving

J. A. Irving,
Research Secretary,
Committee on Morale.
