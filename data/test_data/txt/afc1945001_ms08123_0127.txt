"When a certain lady
 went to her [??] First Aid
Class she told the ladies,"
"There was a terrible accident
in front of our house the
other day.  A car turned
over and a man and woman
were trown from the car.
Each one's legs was broken,
and their faces were dis-
figured.  But I remembered
what you had told me
so I put my head in between 
my knees, and I didn't
faint".
