Hell Hound on My Trail

I got to keep movin',
I got to keep movin',
Blues fallin' down like hail,
Blues fallin' down like hail;
An' if they keeps on worryin' me,
It's a hell hound on my trail,
Hell hound on my trail.

[rept] ( If today was Christmas day,
           ( If today was Christmas day,  
A n' tomorrow was Christmas day
-----     A ,wwouldn't we have a time, babe?______
Lawd, I wouldn't need my little sweet rider
Just to pass the time away,
Aw-huh, to pass the time away.

You sprinkled them hot foot powd[ers]o,
Um --around my do',
All around my do'.
You sprinkled hot foot powdo
All 'round yo' daddy's do',
Um-hum
It keep me with a ramblin' min', rider,
Every old place I go,
Every old place I go.

[rept.]  (I can tell the wind['s] is risin'
            The leaves tremblin' on the trees,
             Tremblin' on the trees.)

All I need is my little sweet woman
To keep my company,
My company.
