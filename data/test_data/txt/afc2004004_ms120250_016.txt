dances, that is about three feet tall, a foot broad at the head
[narrowing down to] tapering down to a base  a foot broad, but of lighter
[construction] wood than mama and with a thinner shell so that the sound
is a metallic sort of bark, rather than a deep woody roar like the mama.
The drummer was [pulling] stretching the head taut with [ropes] the ropes that pull[ed] at
the crown of soft light wood that holds down the goat-skin head of the
drum and Saul, master of the rara band, was knocking home the corwn with
deft blows delivered with a great stone on a baton of mahogany.  Ta-ta and
bass [shoot] stood by waiting for baka to begin.  [Tat-ta] Ta-ta is a tiny
drum , not a foot high [or a] and scarely a hand across that hangs about
the neck close to the heart and is beaten with two little sticks.  [Bass] It
has two faces. But bass is like a tambourine, a great tambourine and so
has only one head; [which] this is sprinkled with powdered beeswax and rubbed with
a thumb.  Bass growls or roars or groans deeply, have it the way you like.
[but that is the sound it makes.] Bon, baka is taut and begins to bark. The
general of the rara bands holds his little oil lamp high in the air and
begins to sing "Moin c'est pitite papa-yoyo,
Ouvri [potre] porte-la, pou' moin entrer." (1)
The men  all about, who have been arguing, shouting, cutting a few preliminary
capers, join in, then ta-ta, then bass, then baka.  The rhythm is a
march rhythm, the song is gay and light-hearted and the whole crowd begins
to shuffle and revolve its hips.  The words of this rara song as of all I
have heard are what we call "dirty". The tunes are all merry.  And the dancing
is masculine in its emphasis. The singers are men. All this is new
to me, for I have only seen voo-doo dances so far and [they are all] there
the woman takes the lead. She does all the singing and most of the dancing.
She shakes her shoulders [and hops from] and belly or hops from one foot to the other
so that her whole body shakes or sways or shakes her hips from side to
side. But [in] the rara dance( at least that part of it that is at all
comparable to the voo-doo) reproduces the screwing thrusting movement
that is the pecualiarly male role in sex intercourse.  Rara season is
spring, even though there is no spring here.  It is pre-Lenten rejoicing.
Some men carry great tall poles and sincerely don't know why, but just
as sincerely do so because they like to.  [Convenion] The conventions of
propriety are thrown to the winds, more and more as the season draws to
a close; not of course that rara is an orgy. It is not. It is a season
wehn people have a good time, when they show what is the most interesting
thing in the world to most people, when they revolve their hips and thrust
with them. Toward the end of the season the men and women dance together, (and the penis sits against the female belly)
but now when the bands are [only] merely beginning to practice only the young girls
are to be seen and they are not dancing with the men. As for the women, who
took such a prominent role in the vaudoo bamboches, they are at home in
bed considering more serious matters. But here we have our men and they are
beginning to dance. The drums have been going for minutes.
The general with his candle has fought well and cleared a space before the
drums and suddenly out between the legs of the men appears a little boy
about twelve years old, brown-skinned and with big soft eyes. His big
bare feet are set with their heels together, an arc the size of a third
