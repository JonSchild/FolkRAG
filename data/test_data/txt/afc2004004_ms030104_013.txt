That's what's gonna send you to Hell.
AAAw, God'll forgive you
God'll forgive you for anything you do
[He'll] But blaspheming against the Holy Ghost
He'll forgive you for sayin anything 
But [saying that] there isn't a God
Heâ€™ll  forgive you for anything 
But saying that God's son [didn' come in the likeness of]
Didn' come in the likeness of human flesh
To take away and condemn
Sin in the flesh
But if you say that
You got to go to Hell.
But regardless of what you do
If you jus' believe an' be baptize'
You shall be saved
I don' mean believe because what I say
But the record[s] says believe.
If you please, here's a man...
You know [there's] some people believe
That what you [were] wear will keep you from goin' to Hell.
You know some people believe [that] that, you know
[That, you know] They can jus' make a little money
An' get 'em some nice clothes [and get of]
And get off there with the upper ten, you know
I'm not goin' to Hell because I'm in society.
But your clothes don' keep you from goin' to Hell.
Here's a man, here's a man [who] that wo' fine [raiment] linen. [*Fine linen!*]
An' lissen, in his day when he lived,
Fine linen was fine linen.
Aw this little tapestry that you spread on your table
An' these little $15 suits that we buy, brother, an' call linen
Isn't to be compare
With what Dives wore.
Dives [wore fine] had pure linen.
