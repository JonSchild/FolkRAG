To who it may concern:

The enclosed poem was passed on to 
me as a joke. To the right people, it will 
be laughed at and forgotten. To the rest 
of them, trouble may arise.

It is my opinion that this could 
serve very well as anti-democratic 
propaganda. I wish you would find 
the source and stamp it out.

Until Victory,
George A. Willen
