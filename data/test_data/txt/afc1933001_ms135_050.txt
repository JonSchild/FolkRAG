Dear Dr. Spivack:

I have a letter dated July 21st, with which
you are doubtless familiar, from Mr. Alan Lomax, stating
that he would "leave a group of twenty selected
records in Dr. Spivack's care to be forwarded on to
you as soon as necessary arrangements can be made". In
his letter Dr. Lomax pointed out that in many instances
such records are not very satisfactory as high fidelity
recording specimans, and indicating the method in which
they have to be played.

Recognizing these facts I still would like
to audition some of these records to familiarize myself
with their general quality, etc., and so request
that they be sent to me, if such can be arranged, as I
very much hope it can. The transport cost naturally
may be charged to me, and I will agree to hold them only
so long as is permissible. I would like to have them
at least a couple of weeks here.

For your information, I have no intention of
utilizing these particular records in any commercial
way. As indicated in a previous letter to Mr. Lomax,
my immediate desire is to get some taste of the remarkable
collection of material of this character which I
am advised the Library has accumulated. If all goes
well, later I will want to utilize some of this in
connection with a motion picture project. Doubtless
there are portions of the collection whose use is not
restricted; and others with restrictions that will have
to be met.

I am appreciative of the interest taken by
Dr. Lomax and shall appreciate deeply your own kindly
cooperation.

Sincerely,
G P Putnam

Dr. Spivack,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.
