Reverend Roe.  Reel 10.  P. 3
And the conditions they have to live in?  Doesn't that 
make them susceptible to the Devil's -- 
[*Trust in God and your difficulties will disappear.*]
R:  Well, it's some [of them,] they do.  There is some people that bad treat-
ments drive them nearer to God, and some it drives them the other way.  
Because we [as] who are good Christians believe that the best thing we can do is 
to hold our peace and let God fight our battle.  And then we believe 
that if all of the people of our race would turn to God and trust 
him and cease to fight, I believe that God would bring things to pass.  
And I think [that] the greatest failing [?] in humanity is the very fact 
that he will just not trust in God; he get him a gun; he wants to

get justice in a court where there's nothing but white folks.
[*unequal opportunities*]
A:  What do you think about the condition of the colored folks here in this 
town now -- about sanitation, and housing, and all these things?
R:  Wel, it's not good; we don't get justice along that line.  This 
segregation law, I think, works hardships on us.  I would have no 
objection to the segregation law if it was something like equal, you 
know, equal opportunities, you know.  I wouldn't object so much; I
