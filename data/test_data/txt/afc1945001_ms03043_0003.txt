RUMORS IN NORTH CAROLINA

During a survey of the central part of this State the following rumors came
to my attention:

1. What rumors people are telling:

In my opinion this is the worst type of statement that a Selective Service man
could make because in my experience in coming in contact and talking with farmers
they are a type that is willing to do anything that is necessary to help the war
effort but they do not feel like men in official positions such as Selective
Service should make such statements unless there is some basis for it. A statement
like this may have such affect on the farmers that it would cause them to
slow up on producing all the products that they can in view of the fact that a
rumor was started that their farms might be taken away from them.

2. Which rumors are being told most often?

The rumor relative to the draft board in Raleigh, North Carolina is being
told most often. The party who talked with me stated that he had heard it
approximately twenty-five or thirty times and that each time he talked with someone
who had a son in the service it was the main discussion. Outside of this one
particular rumor the others I have stated are not widespread at all because I
only heard them one time.
