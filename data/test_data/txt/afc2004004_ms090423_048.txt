Attitude Toward the Plantation Youth and the Influence of Movies.

"Lots of these youngsters just act like they in a flock. Most 
of these youngsters go to the show. And some parents don't mind and 
don't care; have whole lots of families where the child is the head
rather than the parents. yes folks now a day just talking about the 
child got to have his pleasure. They think there ain't no harm at just 
looking at the picture, nor if they is dancing and cutting up, or 
straddle the fence. 

Yes, I goes to town practically all the time, but let me tell you, 
I seldom goes there with anything worth any count on my mind. Now and 
then I shows myself round in town, but most of the time I goes to the 
pitcher shows. I likes to see the cowboys, and them colored peoples 
that they show from Chicago. They're really a kill."
