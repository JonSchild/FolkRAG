---water---
Ol' Riley walked de water,
In dem long hot summer days.

When ol' Riley was a-leavin' , (2)
In dem long hot summer days.
Ol' Rattler come a-rollin', (2)

Ol' Rattler couldn' trail him,

It was July an' Augus',
They was long , hot etc..

Then ol' Riley taken a notion.

Taken a notion to walk de water,

Ol' Rattler got out a-rovin',

He was a barkin', "Hooo-----"

Ol' Riley , farewell,
