Dear Mr. Lomax,

This letter, in reply to your letter of May 16th, has been delayed
because of a trip abroad, for which I apologize.

I am glad to hear of your activities concerning your work in an
extensive way, and I wish to express my great interest in it.
I should highly appreciate to have the opportunity to publish it.

But since this work will be sizable, and with many figures (40
diagrams in three colors mean 120 plates, etc.) its publication
should be subvented. I am sure that you will succeed in receiving a 
subsidy. If necessary I can help to place some addresses at your
disposal. But to quote the exact amount I need, it is necessary
to have it calculated, and invite you herewith to send me, by
registered mail, the finished part of the manuscript, and a 
description, as accurate as possible, of the remaining parts you
further planned to write.

Moreover I wish to draw your attention to the following. Your
article "Song Structure and social structure" will be published
in ETHNOLOGY. Professor Murdock and I are agreed to consider the
publication of certain papers also separately (we for instance
will publish in due time the "Ethnographic Atlas" in a single
volume). In my opinion your article would perfectly fit in this
system with the view on its topical merits. If you can agree with
my proposal to publish it also separately, in an edition of 500
copies, please inform me by return of mail, so that I can contact
Professor Murdock to hear his conditions.

Looking forward to hear from you soon, I am,
sincerely yours,
Meeusen,
W. Mee√ºsen
