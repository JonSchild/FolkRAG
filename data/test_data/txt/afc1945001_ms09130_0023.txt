12B - Boy - Negro

I - In England the food 
shortage is so acute that if 
a ham on the stage is struck by 
a rotten tomato, he stops and
asks where they got it
II - It is said that the 
babies of France are 
starving, but the General's 
wife of that area bathes 
every morning in milk.  
good old Hitler
III - In Germany and abroad everything 
is done for the fatherland 
I wonder if Hitlers recent
setbacks in Russia are for 
the state also.
