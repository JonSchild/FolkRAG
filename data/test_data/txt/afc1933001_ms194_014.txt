Dear Alan:

This is the answer to your letter of November 11.
Strangely enough, I received at almost the same time a
request from your father for a recording machine.  The
sad part about it is that at the moment we have absolutely
no machines in the Recording Laboratory.  Every one is out
at work or on the way back from a project overseas.  As a
result, I fear that there is little likelihood of our
having anything available for you until after the first of
the year.

If you can wait that long, I shall be glad to try
to work out the details of the project.  I hesitate to do
so until I hear that you can conveniently put off this part
of your activities until the beginning of the next year.

I was interested in the circular regarding the Town
Hall series and would like to see a program if you have an
extra copy to spare.  When sending in a program, please let
me know from whom we can order recordings and I shall take
it up with the Acquisitions Department.

I hope that you and your family are well.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Music Division
