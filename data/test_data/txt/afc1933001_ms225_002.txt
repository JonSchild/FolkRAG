Dallas, Texas

Dear Father:

As you probably noticed on Tuesday, at 3:35,
I have been quite ill for two or three weeks. 
A couple of days I spent flat on my back of 
Streptococcus throat. This is the reason why
I haven't written you. I will try to reply to
your letters in full as soon as possible. I
have a vacation of two weeks, and in that time
I will finish up the unfinished business on the
book ad also my unfinished correspondence with you. 

In the meantime,  here are two matters in which
you can help me, and I think they will amuse 
you besides. These two old ladies have sent
me the best songs of anybody from Texas, and
they sound like people who know a great deal
of material. I'd like to get the tunes to
"Little Colen Annie" and "I Sold my Clock and
Wheel." I thought perhaps Deanie might be in-
terested in calling on Mrs. Smith and remember-
ing her for the first contact of your forthcom-
ing recording trip, and I feel sure you or Deanie
would know someone in Waco who would do me the
favor of visiting Mrs. Brown and sending me her
two tunes. I want to use these songs on my 
April 16th program, so if anything is to be done
it has to be done at once. Please return the 
letters within the next couple of weeks, for I 
will use them for speech material.

The St. Louis business has been shelved for
practical reasons. Elizabeth has just come back
from Mexico and I am very well contented. With
best love to you both and in expectation of an-
other letter soon, I am,

Your son,
