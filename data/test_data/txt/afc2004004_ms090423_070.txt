"watch and tend the crop", (2) the increase in the leisure time: and 
(3) the increased accessibility of the Negroes on the plantation to 
the ways of the city people.  For example, fifty families have radios 
and the urban newspaper is read by thirty families.  The most remote 
section of the plantation is now accessible to the county agricultura
and home demonstration agents who bring new ideas and new ways of doi
things.  There is also the agricultural high school where both the 
city and rural children come in contact: they come in contact with 
urban technological artifacts as well as with the teachers who are al
city bred.

The plantation Negroes go to the city.  Twenty eight out of the 
total of one hundred families reported that some members of the families go to Clarksdale at least one in every two weeks while the 
remaining seventy-two families go to Clarksdale three times a week.  
Thirty families have automobiles.  On Saturday morning the trucks sen
by the merchants in Clarksdale bring the plantation Negroes into town
After the cotton picking season is over in January, the plantation Negroes have hardly anything to do till spring.

In addition to general trips to town there are special events or seasons which bring the plantation Negro to Clarksdale.  The followin
are some of the main events:

January - New Year's Celebration
March - Afro Sons and Daughters Convention
April - 4H Club Rally, Fireside Exhibits, Ham and Bacon Shows, Easter.
May - Field Day (all county schools come and parade), City School Commencement
