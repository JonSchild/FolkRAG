1587B     (2)

There she stopped & there she halted,
These two soldiers stood gazing around;
And in the space of a half an hour,
This young lady lies speechless on
[?] the ground.

And when she did recover,
Threw her fan down in the lions
den,

Saying "Which of you to gain a 
lady
Will return my fan again?"

Then up stepped this brave lieutenant,
Raised his voice both loud & clear,
"I know I am a [brave love]dear lover of women,
But I will not give my life to love!"

Up stepped this brave
sea captain,
Raised his voice both loud and high,
"I know I am a dear lover of women
I will return her fan [[? ?]]or die."
