Chain Gang Negroes       Page Eight

Negroes sing a slow work song the words of which fit the mood of those weary
Mississippi boys. Calling the sun "Old Hannah, dot hot broiling sun turnung

"I looked at Old Hannah an' she's turnin' red,
I looked at my pardner an' he's almost dead.
Go down Old Hannah, don't you rise no mo',

Unfortunately, penitentiaries, like institutions for the insane, reform

such places is sometimes a grave reflection on organized society. Moreover,
prison managements cannot know always what happens when inhuman guards are

religious services. One Sunday in the penitentiary at Richmond, I was
surprised when attending a chapel service to listen to a sermon by a Negro
Chaplin preached to an audience about equally of Negroes and whites, who sat
