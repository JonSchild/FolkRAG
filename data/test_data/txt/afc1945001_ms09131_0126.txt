A friend of my mother's was a member of Polish aristocracy.
She lives in this country with her husband and children. Last
year she recieved a letter from her brother in Poland- he 
was the President of an mawbance company. In his letter
he told his sister that he was not loving all she
knew he had, all this asked her for clothing. It was
 sent through the cerast, there for his sister did not send
anything to him for fear the German Army would take it.
