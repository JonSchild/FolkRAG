Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
Thank you very much for the interest you expressed in
the proposed plans for WNYC's first Annual Festival of
American Music, February 12th to 22nd. Mrs. Yurchence, with
whom you spoke, has told me that you would be interested in
participating. It would be a privilege to have you present
one of the programs in this series, a series which we hope
will contribute much to the advancement of American music.
Could you prepare a half hour program dealing with some
aspect of American folk music? If it is suitable, we are
reserving Monday, February 19th, from 6-6:30 p.m. for your
program.
We already have two other folk music broadcasts
scheduled, neither of which would conflict with your
program. Professor Roy Mitchell and "The Consort" are
going to do a recital of the various foreign folk songs
which have become part of the heritage of American music.
Mary Barnicle of New York University and Tony Kraber are
presenting a program of standard American folk ballads, such
as "Casey Jones", "Jessie James" and so forth.
Incidentally, you might be interested to know that among
the artists and composers who already agreed to take part in
the the Festival are Deems Taylor, Morton Gould, Henry Brant,
Earl Robinson, Ralph Kirkpatrick and Wallingford Reigger.
Very sincerely yours,
M.S. Novik
Director
