Childe Allen

Using her watch to catch his pulse, and making mysterious records. 
15
Wi' an eldrige dial in her hand 
She hands my wristbane ama' 
And syne a spell of grammarye 
She writes upon the Wa'. 

Nor will she let him go till all his skin has come off 
16 
"And she swears by God and S. Luke 
That never shall I win free
Till she has flayed the skin awa' 
From a' my fair bodye. 

Not the least of his woes is the light diet. 
17
"It's little I thought when I came here
With sair sair aching head 
That I'd break my fast on the barley bree 
But and the toasted bread." 

Contrasted with former meals now seem through a rosy light. 
18
"O it's little I thought in Randall Ha', 
Feasting wi' feiries nine; 
That I supped my last on the venison 
But and the gude red wine. 

He says a sad farewell to the messenger.

"Gae home, gae home, my brither dear" 
x  x  x  x  x  x
