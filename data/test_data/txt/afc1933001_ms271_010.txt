YOU BETTER GET READY

1) I had a dream the other night,
SING ON, BROTHER SING!
About a war we've got to fight,
SING ON, BROTHER, SING!
I dreamt the devil come to me,
And woke me up from out my sleep,
And here is what he says to me:
SING ON, BROTHER, SING!

Chorus: YOU BETTER GET READY, BROTHER
YOU BETTER GET READY, Brother
YOU BETTER GET READY 'CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT.
YOU BETTER GET READY, BROTHER,
YOU BETTER GET READY, Brother,
YOU BETTER GET READY 'CAUSE YOU MAY BE CALLED TONIGHT.

2) I raised up from out of bed,
SING ON BROTHER, SING.'
And to the devil this I said,
SING ON, BROTHER SING!
Pray, tell me, sir, what brings you here?
Trifling, gambling, wine or beer?
Or is my death now drawing near?
SING ON, BROTHER SING!
[(Chorus)]

3) The devil opened up his big black book,
SING ON, BROTHER, SING!
He opened it up and he took a look!
SING ON, BROTHER, SING!
He read off Adolph Hitler's name,
And said, Old Hell just ain't the same,
Compared to the Fascists, brother, I'm tame!
SING ON, BROTHER, SING!
[(Chorus)]

4) I then pulled on my fighting pants,
SING ON, BROTHER, SING!
The devil of hell he sung and danced
SING ON, BROTHER, SING!
He said, if you will win this war
And drive the fascists out the door,
I'll never raise hell on earth no more!
SING ON, BROTHER, SING!
[(Chorus)]
