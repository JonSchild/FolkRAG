GALLEY FORTY-NINE
JESSE JAMES
First Version    [*1*]

Jesse James was a lad that killed a-many a man;
He robbed the Danville train.
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.

Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,
Three children, they were brave
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave. *

It was Robert Ford, that dirty little coward,
I wonder how he does feel,
For he ate of Jesse's bread and he slept in Jesse's bed,
Then laid poor Jesse in his grave.

Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor,
He never would see a man suffer pain;
And with his brother Frank he robbed the Chicago bank,
And stopped the Glendale train.

It was his brother Frank that robbed the Gallatin bank,
And carried the money from the town;
It was in this very place that they had a little race,
For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground.

*A variant refrain runs:
Jesse's wife was a lady all her life,
Three children, they were brave;
But the dirty little Ford, he beat her of his board
And laid poor Jesse in his grave.

They rallied out West for to live upon the best,
The Fletchers asked their names;
They laughed and smiled as they made their reply,
"We are Frank and Jesse James."

It was on Wednesday night, the moon was shining bright,
They robbed the Glendale train;
The people they did say, for many miles away,
It was robbed by Frank and Jesse James.
