BATSON          page 3.

Batson' mother cried,
Batson' sister cry,
Batson' sister asked him,
When you coming back again?"

They brought poor Batson to the gallows,
They brought him back to the hall,
Batson asked the judge
If they going to take his life.

Batson asked the judge
Was they going to take his life,
Judge asked [/Batson]   /Mr. Batson
Haven't you done that crime.

Batson begin to moan,
Batson begin to groan,
Batson begin to tell those people
He'd never see home no more.

Batson told his brother
The day they brought him back at home
Says, "If your brother has to lose his life
I tell you what I want you to do."

Batson asked the sheriff,
He asked him that two, three times,
Says, "All I want you to do for me,
Take care of my two little girls."

Batson' mother,
Batson' mother cried,
Batson's mother had tears a-running
Clean out of her eyes.

They  brought him from home to the gallows,
They brought him back to jail,
He started looking around over the people,
To see/for the last, last time.

They brought him his coffin,
The day he come to [dey]die,
And he asked the sheriff
"That's the last [place I'm goo] thing I'm going to lay down.

[*one last stanza we couldn't get*]

[When then the priest spoke to poor Batson 
Just like a baby
Say,"yonder comes your black box,
You'll never rise again"]  (?)

Then the priest told Batson,
"Black box takes you down,
Says, "Here comes your black box,
You'll never rise again."
