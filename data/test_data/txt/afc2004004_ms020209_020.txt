Keep On Walkin'
Words & Music: By PATRICK SKY
Â©1966 by Whitfeld Music,Inc.
1. The life I lead is a won- der-ful life, But the life I lead ain't mine; I
may be wrong but I'm sure not close to be right most all the time; The way I look you could
write a book, and des-cribe me in one line; If you want to find out just-a where I am, then
follow the e- gress sign. (And baby) Keep on a- laughin' and walk- in', Say
Keep on a- smilin' and talk-in', Keep on a- do-in' what you're doin', Gonna fall in love with you.-
2. I'll nev-er forget to re-mem- ber her name, Though I just can't place her face; E-ven
though her face is a com- mon place,to misplace a face em-brace; If you have to go then
please don't stay e-ven though it is- n't true; My- mo-ther was one, my father was one, and
I'm a- gonna be one too. (And ba-by) Keep on a- laughin' and walk- in', Say 
Keep on a- smilin' and talk-in', Keep on a- doin' what you're doin', Gonna fall in love with you.-

WHEREIN PATRICK SKY
EXPLAINS HIMSELF IN SOME DETAIL

When your girl runs away and your teeth fall out
and the records wont play like Guiness stout
and your toe hurts bad and you are full of grief
and you steal from your dad and become a thief
And Life is a joke from line to line
and ill be yours if youll be mine
And your dentist turns on and the needle slides
and you miss the grove and the nurses hide
And Johnson is sick and Humphrie is blue
And Goldwaters fingers are made of glue
And writers write, and lovers love
And pacifists pass and divers dove
And books are gone to the other side
And your eyeball flops from side to side
There aint no use in how you feel
because your hair is turning wheel
Just sit and winder
what makes the wind blow
cause this whole poem is innuendo.
-Patrick Sky
(Ed. Note: "Keep On Walkin'" is also innuendo -- or as
Pat calls it, a nonsense song. The poem above will appear
in the liner notes of Pat's next -- his 2nd -- Vanguard
L-P album: "A Harvest of Gentle Clang". It is
scheduled to be released about the middle of May.)

IN THIS ISSUE
"The broad-based program includes the establishment of free-bombing
zones in Vietcong areas, killing rice crops and burning all other 
crops and homes"-in other words, massive annihilation of all human
civilization in such zones.
The AP dispatch goes on to document this scorched-earth policy
in action, carried out by the 173rd Airborne Brigade:
Armed HU-1B helicopters poured 3,000 rockets into villages
that used to harbor Vietcong. They burned to the ground every
hut they could find. Sampans were sunk and bullock carts
were smashed. The 173rd laid their base camp among the
blackened frames of burning houses. Within two miles of the
paratroopers' camp not a house was left standing ....
Patrols burned every house they encountered to the ground ....
Every cooking utensil was smashed, every banana tree severed,
every mattress slashed. About 1,000 tons of rice were destroyed.
Thousands of ducks and chickens were slaughtered or carried
off. Dozens of pigs, water buffalo and cows were destroyed.
A 20-mile stretch along the Vaico Oriental river was left scorched
and barren...the men of C company found more than 60 Vietnamese 
women and children weeping as they lay in trenches
around their devastated homes....
American advisers are divided in their opinion of the effect
of breaking up Vietcong families. Some felt it was a good
idea. Others felt the men would fight with greater bitterness
(when the women had been placed in "relocation camps")....
U.S. troops must remain in the area, enlarging the "scorched
earth" zone. They know that the Vietcong will rebuild the razed
homes when they leave, make new earthenware pots and breed
new chickens.
