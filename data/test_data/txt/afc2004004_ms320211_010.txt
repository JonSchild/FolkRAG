AL ROSE    -9

LOMAX          And I, I think you, you made the
point once before that everybody would, in a sense was
musical.  I mean. . . .

ROSE             Yeah.  It was just taken for
granted that everybody could play.  And it was considered
that, if you said that, if, if you, if somebody asked you
what you played and you said you didn't play anything nobody
really believed you.    [LAUGHS]   I think I told you yesterday
that when two little kids, two little white girls, like 8 or 
9 years old would meet each other for the first time, one
having just moved into the neighborhood, the first question
that would pass between was do you play left hand or right?
Because everybody had a piano and, and the kids at that age
used to . . .

LOMAX          I see.

ROSE             . . .play together on the piano.  
[LAUGHS]

LOMAX           [LAUGHS   And it was, it was an
instrumental rather than a singing. . . .

ROSE              Oh yes.  I, I'm, I'm not aware of
very much singing that went on here.  I did hear a certain
amount of singing.

LOMAX          Of course there were these, these
street songs that you've told, that we've, we've mentioned
before.

ROSE             Obscene songs.

LOMAX          Yeah.
