in London that they can go ahead. In my view, the more authentic

advice.

With kindest regards,

Yours sincerely,
Felix Greene.

P.S.  In regard to my question about the further use of some of
your material in London (taken from the records which I made)
I wonder whether you would be kind enough to let me have an answer
by telegram collect, as my people in London are very anxious to get
a decision on this as soon as possible.
