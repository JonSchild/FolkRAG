TAPE: R-4 cont. Appalachia 13
Caz: It's the liquor was the devil's instrument.
AL: That was the devil's stuff. It wasn't the music. Music went
with it, but the music made you feel like having a drink, didn't it
Caz: The devil was working on you, the liquor was.....
AL: Ray, tell us some more about your banjo.
Ray: .......Like I say, I was about 18 year old when I got my 
first banjo. I never could afford one, but I'd always loved one,
and when I got one I learned on it pretty rapidly, Alan. I drove
everybody crazy, picking.....We're going right back to my drinking
days. I was all over Harlan county, Kentucky drunk, and the 
only thing that kept me a living was I picked the banjo. They
loved me. I done and said things in alot of those rough places,
you know, that an ordinary man'd have got his head blowed off.
But they looked over me on account of the music and I survived.
When I sobered up, I found out that there's a sort of demand for
me now. I started booking bluegrass festivals. I found out I
could make money at it and I quit everything else all together,
just started doing it full time for a living. Music, I think, is
a gift from God, and I'm proud to be a mountain man, and I'm proud
to be a banjo picker. I don't care what you say about it.
AL: Let's hear a tune, come on.
Ray: Now this banjo here, Alan, this is a V. Gibson. They're
master tone banjos....But this come out in 1918, before master
tone was ever thought of. I swapped an old man in Buckeye Cove
