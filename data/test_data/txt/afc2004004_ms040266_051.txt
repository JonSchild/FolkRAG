These are all tiny, rather out of the way
places - not easy to find & small halls -
However there they are, if you are good
with a map and the dates suit you better.
I have given Mr. Legg, their stage
manager, your address in case there is any
hitch in the programme.
He will annoy you by sitting on a chair in
the centre of the stage pretending to read
the script, and holding forth afterwards
about himself - however he is an invalid
& it is his great thrill in life -
Best wishes - Yours sincerely Marjorie E. Mayne
