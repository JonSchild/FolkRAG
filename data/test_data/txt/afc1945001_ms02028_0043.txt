A Good Patriot Will 
Nail Those Rumors! 

By Priscilla Wayne.
This Column Is About Rumor. 

DID you ever notice that most rumors are pretty ugly 
things? Personally I think the very word rumor has a 
nasty sound. Just for fun I'm going to look up in the 
dictionary. O.k., I did. Webster gives three explanations 
for the word rumor and, incidentally, spells it two ways--- 
rumor and rumour. 

He doesn't say whether one 
way of spelling rumor makes it 
nastier than the other. I guess 
they're both just about as bad. 

Here are his three explanations 
of the word. First, "A 
prolonged, indistinct noise." 
(Ha, ha, isn't that  good 
one?) His second explanation, 
"A popular report, common 
talk, notoriety, reputation." 
And three, "A story 
current without known authority 
for its truth---often 
personified." 

Well, now doesn't that make 
my point? 

Let's discuss some of the rumors 
current today - wicked, 
mean, abominable rumors that 
take the heart out of courageous 
people. Here are some rumors 
that have come to my desk lately:

First, there is the rumor 
that soldiers are dying "like 
flies" in camp. I heard that 
rumor in a fine Des Moines 
restaurant. 

A good looking woman was 
telling it to a group. She said, 
and I quote, "They say that soldiers 
are dying by the hundreds 
in every camp because of some 
mysterious disease. They won't 
give out the particulars to the 
public." 

Now that is a very brutal, 
very vicious type of rumor. 
The good looking woman who 
spread it didn't know that her 
remark was actually traitorous 
and that Adolf Hitler 
and his propaganda machine 
would have delighted to have 
such whisperings going on. 

The reason he'd like it is because 
that such rumors make 
mothers and wives and sweethearts 
of soldiers frantic. Their 
letters are apt to be filled with 
woe and discouragement. 

And let me tell you that woe 
and discouragement in a letter 
from the homefolks isn't any 
morale builder for a soldier far 
from his home. Besides, there 
isn't any truth to this vicious 
rumor - not even the slightest 
sign of truth. 

As a matter of fact soldiers in 
the camps are much safer 
than the same number of men in 
civilian life. 

The death rate has actually 
been proved lower in the 
training armies than in civilian 
life. Reason for it? Because 
our soldiers have the best 
food, the best sleeping equipment 
and the best medical 
and dental help obtainable. 

They are taken into the army 
soft and flabby. Thirteen weeks 
after their most basic training started 
most of them are much stronger, 
much more physically fit 
than when they entered. They 
are tough, well conditioned, well 
nourished and well disciplined. 

Here's another rumor that has 
reached my desk recently. It 
has been going the rounds from 
ear to ear. This rumor is that 
an Iowa soldier with a German 
name was shot the other day at 
sunrise by the military commanders 
of his post because he was 
absent without leave and 
was known to have attended a 
party given by people with a 
German name, which was attended 
only by people with other 
German names. 

Now isn't that a laugh? 
When the records of the seven 
saboteurs, their military trial, 
the appeal to the supreme 
court and all of the safeguards 
of justice in their behalf have 
been spread all over every paper 
in the United States how 
very wicked that a whispering 
rumor campaign such as the 
one I've just described could 
be instituted. 

It is every bit as absurd as it 
sounds. There are very many 
loyal soldiers in our armies with 
good, decent German names and 
they and their parents are serving 
Uncle Sam, and proud of it. 

Incidentally this rumor was 
tracked down. The authorities 
got no further than "they 
said." No person yet has 
reared his head who knew the 
name of the soldier allegedly 
shot, nor the names of his 
people, nor the names of his 
army outfit, NOR EVEN 
THE NAME OF ANY PERSON 
WHO HAD REPEATED 
THE RUMOR TO THEM! So 
what do you know about 
that? 

If you are patriotic you will 
nail a rumor the minute you 
hear it. Ask these questions---
Who said that? What is the 
name of the person concerned? 
What is your name and address? 
Where do you live? And, of 
course you are willing to be 
quoted? 

Having got that far with the 
rumor the next step of a loyal 
patriotic citizen is to go straight 
to the office of the federal bureau 
of investigation and say 
bluntly, "So and so who lives at 
such a street told me this. She 
got it from so and so who lives 
at such and such a place," and 
so on. 

A good patriotic exercise right 
now is nailing rumors. 

FALSE RUMOR 
OF INDUCTEE'S 
DEATH SPREAD 

8-9

Grahl Calls Report 
Form of Sabotage. 

A false rumor that an Oskaloosa, 
Ia., young man fell dead 
at Camp Dodge, where he was 
inducted into the army Saturday, 
was started at Oskaloosa 
during the day. 

Adjt. Gen. Charles Grahl, after 
determining that the rumor was 
false, said he regarded it as a 
form of sabotage and was starting 
an investigation. 

The rumor concerned John 
Spurgin, 25, son of A. C. Spurgin, 
a member of the Kemble Floral 
Co. firm at Okaloosa. 

At Filling Station. 

As far as the erroneous report 
of his death could be traced immediately, 
someone overheard it 
at a filling station. This person 
then went to the floral company a
nd asked a woman employe 
there if it were true. 

The employee said nothing 
to the boy's father about 
the report but talked to I. 
A Garland, a member of 
the Oskaloosa selective service 
board. Garland telephoned 
Grahl's office in Des 
Moines and soon was informed 
that the rumor was 
false. 

Young Spurgin was reached on 
the telephone at Camp Dodge and 
reported in person that he was 
alive and well. 

"I'm the livest man anyone 
ever saw," he was quoted as 
saying. 

The floral company employe 
said she did not go to Spurgin's 
father with the rumor because of 
the shock it would be to him. His 
wife was killed in an accident in 
Chicago, Ill., this year. 

Instigator Sought. 

General Grahl said people should 
discount rumors of that kind, and 
should check with proper authorities. 
He said officers are trying 
to find out who started the report.

"This incident," Grahl said "is 
similar to reports such as that 
boys in foreign service have been 
shot as spies, that men are dying 
like flies in epidemics, and that 
men commit suicide because of 
harsh treatment. 

"It is a form of sabotage 
that should be pinned 
down."
