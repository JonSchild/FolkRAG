-3- Professor John A. Lomax June 7, 1942

organizer of the Los Angeles Back Roosevelt Movement, a
purely patriotic affair organized to club Congress into
passing legislation desired by President Roosevelt in the
early days of his first administration. I think we invented
the idea of chain telegrams to Congressmen, once causing
a Senator to change his vote, and rating an AP dispatch
on that subject. In the last campaign, I reorganized
this activity and we went to town for Mr. Roosevelt.
All of my work in this instance was entirely patriotic,
as I have never asked for a political favor of the
administration. Both Mr. Flynn and Mr. Farley were well
cognizant of the work we did, but they are not as close
to the President as Mr. McAdoo would have been if he
hadn't turned up his toes and died at the wrong time.

    I told Alan in Washington to tell Mr. Roosevelt
that if he would put me in his Army, I'D give him the real
words to his reputedly favorite backwoods number.

    Sincerely yours,
    John B Jones

don't know any high Marine
authority do you?
