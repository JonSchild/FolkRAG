Mr. Alan Lomax
c/o Dr. Stith Thompson
Atwater Avenue
Bloomington, Indiana.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Mr. Lockridge has written you briefly about some of the material on folklore in the State office and about certain persons for you to contact. 

We have a very large file of songs, a few with the music scores attached, under the following headings:
Dance, Party games
Jingles, Mountain Music
Romance
Religious
Racial
Sad and mournful
School songs
Roundelays
Statehood
Campaign songs, etc.
Special locations
Corydon
Cannelton Jail
Canal, etc.

If you are coming to Indianapolis we believe you should take a short time to check over what we have. Some of it we are sure is worthless, but some of it may be very valuable.

We also believe that we can arrange for Hungarian, Slovanian, and Rumanian folk songs to be recorded. If you will let us know about the time that you will be here we shall be happy to do all we can to assist you in getting records of folk music in Indianapolis. We probably will be able to find additional opportunities for you when you come.

Very truly yours,
William A. Myers
