Reverend Roe. Reel 16. P. 5
had a nice farm, and his wife, she didn't work, and they come after
her to make her go and wash for one of em white men, and she wouldn't
go, and, well, they tried ot make her go, and she reared up and went
to fighting. And he was way down in his field, and he was -- a wood-
carrying wood between the house and down there where he was plowing.
And they took his wife and mobbed her, hung her up. And then one
went down there after him and told him, "come up there and help take
her carcass? down." And hecwent, see who it was, and he got there,
saw it was his wife. And he told them to let him go to the house
to get a sheet to wrap his wife up in. And they let him go. And he
went down to the house and got him a Winchester and wrapped it up
in the sheet and got back close enough to em, he just fell on the 
ground and went to shooting. And I think he killed seven men, seven
men he killed. But he didn't even get to burying hs wife. They don't
know what become of him: whether they caught him and killed, or whether
he just got away, or what. Because they never did know nothing, they
never did told nothing.
There was another whiteman down there that got a cookin woman, he got
her in (                  ?) - way, and his wife, she raised up about it,
you know, and raised a lot of Cain, was going crazy, and he went and
got one or two of his borthers, and they went down there and cut that
woman and killed her. And they say he cut her open, cut that child
out of her and stopped it.
A: Isxthat really true, do you think?
R: That's what everybody said. And he killed the woman, and they
buried her.
A: It's just almost impossible.
R: It don't look it be possible for a man to do that.
A: How do you suppose people grew up to be that way?
R: They just get to the place, and they do anything to keep in good
