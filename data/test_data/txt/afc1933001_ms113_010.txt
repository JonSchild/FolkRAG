Dear Bess:

I thought you knew about the albums which have 
advanced beyong the rumor stage into test pressings.  
The catalog and leaflets are in preparation.  The 
titles of the albums, each containing five records, 
are as follows:

Album VII      Anglo-American Ballads
   "        VIII     Negro Work Songs and Calls
   "          IX     Play and Dance Songs and Tunes
   "           X     Negro Religious Songs and Services
   "          XI     Sacred Harp Singing.  Edited by George
                                                              Pullen Jackson

These are scheduled for release early in 1944 but 
the pressings may be ready earlier.  We assume that the 
prices will be the same as last year.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,
