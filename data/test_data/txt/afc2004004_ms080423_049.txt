all the best in the country
                        
AL:   And that means the best in the United States.
                        
Man:   That's right.
                        
AL:   It started here, didn't it.
                        
Man:   Yessir.   I would say Carroll is the best male dancer
and best leading man, and there's the best leading lady I've
ever seen.    (Unintellible, laughter).
                        
Man 2:   It's just a thrill when you get out there and you
know you're performing for people. What makes you feel good
is when you can perform for someone that act like they enjoy
it.   You go somewhere and dance and they set and they stare
andthey don't pay no attention to you, why, you don't feel
so good.   But when you go and put on a show for people and
they get up and clap their hands, act like they're a part
of it, that's what makes you feel like you've really done
something.
                        
AL:   Have you been practicing and dancing for a long time?
                        
Man 2:   Well, I've danced about all my life, not on a team,
but we started with  Rook and them oh, I guess, fifteen
years ago was the first time I danced on a team, but I've 
danced about all my life.
                      
AL:   As I understand it it all goes back to Bascomb  (?)
folk festival, is that right, and he got people in competition
and it went on from there.

People agree.

Man:   Well, back in the old days, we used to go to his house
on Turkey Creek, that's across . . . .
