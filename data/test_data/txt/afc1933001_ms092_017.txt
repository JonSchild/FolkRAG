Dear Mr Lomax

I have read the detailed statement from
Mr Putnam to you dated January 28 1942, to which you referred me
in your recent letter of March 12.

MacMillan's decision to cancel the remaining
text alteration charges ($55)

"in view of your cooperation in accepting a 10% royalty on the
first 4000 copies instead of on the first 2500, as originally
arranged."

seems entirely fair as far as it goes. But since I have in effect
cooperated to exactly the same extent as you, I fail to see why I
should have to pay author's corrections when you do not. The
distinction seems to me a fictitious one, and amounts to forcing me
to pay the total charge for author's alterations (text and music)
for which MacMillan chooses to ask payment. Mr Putnam admits this
when he says, in the last sentence of the statement:

"I am raising the point again, as she and Alan may well confer
and she will then discover (sic) that he is not being charged 
for the corrections in the text."

This sentence appears to me to constitute
a suggestion that you join Mr Putnam in a virtual conspiracy against
my interests. I feel sure you will agree with me that there is only
one answer for you to make to Mr Putnam, namely, to refuse to have
anything to do with such proposal.

As I said in my last letter, I still think
it impertinent that MacMillan ask payment of these music charges.
If, however, they do not see fit to cancel them, they must of course
be paid, and I shall be glad to pay my third of the $50.91 ($16.97) --
or even, if you prefer, a half ($25.46). The Seeger family cannot,
however, make payments of even such comparatively small amounts without 
budgeting well in advance; I should have to ask time in which to
accumulate either of the above amounts.

Faithfully
