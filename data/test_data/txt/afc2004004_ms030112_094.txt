Well you see I didn't waste any money. I worked and saved the money. Cause you see you have to have a good down payment and then you got to make your payments on your mortgage each month. And a friend of mine come by, Sister Artis came by and got him off and I don't know why it made me say it, I remember saying it I don't know why. So I say did B. Davis come in with you. You know I tell you it don't seem like he's dead. Seems like he just gone. So my sister, I remember, Is B. Davis coming he coming from Church. I said to her is B.
