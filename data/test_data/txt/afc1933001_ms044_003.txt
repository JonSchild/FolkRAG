Dear Dr. Lomax:

The Merry-Go-Round column of the newspapers
carries the information that you are supervising a
WPA project to record folk songs of negroes.

I would like to suggest that you include in
your project, or frame another to include, the Mexican
corridos prevalent in the United States. As a starter
you might go to Eusebio Gonzalez of Falfurrias, Texas,
who goes to Corpus Christi when the cotton harvest is
ripe. He writes corridos, sells the printed sheets, and
sings on the street corners.

Sincerely yours,
Paul S. Taylor
Associate Professor of Economics
