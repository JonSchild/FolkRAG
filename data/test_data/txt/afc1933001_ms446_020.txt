A PROGRAM OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTS

In the summer of 1938 representatives of the British Broadcasting
company visited the Archive of American Folk Song and transcribed some forty
of the Archive's field recordings. These transcriptions served as the
materials for several series of broadcasts on American folk music inter-
spersed with appropriate commentary. The Library can now make its own tran-
scribed broadcasts of folk music for distribution to local colleges, public
schools, radio stations and the like. Utilization of folk song, however,
represents only one field of activity. It is foreseen that the Library of
Congress will originate educational programs and make radio transcriptions
that will draw from all its resources - from the Division of Rare Books, the
Division of Manuscripts, the Map Division, the Division of Public Documents,
the Aeronautics Division, the Law Library and the like. These radio broad-
casts and transcriptions will create channels through which the Library's
buried treasures of art and knowledge can be brought directly to the people
to whom they belong.
