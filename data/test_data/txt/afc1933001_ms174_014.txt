Dear Alan:

Postscript to yesterday's letter. Have
one of your slaves get you the periodical
Common Ground that I mentioned yesterday --
the number marked Summer, 1941 -- and read the
article on p. 114, called "Music and Unity."
Maybe International Music Relations Committee
of National Federation of Music Clubs could
be interested to do something about your
project.

Sincerely yours,
JCC
