ST. FRANCIS BOTTOM

Way down in old St. Francis Bottom,
Where they call it the devil's den,
Many a poor tenant has lost their home,
And me, Oh God, I'm one!

About the 20th of January
When God sent a great big flood,
It run the planters from their beautiful homes,
And now they live in tents.

The planter said to the tenant one morning,
"Oh boys, how do you like this?"
"Oh boss, it ain't a hurting me,"
The tenant answered him.

"If you will stay in refugee camps
Er in some tenant's home,
You'll learn not to be a-feard of ice
Er fear the shining sun."

"Oh boss, you see where you done wrong
When you throwed me out of my shack.
I had to build me a tent
Out of my ole pick sacks."

++ Okay, you high flyin' philosophers, let's see you outfly
that first verse, And me, Oh God, I'm One!

Dear friend, they aint got enough pick sacks to go around,
I seen 300[0] families stranded in one spot between two hills in
and around  Redding, California, when I bummed through there.

share croppers daughter who came from
there.
