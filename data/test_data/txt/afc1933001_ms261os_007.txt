The plans of the Library of Congress to bring together in
one place and make available for students American folk songs,
seems to me highly meritorious. The object should be accomplished
in a reasonable time by following some such plan as these
provisional suggestions:

(1). Means should be provided for more than one recording
group to go into the field with proper equipment, under
the direction of a single agency and following some general
method of procedure.

(2). Where other agencies do authoritative and active
work the Library of Congress should manifest a generous attitude
of cooperation and arrange for the exchange of material.

(3). The collecting work should go forward now, for folk
songs do tend to disappear with the changing fabric of the society
wherein the songs have their origin. Steamboats have only 
recently disappeared from the Mississippi River. Gone as definitely
are the roundabout songs of the black steamboat laborer.
Only the merest scraps of these stirring songs are known by
negro ballad singers along the Mississippi River.

(4). The main objective of this project should be held
constantly in mind: To put on permanent records the music of
American Folk-Songs as sung in their native environment by
untrained singers; and to make these musical records available
to students of music.

Many people have aided us in carrying forward this work.
Without the Carnegie Corporation, The Rockefeller Foundation,
and Council of Learned Societies, little could have been done.
