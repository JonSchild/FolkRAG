(laughs) You want to hear that?
Kennedy: That's good.
D. Kennedy: Very good. . .
Kennedy: I've never heard - I don't think I've ever heard that before
Cox: (laughs) That's long.
D. Kennedy: Does it go on?
Cox: Yes.
D. Kennedy: You can remember it?
Cox: Yes.
Kennedy: The Rainbow?
Cox: (laughs)

(pause)
We had not sailed three leagues or more
Before we spied ten men o' war,
Before we spied ten men o' war,
An' unto us they did huzzaw.

"Come strike, come strike, you English dog,
Come strike your topsail down by speed."
"If you have a mind for to have them strike,
Come you on board, strike them for me."

Then he called up his merry men all,
Sayin', "Get you ready an' obey my call.
Get your firelocks ready an' fix them well.
An' throw in plenty of bombshell."

Then he called up his cabin boy
And sent him up aloft so high,
And there let fly King George's flag
An' under that we'll fight or die.
