ASH GROVE
Nov 25, 1963

Dear Bessie,
Please forgive me for not writing you before this.  I just returned from
New York last thursday, the day before President Kennedy was killed.  It's
now Monday, and I guess I'm writing because I just can't stand to listen
to the radio right now.  It's very hard to say anything right now except
that his death is a great loss to all of us.  Hate and violence gained a 
terrible victory, but we must only take from this the lesson of working
just that much harder for love among all mankind, and peace throughout
the world.  I guess this is the main reason behind the music that you sing.
I don't think I've ever seen people as together or as full of love and joy
as when they sing or dance together, or watch a group such as the Georgia
Sea Islanders.  I thank you for bringing this to me and others.
I want the group out here for the festival and an engagement at the Ash
Grove.  The festival is at Easter time.  I'll figure everything out
and write you all the details, just as soon as I can get back to work.
I spoke about everything to Alan Lomax when I was in New York, and he is
also very pleased about everything.  I really hope that he can make it out
to the festival, but he says he will simply have to wait and see, because
he has so much work.
On my way back, I stopped at the Retort, in Detroit, to give Peter a hand
for a couple of days.  He sends his love to you all.  Guy Carawan was 
performing there at the time, and he also says hello.  He told me about the
wonderful festival down there, and it really sounds exciting to me.
There's so much music to bring out into the light of day and this festival
should do more than almost anything else I could think of.  I'm going to
try to come to it next year.
Everybody here at the Ash Grove sends their love to you and John and Henry
and Emma and Mabel.  So do I.
