Brady and Duncan (Continued)
Brady fell down on the barroom floor;
Cried, "Please, Mr. Duncan, don't you shoot no more!"
The women cried, "Oh, ain't it a shame,
He's shot King Brady - gonna shoot him again!"
[Duncan said,] Brady, don't you know you done gone wrong,
Coming in my grocery when my game was going on,
Sprung my lock and you broke my bolt,
Now you're laying dead on my grocery floor."
Momma, give me any hat,"
No, my child, I can't do that,
Wrap this shawl around up yo head,
Co an' see if yo' papa is dead.
Mrs. Brady was at home in bed,
When she got the telegram [that] Brady was dead.
[Cried] "Chillun, chillun, put yore hats on yore head,
And lets go [go down an'] see if old King Brady is dead.
"Brady, Brady, why didn't you run? 
When you saw that Duncan had a forty-four gun?
Oh, Brady, Brady, Brady, you should oughter have run;
You hadn't oughter faced that [great big] Gatling gun!
His wife came in a mightly flirt,
Wiped up the blood with her underskirt,
"Hush, my children, and don't you cry,
We'll all draw a pension when your daddy die."
Brady, don't you know you done wrong
To come in my house when my game was going on, 
I told you half a dozen times before,
And now you lie dead on my barroom floor."
Brady went to hell lookin' mighty curious,
[The devil says] "Where you from?" East St. Louis?
"Well pull off your coast and step this way,
For I've been expecting you everyday!"
When the [girls] women all heard that King Brady was dead,
They went up home and put on red,
And came down home, singin this song - 
"Brady's struttin' in hell with his Stetson on!
[Brady where you at
Struttin in hell with his Stetson hat!]
