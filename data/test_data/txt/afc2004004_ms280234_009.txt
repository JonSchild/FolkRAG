She Moves Through the Fair:
1) My young love said to me my mother won't mind,
And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind.
Then she stepped away from me, and this she did say,
It will not be long. love, till our wedding day.

2) She stepped away from me and she went through he fair,
And fondly I watched her move here and move there,
And then she went homewards with one star awake,
As the swan in the evening moves over the lake.

3) And the people were saying that no two were ere wed,
But one had a sorrow that never was said,
And she smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear,
And that was the last that I saw of my dear.

4) Last night she came to me, she came softly in,
So softly she came that her feet made no din;
She laid her hands on me, and this she did say,
It will not be long, love, till our wedding day.

My Lagan Love:
1) Where Lagan stream sings lullabye,
There blooms a lily there;
The twilight gleam is in her eye,
The night is on her hair.
And like a love-sick lenanshee,
She hath my heart enthralled,
No life I own, nor liberty, for love is lord of all.

2) And often when the bettles horns
Hath lulled the eve to sleep,
I steal unto her
And through the door in peep.
Thereon the cricket-singing stone,
She stirs the bogwood fire,
And hums in sad, sweet undertones,
The song of heart's desire.
