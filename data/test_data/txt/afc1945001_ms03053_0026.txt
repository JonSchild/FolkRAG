             If you should desire an additional rumor collector, whom I consider 
the best qualified man in the state to assist in an over-all rumor survey of 
this type, I would suggest Mr. F. L. Jensen, publisher of "The Searchlight", an 
independent publication devoted to "clean Government", 172 T Street, Salt Lake 
City.

             Mr. Jensen probably has more contacts and access to more information 
than any man in the state, and he would be invaluable in this project. He 
derives his entire livelihood from the subscriptions to his publication. He is 
respected for his ability to gain the confidence of political, labor, business 
and agricultural officials and has a great many contacts among the rank and file. 
I am attaching a current issue of his publication, with the advice that his 
editorial policy is respected and feared for the fact that Jensen, like 
Sangberg's "Chicago", is "as independent as a hog on ice." In the opinion of 
many, Jensen knows everybody and hears everything. If properly approached, I 
think you would find Mr. Jensen highly capable and willing to serve.
