Night had fallen before we had seen half the mementos that festooned 
the walls of the room. [Just before the Senator dropped me at a hotel in
Abilene]  I asked [him] the Senator to give some of the cowboy rhymed dance calls.  He patted 
his foot and chanted:

"All join hands and circle eight,
Knock down Sal and pick up Kate."

You take Sal and I'll take Sue,
Mighty little difference between them two."

"On to the next, don't be slow,
Make that wooden leg jar the flo' ".

"Hole in the haystack, chicken fell through,
Can't get fat girl, Skinny girl'll do".

"Come on boys, let me tell you somethin',
Little bit of chicken makes a whole lot of dumplin'".

"Rained all night, the road got muddy;
Hugged Sallie Gooden till couldn't stand studdy."

You take Sal and I'll take Jane
They're each good lookin' but they 
ain't the same.
