[If the music written out in this book seems a little queer,]

I sometimes wonder why I wrote out the music for the songs
in this book, because, for the most part the folks that will
like the songs best will be folks that can't read a note. But
don't be bashful; just slam away at the old tune best's you can,
and if you don't hit the right note - why, who's to say that the
one you did hit ain't as good as the one wrote down?

Good many of the melodies were transcribed right down from
vict[r]rola records. some of them commercial records, some of them in the archives of Am. Folksongs in the Library of Congress; some were written down by others; some which were incomplete or weren't there at all, Wood and me just made
em up as best we could. Most of the tunes are straight old
american folksongs, as pure as they come, and some are modern popular songs. You'll notice that most folks, when they want to
make up a union song, use old familiar songs, whole cloth, or
pieced together or twisted around to put their new words to.

By way of explanation: You'll notice I didn't write out any
sort of piano part. Partly 'cause I didn't know how to never having taken any regular music lesson, partly because a
lot of folks haven't got pianos to play on even if it was written so it sounded good. Also, it would take up to much space. But up above the notes [I] there's some tricky
little diagrams, which I'll now take time out to explain:

The black spots are where you put your finger

a) This here is the fingering for
a guitar, if you want to chord
along on it. The top 4 strings fit a uke.
b) This means you play in D major, and
if you are playing chords on any
other instrument, you follow this 1
letter to the right of the diagram.
c) This here means you play a [G]A chord
with an extra note - the [4]7th in the
[C][D]A minor scale - stuck into it.
d) These are the notes you sing, if yo
can read them.
e) General instructions: loud enough
so the fellow next door can hear you.

These marks means
keep on playing the
same chord + when you don't see 'em, stop.
