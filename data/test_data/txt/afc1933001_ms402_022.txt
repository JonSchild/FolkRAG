NEGRO SPIRITUALS

My Jesus lowered his mercy down,
My sins went a lumberin' down to Hell.
Till I meet dem angels in a de sky,
An a golden crown placed  on my head,
An a long white robe come a-dazzlin' down.

Now wait till I put on my gospel shoe,
Gwine to walk about Heaven on the news.
When I gets to Heaven, gwine to take my stand,
Gwine to rassle with my Lord like a nachul man.

[[Margin:]] Recorded
Two milk white hosses side by side,
Me and my Jesus gwine take an evenin' ride.
I argued wid the Father and chattered wid de Son,
Talked about the old world I done come from.

Georgia     What is the Soul of Men?
[[Margin:]] Recorded
I saw two standin' and talkin'
I jest step up in time
I thought I heard 'em say
The soul ain't nothin' but the mind.
***
The "sonnick" measured the distance to the sun
and the distance to the moon
If you ever figure out the soul of a man
You better go to figgerin' soon.
***
A hypocrite and a liar
They both keep up a fuss
They're both very bad
But the liar is wuss.
   --Georgia Negro
***
When I was a sinner,
I sinned both night and day,
But now I am a Christian
I shout myself away.
Don't let nobody turn you round
Jest keep on to calvary. -- Georgia Negro

John Solman
How he caught a wolf.
Throwed at him two or three times. Caught him by one foot and 
one of his wethers. His fur wasn't too good.
