next fourth of July and see the three show put on by Will and 
Otto Swenson.

Before taking a real dip into this entertaining volume I
wish to register a mild complaint. As I read the next to the last
paragraph of the first chapter on page eight, I came to this 
passage:

"Taken all in the all there was an Homeric quality about the
cowboy's profanity and vulgarity that pleased rather than
repulsed, but which polite society is not quite willing to
hear. The broad sky under which he slept, the limitless
plains over which he rode, the big, open, free life he lived
near to Nature's breast taught him simplicity and directness.
He spoke out plainly the impulses of his heart."

By a strange and to me unexplainable coincidence I, one day
in the summer of 1909, while seated in front of Roy Bedichek's
shack four or five miles out on the flat from [Duming] Deming, New Mexico,
wrote a somewhat similar paragraph for the Introduction to
"Cowboy Songs". I printed it the following year. What I wrote
runs as follows:

"There is, however, a Homeric quality about the cowboy's
profanity and vulgarity that pleases rather than repulses. 
The broad sky under which he slept, the limitless plains 
over which he rode, the big, open, free life he lived near 
to Nature's breast taught him simplicity, calm, directness.
He spoke out plainly the impulses of his heart. But as yet
polite society is not quite willing to hear."

Mr. Adams used sixty-nine [seconds] words to get his ideas across.
I beat him by using only sixty-eight. But twenty-six years after
I printed the paragraph he comes along and writes a paragraph
idealizing the cowboy as a cusser and uses sixty-five of the sixty-eight
words that I found useful in trying to paint the same picture
