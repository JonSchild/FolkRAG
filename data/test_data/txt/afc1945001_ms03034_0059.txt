Enemy Action -- secret weapons or plans

California -- The Japanese have been releasing poisons and
germs from planes (releasing fleas infected with typhus, etc.)

Florida -- The Germans have invented a new sort of poison to
be put in reservoirs. It will cause huge boils to appear
and is fatal in many cases.

This is a small but persistent category with no
pronounced regional distinction.

Enemy Action -- shipping losses

Florida -- Our forces are losing 50% of all troop transports,
but the government is keeping it secret.

Massachusetts -- 50% of the ships sent from U.S. to Russia
are sunk.

These stories circulate in costal areas.

Enemy Action -- unrevealed enemy activities

New Jersey -- on December 8, seven enemy planes (out of seven)
were shot down over Mitchell Field.

New York -- An aunt reports that she was shelled while
visiting the Maine coast. (same story about Long Island.)

These are high along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts,
while comparatively absent in the south and middle west.

PIPEDREAM RUMORS

Pipedream rumors are wish motivated and optimistic.
Since people were asked to send in only morale-destroying
rumors, the percentage of this type considered in our report
is very small. They are probably more frequent than our
figures would indicate. During May, 14% of the rumors
collected in Massachusetts were of this type.

Peace rumor

Massachusetts -- Lloyd's of London is betting that the war
will be over by January, 1943.

Corpse in Car

Wisconsin -- A man picked up a woman hitch-hiker. Arriving
at her destination she offered to pay for the gas, and when
he refused, she offered to tell his fortune. He asked,
"When will the war end?" and she replied, "Five months after
you find a corpse in your car." Later the driver picked up
and injured man who died in his car on the way to the hospital.
