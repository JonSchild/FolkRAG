the mornin'.  An' ah, I didn' wanna be bothered with 'em.  Boys
an' girls, ya know.  They was laugh' an' talk' with Mama an'
them on the porch.  Well, my mother was very young.  I 'member
when she was 17, ya know.  See, she was young, young like I was
with my daughter, ya see?  An' so, they was young peoples come
to all laugh an' talk.  I didn' wanna be bothered with 'em.  I
wa'n' nothin' but a chil', ya know.  But I yet didn' wanna be
bother with 'em.
     I went down an' laid down.  An' Leola, she missed me.  An'
she told Mama, she said, "We oughta stop her from goin' off in
the fiel' an' layin' down, 'cause," says, "A snake, a snake'll
bite 'er.  Well, or something, ya know?  She might git scared
of a snake or something."  So Leola come out to see where I was.
An' she looked over the hill.  I was on that next lil' dam, right
in the lil' road, asleep.
     Leola come on down there.  An' jus' as she was comin' this
way -- I was sleepin' but I could 'waken.--I heard a noise this
way, behind me, but I didn't hear her, ya see?  An' so I heard
this noise an' I figured somebody (or other ?) might be walkin'
(the dam ?) an' I better raise up.  And I moved my feet. An' when
I moved my feet, then I heard a big hit, a "Wham!"  That was
Leola.  She done got near to me an' these two black snakes was
comin' up there to me, ya see?
     You know, I was, an' they, oh, Lawd!  That waas I heard,
ya see?  An' she chunked to make 'em run.  'Cause she see me
wakin' up.  An' then -- One of 'em, ya know, stood up on his
tail.  He whistled, ya know?  Boy, he was, he was, boy, he was
tough!  But I ah, I only see 'em when I stand up.  I looked
back an' see 'em.  She say, "Don't look!  Don't look!"
