5) And after we have reaped it of every sheaf, 
And have gathered up every ear, 
With a drop of good beer, boys, our hearts full of cheer, 
We will wish them another good year. 

6) Our barns they are full, our fields they are clear, 
Good health to our master and friends, 
We will make no more to do, but will plough and we'll sow, 
And provide for the very next year.

The Man Who First Created Love: 

1) Come write me down, ye powers above 
The man that first created love, 
For I've a diamond in my eye 
Where all my joys and comforts lie. (2) 

2) I will give you gold, I will give you pearl, 
If you can fancy me dear girl. 
Rich costly robes that you shall wear, 
If you can fancy me dear girl. (2) 

3) It's not your gold shall me entice, 
To leave all pleasures to be a wife, 
For I don't mean or intend at all 
To be at any young man's call. (2) 

4) Then go your way, you scornful dame, 
Since you've poved false, I will prove the same, 
For I don't care, but I shall find 
Some other fair maid to my mind. 

5) O stay young man, don't be in haste, 
You seem afraid your time you'll waste, 
Let reason rule your roving mind 
And unto you I will prove kind. 

6) So to church they went that very next day 
And we married by [large empty space] as I've heard say, 
So now that girl she is his wife 
She will peove his comforts day and night. 

7) So now his trouble and sorrow is past 
There's joy and comfort has come at last, 
That girl to him always said nay 
She will prove his comforts night and day.
