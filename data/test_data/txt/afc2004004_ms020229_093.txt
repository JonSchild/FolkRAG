gonna do next minute.  Don't know wheth' ya gonna have a fit or
wheth' ya gonna fall out an' die.  You don't know nothin'.  It's
just up to God, see?
     But you believe yourself, see?  That's the on'y way you see
Jesus.  Believe it.  Ya ain't, hah, gonna git a chance to see
'Im 'till you go up there!  Until you do come to believe an' then
