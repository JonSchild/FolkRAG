"Did you hear what Ab Jenkins (Mayor of Salt Lake City) said on his radio program last night ("The Mayor Reports" - a weekly ad lib program)? The announcer said, 'Now, Mayor, we still have about three minutes. Is there anything else you'd like to comment on?' Ab said, and this is exactly the way he said it, 'Well, no, except I'd like to encourage everybody to buy bonds [*8*] and stamps and to keep buying with all their loose change and savings and every cent they can get their hands on. It will be a lot safer in bonds than wherever they have it now.' And then he said, and get this, 'for if Hitler [*3*] comes over here it won't be any good anyway.' How do you like that? Isn't that a hell of a reason for buying bonds -- because your money won't be any good anyway. Somebody ought to write out that guy's stuff for him before he goes on the air. Hell, if people think their money isn't going to be any good regardless of where they put it, they'll make hay while the sun shines and spend the hell out of it while they can." (Salt Lake Haberdasher).
