An' they were wobblin'. An my daughter, she run to me an' grab
me by my knees, legs, said, "Mama, don't let Cassi kill my rabbits!"
You know I was a scared chile then. I sad "What!" I said, "Nelly,
listen, that what she callin' rabbits, the snakes, what eats..."
An' she was hollerin', screamin', "Don't let Cassius kill my rabbits,
don let..." See, she was about to get the snakes' charm -- the
snake spirit in 'er, you see?

[*snake spirit*]

AL: Well, what do you mean by that, honey?

BJ: Well, they would come to be, you know jus' act at 'em; they
could tend (him?) to 'em, they could do anything with 'em, you know?

AL: Really?

BJ: Yeah! An' then...Good land. That chile had scared me so
bad! I didn't know what to do. An' then it make them sick if you
take them from them. You know, those folks in the show don't be
able to live long, with those snakes, you know, they don't, won't
las' long. Make 'em sick if you take the snake from them; it'll
kill them. You see. Had it been a rattlesnake it would of almost
killed 'em. An' so, yet, I had to send my child away from home
for over a month, so she could rest. All through the night, all
the day, "Cassius kill the rabbit? Cassius kill the rabbit? Rabbit
dead. Rabbit can't eat. Rabbit gone, gone. Rabbit..." Jus'
talkin' to her natchul self. All outdoor. An' that thing hurted me.
I said, "I'm gonna leave this place." An' that day we killed seven
black snakes there. Cassius killed three up there an' -- you see,
they say when you burn them, they say, you can...see 'em. So Ed
killed the rest out there at the woodpile an' the ol' log cabin.
Seven that day! Black snakes, all black. Jus' _______________________
black snakes. They's a den of them there.
[*snake bit*]
An' so, that's what hurt me so bad. She was tellin' me all
the time, "Mama, the rabbit gone; rabbit heard you comin'; rabbit
eat, eat bread, I feed the rabbit..." All like that, you know, an'
I jus' know she meant a rat. Ha, ha.
AL: Looks like it would have bitten her. Snakes bite, you know.
BJ: Huh-huh. No, they don't bite no chilrun. Not that age.
Those black snakes jus' like a rattle snake in a way; they come
on out, they take care them chilrun. But she wasn't nursin', then,
