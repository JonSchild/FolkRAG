3/12

My mother went visiting on
Washington's birthday. In order not
to cause a strain on her hostess
sugar & coffee supply she took the
next stamps. On returning home & consulting
the calendar she found she'd
taken her March stamps & couldn't get
any sugar or coffee for herself until the 
latter part of March.
