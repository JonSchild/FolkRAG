The only copy we seem to have of the song is a printed copy of
the words by the Courier Print, Channing, Texas.
The Last Great Round Up
Dedicated to the Cattlemen of Texas by
C.W.Byron, Sept. 23, '98.
I've been thinking today
As my thoughts began to stray,
Your mem'ry to me's worth more than gold
As you ride upon the plain
'Mid the sunshine and the rain,
You'll be rounded up within the Master's fold.
Chorus
He will round us up in glory by and by,
He will round us up in glory by and by;
When the milling time is o'er
And we stampede no more
We'll be rounded up in glory by and by.

May we lift our voices high,
'Till the sweet by and by
And be known by the brand of God's love,
For His property we are,
And He'll know us from afar
When He rounds us up in glory above.

As we look upon the plain
To the cowboys that have fame
While the storm and light'ning flashes by
We will meet to part no more,
Upon the Golden Shore
As we all round up in glory by and by.
