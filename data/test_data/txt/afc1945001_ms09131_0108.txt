& the Greek who were taking a plane trip. Because of some trouble
the pilot told them that one of them would have to
jump out so the American sang The Star Spangled Banner 
& jumped out. Again the pilot told them that one of them 
would have to jump so the French man sang his national
anthem & jumped. Later on the pilot again told them that
one of them would have to jump so the English man stood
up, sang there will always be an England, and
kicked out the Greek.
