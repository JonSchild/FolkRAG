THE DEATH OF HARRY SIMMS

Workers, listen to my story,
Comrades,listen to my song,
I willtell you of a hero
That now is dead and gone.
I will tell you of a worker
Who'se age was nineteen,
He was the strongest union man
That I have ever seen.

Harry Simms was killed on Brush Creek
In Nineteen Thirty-Two.
He organized the Y.C.L.
Also the N.M.U.
He gave his life in struggle,
That was all that he could do.
He died for the union,
Also for me and you.

Harry Simms and I were parted
At five o'clock that day.
"Be careful, my dear comrade,"
To Harry I did say.
"I must do my duty,"
Was his reply to me,
"If I get killed by gun thugs,
Don't grieve after me."

Harry Simms was a pal of mine,
We labored side by side,
Expecting to be shot on sight,
Or taken for a ride
By the dirty capitalist gun thugs
That roam from town to town
To shoot and kill our comrades
Wherever they may be found.

Harry Simms was walking up the track
This bright sunshiny day.
He was a youth of courage,
His step was light and gay.
He did not know the gun thugs
Were hiding in his way
To kill our dear young comrade
This bright sunshiny day.

Comrades we must vow today,
That is one thing we must do,
We must organize all the miners
In the dear old N.M.U.
And get a million volunteers
