A SONG ABOUT HEROES.  [[title underlined]]

On the steppe meadows
Where Budyoni led us
Into battle forward
Fighting for the Soviet, --
There they rest, the fearless,
Brave October heroes,
Felled by fiendish gunners,
Buried by their comrades.

Refrain:

Oh, not vainly, oh not vainly
For Sickle and Hammer they bled;
In battles doe freedom and justice
The blood of the heroes was shed.

Not a wild-grass growing
Steppe bleak and dreary
Where the winds are blowing
O'er the bones of heroes, --
Peasants in collectives,
Armed with mighty tractors,
Freedom's bliss enjoying,
Wheat and corn are sowing.

Refrain:

Yes, they fell in battle,
But their work continues;
We will staunchly grapple,
With our strength and sinews;
Wit the help of tractors
We will plough and harvest.
Thinking of our heroes,
We will work our hardest.

Refrain:

Village after village
Joins collective farming,
And for peaceful tillage
Our great hosts are arming.
We will feed our country
And protect her borders.
No one shall be hungry
In the land of Soviets.

Refrain:
