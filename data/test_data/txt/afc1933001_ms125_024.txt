Dear Spivacke,

Fuson turned out, as I suspected, quite a unprofitable contact.
His people are all local and no better than other contacts I might
have made on my own hook. Barnicle has just departed. Through her
I was able to get in touch with what might be cautiously termed
the progressives of this part of Kentucky and to learn all there
was to know about the progressive songs of this country. I travel-
ed a good deal and learned the lay of the land and made contacts.
There were various troubles, however, with the machine.  Several
little things, unimportant, but causing delay.  And the batteries
turn out to be a major problem. They are likely to go down a lot
too fast and it is the very devil to rent anything that is any good.
I would suggest, even, that, subject to your best judgment you
might send me a couple of real high capacity batteries.

I have made so far 32 records, some of them quite marvelous,
some of them mediocre, but all necessary, -ballads, local and other-
wise, Baptist hyms, Holiness hymns, blues, sentimental [???]
hill billy stuff, radical songs.  From Smith's point of view I have
made two important discoveries--- one local ballad, never written
down before, and [??] something that appears to be [???]
an English broadside ballad that is not in print so far as I know.

As soon as the machine is fixed up I shall be able to work
much faster than before, I believe.  I have been cumbered with too
many people and too much advice.  On the other hand I have learned things and seen people whom I should never have known existed otherwise.  Would you advise that I move fast and get something out of every county or take my time and do thoroughly what [?] places
I [??]  do visit?
