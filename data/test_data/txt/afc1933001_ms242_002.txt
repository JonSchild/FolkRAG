Dear Alan:

If possible, please decide
definitely at once on the Mrs. Tartt
trip. If you  can reach Mr. Spivacke
without delay and make
this decision, shoot me a machine
and I'll take it out to 
Amarillo and record the "last
reunion of the east Texas cowboys,
those that "rode the range
before 1896." The meeting is
Aug. 28. You could of course
send the machine to meet me
in Amarillo and save a day
or so. But do something quickly
if you want records of
the stories and songs of these
unique men.
