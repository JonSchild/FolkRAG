some syrup an' bread, all of us.  Biscuits, ya know, an' ah, an' 
syrup.  Plen-- ah, an' big -- we, we didn' cook the small slice a 
meat like people do now.  Lil' thin ol' piece a meat, ya see.  We 
cook big slices a meat, ya know, see?  An' ah -- I guess ya 
can jus' natchully look at me an' tell how, oh, I'm a rich eater. 
Huh!  Not a heap o' eater, but a rich eater.  [See wh-] You know what I mean?  
An' ah, an' so, I helped her, you [see,] know what, what I wanted to 
say.  And ah, so, this um, lady, that, that, this very day -- 
Miss, Miss Laura Richardson was her name -- she had given us too 
much syrup, ya know?  She poured too much syrup in the plate.  For
me, especially, 'cause I never liked too much syrup.  I liked a 
little.  If I want any more, I get some mo', 'cause I don' like 
my bread sopped in syrup.  Well, a lot of good syrup...
TL:  They pour it right over on top of the bread?
BJ:  No, jus' pour it in the plate, then put the bread in there, 
ya see.  An' ah, so, she give us too much syrup.  Man, I was so 
aggravated!  I wanted some more bread to eat with the syrup an' 
there all the biscuits was gone.  She say, "You better eat that 
syrup."  Um, Lawd.  "Better not pour it out."  She was one a them 
kind that mad on whuppin' chirruns, ya know.  I know she was.  She 
whup me once, and that ended it.  And ah, but, she never whipped me no 
mo' 'cause if she's livin' today, she got that mark on her.  I 
bit 'er.  A-huh!  A-huh, huh, huh, huh!
     An', but, but anyway, this day I knew how she was.  I 
got behind the stove, a big, ol', rangey stove.  An' I had to 
drink that syrup, you know, 'cause she had too much in the plates.  
I just ah... I like a lil' bit a syrup on my bread.  But her chilren 
liked it goggy an' soft, ya see?  An' she give us all the 
same amount of bread ['cause], ya know... But I didn't have enough
