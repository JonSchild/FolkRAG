SoundScriber Field Recording Machines

These machines incorporate the same principles as the university type except that the motor is a six volt 
type and the amplifier, motor and small motor generator are completely operated from the one six volt 120
amp. hr. storage battery which will operate the equipment for eight hrs. of continuous recording.  These are 
built on order only and to meet the particular requirements of each field worker.  The mother generator is 
mounted with the turntable case.  The total weight is about 110 pounds.

SoundScriber Recording Accessories

The Sound Specialties Company has developed a process for annealing aluminum records and producing 
a resulting record of a far lower surface noise than the usual aluminum discs and better ability to register 
the sound frequency range.  They are no more expensive than ordinary discs. Samples will be sent on request.

An acetate disc has also been developed which has a decided improvement in hardness and yet with 
smooth cutting qualities.  Freedom from surface imperfections has been accomplished by air conditioned 
atmospheres for the manufacture.  All sizes are available.

All types of cutting stylii are also available at reasonable prices and ideally suited to all recording needs. 

Special pickups, cutting heads, turntables are also furnished.

Brief History of the Company

The Sound Specialties Company was organized in 1932 by Lincoln Thompson, its president. It first 
occupied quarters with The Bristol Company and took over the sound work of this company which dated 
back to the first days of radio.  Mr. Thompson has a background of undergraduate work as well as graduate 
study in the field of physics and electricity, and was instructor for two years at Worcester Tech.  Several 
years' experience with the Victor Company in sound development and engineering were followed by many 
years in talking picture research and development through the earliest stages of this art.  The Sound Specialties 
recording equipment has an enviable record in scientific laboratories and universities.

Field recording equipments have been furnished to expeditions to all parts of the world and used under 
the most trying conditions.  This attests to the ruggedness of the equipments and the success of people recording 
in remote parts without technical or mechanical training indicates the simplicity and positiveness of 
operation.

SoundScriber Machines are built in their entirety in the factory of the Sound Specialties Company and 
hence represent a coordinated design and not a "hodge podge" assembly of home recording apparatus. 
Long research has produced simplified, rugged devices which can be operated by unskilled people with 
complete success.  At every point adaptability to future improvements in recording media or methods has 
been kept in mind and SoundScriber machines will not wear out in years of hard usage nor will  they be 
obsolete.
