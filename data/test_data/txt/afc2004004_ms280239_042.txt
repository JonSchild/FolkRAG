TAPE 36: JULY 16th. JOHN STRACHAN.
Bonnie Udney
1) O Udney, bonnie Udney, at present adieu,
Whereer I wander I'll aye think on you.
O'er hills and through valleys though often I've gone,
Through brambles and brushwood myself all alone.

2) It is not the long road that I have to go,
It is not the journey that vexes me so,
It's the leaving o' Udney, and good friends behind,
O Udney, bonnie Udney, you're aye in my mind.

3) Al young men aboot Udney are a' rovin' blades,
And they take great pleasure in courting fair maids,
They kiss them and clap them and spend money free,
O when I get to Scotland, it's Udney for me.

4) We'll drink and be merry, we'll drink and gang hame,
If we bide here any longer we'll get a bad name,
We'll get a bad name, boys, and feel oursel's fools,
In the lang walks o' bonnie Udney, they're hard to gang through.

The Bonnie Lass o' Fyvie-o (fragment.)
1) It's braw, it's braw a captain's lady to be,
It's braw being a captain's lady-o,
It's braw to ride and rant and to follow wi' the camp,
And to fight for your captain when he's ready-o.

2) And green grows the banks on bonnie Aithen side,
And low lies the bonnie lowes o' Fyvie-o,
Our captain's name was Ned and he died for a maid,
And her name was caled pretty Peggy-o.

The Gaberlunzie Man
1) A beggarman came o'er the lea,
A-looking oot for charity,
A looking out for charity,
"Will ye lodge a beggarman?"
Laddle to me tow-row-ree.

2) Doon by the fireside the old man sat,
He loosed his meal bags off his back,
He loosed his meals bags off his back
And aye he lilted and sang,
Laddle to me tow row ree.
