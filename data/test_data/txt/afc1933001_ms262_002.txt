ARCHIVE OF AMERICAN FOLK-SONG.

Although, unfortunately, funds for the continuance of the services of
a trained specialist were no longer available - a fact already recorded and
deplored in last year's report -, some few but valuable additions have been
made to the Library's collection of folk-song disks, with the help of funds,
generally placed at the disposal of the Library, by the American Council of
Learned Societies and its Committee on Musicology, for the express purpose
of acquiring "equipment" for the Archive. The latest equipment which has
been bought consists in a recently perfected recording apparatus. The occasion and reason for the purchase was furnished by the kind offer of Professor
John A. Lomax - who has frequently resorted to the contents of the Library in
his research work -, to give to the Library, in return for the use of a recording machine, any records that he might obtain with it.
The report of Professor Lomax follows:
