Report of Observation Post, Wichita, Kansas
Meeting of January 8, 1942

Conclusions

I. The people of Wichita have accepted the war, and are supporting it. Evidences 
of this:

A. Red Cross workers find people committed to the war, and willing to
make whatever sacrifices are needed "to get it over with as soon as 
possible."

B. Airplane workers have speeded up work; have accepted longer hours 
without protest; dissension among the workers seems to have died out.

C. "The Women of America", consisting of the mothers of the soldiers of
the 35th division, who had circulated a petition protesting the convoying 
of ships, and sending American soldiers to fight on foreign
soil are now inactive.  They seem to have accepted the necessity of
our war measures to date.

D. The Wichita branch of the Mothers of American Sons, a national organization, 
has disbanded.

E. Conversations with people in various social and economic levels.

II. So far the war appears to us to be something far away.  Thus:

A. Registration for Civilian Defense is lagging.

B. Some resentment is expressed against the restrictions on automobiles. 
These people insist they are for this if necessary to win the war, 
but they, they say, are not convinced that such interference with 
business is needed.

C. A few of the white collar workers (not the executives) still speak of 
"that --- -----Roosevelt, I don't trust  him."

III. There has been no noticeable increase in anti-Semitism, nor any attack
made along this line.

IV. The usual hysteria which accompanies the outbreak of war is evident.

A. Thus we have:

1. "Stamp Out the Japs" posters appearing in some windows.

2. A new "Victory Women's Club" is reported to have been formed.  
(This is being checked.)

3. Certain legionnaries seem quite wrought up--though no vigilante 
activities seem to have taken place so far. (This is to be inquited
into more carefully.)
