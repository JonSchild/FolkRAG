Mr. Alan Lomax
124 West 12th Street
New York City

Dear Alan:

I am sorry that my last letter succeeded in imparting to you my present state of mind. I have been simply swamped since my trip to New York, and on top of that, Carolyn has been quite ill. As though that weren't enough, our request to Congress for an increase in personnel seems to have fallen through completely (confidential).

I have asked Voorus to arrange for a travel order and shall see that it is sent up to you immediately. I shall be glad to see you on Friday.

Regards!

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music

P.S. The enclosed clipping contains the only comment that the Washington Herald-Times had on the annual report. I am beginning to think something of my editorial eye because it was the portion I picked out as so significant.
