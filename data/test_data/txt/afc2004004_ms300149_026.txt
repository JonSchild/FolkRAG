Dear Nat:

You remember that you worked as a side
man on some of the Sea Islands records.
I am now releasing four or five of the
pieces on which you played drums, with
a small company called Prestige, Inc.
Enclosed is my check in the amount of
$53.50, which is your recording fee.

Although the Williamsburg matter folded
up, Bessie Jones is now staying with me
in New York, and we are trying to get
a group from the Sea Islands into New
York. If we are successful, I'll certainly
get in touch with you.

My best regards to you and your wife.

Yours cordially,

Alan Lomax
