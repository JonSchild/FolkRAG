people ain't scared of you, you live along time.
You have friends on hand. Now a man one time
went travelin, he didn't know what country to get
on to. When you know those things, you know your
folks when you see them, even if you never met the
person before, you know him. [It is] If he's a joker, but
then you meet him and he says "Hey son of a bitch
I know you're headin [over here] come on I'll buy you
a drink." You understand? He asked you on, go ahead,
take that drink go ahead. You ain't got no price
[?] to get the son of a bitch a beer. You know
what I'm talkin about?

L. JOHNSON:  Yeah I know.

GARY DAVIS:    Did you know what them boys would do to stand by
that son of a [?] bitch, they ain't gonna let
anybody hurt that son of a bitch. Ya understand?

L.J.   Hmmmm.

GARY DAVIS:   They like him, ya understand?  You know what I'm
talking about?  What you're going through you
ain't gonna take nothing you understand, you gonna
take something, if its nothing but a bullet out of
a pistol you understand.  Up to a graveyard too.

LJ:   LAughs

GARY DAVIS:    Ya know theres a pill for any condition, ya understand?
Yet the man is fast after women, oh to enjoy their
woman because look. Now thats what you talk to
yourself about, [when you're alone] before you leave home.
I ain't gonna get past that.
