If I had the governor
Where the governor got me
Before Tuesday morning
That governor would go free.
Six months has gone by babe,
And I wish I was dead.
This dirty old jail house
The floor for a bed.
Its raining, its hailing, the moon
gives no light
Oh please tell me babe.
Why you never write.
I've counted the days babe
I've counted the nights,
I've counted the moments
I've counted the lights.
I've counted the footsteps
I've counted the stars,
I've counted a million
Of these prison bars.
I've counted on you babe
To give me a break,
I guess you have forgotten babe
I live for your sake
