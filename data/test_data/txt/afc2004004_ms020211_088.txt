Dear Mr. Davis,

Enclosed please find a cheque in the amount of 
$ 50.00 for the performance of the Sea Island Singers,
while we were filming.

Kindly sign the enclosed forms where marked 'X'
and return same in the self-addressed envelope.
Unfortunately the sequence with the singers has not
been used due to a very tight schedule.  Gerd Ruge
sends his best regards to you and all the singers.

Yours sincerely,
