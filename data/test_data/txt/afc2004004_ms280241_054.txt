Tape 87A, Davie Stewart:

McPherson's Farewell  :

1) Fare ye weel, ye dungeons dark and strong,
Fare=weel, fare-weel to thee, 
McPhersn's rant will nae be lang
On younder gallows bee.
Chorus:
Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,
O rantingly was he.
He played the tune and he danced it roun'
Below the gallows tree.

2) The Laird of Grant that highland saint
That first laid hands on me,
He played the cause to Peter Brown
To watch McPherson sie.

3) By a woman's treacherous hand
That I was condemned to dee,
High on a ledge of her window sill
And a blanket she threw over me.

4) Some come here noo too see me hang,
And some to buy my fiddle,
Before I will part wi' thee
I'll break her through the middle.

5) Fare-well, men, tae you highland hame,
Fareweel, my wife and bairn.
There was nae repenting at my heart
While the fiddle was in my airm.

6) Come ye lower the bands from off my arm,
Bring to me noo my sword,
There's nae a man in all Scotland
That'll deir at his word.

7) O little did my mother think 
When first she cradled me,
ThatI would turn a rovin' boy
And die upon the gallows tree.

8) The reprieve was coming o'er the brig of Banff
To set McPherson free,
They put the clock at quarter past
And they hanged him to the tree.
