The Cowboy's Ride
(Sent in by Mrs. Minta Morgan, [Rells] Bells, Texas; [ne record.])
An old song learned from Bill Powell, a cowboy, about 1890.

Oh! for a ride o'er the prairies free,
On a fiery untamed steed,
Where the curlews fly and the coyotes cry,
And the western wind goes sweeping by,
For my heart enjoys the speed.

With my left hand light on the bridle rein, 
And the saddle girth clinched behind, 
With a lariat tied at my pony's side
By my stout right arm that's true and tried, 
We race with the [wind] whistling wind. 

We're up and away in the morning light, 
As swift as the shootong star 
That suddenly shoots across the sky, 
And the wild birds  whirl in quick surprise 
At the cowboys  gay hurrah. 

AS free as a bird on the rolling sea 
We skim the pasture wide; 
Like a sea gull strong we hurry along 
And the earth resounds with a golloping song, 
As we sail through the fragrant tide. 

You can have you ride in the crowded town; 
Give me the prairies free, 
Where the curlews fly and the coyotes cry, 
And the heart expands beneath the sky; 
Oh! that's the life for me.
