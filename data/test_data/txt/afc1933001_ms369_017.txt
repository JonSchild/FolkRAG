far more sentimental and back-to-nature than Wordsworth at
his most maudlin. In the light of this and other evidence
she concludes that the answers to her questions are all
downrightly negative. She even goes so far as to say that
"the lyric" is the earliest form of poetic composition.
So far as I am concerned, I agree neither with Miss
Pound nor with the theory she criticizes. Anthropological
evidence has to be more carefully considered than either
party has taken pains to do. The poetry and music of each
group will have to be judged on its own standards before
it can be compared to that of any other culture, much less
compared to the poetry of Western Europe and discussed in
terms of it. Nevertheless, as the argument stands, Miss
Pound has thrown doubt on the most fundamental aspect of
the communalist theory since primitive (i.e. ancient) poetry 
is all communal, choral and narrative in interest;
ballads, being ancient, are communal, choral and narrative
The Medieval Dance Song.
Having cut the communalist off from his roots, Miss
Pound begins upon the trunk of his theory. Her question is:
What evidence do we have that the English ballads themselves
originated in the dancing throng and were principally dance
songs?
1) The word "ballad" was used in the 14th century
to mean the French Art Lyric. Thus, in a period
when it could have meant dance song, it did not
denote narrative lyric.
2) In the Elizabethan period it was used to mean
lyrics or songs of any sort, narrative songs included.
