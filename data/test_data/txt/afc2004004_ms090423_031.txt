     Another consequence of urbanism on the Delta negro life is the 
growing race consciousness and this growing race consciousness affects
social and work songs and other folk expressive life.   On this point 
Dr. R.E. Park said :
     The Negro is now, to an extent that was never before true,
awake.   The Negro race, for good or for ill, is coming out 
of its isolation, and entering a world where it is exposed 
to all the contagious influences of modern life,   The unrest 
which is fermenting in every part of the world, has gotten 
finally under the skin of the Negro . . .   The disposition of the
Negro in America to-day . . . no matter how slightly tinged
with African blood, is to accept the racial designation that
America had thrust upon him and identify himself with the 
people whose traditions, status, and ambitions he shares. 43.
