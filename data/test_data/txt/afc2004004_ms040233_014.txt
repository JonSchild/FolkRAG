Well, on recovering my self-possession,
which this unexpected episode had
ruffled, the Prince again joined us.
He represented, with an eloquence
and fascination of manner so
familiar to himself, the guarded state
of the island,which, without a passport,
no one could leave: his harassed state
of mind and worn out strength; and that
I was the very person who could, 
and he trusted in god, would aid him,
more particularly as I should be able to
procure passports for myself and a
female servant, also for Mc Eachan,
from my step-father, who knew I was
just about this time returning to
Skye. I felt bewildered, not
knowing how to act. I entreated for
a few hours quiet to think over the
plan, and promised my answer on
the morrow.
