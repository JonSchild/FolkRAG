Miss Edith Dell Hopkins
Boonville, Indiana

Dear Miss Hopkins:

    A friend of yours, Miss Wilkin of Denver, 
who spent a great deal of time in the Music
Division last summer, spoke to me with great enthusiasm 
about you and your mother and the fine
stock of folk-songs that you knew. She promised
to write you about the work of the Library of Congress 
in collecting the folk-songs of America in a
central, permanent depository and this, I presume, 
she has already done. Naturally, I have wanted to
come collecting out your way, but the opportunity
for such a visit has only just presented itself.

    The Library is sending me to Indiana in
April. Will it be possible for me to visit you and
your mother and record the folk-songs that you know?
If so, what time during April would suit your convenience? 
Do you have any suggestions about other informants, 
or about interesting regions in or near Indiana?

    I shall look forward to receiving a letter
from you in regard to these matters.

    Sincerely yours,

    Assistant in Charge.
