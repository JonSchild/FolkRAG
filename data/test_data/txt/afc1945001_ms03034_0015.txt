Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lickert:

Today I have asked Miss Frances Sweeney of the American Irish Defense Assn. to send on to you some of the reports and information which her organization has collected.  I think you will find much of this material valuable in appraising local conditions here in Boston.

You may be interested in a new project which this division is launching.  We are appointing throughout the ranks of organized labor in this state so called "morale wardens".  This group of people are intended to serve primarily in reporting rumors, sources of discontent and grievances which are disturbing to civilian morale.  In addition, however, they may be of some real use as a tentative public opinion panel.  We plan to send out questionaires every two weeks.  Should you be interested in getting any "feelers" on public reaction in this area to any event or situation, we would be very happy to cooperate with you by including appropriate questions to be answered.  Enclosed is a copy of the letter sent to the persons selected by the unions.

Yours very truly,

Robert H. Knapp, Chairman
Division of Propaganda Research
