Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thank you very much for your letter of March 21.  Based on what you have said,
it seems possible that our letter of March 25th may have created some confusion
in your mind.

What we were suggesting is that we would like an option on the three week period
beginning October 19, 1964, for Bessie Jones and the Georgia Sea Island Singers.
If we exercise the option it would be done prior to June 15, 1964.  In other
words, we need the period between now and June 15th to determine if we can sell
the three week tour in October.

We are not particularly interested in what steps are required to bring Bessie
Jones, five of her group and a suitable accompanist together - all that interests
us is that we have a package suitable for tour in Minneapolis on any agreed upon
date.  Incidentally, we would also like to know the name and something of the
background of the accompanist-guitarist you have in mind.

In reading your letter of March 31, it seems that you have the impression
that the fee of $2250 per week which we talked about would be subject to a
commission to Burton-James.  This is not what we had in mind and if you had based
your original figures on this premise then let's make an adjustment now.  We are
prepared to offer you a $2,000 guarantee net per week for the period of the tour
based on five days per week with a maximum of seven concerts in the five day 
period.  Thus there is no need for discussion as to commission since there would
be no commission due us.

If this still leaves questions in your mind, and since I expect to be on the road
for the next couple of weeks, might I suggest that if you feel it necessary to
call my partner, Mr. Goldstein, he certainly will be able to clarify any questions
you may have.

May we please hear from you?

Sincerely,
[* James S. Lombard, Jr.
