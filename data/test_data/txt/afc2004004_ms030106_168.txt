Orange, Mississippi is pretty close to the line of
Alabama.  So Harry always knew somehow or other that I had
pretty good relatives, and by me being able to play piano,
I always had a opportunity to make a little money in the
sporting houses, and so forth and so on -- which you could
find a sporting house in every city at that time.  I mean a
tenderloin district.  So Harry knew this quality that I had of keep-
ing some kind of money, so he invited me, says "I want to
let you see how these things is done, because showing you
without the actual experience, you wouldn't be able to do it,
and then it takes a lot of nerve."
Well, of course I convinced Harry that I had a lot of nerve
and I could do these things myself.  Well, when you skinin'
why, the cards is laying on the table and the people is run-
ning through them looking for what they call "singles."  So
I went in the game.  He told me to stay out of the game,
but I intended to get right in the game to have some experi-
ence.  And I did.
In the meantime, after we were playing in this little
bit of camp, I noticed there was three jacks together, so I
picked up the three jacks and as Harry had taught me to swing
out, as you call it, I swung out and I kept these jacks and
they dealt the cards and the next time the deal went around,
one jack fell -- that's what you call "falling."  So I said, That's
my card and I'll take the card."  By that time, Harry had won 
up an awful lot of money and he was throwing what you call a "side."
