Lomax: And there were some skirts there were there?
Wills: O indeed there was.
Lomax: Did you do a lot of singing in those pubs?
Wills: Yes - there was singing every Saturday night, and 
oftener than that sometimes; and accordion, somebody or other
had a 'cordion there, and another a tambourine. That's all we
had, see, we didn't have nothing else.
Lomax: There were right funny times.
Wills: We had plenty to eat - that was something. Plenty of
bread and cheese, my laddie.
Lomax: But you didn't eat any. You kept on drinking that
cider didn't you?
Wills: Sure I did. I left school when I was thirteen years old
and went on the farm to work, and I had five pints of cider a
day, like the men.
Lomax: Good gracious. And you're not a big fellow either. You're. . .
Wills: Five pints I did. Always had five pints. Oh, and if you
did drink it - and go and put your --- the man's living now - the
farmer's living now. Now a flagon is like that, see -- and the
strap come off. Well, if that there flagon was there outside the
celar door. He wouldn't fill it - not touch of -- but if it was
turned up on its end - many a time it was - he'd fill the flagon
and go on. But if it wasn't turned up on its end on the ground
stone - wasn't turned on the end - you wouldn't get any cider.
Lomax: What was the round stone? Is that a special stone?
Wills: No - one of the old millstones, you know. Where they
used to ground the barley meal and flour.
Lomax: So you worked half drunk all the time. I mean, you were
half high all the time you wrer at work.
Wils: No! 
Lomax: Did it make you fel pleasant?
Wills: It as too early in the morning for this man. I remember,
I and five old chaps empty our flagons before breakfast, and
cart 'em in again.
Lomax: When was that?
Wills: Along about when I was 19 --- 18 years old.
Lomax: Well, weren't you drunk by that time?
Wills: Drunk? NO! Had too much to eat then. Had good old-fashionned
blue cheese. Oh - you didn't get drunk. If the young
chaps now would drink a quarter of the cider we used to drink
out there, they'd be dead. Drunk! They got nothing to hold it.
