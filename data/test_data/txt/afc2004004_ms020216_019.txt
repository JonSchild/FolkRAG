BJ TAPE 3, p. 17

you, you carry your Bible.  The man -- the preachers tell ya,
"Bring your Bible."  Ya hardly see folks go to church without
their Bible.  It look like to me I naked if I go to church
without a Bible.  Folks watch me over there in, ah, Connecticut, they look 
me when I come in church with my Bible! I can't he'p it; it
look like I naked if I [come in a] go to church without a [my] Bible.  I
have went out there one or two times; I go to get up, I look 
around, I ain't got it! When the preacher take his text, I can 
take it, I can look to see where he at.  You see? You supposed
to know, yourse'f.   Jesus said, "Take up the cross and learn 
of me."  Ah, you know, "Learn of me, daily," see. "Daily," an' 
that mean in every respec'. You also read about it; you read
the Bible a little every day.  Read it like I read it; if you
got to work, you still can read it. See?
AL:    Sometimes you find the preacher is wrong I suppose?
BJ:     Sometimes you find the preacher done missed a word there,
too.
AL:     Then you stand up...?
BJ:      No, you'n got to stand up.  You can jus' sit there.  You
lookin' at 'im; jus' pronounce it, if you want to.  You know, 
if you don't, you ain't got to.
AL:     But you can speak in the Holiness Church?
BJ:     Yes sir! Oh, in the Holiness Church you supposed to.
Everybody have a Bible.  And, an' sometime the preacher may get
to a word -- everybody not educated, you know, that God sent
out, but he sent 'em with understandin' -- and, and ah, sometime
he get to a word, he [, he] can't read, he get started on it.  Somebody back
there, "That's so-and-so." Go on 'head 'bout your business.
Hit's a he'p.  We he'p us, one to another, ya see, in that way.
