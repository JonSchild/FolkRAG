Tory Stone

It lay half way in a 
2 feet long - a foot wide &
six inches thick - one side
was colored red as if blood
had dried on it - it
was written on it "Handle it 
carefully & not hurt it."
They wd catch hold on
this stone when they had
finished the trus & carry
it to their own stone &
then the stone had orders 
from them to kill any person
who harmed them.

The warp left Westpost
morning & watched by moonlight
She was coming to evict the
people.  They had made the 
Arus & they finished the warp
