[You Cain' Losa Me, Cholly]

Chorus:
You cain' losa me, Cholly, 
You cain, losa me, boy, 
You cain' losa me, Cholly, 
You cain' losa me, boy. 

Up to Willie Winston's I went a-rodin', 
Down on my knees I was doin' a little courtin', 
Ev'ry time she turn aroun' she said it so funny, 
You cain' losa me Cholly,
You cain' losa me, boy, 
You cain' losa me, Cholly, 
You cain' losa me, boy.

Hog an' de sheep they went to the paster, 
Hog says to de sheep, "You better get a little faster"
Ev'y time she turn around, [she ???] said it so funny, 
You cain' losa me, Cholly, 
You cain' losa me, boy, 
You cain' losa me Cholly, 
You cain' losa me, boy. 

I went a-rowin' an' my girl went, too, 
Down on de bottom when de boat broke through, #
Ev'y time she turn around she said it so funny, 
"You cain' losa me, Cholly, 
You cain' losa me, cain'?*
You cain' losa me, Cholly, 
You cain' losa me, boy."

L.B. Speaks:   Here's the last verse

L.B. Sings:      I got a yallow gal I can't keep, 
Uses up a barrel o' money ev'y week, 
Ev'y tiem she turn aroun' she said it so 
"I got a pretty boy to bring me the money, 
You cain' losa me, Cholly, 
You cain' losa me, boy, 
You cain' losa me, Cholly, 
You cain' losa me, cain'?"

*"Cain'," an abbreviation for "can you".
