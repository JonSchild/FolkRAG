Dear Mr. Lomax:
We Are collecting work-songs for a pageant to be
entitled, "America at Work". Will you be good enough
to refer me to the available sources with which you
are familiar.
Can you also put me on the track of songs that
are not well known by the general public?
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely yours,
Pierre Loving
