You see Aaron, I guest the reason why he got out of trouble 
so much -- it was often known that the Madame Papa Loos was the 
lady that always backed him when he got in trouble.  I don't with
 mean with funds or anything like that.  Money wasn't really in it. 
As I understand, she was a hoodoo woman; (some say voodoo), but 
it is known in New Orleans a hoodoo.  Well, Madame Papa Loos is 
supposed, that is [there are]from certain evidences, to tumble up 
Aaron's house, take all the sheets off the bed, tumble the 
mattresses over, put sheets in front of the glasses, take chairs 
and tumble them all over [.  T]that is said and known to discourage 
[a] the judge from prosecuting, and, of course, different witnesses [would]
have all their tongues supposed to be tied.  They was supposed to 
tie them in lamb's tongues and beef tongues and veal tongues out 
of the markets and stick them full of needles.  That is what I 
understand, I don't know because I[ha]'ve never seen [it].  Stick 
pins and needles all through them and take some -- well, say 
twine -- in order to make it really secure and tie these tongues 
up and that[ i]'s supposed to have the prosecuting attorn[ey]ies and the 
judges and juries and so forth and so on, have their tongues so that they 
can't talk against whoever the victim's supposed to be.  Not the 
victim, but the one that[wa]'s arrested [and imprisoned]a prisoner. So Aaron Harris 
was always successful in getting out of all of his troubles.
Of course, they have a lot of bad men in New Orleans, because 
new[?] wherever there is money there is a lot of tough people, there is 
no getting around it; 'but they had a lot of swell people there, too.
