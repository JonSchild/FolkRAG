Dear Dr. Botkin :
Can you ship me at once
to the Plaza Hotel, Corpus Christi, 
Texas, a pressing of my talk on 
:The Old Chisholm Trail," music etc?
It is one in the series I made 
for the Library under the direction 
of Phil Cohen. I must use 
the record on June 20. Be guided
accordingly if my request comes 
too late. I have just discovered
that my copy is very badly
worn. Thank you.
Sincerely yours, 
JohnA. Lomax

At Corpus Christi we are having a 
"Writers Conference."
