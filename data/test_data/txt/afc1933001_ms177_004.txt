Dear Jim:
   I presume the reason I haven't heard from you about the
book is that Macmillan is engaged in deciding what the amount of
the advance will be?  Nevertheless, I trustfully enclose a few
pages of the last chapter, which will be the story of Jelly Roll
Morton, as told by himself.  It's very rough;  it's never even
been properly gone over for typographical errors.

   The order of the book as I now see it will begin with brief
sketches and with the longest story, that of Jelly Roll Norton.
Intermediate material will gradually grow in complexity, leading
up to the idea of a small biography made up entirely of material
from records.

   I have never received the two complimentary copies of the
book destined to me.  Will you send one of them to me and t he
other to Herbert Robbins, care of the Mathematics Department,
New York University.

Best regards,

Alan Lomax
