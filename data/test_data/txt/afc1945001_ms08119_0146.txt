and he knew it was his appendix that was 
the trouble then he immediately started to operate 
on his brother. Then he was operating without 
no tools which was very dangerous. He took

the skin he used a bent spoon. He took out 
the appendix that way. Then after a couple a weeks 
he was well. He was a very lucky fellow to be 
saved by his brother.
