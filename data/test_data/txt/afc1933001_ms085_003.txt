my judgment Alan could bring out 
a machine and get a lot of valuable 
records at these two conferences, Why
not consider sending him? He could 
give the Archive fine publicity, tie 
up a lot of cooperative aid, I 
would gladly give him part of 
my time. I have not mentioned 
the plan to him. Nor will I 
You'll have to move fast with the 
sound truck he could make other stops,
at least on the return trip.

4. I do hope @ that you can 
have the records forwarded to me 
promptly (b) also that you can at once 
sent me a lot of material about 
the machine.
Sincerely always, 
JohnA. Lomax
