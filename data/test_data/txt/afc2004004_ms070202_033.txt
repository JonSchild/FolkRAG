white streets people asleep in [?]
at 8 in the morning -- a cathedral half
blown away in the 1915 storm -- found
[Mait] Maestro Theoman Francois in the
huge old house where he [makes] repairs instruments
& clocks & waited for him in
a room full of cuckoo clocks all pointing
at dif hours -- he told me a little inaccurately
of Aux Cayes' music -- everyone
tells me what I shd & shd not do
as if I didn't know my own business --
a fit old German coffee - exporter -- a
woman singing a strange primitive chant
picking over the coffee -- a little boy
in a shirt to navel singing his [?nove] in
the street -- the waterfront with all but
naked men hauling boats to beach muscles
like animals lean --
While I nymphomaniaced R. was doing
my work for me as usual. He went
away with the barefooted and ageble house
boy whom R. calls Granmoune to
hunt for Congo dancers. He wandered
all through the bush to the [Wes] East
