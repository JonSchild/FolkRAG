Sophomore  Negroes  Female

1. Way down south were bannaas grow
an Allie stepped on an Axis toe
The Axis said with tears in his eyes
Allie's why don't you pick on someone
your size
2. Look at old Hitler eating rice and steak
Sitting up there looking like Veronica
Lake
His mouth wide open and his
lying back
But he aint nothing but a dirty rat
