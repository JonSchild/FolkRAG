showed it to us an' Catherine took the note up.  Ah, he tol' 'er,
"Put it in the wastebasket."  But, I, I tol' 'er, said "If you

She said, "I am; I'll tear it up."  See?  An' she didn't;
she kep' it.  It's a good thing, too, pardner, she kep' it.
And then, an' he jus' asked her, he said, "What mus' I do?
'Cause if she -- If I don't, you know how it is.  I ain't, I ain't
gonna fool with her,"  An' den she gonna be always pickin' at 'im

He say, "Well, how he 'proach her then he -- That's
why he say he wanted to go."  You know, they all made it that way.
"That's why he say he gonna leave," an' all that kinda stuff.
But she, she say he had 'proached 'er an' the time she say
he had 'proached her, that was since he had told them, see?  'Cause
she heard he was gonna go, then she told that lie, see?  Yeah.
Yeah, she did.  An' I mean it.
