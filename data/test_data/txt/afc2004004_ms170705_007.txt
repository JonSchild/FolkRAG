Dear Alan,
     We seem to have lost touch. I've been
ill & wanted desperately to hear from you.
Somehow I've managed to get shingles.
It all started off about ten days ago with
what I thought was neuralgia - all my teeth
ached. Then after about five days of that,
I woke up one morning and vomited, and
had dizzy spells all morning. Lord God
Almighty, I thought! It's morning sickness!
It's virgin birth! Will Alan believe me?
And next day the same thing happened - 
but in the evening my period started - so
I had to  think along other lines! That night
I had a terrific fever & was sick again,
had this pain in my back, and my skin
burnt. And in the morning there was this
ugly rash across my back. The doctor came
& said brightly, "Oh yes, it's shingles" (Why
are they always so bright?) Then I felt
fine for a couple of days. But on Saturday
I felt low again I had a severe headache.
