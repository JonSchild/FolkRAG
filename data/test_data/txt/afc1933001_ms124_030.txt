Dear Miss Owens:

During September and October I shall be in the Eastern part 
of Kentucky making records of folk-songs for the Archive of American
Folk-Songs in the Library of Congress. I am anxious to meet
and cooperate with all the collectors in the region, doing whatever
I can to help them in their work at the samt time as I ask
their assistance in forwarding the work of the Archive.

I was delighted to discover in reading the last issue of the
"Southern Folklore Quarterly" that there was at least one ardent
collector in Pike County; I have no contacts in that area and it
seeme likely to be one of the most interesting from the point of
view of ballads in the whole of Eastern Kentucky. Will you be in
Pike County during September and October? Would you have time to
talk over with me the problems of collecting in the region and
perhaps help me to find some of the best singers in the county?

The Archive will appreciate whatever assistance and specific
information about folk-songs in Pike County you feel able to offer,
I hope to hear from you before September the first, when I plan to
leave Washington for Kentucky.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge,

P.S. Were the ballads and songs attributed to you in the "Southern
Folklore Quarterly" collected from your students or from other sources?
