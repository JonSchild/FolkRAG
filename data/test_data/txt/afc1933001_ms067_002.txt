Dear Mr. Spivocke:
Alan has written me that you
wished a more detailed account
of my ballad-hunting trip to Washington.
So far as I can tell at
this time I plan to visit:

1. A large colony of Negro farmers
in North Texas along the Red River,
for more spirituals and reels.

2. The Seminole Indians in Western
Oklahoma to record their singing
of Methodist revival songs.

3. The State Penitentiary of Oklahoma
where a large number of Negroes
are confined.

4. Dockworkers and old sailors in
the ports of Houston and Galveston
