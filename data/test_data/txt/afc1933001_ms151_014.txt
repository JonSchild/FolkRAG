November 18, 1939

Dear Tony:

We all have been wondering what had happened
to you and were very much worried about you and Comanche.
Did you ever go to see the man at the Columbia Recording
Company? On your way home I hope you will drop in to
see us. We will be very happy to see you again.

Your friend,
