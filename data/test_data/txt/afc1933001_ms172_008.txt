Mr. Sam Henry
Sandelford, Coleraine
Co. Londonderry, Ireland

Dear Mr. Henry:

When I asked you for your collection of songs I had no idea
that it would be a problem for you to assemble them. I imagined you in
a room full of ballad sheets, and a rack filling orders from all over the
British Empire. My temerity, however, has been undeservedly and largely
rewarded by the arrival of this superb collection of Irish Balladry. It
will be useful everyday in folk song work in the Library. When I can, I
will return the compliment by sending you copies of verses of your ballads
that I have found in the United States. I am recommending that the Library
repay you for your expense and thank you officially for your trouble.

Perhaps you will be interested to learn that the Archive of American
Folk Song, has recently acquired a complete duplicating laboratory and
recording studio along with a field truck and a number of other recording
outfits. This year we will have recording expeditions all the way from Alaska
to Brazil. Do you know whether work of similar sort has been done in Ulster? I know of the work being done in Eire.

Are you familiar with an Irish Ballad of Napoleonic Wars beginning;

 "I have two sons, and a son-in-law"
                           
Fighting in the Wars of America.

I shall endeavor to get copies of your broadcast to the B.B.C. office,
and further I shall write Mr. Bolton. Again, may I thank you personally for
the Archive of American Folk Song, for one of its most treasured items.

Cordially yours,


Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
