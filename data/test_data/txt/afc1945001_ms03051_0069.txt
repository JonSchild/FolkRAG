"The boys in the Army have it hard-even if they do the right thing at the table like taking a plate when it is passed, the one passing it will drop it. I know one boy who was told by a superior officer that that kind of thing was going to make it hard for him. He was new there and didn't know how they did things at the table."
 said by 2 business girls who heard it from a woman who got it from the boy.
