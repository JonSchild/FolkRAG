Reverend Roe. Reel. 15. P. 7

Pass by here
With a sooty bag on her back
Wallopin and gallopin
With all themoney I had since
I'ze in Georgia..

Says, "She's in the hopper." And she's behind the door, you know.
So he is peeing over in the hopper looking for her, and she pushed
him over in there and ground him up. And then this old cat walked
up and told her to look up over that place in mill door there and you
see a switch, and get your sisters." So she went on up there and
found the switch, and she stirred [stirring] around in there, you know, and
found her sisters, and they all come and got up. And she carried
them back to the old bachelor's house and went and got her mother and
brought her there. And they lived happy from that day to this (laughter).
