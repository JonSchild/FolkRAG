Dear Alan:

I am not in the least afraid that we will lack song material for 24 interesting programs on American folk music. I am a little worried about the orchestral material and, for that reason, am anxious to get outlines of the other 17 programs from you. They should be planned on the same basis that you and I planned the first seven.

Have you received yet the copy of my memorandum outlining what we had done so far? If you can give us those outlines, I can give you an immediate confirmation of your engagement to plan the series and engage as a commentator and, occasionally, as a singer.  Providing the orchestral material is going to be the toughest part of the program.

Yes, we can use records for sound effects.

I am not sure we should originate any part of the program in Washington, because I would like you to talk about the symphony pieces as well as the songs. However, that is not the urgent thing to decide just yet. The urgent thing is 17 more programs like the first seven.

Best regards to you. I had a wonderful time listening to the records and having you at the house.

Yours very truly,

Dave
