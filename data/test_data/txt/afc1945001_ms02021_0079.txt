SPECIAL DELIVERY

Mr. Thomas P. Carroll
Chief, Field Service
Bureau of Public Inquiries
Office of War Information
1400 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Carroll:

     Please find enclosed herewith a report on the rumor situation
in Colorado.

     As you know, the Citizens for Victory is a national organization
devoted to unity in this country and between the Allies. Over some
period of time its members have been devoting their time to very laudible
pursuits with regard to the war effort. As you know, they were the ones
who gave me those electrical transcriptions which I sent to Miss Blackburn.

     When it is convenient for you to do so I would very much
appreciate it if you would advise this office if the Citizens for
Victory can be of any assistance in regard to the reporting of rumors
or in any other way because they have frequently stated that they are
most anxious to help us all possible.

Very truly yours,

Eugene F. Duffy
Field Representative
