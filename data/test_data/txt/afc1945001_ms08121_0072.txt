An Error 

It was just when my brother's business 
was getting started, then his draft board 
sent a notice telling him to come down 
for physical examination.  A few weeks later 
they sent another notice saying he was in 
1A.  He tried to get a deferment but could 
not.  He then joined the navy and became 
an instructor down at Navy Pier and 
teaches lubrication.  He no more joined 
and again a notice arrived from the 
draft board telling him it was a 
mistake that he was in another class.  
But he was glad that he joined because 
if he waited he would not have gotten 
the position he has now.
