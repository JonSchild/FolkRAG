I tried him first on the tragedy of "Big Jim" which had come to
me from Vicksburg Mississippi.  [*It begins:*]
Cold and chill is de winter wind,
Big Jim's dead and gone.
Big Jim was my lovin' man,
Long, long, long are de years.
An [on] as I read those lines of Shakesperian intensity and perless
phrasing,
("Oh, I've got you, Mr. Latham, I saw you try to smother that
gulp of sympathy with your handkerchief.")
Next I read him that long;; ballad of Adam and Eve in the garden
pinning leaves, read it all and read it in [shouting] elocutionary style that
Mrs. Carrie Langston Cox had taught me when I was a boy.  (Tom Peete Cross
of the University of Chicago gave me that ballad.  At the modern
Language Association meetings he used to recite it to uproarious applause with
the fourth drink coming up.  And I like it even if Robert Gordon,who
knows more about folk songs than a whole company of experts, does
hold that it is not of Negro origin.)  In the concluding stanzas the
Lord takes the situation energetically in hand and shouts when he
discovers an apple missing:
"Adam, Adam, where are thou?"
Dese bones swine to rise again
"Here, my Lord, d'se a-coming now."
Dese bones gwine to rise again.
[*double space*]
"Stole my apple, I believe?"
Dese bones gwine to rise again.
"No my Lord, but I spilt it on Eve"
[*spec it was*]
