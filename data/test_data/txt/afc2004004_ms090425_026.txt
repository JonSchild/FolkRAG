Conversion Experience by Bro. Joiner. 

Sisters and borthers and to the ministers and all that go to make up 
this congregation...  I know for myself that I been born again. How I
know I been born again because I prayed, I mean I prayed.  I'm gonna
tell you in a short way -- I'm not going all around it -- I'm just
gonna tell you a little of it.
A:  Tell us all about it.
J:  Well, I know I been converted.  I was converted in 1900 in Tennessee,
20 miles the other side of Memphis.  That's 41 years ago, and in
them days and time when a revival would start, we'd run prayer meeting
a week and the old sisters and one thong and another, they had their
dresses down right there where they ought to be (laughter), and
they put the harness on the knees and the dress would be long, you
know, and they'd tie things around the waist and go to church and you
wouldn't see em fan -- you wouldn't see em knees -- you wouldn't see
em picking games.  And when I came through with religion, the preacher
didn't have to preach like they preach now.  The soldiers run to
me, and sometimes they couldn't hardly open the doors of the church,
for when one come through he'd have to run revival.  And, you know,
when I got to talking about it, you know, it just works me up, just
gits all over me.
Some folks, when they talking about stars and one thing or another, --
I'd go out, talking about the head getting middle, you mind that way.
Mine got wet, and I would go out to my prayer-ground -- if I'd go to
sleep at a certain time, I'd tell the Lord to shake me.  He'd shake
me when I tell Him.  Then I would sneak on out to my prayer-ground,
git out there and pray, and go back home.  And when I got through of
th e praying, I didn't want to see nobody -- I didn't want to meet
nobody and wouldn't meet nobody.  And the last time I went out there,
you know, this time, they say, "We're gonna have a mornin meeting
