Petrified Forest

WHOPPERS

1 A way out yonder in Arizony
Where it ain't rain since Noah
And it's so dry you have to prime yourself to spit,
And it's so dry the grass widows can't take root,
Thar's a wonderful forest whar the trees is a-growin'
Jest the same as they did centuries and centuries ago,
But a-a-all pewtrified, ladies and gentlemen,
A-a-all pewtrified.
And the roots of them thar those trees is a-growin' way down in the ground,
A-spreadin' out an a-takin' holt on the dirt,
Jest the same as they did centuries and centuries ago--
But a-a-all pewtrified, ladies and gentlemen, all pewtrified.
And the brancnes of them thar trees is a-growin' full of twigs and
leaves and bird's nests,
Jest the same as they did centuries and centuries ago;
And flyin' around them thar branches and through the pewtrified air
Is a number of pine hens,
Sand-hill cranes,
White-necked ravens,
And yellow-headed blackbirds,
All a-singin' their beautiful songs jest as they did centuries and 
centuries ago,
But a-a-all pewtrified, ladies and gentlemen,
A-a-all pewtrified.

2 Now when I give a lecture on Arizony up to Boston last week and told
this interestin' scientific fact,
Some unbelievin' miscreant sings out,
"What about the law of gravitation?"
And I sings out right back to him,
"Seems to me that anybody with the sense of a coyote'd know that away
out there in Arizony
This here cow law of gravitation hain't worked for centuries and centuries,
But is like everythin' else aout there--
A-a-all pewtrified, ladies and gentlemen,
Completely pewtrified."
