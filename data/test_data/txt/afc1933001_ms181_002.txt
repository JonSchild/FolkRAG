Dear Alan Lomax
Following your request I've packed
up the record "Pretty Polly' and sent
in to Frank. It is still in good
condition and should afford a
'master' pretty easily. I'm more 
than glad you're including this in
your set. IT is, to my mind, one of
the prize recordings of all time.
Our Album came out today. I 
should like to know what you think
of the way our  'Cindy' and 'Old Joe Clark' 
are treated. Neither the composers or I think that we've solved the problem
of extension for the folk song but
its a beginning. And I don't think
the old songs have been 'desecrated' 
in our kind of elaboration. What do
you think? We've left the songs intact
and with simple backgrounds but have
used them as a sort of springboard. The
harmonica variations (solo) in 'Old Joe Clark'
