the music of the voices discussing
ships, cattle, love, poteen
Through flocks of sheep. Each
shepherd with his crooked stick
& dressed in a suit & normal
city hat, as if too proud to show
except in his boots that he was
a countryman.
Firze is masses of soft green thorns
which hold their prickles only at
the tip - even then it's rather
soft. Lemon yellow flowers, same
color as cactus blossoms, curiously,
but the cactus is an enemy, while
the firze is food for sheep, donkey
& cow. Furze hedges.
Rock fences. Thorn hedges. Small
fields, half green in the winter.
The ivy green with a joyous green,
The barreness of the trees seeming have
a respite between seasons of [?] =
bearing, not a threat.
