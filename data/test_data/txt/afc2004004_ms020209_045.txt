[?] Today: Only Saigon's Poor [See?]

[?n] emblazons the lifelike
[?re] of the late North Viet-
[ese] leader, Ho Chi Minh,
[ch] hangs from Independ-
[e] Palace where President
[yen] Van Thieu once held
[y]. The now lives in exile

  [he] fancy French
[aurants] with the fine wines
virtually empty. 
[here] is scarcely and [Ameri-]
in sight. And middle-class
[tnamese] no longer want to
seen in public with the few
[ericans] who remained [be-]
[d] after the United States
[cuation] April 29. 

While there has been no evidence
of a blood bath or mass 
[risals] as so freely predicted

[uture,]

abroad, the spirit of many of
the 3 Â½ million Saigonese appears
to have been killed, the
heartbeat of the city cut out.
But for the first time in 30
years, the guns have fallen silent,
refugees are returning to
their ancestral villages, fields
are being plowed instead of 
bombed and shelled, and 
homes are being rebuilt.
 It is the fear of austerity and
regimentation by the Provisional
Revolutionary Government 
(PRG) which has broken
the spirit of many of the middle
class, upper middle class
and rich Saigonese. The banks
have been closed for a month,
a move that appears 
deliberately designed by the
PRG to control money circulation
and make rice a key item
of barter. The rich have been
hard hit but the poor are unaffected. 
 Movie houses that once featured
the top American and 
French films now show only
the life of Ho Chi Minh. The
bars and the nightclubs are
closed, some of them turned
into barracks for the PRG
soldiers. 
 There is still and aura of apprehension,
and a fear of reprisals
but some awesome predictions
have never materialized.
The orphans that some
Americans predicted would be
killed by the PRG or made
Communists appear to be well
taken care of. Children still
play in the parks as they always
did, but I have seen some 
youngsters, with arms folded 
or manacled, marched up the 
streets by PRG soldiers in
shame and disgrace for thievery.
 Some of the same children
who made a business of begging
under the former regime
are doing the same under the
new government. And as
before women still borrow

what their roles might be. It is 
not known for its coffee or pastries,
but for its rumors. Crime
is rampant in Saigon but it always
has been. The PRG
seems to be taking the crime
situation much more seriously 
than the previous regime did. 
 There is no police force because
there is no civilian government.
 The city is governed by the
PRG's Military Management
Committee, headed by Lt.
Gen. Tran Van Tra who
directed the 1968 Tet and 1972
Easter offensives in the Saigon 
region.
 People are stealing now because
they are desperate for 
money and food and those let
loose from the more than one
million man Saigon army and
police force have swelled the
ranks of the more than one million
that already had been unemployed 
under the Thieu regime.
 The United States pullout
also left thousands more unemployed.
 The PRG is dealing more
harshly with crime than the
previous regime and publicizing
it as a warning they do not
intend to let things get out of 
hand. Thieves are being tried
by "people's tribunals."
 The PRG blames the crime
wave, like everything else, on
the Americans and have published
cartoons depicting Uncle
Sam embracing Thieu with
a family of gangsters and [?]
pies surrounding [?em], while
in the next caption a large
crowd is yelling: "long live
the revolutionary government
which is determined to 
eliminate thieves and
robbers."
 A PRG-sponsored campaign
against what it calls "depraved"
culture also has been under 
way for a week with daily
student demonstrations. The 

considered decadent and
thousands of comic books with
Vietnamese translations have
been turned in, according to
PRG officials.
 Despite the campaign
against American consumer
products, many are still visible
in sidewalk supermarkets
including a new one that went 
up at the entrance to Tan Son
Nhut air base.
 You can buy everything from
Scotch whiskey to toilet paper.
Most of these items were
looted from American homes,
offices and U.S.government
leased buildings following the
flight of the Americans on
April 29, the day before the
Saigon government surrendered,
and before the PRG
could establish security. 
 The PRG are reopening private
schools, businesses and
hospitals, trying to return a 
city the size of Boston to normal
like. Civil servants under 
the Thieu regime are being
called back to work, generally
at half the salaries they made 
before, but they are also being
given rations of rice for their 
wives and children.
 The PRG says its main efforts
now are being devoted to
eliminating crime and hunger,
stabilizing the economy,
normalizing production, 
rebuilding the country, and
raising the currently reduced
standards of living.
 The PRG has not spelled out
its full economic program, [b??]
it is trying to eliminate unemployment
by returning
refugees from Saigon to their
home villages in central and
northern parts of the country. 
 According to the PRG, more
than 30,000 refugees have been
returned to their ancestral villages
in the first phase of the
program which is continuing. 
The return to the countryside,
the PRG says, is "aimed at

eliminating economic difficulties
left behind by the
Americans and their puppet
government while at the same
time helping to normalize
production, rebuild the
country, and raise the standard
of living of the population."
  Many of the policies of the 
new government remain to be 
defined including its relations
with North Vietnam, its
domestic policies, and its 
foreign policy.
  The PRG says it wants to establish
relations all over the 
world including diplomatic ties
with the United States, but at a 
small mission level, if
