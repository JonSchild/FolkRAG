3rd R. of 10/12/61, P. 21, Song 1

THE LORD FOLLOWED ME

I went to the meeting one night
And the Lawd followed me, 
My heart was not right
But the Lawd followed me. 
Oh, I tried to run away, 
I said I would not stay
And I refused to kneel and pray
But the Lawd followed me. 
I'm glad he followed me, 
So glad he followed me, 
I'm glad he's
And he followed me. 
When my life was very bad
My heart was very sad, 
But now I'm so glad
That the Lawd followed me. 
Yeah, I'm glad he followed me, 
So glad he followed me, 
I am glad he come to send me
And he follows me. 
My life was very bad, 
My heart was very sad
But now I'm so glad
That the Lawd followed me.
