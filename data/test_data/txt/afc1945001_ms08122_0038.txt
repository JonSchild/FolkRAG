Rumors

I have heard a rumor, that
said "our clothes would would
be rationed just as sudden
as shoes," But I read in the
newspaper that they wouldn't
unless people started hoaring
clothes, then they would ration
clothes.  I heard to that if Hitler
conquered American all the girls
would have to work on farms
and be put in labor camps.
As far as being put on a
farm to work if Hitler captured
us, is it might be true because maybe
this summer we will have to
work on the farm, I would
rather work for the U. S. than
for Hitler.  I have also heard
that if Hitler captured America
a can of pease would be around
ninty-five cent, a package of
cigarettes would be a dollar.
