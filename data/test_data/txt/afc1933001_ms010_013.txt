Dear Mr. Engel:

Your letter to Detroit failed 
to reach me there. I came 
on the New York and Alan and 
I will go over carefully with 
Mr. Garwick the machine. By 
December 16 we will again be 
making rounds in Negro 
prison camps in Texas, the 
originals of which we will 
deposit in the Library of Congress. 
We are grateful for 
your continued support.

On our way to Texas 
we will stop in Washington
