Dear Alan,
Thank you for your letter of explanation.
I am looking for information and enclose 
a card for your answer if you can 
find time to answer.

Can you help me locate the singer of 
"Laissez - moi cha la lise." - a song 
which I transcribed from one of your records.
So far as I can guess the last three
syllables are only meaningless sounds.
Did you hear from the singer what they meant?
Who sang the song? Where did she live? Were 
there other people in the same neighborhood
who sang the same song? Can you find 
these syllables [among a] in a French song
in a collection from France in the Library 
of Congress? Leave off the last if you are
very busy; which I guess you are -
(ove?
