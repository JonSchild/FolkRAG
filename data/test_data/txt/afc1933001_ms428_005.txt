Holy, Holy, Holy
Holy, holy, holy!
Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning
Our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, holy, holy,
Merciful and mighty!
God in Three Persons -
Blessed Trinity!

Holy, holy, holy!
All the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns
Around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and seraphim
Falling down before Thee,
Which wert, and art, 
And evermore shall be.

Holy, holy, holy!
Lord God Almighty!
All Thy words shall praise Thy name,
In earth, and sky, and sea;
Holy, holy, holy,
Merciful and mighty!
God in Three Persons,
Blessed Trinity!

For the Beauty of the Earth
(Singing Pathways, p. 164)

For the beauty of the earth, 
For the glory of the skies
For the love which from our birth
Over and around us lies.

Refrain:
Lord of all, to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise.

For the wonder of each hour
Of the day and of the night,
Hill and vale, and tree and flower, 
Sun and moon, and stars of light.

For the joy of human love,
Brother, sister, parent, child,
Friends on earth, and friends above,
For all gentle thoughts and mild.

For Thy church, that evermore
Lifteth holy hands above,
Off ring up on every shore
Her pure sacrifice of love.

Fairest Lord Jesus
(German)

1. Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature,
O Thou of God and man the son!
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor,
Thou, my soul's glory, joy and crown.

2. Fair are the meadows, Fairer still
the woodlands,
Robed in the blooming garb of spring; 
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

3. Fair is the sunshine, Fairer still the 
moonlight,
And all the twinkling starry host;
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines
purer
Than all the angels heav'n can boast.

Come Thou Almighty King
Come, Thou Almighty King,
Help us Thy name to sing,
Help us to praise; 
Father all glorious,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,
Ancient of days.

Come, Thou Incarnate Word,
Gird on Thy might sword,
Our pray'r attend;
Come and Thy people bless,
And give Thy word success,
Spirit of holiness,
On us descend.

Come, Holy Comforter,
Thy sacred witness bear,
In this glad hour;
Thou who almighty art, 
No rule in ev'ry heart,
And ne'er from us depart,
Spirit of pow'r.

To the great One in Three
Eternal praises be
Hence evermore,
His sov'reign majesty
May we in glory see, 
And to eternity,
Love and adore.
