there, uh, uh, I don' know, wa' it '38 or '40. . .or '28.  Storm
was in 'twenty-eight.  Um-hum, storm was in '28.  'Cause I met
George in '32.  An' ah, an' we's up there in, in '29 an' '30,
'31 [an' all] along in there, you, we, you's still pickin' up people's
skulls.  Some of 'em had, oh, all teeth in there, was in they 
mouth.  Gold?  [Pretty] Prettiest kind of gold, in, in they mouth.  They was
still pickin' 'em up about. . .
TL:  Do people pick up the skulls. . .
BJ:  Yeah, them week--
TL:  . . .to get the gold?
BJ:  Them weeked (wicked) folks would pick 'em up.  Well, they,
an' then, so, I know the peoples got the gold 'cause the peoples
would, other folks would take it an' carry it to Palm Beach.
     But anyway, one, one man had a big gamblin' house there.
An' he said he, he had a big skull.  He set it up on the table
there for. . .Jus', jus', jus' said long as he's -- somebody's haid,
that's the truth.  An' I'd look at that, I said, "What in the 
world is that?"  Said that's a skull he found an' he keep that
skull, you know.  Said, tell 'im, "Don't let 'em beat me."  (MUMBLES)
He call that his head, call that his gamblin' head.  Had that
head to go around wit' im'!  Ha, ha, ha!
     They're wicked peoples, that's all, just -- They ain't scared
a nothin'.  He had that skull.                               an' them.  He'd
go to fall an' lose, he'd take this old skull and chuck it back
over the wall.  Somebody's haid!
TL:  What?
BJ:  That's right.
TL:  You mean when he went to fall. . .
BJ:  I mean by losin' in the gamblin', in the skin game.  Take it. . .
