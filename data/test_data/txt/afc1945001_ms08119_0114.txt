(Joke)
Who rose up when the bugle blew?
Who for their home-land's life
and hope.
Stood aguard on the Balaan slope,
Keeping us from the slant-eyed crew?
Mac Arthur's men!

Who in the grime and dirt and muck
Lay in the shell-holes, slipped in
sand,
Died in the battle, gun in hand,
Fought like heroes and termed it luck?
Mac Arthur's men!
