The third flow for my Goodman and my little 
boy
May he be growing by day and may he be 
growing by night
With the sun of showers + with the moon 
of radiance
Pour little cow, with the  milk of pearlwort, the 
primrose + shamrocks benign
Pour, o milk, thick rich + thick that will 
give butter + curds 
And fatness for my man + my lovely boy.
- 
Thou who put beam in moon + sun
"" "" "" in ear + herd
"" "" "" put fish in stream + sea
Send the butter up be [?]ie
