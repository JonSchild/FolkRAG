My dear Sir:

I should like to report to your office that
we find your weekly broadcasts of Alan Lomax in songs
of America and Americans especially fine. We use his
program for all kinds of interesting preparatory
and follow-up assignments and discussions with the
children of my three elementary schools. For example,
his songs of the Teamsters some few weeks ago [was] were the
basis of a very fine unit of work on the ways in which
people express themselves. It has eventuated in a study
of not only music, but art and literature as a natural
expression of persons - an expression of the times,
the places and the lives of the people.

We feel that Mr. Lomax is doing a very fine
piece of work from an educational as well as from a
cultural point of view and I should like for you to
know that his broadcasts are a very fundamental part
of the program of my schools. We are trying to develop
in children the ability to critically evaluate the
quality of radio programs and to develop taste and
discrimination in the selection of programs for their
private and personal enjoyment, leading to a more
enriched type of leisure.

Please accept our thanks and our congratulations
upon the high type of work being done by Mr. Lomax.

Sincerely yours,

Ruth K Webb
Administrative Principal
