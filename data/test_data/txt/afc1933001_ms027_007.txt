Dear Thompson, 

This is to confirm the conversation betweenfather, you and
myself concerning the recording instrument you are to build
for us. After we had turned over to you our old recording
instrument, not including the microphone, you were to build
for us your recording instrument.
As we discussed it, this instrument was to have the following
features, among others:
         An amplifier of your own design which on test should 
have as flat a frequency characteristic curve as the amplifier
we have been lately using and should have sufficient power
surplus to take care of our recording problems as well as the
aforesaid amplifier.
         A belt driven cutting unit with oil-damped cutting head
which cuts about ninety grooves perinch or less, as you think
safe, knowing the recording problems we face, --* a cutting head
which has been so weighted to cut a groove about as deep as
the [?] cut  that Garwich makes.
         A tripod type collapseable mike stand.
         Our old speaker with a new cone installed in your set.
         Extra length of cable with plugs for microphone exten-
sion. 
         Complete wiring diagram and advice about batteries and
how best to charge the,
         Transcribing instrument. 

I have some recording to be done in South Hadley at Mount Holy0
oke. They have a Garwick machine, are very well satisfied, but
have had trouble with poorly machined discs. Please send or
take up, as soon as possible, to Mrs. Mills, Head of the Speech
Department, Mount Holyoke College, ten fifteen inch discs and
charge them to our account. 

I hope our delay in sending this letter to you has not kept you
from working on our instrument. We are anxious to have it as
soon as possible. Our address will be 400 East 34th St. , Auustin, 
Texas. 

Sincerely yours,
