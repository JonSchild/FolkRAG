is the enriching of the Congressional
Library's archives of folk
music, from versions and variations
of old folk songs and ballads
sent in to the offices by listeners
who have listened to the programs
and remembered the tunes or 
versus as they learned them.

Write Own Versions
   "The older people who remember
the ancient folk tunes write in
their own versions," Mr. Fineshriber
said. "The upshot of their
letters has been a good many valuable
contributions to the Congressional
Library's achieves." From
these oldsters have come a great
many of the 40,000 letters which
CBS received in six weeks this fall
in connection with its American
School of the Air broadcasts. As
far as the folk song series is concerned,
the other big fan mail 
classification comes from the
school children themselves.
   "Those letters are interesting,"
the director declared. "A lot of 
them contain verses the kids have
made up to the folk tunes we use
on the programs. For instance,
a kid will make up a song to sing
while riding his bicycle, and sing
it to a cowboy tune. That's the 
way folk music originated and
grew, in the first place."
   With the children the most popular
songs are the nonsense and courting
songs, Mr. Fineshriber revealed,
"Kids like simple tunes, one-line
melodies they can follow and remember
and sing," he said. "We 
often use these simple melodies to
introduce them to the more complicated,
composed music. We get a 
good composer to write a four-
minute symphony based on a folk
song theme, and play first the folk
song, then the theme, and then the 
spmphonic arrangement for the children.
They like it, and many of them
write in that perhaps this symphonic
music isn't so bad after all."
   All subjects are treated historically 
on the folk music series, with the
background of each type of song 
related and explained  to the youth-

WDBJ's studios tomorrow is the first
music broadcast Columbia has presented
outside of its own studios.
"We'd like to originate the programs 
more often in their own localities,"
said Mr. Fineshriber. The 
children like to hear music 'coming
from the place wheer it lives.' If 
it weren't for the difficulties of
broadcasting and the expense involved, 
we'd do it more often. Another 
reason we generally broadcast
from our new York studios is that,
believe it or not, a lot of folk music
talent is right there in New York."
   The square dance will be brought 
to the nation's radio listeners in its
purest form through the Columbia
Broadcasting system and the facilities
of the Times-Worth corporation's 
station, WDBJ, tomorrow
morning at 9:15 o'clock, when the
"Bog Trotters", folk musicians from
Galax, interpret for the classroom
audience of Columbia's American
School of the Air the square dance
tunes and ballads handed down to 
them by their ancestors. The program
is being presented as one of a
series devoted to the Folk Music of 
America.

First of Series
   It marks the second time in
WDBJ's history that the local station
has "fed the network" on a 
program.
   WDBJ's staff is assisting in the
production of the broadcast, and
Paul Reynolds, studio director for
WDBJ, will handle the annoucing
for the entire program, replacing
Columbia's Niles Welsh, regular
School of the Air announcer.
   Reynolds and Jack Weldon, program
director and educational director
of WDBJ, went Saturday to
Galax to meet Alan Lomax, "folk-
musician" and one of the directors
of the folk music program series,
and put finishing touches on Tuesday's
broadcast. The "Bog Trotters"
will come to Roanoke tomorrow for 
a studio dress rehearsal.

Two Broadcasts
   The broadcast is to be made twice
from WDBJ studios tomorrow to be 
carried both times by the local
station. The first broadcast, from
9:15 to 9:45 a. m., is for the east
and central portion of the United
States, and a re-broadcast from 3:35 
to 4 p. m. will reach the west.
   CBS directors of the folk music
series are Alan Lomax, Davidson
Taylor, assistant to CBS vice-president 
in charge of programs, and 
William Fineshriber.
   The "Bog Trotters" of Galax are
headed by Uncle Alec Dunford,
widely known fiddler in Carroll and 
Grayson counties, with Dr. W. P. 
Davis, Galax physician, acting as a 
sort of manager for the group.
   Uncle Alec plays the first fiddle, 
and Dr. Davis the autoharp. Other 
musicians are Uncle Davy Crockett
Ward, second fiddle; his brother
Wade Ward, banjo; and his son,
Fields Ward, the guitar. Fields does
most of the figure calling for dance
tunes, but the singing is swapped
around by Uncle Alec, Uncle Crockett,
Fields or Wade.
   The "Bog Trotters" have played at
the White Top Mountain folk music
festival, and several of its members
have won individual prizes there.
Uncle Alec Dunford has made several
recordings of mountain msuic,
including the Irish ballad, "Barney
McCoy".
