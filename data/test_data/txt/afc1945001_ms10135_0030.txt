Speaking of the four freedoms
"[B???!] Uncle Sam we would like
to have it in America, when
the strife of two is one.
No more segregation as we will
all be one; having fought for our
country, now the victory is won.

In our big free country of the
U.S.A. Now we are one abiding
by the rules of tax and rationing,
just as any body else. Buying 
bonds and stamps, is our duty
we all feel, And we are looking
for full freedom in the dear old states.

We will put forth our efforts
leaving school, on week end and
working on the farm, as there
is a shortage of labor, that we must
fulfill since they are at arms.
Many of my classmates are now in
the war, fighting for our country, not
just for a reward. I hope it will
be different when they return home. And
find their friends waiting for them.
