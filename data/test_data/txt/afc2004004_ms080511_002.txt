The wonder tales, the fairy tales that ah
fill our boo - books and ah delight our
children go back a very long time.  It seems
to me that ah, from what I can find out, their
function for centuries now has been to take
people gradually into sleep, prepare them for
dreams, and resolve in those tales some of
the conflicts of daily life.  Ah, anger against
a cruel father, a fear of being deserted by
the parent, desire of the little boy to ah, 
ah, admire his penis as much as he'd like to,
like in Jack in the Beanstalk, where he finds
the bean and then it gets bigger every day
and he keeps asking his mother to come and 
look and look, and finally then he climbs it
and finds the giant, his father, and kills
him, and the mother's there to admire it.

And the story, the stories have, have
removed those conflicts and prepared them -
prepared people to go into their deep sleep
and there to deal with more - with deeper
[*12. 02. 3? . . .*] psychological problems.
