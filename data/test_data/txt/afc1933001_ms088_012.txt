Dear Mr. Lomax:

I enclose extracts from the pressnotices and reviews of
The American Mother Goose.

I am extremely gratified that the reviewers almost without
exception received the book in the spirit I hoped they would.

I am slowly getting back up to sub-normal again, and am
organizing the information service for the Intelligence Unit of the
cantonment under construction here.

I have been asked to come to Austin for a PTA talk on December
17th. The only invitation I have felt like accepting, I'm not nearly so keen
on that sort of thing as I was when the book first came out.

Hoping you had a real nice thanksgiving,
Sincerely
Ray Wood.
