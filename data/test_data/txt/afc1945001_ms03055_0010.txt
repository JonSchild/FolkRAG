Seattle, Washington

The politicians will never win the war.  They don't understand between 
political action and war.  They think a war is a continuation of political
life.

Tacoma, Washington
August 13, 1942
A Mayjor of a large city said a man he knew well who was highly regarded
was ushered by an armed man at Boeing, where he was employed, off the Boeing
premises.
The Mayor said the guard shoved him a "blue FBI" slip, which ordered his
dismissal.
The man saw local FBI agent, who referred him to Washington.  He wrote
Washington FBI headquarters and was asked to submit "further evidence".  He
can submit no evidence because he doesn't know why he can't work at Boeings,
and he can get no explanation of any kind, the Mayor said.
