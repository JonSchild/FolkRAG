Fisk, 14.  6. WILL STARK

A"  What happened to these people, did they land in the insane asylum
or did some of them die or what?
B:  Some of them went crazy, went to Jackson to the crazy-house, to the
asylum.  Some of them got killed, and some of them just died.  And
some of them walked along the street and fell out; they'd eat the
brains up or something.
A:  They would take it, though, on the sly so that nobody saw them?
S:  Yessir, but out in the sawmill job they could take it any way they
wanted.  You know, this used to be a kind of outlaw country.  When they 
had saloons in Lamberth and all around these different country
places, that sell anything they wanted, and they could buy it.  They said
the people first learned to use it was-uh from the jockeys.  They used to us
it for the horses, and the jockeys would use it for their horses, you know,
and they got so they tried it themselves and they liked it and they
give it to the women, and the women started and used it and it got out among many of the men,
some of the men started to use it.
A:  When did the cocaine break up here in this country?
B:  I don't know exactly, when - I can't remember exactly.  It went out when
the saloons went out, that is, went out public but they could get
it from drugstores and places.
It's played out in this part of the country, they don't nobody use it now
that I know of.
A"  Did these people that used cocaine sing the song?
S:  Yessir.
A:  Would you sing for me now, Will -- what you remember?
