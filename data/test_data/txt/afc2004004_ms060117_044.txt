All of this, I hope, has made the point that I am most ready
and willing to get out of here and begin doing something
that has meaning.  If you can get the National Institute or
Rockefeller Grants, I'm with you very definitely.  The only
problem is the late date at which you will find out about
the grants.  I'd assumed that you'd re-applied with Rockefeller
a long time ago, and was hoping that you'd have some definite
info. by now.  Since I want to plan my summer according
to whether or not we can work together, [It] it is important
that I know as soon as possible about your plans for the summer.
at least.  If you do get one of the grants, when do you
want to begin?  Is there any possibility of our working
together this summer if neither grant comes through?

The man who teaches the course on South American Indians
that I'm now taking is one of the best anthropologists, as it
appears to me, now working in  outh America--Johannes Wilbert.
He is a physical anthropologist primarily, and his biggest
credit is the discovery of a new gene--"Diego"--which is a 
Mongloid indicator.  His results are fascinating--he has 
found that the Indians who are remnants of the high cultures
and also the tropical forest agriculturists are high in
percentage of the Diego gene.  The most primitive Indians
tested so far, the "marginals" and also the Eskimos are
Diego-negative.  His findings correlate with a recent hypothesis
that there were two great waves of migration from Asia.
one, called the Amurian, being Caucasoid (or "proto-Mongloid"),
the other, later one, being increasingly Mongoloid.
