BJ TAPE 20,  p. 11

       I wanna put one in the house so bad.  I don' wanna -- you know, so she can
git deaf an' then jus', you know, [can put it to] consider jus' sit down an'
talk on it.  An' don't  be jus' standin' back like she talkin' to somebody
a hun'red miles an' it's so sincerely.  Can't hardly get her
to talk, [on it] though, huh!  Ha, ha, yeah, it's funny.

TL:      You said that you never felt this way about your grandchildren, 
did you?  You never felt as close to them as your
daughter?
BJ:      Yeah!  Jus' as...
TL:      You felt closer to them?
BJ:       It's jus' as close...I feel...Well, in this way, I feel
real close, because, ah, ya see, that's my branch!  You, you
know.  An' then I had longed for children; I longed to have that.
An' I feel like that was a blessing from God; I feel like He
answered my prayer.  Ya see, that's why I feel so close to them
'cause I feel like it's a prayer-answerin' thing.  See, I was
without children so long, ya see.  W-w-with jus' that one daughter?
And then, ah, it's 21 years an' so...She came like a sister.  See,
I wanted more chirrun; I wanted somebody else with her an' wit'
myself.  I jus' wanted to see sumpin' of myself.
          Jus' like I am about this work I'm doin' now.  I wanted to know
sumpin' about myself an' I wanted myself to go further than me.
You know, jus' me.  Heh!  I swear, I could just die an', in this
world, without a chil', without anybody, without anything, you just...
you just up here.  That's all; jus' sumpin' come up an' died;
that's all.  But see, if I pass away now, I, I'm yet alive.   You
know, wit' my chirrun, ya see?  On an' on 'till the Lawd move
'em off, the last seed off the earth.  Well, [He move] when they movin' me an' I
ain't got none, the seed is gone complete.  Ya [know] see?  Hear folks
