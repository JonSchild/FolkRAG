Mr. Alan Lomax
c/o Columbia Broadcasting System
485 Madison Avenue
New York City, N. Y.

Dear Sir:

I am interested in learning the origin of 
the song "Alla En El Rancho Grande" which appears in
 the book entitled "American Ballads and Folk Song" 
at page 361, edited by your father and yourself.

[*Conceones Mexicanas*]

Yesterday, I wrote your father c/o Macmillan 
Publishers, but today learned of your being in the City
 and would like very much to interview you in regard to
 this song.

If you will please telephone my office upon 
receipt of letter whether it will be convenient for
 you to meet me, I will be very glad to call upon you.

Thanking you in advance, I am

Very truly yours,

William H. Darrow
