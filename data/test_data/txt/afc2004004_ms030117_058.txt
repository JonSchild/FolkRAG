ruint h uh.  I'm tellin you straight, jes don't mess wid me bout
what I want.  I'm tellin you what I want, an you gittin up offerin
me somethin else.  If you ain't gon give me what I want,
don't offer me nothin.  I ain't gon do no talkin wid you either,
cause. . .
     I'm gon tell you another thang, too.  A woman know jes
exactly what way to whup a man.  Specially one don't b'lieve in
fightin.  She wait till the bedtime.  She know.  She wait till the
bedtime, and you come in an say you want so-and-so.  She wait till
you got your han on it, then she tell you you ain't gon get it.
     (You think this is a form of revenge?)
     Naw.  She know she can't fight, you understand.  Thass the
way she'll do it. . . Don't you hate to have yo'sef made up fur a thing,
k now yo u're gon git it, and then time you git where i t is, then
miss it?  (laughs)  I'd ruther fur you to fight me than do me like that.

want."  That's when I'm lookin fur it, thinkin I'm gon git it, then
think I'm gon miss it.  (he laughs)  I  don't wanna miss it.  I don't
care what kina hell you gimme, jus gimme that fust.  Cause you see,
we ain't nothing but yall's babies.  You understan.  Sometime in my
life cry fur a thang, an then you don't give it to me.  Now you know,
that's bad stuff.  Man go out chere, work all day long fur his glory,
then sometimes git a cussin out fur his glory. . .lots of stuff like
that.  Then, what she do do, she don't do with no sperrit, cause she
don't want it nohow.  A man can pretty much tell when he git holt of a 
woman like that.  She don't want to be boddered wid him.  Hurryin him
up.  (we both laugh)  Tryin to make him break off.  Fo time.  Settin a
time fur him.
