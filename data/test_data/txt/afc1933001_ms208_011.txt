of letters from you (including your
notes.) Presently I'll go to the Express
office to see if the records have 
come we'll nove from here
- I think on to Atlanta. I find
that the "Society for the Preservation 
of Negro Spirituals" has bought 
one of Garwick's machine's. There
is no need of our work here 
since I believe Mr. Spivacke
can get copies of everything the 
Society makes - or I can when 
I can apply officially on crested
paper and envelopes. Tell Water's
I asked about his Introduction, 
the last item in the book on 
which cost estimates are now being 
made. I think they will move 
him. I'm sorry to heat of Elizabeth's 
sickness. Neither of you have
the constitution to withstand late hours or 
any other extra drafts on your strength. Father

[*Tell Mr. Spivacke on account of no electricity 
Mrs. Wilson was forced to bring 22 negroes into 
Charleston, hire a hall, etc. I hope he will allow 
a small expense bill.*]
