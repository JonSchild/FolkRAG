an' you can look in them places, an' see it, written up on the
bottle.  Done put a label on.  Says, "Georgia Co'n." Tha's right.
An' they ain' tellin' ya -- ya know, they let you know it's
moonshine.  They may have it colored, some of it.  An' some of
it ain't.  Some if it real yella-lookin'.  You know, jus' like

[*HOW TO DISGUISE MOONSHINE*]
I used to color it, myse'f.  You can color it with. . . you 
can take, ah, brown sugar.  I mean, [talk] take sugar, real sugar,
an' brown it.  You know, not brown sugar, but git the white
sugar an' put in a -- jus' like you gonna make syrup outa sugar.
Then, you know, jus' let it brown.  An' hit'll turn red.  Then
you jus' put it right into that whiskey an' it'll sweeten it,
throw a kick to it and turn it color.  Make it red like that
other red whiskey.  Jus' like red whiskey.
         Den you can go to the drug stores, anâ€™ you know, places where you
can git it, an' buy you some gin flavor.  An' let it stay white,
an' it'll taste an' look jest like gin.  You got it [clean] clear, you
see?  Anybody what don't know will say they drinkin' gin.  Put it
in your gin bottle             .  A lota that cheap stuff is just
what it is.  See?
         And then, then you take an' get you some -- ah, what that? rye? --
rye flavor.  I know a girl used to git it.  Git rye flavor an'
then, an' ah, pour it, pour it in, [put,] put you a little rye
flavor in it, a gallon, an' turn it an' make it smell jus' like
rye.  Yessuh.
         Then rum flavor.  Put it on in there.  An' let it sit. (?)
[An' it, it] They, they jus' change it an' it be the straight-out [loo] ol'
moonshine.
