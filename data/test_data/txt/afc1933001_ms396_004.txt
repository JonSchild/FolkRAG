Mybe it is only a fancy that I recall this scene; maybe it never happened at all.
But it is true that in Bosque County, Texas, [began] my first interest in cowboy
songs.  And from [my love of] cowboy songs my [my enthusiasm spread] to all types of our native
folk songs.  Here [was born for me an absorbing
avocation  Copy main manuscript]

It is always a dramatic moment for anyone when his own voice comes back to
him undistorted from the black mouth of a loud speaker.  He seems to feel the intense and
absorbing pleasure that a child experiences when he first recognizes himself in a mirror.
One old hard-bitten Mexican vaquero in the mesquite country of Southwest Texas, when his
song was played to him unexpectedly, said with soft amazement, "Madre de Dios", then after 
a time, "Muy hombre!"  A Negro prisoner, wishing to communicate his extravagant uncontrollable
surprise, fell flat on his back and lay there until his buddies picked him up.
A mountaineer, when asked if he would like to hear his record played back, said, "I reckon 
so.  Anything I do onct, I'll do hit twict."  "Ain't men got sharp?" he added when the
record was finished.  "A man can't stutter none talkin' into one of them things; got to
stick to palin English.  If he don't, hit'll tell on him."  On hearing his voice come back
an Alabama Negro exclaimed, "Dat's pure hit!"  Another decided, "That machine can sho'
beat me singin'".
Negro singers particularly respond to any opportunity to dramatize a recording.
Whenever we have asked a man to sing a levee camp song and to record along with the song
his shouts at the mules, the resulting record has been rich with improvised mule talk and 
imitations of the cracking of the mule-skinner's long whip.  Again, a group of prisoners
singing a work song will dramatize the work-gang scene for the record by imitating the
sounds of their picks and axes, shouting out remarks about the hot sun and hard work,
just as they do in the fields, sometimes imitating the voice of the captain and the walking-
boss, giving their orders.
