 A Rumor that Tickled Me 

One of the first rumors of 
of the war that I heard was 
that the United States was going 
to win the war in six months
That rumor got some people once
confidend. But of course that was 
the purpose. It was supposed to
get the peopl over optimistic
and make them stop putting
all of thier effort into the
war. It tickled me because
I knew the rumors purpose therfor
I tried my best to stop it
