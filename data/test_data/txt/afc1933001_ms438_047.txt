New Blacksnake Moan*

Lead Belly Sings:
Oh---, I ain' got no mammy now,
Oh----, I ain' got no mammy now,
She tol' me late las' night," You didn' need no mammy nohow."

Oh---, blacksnake crawlin' in my room, **
Oh---, blacksnake crawlin' in my room,
Better tell somebody better come get this old blacksnake soon.

Oh,---, musta been a bed-bug 'cause a chinch couldn' bite me
dat hard,
Oh---, musta been a bed-bug 'cause a chinch can't bite me dat 
hard,
Ask my sugar for fifty cents say, "Ledbetter, they ain' a child in
de yard."

Honey that's all right, that's all right for you,
Honey that's all right, that's all right for you,
Darlin, that's all right, mos' any ol' way will do.

Lead Belly Speaks:
I walked up to my baby. An' I knowed anything she done was all right
wid me. It was O.K. wid me. Jus' [mos'] anything she done (why it)
d satisfyd me. I walked [to] up to her an' wanted to know what' s de
matter.

Lead Belly Sings:
Um---, honey, what's de matter now?
Um---, honey, what's de matter now?
Darlin', tell me what's de matter, don' like no blacksnake nohow.

Well, wonder where dat [blacksanek] blacksnake gone?
Well, wonder where dat blacksnake gone?
Dat ol' blacksnake, mama, done ruin my darlin' home.

Oh---, I ain' got no mammy now,
Oh----, I ain' got no mammy now,
She tol' me late las' night, "You didn' need no mammy nohow."

Um---, wonder where dat blacksnake gone?
Um---, wonder where dat blacksnake gone?
Dat ol' blacksnake, mama, done ruin my darlin' home.
