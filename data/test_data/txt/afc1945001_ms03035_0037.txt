-13- MICHIGAN

Detroit Bombed by October 1
Sidewalk rumor supposed to be directly from horse's mouth:
"Gamblers are laying even money that Detroit will be bombed by October 1."
Largest operator in Detroit says to this: "It isn't true that bets are
being made on any such proposition."

Second Front
The Governor's press secretary reported August 11 that he had
talked August 10 with "an engineer who should know better, who is a public
official and who has a master's degree from University of Michigan, who
said: "Well, all my friends tell me that the President isn't going to [*3*]
open a second front until after the election." Since the engineer eats and
plays bridge with "the whole faculty crowd at State College," the 
Governor's spokesman thinks the engineer probably reflects what the faculty
is saying.
Despite a CIO second-front rally of war workers in a Detroit
public square August 13 (newspapers estimated crowd at 10,000) public
reaction is that CIO was away off base on the subject.
According to Governor's office, obviously the left wing of the
union movement was behind the rally and the Governor, addressing the [*4*]
crowd, stressed that "our job is one of production to make ready for the
time when the President and his military advisers decide to open a second
front. I know that I and none of you have the information on which to
base any recommendation to them as to when that should be done."
