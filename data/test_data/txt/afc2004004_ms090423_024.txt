hand and her petticoat around her neck, had nipples on her
tits as big as a plum, hairs on her cock make a dean man
come. You could tell she was pregnant by the shape of her
belly; her ass was shaking like a plate of jelly. She says
"Shine old boy, come save po' me. I'll give you anything 
your eyes can see." But Shine said, "Your petticoat look
low and your words may be true, but there's women on the
shore that's got better booty than you."

Just then Shine swam to the New York shore, where they
was betting a dollar and a dollar more. 31.

In all probability this story and others like it ar not
indigenous: these stories reflect a considerable urban influence. The
fact that on the plantation the stories about Hitler and other international
characters exist, shows clearly that the plantation is no 
longer an isolated world. The plantation Negroes are becoming
increasingly aware of world affairs.

Hitler called the devil up on the telephone on day,
The girl at central listened to all they had to say,
"Hello", she heard Hitler say, "Is old man Satan at home?
Just tell him it's the dictator who wants him on the phone."

The devil said, "Howdy", and Hitler, "How are you?"
"What can I do", the Devil said, "dear old pal of mine?
"It seems you don't need any help-you're doing mighty fine."

"Yes, I was doing very good until a while ago,
When a man named Roosevelt wired me to go more slow.
He said to me, "Dear Hitler, we don't want to be unkind.
But you have raised hell enough, so you'd better change your mind."

I thought his lease-lend bill was bluff, and he could never
get it through,
But he soon put me on the spot, when he showed what he could do,
Now that's why I called you, Satan-I need advice from you.
For I know that you will tell me just what I ought to do."

My dear Hitler, there's not much left to tell,
For Uncle Sam will make it hotter than I can here in hell,
I have been a mean old devil, but not as half as mean as you
So the minute that you get here the job is yours to do."
