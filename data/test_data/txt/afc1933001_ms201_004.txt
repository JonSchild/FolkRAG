Dear Alan
Your letter of February 21 arrived while 
I was in California and so has just come to my 
attention. Its contents sound very interesting
but inasmuch as neither of the two documents 
which you said were attached arrived in the 
envelope, I am really in no position to comment.
Will you please send us these; then I shall be
glad to write you again.

Sincerely, 

Harold Spivacke
