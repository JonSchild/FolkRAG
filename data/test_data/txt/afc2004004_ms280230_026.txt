TAPE 8. EWAN MCCOLL:
True Thomas:
1) True Thomas lay on Huntley Bank
A ferlie he spied wi' his eye,
And there he saw a lady bricht
Come riding by the Eildon tree.

2) Her skirt was o' the grass-green silk
Her mantle o' the velvet fine.
At ilka tett o' her horse's mane
Hung fifty siller bells and nine.

3) True Thomas pulled off his cap
And laid it low down tae his knee.
"O hail, thou muckle Queen of Heaven.
For thy peer on earth I never did see."

4) "Oh no, oh no, true Thomas," she said,
That name does not belong to me.
I am the queen of fair Elf-land
That am hither come to visit theee."

5) "Harp and carp, True Thomas," she said,
"Harp and carp" along with me.
And if ye dare to kiss my lips,
Sure of your body I will be."

6) "Betide me weel, betide me weel,
That weird shall never daunten me."
Sine he has kissed her rosy lips
All underneath the Eildon tree.

7) "Noo ye maun gang wi' me," she said,
"True Thomas, ye maun gang wi' me.
And ye maun serve me seven years
Through weel and woe as may chance to be."

8) She mounted on her milk-white steed,
She's ta'en True Thomas up behind.
And aye whene'er her bridle rung
Her steed flew swifter than the wind.

9) O they rade on and farther on,
The steed gaed swifter than the wind.
Until they reached a desert wide
And living land was left behind.
