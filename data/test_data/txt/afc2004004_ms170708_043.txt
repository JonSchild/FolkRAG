10.
Seven gypsies all in a gang,
They were brisk an' bonny-o,
They rode till they came to the Earl o' Cassel's hall,
An' there they sang so sweetly-o;
Sweetly-o, sweetly-o,
They rode till they came to the Earl o' Cassel's hall,
And there they sang so sweetly-o.

They so sweet an' so complete,
Till downstairs came a lady-o,
An' as soon as they saw her pretty, pretty face
They cast the gabril (?) over her;
Over her, over her,
An' as soon as they saw her pretty, pretty face
They cast the gabril over her.

She gave to them a bottle of wine,
She gave to them some money-o,
She gave to them some far finger things,
Was the gold rings off her fingers-o. etc.

So she pulled off her high heeled boots,
Put on her highland plaidie-o,
"Last night I slep with me own wedded lord,
An' tonight with the gypsy's laddie-o. etc.

When her dear lord came home that night,
Inquirin' for his lady-o,
The waitin' maid made this reply,
"She is gone with the blackhearted gypsies-o. etc.

So come saddle me my best black horse,
Come saddle it quite swiftly-o,
So I may search for me own wedded wife
Who's gone with the blackhearted gypsies -

That's too much about gypsies, anyhow. You                  That
ain't all of it though.
Kennedy: There's more yet?
Cox: Yeah.
So he rode high an' he rode low,
He rode brisk an' bonny-o,
He rode till he came to a far waterside,
An' there he spied his lady-o etc.
