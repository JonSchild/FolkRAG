3) Then she gave one big jump & she gave one big leap,
From the rocks that was high to the sea that was deep,
Crying, "Ocean shells shall now be my bed,
And the shrimps go wiggle-wiggle right over my head."

Black Beetles: The dire history of Mary Arnold, the female monster. . . .
1) Of all the tales was ever told I now will you impart,
That cannot fail to terror strike to every human heart.
The deeds of Mary Arnold who does in a jail deplore,
O such a dreadful tale as this was never told before.
This wretched woman's dreadful deed does everyone alright,
With black beetles and walnut shells she deprived her child of sight.

Now think, you tender parents what must the monster feel?
The heart within her breat must ten times harder be than steel.
The dreadful crime she did commit does all the world surprise,
Black beetles placed in walnut shells bound round her infant's eyes.
The beetles in a walnut shell, this monster she did place,
This dreadful deed, as you may read, all history does disgrace.
The walnut shells and bettles with a bandage were bound tight,
Round her infant's tender eyes to take away it's sight.

A lady saw the monster in the street when passing by,
She was struck with terror for to hear the infant cry.
The infanT's face she swore to see, which filled her with surprise,
To see the fatal bandage bound the infant's eyes.

With speed she called an officer who, shocking to relate,
Who beheld the dead and took the rich before the magistrate.
Who committed her for trial which did the rich displease
And now she's transported ten long years across the briny seas,

Is there another in this world could plan such wicked deeds?
Never upon this earth before of such did ever see,
To take away her infant's sight, 'tis horrible to tell,
Binding black beetles round its eyes, blighted in walnut shells.
