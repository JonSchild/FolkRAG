No, It don't bothah me....(long pause) You know, when 
you come up like that, you understan, you're able to consolate 
anybody.
(That's true. You have something to say.)  
Uh-huh.  A plenty.  A plenty.
(Do you feel you could say something to console 
a person even if they lost their dearest relatives -- their child, 
their mother....?)
Do I feel like that I could consolate em? (he blows 
his nose. water runs from his nostrils constantly today)  Yes.  
If I could ever once git their tention. Git em still enough to 
listen at me. I could.
(Why don't you lie down on the bed over there, Rev. Davis? You --)
(positively) I don't want no bed.
(You're been losing sleep.)
Don't want no bed. What could I do wid a bed?
(Well...You can just lie down and take a little snooze 
and get really relaxed....Pat will be back after a while, and maybe 
then you'll feel a little fresher. Do a little more talking.)
I feel all right now. Sho.
(I thought you were dozing again.)
Mmmm-hmmm! I feel all right now.
(What's your favorite verse out of the Bible?)
"Let not your heart be troubled..." ..."For if you 
believe in God, you believe also in me." ....Thass one of the favorites chapters evah was.  Yeah.  That Scripture is the world's consolation.  
where the consolation come in, the man who said it knowed what he 
was talkin bout. Jesus Himself spoke those words.
