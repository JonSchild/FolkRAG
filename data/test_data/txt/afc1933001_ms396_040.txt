By this time the ponies would be on a dead run,their shod feet striking spurts of sparks from the flinty roadway. Bob Hanna and his crew were on the rampage. Once in a while a group of grim-faced deputy sheriffs would follow these wanton dis-turbers of the peace. Bob and his merry partners would sober up in the Meridian jail to the tune of the old jail ballad:
As to ddrinkin' and gamblin', I never shall fail,
And I don't give a damn for lyin' in jail;
But it's hard times in the Meridian jail,
It's hard times,po' boys.
The chuck they give us is beef and cornbread,
As old as hell and as heavy as lead.
It's hard times in the Meridian Jail,
It's hard times,po' boys.
But Bob had many friends.Soon he would be free again. And soon he w ould be away to West Texas and up the trail to Kansas,hightailing a big herd of longhorn cattle.
Through Bob and his like my interest in folk tunes was kept active. The drift-ing herds of longhorns with their singing night-herders, their crooning cattle calls, wound through the Bosque hills. I absorbed the romance of these times, just as a plant absorbs the rain and sunshine. My father used to say that he came from Mississippi to Texas to give us his eight boys room to expand. Books were few. The outside world lived for us through weekly visits of the New York Sun. Magazines and books were scarce, the nearest railro ad fifty miles away;neighbors lived miles apart. Thus we were thrown on our own resources for much of our entertainment. On the long winter nights the fami-ly gathered around the big,open fire-place,burning a huge liveoak backlog,flanked by foresticks of pungent smelling cedar. Then often we sang and told stories. My older sister Mary and my mother had brought from Mississippi and Alabama stores of tales and folk tunes. "Silly Boy" always seemed to me young and defenceless and stupid.
