really see the deeps of this world.  Really and truly, I could just look 
out when they singin' it, you know 'bout this dark old world look like
to me that angels they is up in heaven and they would just look 
down in the deeps and the darkness, in this sad old world.    Just dark, 
it was a place you know a darkness, a deeps and it look like to me I
could just picture it in my mind.    It would make me completely cry.   It
was sad to think about how it was then or you want me to say how it is 
now.   Then God the one that came down it seem there something in it that 
make me feel like that it was somebody had something in mind somewhere 
You know to pity for something to be done here on , you know to be made 
here 'cause they say God come out from nowhere, you know to somewhere
and he made everything out of nothing.   You see and so there is something
to be thought about you know.   What kind of man is this he says like a 
what his name is like told Ananias ask you what king of man he is when 
he come across the sea and told the wind to be still and the wind be 
still and told the water to be still and still is still until today.
He ain't yet told it to move no more.   That's why today is still ['cause]
called the Dead Sea.   It's still still.   And you see it obeyed God.
It better than man and then they, when they look back and see all this
is done, the wind done stood still and the water stood still and yet
man won't obey God.
