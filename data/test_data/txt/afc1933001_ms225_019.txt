Dear Alan:  I want you to send
me at once copies of at least
a dozen of our best songs for
playing at the Town and Club and
also before a group of Dallas
musicians, both by special request.
I can return the records
promptly or they can be an
installment on the 50 records Mr
Spivacke has promised to send
me.  I sent you a list of the
songs I wanted, but you have
never acknowledged my letter.
   If you will send the
records, I wish to know definitely
when; if you can't
