Two creeds, the Methodist and the Baptist, number in their 
membership the majority of the Negroes who attach themselves to 
churches.  Church loyalty often crops out in their church songs.

I'm been down to the river and been baptized;
When I git my wings on, to heaven I'll rise.

Some says John was a Mefodes
And some says John was a Jew,
But de Holy Bible tells us
Dat John was a Baptist, too.

Medith, Medith is my name
Medith until I die
I have been baptized in Jesus' name
Gwine to stay on Methodis' side.

Some come cripple and some come lame
But dey went away walkin' in Jesus' name
Some come deef and some come dum'
But dey went away talkin' in Jesus' tongue.

I'll be a Mefodes until I die
And lib on good ole Mefodes' pie
Mefodes, Mefodes is my name
I hope to lib and die de same.

I tell you what I like de best
It is dem shoutin Mefodes.

I'm Baptis[t]' bred and Baptis' bon
Gwine t' heaven wid de angels
And when I die dey's Baptis' gon
Gwine t' heaven wid de angels.

I'm so glad, I don't know what about,
O good Lord!
Sprinklin' and pourin's done played out,
O good Lord!

Methodis preacher, your are dead;
You poured water on the baby's head.
Baptis' preacher, you are right
Cause you take dem candidates out o' sight.

Come to de river to be baptized
Stepped on a  root an' I got capsized
De water was deep an' de preacher was weak
So de nigger went to Heaven from de bottom of the creek
