Dear Sir,

Your friend, Noel Stevenson, was kind enough to give me your address.  Perhaps he has told you that I'm trying to put together a collection of living Scots folk songs.  I have made extremely beautiful records in the Hebrides, and in Buchan, and have a few examples of Lowland folk music, but would like to record a bit more, so that the portrait of Scotland can be complete.  Mr. Stevenson encouraged me to believe that you might know some local singers who still have the ballads in the oral way.  If you do, I can come down with my Magnecord and visit them and take the records for my purpose as well as for deposit in the BBC Library, the Library of Congress, and so on.

In expectation of an early reply,
I remain,
Yours sincerely,

(Alan Lomax)
