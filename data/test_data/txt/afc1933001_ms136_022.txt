My dear Mr. Lomax:

I was very glad indeed to receive your letter of June 30 and to know that
the Writers' Project and other in Indiana were of assistance to you in
procuring folklore material. We on the Writers' Project were very glad to
help you. We have in Indianapolis several groups of foreign people who
were ready then and will be ready again to assist you in folk songs if you
can give us sufficient advance notice of your coming.

We hope that we can arrange for further service for Miss Sudie Knight and
Miss Lauana Creel to collect folklore material and are glad to know that
they seem to have special ability in this line.

We are mailing under separate cover the following songs as per your
request.

Those with music are:

The Girl with her Dog and Gun
Pretty Maid Out in the Garden
The Steamer Little Clyde
Gambling on the Sabbath Day
The Bumble Bee Joe
An Old Fashioned Singing in Crawford County, or
The Seventh One Drowned Thee
Happy as a Birdie
The House Carpenter
Shoo Fly Don't Bother Me

Those without music are:

The Ballad of the Green Willow Tree
The Ballad of Fair Ellendar and Sweet William
On the Banks of the Sweet Dundee
The Roving Soldier
There Was an Old Man
You Bet I was a Different Lad When I Left Arkansas
