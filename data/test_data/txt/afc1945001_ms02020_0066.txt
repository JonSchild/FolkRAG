Criticism of Government efficiency is heard, particularly
regarding the war effort. Stories are current that, "there really
isn't much fog in the Aleutian Islands, and even if there is, the
Japs should have as much trouble as the United States." This is
a very general opinion which has been expressed by a banker, a
college professor, a retired British Army officer and a clerk in
a local store within the past ten days.
Anti-British rumors are probably in the majority with
Japanese rumors close behind. Stories concerning shipyard and
airplane hiring and war profits have lessened during the past month
or two. Criticism of the Government in handling the war seems to
be growing as given expression by stories that the Japanese are
winning the initiative in Alaska and Government contracts are being
cancelled.
