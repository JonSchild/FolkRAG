Offer of Prof. John A. Lomax

Herewith a letter from Prof. John A. Lomax, 214 First St.
S.E. Washington, offering, subject to your approval, to serve
without compensation in the capacity of consultant in American
Folk-songs.
If the offer of Professor Lomax is accepted, it would seem
advisable if a letter were addressed by you to Mr. R.W. Gordon,
6400 Georgia Ave. N.W., notifying him that such services as he
had kindly offered to render -- after his separation from the
Library staff -- would no longer required. This should terminate
Mr. Gordon's "Semi-official status" in which, I believe,he
regards himself to be at present.
