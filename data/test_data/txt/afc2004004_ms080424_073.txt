(AL) had this for 70000 years. . . .but you all made 'em right here in the 
mountains now.
Stan:  Yeah, just made here in the mountains.
AL:  Children's toys.  And then adults use 'em for the serenading.
Stan:  Yeah, that's right. . .. 
Hat:  Right here is the corn shucker's (unint) my daddy used.
Stan:  They made the small ones you see for the children to play with
Hat:  That's why Stanley shucked. . .
Stan:  That's what you shuck corn with, dad made 'em.  See, you couldn't buy
anything, had no money to buy it with.  So you put that on there and went
to your shuckin'.  Which just would be your corn, you know, you'd pull
the skin off of it and then you'd break it off.
AL:  We oughta get an ear of corn and see that done.
Stan:  There's some in the garden out there.
AL:  OK we'll do that later, go ahead.  You just keep on carvin' your thing. . .
Hat:  And right here's a bumble bee house.
AL:  You mean a real bumble bee house?
Hat:  A real bumblebee house.
AL:  Tell us all about that.
Hat:  See, they'd go in here and make their nest, and make their honey in
here, in these little houses.
AL:  One bumblebee.
Hat:  No, there's a lot that could go in, you see that's hollowed out in there.
AL:  You hang it in a tree.
Hat:  Yeah, hang it in the tree or in your porch.
AL:  I'd be dogged if I wanted it. . .!  Do people actually use that thing?
Stan:  Yeah they had 'em back then. . .
Hat:  Right here's a rubber band gun. . .
