Another gentleman expressed a rather strong opinion that not
only he but the public in general had lost faith in the Congress; that
they respected the ability and foresight of the President but that
Congress was composed largely of politicians and not statesmen; that
we were losing the war and would continue to lose the war unless the
President took a firmer stand in his prosecution of the war. This
gentleman expressed his desire that the President become more dictatorial 
in the future than he had in the past.
