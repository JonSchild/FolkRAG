                                            11.
Christmas Eve come. An' here come de magister ridin' up in he fine car, bringin' de fruit an' de Christmas to de mans on de gang. All git dey portion except me. I ain't make no move till I hears Mister Higgins say,
     "One man ain't got his share. Where Mike?"
     An' de boss tell him I musta been in de kitchen, dat it look like he jest  can't keep Mike outn de kitchen. An' when dey calls me, Mister Higgins say,
     "What you got to carry back to town, Mike?"
     An' I say, "Nothin' but shoe, Cap'n! Nothin' but shoe!"
     "Ready? Less us go."
     An' dat been three o'clock. At six we been sittin' in de magister's kitchen. An' whiles I set there by de stove a-watchin' de cook workin' over a fat turkey, an' a-smellin' ginger-bread in de oven, I hears Mister Higgens talkin' to he wife:
     "Man ain't done nothin'. Hate to leave de boy way from he chillun an' it Christmas. Must give him one of my pipes an' tobacco, an' a little Christmas."
     An' he wife say, "I got two sack of orange. One enough for us, ain't it? An' dey is a extry little red waggon. Is Mike got chillun?"
     An' before I think I calls out so she can hear me, "Seven head, Missus! Seven head!"
     Den she ask dey age an' how many been gal chile. An' she ask can dey read book. I tell her how de oldest in de fifth grade. An' while she is fixin' up some sack an' little red stockin', de Cap'n come walkin' back into de kitchen. I well remembers dat. It was a warm sweet smellin' place. Dere was boxes all pile up on de table an' tied with ribbon.
