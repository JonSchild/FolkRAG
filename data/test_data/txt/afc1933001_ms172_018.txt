Dear Bill:

Enclosed is a telephone bill which 
was incurred doubtless in relation to
 the School of the Air for last year. 
For some reason it has come back to the 
Library and I wish you would take care 
of this.

The Accounting Office has not yet 
written me about the other matter that 
is still pending. I need the money very 
badly and wish you would please call 
them up.

Things, particularly documentary 
things, are blooming this way.

Best regards,
