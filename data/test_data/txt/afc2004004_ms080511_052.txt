The traditions hang on and it's what makes
the mountains so fascinating.  You know,
there's been a lot of feeling that ah coal
mining and ind - industrialisation and roads
and so on have, have really ruined this part. 
of the country.   But on this trip I found that,
that it wasn't the case.  Although there has
- there has been a lot of change. ah. . .the
bluegrass music has speeded up this - the
fiddle tune in, in, in, into an unbelievably
fast tempo.  Ah, there, there are dances that
ah would do justice to the - to a can-can
theatre in Paris, and, and ah, so on.  But
again all the old Scots Irish resiliency is showing
up, and although these changes have happened
they're always - they've all been coloured
and adapted to the old models of communication
that ah, that these people have pli - have,
have cherished since time immemorial.  Ah, even
things that they learned from the blacks they
have adapted to their own purposes.

Ah, the guitar playing, for example.  Very
interesting way of handling the guitar that
Merle Travis and others developed, by ah seeing
blacks play the guitar.
