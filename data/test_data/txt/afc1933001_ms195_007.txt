TAKE ME HOME, POOR JULIA
Way down on the old Peedee,
Among de cotton an' cane,
O' the cabins I could make
And the buildin's I could build,
On the banks of the old Peedee.

CHORUS: Take me home, poor Julia, take me home,
                  Take me home, poor Julia, take me home,
                  For I have no place for to lay my head,
                  But to lay in poor Julia's arms.

One morning when I was a-walkin',
O the sun was just a half an hour high,
I travelled till the green grass grew up to my knees,
Miss Julia hung her head and she cried. CHORUS

Miss Julia and I were sleepin'
When death came a-knockin' at the door,
Miss Julia was a-sleepin' by my side
On the banks of Old-hio.* CHORUS

You may bury me in my coffin,
Don't bury so deeply in my grave,
Doesn't make no difference where you bury my body,
Gonna rise up at the [ressurr]resurrection day. CHORUS
