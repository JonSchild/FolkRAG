BJ TAPE 15, p. 85

     An' den I hear them talkin' about how ya shouldn't be proud,
ya know, an' all stuck on yourself.  Lookin' over everybody, ya
see?  Because, after you look over this, this good thing, this
bad thing there -- you think is bad -- 'at's the good thing, you
reach out there an' git the devil, them beautified things.  'Cause
then they go on to say that, "Pretty is skin deep an' ugly to the
bone," you know?  An'. "Pretty face an' ugly keeps his own."
An' so tha's why they, they, they was showin' the peoples about
all those things.  You know, I would 'member how they used to tell that
thing.
AL:  How old were you then?
BJ:  Oh, I guess around. . .ow, 8, 8 or 10, in there, 'cause we,
we lef' home when I was 'tween 'leven an' 12.  I's jus' around 8
or 10, 'cause I used to set down an' listen to them.  I know I
heard it 'fore then, but I 'member it right 'long in then.  Aunt
Marg'ret used to tell that thing an' jus' stand up an' just take
her hand an' just preach about how the devil'll fool ya, huh!
Huh, jus' the devil. . .the devil will fool ya down in hell!  But,
here the point is:  When ya leavin' the devil, put sumpin' between
ya.  An' I couldn't see what in the world that could be, between
'im.  An', ya know, 'till i got up good-sized then an' tell the
story, then it come to me, ya see?  That the wheat was put there,
sumpin', an' den that iron bridge, an' den the water.
But ya got to cross on over, see?  Ya got to put sumpin' between
you.  An', an', jus', jus' like, I hear some folks say about married
peoples?  They say, "They ain't parted.  'Cause they ain't
got no divo'ce."  Ya see?  Ya got to put sumpin' between ya.  The
same thing with the devil, ya know, an' all that kinda stuff.  See?
So that's jus' the way that was.
