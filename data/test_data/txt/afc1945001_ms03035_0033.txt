Rationing
A Dearborn, Michigan, housewife telephoned a friend the
evening of August 14 and said: "All groceries are to be closed
tomorrow? All canned goods are to be frozen and rationed from now on.
A friend told me. She just went out and bought $20 worth of canned 
goods."
A check this morning with Kroger and A & P stores in Dearborn
indicates the rumor was strictly local. Their managers hadn't heard of it.
Kroger district management: "Most fertile field for rumors of
this character is the predominantly Polish city of Hamtramck, Michigan,
where we get constant buying flurries apparently due to reports that this
commodity or that is going to be rationed."
District Manager, A & P: "August 10 and 11 there was a rush on
prunes in the Detroit area due to a rumor that prunes were to be 'frozen'."
Vice-President of Pontiac, Michigan, bank and a Government
official in Detroit reported to us that on August 12 each was told by
different persons in substantially the same language: "The President
will announce the latter part of August that we will have gas rationing
in Michigan October 1."
