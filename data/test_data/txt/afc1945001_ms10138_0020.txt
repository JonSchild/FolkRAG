WOODWARD- SOPHMORE
MALE

The biggest tale that a man ever told was, I quote:
"I went touring through an army camp and there wasn't a 
single crap game."

"As Hitler was inspecting his troops he casually asked
a soldier if he liked the army and the "New Order". "Oh, I 
can't complain" remarked the solder. "You darn right you 
can't", chucked Schicekguiler.
