Don't Care Where You Bury My Body.

Oh, all right. [What you wan]  Would you want me to sing like old
folks sing?

Don't care where you bury my body,
Don't care where you bury my body,
I don't care where you bury my body.
Know my little soul gonna ride in style.

Bury my body in Egypt land,
Bury my body in Egypt land,
You can bury my body in Egypt land.
I know my little soul gonna ride in style.

A:  Is that all of it?

W:  There might be something else.  Let me see -- something more.  There
ain't all of it.  There's something more but I can't think of it.

A:  Where did you learn that?

W:  Oh, I just learned in coming on up, you know. Folks were singing
it.

A: Who taught it to you, do you remember?

W: My grandmaw, sitting down in the corner. My grandmaw Nasta Cameron
sitting down in the corner holding the baby, patting him in the rocker
and singing that "I don't care where you bury my body."

A: How long ago was that?

W: How long a go was that been? Well, I couldn't - let me see now.
No, I ain't been no baby. I wasn't nothing myself. I was 16 years
old at that time.

A: Was your grandmaw a good singer?

W: Well, sang like old folks who sang at the time (Laughter). Now,
when she was a good singer I wasn't here.

A: You liked it, did you?

W: Yeah. I liked to hear my grandmaw sing anything she could sing.
