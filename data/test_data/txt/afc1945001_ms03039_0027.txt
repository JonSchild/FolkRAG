"What we need is a unified command of all our forces, such
as we had in General Pershing in the last war.  I do wish our President
could see his way clear to make such an appointment.  People are more
concerned about that than a second front right now.  Many want that
leader or head appointed first of all.  I've heard many express such
a wish and feel it is a mistake that we do not have one.  Some people
even say they would feel more like investing in bonds if one were
passed to head and coordinate all our armed forces.  I firmly  believe
it should be done."  

August 12......The following information was brought out
in a conversation with a Federal official [*Omaha*]....one thoroughly qualified
to speak as his work brings him in constant contact with many young
people, and in whom everyone, as well as these young people, has the
utmost confidence, which is, of course, the reason he hears these
various comments.  He said:

"If the Army could be made to cut out some of this waste
there has been going on, perhaps more of us would feel more gracious [*8-1*]
about putting our money into bonds, but when we see how it is, you
can't blame people for criticizing.  Some one should report to
Washington about the waste that goes on in some of the Army Departments.
Not long ago, when one particular Nebraska CCC Camp  was disbanded,
300 new meat cleavers were found.  The majority of these had [*1*]
not even been unwrapped....they were in their original wrappings,
and my informant, as well as others knowing of this incident, is wondering
why one camp had that many cleavers in the first place.  This,
in my opinion, is an example of why we're fighting a losing war to
date, and people are not going to be inclined to graciously accept
