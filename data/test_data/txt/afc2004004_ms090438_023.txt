1 If you stop and listen, I'll singt to you a song.
About the appoiling disaster, while the war is going on.
I'll tell you how it started, and when it all began,
I'll tell you about the suffering; but I can't tell when it will end.

CHORUS
These days got everybody troubled, not only I and you
It's got the rich and the poor, and every nationality,
So they don't know what to do.

2 It was in the month of September 1939, war broke out in Europe,
And made everybody troubled in mind.
Germany invaded Poland, and whipped them in eighteen days
Drove their leaders in exile, and reduced their people to slaves.

3 Now England and France were allied and came to Poland's relief,
And fought together side by side till France was finally beat,
After they signed the armistice and France's soldiers went home.
England was left with the bag to hold and had to fight alone.

4 Germany and Italy, together with Japan, amde and signed a 3 power pact,
In an effort to rule the land
Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, and Jugoslavia too
Were all invaded by Hitler, and placed under German rule.

5 We here in America, a land which God has blessed.
Live in peace and contentment from east unto the west:
Realize the danger which we are up against.
That's why we are spending billions for National Defense.

6 Hitler is mean and hateful, violates international law,
That's why we are giving to England everything short of war.
He is a ruthless cold blooded murderer, and that in first degree.
He has conqured most of European land, and now he wants to rule the sea.

7 Like Satan he walketh about seeking whom he he can devour,
Having the mouth of the lion, and the dragon gave him his power.
He's a military strategist, full of hellish tricks,
And the number of his names is six hundred and sixty six.

8 Our ships that sail the ocean, bringing goods to you and me,
Were all forbidden by Hitler to sail the seven seas.
He told us in substance, "you keep your ships at home."
For they'll certainly be destroyed if they enter the war zone.

9 Our governme nt was patient, and tried to be good,
Tolerated that foolishness as long as it possibly could.
But one day Congresss reclaimed that freedom of the seas
And now our ships are permitted to go wherever they please.

10 Thousands are taken prisoners, hundreds of thousands killed
Thousands are left wounded, to die on the battle field
Still others to face starvation, and die from hunger and cold
All we can do is ask the Lord to have mercy on their souls

11 These must be the days that Daniel spoke about,
At that time Michael shall stand up, and the dragon be cast out.
May-be, these are the unlean spirits that John the apostle saw,
Going forth unto the kings of the earth, causing them to make war.
