Here Bob plays melodeon tune. . . .
Lomax:  What's the name of that, Bob?
Robts:    Up the Sides and Down the Middle.
Lomax:   Where did you learn it?
Robts:    Down at a place called Longham, Dorset.
Lomax:   Where did you get this. . .where did you learn to play
              the accordion, anyhow?
Robts:    Odd times at sea.
Lomax:   You mean the sailors taught you, or you just. . .

              see. You learnt off him, see, and learnt a bit off the
              next ship, picked up tunes. I can't play any music.
