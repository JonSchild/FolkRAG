near Port-au-Prince and from the [Leogane plain] plain of Leogane to the [Sout]
South. I [witnessed] was present at the baptism of a large mama drum at Pont
Beudet where essentially the same ceremony that Herskovitz
describes was performed. [Later] Sometime later I had [the]
of the same village, make a set of drums
work on the drums had been completed
in details from the process that Herskovitz
[asked to participate in] advised to finance a ceremony in which the drums were to be given
souls.* I was told that without [these souls they would burst] this ceremony
[when they were strenuously played] and their voices would be weak
and unsteady and they might burst if they were strenuously played. [This ceremony was performed by Ciceron the man who made the
drums (he was an important servitor in the local cult and was sometimes
consulted in cases of sickness.)] *P. 276, opus cit.
