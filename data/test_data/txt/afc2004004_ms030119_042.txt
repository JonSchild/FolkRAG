people that are in the worl?
     (Mmm-hmm.)
     Could they come to that extent of understandin?
     (Understanding and freedom and innocence, where they
wouldn't feel evil about making love?)
     Without any great talk?
     (Where people would just think it was delightful to
make love?)
     Oh yeah.  I see what you mean.  Without any great
talk?. . .WELL.  You ast that question.  I'mon try to tell you.  It
could be brought to that effect.  So much so that the mo the worl
talk to mo it be goin on till they jest quit talkin bout it.
That wouldn't stop em from thinkin bout it, but still they would
stop talkin bout it.
     (When you were a little boy, Rev. Davis, did they
br ing you up to think that it was wrong to make love?)
     My mothah used to tell me things like that that would
be ugly.
     (Did she tell you that your parts were nasty and ugly?)
     Yeah, she would tell me that but I -- N-O-O-O!  I
found out the nasty thang was all right wid me!
     (Did you ever feel guilty about making love?)
     No. Never have felt guilty.  If I ever have felt guilty,
I nevah would ask no woman a question about -- doin that fur me.
I (with sudden energy and resolution in a smart quick tone) I nevah
met a woman in my life, Miss Lizybeth, that I wouldn't ask huh fur
what I wanted if I wanted it.  Thass troof!  Don't care who it is.
If it's you or anybody.  Thass right.  I'll ast anybody fur what I 
want if I want it.  Can't but jes say no.
