Cheyenne

A chance meeting with Theodore Rooesvelt in Cheyenne, Wyoming,
when I had almost finished collecting material for cowboy songs, resulted
in a fine boost for the book published later in the year. He
wrote an introduction that has been many times quoted. His hearty
words of commendation proved an offset to the sneers of some critics
who held in small regard the folk product of our country.

I wrote as follows to Bess Brown Lomax:

"Cheyenne, Wyoming. 
Aug. 28, 1910

"My interview with Mr. Roosevelt was so interesting that perhaps
I should record it while the impression is fresh. In the forenoon
I sent in a note asking for a moment's interview. Directly he came to
where I was waiting in the hotel lobby and said: "I should have answered
the letter you wrote me (about two weeks ago) if a moment' time had
been left to me. Now, I must go church. Can you meet me in my room
at two o'clock this afternoon, and bring with you a sheet of white unruled
paper" (for a statement to be copied in the book) I said I could,
and went my way.

He was ready at the hour, and began by asking me just what I
wished him to say. Thereupon I told him of the general attitude of
unappreciativeness on the part of the west towards my work, and suggested
that there was little recognition of the fact that the ballads throw
light on western conditions and traditions. Whereupon he interjected:
"Not only that, but they illustrate the curious reproduction of medieval
conditions in the west." I ventured to hint that such a happy phrasing
of the truth might go in outright; and he said "I am going to put it in."
Then he wrote and chatted to me between sentences. Frank James had been
an ardent supporter of his in Missouri, and that suggested a line form
Jesse James' ballad, which runs, according to his version:

"The G-- D-- coward who shot Mr. Howard."

As he wrote on painstakingly, he remarked: "Well, it is a tribute
to the policies I stand for if the American people can read my handwriting
and still think there is any man behind it." Meanwhile some one knocked
and he shouted "Come in" twice, without turning his head. When he had done,
he introduced me to his visitor, a song of Lyman Abbot, told him of my work,
and then asked me to read what he had written.
