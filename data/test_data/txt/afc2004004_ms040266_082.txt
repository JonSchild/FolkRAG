Dear District Secretary,

MAGAZINE NEWS

      The dates of publication of the Magazine are
  being adjusted in order that they may fall more conveniently 
within the year.   Therefore, instead of the normal June/July 
Magazine, due for publication on May 21st,  we are issuing
 a June/July News Bulletin, containing news items only.

The next full issue of the Magazine is scheduled
 for the end of June.   This will cover the months of July
 and August.   With a few exceptions news published in the 
June/July Bulletin will not be repeated in the July/August
 issue, but additional items for July will be inserted together
 with fixtures for August.  

We should be glad to have news for this forthcoming 
issue as soon as possible after the receipt of this
 letter and not later than May 27th.

Yours sincerely,
Sarah Jackson
Editor
