Court Trial: 
' Reported
Errol Flynn was held today for 
[?]nts of statutory rape, after a pre-
with a photographer's testimony
that the actor had told him he 
was being made the victim of an 
attempted shakedown.
Flynn, looking little like the 
dashing hero of the movie drama,
was ordered to appear in Superior
Court Nov. 23 for assignment
of a trial date. At liberty
on $1000 bond, he is accused of 
twice attacking Peggy La Rue
Satterlee, Hollywood showgirl, 
on a yacht trip when she was 15
years old, and of once raping
Betty Hansen 17, of Lincoln,
Neb., movie-struck waitress, at
a party in a Hollywood mansion.
'LIFE' PHOTOGRAPHER HEARD
Statutory rape, under California
law, involves any sex act with a girl 
under 18, whether with or without
consent.
Flynn did not take the stand, and
the defense concerned itself entirely
with cross-examination. The mention
of shakedown came from Peter
Stackpole, photographer for Life
magazine, who took pictures on the
yacht trip in August, 1941, when
Miss Satterlee claims she was raped.
Stackpole said Flynn telephoned 
him a week later and arranged a 
meeting.  then
"I believe Flynn said he was involved
in what he termed a shakedown.
I didn't question him as to details.
He simply said he was getting
involved in a shakedown which involved
Miss Satterlee..."
"Was anything said about money?"
asked Deputy District Attorney
Thomas W. Cockran.
BELIEVES IT WAS $5000
"I believe there was, Stackpole
replied. "...I believe it was $5000.
Flynne told me he had a print of her
developed in color and was going to 
caption the picture 'Five Thousand
Dollars'."
On cross-examination, Defense
Attorney Jerry Giesler asked:
"Did Flynn ask you to destroy the 
photos?"
"No," Stackpole answered, "at one
time I said I was willing to destroy
them, but he didn't insist."
ISSUES STATEMENT
FLORIDA TO ESACPE
WORST OF STORM
Tropical Gales
Diminishing in
Sweep Over Cuba
MIAMI, Fla., Nov. 6 (A.P.). â€”
The first tropical storm of the late
summer season moved over the
mountains of central Cuba tonight,
diminishing in intensity and sparing
Havana and the Florida coast
a possibly destructive blow.
The Weather Bureau's storm
warning service ordered storm
warnings lowered at 10 P.M. from
Melbourne to Miami, Fla., but kept 
the danger signals flying from 
Miami to Key West.
WINDS TO CONTINUE
"Winds will continue strong in
the Florida Straits and water to
the north of western Cuba," the advisory
stated.
The tropical disturbance was centered
then about 35 miles southwest
of Paredon Grande Cay and was
moving southwestward across central 
Cuba's mountains.
SEASON NEAR END
"Indications are that this storm
will continue to diminish in intensity 
as it moves across Cuba into the 
Caribbean," the advisory concluded.
"Cautionary measures should not be
relaxed from central Cuba westward
to the Florida Keys during the next 
12 hours."
STORM VEERS TO WEST
With but nine days left of the
"hurricane season," the storm made 
up in the lower Bahama Islands and
at first was charted heading directly
for the colonial capital of Nassau
and for the resort coast of Southeast
Florida.
By mid-day, it had veered more 
to the west and southwest and was
found following the northern coast
of Cuba, apparently aimed at the
Florida Straits and the Gulf of 
Mexico, with winds approaching and
possibly exceeding 75 miles an hour.
