religious in tone are "sinful"), gossiping, back-biting, stealing,
failing to support the pastor.

              "The leaks in dis old buildin' " (the body)  must be
stopped soon by good deeds.  "You must work on de buildin' soon", shouted Dobie
[Joe of]Red, leader in Camp No. 1.

                Although it is a grievous sin to drink moonshine
liquor, one of the songs I heard that day declared in a rousing
refrain that Heaven is a place where one will sit and drink
wine for ten thousand years. [He]The Christian gets up to Heaven by riding 
"on de mornin' train", which has only one track, "runs straight 
up to Heaven, and right straight back ." "Jesus is a dyin'
bed-maker", and hence makes dying easier. " Jesus don't hate
nobody". Even in the penitentiary, "All in my room I heard de
angels singin'". Hence even here he must let his "little light" 
shine. 
"round them prison walls I'm gonna let it shine, 
let it shine, shine, shine." To the unbeliever, other songs are addressed:
"What you goin' to do when Death comes creepin' in yo' room?"
"When de world's on fire, don't you want God's bosom to be yo'
pillow?" "Jes look down dat lonesome road; you spy trouble 
on de way". " Walk away mourner; you stay at de mourner's bench 
one day too long!" 

                    Here are a few graphic sentences which formed themes 
for other songs sung for me that day:
                  "There is strange things happening in this world".
