Oh, de judge he will sentence you,
The clerk will write it down, 
You can bet yo' bottom dollar,
You Angola boun'.

{{crossed out}}
You think about de lawyer -- yo think about de jedge -----

There sets de judge, 
I like to forgot,
The damndest rascal {{crossed out}}
De state ever picked out.

When de judge give you life-time in de pen -- deya ain' nothin'

you can look to but de good Lawd in de sky --- the angels up in de

Heaven they gon' take care of you ----

Oh, de rose is red,
An' de Vi'let blue,
An' de angels in heaven,
Sing, "I love you."

Now dis here's de las' verse -----

When you write me a letto, 
Please send it by mail,
You can' dress it all over
Dat Shreveport jail.
