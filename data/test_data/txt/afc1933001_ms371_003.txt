craft of writing.  He even thinks that a teacher of English should be able to ex-
press his ideas, "if any", in a readable style.  A happy nuance, a happily turned phrase,
delicate shades of thought, even words as coarse and brutal as brickbats, motivate h
his life.  Like Sentimental Tommy he will sit up all night, or fail to pass an examina-
tion, while he searches for the precise word to blend harmoniously into his intellect-
ual phantasies.  He knows that any competent writer must be in a very definite sense
an artist, and, whatever else Dobie may do, he has already won his accolade.

Professor George Lyman Kittredge of Harvard University says that the Intro-
duction to Coronado's Children is among the few examples of great writing yet pro-
duced in America.  Coronado's Children will live, -even the title was in inspira-
tion,- as will The Vaquero of the Bruch Country, among the several good books of which
Dobie is the author.

But the chief work of Frank Dobie is yet to be mentioned.  As Harry Steger
would have said, he is the "heart, liver, lights and lungs" of the Texas Folk-Lore
Society.  He found a weak, aenemic, startved, orphan, struggling along amid an unfriendly
and sneering local environment,- just one more useless organization, futilely exist-
ing, kept alive because seeing things die is so unpleasant!  In fourteen years under
his leadership, the Society has become respectable, its membership an honor, its lit-
erature in demand by scholars and the best libraries.  These fourteen years of Dobie's
stewardship, disguised under the title of "secretary", have seen fourteen noteworthy books partially reveal the activities of the Society.  The latest of these volumes,
1938, is Coyote Wisdom.  Other titles in the series, which should arrest the atten-
tion of anyone except the sterile stick-in-the-mud anatomical critic, Foller de
Drinkin' Gourd (1928), Tone the Bell Easy (1932), Spur-of-the-Cock (1933), Puro
Mexicano (1935), Straight Texas (1937).

"I am the Coyote that sings each night at dark;
It was by gobbling prairie dogs I got such a bark.

I'm a roaring, ranting orchestra with lunatics becrammed;
I'm a vocalized tornado-I'm the shrieking of the damned."
