"How do we know what Stalin's Army is doing? I'll bet Hitler 
and Stalin play checkers every afternoon. They both wanted to suck the 
United States into this war; Then they'd gang up on the Allies. If not, 
why won't Russia let us put observers along his front lines? Why won't he 
let newspaper reporters cover the front, and why doesn't Russia give us 
bases along her coast line so we could bomb Japan? Just read Pearson and 
Allen's columns. They'll tell you." (San Francisco--August 7th-newspaperman.)
