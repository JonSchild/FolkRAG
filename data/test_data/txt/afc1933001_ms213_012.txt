I am bound to say, you have 
looked after and reported on.
No correspondence can survive 
if the letters exchanged
don't have some binding connection.
You get tired throwing
your hook in the sea without
some sympathetic pull in 
return.
Take time at least to read 
a copy of Ed Crane's 
letter to me -- a letter just 
received.  I hope they will 
make him Dean of the Law 
Department to fill the vacancy.
Miss Terrill and I are 
both very well and send 
our love.  Yours always,
Father
