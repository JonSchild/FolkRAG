BJ TAPE 7A, p. 38

TL: Does it hurt your fingers?
BJ: When ya first start picking' it it, it'll kinda worry your
fingers around, around the nails, ya know. An' so. 'Till you,
'till you come 'customed to it.
TL: Yeah. What do you do to fix the soreness?
BJ: Well, ya sit an' use ah, alum water.
TL: Alum water?
BJ: Um-hum. Yeah, that's what all of 'em use, alum water.
Jes' like you ah, come in an' wash up. An' then you jus' put some
clean water an' put some, lil' alum in it, you know? An' let it
be warm, then let the alum -- Jes' let your hands sit in that.
An' your hands'll come to be tough; ya don't worry about the,
about the ah, you know, the bolls no mo', see? In other words,
ya come to be used to it, see?
     So some of those, some of those peoples'd git five or 600
pounds a day. One man over there ah, right next to my, used to
work for my grandfather? He didn't farm or nothin'; he jus' worked,
you know, by the day or by the hundreds, you know what I mean.
An' ah, he would pick 700 pounds a day an' [an'] leave, leave the sun
running.
TL: How many did you pick, Bessie?
BJ: Oh, no. My Lawd. I was very poor in picking cotton when I
was small. An' ah...Oh, my, I was a large girl; I was ah, I was
around ah, ten years old. I hadn' never picked a hundred, [you]
[know] of course, you know. It was hard on lil' children. 'Cause I wasn'
the only one; there were many more. Never have. An' so, it was
years before I could, ya know, could pick, ya, ya know, good.
When I, when I did learn to pick cotton, I begin to stop. Hum,
that's funny.
TL: Why?
