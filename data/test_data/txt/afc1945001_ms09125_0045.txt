A draftee while on duty one 
day was looking on the ground
for something.  The commanding 
officer came up and asked
him what was he looking for.
The draftee didn't answer he 
just kept on walking and 
looking on the ground.  The
next day he was called in and
was handed his discharge papers.
The draftee joyfully replied
"this is what I've been looking
for."
