Fisk, 3. 14.  DAVID EDWARDS.

I make that myself along about three weeks ago.

A:  What did you call it?

E:  Well, that's the Army Blues.

A:  What were you thinking of?

E:  I sing my song alone.

A:  How soon do you think you'll go?

E:  Can't hardly tell about that thing.

A:  Would you like to go?

E:  I'll go if I have to.

A:  Who do you think we're going to war with?

E:  Can't hardly tell.  That thing's like coming to the coast -- can't hardly tell how you're coming out.
