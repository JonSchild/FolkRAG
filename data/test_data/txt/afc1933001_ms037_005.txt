Dear Mr. Strunk:
Please have the Business Office 
sent me not less than Five Hundred
Dollars of my expense money. As 
I am flat broke I hope you can
hurry the matter and have the draft
come along with the receipts, etc.
Mail to Bell Glade, Florida, General 
Delivery. Already I have turned up
some interesting new material - about 
25 new records. Regards to all
Sincerely,
JohnA. Lomax
