I was looking through the old issues of
the "Newcastle Courant" - a weekly paper of the
last century - in the Reference Library, &
found the start of research into "Northumbrian
Pipe & Ballad Music" by the Literary & 
Philosophical Institute of Newcastle, in the
issues commencing Friday, Dec. 6th, 1878.  The
series continued for a year or two, with texts
& music every week, & there certainly seems to
be a wealth of material, including history.  "Scottish
border ballads" seem well intermingled, & obviously
a lot were actually born in our area.

Perhaps the British Museum has copies
of this paper, if you're interested.

Let me know if there's anything further
I can do.

Sincerely,
Ken Bell
