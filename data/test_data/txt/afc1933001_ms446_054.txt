35


Weep not, ye tender ladies, shed not a tear for me —
While my poor body's burning, my soul the Lord 
shall see.

Yourselves you need to pity, and Zion's deep decay,
Dear ladies, turn to Jesus, no longer make delay.
In comes her raving mother, her daughter to behold
And in her hand she brought her pictures decked
with gold.

O take from me these idols, remove them from my 
sight;
Restore to me my Bible, wherein I take delight.
Alas, my aged mother, why on my ruin bent?
"Twas you that did betray me, but I am innocent.

Tormenters, use your pleasure, and do as you think
best —
I hope my blessed Jesus will take my soul to rest.
Soon as these words were spoken, up steps the man
of death.
And kindled up the fire to stop her mortal breath.

Instead of golden bracelets, with chains they bound
her fast;
She cried, "My God, give power, now must I die
at last?
With Jesus and his angels forever I shall dwell,
God pardon priest and people, and so I bid farewell!"

No. 32

Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)
That sav'd a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now I'm found, 
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear,
