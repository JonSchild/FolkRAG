chimp whom he couldn't 
split in the night & wanted to less & 
less as time went on --
I say this like the bastard I 
have become by inference lately as
 Robin has given me my coup de grace
 -- does each man have one? - 
not really like this - still innocent 
but becoming less so.
All I could tell from McPhee 
my host, his smils, from 
Mckinnon the mate, from the 
Doctor & his wife was that I
had wandered into a cultural 
area where the people were as 
smart and as succulent as the sunshine 
& the beach with its 
thousands of whited shells 
its hope of constant replenishment.
