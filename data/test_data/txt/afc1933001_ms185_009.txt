Office of Library of Congress:

I am writing you in regards of obtaining commission to record old
tunes and Ballads. Where should I obtain the Recording Machine?
Or do you furnish the same. I was told to write you in regards of every
thing concerning it. I could record hundreds of Ballads right here in
Morgan County and send to Washington. I have composed several songs,
have 3 copyrighted in Washington. One is a State Song "Missouri, my
Missouri." Please advise where I will obtain the recording machine. 
I am fond of record music, can obtain hundreds of Ballads.

Yours
