Macpherson (contd.)

[ten minutes but when he went up they had him out by the
neck and he says "Henceforth" he says, "that clock shall
tell lies" and it beats up to ten minutes ever since!
That is the clock in the Plainstanes - not the clock
in the church, but the clock in the Plainstanes.
"Henceforth, onward", he says, "that clock shall tell
lies" and it always beats up to ten minutes yet.
---------
That clock still goes in yon big building in the
Plainstanes. And there is a gun - an old Waterloo . . or . . .

LOMAX: How do the people of Banff feel about this song?

MACBETH: Oh, they don't like it! Because.. I have seen the fights
there... They don't like it. It is a slur against them.
(OMIT STAMMERING)]

45{ Well, I asked to sing that, you see, one time -
that Macpherson song and I did not know - I forgot
that it took place here, you see, and they had a barrel
of oranges that was given to them as you go in the
door, you see, and they threw oranges and threw ingins
at me! They did not like it because it was a slur
against them, you see.

20{ (Sings) The reprieve was comin oer the
bridge of Banff
To set MacPherson free
When they put the clock at a 1/4 begone
And hung him to a tree
Sae rantingly so wantonly etc
