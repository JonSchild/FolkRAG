COMMENTS

From Jacob A. Evanson, Supervisor of Music,
Pittsburgh Public Schools:
"The art of Richard Chase and Horton Barker is primal,
down to bed-rock. I appreciate immensely their natural,
intelligent, and zestful outlook and the complete absence 
of the phoney 'quaintness' that so often affronts us in the 
name of 'folkiness'.
"They are dignified people with a cultural integrity that
embraces a great range of subtlety, and by their visit here
they have helped us to a higher integrity of our own."

From Carleton Sprague Smith, Chief of the Music
Division, New York Public Library:
"Mr. Chase is an excellent musician with a thorough
knowledge of the folk music of this country. He is accomplished 
as a lecturer, . . . cooperating with Horton
Barker, the blind ballad singer. I am very much interested
in the work he is doing and feel that it cannot be too
widely known in this country."

From John Powell, composer and pianist:
"Mr. Chase's finding of a cycle of JACK TALES is
one of the most remarkable literary discoveries of which
we can boast. . . . His presentation of this material is 
delightful and will reach scholars, students, and the laity
with equal effect
Mr. Chase's position as representative of The Country
Dance Society assures his knowledge and skill in that 
field. . . . He has a special aptitude for mingling young
and old, teaching them the dances, and making everybody
have a good time."


From John Powell, composer and pianist:
"Horton Barker's beautiful singing has long been the
chief ornament of The White Top Festival."

From a student at Washington and Lee University:
"Mr. Barker did a remarkable job of "selling" the
oldest form of English Literature to Washington and Lee
students. The songs were both interesting and entertaining.
The Barker-Chase program was one occasion this
year when applause originated from appreciation and not
just from a sense of courtesy."

From Frederick P. Meyer, Chairman, Department
of English, University of Pittsburgh:
"The students and teachers who heard Mr. Barker and
Mr. Chase were pleased with the performance of both men.
The material of their recitals was substantial and rich and
interesting. . . . The attention of the audience to THE
JACK TALES and the ballads showed what able performers
were before us. The response was splendid."

The Barker-Chase program of ballads and tales, and/or Mr. Chase's services as representative of The Country Dance
Society, are available from November 1, 1942 through March 31, 1943.

THE ENGLISH FOLK DANCE AND SONG SOCIETY
was founded by the great scholar, musician, and teacher, 
Cecil Sharp, and has centers throughout America and England.
In the United States this organization is known as
THE COUNTRY DANCE SOCIETY.

The scope of the Society's work includes the
collecting, editing, publishing, and active teaching
of all the musical traditions of English-speaking 
peoples: songs, ballads, carols, and folk
hymns; American folk-games and square sets, 
English and American country dances, English
sword dances and morris dances. 

The Society fosters the social enjoyment of all these
arts: in homes, schools, camps, churches, colleges, and
communities. 


HORTON BARKER, BALLAD SINGER
Horton Barker of Chilhowie, Virginia, has been for
many years one of the outstanding participants in The
White Top Folk Festival and The National Folk Festival. 
During the past year he has given full programs in
many schools and colleges of Virginia, at The University
of Virginia, and at Washington and Lee University. During
February, 1942, he spent an entire week at The University
of Pittsburgh. [*via English, Music, Physical
Education and Social Science Departments.*]

His merry personality, his fund of mother wit, and the
charm of his singing make him a beloved figure wherever
he is known. His voice has great beauty and his diction
is unusually clear.

His blindness has been no handicap to him in the 
development of his gifts. His quickness in recognizing
hundreds of people by their voices, and his accurate perception
of places and events about him, are so uncanny
that he is already in legend for miles around the little
community where he lives.

He sings in the traditional manner, without accompaniment,
and is, in the opinion of John Powell and other
professional musicians, a true artist in his simple straight-forward
handling of our genuine folk songs.  His repertoire
is rich and varied, and his program can be adapted
to many different types of audiences.

Mr. Barker has become widely known since he was
first discovered at The White Top Festival.  He has made
numerous radio broadcasts, including a nation-wide hook-up
over N. B. C. when he shared a program of folk music
with John Powell and with Douglas Kennedy, Director of
The English Folk Dance and Song Society.

This season, engagements can be made only from November
1, 1942, through March 31, 1943.
