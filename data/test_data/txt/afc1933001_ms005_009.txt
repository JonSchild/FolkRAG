Dear Mr Engel:
Please have the machine and discs
shipped to me c/o Professor
Ives , Department of Education,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by 
express. At the latest we will
get to Baton Rouge by July 10. 
We have already got some interesting
songs on wax Dictaphone 
records. Write to me
General Delivery, Baton Rouge, and
give me Mr Garwick's address
so I can order more discs as
needed. I thank you again.

Sincerely, 

John A. Lomax
