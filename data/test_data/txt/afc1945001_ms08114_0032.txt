Shoes Ration
Snoddy - Man I'm worried to Death.
Mike - About What?
Snoddy - Well! they allow three pairs
of shoes a year
Mike - Why do that worry you
Snoddy - I can see where I can get
two pairs of shoes but I
don't see where I can get
enough money for the third pair.

When Hitler was bombing in London
Churchill told him you just like
hear you [?]  get no where.

The people say that sugar ratining
Is hard until every time they
sweeten their coffee they say
give me liberty or a pound of
sugar.
