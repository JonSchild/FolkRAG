Dear Harold:

RECEIVED
OCTOBER 1944
MUSIC ADMISSION

The Special Programs Section of OWI is preparing a program of German music in America. We would like to include a group of folk songs sung by German settlers in Pennsylvania, Texas and the Middle West; probably one song from Texas,  one from Pennsylvania, and two from the Middle West region.

Could you get someone in your department to locate five such songs for us and have them photostated or copied, words and music, at our expense so that we could have them performed for our program. The group of five songs should, if possible, be varied as to type to include, for example, a ballad, a lyric love song, a lullaby, and one or two dance songs.

Could you let me hear about this as soon as possible?
Best regards to you and family.

PS Alan is now with the Armed Forces Radio Service in Hollywood and seems to be having a swell time, doing interesting and really useful work. Our reluctant son and heir is now one month overdue.
