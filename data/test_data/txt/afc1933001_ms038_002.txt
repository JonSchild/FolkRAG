Dear Mr. Thompson:
Mr. John A. Lomax, whom you know, has just departed on an extensive field trip through the southern states. As he was leaving, he requested me to send you an order for one item which he needs urgently. Please send him, by air mail, one extra cutting head needle, and address it to General Delivery, Blowing Rock, North Carolina. Mr. Lomax will be there awaiting it. 
Very truly yours, 

ENW
