TAPE: #228, Sacred Harp  1

Lloyd Redding:  . . . . . .This is the place to learn to sing, why
you'll have to learn here or you're not going to learn much
about what youstudy here at singings. But if you will get a little
bit of this and then what you learn at singings you can add it
to it. When you add it to it, you practice it and you've got it
going. Every little bit you learn, you can add something to it,
regardless of what it is. You can add something to it and you
can learn a lot when you get started. You learn a little bit 
about the rudiments at a singing, you'll run across something
you'll remember. I heard something about that in a singing
group- add it to it. Then when you do that, the next time you
come to it, you'll remember. It's like singing the wrong note
wrong every time you come to it. When he tells you, when you learn
it, when youcome up to it, you'll know it. So this is the place
to learn how to sing. And I think having a wonderful school, I've
really enjoyed it myself. Hugh's done a good job. The same one
we have sung, in 1981, don't sing the same song every time you
get up, pick something else. It don't matter if you miss it - that's
all right. The important thing is to try. You're not expected
to sing it right. Not the first time, but three or four times.
But try, miss it, and try it again. Good Lord of Mercy, if
everyone waited until they could sing before they started, we
wouldn't have no singing. If they didn't make a mistake, we
wouldn't have no singing. You can't learn something until you make
a mistake. You got to practice from your mistakes. You learn
from your mistakes.
