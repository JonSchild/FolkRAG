Dear Bill:

We don't need Casey Jones particularly. I have
written the boys about the tunes for Tuesday and
I wish you'd arrange a brief rehearsal for me with
them Sunday afternoon, as well as the 4-hour stretch
you promised me on Monday. Since it is possible this
time, it would n't hurt to send them all scripts in 
advance.

I am going to drive up Saturday afternoon. Tell McGill
to study hard and don't forget your Sunday School
lesson.

Yours,
