Music                     [Mr. Morgan] Chief Clerk,
                                 Photostat

July 9, 1938.

I reccommend that the memo in regard to the Archive's 
summer field recording trip to Minnesota and Michigan 
be photostated and that one negative and one positive 
be made.

Chief, Division of Music
