it is not necessary to pass the
problem on to me. Sooner or 
later you'll find out the calibre
of the cattle you have sometimes run with.

In determining your own opinion
of our claim to the material
we have put in the Folk Song Archive
and thereafter printed in our books, let
me suggest that you keep in mind
these facts:

1. In our first trip to Washington,
through Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Tennessee and Kentucky, I was paying
the entire expense. The Library of 
Congress was furnishing the machine
and perhaps the records (I don't remember)
That was all.
2. I never at any time have
been paid any salary by the Library
