She says now she sends into
Hamner Ala. for her mail, not Sumterville but
admits she ain't never got none yit! [*75*]
How optimistic they are - well
any way as she didn't have the
form, I wrote exactly as she
dictated, then had my friend
another optimistic one who took a chance
with me â€” (the only acquaintance who would,)
witness it - I hope that is all
that's necessary for Aunt Harriet, as
she is miles off the highway - then
thru a gate & into the forest primeval
so it will be impossible to make the trip
again on my tires. I was really frantic
seeing myself there for life - no spare etc. -
Well any way I got back safely &
thats that.

Now I can always get in touch with
Doc - Vera, Rich Amerson and those
who still aren't entirely out of civilization
but Hamner is "too far" to walk & my
elderly thumb gets me no where fast.

Lots of love for you & E.

Cordially, Ruby P. T.
