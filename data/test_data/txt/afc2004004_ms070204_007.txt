A fat woman
"Jesus Christ your monkey
weighs 40 lbs alone

"It's hot enough down 
here to knock up a 
shape"

Davis Sharkey, [supenge?]

'ticked" or "ticky" - crazy
Off behind the barn surveying
the waves - 

"We're only going through the
world['s] the last time —
To tell [if] the honest truth &
spite the devil —
