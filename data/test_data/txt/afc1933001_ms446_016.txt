PRESS RELEASE                                                            For Immediate Release


SOUND LABORATORY IN LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
     The Library of Congress has this week received funds which will
enable it to embark upon a field of cultural activity heretofore unexplored
by libraries. A grant of $41,520 from the Carnegie Corporation, received 
by The Librarian, Archibald MacLeish, will provide for the installation in
the Music Division of a complete sound laboratory for duplicating phonographic
recordings of all types, for making master recordings which can be
pressed and distributed, for originating broadcasts and for making transcriptions 
for radio broadcasts. In addition, with the purchase of a sound
truck and six portable recorders, it will be possible for the Library to 
record, in the field, for distribution on discs or radio broadcast, material
which cannot be recorded in the studio. It is expected that the apparatus
will require several months to install, and will be in operation in the fall.
     When the installation is completed the Music Division of the Library 
will be able to provide for schools, libraries and individuals, recordings 
of American folk music, American poetry read and interpreted by its makers,
unpublished string quartets, new American music and other similar materials.
Much of this material stands ready for use on the shelves of the Library 
now - records of American folk music from many parts of the country, documents
basic to the history and culture of America and of the world, musical 
manuscripts of composers, ancient and modern. Only students who are free
to come to the Library or people who can afford to have expensive copies made,
