Chain Gang Negroes - Page Eleven

in groups with resonant powerful voices, they seemed to forget
their plight, the iron bars, guards on watch with guns in their
hands. And when I played the records back to them, they would
shout out their delight, greeting with merry laughter some vocal
slip of their companions caught by the machine. At such times
they seemed light-hearted, happy even. Perhaps, however, as one
of their song goes,

"when you see me laughin'
I'm laughin' to keep from cryin'."

For indeed to the Negro especially, loss of liberty is a punishment
not a method of reformation. One singer complained,

"Well, de Captain called me a nappy headed devil,
Dat aint my name, it made me mad."

Describing the shifting changes of Chain gang life another song
says,

"Some on de right of way, some on de farm,
Some on de Chain gang, some goin' home."

But the prevailing note of the long term man is

"On a Monday I got 'rested
On a Tuesday I was tried
On a Wednesday I got my sentence
On a Thursday hung my head and cried
I'm a chain gang man, aint [goin'] got no mo home."
