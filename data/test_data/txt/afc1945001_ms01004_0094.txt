One should be a subject where there is much information, the other 
where there is little or no information -- with both referring to 
content of equal interest and importance. This was suggested by 
Oscar Katz and concurred in by Tyroler, but omitted from proposal chiefly 
because of difficulty of defining the two topics without foreknowledge 
of the date of study, (what may now be little known can later be well 
known) and lack of knowledge of contents of Bussey's memorandum.

The divergence in original orientation between proposal and 
alternative would not change the nature of the data collected significantly. 
The major difference is in proposal to collect all vs few 
types of rumor and I believe that from point of view of analysis, the 
emphasis on a few (two to four) would be preferable.
