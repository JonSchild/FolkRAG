DRAW A BUCKET OF WATER                GRADE II

Draw a bucket of water,
For my lady's daughter;
One in a rush,
Two in a rush,
Please, little girl, bob under the bush.

This game is played in groups of four, usually by girls. Two players face
each other, clasping hands at full arm's length. The other two face each other in
the same way, with their arms crossing those of the first couple at right angles.
Bracing the feet, the couples sway backward and forward, singing the rhyme.

As the last line is sung, the two players whose arms are on top raise their
arms, without unclasping their hands, and place them around their companions, who
stoop to step inside. They will then be standing in a circle with the two players'
arms around their waists. The game finishes by dancing in this position in a ring,
repeating the verse.

THE JOLLY MILLER      GRADE III

Jolly is the miller who lives by the mill,
The wheel goes round with a right good will;
One hand in the hopper and the other in the sack,
The right steps forward and the left steps back.

A double circle, partners facing the same direction with left sides to the center and
inner hands joined. All march forward around the circle while singing the first
three lines. At the last line, those in the outer circle step forward and those in
the inner circle step backward, thus changing partners. May be played with a player
in the center; when the change is made, he endeavors to secure a partner. Player
left without a partner must take his place.

NOTE: These rhythmic activities were taken from a bulletin "Education through
Recreation and Play" (For Boys and Girls in grades I - III) issued by the
State Board of Recreation of Idaho.
