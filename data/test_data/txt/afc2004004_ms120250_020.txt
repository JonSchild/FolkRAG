This letter is being finished
it began to unwind on various
in the South of Haiti, listeni
eyes and making notes but without
did not arrive, because of strik
a week ago. And I not only want
al at the age of twenty-two, but 
cee is coming in on the boat from 
be married as soon as father sends will be
hope to heaven. You see, under Ha minor until I achieve
the magic age of twenty-five. I did not know all this until rather too
late to do anything about it and I rather expect a major mess to arise; 
but I am psychicly, though not financially, prepared for it. There will 
be quite a bit of scandal manufactured here, but I have saved the good 
name of the Library in advance by explaining the situation to the highest 
officials. When I get back home I will have more to tell you, but 
for the present be satisfied with this and let me know how things have 
gone with my bastard biography, with my prospects for a job, with 
that swell friend of Benten's and his wife, and with yourself, wife and delicious 
children. I should also like an off the record opinion of Strunk's 
reaction to the records and report I plan to send this next week some 
time.
I hope to have a letter from you soon, although not necessarily 
a brief biography like this one, and in the meantime I remain,
Yours sincerely,
Alan Lomax
