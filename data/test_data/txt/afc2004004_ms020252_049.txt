2nd R. of 10/12/61, Song 17, p. 2   [*38*]

Hush Hush

Oh Lordy, let us pray, 
Let us pray, 
Oh pray until the Holy Ghost comes, 
Oh my Lord, 
Oh my Lordy, 
What shall I do?

Lordy, way
In the night, 
Ol' death come creepin' in the room, 
It was way
In the night, 
Ol' death come creepin' in the room, 
Lordy, way
In the night, 
Ol' death come creepin' in the room, 
Oh my Lord, 
Oh my Lordy, what shall I do?

Lord, soon
One mornin'
Death left me a motherless chile,
Oh soon
One mornin'
Death left me a motherless chile, 
Oh my Lord, 
Oh my Lordy, what shall I do?

She said, "Hush,
"Oh, hush, 
"Lord, there's somebody's callin' my name,"
