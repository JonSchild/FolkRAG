Conduct of War, Continued.

[*2a*]  Business man, 8-13-42:  "The government hasn't the temerity to control wages and 
agricultural prices."

[*7a*]  Business man, 8-13-42:  "You will never get this administration to control wages 
and strikes."

[*2*]  Newspaper editor, small town, 8-15-42:  "Another big contingent of American 
troups is reported to have crossed the Atlantic without any trouble and landed 
in the British isles.  Quite a few people we know see no point in sending forces 
to remain more or less inactive in England, while the Japs still remain in 
the Aleutians and the Allied forces in the South Pacific could use more help."

[*1*]  Prominent business man, 8-13-42:  "All we get in the newspaper now is this women's 
soldier business and the Army War Show.  My God, we are certainly living in a 
delightful atmosphere!"
