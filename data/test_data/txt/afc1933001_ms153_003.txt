Dear Friend:
Beginning with the ________________issue, ARIZONA 
HIGHWAYS will visit you each month for the next year,
bringing your greetings from Arizona and
MISS JANE HUDGINS, librarian
ARIZONA HIGHWAYS is published by Arizona Highway 
Department in the interest of good roads.  Through its
pages you will see Arizona - - -  scenic, industrial,
historical, and romantic - - - the Land of Enchantment 
and Colorful Vista.
Please inform us of any change in address, and also 
please notify us if you do not get the magazine each month.
We are mighty proud to make your acquaintance and we
hope you'll enjoy our monthly visit.  We take our temporary
farewell in the words of our Mexican neighbors south of the 
border:

"Hasta la vista!"
