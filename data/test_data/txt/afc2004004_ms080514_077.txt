when ah, the black banjo accompaniment, with 
its slightly bluesy quality was beginning to 
be used, as the baseline for the new songs of 
the mountains, going back about ah the 
beginning of the century.  And, ah, there were 
hundreds of these songs, and they - those 
songs led of course to bluegrass, and her 
favorite of course is the one about Little 
Birdie, Little Birdie.  [*lay back start Little Birdy*] And ah she also 
remembered songs of murder ballads that 
happened in her locality.  The one she sings us 
now is one that I don't know of from any other 
part of ah the mountains but hers.  It's a local 
ballad, ah, one of hundreds of such tragic 
songs, um, made ah in the backwoods.  And they 
almost all were concerned with ah sexual -

that's where, ah, the emotions of these ah 
ah... highly... religious, tense, ah, Scots-
Irish part Indian folk, were focused.

That's very poor.
