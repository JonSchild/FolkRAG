heared telling of nothing like that. . . . you digged her up,

AL:  How many hours a day did you work?
Nimrod:  Well, I went on the hill at 4 o'clock.  My wife
packed my  bucket, this was right after I was married. Packed
my bucket, I'd leave the house at 4 o'clock, and 9, 10, 11
in the night, I'd come back out, out of that hole.  And when

it was full, with gob(?) and slate and stuff, it'd be about
maybe 30 or 40 ton in it, and they'd take a chalk or paint,
