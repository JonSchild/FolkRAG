to any settlement you 
make, provided you also convince
Mrs. Seeger of the righteousness

not in favor of sitting quiescent

and I am due, in addition,

songs taken, even before they are
published, and issued, without
the permission of anyone, in
an "album" with no mention
of or credit given to
the persons who went out
and found the songs.

I like your succinct, well-phrased
