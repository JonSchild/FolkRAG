Rumors
   A couple of months ago their was a rumor
going around that they would ration sugar
so everybody started buying sugar & hoarding
so much of it that they finally rationed sugar.
After a while it was rumored that they would
ration coffee. People started hoarding that so
the Government had to ration coffee. Not so long
ago, the Government pulled a surprise ration on
shoes before a rumor could start about that. About
three weeks ago   they rationed canned goods and in
a little while they will ration meat. If people
would not spread rumors there would be less
hoarding and less rationing.
