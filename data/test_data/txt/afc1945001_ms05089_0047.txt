Conversation heard between two hospital nurses:

"Some of my friends departed last week from New York for
Australia. I believe there were about 900 nurses and some 300 or 
400 doctors on this ship. I talked to one of the girls before she 
left Denver. She was very pessimistic about the future. She said 
that her ship would be given only a partial convoy and not as large 
a convoy as they give troop ships. It seems to me if the country 
is so desperately in need of doctors and nurses for the armed forces 
they should take more precautions for their safety. If we haven't 
got enough ships to convoy these people why don't they wait until 
they can build the ships. Personally, I wouldn't be interested in 
offering my professional services under such circumstances."  [*24*]
