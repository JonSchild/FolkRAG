Cayou Dufors, Apr. 6.

Walk with Tanmis's servant. In 
banana grove behind a big habitation
 a huge cross (8 or 9 ft) with a packet 
of food tied up in newspapers hanging 
from the top - this for Baron Samedi 
nearer the house a great iron pot of the
 type that is used for boiling down sugar 
cane - a chaudi√®re - in this on occasion
the family bathes and rubs water on their
arms & bodies - it  is the habitation of
all the loi- The people are possessed after bathing
   Servant told me that a friend of his had come the
day before from Aux Cayes to visit a houngan. The
houngan made 7 little zombies for him
to put in his field to protect it from thieves. 
The zombies are buried in little holes
on top of their food- bon bons & cassave.
They are buried by the houngan with certain
prayers and in symbol. When he goes back 
to his hounfont he sends the zombies to
to symbols. You go to the field to steal
and the zombies small ones 2 ft. high
