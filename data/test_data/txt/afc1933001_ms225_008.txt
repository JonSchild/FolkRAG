you can spend in San Antonio. Then
Dobie can arrange our meeting
date to correspond, if possible; also
Dobie can ask Mr. MacLeish for
you at a definite time. Ordinarily
the Society meets in April.
I don't [hav] know how long
Dobie will be willing to put it
off. I plan to have a lot of
music - Mexican, Old Fiddlers,
Cowboys. Richard Smith will
help me and Maury Merrick -
the best audience you have
ever faced.

3. You owe me $425, awaiting royalty
credits for this year and
one or two small amounts for
which the items are not at hand
(use of Ballad material in collections).
I also await our unknown
(at present) loss on the Leadbelly
