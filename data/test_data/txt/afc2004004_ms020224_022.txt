BJ TAPE 9, p. 20

tell me, say, I had some fine, fine peoples, you know?  A wealth
a peoples livin'.  An' told me a lot about-bout 'em, you know?  An',
uh, that, an' say I had some fine-lookin' people.  I'd 
like to see 'em.  Ah, ah, see, I'm not, the whole crew ain't like
me!  Ah-ha, ha, ha!
     An' so she said, "Then he's in
Fort Dallas."  An' I thought to myself she meant Fort Valley.
But she continue over.  An' you could hear 'er talkin' when,
when she look like she [fallin'] goin' to sleep, 'bout to fall out that
chair?  She said, "Fort Dallas, Fort Dallas, Fort Dallas," just
kept a-sayin' it.
     You know.  An' then, when she come back, you know -- I say
"come back" -- looked like she oughta look an' talked to me, she
said. . .
TL:  Well, how did she go about finding out all this stuff?  What
did she do?  Did she                     ?
BJ:  I don't know!  Who know!  I ain't never been there an' I
don't wanna be there, I don't think!  Hah!
TL:  When you walked in there, she looked at you, huh?
BJ:  Um-hum.  Yeah.
TL:  When did she start goin' to sleep?
BJ:  Well, after I sit down, um-hum.  She talked wit' me a lil' while.
TL:  Did she talk to you a little while first?
BJ:  That's right.  Was lookin' right straight at me.
TL:  Was she all right then?
BJ:  Um-hum.  Yeah, she all right then, but she jus' looked like
she's goin' to sleep.  Jus' talkin' (an' shut her eyes?)
TL:  Even while she's tryin' to talk to you?
BJ:  Not at first but a little later on. . .An' boy, I was scared!
Oow, man!  Ha, ha,
