The latter part of June and the early part of July always sees hosts of ordinations
in the Diocese of Texas.  This  year is no exception.  Jack Desel will be ordained June 3rd
in Killeen;  Nelson Longnecker, June 25th, Cathedral, Houston; Mike Keppler, June 26th,
Trinity, Houston; Scottie Irvin, June 27th, Rockdale; Gordon Swope, June 29th, Lake
Jackson; Claude Behn, July 2nd, Sealy; Ed Rutland, July 3rd, Carthage; Dick Bradshaw
July 3rd, Richmond (the Rector of All Saints' will be the preacher at this service); Joe
Treadwell, July 5th, McGregor; Roger Cilley and Jack Russell, July 6th, St. David's, 
Austin.  As Roger Cilley is a member of All Saints' it will be my pleasure to present
him for his ordination to the Diaconate and I am sure that Roger's friends will take note
of the July 6th ordination date in order to support him if not with their presence at
least with their prayers on this important date in his life.
         Let's meet in Church this summer.  There is no better place.
         Faithfully yours,  SFB
