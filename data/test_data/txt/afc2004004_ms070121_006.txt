(A GRAVE OLD MAN BEGAN TO PRAY SPEAKING IN
MEASURED, THOUGHTFUL STYLE...
I acknowledge that I have sinned by commission
As well as by ommission
And you are so sympathetic
And You have so much patience with me
And I'm ashored from past and present treatment
From you that if I come
And deny my sins and turn from them
That you'll own me again...
 (HE CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES IN THIS FASHION[X].
HIS VOICE GRADUALLY RISING WITH FEELING. HIS
PERIODS GREW SHORTER. THE RESPONSES BEGAN TO
COME FROM THE CONGREGATION...
O lord
 O LORD
Look on the presiding officer-ah
And the president of this congregation-ah,
Bless these brethering that are holding up his arms-ah
(WITH EACH -AH THERE IS A VIOLENT INTAKE OF BREATH..
I don't want you to leave town -ah
And leave us here by ourselves-ah
I want you to go in every home-ah
O Lord
 O LORD
O my father
 MY FATHER
Let us make and impression -ah
Upon these gambling dives-ah
So that they will know-ah
That the men of God are in town-ah
(THE FERVOR OF THE CONGREGATION BEGINS TO MOUNT.
THE OLD PREACHER'S VOICE GOES SHRILLER [?] SOUNDING
IN THIS FOLLOWING PASSAGE FULL OF THE AGONY OF
A CHILD SHRIEKING FOR MERCY FROM A CRUEL PARENT...
We need you this evening-AAH
Sin is causing men to die-AAH
Mussalinah needs you this evening-AAH
He's causing men to die-AAH
You know the world--, the world--, the world---
(EACH "WORLD IS A TREMBLING, DESPAIRING CRY. EACH
REPETITION IS A DESCENDING CADENCE OF UTTER
DESPAIR...
Come over here and baptize us-AAH
The world--, the world--
They makin war on every hand-AAH
The world--, the world--
There is no shame here-AAH
The world-- the world--,
It's got us wringing our hands [???] and cryin-AAh,
SHeddin briny tears-AAH,
And when the ware is over-AAH
When I can't pray no more-AAH
O Lord, 
When I can't go no more-AAH
