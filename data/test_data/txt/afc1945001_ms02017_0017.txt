RUMORS, AUGUST 3 THROUGH AUGUST 8, 1942
(Sixth Report for Bureau of Intelligence, Office of War Information)
[*1*]
Summary: Study of rumors current in Alabama during the period August 3 through August 8 indicated economic and political interests influence the types of rumors current in particular areas. For instance Montgomery, State capitol located in Alabama's Black Belt farm area, was seething with rumors concerning racial relations. Feeling in Montomery about the Negro was brought to a boil when the Governor accounced rejection of a war contract for cloth made by the State prison system, as a clause prohibiting discrimination in employment because of race would "break down segregation" and end White supremecy in Alabama. The matter was discussed by Black Belt newspapers with a great deal of heat, all but one of them supporting the Governor's "courageous" stand.
In Birmingham, on the other hand, rumors dealt largely with the prosecution of the war and rationing.
We have included in this report only such rumors as were heard first-hand by this office, reporting only one time a rumor which other persons may have declared they heard several times. Nor was an effort made to stimulate the flow of rumors. Only those that were spontaneous were recorded.
