                                other girl, more kinder than you.

Stay, stay, dearest Colin, just one moment stay,
I will venture to wed if you mean what you say.
Let tomorrow fast come, love, and in church you will find,
That the girl you thought cruel, that the girl you thought cruel, will always prove kind.
Lomax: That's nice, that's very nice.
Cox: (laughs)
Lomax: What kind of a song do you call that?
Cox: Oh, I don't know. I like that song, myself.
Lomax: Have you sung in pubs a lot, Harry?
Cox: Yes, I have done. I like the song. I like the tune. Did you
ever hear the Smuggler's Boy?
Lomax: I don't know, Peter, as you know that one?
Kennedy: The Smuggler's Boy?
Lomax: Shall we take it?
Kennedy: Yes, rather.
Cox: All right. I'll have a go at it. (pause) I had that one writ
out.
Lomax: You've got that one written out?
Cox: I had. I dunno where it is now. I had it at home. But I
dunno where it is.
Lomax: You mean you learned that from paper?
Cox: I did, I had - I knew some of it, but I ha'n't got it
all correct, you see. So. . .
Lomax: What kind of a paper was it? Somebody copied it out for
you?
