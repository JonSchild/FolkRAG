Ah, Tommy's life has been [ONE] 
in ah really joyful occupations.  I mean he's 
as full of ah beans as he ever was when he
was a kid.  He's been a bootlegger all of his 
life, and made the best whisky that he could
make, and the best music.

[*02 . 08 . 36 . 09*]     Ah, Tommy is now surrounded by young people.
They, they've been pouring in to get to play
with him whenev - ah, and you'd never go to 
his house, and when - we never went there
unless there were 3 or 4 young people learning
how to do it right from the old master.
Because he ah, he paid close attention when
he was a kid, and he tells us about that. 
How he used to watch every move that his Uncle 
Ben used to make playing the fiddle.  So he 
could do it finally just the way Uncle Ben
did, and this, this - none of this is in books,
how you play the bow is something ah - it's 
a total mystery.  You haveto watch the fiddler
do it, and ah, my friend Alan Jabour, the
authority on American fiddlers says that the
real heart of fiddling is in the right hand,
in the bow.
