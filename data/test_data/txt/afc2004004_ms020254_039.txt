BJ TAPE 40, p. 37

That's why, when the storm came, see, water, ah, the ground
down there, on the real muck -- I -- there's some places on the
muck, they called it the ridge an' it's sand there, see?  An'
that the Lake over there an' here's the ridge here.  See?  That's
sand.  I lived on the ridge.  An' ah, I stayed on the ridge five
years.  Right back a me is the muck, see?  You goes I
guess, about, oh, well, uh, sometimes, 'bout as fer from here
as across the street there.  You done strut the muck; that's a 
ridge, a sand.
     And then, they's well places 'way on up there they call
sand cut.  Ain't nothin' up there but sand, all around an'
around, well, for I guess about 25 or 30 acres or more an' nothin' but san'.  An' they
raise them beans up there; they call 'em sand beans.  That why
I can look on beans an' tell wheth' they raised in sand or wheth'
they raised in muck or raised in clay, see?  I can look on [the] a
bean[s] in the sto' an' tell it.  Because I know [my] muck beans.  An' I
know sand beans.  Ya see, wh-when I see 'em.  An' I know the
diffrunt about 'em, see?  An' those muck beans are more waddrey (watery),
an' they're quick to git rotten in a hurry, see?  An', an' those
san' beans are mu' solid, an' they're light-colored, ya see.
They got more lighter color to 'em.  I know them.  An' so that's
the way I can tell 'em.
     An' so, an' but, on the muck, you can dig about fo', 5 feets
in some places, an' you got water.  That, that's w-- that's
why the water is so ah, you know, uh, takes care a the stuff
down there so much.  An' when you fin' a place that is dry, it don't
take, it don't, it, that stuff'll burn up.  I mean burn up.  That's
closer goin' up towards the sand cut, ah, sand reed (reef?).
     But now, nowadays they got pumps now, to pump from the
canal.  Pump water all through the ground. See?
