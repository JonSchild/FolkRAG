Negro Communities

Smithfield, the county seat, is the largest town in the county.
Negroes form 29.8 per cent of the 2,543 people in the town. For the most
part the Negro population earns its livelihood in domestic service and unskilled
labor. This community is organized about a few institutions and individuals
which give it character. There are a few commercial establishments
which function as centers for informal social gatherings. The cafes and small
grocery stores commercially provide an immediate convenience but enjoy the
greatest amount of trade when people gather there for recreation. Churches
and the school are the chief centers of organized community life. One distinguishing
institution which Johnston County possesses is a hospital. It
serves as a center for medical service for the whole county and makes the
doctor a force as important as the preachers and teachers.

The doctor, who is a West Indian Negro, has a highly developed
civic and racial consciousness and has been active in important movements
for the benefit of the Negroes in the town and county. He is a person of
wide experience, and is not wholly adjusted to southern mores and customs.
It is one index to the modified racial mores of the area that he is accepted
and is able to remain and practice his profession. Although disliked by some
elements of the white population, he is not disturbed, and he is a hero to
the Negro population. In spite of the fact that there is a better equipped
hospital in the town for white patients than the one maintained by this doctor
for Negroes, about a third of his voluntary patients are white.

The second largest town in the county is Selma, with a population of
1,857, and with a slightly larger proportion of Negroes in the population.
