CHILDREN OF THE PUEBLO INDIANS
LEARNING TO DANCE
The dances of the Pueblo Indians are many and
the costumes worn, are in keeping with the
ceremony. The dance of the chase represents the
Indian in costume, with Buffalo Head and Bow
and Arrow, others with antlers carrying a stick
in each hand to appear four footed adorned with
Fox Skins and Eagle Feathers.
