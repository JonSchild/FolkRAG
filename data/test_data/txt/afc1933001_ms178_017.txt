[*Men and Books*]

January 20, 1942

Mr. Parker Wheatley
Radio Director
Northwestern University
Evanston, Ill.

Dear Mr. Wheatley:

This sentence might read: "Of Men
and Books, with John T. Frederick of
Northwestern University and his guest,
Alan Lomax, Assistant in Charge of the 
Archive of America Folk-song, Library
of Congress." I will try to make my
first five minutes general enough so
that whatever comes from Frederick
next will make plenty of sense, and
will put most of the singing into the
last five. 

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
