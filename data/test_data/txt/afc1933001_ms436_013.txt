will do very very foolish things when they're young and have plenty of 
money.  Well, this Stringbeans grew very famous on this circuit.  He 
used to bring down the house when he sang.:
" I got Elgin Movements in My hips and Twenty Years Guarantee",
"What did Deacon Jones do, My Lord, When the Lights Went Out",
or " Gimme a Little Piece of What You Settin' On," ( meaning the 
girl was setting on a piece of cake-- and such stuff as that.  He sang 
all of these songs to the same tune, but when he would wobble those 
big feet of his, nobody noticed the difference and they liked him right on.
Stringbeans grew very famous and the circuit grew with him.  It got 
so we couldn't find enough talent for all the houses that wanted us-- Mobile,
Pensacola, St. Louis, Tampa, Nashville and so forth and so on.  But back in
thos days I was a winding boy. I didn't like to stay too long in one place or
one occupation.  I wanted to see everytihng.  I wanted to know all the tricks. 
I wanted to go to all the towns and you know yourself that musicins are all 
pretty crazy and if you stay around [the] most of them for very long they likely 
drive you crazy too.
So Stella Harris and I decided to quit in Jackson.  We had decided to 
settle own there a while.  But Stella was a woman you couldn't count on right

at pool to make her come back to me.  When she came back, then was my inning 
and I didn't waste time about kicking out again, because I told her I didn't 
want any woman that acted in the very dirty way she did.  It didn't make no 
difference.  We was nearly broken up anyhow. 
Jackson was always a bad luck town for me and right away it dished 
me up some more.  I left my suit in a pressing shop one day and borrowed an 
old ragged, no account suit from the tailor to look around town.  When
