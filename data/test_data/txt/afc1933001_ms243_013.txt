Dear Alan: I must ask your
help on this letter. "The Cowboys
Lament" comes from Cowboy Songs;
"Cotton Eye Joe" from American Ballads,
"Darling Corey" and "Peter Gray" from
"Our Singing Country" It would
seem that Burl Ives and Columbia
now own the copyright
on these two last songs rather than
us, for it is my understanding
that the copyright on Our
Singing Country is not issued until the
completed book is in the hands
of the Copyright office.
Please straighten out
this tangle. Consider taking it
up with Ives. For my part
