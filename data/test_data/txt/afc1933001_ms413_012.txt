phonograph, using wax cylinders, 
from the singing of cowboys in the 
range and around camp fires. Fortunately, 
much of the music not 
hitherto published is yet preserved 
on these records. This new edition 
of "Cowboy Songs" contains this 
music and also the best tunes and 
songs that have turned up since 
1901. Mr. Edward N. Waters of 
the Music Division of the Library 
of Congress has edited the music. 

Professor George Lyman Kittredge 
once said that "Buffalo 
Skinners," first published in "Cowboy 
Songs," was the most worthy 
example of American balladry. 
But this frontier song has never 
reached the popularity of "Home 
on the Range" which remained unnoticed 
in "Cowboy Songs" for 
more than twenty years. It is quite 
possible that this new edition of
"Cowboy Songs" will uncover 
other tunes which will become as 
popular.
