1. A Toast:
"To the Japanese Navy, bottoms up!"

2. It has been said that now is the time for Negroe's to take
their places in the Navy, but we find that whenever a negro
is appointed to the Naval Academy, I have heard it
said that whites do not want negro officers giving them
orders. I have talked to one fellow myself who entered and
had to leave. It wasn't because the work was too hard,
but because of the extreme social pressure that was
placed upon him. The person in mind was unable
to bear it. Some say this in itself is a hindrance to
the war effort and that there persons advocating all out
effort are doing nothing but talking.

3. Concerning the amount of dead enemy soldiers, there is
a joke: I was talking to an uncle of mine about the war. He
said, "Haven't you heard? I said, "What?" He said, "All of the
Germans and Japs are dead." I asked him where he got
his information. He replied, "According to the papers, there are
no more Germans or Japs, because everyday you read where
500,000 are killed here, 30,000 there. So if you added
them all up, you wouldn't have anymore to fight. We are fighting
ghosts now because they are rising from the dead."

4. A friend told me that he didn't have any reason to go
overseas to fight, because there was a more important battle
at home.

5. Another fellow said why should I fight the Germans,
I am not mad with them
