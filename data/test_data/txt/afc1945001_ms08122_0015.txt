[*A*]                                                                 Rumor

There have been a great many rumors
going around, but the one most often heard now is about clothes rationing. Since shoes have
been rationed, people are saying that their
will soon be an acute shortage of clothing. Although Washington has denied these rumors saying that materials are plentiful, and will 
only be rationed if people rush to stores and 
buy whatever clothing they possibly can. 

People who believe such rumors are 
very silly, because if they do buy large 
quantities of clothing, it will soon be too 
small or else they will not event to wear 
it because it is out of style. In other words 
they are just wasting their money. 

Even if there is rationing of clothes, 
I see no reason why people should rush 
to stores to get clothing. They will all get 
their fair amount if they wait till 
rationing is begun. And according to 
the rumors clothes rationing should have 
begun March 1.
