There are rumors going around about horse meat. I heard one girl say, her mother went to buy a beef roast and the man came out with a piece of horse & offered it to her for beef to (???) she knew it was she said she use to eat it when they were in the South. But someone said when they put horse (???) to be sold they were supposed to let us know it.
