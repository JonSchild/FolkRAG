What a wonderful trip that will be; 
All ready to go, washed in Calvary's flow; 
That'll be the last moving for me. 

2 

I've seen wonderful sights as I traveled about; 
How little, how empty, they seem.
When I make my last move to the city of gold,
And behold what a vision could dream. 

3 

The prophets of old shall I meet over there; 
Those teachers that guided me right. 
I shall meet the apostles and Jesus my Lord; 
I believe I shall know them at sight. 

4 

Here I'm bothered with packages each time that I
move, 
Go carrying a load in each hand; 
But I'll not need one thing that I've used in this
world, 
When I move to that heavenly land. 

5 

Everything that I need will be furnished up there, 
Not even a song book I'll bring; 
Or the precious old Bible that taught me the way, 
I'll not need when I stand by my King. 

6 

Here I'm constantly saying farewell to my friends 
And parting brings heartaches and pains; 
When I make my last move to that city on high, 
We shall meet to part no more.
