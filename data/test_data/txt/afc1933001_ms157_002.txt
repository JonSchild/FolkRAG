Dear Alan:

I just got your scripts and read them 
immediately. As I don't know when you plan [s] to be here 
again, I'm sending you a few notes. I am not sending the 
scripts. Let me know if you want them.

I like the railroad work songs script much better 
than the other. The continuity is very simple, but it 
has a progression and dramatic power which the other lacks 
for me. The work songs script seems to me not always 
clear, frequently dull because of repetition of devices, 
much too obvious clues, etc. This script I think falls 
between the very simple, straight type of presentation you 
use in the railway script and a more sophisticated, more 
dramatized continuity which would be possible with this 
material.

Can you use the scripts as they are?  or even 
modified? Don't they belong to CBS?  The railway song script 
would be fine to put on the stage just as is - illustrating 
with pantomime and sound; I think it would be very 
effective even if one had only a handful of people.

The other material, I would prefer to see presented 
much more simply. Just as a series of songs, with some 
comment or introduction by you. The transitional dialogue, 
etc. would need much work, if it were to be used -

I enclose a quote from a letter Joris recently 
received from MacLeish. All of Joris' requests to MacLeish 
were refused. Joris wrote a letter saying what the hell, 
yesterday got an answer from MacLeish saying that he always 
wanted to see Joris, had great esteem for him, etc. Joris 
had asked that he give him at least three hours next time 
he (Joris) was in Washington.

If you can do anything, fine. Otherwise we'll have 
to wait until Joris can again see MacLeish, and hope that 
his visit with MacLeish will produce results. As you will 
see from the enclosed quote MacLeish apparently completely 
forgot what he himself proposed.

Joris is also sending you a copy of his letter to 
MacLeish (sent many weeks ago) to which the enclosure 
presumably is an answer. Very discouraging to say the 
least.

All this is confidential, of course; would you 
in the course of time return both the enclosure and the copy 
Joris is sending you. Return them to me.

Let me know when I can expect to see you.
