What would you expect from a pig but a grunt?
Knows no more than cows do know 
about a holiday. 

A fine doorfull of a woman 
- a sharp tongue - like a 
keen wind of March that blows 
at every side of the hedge - 

Make them shine like a cat's 
eyes under the bed.

He shook like a dog in a 
wet sack -

Pots boiling - white horses on um -
he's the spit out of his father's 
mouth -

I wouldn't call the king my uncle

Tramp impudence

I'm a hail stone maker out of work
for want of snow

Overpaid you bought every hair of her tail
