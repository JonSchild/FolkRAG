[*meaning of bastard*]
How the peoples talks about him, you
see, 'cause they didn't know what a bastard chile was, y'see.   And
they thought that if a man wasn't married to a woman -- well, you know the
marriage then wasn't like it is now you see.  They only -- [well,] some of them
did different things, then to marry, you see, 'cause my grandmother
and grandfather[y], they jumped over the brooms and married, first time.
Next [the] time they married by the people's paper.  An' one time, at
that time, they would pay the parents so much money -- 30 pieces of silver,
y'know -- and would get [their] that daughter.  That was all there was to
that.  You see?  That was all there was to it. [So if it wasn't] Ain't but one married,
[years] there is in the world [and that's one that the] [and marriage]
[in the world (??)] -- and that's love.  That's the only marriage that
can be.  And you can [read] join how many papers y'want together; there's
nothin' to that, not anything.  Cause you just,  you  Every county, every state, will do
it just to get that money to put it into whatever they doin' it for.
[Yet the state don't care]  But still they ain't carin' how you get along, y'see? [He.]   So [there] yet and that is

or for spite, or somethin' like that, and the Lord wants to let
you 'get children, they ain't no such thing [like] as that.  Because
He say, "He that denys God for his father is a bastard," and that's
all there is to it.   God is your father, you see? And anyone said
that God is not the Father, why, that's the Bastard, you see and that's the
onlyiest bastard that is, that can be, [you see? And deny that God]
[is the Father] and they's so many of 'um, y'see?  And (they) deny
that God is the Father; God's the father of everybody.  But now,
who you be the father of, you got nothin' to do with it.  You're likely
to be the father of some [brown (?)] body's dog [(?)] if you mess with it.
You see what I mean? You call it a bastard chile; you got it; he
ain't no bastard.  That's the thing about that.  An' so, that's why
[it appears] these peoples that [I] don't understand:  I don't worry about that, 'cause
