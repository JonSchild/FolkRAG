Dear Mr. Spivacke:

John A Lomax, who has one of the Archive recording
machines in Texas, has decided to devote himself in the
early summer to the collection of cowboy songs, cattle hollers,
and the stories of oldtime cattle men in Texas.

Strangely enough, although Mr. Lomax's books cover fully
the field of western songs, the Archive has very few good field
recordings from the West, and this planned trip of his to
western Texas, New Mexico and western Oklahoma will help to fill
a large geographical gap in our collections. Mr. Lomax plans to
go to Austin, San Antonio, Taylorville, Alpine, Toyah, Abilene,
Pampa, on to New Mexico, to Henryetteville, Oklahoma, and back to
Dallas, Texas, again. He will probably travel about 6000 miles on
this trip.

I suggest the following budget:

6000 miles at 5 cents a mile       $300.00
60 days at $5.00 per diem             300.00
100 discs at 75 cents a disc             75.00
4 needles at $4.00                             16.00
Miscellaneous                                    75.00
                                                         $766.00
10 % for laboratory expenses         76.60
                                                         $842.60

Respectfully yours,
