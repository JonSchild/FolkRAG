Even a christian virtue is satirized.

There was a mother who was trying to raise a God fearing 
child.  That meant when he told a lie, she would ask, or 
would get him to get on his knees and ask the Lord for 
forgiveness.  The little boy was around ten years old.  
One day while the mother was in the kitchen cooking, the 
little boy was outdoors playing.

He was looking at a collie dog, and ran into the house, 
saying, "Oh, mother come here, come here, come here!  Here's 
a bear out here."

The mother ran to the door and looked.  She said, "Son, 
you ought to be ashamed, that ain't no bear, that's a collie 
dog.  Now you have told a story; go upstairs and get on your 
knees, and ask the Lord to forgive you."

The little boy went on up to his room and stayed a little 
while.  Then he ran back down, and said, "Oh mother, God 
says he couldn't forgive me for that, because he thought it 
was a damn bear himself." 11.

There are other factors making the minister a less important 
person in the community.  One of them is the fact that he is not an 
integral part of the community and, thus, the relationship between the 
minister and his congregation lacks the personal nature.  In the past, 
the very fact of the preacher's presence in the community led the 
people to live within a certain moral bound; the people feared that he 
might be around.  The preacher of to-day does not work out in the field
He is a city man and is pastor of many churches.  He offers his "spiritual 
guidance" only once a month and he does this for a sum of money.  
In brief, he is no longer a symbol of subtle personal control.

Some of the Negro ministers in the Delta are aware of the demoralizing 
influence of the city.  Others, though few in number, try t
reverse the inevitable changes by stressing the value of the traditiona
