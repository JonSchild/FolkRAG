Dear Alan - 

I took off for three months, went to Canada, relaxed, did nothing 
but sleep, swim, talk, drink, & sit around with old friends. It was 
my first vacation since I was a boy &, full of self-pity, I found it 
easy to justify.

No progress was made on the film during my absence; no funds have been 
forthcoming from foundations; the chief cutter-editor is now in Paris, 
on assignment for Kennedy, & will not return for five weeks. I suspect 
that all this may be the rule, not the exception, & that it would be 
reasonable to anticipate a very slow production. Added to these 
administrative problems, there are production ones. We shot 
a master take of each scene with playbacks.  It was obvious, during 
the actual filming, that the playbacks weren't in sync, but how far 
out they were wasn't obvious until we began to edit. Some of the 
best visual material is unusable; what playback footage we do use will 
require the tightest, most demanding editing. The lesson is clear: 
never attempt playbacks with performers unaccustomed to this standard 
Hollywood technique.   In the future we will use five cameras & simply 
do retakes, recording sight & sound together.

Why don't I simply mail to you various rolls of master takes with 
the relevant sound tracks, the two being separate but with sync marks. 
Could you arrange to project these in any big film lab that has 35mm 
screening facilities with a professional projectionist? In the long 
run, this is much cheaper (in Hollywood it costs $9.50 an hour) & far 
safer than rigging up something through a friend or attempting it on 
a Moviola which invariably turns into a meat-chopper & shreds the film 
& track.  Since the material I send will be our only work copies, their 
safety worries me.  Keep the film a few weeks & then just return it 
express collect.   I still hope that we can arrange to give you a complete 
workprint with sound track, but this will have to wait for foundation 
support, if only minimal.

Let me know where & when to ship.

Best wishes,

Ted
