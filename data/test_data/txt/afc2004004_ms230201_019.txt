Worked all last summer and part the fall,
Had to take my Christmas in my overalls.
I told the boss-man, my feet was cold,
"God damn yo' feet, boy, let the wheelers roll."

[The Kid]
Natchez:   Looky here, Kid, did you ever work for the Loran brothers,
                 built all them levees?
The Kid:    Sho, sho I did.
Natchez:   How many of 'em did you know?

                few of them people an' they lived a long time.  I mean, 
                 I think they was something like the Rockefellers,

                 was a Loran junior and then the third, the fourth, 
                 the fifth... They always have been and they is now--
                 Loran brothers.

Natchez:  Yeah, some of those fellas was big businessmen in towns
                 an' some of 'em would run extry gangs and levee camps an' 
                 road camps...

                 couldn't spen' you money no place but with the Loran
                 brothers.
