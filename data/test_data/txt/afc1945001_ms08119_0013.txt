1. This is a joke that some boys
in the army played, that I
heard about. A bunch of them
got together and one of them cut up the
corporal's shoes. He was very 
angry and resolve to find 
the guilty one, but meanwhile
they were not allowed to leave
camp. They offered to buy
him another pair. That's all
I know and can't tell if
he found the guilty one or not,
or if he took the shoes offered him
