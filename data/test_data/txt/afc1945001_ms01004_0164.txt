Dear Dr. Will:

I have told you about the study of rumors
which we are working on. Enclosed for your consumption 
is the set of rumors picked up about Negroes
and among Negroes. They have not been carefully
processed or studied but merely categorized.

Despite their rough condition, I think you
will find them interesting, particularly the large
number of rumors in circulation in the South relating 
to domestic service. It is easy to see from
these how the Eleanor Club" rumor and its corollaries
got started.

We will be glad to keep you up to date on
the conclusions from this study when they are arrived
at.

Sincerely yours,

Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
