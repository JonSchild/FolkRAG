AL: This is when you were working in the packing plant?
BJ: Tha's right. In a, ah, canning factory. That was up in,
that was up in the eastern shore of Maryland.
An' ah, I jus' got outa that thing; the way I acted when everybody's
actin' nice. An', ha, I act nice, too, but I, but I, ha! I
put his han' on me again. An' we play
with him all the time! Hmm, hmm, hmm!
But that jus' show you, ya know, that, 'cause what she said was
true. She says, she said, "They made ya that way," she said, "They
don't, they don't want you to -- them -- want you to touch them
an' he touch you then; that made you jus' run all through
ya." Said, "That, that's the cause of it." Just talked just as
nice as she could. Said, "They made you like that." See?
Said, "You wasn't, you wouldn'ta been that way, but they

You know, I went on inside. I said, "Lawd," I went in that
bathroom; I told God, "Jus' forgive me." I wa'n a, I wa'n a
Christian then, but I always did talk to God. I said, "Lawd,
you forgive me, I'll never [tell]do that no mo'." I never would, an'
so...

I met Mr. Todd again out his station wagon, [like that] met there. I called,
I talked to him. I says, "Hello, man!"
He stopped. Jus' kinda looked at 'im...I tol'...I, I had to
go u[ funny, to get myself together. Ha, to tell 'im, ya know,
that I was sorry.
