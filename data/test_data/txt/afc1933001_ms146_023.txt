Dear Mr. Wetherald:

I shall be very glad to see you
some time between June 27 and 30, but I 
should appreciate a more definite appointment
as soon as you can make it.

Mr. Alan Lomax will be in Camden next
week to visit Mr. Forman and if you are
there then, you might arrange to see him.

Very truly yours,


Harold Spivacke 
Chief, Division of Music
