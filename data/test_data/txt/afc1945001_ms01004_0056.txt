Miss Charlotte Hatton           -2-            September 1, 1942

cracking of price ceilings, refusal of management
or labor to comply with government orders; problems
connected with racial and ethnic minorities - e.g.
discrimination in their employment in war industries
or volunteer war activities, violation of their civil
liberties, open racial conflicts, subversive movements
among fascist-inclined aliens, alien round-ups; housing
and health problems and changes in the cost of
living - e.g. housing shortages, rental strikes, withdrawal
of physicians, prevalence of communicable 
diseases, changes in family living costs.

It is important to receive reports on local problems early in
their development - hence, the special value of news items on public
protests, mass meetings, petitions, certain types of arrests, any
sign either through community reaction or information of events likely
to lead to tension or lowering of morale.

In addition there are a number of specific problems or problem
areas on which we would like to have "back files" of clippings as well
as continuous reporting:   Detroit, Boston, St. Louis, and "discrimination"
since January 1, 1942; registration of women, morale and rumors -
since July 1, 1942.
