Dear Mrs. Wilson:

Mr. John Lomax informs me that he would 
like to take advantage of your kind offer to 
permit him to record the material which you 
described in your previous letters. He would 
prefer to make these records before the fifteenth 
of this month. Will you please communicate 
directly with Mr. Lomax in regard to 
this matter. He may be reached at Murrell's
Inlet, South Carolina.

Allow me to thank you again for your 
willingness to cooperate with us.

Sincerely yours,

HS:ep
