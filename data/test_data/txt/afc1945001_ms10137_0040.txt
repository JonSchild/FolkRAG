Sophomore-White-Female

1.  There was a woman who went to the
grocery store.  She asked whether she
could have some coffee.  The clerk
said, have you your rationing book.
The answer was no, he said I'm
sorry lady.  Then she asked if
she could have some sugar but
the clerk said again that you
must have your rationing book
with you.

The lady walked out and then
came back in.  She said Well!
I've got my ass with me
can I have some toilet paper.
