to your readers for copies of frontier songs will doubtless result in valuable material. I shall greatly appreciate your help to this extent, and your further favor in forwarding to me whatever material may come into your hands.

May I add that ballads, and the like, which because of crudity, incompleteness, coarseness, or for any other reason are unavailable for publication, will be as interesting and as useful for my purposes as others of more merit. It is my desire to collect the songs and ballads now or lately in actual existence and in the precise form which they have popularly assumed.

Yours very respectfully,
JOHN A. LOMAX.

HARVARD UNIVERSITY, April 12, 1907.

Mr. Lomax's plan has our hearty approval. The materials which he collects are to be preserved in the Harvard College Library, where they will always be accessible to investigators.
