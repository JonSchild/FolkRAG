Mr. E. C. Beck
Central State Teachers College
Mount Pleasant, Michigan

Dear Mr. Beck:

My father and I were delighted to receive your cordial
letter and of course you will be give due credit in the
publication of "Little Brown Bulls" and Bill McBride's 
version of "Darby Ram", which we decided at the last minute
to include.

Father is now on his way to Texas, by way of Canada, and
although he is on vacation it might be I can persuade him to 
stop off in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood within the next
three or four weeks. I know he will hit it off beautifully
with your lumberjack friends and although he may not have
time to record everything they know, at least he will be able
to get a sample of their best material. This material, of
course, will always be first available to you and whenever
you plan to publish your songs, the Division will be happy to
be of service to you.

You have not said whether you wish the records to be
restricted. Naturally the Library prefers to have as much
unrestricted material as possible, although we are desirous
of cooperating with collectors wherever possible. I should
like for purposes of record, a statement from you about the
use you wish to be made of the records, whether you want them
restricted or not, and ifso, for how long. The usual period
is for two years, with an extension of this time optional and
to be agreed upon at the end of this period.

Cordially yours,

Alan Lomax 
Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
