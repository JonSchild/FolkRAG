TAPE 78. JEANNIE ROBERTSON.
Skippin' Barfoot Through the Heather:

1) For it's up a wild and a lonely glen
    It was shared by many lofty mountain,
    For it being into the busy hands of men,
    It being the first day that I went out a-hunting.

2) For it being to me a happy day,
    There did I spy my roving fancy,
    She was herding her yowes to their knowes,
    And in amongst the carling  heather.

3) For her coat was white, her gown was green,
    Her body it being long and slender,
    Wi' her cast-down look and her weel-far'd face,
    It has oftimes made my heart to wander.

4) For it's I've been to balls where they were busty and braw,
    And it's I've been as far as Balquiddher,
    And the bonniest lassie that ever I saw
    She was kilted and barefooted amongst the heather.

5) Says i, "My less, will you come with me.
    And sleep with me in a bed of feathers?
    I'll gie ye silks and scarlets that will make ye shine,
    And leave all your mairns amongst the heather."

6) She said, "My lad, you're very fair,
    I really think you're all for sportin'.
    For it's your being the son of a high squire man,
    And me but a poor humble shepherd's daughter.

7) But it's her I sought, and her I got,
    And it's her I really intend to marry.
    Fare-ye-weel, fare-ye-well to your heathery hills,
    Fare-ye-weel, fare-ye-weel, my song it is ended.

The Bonny Young Lassie That Never Said No:

1) I come to Lacross and I met a wee lass,
    Says I? "My wee lassie are you willing to go?"
    "Make sure of the gill," she said, "Sir, I will,
    For I'm the wee lassie that never said no."

2) It's into an ale-house we merrily did go,
    And we never did rise till the cock it did crow.
    And it's glass tipped to glass and merrily we did toast
    To the bonnie wee lassie who never said no.
