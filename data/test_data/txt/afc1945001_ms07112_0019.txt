Subject:     Phoenix,  Arizona,  Hospital Project



That the Phoenix,  Arizona,  hospital project  ($455,000)  was
turned down by the Vital Area Board, meeting in SanFrancisco, 
on August 3.
Considerable political pressure and interest in this caused
the rumor to fly, but Vital Board did not consider this project.
