BJ TAPE 20, p. 87

TL:  Why do you reckon?
BJ:  Because they. . .Because, I don't care how poor they are, ah,
poor peoples eat better'n rich peoples. . .It seems foolish, don't it?
But it's true
TL:  Yeah.  Why?
BJ:  Well, because they got pride.  They, they eat good things.
They got to buy the hard things 'cause they got to work.  You
know, buy, they got to buy sumpin' to hold 'em up to work.  See?
Tha's right.
TL:  And they know. . .
BJ:  An' dey know that, dey know they go to have that.  If they
don't, they git sick, and they cain't work.  They be too weak to
work.  Rich one ain't got to work an' he know he ain't got all
that exercise what -- That why they got to go out in the, in the
ocean an' all that kinda thing an', an' stretch out an' chuck
balls.  What they call it?  Play golf.  An' all that kind mess
jus' ta, ta exercise theyself.  See?  'Cause they ain't workin'.
     Sometime I look out an' see 'me doin' it, in the water?
An' swimmin' an' doin' all them other kinda ol' foolish exercise?
An' all like that.  I say to myse'f, "If I had you behin'
a plow, dogged if you wouldn't git some exercise!  You'll eat
tonight."  Huh!  Yeah, I said to myself there a-many times.
     So that's why, you see, the poor peoples have got to work.
Not only colored, the white an' all.  They got to work for they
livin', why, they eats right.  An' that they eats good food.  Ya
see, an' that's why, they, they, they, they recognize ya bein'
poor, ya eatin' all that gahgy.  They call it gahgy food, ya
see?  Yeah!
TL:  Gahgy?
