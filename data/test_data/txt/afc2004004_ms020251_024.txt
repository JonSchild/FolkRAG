SINK THE TITANIC

I don't remember all of this.  It wasn't a game; it was just a 
little thing we did out in the yard because "Sink the Titanic"
was a dance that the women really did.  They would see how far
back they they could go; they would go back more and more; some
of them almost down to the ground.  My, that was some dance!
There are more verses; I can remember only a little bit of it.

I'm gonna sink Titanic,
Sink Titanic,
Sink Titanic,
I'm gonna sink it to the ground.

Sink Titanic,
Sink it on down,
Sink Titanic,
Sink it to the ground.

I'm gonna sink Titanic,
Sink Titanic,
Sink Titanic,
Sink Titanic down.
