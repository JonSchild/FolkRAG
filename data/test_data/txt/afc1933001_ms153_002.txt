Dr. Spivacke,
  Dr. Robert Gordons has asked me for a duplicate of one of Halpert's Virginia play party recordings in connection with his research of Dixie. The duplication could be done by Shannon Allen on the small smaple acetate accompanying this original. It might be wise first to consult Charley Seeger on the matter of permission.
                                  Alan Lomax

                  Assistant in charge of the Archive of American Folk Song

Dr. Gordon adds that he does not intend to publish this tune but only compose it will among others.
