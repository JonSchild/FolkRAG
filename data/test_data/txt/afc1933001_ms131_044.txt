Hand Me Down my Walking Cane

You Got to Walk that Lonesome Valley
I Cannot Tell How Much I Owe

When I Reach that City on the Hill
I Laid Off the Old Coat and Put on the New
If the Light Has Gone Out in Your Soul
When the Roll is Called up Yonder
Little David, Play on Your Harp

Ten Elders, Pineville, Ky
