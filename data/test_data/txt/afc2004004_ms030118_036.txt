     Naw, they don't h ave to look up.  Dey can deman d
what they want, if they don't git it, you understand.  God made you
like a storehouse.  You can give in if you wanna, or go on about
yo ur business.  It don't bother you.  We have to git down, po lil
fellow, like a dog, an take a cussin out fur it.  Thass why I have
such deep sympathy fur a man.  He work hard all day for what he
want, an then come in at night an take a cussin out.  I'm in deep
sympathy fur a man.  Deep sympathy.  It hurts me when a woman
mistreats a man.  It hurts me.
     (Pat:  What about when a man mistreats a woman?)
     Well, I'm not in favor of that either.
     (Me:  Rev. Davis, do you think that women have a right
to refuse a man if she doesn't want him?)
     Well, if she don't want him, certny.
