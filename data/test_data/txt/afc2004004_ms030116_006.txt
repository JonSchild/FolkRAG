tried to force him to build a high fence around his house so they couldn't
see him. He refused. They said, "Don't set on your front porch no mo if
you wanna live. We won't see you theah."

    Feller ordered a fine automobile. Got it at a garage. A white man
said, "What you gon do wid that car?" "Drive it." "No you ain't. Ain't no
ground in this state you can drive that car on an live. That car is too
fine for a nigger. No white man in this county has a car that good."
"I bought this car, paid for it." "Send it back and git your money back."
He sent it back an got his money. That was the only car he wanted, but
after a while he bought a Ford. They tole him, "You can have a Overland,
a Ford, a Chevolet, sumpin like that. But you can't have a (Switzen?) spatz.
It costs too much money."

    We've got too many rebbish-head people. You know what I'm talkin about - 
cruel people. Rebbish-head. (mutters) Lord, should I say that? (throws
back his head, closes his eyes and prays) Jesus, I won't never say it till
you give me a sign. (a wait. Evidently Jesus gives him a sign) Jesus, I
thank you. (begins) Rich man, he always think himself above such poor
people (poor whites involved in four or five houses, farms) Still that
rich man will stick to his own kind.
    Bible said, Out of one blood brought all nations. God had no respect
of persons.
    For the respect of all persons on earth. We are not dogs. Why should
somebody take you out an kill you like a chicken? No law fur a dog in
Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina than fur a colored pusson.
    Now. Heah what I think. Less love one another. I mean the godly love.
If they lectricute me bout a white woman, less lectricute the white man
over a colored woman. I'm in favor of the lectric chair.
