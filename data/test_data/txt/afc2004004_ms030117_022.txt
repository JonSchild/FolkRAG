Reel 1, Side 2

Reverend Gary Davis
     As I tole you jus a while ago, we moved to these
diff'rent places an as I came about lucid I would take
a tin pan, take and driv  a hole through it, an put me a
nekc in it, you understand, an take me a brace-and-bit
an bore me a hole an make me a instrument.  My grandmother
whipped me so much bout tearin up pie-pans.  She'd
come in to cook an make pie an the pan would be done tore
up.  Till she see it wouldn't do no good.  So every time
she go to the store she'd buy me one when she'd buy
huh one.  So she wouldn't have me to whup bout it.  So. . .
Fust thing I ever owned was a banjo.  I larnt how to play
that.  My stepfather brought me the banjo.  I was a little
bitty kid.  I wasn't nothin' like seven years old.  Just
a little bitty kid.  Nobody taught me to play it.  I jes kep
on knockin round till I larnt how to strike a tune mysef.
(How did your stepfather come to buy you that banjo?)
He seemed to see that there was talent about me -- that
that was my talent.  Everytime he come into the house I
had done sat down and string up pieces of string on a board,
or sumpin like that.  Put a bridge an be pickin on it.  It
seemed that was my talent.  (Who was your Uncle William
who bought you your French harp?  Was that your mother's 
older brother?)  Next older brother.  He was very devoted to
me.  From my childhood on up I never knowed him to hit me
but twice in his life.  (What did you do when he did hit you?)
