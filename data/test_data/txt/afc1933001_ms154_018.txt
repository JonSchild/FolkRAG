SUCCESS.... No more talented
artist ever lived in Alabama than
Mary Gillen.  Her home was in
Bessemer, but Birmingham claimed
her as well, for she spent much of
her time here and contributed her
talent generously to the pleasure of 
the public.  Her marriage to Joe
Tucker, of Chattanooga, took her
there to live, and after his death
she went to Jacksonville, Fla.,
where she now resides, and it's of
her popularity and success in Florida 
that this story has to do.
Singing, story-telling, composing, 
acting, Mary Gillen has made a 
place in the sun for herself in her
new home, where it is said that no
program is complete without her
presence.  She has captured Jacksonville 
with her unique art, and 
her latest success is connected with 
the words she has written to one of
Harold Hanft's songs, "Dixie Lou,"
which has taken New York by
storm.  The song has been featured
by numbers of popular orchestras
on Broadway and the critics have 
spoken in highest terms of the composition.
All of which is pleasing to the
many friends of Mary Gillen in Alabama, 
none of whom will ever forget 
her splendid monologue, "The
Hanging," one of the most amusing
things she has ever done.
