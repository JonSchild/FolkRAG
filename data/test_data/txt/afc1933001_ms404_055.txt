On Sunday, September 8, 1940 Bess Brown
Lomax and I loaded our machine
into the car and drove a hundred
miles to Glenrose, Texas. There
we recorded until near sundown
the singing of [Pr] Newton
C. Gaines, Professor of Physics in
Texas Christian University, Ft Worth,
Texas. Professor Gaines had hidden
away in a tourist's cabin of this
village health resort for a 
few weeks of rest. Fortunately
an electric tower line ran
through that section, so that our
batte[rie]ries were not needed.

Professor Gaines' [fondness] fondness
for cowboy songs and other [ballad] ballad
