MEMORANDUM  
[*Katz*]

April 14, 1942 

To:              Mr. Keith Kane 

From:         Robert Huse 

Subject:      Receipt and Processing of Rumour Information 

Some time ago Mr. MacLeish addressed a meeting of 
the regional directors of the Social Security Board. These 
are 12 men--and women--supervising the staffs of anywhere 
from 25 to 150 field personnel in charge of 12 regions 
covering the entire country. 

Mr. MacLeish's speech so interested them that the 
suggestion has followed that this field organization could 
cooperate with the Office of Facts and Figures by reporting 
in to us rumours which they hear or other information bearing 
upon public opinion. 

They were really quite anxious to do something and 
the only problem that arises is whether you are or can be 
set up to handle an increased volume of such mail effectively. 
There is no point in asking these people to do something of 
this sort unless real use of the material can be made of it 
here. It is problematical what the volume would be and only 
experience would indicate but with 500 field offices reporting 
in through 12 regional offices it is not fantastic to believe 
that you would get approximately 250 letters or memoranda 
a week through this system.

Mr. MacLeish has already informally approved [my] putting such 
a system into effect experimentally with the Social Security 
Board and later with the Department of Agriculture and 
possibly other departments provided you feel that the 
material would be useful and providing we can actually use 
it to good purpose. 

I suggest that you advise me on this only in respect 
to the Social Security Beard experiment, leaving to a later 
date the question of whether such a system could usefully 
be extended to other agencies.
