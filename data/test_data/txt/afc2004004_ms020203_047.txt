Chorus: O candy,
Candy gal,
Swing um in a hurry,
Candy gal,
Swing um in a hurry,
Candy gal,
I bought her
Candy gal,

Candy gal.

Then we'd ring right back up.

I'm ridin' in a buggy,
O yes, o yes,
It's a golden bright buggy,
O yes, yes.

Stop still and lemme tell you,
Now choose you two pardners...
And I wants a good rappin...

O candy,
Candy gal,
O candy ,
Candy gal,

Swing um in a hurry,
Candy gal,
Swing um in a hurry,
Candy gal...

A: How would you play that?
V: Be rung up. We'd ring up in the same ring we played speckled
lady in. But when I say "stop still and lemme tell you" we all
up stop an drop hands. An I say--Now choose you two parnders--
somebody step out the ring and get two girls or maybe one girl
and a boy--They say--O yes O yes--. And I'd tell the rest of um

chorus.) We'd be swingin um. Ring right back up...
