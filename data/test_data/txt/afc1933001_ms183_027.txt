I understand that in Professor and Mrs. Oakley we have
mutual friends.  We rejoiced in having them for a number of years
at this University.

Very sincerely yours,

R.C. Archibald

P.S.  I am naturally curious as to how I happened to receive a copy
of your Check-List.  Possibly on the recommendation of my friend
Mr. Mellinger Henry.
