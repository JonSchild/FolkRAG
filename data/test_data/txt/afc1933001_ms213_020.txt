Somewhere, somehow it ought to be possible 
to write scientifically and yet
preserve vital interest in the story, enough,
at any rate, to attract an occasional
reader. I don't want to print any 
other sort of material in our 
book.
Go ahead and do your stint, even
if you are busy. I want to 
put into the hands of Mr. Latham a
complete book so good that he 
wont dare cut it down. I'll 
even go over him to Mr. Pratt.
I seemed to have failed to impress 
Mr. Putman.  Should the 
pressure be too great on you in 
your present line-up, I'll go 
ahead and bring along my best 
efforts for your approval before 
handing it to the publishers.
Lovingly, Father
I made your note bear 6% increase. I am borrowing 
money at that rate.  If you can get it at 3 or 4%,
I am in the market for some; you, too, should borrow 
at that rate and not pay more.
