are repeated because of their universal popularity in this country. However, the bulk of the material, in my judgment, is native in origin. Before finally submitting the copy to the printer, my young son, Alan, and I traveled throughout the South visiting Negroes in the penitentiary, in lumber camps far back in the woods, negro communities where there were very few whites and the negro himself owns the land. Our object was to find the Negro who has least contact with the white in order to secure from him songs as free as possible from the idiom of the white man as well as his conventional phrasing. Our special object was to secure the words and music of the negro secular songs, his "reels" or "sinful" songs. Every song is "sinful" which does not deal with a religious topic. The secular songs are of tremendous interest because in them the negro is inclined to express his ideas with great freedom. They are [visibly] under a record his contact with life, his hopes, fears, ambitions, motives, jealousies, his philosophy of life, even sometimes his opinion of his white neighbors. Many of these are "made-up" or "jumped-up" songs, in unison by the negroes when they are at work. Work on the farm like hoeing, picking cotton, cutting wood, stripping cane, is done by gangs of laborers with a gang leader. The voice or the rhythm controls the speed of the work. The negro also sings these rhythmic songs of labor when building levees, tamping or laying the ties of a railroad, loading streamers with freight, compressing cotton in the penitentiaries of the South, where gang labor is necessarily still used, we find these songs still preserved. It is quite true that much of the work of the South, at least in  recent years, has been done to the accompaniment of songs, but it must be hand labor, not with the machinery
