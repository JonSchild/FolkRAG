Bob Roberts. . .Recorded at Penmill, November 27, 1953.
1)  There were two lofty ships that from old England came,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we,
One was the Prince of Luther and the other Prince of Wales,
Sailing down along the coast of High Barbaree.
2)  "Aloft there, aloft," our jolly bosun cried,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we,
"Look ahead and look a-stern, a-weather and a-lee,"
Lock down along the coast of High Barbaree.
3)  There's nought upon the stern and there's nought upon the lee,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we,
But there's a lofty ship to windward and she's sailing fast and free,
Sailing down along the coast of High Barbaree.
4)  "O hail her, o hail her," our gallant captain cried,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we,
"Are you a man-of-war or a privateer?" says he,
Sailing down along the coast of High Barbaree.
5)  "I'm not a man-of-war nor a privateer," said he,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we,
"But I'm a salt sea pirate a-looking for me fee,"
Locking down along the coast of High Barbaree.
6)  So broadside and broadside and hour on hour they lay,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we,
Until the Prince of Luther shot the pirate's mast away,
Sailing down along the coast of High Barbaree.
7)  "O quarter, o quarter!" these pirates then did cry,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we,
The quarter that we gave them, we sunk them in the sea,
Sunk 'em down along the coast of High Barbaree.
8)  And oh, it was a cruel sight and grieved us full sore,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we,
To see 'em all a-drowning as they tried to swim ashore,
Sailing down along the coast of High Barbaree.
