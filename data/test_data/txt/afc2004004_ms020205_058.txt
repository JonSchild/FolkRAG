Reverend Roe. Reel 2. P. 6

Well, when they refused to ordain me, I went to this church that I had
the dream about. They ordained me. I went on and taken my church,
and I moved that church down where I planted that tree. And that
church growed, and before the people knew what I was doing there, I
had a church equal to nearly any church in the city. Yes, sir, there was
something that led me, you know.
A:  What did you think the dream meant? What did those little clear
pools of water mean, did you think?
R:  I think that meant my ministry of life -- sometimes things
would be clear and sometimes muddy; I believe that was what it meant.
And it's been like that.
A:  And why do you think you went down in the south part of town?
R:  Well, my dream. Yeah, and because I dreamed that and set a tree out
down there. Well, I didn't have that in mind when I went, but after
I went and church began to grow, you know, and thrive, then it
come to me about that tree, and I said "Well that was the Lord leading me down there, I  guess."
there until I got ready to go -- I was called to another church and left.
Other ministers came behind me and they said it was a mighty good
church. So, before I went, I come back for the Shaman, a
a preacher had split the Bethlehem church, taken this little churh off from it,
you know, and that was why they would recognize the call, when they called me.
So, after I had built the church they called the preacher
and they fell out with him, he'd taken sick, and they sent him out of the
pulpit right on the street, on the cot, when he was able to go --
the deacons did.
Soon after then, they lost the church and this church that I built there
and they bought and then it's a good church, thriving and well.
Yes.
A:  Well, after all, it proves that the Lord was leading you
