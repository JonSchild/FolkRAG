EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
OFFICE FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To:  Mr. Eugene Katz
From:  Eugene Horowitz

Office of Government Reports, Division of Press Intelligence, 
1526 14th Street, N. -- Executive 3300, Extension 190,
issues daily:  Press Intelligence Bulletin.

As is -- would be useful to have it coming into office
daily, and kept of file -- (It is now available in other parts of Room 300).

Categories into which news items are placed seem defined by governmental groups; ;e.g. labor disputes under Labor; discrimination
is indexed under Civil Liberties (under Justice Dept.) and under
Negro discrimination which is scattered, e.g. under employment under 
Labor Supply ;and Manpower and under Discrimination under Labor Supply
and Manpower (not a Govt. department).

Could we not get them to establish a category on "protests", "crises" 
in which they could place mass meetings, riots, editorials of complaint
as well as cross references to material like that on strikes, discriminations,
labor shortages, unemployment?

This is all going to be B of I eventually so let's not ask for it.
Now?  See attached for suggestion
