thinking it was funny, so we gathered up our belongings 
and [got] flew out of there.

There are the God-damndest pictures of 
Hitler around here I ever saw - all dressed 
up in white armor on a black horse like 
Joan of Arc, and they call it The Standard-Bearer.
It's a painting of course; I wanted to buy one for 
you but they cost about five bucks. Goebbels certainly 
fell down there; Elizabeth & I stand in front 
of the store window and roar at it for hours every 
day.

My original idea in writing this letter was 
to say that I was going to Austria, and if you 
ever got around to writing, to be reasonably careful 
about what you said. But (this is Vienna now)
I'm probably a marked woman by this time [now] because I 
left my diary in the station at Innsbruck, and 
now I'm scared to write for it. Among other
little tid-bits I had copied down most of Lenin's Address
to the Youth Leagues in it before I left Paris, because 
I wanted to be able to read it when I felt 
like it. So now I guess any little remark you 
might let slip wouldn't alter my record much.

All this in case you have a remark to slip or
feel like slipping a remark or think that slipping 
a remark might be good sport.  Any way, much love
Bess
