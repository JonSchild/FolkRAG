(Ray) and that was part of the Cherokee removal.
AL:  Delanaga, Georgia.
Ray:  That's right.  And I'm 3/8ths Cherokee, I got it from both
sides.  And them fairy tales (?) I guess is pretty close.  And my
granddaddy was a full Indian -- greatgranddaddy was buried in a
gold mine over there.  Goes into my wife's people, had Indians.
And then also on my mama and ad's side.
AL:  What about the gold rush song?  How does that come in, what's 
the story?
Ray:  Well, I just put it together, about the first gold rush, about
Parks (?) stomping "his toe and kicking" off a gold rush.  And
about Jenkins Hollow andthe mint.
AL:  Well, this was the first time that gold was actually mined in
the eastern America, wasn't it?
RAY:  Well, it was one of the first gold rushes.  over there at the
college, where they display the gold, where the mind stood.
Delanga money is worth more than California gold, today.
AL:  And that was really the end of the Cherokees, because when
the gold was found the Cherokees and the Indians had to go.
Ray:  Yeah, well the Cherokee nation fought the Creek (?) Indians with
Andrew Jackson, then he turned on them.  Thought they'd move 'em
to California,.... to die on poor land.  Yet they moved into (unit)
and they wanted to marry (??) them again
AL:  Well, I want to hear that song now....
