Fire and water both agree,
Winter soldiers never flee.

Children of the heavenly King,
As ye journey sweetly sing;
Sing your Savior's worthy praise,
Glorious in His works and ways.

Ye are traveling home to God,
In the way the father's trod;
They are happy now and ye
Soon their happiness shall see.

O, ye banished seed be glad!
Christ our advocate is made â€”
Us to save, our flesh assumes,
Brother to our soul becomes.

Shout, ye little flock and blest!
You on Jesus' throne shall rest;
There your seat is now prepar'd,
There your kingdom and reward.

Fear not, brethren, joyful stand
On the borders of your land;
Jesus Christ, your Father's Son,
Bids you undismayed go on.

Lord, submissive make us go,
Gladly leaving all below;
Only Thou our leader be,
And we still will follow Thee.

No. 35
Come, my dear friends, and mourn with me, 
In my afflicted state;
I am bereaved, as you may see,
Of my dear loving mate.
