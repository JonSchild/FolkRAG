Rumors or Jokes
I
I heard a fellow say, that this meat
rationing was an offul thing, and
I asked him why, and he said, "
well I went to a resturant and order
a steak, and I had to get up and
shut the door three time, so I called
the waiter and asked to see the
manger. But the waiter said that
there was two orders before him
of beef.

II.
One night I heard Jack Benny 
on the air, and he was calling
up Rostchester on the phone, and 
told him to bring him his shoes
down to the program and Rostchester
asked him if he had any shoes
on, and he answered yes, and
Rostchester asked him why he
wanted his other shoes then,
and he said, "well rationing is
going on, and I have my no
seventeen stamp shoes on now,
and if I want them to last
for four months I have to change
them every hour or so.      [*Folder 121*]
