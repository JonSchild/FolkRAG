COLORADO     AUGUST 29, 1942

was told to me by the man who repaired my radio and works for
a large furniture company in Denver.

A member of the Denver District Attorney's Office asked
me the other day if I had noticed the large piles of rubber tires,
as well as scrap iron located in various junk yards in Denver, and
an especially large mountain of tires out at the Gates Rubber
Company, who are working on large war contracts here. He said that
surely the government and the Gates Rubber Company should know that
sometimes fires were started by spontaneous combustion and he
wondered if precautions had been taken and why the government and
some of these firms in private industry seemed to move so slowly
with reference to the handling of scrap iron, scrap rubber, etc.

A few weeks ago our attention was frequently called to
the fact that quite a few people were of the opinion that the
United States had been jockeyed into this war by the administration
and if we had pursued a different policy toward Japan we would not
find ourselves in our present situation. We wish to call your
attention to the fact that recently this kind of rumor has become
less and less heard in this area. Numerous people, however, and
especially farmers, are quite firmly convinced that junk dealers
are holding out for the highest bidder so far as the sale of their
scrap iron and rubber are concerned.
