The Government is taking over a plant that I know about manufacturing
civilian goods, not because it is necessary for the war but because
competitors have used their influence with the Government to bring this about.
Head of an Employer's Association, St. Paul, 8/13

The Government is not making an all-out effort to win the war.
It is still thinking of social reform and politics.
Member of an Employer's Association, St. Paul, 8/13

The President's Seven Point Inflation Program is good in theory.
However, he is listening too much to pressure groups like the farm bloc
and the labor groups. That is why inflation is not being controlled.
Member of an Employer's Association, St. Paul, 8/13

This curtailment of war industries is for politics reasons so
certain elements in the Government can claim we haven't the material to
open a second front.

England and the United States are doing nothing about helping [*~*]
Russia with a second front. This lack of action is terrible.
Local C.I.O. Labor Leader, Minneapolis, 8/13

Rationing is a half-hearted effort. The Government should take a 
firm stand and ration everything without talking about it and confusing the
public.
Local C.I.O. Labor Leader, Minneapolis, 8/13

Prices are going up. One of the President's program points is
a ceiling on prices. However, Congress is sabotaging that program by refusing
to give Henderson enough money to enforce it.
Machinist, Minneapolis, 8/13
