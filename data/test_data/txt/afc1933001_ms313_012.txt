FEASIBILITY OF PROGRAM
A number of projects by W.P.A., the Resettlement Administration
and P.W.A. have been conducted in this direction with relief
objectives in mind. These projects have established definite
precedents and suggest general procedure as well as probable
cost factors.
     Also with relief objectives in mind there have been "discovered" 
a multitude of educators, painters, sculptors, musicians,
actors and artizans who are ready to work directly with
the people, rather than through their conventional media which
we restricted to the cities. they have now established a 
technique of "peoples' art" which will become lost, if these
artists and teachers are divorced from their public by reason 
of the end of subsidies. In order that they may be preserved
for "normal" occupation, they must be brought to the communities
on a more permanent basis. This program would gradually make 
possible the absorption of talent on a permanent non-relief basis.

PLANNING APROACH
The construction of ten centers as outlined above will proceed
in a "clinical" approach. Perhaps six could be established in
localities where the conditions are regarded as favorable, two 
in localities considered indifferent, and two in localities
found opposed to integrated community life. Thus, the Federal
agency by methodical approach can learn the reactions on concrete
and comparable data and gradually adjust its technique 
without risking adverse public opinion.
     If the results of this technique warrant it, during the 
next fiscal year (1938-39) this program may be enlarged to 100 
community centers, costing approximately ten million dollars.
