Mr. E. B. Stewart, Supt.

Dear Mr. Stewart:
     
     I am sorry that I omitted writing
to you that the order for payment of the
packing charges has been sent in a couple
of weeks ago and that you should receive
a check soon.

     I trust that there will be no 
undue delay.

     Sincerely yours,

     B.A.Botkin, Assistant in Charge
