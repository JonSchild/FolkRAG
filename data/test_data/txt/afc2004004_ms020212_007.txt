Dear John:

It is very important for you to go to Guy Carawan's 
festival if you possibly can. The work he is doing 
there is going to help the whole singing movement. 
I hope to meet you there Saturday, with Peter and 
Emma if possible.   If Henry can't come, don't worry 
about that.   We'll work with him later.

All the best,

Alan Lomax
