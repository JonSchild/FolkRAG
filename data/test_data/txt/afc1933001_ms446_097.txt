My Father owns it all, the earth and heavens too.
I have a crown awaiting.  I'm just as rich as you. 

2 

My Father owns the mountains and all the land and
sea, 
He owns the hills and valleys, the rivers, flowers, and
trees; 
This world is just His footstool, His home beyond the
blue. 
Oh, I'm one of His children, I'm just as rich as you. 

3 

My Jesus stilled the tempest on tossed Galilee, 
He healed the sick and raised the dead and set the
captive free; 
He shed His blood to save you as no one else coud
do, 
Now He's my elder brother, I'm just as rich as you. 

4 

My Father owns the heavens and Jesus now is there, 
Oh, I have loved ones waiting in that country bright
and fair; 
There we will praise our Savior when we bid  this
world adieu. 
With angels as my servants, I'm just as rich as you. 

5 

So come along, my dear brother, and leave this world
behind, 
It will never satisfy  you, no peace you'll ever find; 
Take Jesus as your Savior, He'll sanctify you too, 
Then you can testify and shout, I'm just as rich
as you.
