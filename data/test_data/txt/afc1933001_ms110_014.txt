Dear Bess:

The name of the Guitar Company is Tatay at 116th. and 5th.
Ave., N. Y. C. Tell him you know Dr. Mitchell at New York Uni-
versity.

Instead of going to Cincinatti this week, C. B. S. shifted the
program to Washington and I'm going to do a program of squeeze
dances on W.J.S.V. I've got to start out looking in the morning
for talent. It's going to be a very rushed job. The program goes
on M-W-F- (WABC) and you'll find the boys around CBS from 2:30 on
on any of those days. I'd be sure not to allow myself to become too
much involved with Nick. He's a nice guy but has his problems.
This is very adult advice. Please come to see us soon because I
miss you all the time.

Much love,

Alan
