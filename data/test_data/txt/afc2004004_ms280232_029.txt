6) Now big-hearted Herbert, the working-man's friend,
Was grieved at the thought of the nobleman's end.
For theyknew that the blue blood meant more than the red,
And sent six flash doctors to Sir Oswald's bed.
7) These Harley Street merchants went over in the night,
They pounded his chest and they found it alright.
And in desperation at last they agreed
That he'd got phlebitis, a dreadful disease.
8) Now Oswald's a free man and he's doing fine,
In a small twelve-room cottage he's biding his time.
And I'm in a shell-hole being hurt in the fight,
Defending the rights of this flea-bitten knight.

It ain't gonna rain no more, (2)
For the workers tell, and theyknow damn well,
It ain't gonna rain no more.
1) First there's Ramsey McDonald,
The Revolution, he would risk it;
But when the bosses come along he took their bloody biscuit.
2) And then there's Walter Newbold, a Revolutionary he may be,
But when he saw there was no Moscow goal he went and joined the I.L.P.

Just one more chance,
To prove that we will not desert you,
The Labour Party does deserve to get one more chance.
Just one more chance,
To serve the interests of the nation,
With tariff wage cuts or inflation,
A fat, well-paid job, just one more chance.
We served you with anomalies and means test,
We cut your dole, no one denies,
But after all, for workers, margarine's best,
We must economize - gor blimey. (repeat one.)

SKYE LAMENT:
Like watercress gathered fresh from cool streams,
My love, dear one, by the banks of Jura, cold, cold, the banks,
Cold, my love, was they.
Like watercress gathered fresh from cool streams,
Cold the dawn, the morn that windeth
Dreams the night, deep drowned in dew mist,
And my heart dreamt of its own son,
Deep lies drowned in death, cold and grey,
Like watercress gathered fresh from cool streams. - - - -
