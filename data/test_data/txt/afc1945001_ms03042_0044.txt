RUMORS COLLECTED FROM AUGUST 3 TO 8, 1942

(Note: Because rumors fall into certain categories, we have given
them in groups under rough headings.)

Great Britain

New York City 8-5 (Farmer from Upstate): Maybe the British can take it
in London, but they've pretty near stopped fighting now everywhere. They're
waiting for us to do it."

Troy 8-4: "Churchill doesn't care how long the war lasts if the big
shots can hold on to their profits and their businesses."

Buffalo 8-8 (Irish-American): "The British got us into this war. They
want us to open a second front. Do you think for one minute that an Englishman
will fight if an American can be made to go in his place?"

Cambridge 8-5: "The English still hate us Americans. They are scheming
so that all the fighting now will be done by American soldiers."

Mount Vernon 8-5 (Methodist minister): "The war will last five years, 
principally because the British haven't the sense to open a second front now."

Troy 8-4: "The British are lying down on the job. They are holding up 
a second front."

Buffalo 8-4 (Irish-American): "The English have always hated us. They
still do. Why in hell should we fight their war?"

New York City 8-8: "It serves the British right, this Indian revolt. I
think the Indians will win, too, and then fight the Japs."

Brooklyn 8-5: "Gandhi is pro-Axis. Besides he is sure that this is a good
time to force the British into a hole. Churchill has muffed the whole thing."

New York City 8-6: "Lloyd's of London is betting 2 to 1 that peace will
be signed in 1942."
