TAPE:  #234 Sacred Harp  3

you feel like shouting or something. I've always loved it. . . . .
I take them with me, they're only 3 and 2. . . . . . . . . .
I'm trying to pass it on to my children and hopefully they will
continue singing. We always sing little songs, just things that
they can learn with. So far they can sing two or three songs.
AL:  When do you sing to them?
Clerk:  Well, when, mostly we sing at home and when we're riding,
going to the babysitter, we always sing and they do real well for
so young so I hope they continue to do well. They sing Amazing
Grace, they can sing the words to that and they can sing Go Preachers
and Jesus is My Friend. . . . . .(he sings a bit)  She starts again
from the top of the interview:
Clerk:  Working in a bank, I always work with numbers, and so
sometimes I relate the numbers to the numbers in the song book.
That way I can pick out some songs and hum along for a while. I
usually try to tell people about Sacred Harp who don't know any
thing about it or where it comes from, so I do a little bit of that.
I been singing for a long time. I've had Uncle Bud McGraw and
Hugh McGraw, they've both been my teachers, and Mr. REdding.
I've been singing, gosh I don't know how long, but my mother
used to take me when I was a small child. Of course, I didnt
sit in the house then like I do now but now I could sit in the
house all day and all night and just listen to it. And I have
two little girls and I hope that they will. . . . I'm trying to take
them with me whenever I go, and they seem to like it, they sing along
