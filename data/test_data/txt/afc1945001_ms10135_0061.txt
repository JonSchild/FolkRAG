1. A soldier came home on his furlough
from a camp way down south. As usual
Negroes have to sit in the back of the
buses or have a special coach on the
train to sit. The negro got on the bus at
a small town and there wasn't any seats
in the back for him to sit in, but there was
one middle ways the bus so he sat
down. Before long a white soldier got on the
same bus, seeing no other seat he sat beside
the negro which was very unusual. The seat
begin to get crowded yet these were only the
two sitting in it.  The negro said to the white
soldier, "I would have sat in the back but
no seat. Did you buy a ticket for a
double ass? Well, it looks like a single
one [sa] slide to your right. Theres no discriminations.
