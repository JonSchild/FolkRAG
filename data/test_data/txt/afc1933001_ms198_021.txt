Dear Rae:
   The record company is willing to pay the $150 fee for
dubbing.  Therefore, I would appreciate it if you would go 
ahead and dub the Hobart Smith and Texas Gladden material 
in your collection.
  The fee will be paid as soon as you wish it.  I wonder,
however if there is a chance of paying the fee after listening
to the material.  Also, must one decide in advance which tapes 
will be included in an album? - or any, if it comes to that.
   Sorry to have caused you any inconvenience -
                                              Yours cordially,
                                               Alan Lomax
