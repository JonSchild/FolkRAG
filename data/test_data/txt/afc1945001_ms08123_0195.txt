The Red Army
During my history class I read an article in the weekly news review formally printed in Washington D.C. that read 
Quote Pres Stallin of Russia is disatified with United States and British cooperation That they lack the meaning of cooperation. Pres Stallin gave several points from his angle.
A. The British and Americans did not open the second front in Europe.
B. Stallin said, "The Red Army is carring the whole weight of the war alone." This Message on the 25th anniversary brought on bad feeling between the two Nations Unquote.
