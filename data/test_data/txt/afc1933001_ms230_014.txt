In case you are willing to make
this trip let me write to Messrs.
MacLeish and Spivake and solicit 
your presence at the most
southwardly gathering of folk 
lorists that come together
in America. I'll have Dobie 
write also to Mr McLeish.

Please think this proposition
over and let me have your
reaction. The Folk Lore Society
hasn't any money for speakers,
though I've no doubt about
other paying engagements.

Affectionately,
Father
