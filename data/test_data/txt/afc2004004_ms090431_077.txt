Fisk, 14. 13. WILL STARK
I'm gonna keep the skillet greasy if I can.

Chew my tobaccy,
Spit my juice,
There's a nail, buddy,
But it ain't no use.
So I keep my skillet greasy if I can.
If I can, I don't care when,
I'm gonna keep my skillet greasy if I can.

That's the on y reason you ever seen,
But I do love my ton of grease.
Cause I keep my pot a-bilin all the time.
If I can, I don't care when,
I'm gonna keep my skillet greasy if I can.

A: Oh, that's fine. You know more than anybody I ever heard.
S: Boy, I know more of that if I can just think of it. When I sing
it d n't come to me fast enugh to remember the words.
A: Will, sing me as much as you can rem[b]ember, even if it's just a
snatch, of Old Blue. 

OLD BLUE.
I never learned it. I don't know enough of it to sing it. All I know
is it started something like this:
Farewell, Blue-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-
That's the way it goes.

SALLY GOO[I]DIN

I give both away 
To see Sally Goodin.
Hey.

I had a piece of pie,
I had a piece of p ddin;
I give both away
To see Sally Goodin.
Hey.

And a diddle daddle diddle.
