Dear Mr. _________:
Subject: Formation of a Local Rumor Clinic
Thank you for your letter advising us that you and 
your associates are about to initiate a program for the local
analysis of rumors.
This is an important community undertaking and in
war time one which requires a proper understanding of the nature
of rumors, their cause, and their cure. The Office of War
Information, in its desire to guide local analysis of oral 
communication, has formulated a guide for such analysis which
it is prepared to send to qualified local organizations engaged
in this work.
Before sending a guide, the Office of War
Information must, however, be apprised of the sponsorship,
supervision, and responsibility of local rumor clinics and,
towards this end, has prepared a questionnaire for you to fill
out (copy attached).
On receipt of the filled-in questionnaire, we will
forward an adequate supply of copies for your rumor clinic,
with which to acquaint all of the people engaged in the effort
with the results of the Government's findings in this field
since Pearl Harbor.
Sincerely yours,

Transcribed and reviewed by contributors participating in the By The People project at crowd.loc.gov.
