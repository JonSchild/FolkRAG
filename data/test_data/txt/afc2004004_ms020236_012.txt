say he got                   .   That why he got 
tractors.   He hires the work [done by the] now with tractors.   The last 
time I was there, he was payin' those tractor men twelve dollars 
a day.   You know, tractor men. . . .An' money all over that place. 
You know, old money. He got money, jus' stacks; stacks of dollars like
that.   Stack up the old dollars; stack up the old quarters there. 
Ov' there an' I go to dust an' can't be                 Be jus' 
[Just] piled in there. 
All that gold.   Um, I say, "Ya keep it there where ya 
can't do me anything at all an' probably       send [( ] it - you)]
to Heaven.          O-oh, my!   Yessuh.
All kind a funny-lookin' money.  All in a room.   Ol' paper money,
ol' silver, ol' half this an' half that.   He got thousands of
dollars worth of money right in that house -- in that room.
He keep it stacked right in the winda, on the dresser thing.   All
kinds a -- he got this Liberty thing, y'know -- statue of Liberty?
In gold.   Tha's a pretty thing. I'm tellin' you. 
TL:         You won't marry him, though, because you can't work with him?
BJ:          No, I don't need to work with him.   But what I mean, I don'
wanna marry him because he got all this an' I don' have anything. 
Nothin' whatever but ever me bare.   I din't even have a bank account.
You see?   An' I never would hear the word said, "I got you with
nothin'."   He puttin' his gold on my -- (tooth)
TL:         Oh, did he?
BJ:          Sure did.   But I just' say, I ah, I jus' went away. 
I even quit writin'. . .I quit writin' him.   Got to where I wasn't 
there.   I haven't went to the post office and let the letter
go back. . .Jus' keep it that way. . .That was the opportunity, [--] chile,
that was the big break.   A reg'lar break for me.
             An then, there was another reason, again, he had come 
into Johnson's church -- you know, Johnson, the Holiness Church?
An' I mean, I wasn't goin' in there.   You see?   You see why.

TL:         When Alan first started talking to you about these tapes 
and stuff, I heard one half of a tape about Cassius Davis.   About 
when he used to go out with you?   The one -- when you first got
your baby.   I heard that tape.   That's the only thing I heard 
that's been done before I started.   But that was just beautiful 
about how you told it and how. . .
