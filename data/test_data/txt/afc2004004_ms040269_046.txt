REIVIN SANG

The Dean was in his braw nichtgoun,
a cauldrif morn his dowp aroon
whan herried was the Stane of Scone
that gied him Geordie-Lowrie.

Noo Geordie-Lowrie's no for me,
nae glegness in ma Deanery,
I've tint the Stane o Destinie:
it gies me Geordie-Lowrie.

Oor kin may sing in verse an tune
the rare guid lass an reivin loon
wha garred the Dean's hert gowp an stoon
an gied him Geordie-Lowrie.

Auld Scotlan's hert is heech aboon,
sair pitten-oot is England's Croun--
as muckle as thon chiel de Bohum
whan he gat Geordie-Lowrie.


Here's health, ma fieres, an soop it doon,
tae The Reivers o the Stane o Scone,
an damn the nyaffs that girn an froun
an gie thaem Geordie-Lowrie.

Noo Geordie-Lowrie's no for me,
nae glegness in ma Deanery,
I've tint the Stane o Destinie:
it gies me Geordie-Lowrie.

(Tune:  "The Muckin o Geordie's Byre")

THE WEE MAGIC STANE

The Daen of Westminster wis a powerful man
He held all the strings o the state in his hand
But with all this great business it flustered him nane,
Till some rogues ran away we his wee magic stane.
With a too-ra-li-oor-ra-li-oor-a-li-ay.
