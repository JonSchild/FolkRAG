"A 
Minnesota manufacturer of cardboard received a number of orders for cartons
and, after completing same, he endeavored to find out where to ship them. He
continued to receive orders and continued to fill until the plant was
bogged down with unshipped cartons. An Army officer with the rank of Major 
drove up to his plant and told him to keep producing. When the manufacturer
asked where to ship this tremendous supply already completed, the Major
advised that that wasn't his job as he was only in charge of getting the
material produced. After having filled with completed cartons all his supply
rooms and lot adjacent to his plant, he is still unable to find out who
wants them" -- a story that has been circulated in Highland Park;
