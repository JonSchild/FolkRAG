A - this time Sonny Terryvand Brownie McGhee were living
in N.Y. Brownie had a guitar school in H--rlem and Gary worked 
as a teacher there (the dates of Gary's working there and
the dates in which the school existed are presently unknown
to me) THere woudl also be jams on the lower east side with
Sonny and Brownie, C[?]sco Houston, Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly.
Gary performed at the concert in Carnegie Hall which was a tr
tribute to Leadbelly, which was the beginning of his recognition
by the folk world. After that he and Brownie and 
sonny did a series of midnight concerts for Art D.Lugoff which 
added to Gary's recognition. And slowly a trickle of students 
and musicians found there way to Gary's house in theEast Bronx.
THeir first house was torn down for urban redevelopment, and 
Gary andANnie moved around the corner to East 169 St.
