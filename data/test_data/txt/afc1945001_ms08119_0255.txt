A  Robert Lembs
Rhyme
Who rose up when the bugle blew
Who for their homeland life and hope
Stood aguard on the Battaan slope
Keeping us from the slant -eyed crew
Mac Arthur's men
Who in the grime and dirt and muck
Lay in the shell-holes slipped in sand
Did in the battle gun in hand
Fought like heroes and  and termed it luck?
Ma Arthurs Men
Who from the fox holes rose at night
Who with [knift] knives at each [rifll] rifle tip
