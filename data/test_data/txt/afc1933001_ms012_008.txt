Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Engel:

I have just sent you and Mr. Putnam the
following wire:

"Mr. Stevens made offer without the application
from me; thereupon I informed him of Carnegie's
application, he making no comment. His letter today
says that he would see Mr. Leland Friday. Please
communicate with these gentlemen and wire whether
my presence in Washington would be helpful. Matter

Mr. Stevens and applied to him for aid from The
Rockefeller Foundation, in addition to my application
to The Carnegie Corporation. As I recall, I

made the proffer of supporting me for from three to
five years on the project, not only in the matter of
expenses but in providing maintenance of my family.
He asked me in particular about my dependents and
other obligations incumbent upon me, saying that he
wanted me to be without financial worry during the
progress of this work. I then told him about my
application to The Carnegie Corporation, how it had
come about and also that you and Mr. Leland were [further]
informed concerning it. To this Mr. Stevens made no
response.

Under date of January 2nd, Mr. Stevens writes
me: "I have read your note of December 31st [*/*] with
interest, and am glad to say that you undoubtedly will
have a favorable report within the next week on our
