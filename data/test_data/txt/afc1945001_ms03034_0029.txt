Mr. Archibald MacLeish
Director of the Office of Facts and Figures 
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. MacLeish:

            Enclosed you will find a memorandum on the subject
of the rumors concerning the Jews and the draft. I regard this 
particular rumor as very dangerous. It has been in circulation 
for some months here, and all local efforts to discourage it have 
proven fruitless. I therefore take the extreme measure of writing 
you. Specifically, I feel that it would be a very great service 
to the cause of local if not national unity if you would place 
these facts in the hands of General Hershey. If he could issue a  
formal statement discrediting these stories, or better yet, issue 
actual figures, then we and others would have some ammunition.
As it stands, we are powerless to discredit this attack on the 
Jews, except by citing a few isolated figures from local draft 
boards or the record of the Jews in the last war.

            I do hope that you will be able to do something about 
this matter. I might add that I am writing under the specific 
instructions of my advisory board and Prof. Allport.


                                                          Yours very truly,

                                                         Robert H. Knapp, Chairman 
                                                         Division of Propaganda Research
