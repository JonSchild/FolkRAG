Knockin' down my windows an' you

flo'.
Late las' night I was makin my rouns
I walked upon tha' bully an' I blowed him
I goes [went] on home and I goes down to bed
I put my pistol up under my head.
I lay in the down thinking of the deeds I had 
done,
Till I grabbed my pistol & away I 
did run
I make a good run a but I 
[made it] run too slow.
Untill the coppers overtook me ina Jericho
Well he took me to town  & he dressed 
me in black
Put me on the train an he brought 
me back
couldn' find nobody for to go my bail
Well he boun' me over in the county jail
