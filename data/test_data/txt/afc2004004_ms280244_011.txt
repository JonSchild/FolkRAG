But I [baen may] may go on ma'n home ere [?] nun all do that 
[A]fore I entered your door
Oh your ni[?]ps I wilna pluck nor noght I wilna muck 
Nae do any other jobs for bye, 
And if the guide wife, she comes along wi' me, 
We'll very soon milk [you a cad] yours bye, well very soon milk [you a cai.] your bye.

4) Now the laddie arrived with his pouches foo' 
[A]nd a [C]hocki on his [?]back 
When he spied the fairmer wi an awfu ugly dame
It's her meek we-al (?) cradle

8) "That will be the guide wife,"the laddie thought, 
" I'm glad she's nearly doon, 
For I dinna want to start the milking yet, Afore I see the 
toon, 
Afore I see the toon [????]

5) Now the farmer said "your supper is and not your supper laid
And here's the guide wife, who'll come along with you 
And help you with your dairy maid. 
"Oh your nips I wilna pluck nor your nought I wilna muck
Nor do any other jobs for bye, 
Its a wonder that a woman with a face like that, 
She [D]oesna put your coos a' dry 
So a noo I'll bid you baith good bye." 
(That sounds like a theatre song a bit Jimmy. Is it sung in 
the theatres at all?)
