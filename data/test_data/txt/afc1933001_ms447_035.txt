Our Singing Country

5 When Zacharias Taylor gained the day,
Heave away, Santy Anno;
He made poor Santy run away,
All on the plains of Mexico.

6 General Scott and Taylor, too,
Heave away, Santy Anno;
Made poor Santy meet his Waterloo,
All on the plains of Mexico.

7. When I leave the ship, I will settle down,
Heave away, Santy Anno,
And marry a girl named Sally Brown,
All on the plains of Mexico.

8. Santy Anno was a good old man,
Heave away, Santy Anno;
Till he got into war with your Uncle Sam,
All on the plains of Mexico.

HAUL AWAY, MY ROSY

Va., 1935. See Col, p. 41; Wha, p. 85.

"This song was a song we used in hoisting the sails. The chorus comes
on the last word of the verse to give the pull. It's usually one pull, but,
supposing the mate or the second mate who's officer of the watch turns out
wrong side to, he may think the work is going too slow, he'll let a yell out
of him, 'Double up! Double up on that song! I ain't got all night to wait!"
Then it means that you take a pull on the first part of the shanty and the
second part also."      -- CAPTAIN DICK MAITLAND.
