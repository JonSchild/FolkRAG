I am delighted that there is a 
possibility of doing some recording -
 I hadn't understood however that I 
was to be paid - I may not be any
good, so suppose we wait a see what
we find - Then you decide on that. 

I'm not working now, so time is 
about all I have, and I'd adore 
seeing what we could get. I very
much hope Elizabeth comes with the 
machine for she knows so much more 
about it all than I, then it will
be such fun working with her.

Any time after about two weeks 
will suit me. I'm taking time out to
run a temperature of around 100 and 
my physician says it runs a course
regardless, of about 4 weeks - I've had 
it 2 & feel like an old orange squeezed dry.
It isn't "catching", so  don't be alarmed, its 
a kidney infection - 

So much love for you both. We 
did enjoy you but felt so apologetic about 
every thing - that goes for this scrawl too -
