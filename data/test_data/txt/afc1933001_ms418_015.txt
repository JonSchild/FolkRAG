METHODIST PIE

I was down to camp meetin'
The other afternoon,
To hear them shout and sing,
For to tell each other
How they loved one another,
And to make hallelujah ring.

There's old uncle Daniel,
And brother Ebenezer,
Uncle Rufus with his lame gal, Sue,
And old Mother Bender,
Well, I never seen a happier crew.

Well, they all go there
For to have a good time
And to eat that grub so sly,
Have applesauce butter
With sugar in the gourd
And a great big Methodist Pie.

Well, you ought to hear the ringing
When they all get to singing
That good old bye and bye.
See Jimmy McGee in the top of a tree
Saying, how is this for high?

Then they cotch a hold of hands
And march around the ring
Kept a singing all the while
You'd think it was a cyclone
Coming thru the air,
You could hear them shout for half a mile.

Then the bell rings loud and the great big crowd
Breaks ranks and up they fly
While I took board
On the sugar in the gourd
And I cleaned up the Methodist Pie.

CHORUS

Oh, little children, I believe,
Oh, little children, I believe,
Oh, little children, I believe,
I'm Methodist till I die.
I'm Methodist, Methodist,
'Tis my belief,
I'm Methodist till I die.
When old grim death comes knocking at the door,
I'm Methodist till I die.
