Inter-Office Memorandum
Office of War Information
Public Inquiries Bureau
Date: August 8, 1942

To: Miss Katherine C. Blackburn
       Chief, Public Inquiries Bureau
From: Richard C. WIlson
           Field Representative - Wisconsin
Subject: Bureau of Intelligence Report No. 6: Rumors

This report is based upon rumors which we have had told to us, rumors that 
we have overheard but told to other people, and rumors brought to our attention
by people whom we had on the look-out for them.

The people of Milwaukee are talking about the war, production of materials,
labor, wastes and inefficiencies in government and other problems and situations
that they have heard about.  There don't seem to be very many vicious
rumors rampant in this city.  Most of the rumors we have picked up are of the
"see how much I know" variety.  The purpose of these rumors is to impress upon
other people the vast fund of information that individuals have.

We have grouped these rumors more or less on a subject basis to give you a
rather complete picture of comments we have heard on several different topics.

I. Rumors
Labor
We were working as carpenters at the Madison airport, but they laid us off
when we caught up (to the crew ahead), but instead of hiring us back when
they were ready to go again, they got a whole new crew -- just so the 
union could get its 15 bucks out of each of the new workers.  Yeah, the
union does all the hiring, and have they a sweet racket!!
