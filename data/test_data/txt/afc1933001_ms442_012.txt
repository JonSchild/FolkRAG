Got a Gal In Town Wid Her Mouf' Chuck Full of Gold

Notes taken during renditions of the song:

If [f] you get one woman, better get you two or three,
Get one for yourself, podner, and two for me.

One of these mornin's sun refuse to shine,
An' I'm goin' back, Lawd, to that gal of mine.

If [I] that's your woman, better pin her to your side,
If I got a dollar, I know she gonna let me by.

If that's you man, better pin him to your side,
If I got a dollar, you sho gonna let me by.

If that's your woman, you better buy you a lock an' key,
Get a lock an' key to keep her 'way from me.
