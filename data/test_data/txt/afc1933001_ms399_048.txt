When I was a Cowboy

"Sing one for me." I requested.

Then he tuned his guitar and gave me something new in cowboy
music. Before then he had probably heard the ballad of the "Old 
Chisholm Trail" and the "Jesse James" song, both popular among Texas 
cowboys. He used the refrain of the "Old Chisholm Trail" and put "Jesse 
James" through some amazing stunts.

For example, in the verses that follow, Jesse has a hard fight 
on Bunker Hill with a bunch of fast-shooting cowboys. No other historian 
ever took the Missouri outlaw to Boston.

I doubt if Lead-belly had ever ridden horseback after a cow, 
except perhaps in teh pine thickets of Louisiana. But that hot August 
day, dressed in convict stripes, while his nomble fingers plucked the 
strings of his twelve-string guitar, he did create again a feeling for 
the Big West, its wide plains and rough life.

As he patted single time with his left foot and double time with 
his right foot, these are the words that Lead-belly sang:

When I was a cowboy, way out on de Western plains,
When I was a cowboy, way out on de Western plains,
I made a million dollars pullin' on de bridle reins.
Coma cow cow yicky, coma cow cow yicky, yicky yea.

I went to my girl's house, she was sittin' there alone,
I went to my girl's house, she was sittin' there alone,
I'm a pore lonesome cowboy, an' a long ways from home,
Coma cow cow yicky, coma cow cow yicky, yicky yea.

When I left my girl's house, she was sittin' in a 
rocking cheer,
When I left my girl's house, she was sittin' in a 
rocking cheer,
Oh, wild Western cowboy, oh please don't leave me here!"
Coma cow cow yicky, coma cow cow yicky, yicky yea.
