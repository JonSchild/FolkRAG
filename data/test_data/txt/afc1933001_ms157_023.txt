Dear Professor Boggs:

Thank you for your kind note.  I understand 
fully the reasons for your declining our 
offer of a recording machine.  I did not know 
that you were to take in all of South America.  
A bulky machine would certainly be a nuisance 
on such a trip.

If you find any records there which you 
think we might obtain by purchase or exchange, 
please let me know.  So far we know only of 
those in Sao Paulo.

It might be wise for you to write me from 
South America outlining a proposed recording 
trip in a specified area.  I should then be 
glad to refer this to the proper parties.

With best wishes for a pleasant trip,

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
