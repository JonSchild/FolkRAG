RED IRON ORE
Come all you bold sailors that follow the lakes
On an iron ore vessel, your living to make;
I shipped in Chicago, bid adieu to the shore,
Bound away to Escanaba for red iron ore
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.

In the month of September, the seventeenth day,
Two dollars and a quarter is all they would pay,
And on Monday morning from Bridgeport did take
The E.  C. Roberts out in the lake
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.

The wind from the southward sprang up a fresh breeze.
And away through Lake Michigan the Roberts did sneeze;
Down through Lake Michigan the Roberts did roar,
And on Friday morning we passed through Death's Door.
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.

This packet she howled across the mouth of Green Bay,
and before her cut water she dashed the white spray;
We rounded the sand point, our anchor let go,
We furled in our canvas and the watch went below.
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down,

Next morning we hove alongside the "Exile,"
And soon was made fast to an iron ore pile;
They lowered their chutes and like thunder did roar,
they spouted into us that red iron ore.
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.

Some sailors took shovels, while others got spades,
And some took wheelbarrows, each man to his trade;
We looked like red devils,  our fingers got sore,
We cursed Escanaba and damned iron ore.
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.

The tug Escanaba she towed out the "Minch,"
The Roberts, she thought, she had been left in a pinch,
And as they passed by us they bid us goodbye,
Saying, "We'll meet you in Cleveland next Fourth of July."
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.

Through Louse Island passage it blew a fresh [gale] breeze,
We made the Foxes, the Beavers and Skillageles;
We flew by the Minch for to show her the way,
And she never hove in sight till we were off Thunder Bay.
Derry  Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.

Across Saginaw Bay the Roberts did ride,
With the dark and deep water rolling over her side,
And now for Port Huron the Roberts must go,
Where the tug Kate Williams she took us in tow.
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.
