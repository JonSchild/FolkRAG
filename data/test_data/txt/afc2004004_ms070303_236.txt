Recording session at Sorley McLean's
     House
   John Burgess, young blonde piper
green coat, green plaid brown shoes
grey stocking & loving
   The theme drones behind his
agt & ear – staring away across
the green park gold in the evening
The women, both pregnant [mother?],
the Scots poet listening quietly,
wrapt, watching respectfully
like a man watching a great
athelete
   The boy  1) has perfect Nordic
face & eyes. Shy, humorous,
self contained His fingers red
& veined as the chanter. He is
in a hurry to get home to
break a horse for some laird
or other –
