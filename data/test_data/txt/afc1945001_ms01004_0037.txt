Dear Gene:

I received your note dated July 28th, but I am sorry I cannot agree 
with you about your major premise.  You say, "definitions are not 
really necessary for instruction since everybody seems to know what a 
rumor is."  The fallacy here is that if everybody knows what a rumor is, 
why can't anybody define it to the satisfaction of anybody else?  Since 
I intend to use more than one interviewer in my study, any slight disagreement 
on definition among my interviewers could very well be tragic.

Basically, from an administrative point of view, a rumor can be defined 
as any unauthenticated story.  However, for the purpose of instructing 
interviewers, certainly a definition of "unauthenticated" is required.  
Since any given interviewer does not have access to sources for establishing 
authenticity, the only way I can see to do this is to tell the interviewer 
that a rumor is any story that he himself has not heard or seen 
in full authenticated form.

Thus, the interviewers will gather many stories which can later be 
authenticated and discarded by the Sources Division or the Media Division; 
but they will not miss any stories merely because they themselves believe 
those stories to be true.

The definition which I am sending to each interviewer is as follows:
". . . any story related to the war, its effects, or the 
persons concerned with it, which you yourself have not seen 
published or heard broadcast in its entirety, or for which you 
have no other proof of truth."

I think this definition will work, at least for my people, and I am 
passing it along to you for what it is worth.

Yours very truly,
Ira
