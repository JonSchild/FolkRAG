rumors should never be printed by themselves -- even in  order to be denied --
because this tends to keep a group in the focus of attention and encourages
controversy and suspicion. The enemy wants us to debate and suspect the
activities of other groups.

The technique recommended by the Office of War Information is as
follows:  print hate-rumors about any group only as part of a long list of 
similar rumors about other groups. For example:

Current Rumors
"The British are getting rich on the war."
"Big Business is getting rich on the war."
"Labor is getting rich on the war."
"Farmers are getting rich on the war."
"Catholics are getting rich on the war."
"Jews are getting rich on the war."
"Baptists are getting rich on the war."
"Stalin is getting rich on the war."
etc.

Such a barrage demonstrates, by its very inclusiveness, that this 
is a common kind of rumor, indiscriminately applied; that the particular
rumor is just another version of another rumor; and that all rumors of this 
character are to be mistrusted. Listing hate-rumors about different groups
en masse helps to expose the basic strategy and fallacy of hate-rumors.

Projects can perform a significant service by making people aware 
that in spreading hate-rumors they are playing into the hands of the enemy's 
strategy of "Divide and Conquer": those people who repeat rumors about any 
racial, religious, or social groups in this country are-- whether they mean
it or not, whether they know it or not -- playing into the enemy's hands.

Hate-rumors present a continuing danger to democracy's war-effort.
One necessary answer to hate-rumors lies in widespread community campaigns 
designed to attack the sources of hate, to expose the prejudices which lead 
to hate-rumors, and to blanket hate-rumors with energetic information programs.
