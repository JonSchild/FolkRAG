Dear Mr. Burns:

The project you mention in your letter
of August 24th, sounds interesting. There
are, however, several uncertainties in the
way and among them the possibility of my
early enlistment. Will you drop me a card
with a question mark sometime about three
weeks from now and I shall let you know one
way or another. 

Thanks for your kind letter.

Sincerely yours,
