TL:          On the tree?
BJ:           Yessuh.   I got it home now.
TL:           Was he hangin'?
BJ:           Uh-huh, hangin' on the tree!  An' I went went one day an' 
sent the dirty thing to a place to have it, you know, enveloped, 
you know, enlarged, so I could see it clear and good.  An' them 
peoples [sit right] brought it back there an' tol' me, the man did, said "Honey, 
if I was to have this enlarged," he said, "They'd prosecute me."  
He said, "This is a scandal in the United States."   An' he wouldn' 
enlarge it.   That thing hurt me so bad; I wanted to have it enlarged.  
I still got it.
              So, ah, they took the picture; it was on a postal card; 
like you seen a postal card picture, tha's what it is, then.  
An' so they sent it to Mama, an' tha's why -- an' that was it.  
An he              he was all right. . .you 
know... jus' all right.
              An' he [acted] had come as close to Mama's house I guess, as [that] from here 
to that road, you know, where we get on at that corner up there.  (about 150') 
Almost that close.   An' didn' know he was to her house.   'Cause 
he know she's down there in               somewhere.   He [come as] stopped 
[close] at                house, Mr. Johnson, an' he got sumpin' 
to eat.   He was tryin' to get into -- [behind] an' they was behin' 
him with dawgs.   But the first stop    it was. . . .
TL:          That was Son?   Was tryin' to get home?   Or was that your Uncle?
BJ:           Tha's right.  That was Son, himself.   You see, Son was the 
one that was hung -- that was lynched.
TL:          Well, who was with him?  Anybody?
BJ:           Nobody.  He'd left Cuspeth, y'see, an' was tryin' to make 
it to Benevista, ya see.   An' sumpin' in his mind. . .jus' like that -- 
I guess he had to die that way -- but right then turned to go back 
to Benevista to get his clothes.   An' what for?   He was that close
to Mama's house.   But he didn' know Mama stayed there, 'course.   When 
Mister Johnson tol' Mama about this man comin' there an' wantin' 
sumpin' to eat, tol' her his size, Mama said, "That was Son!"  
Said, "I know it was him!"  Was that close to us, an' didn' know it.  An' he come right on to 
Benevista  an'           tha's here.  
If he'da went on to Benevista with the clothes 
he had on he'd a been better.  But he turned. . .
