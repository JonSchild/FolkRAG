corner. I will never forget, after i beat some guys playing
pool, [-] if it wasn't for one of my piano playing friends, 
you'd never hear this record because the guy was going to 
knife me right in my back, I can tell you. He had the knife 
right on me. He said I only used the piano for a decoy, 
which he was right. And, of course, he had it in his mind 
that I was kind of nice-looking. Imagine that, huh! Well, I'll swear. Of

some awful rubber-looking lips, I'm telling you, yes, indeed. 
He was kind of jealous of me, I suppose he was, anyhow, But I said:

                                         There wasn't no one in town,
                                         Wouldn't go my bail.

                                         They had a sweet, sweet gal, They had a sweet, 
                                         sweet gal,
                                         She got stuck on me
                                         And took me for her pal.
