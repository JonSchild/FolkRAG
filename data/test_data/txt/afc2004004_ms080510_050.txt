they had to walk 20 miles to the County court house and they would save up their money for the $1 marriage licence. there were no doctors, there were no decines, they healed themselves with their won herbs and there were many people who heard about the plight of the mountaineers and started educational institutions to help them. There were no schools there and there were missions to help the mountaineers ands omea mount of good was done there but in the meantime the folks were very realistic about what was happening to them and they made very may songs and told many stories that reflected the hard times that were continually pressing in on them.

The story of this ballad was made by Frank Proffit after a terrifying mountain flood that simply washed away all the crops and killed all the animals and ruined the farm.

There were some of those floods that were so awful that the area wouldn't recover from them for maybe 15 years. There was no relieve in those days they just had to tough it out. That is what this song 'This Poor Man' is about. It still means a lot to Frank.

I was raised in Texas on a song that really came out of the mountains that became a cowboy song. "Rye whiskey I cry. If you don't give e rye whiskey I surely will die"
