Sophomore      Negro     Female
   A Colored corporal, drove a
couple of colored sargents to
camp. They congradulated him
because he drove thirty miles
an hour. Well said the corporal
you must remember I'm in
this jeep too.
 It was pay day in a
certain camp and not a crap
game was to be found
Some soldiers were bringing
some Jap prisoners from
One country to another It
was very dulling to the Japs
because they could not talk.
The truck in which they were
riding gave a certain jerk and
all fell foward Each Jap in
the front line was killed One
remarked after shaking his head
I've heard of murder but this is sabotage
