Reverend Roe.  Reel 8.  P. 4
[*Dancing is sinful because it tempts a man.*]
if a man don't kinda lock up with a woman, he don't enjoy his dancing 
much, and over there in the Corinthians, 1st Corin. 7th [(     ?)] chapter, [end of] 
the first verse says it's good for a man not to touch a woman, and you 
know what that do.  Yeah, when you get to fooling around with a woman, 
why that [makes you] nature begin to rise, and it's not only in you but it's 
in her, too, and something wrong would take place.  So dancing is 
not the best thing.  Oh, if the men get out there and want to dance with one another, 
why that and the women with one another might be (laughter), but you mix [the] those sex up together, it's not good.
A: A person wouldn't be turned out of your church if they went to a 
dance now, would they, not today?
R: Well, we call them and question them about it.  If they went to a 
[*Sinful pleasures*]
dance and we knew it, they would have to come acknowledge, beg pardon.
A: And what other things would you call them [and] in question about, Rev-
erend?
R: Drinking.  Visiting beer taverns, and things like that, you know.  
We think it's wrong for our members to indulge in sinful pleasures.  
And yet we would advise them, you know, to go to anything that was up-
lifting, you know, helpful.
A: Movies?
R: Well, some movies is all night, and some is bad.
A: That's up to the judgement of the individual, though, more.
R: Yes sir.  And there's some movies, why, I advise my folks not to 
go to, and they generally hear me pretty well.
A: For instance, like what movies, Reverend?
R: Oh well, such as Desperados, you know, where they shooting and 
fighting and--you see, that stuff gets in your boy and in the girl 
too, now, and they come out, they want to try some of those things.  
Robbing, you know, things like that.  That's not good.  In fact chil-
dren should never go to a thing like that.  And [us] they's lot of old folks ought to
[stay away from it]
