Fisk, 21.4. 
COLLECTION-MRS. LOMAX
Mrs. Lomax from Washington, D.C. donated the sum of $2. I think we ought to give that a hand (applause). --From Washington, D.C.-- $2. That's fine. Let's make a big record now. Sister Viola Cran, 25c. (So when you hear yourself on the record, you can come out) That's right, we want to call their names. Miss Adeline Johnson, 25c. Sister Caroline Anderson, 25c, Sister Caroline Joiner, 25c, Sister Anna Anderson, 25c. Sister Ada Brown, 25c. That's sure sweet. Brother Tom Jones, 25c. Brother E.C. Anderson, 25c. That's nice.
