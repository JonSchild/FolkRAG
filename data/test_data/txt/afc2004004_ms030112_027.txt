LARRY:
What was that you were telling me one time Rev. Davis. You 
stayed somewhere, and the guy told you something about. You told 
him you couldn't see your wife, and you told him you might feel 
her.

GARY: 
Well that was the time I went traveling. I got aas far as 
Greenwood coming out of Augusta Georgia.

LARRY:
Thats where my wifes [from] home, Greenwood.

GARY:
Well [I had} all the boys left me there. Of course I wouldn't do what 
they wanted me to do. I went and tried to get a place to stay 
that night. Everybody was pointing me to the city hall, thats 
the jailhouse. Went down there, I was afraid the man was going 
to search me because I had a very long pistol on me as long as my 
arm, but he hadn't wanted to search me and I'da been down there 
yet if he did. There are two things they'll go in every house 
to do to find you. They don't like a Negro that steals, you see they'll 
hunt you every day in the week, you understand, if you steal. 
If some money get away from a white man, down there once, white 
woman, and she put it on a colored fellow you understand, the wrong 
fellow that get the money. The fellow that got it was a light 
skin fellow, you understand. He was carrying a coat, you know 
he was a black fellow. The judge tells him bring me a 
pail of water and then he had him there wash his face. The more 
he washed his face the blacker he got. And then he still didn't 
turn him loose, give him 15 years anyhow. Thats right.
