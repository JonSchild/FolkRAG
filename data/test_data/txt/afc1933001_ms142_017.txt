Dear Sir:

We are preparing for release this spring a 
publication which will be used widely by secondary
schools and universities in studying the problems
of regionalism from a national viewpoint and the
problems of coordinating activities within regions.
This project of the National Progressive Education
Association is financed by the General Education 
Board.

A part of the study is concerned with the 
cultural aspects of regions: their distinctive
music, art, literature, and architecture. Do
you have any information or can you refer us to
any materials which may be of importance in
studying the regional characteristics of American
music in secondary schools and universities?

We shall appreciate any information you
may be able to give us.

Yours very truly,
Paul R. Hanna
