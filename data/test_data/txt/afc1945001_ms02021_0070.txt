           Two dry goods store merchants in Denver, August 6:
           "I don't believe the Government is of the opinion that the OPA will work. If they did they would give OPA people some authority to crack down on offenders. They tell me the other day a fellow put an out-of-state license on his car and called on four automobile dealers in Denver, told them he was a tourist in need of tires and at each place, he was offered new tires. Now if the Government would crack down on a few of these people the rest of them would get into line but dealers seem to feel that maybe the Government isn't in earnest."

"What do you think about this Nazi saboteur trial?" "Pretty bad. We were talking about it down at the office. If a few of these babies were able to get in here as easy as that crew did I bet the country is filled with 'em. They have probably come in from Canada, South America and everywhere else. It wouldn't surprise me if they would lay low for awhile until the heat's off and some of this publicity has quieted down, then in accordance with prearranged plans probably set off explosions on these defense jobs from end of the country to another."
