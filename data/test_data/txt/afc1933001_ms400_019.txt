and while he was recuperating, we treated ourselves to a leisurely stay
in a comfortable tourist camp on the outskirts of Jackson, Mississippi.

We both worked hard, made long night drives over strange rough
roads, camped only when we were too tired to go further, ate rough and
too-quickly-cooked food. Sometimes we dined alongside of convicts, more
