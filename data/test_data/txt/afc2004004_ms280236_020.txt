5) My knife it won't cut, it's as rusty as tinder,
    My knife it won't cut for it ain't worth a cinder.
    She quickly replied, "There's a knife in the window."
6) O into her bed then I very soon tumbled,
    And al you must guess how this young couple fumbled."

That's the finish of that. . .
Lomax: Where did you get that, Arthur?
Arthur: From Harry and differrent blokes out Thaxted way.

Joe: Yes, I know Barbara Allen. . .
1) In Scotalnd I was born and bred,
    In London was my dwelling,
    Till I courted a pretty  fair maid,
    Her name was Barbrie Allen.
2) I courted her four weeks and months
    Four weeks and months together,
    To see her prove untrue to me,
    Her name was Barbrie Allen.
3) I sent a servant to the house,
    To the house where she was dwelling,
    My master wants you miss, he said,
    If your name be Barbrie Allen."
4) How slowly she put on her clothes,
    How slowly she came to him.
    And the words she said when she got there,
    "Young man, you are a-dying."
5) "A-dying, love, that never can be
    When a kiss from you can save me."
    "A kiss from me you never shall have,
    For I say, young man, you'll slight me."
6) When in the ale-house the other night,
    You were out a-drinking,
    Your drank your health to all pretty girls
    And slighted Barbrie Allen.
7) Look up look up my bedside,
    You'll see a gold watch hanging,
    A gold watch and a silvery chain
    Was bought for Barbrie Alen.
