MRS. DAVIS: 
That was Thursday night, she brought him back at 11:00 and so that Friday morning we had to go, where he's supposed to go to tend to some business about the house cause some contractors were there making a well for the water. So I said You feel like going with me, He said Yeah, so he said you be sure to bring M. Asben along. I forgot about Asben, to tell the truth, he was up there in the ------ preaching and I, so I stopped off and bought some and I think he take two going along, then  he ate a sandwich and a little before we got to Hamilton New Jersey, after we turned off the turnpike, I seen, it looked like to me he was going to pass by like this. So I kind of pushed him up, I say B.Davis do you feel bad? He didn't say too much to me. So I told Larry, I say you better turn around and get us to the nearest hospital. So the man says theres one in Hampton New Jersey and he told us how to get there and we went just as fast as we could go without having a wreck. The hospital was out apiece about a mile and we want there and the minute we went right on in the emergency ward and he started right straight to working on him.  The doctors say he was a sick man.
LARRY:
Ah, Mrs. Davis, I noticed a lot of time I was around Brother Davis he would be reading the bible you know. Did he learn to read that Braille when he got hear or did he learn that when you met him?
