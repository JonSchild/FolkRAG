was blessed; so I went on to Fladah 'cause I wasleavin' him, tha's
what I was doin'.   I went on to Fladah. . .
AL:    Where'd you go in Florida?
BJ:     I went in Jacksonville.  Went to Jacksonville, Fladah.  Some
peoples was there that I knew ah, from, from, from Fitzgerald.
An' ah, I went out -- I went down there an' ah, they didn' have
no room for me an' my cousin, 'cause my cousin along wit' me,
[ah,] Clara.   An' we stopped in ah, another house that they knew
the people in Georgia, on Church an' Johnson Street.  So I stayed
there; they very nice peoples, ya know.   But I didn't have no
job, didn' know nothin' 'bout gittin' no job; never worked in a 
city.   You know, of that type, ya know.   I didn' know nothin'
about gittin' one, but I fe't (felt) like I was gonna git one.
         So that Monday -- I mean that, that Saturday, one Saturday,
a man tol' me he want me to come down to -- These peoples had been talkin' to
'im, different peoples, about me bein' there -- An' so, she said,
this man that told this lady that he'd like to have somebody to he'p
cook [an' care of 'im] at a cafe.
         So I went down to the cafe an' looked, looked around in there; [an'] the man
asked [could I he'p 'em] me about he'pin 'em.  I tol' 'im, "All
right."  So I told Clara, "I'll try any kind of a job."   {you know]
I know, [you know] I know, about cookin' for them up there home, but I
didn' worry about it.   Said I'll cook what they tell me to cook.  So.
I was gonna take that job.  That was ah, that was gonna be on a 
Monday, see?
         So that Sunday; we always walked down to the shed, ya know,
all the  time, down to the depot; you know, the Union Shed?  An'
Sunday, I [said I] an' Clara was goin' down to the Union Shed. . .
