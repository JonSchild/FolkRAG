   Sunday. Lunch with doctor
& wife at hotel. Argument with
German scientist (?). Played tapes 
for priest & nuns at hospital. They're
awful people - a species of their
own without the same blood in 
their veins - only a kind of cold
goo.

On to balay. [All] From 5 in afternoon
& on to 10:30 singing in the
airport waiting room, waulking
tweed in the house where the
Superport pilots lounged. The
best of recording sessions - difficult
but satisfactory.

Then on to see Angus McMillan
the giant of story tellers. Home
in moonlight with the moon
shining on Loch Bea like stars.
The mountains moving darkly 
behind the soft Scots mist.
