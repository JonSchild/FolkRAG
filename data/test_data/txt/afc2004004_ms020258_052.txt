SINK 'EM LOW - Bessie Jones

1)   If you want to please your captain
      Sink 'em low boy, raise 'em high
      Sink 'em low boy, sink 'em low
      Sink 'em low boy, raise 'em high.
2)   I asked the judge, what may be my fine, boy,
      He said, 'If I don't hang you, I give you ninety-nine.
      I'll give you ninety-nine, I'll give you ninety-nine. . .
3)   I asked my captain, said the mornin' come, boy,
      He says Makes no difference, I don't owe you none.
      I don't owe you none, I don't owe you none. . . etc
4)  But if I can just make it through January and February
      I'll march on through boys, I'll march on through.
      I thought I heard ol' big black Lula callin' me, boy
      She callin' me.
      Sayin':  Come back home boy, saying come back home, boy
      I heard big, black Lula callin' me.
5)   I asked that captain, what time of day, boy
      He was so hard-hearted, he just walked away.
      He just walked away, he just walked away. . . . etc.
