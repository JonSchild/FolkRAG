On the train coming up from Hartford 
a woman asked me if I heard of our dumbness 
in Iceland. I just talked with the woman 
in the upartment upstairs and she too asked 
me if I heard it, have you? They say that 
there was a submarine off Iceland and all [te] 
the time our men thought it was an icegerg.
We are getting as dumb as the English. It 
was all in the papers they say.
