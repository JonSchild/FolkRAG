TAPE:  R-3 cont. Appalachia  3

a few hid out and stayed.  They stayed hid over there, then started
moving out  . . . . . .but they marched into most churches across
Oklahoma, killed lots of women and children.
 
AL:   And what have the Indians been living on since then?

Ray:  Well, for a long time, they just had to live off the land.
But now, they're just like anybody else, you know?  They got
into factory work. . . .

AL:   Are you proud of your Indian blood?
 
Ray:  Yes sir, definitely.

AL:   Does it give you a character and a feeling that nobody else
has?

Ray:  I feellike a true American, yes sir.

AL:   You know, there's lots of people that wonder why people
stick down in the mountains where the land is so steep you
just have to take a little plug out of the ground and all the
pumpkins will roll down the hill into a sack, and so it's hard
to live down in here, you have to work hard and do without.  Why
do folks stay in the mountains, do you figure?  What's the draw of
the mountains?

Ray:   It's something gets in your blood.  I wouldn't be nowhere
else.  You have to work hard anywhere.  When the crop comes
anywhere, you have to work.

Caz:  It's cool up here, not as loud, you can breathe better, than
you can down in the low country.
