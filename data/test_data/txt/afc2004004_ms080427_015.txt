APPALACHIAN JOURNEY   -12

spring (fresh it), rain storm and thunder storms and washed
everything away.  And he just didn't see no way to turn.  But
he got his [delsimore] out and got a little solace on it to
sooth his depression.  If he hadn't had that to turn to I
don't know what he'd done.  My grandfather, Nathan Hicks
came over, his cabbage patch had been washed away, he came
over and him and daddy played their misery out, played their
misery out.  That's what they done.  And he wrote this song
and I'm going to do it, try it here now, called Poor Man.

[MUSIC]
AL  These hills were rich with Indian corn
but the market was far off over the mountains often times
and so the mountain man had to turn his corn into whiskey
and transport it to town in liquid form.  At harvest time
the neighbors gathered in to help and the men shucked away
like fury.  For every time you found a red ear you got to
kiss your favorite girl.  And somewhere down in that pile
there was a fine jug of mountain moonshine.
[SINGING]
MAN  That old land up there around the foot
of that mountain was all growin' corn.  They had to do
something to make a little money, you know.  They couldn't.
