4 THE SEARCHLIGHT
Disaster Looms For Phony Union
Utah Copper's illegitimate offspring—
company unionism—has received a mortal
blow. At one stroke the United States Government
has shattered the mountain of pretense
and hypocrisy that Copper executives and
their slinking accomplices have built up to
thwart the law and deprive Copper workers
of the fruits of honest collective bargaining.
Decency in labor relationships has scored
a notable triumph. A new day is dawning for
Copper workmen. Utah Copper Company,
bulwark of medieval industrialism in Utah,
is to be ordered to observe the laws of the nation
that has given it such magnificent opportunity—
that has sheltered it while it gathered
inestimable wealth.
Copper's scurvy twins—the mis-called "Independent
Association of Mill Workers"* and
the "Independent Association of Mine Workers"
are on the way to disintegration in the industrial
cesspool—the ultimate resting place
of vile things. They face official "dis-establishment".
The trial examiner who heard the National
Labor Relations Board ease against the Company
and its monstrous puppets last summer
has filed his intermediate report and made his
recommendations to the board. Among other
things he recommends:
1. That the respondent (Utah Copper Company
and its accomplices) shall cease dominating
or interfering with the Employees
General Committee, Independent Association
of Mine Workers, and Independent Association
of Mill Workers, and that affirmative
action be taken to effectuate the policies
of the National Labor Relations Act.
2. "Withdraw all recognition from and completely
dis-establish the Employee General
Committee, the Independent Association
of Mine Workers, and the Independent
Association of Mill Workers as representatives
of any of their employees for the purpose
of dealing with the respondents concerning 
grievances, labor disputes, rates
of pay, hours of employment, wages, or
other conditions of employment."
3. "Reimburse all of their employees for any
and all fees and dues which were checked
off by the respondents from the wages of
their employees in the manner set forth in
the section of this report entitled "THE
REMEDY'." (The return of checkoff dues
and fees affects only members of the company
unions).
4. "Post immediately in conspicuous places
throughout their mine and mills in Bingham
Canyon, Arthur, Magna, and Salt
Lake City, Utah, respectively, and maintain
for a period of not less than sixty consecutive
days from the time of posting notices
to their employees stating:
(1) that the respondents will not engage in
the conduct from which it is recommended
that they cease and desist.
(2) that the respondents will take the affirmative
action set forth in paragraph 2
of these recommendations. That their employees
are free to become or remain members
of the International Union of Mine,
Mill & Smelter Workers, CIO, or any affiliate
of the AFL, and that they will not discriminate
against any employee because of
membership or activity in said labor organization.
While the foregoing are recommendations
only of the trial examiner and must be passed
upon by the National Labor Relations Board,
they are amply supported by evidence at the
hearing and in the record. We know of no
case wherein the findings and recommendations
of the examiner has been disregarded by the 
Board.
What a humiliating come-down for Ed
Cannon, Reed Damron, Bill Madill, Charlie
Brooks and other Company stooges! The
harsh arraignment of those creatures set out
in the Searchlight in various articles is now
fully supported by the findings of the trial examiner.
How they must wince—if they are
capable of wincing! They now stand officially
exposed by an official of the Government as
human specimens who have served their masters
as decoys to ensnare their fellow workers.
What distasteful crow Charlie Brooks must
