Dear Mo:

A friend of mine, Malcolm Ross, publicity director
of the National Labor Relations Board, has written
a very nice song about sharecroppers and stuff in
the South, which one of you people has been interested
in recording for Columbia commercially.

I would like to suggest that Burl Ives do the song
because it suits his style very well.

I wish you'd route this letter around until it
reaches the right person.

Burl Ives has recently mad an album of songs for
you, I believe, and in that album has included a
number of songs from the new Lomax book. I've told
him that before he recorded those songs for you he
should get permission from my father and find out
what kind of acknowledgment John A. Lomax thought
was necessary. My father can be addressed: San
Benito Way, Dallas, Texas.

I am going to do something about those albums for
you before June.

Best regards,

Alan Lomax, Assistant in Charge
