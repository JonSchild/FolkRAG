Mr. Allen Lomax
The Library of Congress

Dear Mr.Lomax,

The other day, I was talking with Mr. Allen Eaton of the Russell Sage Foundation about my problem in American folklore and Mr. Eaton said, "You ought to write Allen Lomax, I can assure you, he will help you." Several weeks ago, I met Mr. and Mrs. Seeger, who were just up from Washington for a visit, and they both said I should try to meet you.

Away back last Spring, 1939, or perhaps it was earlier, I made a recording of two of my chants for the Decca Record Company, an experimental record. Nothing came of it, except that Dave Kapp, (is that his name?) told me had shown it to Paul Whiteman, who almost liked it. Then he told me he had shown it to Allen Lomax, and you had said it sounded authentic, like a backwoods Baptist preacher.

So we have already touched at rather intangible points: you hearing the recording I made, and I being told I should try to get in touch with you and talk with you.

I have a problem in American folklore, and I wonder if you would help me?

I have applied for a Guggenheim Fellowship, and will know whether or no I am awarded it by the first of April. If the Foundation allows me to proceed with the work I have proposed, I should like to begin research for a book on American  folklore, which, so far, I have said will be a history of American folklore, but I can't understand so far, how I could make a history. But I hope it will at least be a book. I want to find all the great figures in American mythology and tell their stories. So far, I know of Railroad, Bill, who comes from my own country in Alabama, around Mobile, I have a thorough knowledge of Paul Bunyan, I know Johnny Appleseed, I have heard stories of Kemp Morgan, Pecos Bill, Strap Buckner, Old Stormalong, Mike Fink, and others. Two yeas ago, I was fortunate enough to discover from fishermen at Bayou la Batre, Ala., the greatest fisherman in the Gulf of Mexico, Lee Bosarge. So I have a beginning, but it seems to me there must be many other great figures. You see, I have read in the books on the subject, tales about legendary figures who told great yarns and tremendous lies. They are not the people I feel I should be seeking out. I want the heroes themselves.

So I'm up a stump. I don't know where to begin looking for sources and for people who will talk with me. What I'd like to find are people who could tell me actually something about the history, I mean the approximate date of a character, who could describe his appearance, tell me what he looked like.

Now if this were simply a book I was going to write and no more than write, I wouldn't take up your time, I wouldn't even apply for a Guggenheim Fellowship, I'd dig it out along. But I'm hoping to approach the
