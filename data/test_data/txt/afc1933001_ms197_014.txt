Dear Alan:
   I replied to your earlier letter last month, but
it was held up for a while and returned to me for revision
That is why it has taken so long. The additional information
contained in your letter of February 11 only makes
your collection sound more attractive, but unfortunately
the situation here remains unchanged, and we are still
lacking in funds. I shall remember your materials when we 
next get some money to spend.

Regards,
Sincerely,


Harold Spivacke
