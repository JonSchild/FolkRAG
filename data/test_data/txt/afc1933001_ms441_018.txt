De Grey Goose 

This delightful ballad is current, so far as we know, 
only [??] on the [?] Texas prison 
farms [among] where the Negro convicts who [use] sing it as a [?] work- 
song. Since [the song] it fits in so well with the [pop]
popular folk-tradition of slavery days, in which animals 
were the principal characters of the [?] folk-songs and folk-
tales, we do not believe that it is of prison origin. 
More probably, the [steps]  because of the close relation
[both in point of time and space] between slave-operated plantation, 
share-crop plantation, plantation worked by convicts 
leased from the state and state owned prison farms [having
been gradual and having been close] in [zhe] the South 
East Texas river bottoms, this ballad has been preserved 
by the last  surviving institution to work Negroes in 
large gangs, [?] [Sate State Prison farm] the state prison 
farm- whereas it was first sung by Negro slaves. 

The melody is [?] a half-brother to a [x] spiritual 
in ballad form about Noah and the Flood, also song as a work song by 
Negro convict gangs in Texas  
"God tole Norah, 
Oh, Mount Zion, 
God tole Norah, 
Oh, Mount Zion, 
Gonna be a flood, 
Oh, Mount Zion.
Gonna be a flood,
Oh, Mount Zion." 
That this relation is legitimate is borne out by the scrap
of ballad on page     ,  Volume     , of the [?] Journal 
of the Texas Folk Lore Society, which begins:

For another version, see "American Ballads and Folk Songs", 
cares little    for          page   .
L.B. [?] the Grey Goose. It makes no 
appeal to his limited sense of humor and it has little interest 
for his modern Negro audience. He sings it only grudgingly, 
but it [is charming] remains charming in spite of him.
