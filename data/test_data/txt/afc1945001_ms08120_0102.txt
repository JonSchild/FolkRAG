In the paper about two weeks ago some
mother received a letter from her boy at camp.
He said everything was going along fine in
camp and the boys were all well. But he
said he wanted to know if it was true whether
Bing Crosby The Great Crooner had died. He
said all the boys had the blues when they heard
it. Apparently they hadn't heard the rest of the joke.
