Dear Dr. Keppel:

Your note of the 23rd, which happily confirms your previous
informal word that the grant had been decided upon, reaches
me this morning.
You ask our preference “as to time and manner of payment”:
Any date before the first of February would be convenient, and the
remittance desirable in the form of a check, addressed to me but
drawn to the order of “The Library of Congress”. Under our procedure
the check, endorsed by me, will be deposited with the Treasurer
of the United States, collected by him, and the proceeds credited to
the Library for disbursement by me for the purpose stated in the Resolution,
of which he will be furnished a copy.

With much appreciation,

Cordially yours,

Dr. Fredrick P. Keppel President
Carnegie Corporation of New York
522 Fifth Avenue
New York City
