window [over] above the door & beat a hasty retreat.
When the police tried to force the door they met
with a similar reception & this went on for quite
a while and many uniforms were messed up with
all kinds of filth.  The supply of ammunition seemed
to be inexhaustible for the fight was kept on in this
manner until finally the police commandeered a
battering ram from the adjacent carpenter's shop
and splintered the door with it's supporting barrels, presses,
counter & other heavy furniture.

The widow and her sons were then forcibly ejected
 and their belongings thrown out on the street.  Later
the police took their departure very much the 
worse for "wear".  A cottage was found for the
evicted family, not far from the village and the
remains of the furniture was installed by willing
neighborly hands.
   The public house was put up for sale and was bought
for a song by a man from the next county.  He rued
his bargain because both himself + the house were
boycotted & his only customers were occasional passing
strangers.  Eventually he decided to consume his own
stock & so met his end. The pub was boycotted until
finally a nephew of the widow returned from America &
 took over the business, made an astonishing success of it &
afforded employment to the widow's family.
   The man who bought in the widow's farm held it until
his death and the boycott on him [was] and the farm was 
not lifted until her nephew bought the place for her.
The farm is still in the possession of the family under 
the conditions of one of the Land Acts.
