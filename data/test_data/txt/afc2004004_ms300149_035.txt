Dear Friend,
The enclosed check in the amount of 
$6.00 is your payment for singing in
the chorus of one song led by
Leroy Miller of Camp 7. This song 
will come out soon on a record which
is part of a new series being published
by Prestige, Inc.
My best regards to you and my many 
friends at Parchman.
Sincerely Yours,
Alan Lomax
