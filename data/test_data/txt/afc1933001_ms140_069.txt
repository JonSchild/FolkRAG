Dear Doctor Beck:

Thank you for your informative
letter. As soon as the Archive plans
for the spring have been made, I
shall let you know, and you may be
sure that we shall do our best to
have a recording machine in Michigan
as soon as possible. The list of
songs recorded by Bill MacBride will
be prepared for you after the
holidays.

With my best regards for the
holiday season to you and to my
friend, MacBride, I am

Cordially yours,


Assistant in Charge of
