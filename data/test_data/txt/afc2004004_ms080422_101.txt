Tape:  898 cont. Nimrod Workman  3
He said old man, old man, I married your daughter
But she is not yet worth to me
She came to me all in a horse and buggy
Just ride back home in her courtship free.

Well Shuslempine put out her lily whitehand
Led her over his marble wall
He married two wives in the morning sun,
And Shuslempine at 12 o'clock at noon.

Nimrod:  Well, that's a wild tune. . . . .ain't nobody else knows
it be me. . . . . . . . . . .My grandfather and old Peter McNealy, come
out of the Reb and Yankee war. . . . . . . . . . . yeah, when you get
about 80, you can do that.  I've heard thousands and thousands
try that before.
AL:  Can yo do that?
Phyllis:  No, I've tried, I have to get 80 before I can do
that.
Nimrod:  No, no one can, no one but me. . . . .You see, I have
my things that nobody else can do.  That's this one and 
Lord Bateson, a few  things that other people can't do.
AL: Well, I think there's no question about the fact that
there have to be some originals in the world that are
different from everybody else.  If there weren't those
people, life would be dull.
Nimrod:  I always said I'm wanna learn something, wanna do
something that no other boys can't do, I'm gonna learn
something that nobody else can do.  Finally , I got to. . . .cut.
Nimrod:  I've got this whole row through here to dig yet. Some
of 'em's big, some not so big. . . anyhow there eatin' potatoes.
