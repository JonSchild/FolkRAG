grave, my sons away in foreign parts, 
and my daughters in their
own married homesteads, I look 
back on the past, and wonder 
that energy was given me, not 
only to consent to the plan of 
aiding my Prince, but also firmly 
to carry it out. Indeed, never 
was I more surprised than when
the proposal was made to me, of 
conducting his Royal Highness from these 
small islands to the mainland. And 
now I will relate how it happened.
138.  At this time I was staying 
with my dear brother Angus at 
Miltown in South Uist. Some 
months before I had become 
acquainted with Captain Oâ€™Neil, 
& in conversing with him & others 
on the topic which engrossed 
the attention of all five. [beasked?]
