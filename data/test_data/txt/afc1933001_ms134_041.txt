FOLKSONGS
ON PARADE

Pennsylvania Festival to
Be Held This Year at
Beaver College

By LAWRENCE E. DAVIES
PHILADELPHIA.

BALLADS that were sung a century ago to the accompaniment 
of the woodcutters axe in Pennsylvania's
virgin forest, and street cries
that resounded through Philadelphia's 
and Baltimore's alleyways
when fish women and clam peddlers
were in their heyday, will vie
with other occupational and racial
folksongs in the fourth annual
Pennsylvania folk festival to be
held next Saturday.
Those who last year and the year
before went to Bucknell University
at Lewisburg to attempt to recapture
the spirit of the Commomwealth's
native minstrelsy ( as well
as the folklore imported with its
mixture of racial groups) will turn
this year to the sloping green of
Beaver College, near Jenkintown,
just to the north of this city.
Bucknell is lending its distinctive
festival to Beaver College and the
Pennsylvania Arts and Sciences Society, 
its joint sponsors for 1938, to
be part of the tercentenary celebration
of the landing of the first
Swedes and Finns on the banks of
the Delaware.
Because of this the largest participating
group will be of Swedish
descent. But there will be, too
ballad-singing miners from the anthracite
region, whip-cracking sons
of Conestoga teamsters from York
and Lancaster Counties, Pennsylvania
Dutch farmers with songs and
dances, lumbermen from the Northern
Tier counties, Welsh women
singers and Negro spiritual groups.
Originated at Allentown
The Pennsylvania festival originated
at Allentown in 1935, when
George Korson, who has been collecting
folklore as a hobby for a
dozen years, "sold" the idea to the
recreation commission of that city.
Bucknell University took it over the
next year and made it part of the
institution's services to Pennsylvania.
In three years the festival has attracted
40,000 spectators from twenty-seven
States and new ballads
have been brought to light every
year, some as a result of a series of
regional festivals preceding the
State event.
"There are no professionals on

the program," says Mr. Korson.
"Every participant is an amateur.
The festival is part of a movement
to revive and stimulate interest in
the folklore of Pennsylvania. By
means of regional and State festivals
we are bringing to the surface
folklore which otherwise would be
lost and we are making it available
and publishing it for creative artists.
The music we find can be
used by musicians, the legends by
novelists and playwrights."
Under the leadership of Mr. Korson
and Louis Walton Siply of this
city, director of the Pennsylvania
Arts and Sciences Society and executive
director of the festival, an
all-day program has been arranged
for next Saturday. The morning
will be devoted to an old-time
craftwork exhibition, an exhibition
of antiques and a State championship
auctioneering contest, with
a medal for the winner. The competing
auctioneers will show their
abilities in an auction of antiques.
Nobody under 65 will participate
in the craftsman show, in which
silversmiths, music engravers, scientific
instrument makers, wood
carvers and others will demonstrate
their arts.
On a large stage in the shadow of
Grey Towers, the castle now occupied
by Beaver College, lumbermen
from Northern Pennsylvania will
usher in the afternoon program
and a sizable company of Swedish
performers, riding in on a load of
hay, will end it with a Harvest Festival.
