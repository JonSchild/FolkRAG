and antique communal spirit.
The dawn mists [turned] touched the rocks
& the little grey houses [in] with
strange white magic

Yesterday woke exhausted 
at 11. Put Father John on the
boat for Little Eriskaay which
has pink roofs against the
green. Afternoon recorded
14 [xx] shy girls at school
doing a waulking. Kissed the
oldest goodbye and they 
scattered like pigeons, laughing,
shrieking. Then visited Duncan
MacDonald & the bands family.
Real country poverty & stink.
Fat baby. Duncan a glittering
Celt - greying moustache.

Last evening tried to record
a waulk at the schoolhouse.
Noise from the machine.
