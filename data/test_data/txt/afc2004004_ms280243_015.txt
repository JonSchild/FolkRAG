Tape 93I EWAN MACOLL:    [*STANLEY SLADE ALSO ON THIS REEL.*]
Johnson's Motor Car:
1)  It was at Johnson's corner one morning I did stray,
When I met a fellow rebel who to me these words did say,
"I've orders from the captain to assemble at Dunbar.
But how am I to get there without a motor car?"

2)  "Now Barney dear, be of good cheer, and I'll tell you what we'll do
The Black and Tans are plentiful, while, we are but a few.
We'll send a note to Stranbar before we get that far,
And we'll give the boys a jolly good ride in J's mrotor car.

3)  When Dr. Johnson got the news he soon put on his shoes.
Says he, "This must be an urgent case and I have no time to lose.
With the fancy stick and a castor hat and on his breast a star,
You could hear the din all through Glen Finn of J's motor car.

4)  When Dr. Johnson reached the bridge some rebels he mete there,
Of course he knew the game was up, and at him they did stare.
Says he, "I have me permit, boys, to travel near and far."
"We don't want your English permit, we want your motor car."

5)  So they got the motor started an filled her to the brim
with guns and bayonets shinging, and at him they did grin.
They sent the Sinn Fein flying high, and when we get that far,
When Ireland gets her freedom, you'll get your motor-car."

The Heir of Lynne:
1)  Lane he stands and land he gangs,
The weary heir of Lynne,
And lane he stands on the cauld causie,
And nane will let him in, him in,
And nane will let him in.

2)  When he was the bonnie heir o' Lynne
His clothes lay aye in fauld,
But noo he stands on the cold causie
And rives his chafts for cauld.

3)  When he was the bonnie heir of Lynne,
His brose was keepit hot,
But noo he stands on the cold causie,
And nane will gie him meat.

4)  "O gie me a loaf of your bread, nourice,
And gie me a glass o' your wine.
And I'se'll pay ye seven times o'er
When I am the heir of Lynne."
