   I had "Meal and Ales" here for, I would think, very

Lord, it would take me two hours to tell you.  I couldn't
tell you in two or three minutes...you have to lead up to
your story...you've no idea the things that would happen.

There was a chap Meldrum - a good-looking chap... I
had him at Craigie's there...I had five farms before the
war.  In 1941 I had five farms, and I think I sold two
in 1941.  I sold that one up there in 1942.  That was
three... and then I've still this one and the other one

   Well, this chap Meldrum - that was his name - and

   This chap, Meldrum....
   Now, if you don't understand my language, stop me...
   Well, this chap, Meldrum, he was terrible on for this
lass, you see...and he was one of the goodish kind of men
and real nice looking....and the grieve of Craigie's - 
a man black of the roughest old bloody rarities...he could
say funny things...he wasn't a clever man, but he could hit
