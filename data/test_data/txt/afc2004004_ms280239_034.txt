     That man with a few Canadian farmers and not one of
them managed him at all. The greatest men that ever was on
the face of the earth - a friendly man, but he would keep
his neb. You couldn't begin to patronize him or anything. . . .
Well. . . . . he wrote me and this is his letter . . . . I've got it
now somewhere. If over I had a row with the man I was
going to produce this letter to the Sheriff.
      "Mr. John Strachan. Dear Sir, The farmers here be
a set - you know what I mean by set - of bad buggars. . . . .
The first one I went to put me to black his boots, so I
buggared him and he put me away. . . . . . He wouldn't have cleaned
my boots, but he kent that I'd clean his to put him to one
of the balls or anything, or what he would have been adoing.
He says "You should - I was late being home - and he remembered
we were friends. And he said don't go amongst the girls, John
laddie, when you're going to pay your men. But if you would
be a bad buggar you would have never seen this. . . . . that was
the two or three or four dogs. Yours truly, Sam Morrison"
     We had a kowtow a minute. . . . . How he is getting on. . . . .
     Oh, he said, it was just a frolic before death.
