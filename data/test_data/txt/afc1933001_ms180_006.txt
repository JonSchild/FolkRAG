Dear John and Alan Lomax:
          In the current issue of Common Ground we
are featuring the article "Ear Players" by
Woody Guthrie, who I believe is known to you. 
This is the first of a series of articles
which we hope to do on American folk materials:
not academic studies but vivid and graphic 
stories of the people who have made the songs 
and legends of the country what they are today.
We feel that Guthrie has given us a good start 
in this direction.
I am sending you this issue under separate 
cover and hope that it will interest you. But
I hope, too, that you yourselves will want to 
do an article for us in the near future.  "Our
Singing Country" has made us feel that we would 
be especially delight to have you represented 
in the series of articles.  It is a splendidly 
American book.
We would be glad to see an article written 
around your Preface, or about Old Lize Pace or 
some other of the "best singers."  But perhaps 
you have other stories which will interest you.
I am enclosing some material which will 
tell you more about Common Ground.  As you will 
see, our rates of payment are embarrassingly low,
but we've had fine co-operation from writers who 
feel that we are doing an important job.
May I hear from you soon?
Sincerely,
Frank Mlakar
Assistant Editor
