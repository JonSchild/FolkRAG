COOPERATIVE YOUTH SONGS

A CALL TO ACTION 
Tune - There are Smiles

We'll no longer work for wages,
we'll just take all we produce;
We have been wage slaves all thru the ages,
We ourselves must break the fetters loose,
Then we will no longer heed the masters,
Our defiance at them we will hurl,
And we'll bid goodbye to all wage slavery
And our banner we will unfurl.

WE WILL SING ONE SONG
By Joe Hill
(Melody - My Old Kentucky Home)

We will sing one song of the meek and humble slave
The horny-handed son of the soil,
He's toiling hard from the cradle to the grave,
But his master reaps the profits of his toil.
Then we'll sing one song of the greedy master class,
They're vagrants in broadcloth, indeed,
They live by robbing the ever-toiling mass,
Human blood they spill to satisfy their greed.

CHORUS Organize! O, toilers, come organize your might;
Then we'll sing one song of the Workers' Commonwealth
Full of beauty, full of love, and health.

We will sing one song of the politician sly,
He's talking of changing the laws;
Election day all the drinks and smokes he'll buy
While he's living from the sweat of your brow.
Then we'll sing one song of the girl below the line,
She's scorned and despised everywhere,
While in their mansions of the 'keepers' wine and dine
From the profits that immoral traffic bear.

We will sing one song of the children in the mills,
They're taken from playgrounds and schools.
In tender years made to go the pace that kills,
In the sweatshops, 'mong the looms and the spools.
Then we'll sing one song of the Workers' Commonwealth,
The hope of the toiler and slave,
It's coming fast; it is sweeping sea and land,
To the terror of the grafter and the knaves.
