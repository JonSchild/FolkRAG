"I wouldn't mind fixing up a couple of rooms for defense workers,
but I tried to get a plumber to come up and look at what I wanted done and he
laughed at me to think I could expect him to even look at what I wanted done in
less than seven weeks. He was booked solid for seven weeks, and he told me
every plumber in town was the same way. The Government has taken all their

misinterpretation)

the casualty list on that one, the people will probably begin to realize we're
in a war. I can't see how they figure they can't get the Japs out of the
Aleutians because of the fog. Hell, they got in there in the fog, didn't they?"
