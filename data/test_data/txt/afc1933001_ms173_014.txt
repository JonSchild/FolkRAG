Memorandum

To the Chief of the Music Division
August 21, 1941

In re:  Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt and John A. Lomax recording trip.

John A. Lomax has request the use of a portable machine for 
two or three months for the following purposes:

To record a number of singers located in Texas while 
on his way to Livingston, Alabama.  There he plans to assist 
Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt in initiating a field project in 
Alabama, to remain with her until she learns the use of the 
equipment.  The recording equipment will remain with Mrs. 
Tartt for two and possible more months while she records 
songs of that section of the country.

Mr. Lomax is anxious to initiate this trip as soon as possible 
and I am informed by Mr. Wiesner that a Model K machine will be 
available upon Mr. Cohen's return from Maine.

The approximate budget for the tip appears below.
