at that time of the century they used to have dances for fiddle
players or musicians from one house to the other.
     Well, this Tom Haley always used to carry a stick with him,
and when there'd be a dance arranged for him in a certain
house, when he'd go to the door he always gave three taps with
his stick to the flagstone outisde the door. And if he did't like
the sound of the taps with the stick, he wouldn't go into the
hpuse if they'd give him a thousand pounds. Anyway, he taught
all those musicianeers and those musicianeers taught us.
Lomax: What was the connection between Haley and the fairies.
Michael: One night Tom Haley was going home and he had to cross
the Oranmore River. He had his own special flat-bottomed boat going
across the river. It's a very narrow river, say fifteen yards at
the most. He could always make his way once he got in the gate
at Ballinakarra himself. But this night he was going home about
12 o'clock at night and when he got over the other side, this
man approached him. He says, "I beg your pardon, Mr. Haley, but
I want to have a word with you."
"Right," says Mr. Haley, "Who are you?"
"Never mind who I am. I'm a fiddle player. I want you to play
one tune. And I want the tune to be a tune I cannot play. And
if I play a tune that you cannot play then you come with me."
"I don't know so much about that," says Haley. "I want to know
who you are."
"Never mind who I am," he says. "I want you to play the tune
that I cannot play."
"Well, I'll do my best," says Haley.
"I'll give you time. I'll give you 24 hours to think it over."
"I don't want 24 hours," says Haley. "I'll meet you tomorrow
night at the same time." and we'll have a go. But who are you?"
"Never mind who I am. I'll tell you who I am tomorrow night."
     So they met the next night, and this fiddle player started
and he played a tune, and heod play that tune alright.
"Now," he says, "I want to hear one from you, Mr. Haley."
"Right," says Haley, and he played "The Lark in the Morning."
So that baffled him. He couldn't attempt to play it and he
didn't know it. He couldn't play it
anyway, because the tune concerned was the lark rising from
the ground to the heavens, and that baffled the man. Sp he
disappeared. That finished the musical contest.
Seamus: Because the man was a fairy he couldn't play any tune
that was ascending to the heavens.
Mich: And this is the tune that Tim Haley played.
