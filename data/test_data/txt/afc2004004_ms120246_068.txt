In the Woule there is more activity
and there is a step called tu "croisseur"
when the man & the woman hold hands
in couples & then the paired hands
are touched together.
After this they promenade about poto

each couple holding hands, one couple
backing away before the other.
The grant promenade is a circle
made about the poto mitands
Vogue d'la

cavalier takes the left hand of the dame
between his two and they go first
c clockwise (the dame backing) then
