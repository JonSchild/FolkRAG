Dear Waters: A long time 
ago I sent you from Europe
a short letter to which I have
never received an answer.
I imagine you had quite
troubles enough without bothering
with me. To which conclusion
I agree without a 
quibble. I judge, too, that
seeing the book past the
galley proof reading was
not nearly so simple as
it appeared to me when I
left Washington so precipitately
leaving you "to hold the
bag." I hold myself in
readiness to make up to
you in any possible way
