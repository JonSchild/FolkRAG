Dear Mr. Darrow:
Attached is a copy of a statement which I made in reply to a 
copy of a notice sent to my publisher by one Arthur E. Garmaize,
attorney-at-law.
Please do not therefore further quote me as saying that Alla en
el Rancho Grande might be in the public domain.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
