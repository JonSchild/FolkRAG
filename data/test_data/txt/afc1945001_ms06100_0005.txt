2. (Second version) "It's pitiful the way they're getting around
this tire rationing. Why all a man's got to do is just walk
down the street looking like he needs tires, and he'll get
propositioned. Course, some of them are stolen tires, but
there's plenty of deals that are legal because they can sell
you four tires and a two-bit trailer for $150.00 and be
within the law." [Oklahoma City 8-5          19]
