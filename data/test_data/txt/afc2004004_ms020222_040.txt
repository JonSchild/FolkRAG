BJ TAPE 7C, p. 38

ANYHOW
CHORUS: Just anyhow, anyhow,
Just anyhow, my Lord,
At the cross, you can bow
And go on to Heaven anyhow.

1) If your sister talk about you
And scandalize your name,
At the cross, you can bow
And go on to Heaven anyhow. (CHORUS)

2) If your brother talk about you,
Just let the Holy Ghost be your guide,
And at the cross, you can bow
And go on to Heaven anyhow. (CHORUS)

3) If your brother dominize (dominates) you,
And scandalize your name, etc. (CHORUS)

4) If you don't like your brother
[And] Then don't scandalize his name,
[Then] But at the cross, you must bow,
Just go on to Heaven anyhow. (CHORUS)

5) If your mother talk about you
And scandalize your name,
At the cross, you can bow,
Now, go home to Heaven anyhow. (CHORUS)
