Reverend Roe.  Reel 4.  P. 2.
A: What was valuable about this land?--timber on it, or wh
R: It had nice timber on it, and then it was real good land. I've 
known when my father made as high as 100 bales of cotton on his farm
[*It was valuable land*]

hadn't been able to do that. And it was real goodland; we had some
