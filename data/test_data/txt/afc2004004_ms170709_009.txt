An he said, "Well if I go out now I'll prob'ly git hoarse." If he stay 
out late at night he'd always git hoarse. So he stayed an I went on. 
But I wasn't satisfied at the dance. I don't know why I jes couldn't 
enjoy it or nothin and I jes kep sayin, "Less go. I wanna go back home." 
Shorty kep sayin, "I'll never take you nowheres no mo. I'm not ready to 
go. You worries me bout takin you." I say, "Well I wanna go home." But 
he wouldn't come. He jes wouldn't go. So finally when we got home we 
saw where the house was torn all apart. I said, "You see, if you had of 
come when I said maybe this wouldn't of happened." They had done carried 
Huddie to jail.
(All of your people all loved Huddie?)
Mmmm-h mmm! Everyone of them! All of them! They don't think there's nothin 
like him. Jes like Alvin. Now he'll never forgit him. Ever time he hears 
t ell of somebody gittin killed he say, "I guess they done him like they 
done Uncle Huddie." He never will forgit that. Thass the reason I carried 
him all the way with me to the funeral an everything. He always talks 
about the way we left Uncle Huddie in the ground. He'll never forgit him. 
He loved Huddie. Thass the reason I could tell when Huddie was gittin so 
sick an so low because everytime Alvin would come in an go out he'd cry. 
Shed tears. He loved that kid. After I carried him back to the hospital 
th e last time everything anybody would bring him there he'd send it to 
Alvin. I'll never forgit: Somebody had brought him a apple. An I cut the 
apple half in two so he could have a piece an he said, "Well take this 
other piece to my little man." Thass what he called Alvin all the time. 
Tiny took that [peic] piece a apple an kep it. She have it right now. He 
often asked, "Where's my piece a apple that Uncle Huddie gave me? You 
still got it? Well keep it." H e's always askin, "Can I play the git-tar 
now?" I say, "No. Wait till you git a little bigger so you can hold it." 
I let him play one time. He said, "Now put it up and lock it up. I don't 
want [h] nobody else to put their hand on it." Alvin's so musically inclined
