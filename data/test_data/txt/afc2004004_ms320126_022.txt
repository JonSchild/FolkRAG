I'd like to talk a little bit.  What do you think about the
comeback of French Music, is it here. . .
LUDERIN
Well, you want me to comment on that?
A. LOMAX
Yeah.
LUDERIN
The Cajun music is coming back, but what is happening now, a
lot of the younger people are adding, kind of like the bop
music and they're beginning to change the rhythm style, in
other words the drums are taking over.  And they're getting
away from the traditional Cajun.  Now, this is probably what
you might say a revolution in our music.  They're also
coming out with this Zydeco music, and that is more or less
black musicians playing Cajun numbers to their style that
they brought down from Africa.
A. LOMAX
What about speaking French?  Do they speak French over where
you are?
LUDERIN
Yes.  My mother can't even speak english.  She's ninety
eight.  Ninety eight years old.  She never did speak
English. but, we have, where I live over at Bunny Flake
(sp?), we have about every one, or every other person speak
French, because most of the people at the lake company is
[form] from Lafayette, Abbeville or around here and a lot of 'em
speak French.
A. LOMAX
Do you think French is coming back as a language?
LUDERIN
No.  I don't think so.  I didn't even teach my kids French
'cos this is an English country, but they could kill me
right now because they wish they could speak French.  But me
and my wife figured it wasn't necessary, so both of us could
speak French but we didn't teach 'em French.
