An she couldn't talk when she got like that.  You can't talk.  Not
when thass goin on.  You have to wait till that's ovah.  No, you
couldn't say nothin.  You couldn't say nothin to save yo life.
. . .It's a terrible thing to be in that situation an not be able to
git holt of nothin.
     (Well, you know women are not always situated themselves
so that they can say yes to you.)
     I know that.  I know it.
     Did you know one thang?  Nobody ever has sit down an
listen to me talk but what loved to heah me talk.  Always have.
Always did.  People want to know, why I know so much an can't see.
See, God-A-Mighty filled me full of wisdom. . .He did that, you understand,
so that I could take care of mysef.  Be able to take care of
somebody else.
     You know, you heah a lot of women say they don't know
what they husband doin, what they sweetheart doin.  You know, thass
a lie.  Whenever you do what you oughta do, you understan, you k now
what that man's doin.  Else you not a real woman.  You know whether
he's able to have ary nother woman, or else you're not a real
woman.  Cause if you ever grab him, you'll grab him like yo u ought
to grab him, you understand, he won't want to be boddered wid you
no mo in a long time.  He'll be a pretty lil boy.  I know what I'm 
talkin bout.  If it's done right, I declare you goin be quiet.  I
know what I'm talkin bout.  Ain't gon hardly want to work next day.
Ef she grab him right.  Else she not a woman.  You know, anything that's
done ought to be done the right way, or not at all,  You know?
Now, if you half do your work, you understand, somebody's gon put
the other half an do it.  You see?  Yo u know what kind of woman a 
man ought to have, and what kina man a woman ought to have?
