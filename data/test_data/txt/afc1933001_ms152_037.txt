Dear Mr. Eaton:

Thank you for the delightful
story and for your permission to use
it in the book. It will be quoted
in connection with a Kentucky version
of the Bonaparte fiddle tune. Perhaps
you might be interested in tuning in 
on my folk-song program on the American
School of the Air every Tuesday morning
at 9:15 beginning January 9.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
