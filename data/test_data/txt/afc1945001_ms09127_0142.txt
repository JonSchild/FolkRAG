White, Betty     [*a*]
English II, 3 period
3/12/43

     A Flying Fortress was returning
home after a bombing
raid. It looked as if it
would fall apart. The
people wondered how it
had flown such a distance.
The pilot opened the door
and stepped down. The door
fell off its hinges.

     A few years ago a man
went to Japan to teach the
emperor to ice-skate. This
man is about the only
man alive who touched
the emperor.
