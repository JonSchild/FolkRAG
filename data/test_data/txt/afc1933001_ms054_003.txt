[E?ledit?]

Port Aransas, Texas,
1/15/1939.

My dear Mr. Spivake:

Will you please ask
Mr. Frank Magill to place on
top of his file of unanswered requests 
this inquiry?

I wish the words of a song, "Rosalie, the
Prairie Flower", sung on the Plains
as late as 1865 and current probably
as early as 1850. Please
send them to me as soon as
possible, and oblige

Yours sincerely,
John A. Lomax
