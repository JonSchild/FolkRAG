Lomax, J. 1942

June 18, 1942

To Whom It May Concern:

John A. Lomax, Honorary Curator of the Archive of
American Folk Song in the Library of Congress and probably
the most distinguished collector of American folk songs,
is making an official trip for the Library of Congress in
Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico to record cowboy songs
and cowboy music.

Although these songs have been written in books,
no recordings of them are available, and it is extremely
important to record them from the lips of old-time
westerners before they are completely lost.  I hope that
Mr. Lomax will be given all the assistance in your power
to carry out this important piece of work,  The records
he makes will be deposited in the Archive of American
Folk Song for the use and benefit of the American people.

Harold Spivacke, Chief
Division of Music
