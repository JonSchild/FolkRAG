Dear Friend,
The enclosed check in the amount of 
$10.00 is your payment for singing 
in the chorus of work songs led by
Ed Lewis, Johnny Lee Moore and
George Golden. These songs are
going to come out on a new series
of records published soon by Prestige
recording company.
With my best regards to you and all
my friends in Camp B.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
