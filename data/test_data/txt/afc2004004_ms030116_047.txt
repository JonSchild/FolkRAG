Mrs. D:  Yeah.
Rev. D:  Goes on in church?!  What did you say?  You tell on the church you'll

Eliz:  You think sometimes the women in the church will fall in love with the
minister?
Mrs. D:  Yeah.  Lots of time.
Eliz:  Why do you think they choose him?
Mrs. D:  Well -- I tell you a lot of times the preacher is nice an polite
so they do have to have a lot of dealins with diff'rent people in the church.
An a lot of times it happen that the preacher is really not thinkin about them
but they take it really for sincerely.  See?  One thing:  a preacher th at's up-to-date, 
he's not gonna fall for everything that he sees.  But you take somebody
that ain't much count, they'll try to fall out for everything.  See?
Eliz:  Did you ever have any of your congregation fall in love with you, Rev.
D?
Rev. D:  I wouldn't low it.  No, I tell em t o start wid:  If you want me to stay
here jes love me as a Christian.
