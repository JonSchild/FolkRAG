Dear Sirs:-
I recently read in the Geographic Mag. that you
have a section devoted to Folk songs and old ballads.
I know many that I have never heard on Radio or any
where else. Other than from my old Grand Mother and
old Irish & English ballads from my old Great Grand Mother.
She was Irish birth but came to Mich from Va when
small. Her maiden name was Carter. Doubtless a
connection of Carlie Glass. I wish you could have 
heard her sing. "My bonny young Irish boy" I try to
immate the cadence and something else I can't 
describe in her voice: It's in all old genuine Irish voices.
I also know an old Holland ballad translated into 
English. These had tunes. Real music. Not the monoluge
variety. They say we have no real war songs this
time as before. Why? Just because old proffesional
writers are slipping. And they have a Union that holds
out all beginners. A.S.C.A.P. tried to help beginners and
now they boycott all A.S.C.A.P. writers. And will not
sell to a publisher who takes from them.
Nice clean American game. "Eh what?
What are they going to do when these old heads die
off? I can write lyrics to fit movies better then many
used. I always had a seventh sense for fitness. 
When I was a small girl it alway jarred on my
nerves to have a minister choose hymns alien to his
sermon.
