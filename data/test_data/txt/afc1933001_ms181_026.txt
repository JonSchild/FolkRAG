Dear Mr.Lomax;

Mr .Evans suggests that you might be willing

to speak at our annual conference in Milwaukee in June.

The day would be Thursday ,June 25th,in the afternoon.

Donald Kohlstedt,the librarian of Grand Rapids,Michigan,

will preside , and the meeting will be for the adult librarians

as well as for this Division.

We would like to call your talk " American

Folklore and Music in Recordings". It will mean a good deal

to us if you can tell us how to get good recordings, how to

correlate them with books ,how to make an effective program

of American stories and records . Librarians all over the

country are asked to advise the broadcasting studios. In

the small towns especially , they have a good deal of influence.

Now that recordings are so technically perfect ,and so cheap,

we would like to be ready, always, to tell the small ,local

stations just when to get them, how to use them.
