[*PREDJUDICE & FIGHTING BACK*]
AL: Bessie, you couldn't have lived in the place that you've
lived -- I don't care how much you moved away from it..
BJ: Um-hum. Um-hum.
AL: ...and kept yourself with good people, without seein' a 
lot of this, and hearin' a lot of this in your life.
BJ: Uh-hum.
AL: For instance: Did any Negro in your count[r]y ever try to vote?
In your part of Georgia?
BJ: We votes there.
AL: No, but I mean in the old days.
BJ: Oh, no. Hum-um. Not (MUMBLED NEGATIVES)  I never heard of it it.
I heard about this votin' business 'long here...not too long
back. But not no votin', no. 'Cause they wa'n' even talkin' about
[then] nothin' like that. I don't guess they was, I don't guess they was,
everybody was afraid to mention it, maybe. I didn't hear nothin'
about nothin' like that, no votin'. They, they paid taxes,
some kinda head tax an' road tax, but they quit that now. [Now] Ya know...
at that time. 'Cause my uncle didn' have to pay none at all.
Never did pay none. 'Cause he was too tall. But that was the
law. That is the law.
TL: Too tall?
BJ: Uh-hum. He was over seven feet.
TL: To vote?
BJ: Yeah, Seven feet. No, not to vote, to pay taxes. Didn'
ha' to pay no head tax [an'] or no road tax. I guess he had to pay
tax on his food, sumpin' he was livin' now (?) to buy it with.
He didn' ha' to pay no tax. He was the tallest guy in that
country. An' you git -- You git seven feet, ya don't feel it.
