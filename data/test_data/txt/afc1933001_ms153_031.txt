Dear Alan:
Our Order Department has just reported back to me that record 20810
is no longer available and therefore we could not make a shipment
of it to Roy Harris. Insofar as I know the other records which
you requested us to ship just before Christmas were delivered.
How soon are you going to give me an answer on the recording proposal?
Very sincerely yours,
R.P.  Wetherald
