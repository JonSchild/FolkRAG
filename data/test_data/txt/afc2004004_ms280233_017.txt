TAPE 31. .Elizabeth CRONIN:
Lord Gregory
1) I am a king's daughter that's straight from Capoquinn,
In search of Lord Gregory, may God I find him.
The rain beats at my yellow locks and the dew wets me still,
My babe is cold in my arms, Lord Gregory, let me in.
2) Lord Gregory he is not here and I swear can't be seen,
He's gone to bonnie Scotland to bring home his new Queen.
So leave now the windows and likewise this hall,
For it's deep in the sea you should hide your downfall.
3) O who'll shoe my babe's little feet, who'll put gloves on her
And who'll tie my babe's middle with a long & green band//hands,
Who'll comb my babe's yellow locks with an ivory comb,
And who'll be my babe's father  till Lord  Gregory comes home?
4) I'll shoe your babe's little feet, I'll put gloves on her hands,
And I'll tie your babe's middle with a long and green band.
I'll comb your babe's yellow locks with an ivory comb,
And I'll be your babe's father till Lord Gregory comes home.
5) Do you remember, darling Gregory, that night in Capacuinn,
When we both changed pocket handkerchieves and that against my will,
For yours was pure linen, love, and mine was coarse cloth,
Yours cost one guinea love, and mine but one groat.
Leave now those windows, and likewise this hall,
For it's deep in the sea you should hide your downfall.
6) Do you remember, Lord Gregory, that night in Capacuinn,
We both changed rings on our fingers and I against my will.
For yours was pure silver, love, mine was black tin,
Yours cost one guinea, love, and mine cost one cent.
Leave now those windows and likewise this hall,
For it's deep in the sea you should hide your downfall.
7) My curse on you, mother, and my curse being sore,
Sure I dreamt the lass of Warms came a-rapping to my door.
Lie down, you foolish son, and lie down and sleep,
For it's long ago a weary lass a-waving in my deep.
8) Come saddle me the black horse and the brown and the bay,
Come saddle me the best horse in my stable this day.
And I'll range over valleys, o'er mountains so wide,
And I'll find the lass of Warms and lay by her side.
