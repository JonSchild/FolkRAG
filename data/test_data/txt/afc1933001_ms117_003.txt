lend me something. Could my salary check be sent by airmail???

When you hear my records you will understand at once where the
Negro got his spirituals. The melodies are completely different,
of course, but the voo-doo chants have the same feeling as the
spirituals. And my God, what drumming!
Give me a month and I'll try to pretend the cold scientist, but
right now everything is too new. Could you tell me how Strunkk
feels about the copy of the report (written to Dr. Putnam) that
I sent him.

Yours,
Alan
