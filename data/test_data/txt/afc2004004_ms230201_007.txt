Big Bill:  [Now]  Let's come to a show-down. We really want to know why
               and how come a man have the blues. I've worked on levee camps
               extra gangs, road camps, rock camps and every place and
                I've heered guys singin'  "mm-mm'this" and "mm-mm-that" and
                I want to get it plain that the blues is something from the
                heart.  I know that.  Whensonever I heered a fella singin' 
               the blues, I always believed that it was really a heart
               thing and it expressed his feelin's about how he felt---
               to the people--- and that's the only way he knowed to say
               those things. 
               I've knowed guys that wanted to cuss out the boss an' was afraid
               to go up to his face an' tell him what he wanted to tell him. 
               I've heered em' sing those things back to the boss.  Like a guy would
               just be behind the wagon or hookin' up the horses and he'd make
               like the horse stepped on his foot and he'd say, "Get off my foot
               Goddammit!!" and he meant he was talkin' to the boss---"You
               sonofabitch, you, you've got no business- ... Get off my foot!!"
The Kid:  Well, Natchez, I don't want to cut you off, but that's my idea
                of the blues.  I think blues is mostly revenge.
