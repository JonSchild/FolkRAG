greater confidence in rumors than before.  The rumor must be
described as false, a tremendously exaggerated and distorted
picture.  Emphasis must be put on the errors, with a minor
passing gesture toward the true parts.

A rumor that has two parts, or is relatively lengthy, 
should not be included in direct counteraction programs.  If
the rumor is complex in form, then the response to it will have
to be relatively complex and it becomes difficult for the un-
trained reader to keep the various parts separate.  He loses
track of what is being denied.  The whole sequence  becomes a 
reading exercise without the sharp lining of of "False" and "True" 
which is implied in the sort of program designed. 
 
[*Such rumors 
should be broken 
up and each part dealt with 
separately.*]

Some rumors are simply direct expressions of prejudice.
Prejudice is literally "pre-judgment."  Denial of prejudice
is useless, for the person already has the judgment.  The
traditional advice concerning not arguing religion and politics
represents the tacit acknowledgment that in these spheres,
prejudice is such as to prevent argument on a rational level.
Such argument generally serves merely to cause the holder of
the belief to assume his position with greater vehemence.  It
must be recognized that there are prejudices outside of the 
realm of politics and religion which people maintain with the 
same degree of fervor.  If the direct counteraction program attacks
people's prejudices crudely, directly, it will be found
very soon that those attacked will be completely alienated;
whereas, an attack upon material of a less emotional nature will
not produce the same result.
