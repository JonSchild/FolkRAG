[TENTH PRECINCT STATION]
[*Patrolman D*][OCTOBER 9, 1942.]
[From: The Officer on the Beat in the Grand River-Joy Road
District.]
[*1.*] On October 7, 1942 at 8:50 a. m., at Joy Road and 
Grand River Avenue, a man described as an American, white,
about 45 years of age, 5' 8" tall and weighing about 150
pounds with brown hair and medium complexion, dressed in a
brown jacket and grey trousers was reading the Detroit Free
Press and made the statement to me that "President Roosevelt
had no intentions of opening a "Second Front" until he had
shucked all the money from the people. [He then walked east
on Joy Road.]
[*2.*] On October 8, 1942 at 2:00 p. m., at Joy Road and
Grand River Avenue, a man described as an American, white,
about 40 years of age and 5' 11" in height and weighing about
160 pounds with brown hair, grey eyes and medium complexion
dressed in a brown suit. He appeared to be a factory worker
on his way to work. He told me that a friend of his who is
a soldier stationed in Texas and who was in Detroit on furlough
at this time, told him that the Lockheed P-38 Interceptor plane
that is used by the Armed Forces was a coffin with wings on it,
stating that if anything went wrong with the plane the pi[o]lot
could not successfully bail out on account of the tail-assembly,
which would strike him or catch the parachute as he left the
plane. [This man boarded a Clairmount street car going west.]
