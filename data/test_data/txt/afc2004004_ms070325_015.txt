my life  It's too bad that this
is what I want to get inside.
It's because of all the young beautiful
girls.  I think if I were a
white slaver I'd be happy.
   I saw myself in the mirror tonight.
A huge head.  MOURNFUL
mouth.  Or else very ironic eyes
Fatty [T] [toorted?] in tone.  Flushed
with wine & food.  Soft.  Glowing 
Powerful.  Nobody like that face.
But disturbing not attractive.  Every
other young man in the room looked
like something you could get your finger
on.  But me -- oh hell.  Peculiar
Also just about but not quite
middle aged.
   I'll never find a woman this
way.  I'll go to the movie & then
take a Montmartre girl home.
