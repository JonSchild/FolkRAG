Dear Mr. Studebaker:

I have your letter of the 22nd about the Rumor
Project with which your office will cooperate
with the COI and ourselves.

I am glad that you have given your approval to
what sounds like a valuable project, and I want
to assure you that the Office of Facts and Figures
through its Bureau of Intelligence will give full
cooperation.

Faithfully yours,

Archibald MacLeish
Director, Office of Facts and Figures

Mr. J. W. Studebaker
