Sunday afternoon

Dear Ruby and Bro John
The New year has found 
me with my "thank you" letters 
unwritten.  Our Singing Country 
entertained me two afternoons
during the holidays and I 
am very very pleased to 
 have a copy.  I think you
both were thoughtful and generous
to remember me in this
way.  And I appreciate my possession.
The children came up
Tuesday before Christmas.  I had
 my house decorated with red
berries & evergreens and was
full of Christmas joy when
 they arrived. John got a  beautiful 
tree and put lights on 
the two arbor vitaes in the front 
of the house.  The little ones were 
a lot of fun and in their anticipation 
of Santa Claus.   We had our
turkey dinner with only ourselves
and Mr E  - Judith's father who 
drove up & stayed a short while
Christmas Day - John had to 
go back to Freer and the children
