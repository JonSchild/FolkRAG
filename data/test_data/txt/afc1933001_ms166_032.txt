particularly good children's song for the program.
3. Tecolote appears in the same publication as No. 1.
4. Adelita appears in a publication in sheet music printed in
Mexico City, copyrighted by Carlos Chavez Ramirez. Also in
sheel music by Enrigue Munguia Mexico, 1916, Jos. Stern, N.Y.,
1916.
5. Caporal borrachito, a commonly known folk guapango which I'd
very much like to use, but which I cannot find in any published 
source.
6. Alla en el rancho grande
7. La Cucarracha
8. Cielito lindo
9. Las Mananitas
10. La Golondrina
11. La Chachalaca
12. El Barrachito
13. El Perico
14. La Guacoma
All the above can be found in the same publication as No. 1.
That is, they appear in a government publication and are identified as
PD. These may be used if other parts of the program do not work
out. I believe that the singers know these because they are the commonest 
of Mexican songs.
D. Cuban.
1. Arena Cancreta
2. E' Legwa-ra-e
These are two Afro-Cuban voodoo songs which I'd very much like
to use. They cannot be found in any publication that I know of.
3. Anana boroco tinde by Miguelito Valdez seems to be a folk song, although
it appears to have just the text like the two above. I'd
like to use it too. 
4. Guajira guantanamero
5. Guajira guatanamo
6. Guajira guertanajera
None of these can be found in any publishedosources that I have
analized, although there are a few here on Cuban misic. A guajira 
appears to be the dance of the natives of Cuba and these are probably
folk or semi-folk songs based on the fundamental rhythm.
E. I could find nothing on the Argentine Songs. 
F. Nor the Puerto Rican Songs. 
Sincerely, 
Alan
