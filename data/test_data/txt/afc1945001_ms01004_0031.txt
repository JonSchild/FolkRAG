Rumor Project â€“ First Study

August 26, 1942

The period for our first Bureau study was August 3rd
through 15th. Surveys went into the field and did an intensive
rumor study in New Brunswick, New Jersey and Portland, Maine. The
original plan and involved formula was not closely adhered to, but
the spirit of the inquiry was retained with an emphasis upon rumor
content and community rather than rumor and the personality of the
individual.

For our nation-wide study, rumors were reported in by the
BPI men, the Polls staff, the Surveys staff, the Federal Security
Administration field offices, and the Librarians Panel. (We received
no cooperation from any staff which reported rumors current in
Washington, D.C.) Rumors flooded in. We received a total of about
ten thousand rumors.

The first batch of rumors reported on the basis of the
period August 3rd through 8th, were sorted by the people in Government
Sources Unit. Based upon their categories a few were selected
for further study by Special Services. Analysis of these categories
was made in terms of content themes. These themes were then turned
over to Media, Government Sources, and Enemy Sources, who are at
present trying to match themes against news and source material.

The analysis so far makes quite clear that it would be
futile to attempt a quantitative study of the present rumor material.
People's conceptions of rumor differed, they were not reported verbatim,
in different sections of the country different circles within
the community were tapped for the rumors, and at the present time there
is no comparable base from which a statistical evaluation would be
meaningful. Even the classifications by Sources cannot be satisfactorily
used, because of the way in which different states are represented
and the difficulties in establishing similarity of frame of
reference. This, however, represents a criticism of this particular
study and by no means a necessary criticism of this type of study. Further,
it is rather difficult to try an interpretation of the emotional tone
or significance of these rumors using terms like those of Allport's
(pipedream, anxiety, and wedge-driving,) because of the lack of context
which accompanies these rumors and the carelessness in giving verbatim
quotes.
