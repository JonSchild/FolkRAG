Mr. John A. Lomax,
Port Aranses, Texas.

Dear Mr. Lomax,
Yours in re cowboy singers, just
received, and if I can get four (4)
singers together to do some of the 
cowboy songs in Washington, I would
be interested - would our expenses
be paid? - Bill [Luby?] is now with
the Portland Cement Co, and is hard
to get, unless he could take his vacation
at that time. -
_ My idea of "authentic" rendition of a 
cowboy song is:- verses solo, and all
on the chorus. - I assume that the
more gifted cowboys invented new verses
during the day, and sang them in camp 
at night, and all joined in on the chorus.

You  gave no return address, so am
sending this to Port Aranses, and 
I hope it will reach you.
_ By the way, wouldn't you be eligible
to join the American Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers? Gene 
Ruck 30 Rockefeller Plaza is President.
ASCAP acts as a clearing house for
American Composers, Authors + Publishers.
_ My "Hills of Home" has yielded good
Royalties from that source - however,
not a fortune by any means. 
_ A soon as I hear form you further
(and before) I'll feel our some of my
old singers I used in the past. 
Best regards,
[Orea] [??]

P.S. Wish we could
get Tex Ritter to go - he was here recently.
