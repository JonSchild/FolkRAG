GARY:
The first time I come here to New York a fella by the 
name of Jim Long brought me up to make records. I don't mean
no harm mister you a white man, but let me say this, I dont
mean a bit of harm, I know how it evolved, But let me tell
the truth. Did you not know that the Negro act better
than the white man acting. (didn't get it)

LIONEL:
What was that?

LARRY:
You see everybody like the fool, you see.

GARY:
That you don't know what he ought
to get, you understand, the white man likes you better.

LIONEL:
Oh the bigger the fool he is. Oh yeah.

GARY:
You understand, he don't know what he ought to get, he
don't know what he ought to have, cause he don't have sense
enough to know. Even to take a woman [?] If a man got too much
sense you understand, she gonna fool that man, cause
she ain't gonn a get nothing out of it, he got too much sense.
You understand. She always looks for herself, before
she could rub her head aside a wall. You get plenty out of a
fool, but first you got to think you get nothing out of it.
