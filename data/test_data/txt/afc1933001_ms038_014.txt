SHEET NUMBER 2  THE MACMILLAN COMPANY

Mr. J.A. Lomax    8/18/36

I may also say that we are planning to increase the size of the book
considerably so that it will be a much more attractive volume.

In order to accomplish this and still price the book at even
as low a price as $3.50, it will be necessary for me to ask you to make
a certain concession in the matter of royalties. Will you be good
enough to agree to a royalty of 10% of the cash received for the first 1500 copies sold? The royalties will then revert to the regular 10% of 
the retail price. I hesitate to ask you to do this, but it is unfortunately 
necessary if we are to price the book at a reasonable figure
and I think that this is very important in view of the fact that the
book is now available at so low a price as $1.75. We ourselves are
making a considerable additional investment in the book and I can only
hope that you will be willing to share to a slight degree the risk involved.
I hope that this revision will make of the book a volume which
will continue to sell for many years to come.

Won't you be good enough to let me know your reaction to my
suggestion as well as to the type of revision which I have outlined?
Would you also tell me when it would be possible for you to have the
revised copy of the book? I might add that we are planning to reset
it  entirely.

Cordially yours,
James Putnam
Assistant to the President.
