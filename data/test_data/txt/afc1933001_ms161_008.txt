Mr. Alan Lomax
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax

Will you have any records of ballads which children would enjoy which
a library might borrow for a Ballad Hour during Book Week, November
10-16?  Would it be possible to secure the records early enough--
perhaps two weeks in advance--so that an hour could be arranged and
[*Sorry maybe later, not now*] given publicity in advance of Book Week? [*refer to your commercials*]

Is there any possibility that you will be in the Chicago area November 
10-16 and could give one or more talks on ballads to adults or children
at that time? [*No*]  Does the Carnegie Corporation Grant, or any other fund,
make it possible for you to give such talks without an honorarium or
with a very small one?

As you  may have seen by my letter in the "Post" section of the September
Bulletin containing your address, I am resigning my position with
the American Library Association September 30. For a few months I
expect to be at the Evanston Public Library working with their music
and art collection.  One idea I have in mind is to use Book Week, if
possible, as a time to call not only local, but if possible, national
attention to the music records which can now be borrowed from public
libraries by music lovers.  I would also enjoy giving your ballad collection
and work publicity if some of your records could be made part of
our plans.  There is a slight chance that I might interest Life magazine
in taking pictures of a ballad hour group of children which accounts
for the inquiry about securing records in advance of the Book Week program.

A few questions I have about the records are:

1. For what age group could a program be arranged?  (The
younger the better from my point of view). [*any?--*]

2. Could you suggest a group of records and the order in
which they might be played to make a delightful program
of an hour and a half, including, if possible, some
comments on the ballads and their origins? [*commercials or dups*]

3. Do you have written material to accompany the ballads
