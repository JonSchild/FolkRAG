like polished pieces of anthrcite.  And gay, my God, these women with
their huge baskets go shouting their wares down he streets like a
set of puppies at a new game.  And laugh.  .  This afternoon I leaned over
the fence and talked a little with a beautiful young man about thrity who
was building the house to which he [was] is going to bring his wife [wh] when
it [would] will be finished six months from now.  It consisted of a frame -work of
roof set up on some upright poles, that were[s] stuck perhaps three inches
into the earth.  He was engaged in weaving the walls out of split sticks---
the [it] twill pattern, if I remember my Lowie correctly.  When this task
is done, he will stuff the intercises with straw nd the plaster clay
over the outside.  One door, no windows.  Palm [tach] thatched roof.  He was
barefooted and stripped to the waist.  Soft gentle eyes and a smile like
a little white-cap on the sea when the ocean is blue and the day is fine
and a brisk little wind is stirring. ( I seem to have caught the [N] national
disease of Mexico, the craving for [linguistics?] diminutives; because I am
writing youI want to put [tia]-titatita at the end of all my words.)  I watched
Polines and found what I expected to appear on his face, a smile of pity
and contempt for anyone who would [be] " be so fool asto get marry an'
wuk hesef' to deat' for he woman an' when he come home he fin' her
gone to de bush wid oder man.  All I need woman for to wash my clo's.  I
do my own cook an' make my own bd.  When night come I go home an' fin'
my bed all cool an' lie down an' get me my good sleep out."  Polines' feeling, 
of course, is purely economic in origin.  He simply refuses to take 
on the burden of a woman and the children she'll litter the place with,
refuses to live [in] always in the same four by eight room with anybody and
never have any [c???] new clothes and never have a good night's private
rest without some woman heating up his bed and his body.  He, this [sme]
same Polines , who is my professor in Creole and in Haiti, my haggler and
my protector, my valet and my companion of all my journeys through the
world, told me this afternoon one of the funniest and cruelest and
and longest folk ales I have ever heard.  It was really three tales
Bouki , Ti Malice cycle bound into one.  It is pure Africa with a   
of shot-guns, ford-cars, police , presidents, etc., thrown in for good
measure.  Ti Malice is the national hero, Bouki, the [natonal] national
laughing stock.  Ti Malice is quiet, witty, shrewd, cruel, unscrupulous.
Bouki is just as cruel and unscrupulous, but naive, greedy beyond words,
dense, loud-mouthed, demonstrative, and gently or pasionately child-like.
in all his responses, as the case may be.  The tales [consist o] recount
how time after time Ti Malice robs [, cheats,] and cheats Bouki, causes him
to murder his wife and all his children, serve long terms in [jil] jail;
of how eah time Bouki , impotent with rage, comes back [for more] to kill
Malice and how Malie appeals to his greediness and [causes him to] plays
another horrible practical joke on the the None.  What is remarkable about
these stories is the amount of suffering gaily endured and the cruelty
of the clever people.  The primitive exploiter and exploited.  The first
wil[e]y, quiet, cruel and greedy; the other all back to be beaten, with guts
that simply won't wait to be filled.  There is one tale of how for example
Bouki fell into the syrup vat and refused to be pulled out and was found
the next morning turned into [brown sugar.] a lump of brown sugar.  . . It
may seem that I walk about with my eyes glued to peoples' faces, the
chancres on their legs, [not] on the earth; that's not true.  I have looked
so much at the sea and the flat smash of color, the folding hills, the
great bay changing color in the sun, the great shadows that are so [brillt]
brilliant as to be yellow, that I [feel I have] might have been a painter,
instead of a writer or a collector or whatever the hell I am.  But I have
forced myself here in this long scrawl to set down some of the people as
vividly as I could.  I hope I have not gone on so long as to bore you . . .
