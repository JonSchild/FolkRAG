TAPE 28. SEAMUS ENNIS, DUBLIN JAN. 14, 1950
Spanish Lady:
1) As I walked through Dublin City at the hour of twelve at night,
Who should I see but a maiden beauty combing her hair with a four-pronged pike.
Ta-ri-addle-i-do-di-do-di-do, ta-ri-addle-i-do-di-do-day. (2)
2) As I walked again through Dublin on the same or another night,
Who should I se but the same pretty maiden counting her cash by candlelight. (cho.)
3) Courting women is foolish folly and marrying women is just the same,
Courting women when they're not willing is like throwing water against a stream.

The Banks of the Roses
1) By the banks of the roses me love and I sat down,
And I took out me violin to play me love a tune,
In the middle of the tune, oh she sighed and she said,
"Aragh, Johnny, lovely Johnny, would ye leave me?"
2) O when I was a young man I heard me father say
That he'd rather see me dead and buried in the clay,
Rather than be married-o to any runaway
On the lovely sweet banks of the roses.
3) O I am no runaway, and soon I'll let them know
That I can take a bottle or can leave it alone,
And the man that doesn't like me can keep his daughter at home,
And young Johnny will go roving with another.
4) Repeat verse 1.
5) And if ever I get married 'twill be in the month of May,
When the leaves they are green and the meadows that are gay,
And I an my true love can sit and sport and play
On the lovely sweet banks of the roses.
6) Repeat verse 1.

The Old Man Rocking the Cradel.  Music
1) The other evening I chanced to go roaming,
Down by the clear river I joggled along,
I heard an old man making sad lamentation,
About rocking the cradle and the child not his own.
Chorus:
Ee-i-o, my laddie ly easy,
Perhaps your own daddy might never be known,
I'm weeping and weary with rocking this cradle,
and nursing the baby that's none of my own.
