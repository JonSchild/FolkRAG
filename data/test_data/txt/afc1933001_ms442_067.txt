Otherwise the detail of the ballad is finished. The [zxeking] feeling
for [language] swing and emphasis of [xxx] sentence is [of time] a
quality of greatness. The characters are stereotyped, but
developed with realistic [deta] detail. And the idiom is strong and
deftly [perfectly] fitted to the [scene] actors. [xxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
In our opinion, this is the finest
ballad of the Frankie and Albert set, one of America's half
dozen best.  It is Lead Belly's Ninth Symphony, - a ballad that
through him has become [opera] a small opera with stage directions, [and careful
instructions to the actors.]
