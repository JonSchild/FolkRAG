My dear Mr. Lomax:

    I sincerely appreciate your letter of May
seventh, telling me that you will support me in
this campaign for the Democratic nomination for
United States Senator.

    Your help will mean much to me and con-
tribute materially to the success of my campaign,
and I will be grateful for whatever you find it
possible to do in the furtherance of my candidacy.

    Thanking you, and with kind regards, I
remain

    Sincerely yours,
    Dan Moody
