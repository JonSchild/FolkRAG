MR. John A. Lomax
Port Aransas
Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thank you very much for you letter of February 8th to Mr.
Greene, which I am Acknowledging in his absence. Mr. Alan Lomax,
to whom Mr. Greene had sent a copy of his letter to you, very kindly
got in touch with us about it.

I know that your name was certainly mentioned on several 
occasions in the course of the programs on Negro music which Mr. 
Greene prepared. It is difficult to give you any indication of
which specific songs met with most favor, because, as you know,
several were included in each program. The numerous enthusiastic
comments we have received about this series referred to the program
as a whole, and I cannot recall any specific song which was singled
out. I shall keep this point in mind, however, and let you know of 
any specific comments we do receive. 

Mr. Greene will be grateful for your inquiry concerning some
particular type of song in which he might be especially interested.
As you probably know, he has hoped for some time to do a series of
programs on cowboy music, but this has now had to be indefinitely
postponed because of the pressure of other work.

I am sure Mr. Greene would love to join you on your trip through
the South. It is just the sort of thing he has always wanted to do.
His work here in New York, however, has never allowed him sufficient
time, and now, with the extremely heavy schedule we have on our hands,
it looks as though the chance of his being able to join you are not
very good. It is very kind of you to have suggested it.

Yours sincerely,
Annette [Ebsere?]
