A Flower From Mother's Grave

I've a casket at home that
Is filled with precious gems,
I have pictures of friends dear to me,
I have trinkets so rare
That came many years ago,
From my far distant home across the sea.
But there's one sweet little treasure,
That I'll always dearly prize,
Better far than all the wealth beneath the skies,
'Tis a small faded flower
That I plucked in childhood hours,
'Tis a flower from my angel mother's grave.

Chorus

Treasured in my memory like a happy dream,
Are the loving words she gave,
And my heart fondly clings to those dry and withered leaves
'Tis a flower from my angel mother's grave.

Whistle, whistle, daughter I'll get you a hen;
I cannot whistle, mother, if you should get me ten.
Whistle, whistle, daughter, I'll get you a cow;
I cannot whistle, mother, for I do not know how.
Whistle, whistle, daugher, I'll get you a man;
I cannot whistle mother but I'll do the best I can.
