         I said, "Clara, you. . .be able to. . .tell you that that man
liable to be lyin'"   Whew!   Sumpin' was all on me:  This is your
chance.  This is your chance, see?
         So I wen' on ov' to the house an'. . .Clo'es already packed.
You know.  'Cause I kep' 'em packed; I's jus' jus' got there not long,
ya know, an' I didn't never stretch 'em out 'cause I didn't know
when I may leave, or sumpin'.
         So.  I had a straighten' comb in the other girl's room.  I
went in there; I got [it] the comb.  I said, "I wanna straighten my
hair."
         She said, "All right."  So I went on in that day an' I
straightened my hair.
         Sho' nuf, in a few minutes he rolled up.  I heard him talkin'
to Georgie downstairs.  Said, "I'm gonna take them girls wi --
wit' me." 
         She said, "Oh!"  Said, "I say -- One of the girls got a job
for, for Monday."
         "Aw," said, "She have a better job than that."  Say, "You
know, you know me."
         Say, "Yeah," say, "You got 'em," say, "I ain' worry about
'em."  Said, "If they wanna go."  I heard all that.
         Come on up there an' he asked me, "You all girls ready to
go?"
         I said, "Yeah, le's go."
         Clara said, "I tol' you. . ."
         I said, "You [donn] dunno where this man goin'."  Ha, ha, ha!
I still stuck out for her!  "You don' know where he goin'."
