A (a poem) I used a poem in place of a story.
"Wake up America"

with a little winding stream.
Wake up america this is real not

Though how horrible a nightmare war
may seem.
Open your eyes and see what will
happen to liberty, if you don't do your
share. 
wake up america for the boys over there. 

Some have done more than their share
Some have helped with a little time and
money to spare. 
"You, with the "Big" Shot", and "Happy go lucky
air",
stop and think, and say I've got it to give
I'll buy Bonds and stamps to aid the boys
over there.
And their Dear ones happiness will be endless, 
when come home once more to live. 

"Wake up America" and see what is there to do,
there's plenty I know for you and you.
Can you see it? sure you can and you are
going to do something too. 
"You" who are grumbling about the ration, " now
aren't you ashame?
Because your president and Congress are really
not to blame.
So quiet Down America and see.
what you may do to hasten victory
