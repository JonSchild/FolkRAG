BJ TAPE 41, p. 3

     So I tol' Mama about it an' Mama say, " 'At make you a half-Christian!"
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Huh. Huh.  I lef' out from there. 
I was in there by myself, too, ya know, an' I already scared a
the house, ya see, an' I. . . 
AL:   Did you have to pay to see. . . ?
BJ:    No, ya didn' have to pay any.   Jus' a pitchur, 's in reg'lar a frame, 
like that, any other pitchur in a frame.   It's a man's pitchur, in a
frame.
AL:    He didn't [show it to] charge you?
BJ:    No, no.  He didn' [show it or] charge nothin'.  I don't know what he
would do when he carry it away from there, but he had it layin'
on this, ah, in his work room, in there.  An' I wen' in there an'
looked at it.
     An' I also, ah, ah, Elder, an' ar, uh, tsk, Solomon say he
wa' tryin' go git it over to me, sure enough.  It was a kinda
Christian pitchur.  Some kind of a pray, you know, peoples, fix
that picture up someway or other.  But if you's a Christian,
the, the eyes'll shut right down, an', ah, open.  Will e-e-ease open,
say they ease 'em  up. (?) An' if you's a sinner, the eyes'll 
shut real tight.  Some kinda test, I reckon, they got or sumpin',
in [they] their church.  Whatsover it is.
     But I, I'd sure like to git hold of one, I sure would. . . I
sure would.  I seed that myself.  But I'd like to know where they
made that thing in that (?).  But after all, I know it all come
[*(CALIFORNIA)*]
from California.  California the headquarter all that kinda stuff. . . 
Tha's right.
AL:   Wonder why that's true of California?
BJ:    Suh?
