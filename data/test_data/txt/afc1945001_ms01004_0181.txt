13. "Did you hear the report that the United States Navy 
did not sink that Jap aircraft carrier? I heard 
this is the fourth time the Navy has claimed to have 
sunk the same boat." (Alabama) 

14. "Why don't they tell us about the Aleutian Islands. 
Why don't they tell us about the rest of it. Our 
losses have been terrific. Somebody is making mistakes 
and now trying to cover it up." (Indiana)

15. "That the mainland of Alaska has probably been attacked 
but that the government is withholding information to 
the public." (Minnesota)

D. Pearl Harbor casualty repercussions great.

16. "I don't think the Government is giving us correct 
information as to what is actually happening. We 
know that things were much worse at Pearl Harbor 
than indicated. I think we American people can take 
it on the chin because we do not like to be fooled." 
(Utah)

17. "My godmother in Los Angeles told me this story about 
what happened to a friend of her next-door neighbor. 
It seems that she was notified that her son had been 
killed at Pearl Harbor. Then several weeks later the 
Government informed her that her son had not been 
killed but had been wounded. Then just a few weeks 
ago she was notified to meet a certain train on which 
her son would arrive. She and her daughter met the 
train but the son did not get off; they waited a 
short time not knowing what to do and were finally 
approached by an officer who took them to an ambulance 
in which was the son. He had lost both arms and both 
legs in the Pearl Harbor bombing. He was taken home 
and a week later the mother lost her mind and is now 
in a California insane asylum." (Arizona)

18. "The first comment came from an Omaha mail carrier who 
stops in the office once in a while to "visit". He 
is thoroughly reliable and very sincere, and often 
gives very representative opinion and comment. He 
said: 'People are becoming dissatisfied with the lack 
of information regarding the whereabouts of our boys 
in service. I have heard so many complaints from parents 
who have sons scattered to the four winds who are 
now either prisoners, or who have given their lives. 
I have a neighbor....a mother who gave her only son 
at Pearl Harbor....she waited for five months before 
she heard a word which finally came in form of an official 
death notification. During those five months 
she actually suffered so much anxiety that when the news 
did come, even though it was of his death, it was a 
welcome relief. Now, it seems to me the necessary 
official red tape clearance wouldn't have to take that
