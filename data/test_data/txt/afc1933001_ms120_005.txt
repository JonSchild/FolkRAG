April 1 1937 
My dear Mr. Secretary: 
Mr. Alan Lomax, of our staff, is now in Haiti collecting 
records of native folk songs and of the dances with which many of 
them are associated, and an understanding of which is necessary 
to the understanding of the songs themselves. 
The Department has already convenienced him by the issue 
of a special passport, and through the good offices of the American 
Minister at Port-au-Prince. 
In recording the dances a moving picture camera being essential, 
one was dispatched to him by us about a month ago. 
He reports however: 
(1) That in the absence of a representation from the Department 
the camera will be assessed and import duty; and 
(2) That some objections to the use of it - that is to say, the 
recording of the dances - is now being interposed by the Haitian 
authorities. 
He believes that the objection would be withdrawn upon a 
communication from the Department through the American Minister 
representing (a) that the purpose of the mission is purely scientific, 
being for the development of the Archives of Folk Song in the 
Library of Congress; and (b) that its official character justifies 
the interest of the Department in its success. 
------
As Mr. Lomax is near the conclusion of his stay in Haiti, 
only prompt action can serve the purpose. 
The Library will be happy to bear the expense of the transmission 
of it by cablegram or otherwise. 
With warm appreciation of such action as may be feasible, 
believe me, 

Faithfully yours, 

Librarian 
I venture to enclose a letter dated March 29 from Mr. Lomax 
with certain passages marked explaining the occasion. 

To the Honorable 

The Secretary of State
