Satisfied Subscribers Say

“I have only the highest praise for your service.
The simple operation if the plan, the excellent
character of my treatment at the hospital, and,
above all, the freedom from worry about the hospital
bill made my membership invaluable, and,
I am sure, contributed to my rapid recovery.”

“Better treatment could not have been asked for
regardless of price. I had a comfortable and cheerful
semi-private room.”

“During my recent illness I found that your plan
works with the utmost efficiency and a member is
not handicapped by unnecessary ‘red tape’ and
complications. I don’t believe I am capable of offering
any suggestions concerning the operations
of an organization which function as efficiently as
yours.”

“I wish to take this opportunity to thank you for
the pleasant and efficient manner in which your
organization operates.”

“I consider membership in the group hospitalization
very worthwhile, especially to the low-income
person, to whom such an illness might otherwise
mean a financial strain and hardship, as well as
mental strain retarding recovery.”

“It is incredible that an undertaking of its size
and nature could function so perfectly smooth.”

“I greatly appreciate the wonderful service your
hospital group was to me. I was treated with the
utmost care-day and night-and can never praise
your wonderful organization highly enough.”

“It is my opinion that the group hospitalization
plan is a most worthy undertaking and one that
fills a much needed want for all classes. It should
have the support of all persons, regardless of their
station.”

“I would like to give praise to the mind or minds
that conceived and worked up such an idea.”

“The operation of the plan was entirely without
technicality or confusion. I have not a single suggestion
that I believe would improve the operation
of the plan. My experience leads me to believe
that it is not possible of improvement.”
