The Cajun music - it's sharing of the people here, because
like we all know it didn't matter the color of the skin, it 
mattered what kind of person you are. Nowadays, it's a 
completely different thing. In those days, a man was as
good as his word, and obviously Dennis' word, Amadie's 
words, and Sady's words were true and just.
