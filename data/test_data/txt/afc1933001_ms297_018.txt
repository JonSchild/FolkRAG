JACK POT HIT 
Children Raid Place as 
3,000,000-Pound Pile 
Is Found. 
     Hanover, Mass., June 27. -(AP)-
Discovery of 3,000,000 pounds of 
scrap rubber, which transformed 
this normally quiet, rural community 
into a "boom town reminiscent 
of the gold rush days," was 
reported today by the Massachusetts 
salvage committee. 
     The committee said that the 
rubber - "literally acres of it" - was 
found on the site of the abandoned 
Clapp Rubber Company, which sold 
its machinery and wrecked its 
buildings in the days when there 
were "limitless crude rubber supplies 
and there was no market for 
scrap." 
     There apparently is enough 
scrap, the committee added, to 
meet Massachusetts's entire quota 
under President Roosevelt's salvage 
program. A survey by David Lundquist, 
war production rubber specialist, 
indicated a considerable 
quantity was very valuable.

one of its employees, an oil company 
undertook the task of carting 
it away but hundreds of residents, 
including enterprising children, 
had the same idea, and the 
company turned over the project 
to the salvage committee. 
     The "mine" is located on the 
same site where the first plow in 
the United States and the anchors 
of the historic frigate Constitution, 
now enshrined at the Boston navy 
yard, were forged. 
     "Word of the rubber mine spread
through the town like wildfire," 
the committee reported. "Hanover
children raided the place and carried 
away hundreds of pounds to 
the nearest gasoline stations for a 
penny a point." 

Stations Overloaded. 
     When the committee stepped in 
it obtained options on some of the 
rubber, but allowed owners, who 
refused options, to sell the scrap 
on their land. They were not allowed 
to remove it, however, until
