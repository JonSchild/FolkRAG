Blues--- Send down Your Hand


Notes taken during rendition of the song:

[*9*] There's no 'way of tellin' what a woman will do,
I just want to know what makes you do me like you do.

Everything I told you , you run and told your man,
?

Worked all las' summer an' all las' fall,
Come gome an' took my Christmas in my overalls.
( Was cold down there , too.)
