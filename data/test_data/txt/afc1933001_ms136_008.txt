Attention: Mr. C. Kaldor
My dear Mr. Kaldor:
Please permit me to introduce Mr. Alan Lomax of
the Folklore Department of the Library of Congress, Washington
D.C. As I told you over the telephone this afternoon,
your associate Mr. Himmeler, whom I met at the
Hungarian Foundation Banquet, assured me of his cooperation
with the Federal Writers' Project in our work on Folklore
and Racial Groups.
Will you please, in Mr. Himmeler's absence from the
city, extend the courtesies of your office to Mr. Lomax.
He is doing valuable work in Folklore, and any aid you may
give him, will be of service also to Hungarian-Americans.
Thanking you in advance for any courtesy you may show
Mr. Lomax, we are

Sincerely yours,
J. D. Newsom,
State Director
Federal Writers' Project
