And Old drag from down the road

Last night as I lay in the saloon.
I look at the card and the dice.
I wonder if ever a dragman.
Would talk any sence or advice.
Chors
Roole on Rolle on Rolle on you
dicers Rolle on Rolle on
Rolle on Rolle on Rolle on
you dices Rolle on

I wonder if ever a dragman.
Make Ready for that Judgement 
day.
And say to the boss of the salloon,
I am Ready come drive me away.
Chore
Rolle on
