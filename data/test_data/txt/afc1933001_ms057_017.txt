Mr. John A. Lomax
University Station
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have ordered the additional needles for you and they
should reach you soon.

Your report is very encouraging indeed and I am anxiously
looking forward to the opportunity of hearing about it from you
personally.

The batteries were shipped by our mail division and I presume
emptied by them. Perhaps the express company insists on
this. But at any rate I am glad to hear that they are working
again.

I only receive very sketchy reports from Alan. In fact I
feel that I must talk to him about this when he next comes to
Washington.

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
