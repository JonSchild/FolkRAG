A Memorandum
From: Alan Lomax                          November 19,1940
To: Dr. Spivacke

Dear Dr. Spivacke:
It is very important for the Archive of American Folk Song that 
the W.P.A. continue its present helpful practice of cataloguing 
new records as they come into the Archive. I understand that Sidney 
Robertson is shortly to deposit a group of two hundred additional 
records made in California with W.P.A.  help, but before these records 
can be accessioned and catalogued, two other groups of records 
must be so treated:

1. Recordings made by Todd-Sonkin in California under Library 
sponsorship and in cooperation with the Farm Security Administration.
i
2. Recordings made by John A. Lomax in the south, partly with 
the help of the W.P.A Music Project in Alabama.

This work preliminary to the Sidney Robertson records include approximately 
two hundred-fifty 12in. discs. If we would make an 
estimate of the number of records to be so treated within the next 
year, a conservative guess would be about a thousand. I would greatly 
appreciate your giving this your immediate attention since work in 
the Archive is  being seriously hampered by this delay.
