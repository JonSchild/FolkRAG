LOMAX       Did they have guns with them?
 
HARDIN      Well yeah, they had their guns all
the time.  They, they always had their guns.  In them times
anybody you'd see, they'd have a rifle or gun, way back in
them times, yeah.  Everybody had a gun.

LOMAX       Now, Earl, when you were a kid, 
did they have very many outsiders coming through here?   It
was kind of hard, wasn't it? 

HARDIN      No. 

LOMAX       When the road first come over
here, you were a little boy when it first. . .no, heck, I
guess you were pretty. . .

HARDIN      No, that, that road was a, I was
building a, working on that road when the oil drill come, 
was building that between Grand [UNCLEAR].
 
LOMAX      [Peacan]

HARDIN     Yeah, yeah. 

LOMAX      But the road in the other
direction was already here. 

HARDIN      Yeah, it was already, just a
couple years, just a couple years. 

LOMAX      Why don't you tell me about how
that happened.  You told me one time about the storm when it
hit.   Would you tell me that story again, [UNCLEAR]?

HARDIN      Yeah. We come, that morning we
milked the cows, me and the boys.   And we had breakfast and 
everything.   And we put dry clothes in and I got in the bed.
