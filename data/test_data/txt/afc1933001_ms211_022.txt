Dear Alan:

For your birthday I'd
like for you to spend this
Ten Dollars for shirts and ties
or something else intimate
and personal. Miss Terrill
said a Phi Beta Kappa Key.
I feared you would never
wear it.

I guess I feel discouraged
over you as a correspondent.
Not yet do I know
what you bought from me
