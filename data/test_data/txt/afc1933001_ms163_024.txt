Dear Alan:-

This is to remind you of your promise to
send me pronto the picture negatives that were taken of
your song hunting expeditions. Please get them off to
me now while you still remember it.

I am taking up with our Washington people
the advisability of pictures of the Golden Gate boys
on the broadcast next Tuesday.

Thanks very much,

With best wishes,
Roger Starr

Mr. Alan Lomax

PLEASE SEND THE NEGATIVES
DIRECTLY TO ME.
