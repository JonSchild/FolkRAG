1. Victory.
Buy War Bonds and Stamps,
To beat the worst tramps,
Who say we're the master race,
If you do your part,
From the bottom of your heart,
We'll throw victory in their face.

2. Triumph.
Bring in scrap & tin,
Yes, pitch everything in.
Do your part to win the war,
Then let's fight to the end,
Let's win victory again
And triumph the "War God" Thor.
