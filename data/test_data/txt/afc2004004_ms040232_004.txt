Dear Mr. McCormick

It is kind of you to take so much time to write.
I am sorry that your conclusions are so
discouraging but I feel sure that the collector
who visits Galloway and digs really deep will
find plenty of good material. It so happens
that on the kind of trip I am making I have no
time to make this kind of intensive collecting.

I chanced to meet one fine tinker singer in
Buchan and I left his records with Edinburgh
University. His name is Jimmy Macbeth, in case
you are ever interested to hear them. The 
Folklore Institute and Edinburgh University
will undoubtedly get into Galloway and do the
job which I can't do.

Any way, thanks for your cordial letter.
Sincerely yours

(Alan Lomax)
