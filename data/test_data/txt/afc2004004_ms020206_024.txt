Reverend Roe.  Reel 3.  P.5
was preaching here some time ago one night, and I don't know, I just 
got lifted up, and the people come up there [and] to sit me down, [on the stool] stop me.  
I hadn't been preaching [there] unusually long, but the people begun to 
shout, you know, and go[ing] on.  And I've seen on [some] several occasions when they 
stop the preacher, when the people just get shouting and going, you know, and 
they [just] have to stop [the preacher] him and sit him on down so they could keep [it] the 
people quiet or they'd hurt one another. 
But I believe this emotionalism, some call it, but now I don't know about 
that, when the Holy Spirit came down on the Disciples, on the day of Pentecost, [they began to] they was
[calls, they's gotten up on the table] cutting' up terrible, they said they's drunk, they drunk 
on the wine, drunk on the wine (laughter) 
A: Hadn't had any wine.
R: Hadn't had any wine! and they wasn't have any 
saloons. So they's something to it, there's something to it. I believe
the spirit of God gets on, and [t]here's another thing about it: 
you may doubt some things and be afraid of some things; but when that 
spirit gets on you, it makes you bold. You'll just go on and say it, 
 that's all if it's the truth.  And you [know this] notice it was so with the Disciples; it was 
so with Daniel; it was so with the Hebrew children.  That's something 
got on, and the faith of God held them up, and they talked and they 
stood up. They put [their lives there] um in the lion's den & in the fiery furnace, [it] but that didn't
change them. Their [face] faith was so firm in the God they believed in until 
the lion didn't bother them, the fire didn't burn them--yes, sir, so 
there must be something to it.
A: Well, there is something to it.
R: There must be.  I know one thing; it has brought me a long ways.  I know I have nothing
 behind me to help me; I didn't have no college education.  What little I 
had, I just picked it up along, [weren't much] 3 months schooling, you know I 
couldn't -a have learned much.
A: That old Irishman.  
[R:] He told my father I was the best scholar he ever had and that's all 
he'd done was to teach school.  You ought to send that boy to school.  That's what he told my father. When 
I learned to read, I could read.  I'd just pick up any book and read after I learned it--
