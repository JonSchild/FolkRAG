all right. 
A: Have you had any Mexicans working on this site there? There are a lot of them out in Texas, I know. 
B: No, nothin but colored. I worked them a little bit out in 
Topeka, Kansas, when I laid the new rail out through there on the 
way to Atchinson?, Kansas, I mean, to Amorailla, Texas. But I believe that was in '38, '38 or ' 7, it slipped my remembrance now,
exactly which one, when I worked for the gang out there. 
A: How'd you get started incthe railroad business? Your rather 
before or any **
B: No Sir. I left home. My father died when I was a youngster; 
my father died when I was eight years old, and after my father 
died, why, I didn't want another man to be over me, and I walked off and go on to my brother's -- I had a brother named Rod Bedley, 
stayed in Memphis, Tennessee. I come one down and stayed with him. And so a man named W.M. Baum?, he picked me up, and after he 
picked me up, say, "Boy, don't y u want to go with me?" 
I say, "I don't know, sir; where you goin?" So he say, "I could 
let you drive a water wagon, pay [f]your five dollars a week. I do better t[h]an that; I give you a dollar and a half a day. Come on and 
go with me." "I canâ€™t  do n[i]othin." "Oh yes you can." So I went with him; he had a levee camp up there in WOlf River Bottom, I don't know whether you know Wolf River Bottom?.
He was my Toby, and I'd just get him and set him in the house when 
I was gamblin, and I'd win. 
A: Give me a notion of some ofthe jobs that go on when you play in 
Georgia camps. 
B: Well, it's l ike why you'd say hold it, a dollar mo. Say hold em,
