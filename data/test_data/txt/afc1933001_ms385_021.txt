One morning more than twenty years ago I got a call to come to the office of President Mezes of the University of Texas.  I was then acting as his Secretary, an office I had filled for President Winston and President Prather, two of his predecessors.  When I came in, President Mezes presented me to a gentleman I had never before met, Colonel Bill Sterett of the Dallas News.

"Colonel Sterett is in Austin," said Dr. Mezes, "to write a series of articles on the University of Texas.  I want you to go with him, show him everything he wishes to see, introduce him to our celebrities.  You can defer all your duties as long as the Colonel is around."

"Everything will be new to me," said Colonel Sterett, "for I have never before set foot on the University campus.  I have worked in the Capital for months at a time; I have even lived in Austin while I was Game and Fish Commissioner; but I have always fought shy of the campus.  I am just a freshman."

Then followed three exciting days for me.  While we swapped tobacco, Colonel Sterett told me stories.  I listened pop-eyed and open-mouthed.  If he ever took a note on his University investigations, I never saw him.  Our visits to University professors only constituted fresh and approving audiences for the Colonel's delightful monologues, punctuated by shouts of laughter from the startled pedagogues.  This, his first and last visit to the University, was a remembered visit, and it is still talked of.  Colonel Steret is gratefully recalled too,
