    I recommend that the Library authorize Mr. John A. Lomax to
set out on a recording expedition for the Archive of American
Folk-Song. In addition to the loan of a recording machine, Mr.
Lomax should receive mileage and per diem allowance.

    According to the estimates furnished by Mr. Lomax, the fol-
lowing will be the approximate sums necessary for the trip:

    3550 miles at five cents per mile    $177.50
    50 days at $5. per day    250.00
    200 blank discs    150.00
    Miscellaneous expenses (needles, etc.)    25.00
    $602.50

These expenditures are to be charged to Increase.

    Chief, Division of Music
