Dear Dr. Archibald:

Thank you very much for your comments on our Check-List, and
for your information about the Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial
Library. Our supply of copies of the Check-List is very nearly
exhausted; nevertheless I expect to send one to that Library when
our small final mailing goes out in a few weeks.

Our office has had a rush of work in the last month, and I
must apologize for the delay in handling your order for ballad
records. I am sorry to tell you that six out of the fourteen
versions you have asked for are under restriction: that is, we
may not duplicate them without express permission of the collectors.
If you wish, we will open correspondence to obtain such permission,
giving full information about the uses to which the records would
be put. I presume, however, that you will prefer to avoid this 
delay, since your purpose is to provide simply a "sample" of the 
Archive's work.

The cost of duplication for the eight remaining songs*will
be $2.50. This covers the two 12-inch, double-sided disks, and the 
packing cost, but not the shipping cost; they will be shipped to
you express collect. Upon receipt of your check to the Librarian
of Congress, these records will be sent you without further delay.

I imagine you realize that the conditions of our recording
work do not produce uniform quality such as may be expected from
the records listed in a commercial catalog. For example, of the 
"Lady Isabel" versions you will receive, number 1735A is complete
and clearly sung, and 1746A2 is nearly as good; the others are some-
what marred by incompleteness, acoustical distortion, or extraneous 
noise. Yet each has its own particular interest.

I am sure you know that our duplicates are released for edu-
cational use only; the Memorial Library will, I know, protect them 
from publication or any commercial use.

We have recently arranged to copy a number of French Canadian
records from the collection of Marius Barbeau at the National
Museum in Ottawa. No doubt you are familiar with his work.

I hope you will be pleased with your records, and that we
may serve you again in the future.

                                                                          Archive of American Folk Song
