Roll 61 Stan and Hattie 2

(Stan) them, they'll about smell you to death! You'll just have to throw all
your clothes away. I've had 'em in my eyes, and all, it's terrible you know!
Some of 'em call it "skunkin' on you." That's what they do, they're very
stinky. They're very bad, you don't want to get too close to 'em. So I"ll
put him away down here..... Now, right here is an elk, his head, it's not the
whole body, I just looked (?) him in the woods. This is his nose, you see here.
And up here is his antlers, right in here. So this antler here, it didn't grow
out very good. And now this is a (evil) side you are looking at there. ANd
so I'll turn it right around, very slow, and you can see the other side, you
see it's eyes there and all, that's the good side of it. And they don't have too
many of these in this country, there used to be you know, and that's the reason
they call it "banter's elk," that's where them elks is at. So I'll put him down
here. Right here is a very nice duck, we used to raise ducks and all. This
is his bill, and that there... They've hens and they've drakes...this one here
looks like a hen to me I take it. So that there is nice, I'll turn him right
around so you can get him here, get the whole shot of him, but he's a real nice
duck. We used to raise 'em, and he's got a little knot in his head there and
I'll put him away now right down there.... This right here, we just call 'em
findits(??) but they call him graffs(?) anymore. And this is a rooster, and
you see this top right on his head right there. A hen don't have this up here.
This is his tail back here, right there. This is one of his wings, and I"ll
turn him around very slow and you can see the other one. You can get him
right in his breast there you see. A lot of people hunts for 'em. So he's
 a very nice graff(?), I think he's beautiful myself. I'll put him down....
The next one comin' up here, this is my kitty kat. You can see, this is his 
leg stickin' out here, that's one of 'em, little short, but that's one, and
here's one. And back here's his tail. I'll turn him around very slowly and
