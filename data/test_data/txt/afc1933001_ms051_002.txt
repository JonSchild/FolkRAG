Dear Mr. Lomax: -

I have just dug through the accumulations
since returning from Hawaii to your gift of the
Check-list of folk-songs on discs that have
accumulated in the Archives of America Folk-Song
up to November 1936.

Please accept my thanks for the list and my
congratulations upon such an achievement. I look
forward to seeing the revised and enlarged list
which you promise for the future. But will
you please address this to Mr. George Dickinson
(Professor) who is at the head of the Music
department here and much interested in the subject
of folk music. Did you meet him when you were
with us? I turn over the musical publications
which come to me for his library in the music
building where they are available for students in
music. The future of folk art in this institution
has its best chance in his hands after my own
retirement.

Please remember me to Alan, whose enthusiasm
for folksong must make you feel that you have not
lived in vain. And accept my thanks for the
valuable publication.

Sincerely yours,
Martha Beckwith
