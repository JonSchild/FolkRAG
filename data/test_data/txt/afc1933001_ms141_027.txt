Dear Mr. Lomax:
Mrs. Umble and I are as much at sea as you seem to be as to why Mr.
Bontrager and Mr. Eash refuse to make more recordings.  Perhaps if 
I tell you a little experience we had at the Amish church recently,
it will hep you understand some of the difficulties we encounter
in securing first-hand information about our Amish friends.  At the
close of Sunday services which my son and I attended, a number of
men came to the part of the room where we were sitting and engaged us
in a conversation something like the following.
   "You are welcome," the chief hymn leader said, "to com to our
services provided your motives are good.  But you are not welcome if 
you are planning to put our hymns on the radio.  We would like to know
why you want them and why you are interested in them."
   I assured him that we had no intention of broadcasting them over
the radio and that we were interested in them because we considered
them beautiful and because they were unlike any other music that we
knew.
   "But what will you do with them after you have them?  You can't
learn them in the first place, and if you could you wouldn't use
them in your church service, so we see no reason why you would be 
interested in them unless you want to put them on the radio for the
World to scoff at."
   I tried to assure him again that we had no such purpose and that 
our only reason for being interested in them was that we consider them
beautiful and worthwhile.
   "But," they insisted, "that man who was here did put them on the
radio."
   "No,' I said.  "You are entirely mistaken.   They have never been
broadcast and I am sure that he has no intention of doing so.  He is
interested in collecting all types of church music and other music and
keeping it at the Library of Congress, just as we do rare and valuable
books."
