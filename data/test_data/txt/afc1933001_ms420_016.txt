Some specimens from Levermore's Songs of Loyalty and Fraternity


EACH FOR ALL

I said it in the meadow path,
I say it on the mountain stairs,
The best thing any mortal hath
Are those which ev'ry mortal shares.

The grass is softer to my tread
For rest it yields unnumbered feet,
Sweeter to me the wild-rose red
Because it makes the whole world sweet.

And up the radiant peopled way
That opens into world unknown,
It will be life's delight to say
"Heaven is not Heaven for me alone."

Rich through my brother's poverty?
Such wealth were hideous! I am blest
Only in what they share with me,
In what I share with all the rest.


GOD OF THE NATIONS NEAR AND FAR

God of the nations near and far,
Ruler of all mankind,
Bless thou thy people as they strive
The paths of peace to find.

The clash of arms still shakes the sky
King battles still with king,
Wild through the frighted air of night
The bloody tocsins ring.

But stronger far the clasped hands
Of labor's teeming throngs
Who in a hundred tongues repeat
Their common creeds and songs.

Oh father, from the curse of war
We pray Thee give release;
And speed, O speed Thy blessed day
Of justice, love and peace.
words by John H. Holmes

so good, not so good!
