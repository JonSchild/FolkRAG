Dear Mr. Lomax:
Do you recall the telephone conversation I had with
you regarding square dancing when in Roanoke?
We are planning a square and round dance at the
Roanoke County Woman's Club on Saturday night, November
2nd, and since you are interested in this type of music
and dancing, I wish to extend the invitation to you and
anyone else you may wish to bring with you to attend this
dance.
In case you may wonder who will play for us,
you may have in your file, the Roanoke Jug Band Recordings
and they will appear in person for us. Some of the
players are not with them now as a few changes have
been made, they have the fiddler though.
Won't you let me know if you can arrange to
be our guest at this dance and how many will be
with you as we serve a buffet supper at midnight.
We have been having these dances at the
club for about five years, with perfect order
and some really good dancers.
The dance starts at 9-to- 12, with men wearing
business suits and ladies either in evening clothes,
nor formal of course, or street clothes.
May I expect you?
Mrs. Billy Altizer
