up to the spring house over and put that in there and he just had a 
box made outta boards.
 
AL:   I think we ought to go on.    . . .                      Let's do that little
bit about the crop over here, about taking care of your land.

RH:   OK.

AL:   Ask them to come see your garden.

RH:   Yessir.  We'll go on out here now and look at my garden out
thissa way.  And, uh, now this is--

    (I'm sorry, can we do that one more time.  . . .     Just again "I'll
show you my garden.")

RH:   I'll show you my garden now right, right out here, down here
is my garden.   I raised, I worked in this  . . .                of just about--

a bit of fertile on [along] that of the garden there that corn there
that's corn.  It ain't sweet corn, it's, it's the bird corn we call it.
And I raise that now without any fertile; it's raised with . . .

tree stump dirt and throw it in the bulk of the rows, and the ashes
eats that up and gives it fertile.  And so they was some wouldn't

it at all only just burnt ashes out of the hard wood.    Like   they
used to live with the land, they call it.   And the way I started off-
I was born in 1922, the 29th day of this month, my birthday just passed
a few days ago.    And so that is the way they lived with the land.  And
I remember in this mountain, and they'd say "you too young."  But . . .
