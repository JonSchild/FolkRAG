Prelude, opus 18  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  CÃ©sar Franck
     Franck, the great Belgian composer, was deeply religious. Loftiness of purpose, 
nobility of character and innate goodness are all revealed in his writing of many 
stately, prayerful melodies. This Prelude is from the "Prelude, Fugue and Variations," 
and has been masterfully arranged for piano by the eminent pianist, Harold Bauer.

Preludes -- opus 28  .  .  .  .  .  .  Frederic Chopin
     Had he written nothing but these Preludes, Chopin would have been entitled 
to the first rank of musical genius. Most of these gems were composed during his 
sojourn on the island of Majorca. They are outbursts of passionate melody combined 
with contrasting moods of gaiety and sadness.

                                                V.
How Beautiful Is Night  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Cyr de Brant
     Cyr de Brant, a member of the Catholic clergy of New York City, has published 
numerous choral works in various styles. The rhythmic and harmonic freedom of this 
atmospheric reverie is in keeping with the modern musical trend.

Dance of the Gnomes  .  .  .  .  .  .  Edward MacDowell
     MacDowell, generally regarded as our greatest American composer, found vocal 
part-writing a grateful medium. This example is a bit of description in an elfin, 
"scherzando" mood.

Sweet Little Jesus Boy  .  .  .  .  .  .  Robert MacGimsey
     A devout southern tune heard in Louisiana.

Cindy  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  David Malin
     "Cindy" is a Kentucky mountain ballad from the Kincaid collection.

                                                 VI.
Black-Eyed Susie  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Marshall Bartholomew
     The tune and text of this North Carolina mountain "folk fancy" were collected 
by Susannah Wetmore Nye.

Beautiful Dreamer  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Stephen Foster
     Many of Foster's graceful, spontaneous melodies have become America's folk-songs. 
This serenade was the last song he wrote.

A Spirit Flower  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Louis Campbell-Tipton
     Campbell-Tipton, although an American, made his home in Paris from the age 
of twenty-four until his death. This is by far his best-known song--a delicate arabesque 
of melody in keeping with the beauty of the words. The arrangement is by Riegger.
