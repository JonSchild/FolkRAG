MARCH OF THE FARMERS AND WORKERS

In mine and in factory
By farm and inland sea
The farmers and the workers
Say "No" to tyranny
Bernard and Elmer Benson
Shall guard Democracy.

2. Bernard, yes, and Benson
Have kept the ledge they swore
The Steel Trust and Power
Should rule our State no more.
And to the common people
Stands wide the State-House door.

3. Let Hearst and his cronies
Shout Red until they crack
His Charley McCarthys
Can go sit on a tack.
We've had our fill of stooges
And we don't want them back.

4. The Fords and the Duponts
The Lords of Iron and Steel
Have banded together
Against the common weal.
Against Bernard and Benson
Defending our New Deal.

5. In mine and in factory
By farm and inland sea
The farmers and workers
Say "No to tyranny
Bernard and Elmer Benson
Shall guard democracy.
