BJ TAPE 12, P. 9

An' she said another thing. Said, "If we be separated like
this sometime, if anything should happen, it won't go so hard."
An' that's true again, ya know? It sho' is true
AL: It was a sweet letter, wasn't it?
BJ: Yeah. I said to myse'f she had mo' sense than me. Much
more. Heh, in my [life! But] mind so I always keep that on my min'. I [S]said that is
[it's] the truth. I think of that sometimes when I git to studyin'
about the chilren home. You know, [S]since I been away? I get to thinkin'
about [that] the lil' -- I don't mean them big ones -- the lil' -- talkin'
about -- I'm talkin' about the big ones, too, but [especially] talkin' 'bout 
the lil' bitty ones. Now, that's they children, but I'm 'tendin'
'em like was mine (pretending?? - tending to them??). I said,
"You know, they's, they's chilren born in the world ain't got
no parents, [If] An' they were with their parents, why should you
worry?" [The longest]  No laugh'n this mornin' when I sayin' my prayers. Don't have to
worry about nothin' like that. Don't think about it, wonderin'
what they doin' this mornin'. [What did] Won'er if they eat? They gonna
eat. God's gonna make 'em feed 'em...An' so, that's it.
AL: Bessie, did it worry you when your girl began to be interested
in boys and going out? Did that bother you?

BJ: Hum-um. No. Nev' bother...I never liked no boy, nohow.
AL: Hum?
BJ: Never, that ain't nothin' to bother about. That ain't nothin',
to me, hah, you know. Jus' -- what I mean -- it jus' ain't nothin'
to be bothered about. Hones' it ain't. That, that's true. It
jus' ain't nothin'. A lot of people hear me say that, they think
I just kiddin', but I sure ain't jokin'. They watch the smoke,
they see where the fire [is] at. I sure don't, it don't worry me.
That's the true. It's just all right...It ain't, it ain't today
