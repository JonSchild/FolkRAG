Gèdè, aussi:

"Puel, Koko plus grand; zozo dit l'ap
rentrer ça mander."

This often some serious loi songs; in a group,
R.P. imitating the nasal-voiced Gèdè perfectly;
Camille, a 14 yr old boy, a little
high-brown from PP who had lived with
a white marine; another boy 

R.P. 1st Nov. Gèdè climbs tree & stands on 
a tiny dry limb & dances and sits, calls
for money, swallows it, next morning
finds money under pillow, Reiser can
do it too...
