678 46th Street
Des Moines, Iowa

Dear Mr. Thompson:

Forgive me for not having answered your
letter until now. I have been out of town and not been able
to get to it. You can find the material you are interested in
these three books:

The Voice of Haiti, Laura Bowman
Clarence Williams New York Publication Co. 1938

Haiti, by Harold Conrlander
University North Carolina, Pres.
Chapel Hill, N.C. 1939
Meringues Populaire Haitiennes, New York, 1920.

We have excellent records from Haiti, about
300 of them made there in 1933. Practically all of these show
a mixture of French and Negro influence. A copy of one of these
for your program might be just the thing, because I doubt if you
can get a good performance of this difficult music within a week,
or if at all. These records can be purchased from us from the
Photo duplication division at $2.00 each. Their is also an album
called Voodoo, which consists of Hatian songs recorded from natives
living in New York City. These records are quite acceptable, and
the album can be obtained by you for your assembly, with all convenience.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
