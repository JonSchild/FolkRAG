September 17, 1946

Dear Alan:

I hope that the following information can be of use:

1. Skippy Adelman was the photographer of the Korson recording
project, and he can be reached through Harper's Junior Bazaar.
Ultimate approval for use of the pictures will probably have to come
from Black Starr which handled the deal.  You might call them directly.

2. Our activity here has been fairly broad.  You may wish to
list recording projects in New Mexico, Utah, Puerto Rico, Mexico,
Brazil, Oklahoma, Canada, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Virginia, Cuba, Pennsylvania, among others.  Incidental material wanders
in from Montana, Illinois, etc., but not in quantity to deserve much
mention.

3.  The collections are hitting the 9,000 mark so that if you
use that figure, it will certainly be accurate by the time your article
appears.

4.  The enclosed General Order will give you a good idea of the
Librarian's attitude towards the subject and the broad way he visualizes
its future.

5.  I haven't called you because I haven't been in New York.  I
hope to have a car this week and will probably be on a commuter's
schedule with it.  I certainly shall call when I hit town.

6.  In your letter you mention Scribner's.  My recommendation was
to Doubleday.  You ought to see Burt Hoffman at Dial Press.  He
can give you a fairly quick yes or no.  If it's a yes, the firm is a
good one to deal with.  I've mentioned you to him, and you can use my
name.  We were overseas together and know each other well.

Best to you.  I'll be in New York within the next two or
three weeks.

Sincerely yours,

Duncan Emrich
