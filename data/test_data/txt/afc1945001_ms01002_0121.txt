magazine and newspaper editors.  At the present time, some of the
best rumor columns represent public service by newspapers; nevertheless,  
the rumor column must be coordinated with the total
program of the rumor-control project and the direction must be 
from the broader perspective of the project directors.

It seems wise for rumor-control projects to be organized 
somewhat as follows:  They should be headed by a Project Director
in whom is centralized responsibility for the total program.  He
should function with the services of a General Advisory Council.
The General Advisory Council should include representatives of
the city government; specialists responsible for the security of
information made available; representatives of all minority groups,
civic and service clubs,  and other important segments of the community;  
and such technical experts as educators,  psychiatrists,
psychologists, sociologists, social service workers, and journalists.

There should be a Research Director responsible for the
collection and analysis of rumors.  He should work through a staff
of Field Reporters and Analytical Assistants.  There should be an 
Educational Director responsible for the development of the total
educational program.  The Educational Director should have available 
and Advisory Council of Specialists in the various media for
developing informational programs, representatives of social welfare 
agencies of the community, and officers guaranteeing security
of information.  There should also be such staff assistance as
experience demonstrates is necessary.
