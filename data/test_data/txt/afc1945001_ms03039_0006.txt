given it lots of advertising, therefore, people seen inclined to 
think this again is repetition. In fact, this was called to our
attention three different times in making our requests for this
assignment. Our first two rumor reports were made before this 
clinic was set up. People still will be willing to assist and 
cooperate in relating whatever they, but they will not take 
the time to write it down. They don't wish to be bothered that
much, nor do they wish to sign their names, which of course, in 
this instance, they were told this would not be necessary, and in 
the spirit of cooperation, we are not submitting their names. However, 
if you still desire a list, I will be glad to gain their permission 
to submit their names for your future use.

It seems the rumors of the wild and fantastic variety do 
not prevail in the Midwest. We find that those comments or complaints 
that might be classified as rumors based on fact, pertain more to 
dissatisfaction with the Administration and the war effort rather than 
anything else.

Sincerely yours,

Ilo L. Murphy
