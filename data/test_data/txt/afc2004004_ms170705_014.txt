[top] gone the day I leave!  But landed near us but turned out to be a helicopter carrying something and the helicopter was the large part!  Then we had to take my papers - where? Dolly & I were rowing - out to the boat I think - in a little rowboat across these sandy watery stretches.  Then we started back, because the tide was covering the sand, And we saw out boat had been turned over & completely filled with sand.  We waded across the shallow pool, but stopped, because [??] a factory or plant behind the [s]eawall, these enormous sections of [??][a?ch] were being [t]ossed.  Large flat squares as big as a house  we [we]re afraid to walk past them for [fear] of being hit.
