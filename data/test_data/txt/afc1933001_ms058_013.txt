I have not heard finally 
from you on the Gamut
matter, though I've already
[made] filled half dozen records
(Gamut's discs) taking waivers
in each case.

Again I thank 
you for promptly making 
the way easy for 
us. Alan has written me
frequently of what a fine
job you are doing and
I understand why.

Always sincerely,
John A. Lomax
