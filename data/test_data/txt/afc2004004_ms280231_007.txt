TAPE 8A EWAN MCCOLL . . .  Childrens Games and Songs: 
Paddy Knight: 
Once knew a man, his name was Paddy White, 
He challenged a navvy out for to fight. 
Hit him on the jaw and he nearly broke it, 
Didn't know the navvy had a hammer in his pocket. 
And he hit Paddy Knight and he fell, 
And now I'm sad to tell, 
He's either in heaven or in Patrick's Croft 
And I don't give a bugger which it is. 

He's a Navvy: 
"The boys would use this for a ball game. . ." 

As I rose up one morning 
Just before two, 
There I saw a navvy, tying up his shoe. 
He's a navvy ha-ha-ha, 
He's a navvy, he-he-he, 
He's a navvy I can see. 

Three - drinking of my tea. 
Four - knocking on my door. 
Five - Take a running dive. 
Six - burning up my sticks 
Seven - Flying up to heaven. . .

"In the cold weather when a boy appeared with a red face he was 
greeted with 
All that glitters is not gold, 
Take for instance, Freddy's nose, 
For it shines like a light in the middle of the night, 
All that glitters isnot gold. 
"ANd a fat boy would be greeted with. . . 

All that shivers is not jelly, 
Take, for instance, Freddy's belly, 
For it shivers like a fish in the middle of a dish, 
All that shivers isn't jelly. . . 

"And there were rounds. . . . " 

The higher up the mountain 
The greener grows the grass, 
The more a donkey wags his tail 
The more he shows his - 
The higher up the mountain etc. . . .
