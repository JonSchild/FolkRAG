Dear Lomax,

I am glad to hear that you are going to write the story of your collecting
adventures. To many others as well as myself I am sure such a book would
be welcome; and, - in spite of your modest disclaiming of scholarship - very helpful
toward the understanding of the workings of tradition. Since you are so
kind as to ask e what I should like to find in your saga, I shall set down some
of the things which to one line myself - totally innocent of work in the field
as a collector - would help to satisfy curiosity. Stand not on the order of my
going in these vagrom notes.

The first paragraph in the "acknowledge at" in American Ballads and Folk
Sogs seems to me to strike the note for the beginning of the narrative, and
expansion of that material could hardly fail to waken interest. As I think of
older collectors - like Walter Scott - I should like to know how far your early
interest came from books and how far from hearing the cowboys sing. The Chisholm
Trail should certainly bear a free treatment for its place in your own
experience and for its picturesqueness as a route for folk song migrations.

Was it Child's reputation that brought you to Harvard? And was it his intimation that the "popular" ballads were a close account that led you to turn
to the related "non-popular" songs? You will notice that I am now speaking out
of my own literary preoccupation with the "orthodox" ballads. But I want you to
know that I appreciate the more liberal definitions of folk-song- for instance
Barry's and that I believe that the older Child ballads can be understood only
in terms of the broader traditions represented by your collecting.
