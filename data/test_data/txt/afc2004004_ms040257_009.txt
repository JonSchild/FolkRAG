"Fuirich an duigh" (Weaving song)  [*"Barra Songs" scripts. p.3.*] 
Fuirich an duigh gus am maireach 
Gradh air iteagan gu il u ro 
Fuirich an duigh gus am maireach 
Gradh air iteagan gu il u ro 
Gus an sniomh mi leine shnath dhuit. 

Lomax: How do you know the rhythm? 
C. Johnston: It just goes natural. I can't help it. 
Spinning song: 
C. Johnston: The lady sings a love song to her wheel, as it might be. 
"Thug mi gaol dhuit" 
(I gave love and affection to you 
That sister ne'er gave brother 
That mother ne'er gave to her suckling child 
And you are the wheel and I am the thread 
And we are spinning the song of fate)
