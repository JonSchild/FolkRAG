From Margery C Quigley, Montclair, N.J.
Heard in Springfield, Mass, Aug 13 1942
Subject:  Race prejudice

"My colored maid who had been with me ten years left
to go to the Armory. Just as she was leaving the [5]
house she said to me "Our minister says 'Some day
you white people will be working for us.'"
"I had always babied her and treated her in a
friendly democratic way. While I was in New York
visiting for a few days, she had actually been working
in the Armory."
