and typography. Below, an effort will be made to present a 
series of suggestions concerning the details of operation based 
upon the analysis made in the Office of War Information. These 
suggestions represent generalizations which can be expected to 
improve the effectiveness of the direct counteraction program.

The use of the word "rumor" in a newspaper column is 
unwise, since it may tend to increase public anxiety by presenting 
as objects of possible belief reports which otherwise would be 
laughed at. By a calling a stilly story a "rumor" you automatically 
lend it dignity. Therefore, instead of the word "rumor" another 
should be substituted, perhaps "phony" or "fake." Columns aimed at 
controlling rumors should avoid titles like "Rumor Column" or "Rumor 
Clinic." If the project has arranged for periodic publication of 
information material, direct rumor counteraction [w]could be part of 
its regular release. This is the most desirable arrangement as 
in this way the column is known as a source of truth, rather than 
of rumor. 

SELECTION OF MATERIALS

Some types of stories should NEVER be directly counter-
acted.  These are the sort for which it is different to prepare 
effective counteraction. They may be used as the basis for 
specific educational campaigns, but as far as simply pairing the 
rumor with the truth, it seems wisest to avoid these types. Among 
these are:  those items that are simply not true, items that are 
partially true, double-barreled or lengthy items, expressions of 
prejudice, and anxiety motivated items.
