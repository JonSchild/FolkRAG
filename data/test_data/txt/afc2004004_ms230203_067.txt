Being at a merchants house, in comes a tall country fellow, with his alfogeos full of Tobacco; for they seldom Loose their Cudd, but keep Chewing and Spitting as long as they'r eyes are open, - he advanc't to the midle of the Room, makes an awkard Nod-d, and spitting a Large deal of Aromatick Tincture, he gave a scrape with his shovel like shoo, leaving a small shovel full of dirt on the floor, made a full stop.  Hugging his own pretty Body with his hands under his arms, Stood staring rown'd him, like a Catt let out of a Baskett.  At last he opened his mouth and said: Have you any Ribinen for Hatbands to sell I pray?  The Questions and Answers about the pay being past the Ribin is bro't and opened.  Bumpkin Simpers, cryes its confounded Gay I vow; and beckning to the door, in comes Jone Tawdry, dropping about fifty curtsees, and stands by him; hee shows her the Ribin.  Law you, sais shee, its right - Gent, do You, take it, tis dreadful pretty.
