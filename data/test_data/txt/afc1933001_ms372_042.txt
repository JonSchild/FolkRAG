SUN BOOK WEEK, AUGUST 11, 1946 PAGE 3

Lloyd Lewis

FOR the last four days (as this is written) I have been
apparently sitting on the banks of the Des Plaines River
in Illinois, but where I have really been, all that time, was
deep in the heart of Texas.

This escape of the spirit, this transport of the mind has occurred
because the man I have been listening to is John A. Lomax, who
40 years ago began turning the eyes of the world upon Texas.

His work was largely unnoticed at the time, and was indeed
repelled contemptuously at first by Texans themselves, but Lomax
kept on telling an ever-widening circle of college professors and
students across the nation that there was a great native American
literature and music deep in the cowcamps of Texas.

Broadway and Tin Pan Alley paid him no mind at all, and the
cultured Gold Coasters were too busy importing Italian tenors and
shining up their own diamonds for the horseshoe brand of grand
opera ever to inform themselves about the native American music
Lomax heard drum, drum, drumming under the horse hoofs of Texas.

Now, in 1946, everybody in
music or American literature
or the movies or the stage
knows Lomax as the greatest
living folklorist of the Western
world. Five of his books about
our native songs have spread
his fame, two more are soon to
be published. Magazine articles
have been widely circulated describing

how he, with the help
of his son, Alan, in later years,
recorded thousands of cowboy
and hillbilly songs and more
than 10,000 Negro "worksongs"--
the true ballads of our
most musical of races--and put
them in the Library of Congress
where Lomax for so long was
chief archivist of folk music.

Taking his recording machine and microphone into penitentiaries,
cotton fields, steamboat levees, brothels, private homes, churches,
Lomax brought out the still-insufficiently appreciated truth that the
Negro's ballads about his daily life, his toil, his loves, his deaths,
not only outnumber but out-class his "Sunday songs," those more
celebrated "spirituals."

OUT WHERE THE BUCKAROOS SING

WHOEVER sings our folk music on the radio or concert stage nowadays
pays tribute in everything but money to the man who
so long ago carried a phonograph recorder on the pommel of his
Texas saddle across the plains to the lonely cowcamps or the cool
saloons in the hot Panhandle where he persuaded buckaroos to sing
the songs they or their fathers had made up on the old Chisholm Trail.

"Home on the Range" Lomax got from a Negro bartender at
San Antonio in 1908 and published it for the first time in 1910 in
his little pioneer book "Cowboy Songs."

Lomax thinks this most
widely radioed of Western songs
came from early Kansas and he
held out stoutly for its inclusion
in his book as an authentic
piece of plains lore despite the
criticism that one line in it
stamped it as a "literary" effusion
of some sophisticated
Easterner:
"And the graceful white swan
Goes floating along,

Like a maid in a beautiful
dream."
The critics who made this objection
were themselves ignorant
of the fact that there
were wild swans in early
Kansas, a truth attested not
only by the first settlers but by
the early French explorers
when they named one of Kan-
sas' Rivers, "Marais de Cynges,"
or "Marsh of the Swans."

"Whoop-ee-ti-yi-yo," probably the finest of his discoveries, was
given him by a gypsy woman near Fort Worth in 1907, after he
had been led to her by her husband, a young man who, of days, pretended
to be an aged blind minstrel, playing a guitar and rattling
a cup on the streets.

HARVARD CHEERS 'TAWDRY VULGARISMS'

IT WAS Harvard University, not Texas, that first recognized Lo-
max's research for what it was. The son of a Mississippi farmer who
went to Bosque County, Texas in 1869 when little John was 2, he
grew up listening to the cowhands, all about him, sing the songs they
had made up during lonely nights driving Texas longhorns north
to Dodge City. He heard them sing about their troubles with the
"doughies," those little orphan calves who ate grass too early and
swelled up till the cowboys said their guts were full of dough.

Young Lomax took down these secretly, for he saw that every-
body regarded them as cheap, trashy, trivial things. When he first
went to a local college on money earned farming and punching
cows, he carried these songs with him in a roll, only to burn them
when his English professor, full of Tennyson and Longfellow,
scorned them as tawdry vulgarisms.

A few years later, in 1906 to
be exact, when young Lomax had
worked his way to Harvard, he,
with the other boys in an En-
glish class, was told by the great
professor, Barrett Wendell, to
hand in a term paper on something
they knew about at home.
"I'm sick of reading papers on
Browning and Chaucer," Wendell
said. Lomax handed in 40

pages of Texas cowboy songs
and his comments theron.
Wendell jumped with enthusiasm,
called Lomax out and
made him read his paper to
the class but, instead of reading
he sang the ballads, when his
paper came to them. The class
went wild. This was something
entirely new, unprecedented--
these songs of the Wild West.

The word spread. And another and even more august professor
at Harvard, George L. Kittredge, first academic champion of native
American folklore, had Lomax to dinner, and opened many doors
thereafter--a Rockefeller fellowship came to Lomax, also the friend-
ship of President Theodore Roosevelt, a post at the University of
Texas and a career of lecturing and singing--lectures which were to
fix Lomax as the Christopher Columbus of American folk song.

LULLABIES OF THE LONE PRAIRIE

Isn't this unusual for a singer.

NEVER pretending to have a "voice," Lomax had perfect pitch
and the gift for making you see and be part of whatever he
sang about. He sings seldom now--for he is nearing 80, although
he is as salty, scholarly, tough, and poetic as ever--as he motors
around the country which he has criss-crossed so long.

On the banks of the Des
Plaines in the cool of the
evening, last week, he sang--
sang again those yodels with
which the cowboys used to

quiet their herds at night--
wild, gentle, wailing lullabies as
beautiful as those cries of the
Strawberry Man in Gershwin's
"Porgy and Bess."

And Lomax sang again for me "Whoop-ee-ti-yi-yo" with its
Texas cowboy prodding his little doughies toward their new home
in Wyoming--the best song of them all to be bringing alive all the
leather-stained riders, all the bellowing herds, all that era which will
always be coming truly to life again in song, rather than books or
films--songs about the lone prairie and the little doughies who
wouldn't git along.
