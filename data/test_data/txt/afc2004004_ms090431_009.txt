Fisk, 6. 3. HAFFER
A: What sort of songs would you sing?
H : Well, old jump-up songs -- the blues weren't the style then -- they
called them reels then (laughter).
A: Songs like UPjohn Looking to the Low Brown?
H : Yessir, and It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo -- that kind of stuff. 
A: Did you ever hear Stagolea?
H : Sure. All that kind of stuff before. 
A: And did you ever sing in parties in those days? I mean for partly --
H : Well, we used to have in those days, they used to have candy-knockings,
candy pulling and they would have a party and it seem to me to
come around Christmas time. 
A: You never played an instrument though?
H : No sir.
A: You would just sing?
H : Yessir. 
A: What were the kinds of parties besides candy knockings?
H: Oh, well, there is knockings and sometimes picnics out, cotton
picnics -- when they picled cotton, you know-- and something to eat
and maybe sitting in the shade, and that like. 
A: Was Frankie and Albert popular back in those days?
H: Frankie and Johnnie was the one that was popular in those days. 
Sometimes I even hear them on the radio sing it now.
A: Did you ever hear of Railraod Bill Was a mighty bad man. He jumped
the train and started to ran. He was a bad man, Railroad Bill?
H: I never did sing it. 
A: Did you know Stagolea?
Oh, I knew Stagolea.
A: Where was he from anyhow?
