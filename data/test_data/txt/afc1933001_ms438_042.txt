[Blues - - Ain't No Need Your Bowin' Down
On Your Knees]

[Notes taken during rendition of song.]

I wish to the Lord I never had been born;
I wouldn' been here singin' this same ol' song.

This trouble I'm having ain't gonna last always,
I just come here to serve out my days.

Looky yonder,great God, at what I see,
A host of women coming after me.

Apples in the kitchen, peaches on the shelf,
Gettin' tired of sleepin' [here] in a big bed by myself.

It ain't no need you bowin' on your knees,
Look somewhere else for your butter and cheese.

[What D.B. replied when asked about the origin of the
song, maintaining that it is his own composition.
"I was tryin' myself out one night at in Angola and things
begin jumpin' up in my head an' I made this blues up."]
