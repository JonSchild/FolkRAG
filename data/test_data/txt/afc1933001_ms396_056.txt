and beautiful lullabies, besides the cheerful and ringing songs of labor.

    Before separating for the night a thousand miners in Utah stand about the
mine pit and sing "Joe Bowers"; in hundreds of lumber camps voices chant the redoubtable
exploits of "Silver Jack"; at cowboy reunions you can still hear the real cowboys, in cowboy
manner and phrasing, tell the stories of "The Dying Cowboy", "The Old Chisholm Trail" and
the "Little Dogies"; in remote districts of the South black labor in gangs yet picture th
the surge and heave of labor,-- the clang of hammers on steel bolts, the ring of the cane
knife, the swish of hoes cutting grass roots, the slow movements of lazy mules dragging scrapers up and
down the banks of a levee --through the medium of song with graphic words fitted into
[unique and] unusual and [?] unique musical combinations.
