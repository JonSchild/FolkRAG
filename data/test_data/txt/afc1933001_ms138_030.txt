us for you were so much 
fun. How did, Abo's peppermint 
work out, I don't suppose you 
send them to her, you wouldn't 
be so foolish, (excuse me) Abo
still play's those some old 
song's and Yalmer plays 
his mouth organ, that makes 
me more lonesome for you. 
that evening when you left, 
well we had a half a gallon 
of wine and we celebrated for 
your good luck, Gee! if you 
were here, know that little lady 
too she misses you very much 
when you come next summer 
you'll get numbers of old song's 
polk's and at her old time plays. 
I wish we could of come 
with you, Abo's sorry now
