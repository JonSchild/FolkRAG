107. 

When I make a hundred 
I make a hundred and a half 
Going back to Memphis 
To sit on my black ass 

In the way of songs, there was one that was made up
by a man on this plantation a long time ago. It's about
Mary Steward a real woman who got shot. I knows it's 
the truth cause I was there. Naw she wasn't nobody 
famous, just somebody that everybody round here knowed.
And this man what wrote it was good for fiddling with 
words. Have you ever heard the song of Mary Steward? 
Well this is it. 

One Saturday evening about two o'clock 
Had to go to the ball to see that brown a man 
Buck Bliss throwed up 
Will People knowed 
He jumped behind Mary Steward 
And she caught the load 

She ran inside the house 
And leant up side the door 
The blood a dreaning all over the floor

They took little Mary fore her mother's door 
She hollered, Oh Lord the bullet pain me so 
They took little Mary to the Doctor's house 
Took two or three women to lay po' Mary out 
The Doctor cut and bobbed her arm off short 
Now little Mary can laff and talk.
