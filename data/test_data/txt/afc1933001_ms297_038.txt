his earnings cleared at the Harris 
Grand. 
     In 1928, the Harris Grand and 
Princess theatres were leased to 
Publix. The Publix company closed 
its doors and the theatres were returned 
to their founder's widow 
Mrs. Harris. Later they were leased 
to Theatrical Managers Inc., which 
at that time, was operating a chain 
of shows in this section of the 
state. Ray Howard, of Muncie, succeeded 
Roy Feltus as manager of 
the theatres in 1937. 
     The theatre served many purposes. 
The Democrats held their 
district convention in the theatre in 
1908, and Congressman William 
Cullop, of Vincennes, was nominated. 
Cullop's nomination came after 
a long dead-lock which was broken 
about two o'clock in the morning. 
Cullop was elected and served two 
terms in Congress.
