"I noticed in the news that a fifth column has sprung up in Russia
now.  Apparently up to now they have been pretty free from internal
trouble of this kind, but with all the attention focused there, I
guess every effort will be made now to get a sell-out from the inside
if possible.  It makes a fellow wonder how many we may have in this
country planning to sell us out."
