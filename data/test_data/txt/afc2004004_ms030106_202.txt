ran Brown's out of gas.  Took all the movie stars again with 4 pieces and
they had 8 - which was considered the best band in town, no question about
it.  So Brown found he couldn't do any business in Watts and he
decided to come into Los Angeles and try to get what they call the "over-
flow trade."  He moved a half a block from the Cadillac on the corner of
6th and Central - and we was in the middle of the block of Central
between fifth and sixth, pretty close to the Southern Pacific Depot.
Well anyway, he came up there with this tremendous bunch - my brother-in-law
was playing the drums for him at the time - Johnson - Dirk
Johnson.  Well, anyway, did fairly well for awhile, but all the trade
drifted back to the Cadillac and we had the trade that everybody
wanted to be around - the movie stars.
     So pretty soon they start to cuttin' off.  At that time - Wilson was
the boss of the band.  It changed from the violinist to
Wood Wilson, the bass player.  So they start to cuttin off different
pieces - they cut off the trombone and, later, they cut off the
violin.  Then later they cut off the trumpet.  They cut off the clarinet.
It worked down to bass, piano and drums.  That's the combination they had,
see (chuckling) until, finally, - Wilson being the boss - the boss let
him go - it worked down to drums and piano.  And they finally let the
drummer go, which was my brother-in-law and kept the piano, which was
Hageman and they finally had to let him go and close the place up.
     I also told him the same thing that I told Murray - that I would
close the place up, then the Cadillac was again in bloom - in first class
shape.  The tunes we was playing out there they couldn't play the tunes
like we could in New Orleans, because they didn't have the ability, the
same kind of ability, I'd say, out there.  So we had to play what we could.
We played numbers like The Russian Rag, which was quite popular - and
maybe, Black & White, Grace & Beauty, Maple Leaf Rag - of course we had some
very good men and things like that, we had some very good tunes.
