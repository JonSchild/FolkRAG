Mr., Mr. Harris's child, ya know.  [Baby] Lil, lil' baby.  No lil' baby;
the baby's so big I couldn't tote 'im.  Sometime they [done] had to put 'im
a carriage for me!  I stayed down there with 'em sometimes.  The Harris's was
one mile from where we stayed at.  An' I'd go down there an' tend
to that lil' baby for 'em.

what it's for, but that's what they liked for 'em to do.
       An' ah, you know, [some a them] center tables be like this thing here,
with three laigs, ya know.   They used to have center tables sittin' in
