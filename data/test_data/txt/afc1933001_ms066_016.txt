Mr. John A. Loma
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your last two
letters. First of all, I want to tell you how much
I regret your reaction to my unsociable attitude 
last summer. I had hoped that you would understand
my situation better than you seemed to. There is still
no let-up - in fact, this letter is being drafted late 
at night in my home. But perhaps there will be an
improvement in my situation when you next come to
Washington and we can see more of each other then.

I passed on to the Librarian the two letters form
the composers but I have not yet acted on the invitation
from the N.E.A. I should be delighted to have
you represent us in Milwaukee but it seems best to
arrange for your trip to Washington first. As you
remember, we discussed your coming here to annotate
all your records. Would you be interested in recording
on your way up. If so, please give me an approximate
mileage, the estimated number of records necessary,etc.
Please send this information by air mail so that I
can start negotiations soon. 

Sincerely, 


Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
