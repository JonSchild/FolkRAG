The workers on the S.P. Line to strike sent out a call
But Casey Jones the engineers, He wouldn't strike at all
His boilers they were leaking, And his drivers on the bum,
And Casey and his enginer, They were clean out of plumb.

Chorus: Casey Jones kept his junkpile running,
Casey Jones was working double time,
Casey Jones, he got a wooden medal,
For being good and faithful on the S.P. Line.

The workers said to Casey, "Won't you help us win this strike?"
But Casey said, "Let us alone - you'd better take a hike",
Then someone put a bunch of railroad ties across the track,
And Casey hit the river with an awful crack.

Chorus: Casey Jones hit the river bottom,
Casey Jones, broke his broomin' spine,
Casey Jones, became an angelino, 
And took a trip to heaven on the S.P. Line.

When Casey Jones got up to heaven to the pearly gate,
He said, "I'm Casey Jones, the guy that pulled the S.P. freight"
" You're just the man," said Peter, "Our musicians are on strike,"
Y ou can get a job blacklegging any time you like."

Chorus: Casey Jones, got a job in heaven,
Casey Jones, was doing mighty fine,
Casey Jones, went scabbing on the angels,
Just like he did the worker on the S.P.Line.

The angels got together and they said it wasn't fair,
For Casey Jones to go around a-scabbing ev'rehwere,
The Angels' Union, Number Twenty-three, it sure was there,
And they promptly fired Casey down the golden stair.

Chorus: Casey Jones, when Hell a-flying,
" Casey Jones" the devil said, " Oh fine!"
" Casey Jones, get busy shovelling sulphur
"That's what you get for scabbing on the S.P.Line."
