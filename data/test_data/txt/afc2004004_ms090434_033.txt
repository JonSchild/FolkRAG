God bless such a cheerful giver.
I went to the Clarksdale Daily
Press office and I fail to see Mrs.
Snider.  I would like to see her
when I come in the office.
I went to Locust Sunday
again and got disappointed.  The
The Heaven-Bound quartette
said that they were sponsoring
a program.  I went there and fail
to see any of them, and I chanced
to see Rev. and Mrs. Broaden,
also their niece of Alab in person
of Pearlie Lark.  She is a college
girl.
We are having some winter
now if the Lord say so I am
planning to sponsor a big Easter
program at Pleasant Valley M.
B. C.  It is sweet of Mr. Billy letting
his houseboy go and get my
chair for me.  If he aint got no
religion, he can do a religious
duty.  But he sure is a fine young
man.  Also his bookkeeper, Mr.
Joe Thompson, all of them treats
me right.
I went to see my cousin, Rosa
Dotson.  She was sick in bed.  I
hope she is better now.
Better pray.  This world is in
a bad condition.

I was proud of that, for he had
just a pan full of them.

Mattson News
By M. WILLIAMS
This is the twelfth day of the
first month of the year.  And I
cannot forget to thank the Lord
for His goodness and for His
mercies endureth forever.  He has
blessed me to be able to write
another letter for the precious
paper, The Daily Press.  I am
always glad to have the welcome
privilege to have something to
say about our community.  We
have a quiet, peaceful community,
we had about the quietest
social Christmas I have ever
seen for a long time.  Prayer
changes conditions.  God gives us
the mind, the knowledge and
wisdom.
Mr. Acie White is on the sick
list.  He is very ill.  His boys
brought him up to the doctor today
and we hope for him a
speedy recovery.  O, it is so much
sickness now.  They are really
speeding our Dr. Raney.  His
speed nomical is about 200 and
that is going some.  We pray that
the Lord will keep him on the
path of health so he can go.
M. Williams did not get out to
her church Sunday, but I sure
did want to go.  I was expecting
Rev. Gardner and his wife to
come by for me, but I think they
must have forgot.  I hope they
had a good service.
Miss Louise Lofton and Mrs.
Sarah Brown were visitors in
Mattson Monday.
M. Williams and Mrs. Sarah
Caffee were visitors with Mrs.
Johnson Sunday.
