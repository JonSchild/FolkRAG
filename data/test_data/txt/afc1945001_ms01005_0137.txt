Correspondence re. Rumors

I took the liberty of answering each of these
letters in Keith Kane's name because all but one of them
were turned over to the Bureau of Intelligence for response.

Our replies were based on the assumption, which
I believe to be correct, that the Bureau of Intelligence's
"Rumor in Wartime" report in its expurgated version (submitted
to you on October 8th) would be released to responsible
private individuals and defense groups.

The original letters will be available to you in
the files of this Division whenever you wish to consult them.
