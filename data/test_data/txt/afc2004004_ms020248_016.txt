BJ TAPE 34, p. 14

        So Nehni went [off in] over there, in this patch.   It was about a 
mile from home.   An' he got that watermelon.   He got another one.
An' I'm tellin' ya, they was so large, he jus', ow, all he could
do -- A watermelon's unhandy to tote, anyway.   Had one un' his
arm, one on his arm an' one on his shoulder, this way.   An' boy,
he had all he could walk with.   Great big things.
        Got to the house, they had to open the do' for 'im.   An', an'
he'p him ease it down.   Oh.  He ah, he got bof (both) of 'em
that was marked.   An' ah, brother! 
         An' ah, an' goes an' git the big butcher knife.   Come in
there; gonna cut it.   An' it stuck right. . . !    Tuk the knife on
the devilish thing an' he couldn't git the knife in it.   An'
said, "Dis ain't no watermelon.   Hah, it's a siddermon."   Hah,
ha, had to tote that great big siddermon, ha, ha, ha.   Everybody
there tuned up for watermelon!   Ha, ha, ha!   Watermelon was
good, though.
TL:     Two siddermons?
BJ:      Bof of 'em was siddermons.   An' they were so big, an', an',
an' then Auntie said,  "Well, I'm gonnna hide these siddermons 'till
['cause] I can get a chance to make preserve out of 'em."   Hah!
They was so big.   Had enough preserve for houses an' houses!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
         Nehni was so outdone; he was mad!    Heh, heh, heh! An'
an' tote that mean ol' siddermon home, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha!
That was so funny; we laugh at that thing.   We laugh at Nehni
all the time about that, ha, ha!   Yessir, them siddermons...
huh, huh!   He couldn't eat [too] much.  Not
I asked him cut it when time to cut it. (?)
