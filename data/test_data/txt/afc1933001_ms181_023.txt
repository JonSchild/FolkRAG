Dear Miss Austin:

The Archive of American Folk Song is planning to make up a
group of the best representative American Folk songs to be
distributed in Latin America. Among the songs we hope to
use is your performance of Sail Gal which occupies 1/2 of a 
10" record. We will pay you $3.30 for the use of this record
and we will send you two copies of it for your own use.

I hope you will give us your permission to use this song by
signing and returning the enclosed form as soon as possible.
All the records will carry the legend, "For non-commercial use
only" and of course, your name will appear on every record.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
