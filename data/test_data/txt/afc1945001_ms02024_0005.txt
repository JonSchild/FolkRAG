On Street car, evening of Aug. 10, 1942. 
[*277*] 

Two women talking. 
(1st woman)  "The English should have come to some 
arrangement with Gandhi and his people, to make their 
Country free after the war; not seize Gandhi and 
antagonize India at this time with all England's [*2*] 
other troubles." 
(2nd woman)  "I think so too.  America could have 
handles it for them in an amicable manner.  The 
English are alright; I like them, but they are so 
darn greedy."
