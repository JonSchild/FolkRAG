Columbia Furthering Interest 
In Folk Music in Two Ways 

By DOROTHY COULTER

The Columbia Broadcasting System
is furthering interest in folk 
music in two ways with its Folk 
Music of America program series 
this season, William Fineshriber, 
CBS producer in charge of the 
series, revealed today. 
Here to supervise the square 
dance broadcast which the Galax 
"Bog Trotters" will originate in 
WDBJ's studios tomorrow as a CBS 
American School of the Air broadcast,
Mr. Fineshriber pointed out 
that inculcating a taste for early 
American music in the nation's 
school children is proving to be 
not the only outcome of the system's
24-program series. The other 
is the enriching of the Congressional
Library's archives of folk 
music, from versions and variations
of old folk songs and ballads 
sent in to the offices by listeners 
who have listened to the programs 
and remembered the tunes or 
verses as they learned them. 
Write Own Versions 
"The older people who remember 
the ancient folk tunes write in 
their own versions," Mr. Fineshri- 
ber said. "The upshot of their 
letters has been a good many valu- 
able contributions to the Congre- 
sional Library's archives." From 
these oldsters have come a great 
many of the 40,000 letters which
CBS received in six weeks this fall 
in connection with its American 
School of the Air broadcasts. AS 
far as the folk song series is concerned,
the other big fan mail 
classification comes from the 
school children themselves. 
"Those letters are interesting," 
the director declared. "A lot of 
them contain verses the kids have 
made up to the folk tunes we use 
on the programs. For instance, 
a kid will make up a song to sing 
while riding his bicycle, and sing 
it to a cowboy tine. That's the 
way folk music originated and 
grew, in the first place." 
With the children the most popular
songs are the nonsense and courting
songs, Mr. Fineshriber revealed, 
"Kids like simple tunes, one-line
melodies they can follow and remember
and sing," he said. "We
often use theses simple melodies to
introduce them to the more complicated,
composed music. We get a
good composer to write a four-
minute symphony based on a folk
song theme, and play first the folk
song, then the theme, and then the
symphonic arrangement for the children.
They like it, and many of them
write in that perhaps this symphonic
music isn't so bad after all."
All subjects are treated historically
on the folk music series with the
background of each type of song

audience. Columbia believes that 
a significant development in America's
cultural coming to age is a
growing appreciation of the richness
of American folk music. And
its American School of the Air
broadcasts are playing an important
part in this development; its audiences 
vary from a minimum of five
million to approximately 12 million
school children daily. That's a lot
of potential influence.
One hundred and twenty-five
thousand copies of the CBS teacher's
manual and broadcasting guide have
been distributed, and most of the
48 States have authorized the use
CBS American School of the Air
programs in the classrooms.
The broadcast to be given in
WDBJ's studios tomorrow is the first
music broadcast Columbia has presented 
outside of its own studios.
"We'd like to originate the programs 
more often in their own localities
said Mr. Fineshriber. The
children like to hear music 'coming
from the Place wheer it lives.' If
it weren't for the difficulties of
broadcasting and the expense involved 
we'd do It more often. Another 
reason we generally broadcast
from our New York Studios is that,
believe it or not, lot of folk music
talent is right there in New York."
The square dance will be brought
to the nation's radio listeners in its
purest form through the Columbia
Broadcasting system and the facilities
of the Times-World corporation's 
station WDBJ, tomorrow
morning at 9:15 o'clock, when the
"Bog Trotters", folk musicians from
Galax, interpret for the classroom
audience of Columbia's American
School of the Air the square dance
tunes and ballads handed down to
them b ytheir ancestors. The program 
is being presented as one of a
series devoted to the Folk Music of
America.
First of Series
It marks the second time In
VVDBJ's history that the "local station 
has "fed the network" on a
program.
WDBJ's staff is assisting in the
production of the broadcast, and
Paul Reynolds, studio director for
WDBJ, will handle the announcing
for the entire program, replacing
Columbia's Niles Welsh, regular
School of the Air announcer.
Reynolds and Jack Weldon, program 
director and educational director 
of WDBJ, went Saturday to
Galax to meet Alan Lomax, "folk
musician" and one of the directors
of the folk music program series,
and put finishing touches on Tuesday's 
broadcast. The "Bog Trotters"
will come to Roanoke tomorrow for
a studio dress rehearsal.
Two Broadcasts
The broadcast is to be made twice
from WDBJ studios tomorrow to be
carried both times by the local
station. The first broadcast, from
9:15 to 9:45 a. m., is for the east
and central portion of the United
States, and a re-broadcast from 3:35
to 4 p. m. will reach the west.
