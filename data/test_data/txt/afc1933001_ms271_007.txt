1. What would the Ar-my do with - out the En-gin-eers, can anyone
2. " " " " " " " " " " " "
3. " " " " " " " " " " " "

(A) Second time to "3"
tell me what they would do? For if they want a roadway built, why
" " " " " " At every railroad station you will
" " " " " " And if you see a Jap in-va-der

you can bet your shirt-Nobody else but an Engineer could
see girls shedding tears-Ninety-nine and a half percent are shed
tremb-a-ling with fear-Who in the heck is he afraid of

(Back to Beginning) (3)
ever move the dirt, Oh! Even at a par-ty where there's lots of girls & beer
for the Engineers, Oh! If you see an Aviator crying in his beer
an Army En-gin-eer, oh! If they want a railroad or a map to make things clear

you can bet the life of the par-ty is an Ar - my En-gin-eer, Hey!
you can bet his girl just left him for an Ar - my En-gin-eer, Hey!
where the heck are they gonna get it with-out an En--gin--eer, Hey!
