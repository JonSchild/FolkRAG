I am a Texas cowboy
I was raised upon the
trail
I saw the shabby antelope 
I heard the
coyote wail
I've slept all in the
shadow my blanket
was the moon
I was on my way
to the Ind. nation
Where I knew a friendly 
chief
That [She] came to him in
autumn when the
leaves were falling &
they called him 
Falling Leaf
