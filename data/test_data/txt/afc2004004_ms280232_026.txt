Grandfather's Old Armchair:
1) What me brother said come true for he had her, , too.
Strange to say I settled down in married life.
First the gal I court and then the ring I bought,
Took her to church, and she's me married wife.
When me work was over I declare,
I would never booze but always stay at home
And sit me in me old arm-chair.
2) One night the chair fell down, as I picked it up I found
The seat had fallen out upon the floor.
And there to my surprise, I saw before me eyes
A lot of notes, ten thousand pounds or more.
When my brother heard of this, the fellow he confessed
When the will was read he tore his hair.
But I only laughed at him and said unto him "Jim,
Don't you wish you'd had the old armchair."

The Farmer's Boy:
1) The sun went down behind yon hill across the dreary moor.
Weary and lame a boy there came up to the farmer's door.
"Will you give me, who e'er you be, that will give me employ
For to plough or to sow or to reap or to mow
And be a farmer's boy, and be a farmer's boy ?"
2) "My father's dead, but me mother and I, we have five children small,
And what's the worse for me mother still, I'm the oldest of them all.
Though little I be, I fear not work, nor wander for employ....
4)If you cannot give me employ, one favor I shall ask,
Will you shelter me till the break of day from the cold and wintry blast ?
At the break of day I haste away elsewhere to find employ....
4) Now the farmer's wife cried, "Pray take the lad, no further let him seek."
"Oh yes, father dear," the daughter cried while tears ran down her cheek.
For them that will work and to wander for employ.....
5) In course of time he grew a man' the gool old farmer died.
Now he left the lad the farm he had and the daughter for his bride;
Now that lad that was and the man that is have thought will daily joy,
Of that lucky, lucky day when he came that way.........
