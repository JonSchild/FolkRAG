BJ TAPE 3, p. 3

AL: Really?
BJ: Yeah, Lawd!
AL: For a long time?
BJ: On , no, no, not so long. And then durin' the Bible meetin' aorund, around three weeks after, around three weeks. First week, they have a prayer meetin'. The next two weeks they have a preacher, you know, an' takin' in members, you know? And this was what I did because I knew I didn't have anything; I was just raised up in the Church, an' so the elder peoples git religion, ya know, an' prayin' an', an ah, you know. Sayin they was converted, an' I wanted to be there, too, an' really I did. So I asked the Lawd, I wanted to be really converted, enough . So I began to pray, by myself, an' pray at home an' pray in the woods an' all like that, an' really I felt like I was converted. I really  -- I felt diffrunt; I felt changed.
But I see these things, but ah I didn't know what it meant until long afterwards, it come to me. An' this time when I was prayin' there -- this is in Fitzgerald -- an- I, I had um. . .
AL: Was that when you were 18?
BJ: Uh-huh, tha's, tha's when I was 18 years old.
An' ah, this ah, vision that I had when I was prayin' -- I wanted to know, you know, what must I do. I always -- 'cause, ya know, I always have feared God, in comin' up from a chile -- an' I wanted to know what must I do, and was I right or wrong. But still, this vision that come to me, I didn't know what it was until long afterwards. This uh thing -- this man that I see -- this -- it's a tall man. He come to me; he give me three tickets.
