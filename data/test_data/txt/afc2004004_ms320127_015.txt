LOMAX  And who are the folks here, are
they mostly rich people, are they working class people or
what?

W.M.  Over here?

LOMAX  Yeah, here and [UNCLEAR]
W.M.  Oh, here is just people, people
have the whole middle class, some people retired, some are
young people.  If you notice this place, you, you haven't
seen [UNCLEAR].  People just come out here for a good time.
We don't need, we don't need any kind of law and order.  It's
just a great time.  You, you get people from, anywhere from
an 18, 19, the age limit is 18.  You could, can't come in
unless you're 18.  But from that to 65, 70 we get some,
sometimes at 80 years old.  But it's mostly people that come
in here for a good time.  And I just, it makes my night.
Seeing them having a good time is part of my, they help
[UNCLEAR]

LOMAX  [UNCLEAR]  Where is that from?
What does that mean?

W.M.  Oh, that Cajun holler, it's just,
it's just a Cajun expressing his feelings.  He just holler
like hell, just let it, let it all out.

LOMAX  Thank you very much.

W.M.  You're welcome.

LOMAX  I think that's fine.
     :  And we'd like to also. . . .[MUSIC]
