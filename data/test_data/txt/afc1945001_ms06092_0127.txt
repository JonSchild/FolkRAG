   "This may be a free country, but you can't work in this country
unless you join a Union.  Even that won't do no good.  First you have to
raise $70 or even more to join the Union or even get a permit to go to work.
You either have the money or borrow it and pay up.  Then what happens?
You're given a permit, you start work and everything goes swell for about a
week.  Then some other guy joins, because he has seventy bucks.  So you're 
laid off and the new guy gets the job, just because he's got another seventy
bucks for the Union boss.  You can't win, no matter what happens."  (South
San Francisco, August 3rd.  Defense worker)
