the road and the four gros negres 
rode up and down between the two
cheering lanes__

Crowds of people have already come into town
from PaP, Jacmel, etc.. The little cafés
are full and the streets are thronged with
strangers

By five or six o'clock 12 or 14 bands have
passed back + forth through the [city] village.
One or two have been very poor - that is
undecorated affairs _ the poorest had 
only one flag [tied] a lavender mouchoir
tied on a switch, [and] several people 
carried bunches of greenery - there was
[only] one major [and his] costume consisted
of a red church - the other major had 
no costume at all- neither the could
jouer jen very well- this was [the] la 
fleur d'Or_
Another band had only four flags and 
two majors with few payettes on their costume 
It seems to be the custom for everyone in the band [to] toucher the
best prospects - the majors, the chef, the major, the sans bas
- the sans bas parses, the sichlé behind the necks of 
the prospect-
