Suggestions for use —
At this point I want to say that besides being read
(red) this book is useful for a number of things,
such as lighting the furnace, etc. Also, besides being
read, it should be sung. By little kids and old
folks — everyone who has a voice to cuss with.
Sing it by yourself if there's no one else
around — but best of all, get together +
sing. Some of these songs are just made
for that. [If your] Down at your union
hall get together + holler so loud that
the boss, who lives in his swanky house
on the other side of town can hear
you — + shiver + shake in his shoes.
