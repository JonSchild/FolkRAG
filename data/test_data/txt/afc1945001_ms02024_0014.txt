War rumors heard by four members of Journalism Department from August 
10 through noon August 15, inclusive: 

First faculty member -- None. 

Second faculty member -- 

Has visited Marietta and heard rumor several times in vicinity 
of Bell Bomber Plant (under construction) that plant is impractical 
(too far from sources of material and labor) and never will be 
completed.  

Third faculty member -- 

Heard report that Atlanta is almost certain to be bombed next month 
(September).  Statement attributed to "civilian defense officials."  
One time.  

Heard report that negroes and whites are being mixed indiscriminately [*5*] 
at For McPherson.  At least two times.  (This rumor probably has 
some connection with the state gubernatorial campaign now in progress.  
In support of it reference has been made to recent newspaper articles 
reporting speeches by Mrs. Roosevelt to Negroes on right of both 
races to equality of economic opportunity.) 

Fourth faculty member -- 

Heard rumor that unless an American is named commander of the Allied 
forces, the U. S. troops will get all the dirty work.  If a British [*2*] 
commander is used, the Tommies will be kept at home while Americans 
do the fighting on the second front.  Three times.  

Atlanta is to be bombed in September.  Three times.  

That Mrs. Roosevelt was denied permission to speak (was even hustled 
out of town) because she observed as she arrived in Birmingham that 
Negroes had a right to expect better economic conditions after the 
war.  Once.
