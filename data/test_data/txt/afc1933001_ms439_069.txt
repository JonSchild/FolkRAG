Death Letter Blues

Notes taken during renditions of the song:

So many people waitin' on his sick wife, she didn' know 
him from nobody else. When he look down in herf face, 
here what he said in his min'.

He goes to work an' pokes his head out de [wo] window an' he 
knows his wife mus' be pretty low.
