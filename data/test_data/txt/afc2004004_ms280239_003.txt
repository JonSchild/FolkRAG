Calum: There were seven of us.

Lomax: You were the oldest though?

Calum: No, I was the second youngest.  You've been to our home---
well, Mrs Simpson who was there, she was the oldest of the
family.  Then there was Mary, who is dead, Roderick, who is
also dead, and there's Annie and Mishak and I and Teresa.
Well, the two boys and five girls -- there was another boy,
actually, the oldest of the family---he died at the age of
sixteen -- lead poisoning.

Lomax: Tell me, Calum, how did your mother raise you? I mean,
was there any discipline in the house?

Calum: Oh very strict indeed, oh yes.

Lomax: How did she maintain it? Can you remember anything that
happened to you?

Calum: Well, I can't remember anything in particular, but I
remember,--I'll always remember a lecture from my mother was
more severe than if anybody was, to take a stick to you.  I
would feel a lecture from her much more severe than if I'd
get a thrashing.  She didn't thrash me, but she gave me a good
lecture.

Lomax: What did she say?

Calum: Well, just --- she would tell you off for the faults
of your ways, and how it was quite wrong and how it would
disgrace the rest of the family and all the rest of it, and
she would make you feel just like a worm for doing anything
that was wrong.  And that was, I think, -- well, to me it was
much more effective than if I were to get a thrashing for
anything.

Lomax: Was she a woman that worked hard all the time?

Calum: Oh yes, she was a very hard-working woman.  Never idle
at all.  At that time she worked on the croft, of course, and
she milked the cows and attended them in everything; and in
the evening she carded and spun and made cloth.  There wasn't
an idle moment at all in their lives.  They were all the same;
[Working all the time.] The women at that time were all the same;
working all the time.  Of course, that kind of work they treated
as a recreation; they didn't consider it work.  It was a 
pleasure to them.  They took a pleasure in their work, especially
the work of the cloth -- the carding and spinning and all that.
They had a pride in it and they took a pleasure in it.
