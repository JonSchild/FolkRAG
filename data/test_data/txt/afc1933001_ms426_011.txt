TRIBUTE TO LAFOLLETTE

Tune- Beulah Land.

We've joined a Union Big and Bold,
To make Wisconsin rich as gold,
Cooperation is our aim,
While Brotherhood we all acclaim.

Chorus-
Oh Wisconsin, Oh Wisconsin,
Take up the task and help us win;
LaFollette's voice still rifts the cloud,
His sons will honor father's shroud.
Pick up his sword, his battle cry,
And make him glad in yonder sky.

'This time to crush the power of greed
And answer back the farmer's need.
His occupation rescued now,
Will all our liberty endow.

We aim to make the farmer free,
They're never meant for slavery;
From Gettysburg to Bunkerhill,
The power of wrong we tried to kill.

WHAT'S THE USE OF GIVING UP?

Tune- Mummy Song.

It's a short, short time to win out,
So let us fight while we may.
Each blow will count so hit her hard, to save our day;
What's the use of giving up Bill,
Or admit that we're beat,
When we never lost a battle 'til
We gave up in defeat.

It's a short short time we live here,
So let us smile while we may,
With a song for every moment of the whole bright day;
What's the use of looking gloomy,
Or what's the use of our tears,
When we know a mummy's had no fun
For more'n three thousand years.
