MOTEN NEWS...  by Ellen Peck...

     I do thank the Lord for spareing me to see this new year.
Altho   I sure was afraid because the old year sure did go out
rough.

     Well we ben havin beautiful daysSo far they is beautiful
to finish gathering our cotton.  Altho I did not get through
the last, the two of us made 12 bales, 700 pounds.  Other
big family made as many as 25 bales or more.  We made a good
ccop of corn and is trying to get through this week if it is
the Lord's will for us to get through.

     That talk about home growing last year and do you not think
these fruits and vegetables eat good.  Ham and eggs, Oh boy,  what
a meal.  Yes it is hard to work in the field and can vegtables
too but if you are the smart one you will do it and you won't
regret it in the winter time because it sure will save you a 
lots.
