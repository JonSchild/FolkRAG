[*first*]  If I had a-lissened to my first an' second wives,
I would not a-been here after all lovin' this hard iron.

But some day or 'nother I'll be done worryin' here,
I'll be somewhere , some girl will feel my care.

If I ever live an' goin' free once mo',
I'm gonna write me a letto , gal an' I'm goin' to let you know.

[*First verse*] I been down here rollin' for white man so long,
An' I'm a po' boy an' a long ol' ways from home.

[*Last*] Ain' nobody know but de good Lawd an' me,
When a man get in trouble, all de troubles he see.

I had a black woman an' she was tree-top tall,
An' I b'lieve to my soul that she knowed it all.

An' I taken black woman, taken her to be my friend,
Jes' look what a hole she done   throwed me in.

An' I can't get a letter an' she won' send no word,
An' I b'lieve to my soul I got to leave this world.

I'm gonna get up this mornin' jes' before de sun does rise,
Thinkin' 'bout my baby-- it(s time she opened her eyes.

Well, a curly-headed woman, Lord , I can't deny,
But a nappy headed woman, o Lord, I do despise.

When I was broke , babay, an' did not have a dime,
Lord, po' ol' Marthy come an' say here's a friend of mine.

An' jes' as long as I [have another dime,] get a nickle or dime,
Po' ol' Marthy can have all of mine.
