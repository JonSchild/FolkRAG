some time.
I had intended to write you some time ago on a rather delicate matter, but refrained from doing so for obvious reasons. In the course of talking with old Mrs. MacNeil, Creachan, and Mrs. Mary Morrison, Barsay, I found out that they have not got contracts from the B.B. C., as some of the other singers who had sang for you had done. 
Perhaps there was some reason for it, but I would have liked old Mrs. Mary MacNeil - (83 years of age) to have had that contract to think about, when she eventually settles down! 
Best wishes, and again, many thanks for a lovely present. 
Yours, Aife,
Annie Johnston 
(Also ask about Mom-awfully sorry)
