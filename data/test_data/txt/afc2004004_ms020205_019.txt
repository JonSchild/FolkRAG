DEAR FELLOW CHURCHMEN:
     The Parking Lot which is across the street from the play yard of the Parish House on
University Avenue has been completed expect for the lining of it. This lot has been developed
to aid with off-street parking for members of All Saints' while attending
activities at the church. The mid-week communion service at 10 o'clock on Wednesday fell
off to practically a hand full of faithful worshipers because there was no place to park
in the vacinity of All Saints' Parish House and Church during the daylight hours of the
fall, winter and spring months. The two hour parking zone on 27th alleviated this situation;
however, the parking lot was necessary and is now available for use. I sincerely
hope that the members of All Saints' will remember the purpose for which the lot was
designed and will not abuse it by occupying space in the lot when they are not about the
business of the church.
     St. Andrew's Episcopal School will open again in September with all six of the
elementary grades. It is located at 2100 Pearl and is under the directorship of Mrs.
Allan Henry. There are at present openings in all grades and inquiries are invited. The
school is staffed by an excellent faculty who are committed to the task of educating the
entire personality of the children -- mind, body and spirit. St. Andrew's affords to its
children an education with a plus. The "plus" being the religion of Christ as believed
and taught by the Episcopal Church. For further information about the school telephone
GR8-3345.
     Elsewhere in the bulletin you will find a list of the teachers and the curriculum
used in the summer quarter of All Saints' Sunday School. You will recall that from the
6th grade on up the summer quarter places these children in the church rather than the
classroom, at the 9:15 service. As always I am profoundly grateful to the teachers of
our children.
