Dear Alan:  I thank you
for your letter from Fisk.
I would enjoy greatly some
amount of your experiences
if you could only spare
enough time to write them
out for me, but, as I have
always told you, I do not
wish to be any burden to
you. You've given me a
lot of pleasure along with
much worry and anguish
which I hope is due entirely
to the kind of person
I happened to be. I've had
my fling with you. Always
I have wished you to be
free to do what you
