Notes 1) A "chabeen" is simply what in another popular
Caribbean folk song [in English] is referred to as a
"brown-skin gal", or a "yellow girl". She is not
black in complexion, yet not as "white" as the 'Mulato'.
When a "lighter" shade of black was important, she was quite
"something" for a man to aspire to have, It would seem
that this phenomenon is busy disappearing.
