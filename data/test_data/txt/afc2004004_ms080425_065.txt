Tape:  224  Summary

In the first part of the tape, Alan Lomax tries to elicit a song
from Mrs. Rogers as she is preparing the food (chicken, slaw, salad,
pies, cakes and etc.).   Later, she sings a "popular" tune, called
"Marilla's Lesson"; she is not certain of the song's or title's
meaning, but says that it is "very very old."
She then explains how she learned the songs as a child from her
father, a "singing school teacher."  She says that when, much later,
she saw the songs printed in a collection, she was surprised to find
out that she had sometimes been singing the wrong words:  "I always
sang 'two, three, grace' rather than 'true free grace'."
As a child, she sang tenor, but then switched to alto, the part her
mother sang.
In the next section, Alan and Mrs. Rogers discuss more about food.
Mrs. Rogers like to sing alto rather than the "lead part" (tenor).
"It's like bass. . . ."
Now Alan talks with Mr. and Mrs. Rogers together
Mr. Rogers also learned Sacred Harp from his father, a man with a 
"strong voice."  Asked what the music was about, he said the music had
"a lot of expression."  Its words were from the Bible, and it
was a good way to worship.  Mr. and Mrs. Rogers both added the important
of fellowship and friendship between the singers ("the people we love").
The music comes from emotion, and the song helps you feel the spirit of
the text's meaning:  "that's why it's so popular."
Mr. Rogers, who has been mayor for 20 years and runs a business, said
that his father came to Heard County in 1889.  Mr. Rogers met his wife
at Sacred Harp.  "That's one reason we both like it so well"
Alan mentions the social nature of Sacred Harp, a place for young people
to meet and have fun.  Mr. Rogers agreed.
Mr. and Mrs. Rogers met in 1936 and married in 1939.  Asked if they sing
together at home, they answered "on the way to and from Sacred Harp."
Then Mr. Rogers mentioned some of his favorite songs, by number and name:
(318, 101, 298, 405, 343:  Happy Home, 389)  and recites 318 "a pretty song"
