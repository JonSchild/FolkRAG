Voodooism in Music, Sir Richard Terry
Telling how jazz-bands act as propagandists
for the cult of the voodoo which has attraction
for a spiritually weary E. & Am with
remarks on the origin of N. Spir, the
syncopation of jazz, the connection
between (or lack of it) Eur & Afr music
very interesting & sensational yellow
journalism.
