Martin Point, S. C.

Dear Mrs. Wilson:

This is to acknowledge a statement of the costs of a
performance of Plantation Echos which you furnished Mr.
John Lomax and which he transmitted to us. I must remind
you that none of these expenses were authorized by the
Library but I shall be glad to take this matter up with
the Librarian of Congress when he returns from his vacation
next month and communicate with you again at that time.

Very truly yours,

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
