Clan Chiefs
[D?] by Neil Gunn
The Butcher's Broom
The actual chief might betray
them but the ancient idealized image
remainedâ€”the image of legend
Is this a good thing?  At this the
Bard and the young man come into
conflict.

Bullet Proof coat ... After a battle, the
soldier would shake off the bullets from 
his coat. the way (?) he'd shake off 
snowflakes -- because he carried
a small round stone from the head
of an otter.

Alovely summer shieling of one tree
Behind the wind, in front of the sun
Where we could see the world all
But where no man could us see
