I seem to have have to depend on - money.
How horrible that is - to
have been reduced to the money
in one's pocket for home &
friends and security.
Last night as the night
before I lay in my room and
hoped that the women in 
nearby rooms would come
knocking on my door -  then
I masturbated on both 
nights & slept profoundly.
Last night I dreamt of
Elizabeth being in bed with
me. Then this morning lay
in bed till 11. And, when
I was asked to move (as
my room had been booked
only for two nights), I spent 
the whole day till now 3
looking frantically & hysterically
