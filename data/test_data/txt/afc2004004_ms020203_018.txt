[*Don't careish*] 
[*Fitts will do a good job on you when he starts*]
[*He get*] whiskey in him and he get don't-careish. "I don't care if I do." 
I know just bout how he feel. He just go on and do. And he say
hissef, "I know they gon put me in jail, "but I'm gon do it. I'm
gon fix up a good job of it. Then I won't be worried if they
put me in there." An he always says, if you have to anything like
fighting, just don't touch it, just don't just shove him
around. Say, just mommick him up, because you've got to go to
jail anyhow.
Did Rich ever get into any trouble?
Not as I knows of. (Material ommitted)  I asked him, 
I say Rich how come you sing about your Black Woman. He say,
that's when his woman quit him and run off. He's just lonesome
round in the field and he just holler and sing. Didn't know
nothin' else to do. Had to work. So he'd just sing, because he
was worried and bothered about her.
When did you first get to know Rich Amerson?
Well, I knowed Rich Amerson all my life. When we was just little
childrens around home, he just always has come to my mother's
and father's house. He didn't live there. He come there maybe an
stay two or three days. But he'd leave and then we wouldn't see
him any more for three or four months, wouldn't know where he was.
So, first thing you know, he'd come walkin' up one evening or 
maybe one night. Stay two three days with us.
Sleep in the house?
Sometimes. If it was cold he'd sleep in the house. Real cold.
He'd sleep in the house on the flo by the fire. But hot weather
