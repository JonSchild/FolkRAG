After arranging to go on a cow hunt
with the boys next day, my
host took me back to the Hearst
headquarters ranch house. As
he showed me to my room
he said: "We [usually keep] used to keep
this reserved for young William
Randolph Hearst when he visited
the ranch. But we don't
see so much of him now
that he is running so many
big newspapers." The [bed was] four
[a] huge, tall bed posts supported
a mattress high up
from the floor. I first stepped
on a chair to get into the
bed. Since that night one of
my chief claims to fame has
been that I once slept in the
bed of William Randolph Hearst.
