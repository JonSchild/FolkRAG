New York 12, New York

Dear Sir:

We have been retained by Mr. Nat Rahmings of
this city to write you regarding the release of certain
recordings transcribed at Williamsburg, Va. during the
summer of 1960.

Two of the recorded songs, "Bimini Gal" and
"Walk On The Bay", were written and sung by Mr. Rhamings
and are his exclusive property.

On April 28, 1960, prior to the recordings of the 
above songs, Mr. Rahmings requested and you provided him
with a letter in which you agreed not to use any of the
recordings for commercial purposes without Mr. Rahmings'
consent.

The release of the recordings to Prestige, Inc.
is unauthorized as it was done without Mr. Rahmings'
consent. You are directed to withdraw said records until
a release is obtained from our client.

Very truly yours,
[signed]
A. DAN. KILLIAN, JR.
