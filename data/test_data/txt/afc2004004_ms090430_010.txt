Arkansas City a spillway should be provided into a floodway 
through the Boeuff Basin, diverting a large portion of the 
floods from the main channel of the river.
          The people of Arkansas objected to this provision 
of the act and the floodway location was in 1936 changed to 
the Lensos Basin in eastern Louisiana. Objection was later 
raised to this location or to any diversion through Arkansas 
or Louisiana.
          In the meantime, cutoffs, shortening the river and 
increasing its efficiency had lowered the flood plane around 
nine feet at Arkansas City.
          In his report of this year, the president of the 
River Commission, General Max Tyler, stated that it is now 
possible to build levees along that reach of the river to 
safely contain the theoretical super flood. To carry out 
this plan, it would be necessary to raise the levees on 
the Mississippi side of the river from the Coahoma-Bolivar County 
line to Vicksburg and on the Arkansas and Louisiana side from 
the vicinity of Yan Copin, Arkansas to the mouth of Red River. 
General Tyler proposed a one foot freeboard above the flow 
line of the project or super flood for both sides of the river. 
Mississippi now objected because the differential in levee grades 
she had enjoyed under the existing law would disappear and both sides 
would be in equal danger of crevasse should a flood of sufficient 
magnitude occur.
          During the past year every effort has been made by 
your levee interests to prevent the enactment into law of legislation
