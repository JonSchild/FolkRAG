BJ TAPE 7A, p.6

I offered to throw that thing back in there.  I had never
caught one like that; he was a drum!  Hah, I didn't know what it
was, ha, ha!  Boy, I was so scared.
     An' so they all tol' me what it was an' [we] they kep' 'im.  But I, 
I has yet to look at that fish.  I didn't like that thing!  He
looked like he was talkin'.  An' ah, so, an' that, sumpin' tol'
me, say, "You got no business fishin' on Sunday, nohow!"  Hah,
that fish talkin!
     An' but I stopped.  I didn't fish anymore.  I just watched them
fish.  I didn't want to catch nothin' else sounded like that.
An' so one of the boys caught a great big ol' fish.  Somethin'
was on [it...so...] his hook an' he was pullin' on it an' he had to take his
time to pull it, it was so large.  And so finally he -- I seed the
thing when it weighed over in the water, 'cause I was up there,
I could see down there good.  I seed the thing.  I said, "Turn
it loose; let it alone; you got a cow!  It's a cow!  Turn 'im
loose.  Oh, God, ya got a cow!  Turn 'im loose."
     So, hah, they didn't pay me no mind.  They pulled it on up.
It was a great, big um, um, stingeree.  That thing was, ooo was wide as,
I don't know how wide.  Jus' a great big [ol'] thing.  An' ah, they,
they brought 'im on up, ya know, an put 'im on his back, you
know.  An' they got the hook outa him.  That knife, that thing
he got, [just] that thing was jus' glittering against the sun.
Oow, that was a big thing!  I, I was scared that day.  He looked
just like a cow comin' up out the water.  You know, that eye...
Ha, ha, ha!  I said, "Turn 'im loose.  Hit's a cow!" And I didn't
know but that was the wuss Sunday I ever had in my life.  I
figured, hah, you know, I figured all those things had happened
'cause I was down there fishin' on a Sunday.  That what I figured!
