Anecdote

Two girls went to a U.S.O.
dance. When they got there no
one asked them to dance. They
were just hoping some one would
come up and asked them to dance.
All the soldiers had girls to
dance with but one soldier was
talking with a girl and tickling
her chin. They girls saw this
and one said to the other, "I
think he's a Chief Petting Officer-
or something like that" She said
this because she was so mad
that no soldier danced with her.
