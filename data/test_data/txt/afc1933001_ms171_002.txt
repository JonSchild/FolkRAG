Dear Alan:
After several conferences with Messrs. Seeger, Hanke and Thomson 
with regard to recording in South America, certain things have become 
apparent. For one thing, all the genglemen involved want you to go to 
Brazil. They feel that is the largest country for folk lore and because 
of its large negro population the one that would interest you 
most. We realize of course that even if you had a full year in South 
America you could not cover a country as large as that. I have been 
thinking in terms of a trip of about six months and feel that you 
could do quite a bit of interesting work there.
My only fear is that of language. I believe that you can speak 
some Spanish but have not heard of any fluency in Portuguese. I told 
the others, of course, that a smart boy like you could master 
Portuguese in about three days and I really think that with your background 
in Spanish you could learn it in short order. It was suggested 
that you go to the special summer school being held in Laramie, Wyoming 
this summer but I told them that I did not believe you would have the 
time. (Phil Cohen and Jerry are looking up details of the "documentary" 
program.)
Things are moving very fast here now. Lincoln Kirstein and his 
men will probably go to Argentina, Columbia and Venezuela leaving the 
field in Brazil clear for you and possibly Herskowitz if he decides 
to go South also. Kirstein will stop briefly in Chile with his 
machine but will indicate that you will probably come eventually for a 
more extended expedition.
There is still no word from the Senate but I am nevertheless optimistic. 
Please let me have an expression of opinion on these various 
matters as soon as possible.
Father was in for a moment on his way to Bryn Mawr and said that he 
would be here for Fenton's talk. Regards!
Sincerely, 
Harold Spivacke
