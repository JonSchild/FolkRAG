Roll 74 Bob Eller 1
AL: Tell us how you learned to play the mouth bow and about your
daddy and all that.
Bob: Oh, back when we kids were around home, we sat around the
fireside and play 'em and see which could outplay 'em -- which
could play the best. I always thought my daddy could beat us
playin', you know. So we'd begin to get out and hunt up a good
straight locust(?) and we'd whittle 'em out. Probably take a
hatchet to it down or (unint) most of this with a knife, you
know a real pocket knife (unint) 'em down. But he had (sentence
unintelligible). So seem like sound better do today. (?????)
But anyway, we'd a make them, we'd a build them with a big fire,
had a big fireplace. We fill it full of wood, you know, the winte
time. We'd sit and warm our feet and play the thing around the
fireside. We had a wonderful time back then.
AL: But daddy taught you how to do it. Who was he and what did
he do for a living?
Bob: Grady(?) Eller, he farmed all his life. We raised here on the
farm mostly (unint). I went off to the service, stayed a hitch,
come back. Then I went to work with the timber then finally wound
up (unint) dusters up here, that's where I retired. So I got
'bout three years ago, I told my wife, I told her, "I'm gonna make
me a song bow" I hadn't though of one in a good long while.
So I got out and (unint) had me one whittled out, put me string
on it so I could play. Now this here is made out of a walnut,
black walnut. So I usually get a locust(?) to make 'em out of,
which I got in my car now, I brought this thing (unint) high toned
as that one is (unint.)
