BESSIE JONES TAPE 14

This is a two-sided tape at 7 1/2 IPS.  Interview on SIDE I by
Alan Lomax (with Antoinette Lomax).  Interview on SIDE II by
Antoinette Lomax.  Recorded in New York City on October 8, 1961.
Transcription by Dena Hirsch.

NOTE:  Entire tape very poorly recorded with Bessie very far
from the mike; therefore many corrections, question marks and
blank spaces in transcription.  Possibly a little more of the
dialogue may be discerned if tape is listened to through high-
fidelity speakers.  DH.

SIDE I
1/2 a page on "stump-knocking preachers."

Home-made whiskey and wines, 1 page.

A lot about dreams, especially Bessie's, including:  BJ's first
remembered dream;  dream revealing her 2nd husband, their marriage
and her subsequent life in the church.  Interwoven with this
story is:

Her first meeting with George Jones;  their courtship.

Dreams (Cont.)  Recurring dreams;  prophetic dreams;  two recent
dreams.

Christmas in Dawson, including a discourse on interior decoration
(home-made wall paint and rugs, counterpanes and pillow shams).

SIDE II
Continues Christmas and also pillow shams and tree quilts.
Xmas food (including STORY:  Why Cabbages Smell Rotten -- from
a similar Bible or Apochropha story --).  Also includes charming
story of Bessie at 8 years at Xmas.

Brief tangents;  Mortification of human corpses.  Opinions on
sports and movies.

Now, Fourth of July in Dawson.  Easter.  Ends with description
of the "sun shouting," on Easter and Christmas.
