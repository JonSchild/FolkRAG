4. Heard in Stuttgart, Ark.--8/4/42:
"They tell me that we are going to have 750 Negro cadets stationed
at this school and that white men are going to do the menial jobs.
There will be plenty of trouble if that is the case. I hear that
they have been having race riots down at Montgomery, Alabama and
that they have had to shoot a bunch of niggers."
