Unfortunately some people do have personal friends working
for them, some supervisors are sensitive to political pressure.
That is where the union comes in, on behalf of both the government
and the employee.
Fifteen out of thirty persons had to be let go this July first.
But when the fifteen who were to go received their notices all of
them let out a howl and said they had been discriminated against.
About half of them went directly to their union adjustment committee.
After studying the situation the adjustment committee prepared
a statement covering all the persons in the office. The length of
each person's service was set forth; his official efficiency ratings,
and, of course, the report indicated which persons had been let go.
Discrimination does creep into the government service sometimes,
and discrimination had gotten in there. But as the result
of the study and a conference with the chief of the section the
inequities were adjusted. A fair method for selecting the persons
to be dismissed was worked out, and it seemed to meet
with everyone's approval. No one likes to be fired, and no one
cheers when he is fired, but most of these people thought that they
had been treated fairly.
At the same time the dismissals were discussed, incidentally, an
agreement was reached in which the department agreed to re-employ
the people let go as soon as new jobs in the department
opened up.
If government administrators meet union adjustment committees
and deal with them responsibly, they can be sure that the
adjustment committees will sift the complaints. The adjustment
committees themselves will eliminate frivolous or unreasonable
complaints. It will bring up similar cases together and generalize
them for adjustment.
Procedures and precedents will be established. Many causes
for grievances will be eliminated merely as the result of the
publication of the agreements reached between the adjustment
committees and the administrative officers.
