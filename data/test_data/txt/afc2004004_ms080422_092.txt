Tape:  897 cont. Nimrod Workman   2

You will. . . . . . . . .with no man
When 7 long years has passed and over
Then I'll cross the raging main.

Them 7 long years had passed and gone
And the age you were be turning on
She took her gold staff in her hand
To see Lord Bateson in a foreign land.

She travelled till she came to Lord Bateson's dwelling
There she rapped most modestly
Who's there, who's there, cried the proud young porter
That eruption make these old valleys ring.

She said, is this the place where Lord Bateson dwells
Or is your noble lord within.
Yes oh yes, cried the proud young porter
But he just this day took a new bride in.

She said go ask him for three crusts of bread.
One bottle of most sumptuous wine.
And ask him if he do not remember
Who freed him from them cold iron bounds.

He went, this proud young porter run
Fell down on his bended knee
                             Lord Bateson said
Sweet Shuslempine has crossed the sea.

Oh he begin to describe her (spoken)
She has a gay gold ring on every finger
And round her neck gold diamonds three
She's got gold up around her neck
To buy your bride and her company,

Lord Bateson he went from his table
                                               he split all three

That my two eyes did ever see
                                                       (spoken line?)
Curse Shuslempine the old man said 
Curse Shuslempine from cross the sea
Would you foresake your new wedded wife
for that Shuslempine from across the sea.
