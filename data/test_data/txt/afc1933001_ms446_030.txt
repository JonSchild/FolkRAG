To the last sacred verse we sing?
Christ is coming back, my sisters,
Our dear loved ones, he will bring.

THE BLIND WIDOW
My friends and neighbors, here I stay,
Sick and blind from day to day,
No satisfaction do I find,
No place to go to ease my mind.

Now, children, all be good and true,
The Lord will show you what to do,
For he is a friend indeed,
A true friend in time of need.

Your father's dead, your mother's blind,
No one to treat you good and kind,
Now don't let this grieve your heart,
For the best of friends have to part.

Now children I have often told
My father and mother are getting old,
Their days but few, their pleasures past,
And to their graves they are going fast.

I have often heard them weep and cry,
We are getting old, and have to die.
Now children treat them good and kind,
Your father is dead and your mother blind.

Sometimes I think I am in the way,
I'll praise the Lord from day to day,
There is one thing that does me good,
To hear the blessed word.

The deaf to hear, the lame to walk,
The blind to see, the dumb to talk,
