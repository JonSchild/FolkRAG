No. 4. Business group secretary - Al Gugedahl, secretary, Rotary Club, Hotel
Fort Des Moines, Des Moines, Iowa. 
There is inclosed Mr. Gugedahl's compilation of rumors. Mr. Gugedahl is
a veteran of the last war, very congenial to theidea and impressed with its value,
skeptic when I first talked to him that such a program could be well handled on
just a week's review and inclined to feel it should be a continuing process. He
expressed complete willingness to cooperate again and felt it was not an unnecessary 
amount of work. 
He questioned that he was in contact with as many business men as he should
be in order to be a good source. He said, "Perhaps we are lacking in war consciouness,
because I tried to ferret out reactions and made little progress. There were
a few personal opinions expressed which were so far fetched and so obviously motivated
by unreasonable obsessions that I didn't include them. Yesterday, for example, I
talked to my two neighbors, one a lawyer and the other a school teacher, and I asked
what they thought about the war situation and how long they would be able to spend
Sunday afternoon tinkering around their back yards, and I got absolutely no reaction
for them except a shrugging dismissal of the problem. I ran into young ________
whose brother is in the Navy and who is about to enlist himself. I asked him what
he had heard from his brother and he referred to an expensive telephone call which
the boy had made because he was homesick, but there was no further reaction."
