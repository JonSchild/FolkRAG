Q. About wrist or right hand being broken 
A. Yeh I broke that wrist in North Carolina, I was carrying on a revival and I slipped down - I was going along one night & there was snow on the ground - when I stepped up on a bank of snow and my foot slipped and to keep from falling I was shuffling, I stuck my hand on an "iron water dog" I didn't know it was broke until I went to the doctor the next morning and he told me it was broke

He put me up on the table and put me to sleep and when I woke up he had a cast slammed up to my elbow.

I lost the use of that hand for a long time - I thought I was never going to be able to play no more - but I did.

You can't give (nobody) somebody (something) something that you don't know nothing about

Ever try picks on your fingers - You know a guitar won't take any (type) kind of picks
