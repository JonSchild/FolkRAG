REED  Yeah, we're six brothers.
FRIEND  We had 128 cows.  Everyone went to [fox trot with] [UNCLEAR]
LOMAX  What?
FRIEND  Most [INAUDIBLE], yes.  And we had 12 mules.  All the mules was
tamed.  I was a bronco buster.  He was a bronco buster, and two of my other brothers.
And some time a little calf was too skinny to buck, we'd put some terpentine
on his tail and he had to [pull].  [UNCLEAR] with a cold [cow].

all knew their name.  You could, you could call them and they, they'd come right
there.  And the calf, too.  The calf, early in the morning the big [UNCLEAR]
was in the field. . .
:  Oh yeah.
FRIEND  I'd call him and, chica, chica, chica, chica, and that little calf
would say maaa.  I knew exactly where he was in the big fog.  And the cow, the
milk cow, we [need] seven cows to get one gallon milk.  And that was seven calfs
and so dumb, the calfs and the mule would drink the milk in the bucket [LAUGHS]
before we get it.
REED  And the milk was bitter.

LOMAX:  Yeah.  Oh that [INAUDIBLE]
:  The first one I'll, I'll talk, there's some [UNCLEAR].  There was
a man, he was 70 years old, you know, 70 years of age.  And he told his neighbors
that he was a, he felt like when he was 20, you know.  Oh, they say old man,
you're just blowing off steam.  They say you don't feel that way.  No, he said
I really do, he says.  So one day they're talking to the doctor, you know, and the
doctor gave him a good examination.  He says how old are you?  He said I'm 70
years old, doc.  He says you know you have the constitution of a 20 year old man?
He said I told that to my neighbors.  He said they wouldn't believe me.  The
doctor said well, he says it's incredible.  He said I've never seen that on a man
of your age.  He said what are you doing?  He said I'm retired, doc.  He says
you must have some sort of exercise, he says, to keep in shape like you are.  Oh
yes, he says, me and pop, he says, we take six and seven runs a day, that's every
[day. He said that's a good exercise. He says you
and your pop? He says how old is your pop?] Pop is 90. He said just a minute,
I want to examine him.  He says go and get him.  No, he say he won't be able to
come today.  He says, doc, he says for what reason, is he sick?  No, he said, papas
going to the wedding.  He said pop's, daddy is getting remarried today.  He
says you know, he says, he says your papa's daddy is getting remarried?  That's
correct.  He says how old is he?  He says 110, doc.  Oh no, he said, there's some
mistake somewhere.  He says nobody over 110 years old would want to get remarried.
He says, he says, doc, he wasn't all that anxious but he says he had to.
