Mr. Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
Office of War Information
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Katz:

            This will acknowledge your letter of August 6,
addressed to Mr. Graves, concerning release of our
material to Mr. Robert H. Knapp of the Massachusetts
Committee on Public Safety. We have never considered
ourselves authorized to issue our confidential reports
to any agency or individual other than those in the
Federal Government. We have understood that other
agencies, within their own good discretion and authorization, 
could do so. Thus, if you wish to release
material to outside agencies, you should request that
your own receipt of our Report be increased by a sufficient 
number of copies to meet outside requests. In 
the past, such arrangements, for example, have been
made by the Coordinator of Information.

            In connection with Mr. Knapp, I should remark
that, the committee with which he is associated has a
connection with the Boston Daily Herald, and I suggest
that particular care be taken that this material not
be made available to the Herald.

                                                 Sincerely yours,

                                                 [*Robert D. Leigh*]

                                                 Robert D. Leigh
