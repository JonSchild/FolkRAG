Reverend Roe.  Reel 9.  P. 4
A:  And of course you also have to be worried that she's gonna turn against you.
R:  That's right.
A:  Turn some of the people against you -- tell [wives] lies on you.
R:  That's right.
A:  Women will do that, they sorta get so insulted at you when you turn them down, they're liable to do almost anything.
[*Women will work against you if you turn them down.*]
R:  Oh yeah.  I had them to do me that way.  Yes sir.  They [said] say that I tried to rape them [al  l] all most and things like that.  But you've got to stand up; there's some danger in it.  To do right, brother, you must [put] bear on some hard[ness]ship; you've got it to do.  Sometimes you'll have to 
run away and leave a place, yeah, just because you won't do wrong.  Some ofmy worst prosecutions come that way.  Say, for an instance, you're in a church and there's a woman there that wants you to lay around with her, and you refuse to do it, and finally she'll turn against you and accuse you of every woman she sees you talking with and just talk about you.  And generally it's a woman that has some influence in the church, and she'll turn lots of people same time against you.  It's kinda hard; 
[it] and it makes some [men] ministers to fall, and make up with her and [get along] go to [? ]with her to [make] for her to hush, yes sir.
A:  Has any of those women actually prevailed against you and helped to drive you out of a congregation?
R:  They did it right here, oh yeah.  The worst fight I've ever had here was just along that line.
A:  Tell me about it.
R:  Well, there's a woman that she wanted me to lay up there with her, 
[*A woman accuses him to the church*] and I refused to do it, and because I wouldn't, you know, she [was] began [gonna] to get mad with me, you know, and she would watch my huse and every 
woman she'd see go in there, she'd accuse me of em, you know.  And there's a girl that live right here close to this church -- she have two children now.
