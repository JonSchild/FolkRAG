And old home scenes of my childhood,
In fond memory appears.

In the stillness of the midnight,
Echoes from the past I hear; 
Old-time singing, gladness bringing, 
From that lonely land somewhere.

As I travel on life's pathway,
Know not what the years may hold; 
As I ponder, hope grows fonder, 
Precious mem'ries flood by soul. 

No.  13     Rebecca 

There is going to be a wedding
Somewhere up in the air, 
I have an invitation to attend; 
It will be the rich young Isaac 
And his sweet Rebecca fair; 
Say, oh won't that be a happy wedding day! 

CHORUS 

Oh, get ready, the evening shadows fall, 
Oh, don't you hear that Eleazar call? 
There is going to be a wedding 
So be free from every sin
And be ready when the camel train comes in.

I can see the faithful servant
As he leads Rebecca fair
To her waiting husband Isaac far away; 
As he leads the ugly camel
