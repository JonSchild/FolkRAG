Dear Neil,
     I'm very upset that you haven't done anything about
the mouth bows that you promised you'd get made for us.
Shirley is going back to England after the first week in 
January and she wanted to take two back as prsents for her
friends. Please can you do something about this right away?

     I've been working on the very complicated job of
marketing the whole huge collection I recorded in the south.
So far I have arranged for a series of six albums to be
done by Atlantic Records, and in this, I want to include
one or two songs of yours, definitely Little Moses and Jesse
James. I can pay you an advance of $15 per song, plus your
share of the performer's royalties as they come due.
   
      I need a formalletter of agreement in order for me
to market the rest of the songs. This letter covers publication
of these songs so that you can receive your royalties as
composer or arranger. You may strike this paragraph out of 
the contracts if you and Jimmy so desire. Jimmy and I both
felt it might be more convenient if your songs were put
through his company, so that he could use them freely in
his own recording sessions.
    
      I can't say yet at what rate I can market the rest of
your performances, but I'll do my damndest for you.

     All the best, and Merry Christmas, and say hello to
old "By Jude" Charlie when you collect the mouthbows from
him.
                                                      Alan Lomax.
