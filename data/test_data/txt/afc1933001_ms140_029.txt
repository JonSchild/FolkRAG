Dr. Louise Pound of the Univ.
of Nebraska] A number of farmers' songs

Rickaby in Songs and Ballads of
the Shanty Boy. Another interesting
group of occupational songs
has been gathered by I.H. Walton
of the Univ. of Michigan. A volume
is shortly to be published on
the subject but he might be willing
