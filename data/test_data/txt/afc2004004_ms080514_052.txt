[*O5 . 01 . 03 . 02*]     A  [*[*] Of course the blues has ah mo - many faces and
many guises and many ways of being performed 
and, and Sam's is a far cry from that of ah
Jack Owens, who performs like an African bard
with the variation from verse to verse, from
phrase to phrase.  [*[*] Sam ah takes one of a - a
light approach to things.  Ah, every st - 
verse is sung pretty much to the same tune,
and, ah his idea is to get the text over, so
you con't miss a syllable.  Words are important
in that tradition, [*]*] the lyrics, and ah a story
line.  And the ah the guitar goes along with
a nice stea - steady accompanying style,
instead of ah all kinds of improvisations
and comments and polyrythmic asides and so 
on, as we saw with Jack.
