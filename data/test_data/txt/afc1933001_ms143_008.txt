Dear Mr. Hanna, 
The Library of Congress has accumulated in its Archive 
of American Folk Song a large amount of material which would 
be , I should think, very helpful in preparing the studyto
which you refer. Unfortunately, however, most of this material 
is contained on master phonograph records which we have no means 
of duplicating at present. 
In lieu of this material, however, I can suggest several 
references from which you may obtain valuable suggestions. 1)
The American Journal of Folk Lore, Volume Iff.. 2)The Southern 
Folk Lore Quarterly, which has many valuable bibliographic 
suggestions. 3) The Publications of the Texas Folk Lore Society. 
4) The Journal of the Folk Lore Society of the North East. 4) 
The American Songbag, Carl Sandburg. 5) American Ballads and 
Folk Songs, by John A. and Alan Lomax , in which as an appendix 
you will find a fairly comprehensice bibliography with many 
references to books and articles [?] on the folk music 
of different parts of America. 6) Bibliography of American 
Folk Songs, by Mellinger Henry. 7) Folk Songs of America, Robert 
W. Gordon, obtainable from the National Service Bureau of the 
Federal Theatre Project, New York City. 
I hope that among these references you will find the type 
of information you need. 
Sincerely yours, 
Alan Lomax
