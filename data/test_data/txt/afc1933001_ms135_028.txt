Mr.  Theodore Blegen
Minnesota Historical Society
St. Paul, Minn.

Dear Mr. Blegen:

Thank you for your kind inv[e]itation. I am very 
sorry that I will not be in St. Paul for your lecture of 
the 14th. The material in your volume on Norwegian 
immigrant ballads is extremely interesting and I hope that 
I shall be able to record some of it in my work this 
summer.

It has been necessary to postpone my trip for some 
days but I shall leave somtime before the first of August 
and should be in  Minnesota at the very latest by the first 
of September. I hope you will be somewhere in the state at 
that time. I have already written Miss Edgar and I suppose 
I will hear from her as soon as she feels able to write. 
Perhaps she will be well again by the time I have worked through 
Michigan and Wisconsin. Please let me know what your plans are 
for the latter part of August and early part of September so 
that I can hurry on to Minnesota if you are to be away.

Thanking you again for your kind letter,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
