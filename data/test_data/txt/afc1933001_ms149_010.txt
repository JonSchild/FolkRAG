September 12, 1939.

Dear Mr. Lomax:-

In reply to your letter of September 9th,
I would say that I am very glad to have the Music
Division of the library use any of my chanties that are
in my chanty book. There are two or three other
chanties, but I think my chanties will give the idea of
what chanties meant in the days of sail. You have my
permission to use anything of mine.

Very truly yours,
Stanton H. King
