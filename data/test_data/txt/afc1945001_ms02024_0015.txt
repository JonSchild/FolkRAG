There has been trouble in Macon with Negro soldiers from 
the North who want to date white girls.  Some of them went to a white pool 
room and were refused admittance.  [*5*] 

They said, "Isn't our money as good as theirs?"  The owner 
said, "Maybe, but I don't want it."  When they insisted, he said, "It isn't 
a matter of money, but of the law."  [*1*] 

The white soldiers in the place got mad and told them to go.  


No knives can be bought in Norfolk, Virginia.  The Negroes 
have purchased all that there are.  [*5*]
