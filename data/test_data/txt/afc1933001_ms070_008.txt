Mr. Alan Lomax,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Alan:
    Your father told me that if I would write you, that
you would help me put through copyright for a piece of music
I have composed.
    Could you give me some idea about how I should have the
music prepared, that is, how to have the music in shape, when I
send it to you to present to the copyright-office there in
Washington.?
    Your father and I are very good friends, and I was also
a very good friend to Miss Betty Robinson, who taught school
in Tascosa about 40 years ago, and Miss Betty seemed to be a distant
relative of you folks, anyway, I'm a friend to your father.
    If you will please write me, how to prepare the music, then
I shall send you the copyright fee, and will thank you for your
kindness.

    Your friend, Jess Morris
