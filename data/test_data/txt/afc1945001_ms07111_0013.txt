A Methodist Bishop in Denver who in the past has been very 
active in "America First" organizations and given his blessing to
prominent spokesmen such as Senator Wheeler, has been quoted as
raising his voice again in the defense of Axis nations. His line
of talk is about as follows:
"Perhaps Hitler and Japan have broken treaties but let's
look at the record. How about England and the United States?
They don't have lily white reputation in regard to treaties and
their treatment of other nations down through history. If the
United States and England had clean hands why they could make a
better case for themselves." 24 8-7
