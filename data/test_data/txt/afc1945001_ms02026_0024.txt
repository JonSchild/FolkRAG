Study of the Chicago Press (Continued)  3

shift away from isolationism in those persons who changed to the new newspaper
and that, on the contrary, those persons who stuck to the Tribune were
definitely influenced in its direction. One of the major purposes of the
Study of the Chicago Press is to carry further this determination of the 
influence of the different newspapers. In particular, we should like to 
estimate the influence of the Chicago Tribune on this part of the Middle 
West.
 The technique for obtaining these results would involve a combination 
of polling and content analysis. When Dr. Kornhauser has completed
two or three opinion surveys we will examine the results to determine on
which questions marked changes of opinion took place. We will then determine
if there is any differential in the amount of change for readers of 
different newspapers. So far, all this information can be obtained from
the poll results. The final step, however, would be to content analyze the
Chicago papers for the period involved to determine how much and what kind
of difference there was between the treatment of the relevant topics in
the different newspapers. The results could then be related to the poll
results, and an estimate made of the effectiveness of the devices and approaches
used by the different papers. On the basis of those conclusions
suggestions could be made about government information policy, and about
effective and ineffective appeals.
