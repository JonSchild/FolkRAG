TAPE:  R-83 cont.     5

AL:  and next to you is John Hicks, have you known each other
a long time.
Man:  We've known each other several years actually, 5 or 6 years 
years ago we began rabbit hunting together.
Man:  We've known each other about 20 years.
AL:  You've been a rabbit hunter all your life?
Man:  All my life.
AL:  What's your best rabbit story that you can remember.
Man:  Well, lord, I don't know.  I've had so many.  There's
been so many good ones.  We went the other day to run ours,
we got a good race started, and they kept running, kept running,
and the guys with us said "I believe that's the best race
I ever heard, hasn't been a break has there?"  "No." I guess
in 30 ft, of the trap we heard something holler.  And we run out
there to see what it was and I squatted down and there was a big
ole cat sitting up in there.  One of the dogs - I got pretty
good size dogs, and I said "Get him." And he run up there and
the cat slapped him, he run back to me and knoced me down, and 
Bill Higgins run up there and looked there and said, "Lord, we ain't
got nothing but little old cat dogs."
Man:  Tell him about Louis Jackson down there the time. . . . .
One night we was running down the river and was taped, that's the 
first time we'd taped one.  And we had a good tape, so we finally
had a break.  We decided we'd re-run it and see how it sounded.
