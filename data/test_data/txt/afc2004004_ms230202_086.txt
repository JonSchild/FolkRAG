BLUES - 83

NATCHEZ:  yeah, speakin' of Chicago Defender, I were. .I were in a 
place called-uh Marigold, Mississippi, an', you know, t-they
had a restaurant in there an' in the back they had
a-a peephole an' I thought they were gam'lin'.  Fact I
was kinda stranded.  I wanted to go back there an' shoot
a little craps an' make me a little stake.  An' you can
imagine what they were doin' back there!  They were readin'
the Chicago Defender an' had a man on the do'!
SIB:  Look-out man.
NATCHEZ:  Yeah, look-out man on the door with a peephole, so-an' if
a-if a white man or something come in the restaurant. . .

NATCHEZ:  . . .they'd stick the Defender in the stove. . .
SIB:  Yeah!
