Mr. Alan Lomax 
124 West 12th Street
New York City 
Dear Mr. Lomax 
I was very pleased to hear of your progress with the various 
recording companies. It was my idea, however, that before you 
actually listened to the records,that you survey the many catalogs 
and check the items which appeared to you to be of interest. This 
will give us some idea then of the extent of the material and 
allow us to plan accordingly. It is possible that you have already 
done this. If so, can you send me the catalogs for my perusal? 

Mr. Clarke is now here but I have not had time to discuss folk 
songs with him as yet. 

For some time I have been trying to convince Mr. Davidson 
Taylor of the feasibility of just such a plan as you suggest. My 
idea was to circulate these by electrical transcriptions into the 
various local stations. Is this what he has in mind? 

I am inclined to believe that some form of leave might be 
arranged after this semester is over. You will undoubtedly be interested 
to know that the Librarian himself signed your application 
to the Council, thereby assuming sponsorship. 

Father's trip has been fully approved and we will rush him the 
apparatus as fast as possible. 
Sincerely, 
Harold S.
