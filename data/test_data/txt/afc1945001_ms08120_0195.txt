    This is a joke about a
soldier. One day, when they were
drilling. This soldier he just stood
still and the major wanted to know
what was wrong. And the soldier
wouldn't said anything he just
stood there looking at the major.
So the "Major said "You will march
or I will put you in the guard
house. And then the soldier began
to throw his shoes off one by
one, he said, I will march but
I wont march with shoes on.
