Dear Mr. Lomax:- 
Replying to your letter of September 14th, you made it quite clear to me, but I did not want to tell you just then that I have been troubled with heart disease for the last two years. Sometimes I am thrown down in bed and incapable of singing chanties or anything else. If I were my old self I would say "yes, let us sing chanties as we did in the day when we were setting the topsail yard after a heavy gale". However, my day of chanty  singing is ended and I am ready to shove off and will be glad to go when the good Lord calls me. 
I know just what you want as I have had professors from Harvard come to the Sailors' Haven and the old shell-backs would sing chanties to the phonograph records that they brought with them. I don't recall the names of any of these men now or where you could locate any of these things I did for them. I am sorry I cannot help you.
Sincerely yours,
