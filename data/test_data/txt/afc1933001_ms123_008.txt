My dear Mr Strunk:
The second volume of the Pennsylvania
German Folklore society is now being 
set up. The photostats from the Turtle
"Taube" and the "Wunderspiel" have been most 
help-ful in finding the meaning to the 
illuminations. We feel certain that our thesis 
is correct. The volume will contain more 
than 200 illustrations.
We should like to have the use of the 
plate or cut for the illustration, opposite
page 112, Library of Congress Report, 1927.
This illustration illustrates quite intensively 
the meaning of this way of illumination
