Meat Shortage

A smart dressed lady steped in the grocery
store and saw a man getting meat which was
just fine, beause meat was just what she
wanted. The store keeper said, "What will you
have madam? She said "Oh! I would like to
have some meat, have you any steak? "Sure," replied
the keeper. "I'd like to have a peice about 3 inches
thick," said the woman. I also want some chops 
about ten lbs. please and some hamburger about
20 lbs and will you pleas give me some a
nice jiucey tender roast I should say about
25 lbs." "Oh and I almost forgot my dog give
me 50 lbs of hamburger for him." "Is that all,"
aked the keeper? Yes said the lady. Oh I 
cant take all of this home myself will you
offer me some sort of transportation. "I would 
gladly," replied the keeper. But you have just 
bought my horse.
