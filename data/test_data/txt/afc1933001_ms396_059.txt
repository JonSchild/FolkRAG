me and one of the boys jamed right on the edge that was south Bosque.
I want to tell you we never heded there any more nor any creek where
it was rough. I will send the song in another cover as too bulky.
If I have not got it connected right please connect it to suit yourself.

Mr. Grigsby's two letters read in connection with his song will give a cowboy
trail driver's picture of some of the incedents of going up the trail. His
geography, also, is correct.

At Goliad in seventy-eight
I worked upon the range,
Our head boss was Joe Taylor
The rest was under him.
We filled two contracts
Of fours and fives
To go out on the trails.
The third bunch was cut back on us,
And those we had to drive.
Our nearest market was Ft. Worth.
Our trail Boss was named Ward.
"We have two months to make it in,
I want them looking good."

Go down the Chisum trail,
The trail the gogies go down;
Look down look down the Chisum trail,
The trail the Indians lay around.

The first town was Gonzalus,
A noted old cowboy town;
After we passed them through that place
We began to strike open ground.
We pulled on up to Lockhart,
A famous old saddle tree town.
On the breaks of the Colorado
Below the capital, high water we found,
And when the cattle struck the current
They milled around and around.
We pointed the leader to the shore
The rest then followed on.

Our next town was Round Rock,
At the head of Brushy Creek.
They told us that was the town
Sam Bass had met his fate.
We passed on down to Taylor
On the International Road.
We were then getting out in the open
And were feeling pretty good.
We passed them through Belton
Just as the sun went down,
We whooped them up and dodged the inspector
And then we bedded down.
