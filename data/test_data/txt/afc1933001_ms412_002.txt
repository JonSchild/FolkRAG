A COWBOY SONG

Way out West on the lonesome trail,
Where man and his rope seldom ever fail,
We ride the range from sun to sun,
For a cowboy's work is never done.
Rain or shine, sleet or snow,
It's just a wild cowboy and bound to go.

We whoop at the sun and yell through the hail,
But we drive the poor dogies on up the trail;
and we'll laugh at the storms, the sleet and snow,
When we camp near the town of San Antonio.
Rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal is on the go.

Tired and hungry, far from home,
Just a poor cowboy and bound to roam;
Starless nights, lightning's glare,
Danger and darkness everywhere.
Rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal is on the go.

Drifting my Doney Gal round and round
The sleeping steers on the bedding ground;
Riding on night-herd all night long,
Singing them softly a cowboy song.
Rain or shine, sleet or snow,
A poor lonesome cowboy and bound to go.

A cowboy's life is a dreary thing, 
For its rope and brand and ride and sing;
Yes, day or night in the rain or hail,
He'll stay with his dogies out on the trail.
Rain or shine, sleet or snow,
A poor lonesome cowboy and bound to go.

Swimming the rivers across our way,
We push for the North Star day by day.
The stormcloud breaks - at furious speed
We follow the steers in their wild stampede-
Rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal a-bound to go.

Over the prairies lean and brown,
On through the wastes where there ain't no town;
Bucking the dust storms, wind and hail,
Pushing the loghorns up the trail;
Rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal a-bound to go.
