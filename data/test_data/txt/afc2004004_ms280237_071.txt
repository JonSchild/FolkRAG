If you go to Lowestoft, and ask for the Hole in the Wall,
They'll find Polly Armstrong, she ain't got a hole at all.
She was a rum one, she was a funny one, she was a rum one, oh.

At last I found her hole, it was underneath her frock,
If you gave me all the world, I couldn't find me cock. (refrain)

At last I found me cock, me cock was in my hand,
And if you gave me all the world, I couldn't get him to stand. (refrain)

At last I got him to stand, as stiff as a wooden pin;
If you gave me all the world, I couldn't get him in. (refrain)

At last I got him in, an' wriggled him about;
If you gave me all the world, I couldn't get him out. (refrain)

At last I got him out, he was so stiff an' sore,
And if you gave me all the world, I'd never touch another whore.
(spoken) if you like (refrain)

Lomax: But there's another way to begin that song, isn't there,
Harry?
Cox: Yeah.
Lomax: How does that go?
Cox: Like I said afore.
If you go to Lowestoft, an' ask for the Rising Sun,
There you will find two old whores, an' my old woman's one."
Lomax: That's a real rough one, uh?
Cox: Yeah.
Lomax: Sing that one in a pub, would you, Harry?
Cox: I have had. Yes. I have. . .I have so.
Lomax: Harry, tell me, when you were a young man, could you
fool around with the girls in the countryside, or did you have to go
to town, to get a whore?
Cox: Oh, they were all over the shop.
Lomax: What?
Cox: They rarely went to town for that intention, you see. They went
to towns                  . . .An' these here what lived that life, that
where you'd find it. There's not so much in the country.
Lomax: Couldn't you get a girl to - uh, give you a piece in
the country?
Cox: Oh yes, there was them about. Yes, that was goin' on.
Lomax: I mean, just the farming girls.
Cox: Oh yes, that was done.
Lomax: Very frequently. I mean, suppose you'd meet a girl out in the
fields?
Cox: Yes, there was some stout, just the same, but of course, the
town was the main part.
Lomax: You mean. . .
Cox: Yeah. I mean, of course, they do it for a living in thes town
