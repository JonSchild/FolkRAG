Very often you could hear of killing on top of killings -- that
wouldn't make any difference.  Many and many a time, myself,
I went on Saturday and Sunday and looked in the morgue and
see eight and ten men that was killed every Saturday night.  It
was nothing for eight and ten killings on a Saturday night.
Occasionally Buddy Bolden used to play in the Jackson
Hall, which was a much nicer hall, on the corner of Jackson
Avenue and Franklin in the Garden district.  Occasionally he
would play in the Lincoln Park - any time they could get him -
[*D*] [*[*]that is where they would have him, that is - any of those half-way
rough places.  I used to go out to Lincoln Park, myself,
when Buddy Bolden was out there, because I used to like to
hear him play and out-blow everybody.  I thought he was good,
myself.[*]*]
Any time there was a quiet night in the Lincoln Park [the] wh[?]
little places I used to hang out -- a corners- [or] what the boys used
to call a hang-out corner, on Jackson and S. Robertson- It
was about ten or twelve miles from the Lincoln Park- Any time 
that he had a quiet night, [all he] all he did was to take his trumpet
and turn it towards the city.
