DEVILISH MARY

I went up into London Town;
I spark a fair young lady;
I inquired about her name,
And they called her Devilish Mary.

Chorus:
Come-a-fo-la-ling, come-a-ling,  come-a-ling,
Come-a-fo-la-ling, come-a-diary.

Me and Mary begin to spark;
She got in a hurry;
Made it all up into her mind
That we'd marry the very next Thursday.

We hadn't been married but about two weeks,
Before we ought to been parted:
Every time I looked crossed-eyed,
She knocked me in the head with the shovel.

She washed my clothes with the old soap-suds;
She filled my bath with switches;
She let me know right at the start
She was gonna wear my britches.

One day I said to Mary.
"Oh we'd better be parted."
Just as soon as I said the word,
Bundled up her clothes and started.

She filled my heart with sadness;
She sewed my side with stitches; 
She jumped and she kicked and she popped her heels,
And she swore she'd wear my britches.

If I ever marry again in this wide world.
It'll be for love and not for riches;
Marry a little girl about two feet high,
So she can't wear the britches.

of added stanzas from Florida. 18A1 & 955 B1.
