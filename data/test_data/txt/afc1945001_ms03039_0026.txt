the particular project to which he refers is moving along in splendid
shape and is considered a model for other construction projects through
out the Middlewest.  Perhaps there is some waste of manpower on this
particular piece of work, but it not believed to exist to any great
extent....perhaps a certain amount of waste is unavoidable, nevertheless,
even that "certain amount" causes much comment and criticism of
Government spending even on defense work.

August 11.....It so happened the same kind of a story came
to us from a young woman who is also employed on one of the projects
now under construction near Grand Island.  She does legal work and
receives a very good pay check.  She said:

"I am making inquiry about the WAACS.....I want to join if
I can.  I am thoroughly disgusted at the utter waste that goes on at
these construction projects.  My work has taken me from one to the
other, and they are all alike.  If this waste of money continues, I
don't know what is going to happen.  For instance, unnecessary messages,
both telegraph and telephone, are flying back and forth all the
time.......people running around unnecessarily......wasted energy......
unnecessary employment....too many trying to do the same piece of
work, and all this at the Government's expense.  As a good American
citizen, at least, I'll have a clearer conscience if the WAAC'S will 
take me, and I don't mind giving up my good pay check either."  This
individual would seemed well qualified to speak and there might be
a certain amount of truth in her statements.

August 12......A highly respected Omaha businessman offered
the following comment in a friendly off-guard conversation:
