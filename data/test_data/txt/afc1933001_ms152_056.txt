Memo.

Dr. Harold Spivacke,
   Last summer in Michigan I met
Mrs. Joe Smith [near], Rt. 1, [near
the little village of] McMillan,
Michigan, who showed me her collection of
broadsides or songsheets, [It was the set
of sheets] published by J. Wehman and E. Nason
and Co., 50 Chatham Ave., [Ny] New York City. .
[As far as I have been able to discover this]
This collection was fairly complete.  I imagine
that perhaps fifty sheets were missing from
the series of 666 that [the lady was] Mrs. Smith
had.  The songs were largely popular in their
derivation, although among them I noted an occasional
folk-song.  I have consulted Dr.
Robert Gordon in the matter and he feels that
the collection is valuable.  Mrs. Smith
said at the time that she would be glad for the
Library to have this material but she would like
to realize something from the transaction.  I [strongly
urge] suggest that steps be taken to purchase the
collection.
