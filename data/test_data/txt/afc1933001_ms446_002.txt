WHITE SPIRITUALS

"Wondrous Love" and "Hick's Farewell" are borrowed from
THE SOUTHERN HARMONY AND MUSICAL COMPANION, by William Walker, a South
Carolinian. The book was first published in 1835. Of it the author says:
It contains "a choice collection of tunes, hymns, psalms, odes and anthems,
selected from the most eminent authors in the United States; together with
nearly one hundred new tunes which have never before been published,
(most of them were Walker's adaptations of old tunes)------suited to
Christian churches of every denominations singing schools, and private
societies; also an introduction to the grounds of music, the rudiments of
music, and plain rules for beginners."

With the music written in the old square, or shaped,
four-note [?], mi faw law sol. SOUTHERN HARMONY had a sale to Southern
folk over a period of twenty-five years. One writer remarks, "It was so
popular that it had to be kept in stock in the general stores along with
groceries and tobacco." In 1844 a large part of its song treasure was re-
printed in the SACRED HARP, still circulated among multiplied thousands
of singers who have taken the title of the book to distinguish the groups.
Singings are held first by communities, then by counties and districts, next
by states; and finally a regional meeting covers most of the Southern states.

"Singing Billy Walker" went over to the seven-note party
after the 1854 edition of his book, but could not carry his followers along.
At Benton, Kentucky, for fifty years old-fashioned harmony singing has been
practiced in the courthouse. The festival is held each year with thousands
of singers from Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri and Illinois.
