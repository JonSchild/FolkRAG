Yesterday, A D told me the 
programs had been commissioned 
for 400 pounds. This leaves me 
free to do other work. Why I'm
back in radio I don't know - 
I guess I want to be wanted, to 
be identified with a big institution. 
Here in my only year of freedom, 
instead of wandering on & seeing 
what I can, I'm spending my 
time in old ways. Must go to 
work now. Vera Hall.

Saturday. this morning a very dramatic 
quarrel with Robin -very painful as 
well - I tried to walk out and stay 
gone but I couldn't make it. 
As usual, she won because she 
really doesn't care for me and 
I appear to be quite neurotic
