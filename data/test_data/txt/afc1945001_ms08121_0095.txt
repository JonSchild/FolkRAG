A poem was written by some of the boys 
in a navy training station in one of the 
southern states. I read it in one of the papers 
last week. Its title is "Sea bee". The poem relates 
some of a "Seabee's" troubles while in training. 
Some of the verses are as follows.

He's pealed a million onions.
And twice as many spuds
And spends his spare time 
Washing out his dirt duds.

And when he gets to heaven
 To St. Peter he will tell
Another "Seabee" reporting sir
I've served my time in hell!
