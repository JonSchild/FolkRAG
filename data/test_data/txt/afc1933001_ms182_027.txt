Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt
Livingston, Alabama

Dear Mrs. Tartt:

The release from Harriet McClintock arrived
safely and is perfectly legal. The whole of
South America sends its thanks through me for undertaking
that hazardous journey. From now on we will
address Aunt Harriet at Hamner, Alabama without fail.

Really, thanks a lot for taking all that
trouble; you've been a tremendous help just as you
always are. May your tires wax strong and multiply
like the leaves on the tree and may you never know
a limited gas ration card.

Cordially yours,

Alan Lomax
