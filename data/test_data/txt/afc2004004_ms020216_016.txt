devil an' slap his face an' say, "You lyin'! You ain't, you
ain't nobody!"  You see, because you be wrong yourse'f.  You see,
you got to go, you got to, an' if you want them to ever come to
Christ, you got to [treat] feed, 'em on milk an' [treat] feed 'em good, ya see?
An' get 'em in, an' an' [get] let 'em [on the] understand. You cain't jus'
have, have a bone to go gnawin' on it 'cause they cain't do it.
They get mad, "I ain't goin' dere no mo'. She said I ain't
