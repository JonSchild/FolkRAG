Dear Alan: 
Your report of October 6 sounded very encouraging but that 
was too bad about the Studebaker on the hill. That was one occation 
on which Mohamed couldn't get to the mountain! 
Your bill from the Weston people people will be payed but you
forgot to tell me what it was for! 
Franks were sent you in my last letter but more are being enclosed 
in this. 
Take care of your health! Don't be rash. 
Regards. 
Sincerely, 
Acting-Chief, 
Division of Music
