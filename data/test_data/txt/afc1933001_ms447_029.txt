AH LOVELEY APPEARANCE OF DEATH

Reverend George Whitefield, a distinguished follower of
John Wesley, the founder of Mwthodism, ten years before his death,
wrote this song to be sung at his funeral. Although he was a 
one-time minister of the Church of England and a graduate of Oxford,
he became the first circuit-rider in the American Colonies. His
parish extended to the most remote settlement. His preaching and influence
in this country established Methodism firmly. Benjamin Franklin estimated
that Whitefield's magnetic and powerful voice could reach an 
audience of 20,000 people. He made seven trips from England to 
America, his stay sometimes covering a period of several years.

When Whitefield died in 1770, Phillis, a seventeen year old
Negro girl, only nine years out of Africa, who belonged to J. Wheatly of
Boston, wrote a sixty-two line poem on his death. It is printed in
AMERICAN BROADSIDE VERSE, collected by O.E. Winslow. In introducing
the poem Phillis writes: "An elgiac poem on the death of the celebrated
Divine and eminent servant of Jesus Christ, the late Reverend
and pious George Whitefield, Chaplain to the Right Honourable the
Countess of Huntington, who made his exit from this transitory state
to dwell in the celestial realms of bliss on Lord's Day, when he was
seized with a fit of asthma at Newburyport near Boston, in New England
'He leaves this world for Heaven's unmeasured Height,
And worlds unknown receive him from our sight.'
