Fremont, Neb    Aug.6, '42
     "One of the large ships reported sunk in the
Battle of the Coral Sea [speaker unable to remember
which] really wasn't sunk and the crew all
safe. The wife of one of the officers received a message
from her husband, in code, telling her so and
she wrote to some friend in Fremont. Several
Fremont boys all members of the crew. They
are all safe."                                              [*31*]
