Hello Mrs. Bess How are you? Fine

very hot over here but i think
i will make it.  You know it almost
two years i have retire and it look
like when i go out in the sun
it's very hot.  Well the reson i m
writing to is to know if some one
can sill get a Grant to learn music
I have been teaching a young man
from Texas  he had got a Grant from
Auston.  And there's one here in
Welsh that found out about it
and he keep buging me about it
So i deside to [?] contact you 
and found out what can be done
about it.  So if you can help with
that let me know how he can get in
touch with you or I can get his
name and adress and phone no. send
it you so you can get him stright.
Cause it's like i told him this man
from Texas done all his work and
i didn't have to much but teach
