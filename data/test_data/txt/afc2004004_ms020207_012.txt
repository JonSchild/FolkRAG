Reverend Roe.  Reel 7.  P.5
A: What?
R: [She was tending the plates] They was turning a plate, you know, and they'd called one's name and if he
didn't catch the plate, you know, before it stopped whirling, why then
he'd have to [catch] kiss the girl, you know, (laughter), [and] or the girl would
have to kiss him. This woman turned the plate and called me, and the plate fell [so]
[I'd have to catch the plate] and I had to kiss her. And so we started to going together then after
that, and we finally married.
A: How long was that after that incident, the plate-turning? Was it
months, or?
R: Oh yes, I don't remember just how long, but it was a good while.
We went together, [ah] O I guess, a year.
A: And then she was with you during mostof the rest of your life.
[*Lives away from her*]
R: [Goodness, yes], Ever since, She's still with me. {Well] Course she's old; she don't get
away from home, and I always have somebody there [til] and I go backward and
so forth [to] and stay with her. My oldest son is staying there with her
now. And I go backwards andforth. Whenever she wants to see me,
on any kind of a business, [there's something] she always sends me a, you know, or she
always calls me on the phone, and I go. And very often we talk
over my boy's phone, you know.
A: How'd you happen to come to Dalls, Reverend?
R: I was called to a church here. I was [passing] pasturing in Dennison, and I
was also busy with] tending a school over there, and this church here, [Grieg's] Gregg's
Chapel, they called me. So I been here ever since.
[*His long stay in Dallas*]
A: How long ago was that?
R: That was twenty-eight years ago, yes sir.
A: And she stayed on to look after your property in Sherman.
R: Well, of course, when I first came here, my children you
know, was all at home, and I'd go backwards and forth every week.
But I couldn't stay at home, you know, so long -- just a few days [you know]
in every week I'd go home, and I'd come back and tend to my work.
