   Q. Please explain the chant of the
tobacco auctioneer. - J. A. F.
   A. The chant of the tobacco auctioneer
consists of numbers, the words 
"dollars" and "bid". The aucitoneer
opens the bid at the price set by the
owner of the warehouse in which he is
to conduct the auction and then as the
various buyers, representing the different
tobacco companies increase the bid,
he raises the price. The buyers do not
speak their bids audibly, but bit by
certain signs such as a glance, a wink or
a gesture. As each bid is received and
accepted the pitch of the chant is raised
or lowered to denote the acceptance of
the bid. Therefore, if a pile of tobacco
is started at $39 and a bit of $40 is 
received, the chant of the auctioneer
will raise a pitch. When the bid of $41 
is received and accepted, the chant will
go up or down, depending upon the
original chant. In this way each buyer
knows that his bid has been received
and accepted, and being able to understand
the chant, knows exactly the price
at which he is buying the particular
pile of tobacco in question.
