Request of
Mr. John A. Lomax

At MR. Lomax's request, I am recommending that another $1,000 be paid
to him from the current Carnegie grant for the Archive. This grant, as you
will recall, was for $4,500; $3,500 has already been paid to Mr. Lomax (the
last payment, of $500, recommended May 9), and the payment now recommend will close the account.
