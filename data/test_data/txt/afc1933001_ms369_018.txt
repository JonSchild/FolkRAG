3) In the eighteenth century, its popular
usage was the same, but specialists confined 
its use to the narrative lyric type. This
is the usage of the term "ballad" today. Because

applied indiscriminately to lyrics in general,
some of which were for dancing, others of a
narrative turn, Gummere and others have been
allowed to argue that the narrative song was 
danced during all of this period.*

In Denmark, during the Middle Ages ballads were used 
for dancing, sure enough, but their texts show clear evidence 
of this. That these did not represent an ancestral
type is clearly evident in the following quotation.**" the
people have adapted nearly all their songs to the dance 
in order to remember them better." The author of the 
"Complaynt of Scotland," (1548), when he lists the dances 
of his "Golden Age" Shepherds, includes no Child pieces;
the ballads are included among the forty-eight tales they
told on their everlasting picnics.

orally, the following phenomena are evident at once.

while the exact opposite is the case in regard to the ballads.
2) The poetry is all lyric in intent and, if the narrative
element is present, it is degenerate and presentative,
not representative as in the ballads. 3) Genuine dance songs
are non-stanzaic and their typical repetitiousness makes
