Attention: Dr. Spivacke

Dear Dr. Spivacke:

Sometime ago I talked to you on the phone and you mentioned some re-recording work which you wished done. So far I have not heard from you relative to this work. At the same time I asked you if you could find time to stop in our studios and inspect our facilities. If you are not still too busy to do so I would be glad to see you. 

If you have heard anything further in the question of re-recording we would greatly appreciate a line from you.

Very truly yours,
R. J. Coar
