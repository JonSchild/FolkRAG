Population Trends

Johnston County, with its 481,735 acres of land, is one of the largest
counties in the state. There are seven important trading centers, of which
Springfield, the county seat, is the largest. The other towns of importance
are Selma, Benson, Clayton, Kenley, Pine Level and Four Oaks. The total population
of the county was 57,621 in 1930, of which 55,078 or 95.5 per cent were
classed as rural; 22.2 per cent of the rural population was non-farm, and 77.8
per cent consisted of farm families.

The Negro population shows only slight difference from the general
population. Slightly fewer of them are rural. Of a total Negro population
of 13,129, 94.3 per cent are rural; and 72.4 per cent of this number farm
dwellers. Only 5.7 per cent are urban as compared with 4.5 per cent of the
total population. The proportion of Negroes in the total population of the
county declined from 35.1 per cent in 1850 to 22.8 per cent in 1930. Since
1850 the white population has increased 400 per cent, and the Negro population
172 per cent. The distribution is not uniform over the county. According
to minor civil divisions the Negro proportions range from 52.5 per
cent in Cleveland township to 4.0 per cent in Elevation township.

The per cent ownership of farms is much higher in the state at
present than in Johnston County. Of the white families in the state 39.6
per cent in 1930 were tenant farmers as compared with 54.9 per cent for the
county. Negro tenants were 72.9 per cent of the Negro farmers in the state
and 83.5 per cent of the farmers in the county.
