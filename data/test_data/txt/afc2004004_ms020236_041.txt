[*WEST GREEN (THE DETECTIVE)*]
              So one night, then, before this, a boy came in there, a 
colored man, kinda sho't, an' he wore a lil' ol' cap like a 
porter, y'know.   An' he was fat.  He was sho't (short).  An' I 
was down at the [corner sale] commissary, there; they had a big [corner sale] commissary 
there. . .
TL:          The commisary was the store?
BJ:          Tha's the store.  I was down there at the commissary.  
So as I come up (to) the commissary, this man spoke to me, y'know, 
an' I spoke to him.   An' so I [was] sit[tin'] on the commissary porch -- 
you know, out there, they have bannis'ers out there -- an' I 
was eatin'. . .I loved cheese and candy ; I still like it.   ['Cause] An' I 
like cheese an' candy; I was out there eat' it.   So he came out
there, that boy did; he come [out] right on back outside; he had never been 
there before; he had jus' come in there, [know] he come right where I was.  
He say, "You seem to be enjoyin' that."   I say, "I sure is."  
That gave 'im a chance to sit an' talk an' he tell me how he used to 
eat cheese an' candy when he was lil'.   Jus' so much cheese 
that his Mama had to give him  [(milk?)] medicin.  [Said, "Jus that kinda] Jus' had a conversation with me, 
there; jus' went on talkin', ya know.  So, asked where I stayed an' I tol' 'im.  
He said, "May I walk on with you?"  I said, "Yeah, come on."  
So we walk on to the highway.  Didn't have nothin' to [him] hinder 
me from it, y'know.   So we walked on to our house.   An' from 
that he see this sick woman.   Then he had compassion on her, ya 
know, too.   Then he began to buy her food, an' fruits an' things 
like that, ya see.
             Well, didn' nobody on this camp knew this man, an' I 
didn' either.   But they said I knowed him.   You see.   They say 
that was my friend because they didn' know who was my friends then.
[there.]  Miss Alice had talked with me how not to let nobody know 
where I was at.  You see?  Ha, ha.
             Well, anyway, I was dressin' 
up.  I went there with nothin'.  I was dressin' up the way any 
thing that anybody would want.   Ha, ha, ha, I sure was!   An' 
Miss Alice had taught me a nice way to go.   But, an ah, I did 
it.
             So anyway, there wasn' nobody to hinder me from walkin' out
