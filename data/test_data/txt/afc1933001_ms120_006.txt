Dear Miss Wilson:
Many thanks for your letter of April 2. First of all, I
want to inform you that Mr. Garwick is not authorized to record
folk-music for the Library of Congress. There is an Archive
of American Folk-Song in the Library, but Mr. Garwick,
from whom the Library once purchased a recording machine, is
not connected with it.
Your letter was referred to the Honorary Curator of the
Archive, Mr. John Lomax, who is very much interested in the
folk material which you describe, and appreciates your kind
offer to place it at our disposal. As he intends to be in
South Carolina in the very near future, he would like to record
the songs of as many of your singers as you could conveniently
assemble for this purpose. Of course, Mr. Lomax will
write to you before setting out on his next trip, but we should
like to receive from you definite assurance of your willingness
to cooperate in this matter.
Hoping to hear from you very soon, I remain
Very sincerely yours,
Assistant Chief, Music Division
HS:ep
[*Archive of American Folk Song*]
