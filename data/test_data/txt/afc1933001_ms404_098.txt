Fineus Rackmore's [?] music
shows the present day drift
of public taste in music, for
he belongs to a travelling trio of
negro men 
who earn their livelihood [by]
both by street singing and by making
music to attract customers
to saloons. [V] The day before
I met him the three had played
all day in a big dry goods' 
store where a special sale
was in progress.

Rackmore's group travelled
mainly in East Texas, not
missing the oil towns [of the]
[section] where money flows
most freely.
