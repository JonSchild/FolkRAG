Dear Pankake:
Thanks for your letter of January 16.  It would be 
great if Hurt and the Sea Islanders got along
musically.  If so, we could plan to tour them as
a cultural unit.  Please send me a tape of how
it sounds.
The arrangments for putting up the group in
Minneapolis sound fine.  I'll appreciate anything
you can do to make them comfortable.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Lomax
