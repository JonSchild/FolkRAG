John A. Lomax, Esq.
Wilton, Conn.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Many thanks for your postal, advising me that a copy of your American
Ballads is being sent to me.  I can not promist you to go through
this immediately - as you know, my time is somewhat taken up, at the moment,
with preparations for the chamber-music festival next month.  But
I do want to read it through carefully at the very first opportunity and
as, I think, just as keenly interested as you are in seeing a really faultless
edition brought out.  With the help of the records you have turned 
over to us, this should not be too arduous a task.

Glad to note that you and Alan plan to be with us next month!  We
should have many things to talk over.

Last week I write to you about the blank records for which you are
asking the Library to repay you, explaining that I would look into the
question for you and let you know about it.  I regret to say that I find,
on inquiry, that there is no appropriation from which this charge could
properly be paid.  This applies also to the charge of $26.30 for which
you sent on a bill the other day.  In the meantime we have last received
word from the Carnegie Corporation that favorable section has been taken
on your second application, the amount of this year's grant being $4,500,
as against $3,000 for last year.  This being the case, I do not doubt 
that you will be able to adjust these miscellaneous charges with the
Carnegie people, as in the past.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music
