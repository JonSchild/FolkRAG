Reverend Roe.  Reel 13.  P. 6
teach you [and tell] until you to have that same spirit in you that you can be
happy, that you could adjust yourself in this world, and be happy when
you had plenty and happy when you didn't have it.  And we can get--
because all of our trouble is in our minds [yessir,] --the sorrows-- all of that's in
your mind.  But [accept] simply believe that whatever comes, that is best for me because
God set all things [. We] should work together for good that them that
love Him.  I just believe that.
