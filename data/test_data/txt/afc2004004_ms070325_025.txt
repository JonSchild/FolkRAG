Later I went around the corner to
the Rue de Lappe & recorded a little
dance in an Auvergnat Dance
Hall with a young sweating accordionist
& a room full of accomodating Auv.
workers singing, stamping, yelling dancing
as I pleased.  It was very pleasant
work to give them a good recording.
   Altho my affairs are going well
with Dubois finally finishing the French
booklet & material coming from Israel &
South Africa, I am having a dreadful
time working.  In fact I'm going mad.
I was not built to live alone.  I
look hungrily at every woman I see
Drowning in desire.  So much so that
it shows in my face -- petulance, 
weakness, pain, deprivation - and 
of course nobody gives me a tumble
I would take anyone.
