CASEY JONES

The workers on the S.P. Line to strike sent out a call
But Casey Jones, the engineer, he wouldn't strike at all,
His boilers they were looking and his drivers on the bum,
And his engine and its bearings they were all out of plumb.

CHORUS:
Casey Jones kepts his junkpile running;
Casey Jones was working double time.
Casey Jones got a wooden medal
For being good and faithful on the S.P. Line.

The workers said to Casey, "Won't you help us win this strike?"
But Casey said, "Let me alone; you'd better take a hike."
Then someone put a bunch of railroad ties across the track,
And Casey hit the river with an awful crack.

CHORUS:
Casey Jones hit the river bottom;
Casey Jones broke his blooming spine.
Casey Jones was an Angelino;
He took a trip to heaven on the S.P. Line.

When Casey Jones got up to heaven to the Pearly Gate,
He said, "I'm Casey Jones, the guy that pulled the S.P, freight."
"You're just the man," said Peter, "our musicians went on strike,
You can get a job a-scabbing any time you like."

CHORUS:
Casey Jones got a job in heaven,
Casey Jones was doing mighty fine;
Casey Jones went scabbing on the angels,
Just like he did to the workers on the S.P. Line.

The angels got together, and they said it wasn't fair
For Casey Jones to go around a-scabbing everywhere.
The Angels' Union No.23, they sure were there,
And they promptly fired Casey down the Golden Stair.

CHORUS:
Casey Jones went to hell a-flying.
"Casey Jones!" the devil said "Oh fine,
Casey Jones, get busy shovelling sulphur,
That's what you got for scabbing on the S.P. Line."
