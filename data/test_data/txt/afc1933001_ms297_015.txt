I.U Starts Collection of
Folktales Heard in Indiana
Times Special
BLOOMINGTON, Ind., June 8. -
The Hoosier Folklore Bulletin, a
collection of folktales found in Indiana,
has made its initial appearance
on the Indiana university
campus.
The bulletin is edited by Dr. Herbert
Halpert,  of the I. U. English
department and president of the
Hoosier Folklore society. The publication
contains folktales of the
English-speaking white population
reported for the first time from 
America, although they are told
over large part of Europe.
Dr. Halpert said that "we hope
to represent the early folklore
strata of the French at Vincennes,
and the older German and Swiss
settlements at such places as Oldenburg
and Vevay, and the more recent,
and often more active, folk
tradition of the Serbians at Blanchford
and the many groups in our
northern industrial area.
"There is also an unexplored
wealth of Negro folklore in Indiana
which needs to be investigated."
Among the contributors in the
first issue was Irene McLean of
Indianapolis.
