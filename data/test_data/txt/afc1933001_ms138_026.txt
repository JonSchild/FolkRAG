Dear Harold,
Thanks for your cheerful letter.  I w wish I didn't 
have you pictured as some kind of ogre or right now 
I would be square dancing with a French Canadian 
girl in Baraga.  But here I am, feeling very
easy and pleased with myself - Since I wrote
you I've made 45 swell records - and  tired
as hell + ready to come home.  I'll let you
know my plans as they develop, but right 
now you can help if you'll airmail my salary 
to Madison, General Delivery --  along with
my other mail. 
Yours, 
Alan
I'll send you a list of the records tommorrow
or the next day.  Why not the same group the 
BBC people used - or some of them.  Of 
course try them out first.  Try Willy Reilly 
by Capt. Nye - East Virginia - Rosie (the
latest acetate) - Moise-o (Haiti) The
Lady of Carlisle - Go Down Old Hannah (sung
by the group on the Central State Farm) - Almost 
any of the records I have sent in this summer

but a dress rehearsal is 
important.
