"Rumors about the Government planning to do this or that in connection
with the war effort are seldom heard any more. Nearly all private discussions of
the war seem to be confined to developments as they occur. This is a result of
repeated warnings by the press, employers and others against the spread of rumors
and of the and the damage they may do to the war effort. This has resulted in the
development of a strong public sentiment against rumors of harmful aspect."
