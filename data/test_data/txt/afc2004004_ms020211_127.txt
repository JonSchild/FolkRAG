Dear Ms. Beaverson:
Your letter addressed to Mrs. Jones came to me as her
quondum manager.  None of the members of the group belong
to the AFM.  Under deparate cover I will send you
within a few days the clippings about the group.  I 
will write Mrs. Jones to send you a group photograph
directly.
The group would be glad to participate in the workshop
on the basis you suggest, but of course, we cannot
agree on their appearance until we see the contract,
itself.  The contract should include a guarantee of
room, and if possible board, for all members of the
group during their time in Minneapolis.  Whether this
will be one or two nights will depend upon their bus
schedule, which we are informed by the bus company
changes every month, so cannot be determined at this
time.  The fare will be approximately $70 apiece,
round-trip.  Their accommodations don't have to be
grand, but must be comfortable, in private homes
if this is possible.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
