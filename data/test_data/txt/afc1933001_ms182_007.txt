Dear Alan:

Mr. Barker was born in East Tennessee somewhere.
Don't know the exact spot, but his family were and are
mountain people. He has been blind since he was three from
some accident. He went to the school for the blind in
Nashville, Tennessee for a while, but got most of his
education at the The Virginia School for the Blind at
Staunton, Virginia. Under our management, for the most
part, he is now making part of his living as a ballad singer.
We took him to The University of Pittsburg, University of
Virginia, Washington and Lee, State Teachers' Colleges at
Farmville, and at Harrisonburg and several High[s]- Schools this
past season. Plan to do more of this next winter. Among
his own people Horton Barker is almost a legend. His fame
as a singer is strong; there as numerous stories about his
uncanny perception of events about him and perhaps his
greatest fame lies in his recognition of hundreds of his
neighbors by their voices.

You'll be interested to know that Houghton Mifflin
has taken THE JACK TALES, and may take also the Virginia
Writer's Project book which I hope to finish by June.

We had a flood of letters and stuff from the National 
Folk Festival. Wish we could have given it a try once more.
If you attend, please write me how it was this year. I
would appreciate this.

Sincerely yours,
Richard
