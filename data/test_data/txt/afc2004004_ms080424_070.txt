Tape:  Roll 54 Stan n Hattie Hicks    4
(Stan) got mad, that is what he'd use.  So we thought he done us read bad,
cruel at the time, makin' us do this, but later on growin' up I realized
that -- what it was.
AL:  Did the girls get beat up as much as the boys?
HAT:  I got beaten over I guess, I had to do more work, I had to come in
cookin' and sewin' when I was about 5 years old.  They'd put me up on a 
pillow in a chair, and Stanley woudl turn the truddle(?) of the machine so
I could make the clothes for. . . .I'd have to climb up into the chair and put
my bread down, climb up into the chair to wash the dishes, and I get to put
soap(?) in my bread, and they'd about kill me!  I think he had a hard time
there, had to make shoes for the children, the little ones, out of pig
(unint.)
AL:  But the same parents made you all kinds of things to play with.
Hat:  Oh yeah, he did, but I never did get time to play.  I was next oldest
and I didn't get much time to play.  And I hear some of the stories, I think
he made up some of them back then. . . .that's a "jumpin' cheek" (?).
Stan:  I used to do that, but I  can't anymore. . .
Hat:  . .have another one here. . .But we didn't have nothin'.  I had one little
old doll that I raised up and my brother got mad and broke him. . .
AL:  You know how to make all these things yourself, don't you?
Hat:  I know, I have made some, but not lately, my daughter-in-law made
a lot. . .
AL:  Let's see that one that you pop, there. . .what's the name of that thing?
Stan:  That thing there is a "Blowin' mill" that they blow.  The boy that
made it, he didn't have any nails and stuff, but you put this over here,
you see, and you got to have pretty good breath (blows)  You've got tohave
a lot of wind to do this.  The kids that done it good. . .(tchncl)
AL:  Well, no end to the different things they used to think of!
