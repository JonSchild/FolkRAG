[*1ST HUSBAND'S WORKING-COTTON FIELDS  (12)*]
they had never worked in a field befo'.   You know, it was on
St. Simons jus' like it is now.   They had no (legal?)       society
(to lean to ?)         .   And so on, with the Darien crew.   He's 
the on'y one off the Island. . .The rest of 'em were from around
Darien an' other places.
TL:         He was from St. Simons, Cassius?
BJ:         Tha's his home.   He was born an' raised there.
TL:         I'll be darned.   And he came in, huh?
BJ:         Uh-huh.  Tha's why I know about St. Simons. I thought
about his sister's name yesterday.   Her name Isabella, the one
tha's dead.   I thought of it last night.    [I tol'] We was talkin'
'bout it.
TL:         Well, he came in an' he got to know you, huh?
BJ:         Tha's right.  He come to our house an' we treated [him] 'em all
[awful] nice, ya know.
TL:         Did he get to know you in the work field, or. . . ?
BJ:         No. Well, in the work field, [in] anyways, jus' [go an' all] goin' to differ-
ent-- all work in the fiel' together.   An' also, they would come over to our
house; we was the closes' colored folk around there.   They would
come there an' Mama, she was always full of life, y'know; they --
we'd have card parties an' then Mama'd fix dinners for 'em.   We all
thought they was -- strangers, y'know.   She jus' -- tha's a mark
to her dinnering.   They'd come in an' have a big dinner, all of
'em.   Yeah, an' have a big dinner. [Along] An' all like that, so that the
way it happen.  How I come to know him.   He was the lil'es' man in the bunch.
TL:         He what?
BJ:         He was the smallest man in the bunch.   Um-hum.   He was a 
man, though.   Much man.   Nice, very nice.
TL:         Well he started to come see you, and he brought you presents,
and he was good to your mother, too?
BJ:         Um-hum.   All of 'em.  He was nice. . .Everybody liketed him.
They had been workin' over the other places, y'know, [peoples] pickers.
An' ah, we had a lot of work over there -- [we had] a big cotton
fiel', y'know?   Full of cotton.   Well, they pick, they done done
sumpin' when they picked 65, 75 pounds of cotton a day!   Ha, ha.
But they hadn' never picked none.   Those lil' bitty bags of cotton
they have there; they was as tired as anybody else!   They was
jus' doin' it.   So he stayed out there; he liked [it] to picke[d]
