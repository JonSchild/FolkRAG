wanting a wife," and says, "I believe you'll suit me fine.  And I don't want you to do nothing but just stay here and milk the cow and see to my cat and clean the house up, cook -- that's all I want you to do."  And says, "Now, I got a room there.  You look in that room, you'll die."

Well, the old gray horse, he went on off and left her there, and she milked the cow, and the old cat come around and begged for a meal, but she kicked him and run him out.  And she cleaned the house up, and then she said, "I'm gonna see what is in that house."  And she went in there and she opened the door to see what was in the house, and when she stepped in there, she fell into blood up to her waist, and the blood got all on her.  She cleaned all over, changed her clothes, but she couldn't wash the blood off.

And so he come back from her and says, "Well, is everything cleaned up nice?"  "Yes."  "Milked the cow?"  "Yes."  "Tended my cat?"  "Yeah."  "Did you look in that room?"  She said no.  He said, "Let me see your feet," and so he looked at her feet; there's blood on her feet.  So he cut her head off, and her head up in there.

And then the next girl did that same way, and he cut her head off.  And then the baby girl, she was guarding the haystack.  Well, the old gray horse come; she hit him with the stick, took to the stick, and the stick clinged to the horse, and he carried her down.  He told her the same things: tend to the cat, clean up the house, if you look in that room, you'll die.  And so she cleaned the house up, milked the cow.  The old cat came round begging for milk; she give the old cat all the milk he wanted to drink, and the old cat, he loved her, and he was walking around near, following her.  And she wanted to see in that room, and she opened the door, stepped in and fell into blood up to her waist.  She come out, she couldn't get it off, with the clothes, get the blood off.
