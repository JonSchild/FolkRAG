Letter from F. Fantus to Elmer Davis, dated September 23rd, and letter
from David Robinson to Archibald MacLeish, dated September 26th, re
Rumors.

Will you please reply to them over the names of Elmer Davis 
and MacLeish, with specific recommendations in each case, understandable 
to a non-professional person along lines of what you are undertaking 
for the Minnesota Bartenders Union.
