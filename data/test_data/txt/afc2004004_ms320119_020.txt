MICHEL DOUCET   -19
LOMAX  What kind of a person do you
think, feel he is?  Canray.  I mean how does he feel to you?
You've been with him a lot.
DOUCET  Canray is one of the strongest
individuals I think I've found that, that just he's a, he's
a mentor to me.  He's someone who, who, how you say, I mean
it sounds corny but he passes time in space.  He can go back
to any century or any time in the future and just be there
at the righ time.  And the way I described it, I mean when
he plays he plays exact.  He plays what's right.  You can't
describe how he plays.  But whatever he does it's perfect
and to the point.  The way he cuts a second he cuts it
right.
     Another person that I studied with who is an
incredible person right now, in 1983 he's 90 years old, is
Dennis McGee, who lives in Unice.  He was one of the first
Cajun fiddlers to record as a Cajun duet, two fiddles with
a, both [Sadie Korville] and [Adolf Thrusez].  Dennis plays
the older style that hardly anybody plays.  He plays a lot
of reels and contradances, cotillians.  And the thing about
Dennis, he was one of the first to record in 1928.  And now
he plays the same style, the same scratches, the same way.
And he's one of my best friends.  And he and Gladys, it's a 
pleasure to go over there.
     Another person I've studied for is lesser
known but not in, in skill.  And he's Mr. Varice Cunnard,
