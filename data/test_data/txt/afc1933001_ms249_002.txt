Dear Father,

I had a conference with Dr. Evans on Saturday and he asked me to write a letter for his signature to Leon Henderson.  A copy of this letter is attached.  I am going to call Henderson personally when the letter goes out from Evans' office and ask him to consider the letter in the light of his enthusiasm for American folk song which is real.

Probably by this time you received a letter from Ben Botkin suggesting names of people who can help you in your work in Oklahoma.  I think that might be interesting to follow up some of these leads since we have no material from that state at all.  He felt that Joseph A. Brandt, President of the University, and through him, Mrs. Buchanan, formerly of the Music Project,  (she is the person who made a study of fiddle tunes in the state for the WPA), would be most helpful.

As you note in my letter to Henderson I stressed the matter of the documentation of contemporary sentiment about the war and this is something which it seems to me you should keep in mind as you work with your folk singers since the atmosphere of folk song recording is ideal for getting direct and unselfconscious answers about all sorts of problems.

Harry Stephens sounds like the man we have been waiting for in the field of cowboy songs all these years.  By the way, you ought to call up Bill Kittrell and get from him the names of the cowboy singers he knows about.  one of them I heard a long time ago at the World's Fair at Dallas was really a beautiful singer and you know our lack of cowboy records in the Archive.

You are right about the book and I am very serious about it.

Much love to you and all the folks.
