Mr. Alan Lomax,
General Delivery,
Harlan, Kentucky

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter
relative to your coming to this county in behalf 
of the Library of Congress. We have having 
a county fair here October 8th and on
Friday evening we are holding a county-wide
Amateur Hour. You suggested October 23 as
a convenient date for you to be here. I presume 
that we will not have time to organize
the county along the lines that you desire by
October 8th but I am hopeful that you will be
here on October 8th to observe the Amateur Hour
and to offer suggestions for the real program
that we hope to give October 23.

You may let me hear from you at once concerning
this matter.

Very sincerely yours,
Ova O Harvey
Ova O. Harvey, Superintendent,
Morgan County Schools.
