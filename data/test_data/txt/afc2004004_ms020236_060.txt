[*(WEST GREEN (LEOMI OR LOU ELLA & THE WHITE MAN)*]
[*Lou Ella*]
like my husban's moustache cut.  An they was black.  He had brown
eyes.  An' he was -- roses, roses -- his skin was real pretty.
He was a nice lookin' man.  An' his boys was very nice lookin', too.
His two boys, what was born up here (IN NEW YORK CITY), they
[looked]was very nice.   There's one of 'um was in 'is teens.  An' their
name is Dean, Joe Dean.   An' them there -- I lef' there.   I wa'n'
ready to leave right then; I was goin' Monday.   Goin' to -- I
guess, I don' know whether he had knew that or not.   But he came
there Sattiday night.   An' I promised him I'd go to Wes' Green
an' get me a, ha, ha!, house.   I mean the girl would get me a
house.   An' I ain' never seen 'em an' I ain' intend to in my
life!  Ha, ha!   Not until today!   But that was a snare; it was
the wo'st snare I ever been in in my life, I'm tellin' you.   Aye-uh.
It wouldn't abeen a snare if I could just cussed him out.  He
would of let me alone; I coulda stayed on there.
             You see there was a colored girl there; her name was
Leomi.  She was goin' with one of the[(Cohens?)], a [(coaster) (Korson?)] Koston boy.
And he's white.  An' she was jus' -- jus' with 'im, let me tell
ya.   She come out there an' [jus'] stay at that man's house out
there, jus' stay all night.  Sattiday night, all weekend, ya know,
an' everything like that.  An' she jus' brazen with 'im.  So one
night she sent for me to come get a drink.   You know, up to the 
Big Boy's house.   An' I went up there.   She said, "Here I am!,"
[comin'] had a coverlet across the place there, you know, the bed.  An' I said,
"You layin' down?"  An' I walked back there to see her (an'
Delly) an' that big white man in bed with her!   I couldn't swallow
that liquor!   Ha, I was so mad with her!  Sendin' for me there,
'cause I didn't know -- 'cause I had heard, I knew all 'bout this,
but I hadn' heard -- you know, bout it -- but I had heard so much
that if they ever catch 'em they gonna kill 'em.   An' there she 
sent for me to come down an' get a drink with 'em.  I turned around
to the fireplace where Big Boy was.   Big Boy said, "He'p yourse'f;
drink."  I said, "Big Boy, why you let this go on in your house
for?!"  I jus' couldn't stand it to save my life.
TL:          What did he say?
BJ:          He didn't say [nothin'] anything.  You know, [he didn' say anything] not nothin' 'cause
[because] he'd been hearin' [that] from us all.
An' I'd a lef' there. 
             But anyway, a little later on from that, between the time
