LOMAX-SCRATCH 3   -9

     On my visit to it in [Veal Platt] one night I
found a music that was almost African.  The [korin] wasn't 
used as here as an instrument but as a, as a melody maker,
but as a, almost like another wind drum.  And nearby a stove
top was played as a, like, you know, as, as a scraper.  But
an African orchestra, winds and percussion and occasional
shouted phrase.  A real survival for, of African styles.  We
can see from this African example with the same shouted
phrase, percussive accordion and scraper seen.
     Then back to the, for the music.
     This is the process was beginning to occur,
this mixing of styles.  This is the time of the Civil War
when disaster struck this area and so on.  Right?
     :  Good.
LOMAX  Apparently the cage, the French
Louisiana was ready for the, the good news from Newport and
the success of their, their musicians there and on their
tours to Paris and Quebec.  Because within three years after
this event there had been festivals and the music had been
musicians had been, been playing at fairs and so on and a
legislator introduced a bill into Louisiana that passed
resoundingly advocate, that, that authorized the teaching of
French in all the parishes in Louisiana where it was a, an
important lang. . .
