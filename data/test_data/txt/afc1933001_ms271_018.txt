We're Gonna Move Into Germany

Atlantic Ocean's long, deep and wide,
And Hitler's over on the other side.

So we're gonna move into Germany, sure's you born
We're gonna move into Germany, won't be long
We're gonna move into Germany,
Change this whole world around.

Range in my kitchen it burns coal and wood
I'm gonna tell everybody Hitler ain't no good.

Got myself a bulldog and seventy-two greyhounds
I'm gonna use my dogs to run old Hitler down.

Hitler didn't like our peaches but he shook our tree
He's been bombing our ships out on the deep blue sea.

If I was an eagle flying in the air,
I'd build my nest in old Hitler's hair.

I'm gittin' tired of Hitler makin' his brags and tryin' to flirt,
We gonna teach Hitler how to do this dirty work.

I'm gonna tell everybody what I want to do,
Gonna treat them fascists worse than they treated the Jew.

He tortured them, jailed them and starved them to death,
Now those American bombers don't give him no rest.

It's been a long time since Hitler started foolin' around,
The Americans and Russians gonna turn his damper down.

It takes a rocking chair to rock and a rubber ball to roll,
Five cent bullet to satisfy Hitler's soul.
