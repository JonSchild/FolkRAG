kind of changed.  I just can't keep up there with them 
youngsters.  Now you take them boys of mine, they can 
tell you bout having a time.  Now when I was a boy, I 
was a fella for you, but even then folks didn't do like 
they does now.  Well I tell you, show I danced.  Used 
to be me that used to be the head figure caller at all 
the parties.  Folks danced more sociable like then than 
they does now.  When I was a boy, old time ago - everybody 
join a circle, the fiddler and guitar and box man 
be playing for day and night.  I'd be up on a box, 
yelling as loud as I could, just calling them figures 
like - Two and two, hand in hand, turn your lady loose, 
hands up sixteen, circle right, when you get home - boy 
I can't remember all that stuff.  You see son, I'm a 
Christian like man, and I just don't like to talk about 
all them old bad things.  Here you come here talking to 
me about dancing and old tales.  You ought'n to be done 
doing that.  (When he said this, all the children 
started laughing, and his brother said, "Come on Joe, 
tell him something, you may be somebody's Christian, but 
be should come around here and hear you sometime".)

He said:

You boys makes me feel kind of shame.  I knows lots 
of them old tales and songs, and when I'm by myself I 
sings them, but I just don't like to do that kind of 
stuff among folks that ain't like me.  And some of them 
stories is bad, bad - but I knows and tells them.  I'm 
just going to tell you one.  Have you heard about 
Casey Jones?  Well here it is.  (As he told this tale, 
all the members of the family stood around, laughed, 
and corrected him when he made an error).

On one Sunday morning
it look like rain
Round the curve
come a passenger train
On the bump was Casey Jones
Two locomotives 
and they bound to bump

Casey Jones was a son-of-a-bitch
And run his engine on an open switch
The boiler busted
The whistle split
The fireman fotted
And Casey shitted
