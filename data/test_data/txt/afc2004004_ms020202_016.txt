Dear Jona

this is the report frome my
work in Coweata Coundy.
When you read this I hope you will
understand it. some of the problems
that the people have deep
in the heart of Dixie first I
will give you some of the name
of the Coundy I have coverd.
Most of them are very small. You
have to look hard to find it on
the map but there are peoples there
and very find people. some old 
and some young some have
went and some have came. some 
I remember and some i forgot.
in all of these places there are
more Negroes than White. the towns
are own and operated by White.
Maybe two white men in each town
own the hold town only one person
in the family gets a chance to vote.
believe it or not I have learned alot
from them they liked what i came in 
there to do.

This is the name of the right hand
Negro who I went to see first.
