Mr. William H. Webber, Chief, Report Section
Office of War Information
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Webber:-

            I have just returned from Chicago where I attended the Elmer
Davis meeting, hence the delay in rumor report. The report will be mailed to
you tomorrow. One of my contacts is out of town and will not return until
morning. His secretary told that he had a number of rumors but she couldn't
find them.

            In reply to your field letter of October 3 regarding the names
and addresses of my contacts the information is as follows:

            Druggist:-- Earl H. Pressnall, 5464 E. Washington St.,
Indianapolis.

            Labor:-- William T. Miller, President U.E.A.W. Allison Division
of General Motors, Indianapolis.

            Dentist:-- Dr. Dale Lentz, 445 N. Pennsylvania St., Indianapolis.

            Beauty Shop-- Lucille Patterson, Lucille's Beauty Shop, 411
Odd Fellows Bldg., Indianapolis.

            Police:-- Lieut. Edward Rawls, head ofsubvervisive Division,
Indianapolis Police Department, Indianapolis.

            Club-- William H. Book, Executive Vice-President, Indianapolis
Chamber of Commerce, Chamber of Commerce Bldg., Indianapolis.

            In each case the person contacted was very agreeable to
accepting the assignment. They thought the work interesting and at the same
time felt they were doing a patriotic service. It was slightly burdensome in
the case of and the Dentist and the Beauty Shop operator because of the rush of
business in both establishments.
