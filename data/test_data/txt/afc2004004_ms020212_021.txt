The children went on chanting in a raggedy chorus: "I come
 from being a soljer, a soljer, a soljer, I come from being a
 soljer on a dark and stormy night."
It was a silly song, Margaret said to herself. As silly as 
the moaning sounds Katy was making....
Margaret opened her eyes and glanced across the clearing.
 Katy was walking slowly up and down, arms across the shoulders
 of two women. She seemed to be laboring in earnest now, Margaret
 thought....
Margaret closed her eyes again. Katy always labored hard.
 Her babies were always born with long mashed heads that they
 kept for the first months of their lives.... She was taking on
 now. Her moans were interrupted by screams. So that was why,
 Margaret thought, the men had disappeared. It was supposed to
 be bad luck for a man to be too near a birthing.
I've got to remember this too, Margaret thought. And the
 way the sounds go right straight up into the open sky.
