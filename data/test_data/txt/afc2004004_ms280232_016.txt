2) Donald's running round and round, 
Aiken drum, aiken drum. (2) 
But the chief canna be found 
And the Dutchmen they are drowned, 
And king Jamie he is drowned, 
Aiken drum (2) 
But the dogs will get a stone, 
Aiken drum. 

3) And the bonny laird of Grant, 
Aiken drum aiken drum (2) 
Aye, the Godly laird of Grant, 
That Cameronian saint, 
Wi' all his hieland cant, 
Aiken drum, (2) 
Tae his wife he has a wont, 
Aiken drum. 

4) We hae heard of whigs galore, 
Aiken drum, aiken drum (2) 
But we've socht the country o'er, 
Wi' cannon and claymore, 
And still they are before, 
Aiken drum (2) 
We may seek evermore, 
Aiken drum.

A satirical song of the same period. . . 

Chorus: 
Away tae all the whigs of Fife, 
1 The broozy tikes, the lousy tikes, 
Away tae also the whigs of Fife
That e'er they came frae hell. 

1) 'Twas gentle John and Jock the Slop 
And Skely Jock and Belly Jock 
And Curly Jock and Burly Jock 
And [xxxx] Lyin' Kock himself. 

2) De'l claw the traitors we will flail, 
And take the midden for their bail, 
That kissed the cow anint the tail 
And keived at King's themsel'. 

3) At sic a style a stinking crew 
The very fiend would like to spew, 
They held their nose and crooked their mou' 
And darena abide the smell.
