Fort Sumter Hotel
Charleston, S.C. 7/16/1937

Dear Alan : From 2:30 to 9;30 yesterday
Miss Terrill and I worked continuously
on the Plantation Echoes' crowd. Their 
building was sizzly hot, the ceiling 
was lofty and booming, the recording
only fair, the experience
most interesting. Results - 9 complete 
records - the most I have
ever done without once sitting 
down. I'm expressing a package 
of them and others. Also some
of Miss T's films.
Came yesterday Mr. Spivacke's 
telegram, a big batch

"Charleston's Finest On the Battery"
