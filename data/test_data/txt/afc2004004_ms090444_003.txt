exactly what it was but I had a good idea.  I made more than some of the 
white men who worked there and I think some of the new men complained about 
it.  That's the only way I could explain it.  One day Mr. Holland, President 
of the bank, called everybody in his office and made a little talk to us.  He 
said, "We pay everybody here according to what they are worth to the bank.  
If you don't get paid as much as somebody else it's because you aren't worth 
as much as that man is."  Nothing else was ever said.

[The bank president was from Canton, Mississippi.  His father owned 
Hollandale.  All of the stockholders were Mississippians, the richest people 
in the county.]  Old man Millsaps who founded the bank was the richest man 
in the state.  One day he came in the bank and saw me working and said to 
Mr. Holland, "If you whitewash this fellow he'd be all right."  Mr. Holland 
said, "Stack can do as much work as any five men in this bank.  He can go out 
and play music all night and come in here and turn out more work than five of 
them."  [In my time there was only one man who got his accounts mixed up.  He 
was the assistant cashier and they had to let him go.  He was just an incompetent 
man.  He started having me come and help him.  The cashier saw him one day 
and told him, "You leave Stack alone, he's got his own work to do.  You do yours 
and let him do his."  I was glad of that too, because I might have gotten involved 
in his troubles.  I guess I did too much work there.]  When I got sick 
the work I did was divided among three men.  The bank closed December 1930.

[When the bank closed I went to work for the National Benefit Life 
Insurance Company.  Not a man on this circuit could get a bond.  When my application 
for bond was made the same bonding company that bonded me in the bank 
gave me a bond as soon as my application was made.]
