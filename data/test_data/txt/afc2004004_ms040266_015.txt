own purposes.
I have not heard from Newcum yet.
What was the outcome of the interview?
I hear Campbell of Corwnor and his friends
are on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I
hope they stay like that.
I had a letter from Surley today.
He will help you if you write. He is
in Edinburgh now, 54 Queen St. tel 32324.
O'Sullivan is here in Uppsala. I also
met several people who knew you. All
the best.
Yours ever
Calum
