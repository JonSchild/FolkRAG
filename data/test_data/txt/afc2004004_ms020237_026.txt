BJ TAPE 23, p. 24

I moves my bed, right now, like I did when I was small an' Mama,
Mama used to have me remove beds? I do it anyhow, when she 
gone, if I can, rassle with beds. Just change 'em, any way I 
want in the house. I don't never let my bed stay in one place too long.
TL: Why?
BJ: I jus' like to see the house changed. You know, change it up. 
Calls that changin' up, the stuff in the house. Take pitchurs
an' change 'em; take beds an' change it around; all kinds of 
stuff. I like to do that. So happen to have it at the door, you jus'
say I got it there. That's what that is. But some...
TL: All the bedrooms you've ever been in when you were little,
where do they usually keep their beds? Do they keep it away from
 the windows, or next to 'em. 
BJ: No...Jus' like I tol' ya, jus' anywhere they's a mind to. 
Jus' change 'em about. Sometime you go to the house, in one place;
sometime ya go there's another. You know, they had big bedrooms, ya 
know?, then. Plen'y a large rooms, up there, where I was at.
An' they jus' change the beds like ya wanna, all about. So,
it wa'n' no...it wa'n' no diffrunt. You know, it wan'n' no argumen's 
about no certain place for beds to be settin'. Some peoples
now keep the beds in one place so long, long; I can't figure it 
out. I move mine someway or other about my house. I'm jus' tired a 
you sittin' up here. I turn it aroun', some or the other way. 
I move it about my house. That's the way that was. That when
I was little.
    So I'm tryin' to think of another. I had one on my mind a 
while ago, But I got so tickled about that.
   I know this is easy -- I know this is a easy one ta, you
know, ta to think. What is this: "The ah, the more you cut it,
