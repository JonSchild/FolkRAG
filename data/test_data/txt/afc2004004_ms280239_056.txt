that ever he was seeing.

[When he went to a ball at.......and he was one of the
committee and got up.............and he made them all come
up and claim their girls.......And he told me about it next
day.  He said "Man, I did what she did and I never mair
fun in my life"......]

But I'm nae telling you my story about Leslie Marr.
As I told you, Meldrum was growing grimmer....Weel,
Leslie, he got some girl - nobody will never know who she
was - and he proceeded out there with her and out that
road, and Meldrum he sneaked along behind them until he
had them well up and he just came alongside them and he
just let biff at him and he nearly knocked him over the
dyke......And this lad ran from him right into that field
out there yelling and roaring blue murder, and I don't know
where the girl went and whether he got hold of her again
or back, I don't know anything about it.  But that was what
happened to Meldrum.  He could have knocked this lad into 
smithereens...... But Jeanie - I don't know why he didna
manage Jeanie, but he didna......

And then I was put on to manage my father's farm.
[One of the boys is in yet.]  The man that looked after the
farmer's driving horse was called "The Strapper" and I feed
a far better Strapper for my father than he ever had to
himself.  [It was his one and only vanity.  He drove one
of the best horses and he could drive them and he could
buy them because he was a judge....... Then..... I]......
this man [was foreman of Dunglass at Inverurie....] Now
you've no idea what it was to take a man from being foreman
at Dunglas - one of the greatest farms in the district -
to be a strapper to my father in Tarvis at Craigie.  It was
a terrible downcome, but this one missed his market.....
