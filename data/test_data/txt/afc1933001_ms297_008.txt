Bloomington, the seat of Indiana University, is a city of twenty
thousand located in the hills of southern Indiana fifty miles southwest
of Indianapolis. Aside from the academic interests of the town, it is
important as a center of extensive stone quarries. Within a very few
miles are four large recreation areas, the best known of which is the
Brown County State Park in the midst of picturesque landscape and 
surrounded by an interesting hill population well known to the world
through Kin Hubbard's "Abe Martin."

There is frequent bus service between Indianapolis and Bloomington
and direct train connections with Chicago and Louisville.

All inquiries concerning the Institute can be addressed to the Director,
Professor Stith Thompson, Indiana University.
