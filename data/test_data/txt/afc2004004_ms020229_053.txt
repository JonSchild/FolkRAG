     I come on back up town.  When I, when I got up town -- the
Williamsboro, Williamsboro Depot set kinda 'way off down, an'
ah -- I got back up town, I didn't know what to do.  I went
then an' I was tellin' the diffrunt ones about how I done got to
town.  An' some of 'em went over there an' told Dr. Brian, ya
see?  In a few minutes, Dr., ah, dey, aw, I met Miss aw Maggie an'
she said, "Dr. Brian said come there."
     I went on over there to Dr. Brian.  An', an' when I -- He
says, "I got the law out huntin' for your lil' girl."  Said,
"How old is she."  An' I tol' 'im; she was 8 an' I tol' 'im.
     But I said, "I don' know how she dressed or nothin'. "  So, I
jus' couldn't talk.  I jus' hardly couldn't even talk.
     He said, "Well, they'll find 'er."  Said, "If they ain't nobody
go in the country with 'er."  Said, "Should have Rosalie letter
write."  (?)
     Said, "They said she'd be here Saturday."
     He looked at the letter, see when it was dated an' everything,
said, "Yeah, it mean today."  (TELEPHONE RINGS.  THEN:)
     An' so, as I say, when I went to Dr. Brian, across the
street there, he tellin' me he had someone to look for 'er?  An'
ah, so I turn right on aroun'.  I wanna look, myself.  I went on --
I still lookin', ya know.  I went on down the street again toward
that depot.  I still worry 'bout that way.  An' ah, an' I went
one the the corner __________________ on my mind.  Sumpin' said,
"Turn on around an' go back this way.  She mighta brung 'er up
town."  So I started on back an' that time I, I got near 'bout
back, almost to the office, I, I  heard somebody say, "Yaw, I'm
chere."  (YES, I'M HERE - ?)  An' that was here.  She was with
this woman.
