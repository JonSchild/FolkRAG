[*THE HEREAFTER   (BURNING IN HELL)*]

AL: Bessie, when you were listening to preachers preach about
hellfire -- They do preach about hellfire until it gets hot in
the wintertime, in some of these churches don't they? The old-time preachers?
BJ: Oh, they preach about hell all the time.
AL: What?
BJ: Preach about hell all the time, some folks, Ain' no way to 
git around[x] it.
AL: I know, but in the old days they really preached about hell,
didn't they?
BJ: Oh, yes, they did. But they...
AL: Did they make you actually see it and feel it?
BJ: No, not feel it; I's jus' scared of it. Ha, ha. Because, 
well, ya know, I'll tell -- For a long time, ah, we thought --
at least, I thought -- that, ah, hell was a place that you go
to, ya know, when ya leave here? Ya go to hell an' jus' burn an'
burn an' burn. An' when they said diffrunt folks had gone to
hell, ya know, what-what died, ya know weeked (wicked), or sumpin'
like that, I would think that they had jus' gone on to hell an'
burnin' up. Jus' burnin' an' burnin'. It' makes ya real --
it makes ya feel kinda bad, that way. I used -- I used to think
that, sure enough...until...But I jes' know better now, ya see?
An' so...
But ya not in hell until time come. You in hell, all 
right, but not hellfire, you know? 'Cause the world ain't on
fire. And so that...
TL: Does everybody go to hell?
BJ: No...Ya know everybody gonna have a lil' hell befo' ya git
to Heaven/. Hah, an' so that's how that's written. If it's
nothin' but sickness. Or troubles in mind or something. You
