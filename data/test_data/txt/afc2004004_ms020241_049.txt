the graves?  So some of the peoples come out there an' tell 'em,
you know, to put a fence between certain graves, 'cause they
didn't want nobody to tear them up, ya know?  'Cause they was tear-
in' 'em up, ['I] I'm tellin' ya.  Some beautiful, you know, t-- stones
was there.  So they put it between there.  So hit was white an'
colored graves there, on, ah, in the same place, across the road.
The, the, just the road dividin' 'em.  There's a place in Millen
the same way, just the road dividin' 'em; on one side white an'
one's colored. So that [was just] the way they said that was.  But that was 
goin' all the way across.  Them niggers had (?) tore up some a every-
body.  
An' right now, ah, Baby George got a big, ol' scar on his
thigh where he fell in one of them [p] graves.  George had to git
him out.  You know, you know, in..
TL:  Fell into one?
BJ: Fell in it.  You know, he was out there messin' around in 
the tent.  You know, he just was a boy, you know.  Runnin' an' he' pin'
his daddy do this an' he'p do that.  Boogedy-boogedy, doin' this,
an', heh, so!  An' he was doin'           ; he just stepped right
down an' went right down in there.  So, ah, sumpin' off the box,
wood or sumpin' scratched, scarred his laig.  An' before ya know
Grace said (?), he said, "Great God, we're in the graveyard!"
AL:  I should think you all would have been scared to sleep
in a graveyard, Bessie?
BJ:  Too man-- too many peoples t' be scared there.  Um-hum, [these]
thousands a folks; somebody woke up all day an' all night, all the
time... I ain't thought about the spirit, hum!  An' them people
wa'n' thinkin' about it neither.  Ain't thought [about] of it.
