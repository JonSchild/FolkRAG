that Jack Lane had been there in person.  But he became kind
of a musical tycoon here.  And many musicians, white and
black played genuine jazz under his auspices.
          Now the reason I know that it was genuine
jazz is because of the fact that musicians who played in the
original Jack Lane bands survived for a long enough period
of time so that we had a chance to hear Manual and [Leonce
Mellow] and Dominic [Barraca] and other people of the pre,
you know, the, the early part of the century and the latter
part of the, of the 20th, of the 19th century.  So we know
what they played.  And to that extent we're satisfied that
that was a jazz band.
          Now we also know that in 1900 when, when
Bolden first started to play the trumpet, before that of
course he played violin, and he and a fellow by the name of
Charlie Galloway used to get together for small things. 
This was a black string group of maybe four pieces.  And
they were booked around for jobs like in 1897, '98.  From
all accounts the, the voicing continued to be the
traditional voicing that we think of as jazz voicing,
although there were no horns in that band yet.  However,
Larry Shields, who later became the clarinet player of the
original Dixie Land Jazz Band, was a neighbor of Bolden's.
He lived two doors away from Bolden.  Now I wouldn't have
believed that myself when I heard about it from Harry.  But
I checked it when the census came out and sure enough they
were next door neighbors.  And they played together outside,
