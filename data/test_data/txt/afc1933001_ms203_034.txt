For the purpose of immediate present and pressing work in the
Archive, I have transferred the singer file of cards and the
geographical file of cards into the Archive office from the
W.P.A. pavillion. As I understand it, neither of these two files
are being used at the moment nor are they needed for constant
reference in preparation of the check-list. They are necessary 
for constant reference in this office if the work of the Radio
Project, the Archive of American Folk Song and John A. Lomax's
work is to proceed. I shall be delighted for the project to use
these files whenever they want to , but, they must remain in the
Archive until other complete files can be made from them. Eventually,
of course, the entire catalogue will reside in the same
case in this office. I hope this may be as soon as possible.
