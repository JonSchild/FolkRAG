New York 12, New York.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
I received your card today and was glad to hear
from you. I hope the records are going over good. I also have
six other songs to record for you when you return. I've had
the blues ever since you left- I can hardly help myself-
wondering how you like the other songs.
Here is my picture- Forrest City Joe and his
Three Aces - ready for more jump and jive.
Hoping to hear the good news soon, and will be
looking for your return.
Very truly yours,
Joe B Pugh
