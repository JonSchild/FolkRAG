Sabotage

1.  The upper guys, the ones with authority, are the ones that 
are doing the dirty work and the sabotage.  They have the plans or know 
how to get them.  I've just come from Flagstaff where I've been working 
as a laborer on the ammunition dump.  I don't know anything about them 
and wouldn't if I worked there 50 years but the officials have the plans.  
It takes the higher-up, smart fellows to plan sabotage, but it is hard 
to catch them.  (Worker about 50 years old, who returned to Phoenix 
from Flagstaff because of illness in his family.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.)
2.  There will always be sabotage as long as foreigners are 
allowed to occupy high Government positions.  (American, about 60 years 
of age, employed.  Phoenix, 8-12-42.)
