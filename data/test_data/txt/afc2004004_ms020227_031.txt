BJ TAPE 12, p. 29

BJ: It ain't logic, but it's Bible! HAh, an' you can git ya
logic outa that, 'cause the Law say for a woman to dress becomin'.
An' then a married woman is another thing. Ya see?
AL: What is becoming to a woman?
BJ: Ah, ah, becomin' to what she is. Ya see how Jezebel dresses?
See?
AL: I wasn't there.
BJ: Y'all wasn't there, but you read that Bible, tell you strict
an' straight. An' that, that lesson right there, there's a diffrunt
in it, see? See. An' Jezebel...An', all right, it says
again that they knowed the womens, the house an' the street, from
the way they dress. An' they would meet a woman, they'd know when,
when she is a harlot an' [whe' (whether)] when she wasn't. A married
woman an' a, a loose woman, a harlot woman I'm talkin' about, she
didn't, ah, dress like a, a, a, other woman.
I sometimes read -- I jus' open [the Bible] it out an' let you read
it, 'cause you can read it fas' n (faster than) me -- If you don't read
it too fas' an' get to know it an' un'erstan' it 'cause I will
he'p you. An', an', an' you'll see. You know what I'm talkin'
'bout? You can go -- I, ah...
AL: Now, you don't suppose that you're dressing now...
BJ: Don't look like I [----] now? I ain't no good! Huh, huh!
AL: In the modest way [in] that a woman in Jerusalem was supposed
to dress. Because, I'm telling you, she wore clothes clear down
to her feet...
BJ: Tha's right, [yeah] uh-huh, tha's right...
