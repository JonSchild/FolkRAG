Dear Alan:
Herewith another copy of the dates for next year's
School of the Air broadcasts. I think there must
be a bogy man of some sort around that library of
yours, because I'm sure I sent you a copy almost
two weeks ago in one of my letters.
I'm afraid we still misunderstand each other about
the bibliography. I had no objections whatever to
it because of its scholarliness. In fact I think
it is an unassailable compendium; but within the
limitations of our space it is also unprintable!
I'm saving it for posterity, and I hope that we may
be able to do something with it later on, but the
big wigs of the manual are still screaming bloody 
murder about getting in even the thirty books from
it which I gave [you] them.
There's probably nothing I can do for your friend
who so ardently wishes to scrub floors, but if it's
any help to you, I'll be glad to tell her so personally.
I hope your check reaches you before the parents of 
your children are in the same dire state as they. I
wish I could be more helpful about getting checks to
you promptly, but that's one responsibility I don't
have and will always gladly duck. Please address all
complaints to Sir Leon Levine. He'll hardly speak to
me on the 'phone any more!
Cordially,
Bill
