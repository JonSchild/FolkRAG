BJ TAPE 20, p. 92


BJ:     I don't feel good, you know, as I do when I'm on, up, up,
um-hum...An'  my [?] desire is that  --  I love Fladah,  ya know?   An'
I'd love to go down there.  Said, "Now, if I go down further,  I
couldn't stand the heat."   'Cause the older I git the less
heat I can stand.  Ya see?
TL:     Do  you think you'll ever go back to Georgia?
BJ:     I love...Oh,  yeah.
TL:     'Way back in...
BJ:     Ye-ah...
TL:     I mean up to Dawson.
BJ:     No.
TL:    
BJ:     Well,  I ain't lived there enough ta know much about the
place.   'Cause  I left there when I 'leven year old, ya see.
Almost eleven?  I only go back there to visit peoples what, what
I have there [ta,] ta git them away from there.  Hah,  an'  so I 
did that!   An' I haven't -- I don't mean to go there for any 
thing under -- the few folks [what] up there now I go up there an'
see 'em,  you know,  an'  like that.  But I don't care to go up there
ta live.   I, I don't...I [don't] have reason why, ' cause the, even the
white folks there don't know nothin'  about me.   'Cause the older
head is,  ah,  dead out,  ya see?   An'  ah,  they don't know nothin'
about me.
