Dear Mr. Lomax,
Herewith "Young Jimmy Foyer", -so
in the title but "Foyers"
throughout the verses.

"Burgess" is obviously Burgos
and the date 1812 or 1813

"starts on campaign"

If I can get hold of him I will
tackle the curator of the
United Services Museum, Edinburgh
Castle, who may know something
about the background.

genuinely been written by one
of Jimmy's comrades, - certainly

with Perth and the local militia.

sung except in the coal pits and

in an East Lothian pit.

I am interested in your
"Over the sea to Skye" and shall
hope to hear it on Tuesday night

I think the popular words to
the "Skye Boat Song" are rubbish and
prefer the edition given in the 
"Scots Minstrelsie" a copy of
