      You Don' Know my Min' 

[*first 
verse*] 
Walkin' down the levee wid my head hangin' low, 
Lookin' for my sweet mama an' [she] she ain' here no mo'. 
Baby, you don' know, don' know my min', 
When you see me laughin', laughin' jus' to keep from cryin'. 

First time I met her, she was cryin' for a nickle or a dime, 
Tell her to cook my dinner, say "She ain' got time." 
Baby, you don' know, you don' know my min', 
When you see me laughin', laughin' jus' to keep from cryin'. 

She Won' cook me no [breakfas'] dinner, won' wash me no clo's, 
An' Won' do nothin but walk the roads. 
Baby, you don' know, you don' know my min', 
When you see me laughin', laughin' jus' to keep from cryin'. * 

My breakfas' on the table, an' my coffee gettin' col', 
[Sweet] Mama's in the kitchen, gettin' sweet papa tol'. 
Baby, you don', you don' know my min', 
When you see me laughin', laughin' jus' to keep from cryin'. 

Sometime I think my baby's too good to die, 
Sometimes I think she ought to be buried alive. 
Baby you don' know, you don' know my min', 
When you see me laughin', laughin' jus' to keep from cryin'.  

* Need sumpin up de side of de head, what she need
