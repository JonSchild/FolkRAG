LARRY:
no use in questioning it, you know.  I just never did question nothing he ever said and it paid off because I could get cords now I would get a note you know I could just hear him say I told you that man, you know.  Just like I say something happened, it happened this past winter I, I started to go to a place I need a job very bad and I went to this place took my guitar to a guest show you know in other words Rev. Davis would say something for nothing. And I got there and they come there was a fella playing and I was supposed to be next and I was next sitting there with my guitar in my hands waiting to go and then it feel like I could hear him say "Larry get out of there" (?) This is the truth if I ever say it I turned right around put my guitar in my case walked out.
MRS. DAVIS:
And you didn't do a number?
LARRY:
No. I didn't do it at all because I just saw me laboring away and then not getting the job.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well he told you about that a number of times remember. He says you know you got to some things free sometimes But Larry you getting good now, its time you was getting something for your labor.
LARRY:
Thats right, thats right.
MRS. DAVIS:
I heard him tell you that.
