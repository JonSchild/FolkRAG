This was one of the early blues that was in New Orleans, I guess many years before I was born.  The title is "Make Me a Pallet on the Floor."  A pallet is something--that you get some quilts--in other words it is a bed that is made on the floor without no four posters on it.  A pallet is something that you can define in New Orleans.

You my friend and I think it's rather dangerous (during that time there was a lot of kidnappers in New Orleans and there was no law against it, but only that you had the privilege [to][*of*] kill[*ing*] them)[, It's] rather dangerous so maybe you better stay for the night and sleep in my bed and I'll make me a pallet on the floor." So that is where the wor[*k*][d] "pallet" originated from.  I don't think it's in the dictionary.
