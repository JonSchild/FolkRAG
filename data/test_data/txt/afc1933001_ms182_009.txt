Dear[s] Madame Sylvain Comhaire:

I was fortunate enough to learn from Dr. Metro recently that you
were in New York and were considering visiting the Archive. I would be
honored by such a visit and delighted to play you our Haitian recordings.
We have a collection of 298 aluminum discs of many kinds of Haitian songs;
the only type which is not well covered, I believe, is the work song.

At the time I was in Haiti I had to work with a slight knowledge
of French and therefore decided to take down the titles of the songs in
English orthography. I now realize that this was an unfortunate decision,
particularly since the Discoteca in Sao Paulo has ordered copies of the
entire collection of Haitian discs for their own use. I feel incapable myself
of revising this list, and I have wondered if you would care to help me.
I should think it might require a week of intensive work, but it might be of
interest to you, since you could at the same time familiarize yourself with
the contents of the Archive.

Whether or not this is possible, the Archive would be delighted
and honored to receive a visit from you.

Cordially yours,


Alan Lomax
