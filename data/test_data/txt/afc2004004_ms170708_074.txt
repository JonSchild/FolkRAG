5.
This boy was bound to me apprentice,
This boy was bound to me, I say,
From Saint Gile's Workhouse I haled him,
For this poor boy, he was motherless.

One day this boy he did offend me,
But little to him I did say.
To the mizznetop I hauled him,
And kep' him there all that long day.

His hands, his feet, they were exhausted,
His arms, his legs, they were likewise.
With my marl spike I cruelly gagged him,
Because I could not bear to hear his cries.

With my long line I cruelly beated him,
So cruelly I can't deny.
Through my cruel and bad ill treatment,
The very next morning this poor boy died.

So now my men they do reject me,
To think that I ha' done so wrong.
In my cabin they closely confined me  (confided?)
And brought me to London in irons strong.
