Dearest Elizabeth and Alan,

Not having written since early
Paris, I have much, much to tell.
Only I did write once, a letter in French
which I tore up after re-reading
it, on account of it[s] sound[ing]ed so
puerile and on account of it would
have given you such a false idea
of my French!

Paris seems millions of years ago.
Elizabeth and I walked most of
the time, I remember, and hardly
spoke to a soul. We saw lots, but
I think I will enjoy Paris better
when we go back. That's what
Elizabeth and I want to do nowâ€” 


tences don't seem exactly coherent
tonight. I am trying to cure the
yasthmy [tonight] ce soir by going to
bed early & writing letters until
all hours.) Elizabeth & I, by the
way, would also like to live
with a French family at Marseille.

Then we made a bus-ride
over [?]night to Nice. There was
so much scenery along the
way that I finally got sick of
it; and that is one thing I wont
tell you about. I refer you to a
guide-book at this point; you
might believe everything it says
about color, and the ever-changing
sea and the orange groves & what
not. Carnival at Nice was much
more exciting.

It seems that they have three
carnivals at Nice in rapid succession -
one in February, one in March & one in
April. Can it be they want tourists
