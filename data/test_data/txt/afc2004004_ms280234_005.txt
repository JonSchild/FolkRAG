this man here. He's complaining about them. He can't keep them
together. ( A thumb rope is a rope you make with your fingers
out of grass).
     That man fell to, and he wasn't long making one. And he made
a good one and he took the books and tightened them well and
handed them to the boy. "They'll not scatter now, anyway."
"Well," says Calum, "You're a handy man. But," he says, "Youll
not get a very good wife."
So he passed on and that's all he said. And he thanked him very
much for making the rope. His own by wondered very much at what
he said to the first man about getting a good wife and that he
wished for this man to get a bad wife.
"Oh well, I'll tell ye the reason for that. If the first man
would get a woman like himself what would happen to the two of
them ? They would be got lost on this world for the both of them
would be very unhandy, So this man that made the rope, let him
get a good wife or a bad wife and he'll pull out anyway. He'll do
anyway."
"Very true," says the boy, says he.
     So from that day to this day, no matter where you go through
the world, you'll get the woman and the man not alike in any
house you go to. If the woman's lazy you'll get the man a good
worker, and if the man's lazy, she's a good worker. You might
get her sitting at the fire and you couldn't shift her with a
pitchfork,...

St. Calum had a bit of a temper and he was a great Celt, and
it wasn't right to touch with him, and he made great marvels. He
used to go about from place to place and the people was used to
him as he used to pass often. He used to come and go to them, and
they were glad to see him, but they passed no great remarks on
him. But one day he called into a house and the woman went to the
door and she seen him coming and she says to her old man, "I see
St. Calum coming today, and he'll be with us tonight."
"Och, och," he says, "Is he coming the day again ?"
"Yes," she says, "But what can you do ?"
"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll thrown myself over the clothes
on the bed and pretend I'm sleeping, and when he sees me sleeping
he'll waste no time."
"Well," she says, "Whatever you think."
She didn't like to tell Sir Calum a lie when he came in. Sir Calum
came stepping in and stood with his back to the fire and he looked
across at the man and he said nothing. Says to the woman, "This
is a grand day."
"Indeed," she says, "I beleive we're going to have grand weather."
"Is the man," he says, "sleeping ?"
"Well," she says, "he threw himself over the clothes there a
moment and I don't know whether he's sleeping or not, but he has
a habit of throwing himself over the clothes." (For fear of telling
a lie.)
