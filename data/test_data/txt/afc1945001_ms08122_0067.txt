A
Anything I have Heard.

1. There was a rummor in the paper
that Hitler was believed to be dead.

2.  There have been many scrap drives
bulliteans issue to the Public schools
by the government.

3. Next Wednesday a new drive will start
in all schools in Chicago. It is
to be the collecting of all fats
and greases you have saved.
