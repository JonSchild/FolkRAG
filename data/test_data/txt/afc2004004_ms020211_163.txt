Dear Mabel,

Please put your songs on a tape and I'll submit them
to my publisher. I think you ought to send them
all. We can take down the words and the tunes from
the tape for those that ought to be copied off before
the tape is submitted to the publisher.

Sorry I waited so long to react, but I have been
away a good deal.

I have made copies of your clippings and am returning
them with this letter.

All the very best to you,

Alan Lomax
