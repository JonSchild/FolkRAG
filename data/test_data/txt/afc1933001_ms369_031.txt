A history of the English ballad must be largely a 
discussion of theories of ballad origin. The folk-ballad, by
definition a creature of oral tradition, can have no
documented, dated history in the same sense as art verse.
Of course, the songs of the people have been collected for centuries
but almost always by poets and rhymsters who put them to their
own uses; and it is only within the last century, with the growth of
science and with its concommitant growth of interest in
"the common people", that their art or their anything has been
thought worthy of any attention, much less serious consideration
and study. It is also interesting to note that all the important,
early collections of ballads appeared in the eighteenth 
century, when the attitudes of Rousseau
and of the democratic revolutions were
stirring Western Europe.*
The history of any literary development is notoriously 
conjectural, Even where the authors biography 
and auras of influence are known in the greatest 
detail, The Historian is still faced with knotty social,
ethnic, aesthetic and psychological problems, although he may
be unconscious of their import. What terrible
dangers do we then face when we begin to talk about ballads
that come out of a period about which we know relatively little,
that were composed we do not know when by we do not know whom,
