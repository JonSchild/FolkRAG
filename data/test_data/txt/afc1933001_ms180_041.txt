Dear Sarah:

I wondered often what had become of you
and it is certainly nice to hear that you 
have recently published so fruitfully.

I'm sorry that I didn't know before that
you're living in Chicago as I might have 
dropped in to see you but now that I do
know, I'll drop in the next time I'm in 
town. The same goes for you when you're
in Washington.

Congratulations and best wishes.
