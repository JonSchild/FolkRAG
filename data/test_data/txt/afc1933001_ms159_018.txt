Mr. Richard Erstein

New York City

Dear Mr. Erstein:

It seems to me that costs for advertising are
mounting so high, that my lecture fees will never reach
my pocket, but, I'll try this for a while. The Leaflet
copy seems allright. I've made only a few changes.

Please tell Miss Scott that I can't be in New York
on the 26th. for her little get-together and I'm sorry.
I'd very much like to hear what response you got from Sam
Goldwyn in regards to that matter I referred to you some
time ago. Please let me hear from you. I received a letter
from "Program". I thought I had already discussed what I
wanted to do about that with Miss Scott.

With best regards,

Alan Lomax
