Item #8
[translation]  Wire Wire Didinn O
[Note: It would seem that the term "Waya, Waya didinn  Ã”"
is merely an imitation of the sounds made by 
the mill in motion]
[Note: The "toloman"is a plant that bears like the
dasheen and tannia family of plants. When
reaped it can be skinned and cooked as
food. More often it is "grated" or ground,
""strained"and dried. The process yields
eventually a white food rich in starch.
Like cassava and other foods, "toloman"is
produced and consumed much less today
than it used to be.
There ought to be [and almost certainly
there is] an English and/or scientific name
for "toloman" but the translator has never
been acquainted with it].

Wire, Wire, didinn O, didinn O,
Didinn Wire Wire.
(Chorus -- Wire, Wire, didinn O)
Didinn O, didinn O
[Chorus]
My mill is toloman [or "arrowroot"] mill
[Chorus]
I told him (her) a toloman
[Chorus]
? My ? mill ? is answering that for me.
[Chorus]
