Stories are in circulation that the Japs are receiving
preferential treatment at camps. One story is, "the Japs are getting
high wages for the work they do." A daughter of a hardware
merchant who made the foregoing statement said she knew for a fact
that the Japanese were receiving special script books with which
they were able to buy non-essentials not included by the Government.
She was very critical of the fact that both the rich and 
poor Japanese were eligible for these script books. (What she
did not realize is that the Japanese receive script books for the
work they do, and there is no relation to their own personal finances.)
