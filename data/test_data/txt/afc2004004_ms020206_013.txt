Reverend Roe - Reel 3 - P. 6

couldn't-a learned much.
A: That old Irishman.
R: He told my father I was the best scholar he ever had and that's all he'd done
was to teach school. You ought to send that boy to school. That's what he
[*learning to read - education*]
told my father. When I learned to read, I could read. I'd just pick up any 
book and read -- after I learnt it -- we had the old blue-back speller, you
know, and I could read just any book I picked up, you know. That old speller,
you know, back there, you know, it would give you the definition of words,
so that's all I had. I'd see the white boys going to school and lot of um
knowed me -- because I was always good-natured. They loved to play with me
because I was funny and good-natured, and they let me look at their books,
and some of them would show me things in the books, things like that. Of
course, that helped me, certainly did, and I made friends with them. The
white folks at home as I was telling you about - Lee, the home where the
old lady lived? -- they would never have a play amongst the white for young
[*whites accept him*]
folks without inviting me. I had to go there to sing for um and help them.
Those white boys and white girls were just as familiar with me as if I'd
have been their brother. I've known when Mrs. Lee would send me in the
girls' room to make Molly get up to come and cook breakfast. Yes sir, I went
in there and got after Molly, and Molly'd say, "Get out!" She'd be hitting
me, and I'd grab her arm and pull her out the bed and run. All passed off
in fun, you know. She knew I meant no harm, and they know'd me. Yes sir,
I was just like one of the family.
