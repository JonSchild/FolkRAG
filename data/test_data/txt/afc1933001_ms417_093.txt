CONCERNING UNION SQUARE DANCE CALLS -

If you ever call for square dances around your part
of the country, and if you are a union member, you will
surely want to throw in some of these union verses, and
calls that we have assembled here.

"Swing her up, swing her down, I see a scab hangin' around."
"Pay your dues, shine your shoes, say goodbye to the coal
camp blues."
"Swing the chairman's daughter."
"...Scab in the factory...now let the scab out and the union
member in..."
