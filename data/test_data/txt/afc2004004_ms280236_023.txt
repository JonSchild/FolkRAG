Tape 87. Bob Roberts interviewed by Alan Lomax.
Robts: There's a mill at our village, and another mill at
Ipswich.
Lomax: Marked in the Domesday Book.
Robts: On the maps made by the Conqueror's surveyors. Well,
there was a river ran down there in later years was
name the Pindle. It now runs through my back garden,
you know, that little river that runs along the side
of the back wall - that was the River Pindle. On the
other hand, it may have been named the Pindle Mill -
you see - operated by the River Pindle. Because another
theory is that in later days when they built the war -
ships at Ipswich and Harwich, - wooden warships - their
keels were fastened with great wooden pins drilled out
of oak trees. I think you only got one pin out of one
oak tree - and that was driven down through great bulks
of timber which formed the keels on the ship, and that
they were made at Pinmill -- that's where they made the
pins to fasten the ship.
Lomax: Plenty of oak around there, wasn't there?
Robts: Plenty of oak - still is a lot of oak there. They're
the two theories of how the place got its name.
Lomax: Have you folks been there a long time?
Robts: Me mother's folks, yeah. My mother's folks ranged all
up along that coast from the Ipswich area as far north
as Yarmouth and Caistow.
Lomax: Did the folks accept you asm one of them, even though
you weren't born there?
Robts: Yeah. I was born in Dorset. Of course, my mother's
people was named Brown and King, and you find them all
the way along the coast. Boat builders and fishermen
mostly - life boatmen. I went to Norwich the other
day to give a talk on the Midland programme. One of
the people there was a cox from the Caistow lifeboat.
I found out that he was my mother's third cousin.
Wherever you go you'll find someone who's related to 
them.
