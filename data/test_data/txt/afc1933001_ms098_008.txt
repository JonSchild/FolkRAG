Dr. B. A. Botkin
Library of Congress

Dear Mr. Botkin,

A few weeks ago when Carl Sandburg visited us he was very much
"taken" with Vera Hall's songs, especially Another Man Done Gone. We had a
scrap recording, practice disc, that we played over and over to him until
we actually wore it out. He was trying to get it late his head. Later he
wrote that he "had" it, at least his own version of it, and planned to use it
on a program after a little more practice.

After he left, it dawned on me that the song is on one of those
South American series of which the Library was kind enough to send Mr. Lomax
a set - and which we have thoroughly enjoyed. Mr. Sandburg was very much
interested in the "Chisolm Trail" record of the Ballad Hunter series
(Radio Research Project), especially the latter part beginning with the fake
Gypsy lady's songs. Would you, then, be good enough to send him a copy of
the Vera Hall record (LC5 - AAFS 16), and if possible have a ten or twelve inch
record run off at 78 rmp of the Gypsy lady part of the Chisholm Trail.
I want to pay for them and am sure I should send the money in advance, but
a borrower lost our catalog of the SA series, and of course I've no idea
what the other would cost. Could you trust me and send a statement?

Another thing - could you tell me where we could purchase
some red-shank playback needles? We are on our last go-round as to that
kind of needle, and of course we are afraid to use any other on some of
the records. --- Mr. Lomax is working hard on his Adventures etc. and hopes
to finish up by April 1. --- I hope you had a good trip and found your
family well on your return. Best of wishes to all of you. I shall appreciate
highly whatever you can do --

Sincerely yours,
