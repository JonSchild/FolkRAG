, too, probably.  That hasn't happened to my knowledge.
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE]
REED  Pardon?
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE]
REED  Yeah.
LOMAX  do you remember any of those [INAUDIBLE]
REED  Well the men, for example, the fathers believed very strongly
in sending the wife and kids to mass every Sunday.  They're very strict on
that.  But themselves, if they did go sometimes the wife was domineering enough
to force him to go.  But then it wouldn't take him long enough 'fore he'd, he'd
walk out and go chat in the back, smoke a cigarette.  Cajun men never went too
strongly for, you know, church ceremonies, let me put it.  They're God fearing
men but church was not one of the. . . .
LOMAX  Like a weekend sport.
REED  Oh yes, very much.  And that including some mighty [INAUDIBLE]
sports.
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE]
REED  So, dog fights, they finally got rid of that.  Cock fights
or course and the horses have always been popular, horse racing.  And occasionally
bet on everything and anything.  They bet on the craw fishes, the msot unpredictable
animal that you don't know which way it'll go, backwards, front or the
sideways, the crawfish.  And I've seen them bet hundreds of dollars on the damn
crawfish coming out of that circle first.  Yeah, they're good sports and they
love sports.  They love to dance.  They love to drink.  But during the week they're
hard workers.  They work like hell, make money and spend it all on Saturday
night, some do.  [BACKGROUND SOUNDS INCREASING]
     Most of the income today, and not from the farm anymore, it used to be where
the Cajuns could control his family so much better than he does now.  Now it's,
let me put it all to you, we'd been in bad shape but the roustabout, the oil
fields and the Merchant Marines, for example, keeps this little town going.  Mostly
some beautiful . . . .
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE] . . .big on that [INAUDIBLE].
REED  Oh yes.  I would say 90% of the monthly checks come from
off shore.
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE] What kind of a party do you have?  What, what's the
nature of this party here?
REED  This party, it's spontaneous.  I, I've yet to plan, if
that's what you mean.  It's a spontaneous thing with different faces every Saturday.
I never know who's going to come here.  There are different groups.  Now we
have a few locals.  When they first started, and incidently, it was like a half
hour, an hour, and then we went up to four hours, back to three hours.  Might
have to go down to two.  But it's just sort of a spontaneous thing.  You see groups
coming in.  And then they, they get together and sort of trace their roots and
then have what we call reunions.  It's getting very popular.  The [UNCLEAR]
clan will meet tomorrow at [UNCLEAR] and all of that.
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE]
REED  Pardon?
LOMAX  [INAUDILBE]
REED  I, I think . . . . I think, like the other ethnic groups. . .move
back a little bit [UNCLEAR].  That's it.  I think this, this culture, along
with the other cultures will, will go on its own [UNCLEAR].  I think it will pic[k
up ? ?] [UNCLEAR] the Italians, the Germans, the other groups, ethnic groups.  They're
coming back.  It started with roots itself, you know, and I think you'll see
more and more of that.  Definitely the French [INAUDIBLE]
[MUSIC]
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE]
REED  [INAUDIBLE]
:  Come meet us in Basile, the Main Street bar.
LOMAX  Tell me, what is the. . . .
:  We're going to be there at 6 to 7 on the radio and 8 [UNCLEAR]
LOMAX  I want you to tell me the words, just the words you [UNCLEAR]
:  Oh, I can't tell you all the whole words.
LOMAX  Just the words.  You told me them.
:  Yeah.
[MUSIC]
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE] . . .words in English.
