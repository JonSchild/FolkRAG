Mr. Coleman Harwell
Executive Editor
The Nashville Tennessean
Nashville, Tennessee

Dear Mr. Harwell: 

For Mr. Davis, I write to acknowledge your
letter of October 10th and the interesting tear page
which accompanied it.

Obviously, most of these stories are without 
foundation, and it seems to us the TENNESSEAN
delivered a strong antidote in the form of its $1,000.
reward.

Sincerely yours,


R. Keith Kane
Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
