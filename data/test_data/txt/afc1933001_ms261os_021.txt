Herewith I submit my report for the year
ending [July] June 30, 1937.
In reporting for 1935-36 brief
mention was made of a trip in July [of the] 1936
to the mountains of North Carolina
under the sponsorship of Professor
Frank C. Brown of Duke University,
and immediately thereafter a visit
to the Washita Mountains in Arkansas
in company with Professor Lawrence
Powell of Little Rock. In 
North Carolina Professor Brown and I secured recordings
of a hundred songs, all from
white singers except a dozen
or more [from] Negro songs.
From a State Convict Camp at
Boone, North Carolina.
In her lonely mountain
Cabin several miles out
