3) They walked up and seated they doon,
And round by the dams o' Binnorie,
Till the eldest stepped aside and dane the youngest in
To the deep mill dams o' Binnorie.

4) O sister, o sister stretch out your hand,
Binnorie, o Binnorie,
And I'll gie all my gold and a fifth o' my land,
For the bonnie miller laddie o' Binnorie.

5) It wasna for your money that I dane ye in,
Binnorie o Binnorie,
It's you being so fair, love, and I so very grim,
For the bonnie miller laddie o' Binnorie.

6) O Miller, o miller, run out your dam,
Binnorie o Binnorie,
For there's some grand lady or some deid swan
Floating up and down the dams o' Binnorie.
