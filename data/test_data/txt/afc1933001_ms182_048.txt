THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS            To Dr. Harold Spivacke
REFERENCE DEPARTMENT                Chief, Music Division
                                                               May 28, 1942

Referring to the quad* for $950.70 to cover expenses of
a projected trip to Texas, New Mexico, etc. by John A. Lomax:

We query, in view of the fact that there is only an
available balance of $974.32, whether there are any projects
in progress or completed for which we have not been supplied with
quads for encumbrances of funds.
