Dear Mr. Lomax:

   Several of us in the Department of Labor
have received very enthusiastic comments on your
playing and singing of labor songs.  Is there any
chance that you may be returning to Washington in
the near future?  We should like very much to have
an opportunity to hear you.

Sincerely yours,

Mary LaDame
