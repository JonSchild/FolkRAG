Dear Craig,

    I am writing a Memorandum to the Third Programme 
today. As example translations I am sending a couple 
of the waulking Songs that you left in my office.

    If you could do just a couple more that have to 
do with the fantasy life - particularly the life of the 
women - I think we could lay the basis of a good programme 
in their minds. Anyway , they will give me some kind of 
answer by the end of October.

    I will call you Monday or Tuesday in Glasgow. Meantime,
    All the best,
