"HAITI SINGING" will 
disappoint only those 
who expect to be titillated 
by fictitious and 
highly seasoned travelers' tales 
of zombies and vodoun orgies, for 
its author has approached his 
subject in a truly scientific spirit, 
gathering his material, not on a 
flitting two weeks' visit, but on 
three successive trips of months' 
duration. With quiet sympathetic 
tact he has collected the words of

   The slaves shipped to Haiti
were drawn from more than
forty different African tribes,
and each contingent brought its
own pantheon of tribal gods and
spirits, religious songs and
dances, proverbs and folk tales.
   Unlettered people have long
memories, and so, while the new
idiom soon replaced the African
dialects, the old names of sporits,
rivers and kings and the religious
beliefs and songs were too
firmly embedded in the racial
consciousness ever to be completely
forgotten.
   These transplanted spirits,
called loa (Congo name for supernatural
being), jostled one another
in the minds of the Haitians
until, in the course of years, a
strange nature-spirit worship - a

tem.  In it is preserved the history
of the race, and he feels that
to sweep it away indiscriminately
on the plea that it is the creation 
of the devil is but to re-enact the
destruction of early Mexican
culture.
   Drumming, dancing and singing
play a major part in the religious
and social life of the Haitians.
The "drummers become one
with their drums and the drums
come alive.  People move and sing
and vibrate with nature;  they
dance with each other, with their
ancestors, and with old African
gods they have never forgotten.
***This book is the story of
what they sing and what their
singing means to them.  It is the
story of Haiti, which is the child
of Dahomev in Africa."  This is

l'Oncle (Port au Prince, Haiti,
1928), which deserves reprinting
in English.
   Mr. Courlander was not satisfied
just to collect the songs, but
has integrated them in the history
of their people, analyzed
their religious content and, where
possible, traced them to their African
origins.  He explains the
complicated hierarchy of the
houngans (Vodoun priests) and
their accolytes and describes the
songs and ceremonies attendant
on the admission of a neophyte to
the lowest rank--hounsi--in the
course of which the aspirant
plunges his hand into a cauldron
of boiling meal and oil without
apparent injury.  There are accounts
also of the combites of the
cooperative aid societies, of the
mysteriious Vinbindingue association
devoted to Zombiism, of the
cigar-shaped stones, called pouins,
in which the household loa
reside, and of the ouangas, or
protective charm bundles that are
known in Louisiana as gris-gris.
The description of the materialization
of Papa Loko and the dialogue
which took place through
the medium of the houngan, between
this popular loa and the
participants in the ceremony, remind
one of some of the spirituallistic
seances held in New York.
   In Mr. Courlander's careful
musical notations thse Haitian
songs show an overwhelmingly
African influence.  It is the reverse
of Louisiana, where the 
music of the Creole Negroes re-

from their Negro nurses.  In certain
cases this cost her their true
racial quality and has made
some of her versions too similar
to standard French.  How much
more ingenuous and authentic
this line sounds (quoted from a
source not mentioned in her
bibliography):
Aie, yaie, yaie, compair Lapin,
Li un 'ti bougre qui conne danse

than Miss Whitfield's stilted:
Pauv' piti Compere Lapin.
C'est ain bete qaui connain danser.

In the first place her informant
has confused this song with
"Pauv" pitit Mamzelle Zizi," in
the second place "c'est" is not
used in Creole, and her third mistake
is the substitution of the refined
word bete for bougre, which
comes much more naturally to
Negro lips.
   For her Lousiana-French and
Cajun folksongs, however, Miss
Whitfield went directly to the
people whose ancestors had made
them.
   The mention of so many different
kinds of Gallic songs is confusing
unless one knows that, in
Louisiana, three different brands
of French are spoken.  There is
the Creole dialect of the Negroes,
a twin sister of that of Haiti
(a derivative but not a true
French), "Cajun" the archaic
French patois, bastardized with
English words, spoken by the
descendants of Acadians who
came from Canada in the middle
of the eighteenth century,
and the French spoken by the
