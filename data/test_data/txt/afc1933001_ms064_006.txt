Dear Mr. Lomax:

Answering your question concerning what material we 
propose to use in the 1940 Cactus from "Cowboy Songs" and
what acknowledgment would be given, we plan to use part
or all of the "Chisholm Trail," the copyright is acknowledged
at the conclusion of the quotation, and you
are named as collector of all the songs in the collateral 
text material.

We sincerely hope that this arrangement will meet with
your approval.

We conscientiously feel that the 1940 Cactus is going to
be a new high-light in yearbook production, and your
kindness is much appreciated.

                                                         Cordially yours
                                                         [Burt Dyke]
                                                         Burt Dyke
                                                         Business Manager
