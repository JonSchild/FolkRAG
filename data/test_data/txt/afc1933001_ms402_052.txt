10.

Perhaps unintentionally, the Negro often mixes the sacred with

the profane; the religious and the ridiculous.

Long come de Katy Adams
Wid headlight turned down stream 
And her side wheel a-knockin',
Great God, I been redeemed.

Jacob's ladder hitch to a star
Angel ax him, "Is you dar?"
Jacob say: "I'm climbin' sho'
For goodness gracious, don't let go."

Pharaoh's daughter looking for roses,
Pharaoh's daughter looking for roses,
Pharaoh's daughter looking for roses,
Stumped her toe and fell over Moses,
No hiding places down there,
Look out, Sister Hannah, how you walk on the cross,
You' foot might slip and you' soul get lost.

If you to keep the old devil off your track
My Lord's writing down the time
Aim at his head and hit him in the back
My Lord's writing down the time.

When I git to heaven I have nothing to do.
But to walk around the streets and sing halalalu,
My Lords' writing down the time.


Now and then the Negro points out in his spirituals the evils

of fine dress, gossiping and insufficient support of the pastor.

You see dem sisters dressed so fine, 
Well, dey ain't got Jesus on day min'.

There wasn't but one thing I done wrong
I stayed in my sins one day too long.

You may talk about me as much as you please
I'll talk about you by de bendin' of my knees.

You say you are a Christian
And your heart is right
But what make you not go to prayer-meeting
on Wednesday night?
