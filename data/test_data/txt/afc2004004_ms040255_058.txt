1. THE BRESSAY LULLABY
     This is probably the favourite and best known tune throughout
the Islands. It was formally collected in the beginning of this
century and details of it are to be found in the "Shetland Folk
Book", published since the war by the Shetland Times, and edited
by E.S. Reid-Tate.
     The Island of Bressay is the one which encloses the harbour
of Lerwick. It is a pastoral island, rising to a line of high
cliffs in the South, where there is a famous bird sanctuary.
     The singer of the Bressay Lullaby was at the time of its
recording, in 1949, a schoolgirl in Lerwick, Elizabeth Barclay.
Although she was born in the North end of the mainland of
Shetland, her family comes from the Island of Bressay, and she has
the traditional style of singing the tune.
2. THE HENS MAIRCH OWRE THE MIDDEN
     Variants of this tune have been known in Perthshire, but
they're incomplete and this version, which I recorded in Shetland,
is widely known there, so it seems reasonable to regard it as a
genuine Shetland tune. In this recording it is played by one of 
the noted Shetland fiddlers of today - Taamie Anderson. He made
the arrangement of the tune, and is accompanied by Willie Johnson,
on guitar.
     A word of explanation here. Guitar and fiddle is a very
common and highly favoured combination in Shetland. It seemed
to originate about a hundred years ago with some Shetlanders
bringing back guitars from their spells at sea. Traditionally,
Shetland men are fishermen, and, when they have become apprenticed
to that trade, they go deep-sea sailing for anything from ten to
twenty years, trying to earn good money all round the world, by
which time their father is either dead or too feeble to work the
croft. The sailor then gives up his voyages round the world,
and  goes home to farm work and the seasonal fishing. It is the 
ambition of virtually everyone who goes to sea nowadays to buy
a guitar in foreign parts, and learn to play it well enough to
strum in time to the fiddlers who play for dancing. Both Taamie
Andersen and Willie Johnson were fishermen, but in recent years
Taamie has managed to find a good shore job in Lerwick, and he is
to be found there nowadays, working in the famous Fairisle knitwear.
