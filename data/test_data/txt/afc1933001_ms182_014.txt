Dear Sir:

Your name was passed on to me by the agent of
a friend of mine the late Toni Fetzer,Miss Sally Harrison.
I think that she  also represented Margaret Shedd (Kisich)
whose name is not unknown to you.

I am doing a manuscript  which I call Under The
Black Dragon.It is a short story of early Black and Brown
peoples.Miss Harrison who is interested in my effort has
been good enough to suggest certain changes in the manuscript
which I have undertaken.Later it was suggested that it might
be to my advantage to get in touch with you.

I don't know just what to say to you except,that
I place myself and manuscript in your hand for advice and
suggestions. I am now doing a bit of revising and hope to
retype the entire thing  within the  next few weeks.

You must pardon me for barging in upon you,but
this child of mine is about 15 years old,and I am anxious
over its future.It is said that you know your "onions"
when it comes to  literary productions.I wish you to know
that I am always amenable to suggestions and advice of those
who know about these things.I know  little,or nothing about
these things.I have simply had an idea which  has followed
me since youth,and have attempted to give it life.

In this streamlined age,when even literature itself
has not escaped I submit with Miss Harrison that I
need some help. I await your reply Sir.Again I must apologize
for this intrusion.

Very truly yours
Thomas W. Anderson
