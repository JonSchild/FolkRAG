While Mama in de kitchen cookin'
17. You gotta breeze to sail
Sail gal, sail

18. Sand gone, and I goo goo eye
And You say so.

19. Mosquito had a spree
Sandfly come to see
Pocus stand behind de door
Make a solid break.

20. Mama in de bear grass
Havin good time
Mama in de bear grass
Havin good time
Now & again he pulled de stump
Havin good time.
