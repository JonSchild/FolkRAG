72 

The more debas'd and form'd for woe-- 

The darling sin I did commit, 
Was that which some delight in yet ; 
That heinous sin, call'd civil mirth,
God threatens with his dreadful wrath. 

Full eighteen years around did roll, 
Before I thought on my poor soul ; 
Which makes me shudder when I think 
How near I was upon the brink ! 

I oftentimes to church did go,
My beauty and fine clothes to show ; 
But on my soul I took no thought, 
Through Jesus had it dearly bought. 

At length I heard a Baptist preach--
His words quite through my heart did reach--
He said, "I must be born again,  
If ever heaven I'd obtain. 

"In silent watches of the night--
In secret places, where I might
Upon my knees pour out my grief,
And pray to God for some relief." 

My uncle said:  "Don't be so dull ; 
Come, go with me to yonder ball ; 
I'll dress you up in silks so fine--
I'll make you heir of all that's mine." 

Dear uncle, that will never do--
That only will augment my woe ; 
For I'm resolv'd to seek the Lord--
Perhaps he may his help afford. 

"Well, if you are resolv'd to turn, 
And after silly babblers run, 
None of my portion you shall have--
I will it to some others give!"
