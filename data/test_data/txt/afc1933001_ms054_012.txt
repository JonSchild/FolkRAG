Port Aransas, Texas
1/24/39

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

I wish to make several trips from here over to the Rio 
Grande country in Southwest, Texas, about 150 miles away probably 
following the River up as far as El Paso.

Later, when the weather is not so uncertain, I have in mind 
several places in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and 
South Carolina where Folk Songs abound.  A trip to these places 
would bring me over a serpentine route to Washington.

You once mentioned that you had some places to suggest.  
Where?  I'd like to go there also.

I can begin to use the machine as soon as you can get it 
down.  Be sure that it is in first class repair.  Radio experts 
are scarce in these parts.

I sympathize with you deeply in the loss of your mother.

Sincerely always,
John A. Lomax
