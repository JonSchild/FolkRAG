Dear Mrs. Bienstadt:

Sister Mary, Sister Mary de Sales, and the girls of our ninth 
grade join in thanking you for spending an hour with us Wednesday 
morning.  It was indeed a delightful experience.

You made ballads real, interesting, and enjoyable because of what 
you told us about them and by granting us the privilege of trying 
to sing them with you.

We are looking forward to the great pleasure of meeting with you 
again.

Very gratefully yours,

Francine McAllister
Secretary for the Ninth Grade
