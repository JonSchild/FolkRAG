My father, John A. Lomax, started balled hunting in
the West way back in 1907 when he found and first popularized
"The Lone Prairie," "Git Along Little Dogies," "Home on
the Range," "The Boll Weevil" and many other American folk-
songs now well known. In a way, then, I was raised on
American ballads. He took me on my first collecting trip in
1933, and it was at that time we began to make phonograph
recordings for the Library of Congress. In subsequent
years we have helped to build up an Archive of phonograph
recordings for the Library consisting of over twenty
thousand [items]; we've edited together four books on American
folk songs, of which "Our Singing Country" is the last and,
I believe, the closest to the songs and their singers. All
these songs were taken from the lips of ordinary citizens in
the hinterland -- and in a way America seems all hinterland.

The most original music [forever heard has [?]] from cowboys, convicts and
see captains, from lumberjacks, lonesome lovers and levee
camp men, from bankers, bums and bear hunters, from miners,
midwives and mothers -- and when you total their songs,
when you listen to all their lonesome blues and their [dam]
fool ditties, you realize that these people have, without
thinking the business out in advance, made themselves a
great American literature and music. And these people are
nobody else but ourselves and our brothers and sisters.
