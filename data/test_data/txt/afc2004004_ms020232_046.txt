BJ TAPE 18, p. 44

Got the same kind, but some folks slip jointed an' some ain't.
[You know,]  So [there] ain' no tellin' what it may be.   Some folks
have soft bones, an' some don't.  See?  So that might be what
it is, ya know.   S-- the bones soft.   Bone, or may be doin' too
much work or sumpin' or other that jarred it, or hurt it some way
or other.   Because's a little -- it's swelled up.   The fingers
swells up an' [there's a lil'] then this is all around; the nail
come off it an' then.   First thing they know, they loose the whole
finger if they don't start it in time, workin' on it.
TL:       What do you do to get it.
BJ:        Then I, then I learnt that.  I seen this happen, when
bone fellum started.  They hold it over a lamp, a burnin' lamp.
Jus' hol' that finger over that lamp until it git real hot, jus'
hot.   An' jus' keep a-doin' that until it goes to [eats in] eetchin' (itching) to the
bone.  When it starts eats eetchin' [in]to the bone, it gettin' well.    An'
jes' hold it over there right on.
TL:       Itching?
BJ:       Eetch, eetch.  [Jut??] Just eetch ya, ya know?  Yeah, they
say if you're getting well, then. . .An' I've seen it done more
than once, people to hold it over there.   They said the doctor
said the bone fell' started on their fingers and they go right
an' hold it at that lamp, an' um. . .
TL:        That's a kerosene lamp?
BJ:        Kerosene lamp.   Jus' hol' it over there.   Not, not down in
it, 'cause it's hot; that thing's hot, you know.   Jus', jus' hol'
it just enough for you to stan' it.   Jus' enough for your to jus'
stan' it.  Jus' let it jes' cook.  Jes' let it jes' go on.   You
know, not burn ya up, but jus', jus' hold it there an' let that
oil, that oil an' that smoke, co'se , in it, just continue.  Finally
