have left it as Mary Macpherson
transcribed it and that there is a 
variation in each refrain that I
overlooked. Actually it is so easy
that I left it at the time when we were
in the great rush. So the most
important ones for me to get are 
'The Barra Boasting', The Drinking Song
and No 23 - Margaret.
I am afraid that D. Allan's version of 
the Barra Boasting is a hopeless
jumble of the actual words. Historically, 
as far as the Macneil chiefs are 
concerned, its relationships are 
all wrong. Would it not be better 
for you to use Calum Johnston's version
of it, if you have it. I think it would.
You know too that I am very dubious
about the inclusion of the Burgess 
pipe tunes and the "Skye mouth
music." Incidentally I have forgotten
all about that and must get a 
record of it too if I am to transcribe 
and translate it. 

Yours
Sorley.
