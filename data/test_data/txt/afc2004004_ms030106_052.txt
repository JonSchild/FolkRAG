O.K., I'll show you what is a slow swing. Oh, absolutely,
a lot of people have the conception, but the conception is
wrong.  Naturally a person's conception is bound to be wrong
unless they know what they [is] talking about. A lot of times
you may be right, but that only comes from guess work.  The
fact of it is, every musician in America had the wrong understanding 
about jazz music.  Somehow or another it got into the 
dictionary that jazz was considered a lot of blatant noise
and discordant tones, that is something that would be even
harmful to the ears.  I know many [nights] times that I'd be playing
against different orchestras and I would notice some of the
patrons as they would be dancing around. They'd [would] get near
to an orchestra -- (of course I wouldn't permit mine, I'd be a
little more careful than that), they'd get near to [the] an orchestra
and they would [hurt] hold their ears. I heard a very funny fellow
say it once in a colored [dance] band: "That fellow blows any louder,
he'll knock my ear drums down." Of course, you got to be careful
of that.
Jazz music is based on strictly music.  You have the finest
ideas from the greatest operas, symphonies and overtures in
jazz music. There is nothing finer than jazz music because it
comes from everything of the finest class music.
Questioner:   Show us what this discordant type of jazz
was like, Jelly.
Morton:   Well, it so noisy it is impossible for me to prove
to you because I only have one instrument to show [it] to you,
