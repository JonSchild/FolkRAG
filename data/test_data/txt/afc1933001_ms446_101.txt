I'm moving up there to stay. 
I want all my friends to go with me,
I'm moving up home some day. 

3 

In heaven there's no crying, no dying, 
No taxes, no rent to pay ; 
Oh!  that is a wonderful country, 
I'm moving up home some day. 

4 

Up there will be glory forever, 
It never shall pass away; 
Sweet music shall flow like a river,
I'm moving up home some day.

No. 9     My, Didn't It Ran

About five thousand years ago old Noah built the 
ark, 
For God had said, It's going to rain, the sky was getting
dark.
The animals had passed inside, the scoffers standing
'round.
Old Noah pulled the gangplank in, and God did shut 
the door,
The sky grew black, the lightnings flashed, the thunders
they did roar.  OH---

CHORUS 

My, didn't it rain!  My, didn't it rain! 
It poured for forty days and nights, 
The water covered the mountain height.
