Mr. John A. Lomax

Dallas, Texas

Dear Father:

The attached letter is the result of a conversation between
myself and Mr. Griffith, who is agent for one of the largest
school music publishing houses in the country. I would suggest
that you suggest to him some of the following songs: The Gal
I Left Behind Me, The Cowboy's Dream, Leadbelly's Chisholm
Trail, The Kansas Line, Cowboy's Getting Up Holler, Whoopee Ti
Yi Yo, Git Along Little Dogies, Doney Gal, Diamond Joe, Charlie
Quantrell, The Rattlesnake, State of Arkansas, The Red River
Shore, Sioux Indians, The Dreary Black Hills, Joe Bowers, Sweet
Betsy from Pike, The Ox Drover Song (from Our Singing Country),
The Texian Boys.

Within a few days I will have an approval for an additional
$150 out of the total of $800 allotted for your and Mrs. Tartt's
trip. I'll have to guess about how many additional discs and
needles you will require. Don't worry about Mrs. Tartt's
trip next spring, because at that time if it turns out she needs
a little more money, possibly that can be arranged after I
consult with Mr. Spivacke.

I have seen Bess a couple of times in the past two or
three weeks, and she is very well and her job is going along
successfully. I think that she plans to apply for a Rosenwald
fellowship next year to study the hillbilly movement in the
South. I'll see her again soon and let you know what the
news of her is. I don't see why we should change our agreement
about the books now. I am completely reconciled to our
present agreement, and it seems to me that, at least at the
moment, you and presumably your estate profit from the existing
arrangement. I am perfectly willing, in fact I prefer, that
you continue to handle all matters of use of the songs, and
you may be sure that I shall not again imply that any of your
songs can be used in any fashion without your specific permission.
It seems to me that if our present arrangement were
discussed with John and Shirley they would agree that it is a
fair one.
