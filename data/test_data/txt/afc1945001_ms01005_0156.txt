Dear Miss Shannon:

            I appreciate your sending me, with Mr. Kane's 
permission, the copy of Surveys Division Special
Report on Wartime Rumors in Two Western Cities.
I enclose a few comments.

            Within a few days you should receive a copy of
Mr. Knapp's report on one thousand rumors from all
over the country. I am very anxious to have your
office compare these two reports. Actually I am
sending Mr. Katz a preliminary copy of Mr. Knapp's
report now. I will send several mimeographed copies
to your office as soon as they are ready.

                                                     Yours sincerely,
                                                          [*Gordon W. Allport*]
