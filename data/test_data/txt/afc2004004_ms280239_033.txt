     Now the farm servant to this day. . . You have to notice
that you pay him right, and you have to notice that you count
up his little bits of things. You get him right down but
he'll hardly ever do it himself, with all his education. . .
And this lad, he just sat up and let me count up his money,
and I paid him. Now just listen to this. . . there's a good
bit coming. . . .
     There's a loon. . . . . I paid Morrison and bade him goodbye
and told him I was terribly pleased and he would come back
and see me and. . . . He wasn't well away and I remembered I
gave him a cheque for two guineas - and I'd no money - and
I'd forgot about it. . . . His father was a grand officer. . .
     This chap Taylor. . . . . . and I said "So you're going to
Canada next". I said "Oh, ay".  Oh, he was going to start
by going to Winnipeg. "Weel" I said "They tell me Morrison's
about Winnipeg" and I said "Look here, if you see Morrison
tell him I gave him about two pounds more than I was due him.
Tell him to invite all you boys that ever knew me and spend
that two pounds in drink. And remember me when you're
drinking it". (Now wouldn't you have thought that was all
right?) Do you notice that that man went right out to
Canada to Winnipeg and be it a month or six weeks I had a 
letter from Morrison and I got dollar bills in the letter
which I got two pounds and sixpence for . . . . "I hope
it's no bad feeling about it", he said to me in this letter.
"Mr. John Strachan, Dear Sir," . . . . . . . . . . 
     The men didn't feed with me. They got the same food I
got, but I wouldn't have sat at the table with them, because
they wouldn't have enjoyed themselves. They wouldn't have
spoken. They would have had no freedom. . . . . 
     And we were always told that the Canadian farmer paid
his men and made them friends and things of that kind.
