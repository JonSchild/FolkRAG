I Know the Lord Will Make a Way

I know the Lord will make a way,
O yes he will,
I know the Lord will make a way,
O yes he will,
He'll be a rock and [a] shelter
He'll lead you to the land,
I know the Lord will make a way,
O yes he will.

He is water in dry places,
[O yes, he is]
I knows he is,
He is water in dry places,
God knows he is,
God knows he's bread in a starvin land

I know the Lord will make a way,
I know he will.
