phone her there. This morning she
sent him a note at last. And 
tomorrow she has her first lunch
with "friends." I am mildly
jealous. More, however, I am sick
with mortification and a sense of
failure. Will I never choose a girl
whom I can satisfy? She doesn't
love me. She is practicing on me, probably 
without knowing it, the wiles and
charms she will need later on to
handle the man she really decides to
mate with. If I had sufficient
pride I would leave in the
morning or tell her to get out
because she is between me and
the sun - rather my need for her
is between me and the sun.
