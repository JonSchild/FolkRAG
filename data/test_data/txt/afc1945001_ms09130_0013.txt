12B      Girl      White

1.  They say that we are giving
  up such things as butter
  and coffee so the army can
  have more, but I heard that
  some of the soldiers dont get
  any butter at all and only
  one cup of coffee a day.
2.  When the Japanese capture our
  soldiers the torture them
  something terrible.  Cut their
  fingers off brand them etc
3.  In some of the defense plants
  they just loaf around because
  they dont have enough work to
  keep them busy.
4.  Some say Hitler is dead
