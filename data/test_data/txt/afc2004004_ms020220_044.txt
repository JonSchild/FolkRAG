TL: Were you?
BJ: Yeah! Then I began to go on, ya know, from that. So long
after that -- Well, I quit pickin' cotton 'tween that time an' I
reckon wa' about fo', five years, workin' in towns, ya know, an'
places. Tha's when I -- After I done got up grown an' lef' home
an' all, see? An' so, but when I began to pick again, I was in Millen,
Georgia, an' [,an I] we was stayin' in this town, but we'd go out in
the country an' pick cotton, you know. Tha' wa' jus' [to make] makin'
extra money. More money than you work -- Than you would in the
houses, workin', see?
     An' so, there's a lady there, she, she could pick around
240 or 50 every day. An' uh she was comin' home [an' this--They]
-- In this neighborhood we [was] lived in [then] , she wa' about the bes'
in that neighborhood. An' every day she come home, she brag about
it. An' I had never been with her pickin'. I said, "Lawd, I hope
I never go to be with her!" 'Cause she make me sick; I didn't
like the way she bragged. An' then she, an' she was sort of a -- I --
ah, she was built up funny, too, ya know, an' lookted kinda
funny to me. An' I jus' didn' like her; I didn't want her to
brag at me, yes, Lawd!
     An' so, I didn't (know how in the worl' it would be?) with
her pickin'. One Monday it come that we did -- When the man come
around; everybody was on the same trucks, you know, goin' out
pickin'. I said, "Now I'm with her."
     And that Sunday before, you see, she had been out on a
hoopie[, see]. She, she drink. An'...
TL: A hoop...? A hoopie?
BJ: She drink. Yeah, I call it a hoopie. She had been out on
a hoopie an' she drink heavy, ya see. An' that Monday's hot. Hah!
