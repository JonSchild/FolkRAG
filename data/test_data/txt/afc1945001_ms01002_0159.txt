Dear Mrs. Roosevelt -

Your are very busy but I am naive enough to think that
I can write down an idea and have it reach you.  I 
write to you because I think the idea is worth considering.  
Here, in brief, is the idea-

There is the problem of counteracting, controlling
and defeating wild rumors.  you can, of course, say 
"Don't Spread Rumors."  But it is humna nature to 
want to repeat what you hear.  So -

Why not take advantage of this human inclination
and set up an official Answerer of Rumors (call him
what you will).  And then each person hearing a 
rumor could go and tell it to this official.  The
official would formally record the rumor in black
and white and would answer or get the answer to
the rumor.  In this way -

The government could keep track of rumors, check 
and trace them, and give people the satisfaction
of helping instead of the unsatisfied feeling of
refraining from talking.  And once the people
are allowed to tell a rumor to an official, they'll
have less desire to spread it willy nilly.  The rumor
then will become a concrete thing that will show 
itself to be a force for evil - and people will
be less apt to toy with it.

There it is for your consideration.

Yours truly
