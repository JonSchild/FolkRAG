8. As yet I can hear nothing
of Mrs. Tartt though I wrote
to her the day Mr.
Spivacke sent authority for
the trip. She may be ill, or
she may having trouble getting
[?] release from some small
[?] W.P.A. job. Don 't send a converter
there until we hear.
I am very pleased [?] you
can write of "savings." The finest
single instrument I can suggest, if
you have not already acted, is for
you to take out sickness and hospitalization
insurance both for yourself 
and for Elizabeth. And you surely
should insure your life in her
favor. Your dictation runs more
smoothly. Be sure to write to
dear sick Bess Brown. Lovingly,
Father.
