Imagine a museum with a great
collection of the heads of the cattle
that made Texas famous, and that
stamped the Texas tradition on the 
whole western part of the United
States! Imagine a full collection of
rawhide art, of horsehair art, of
saddles and other horse gear, of
ranch house and chuck wagon equipment,
of range pictures and all
sorts of artifacts! There is nothing
like it in the world, and of all
places it should be in Texas. A
kind of civilization and a mighty
tradition known all over the world
have grown out of ranching. This
museum would attract hundreds of
thousands of visitors, besides being
of primary interest and educational
value to Texas themselves."
    Another writer-visitor of the week
was Mrs. Helena Pringle of New
York, who, under her maiden name,
Helena Huntington Smith, wrote E.
C. Abbott's life, entitled "We Pointed
Them North." I used to have
letters from Abbott. He was known
as Teddy Blue and signed that
name, his address being Three
Deuce ranch, Gilt Edge, Mont. He'd
seen the elephant and hear the
owl on range and trail from Texas
to Canada. He was full of spunk 
and originality. When he informed
me that Helena Huntington was
writing down his life story, I feared
that all the flavor and fire would
be refined out of it. The result,
however, is one of the liveliest and
most veracious range books ever
printed. It came out last year. Now


[rups?] could not be bought big
enough to hoop a keg of nails with.
Uncle Dan doesn't charge anything
for seeing his museum. All I bought
from him was a can of pipe tobacco.
I wish I had bought several cans.
    The part of Bosque county I wanted
most to see was Koss Barry. I
got to his little ranch about an
hour by sun. He was in the pen
with his sheep and cattle, too busy
to talk till after supper, he said,
but would I stay all night? I would.
His wife, "Miss Lulu," was at the
pen, too, when I arrived. I liked
her also. I decided to explore the
burr oaks and pecans up and down
the East Bosque, beside which the
home is built. A little before dark
Mr. Barry led me out between two
live oak trees.
    "These trees," he said, "determine
one corner of the section of land
that my father traded a horse for
in 1845. He was living in Navarro
county, where I was born in 1850,
but we moved out her not long
afterwards. The land is sacred to
me."
Stranger from Houston
    He went on to tell how along in
the 1850's a stranger from Houston
rode up to their home one evening
on a very tired horse. He asked for
Buck Barry. Mrs. Barry told him
that Buck was out on the range and
probably would not be in until late.
The stranger said he wanted information
about a league of land he
owned in the vicinity. He was too


in the good old way.
    Miss Lulu produced a well-
scorched wooden shingle, laid it flat
on the hearth, and propped  big
slab of cornbread upon it with a
fork. After the slab had been turned
so that both sides were beautifully
toasted, we ate supper, with goblets
of milk to go with the bread.
It was, I believe, the best cornbread
I have ever eaten--and I am mighty
fond or cornbread. For breakfast
we had dried beefsteak, thick flour
gravy and the hot biscuits that naturally
combine. I didn't need to 
eat dinner.
Says "Texians"
Koss Barry says "Texians," not
"Texans." He is a Texian himself.
He talked more about his father
than about himself. Buck Barry
taught school in North Carolina before
he came to Texas to help redeem
Texas from the wilderness
and the Mexicans and to become
the most noted Indian fighter of
central Texas. Having an education
probably caused him to write his
reminiscences. The manuscripts are
now in the archive of the University
of Texas, most of the having
been printed in James K.
Greer's biography. I walked up on
the hill to see the rock tomb he
made for himself before he died.
Beside it is an empty tomb that his
son has made ready for himself. He
is too eagerly interested in raising
price Polled Angus cattle, however,
to fill it soon. "I never intentionally
harmed a man in my life," he
commented. I looked into his clear,
good face.
    The sun of a fine Sunday morning
was half way up the sky when I
told him and Miss Lulu goodbye.
If I had attended camp meeting
services for a week I would not have
felt as blesed. They can industrialize
Texas until it grows a dozen
Pittsburghs and is filled up with
enough factory hands to damn up
the Rio Grande and make it cut another
Big Bed--without producing
a single Barry character.
    It was noon when I got to the
little town of Morgan. There I saw
another private pioneer museum in
the one drug store. I accosted one
of the three or four men on the
street to ask the way to Ed Nichols'
place. This man not only gave
me directions, but his own name,
got mine, and asked me to dinner
with him. Ed Nichols thought I
might as well stay all night.
Used to Run Horses
    Ed Nichols used to run horses
and cattle all over that country, and
he went up the trail. His father
collected the data for Thrall's
School History of Texas--a text
supplanted by the famous Pennybacker
History of Texas. I hope
Mr. Ed publishes soon the autobiography
he is writing. I'll tell
an anecdote involving him that
John Lomax, one of the best talkers,
not only in Texas, but in America,
told me.
    A few years ago he took Ed
Nichols out to the S. M. S. cowboy
reunion at Stamford. They were
sitting on the ground with another
old waddie named Jeff Hanna watching
the rodeo performances, when
Lomax noticed Will Rogers almost
by his side. Will Rogers had slipped
in unannounced, and wanted to
watch instead of being watched.
However, he was glad to see Lomax
and gladder still to meet the veteran
cowhands that Lomax introduced.
    "How long you been out in this


of the kindest-hearted fellers you
ever see. When he was riding wes
from Bosque county one time, he
sorter found in convenient to ride
in the night."
    "Uh huh," and some winks.
Hears Cow Bawling
    "Well, he was coming along way late
and the moon was down and i
was as dark as the inside of a cow
He was in a bottom, down clost t
a creek, when he begun to hear
cow bawling, but he couldn't locat
her. He seemed to be near he
and he knew from the way she wa
going on she was in trouble and appealing
for help. You know how
one of them old-timey cows coul
talk."
    "She shore could," Will Roger
agreed.
    "Well, d'reckly Ed here got dow
off his horse and begun feelin
along the ground. Purty soon h
come to the edge of an old wel
and then he realized the cow ha
fell in. She didn't seem to be hur
though, from the way she was talking.
Ed knew he coudn't pull he
up by hisself with a rope, but h
jest couldn't ride off and leave he
on account of his soft heart.
    "What you guess he did? Well, a
I said, he was clost to a runnin
creek. He went to the water an
got a hatfull of it and brought
back and poured it in the well. H
kept packing water that way ti
daylight, the cow sorter floatin
and swimming until finally the water
was high enough for her
scramble out."
    I went to see Frank Hornbuckle
too, who was Ew Nichols' side partner
on the trail. He rides to tow
nearly every day on a horse that,
as soon as he is tied, the children borrow
and poke around on.
    To me Bosque county is Texa
There are lots of other good counties
in Texas and lots of other Texians
besides that I have mentione
As is nearly all sections of Tex
where land is still used for grazin
wealthy oil men are buying it u
amalgamating small tracts of la
into sizeable bodies. No oil man
going to buy out Ed Nichols
Frank Hronbuckle or Koss Bar
though. I still hear Mr. Koss saying,
"This land is sacred to me."
