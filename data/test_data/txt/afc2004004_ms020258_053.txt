a watch night song

Oh, day!
Yonder come day.
Day done broke into my soul.    (3)

Yonder come day,
Oh, come on, day,
Yonder come day,
Day done broke into my soul.  (3)

Yonder come day,
It's a dyin' day,
Yonder come day,  (3)
Day done broke into my soul.

It's a New Year's day, etc.

Oh, come on, day, etc.
It's a dyin' day, etc.
It's a buryin' day, etc.
Oh, come on, day, etc.
Yonder come day!
