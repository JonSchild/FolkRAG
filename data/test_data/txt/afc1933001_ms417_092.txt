sin' gonna go.
I ain't gonna study war no more.

Long around the end of this book we put in a lot of
songs from all over, which we couldn't fit very easily anywhere
else. We're speaking our mind on anything and everything. I'm
singing about the outlaws, who tried to blastbtheir way out of
this system with a six gun. I'm singing of Jesus Christ and how
he would be put in jail if he preached today what he preached
in Galilee. I'm singing the songs that the earlier union
men over here sang, the I W W 's.
I'm singing the Bourge[i]ois Blues, but I'm telling you, mister
Boss, we're the guys that raise your grub, and made you rich, and
we're lettin' you know we're not so slow, we're rarin' to go and
we're takin' the show.

Once...I was worried now,
But.. I won't be worried long.
