It occurred to me that it would
be wonderful to make a film
of the Decameron - using an Italian
setting - of a city bombed out
[in] with an atom bomb and
the refugees telling each other
stories to while away the time ...

But another movie idea - 
the story of Maruth the Cobler & His
Wife Fatima.
She drives him away by her
shrewishness
The Jinn carries him to a 
foreign city. He pretends to
be rich & finally marries the
king's daughter on credit. Wait
till my baggage arrives.
Just as he is about to be exposed,
his loving wife warns him & he
flees & accidentally discovers a fortune
