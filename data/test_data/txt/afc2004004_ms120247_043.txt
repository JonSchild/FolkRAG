57A52

Dahomey-wy, ma sa nous de,
Dahomey-wy, ma sa nous de,
Dahomey wy, ma sa nous de-o.

57A3 

The same song after the dance had gone for several minutes.

57B1

Mazon (the same as the/ mardi gras rhythm)
A popular song or chanson
courante which is a particular 
favorite of Papa Damballa's
(or of Theoline when
Damballa possesses her).
Lead by Theoline.

The mazon is usually the last of 
the triplet of rhythms in honor
of any particular loi---the
order may being: Yen Valour,
Zepol, Mazon. However, the mazon
is often left out for some time
and then may be called into use
to dismiss the spirits. The rhythm is very similar to the
rhythm of the mascaron and rara dances, which ares ensual
and festive, rather than sacred as the
vaudoo rhythms. Possibly this song itself was once a popular
mardi gras song, that has been adopted by this particular
hounfort as a semi-sacred song. It is evidently a favorite,
because I have heard it sung at other ceremonies.

Refrain: Goupi pou' de goudin delia coupi done,
Jalousie pas la mode,
Refrain and etc...

57B2
Zepol
Papa Dumballa
same as 56B2 at a faster tempo. Lead by Theoline.

Dumballa Wedo, encore wi-en-e,
'co'-wi-en, Damballa Wedo, 'co' -wi-en-e,
etc...

(Note that the worst are written "co-wi-en" instead of 
"gwe-wi-en". When I first transcribed them they were given
by the person helping me as "do-wi-en". Co-wi-en is Theoline's
version, gwe-wi-en is Elize's, and do-wi-en is Revoli's.
The world is langage and no one knows the "proper" pronunciation.)

57B3 Yen Valou
To the flags

This marks the end of the ceremony proper.
