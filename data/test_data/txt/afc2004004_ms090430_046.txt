The Agricultural Pattern

Cotton cultivation has fluctuated in importance in the agricultural life of the county.  In 1919 about one-fourth of all land in farms was planted in cotton.  The proportion was about the same in 1924, but by 1929 the acreage in cotton had increased by one-half and formed about one-third of the total farm acreage.  From this peak in 1929 the acreage in cotton contracted sharply.  In 1934, although the total farm acreage increased, the acreage in cotton had fallen to one-fourth of the total.

As cotton has declined there has been an increasing emphasis upon hay and sorghum for forage.  This shift in type of farming is typical of the declining cotton areas.  It has precipitated a marked dislocation in the life and habits of the Negro farm population.  Most of the tenants and sharecroppers have been schooled to grow cotton and know no other agriculture.  They are in fact uncomfortable in other occupations.  One Negro tenant, for example, as a result of the innovations introduced by the Tennessee Valley Authority had an opportunity to work on a farm that practiced diversification.  He cleared more cash that year than he had ever made with cotton, but restlessly went back to a cotton farm the next year.  This fundamental readjustment of farming habits has created serious problems for many of the Negro families.

There is an interesting variant in the pattern of agriculture.  Large plantations cannot flourish in the area because of the poorer quality of the soil.  Cotton is raised, but on smaller farms and the smaller farms have fewer tenants.  This was, in fact, one of the areas into which the smaller white farmers were pushed by the stronger plantations as they took over the richer lands of the southern portion of the state.
