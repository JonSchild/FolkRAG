UNITED FRONT SONG
Words by Bert Brecht   Music by Hanns Eisler

AND JUST BECAUSE HE'S HUMAN A MAN WOULD LIKE A LITTLE BIT TO 
EAT. HE WON'T FILL UP ON A LOT OF TALK THAT WON'T BRING HIM BREAD AND MEAT.
SO, LEFT, TWO, THREE, SO LEFT, TWO , THREE, TO THE WORK THAT WE MUST DO. MARCH
ON IN THE WORKERS' U-NIT-ED FRONT FOR YOU ARE A WORK-ER TOO.

II. And just because he's human,
    He doesn't like a pistol to his head,
    He wants no servants under him
    And no boss overhead.
(REFRAIN)

III. And just because he's a worker,
The job is all his own,
The liberation of the working class 
Is the job of the workers alone.
(REFRAIN0
