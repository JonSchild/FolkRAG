Research on War Attitudes (Continued) 2

underlying question will be what kinds of policies and appeals can most
effectively reach such groups in terms of their own concrete experiences
and personal goals. How can they best be brought to feel that the war
hold promise for them and that they can afford to submerge their separate
interests for the sake of the greater gains for themselves (as contrasted
with so much of the general type of appeal which sounds nice but leaves
people unmoved?)

Questions of the kind pointed to here will include "dangerous" ones
which a government agency probably would find it unwise to ask. For example,
we should try to gain light on how far different parts of the community
genuinely believe in and really desire democratic controls in government
and in industry. How far do people want a "social revolution"––or Wallace's
"century of the common man"? And what lies back of these attitudes?

Our immediate research task will be to formulate more fully and carefully
the types of information to be sought along the lines suggested in
these preceding paragraphs.

2. The second question has to do with techniques of inquiry and with
the validity of findings obtained by alternative techniques. It is proposed
here to carry on small scale exploratory studies with the following methods:

a. Direct interview techniques of the usual type, including both
short–answer and free–answer questions. This ordinary interview
procedure is included primarily for comparative pruposes; the results will
be checked against those obtained by other methods. In addition, the interviews
will constitute a necessary basis for procedure (b) described in the
next paragraph.

b. A few days after the usual interview has been completed, a second
