Fisk, 8. 6. ‘ M. C. ORR

[There was some] Once the animals were having a convention and the water ran out and [there been nothing for drinking] and the 
rabbit got up and said, "The ugliest man in the house get up and 
get some water."  The bear jumped up and grabbed a chair, and say, "I come here for meeting;
I didn't come here for foolishness."

THE BIG MOSQUITOES [Will Stark]

Once I went visiting my granddaddy, and the m[o]usquitoes was plenty bad 
down there.  He sent me one [mornn] morning to tie up the cow and calf. And that 
evening when I went back down there after the cow, the m[o]usquitoes hadn't [left] let the 
cow up and [she] was sitting up [on] there on the stump, rining the bell 
for the calf. 

THE MAN WHO WALKED ON THE WATER

I had an uncle who was going to walk on the water once like Christ did.
He had a fellow to go the river and put someplanks on the river about an inch 
in the water.  Then some them little boys watched the fellows and went down there and moved one 
of the planks off the [board. S] two side, so he went down there that day, and he 
started on across and he got on up there [theyleft the] the missing plank [board] was 
just as he [?] step[ped] on the missing plank, he went under.  He went under 
and he come up, and a b[o]ig fat sister [stood] standing on the bank -- "Save 
him, Lawd. Save him, Lawd."  So he come up and he [come back up,] went down the 2nd time 
she says, "Save him, Lawd; Save him, La d." And the third time he come 
up, she says, "Save him, Lawd." And he says, "Save [me], Hell, who in 
hell put that other plank away from [me] here?” (laughter)
