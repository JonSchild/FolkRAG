Reverend Roe.  Ree l 9.  P.4
A: And of course you also have to be worried that she's gonna turn 
against you.
R: That's right.
A: Turn some of the people against you -- tell [wives] lies on you.
R: That's right.
A: Women wil do that, they sorta get so insulted at you when you turn them 
down, they're liable to do almost anything.
R: Oh yeah, I had them to do me that way. Yes sir, They [said] say that 
I tried to rape them [al l] all most, and things like that. But you've got to 
[*Women will work against you if you turn them down.*]
stand up; there's some danger in it. To do right, brother, you must 
[put] bear on so me hard[ness]ship; you've got it to do. Someties you'll have to 
run away and leave a place, yeah, just because you won't do wrong. Some of
my worst prosecutions come that way. Say, for an instance, you're in a 
church and there's a woman there that wants you to lay around with her, 
and you refuse to do it, and finally she'll turn against you and 'll ac-
cuse you of every woman she see you talking with and just talk about 
you. And generally it's a woman that has some influence in the church; 
and she'll turn lots of people sometime against you. It's kinda hard; 
[it] and it makes some [men] ministers to fall, and make up with her and [get along]go to [going?] with
her to [make] get her to hush, yes sir.
A: Has any of those women actually prevailed against you [and] actually helped 
to drive you out of a congregation.
R: They did it right here, oh yeah. The worst fight [I ever] I've had here 
was just along that line.
A: Tell me about it.
[*A woman accuses him to the church*]
R: Well, there's a women that she wanted me to lay up there with her, 
and I refused to do it, and because I wouldn't, you know, she [was] began 
[gonna] to get mad with me, you know, and she would watch my huse and every 
woman she'd see go in there, she'd accuse me of em, you know. And 
there's a girl that live right here close to this church -- she have two chil-
dren now
