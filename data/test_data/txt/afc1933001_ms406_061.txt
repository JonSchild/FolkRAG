He was kind enough to [read them through] take my cherished ballads home with him that next morning, but told me firmly and kindly that
I had best do my research in some other realm of study.
I lived in Breckenridge House, the man's dormitory.  In
deep humiliation I took my little cylinder of
songs and behind the Halls where their [????]

I wish I had kept them.

Some years later in Harvard University I studies contemporary
American literature under Professor Barrett Wendell. Being 
required to write a term theme on some phase of literature,
preferably about some local author, I selected with some trepidation the
subject of cowboy songs.  Professor Wendell had his conferences in 
Gray's Hall in Harvard Square.  I shall always remember vividly my
first interview with him.  He sat before a blazing open fireplace--a
big brown-bearded, English-looking man with kind eyes and a blistering expansive
manner of speech.  Timidly I told him my choice for a thesis subject.
He was immediately interested and boomed :  "Do you mean to tell me that

interview came a new interest in my life.
Through Professor Wendell's kind offices I soon met
Professor George Lyman Kittridge, the lineal successor of
Francis J. Child in the field of balladry and one of the great English
scholars of all time.  One day while crossing Harvard Yard someone
tapped my shoulder, "Is your name Lomax?' "Yes, it is."
Then, "I'm Professor Kittridge.  Can you come to my home
to dinner tomorrow?"  [???????]" Lo! I've made some [?????] and gone.
I wrote my paper on cowboy songs and read it
to the class in American literature.  Even the sleepy boys sat up and cheered when I sang.  Meanwhile Professor Wendell and Professor Kittridge, joined by Dean Briggs and Professor Fred
Robinson, authorized me to send out a letter under their names
to several thousand newspapers [in] throughout the west asking their readers to
