Mr. Edward P. Jennings
Pawlet, Vermont

Dear Mr. Jennings:

     I know your spiritual recordings are valuable
material. We are faced with this problem at the moment:
We cannot make pressings. We can, however, make you 
duplicates of your records on aluminum which would stand
up under a great deal of playing. When the records are
finally pressed, if ever, we would certainly furnish you
with a set of pressings. I don't know what you mean
by hard records. I hope you mean aluminum.

     Miss Flanders has offered to pay mileage for
a months recording in Vermont and I have taken up with
Dr. Charles Seeter, Assistant Director of the Music Project
and Chairman of the Folk Arts Committee of WPA, the 
matter of compensating you for such time as you might spend
in the field recording. This might possibly be on the
WPA music project. You will hear from him in this regard.
In the mean time I will inform Miss Flanders and Mr.
Thompson of what has been done so far. With best regards,
I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax 
Assistant in Charge
