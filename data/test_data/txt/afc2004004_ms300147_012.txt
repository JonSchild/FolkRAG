          the Lecture Bureau would be responsible for
          the collection of fees for services rendered
          by Mr. Lomax in connection with engagements.

Attached to this letter, you will find a copy of some biographical
material about Alan, as well as some other material which I
feel will be of aid to you.

Under separate cover, I am sending to you several copies
of some of his record albums.
                                                                      Cordially,
