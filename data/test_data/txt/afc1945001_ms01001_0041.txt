New England because reclamation plants, even though now
processing scrap rubber at the rate of one ton every
minute, will be working the remainder of this year before
they can utilize all the scrap collected. The rumor has
been more widespread than was at first apparent and now
from Mr. Taylor's office comes this further information:
"In practically every case the scrap rubber piles are being
held for disposal of the government. Representatives
of WPB, all of them thoroughly experienced in the scrap

"ANSWER--What would the rumormonger suggest? That we're
so incapable of meeting domestic problems that it would
be better right now to turn America over to the Japs and
Germans?"
Where would we stand if the reader were inclined to say "yes"
in answer to the last question, or if the reader believed that there
might be some advantages to certain types of change?
The following is an example of a better method of replying
to a rumor:
"RUMOR--New York is full of English soldiers and sailors.
All you have to do is walk around Times Square; it looks
