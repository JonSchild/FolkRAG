the steering wheel lock, said that my suitcase, books, clothes, music, guitar, title
to car, were probably scattered all over the South side by hoodlums out on their
midnight joy-ride, didn't know the value of property. On the spare rack there was
nothing; the thieves pulled a pickle there, ne c'est pas? On three wheels were wheels 
like those on the Ford before last, with small but sturdy locking tires; they had
merely switched the wheels from [their] our car to theirs. Our new tire they

the station and file a complaint and perhaps put an ad. in the Hearst paper.
We can, I think, go home on the tires and wheels that the thieves gave us. I shall, 
however, before I see you, be forced to buy a spare and lock and a few clothes, 
tooth-brush, razor, nothing more.
