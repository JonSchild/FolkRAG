[*MEN-SUPERIORITY OF, AND FAILURE TO RULE RIGHT*]
BJ:   (Cont.)   All right, now if God hadn't, hadn't meant for that
to be done, he give man the great' authority than anything [on] upon
earth.  Ya see.  'Cause man got great authority, than anything
upon earth.  'Cause he's over everything. He['s] over the womens,
the beasts an' everything else, ya see?   Whether he rule it right
or not.   He; he's over it, 'cause, honestly, they don't rule it 
right; that's why, you know, in a way, ya see.  'Cause if mens
rule everything right, there wouldn't be no drunken women, they
wouldn't be no, nor ah, addlebacked (?) womens, 'cause any man
would stop 'em.   An' he'd be right to stop 'em.  Ya see?  An'
nary wouldn't get mad about it.   Any man.
        They wouldn't start 'em from the beginnin' goin' to jooks
'cause the men wouldn't carry 'em; there wouldn't be none, in a 
way of speakin'.  The men would be rulin' it right.  Ya see,
'cause He said woman -- the woman supposed to obey her husband
in da Lawd.   He didn't say in da Devil, ya see?   Well, the mens
take the womens and carry 'em to the jooks an' learn 'em how to
rob; learn 'em how to steal; gi' 'em a little drink; an' mix it
an' mix it an' mix it until finally she gets flogged out, 'cause
she not as strong as he is in no way.  An' af' she gets flog'
out then he's first thing to call you "An old drunken this" and "[an] you old drunken
that."  See?  Yet, they started it.
     From, from the foundation; sometimes it's the father.  In 
the house.  Begin it, ya know.  He jus' a man; tha's all.  The
man supposed to rule.  There's a man somewhere, at some some point.
'Cause sometime the father starteds it, in the house, an' the
brothers.  Then they get out an' marry somebody an' the [mens] man say,
"I don't want you to do thus-and-so."
       "I been doin' it all my days; I [won't, I won't] want. . .I
