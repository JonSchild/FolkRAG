readily I can't give you any information on what Dr. Higley was like perhapes. Aunt Vergie can give you some light on this, also Mr. Reese no doubt was more or less right [yes] as I am the youngest of this Harlan family
I do not know only by hearing what my folks said - 
58 years old. even my oldest sister wouldn't remember any thing about this.

I was not at home when this interview was given, but was told all about it of course. It was all so very interesting to my father & mother and of course much more so. when the lawyer from New York City came to see them some say perhapes we may be able to talk face to face and it would be a pleasure. to see you. & see by the heading of your letter you are a busy man. and your work looks like it would be very interesting. please forward the enclosed article on to Calif to the address and I will write her that you are sending it Will be glad to hear from you at any time

Respectfully
Mrs. Emmet Worner
