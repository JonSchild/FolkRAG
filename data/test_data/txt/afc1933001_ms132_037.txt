My dear Mr. Lomax:
I have heard very gratifying reports of your contacts at Vincennes and New Harmony and have had some expressions of disappointment, from other Hoosier prospects whom you were unable to see on this round. I should be glad to hear from you as to the number of our prospects you were able to make and as to when you expect your next round if I know of it far enough in advance. 
With best wishes, I am.
Yours sincerely,
Rose F. Lockridge
