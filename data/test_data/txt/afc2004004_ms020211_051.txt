Dear Bessie,

I have just received a letter form the Walker Art
Center telling me that the people in Minneapolis
were delighted by the performance of the group.
They would like to write you all letters of thanks,
but I have addresses for only you, John and Mabel.
Would you sen me the other addresses so that I
may have them in my own files and also forward
them all on to Minneapolis.

They also say they must have a receipt for the
$150 which they gave you for the group in order
to straighten out their records.  I have enclosed
a receipt, and if you'll just sign it and sent
it back to me, I'll get it back to the Walker
Art Center.

I hope you all had a good trip and that it was
worthwhile for you.  The Idyllwild people in
California think they would like the group
in the summer of 1965 (next year), so I am
trying to arrange a tour around that with Ed
Pearl.

Love from Anne, Dena and myself,

Alan Lomax
