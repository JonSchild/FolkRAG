Scotland
5th January, 1952

Dear Annie,

Attached is a copy of the
BBC letter to Mrs. MacNeil.  Mrs. Mary
Morrison is to be used on a programme
I have just completed with Shamus Ennis
and I will arrange for her to be paid
then. Between friends, I overspent my
budget on the first show, so need to
handle the thing in this way.  Of course, 
you know I have paid Mrs. Morrison for
all her material for Columbia.  I hope
that will settle everything all right.

You were very sweet to write to me
about this and all together I feel very
happy about my meeting with your family
and the Hebrides.  If only Scotland were
like your Islands.

All the best for 1952,
Yours,
Alan Lomax
