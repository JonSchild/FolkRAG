Dear Allan:

   We are all living in our
new home.  We found a bantam
rooster on the place about as
big as my fist.  He thinks the
17 broiler-sized chickens we
brought along are grown [?]
he is.  Yesterday, that bantam
rooster nearly ran himself
to death after these young chickens
They were so scared that they
stayed in the brush all day
