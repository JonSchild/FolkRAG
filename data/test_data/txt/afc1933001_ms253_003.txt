Alan:
1. I found that we had left the
Strunk-annotated  Ballad book
at (of all places) at Meridian, Texas.
I am sending to you 
under separate cover. 
2. Take your "whack" at it, please, 
before you leave Washington
Don't take it to New York.
3. When you are done [with?]
have a talk with Mrs. Seeger
about it and leave it with her
4. Please note that Macmillans says
that [every] each change in minimal
notation will cost (us) $2.50
At that rate Strunk's suggestions
would run to $500 or more
Strunk perhaps did and does 
not and never will understand
