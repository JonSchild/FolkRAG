Dear Alan:
I am enclosing the memorandum I prepared for 
my project director for him to forward up the line until 
it clarifies the situation. You must understand 
that I prepared it to have a tone that does not put the 
blame on the person sending the telegram. I cannot be
sure that this is the memo that will finally arrive.
However, as I told you I asked Mr. Clayton what I had
told him and he was very positive not only that no
reflections had been made either on the possible handling 
of the machine or that he had any impression that
anything was expected to go wrong. He had asked me to 
be sure to tell you directly that the telegram sent by
his superior's office does not reflect in any way the tone
of his conversation on the subject. Obviously some person
has officiously taken an attitude of extreme precaution.
I am naturally very much upset by the situation
which you felt, completely erroneously, to have a personal
basis. The memorandum that I enclose is a very literal statement 
of the project's position on the machine-plus the fact
that you mentioned on the phone-that our whole recording setup 
has been kept very much under the hat. I hope you will
realize that I was completely sincere with you last night when
I said that I have nothing but the greatest personal admiration 
for you and the work you do--that I have discussed you critically
with exactly two people--both of whom have great personal liking
for you and discussed you only from the point of view of your 
enormous potentialities. such discussion certainly goes no further and is entered into 
because you are so important for folk-song that an analysis of your development is essential 
to only one interested in folk-song.
