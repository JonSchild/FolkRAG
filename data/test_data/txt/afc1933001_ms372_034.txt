Dear Sirs
         In your letter dated 
Sept. 12 , 1946 you ask me to 
let you know when my 
book " Home on the Range" was 
out. I have recieved word 
from the Publishers , Chapman 
and Grimes, Inc. 30 Winchester St., 
Boston, Mass, that they are 
releasing the book. I have recieved 
a part of the copies which 
were ordered from this County. 
1000 copies were signed for here 
in the home County. The Company 
also informs me that your 
paper is on the Review List. If 
you do not recieve a copy from 
them I will mail one to you
