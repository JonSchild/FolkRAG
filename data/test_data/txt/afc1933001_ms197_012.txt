Dear Alan:

You should have known that I am always
interested in what you collect. We are at the moment
quite broke, but I should certainly be willing to take
it up with the proper authorities. It is obvious that
I must have more information about the contents of 
your reels and also about any restrictions you might
wish to place upon them.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Music Division
