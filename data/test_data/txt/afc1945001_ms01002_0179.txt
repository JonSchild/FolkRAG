    As you cannot come to Washington, I am 
taking the liberty of forwarding your report to
OCD in the hope that they may be able to take
advantage of some of the points therein if they 
have not yet occurred to them. It is a valuable 
document but would probably be more useful to the 
OCD network than to ourselves.  
                                   Sincerely yours,
                                   R. Keith Kane
