And two other members of the party had parents in Dallas but they didn't even let them know they had been throughthe town. I sup pose you would rather I treat you that way. No, Iwanted to hear you talk even if I could not see you and so I called, and if you were glad I called I have as yet not been informed of the fact! Anyway Deanie said she was glad to talk to me.
