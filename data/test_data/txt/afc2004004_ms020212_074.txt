Dear Mr. Lomax: 
Enclosed is a letter from the Newport Folk Festival people 
to Bessie Jones. Bess Hawes and I have had some good laughs 
out of it, and we cannot recall ever having seen a letter 
which so completely missed its target. We have told Bessie 
what it is about (as nearly as we can tell what it is about) 
and that we are forwarding it to you. 

With best wishes,
Al
