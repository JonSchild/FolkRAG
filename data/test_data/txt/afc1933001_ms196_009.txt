Dear Duncan:

Attached is a letter that will be self-
explanatory.  This old Joe seems to know some real
interesting stuff.  Although much of it is obviously
popular song, still there are a great many unusual folk
tune titles here.  Perhaps you can do something about
this.

The three Library of Congress records
arrived today.  It seems to me that the accoustic
quality is greatly superior to the last issue, and I
congratulate you.  I assume, from your silence, that
it will be impossible for me to get a set of the new
records gratis--even thought I am a graduate archivist.
I'd like to obtain the full set, however, for the
lowest possible price, since I can use them all on my
radio show and for my teaching work at New York University.
What's the best arrangement that you and
Harold can make?

All kindest regards.

Cordially,
Alan Lomax
