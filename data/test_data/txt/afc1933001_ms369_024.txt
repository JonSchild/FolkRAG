Poetic Origins

Up until the beginning of the twentieth century, anthropology
was an armchair science. When a scholar wanted x to write 
about primitives, he took his shears and went to his library
and put together all the accounts of primitives he could find,
not considering the source of his evidence, but only the theory 
he had in mind. It is only in the last few years that 
anthropologists have begun to realize the difficulties in
describing so-called primitive culture.

Just as anthropologists were likely to take for granted the 
evidence of travelers and amateurs, so ballad scholars have
uncritically used any evidence the anthropologist had to
offer as to poetic origins. Since the most obvious feature
of the primitive community at first sight is its homogeneity as contrasted to 
the heterogeneity of our own civilization and since primitive art
has seemed by contrast more a matter of community activity and 
tradition than of genius and originality, the 
most generally accepted theory about the origin of 
poetry has been a communal one. Jakob Grimm, one of the earliest
of folk-lorists propounded this theory in a way that
has called down the ire of critics ever since. Undoubtedly influenced
by the rapidly growing nationalist spirit Germany he
said something to this effect: Folk-songs are composed by the folk
in unison and are an expression of their spirit. They perpetuate
themselves by fitting themselves to new environments with little
or no intentional change on the part of the individual singer."
