Dear Sir,
Will you please send me as
soon as possible some information 
about the folk songs sung west of
the Rocky Mountains?  I should 
like to know the types of songs the
people sing and also the names of
several songs of each type.  This
information is to be used for a 
school project.
Sincerely yours,
Janet E. Pattison
