Study of War Rumors

Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Lincoln, Nebraska, and thence to
Des Moines, Iowa, and to Minneapolis. The travel was accomplished
by train.

No special effort was made to deviate from my usual sphere
of activity.

class as "a rumor." The nearest thing approaching rumors were
the following:

The two above instances are the only ones which might be classed
as rumors and each of them was only heard once.
