  A                                  Anecdote

         "Man overboard," cried the Navy
recruit on his very first voyage aboard
a transport.
           The ships engines were reversed and
the Captain came rushing up from his
cabin. The sailor saluted smartly and
then said, "I regret to report, sir, that I
made a mistake when I cried 'Man overboard'."
           "Confound these dumb recruits," mumbled 
the Captain, and signaled for full
steam ahead."
    "Yes sir," continued the sailor, "it wasn't a
man at all. It was one of them nurses."
