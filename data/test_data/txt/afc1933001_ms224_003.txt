privately, and I'll get out from 
under some way without
embarassment to any one
  The whole point is that I'm 
not asking any one for
favors, and that I positively
decline to be a burden to anybody.
   I take and read the Sunday
New York Times.  The enclosed
clippings interested me.  In
sending them on to you.  There is
no thought of an attempt to propagandizing
 - For some time I have
limited my efforts - futile, I fear -
to influencing you against
the mad course of destroying
your health and efficiency by
too many undertakings.  An increased
income means nothing whatever (except a sop to foolish 
pride) so long as you slosh it all - and more -
down the hatch.
