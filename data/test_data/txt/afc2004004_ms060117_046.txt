4.

trip after all.  Of course, our work is given first priority,
and, if the grant works out, I'll be working with you regardless.
But this is just another reason why I need to know 
pretty soon and pretty definitely.

I met your sister, Bess, briefly at the intermission of a
forum which she was emceeing.  I was quite impressed with
the way she handled things at the forum which was, on the 
whole, interesting, but I was only able to talk with her for
a second at the intermission, and there was no real communication
--just "how do you like LA", etc.  I felt kind of funny
about pressing myself on her, so that was about it.  She seems
to be well known and very much liked among the folk song kids
here.  By the way, I was invited to give a talk on Sacred
Harp music to the Folk Song club, here, which is pretty active.
I saw Charley Seeger about it and he gave me some good advice
and lent me some records.  I'll give the talk in about 
a week.

Let me know when you'll be returning to NYC and also when
you'll be ready to begin if we do get the dough.  Sos I can
maybe see about an alternative summer job in case this falls
through.

Best of luck on your field-trip.  I'm anxious to hear what
you get.  Will it be stereo?  All the best to Toni.  Hope to
see you both in a few months.  Will be glad to get back East,
despite fact that I hate NYC and like LA.

Your friend,
Victor                   

(over).

P.S. Your Siberian stuff looks
like Lapp folk singing.  Also,
a brainstorm--are these & the Lapp songs single parts of a possible
pygmy-type polyphony which is not extant?  The lines look pretty pygmy. -- open voiced?
